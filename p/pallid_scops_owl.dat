50|$|The <b>pallid</b> <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> (Otus brucei) {{is a small}} {{scops owl}} ranging from the Middle East to West and Central Asia, {{sometimes}} called the striated scops owl.|$|E
50|$|The <b>pallid</b> <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> {{is a small}} eared owl {{similar in}} {{appearance}} to the Eurasian scops owl but with more distinct streaks {{on the back and}} less intricate markings.|$|E
50|$|The <b>pallid</b> <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> {{ranges from}} the Middle East to West and Central Asia, with some populations moving {{as far as}} the Arabian Peninsula, Egypt, and Pakistan in the winter. It inhabits semi-open country with trees and bushes and has an {{estimated}} range of one to ten million kilometers.|$|E
50|$|The <b>pallid</b> <b>scops</b> <b>owl's</b> call is {{a series}} of low, hollow, dove-like notes.|$|R
50|$|Primarily an insectivore, the <b>pallid</b> <b>scops</b> <b>owl's</b> diet {{includes}} insects, lizards, spiders, {{and small}} mammals. It occasionally hunts during the day, {{and has been}} known to take bats and insects on the wing.|$|R
50|$|The Mayotte <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> {{has been}} {{considered}} to be conspecific with the Pemba <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> Otus pembaensis, the Anjouan <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> Otus capnodes rainforest <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> and the Torotoroka <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> Otus madagacarensis under O. rutilus but this species has now been split and the Mayotte <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> is now regarded as its own species, mainly based on its very different call. The <b>scops</b> <b>owls</b> of Madagascar, Comoros and Seychelles form a clade within the genus Otus with the Oriental <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> Otus sunia and are not {{closely related to the}} continental African <b>scops</b> <b>owls.</b>|$|R
50|$|The African <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> was {{formerly}} {{regarded as the}} African subspecies of the <b>scops</b> <b>owl.</b> It was grouped with the Arabian <b>scops</b> <b>owl,</b> Socotra <b>scops</b> <b>owl,</b> and the Annobon <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> into Otus senegalensis; however these species are now considered to be separate.|$|R
50|$|The {{rainforest}} <b>scops</b> <b>owl,</b> the Mayotte <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> Otus mayottensis, the Pemba <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> Otus pembaensis and the torotoroka <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> Otus madagascarensis {{have all}} previously been lumped as one species. The taxonomy is {{in state of}} flux but recent genetic studies have placed the Pemba <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> closer to the clade containing the African <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> Otus sengalensis, while the Mayotte <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> is clearly separate from the remaining two. The status of the rainforest and torotoroka <b>scops</b> <b>owls</b> as separate species is debatable as there may be very little genetic distance between the two taxa.|$|R
50|$|The Karthala <b>scops</b> <b>owl,</b> {{also known}} as Grand Comoro <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> or Comoro <b>scops</b> <b>owl,</b> (Otus pauliani) is a small, <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> endemic to the island of Grande Comore in the Comoro Islands.|$|R
50|$|The Torotoroka <b>scops</b> <b>owl,</b> the Mayotte <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> Otus mayottensis, the Pemba <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> Otus pembaensis and the {{rainforest}} <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> Otus rutilus have all previously been lumped as one species. The taxonomy is {{in state of}} flux but recent genetic studies have placed the Pemba <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> closer to the clade containing the African <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> Otus sengalensis, while the Mayotte <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> is clearly separate from the remaining two. The status of {{the rainforest}} and Torotoroka <b>scops</b> <b>owls</b> as separate species is debatable as there may be very little genetic distance between the two taxa and subsequent {{studies have suggested that}} the plumage differences between rutilus and madgascarensis are small and that their voices intergrade. If that is the case then the rainforest and Torotoroka <b>scops</b> <b>owls</b> become subspecies of the Madagascar <b>scops</b> <b>owl.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Philippine <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> (Otus megalotis) is {{a common}} owl, endemic to the Philippines, {{belonging}} {{to the family of}} the typical <b>owls</b> Strigidae. Everett's <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> and Negros <b>scops</b> <b>owls</b> were formerly considered conspecific.|$|R
50|$|The Karthala <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> was {{formerly}} {{considered to be}} a subspecies of the Madagascar <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> Otus rutilus, but with the other Comoro Islands <b>scops</b> <b>owls</b> it is now regarded as a separate species.|$|R
50|$|The sandy <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> {{is thought}} to be basal in the lineage of the genus Otus, along with the Sokoke <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> Otus ireneae, but there has been no genetic {{material}} for testing from the sandy <b>scops</b> <b>owl.</b> In addition some authorities consider that the subspecies of sandy <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> should be teated as two different species.|$|R
50|$|The Seychelles <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> (Otus insularis), {{also known}} as bare-legged <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> or syer (in Creole) is a rare <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> species, which only occurs in the Morne Seychellois National Park on the Seychelles island of Mahé.|$|R
50|$|The {{rainforest}} <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> (Otus rutilus), {{also known}} as the Malagasy <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> or Madagascar <b>scops</b> <b>owl,</b> is a species of owl in the family Strigidae. It is found in a large part of eastern Madagascar, but the exact distribution limits between it and the Torotoroka <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> (O. madagascariensis), with which it was long considered conspecific, require further study.|$|R
50|$|The Socotra <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> was {{previously}} lumped with the African <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> Otus senegalensis but differences in plumage and vocalisations {{have led to}} it being split. Recent genetic research suggests that its closest relatives are the Oriental <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> and the Seychelles <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> Otus insularis. An interesting theory this research has led to is that the oriental <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> is a taxon which evolved from a colonisation of a continent from island ancestors, an event which had previously been thought unlikely because island taxa {{were thought to be}} less competitive than related continental taxa.|$|R
50|$|The oriental <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> (Otus sunia) is {{a species}} of <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> found in eastern and {{southern}} Asia.|$|R
50|$|The Pemba <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> was {{formerly}} {{regarded as a}} subspecies of the Madagascar <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> Otus rutilus sensu lato due to morphological similarities but genetic {{research has shown that}} it is closer to the clade in which the African <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> Otus senegalensis is situated.|$|R
50|$|The sandy <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> (Otus icterorhynchus), or {{cinnamon}} <b>scops</b> <b>owl,</b> is an owl {{form the}} familay Strigidae found in Africa.|$|R
50|$|The Moheli <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> (Otus moheliensis) is a <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> {{endemic to}} the island of Mohéli, one of the Comoro Islands.|$|R
50|$|The Torotoroka <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> (Otus madagascariensis) is a taxon of owl in {{the family}} Strigidae. It is endemic to Madagascar, and was {{previously}} regarded as its own species. However, O. madagascariensis and the rainforest <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> Otus. rutilus have now been re-lumped following Fuchs et al. (2007) as the Madagascar <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> or Malagasy <b>scops</b> <b>owl.</b> The scientific name of the combined species {{is yet to be}} agreed, although rutilus would appear to be have priority.|$|R
5000|$|The Sula <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> (Otus manadensis sulaensis), {{is a small}} owl in the scops-owl genus Otus {{found on}} the Sula Islands. Taxonomically, some groups {{consider}} {{it to be a}} distinct species (Otus sulensis), others a subspecies of the Sulawesi <b>scops</b> <b>owl,</b> and yet others a subspecies of the Moluccan <b>scops</b> <b>owl.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{collared}} <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> {{is a small}} (23-25 cm) owl, {{although it}} is the largest of the <b>scops</b> <b>owls.</b> Like other <b>scops</b> <b>owls,</b> it has small head tufts, or ears. The upperparts are grey or brown, depending on the subspecies, with faint buff spotting. The underparts are buff with fine darker streaking.|$|R
50|$|The Cyprus <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> (Otus cyprius) is an owl {{endemic to}} Cyprus. Some taxonomists {{consider}} {{it to be}} a subspecies of the Eurasian <b>scops</b> <b>owl.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{avifauna}} of Indonesia {{is one of}} {{the richest}} in the World but the taxonomic status of many species remains poorly documented. The sole species of <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> known from Lombok has long been assigned to the widespread Moluccan <b>Scops</b> <b>Owl</b> Otus magicus on the basis of superficial similarities in morphology. Field work in 2003 has shown that the territorial song of the <b>scops</b> <b>owls</b> inhabiting the foothills of Gunung Rinjani differs dramatically from that of O. magicus and is more similar to those of Rufescent <b>Scops</b> <b>Owl</b> O. rufescens and Singapore <b>Scops</b> <b>Owl</b> O. cnephaeus. Detailed comparisons of sound recordings and museum specimens with those of other <b>scops</b> <b>owls</b> in Wallacea and the Indo-Malayan region have confirmed the distinctiveness of the Lombok population. We describe Otus jolandae as a new species, the Rinjani <b>Scops</b> <b>Owl.</b> It is locally common at elevations from 25 - 1350 m and occurs within Gunung Rinjani National Park. The new species is known from seven specimens collected by Alfred Everett in 1896. Otus jolandae represents the first endemic bird species from Lombok...|$|R
50|$|The Indian <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> {{is a small}} (23-25 cm) owl, {{although}} {{it is one of}} the largest of the <b>scops</b> <b>owls.</b> Like other <b>scops</b> <b>owls,</b> it has small head tufts, or ears. The upperparts are grey or brown, depending on the morph, with faint buff spotting. The underparts are buff with fine darker streaking.|$|R
50|$|The {{song of the}} Socotra <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> is a repeated, low pitched {{series of}} notes {{which is similar to}} that {{described}} for the oriental <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> Otus sunia.|$|R
30|$|The {{natural enemies}} of Elegant <b>Scops</b> <b>owls</b> include {{various kinds of}} snakes. Because of {{cultural}} taboos, the Tao people do not hunt for, encroach on, or interfere with Elegant Scops owls; therefore, the indigenous people on Orchid Island are {{not a threat to}} the survival of Elegant <b>Scops</b> <b>owls.</b> However, the number of Elegant <b>Scops</b> <b>owls</b> is low, and they are listed as endangered. After an in-depth analysis of the reason for this, it was determined that the low number of Elegant <b>Scops</b> <b>owls</b> is highly associated with tourism activities. The impacts of tourism activities on Elegant <b>Scops</b> <b>owls</b> are derived from four aspects, including habitat destruction, roadkill, light exposure, and the loss of taboo, each of which is described in the following sections.|$|R
50|$|Little data {{is known}} about the Annobón <b>scops</b> <b>owl.</b> It is {{considered}} to have similar characteristics to the African <b>scops</b> <b>owl,</b> apart from a smaller wing length (about 120-135 mm).|$|R
50|$|This {{species is}} very similar to the {{slightly}} larger partially migratory collared <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> Otus lettia and the oriental <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> Otus sunia. They can be separated on call and eye colour.|$|R
40|$|Breeding {{timing is}} one of the key life-history traits {{considered}} to be under strong stabilizing selection, such that offspring should be born when food resources are most abundant. Predation, however, may also affect the breeding timing because nest predation is a leading mortality for many species, although this possibility has been less considered. Here, we examined the possible effects of nest predation on breeding timing by comparing sympatric <b>scops</b> <b>owls</b> in a subtropical forest where only reptilian predators are present. The Japanese <b>Scops</b> <b>Owl</b> (Otus semitorques Temminck and Schlegel, 1844), a dietary generalist, bred one month earlier than the specialist Ryukyu <b>Scops</b> <b>Owl</b> (Otus elegans (Cassin, 1852)). The breeding timing of the Ryukyu <b>Scops</b> <b>Owl</b> matched with the emergence of their main prey species, but also matched with predator activity. Accordingly, the predation rate on eggs or nestlings was 7. 5 times higher in the Ryukyu <b>Scops</b> <b>Owl</b> (13. 9 %; 21 out of 150 nests) than in the Japanese <b>Scops</b> <b>Owl</b> (1. 9 %; 1 out of 52 nests). Clutch size, on the other hand, was significantly larger in the Ryukyu <b>Scops</b> <b>Owl</b> than in the Japanese <b>Scops</b> <b>Owl,</b> possibly compensating loss from predation. Although alternative explanations still remain, our results suggest that the food generalist might have adjusted its breeding timing to avoid nest predation, whereas the breeding timing of the specialist might have been constrained by the availability of its main prey items...|$|R
40|$|First {{cases of}} {{predation}} by the barn owl Tyto alba and the longeared owl Asio otus on the European <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> Otus <b>scops.</b> The first cases are reported of predation by the barn owl and the long-eared owl on the European <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> {{to be observed}} in the Balearic Islands. These cases are attributed to opportunism presented by the high numbers of European <b>scops</b> <b>owls</b> on passage during the migration periods...|$|R
5000|$|The Eurasian <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> (Otus <b>scops),</b> {{also known}} as the European <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> or just <b>scops</b> <b>owl,</b> is a small owl. This species {{is a part of the}} larger {{grouping}} of owls known as typical owls, Strigidae, which contains most species of owl. The other grouping is the barn owls, Tytonidae. The scientific name is from the Latin otus for an eared owl and Ancient Greek skopos, [...] "watcher".|$|R
