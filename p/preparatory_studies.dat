5|$|Born in Albemarle County, Virginia to John Breckinridge (1760-1806) and Mary Hopkins Cabell Breckinridge (1769-1858), Breckinridge {{moved to}} Kentucky {{with his parents}} in 1793. When John Breckinridge {{was elected to the}} U.S. Senate in 1801, Cabell {{traveled}} with him to Washington, D.C., and completed <b>preparatory</b> <b>studies</b> at New London Academy (now Colby–Sawyer College). In 1806, he enrolled in the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University). His studies were interrupted in 1807 when he participated in a student protest against the strict rules and rigorous curriculum at the institution, but after a year-long break, he returned and completed his bachelor's degree in 1810. After graduation, he married Mary Clay Smith, daughter of Samuel Stanhope Smith, the university's president.|$|E
5|$|Adi Da's {{father told}} Rudi of his son's onetime {{aspiration}} {{to become a}} Lutheran minister. Feeling that he needed better grounding, in 1965 Rudi insisted that he marry Nina, find steady employment, lose weight, end his drug use, and begin <b>preparatory</b> <b>studies</b> to enter the seminary. As a student at Philadelphia's Lutheran Theological Seminary in 1967, Adi Da described undergoing a terrifying breakdown. Taken to a hospital emergency room, a psychiatrist diagnosed it as an anxiety attack. It {{was the first in}} a series of such episodes he would experience throughout his life, each followed by what he explained to be profound awakenings or insights. Feeling none of his Lutheran professors understood this experience, Adi Da left and briefly attended St. Vladimir's Russian Orthodox Seminary in Tuckahoe, New York. Disillusioned, he moved back to New York City and got a job working for Pan American Airlines, in hopes this would facilitate his being able to visit Swami Muktananda's ashram in India. He did so for four days in April 1968. Swami Muktananda encouraged Adi Da to end his studies with Rudi and study with himself directly.|$|E

5|$|In 1801, when Breckinridge was 12 years old, {{his father}} {{was elected to the}} U.S. Senate. The family moved to Bedford County, Virginia, where they lived with {{relatives}} in order to be closer to the elder Breckinridge during the congressional session at Washington, D.C.. While there, Cabell Breckinridge attended New London Academy (now Colby–Sawyer College). A case of measles prevented him from attending William and Mary College (now College of William & Mary), his father's alma mater, where his cousin, future Congressman James Breckinridge, was enrolled. In 1803, he accompanied his father to the capital where he witnessed the debates over the Louisiana Purchase before returning to college in October. After Congress adjourned in March, John Breckinridge met his son in Virginia, and they arrived back at Cabell's Dale, the family estate near Lexington, on April 18, 1804. He did not return to Virginia with his father in late 1804, instead pursuing <b>preparatory</b> <b>studies</b> under Colonel Samuel Wilson in advance of his enrollment at the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University).|$|E

25|$|Because {{the use of}} nude female models was controversial, {{relatively}} few such drawings were made before the 17th century, when academic life classes were established. Before that boys or young men, typically studio apprentices, were used as models for figures of both sexes, as is sometimes rather apparent. Exceptions from the Italian Renaissance include Raphael, who made nude drawings, apparently of his mistress, and Lorenzo Lotto, who recorded in his account book having used women of ill repute as life models. In Florence, Michelangelo and Raphael initiated the practice of making <b>preparatory</b> <b>studies</b> of the nude prior to painting the figure fully clothed, {{in order to better}} understand the underlying structure of the body.|$|E

After being detached for a time in order to serve and gain more experience in the infantry and artillery, Byng sat and passed his entrance exams into the Staff College and secured a nomination in September 1892. A year before Byng entered the college, Albert Victor fell victim to the influenza pandemic that raged around the world, and, at the Prince's funeral on 20 January 1892, Byng commanded the pallbearers (all from the 10th Royal Hussars), which was a significant display of trust shown Byng by the Prince of Wales.|$|E
