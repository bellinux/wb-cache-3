One of the bigger fees came with Gene Kelly's 1967 film A Guide for the Married Man; he was disappointed by Kelly's direction, later saying [...] "I found him a very prudish director, not as imaginative or experimental as I would have liked". Terry-Thomas had more time for the actress with whom he shared his short scene, Jayne Mansfield, commenting that [...] "I found her rather intelligent to talk to and felt quite shattered when I read about the gruesome car accident that killed her". An actress he had difficulties in working with was Doris Day: in the 1968 film Where Were You When the Lights Went Out?, which was produced by her husband Martin Melcher. Day would instruct Terry-Thomas how he should act in a scene (he would [...] "listen... politely, then do it my own way, as if the conversation had never taken place"). She would also launch into improvisations while filming; director Hy Averback would mimic a scissor action behind her back to signal to Terry-Thomas that the material would be duly cut from the final print. The result was a film that Geoff Mayer called [...] "limp", and Christopher Young described as [...] "such an uneven movie that misses so many opportunities for real comedy".|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{combination}} of a boundary element formulation and genetic algorithm (GA) was developed and used for analyzing of cathodic protection systems of buried <b>pipe-lines</b> structures. It {{is very important to}} maintain the effectiveness of the cathodic protection system for pipeline structure, in order to lengthen the lifetime of the system. However, nowadays the evaluation of the effectiveness of the system only could be performed after the system applying in the field. This study was conducted to combine 2 D boundary element method (BEM) and GA in order {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the cathodic protection system for <b>pipe-lines</b> structure using ribbon sacrificial anode. Two factors i. e. the soil conductivity and the distance between <b>pipe-lines</b> and anode, were analyzed by using the proposed method. In this method, the potential in the domain was modeled by Laplace’s equation. The anode and cathode areas were represented by polarization curves of different metals. Boundary element method was applied to solve the Laplace’s equation to obtain any potential and current density in the whole surface of the pipe. The pipe and anode were modeled into 2 D model. The numerical analysis result shows that the optimum distance between <b>pipe-lines</b> and anode can be determined by combining BEM and GA...|$|R

40|$|The {{increase}} in transportation capacities of <b>pipe-lines</b> necessitates {{the introduction of}} new construction tubes and new production technologies. Tubes should be produced according to <b>pipe-lines</b> service parameters. It is therefore useful to produce tubes which vary in diameter, in construction and mainly in the type of steel used for their production. For pipe of great diameter, destined to support high pressure, we use welded tubes made of controlled rolled steel and low alloyed improved steel. Tubes are the main constituents of <b>pipe-lines.</b> Their quality, the properties of their material and their welded joints determine to a high degree the possible deficiencies, stoppages and failures of <b>pipe-lines.</b> This is the reason why it is important to determine the requirements on tube steel and welded joints in terms of the service parameters of <b>pipe-lines</b> in order to avoid their rupture. The welded joints of tubes are subjected to complex static and dynamic loading, which takes place during pipe transportation, and during realization and exploitation of pipelines. The welding process of big diameter pipes is characterized by a great volume of melted metal and a large heat affected zone of the parent metal. The temperature {{in the vicinity of the}} weld joints varies from the melting temperature at the joint to lower temperatures in adjacent zones. In the region of the parent metal subjected to this temperature variation important alterations in the structure and in properties of the material take place. This is why it is estimated important to study this zone in which there is a reduction in the plasticity and the resilience of the metal and consequently there will be an {{increase in}} the probability of crack formation. The creation of a mechanical non-homogeneity in this zone reduces the work capacity of the weld joints and the reliability of <b>pipe-lines</b> reduces. It is in this context that the paper presented includes two parts: The first part is concerned with the hardness distribution and the resilience variation as a function of the temperature distribution in the heat affected zone of pipe. The second part considers the influence of the weld joint shape and the loading regime of the <b>pipe-lines</b> on their weld joints life in the big diameter pipes. This work shows how the bearing capacity of the weld joints wary with the mechanical non-homogeneity of weld properties and quality with their weld shape and with the relative thickness of the diameter layer in the welding. On the other hand this study shows the resilience variations in weld joints and in the parent metal of the pipes in the as bought state and after their mechanical ageing. The stress and strain concentration resulting from irrational configuration of welded joints cause the strength of weld subjected to cyclic loading to be diminished. This has lead to finish this work by the determination of the life specimens taken from weld joints in tubes and subjected to cyclic loads during testin...|$|R
