Analisaram-se os seguintes parâmetros: porcentagem de germinação, primeira contagem e velocidade de germinação e massa seca de plântulas. Os substratos entre areia e vermiculita umedecidos com água em temperatura constante de 25 ou 30 ºC, foram mais eficientes na avaliação da germinação e do vigor em sementes peletizadas de tomate. A temperatura alternada de 20 - 30 ºC e os substratos entre e sobre papel, não se mostraram adequados para avaliar sementes peletizadas de tomate.

40|$|A {{computational}} model is developed {{to predict the}} temperature in chocolate {{as a function of}} space and time during a new tempering process where <b>pellets</b> <b>of</b> <b>seed</b> crystals <b>of</b> form V are added to the melted chocolate. The model, a refined version of a previous one (Debaste et al. J Food Eng. 2008, 88, 568 - 575) including a new expression for the heat sink, is based on the energy equation, simplified by the use of an effective thermal conductivity. A shrinking core model is used to express the heat sink termassociated with the melting <b>of</b> <b>pellets.</b> The width <b>of</b> the limit layer around the pellets is the fitting parameter. The model is validated on experimental temperature profiles in bowls and compared to a previous kinetic model. The quality of tempering is then assessed by differential scanning calorimetry.

Muganli- 57, Ozberk- 82 and Golmarmara type sesame seeds were pelleted and prepared for planting with sensitive pneumatic spacing planter. Bare seeds were pelleted with a special pelleting mixture prepared with four different mixture rates, in a pelleting mechanism. Then, germination tests were done for each. Moreover, the physico-mechanical properties <b>of</b> <b>pelleted</b> sesame <b>seeds</b> are assessed. To accomplish this, properties of these three kinds <b>of</b> sesame <b>seeds,</b> such as length, width, thickness, sphericalness, rolling resistance coefficient on different surfaces, dissolution time in water, refraction resistances <b>of</b> <b>pelleted</b> <b>seeds</b> and the number <b>of</b> <b>seeds</b> in <b>pellets</b> are analyzed. The planting criteria were determined with the laboratory experiments, with a pneumatic spacing planter operated in four different speeds.

The pelleting mixture rate with highest germination was used for pelleting the seeds that were planted in the field trials. The bare seeds were planted with broadcast seeding method as the control group and the pelleted seeds were planted with a pneumatic spacing planter. The emergence rates of three types <b>of</b> sesame <b>seeds</b> in the field were measured. As a result, planting the pelleted seeds with a pneumatic spacing planter led to high emergence rates and smooth sowing.
