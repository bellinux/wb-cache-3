25|$|On March 17, 2008, Apple {{released}} an updated AirPort Express Base Station with 802.11 Draft-N 2x2 radio. All other features (analog and digital optical audio out, single Ethernet port, USB port for <b>printer</b> <b>sharing)</b> remained the same. At the time, {{it was the}} least expensive ($99) device to handle both frequency bands (2.4GHz and 5GHz) in 2x2 802.11 Draft-N.|$|E

50|$|Most compact photo <b>printers</b> <b>share</b> {{a similar}} design. They are small units, usually with large LCDs {{in order to}} allow people to browse and edit their photos, as can be done on a computer. The editing options are usually {{somewhat}} advanced, allowing the user to crop photos, remove red eye, adjust color settings as well as other functions. Compact photo printers typically feature a large number of connection options, including USB and most memory card formats.|$|R
50|$|The works they printed {{are given}} in two lists of their publications, issued in 1470 and 1472. Up to 1472, they had {{published}} twenty-eight theological and classical volumes, namely, the Bible, Lactantius, Cyprian, Augustine, Jerome, Leo the Great, Thomas Aquinas, Cicero, Apuleius, Gellius, Virgil, Livy, Strabo, Pliny, Quintilian, Suetonius, Ovid, etc., in editions varying from 275 to 300 copies each, in all 12,475 volumes. But the <b>printers</b> <b>shared</b> the fate of their master, Gutenberg; they could not sell their books, and fell into want.|$|R
25|$|Stuxnet {{attacked}} Windows systems {{using an}} unprecedented four zero-day attacks (plus the CPLINK vulnerability and a vulnerability {{used by the}} Conficker worm). It is initially spread using infected removable drives such as USB flash drives, which contain Windows shortcut files to initiate executable code. The worm then uses other exploits and techniques such as peer-to-peer RPC to infect and update other computers inside private networks that are not directly connected to the Internet. The number of zero-day exploits used is unusual, as they are highly valued and malware creators do not typically make use of (and thus simultaneously make visible) four different zero-day exploits in the same worm. Amongst these exploits were remote code execution on a computer with <b>Printer</b> <b>Sharing</b> enabled, and the LNK/PIF vulnerability, in which file execution is accomplished when an icon is viewed in Windows Explorer; negating the need for user interaction. Stuxnet is unusually large at half a megabyte in size, and written in several different programming languages (including C and C++) which is also irregular for malware. The Windows component of the malware is promiscuous in that it spreads relatively quickly and indiscriminately.|$|E
2500|$|On June 7, 2004, Apple {{released}} the AirPort Express base station as a [...] "Swiss Army knife" [...] product. It {{can be used}} as a portable travel router, using the same AC connectors as on Apple's AC adapters; as an audio streaming device, with both line-level and optical audio outputs; and as a USB <b>printer</b> <b>sharing</b> device, through its USB host port.|$|E
2500|$|Windows Live OneCare {{features}} integrated anti-virus, personal firewall, and backup utilities, and a tune-up utility {{with the}} integrated functionality of Windows Defender for malware protection. A future {{addition of a}} registry cleaner was considered but not added because [...] "there are not significant customer advantages to this functionality". Version 2 added features such as multi-PC and home network management, <b>printer</b> <b>sharing</b> support, start-time optimizer, proactive fixes and recommendations, monthly reports, centralized backup, and online photo backup.|$|E

50|$|In 1949-1950 Banco Central {{introduced}} new {{notes of}} reduced size (157 × 68 mm) in denominations of 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 sucres, {{and dropped the}} phrase Pagará al portador á la vista (will pay to the bearer at sight), leaving only the literal counter (i.e., the denomination). All banknotes circulated since 1928 had been printed by the American Bank Note Company, but Waterlow and Sons were now given the contract for the 5 and 50 sucre notes, which were the first Ecuadorian notes to have a security thread. In the late 1950s Waterlow was dropped in favour of Thomas de La Rue, which printed 5, 20, 50 and 100 sucre notes, while American Bank Note continued printing 5, 10, 20 and 100 sucre notes. Notes of both <b>printers</b> <b>shared</b> the same basic design, but while American Bank Note used collared planchets as a security device, de La Rue used a metal thread. These notes went through several modifications, and inflorescent security ink was introduced about 1970. A small-size 1000-sucre note was finally put into circulation in 1973.|$|R

50|$|The Buccaneer arose because Brendan Goh and You Jun had to {{prototype}} {{designs for}} school projects frequently {{and the large}} costs led to them experimenting with the then new 3D <b>printers.</b> They <b>shared</b> costs with Roger Chang to purchase a 3D printer by Ultimaker. Experimenting with the printer sparked the idea of setting up a 3D printing company. However, they were advised by Professor Neo Kok Beng to instead build a better printer for sale.|$|R
50|$|The next {{development}} releases added connection interfaces. In 1992, a {{card with}} both 8P8C modular telephone and BNC connectors for Ethernet was released, and in 1993, the first external Jetdirects were introduced with a parallel interface. This enabled Jetdirect cards to connect to almost any printer, making that printer network-capable. In 1995, the Ex plus 3 was released, with 3 parallel ports on one network interface, allowing 3 <b>printers</b> to <b>share</b> 1 network address.|$|R
5000|$|Networked or <b>shared</b> <b>printers</b> are [...] "designed for high-volume, {{high-speed}} printing." [...] They {{are usually}} {{shared by many}} users on a network and can print at speeds of 45 to around 100 ppm. The Xerox 9700 could achieve 120 ppm.|$|R
5000|$|On Windows clients using {{built-in}} PPTP, it {{is recommended}} to disable IPv6, File and <b>Printer</b> <b>Sharing</b> for Microsoft Networks and Client for Microsoft Networks because these features may disclose information.

5000|$|Worth noting is {{the popular}} {{confusion}} between the names NetBIOS and NetBEUI. NetBEUI originated strictly as the moniker for IBM's enhanced 1985 NetBIOS emulator for token ring. The name NetBEUI should have died there, considering {{that at the}} time, the NetBIOS implementations by other companies were known simply as NetBIOS {{regardless of whether they}} incorporated the API extensions found in that emulator. For MS-Net, however, Microsoft elected to name its implementation of the NBF protocol [...] "NetBEUI" [...] - literally naming its implementation of the transport protocol after IBM's second version of the API. Consequently, even today, Microsoft file and <b>printer</b> <b>sharing</b> over Ethernet continues to be called NetBEUI, with the name NetBIOS commonly used only in reference to file and <b>printer</b> <b>sharing</b> over TCP/IP. In truth, the former is the NetBIOS Frames protocol (NBF), and the latter is NetBIOS over TCP/IP (NBT).|$|E
