Another contribution of this paper is the performance comparison between the five detection methods in presence of single leaks in scenarios with noise in measurements and demands in each node. Results showed that in most of the methods efficiency is high, being the best the vector angle method, with efficiencies higher than 96 %. The correlation and optimization method had similar behaviors with efficiencies superior to 90 %.

The experimental results obtained have shown good agreement with theoretical predictions for situations where an external force applied was within a certain range. It was thus concluded that the <b>pressure</b> measurement <b>sensitivities</b> of these specialist fibers are strongly dependent upon the direction of the force applied (with reference to the fast or slow axis of the fibers). Therefore, devices based on these fibers can be used effectively as sensors for the measurement of pressure, force, and mass of an object through an appropriate device configuration, enabling measurements over a wide range and in real time...|$|R

Cuff <b>pressure</b> pain <b>sensitivity</b> was assessed at the arm and lower leg. The subjects scored the pain intensity on an electronic Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) during ten minutes with 25 kPa constant cuff pressure and two minutes with zero pressure. The maximal VAS score and area under the VAS-curve were extracted. Pressure pain thresholds (PPT) were recorded by manual pressure algometry on the ipsilateral tibialis anterior muscle before, {{during and after the}} tonic arm stimulation. Tonic cuff stimulation of the arm and leg resulted in higher VAS peak scores in women compared with men (p< 0. 04). In all groups the PPTs were reduced during and after the cuff stimulation compared with baseline (p= 0. 001).

40|$|SOMATOSENSORY DYSFUNCTION IN FIBROMYALGIA. IMPLICATIONS FOR PATHOPHYSIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS. Eva KosekDissertation {{from the}} Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, Karolinska Institure/Hospital, Stoclcholm, Sweden Fibromyalgia is a chronic pain {{syndrome}} characterized by generalized pain, tenderness,disturbed sleep and pronounced fatigue. The pathophysiology is unknown but peripheralmechanisms (i. e., muscle ischemia) {{as well as}} central mechanisms (dysfunction in endogenouspain modulation) have been implicated. The aim of this thesis was to increase theunderstanding of pathophysiological mechanisms in fibromyalgia by studying the location oftenderness, the perception of somatosensory stimuli, the relationship between ongoing pain andperception of somatosensory stimuli and, furthermore by studying the modulation ofsomatosensory perception during isometric muscular contraction, vibratory stimulation andheterotopic noxious conditioning stimulation. Methods: Thirty-one female fibromyalgia patients, all meeting the classification criteriaproposed by the American College of Rheumatology, and 26 healthy females participated inthe study. Von Frey filaments were used to test low-threshold mechanoreceptive function. <b>Pressure</b> pain <b>sensitivity</b> was assessed with a pressure algometer and thermal sensitivity with aThermotest. A computerized isokinetic system was used for determination of maximalisometric strength and force registration during contraction. Vibratory stimulation (lOOHz) was delivered by an electromechanical vibrator and a submaximal effort tourniquet test wasused for heterotopic noxious conditioning stimulation. Skin hypoesthesia was induced by alocal anesthetic cream (EMLA). Results: Fibromyalgia patients exhibited a generalized, non-modality specific increase in painsensitivity and a further increase in <b>sensitivity</b> to <b>pressure</b> pain and innocuous warmth in areaswith high intensity of spontaneous ongoing pain. The increased <b>pressure</b> pain <b>sensitivity</b> infibromyalgia patients was located deep to the skin but not restricted to muscle tissue. Anabnormal increase in <b>pressure</b> pain <b>sensitivity</b> over the contracting muscle during and followingisometric contraction was demonstrated in fibromyalgia patients, {{as opposed to a}} decrease insensitivity in healthy controls. No abnormalities were found in the endogenous modulation ofsomatosensory perception by activity in large myelinated fibers set up by vibratory stimulation. Decreased sensitivity to innocuous thermal stimulation was seen during and following thetourniquet test in both groups alike, but no modulation of <b>pressure</b> pain <b>sensitivity</b> was foundin fibromyalgia patients during the tourniquet test, as opposed to healthy controls, suggesting adysfunction of 'diffuse noxious inhibitory controls'. Conclusions: The lack of normal modulation of <b>pressure</b> pain <b>sensitivity</b> in fibromyalgiapatients during isometric contraction could be explained by peripheral as well as centralmechanisms. However, the findings that fibromyalgia patients had a generalized, non-modalityspecific increase in pain sensitivity, only partially related to the intensity of ongoing pain in theassessed area, and that the increased <b>pressure</b> pain <b>sensitivity</b> was not restricted to muscletissue support central mechanisms. The absence of normal inhibition of pressure pain sensitivityduring heterotopic noxious conditioning stimulation in fibromyalgia patients can only beexplained by a central nervous system dysfunction.
