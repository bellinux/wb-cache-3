50|$|Genome-based <b>peptide</b> <b>fingerprint</b> {{scanning}} (GFS) is {{a system}} in bioinformatics analysis that attempts to identify the genomic origin (that is, what species they come from) of sample proteins by scanning their peptide-mass fingerprint against the theoretical translation and proteolytic digest of an entire genome. This method is an improvement from previous methods because it compares the peptide fingerprints to an entire genome instead of comparing it to an already annotated genome. This improvement {{has the potential to}} improve genome annotation and identify proteins with incorrect or missing annotations.|$|E
50|$|In February 2013, proteogenomic mapping {{research}} {{was done with}} ENCODE to identify translational regions in the human genome. They applied <b>peptide</b> <b>fingerprint</b> scanning and MASCOT to the protein data to find regions {{that may not have}} been previously annotated as translated in the human genome. This search against the whole genome revealed that approximately 4% of unique peptide that they found were outside of previously annotated regions. Also the comparison of the whole genome revealed 15% more hits than from a protein database search (such as MASCOT) alone. GFS {{can be used as a}} complementary method for annotation due to the fact that you can find new genes or splice sites that have not been annotated before. However it is important to remember that the whole genome approach used by GFS can be less sensitive than programs that look only at annotated regions.|$|E

50|$|In 2012 {{research}} was published where genes and proteins {{were found in}} a model organism {{that could not have}} been found without GFS because they had not been previously annotated. The planarian Schmidtea mediterranea has been used in research for over 100 years. This planarian is capable of regenerating missing body parts and is therefore emerging as potential model organism for stem cell research. Planarians are covered in mucus which aids in locomotion, in protecting them from predation, and in helping their immune system. The genome of Schmidtea mediterranea is sequenced but mostly un-annotated making it a prime candidate for genome-based <b>peptide</b> <b>fingerprint</b> scanning. When the proteins were analyzed with GFS 1,604 proteins were identified. These proteins had mostly not been annotated before they were found with GFS They were also able to find the mucous subproteome (all the genes associated with mucus production). They found that this proteome was conserved in the sister species Schmidtea mansoni. The mucous subproteome is so conserved that 119 orthologs of planarians are found in humans. Due to the similarity in these genes the planarian can now be used as a model to study mucous protein function in humans. This is relevant for infections and diseases related to mucous aberrancies such as cystic fibrosis, asthma, and other lung diseases. These genes could not have been found without GFS because they had not been previously annotated.|$|E

30|$|Food {{protein hydrolysates}} are often {{produced}} in unspecific industrial batch processes. The hydrolysates composition underlies process-related fluctuations {{and therefore the}} obtained <b>peptide</b> <b>fingerprint</b> and bioactive properties may vary. To overcome this obstacle and enable the production of specific hydrolysates with selected peptides, a ceramic capillary system was developed and characterized for the continuous production of a consistent peptide composition. Therefore, the protease Alcalase was immobilized {{on the surface of}} aminosilane modified yttria stabilized zirconia capillaries with a pore size of 1.5  µm. The loading capacity was 0.3  µg enzyme per mg of capillary with a residual enzyme activity of 43 %. The enzyme specific <b>peptide</b> <b>fingerprint</b> produced with this proteolytic capillary reactor system correlated with the degree of hydrolysis, which can be controlled over the residence time by adjusting the flow rate. Common food proteins like casein, sunflower and lupin protein isolates were tested for continuous hydrolysis in the developed reactor system. The peptide formation was investigated by high-performance liquid chromatography. Various trends were found for the occurrence of specific peptides. Some are just intermediately occurring, while others cumulate by time. Thus, the developed continuous reactor system enables the production of specific peptides with desired bioactive properties.|$|E

30|$|Food {{proteins}} {{are important}} macronutrients providing {{the human body}} with essential amino acids. Nutrients of hydrolyzed products are better accessible for the human body, since the proteins are pre-digested (Koopman et al. 2009). Generally, natural enzymatic breakdown occurs in the gastrointestinal tract. Bacteria and cells release digestive enzymes or their inactive precursors. In an activated form, they hydrolyze the protein substrate at specific sites and the released peptides can be absorbed. Some polypeptides with a size of 2 – 20 amino acids show biological activities in terms of regulating the gastrointestinal, nervous, cardiovascular or immune system (Meisel and Bockelmann 1999; Nagpal et al. 2011; Korhonen and Pihlanto 2006) and show anti-microbial (Hancock and Sahl 2006; Haque and Chand 2008) or anti-carcinogenic properties (Fitzgerald 1998; Suarez-Jimenez et al. 2012). When using enzymes for digesting food proteins, an enzyme specific peptide composition, the so-called <b>peptide</b> <b>fingerprint</b> is formed.

RNA alone resulted in the synthesis of four major translation products, whereas RNA hybridized with DNA complementary to the class of abundant poly(A) -containing RNA failed to direct their cell-free synthesis.

We used a panel of 56 hybridomas derived from the fusion of the drug-selected SP- 2 myeloma line with spleen cells from either a 129 GIX+ or a GIX- mouse immunized with purified Rauscher virus gp 70. The results showed that by "natural" breakdown, gp 70 splits into predominant fragments, with Mr 45, 000 (P 45), 34, 000 (P 34), and 32, 000 (P 32). <b>Peptide</b> <b>fingerprinting</b> of these as well as overlapping fragments coupled with partial amino acid sequence analyses allowed us to align the fragments into the linear arrangement NH 2 -P 45 -P 32 -COOH, with P 34 being an NH 2 -terminal degradation product of P 45. Of the 56 hybridomas, 20 immunoprecipitated both P 45 and P 34; 18 immunoprecipitated only P 45; and 18 immunoprecipitated only P 32. The hybridomas thus define three domains of the molecule as NH 2 -P 45 /P 34, P 45 only, and P 32 -COOH. Allowing these hybridomas to react with two Rauscher-derived envelope gene recombinant viruses yielded the following results: (i) all 20 P 45 / 34 reactors bound to the two Rauscher recombinants; (ii) of 18 P 45 -only hybridomas, 10 reacted; and (iii) only 1 of 18 P 32 reactors bound to the Rauscher recombinants.
