Its early releases, in 1968, were distributed by London Records. From the beginning, Sire introduced underground, progressive British bands to the American market. Early releases included the Climax Blues Band, Barclay James Harvest, Tomorrow, Matthews Southern Comfort and proto-punks The Deviants. The label was distributed by Polydor Records in 1970 and 1971, during which time the famous logo was introduced, and then by Famous Music from 1972 to 1974, during which the progressive rock band <b>Focus</b> <b>charted</b> with their 1972 hit [...] "Hocus Pocus".

ABC Records inherited Sire's distribution contract when it acquired Famous Music in 1974.

Method: A cross-sectional survey was administered to pharmacist tutors, with simple descriptive statistics used to calculate frequency counts and <b>percentages.</b> <b>Focus</b> groups with tutors, pharmacy academic staff and students were conducted in order to interpret and develop the survey data. Results: Ninety-six percent of the 27 respondents supported the development of a pharmacy-specific tutor training programme, indicating that they saw their primary role as providing the link between theory and current practice. This was strongly supported by the participants in both the staff and student focus groups. Assessing student performance and giving effective student feedback were identified as two key areas for inclusion in a pharmacist tutor training programme, with 93 % and 89 % of respondents respectively rating these areas as very important and important.

40|$|Drawing on Somatics, phenomenology, psychology, {{personal}} {{teaching strategies}} and feedback from dance students, {{this article discusses}} crossing the objectifying divide between first-person and third-person perspectives of embodiment in dance teaching. Traditionally, western dance training encodes a Cartesian object body, which can potentially confine dancers within an interior landscape that may be multifaceted and complex but not easily integrated or verbally articulated. This can be an objectifying experience for both student and teacher, and counterproductive within a third level education environment where students need to engage critically with new ideas and develop autonomous outlooks {{in order to be}} prepared for professional practice.
