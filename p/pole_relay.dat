40|$|This paper {{introduces}} the wheel chair which {{is controlled by}} voice commands from the handicapped person. Voice commands are received by the android mobile and converted into the text and provided to the Microcontroller PIC 16 F 877 for controlling the movement of wheel chair. The input command from the android mobile is transferred to the Microcontroller {{with the help of}} Bluetooth module wirelessly. Two DC motors are used to control the movement of wheel chair. These motors are connected to the back wheels of wheel chair {{with the help of a}} gear mechanism. Battery is used to provide the power to the DC motors. Two double <b>pole</b> <b>Relays</b> are used, which connects the battery to the DC motors and the operation of relay is controlled by the microcontroller. Two IR sections, forward and backward are used to detect the obstacle in the path of wheel chair. The block diagram, hardware used and performance analysis of wheel chair is presented in this paper...|$|R
50|$|Data {{access to}} the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station is {{provided}} by access via NASA's TDRS-F1, GOES & Iridium satellite constellation. Marisat F-2 provided data communications until it was retired in 2008. For the 2007-2008 season, the TDRS <b>relay</b> (named South <b>Pole</b> TDRSS <b>Relay</b> or SPTR) was upgraded to support a data return rate of 50 Mbit/s, which comprises over 90% of the South Pole's data capability, which is used primarily for scientific data return.|$|R

50|$|The 1964 British West Indies Championships was {{the fifth}} edition of the track and field {{competition}} between British colony nations in the Caribbean. This marked the relaunching of the competition after a three-year break, during which the West Indies Federation had been dissolved. It was held in Kingston, Jamaica. A total of 25 events were contested, fifteen by men and ten by women. The 400 metres {{was added to the}} women's programme. The number of men's events was reduced, with the 10,000 metres, half marathon, <b>pole</b> vault and <b>relay</b> races all being dropped.|$|R
50|$|The 1965 British West Indies Championships was {{the sixth}} and final edition of the track and field {{competition}} between British colony nations in the Caribbean. It was held in Bridgetown, Barbados. The dissolution of the West Indies Federation, and the broader sports co-operation it had engendered, left the competition without the support to continue. A total of 28 events were contested, eighteen by men and ten by women. The men's half marathon, <b>pole</b> vault and <b>relay</b> races were all revived for this final edition, although the 3000 metres steeplechase was dropped. Jamaica was the most successful nation, taking seventeen of the titles on offer - it was Jamaica's fourth win at the competition and the only time a host nation did not top the medal table.|$|R
25|$|Data {{access to}} the station is {{provided}} by access via NASA's TDRS-4, 5, and 6 satellites, the DOD DSCS-3 satellite, and the commercial Iridium satellite constellation. For the 2007–2008 season, the TDRS <b>relay</b> (named South <b>Pole</b> TDRSS <b>Relay</b> or SPTR) was upgraded to support a data return rate of 50 Mbit/s, which comprises over 90% of the data return capability. The TDRS-1 satellite formerly provided services to the station, but it failed in October 2009 and was subsequently decommissioned. Marisat and LES9 were also formerly used. In July 2016, the GOES-3 satellite was decommissioned due to it {{nearing the end of}} its supply of propellant and was replaced by the use of the DSCS-3 satellite, a military communications satellite. DSCS-3 can provide a 30 MB/s data rate compared to GOES-3's 1.5 MB/s. DSCS-3 and TDRS-4, 5, and 6 are used together to provide the main communications capability for the station. These satellites provide the data uplink for the station's scientific data as well as provide broadband internet and telecommunications access. Only during the main satellite events is the station's telephone system able to dial out. The commercial Iridium satellite is used when the TDRS and DSCS satellites are all out of range to give the station limited communications capability during those times. During those times, telephone calls may only be made on several Iridium satellite telephone sets owned by the station. The station's IT system also has a limited data uplink over the Iridium network, which allows emails less than 100KB to be sent and received at all times and small critical data files to be transmitted. This uplink works by bonding the data stream over 12 voice channels.|$|R
40|$|The Lunar Communications Terminal (LCT) COllaborative Modeling and Parametric Assessment of Space Systems (COMPASS) session {{designed}} a terminal to provide communications between lunar South <b>Pole</b> assets, communications <b>relay</b> to/from these assets through an orbiting Lunar Relay Satellite (LRS) and navigation support. The design included a complete master equipment list, power requirement list, configuration design, and brief risk assessment and cost analysis. The Terminal {{consists of a}} pallet containing the communications and avionics equipment, surrounded by the thermal control system (radiator), an attached, deployable 10 -m tower, upon which were mounted locally broadcasting and receiving modems and a deployable 1 m diameter Ka/S band dish which provides relay communications with the lunar relay satellites and, as a backup, Earth when it is in view. All power was assumed {{to come from the}} lunar outpost Habitat. Three LCT design options were explored: a stand-alone LCT servicing the manned outpost, an integrated LCT (into the Habitat or Lunar Lander), and a mini-LCT which provides a reduced level of communication for primarily robotic areas dealing as in situ resource utilization (ISRU) and remote science. Where possible all the designs assumed single fault tolerance. Significant mass savings were found when integrating the LCT into the Habitat or Lander but increases in costs occurred depending upon the level of man rating required for such designs...|$|R
40|$|Although {{advances}} in diffusion tensor imaging have {{enabled us to}} better study the anatomy of the inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF), its function remains poorly understood. Recently, {{it was suggested that}} the subcortical network subserving the language semantics could be constituted, in parallel with the inferior occipitofrontal fasciculus, by the left ILF, joining the posterior occipitotemporal regions to the temporal <b>pole,</b> then <b>relayed</b> by the uncinate fasciculus connecting the anterior temporal pole to the frontobasal areas. Nevertheless, this hypothesis was solely based on neurofunctional imaging, allowing a cortical mapping but with no anatomofunctional information regarding the white matter. Here, we report a series of 12 patients operated on under local anaesthesia for a cerebral low-grade glioma located within the left temporal lobe. Before and during resection, we used the method of intraoperative direct electrostimulation, enabling us to perform accurate and reliable anatomofunctional correlations both at cortical and subcortical levels. In order to map the ILF. Using postoperative MRI, we correlated these functional findings with the anatomical locations of the sites where language disturbances were elicited by stimulations, both at cortical and subcortical levels. Our goal was to study the potential existence of parallel and distributed language networks crossing the left dominant temporal lobe, subserved by distinct subcortical pathways [...] namely the inferior occipitofrontal fasciculus and the ILF. Intraoperative stimulation of the anterior and middle temporal cortex elicited anomia in four patients. At the subcortical level, semantic paraphasia were induced in seven patients during stimulation of the inferior occipitofrontal fasciculus, and phonological paraphasia was generated in seven patients by stimulating the arcuate fasciculus. Interestingly, subcortical stimulation never elicited any language disturbances when performed {{at the level of the}} ILF. In addition, following a transient postoperative language deficit, all patients recovered, despite the resection of at least one part of the ILF, as confirmed by control MRI. On the basis of these results, we suggest that the "semantic ventral stream" could be constituted by at least two parallel pathways within the left dominant temporal lobe: (i) a direct pathway, the inferior occipitofrontal fasciculus, that connects the posterior temporal areas and the orbitofrontal region, crucial for language semantic processing, since it elicits semantic paraphasia when stimulated; (ii) and also possibly an indirect pathway subserved by the ILF, not indispensable for language, since it can be compensated both during stimulation and after resection...|$|R
5000|$|Saint Lawrence Academy Track and Field {{also began}} in 1998, and competed as a {{supplemental}} {{member of the}} West Bay Athletic League (WBAL). The Celtics earned a total of 11 CCS trials qualifications. Celtics athletes have competed in the CCS trials in 2001, 2003, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, and qualified two athletes {{at the end of}} the 2011 season. The 2011 track & field team had a roster of 58 athletes and 4 student managers, representing 25% of the student body. One former student is the 11th best pole vaulter in CCS history and later member of the Cornell University Big Red track & field team, Josh Cusick. During his time at St. Lawrence, Cusick earned All-American status twice: in the decathlon at the 2007 USATF National Junior Olympic Championships in Walnut, California, and in the pentathlon at the 2008 National Scholastic Indoor Championships in New York City. During his junior year, Cusick finished 6th in the state of California at the State Championships in the pole vault. During his senior year he jumped a school record of 16-00.75 and became the 11th best all-time pole vaulter in the CCS. He finished his high school career with a total of 16 school records (400m, 800m, 1000m, 60m/65m/110m/300m/400m hurdles, long jump, high jump, discus, <b>pole</b> vault, 4x400m <b>relay,</b> javelin, pentathlon, and decathlon). In February and May 2011, as a sophomore at Cornell, he became the Ivy League's reigning men's heptathlon runner-up and men's decathlon runner-up at the indoor and outdoor Heptagonal Championships, respectively.|$|R
