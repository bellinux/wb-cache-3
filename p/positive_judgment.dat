25|$|The Land of Israel's {{agriculture}} depends {{heavily on}} rains that come only seasonally, so Jewish prayers for rain, such as Tefillat Geshem or Tikun Geshem (Rain Prayer) are prominent during the Land of Israel's rainy (winter) {{half of the}} year. The rainy season starts just after the fall Jewish holidays. Because of that, and because the sukkah (and, by extension, pleasant weather) is no longer required on Shemini Atzeret, Jews begin to ask for rain starting with the Musaf amidah prayer of Shemini Atzeret. This prayer is recited in a traditional, distinctive, plaintive melody during the cantor's repetition of the amidah. In most Ashkenazi synagogues, the cantor is clad in a white kittel, a symbol of piety, owing to the vitality of a <b>positive</b> <b>judgment</b> for rain. A brief mention of rain continues to be inserted in the amidah until Passover. The Yizkor memorial service is also recited in Ashkenazi synagogues on this day.|$|E

40|$|The Enright Forgiveness Inventory - EFI (Portuguese version) {{was used}} to verify {{relationships}} between forgiveness and degree of injury to the agents of hurt and also the degree of affect, behavior and judgment from victims towards their offenders. It was also checked whether culture, gender, age and religion affect the act of forgiving. Two hundred Brazilians and 394 Americans participated in the study. Findings were similar for both cultures. Forgiveness was negatively related {{to the degree of}} injury. People forgive family and friends at a higher degree than they forgive strangers or co-workers. <b>Positive</b> <b>judgments</b> received significantly higher scores than positive affect. No significant effect was found for forgiveness regarding gender, age or religion. Future studies should verify whether genuine forgiveness shows positive affect for offenders at a same degree as <b>positive</b> <b>judgments</b> or affect remains always lower than judgment for forgiving...|$|R
40|$|Although {{people use}} {{stereotypes}} and prejudices {{to arrive at}} preferred conclusions, individual differences determine the extent and direction to which these intergroup attitudes color judgments. Research demonstrates that numerous personality variables act as predictors {{of the use of}} stereotypes and prejudice. Some {{attempts have been made to}} organize these measures into underlying values systems. I tested the hypotheses that values influence perceptions of ingroups and outgroups. In Study 1, participants completed individual difference measures. Factor analysis revealed two independent factors: Egalitarianism, which predicted <b>positive</b> <b>judgments</b> of outgroups, and Conservatism, which predicted <b>positive</b> <b>judgments</b> of ingroups. In Study 2, participants read a story describing either a gay or heterosexual man. I predicted that participants would vary their interpretation of the target based on their value orientations.

60|$|Concerning {{the history}} of Beowulf a whole library has been written, and {{scholars}} still differ too radically for us to express a <b>positive</b> <b>judgment.</b> This much, however, is clear,--that there existed, {{at the time the}} poem was composed, various northern legends of Beowa, a half-divine hero, and the monster Grendel. The latter has been interpreted in various ways,--sometimes as a bear, and again as the malaria of the marsh lands. For those interested in symbols the simplest interpretation of these myths is to regard Beowulf's successive fights with the three dragons as the overcoming, first, of the overwhelming danger of the sea, which was beaten back by the dykes; second, the conquering of the sea itself, when men learned to sail upon it; and third, the conflict with the hostile forces of nature, which are overcome at last by man's indomitable will and perseverance.|$|E
6000|$|GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS. In {{treating}} of Thackeray's view of life, {{as reflected}} in his novels, critics vary greatly, and the following summary must be taken not as a <b>positive</b> <b>judgment</b> but only {{as an attempt to}} express the general impression of his works on an uncritical reader. He is first of a realist, who paints life as he sees it. As he says himself, [...] "I have no brains above my eyes; I describe what I see.". His pictures of certain types, notably the weak and vicious elements of society, are accurate and true to life, but they seem to play too large a part in his books, and have perhaps too greatly influenced his general judgment of humanity. An excessive sensibility, or the capacity for fine feelings and emotions, is a marked characteristic of Thackeray, as it is of Dickens and Carlyle. He is easily offended, as they are, by the shams of society; but he cannot find an outlet, as Dickens does, in laughter and tears, and he is too gentle to follow Carlyle in violent denunciations and prophecies. He turns to satire,--influenced, doubtless, by eighteenth-century literature which he knew so well, and in which satire played too large a part.[241] His satire is never personal, like Pope's, or brutal, like Swift's, and is tempered by kindness and humor; but it is used too freely, and generally lays too much emphasis on faults and foibles to be considered a true picture of any large class of English society.|$|E
60|$|It is a general, but, as {{it appears}} to me, a mistaken opinion, that in our {{ordinary}} dreams we judge the objects to be real. I say our ordinary dreams;--because as to the night-mair the opinion is to a considerable extent just. But the night-mair is not a mere dream, but takes place when the waking state of the brain is recommencing, and most often during a rapid alternation, a twinkling, as it were, of sleeping and waking;--while either from pressure on, or from some derangement in, the stomach or other digestive organs acting on the external skin (which is still in sympathy with the stomach and bowels,) and benumbing it, the sensations sent up to the brain by double touch (that is, when my own hand touches my side or breast,) are so faint as to be merely equivalent to the sensation given by single touch, as when another person's hand touches me. The mind, therefore, which at all times, with and without our distinct consciousness, seeks for, and assumes, some outward cause for every impression from without, and which in sleep, by aid of the imaginative faculty, converts its judgments respecting the cause into a personal image as being the cause,--the mind, I say, in this case, deceived by past experience, attributes the painful sensation received to a correspondent agent,--an assassin, for instance, stabbing at the side, or a goblin sitting on the breast. Add too that the impressions of the bed, curtains, room, &c. received by the eyes in the half-moments of their opening, blend with, and give vividness and appropriate distance to, the dream image which returns when they close again; and thus we unite the actual perceptions, or their immediate reliques, with the phantoms of the inward sense; and in this manner so confound the half-waking, half-sleeping, reasoning power, that we actually do pass a <b>positive</b> <b>judgment</b> on {{the reality of what}} we see and hear, though often accompanied by doubt and self-questioning, which, as I have myself experienced, will at times become strong enough, even before we awake, to convince us that it is what it is--namely, the night-mair.|$|E

5000|$|Following Kirkwood, Scott R. Stroud is {{particularly}} interested in [...] "multivalent narratives," [...] or narratives that include a variety of seemingly contradictory values or positions that force a reader to reconstruct their meaning, thereby enabling <b>positive</b> <b>judgments</b> of narrative fidelity and the adoption of new values for their own lives. In a later study, Stroud examines other Indian philosophical texts to further categorize the types of multivalent narratives that creatively use contradictory elements to enable judgments of narrative fidelity.|$|R

40|$|The present {{experiment}} {{tested the}} assumption that mood effects in evaluative online judgments are influenced by two processes. The integration of mood as one piece of information into the overall judgment produces assimilation. The comparison of a judgmental issue with a meaningful standard of reference pro-duces contrast. The standard of reference that produces the con-trast effect can sometimes be {{the same thing that}} produces the mood state, which in turn, produces the assimilation effect. Par-ticipants were induced into a positive or negative mood and then rated their satisfaction with three life domains that were differ-ently related to the mood-inducing event. The data revealed a crossover interaction reflecting a mood assimilation effect when no similarity between mood-inducing event and judgmental domain existed, no observable effect in the case of moderate simi-larity, and a mood-inducing event contrast effect in high simi-larity conditions. The within-cell correlations between mood and <b>judgments</b> were all <b>positive.</b> MOOD IMPACT ON EVALUATIVE JUDGMENTS Plenty of research has revealed that evaluative judg-ments can be assimilated toward the evaluative valence of a current mood state. This assimilation, or mood con-gruency effect, means that persons in a positive mood make more <b>positive</b> <b>judgments</b> than persons in a neutral mood, who in turn make more <b>positive</b> <b>judgments</b> than persons in a negative feeling state (for reviews, see Clark &...|$|R

50|$|In {{letters of}} {{complaint}} to Emperor Siegmund, Speyer endeavoured {{to have the}} verdict abrogated or at least attenuated.

Eventually, Siegmund did scrap the verdict and fully restored {{the rights of the}} city, but the document was never issued. Raban, together with the archbishop of Mainz, again managed to foil a <b>positive</b> <b>judgment</b> for Speyer. The city at least received a formal confirmation of its privileges and customary law but Conrad's verdict nevertheless remained in place for all newly upcoming disagreements and couldn't be altered without the clergy's consent. For Speyer this constituted in considerable financial losses, constraints in its previous rights and thus in a setback in its urban development. The loss of its imperial freedoms was staved off only narrowly. The legal distinction between citizens of the city and its ecclesiastic inhabitants remained. Bishop Raban's struggle for dominion in the city failed and Speyer slowly recovered from this crisis.|$|E

5000|$|The word mannerism {{derives from}} the Italian maniera, meaning [...] "style" [...] or [...] "manner". Like the English word [...] "style", maniera can either {{indicate}} {{a specific type of}} style (a beautiful style, an abrasive style) or indicate an absolute that needs no qualification (someone [...] "has style"). In the second edition of his Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects (1568), Giorgio Vasari used maniera in three different contexts: to discuss an artist's manner or method of working; to describe a personal or group style, such as the term maniera greca to refer to the Byzantine style or simply to the maniera of Michelangelo; and to affirm a <b>positive</b> <b>judgment</b> of artistic quality. Vasari was also a Mannerist artist, and he described the period in which he worked as [...] "la maniera moderna", or the [...] "modern style". James V. Mirollo describes how [...] "bella maniera" [...] poets attempted to surpass in virtuosity the sonnets of Petrarch. This notion of [...] "bella maniera" [...] suggests that artists thus inspired looked to copying and bettering their predecessors, rather than confronting nature directly. In essence, [...] "bella maniera" [...] utilized the best from a number of source materials, synthesizing it into something new.|$|E

50|$|In a more {{everyday}} sense, {{faith is}} often discussed {{in terms of}} believing God's promises, trusting in his faithfulness, and relying on God's character and faithfulness to act. Yet, many Protestants stress that genuine faith is also acted on, and thus it brings about different behaviour or action and does not consist merely of mental belief, trust or confidence or outright antinomianism. Hence, having authentic 'faith in Jesus' is generally understood to lead to changes in how one thinks and lives. However, the Protestant tradition holds that these changes in character and conduct do not have any value for obtaining a <b>positive</b> final <b>judgment,</b> but that a <b>positive</b> final <b>judgment</b> depends on faith alone (sola fide).|$|R

40|$|Although {{misjudgment}} is {{an issue}} of primary concern to the justice system and public safety, the response to misjudgment by the human brain remains unclear. We used fMRI to record neural activity in participants that encountered four possible judgments by the justice system with two basic components: whether the judgment was right or wrong [accuracy: right vs. wrong (misjudgment) ] and whether the judgment was positive or negative [valence: positive vs. negative]. As hypothesized, the rostral ACC specifically processes the accuracy of judgment, being more active for misjudgment than for right judgment, while the striatum was uniquely responsible for the valence of judgment, being recruited to a larger extent by <b>positive</b> <b>judgment</b> compared to negative judgment. Furthermore, the activity in the rACC for positive misjudgments was positively correlated with that for negative misjudgments, which confirmed the misjudgment-specificity of the rACC. These results demonstrate that the brain can distinguish a misjudgment from a right judgment and regard a misjudgment as an emotionally arousing stimulus, independent of whether it is positive or negative, while <b>positive</b> <b>judgment</b> is considered as hedonic information, regardless of whether it is right or wrong. Our study is the first to reveal the neural mechanism that underlies judgment processing.

In this article, the authors study people's normative beliefs about the acceptability of violence to achieve social control (as {{a substitute for the}} police, for self-protection and the resolution of disputes) and social change (through violent protests and acts to achieve political goals). Addressing attitudes toward violence among young men from various ethnic minority communities in London, the authors find that procedural justice is strongly correlated with police legitimacy, and that <b>positive</b> <b>judgments</b> about police legitimacy are associated with more negative views about the use of violence. They conclude with the idea that police legitimacy has an additional, hitherto unrecognized, empirical property-by constituting the belief that the police monopolise rightful force in society, legitimacy has a "crowding out" effect on positive views of private violence. © 2013 American Psychological Association...|$|R
