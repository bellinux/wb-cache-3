40|$|AcomA aneurysms are {{complicated}} and high incidence lesions. The successful treatment depends on understanding the anatomical location of aneurysm. The early surgery and selecting the superior method of surgery and <b>post-operative</b> <b>cares</b> affect the surgical outcomes of these patients. In this study 30 {{patients who were}} admitted to Firoozgar Hospital in a 3 -year period (2001 - 2004), undergone surgery. In all patients early surgery with Pterioneal method was confirmed. We apply the basic tenets of aneurysm surgery, including vascular control, sharp dissection, meticulous preservation of perforating arteries and intraoperative monitoring to lesions of the AcomA complex. This focus eliminates unnecessary operative manipulations and we prepare for any crises that might arise. The majority of patients (83. 3 %) were in grade I or II (Hunt and Hess scale). The rate of mortality was 10 %.

40|$|OBJECTIVE Endoscopic lung volume {{reduction}} (ELVR) with valves {{has been}} shown to improve COPD patients with severe emphysema. However, a major complication is pneumothoraces, occurring typically soon after valve implantation, with severe consequences if not managed promptly. Based on the knowledge that strain activity is related to a higher risk of pneumothoraces, we asked whether modifying <b>post-operative</b> medical <b>care</b> with the inclusion of strict short-term limitation of strain activity is associated with a lower incidence of pneumothorax. METHODS Seventy-two (72) emphysematous patients without collateral ventilation were treated with bronchial valves and included in the study. Thirty-two (32) patients received standard post-implantation medical management (Standard Medical Care (SMC)), and 40 patients received a modified medical care that included an additional bed rest for 48 hours and cough suppression, as needed (Modified Medical Care (MMC)). RESULTS The baseline characteristics were similar for the two groups, except there were more males in the SMC cohort. Overall, ten pneumothoraces occurred up to four days after ELVR, eight pneumothoraces in the SMC, and only two in the MMC cohorts (p= 0. 02). Complicated pneumothoraces and pneumothoraces after upper lobe treatment were significantly lower in MMC (p= 0. 02). Major clinical outcomes showed {{no significant differences between the}} two cohorts. CONCLUSIONS In conclusion, modifying <b>post-operative</b> medical <b>care</b> to include bed rest for 48 hours after ELVR and cough suppression, if needed, might reduce the incidence of pneumothoraces. Prospective randomized studies with larger numbers of well-matched patients are needed to confirm the data...|$|R
30|$|Common and {{well-known}} complications after SAH include hydrocephalus, vasospasm, infarction and cerebral edema. These {{often require}} invasive procedures including angiography or ventriculostomy {{which lead to}} additional risks of <b>post-operative</b> morbidity. <b>Care</b> should be taken not to misdiagnose brain sag if these patients present with an altered mental status, pupillary changes, or a decerebrate posture after lumbar CSF drainage (for example performed during aneurysmal surgery). Intracranial hypotension has also been reported in various surgical intracranial procedures without lumbar drainage. However, we conclude that lumbar drainage of the CSF {{was responsible for the}} hypotension in this case because the patient became progressively aggravated after intraoperative lumbar drainage without any surgical intervention.|$|R
