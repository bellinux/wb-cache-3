40|$|Application of {{epoxy resin}} to make {{specimen}} <b>punching</b> <b>pad</b> was studied. The specimen <b>punching</b> <b>pad</b> compound {{was made from}} epoxy resin, CaCO 3 as filler, colour paste, and hardener. The compound was moulded in to specimen punching and moulding by casting moulding during 24 hours. Physical test result of the compound saw that compound which it consist of epoxy resin : 100 parts, CaCO 3 : 20 parts, hardener : 100 parts, colour paste : 1 required, has physical property like the physical property of the imported specimen <b>punching</b> <b>pad.</b> Presence of CaCO 3 as filler caused the specimen <b>punching</b> <b>pad</b> surface which it punched by cutter became brittle...|$|E
50|$|The bonus {{levels are}} an {{adaptation}} of the arcade version. The major difference is that {{since there is no}} <b>punch</b> <b>pad,</b> the player must charge strength by repeatedly rotating the d-pad.|$|R
50|$|The arcade version {{consists}} of hitting the enemies and targets. In order to win, each target has a set {{a number of}} tons of resistance. Once they are depleted, they will be defeated. To hit the target, the game features a pair of gloves and a mechanical <b>punch</b> <b>pad</b> that rises {{when it is time}} to attack. The player must wear the gloves and <b>punch</b> the <b>pad</b> strongly enough to deal damage. Only three hits are allowed.|$|R
50|$|When an {{on-screen}} enemy {{makes an}} attack on the player, a <b>punch</b> <b>pad</b> will swing out on its hinge at a smooth pace, and upon reaching full extension at 90 degrees, the LEDs light up red. The pad stays lit for a short time, and then the pad returns inside the cabinet to rest. The player must <b>punch</b> this <b>pad</b> while the LEDs are lit. The strength of the player's punch is irrelevant to the game, and the game warns the player not to punch hard, to prevent the risk of breaking the machine. Only the timing of the punch is important, punches should be delivered at half strength, with exact timing.|$|R
50|$|In the deluxe {{version of}} the arcade game, the player's {{controls}} consist of a standard eight-way joystick, and two large, unique mechatronic <b>pads</b> for <b>punches</b> and kicks that returned an analog value depending on how hard the player actuated the control. An alternate version was released that replaces the two <b>punching</b> <b>pads</b> {{with an array of}} six attack buttons, three punch buttons and three kick buttons of different speed and strength (Light, Medium and Heavy).|$|R

50|$|After {{spending}} a few moments at the <b>punch</b> <b>pad</b> game, Oswald and the girl beagle decide to have a ride. They then select a bizarre one operated by a marsupial. The girl beagle was first to go as the marsupial launches her {{high in the air}} where she lands and slides onto a series of animals. In the end, however, she was nabbed by the pit bull. Oswald comes to her assistance by picking up a bow and shooting arrows at the pit bull's back. In this, the large dog drops the girl beagle and sets sights on the rabbit.|$|R
40|$|Keywords：Sheet metal；CAM；Punch pad；Multipoint Forming；Hydro-forming Abstract. The novel {{multipoint}} forming technology {{based on}} Hydro-forming processing was developed, and the drive mode was discussed. Die {{is replaced by}} liquid, and punch is formed by adjusting the multipoint fundamental elements. Finally through controlling the fundamental elements, {{the height of a}} serial of discrete, regularly-arranged fundamental elements is adjusted, and by using the <b>punch</b> <b>pad,</b> the accuracy of sheet metal surface contour is improved in multipoint forming technology. Then, the hydro-forming set was developed, and experimented. It provides a new efficient dieless forming method for the digital flexible forming of sheet metal...|$|R
5000|$|The arcade cabinet stands about 6'2" [...] tall, 34" [...] wide (when {{facing the}} machine), and about 4' deep. The monitor is {{recessed}} into the cabinet a fair distance, {{and in the}} front of the cabinet are six orange, sturdy <b>punching</b> <b>pads</b> with red LED lights embedded near their hinges. The pads are at rest along the inside walls of the recession of the cabinet, lining the monitor. There are also two black plastic [...] "special gloves" [...] that rest in pockets on the front of the machine, which are normally tied with rope or chain to the arcade cabinet to prevent theft. The player is to wear these gloves while playing (although it is also common practice to play without the gloves, though this can scrape the knuckles).|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} three {{experiments}} demonstrate that physically aggressive displays {{are part of}} men's cultural script for restoring threatened gender status. In Studies 1 and 2, challenges to men's gender status elicited heightened physically aggressive displays, including <b>punching</b> a <b>pad</b> with greater force and selecting an aggressive boxing activity over a nonaggressive puzzle activity. Study 3 established that a public display of aggressive readiness reduced men's anxiety-related cognitions {{in the wake of}} a gender threat. This suggests that aggressive displays may function to downregulate negative affect when manhood has been threatened. The discussion considers past research on gender and physical aggression in light of the authors' thesis that manhood, relative to womanhood, is culturally defined as a precarious status that must be actively, even aggressively, defended...|$|R
40|$|Topography on wafer surface affects chemical-mechanical {{polishing}} (CMP) greatly. In this paper, 2 -D wafer topography’s {{effects on the}} contact pressure in CMP are investigated and calculated. It is found that the wafer can {{be treated as a}} rigid <b>punch</b> and <b>pad</b> as an elastic half space when the effects of the pattern features on the wafer surface are investigated. Based on the linear small strain theory of elasticity, the formula of calculating the contact pressure between the wafer and the pad is given. The performance of CMP system is shown to be a linear time invariant (LTI) system in a mathematical way. The magnitude spectra and phase spectra of the system are obtained exactly by the formula. The contact pressure for 2 -D wafer topography during CMP can be calculated easily by the formula...|$|R
50|$|<b>Punching</b> a <b>pad</b> when it {{is fully}} {{extended}} and the LEDs lit results in the attack being blocked, and the opponent receiving damage {{in the form of}} a counter-attack. Punching too early or too late results in either blocking the move with no counter-attack, or receiving lessened damage from the attack, also with no counter-attack damage to the opponent. Missing a pad completely (the pad retracting without ever being hit) results in full damage taken by the player. As opponents get more difficult - and particularly when they use their special moves - punches will be thrown and pads will pop out in faster succession and in more chaotic patterns, or special precautions may need to be taken, such as only striking one pad that is lit while other dummy pads pop up, or striking pads in the exact order they deploy.|$|R
5000|$|A heavy bag is a larger, {{cylindrical}} bag, usually {{suspended by}} chains or ropes {{and used for}} practicing powerful body punches, {{and can be used}} to toughen hands or any other limb used to hit the bag. [...] Heavy bags are for developing power; technique is best learned on the <b>punch</b> mitts or <b>pads.</b> Some variants of heavy bag are a Banana Bag used in Muay Thai and which is longer than a regular heavy bag to train low kicks and knee strikes and a slim line bag that is thinner than a heavy bag.|$|R
40|$|Nine subjects, 14 to 18 yr old, {{pulled a}} knob on a {{schedule}} of monetary reinforcement. Concurrently, they escaped or avoided periodic presentations of a tone by pressing a button that required 1. 5 lb (6. 67 N) of force or by <b>punching</b> a <b>padded</b> cushion that required 20 lb (88. 96 N) of force. The punching response was designated as an aggressive response because the force of this response together with its topography was comparable to responses of humans that deface objects and produce escape or counter aggression from other humans. It was found that button pressing was the preferred concurrent avoidance response and there were few punches. However, when the monetary reinforcer was discontinued (extinction) punching increased for seven of the nine subjects, {{but there was no}} consistent change in the rate of button pressing. When the punching response was replaced by another non-preferred but non-aggressive response, neither this response nor button pressing increased during extinction. Hence, the increase in punching during extinction cannot be attributed solely {{to the fact that it}} was a concurrent response or a non-preferred response...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanical}} properties of a boxing punch have been determined using several techniques. The {{results are consistent}} with the medical consequences of boxing discussed in the report of the Board of Science and Education Working Party on boxing. Data were gathered from a world ranked British professional heavyweight, Frank Bruno, as he <b>punched</b> an instrumented, <b>padded</b> target mass suspended as a ballistic pendulum. Within 0. 1 s of the start the punch had travelled 0. 49 m and attained a velocity on impact of 8. 9 m/s. The peak force on impact of 4096 N (0. 4 ton), attained within 14 ms of contact, represents a blow to the human head of up to 6320 N (0. 63 ton). The transmitted impulse generated an acceleration of 520 m/s 2 (53 g) in the target head. For comparison an equivalent blow would be delivered by a padded wooden mallet with a mass of 6 kg (13 lbs) if swung at 20 mph...|$|R
