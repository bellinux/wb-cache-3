5|$|Several {{relatively}} simple chemical tests — commercially available as reagent testing kits — {{can be used}} to assess the presence of psilocybin in extracts prepared from mushrooms. The drug reacts in the Marquis test to produce a yellow color, and a green color in the Mandelin test. Neither of these tests, however, is specific for psilocybin; for example, the Marquis test will react with many classes of controlled drugs, such as those containing primary amino groups and unsubstituted benzene rings, including amphetamine and methamphetamine. Ehrlich's reagent and DMACA reagent are used as chemical sprays to detect the drug after thin layer chromatography. Many modern techniques of analytical chemistry have been used to quantify psilocybin levels in mushroom samples. Although the earliest methods commonly used gas chromatography, the high temperature required to vaporize the psilocybin sample prior to analysis causes it to spontaneously lose its <b>phosphoryl</b> <b>group</b> and become psilocin — making it difficult to chemically discriminate between the two drugs. In forensic toxicology, techniques involving gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC–MS) are the most widely used due to their high sensitivity and ability to separate compounds in complex biological mixtures. These techniques include ion mobility spectrometry, capillary zone electrophoresis, ultraviolet spectroscopy, and infrared spectroscopy. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is used with ultraviolet, fluorescence, electrochemical, and electrospray mass spectrometric detection methods.|$|E

This ubiquitous chemical scaffold has, therefore, been proposed to be a remnant of the RNA world, with early ribozymes evolving to bind a restricted set of nucleotides and related compounds. Adenosine-based cofactors are thought to have acted as interchangeable adaptors that allowed enzymes and ribozymes to bind new cofactors through small modifications in existing adenosine-binding domains, which had originally evolved to bind a different cofactor. This process of adapting a pre-evolved structure for a novel use is known as exaptation.|$|E

40|$|CheA is a multidomain {{histidine}} kinase for chemotaxis in Escherichia coli. CheA autophosphorylates through {{interaction of}} its N-terminal phosphorylation site domain (P 1) with its central dimerization (P 3) and ATPbinding (P 4) domains. This activity is modulated through the C-terminal P 5 domain, which couples CheA to chemoreceptor control. CheA <b>phosphoryl</b> <b>groups</b> are donated to two response regulators, CheB and CheY, to control swimming behavior. The phosphorylated forms of CheB and CheY turn over rapidly, enabling receptor signaling complexes to elicit fast behavioral responses by regulating {{the production and}} transmission of <b>phosphoryl</b> <b>groups</b> from CheA. To promote rapid phosphotransfer reactions, CheA contains a phosphoacceptor-binding domain (P 2) that serves to increase CheB and CheY concentrations {{in the vicinity of}} the adjacent P 1 phosphodonor domain. To determine whether the P 2 domain is crucial to CheA’s signaling specificity, we constructed CheA�P 2 deletion mutants and examined their signaling properties in vitro and in vivo. We found that CheA�P 2 autophosphorylated and responded to receptor control normally but had reduced rates of phosphotransfer to CheB and CheY. This defect lowered the frequency of tumbling episodes during swimming and impaired chemotactic ability. However, expression of additional P 1 domains in the CheA�P 2 mutant raised tumbling frequency, presumably by buffering the irreversible loss of CheA�P 2 -generated <b>phosphoryl</b> <b>groups</b> from CheB and CheY, and greatly improved its chemotactic ability.

40|$|Bacterial {{motility}} {{and gene}} expression {{are controlled by}} a family of phosphorylated response regulators whose activities are modulated by an associated family of protein-histidine kinases. In chemotaxis there are two response regulators, CheY and CheB, that receive <b>phosphoryl</b> <b>groups</b> from the histidine kinase, CheA. Here we show that the response regulators catalyze their own phosphorylation in that both CheY and CheB can be phosphorylated in the complete absence of any auxiliary protein. Both CheY and CheB use the N-phosphoryl group in phosphoramidate (NH 2 PO 3 (2 -)) as a phospho-donor. This enzymatic activity probably reflects the general ability of response regulators to accept <b>phosphoryl</b> <b>groups</b> from phosphohistidines in their associated kinases.

50|$|The {{first step}} in the forward {{reaction}} is the transfer of a <b>phosphoryl</b> <b>group</b> from the enzyme to glucose 1-phosphate, forming glucose 1,6-bisphosphate and leaving a dephosphorylated form of the enzyme.

Substrate-velocity relationships and induced transport tests have revealed that the dephosphorylated enzyme then facilitates the transfer of a <b>phosphoryl</b> <b>group</b> from the glucose-1,6-bisphosphate intermediate to the enzyme, regenerating phosphorylated phosphoglucomutase and yielding glucose 6-phosphate (in the forward direction). Later structural studies confirmed that the single site in the enzyme that becomes phosphorylated and dephosphorylated is the oxygen of the active-site serine residue (see diagram below). A bivalent metal ion, usually magnesium or cadmium, is required for enzymatic activity and has been shown to complex directly with the <b>phosphoryl</b> <b>group</b> esterified to the active-site serine.|$|E
5000|$|In {{orthodox}} two-component signaling, a histidine kinase protein autophosphorylates on a histidine residue {{in response}} to an extracellular signal, and the <b>phosphoryl</b> <b>group</b> is subsequently transferred to an aspartate protein on the receiver domain of a response regulator.

The relay system thus progresses in the order His-Asp-His-Asp, with the second His contributed by Hpt. In some cases, a phosphorelay system is constructed from four separate proteins rather than a hybrid histidine kinase with an internal receiver domain, and in other examples both the receiver and the HPt domains are present in the histidine kinase polypeptide chain. A census of two-component system domain architecture found that HPt domains in bacteria are more common as domains of larger proteins than they are as individual proteins.|$|E
