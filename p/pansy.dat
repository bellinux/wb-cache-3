5|$|In the 1990s, the queercore {{movement}} developed {{around a}} number of punk bands with gay, lesbian, bisexual, or genderqueer members such as God Is My Co-Pilot, <b>Pansy</b> Division, Team Dresch, and Sister George. Inspired by openly gay punk musicians of an earlier generation such as Jayne County, Phranc, and Randy Turner, and bands like Nervous Gender, the Screamers, and Coil, queercore embraces a variety of punk and other alternative music styles. Queercore lyrics often treat the themes of prejudice, sexual identity, gender identity, and individual rights. The movement has continued into the 21st century, supported by festivals such as Queeruption.|$|E
5|$|On {{the same}} day, United Democratic Movement leader Bantu Holomisa {{announced}} that lawyers acting {{on behalf of}} several opposition parties concerned about the credibility of the general election would approach the Electoral Court following the IEC chairperson <b>Pansy</b> Tlakula's refusal to agree to their call for her resignation. Public Protector Thuli Madonsela found Tlakula had been involved in building procurement irregularities in a report published in August 2013, and a subsequent National Treasury review published in March 2014 supported her findings. Five days before the election, the Electoral Court postponed the inquiry into her conduct until 2 June 2014, as it {{would not be able to}} rule on the matter before the 7 May election date. On 18 June, the Electoral Court recommended Tlakula's removal from office due to financial misconduct. Tlakula resigned as IEC chairperson on 1 September after an unsuccessful application to the Constitutional Court for leave to appeal the Electoral Court ruling.|$|E

50|$|<b>Pansies</b> are {{winter hardy}} in zones 4-8. They can survive light freezes and {{short periods of}} snow cover, but, in areas with {{prolonged}} snow cover, a covering of a dry winter mulch is recommended. In warmer climates, zones 9-11, <b>pansies</b> can bloom over the winter, and are often planted in the fall. In warmer zones, <b>pansies</b> may re-seed themselves and return the next year. They are not very heat-tolerant; warm temperatures inhibit blooming and hot muggy air causes rot and death. In colder zones, <b>pansies</b> may not survive without snow cover or protection (mulch) from extreme cold or periods of freezing and thawing. They perform best in zones with moderate temperatures, and equal amounts of mild rainfall and sunshine.|$|R

This study aimed to clarify the physiological and psychological effects on high school students of viewing real and artificial <b>pansies.</b> Forty high school students (male: 19, female: 21) at Chiba Prefectural Kashiwanoha Senior High School, Japan, participated in this experiment. The subjects were presented with a visual stimulation of fresh yellow <b>pansies</b> (Viola x wittrockiana “Nature Clear Lemon”) in a planter for 3 min. Artificial yellow <b>pansies</b> in a planter were used as the control.

Compared with artificial <b>pansies,</b> visual stimulation with real flowers resulted in a significant decrease in the ratio of low- to high-frequency heart rate variability component, which reflects sympathetic nerve activity. In contrast, high frequency, which reflects parasympathetic nerve activity, showed no significant difference.
