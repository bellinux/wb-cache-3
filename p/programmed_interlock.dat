40|$|OBJECTIVES: This {{investigation}} {{sought to}} test {{the effectiveness of a}} statewide ignition <b>interlock</b> license restriction <b>program</b> for drivers with multiple alcohol-related traffic offenses. METHODS: A total of 1387 multiple offenders eligible for license reinstatement were randomly assigned to participate in an ignition <b>interlock</b> <b>program</b> (experimental group) or in the conventional postlicensing treatment program (control group). The arrest rates of these 2 groups for alcohol traffic offenses were compared for 1 year during the ignition <b>interlock</b> license restriction <b>program</b> and for 1 year after unrestricted driving privileges were returned. RESULTS: Participation in the <b>interlock</b> <b>program</b> reduced offenders' risk of committing an alcohol traffic violation within the first year by about 65 %. The alcohol traffic violation rate during the first year was significantly less for participants in the <b>interlock</b> <b>program</b> (2. 4 %) than for those in the control group (6. 7 %). However, there was no statistically significant difference between these groups in the second year, after the interlock license restriction was lifted. CONCLUSIONS: Ignition <b>interlock</b> license restriction <b>programs</b> are effective at reducing recidivism among drivers with multiple alcohol offenses, at least while the restriction is in effect...|$|R

40|$|On February 12, 2001, {{the first}} Australian Alcohol Ignition <b>Interlock</b> <b>Program</b> to be {{administered}} through the judicial system was launched in Queensland. Previous government trials {{of the use of}} Interlocks have been undertaken in South Australia and New South Wales and focused, primarily, on administration and technical issues to determine the viability of interlocks as a sentencing option. To date, South Australia is the only state that has Interlock-specific legislation while Victoria is currently drafting such legislation. The preferred program model in both states involves the transport authority as the entity responsible for program delivery/regulation. In Queensland, the <b>Interlock</b> <b>Program</b> forms part of a probation order offered to repeat (drink-driving) offenders. Framed within existing provisions in the Penalties and Sentences Act 1992, the Interlock probation order (referred to as Under the Limit 2) has two components. The order requires the offender to (a) undertake a drink driving education course (Under the Limit) during the period of licence suspension and, on re-licensing, (b) drive only an Interlock-fitted vehicle {{for a period of time}} specified by the Magistrate. The Queensland <b>Interlock</b> <b>program</b> is a secondary prevention measure combining both a Case Management and a driver control approach. The Case Management component (involving Under the Limit and Community Corrections supervision) seeks to address offending attitudes and behaviour while the Interlock component operates as a control on driving behaviour. In addition, the Interlock component provides the offender with an opportunity to apply insights and strategies gained from the Under the Limit course to the driving context. Initially, the Queensland Program is restricted to specific courts in the greater Brisbane area while it is subject to a three-year process and outcome evaluation study conducted by Queensland University of Technology’s Centre for Accident Research and Road Safety (CARRS-Q). Thus, Magistrates in certain South-East Queensland courts now have, in addition to the usual penalties of fines, license suspension and imprisonment, an additional option when sentencing a drink-driving offender. To come this far in the implementation of a judicial <b>Interlock</b> <b>Program,</b> CARRS-Q has worked closely for over two years with a multi-sectoral team to develop the necessary frameworks and protocols. The team has included Dräger Australia Pty Ltd and the Motor Accident Insurance Commission as industry partners, a number of government agencies and statutory bodies (including Corrections, Transport, Police, Justice and Attorney General) and a peak motoring consumer body (RACQ). The breadth of collaboration reflects the scope of issues that need to be addressed in developing and implementing an <b>Interlock</b> <b>Program...</b>|$|R

40|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{significant}} limit {{on the effectiveness of}} vehicle interlocks is the failure of current programs to motivate more than a small fraction of eligible offenders to enroll in an <b>interlock</b> <b>program.</b> A major factor in that problem is the ability of offenders to deny that they own a vehicle. This paper discusses a method for providing an alternate control system that, being less desirable for the offender, should increase the proportion of convicted impaired drivers in <b>interlock</b> <b>programs.</b> Driving-while-suspended (DWS) is a major factor in limiting the effectiveness of license revocation on the impaired driving of motorists convicted of driving-under-the-influence (DUI) (DeYoung, Peck, & Helander, 1997). Installing an alcohol interlock on the vehicle of DUI offenders substantially reduces recidivism by 50 % or more while it is installed on the vehicle (Willis, Lybrand, & Bellamy, 2004). Offenders resist the installation of such units, however, preferring to risk driving while suspended (Voas, 2001). Consequently, the criminal justice system has been unable to motivate more than about 10 % of first and multiple DUI offenders eligible for the interlock to install the units (Voas & Marques, 2003). A major factor in the court...|$|R

40|$|As {{more and}} more courses are being offered online, the most {{critical}} issues facing educators include identifying how to increase the educational value of online courses and how to enhance instruction. While researchers have long investigated and developed best practices for classroom-based instruction, much less is known about how to best deliver instruction via the Internet (Kozma, 1999).

As a result the expected thesis outcomes were downgraded; the new outcomes were to conduct a design review and complete the physical wiring on the UWS. Electrical design is now complete and eighty percent of the wiring was completed during the thesis project. Wiring still needs to be run from the cabinet to the field devices. Further work is still required to commission the UWS and three software programs need to be developed in future, these include an <b>interlock</b> <b>program,</b> a client program and a demonstration program.

40|$|In 1970, SWOV started {{periodic}} nationwide roadside surveys {{aimed at}} assessing the BAC distribution of Dutch motorists during weekend nights. The goal of these surveys {{was to get}} an insight in drink driving patterns, thus enabling policy makers to take drink driving countermeasures and to evaluate their effects. Between 1970 and 2000, the percentage of drivers with an illegal BAC (> 0. 5 Â g/l) dropped from 15 % to 4. 5 %. The most important factor of influence was deemed to be the introduction of random breath testing in the mid- 1980 s. Also, a recent case-control study indicated that approximately 25 % of serious road injuries in the Netherlands {{was associated with the}} use of alcohol. Drivers with a BAC above 1. 3 Â g/l, who formed only 0. 3 % of all drivers and 20 % of drivers with an illegal BAC, caused more than 80 % of these injuries. Young male drivers, aged 18 - 24 Â years, were another high-risk group. While forming less than 5 % of the Dutch population, they caused nearly a quarter of all alcohol-related serious road injuries. Existing legislation and programs were neither very effective in further decreasing the number of hardcore drinking drivers nor in improving the drink driving habits of young males.

40|$|The {{combination}} {{of alcohol and}} driving is a major health and economic burden to the community. Drink driving remains {{a serious threat to}} public safety that results in injuries, fatalities and property damage. An array of rehabilitative and vehicle-based sanctions are currently being implemented around the world in an attempt to reduce the prevalence of convicted drink drivers continuing to re-offend after being sanctioned. One type of vehicle-based sanction that is becoming increasingly used in a number of jurisdictions to reduce recidivist drink driving is the breath alcohol ignition interlock device (interlock). Interlocks have been commercially available to road users for over ten years. In 2001, approximately 65, 000 interlocks were in use in the United States with 38 North American States having enacted interlock legislation. In Australia, interlocks were initially viewed with considerable enthusiasm by the relevant experts [1] and national standards were established for both the device and the model for implementation [2]. The Australian standard was revised in 1993 and there are now several manufacturers producing interlocks that meet that standard. For a variety of reasons the standards did not simplify or facilitate the development of research into <b>interlock</b> <b>programs</b> in an Australian legal setting so that it wasn’t until the Queensland trial 1 commenced in 2001 that court-based implementation was introduced.

40|$|Background: Cell {{survival}} and development are orchestrated by complex <b>interlocking</b> <b>programs</b> of gene activation and repression. Understanding how this gene regulatory network (GRN) functions in normal states, and is altered in cancers subtypes, offers fundamental insight into oncogenesis and disease progression, and holds great promise for guiding clinical decisions. Inferring a GRN from empirical microarray gene expression data is a challenging task in cancer systems biology. In recent years, module-based approaches for GRN inference {{have been proposed}} to address this challenge. Despite the demonstrated success of module-based approaches in uncovering biologically meaningful regulatory interactions, their application remains limited a single condition, without supporting the comparison of multiple disease subtypes/conditions. Also, their use remains unnecessarily restricted to computational biologists, as accurate inference of modules and their regulators requires integration of diverse tools and heterogeneous data sources, which in turn requires scripting skills, data infrastructure and powerful computational facilities. New analytical frameworks are required to make module-based GRN inference approach more generally useful to the research community. Results: We present the RMaNI (Regulatory Module Network Inference) framework, which supports cancer subtype-specific or condition specific GRN inference and differential network analysis. It combines both transcriptomic as well as genomic data sources, and integrates heterogeneous knowledge resources {{and a set of}} complementary bioinformatic methods for automated inference of modules, their condition specific regulators and facilitates downstream network analyses and data visualization. To demonstrate its utility, we applied RMaNI to a hepatocellular microarray data containing normal and three disease conditions.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{primarily}} concerned with the programmer's model of a shared memory system and its implications on hardware design and performance. A model for correct behavior of programs commonly (and often implicitly) assumed by programmers is that of sequential consistency, formally defined by Lamport [Lam 79] as follows: [A system is sequentially consistent if] the result of any execution {{is the same as}} if the operations of all the processors were executed in some sequential order, and the operations of each individual processor appear in this sequence in the order specified by its program. While the definition leaves the specific interpretation of the term operations undefined, for a shared memory system, it is usually assumed to refer to memory operations or accesses (e. g., reads and writes). Thus, stated simply for a shared memory system, the above definition translates into the following two conditions - (1) all memory accesses appear to execute atomically in some total order, and (2) all memory accesses of a single process appear to execute in program order. Uniprocessor systems offer the model of sequential consistency almost naturally and without much compromise in performance. In the simplest of architectures, where a processor is allowed to issue a memory access only after the previous access in program order is complete, a total order of memory accesses can be obtained based on the wall-clock time of their issue or execution. More sophisticated architectures allow overlap of instruction execution, out-of-order memory accesses, write buffers, caches (which may be lock-up free [Kro 81]), etc. In these machines, an ordering of memory accesses based on wall-clock time of issue or execution may violate <b>program</b> order, but <b>interlock</b> logic assures that accesses appear [...] ...|$|R

This thesis examines the making of seven spatial sound design projects in diverse milieux and an eighth project - {{the establishment of an}} electroacoustic studio within a school of architecture and design. The projects and the studio are considered models for the ways in which electroacoustic practices might advance the auditory spatial awareness of students and researchers in the academy, and the general community through an <b>interlocking</b> <b>program</b> of teaching, research and events. The creation of the projects and establishment of the studios also articulate a transformation in my own practice from composer to design researcher. Five of the projects are intended to engender in listeners a greater awareness of the acoustic environment and the auditory spatial qualities of those environments, which listeners daily inhabit. Supporting these project studies is a discussion on issues and conditions of making and materials to elucidate my approach to creating spatial sound designs in diverse milieux. Two of the projects investigated the auditory spatial awareness of different communities in Melbourne, with the view of establishing ideas about the auditory culture and the actual environments of that experience. The final project is a facility to house a community of practitioners who aspire to privilege the auditory design and experience of space, through a series of research, teaching and performance activities. While evaluating just how my practice transformed {{over the course of the}} projects, I also propose that the combination of the Studio&# 039;s main elements is critical to the advancement of sound-based research and design as a design discipline.
