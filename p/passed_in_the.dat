McCreary created executive departments to oversee state banking and highways, and a bipartisan vote in the General Assembly established the Kentucky Public Service Commission. Near the close of the session, McCreary County was created and named in the governor's honor. It was the last of Kentucky's 120 counties to be constituted.|$|E

5|$|Beshear called another special {{legislative}} session in June 2009 to address another $1 billion shortfall {{in the state}} budget. Later, Beshear amended the call to include the economic incentives package that was not approved during the regular session and, in light of Attorney General Conway's opinion on video lottery terminals, a measure to expand gambling in the state by statute. With the threshold lowered from 60 votes {{for a constitutional amendment}} to 51 votes for a statute, the House of Representatives passed the expanded gambling bill, but the measure died in the Republican-dominated Senate Appropriations and Revenue Committee by a 10–5 vote. The amended budget and the economic incentives bills both <b>passed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 10-day session.|$|E
5|$|Bill C-10 (previously Bill C-33), among a {{long list}} of minor changes to tax law {{contained}} a controversial clause that would give the government power to deny taxation benefits for films made in Canada if the government deems the content to be objectionable. David Cronenberg and Sarah Polley argued it is equivalent to censorship because most Canadian films cannot afford to be produced without government assistance. The Bill was <b>passed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> House October 29, 2007, but opposition parties later said that they did not notice the controversial part and several Senators have said that they intend to send the Bill back to the House.|$|E
5|$|Hearings in {{both the}} U.S. Senate and the House {{continued}} through the summer of 1973 on both new bills and amendments to the Mineral Leasing Act. On July 13, an amendment calling for more study of the project—the Mondale-Bayh Amendment—was defeated. This was followed by another victory for pipeline proponents when an amendment by Alaska Sen. Mike Gravel {{was passed by the}} Senate. The amendment declared that the pipeline project fulfilled all aspects of NEPA and modified the Mineral Leasing Act to allow the larger right-of-way for the Alaska pipeline. Upon reconsideration, the vote was tied at 49–49 and required the vote of vice president Spiro Agnew, who supported the amendment. A similar amendment was <b>passed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> House on August 2.|$|E

Faith is an area where Georgia Democrats differ from the national party. The bill <b>passed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> State Senate by a 50–1 margin on February 3, and it eventually became law.|$|E
5|$|In his {{biennial}} {{message to}} the legislature in 1910, Willson called for a uniform system of accounting based on legislation recently <b>passed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> neighboring state of Indiana. He also advocated a measure requiring full disclosure of campaign expenditures. Due to its hostility toward Willson, the Assembly scarcely considered the governor's agenda or other needed legislation such as tax reform and redistricting. The reforms Willson advocated would later pass under a Democratic administration. The few accomplishments of this legislature included making electrocution the legal form of capital punishment and establishing of an eight-hour work day for public workers.|$|E

5|$|Jones' top {{priority}} as governor was {{the passage of}} health care reform. He appointed two health care reform study commissions, and in May 1993, he called the legislature into a special session to consider a universal health care bill. The only measure {{to come out of}} this session was a temporary tax on health care providers. Legislators also agreed to work toward a bill that could be <b>passed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> next regular legislative session. On March 2, 1994, the Kentucky House of Representatives passed a health care reform bill that did not include universal coverage. Angered, Jones began campaigning against the bill, but the Kentucky Senate passed its version on March 22.|$|E
5|$|On December 9, 1824, the Senate {{voted to}} repeal the law that had {{established}} the Court of Appeals and {{to establish a new}} Court of Appeals with four justices. The measure came to the House floor on December 23. During the debate, Governor Desha personally lobbied legislators to support the measure, a blatant violation of the rules of the House. The next day the measure <b>passed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> House by a vote of 5443. Governor Desha appointed pro-relief stalwart William T. Barry as Chief Justice, and three associate justices who were also Relief Party supporters.|$|E
5|$|Relational or Debriefing (Polish: relacyjne) sejmiks {{heard the}} reports of deputies {{returned}} from the General Sejm, usually presenting the law (konstytucje sejmowe) decreed by the Sejm.

Such sejmiks could also receive special requests from the king; this happened if the sejmik deputy was bound by instructions not to vote on certain issues that subsequently were voted on and <b>passed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> national sejm. In such cases the king would request the sejmik to reconsider their decision and support the national legislation. These sejmiks arose in the 16th century.|$|E
