500|$|... "Don't <b>Pass</b> <b>Me</b> By" [...] was Starr's {{first solo}} {{composition}} for the band; {{he had been}} toying {{with the idea of}} writing a self-reflective song for some time, possibly as far back as 1963. It went by the working titles of [...] "Ringo's Tune" [...] and [...] "This Is Some Friendly". The basic track consisted of Starr drumming while McCartney played piano. Martin composed an orchestral introduction to the song but it was rejected as being [...] "too bizarre" [...] and left off the album. Instead, Jack Fallon played a bluegrass fiddle part.|$|E
500|$|Richard Starkey, [...] (born 7 July 1940), known professionally as Ringo Starr, is an English drummer, singer, {{songwriter}} {{and actor}} who gained worldwide fame as the drummer for the Beatles. He occasionally sang lead vocals, usually for one song on an album, including [...] "With a Little Help from My Friends", [...] "Yellow Submarine", [...] "Good Night", and their cover of [...] "Act Naturally". He also wrote the Beatles' songs [...] "Don't <b>Pass</b> <b>Me</b> By" [...] and [...] "Octopus's Garden", and is credited as a co-writer of others, including [...] "What Goes On" [...] and [...] "Flying".|$|E

500|$|Starr is {{credited}} {{as the sole}} composer of two Beatles songs: [...] "Octopus's Garden" [...] and [...] "Don't <b>Pass</b> <b>Me</b> By". Starr {{is credited}} as a co-writer of [...] "What Goes On", [...] "Flying" [...] and [...] "Dig It". On material issued after the break-up, Starr received a writing credit for [...] "Taking a Trip to Carolina" [...] and received joint songwriting credits with the other three Beatles for [...] "12-Bar Original", [...] "Los Paranoias", [...] "Christmas Time (Is Here Again)", [...] "Suzy Parker", heard in the Let It Be film, and [...] "Jessie's Dream" [...] from the Magical Mystery Tour film.|$|E
500|$|Record Mirror {{remarked that}} the birdsong effects of [...] "Blackbird" [...] were {{replaced}} by [...] "snorts and grunts" [...] on [...] "Piggies", which the reviewer described as [...] "a society beef (or pork if you like)" [...] {{in the style of}} folk singer Roy Harper. Writing in Rolling Stone, Jann Wenner considered the song to be [...] "an amazing choice to follow 'Blackbird'", given the contrast between the two pieces – [...] "'Blackbird' so encouraging, 'Piggies' so smug (though accurate: 'what they need's a damn good whacking'). Ha!" [...] Wenner paired it with Starr's [...] "Don't <b>Pass</b> <b>Me</b> By", as lesser songs beside the [...] "superb numbers" [...] found elsewhere on the album, but added that [...] "on their own, they're totally groovy." ...|$|E
500|$|Pop culture author Robert Rodriguez {{describes}} [...] "Sunshine Life for Me" [...] as a song [...] "custom-crafted" [...] for Starr, who {{had previously}} demonstrated an affiliation for country music in his White Album composition [...] "Don't <b>Pass</b> <b>Me</b> By" [...] and in his 1970 country album Beaucoups of Blues, which he recorded in Nashville with producer Pete Drake. Harrison recalls in I, Me, Mine that it was [...] "a fun session and a good track". Both avowed fans of the group since the late 1960s, Starr and Harrison recorded with the Band {{for the first time}} on [...] "Sunshine Life for Me". In Starr's case, the association continued with his appearance at the Last Waltz in November 1976 and subsequent live performances with Helm and Danko in 1989.|$|E

500|$|Harrison created Harrisongs to {{represent}} his Beatles compositions, but signed {{a three-year contract}} with Northern Songs that gave it the copyright to his work through March 1968, which included [...] "Taxman" [...] and [...] "Within You Without You". The songs on which Starr received co-writing credit before 1968, such as [...] "What Goes On" [...] and [...] "Flying", were also Northern Songs copyrights. Harrison did not renew his contract with Northern Songs when it ended, signing instead with Apple Publishing while retaining the copyright to his work from that point on. Harrisongs thus owns the rights to his later Beatles songs such as [...] "While My Guitar Gently Weeps" [...] and [...] "Something". That year, as well, Starr created Startling Music, which holds the rights to his Beatles compositions, [...] "Don't <b>Pass</b> <b>Me</b> By" [...] and [...] "Octopus's Garden".|$|E
500|$|In November, it was {{announced}} that the band had signed a joint-venture deal with London-based indie label Cooking Vinyl. As part of the deal, the band would retain creative control over its artistic direction, with the band and label sharing profits equally after the label recouped costs associated with marketing, promotion and distribution. Ginger Fish, the band's drummer since 1995, quit in February 2011, explaining that he [...] "decided to step down as a member of Marilyn Manson and see where my life, and the knowledge of my availability cares to take me. I can't stand by to watch opportunities <b>pass</b> <b>me</b> by simply because the knowledge of my availability wasn't clearly expressed by me." [...] By the end of the year, Vrenna had also departed the group, to focus on other production work, whilst indicating that the band's eighth studio album was [...] "largely completed".|$|E
500|$|Author Dominic Pedler {{describes}} {{the way they}} crossed musical styles: [...] "Far from moving sequentially from one genre to another (as is sometimes conveniently suggested) the group maintained in parallel their mastery of the traditional, catchy chart hit while simultaneously forging rock and dabbling {{with a wide range}} of peripheral influences from country to vaudeville. One of these threads was their take on folk music, which would form such essential groundwork for their later collisions with Indian music and philosophy." [...] As the personal relationships between the band members grew increasingly strained, their individual tastes became more apparent. The minimalistic cover artwork for the White Album contrasted with the complexity and diversity of its music, which encompassed Lennon's [...] "Revolution 9" [...] (whose musique concrète approach was influenced by Yoko Ono), Starr's country song [...] "Don't <b>Pass</b> <b>Me</b> By", Harrison's rock ballad [...] "While My Guitar Gently Weeps", and the [...] " [...] roar" [...] of McCartney's [...] "Helter Skelter".|$|E

500|$|Starr sang lead vocals {{for a song}} {{on most of the}} Beatles' studio albums as part of {{an attempt}} to {{establish}} a vocal personality for each band member. In many cases, Lennon or McCartney wrote the lyrics and melody especially for him, as they did for [...] "Yellow Submarine" [...] from Revolver and [...] "With a Little Help from My Friends" [...] on Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. These melodies were tailored to Starr's limited baritone vocal range. Because of his distinctive voice, Starr rarely performed backing vocals during his time with the Beatles, but they can be heard on songs such as [...] "Maxwell's Silver Hammer" [...] and [...] "Carry That Weight". He is also the lead vocalist on his compositions [...] "Don't <b>Pass</b> <b>Me</b> By" [...] and [...] "Octopus's Garden". In addition, he sang lead on [...] "I Wanna Be Your Man", [...] "Boys", [...] "Matchbox", [...] "Honey Don't", [...] "Act Naturally", [...] "Good Night" [...] and [...] "What Goes On".|$|E
500|$|Chamberlain thanked his teammates. [...] "It wouldn't {{even have}} been close to {{possible}} without them. They wanted me to get it as much I did." [...] He added, [...] "They had {{to do more than}} just give up open shots. They had to avoid fouls and <b>pass</b> <b>me</b> the ball in traffic." [...] Knicks' player Richie Guerin felt the Warriors broke a code of honor in sports by embarrassing an opponent and setting a record outside the normal flow of the game. Although effusive in his praise of Chamberlain, Guerin nonetheless estimated that if the game had played out normally, Chamberlain would have finished 15 to 20 points shy of 100. Chamberlain countered he could have scored 140 if the Knicks [...] "had played straight-up basketball." [...] New York coach Eddie Donovan suggested, [...] "The game was a farce. They would foul us and we would foul them." [...] The Knicks' Naulls stated, [...] "The game was not a fluke ... I thought it was absolutely authentic." [...] Imhoff said Zinkoff's announcements did not help the Knicks' cause.|$|E
500|$|Donovan taught Lennon {{a guitar}} finger-picking {{technique}} that he {{passed on to}} Harrison. The technique was subsequently implemented by Lennon on the Beatles songs [...] "Julia" [...] and [...] "Dear Prudence". The latter was composed by Lennon to lure Prudence Farrow out of her intense meditation. Lennon later said: [...] "She'd been locked in for three weeks {{and was trying to}} reach God quicker than anyone else". Another inspiration was hearing for the first time Bob Dylan's newly released album, John Wesley Harding. The stay at the ashram {{turned out to be one}} of the group's most creative periods. According to Lennon he wrote some of the [...] "most miserable" [...] and some of his [...] "best songs" [...] while he was in Rishikesh. Both Lennon and McCartney often spent time composing rather than meditating, and even Starr wrote a song, [...] "Don't <b>Pass</b> <b>Me</b> By", which was his first solo composition. Plans were made for a concert in Delhi to feature the Beatles, the Beach Boys, Donovan, and Paul Horn. Harrison complained that more time should be spent on meditating, saying, [...] "We're not here to talk about music. We're here to meditate." [...] Lennon commented on Harrison's commitment to meditation by saying: [...] "The way George [...] is going, he'll be flying a magic carpet by the time he's forty." ...|$|E

500|$|In February 1968, Starr {{became the}} first Beatle to sing on another artist's show without the other three present. He sang the Buck Owens hit [...] "Act Naturally", and {{performed}} a duet with Cilla Black, [...] "Do You Like Me Just a Little Bit?" [...] on her BBC One television programme, Cilla. Later that year Apple Records released The Beatles, {{commonly known as the}} [...] "White Album". Creative inspiration for the double LP came in part from the band's recent interactions with the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. While attending an intermediate course at his ashram in Rishikesh, India, they enjoyed one of their most prolific writing periods, composing most of the album's songs there. Starr left after 10 days, but completed his first recorded Beatles song, [...] "Don't <b>Pass</b> <b>Me</b> By". During the recording of the White Album, relations within the band became openly divisive. As the sessions progressed, their collective group dynamic began to decay; at times only one or two Beatles were involved in the recording for a track. Starr had grown weary of McCartney's increasingly overbearing approach and Lennon's passive-aggressive behaviour, which was exacerbated by Starr's resentment of Yoko Ono near-constant presence. After one particularly difficult session during which McCartney had harshly criticised his drumming, Starr quit the band for two weeks, taking a holiday with his family in Sardinia on a boat loaned by Peter Sellers. During a lunch break the chef served octopus, which Starr refused to eat. A subsequent conversation with the ship's captain regarding the behaviours of the animal served as the inspiration for his Abbey Road composition, [...] "Octopus's Garden", which Starr wrote on guitar during the trip. He returned to the studio two weeks later, to find that Harrison had covered his drum kit in flowers as a welcome-back gesture.|$|E
