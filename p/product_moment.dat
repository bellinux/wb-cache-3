For example a task that is only 1 day long is unlikely to affect the project finish but it can still have a 100% Criticality Index.

50|$|Coefficients with {{baselines}} (conditions {{under which}} they measure 0) that cannot be interpreted in terms of reliability, i.e. have no dedicated value to indicate when the units and the values assigned to them are statistically unrelated. Simple %-agreement ranges from 0=extreme disagreement to 100=perfect agreement with chance having no definite value. As already noted, Cohens kappa falls into this category by defining the absence of reliability as the statistical independence between two individual coders. The baseline of Bennett, Alpert, and Goldstein’s S is {{defined in terms of}} the number of values available for coding, which has little to do with how values are actually used. Goodman and Kruskal’s lambdar is defined to vary between -1 and +1, leaving 0 without a particular reliability interpretation. Lin’s reproducibility or concordance coefficient rc takes Pearson’s <b>product</b> <b>moment</b> correlation rij as a measure of precision and adds to it a measure Cb of accuracy, ostensively to correct for rijs above mentioned inadequacy. It varies between -1 and +1 and the reliability interpretation of 0 is uncertain.

All cor-relation coefficients (Pearson r, Spearman rho, and Kendall tau) were markedly influenced by {{the range of the}} data, and, for the rank correlation coefficients, the effect of range varied for different data distributions. While corre-lation coefficients may be useful in assessing whether an association exists between two variables, they are not useful in assessing the degree of random error about the regression line when a strong linear association is pre-sumed to exist between the two variables. Thus, neither <b>product</b> <b>moment</b> nor rank correlation coefficients are of value in analysis of laboratory method-comparison data. The standard deviation of the residual error of regression should be calculated as a measure of the random error about the regression line.
