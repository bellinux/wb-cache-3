These specimens were naturally cooled to room temperature after being heated in an electric furnace. No explosive spalling was observed during the fire test on all HSC with PP fibers. From the results of nine types of concretes, both the compressive strength and splitting tensile strength of HSC with PP fibers decreased with the increase of temperature.

Organic-LDHs was {{prepared}} by three methods including co-precipitation, ionexchange and roast reduction process using Lauryl alcohol phosphoric acid ester potassium(MAPK) asmodifier. <b>Polypropylene(PP)</b> /Organically-modified layered double hydroxides(LDH) {{was prepared}} by the melt blending method. The structures and morphologies of composites were characterized by X-ray diffraction and TEM. TGA, cone calorimeter, limiting oxygen index(LOI) and the UL 94 protocol were used to characterize the thermal stability and fire properties of composites. The results indicate that MAPK was successfully intercalated into the interlayer of LDHs and MAPK has a different arrangement in the interlayer of organicLDHs for different preparation methods of LDHs. PP/ionexchangeorganicLDHs (PP/ion-o-LDHs) and PP/roast reductionorganicLDHs (PP/ro-o-LDHs) show a better dispersion of LDH in PP than PP/co-precipitationorganicLDHs (PP/co-o-LDHs) composites.

40|$|International audienceTSeveral {{polymers}} can {{be combined}} in one multilayer structure by reactive coextrusion. Tie-layers are often used to compatibilize adjacent layers and may reduce or suppress interfacialinstabilities and defects in multilayer coextrusion flow. However, a new additional defect defined as“grainy” defect can be observed. In our best of knowledge, no study in literature has been dedicatedto understand its origin. The phenomena are quite complex due to the coupling {{of the effects of}} flowand the physico-chemical mechanisms at the interface. The aim of this work is to understand therelationship between the instabilities and defects encountered in multilayer coextruded films and therole of the copolymer formed in-situ between tie and barrier layers. Polyamide 6 (PA 6) andethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymer (EVOH) were used as barrier layers sandwiched in <b>polypropylene(PP)</b> with or without tie-layer based on polypropylene grafted maleic anhydride (PP-g-MA). Influence of process parameters and nature of the polymer pair on the generation of “grainy” defecthas been assessed and related to the rheological and the physico-chemical properties of layers. These experiments showed that this defect appeared mainly in the compatibilized EVOH systemand could be distinguished from the usual coextrusion instabilities. Interfacial properties between tieand barrier layers have been investigated. Shear stress relaxation experiments have been carried outon reactive tie/barrier bilayers. Due to the interphase generated in-situ, the relaxation behavior wasaltered by extending the relaxation time. Investigation of interfacial morphology highlighted that thecopolymer architecture significantly affected the interface/interphase development and interfaceroughness.

40|$|The {{research}} on polymer - carbon nanotube(CNT) composites represents {{a rapidly growing}} research area. The number of publications on this subject is rapidly growing. Carbon nanotubes offers great possibilities with their outstanding physical properties. The ongoing research is focusing on the possibilities {{to make use of}} these properties in order to improve performance of bulk materials, such as polymers. In this project composites of <b>polypropylene(PP)</b> and multi walled carbon nanotubes(MWCNT) have been manufactured and characterized. PP is a common thermoplastic polymer with good physical properties and high resistancy to chemical substances. The MWCNT used in this project had a purity of > 93 %, diameters of 10 - 15 nm and lengths of > 500 nm. Characterization has been performed with respect to conductivity, relative electric permittivity, Er, and relative electric permeability, µr. The manufacturing method used contains two major steps, first an ultrasonic treatment in solvent medium is used to increase the dispersion of the nanotubes. The second part involves melt mixing and hot pressing in order to achieve composite plates to perform measurements on. Some materials have also been subject to mechanical deformation in order to investigate the possibilities to align CNT:s in material. Measurements were also performed on an epoxy-carbon nanotube composite manufactured by staff at SICOMP, Piteå. Conductivity measurements were performed with a measurement method, developed in this project, that used several measurement points on the actual specimen. This made it easier to estimate the consistency on individual measurements. Er and µr were measured using a stripline technique including the use of a special made fixture and a vector network analyzer. Measurements were performed in a frequency spectrum ranging from 1 MHz to 3 GHz. The results from the conductivity measurements clearly shows, as expected, that composites with higher content of nanotubes gets a higher electrical conductivity. A percolation threshold of around 2 - 3 wt% is noticed for the PP-MWCNT and around 0. 5 wt% for the epoxy composites. It can also be concluded {{that it is hard to}} get consistent values on materials with low conductivity, most probably due to increased and varying contact resistancies. High frequency measurements shows that Er do change with different concentrations of nanotubes. The real part of Er, also called dielectric constant, increases with rising concentration meaning that the materials ability to store charges is increased. The complex part decreased with rising concentration meaning the rate of energy absorbed when applied to an electric field is increased. No changes could be detected for the µr parameter.
