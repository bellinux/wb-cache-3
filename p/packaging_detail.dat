However, omitting important aspects of <b>package</b> <b>details</b> in a thermal model can result in significant temperature estimation errors. In this paper, we discuss the applications of an existing compact thermal model that models both die and <b>package</b> temperature <b>details.</b> As an example, a thermally selfconsistent leakage power calculation of a POWER 4 -like microprocessor design is presented. We then demonstrate the importance of including <b>detailed</b> <b>package</b> information in the thermal model by several examples considering the impact of thermal interface material (TIM), which glues the die to the heat spreader. The fact that <b>detailed</b> <b>package</b> information is needed to build an accurate compact thermal model implies a design flow, in which the chip- and package-level compact thermal model acts as a convenient medium for more productive collaborations among circuit designers, computer architects and package designers, leading to early and efficient evaluations of different design tradeoffs for an optimal design from a thermal point of view.
