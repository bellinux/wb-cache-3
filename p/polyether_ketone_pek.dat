40|$|The {{synthesis}} of a soluble <b>poly(ether</b> <b>ketone)</b> (<b>PEK)</b> precursor via a ketimine route is described. The synthesis is realized {{by using a}} halogenophenol monomer, i. e. N-(4 -fluoro- 4 '-hydroxydiphenylmethylene) imine. First we describe the {{synthesis of}} the monomer and its characterization by infra-red and C- 13 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopies. Subsequently, the polymerization of the monomer is reported and the factors influencing the polymerization reaction are considered. The ketimine PEK prepolymer is soluble in common organic solvents. The rate of the ketimine PEK condensation is decreased {{compared with that of}} the equivalent ketimine poly(ether ether ketone) condensation due to the deactivation of the reactive intermediate (Meisenheimer's complex). The poly(ether ketimine) can be readily hydrolysed to the poly(ether ketone). Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Customized {{engineered}} fibers {{are currently}} being used extensively in the aerospace and automobile industries due {{to the ability to}} "design in" specific engineering characteristics. Understanding the thermal conductivity of these new fibers is critical for thermal management and design optimization. In the current investigation, a steady-state dc thermal bridge method (DCTBM) is developed to measure the thermal conductivity of individual <b>poly(ether</b> <b>ketone)</b> (<b>PEK)</b> /carbon nanotube (CNT) fibers. For non-conductive fibers, a thin platinum layer was deposited on the test articles to serve as the heater and temperature sensor. The effect of the platinum layer on the thermal conductivity is presented and discussed. DCTBM is first validated using gold and platinum wires (25 mu m in diameter) over a temperature ranging from room temperature to 400 K with +/- 11 % uncertainty, and then applied to PEK/CNT fibers with diverse CNT loadings. At a 28 wt. % CNT loading, the thermal conductivity of fibers at 390 K is over 27 Wm(- 1) K- 1, which is comparable to some engineering alloys. open 6...|$|E

Carbon nanofibers (CNF), few-walled carbon nanotubes (FWNT), and multi-walled nanotubes (MWNT) have been utilized as nanofillers, with few-walled carbon nanotube loadings as high as 28 wt%. The interfacial strength of the PEK/FWNT and PEK/MWNT fibers were evaluated through the monitoring of the G-mode Raman peak shift {{as a function of}} fiber strain. Interfacial shear strengths as high as 14. 2 MPa were measured for the PEK/FWNT fiber with 28 wt% CNT loading, a 1320 % increase as compared to the PEK/MWNT fiber with 5 wt% loading (1. 0 MPa). Tg of the PEK/FWNT fibers increased by 19 °C as the FWNT loading was increased from 5 wt% to 28 wt%. A second peak in the tan δ behavior of all PEK/CNT fibers was also observed. This second tan δ peak (T ∼ 240 °C&# 8211; 250 °C) is attributed to the α*-transition (crystal-crystal slip) in the PEK crystalline regions, and its presence is more pronounced (higher magnitude of tan δ) in all PEK/FWNT fibers as compared to PEK/MWNT and PEK/CNF fibers. FWNTs are restricting the mobility of the amorphous PEK as evidenced by the increasing Tg. Enhanced PEK crystal-crystal slip corresponds to increasing large scale chain mobility in the crystalline regions of the PEK at Tα*. We propose a model which correlates the increase in PEK-FWNT interfacial shear strength to an increase in large scale chain mobility where crystal-crystal slip precedes failure of PEK/CNT interface at Tα* for the PEK/FWNT fibers...|$|E
40|$|Hyperbranched <b>poly(ether</b> <b>ketone)</b> s (<b>PEK's)</b> were {{synthesized}} via A 3 + B 2 polymerization approach without forming cross-linked products, {{because the}} polymer-forming process based on Friedel-Crafts reaction was kinetically {{controlled by the}} solubility difference of monomers in the viscous hydrophilic reaction medium, poly(phosphoric acid) (PPA) /phosphorus pentoxide (P 2 O 5). The hydrophilic trimesic acid as an A 3 monomer is soluble in the reaction medium, while hydrophobic diphenyl ether and 1, 4 -diphenoxybenzene as B 2 monomers are marginally soluble. It is hypothesized that the gelation was avoided because of the following two factors: (i) self-regulated feeding of the arylether monomers into the system driven by their poor solubility and phase separation from PPA/P 2 O 5 medium; (ii) reaction-medium- induced isolation of growing macromolecules promoted by the high bulk viscosity. Both polymerization experiments based on equimolar or equifunctional stoichiometry (A 3 : B 2) resulted in completely soluble hyperbranched PEK's in polar aprotic solvents when these polymers contained a little amount of solvent residues and only in strong acids if they were rigorously dried.

The feed ratios of A 3 and B 2 monomers vary from 3 : 2 to 1 : 2 in the A 3 + B 2 polycondensations. The polymerization was carried out in a mildly acidic medium, i. e., poly-(phosphoric acid) or PPA, with an optimized amount of phosphorus pentoxide (P 2 O 5) added. The overall evidence based on the data of elemental analysis (EA), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) implicates that hyperbranched PEK's were attached to the surface of MWNT to form hyperbranched PEK-g-MWNT nanocomposites. Furthermore, MWNT remained structurally intact under the polymerization and workup conditions. Evidently driven by the molecular architecture of globular hyperbranched polymers, the morphology of the nanocomposites resembles "mushroom-like clusters on MWNT stalks". The hyperbranched PEK-g-MWNT nanocomposites were soluble in polar aprotic solvents stemming from numerous carboxylic acids on their surfaces. When some of samples were dispersed in 1 M LiOH aqueous solutions, they formed very stable suspensions.
