500|$|The case {{provided}} {{the basis for}} other challenges to restrictions imposed on LSC, such as bans against lobbying or class action. These challenges were rejected by the Ninth Circuit and the Second Circuit in separate suits. The challenges failed because the relevant provisions do not regulate a specific type of advocacy; for example, the restriction on LSC grantees from collecting attorney's fees would not raise a speech issue because there is no speech involved in such a process. The argument raised in these challenges was that the Court articulated a new [...] "conditions" [...] principle in Velazquez—a distortion-of-speech test—which, they argued, would require the restrictions to be struck down. Both courts of appeal reviewing this claim have rejected this reading of Velazquez. Instead of a distortion-of-speech test, the decision was based on the application of limited public forum principles: when the government provides funds to an entity, and this <b>funding's</b> purpose was <b>to</b> encourage a diversity of private views, it must act in a viewpoint-neutral way.

Encroachment of drainage canals by the inhabitants and sand bar formation at the mouth of the lagoon had caused serious flood problems in the catchment during rainy season. Lunawa Environment Improvement and Community Development Project which is being implemented with JICA <b>fundings</b> helps <b>to</b> convert the polluted Lunawa Lake from an eyesore to an environmentally attractive lake and alleviates flood damage through an improved storm water drainage system. Apart from the engineering works, series of community upgrading activities have also been carried out to uplift the quality of life of the low-income inhabitants of the catchment. The maintenance of the improved lake system is of prime importance for sustainability of the project. The water quality monitoring reveals the signs of gradual transformation of the polluted lake into a more acceptable water body and this is more so evident by the emerging aquatic life and flocking of birds in the lake.

40|$|The European {{energy policy}} aims at {{reaching}} {{the target of}} quasi-zero energy buildings for new constructions in 2020, member states are also asked to set new energy requirements for existent buildings. Historic architecture has always been dispensed with the fulfilment of energy requirements but by the rising price of energy, historic residential buildings of urbanised areas will {{be more and more}} characterised by high running cost and low comfort standards if compared to newer building estate. If within a city the contribution of historic areas and city centres on the general energy demand for heating, domestic hot water, electricity and on CO 2 emissions is reduced, in the case of small historic towns as Montieri the situation is reversed because the extension of the historic or cultural area almost corresponds to the whole built environment, therefore the contribution of these areas to the general urban energy balance is relevant. Therefore in small historic towns, in order to keep acceptable living standards and affordable running cost of buildings and to avoid phenomena of abandonment, facing the issue of energy saving also on historic architecture {{is becoming more and more}} relevant. The urban dimension of a small historic town presents several strengths for the application of urban energy policies: compact shape and the reduced number of buildings simplify the collection of information needed for and accurate description of cultural value of the built environment and of energy behaviour of buildings direct relationship with the surrounding natural environment enhances the exploitation of local renewable energy resources for sustainable management of the energy demand through and the integration of passive systems for improving indoor comfort of buildings the presence of a small community made up of few inhabitants allows a major cooperation with local administration in the design and implementation of refurbishment actions at village scale. The research gives a contribution on this topic trying to mediate between energy efficiency requirements and the respect of cultural value of architecture by proposing a cautious and accurate procedure to set achievable targets of reduction of buildings' energy demand at urban scale. Principles from the discipline of building renovation and methods for the assessment and improvement of energy performances of urban building stocks are crossed to define a repeatable procedure for setting reliable strategies of retrofit interventions on historic areas. The tool implemented is the matrix of transformability that classifies the built environment according to the historic character of buildings and to those features that influence building energetic behaviour. The aim is to subdivide the urban fabric in classes characterised by similar suitable possibility of transformation. The procedure becomes an important tool in the hand of the municipality useful to set a plan for energy retrofit actions on buildings of the village, where to each construction is assigned a reachable level of energy performance and allowed technical intervention according to the cultural character and the relationship with the urban texture. In fact the cultural value of buildings is read as limitation to the transformability of buildings and the general scenario of urban renovation takes into account the peculiarities of all building classes in the village levelling the energy efficiency target on the characteristic of local architecture. The procedure provides to homeowners and building designer a first general direction to schedule retrofit interventions according to the energy refurbishment criteria already foreseen for each building. The procedure is tested on the small historic town of Montieri where the Geothermal Communities Project has set European <b>fundings</b> <b>to</b> implement energy retrofit actions on the medieval built estate. Criteria for the choice of suitable energy retrofit technologies respectful of the cultural value of buildings are outlined and collected in a guideline document that represents the practical result of the research work since is going to be integral part of the soon to be published Public Call for energy retrofit interventions in the village of Montieri, funded by the Geothermal Communities project. In Montieri, the involvement in the European project is the hint to set a clear position on energy efficiency requirements. In the guideline document minimum standards of energy performance for building elements, characteristics of local traditional building technology, are defined and their application demonstrates to be an effective solution for controlling the architectural quality of energy retrofit projects and to extensively reduce the general energy demand for heating of the historic village. Selected case studies of each class demonstrate the achievable level of improvement of energy performances for each group of buildings. In this way the application of tailored technical solutions on individual buildings is supervised by a general control of the effects of each measure at urban scale and the evaluation of the general reduction of energy demand at urban scale due to the proposed retrofit scenario...|$|R
40|$|In Flanders (Belgium), the 1 -year Master {{programme}} in Biochemical Engineering Technology {{is organized}} at 7 geographically dispersed campuses {{that are associated}} to three different universities, i. e.

In addition, institutes of higher education are subject to intense changes: with decreasing government <b>fundings</b> they have <b>to</b> educate more students, in individual flexible programs, and with an increasing variety of backgrounds [1]. It is clear that a rationalization is required in which the use of human resources and infrastructure is optimized. This can be accomplished by establishing “Higher education consortia”, which can be defined as “multi-point groupings of higher education institutions which have a limited amount of members and where membership is restricted to particular institutions” [2]. In these so-called “Higher education consortia” there is an increased cooperation among the campuses, for instance by multi-campus education in which there is an increased exchange of lecturers and increased student mobility. In this paper we describe the development of a multi-campus programme for the Master of science in Engineering Technology: Biochemical Engineering and Master of science in bioengineering technology: food industry engineering, in a higher education consortium, consisting of 4 campuses associated to KU Leuven. The multi-campus programme consists of specialized and research-driven learning modules on one campus that are also available for students of other campuses.

40|$|In recent decades, new {{technologies}} have evolved {{so rapidly that}} the use of computers and the Internet has resulted in the appearance of a new type of genre, i. e. Cybergenre (Shepherd & Watters, 1998; Shepherd, Watters & Kennedy, 2004). The medium used by these new genres, their social role, their purpose, their audiences and kinds of skills requi red to their users differ from those of old genres, and therefore, cybergenres cannot be measured or characterized by means of the same parameters as traditional written (paper format) genres. On the other hand, some authors have described three types of “ Reading Modes ”, such as ‘Navigating’, ‘Browsing’, and ‘Reading’ (Girón - García, 2013), regarding different Internet users’ strategies. Our hypothesis is that the type of reading mode – or user strategic mode - not only has to do with types of users and their tendencies but also with the cybergenre itself, its configuration and the types of cognitive frames that it activates in users. Each particular genre activates certain metaphorical models – made apparent through metaphorical expressions – that configure the necessary paths for users to succeed in its adequate processing. In this context, our purpose here is to identify idiosyncratic metaphorical expressions that may guide the movement of the user thought texts precisely because they activate cognitive models. In turn, we provide descriptions of metaphorical models and try to explain and illustrate their coherence within particular genres. Therefore, our procedure consists firstly in selecting genres, such as on - line dictionaries and market sites, secondly ide ntifying metaphorical expressions, and finally describing the models they activate, so that we can elucidate different user strategic modes (reading modes) for each genre type. We claim that different guiding metaphors of topological character (spatial) p rompt different users’ techniques or strategies. In addition, we suggest that these metaphors provide internal coherence to the genres, as such.

40|$|The {{current work}} {{is devoted to}} {{estimating}} the term structure of interest rates based on a generalized optimization framework. To x {{the ideas of the}} subject, we introduce representations of the term structure as they are used in nance: yield curve, discount curve and forward rate curve. Yield curves are used in empirical research in nance and macroeconomic to support nancial decisions made by governments and/or private nancial institutions. When governments (or nancial corporations) need <b>fundings,</b> they issue <b>to</b> the public (i. e. the market) debt securities (bills, bonds, notes, etc) which are sold at the discount rate at the settlement date and promise the face value of the security at the redemption date, known as maturity date. Bills, notes and bonds are usually sold with maximum maturity of 1 year, 10 years and 30 years respectively. Let us assume that the government issues to the market zero-coupon bonds, which provide a single payment at maturity of each bond. To determine the price of the security at time of settlement, a single discount factor is used. Thus, the yield can be dened as the discount rate which makes the present value of the security issued (the zero-coupon bond) equal to its initial price. The yield curve describes the relationship between a particular yield and a bond's maturity. In general, given a certain number of bonds with dierent time to maturity, the yield curve will describe the one-to-one relationship between the bond yields and their corresponding time to maturity. For a realistic yield curve, it is important to use only bonds from the same class of issuer or securities having the same degree of liquidity when plotting the yields. Discount factors, used to price bonds, are functions of the time to maturity. Given that yields are positive, these functions are assumed to be monotonically decreasing as the time to maturity increases. Thus, a discount curve is simply the graph of discount factors for dierent maturities associated with dierent securities. Another useful curve uses the forward rate function which can be deduced from both the discount factor and the yield function. The forward rate is the rate of return for an investment that is agreed upon today but which starts at some time in the future and provides payment at some time in the future as well. When forward rates are used, the resulting curve {{is referred to as the}} forward rate curve. Thus, any of these curves, that is, the yield curve, the discount curve or the forward rate curve, can be used to represent what is known as the term structure of interest rate. The shapes that the term structure of interest rates can assume include upward sloping, downward sloping,  atness or humped, depending on the state of the economy. When the expectations of market participants are incorporated in the construction of these curves representing the term structure, their shapes capture and summarize the cost of credit and risks associated with every security traded. However, constructing these curves and the choice of an appropriate representation of the term structure to use is not a straightforward task. This is due to the complexity of the market data, precisely, the scarcity of zero-coupon bonds which constitutes the backbone of the term structure. The market often provides coupons alongside market security prices for a small number of maturities. This implies that, for the entire maturity spectrum, yields can not be observed on the market. Based on available market data, yields must be estimated using traditional interpolation methods. To this end, polynomial splines as well as parsimonious functions are the methods mostly used by nancial institutions and in research in nance. However, it is observed in literature that these methods suer from the shape constraints which cause them to produce yield curves that are not realistic with respect to the market observations. Precisely, the yield curves produced by these methods are characterized by unrealistic t of the market data, either in the short end or in the long end of the term structure of interest rate. To ll the gap, the current research models the yield curve using a generalized optimization framework. The method is not shape constrained, which implies that it can adapt to any shape the yield curve can take across the entire maturity spectrum. While estimating the yield curve using this method in comparison with traditional methods on the Swedish and US markets, it is shown that any other traditional method used is a special case of the generalized optimization framework. Moreover, it is shown that, for a certain market consistency, the method produces lower variances than any of the traditional methods tested. This implies that the method produces forward rate curve of higher quality compared to the existing traditional methods. Interest rate derivatives are instruments whose prices depend or are derived from the price of other instruments. Derivatives instruments that are extensively used include the forward rate agreement (FRA) contracts where forward rate is used and the interest rate swap (IRS) where LIBOR rate is used as  oating rate. These instruments will only be used to build up the term structure of interest rates. Since the liquidity crisis in 2007, it is observed that discrepancies in basis spread between interest rates applied to dierent interest rate derivatives have grown so large that a single discount curve is no longer appropriate to use for pricing securities consistently. It has been suggested that the market needs new methods for multiple yield curves estimation to price securities consistently with the market. As a response, the generalized optimization framework is extended to a multiple yield curves estimation. We show that, unlike the cubic spline for instance, which is among the mostly used traditional method, the generalized framework can produce multiple yield curves and tenor premium curves that are altogether smooth and realistic with respect to the market observations. U. S. Treasury market is, by size and importance, a leading market which is considered as benchmark for most xed-income securities that are traded worldwide. However, existing U. S. Treasury yield curves that are used in the market are of poor quality since they have been estimated by traditional interpolation methods which are shape constrained. This implies that the market prices they imply contain lots of noise and as such, are not safe to use. In this work, we use the generalized optimization framework to estimate high-quality forward rates for the U. S. Treasury yield curve. Using ecient frontiers, we show that the method can produce low pricing error with low variance as compared to the least squares methods that have been used to estimate U. S. Treasury yield curves. We nally use the high-quality U. S. Treasury forward rate curve estimated by the generalized optimization framework as input to the essentially ane model to capture the randomness property in interest rates and the time-varying term premium. This premium is simply a compensation that is required for additional risks that investors are exposed to. To determine optimal investment in the U. S. Treasury market, a two-stage stochastic programming model without recourse is proposed, which model borrowing, shorting and proportional transaction cost. It is found that the proposed model can provide growth of wealth in the long run. Moreover, its Sharpe ratio is better than the market index and its Jensen's alpha is positive. This implies that the Stochastic Programming model proposed can produce portfolios that perform better than the market index...|$|R
