5|$|Although {{a member}} of the House of Lords, until the passage of the House of Lords Act in 1999, the 10th Earl of Shaftesbury rarely attended. His maiden speech was made on 10 November 1999. At this time, Shaftesbury made an eight-minute <b>presentation</b> <b>in</b> a debate {{regarding}} arts and sport, a portion of which is presented below.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the paucity}} of {{surviving}} attributed works, {{it is difficult to}} detect any evolution in Lochner's style. Art historians are unsure if his style became progressively more or less influenced by Netherlandish art. Recent dendrochronological examination of attributed works indicate that his development was not linear, suggesting that the more advanced <b>Presentation</b> <b>in</b> the Temple is of 1445, predating the more Gothic Saints panels now divided between London and Cologne.|$|E

5|$|In December 1877, Saint-Saëns had a {{more solid}} operatic success, with Samson et Dalila, his one opera to gain and keep {{a place in the}} {{international}} repertoire. Because of its biblical subject, the composer had met many obstacles to its <b>presentation</b> <b>in</b> France, and through Liszt's influence the premiere was given at Weimar in a German translation. Although the work eventually became an international success it was not staged at the Paris Opéra until 1892.|$|E

5|$|The {{first of}} three 2012 presidential {{election}} debates took place on October 3, in Denver.

There is often a particular underlying problem that has led to the DKA episode; this may be intercurrent illness (pneumonia, influenza, gastroenteritis, a urinary tract infection), pregnancy, inadequate insulin administration (e.g. defective insulin pen device), myocardial infarction (heart attack), stroke or the use of cocaine. Young people with recurrent episodes of DKA may have an underlying eating disorder, or may be using insufficient insulin for fear that it will cause weight gain.|$|E
5|$|During {{development}} {{there was}} a concern that the game might initially seem too complicated. At {{the end of the}} videotape there is a special fifteen-minute presentation called the rules <b>presentation</b> <b>in</b> which a voice-over along with the Gatekeeper explains the game, the characters and how to play. The rules presentation was created to help explain the game to new players. The videotape can be forwarded {{to the start of the}} instructions. During the rules presentation a game is played by actors who are dressed as three Harbingers – Baron Samedi, Anne de Chantraine and Elizabeth Bathory – and three Soul Rangers. The demonstration game is used throughout the rules presentation to help explain how to play the game.|$|E
5|$|In the English-speaking world, recent {{productions}} of The Bartered Bride in London {{have included the}} Royal Opera House (ROH) <b>presentation</b> <b>in</b> 1998, staged at Sadler's Wells during {{the restoration of the}} ROH's headquarters at Covent Garden. This production in English was directed by Francesca Zambello and conducted by Bernard Haitink; it was criticised both for its stark settings and for ruining the Act II entrance of Vašek. It was nevertheless twice revived by the ROH – in 2001 and 2006, under Charles Mackerras.|$|E

5|$|Lochner's {{major works}} include three large polyptychs: the Dombild Altarpiece; the Last Judgement, which is broken apart {{and in several}} collections; and Nuremberg's Crucifixion. Only two {{attributed}} paintings are dated; the 1445 Nativity now in the Alte Pinakothek, Munich, and the <b>Presentation</b> <b>in</b> the Temple from 1447, now in Darmstadt. There is a smaller, earlier version of the presentation scene at the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, Lisbon, dated 1445. As secular works grew in demand and religious works became unfashionable in later centuries, 15th-century polyptychs were often broken up and sold as individual works, especially if a panel or section contained an image that could pass as a secular portrait.|$|E
5|$|Prem and Poonam {{go through}} the most magical and romantic period of their lives. Coming from {{different}} sensibilities, both want their relationship to be very right for each other. Both {{realize the importance of}} the engagement rings that they have given to each other and the special right that they have got on each other in return. They begin to fall in love and become attached to each other, thanks to the gentle prodding of their respective siblings. After several days, Harishchandra and his family return home to attend their business, which leaves Poonam and Prem the choice to communicate via telephone and letter. Prem joins the family business and takes on a heavy <b>presentation</b> <b>in</b> Japan. Upon returning, the family brings Poonam as a surprise and they celebrate their engagement.|$|E
5|$|After {{these changes}} were made, the test {{audience}} became more {{appreciative of the}} series, and GSN announced its development {{to the public at}} an upfront <b>presentation</b> <b>in</b> New York City on March 21, 2012 for the network's upcoming programming. By this time, a pilot episode had already been shot with American stand-up comedian and television personality Jeff Foxworthy performing the hosting duties for the show. When first asked if he was interested in hosting the show, Foxworthy was hesitant; he agreed to take on the role after learning that contestants would be playing for charity rather than on their own behalf. Casting for the series was held in various cities from May to June 2012. On July 7, 2012, GSN confirmed the show would premiere on August 23, 2012, alongside the premiere of Beat the Chefs.|$|E

5|$|NHL 17, an {{ice hockey}} {{simulation}} video game, uses the Ignite engine, created by Electronic Arts. During a game, players maneuver around the ice with normal skating and deking {{and are able}} to seamlessly pass to teammates to create scoring chances. If a player scores a goal, they are able to celebrate the way they want to; many new celebrations were added to the game. One newly added celebration was a mimicked version of baseball player José Bautista's iconic bat flip that occurred during the 2015 American League Division Series. Defensively, the player can skate their way to the puck carrier and have a chance to break up the play. The player has multiple ways of doing so; pushing the carrier off of the puck, delivering a body check, or pushing them towards the boards of the ice. If they wish, the player can enable the On-Ice Trainer, a system made to assist the player as they play. NHL 17 features game <b>presentation</b> <b>in</b> the style of the NHL on NBC, with commentary being provided by Mike Emrick (play-by-play), Eddie Olczyk (color) and Ray Ferraro (ice-side reporter), with the network's score bug appearing on-screen as well.|$|E
5|$|The {{flowers of}} B.sessilis {{have a number}} of adaptations that serve to {{encourage}} outcrossing. Firstly, they are protandrous: a flower's pollen is released around 72 hours before it becomes itself receptive to pollen, by which time around half of its pollen has lost its viability. Secondly, the period of maximum nectar production closely matches the period during which the flower is sexually active, so honeyeaters are enticed to visit at the most opportune time for pollination. This has proven an effective strategy: almost all pollen is removed within two to three hours of <b>presentation.</b> <b>In</b> addition, honeyeaters tend to move between inflorescences on different plants, rather than between inflorescences on the same plant, at least in high density sites. These factors combine to make it fairly unusual for a flower to be fertilised by its own pollen. When self-fertilisation does occur, whether autogamous or geitonogamous, the resulting seed is almost always aborted, and the species ultimately achieves an outcrossing rate of nearly 100%, at least in high density sites. Limited data for low-density sites, where honeyeaters move from plant to plant less frequently, suggest more of a mixed-mating system.|$|E
5|$|The {{transition}} from 2D graphics to 3D environments overlaid on pre-rendered backgrounds {{was accompanied by}} a focus on a more realistic <b>presentation.</b> <b>In</b> previous entries, the sizes for characters and environments were fixed, and the player saw things from a scrolling perspective. This changed with Final Fantasy VII; environments shifted with camera angles, and character model sizes shifted depending on both their place in the environment and their distance from the camera, giving a sense of scale. The choice of this highly cinematic style of storytelling, contrasting directly with Square's previous games, was attributed to Kitase, who was a fan of films and had an interest in the parallels between film and video game narrative. Character movement during in-game events was done by the character designers in the planning group. While designers normally cooperate with a motion specialist for such animations, the designers taught themselves motion work, resulting in each character's movements differing depending on their creators—some designers liked exaggerated movements, while others went for subtlety. Much of the time was spent on each character's day-to-day, routine animations. Motion specialists were brought in for the game's battle animations. The first characters the team worked with were Cloud and Barret. Some of the real-time effects, such as an explosion near the opening, were hand-drawn rather than computer animated.|$|E

5|$|The viewers' {{confused}} {{reaction to}} their story {{based on the}} first half, disappointed and frustrated Sato and Ibira. Sato explained the first two episodes were to capture the viewers' attention, and remaining episodes would reveal greater details of the story. Mania complained this franchising tactic is a poor excuse for initial episodes lacking substance. They said although the later half answered much of the questions raised in the first, it created unanswered questions of its own. IGN and DVD Talk felt the story was darker and flowed better in the later half than the first, but IGN felt the revelation of details came {{too late in the}} show. DVD Verdict felt the story was pointless. Despite the protagonist reaffirming himself as a protector of the city, his showdown with the antagonist reduced most of Shinjuku to ruins. Reviewers found if they stripped the plot to its basics, it is a shallow good-versus-evil story made complex by its <b>presentation</b> <b>in</b> the first half. They, however, appreciated the surprising deaths of certain characters whose sacrifice in vain rendered a poignant emotion at that point of story.|$|E
