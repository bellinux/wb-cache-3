It was also deemed desirable that supervised release revocations be subject to the same <b>procedural</b> <b>safeguards</b> as probation revocations. The Judicial Conference also opposed mandatory drug testing and mandatory revocation of probation and supervised release, requirements imposed by the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act.|$|E

These two cases {{held that a}} professor’s claim to entitlement must {{be more than a}} subjective expectancy of continued employment. Rather, there must be a contractual relationship or a reference in a contract to a specific tenure policy or agreement. Further, the court held that a tenured professor who is discharged from a public college has been deprived of a property interest, and so due process applies, requiring certain <b>procedural</b> <b>safeguards</b> (the right to personally appear in a hearing, the right to examine evidence and respond to accusations, the right to have advisory counsel).|$|E

25|$|Articles 19 and 32-36 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child {{prohibits the}} {{exploitation}} of children in any form and in any context. Any child who is exposed to violence, exploitation or abuse {{can be considered a}} victim of crime and enjoys the correlated rights and entitlements, including access to assistance, protection and support, services for recovery and rehabilitation, access to justice, with due <b>procedural</b> <b>safeguards</b> in any related legal or administrative proceedings. Children at risk of exploitation have to be identified and recognised as being at risk. This implies that {{they have a right to}} assistance and support in order to prevent their exploitation or any other harm resulting from the risks. Considering the difficulties of identifying children who have been trafficked and the broad protection against all forms and contexts of exploitation afforded under the Convention, a child rights-based approach prioritises the identification of child victims of exploitation or other crime and children at risk. Whether or not exploitation takes place in a context of trafficking is of subordinate relevance for the child rights and protection context. It may interest primarily the law enforcement investigations and the prosecution.|$|E

500|$|In Yong Vui Kong, the Court {{described}} the clemency power in Singapore as vested {{exclusively in the}} executive, and thus not justiciable on the merits. Despite this, {{it is not an}} [...] "extra-legal" [...] power that is beyond any legal constraints. Agreeing with Tan Guat Neo Phyllis, the Court held that the clemency power is subject to judicial review if it can be shown to have been exercised unconstitutionally, in bad faith or for extraneous purposes. In addition, the fact that Article22P(2) of the Constitution stipulates specific <b>procedural</b> <b>safeguards</b> in death penalty cases indicates that the clemency power must be reviewable to ensure that these safeguards have been complied with. Article22P(2) requires documents from the trial judge and the appellate court, and the Attorney-General's opinion on the case, to be sent to the Cabinet for consideration so that it can advise the President on the exercise of the clemency power. These procedural requirements imply that Cabinet has a constitutional duty to consider the documents in good faith before advising the President. If evidence is adduced to show that the Cabinet did not consider the offender's case impartially and in good faith (for example, it never met to discuss the case, or tossed a coin instead of properly considering the materials transmitted to it), Cabinet would have breached Article22P(2). In such a situation, the courts must be able to review the clemency decision. This conclusion is also mandated by the guarantee in Article 9(1) of the Constitution that a person may not be deprived of either life or personal liberty save in accordance with law.|$|E
500|$|J.D.B. v. North Carolina was a 2011 case {{in which}} the Supreme Court of the United States held that age is {{relevant}} when determining police custody for Miranda purposes. Sotomayor was assigned to write the majority opinion in the case. J.D.B. was a 13-year-old student enrolled in special education classes whom police had suspected of committing two robberies. A police investigator visited J.D.B. at school, where he was interrogated by the investigator, a uniformed police officer, and school officials. J.D.B. subsequently confessed to his crimes and was convicted. J.D.B. was not given a Miranda warning during the interrogation, nor an opportunity to contact his legal guardian. During the trial, attempts to suppress the statements given by J.D.B. because he was not given a Miranda warning were denied on the grounds that J.D.B. was not in police custody. The case was appealed and the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case. Sotomayor's opinion for the Court held that a child's age properly informs the Miranda custody analysis. Her opinion underscored the dangers of not applying age to the custody analysis, writing: [...] "to hold... that a child's age is never relevant to whether a suspect has been taken into custody— and thus to ignore the very real differences between children and adults— would be to deny children the full scope of the <b>procedural</b> <b>safeguards</b> that Miranda guarantees to adults". The opinion cited Stansbury v. California where the Court held that a child's age [...] "would have affected how a reasonable person" [...] in the suspect's position [...] "would perceive his or her freedom to leave". Yarborough v. Alvarado was also cited, where the Court wrote that a child's age [...] "generates commonsense conclusions about behavior and perception". Finally, Sotomayor's opinion pointed out that the law reflects the idea that a child's judgment {{is not the same as}} an adult's, in the form of legal disqualifications on children as a class (e.g. limitations on a child's ability to marry without parental consent). Sotomayor's opinion was challenged by Associate Justice Samuel Alito who wrote a dissenting opinion for four Justices.|$|E

It then examines plausible accounts of the collective action problems that seem to explain the lack of ambition to mitigate. After criticizing the merits of two proposals to overcome these problems, it discusses the pledge and review process. It argues that pledge and review possesses the virtues of encouraging broad participation and of providing a <b>procedural</b> <b>safeguard</b> for the right of sustainable development. However, given {{the perceptions of the}} marginal short term costs of mitigation, pledge and review is unlikely, at least initially, to issue in an agreement to make deep reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Because there is no rival approach that seems likely to better instantiate the two virtues, pledge and review may be the best available policy for mitigation. Moreover, recent economic research suggests that the co-benefits of mitigation may be greater than previously assumed and that the costs of renewable energy may be less than previously calculated. This would radically undermine claims that the short term mitigation costs necessarily render mitigation irrational and produce collective action problems. Given the circumstances, pledge and review might be our best hope to avoid dangerous climate change...|$|R
40|$|In {{a recent}} spate of highly publicized incidents, {{citizens}} have used cell phones equipped with video cameras to record violent arrests. Oftentimes they post their recordings on the Internet for public examination. As {{the courts have}} recognized, this behavior lies close {{to the heart of}} the First Amendment. But the Constitution imperfectly protects this new form of government monitoring. Fourth Amendment doctrine generally permits the warrantless seizure of cell phones used to record violent arrests, on the theory that the recording contains evidence of a crime. The Fourth Amendment inquiry does not evaluate a seizing officer 2 ̆ 7 s state of mind, permitting an official to seize a video for the very purpose of suppressing its contents. Moreover, Supreme Court precedent is typically read to ignore First Amendment interests implicated by searches and seizures. This result is perverse. Courts evaluating these seizures should stop to recall the Fourth Amendment 2 ̆ 7 s origins as a <b>procedural</b> <b>safeguard</b> for expressive interests. They should remember, too, the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s jurisprudence surrounding seizures of obscene materials—an area in which the Court carefully shaped Fourth Amendment doctrine to protect First Amendment values. Otherwise reasonable seizures can become unreasonable when they threaten free expression, and seizures of cell phones used to record violent arrests are of that stripe. Courts should therefore disallow this breed of seizure, trusting the political branches to craft a substitute procedure that will protect law-enforcement interests without doing violence to First Amendment freedoms...|$|R

40|$|The Double Jeopardy Clause of the United States Constitution provides: No person shall [...] . {{be subject}} {{for the same}} offense to be twice put in {{jeopardy}} of life or limb... If a refugee who has committed a deportable offense and served his sentence is subsequently deported from {{a place where he}} calls home to a place where he would face persecution, he could literally be said to have been twice put in jeopardy of life and limb. That seems to be a prima facie violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment. This constitutional guarantee is, however, not currently available to refugees for a complex set of reasons. The most fundamental reason is that deportation is deemed to be a consequence of a civil proceeding that does not necessitate constitutional guarantees attending proceedings of a criminal nature. Although traditionally the Double Jeopardy Clause has been viewed as a <b>procedural</b> <b>safeguard</b> and a substantive limitation on criminal punishments, the constitutionality of second civil punitive sanctions has always been a subject of serious challenges. In recent decades, the Supreme Court has expressly addressed these challenges in a series of cases and consistently held that the Double Jeopardy Clause does impose substantive limitations on civil sanctions that are so punitive in nature to be considered second punishments. Deportation is generally considered to be a civil sanction. Notwithstanding the jurisprudential complexities involved, this article argues that the deportation of an already recognized refugee to a place where he might face persecution, pursuant to the statutory exclusion of convicted criminals, is a second punishment, and as such violates the Double Jeopardy Clause...|$|R
40|$|Chapter 6 of Research Handbook on Human Rights and Humanitarian Law In {{the wake}} of the September 11, 2001 attacks in the United States, the US, with the {{assistance}} of its coalition partners – all parties to various human rights instruments – initiated the so-called ‘war on terror’ by invading Afghanistan, where their armed forces killed or captured hundreds of ‘terrorist suspects’. Some of those detained were taken to the US military facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, while others have languished in US custody in Afghanistan. These actions raise the question whether a State is bound by its human rights obligations when its agents operate outside of national territory. And, if so, how do those obligations interrelate with the State’s other obligations under international humanitarian law when its counter-terrorism operations coincide with situations of armed conflict. This chapter addresses these questions. In particular, it examines the extraterritorial reach of two fundamental human rights during two situations recognized in international law. These rights are the right to life and the right to liberty and the related <b>procedural</b> <b>safeguard</b> of habeas corpus. The two situations examined are: (1) international armed conflicts, including occupation; and (2) non-international armed conflicts. The paper surveys the jurisprudence on the extraterritorial application of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), the American Convention on Human Rights (American Convention) and American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man (American Declaration), and the European Convention on Human Rights (European Convention), {{and the extent to which}} rights in these instruments can be derogated from. It also examines how the treaty bodies supervising these instruments view the relationship between international human rights law (HRL) and international humanitarian law (IHL) in situations of armed conflict. Relevant decisions of the International Court of Justice are also referenced in this connection. The chapter also identifies certain gaps in legal protection. [URL]...|$|R

40|$|The classic debate {{surrounding}} the prolific {{role of the}} European Union in defining spheres of competence and power relationships has long divided scholarly opinion. However, in recent years, the long-standing acquiescence to the broad powers of the Union {{has given way to}} the emerging perception of a competence problem in Europe. For a long period it was taken for granted that the European Community could act whenever its action was justified {{on the basis of the}} widely interpreted objectives of the Treaties. However this context has since changed. There is a widespread perception of a competence problem in Europe and the overabundance of provisions limiting the Union's competences is one of the most obvious marks left by the Lisbon Treaty. This book discusses the extent to which the parameters of power throughout the Union and its Member States have been recast by the recent implementation of the Lisbon Treaty and doctrines developed by the European Court of Justice. Comprised of contributions from a vast array of leading practitioners and academics in the field of EU Law, this volume assesses the debate {{surrounding the}} political identity of the European Union, and further illustrates the relevance of the Federal theory of sharing competences for the development of EU Law. Finally, the question of new potential limits to Union's competence is addressed. If anything, this broad reflection on the notion of competence in the EU law context is a way of opening up the question of the nature and contours of the political identity of the European Union.
