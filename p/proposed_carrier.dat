40|$|A new {{microscopic}} and {{kinetic model}} of light-induced metastability in {{hydrogenated amorphous silicon}} (a-Si:H) was recently <b>proposed.</b> <b>Carrier</b> recombination excites H from deep Si-H bonds into a mobile configuration, leaving a threefold-coordinated Si dangling bond (DB) defect {{at the site of}} excitation - a process long suspected to be an element of metastable DB production. Normally, mobile H are recaptured at DB defects and neither metastability nor net DB production results. However, when two mobile H collide, they form a metastable two-hydrogen complex and leave two spatially-uncorrelated Staebler-Wronski DBs.

A typical example is the SiC dust (responsible for the most popular dust feature in C-rich sources at 11.3 μm). The suggestion for SiC to be the 21 -μm feature carrier must pass the examination that the expected intensity ratio of the 11.3 -μm feature to the 21 -μm feature should agree with the observed value of I (11.3 μm)/I (21 μm) < 0.01 (Jiang et al., 2005).|$|E
40|$|This paper {{performs}} a comprehensive performance {{analysis of a}} family of non-data-aided feedforward carrier frequency offset estimators for QAM signals transmitted through AWGN channels in the presence of unknown timing error.

The exact asymptotic performance of these estimators is established and analyzed {{as a function of the}} received signal sampling frequency, signal-to-noise ratio, timing delay, and number of symbols. It is shown that in the presence of intersymbol interference effects, the performance of the frequency offset estimators can be improved significantly by oversampling (or fractionally sampling) the received signal. Finally, simulation results are presented to corroborate the theoretical performance analysis, and comparisons with the modified CramÃƒÂ©r-Rao bound illustrate the superior performance of the proposed nonlinear least-squares carrier frequency offset estimators...|$|E
40|$|Among {{the several}} <b>proposed</b> <b>carriers</b> of diffuse {{interstellar}} bands (DIB's) are impurities in small dust grains, especially in iron oxide grains (Huffman 1977) and silicate grains (Huffman 1970).

40|$|ABSTRACT: To {{exploit the}} full {{potential}} of multicomponent wide-bandgap oxides, an in-depth {{understanding of the}} complex defect chemistry and of {{the role played by}} the constituent oxides is required. In this work, thorough theoretical and experimental investigations are combined in order to explain the carrier generation and transport in crystalline InGaZnO 4. Using first-principles density functional approach, we calculate the formation energies and transition levels of possible acceptor and donor point defects as well as the implied defect complexes in InGaZnO 4 and determine the equilibrium defect and electron densities as a function of growth temperature and oxygen partial pressure. An excellent agreement of the theoretical results with our Brouwer analysis of the bulk electrical measurements for InGaZnO 4 establishes the Ga antisite defect, GaZn, as the major electron donor in InGaZnO 4. Moreover, we show that the oxygen vacancies, long believed to be the carrier source in this oxide, are scarce. The <b>proposed</b> <b>carrier</b> generation mechanism also explains the observed intriguing behavior of the conductivity in In-rich vs Ga-rich InGaZnO 4. 1...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, an {{overview}} of carrier frequency offset (CFO) estimation algorithms for Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) systems is presented. It is well-known that multicarrier systems suffer from their high sensitivity to mismatches of transmitter and receiver oscillator frequencies. The performance degrades since the CFO destroys the orthogonality of the subcarriers. Hence, extensive {{research has been done}} on the estimation and correction of the CFO in S ingle- I nput S ingle- O utput (SISO) systems. Mainly, the proposed algorithms can be categorized into data-aided and blind techniques. Several estimation techniques have been extended to the S ingle- I nput M ultiple- O utput (SIMO) case where multiple receive antennas can be utilized to gain diversity. However, less attention has been paid on synchronization in the attractive M ultiple- I nput M ultiple- O utput (MIMO) case which is topic of tremendous interest in current research. The present paper concentrates on aspects of this new scenario. Starting with algorithms for SISO and SIMO, this contribution reviews briefly <b>proposed</b> <b>carrier</b> frequency synchronization techniques which could be implemented in forthcoming MIMO systems...|$|E
