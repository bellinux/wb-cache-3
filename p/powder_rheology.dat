40|$|Despite their {{widespread}} and well-established use, powders are challenging materials to work with, {{as evidenced by}} the common problems encountered during storage and processing, {{as well as in the}} quality and consistency of final products. The diverse range of unit operations used to handle and manipulate powders subject them to extremes of stress and flow regimes; from the high stress, static conditions present in hoppers to the dispersed, dynamic state of a fluidised bed dryer. It is therefore possible for a powder to behave a certain way in a given unit operation, but entirely differently in another. Many existing powder testing techniques don’t deliver the required information as the test conditions do not represent the conditions in the process. Modern powder rheometers generate process relevant data by accurately measuring dynamic flow, bulk and shear properties. This approach enables a powder’s response to aeration, consolidation, forced flow and changes in flow rate to be reliably quantified thereby simulating the conditions which a powder will be subjected to in process. This paper provides an introduction to <b>powder</b> <b>rheology,</b> including a comparison with traditional techniques, and uses case studies to demonstrate how <b>powder</b> <b>rheology</b> can be applied to optimise production processes and enhance product qualit...|$|E
40|$|It {{is crucial}} for dry powder inhaler {{formulations}} to exhibit satisfactory powder flow during production and administration. In this study, fine lactose carrier particles were modified by dry coating to alter their inter-particulate interactions therefore improve their powder flow. Six lactose samples with different size fractions were coated either with colloidal silica or magnesium stearate using either a mechanofusion processor or a conventional mixer. Powder flow behaviours were characterized using bulk densities and <b>powder</b> <b>rheology</b> methods. The greatest improvement in powder flow was obtained after mechanofusion treatment with magnesium stearate, as determined by both methods. Changes were the most significant for particles with mean size ranges 8 - 20 μm. Powder rheometry appeared to have strong potential in optimising powder flow for future studies...|$|E
40|$|This {{doctoral}} research aims {{to deepen}} knowledge {{on the impact}} of electrostatic forces on <b>powder</b> <b>rheology.</b> The initial focus of this thesis was to answer the following question:"Does the presence of electrostatic charges on a pharmaceutical powder carrier have an influence on the spatial lubricant distribution over the carrier particles and thus on the granular rheology?". After the development of an electrification setup and many experiments, {{the answer to this question}} turns out to be negative. However, this question led us to discover several phenomena, such as deformation mechanisms of powder columns during shear tests with the FT 4 rheometer; and the formation of self-assemblies after the imposition of electrostatic charges on pharmaceutical excipients. These phenomena are explored in this thesis. Therefore, we demonstrate the inability of a FT 4 rheometer to conduct shear tests when pharmaceutical formulations are lubricated with magnesium stearate. Indeed,"monolithic cake" behaviour appears. Two numerical models (method of characteristics and analysis of Janssen) are used to assess the stress state and explain this particular case. In addition, a characterization of the shape and particle size distribution of the electrostatic self-assemblies is presented in this thesis. Finally, the previous parts of this thesis showed the importance of wall friction effects during shear tests. Thus, a final part of this thesis focuses on the mechanism of wall lubrication. This latest effort brings us back to the study of the influence of electrostatic forces on <b>powder</b> <b>rheology.</b> Indeed, a high variability with the wall friction results is obtained with unlubricated powders at a relative humidity of 20 %. The presence of magnesium stearate and/or higher humidity conditions reduces this variability. However, some tests indicate that electrostatic phenomena are part of the explanation...|$|E

40|$|International audienceA new {{four-bladed}} vane powder rheometer {{is proposed}} to study <b>powder</b> and nanopowder <b>rheology</b> at {{low and high}} shear rates. As shear rates increase, the powder flow will evolve from a Newtonian regime (low shear rates) to a Coulombic regime (moderate shear rates) {{and then to a}} kinetic regime (high shear rates) at which the powder may become self-fluidized because of intense particles collisions. Viscosity measurements of noncohesive glass beads at low shear rates (Newtonian and Coulombic regimes) do not strongly depend upon the particle size and can reach values much larger than commonly used viscosities in some CFDs models. Since, in the kinetic regime, the shear stress is a strong function of the particle size, agglomerate particle size of cohesive powders can be directly inferred from rheograms. Cohesive carbon black and silica nanopowders have been tested and compared to noncohesive glass beads microparticles, chosen as reference. For noncohesive glass bead micropowders, the ``agglomerate'' diameter average values found from rheological measurements are of the same order of magnitude as the primary diameters of the powder. This indicates that the kinetic theory of granular flows describes well these high shear rate regimes and that such theory can be used to estimate agglomerate diameters. It is also found that estimated agglomerate sizes of nanometric cohesive materials can reach sizes of hundred micrometers depending upon their cohesion strength. Such agglomerate size measurements have been corroborated with those made by microscopy...|$|R

Acoustical performance was correlated to surface energy analysis and <b>powder</b> <b>rheology</b> testing. Inverse gas chromatography (iGC) {{was used to}} determine the surface energy, with the dominant component being the dispersive component. This reflected the non-polar, hydrophobic, character of the micas. The determined yield locus and Mohr's circles indicated that the material with the highest packing density exhibited more free flowing powder characteristics, compared with the lower packing density materials, which exhibited a greater cohesive powder flow behaviour. All tested mica powders were sensitive to aeration and become fluidised. Based on the acoustical measurements the worst sound absorption performance was found for the highest packing density material exhibiting the highest magnitude of the longitudinal elastic coefficient.

40|$|Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) {{is a form}} of {{additive}} manufacturing (“ 3 D printing”) in which objects are created by selectively fusing together successive layers of powdered material. This presents a completely new and diverse way to process polymers, with applications in the medical sector, fit-to-body arrangements and various consumer markets. The widely acknowledged stumbling block in the progression of SLS is the limited range of materials, in particular polymers, which can currently be processed by this technique. At present, the market is dominated by a few polyamide- 12 grades. In order to broaden the application window of SLS, {{an increase in the number}} and variety of SLS polymeric materials is required. In order to increase the material palette for SLS, a fundamental understanding of all aspects of the process parameters vs. the material properties is required.

40|$|The {{general theory}} of {{electrokinetic}} phenomena strictly applies to ideal and rigid surfaces or particles. However, many interfaces are non-ideal with respect to both the surface smoothness and surface homogeneity. Detailed {{knowledge and understanding of}} the interface structure is often required for proper analysis of electrokinetic measurements. In this study, we investigate the option of studying surface heterogeneity using powder polycrystalline active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) as our model systems. We characterized these by a combination of physicochemical techniques, i. e. inverse gas chromatography surface energy analysis, SEM, thermal analysis and <b>powder</b> <b>rheology,</b> to assess the surface interface structure, topology, roughness, chemical heterogeneity and cooperative macroscopic behaviour. The latter characteristics are reflected in the three dimensional packing, which, in turn, affects the porosity and rigidity of the obtained powder bed. Such information is also of paramount interest for realizing proper fluid transport and dispersing or tableting API substances in the pharmaceutical industry. Notably, the 3 D packing is affected not only by geometrical characteristics of the powders but also by the polarity and surface charge distribution. These characteristics can be correlated with surface energy data by means of surface energy profiles and surface energy distribution plots. © 2016 Elsevier LtdTeva Czech Industries; Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic [LO 1305...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Powder {{injection}} moulding (PIM) {{is an important}} and accepted industrial technique for producing net-shaped components which combines the advantages of {{injection moulding}} and powder metallurgy. The properties of the feedstock, a mixture of powder and binder system (often based on a thermoplastic polymer), strongly influence the process. An accurate characterisation of the feedstock properties are then of great significance in many situations, e. g. when simulating moulding of PIM-components. Here {{it is important to}} perform the measurements at conditions similar to those experienced during the injection moulding. In the present work, a model system, consisting of steel powder, poly(ethylene glycol) and wax, is used in order to illustrate how the rheological properties as well as thermal properties, such as the conductivity and the specific heat, of the system can be related to the corresponding properties of the polymeric binder system. In a similar way, the pvT (pressure-volume-temperature) -behaviour of the model system is analysed and discussed. With the model system described above and a medium-pressure injection-moulding machine, the mould filling phase was studied in situ with a special mould equipped with a sight glass using a high speed camera. Effects of features such as the mould temperature, the melt temperature, the surface roughness of the mould cavity, the gate dimensions, the mould design and the flow rate on the filling behaviour were demonstrated. In particular it was noted that a rougher mould surface facilitated to some extent the filling of the mould. The mould temperature, the nominal melt temperature and the flow rate affected the position of weld lines via the cooling of the feedstock and the corresponding change of the melt viscosity. The experimentally determined weld-line positions were compared with predictions from numerical simulations performed with a commercial software. The physical properties of the model feedstock, as measured {{in the first part of}} this study, were used as input data for the simulation. The agreement between the experiments and the predictions was in most cases quite fair or good. The in situ observation of the mould filling also provided the possibility to study how the gate dimensions and the flow rate influenced the jetting behaviour. In summary, this work combines feedstock characterization, in situ visualization of practical mould filling experiments and computer simulations in order to get a better understanding of the properties courses of events influencing the mould filling Key words: <b>powder</b> injection moulding, <b>rheology,</b> thermal properties, mould filling, processing conditions, jetting, computer simulation...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{combines}} four manuscripts {{of which}} I am the first author. The first manuscript examines the phase separation process and related process parameters. This article provides detailed experimental {{results of the}} delivery and separation process. During the delivery of 40 % Liquid-to-Powder-Ratio (LPR) paste, only 62 [plus ou moins] 3 % of the paste initially present in the 10 -mL syringe could be injected. Thereafter, the remaining paste in the syringe was not amendable to injection suggesting the existence of liquid separation. The LPR of the extruded fraction of a 37 % LPR paste ranged from 40. 9 [plus ou moins] 2. 0 % to 42. 7 [plus ou moins] 2. 1 %. On the other hand, a shortage of water content was measured for the paste left in the syringe. Furthermore, this shortage was gradual, ranging from 27. 3 [plus ou moins] 1. 9 % at the plunger side to 30. 9 [plus ou moins] 1. 6 % at the tip side. In addition, this article presents rheological measurements of the paste showing clearly that the limitation {{was not related to}} the viscosity of the paste but rather to the phase separation process. Specifically, the yield stresses were around 66 [plus ou moins] 2 Pa, 19 [plus ou moins] 2 Pa, and 8 [plus ou moins] 0 Pa for 40 %, 50 %, and 65 % LPR suspensions, respectively. For the three studied LPRs, the viscosity rapidly dropped with an increase of shear rate to a level below 10 Pas. The second manuscript examines the possibility that fine particles migrate faster than large particles during injection, hence leading to a so-called size separation. This size separation process can be expected from the scientific literature, but had not been investigated prior to my study. In a way, the size separation is very similar to the phase separation process. An electrohydraulic system was used to control the delivery process. The result of this second study, showed no evidence of size separation. It was therefore concluded that the main mechanism underlying the limited injectability is the liquid phase filtration through the porous particles bed of the paste. The third manuscript examines the role of powder porosity ([epsilon]) and permeability. For that purpose, an electronically assisted device was used to measure the powder permeability. In this study, three powders were examined for comparison and better understanding. In addition, the powder permeability was correlated with the paste injectability. Adding 3 wt% of a fine nanosized powder to the [bêta]-TCP powder decreased the mixture permeability at a porosity of [varepsilon] = 67. 5 % from 6. 4. 10 [exposant]- 13 m[exposant] 2 to 5. 6. 10 [exposant]- 13 m[exposant] 2 and increased the injected volume fraction from 70. 8 [plus ou moins] 1. 9 % to 84. 5 [plus ou moins] 0. 9 %. The results showed clear evidence that the injectability can be improved by admixing different powders. However, permeability was not a strong predictor of the liquid separation phenomenon. The last manuscript provides a practical solution to reduce phase separation occurrence. For that purpose an ultrasonication process was suggested and applied during the delivery process to improve injectability. Specifically, sonicating the paste reduced agglomeration, decreased paste viscosity due to the shear thinning and therefore reduced phase separation. The result of the ultrasound assisted delivery was remarkably effective since it has been able to fully deliver highly concentrated paste, with minimal force exerted by hand. For instance, the injectable volume fraction of a 40 % LPR paste injected with a 5 -mL syringe increased significantly from 71. 3 [plus ou moins] 0. 5 % to 99. 1 [plus ou moins] 0. 9 % using 150 microns ultrasonic amplitude at a 20 kHz frequency. This chapter provides clear evidence that an electromechanical approach can be used to improve the injectability of a calcium phosphate paste. This thesis addresses an important limitation of calcium phosphate cements, namely phase separation during injection. This thesis also provides a scientific understanding and a practical solution for this problem. The electromechanical solution proposed here is one out of several possible solutions. Future work may focus on building numerical tools to help {{in the design of the}} powder and to understand the link between <b>powder</b> properties, <b>rheology,</b> syringe geometry and phase separation.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper was to {{evaluate}} the possible use of three types of pharmaceutical grades of phyllosilicates as pharmaceutical excipients. Seven samples (two smectites, three palygorskites, and two sepiolites) were studied. A complete mineralogical and chemical characterization of each material was made and powder texture was established by image analysis of scanning electron micrographs. Powder flow properties were then determined and the influence of textural characteristics on <b>powder</b> <b>rheology</b> and particle packing was assessed. Mineral contents were adequate for the sepiolites (� 90 % of main mineral) and smectites (78 and 95 %), but should be improved on the palygorskite samples (around 50 % of main mineral in two of the studied samples). According to the textural characterization, the samples presented almost equal size distributions, but exhibited two different morphologies (i. e., laminar for smectites and fibrous for sepiolites and palygorskites). Both sepiolites possessed high flowability, whereas this factor varied from medium to low in the other materials. The compressibility of smectites was adequate, whereas that of palygorskites was high and that of the sepiolites was low. All of the samples studied would be useful as solid dosage form excipients (some samples would require improvement of their flow properties or treatment {{to reduce the amount of}} mineral impurities) ...|$|E
40|$|Processing of {{granular}} material often requires mixing steps {{in order to}} blend cohesive powders, distribute viscous liquids into powder beds or create agglomerates from a wet powder mass. For this reason, using bladed, high-speed mixers is frequently considered a good solution by many types of industry. However, despite the importance of such mixers in powder processing, the granular flow behavior inside the mixer bowl is generally not totally understood. In this work extensive experimentation was performed comparing {{the behavior of a}} lab-scale mixer (1. 9. l vessel volume) to that of a pilot-scale mixer (65. l vessel volume) with a mixture of some pharmaceutical excipients (e. g. lactose, cellulose). The aim was to propose a new and more detailed method for describing the complex <b>powder</b> <b>rheology</b> inside an high shear mixer using impeller torque, current consumption and particle image velocimetry (PIV) analysis. Particularly, a new dimensionless torque number is proposed for the torque profile analysis in order to isolate the contributions of mass fill and blade clearance at the vessel base. Impeller torque and motor current consumption were integrated with PIV to obtain more detailed information about the surface velocity and flow pattern changes in the pilot-scale mixer.

40|$|A {{mechanically}} stirred fluid-bed rheometer (msFBR) {{was used}} to study the rheology of powders aerated below the fluidisation threshold. Glass ballotini (group B) and silica powders (group A) with different fine contents were tested. The torque necessary to rotate an impeller immersed in a bed of aerated powders was measured for different impeller depths and aeration rates. A model was developed: (a) to estimate the state of stress at the impeller depth, following Janssen’s approach {{for the evaluation of}} stresses in silos, and (b) to evaluate the torque, with the hypothesis that it is determined by the powder shear on a flat cylinder surface around the impeller. The model uses some powder properties, such as the dynamic and the wall yield loci of the powder used, which were estimated with a Peschl shear cell modified for small loads. The reasonable prediction of the torque at impeller depth larger than 3 cm provided by the model supports the hypothesis that the torque is defined by the plastic deformation of powders and can be explained within a simple Mohr–Coulomb approach to powder flow. The passive stress distribution that appears to set up during the shearing experiments leaves open some fundamental questions regarding the limiting conditions determining such behaviour. As in previous experiments found in the literature, aeration does not affect the rheology of powders but modifies the stress distribution within the bed. The content of fines {{turns out to be a}} key factor in the determination of <b>powder</b> <b>rheology</b> as measured both with the shear cell and with the fluid-bed rheometer...|$|E
40|$|Surface wear is {{estimated}} to result in upwards of 70 % of material failure in the US with costs of over 300 billion dollars per annum. Tribology {{is defined as the}} study of friction, lubrication, and wear, and while all three of these sub-disciplines stem from interactions at the asperity scale, studies involving the mechanics of industrial interfaces will often ignore their interdependence. This work makes use of a synthesis of in situ tribological data with ex situ surface characterization, in order to elucidate the mechanics of friction and wear in a number of industrial interfaces each with its own objective. Section 1 focuses on using this technique to elucidate the mechanics of protective solid lubricants. Detailed experiments were conducted to study the formation and depletion of self-replenishing powder transfer films in both single component and composite forms. Based on the synthesis of ex situ and in situ findings, the primary wear mechanisms at each interface were described as abrasive and transfer film phenomena were described in a new way using a quasi-hydrodynamic approach. In addition to transfer films, hard tribological coatings were also studied for their ability to mitigate impact damage. Coefficient of restitution results were combined with investigations ex situ of the impact sites and compared to nanoindentation results of coating properties. Through synthesizing these results, it was found that more elastic coatings worked best on stiffer substrates, while harder, more brittle coatings worked best on soft substrates. In Section 2, the Section 1 findings were crucial {{in the development of a}} numerical model which was presented using abrasive formulations for the wear of soft surfaces and preferential patterning. Quantitative agreement for modeling friction and surface evolution, as well as qualitative agreement for wear trends were provided for experimental values from previous studies. In Section 3, this technique was used to study <b>powder</b> <b>rheology</b> as it applies to flows in the additive manufacturing process. Rheological characterization was conducted for stress states akin to spreading and hopper flow on an FT 4 powder rheometer, while morphological characterization was performed in collaboration with the Material Science Department at Carnegie Mellon using scanning electron microscopy. By analyzing the results in concert, it was found that morphology proved to be more important than material type or manufacturing process in governing flow properties. Spreading-like states were found to be most sensitive to factors affecting particle rolling, while hopper-like states were found to be most sensitive to factors affecting particle cohesion. In Section 4, the interactions of single cutters were explored for rock substrates found during drilling for oil, gas, and geothermal heat. Experiments were conducted first for O 1 tool steel buttons on Carthage Marble. Cutting with this type cutter was found to produce rough surfaces which would lead to an increase of friction force in the cut. Experiments for dry and lubricated cutting with industrial polycrystalline diamond compact cutters were performed for Carthage Marble, Nugget Sandstone, and Mancos Shale on a retrofitted UMT- 3 Tribometer from Bruker. Cutting was found to produce smoother topographies and a decrease in friction. Lubricants were found to possess both a lubricating effect which would reduce COF as well as a weakening effect which would enhance rate of penetration and the load at which cutting would commence. Scraping was found to produce a scalloped topography similar to “bit-bounce. ” Industrial drilling fluids or “muds” were also evaluated and ranked using a figure of merit proposed within this work. By normalization with the dry scenario, muds performance in terms of friction and rate of penetration could be combined to provide ranking of a given mud for a given rock type. Overall it was found that implementing both in situ tribological data and ex situ surface metrology was an extremely effective way to recreate the mechanics present in industrial interfaces which are difficult to observe otherwise...|$|E
