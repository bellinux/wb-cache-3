5|$|Faced {{with this}} information, Master Chief and Cortana decide to destroy Halo to prevent its activation. While {{fighting}} the Flood, the Covenant, and Guilty Spark's Sentinels, Cortana discovers {{that the best}} way to accomplish this is to cause the crashed Pillar of Autumn to self-destruct. However, Captain Keyes' authorization is required to destroy the Autumn, forcing the Chief and Cortana to return to the now-Flood-infested Truth and Reconciliation to search for him. By the time they reach Keyes, however, he has been infected beyond the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>no</b> <b>return</b> by the Flood. Master Chief retrieves Keyes' neural implants directly from his brain and retreats to the Autumn, where Cortana activates the ship's self-destruct sequence. However, 343 Guilty Spark reappears and deactivates the countdown, discovering the record of human history in the process. Master Chief manually destabilizes the Pillar of Autumns fusion reactors, and he and Cortana narrowly escape the destruction of the ring via a fighter. Cortana scans nearby space and finds that they are apparently the only survivors. Cortana justifies the sacrifices of the other humans on Halo, stating that they had no choice due to the threat posed by Halo, the Covenant and the Flood. Cortana believes it's over but the Master Chief tells her that they're just getting started.|$|E
5|$|Another {{reason for}} the gradual decline in the {{development}} of Sicily's Baroque and building in general was that the money was running out. During the 17th century, the aristocracy had lived principally on their landed estates, tending and improving them, and as a result their income also increased. During the 18th century, the nobility gradually migrated towards the cities, in particular Palermo, to enjoy the social delights of the Viceroy's court and Catania. Their town palazzi grew in size and splendour, {{to the detriment of the}} abandoned estates, which were still expected to provide the revenue. The land agents left to run the estates over time became less efficient, or corrupt, often both. Consequently, aristocratic incomes fell. The aristocracy borrowed money using the estates as surety, until the value of the neglected estates fell below the money borrowed against them. Moreover, Sicily was by now as unstable politically as its nobility were financially. Ruled from Naples by the weak Ferdinand IV and his dominant wife, Sicily had declined to the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>no</b> <b>return</b> long before 1798 and again in 1806 when the King was forced by the invading French to flee Naples to Sicily. The French were kept at bay from Sicily only by an expeditionary force of 17,000 British troops, and Sicily was now ruled by Britain in effect if not in name. King Ferdinand then in 1811 imposed the first taxes, at a single stroke alienating his aristocracy.|$|E

40|$|Summer 2012 saw records {{fall for}} {{intensity}} of drought and number, size, {{and cost of}} wildfires in the Central and Western United States, and the climate forecast calls {{for more of the}} same in the near and distant future. When wildfire breaks out, emergency responders decide their immediate strategy based on past experience and quick judgment calls. But in the long term, land managers need to plan for a warmer climate on a time scale of decades, or even a century or more, to better reflect the life span of trees and forests. Studies supported by the Joint Fire Science Program (JFSP) are beginning to provide this type of guidance for managers. A central question of interest to researchers is whether there are tipping <b>points,</b> <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>no</b> <b>return</b> beyond which landscapes will not revert to their historically documented conditions.

30|$|The {{driver and}} the tram {{operated}} in a transportation {{system that was}} {{expressed in terms of}} how well-traffic moved. There were signals, signs, points (i.e. switches that selected the route), and rules of the road, all of which defined issues of flow and required technical knowledge. Most of the observed trams served as a streetcar in the main; that is, they moved on the road with adjoining vehicles but also on their own rail corridors (i.e. a dedicated light rail corridor section). Some sections of track necessarily had less tram and road vehicle separation, {{largely as a result of}} increased passenger densities. The task of tram driving itself was observed to have a number of distinct features. First, it was highly dynamic, both in terms of the number and frequency of tasks needing to be performed. The consensus from participants was that they performed three core tasks: (1) preparing the tram so it was safe before starting the shift; (2) ensuring a smooth journey; and (3) providing good customer service within the time constraints. These goals were closely coupled and expertise was characterised by the ability to regulate them well. Trams could move too fast or too slow with little effort, meaning that they could encroach easily beyond <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>no</b> <b>return</b> with relative ease. This included road cross hatchings representing “no mans land” with little clearance for turning trams, going through red lights into road traffic, or driving over points that were set incorrectly.|$|R

40|$|Concentrations of {{persistent}} organic pollutants (POPs) in air and water do show a remarkable spatial and temporal variability. Part of this variability is obviously associated to proximity to sources. On the other hand, there are a myriad of processes and variables in the biosphere that drive variability of POP concentrations in the environment. In fact, these processes can lead to change of concentrations {{of more than one}} order of magnitude. When assessing the risk associated to POPs, and their role as a driver of changes in ecosystems, {{it is important to have}} the information available on the sources of this variability, and the kind of variability they produce(seasonal, pulse, diurnal, spatial trends, vertical profiles, etc). Therefore the objective of this deliverable is to provide a review of the different kind of variability that has been found in the environment and comment on the potential processes driving this variability. For temporal variability, and since POPs are semi-volatile organic compounds, temperature is identified as an important driver of atmospheric concentrations due to its influence on air-water partitioning. Furthermore there is an important variability at daily and diurnal scale due to several factors, such varying air masses, influence of carbon cycle on dissolved-phase POP concentrations etc. However, it is shown, that an important fraction of this variability at short time is currently not well understood. State of the art models, however, show that atmospheric inputs can induce ten-fold variability in POP concentrations in surface waters. Concerning spatial variability, in addition to proximity to sources, there is also other variables that lead to an important spatial variability. Atmospheric sources such as diffusive uptakes and dry deposition are strongly enhanced at high wind speeds. Furthermore, since POPs are hydrophobic pollutants they can present a patchy distribution due to the influence of organic carbon cycle. Models for the European seas also show that there is a high variability in atmospheric inputs of POPs. The review of literature reported concentrations of PCBs, PAHs and PBDEs confirm this important variability The identified spatio-temporal trends in POP concentrations and the identifications of some of the drives of these sources of variability provide important information that may eventually be useful in order to define the POPs impact that can lead to <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>no</b> <b>return</b> in ecosystems and identify thresholds.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this deliverable is to review and report the available models for studying the coupling of atmospheric inputs of persistent organic pollutants and their accumulation in planktonic food webs. Atmospheric inputs {{are known to be}} the main input of pollutants to open sea marine environments and also be important in coastal environments. The modelling of these interactions is important because atmospheric inputs are very dynamic and variable with time and can induce temporally high concentrations in the water column. Therefore, the models needed for studying these interactions should be dynamic (not at equilibrium or steady state) {{in order to be able}} to be able to predict the high observed environmental variability, and thus able to predict episodes were potential threshold values are obtained. Furthermore, these models should also be able to take into account the interactions between fate and impact of pollutants and trophic status, which allows studying together the two drivers considered within the Thresholds IP (nutrients and pollutants). The models reviewed here are those of the three main atmospheric deposition processes; namely dry aerosol deposition, wet deposition and diffusive exchanges. Furthermore the current knowledge of the accumulation processes and cycling of organic pollutants in phytoplankton is reviewed. There are few reports of the quantification and parameterization of accumulation and cycling of POPs in bacteria and zooplankton. Here, novel results obtained for zooplankton within the threshold IP are presented which suggest an important role of these in POP cycling. It is identified that more research is needed on the role of bacteria in the impact of POPs in aquatic food webs. One of the issues that previous models were not able to assess is the relative importance of atmospheric inputs and inputs from sediments of POPs in food webs. Sediments are known to be a source of pollutants for benthic food webs, but their influence is not clear in the pelagic zone. The 1 D model developed within Thresholds allows to elucidate the relative importance of these two sources of pollutants for the first time. It is shown that the atmosphere is the main contributor for the most part of the water column, except for very shallow ecosystems. Furthermore, some of the interactions between trophic status and atmospheric inputs as provided by models are also reviewed here. The present review will allow in the next future to couple these models with toxicity models including the concepts of thresholds in order to identify whether <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>no</b> <b>return</b> and thresholds do happen in ecosystems due to pollutants as a driver.
