2500|$|Published in 2006, Evangelical Lutheran Worship is {{the main}} hymnal used in congregations. Some congregations, however, {{continue}} to use the older Lutheran Book of Worship published by the Inter-Lutheran Commission on Worship in 1978, and some even continue to use the older Service Book and Hymnal (SBH) of 1958 or its antecedent precedent-setting Common Service of 1888 which laid out a traditional American Lutheran liturgy and later was included in subsequent worship books and hymnals of various churches especially The Common Service Book of 1917, adopted by the old United Lutheran Church in America, a predecessor of the LCA to 1962, and The Lutheran Hymnal (TLH-1941) of the LCMS. Many congregations also make use of supplementary resources recently published as well besides those authorized for the LBW by Augsburg-Fortress, Publishers. Many ELCA congregations are classically liturgical churches. Their liturgy {{is rooted in the}} Western liturgical tradition, though recent international Lutheran-Orthodox dialog sessions have had some minimal influence on Lutheran liturgy. Because of its use of the Book of Concord of 1580, with the Confessions, documents and beliefs of the Reformers, including the Augsburg Confession of 1530, Luther's Small Catechism of 1529 and the Large Catechism and its retention of many pre-Reformation traditions, such as vestments, feast days and the celebration of the Church Year, the sign of the cross, and the usage of a church-wide liturgy, there are many aspects of the typical ELCA church that are very catholic and traditional in nature. Many Evangelical Lutheran churches use traditional vestments (cassock, surplice, stole for services of the Word or non-Eucharistic liturgies or alb, cincture, stole, chasuble (pastor) or dalmatic (deacon), cope (processions) for Eucharists (Mass, Holy Communion), etc.). On special rare occasions even a bishop's cross/crozier and mitre (bishop's headpiece) have been used to designate the ancient robes and traditions of the Church originating in Roman times of which Luther and his fellow Reformers like Phillip Melancthon considered as [...] "adiaphora" [...] or of <b>permissive</b> <b>use.</b> Since the Second Vatican Council of the 1960s, most major parts of the ELCA's popular liturgies are worded exactly like the English language Mass of 1970 of the Roman Catholic Church. Many ELCA congregations use informal styles of worship or a blend of traditional and contemporary liturgical forms.|$|E

Part II includes a discussion of the current law of error analysis in the federal courts and recent trends in that area of law. Part III consists of a review of the Supreme Court case law involving error analysis and peremptory challenges. This Part examines the specific situation, and the specific feature of Oklahoma law, that led to Ross. That feature is critical in limiting Ross. With that interpretation of Ross in mind, Part IV turns to the courts 2 ̆ 7 responses to related situations, contrasting those interpreting Ross as a broad directive with those that limit it to its procedural posture. The Author concludes that the latter courts are correct in viewing Ross as by no means the final word in consideration of error involving peremptory challenges. The former courts fail to recognize the unique situation faced by the Ross court as laid out in Part lll; without such recognition, they fail to distinguish the cases they face from Ross. Part V concludes that Ross can and should be limited in a principled way to the context in which a state, in its peremptory challenge scheme, has chosen to impose two separate policy goals for peremptory challenges by requiring a litigant to use a peremptory challenge to preserve error in deciding a challenge for cause...|$|E
40|$|The Anti-Injunction Act of 1867 (AIA or the Act) {{has never}} been more important. Originally enacted to {{expedite}} the collection of revenue-raising taxes, courts and scholars have for years assumed that the statute imposes a jurisdictional bar on any pre-enforcement challenge to a tax. On this interpretation, taxpayers subject to an invalid tax have two choices only: comply or pay the tax and pursue a refund. Read this way, the Act is a marked departure from the general rule that pre-enforcement challenges are permissible so long as justiciability requirements are met. And it imposes a marked burden on aggrieved taxpayers that grows all the more significant as the federal government regulates more and more activity through the tax code. This Article argues that the conventional wisdom is wrong. Scholars—and courts—have too readily relied on the Supreme Court’s past <b>permissive</b> <b>use</b> of the term jurisdiction. But the Supreme Court has recently backed away from this jurisprudence, and more to the point, the traditional tools of statutory interpretation indicate that the AIA is not jurisdictional after all— at least, not in the traditional way. This Article examines the text, structure, history, and early interpretation of the AIA and comes to a novel conclusion: the Act is not jurisdictional in the usual sense, but rather governs the equity jurisdiction of the federal courts. While “equity jurisdiction” is now a term unfamiliar to us, it governed the exercise of extraordinary remedies like injunctions for over a century. And it functioned much differently than jurisdiction does today. That the AIA refers to equity jurisdiction will change the landscape of tax litigation: contrary to the conventional wisdom, preenforcement tax challenges may go forward where the government waives or forfeits reliance on the AIA and in certain extraordinary circumstances...|$|E

To this end, we use a variation of IC 3, called Tree-IC 3, as a bug finder to solve the supervisory predicate control problem by iteratively reporting all feasible counterexample traces using a tree-like search, while controlling the system to avoid them. The maximally permissiveness is achieved by finding the weakest of such controllers that is invariant under safety and control properties.

We previously found that the evolution of cortisol specificity in the ancestral glucocorticoid receptor (GR) was contingent on permissive substitutions, which had no apparent effect on receptor function but were necessary for GR to tolerate the large-effect mutations that caused the shift in specificity. 6 Here we show that alternative mutations that could have permitted the historical function-switching substitutions are extremely rare in the ensemble of genotypes accessible to the ancestral GR.
