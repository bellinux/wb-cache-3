5|$|Franklin <b>points</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{technological}} {{nature of}} war requires states to conscript the {{resources needed to}} pay for hi-tech devices designed for destruction. Thus, people opposed to war are forced—through taxation—to pay for war preparations even if it violates their individual conscience.|$|E
5|$|Building {{a castle}} {{sometimes}} required {{the permission of}} the king or other high authority. In 864 the King of West Francia, Charles the Bald, prohibited the construction of castella without his permission and ordered them all to be destroyed. This is perhaps the earliest reference to castles, though military historian R. Allen Brown <b>points</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> word castella may have applied to any fortification at the time.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{peculiar}} fact {{associated with the}} episode was a letter by Senator Hillary Clinton and Representative John M. McHugh addressed to show character Josh Lyman, concerning the closing of an upstate New York army base. Josh <b>points</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> deep-snow training base of Fort Drum is relatively useless {{in a time when}} most wars take place in desert terrain. Clinton and McHugh wrote a tongue-in-cheek response pointing out flaws in Lyman’s reasoning.|$|E

5|$|The author Rupert Christiansen <b>points</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{painting}} depicts more figures {{than had}} been on the raft {{at the time of the}} rescue—including corpses which were not recorded by the rescuers. Instead of the sunny morning and calm water reported on the day of the rescue, Géricault depicted a gathering storm and dark, heaving sea to reinforce the emotional gloom.|$|E
5|$|The form of {{this ancient}} Greek poetry is an elegiac couplet, {{commonly}} used for epitaphs. Some English renderings are given in the table below. It is also an example of Laconian brevity, a spartan style of verse that allows for varying interpretations {{of the meaning of}} the poem. Ioannis Ziogas <b>points</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> usual English translations are far from the only interpretation possible, and indicate much about the romantic tendencies of the translators.|$|E

5|$|The {{historian}} Ted Johnson Smith <b>points</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Codicellus {{has strong}} parallels to the Historia de Sancto Cuthberto. The Historia {{was written in}} Durham in the mid-10th century, and {{is a history of}} the monastery of St. Cuthbert from foundation until about 945. Like the Codicellus, it is a narrative concerned mainly to defend the patrimony of the monks against depredations.|$|E
5|$|Violent crime, {{including}} murder, {{has occurred}} on the trail in a few instances. Most have been crimes by non-hikers who crossed paths relatively randomly with the AT hiker-victims. The official website of the Appalachian Trail Conservancy <b>points</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> number of violent crimes is extremely low when compared against {{the number of people}} (3 to 4 million) who hike on the trail every year.|$|E
5|$|However, both Clinton and Larson {{present the}} {{possibility}} that Margaret was in fact Tubman's daughter. Larson <b>points</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> two shared an unusually strong bond, and argues that Tubman – knowing the pain of a child separated from her mother – would never have intentionally caused a free family to be split apart. Clinton presents evidence of strong physical similarities, which Alice herself acknowledged. Both historians agree that no concrete evidence exists for such a possibility, and the mystery of Tubman's relationship with young Margaret remains to this day.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the significant lack of genetic diversity in cheetahs is a cause of poor quality and production of sperm, and birth defects such as cramped teeth, kinked tails, and bent limbs. Cheetahs do have low fertility rates, but they appear to have flourished for thousands of years with these low levels of genetic variance. Cheetah expert Laurie Marker <b>points</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> high level of genetic uniformity would mean that if an infectious disease surfaced in a population, all of them have (or lack) the same level of immunity. In 1982, 60% of the cheetah population in the Wildlife Safari (Oregon, United States) died due to a peritonitis epidemic.|$|E
5|$|Mary's biographers, such as Antonia Fraser, Alison Weir, and John Guy, {{have come}} to the {{conclusion}} that either the documents were complete forgeries, or incriminating passages were inserted into genuine letters, or that the letters were written to Bothwell by some other person or by Mary to some other person. Guy <b>points</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> letters are disjointed, and that the French language and grammar employed in the sonnets are too poor for a writer with Mary's education. However, certain phrases of the letters (including verses in the style of Ronsard) and certain characteristics of style would be compatible with known writings of Mary.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{critical}} commentary varies. One critic <b>points</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{faces of}} the rabbits are expressionless while another argues that the cock of an ear or {{the position of a}} tail conveys what the faces lack. One critic believes the tale lacks the vitality of The Tale of Peter Rabbit which sprang from a picture and story letter to a child. Most agree though that the depictions of the garden are exquisite and some of the finest illustrations Potter created.|$|E

5|$|Oslac's origins {{are unclear}} and no {{specific}} relationship with any previous known figure {{can be established}} from available sources. Oslac's name suggests to some historians {{that he was a}} Norseman. Dorothy Whitelock <b>points</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> name Oslac is often an anglicisation of the Old Scandinavian name Áslákr, while the writers of the Biographical Dictionary of Dark Age Britain entry on Oslac comment that the name suggests an origin in the Danelaw, a suggestion supported by the fact that Thored, Oslac's son, held lands in Cambridgeshire.|$|E
5|$|Peggy and Al {{return home}} {{and show the}} tape to Steve and Marcy, who are embarrassed by the film, much {{to the delight of}} the Bundys. The Rhoades express their dismay that they were {{secretly}} recorded, but Steve <b>points</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Bundys may have been videotaped as well. Marcy and Al are upset by this violation of their privacy and propose physical violence against the owners of the motel. Steve and Peg, on the other hand, want to take action against the Hop-On-Inn and make money from the incident.|$|E
5|$|The Great Plague {{epidemic}} of 1665 {{is believed to}} have killed a sixth of London's inhabitants, or 80,000 people, and it is sometimes suggested that the fire saved lives in the long run by burning down so much unsanitary housing with their rats and their fleas which transmitted the plague, as plague epidemics did not recur in London after the fire. Historians disagree as to whether the fire played a part in preventing subsequent major outbreaks. The Museum of London website claims that there was a connection, while historian Roy Porter <b>points</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> fire left the most insalubrious parts of London, the slum suburbs, untouched.|$|E

5|$|The family disapproves of {{his first}} few inventions, {{including}} a make-up shotgun, electric hammer, alarm that never stops beeping, and reclining chair with a built-in toilet, making Homer more depressed. However, they like one particular invention, a chair with two hinged legs on the back, {{making it impossible to}} tip over backwards. Homer is encouraged until he notices his poster of Edison shows him sitting in the same type of chair. Bart <b>points</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> chair is not featured on a list of Edison's inventions, meaning he never told anyone of this invention.|$|E
5|$|The {{paintings}} on the back wall are recognized as representing Minerva Punishing Arachne and Apollo's Victory Over Marsyas. Both stories involve Minerva, the Goddess of Wisdom and patron of the arts. These two legends are both stories of mortals challenging gods and the dreadful consequences. One scholar <b>points</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> legend dealing with two women, Minerva and Arachne, is {{on the same side}} of the mirror as the queen's reflection while the male legend is on the side of the king.|$|E
5|$|There existed a {{hierarchy}} of pay between types of auxiliary, with cavalry higher paid than infantry. One recent estimate {{is that in the}} time of Augustus, the annual pay structure was: eques alaris (gregalis) 263 denarii, eques cohortalis 225, and cohors infantryman 188. The same differentials (of about 20% between grades) seem to have existed at the time of Domitian (r. 81-96). However, Goldsworthy <b>points</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> common assumption that rates of pay were universal across provinces and units is unproven. Pay may have varied according to the origin of the unit.|$|E
