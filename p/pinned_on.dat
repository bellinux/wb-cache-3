5|$|The {{leader of}} the Congolese {{province}} of Katanga, Moise Tshombe, requested British and Rhodesian forces to enter the country to restore order. Welensky was sympathetic to the situation but unable to act; the British government, which had ultimate jurisdiction over the federation, disallowed him from mobilising the armed forces. Tshombe declared Katanga unilaterally independent on 11 July, one day after requesting British and Rhodesian assistance. Welensky pleaded with Macmillan to deploy the Rhodesian forces but Macmillan rebuffed him, telling Welensky their hopes were <b>pinned</b> <b>on</b> the United Nations being able to restore order, and hoping for a wholly neutral or anti-communist Congo. United Nations Secretary General Dag Hammarskjöld, hoping to negotiate a solution to Katanga's secession, agreed to meet Tshombe at Ndola. However, Hammarskjöld's plane crashed close to Ndola, and he was killed. Welensky was subsequently blamed for the accident throughout the communist and Afro-Asian world, becoming a hated figure and a lingering symbol of colonialism. Welensky's attitude towards Katanga and the Congo would strain relations between the federation and the British until its dissolution.|$|E
5|$|An Enclosure Act is a {{parliamentary}} authority to fence-off common land, thus making that land private property, while awarding commoners land in compensation. Inclosure {{is the name}} given to the parliamentary statute thus created. The enclosure process began in the 13th century and was supported by Acts of Parliament from 1640. In November 1833, the Isle of Ely intended to apply for Acts of Parliament to enclose the lands of Little Thetford. Officials arrived in the village armed {{with nothing more than}} a notice to be <b>pinned</b> <b>on</b> the Church of England's St. George's church door, but were prevented from doing so by a dozen villagers. They returned later with ten constables, authorised by Ely magistrates, and were confronted this time by 150stick-wielding protesters, who continued to prevent due process. When the clergyman, Henry Hervey Baber, arrived the following afternoon, he was prevented from carrying out his normal Sunday service. Villagers may have rebelled against the church at this time, perhaps believing it was acting on behalf of the establishment in the enclosure acts. This event may have been the trigger that, five years later, encouraged a strong Baptist following amongst the poorer villagers. About half the total area of Little Thetford was eventually enclosed in 1844, seven years after that of Stretham.|$|E

5|$|The 26th Infantry's initial {{attack on}} 13 October {{provided}} important insight {{on the nature}} of the fighting; American infantry had been ambushed by German defenders using sewers and cellars, forcing the advancing American infantry to clear each opening before continuing down streets, while Sherman tanks found it impossible to maneuver to suppress enemy fire. German civilians were cleared as the 26th Infantry advanced; no Germans were allowed to remain in the Americans' rear. Success in Aachen was measured by the number of houses captured, as the advance proved to be sluggish; in order to cope with the thick walls of the older buildings in the city, the 26th Infantry Regiment used howitzers at point blank range to destroy German fortifications. The howitzer created passageways that allowed infantrymen to advance from building to building without having to enter the city's streets, where they could be pinned down by enemy fire. Sherman tanks were ambushed, as they entered intersections, by concealed German anti-tank guns. Soon thereafter, American tanks and other armored vehicles would advance cautiously, often shooting buildings ahead of the accompanying infantry to clear them of possible defenders. <b>Pinned</b> <b>on</b> the surface by Allied aircraft, German infantrymen would use sewers to deploy behind American formations to attack them from the rear. German resistance was fierce, as they launched small counterattacks and used armor to halt American movements.|$|E

Five days later, a series of skits aired on Thunder in which Glacier, tired of his gimmick, sold his armor, mask, and helmet to Kaz Hayashi and Miller; Onoo convinced the gullible Hayashi to buy the gear for ten times Glacier's asking price. For a short time, Miller came out to Glacier's music and entrance, while Hayashi wore his armor and mask to the ring.|$|E
25|$|On Election Day, {{the result}} hinges on Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Ohio. Contrary to the Underwoods' desired plans, the early returns seem to favor Conway.

With Pennsylvania secured by Conway and Ohio seeming to swing his way, Frank unofficially calls Conway directly to concede. However, this is merely a tactic to put Conway off guard, as the Underwoods contact Ohio's governor and convince him to close the polls early on the pretense of a terrorist threat. Ohio and Tennessee refuse to certify the election, and neither candidate reaches the requisite number of electoral votes.|$|E

25|$|When Caine {{was nine}} he lost {{two of his}} young sisters within a year. Five year old Sarah {{developed}} hydrocephaly after a fever. Fourteen month old Emma died in convulsions brought on by whooping cough she caught from him and his brother John. Caine was {{to be sent to}} the Isle of Man to recover from his illness and grief. He was put on a boat to Ramsey by his father, with a label <b>pinned</b> <b>on</b> his coat and assurances that his uncle would meet him. A fierce storm occurred preventing the ferry from reaching land. Caine was rescued by a large rowing boat. He would later draw on this experience when writing the scene in The Bondman in which Stephen Orry is cast ashore there.|$|E
25|$|Suez alienated academics, {{journalists and}} other opinion-formers from the Conservative Party. William Rees-Mogg, then a Conservative {{candidate}} in the North-East, made a speech urging that Macleod be party leader. David Astor of The Observer, who on 4 November had attacked Eden for “crookedness” in an editorial, wrote to Macleod on 14 November, urging him as a younger minister to seize the party leadership so that collusion could be <b>pinned</b> <b>on</b> Eden and Lloyd, after Edward Boyle {{had told him that}} he was not interested and that Monckton was not up to it. Macleod did not reply but showed the letter to Freddie Bishop, head of the Prime Minister's Private Office, and Cabinet Secretary Norman Brook for their comments; Eden, who {{was on the verge of}} a breakdown, did not regard the matter as important. On 20 November 1956 the question of collusion was raised in Cabinet, with Eden and Lloyd (who was in New York at a United Nations meeting) both absent; Shepherd believes that it was probably Macleod who raised it. The Cabinet agreed to stick to Lloyd’s formula that Britain had not incited the Israeli attack on Egypt.|$|E
25|$|The French {{artillery}} train having arrived, Colonel James Grant {{proposed that}} the castle should be attacked from the classic direction of the town cemetery where the guns would be nearly level with the fortifications. However, Prince Charles was allegedly afraid that the return fire from the castle would wreck the town of Stirling and therefore opted for an alternative that was offered by the Franco-Scottish engineer Mirabelle de Gordon, who had arrived with Lord John Drummond. Mirablle de Gordon stated that an attack from the little Gowan Hill, which lay hard under the north-eastern side of the castle, which would be totally dominated by whatever cannon the besiegers might choose to fire against it. The bedrock at this location however, was only 15 inches below the surface {{making it difficult for}} the besiegers to throw up effective cover, and the ramparts of the castle on this side were {{at the top of a}} near vertical cliff which would make it impossible even for the agile Highlanders to scale. The Prince accepted Mirabelle de Gordon’s advice and in doing so is probably the tactical mistake that can be most firmly <b>pinned</b> <b>on</b> him.|$|E

25|$|The chlamys, a semicircular cloak {{fastened}} to the right shoulder continued throughout the period. The length fell sometimes only to the hips or {{as far as the}} ankles, much longer than the version commonly worn in Ancient Greece; the longer version is also called a paludamentum. As well as his courtiers, Emperor Justinian wears one, with a huge brooch, in the Ravenna mosaics. On each straight edge men of the senatorial class had a tablion, a lozenge shaped coloured panel across the chest or midriff (at the front), which was also used to show the further rank of the wearer by the colour or type of embroidery and jewels used (compare those of Justinian and his courtiers). Theodosius I and his co-emperors were shown in 388 with theirs at knee level in the Missorium of Theodosius I of 387, but over the next decades the tablion can be seen to move higher on the Chlamys, for example in ivories of 413-414. A paragauda or border of thick cloth, usually including gold, was also an indicator of rank. Sometimes an oblong cloak would be worn, especially by the military and ordinary people; it was not for court occasions. Cloaks were <b>pinned</b> <b>on</b> the right shoulder for ease of movement, and access to a sword.|$|E
