50|$|The <b>purificator</b> (purificatorium or more anciently emunctorium) is a {{white linen}} cloth {{which is used to}} wipe the chalice after each communicant partakes. It is also used to wipe the chalice and paten after the ablutions which follow Communion.|$|E
50|$|There {{are usually}} {{one or two}} communion cloths (houselling cloths) kept on the Holy Table. These are made of cotton or some similar {{material}} {{that can be easily}} washed and are often dyed red. They are used like the Western <b>purificator</b> to wipe the lips of the communicants and to dry the chalice and other sacred vessels after the ablutions.|$|E
50|$|In the Roman Rite, the offertory is {{the first}} part of the Liturgy of the Eucharist. The altar is first {{prepared}} by placing on it the corporal, <b>purificator,</b> missal and chalice. The bread and wine, and perhaps other offerings or gifts for the poor or for the Church, are presented by the faithful in a procession to the accompaniment of an offertory chant. The priest places first the bread and then the wine on the altar while saying the prescribed prayers, after which he may incense them together with the cross and the altar. The priest and the people may also be incensed. After washing his hands at the side of the altar, the priest says the Prayer over the Offerings. This was originally the only prayer said at the offertory of the Roman Rite.|$|E
25|$|Beginning of the Liturgy of the Eucharist: Servers {{arrange the}} corporal, the <b>purificator(s),</b> the chalice(s), the pall, and the Missal on the altar, and then assist the priest in {{receiving}} {{the bread and}} wine and perhaps other gifts that are presented to him. They present the cruets of wine and water for the priest or deacon to pour some into the chalice. If incense is used, the thurible and incense are presented to the priest and, after he has incensed the offerings, the cross and the altar, the deacon or a server incenses the priest and the people. When the priest then washes his hands standing {{at the side of}} the altar, a server pours the water over them.|$|R
5000|$|Sacristies usually {{contain a}} special wash basin, called a piscina, the drain {{of which is}} {{properly}} called a [...] "sacrarium" [...] in which the drain flows directly into the ground to prevent sacred items such as used baptismal water from being washed into the sewers or septic tanks. The piscina is used to wash linens used during {{the celebration of the}} Mass and <b>purificators</b> used during Holy Communion. The cruets, chalice, ciborium, paten, altar linens and sometimes the Holy Oils are kept inside the sacristy. Sacristies are usually off limits to the general public. The word [...] "sacristy" [...] derives from the Latin sacristia, sometimes spelled sacrastia, which is in turn derived from sacrista ("sexton, sacristan"), from sacra ("holy").|$|R
40|$|Multiproduct batch plants (MBPs), {{also known}} as {{specialty}} plants, are capable Of sequentially producing small amounts {{of a large number}} of different products. These plants are commonly used for producing very high value products such as fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals etc. The most important features that make MBPs particularly attractive are their inherent flexibility and the ability to respond quickly to the changing market demands. Owing this inherent flexibility, in MBPs several products share the same units (for e. g., reactors, <b>purificators</b> etc.). There are examples of MBPs where even hundreds of products are processed in the same unit. This mandates the need for proper control of these plants so as to utilize the available resources efficiently and achieve maximum profit. The optimal control problem for the MBPs can be formally stated as: given the dynamic model for each of the processes, available units (reactors, <b>purificators</b> etc.) along with their capacity limits, the storage policy (zero-wait, unlimited intermediate storage etc.) to be followed and available storage capacity for each of the materials, determine the optimal sequence of tasks taking place on each unit, the amount of material being processed and the duration of each task on each unit, so as to achieve the desired objective (maximization of profit, minimization of make-span etc.) while satisfying the market demands within the given time horizon. The above mentioned optimal control problem of MBPs is a highly non-trivial hybrid control problem as it involves both discrete and continuous decisions. In practice, approaches based on standard production recipes are used, where first the recipes are standardized either empirically or via single batch optimization (using the dynamic models of each of the processes) and then the control problem is formulated on the basis of these standardized recipes. However, standardization of recipes removes degrees of freedom from the system and hence the solutions obtained with this approach can be suboptimal as they are confined to pre-determined standard production recipes. Another major disadvantage of these standard recipe based approaches arises from the fact that there are no standard guidelines available for deciding what a suitable standard recipe should be. For the same process there can be several conflicting recipes and there is no way to decide which one of these recipes would be the most suitable for the overall control problem formulation. The ``ideal approach'' for the optimal control of MBPs is to include the dynamic model of each of the processes directly into the control problem formulation instead of standardized production recipes. This restores the additional degrees of freedom of the system (which were otherwise removed due to the standardization of the production recipe) and hence this approach potentially yields solutions that are usually much better or at least as good as that obtained with the standard recipe based approaches. However, direct inclusion of the dynamic models, which are usually differential algebraic equations (DAEs), results in a ``large'' nonlinear mixed-integer dynamic optimization (MIDO) problem. The combinatorial complexity of MBPs and lack of standard solution methods for MIDO problems render this approach computationally intractable for real world problems. This mandates the need for novel approaches which can yield better solutions than the existing standard recipe based approaches and at the same time are computationally tractable for real world problems. An improved approach for the optimal control of MBPs, which, by imposing a suitable solution structure reduces the degrees of freedom of the system while only slightly affecting the achievable performance, is proposed in this work. This approach helps to recover the solution theoretically obtainable by the ``ideal approach'' more closely than that by the standard recipe approach while keeping a lid on the complexity. The effectiveness of this approach is illustrated with the help of several application examples...|$|R
5000|$|In the Tridentine Mass, the rubrics for Low Mass form obliged {{the priest}} {{to begin by}} {{carrying}} with him from the sacristy to the altar the chalice, upon which was placed the <b>purificator,</b> paten and pall, all of these covered with a chalice veil and surmounted by a burse (known in Old English as a [...] "corporas-case") containing the corporal. The burse was a folder made of two square pieces of cardboard laid {{one on top of}} the other and bound together along one edge to form a hinge. The two pieces were attached with cloth along the two sides adjacent to the hinge, leaving the fourth end open to receive the corporal. At the end of Mass, the priest carried all these back to the sacristy, arranged after the same fashion. The present General Instruction of the Roman Missal does not envisage the use of a burse.|$|E
