5|$|Because <b>pure</b> <b>silver</b> is very soft, most silver {{used for}} these {{purposes}} is alloyed with copper, with finenesses of 925/1000, 835/1000, and 800/1000 being common. One drawback is the easy tarnishing of {{silver in the}} presence of hydrogen sulfide and its derivatives. Including precious metals such as palladium, platinum, and gold gives resistance to tarnishing but is quite costly; base metals like zinc, cadmium, silicon, and germanium do not totally prevent corrosion and tend to affect the lustre and colour of the alloy. Electrolytically refined <b>pure</b> <b>silver</b> plating is effective at increasing resistance to tarnishing. The usual solutions for restoring the lustre of tarnished silver are dipping baths that reduce the silver sulfide surface to metallic silver, and cleaning off the layer of tarnish with a paste; the latter approach also has the welcome side effect of polishing the silver concurrently.|$|E

Traditional Pakistani and Indian dishes sometimes include decorative silver foil known as vark, and in various other cultures, silver dragée are used to decorate cakes, cookies, and other dessert items.|$|E
5|$|Also {{starting}} with Endubis these coins were 2.11-2.5grams in weight which {{is half the}} weight of a Roman antoninianus of 3.5-4.5 grams. A Denarius in the early 3rd century was 2.5-3.00grams of 52 percent or less of silver, but the Aksum coins were almost <b>pure</b> <b>silver</b> at first later debased. The name is unknown so it is referred to as an AR Unit.|$|E

5|$|Anglo-Saxons kings {{produced}} coins {{from the}} 620s onwards, initially in gold, {{but then in}} electrum (an alloy of gold and silver) and eventually <b>pure</b> <b>silver.</b> Little is known of the organisation of coinage {{during the reign of}} Beonna, but it can be presumed that the moneyers who struck coins during this period acted {{under the auspices of the}} king, who would to some extent have supervised the design of his coins. A growing shortage of available bullion in north-western Europe during the first half of the 8th century was probably the main cause for a deterioration in the proportion of precious metal found in locally produced sceattas. In around 740, Eadberht of Northumbria became the first king to respond to this crisis by issuing a remodelled coinage, of a consistent weight and a high proportion of silver, which eventually replaced the debased currency. Other kings followed his example, including Beonna and the Frankish king Pepin the Short, who appears to have been strongly influenced by the newly introduced coins of both Beonna and Eadberht.|$|E
5|$|The soldier's sole {{substantial}} {{disposable income}} {{came from the}} donativa, or cash bonuses handed out periodically by the emperors, as these were paid in gold solidi (which were never debased), or in <b>pure</b> <b>silver.</b> There was a regular donative of 5 solidi every five years of an Augustus reign (i.e. one solidus p.a.) Also, on the accession of a new Augustus, 5 solidi plus a pound of silver (worth 4 solidi, totaling 9 solidi) were paid. The 12 Augusti that ruled the West between 284 and 395 averaged about nine years per reign. Thus the accession donatives would have averaged about 1 solidus p.a. The late soldier's disposable income would thus have averaged at least 2 solidi per annum. It is also possible, but undocumented, that the accession bonus was paid for each Augustus and/or a bonus for each Caesar. The documented income of 2 solidi was {{only a quarter of}} the disposable income of a 2nd-century legionary (which was the equivalent of c. 8 solidi). The late soldier's discharge package (which included a small plot of land) was also minuscule compared with a 2nd-century legionary's, worth just a tenth of the latter's.|$|E

25|$|Contemporary {{religious}} authorities {{believe that}} the Shekel HaKodesh (Holy Shekel) of the Temple was larger and of <b>purer</b> <b>silver</b> content than the standard Shekel used for trade in ancient Israel. Halakha requires that the coins used have a requisite total amount of actual silver. There are varying opinions as to the correct amount of silver, they fall in between 100grams and 117grams. Coins which do not contain the requisite amount of silver do not result in a valid redemption.|$|R
40|$|The {{synthesis}} and the morphological {{transformations of}} <b>pure</b> and <b>silver</b> loaded titanate nanotubes into anatase titania nanostructures under relatively mild temperatures (500 °C) have been discussed. At first, {{it will be}} shown that the transformation of titanate into titanium oxide leads {{to the formation of}} TiO 2 particles, and then the role of the silver, in affecting morphology, crystallinity, and optical properties of the nanostructures, is highlighted. Morphology and structure of the titanate precursor and of the formed TiO 2 particles (both <b>pure</b> or <b>silver</b> loaded) have been investigated by means of Brunauer-Emmett-Teller and powder X-ray diffraction analyses, high resolution transmission electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. Surface and optical properties have been explored by means of Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopies. With regard to the vibrational properties of the obtained materials, the comparison of FTIR features of adsorbed CO on <b>pure</b> and <b>silver</b> exchanged titanates, with respect to <b>pure</b> and <b>silver</b> loaded TiO 2, have been reported for the first time. It will be shown that all the materials (as prepared, either in the hydrogen or in the silver exchanged form and those obtained after thermal treatments) show better properties than the commercial TiO 2 precursor and in general than those obtained by solid state reactions (P 25), in terms of specific surface area and porosity. 1...|$|R

25|$|These {{difficulties}} {{were eliminated}} in 570 BCE when <b>pure</b> <b>silver</b> coins were introduced. However, electrum currency remained common until approximately 350 BCE.

50|$|Friedrich Deusch {{invented a}} way to combine silver and a {{non-conductive}} surface such as porcelain or glass with galvanization. He achieved this with a special conductive fluid (a type of flux) which was fixed permanently on the prepared form. The particular objects (such as a vase) were first roughened by engraving or using hydrofluoric acid to etch a design. This implies that a very exact covering of the surfaces had to be achieved to prevent any damage to areas which {{were not to be}} overlaid. Maybe they used a masking lacquer which could withstand the following baking in the kiln which was used to fuse the flux with the surface of the item. The next step was to galvanize the item with the <b>purest</b> <b>silver</b> (1000).|$|R
5000|$|Silver coins {{include the}} one ounce 99.99% <b>pure</b> Canadian <b>Silver</b> Maple Leaf {{and the one}} ounce 99.93% <b>pure</b> American <b>Silver</b> Eagle. Coins may be minted as either fine silver or junk silver, the latter being older coins made of 90% silver. U.S. coins 1964 and older (half dollars, dimes, and quarters) are {{generally}} accepted to weigh 24.71 grams of silver per dollar of face value, which at their nominal silver content of 90%, translates to 22.239 g of silver per dollar. All U.S. dimes, quarters, halves and 1 dollar pieces contained 90% silver since their introduction up until 1964 when they were discontinued. The combined mintage of these coins by weight exceeds by far the mintages of all other silver investment coins.|$|R
25|$|In an act {{passed in}} January 1837, the dollar's alloy (amount of non-silver metal present) {{was set at}} 15%. Subsequent coins would contain {{the same amount of}} <b>pure</b> <b>silver</b> as previously, but were reduced in overall weight (to 412.25 grains). On February 21, 1853, the {{quantity}} of silver in the lesser coins was reduced, with the effect that their denominations no longer represented their silver content relative to dollar coins.|$|E
25|$|Fine silver, {{for example}} 99.9% <b>pure</b> <b>silver,</b> is {{relatively}} soft, so silver is usually alloyed with copper {{to increase its}} hardness and strength. Sterling silver is prone to tarnishing, and metals other than copper {{can be used in}} alloys to reduce tarnishing, as well as casting porosity and firescale. Such metals include germanium, zinc, platinum, silicon, and boron. Recent examples of alloys using these metals include Argentium, Sterlium, Sterilite, and Silvadium.|$|E
