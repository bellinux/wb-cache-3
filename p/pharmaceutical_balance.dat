40|$|Background: Prefilled insulin pens {{have become}} a {{convenient}} and accurate way for diabetes patients to inject insulin. Their ease of use has helped to reduce the resistance of patients with type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes in the United States and Europe toward initiation of insulin therapy. This study compared the dosing accuracy of two prefilled insulin pens (the SoloStar ® from Sanofi Aventis, Berlin, Germany, and the Next Generation [NG] FlexPen ® from Novo Nordisk, Mainz, Germany). Methods: The dosing accuracy was tested for both pens with 24 x 10 international units of insulin (IU) and 9 x 30 IU injection volumes to investigate whether the pens comply within the acceptable International Organization for Standardization (ISO) limits of 10 % (± 1 IU) for 10 IU and 5 % (± 1. 5 IU) for 30 IU. The doses were applied each with a new needle strictly according to the instructions {{for use of the}} pen manufacturers. A sensitive <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>balance</b> was used for the assessment of the applied volumes, and the results were corrected for the specific density of the insulin formulations. We used 18 insulin pens (from two different production lots each) for the two volumes, respectively, resulting in a total of 432 doses per pen with 10 IU and 162 dose...|$|E
40|$|To {{increase}} revenues, {{pharmaceutical companies}} {{rely heavily on}} their sales forces to promote new and existing drugs to physicians. Compensation for sales representatives is largely commission based. However, individual effort {{may not be the}} driving force behind compensation. Sales representatives might be unfairly rewarded only because they are assigned to physicians with high sales potential. Given a set of physicians and representatives, a mathematical program is developed to maximize profit for the <b>pharmaceutical</b> company, while <b>balancing</b> both workload and sales opportunities for representatives. The model is valuable for daily operational decisions. The methodology applies to any multi-product sales-force based industry...|$|R
50|$|Pharmaceutical {{medicine}} {{is a medical}} discipline concerned with the discovery, evaluation, registration, monitoring and clinical aspects of pharmaceutical development. All medical specialties overlap to some extent, and likewise the boundaries of pharmaceutical medicine are elastic. But, at its centre is the clinical testing of medicines, translation of pharmaceutical drug research into new medicines, safety and well-being of patients and research participants in clinical trials, and understanding the safety profile of medicines and their benefit-risk <b>balance.</b> <b>Pharmaceutical</b> physicians work in the pharmaceutical industry, universities / medical schools, drug regulatory authorities and contract research organisations, but have a close affinity with their medical colleagues elsewhere.|$|R
40|$|Background Professionalism {{has been}} an {{important}} tenet of medical education, yet defining it is a challenge. Perceptions of professional behavior may vary by individual, medical specialty, demographic group and institution. Understanding these differences should help institutions better clarify professionalism expectations and provide standards with which to evaluate resident behavior. Methods Duke University Hospital and Vidant Medical Center/East Carolina University surveyed entering PGY 1 residents. Residents were queried on two issues: their perception of the professionalism of 46 specific behaviors related to training and patient care; and their own participation in those specified behaviors. The study reports data analyses for gender and institution based upon survey results in 2009 and 2010. The study received approval by the Institutional Review Boards of both institutions. Results 76 % (375) of 495 PGY 1 residents surveyed in 2009 and 2010 responded. A majority of responders rated all 46 specified behaviors as unprofessional, and a majority had either observed or participated in each behavior. For all 46 behaviors, a greater percentage of women rated the behaviors as unprofessional. Men were more likely than women to have participated in behaviors. There were several significant differences in both the perceptions of specified behaviors and in self-reported observation of and/or involvement in those behaviors between institutions. Respondents indicated the most important professionalism issues relevant to medical practice include: respect for colleagues/patients, relationships with <b>pharmaceutical</b> companies, <b>balancing</b> home/work life, and admitting mistakes. They reported that professionalism can best be assessed by peers, patients, observation of non-medical work and timeliness/detail of paperwork. Conclusion Defining professionalism in measurable terms is a challenge yet critical in order for it to be taught and assessed. Recognition of the differences by gender and institution should allow for tailored teaching and assessment of professionalism so that it is most meaningful. A shared understanding of what constitutes professional behavior is an important first step...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper will}} {{consider}} some recent sociological writing on emotion {{and mental health}} and examine {{the significance of this}} for social work practice in the field of mental health. What does an emotionally contented life look like? In the medicalised world of much mental health practice there are numerous therapeutic and <b>pharmaceutical</b> interventions to <b>balance</b> out our emotions and make us happy. In contrast, when practice focuses on those perceived to have more severe forms of mental illness, talk of emotions is often absent and interventions are often considered to have potential to unsettle stable states and ‘talk up’ even more problems. The conceptualisation of emotion as fundamental to the constitution and operation of reason and the role emotions play in our well-being (Williams, 2005) provides opportunities to think about how emotion is considered (or not) by social workers as well as other mental health practitioners. Current service configuration in the UK functions to support a dichotomy in mental illness with a split between primary, the sector supposedly dealing with more common mental health problems, and secondary services, targeted at those with less common and more severe forms of mental illness. This dichotomy is often unhelpful and does not reflect our experience of mental health difficulties. The experience of crisis for example, when emotions become non-containable, can occur to any of us irrespective of a diagnosis (Morton, 2006). This polarised view of mental health is also apparent in discourses about emotion which operate in practice in these services. There is general acceptance that ‘emotions’ or disturbance of emotional stability are linked to a vast array of mental health difficulties such as depression and anxiety and talking about emotions in many therapeutic interventions is considered part of the ‘cure’. When it comes to the more severe illnesses such as schizophrenia or bi-polar disorder, consideration of an emotional life appears to be missing and often avoided. However, even here, emotions are subject to scrutiny - the recording of ‘euthymic’ in medical out-patient notes when the patient with bi-polar disorder is seen and judged stable, the attention paid to high expressed emotion (EE) in families living with someone who has schizophrenia. I want to explore how both preoccupation and avoidance positions are unhelpful, how underlying assumptions about emotional wellness are ever present whether explicitly or implicitly whenever practice intervenes to help people with ‘mental health problems’, and to question the presumption that a steady emotional state would be desirable for any of us let alone achievable...|$|R
