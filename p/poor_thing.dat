25|$|Emin {{has created}} a number of {{installation}} art pieces including <b>Poor</b> <b>Thing</b> (Sarah and Tracey) (2001) which {{was made up of}} two hanging frames, hospital gowns, a water bottle and wire. A similar installation called Feeling Pregnant III (2005) made up of fabric hung off wooden and metal coat hangers and stands was a later creation for Emin. Both these installations touch further on Emin's relationship with pregnancy and abortion and can be related to Louise Bourgeois' sculptures such as Untitled (1996), a mobile of hanging clothes, and Untitled (2007), a series of standing bronze sculptures.|$|E

2500|$|Poe {{reported}} in the Broadway Journal in December 1845 that the Nassau Monthly at Princeton College harshly criticized [...] "The Imp of the Perverse". Calling it a [...] "humbug", the reviewer noted that the author's line of reasoning about this philosophical idea was difficult to follow. [...] "He chases from the wilderness of phrenology into that of transcendentalism, then into that of metaphysics generally; then through many weary pages into the open field of inductive philosophy, where he at last corners the <b>poor</b> <b>thing,</b> and then most unmercifully pokes it {{to death with a}} long stick." ...|$|E
2500|$|Westcott {{was buried}} at sea. A {{monument}} to his memory, sculpted by Thomas Banks, was erected in St Paul's Cathedral, {{and another in}} the church in his birthplace at Honiton. [...] In January 1801, Nelson was passing through Honiton, {{on his way to}} take up a new command at Plymouth. Nelson invited his nearest surviving family to breakfast, and presented Mrs. Westcott with his own Nile medal, saying, [...] "You will not value it less because Nelson has worn it." [...] On 17 January 1801 he wrote to Lady Hamilton: At Honiton I visited Captain Westcott's mother [...] <b>poor</b> <b>thing,</b> except from the bounty of government and Lloyd's, in very low circumstances. The brother is a tailor, but had they been chimney-sweepers it was my duty to show them respect.|$|E
2500|$|It {{was said}} that those {{ancestors}} were on the Long Walk with their daughter, who was pregnant and about to give birth [...] the daughter got tired and weak and couldn't {{keep up with the}} others or go further because of her condition. So my ancestors asked the Army to hold up for a while and to let the woman give birth, but the soldiers wouldn't do it. They forced my people to move on, saying that they were getting behind the others. The soldier told the parents that they had to leave their daughters behind. [...] "Your daughter is not going to survive, anyway; sooner or later she is going to die," [...] they said in their own language. [...] "Go ahead," [...] the daughter said to her parents, [...] "things might come out all right with me," [...] But the <b>poor</b> <b>thing</b> was mistaken, my grandparents used to say. Not long after they had moved on, they heard a gunshot from where they had been a short time ago.|$|E
40|$|This article {{seeks to}} explore the {{apparent}} contradictions between postmodernism and political nationalism in Alasdair Gray's novel <b>Poor</b> <b>Things.</b> While Gray himself has spoken out in favour of an independent Scottish republic, his ironic, self-referential fiction has often been characterised {{as a mode of}} writing whose irreconcilable paradoxes work against political engagement. This issue is studied as regards nationalism, particularly as <b>Poor</b> <b>Things</b> raises the question of how nations are constructed through their literature. Since <b>Poor</b> <b>Things</b> abounds in imagery of hybridity and duality, it is argued that any presumption of wholeness and unicity in the nation is necessarily to be treated with caution. However, through a study of the rival political discourses that permeate <b>Poor</b> <b>Things,</b> it appears that Scottish nationalism is not necessarily incompatible with a politicised form of postmodernist writing. Indeed, Poor Things' key themes of authorial power, contradictory discourses and rewriting are particularly pertinent to the question of nationalism...|$|R
