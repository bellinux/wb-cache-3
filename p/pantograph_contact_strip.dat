40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a novel {{maintenance}} concept based on condition monitoring and dynamic maintenance packaging, by showing how to connect the information flow from low-level sensors to high-level operations and planning under uncertainty. Today, condition-based maintenance systems are focused on data collection and custom-made rule based systems for data analysis. In many cases, {{the focus is on}} measuring "everything" without considering how to use the measurements. In addition, the measurements are often noisy and the future is unpredictable which adds a lot of uncertainty. As a consequence, maintenance is often planned in advance and not replanned when new condition data is available. This often reduces the benefits of condition monitoring. The concept is based on the combination of robust, dynamically adapted maintenance optimization and statistical data analysis where the uncertainty is considered. This approach ties together low-level data acquisition and high-level planning and optimization. The concept has been illustrated in a context of rail vehicle maintenance, where measurements of brake pad and <b>pantograph</b> <b>contact</b> <b>strip</b> wear is used to predict the near future condition, and plan the maintenance activities...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{reports on}} the {{analysis}} of microscopic wear mechanisms of copper/carbon/rice bran ceramics (Cu/C/RBC) composites, which were developed as a new <b>pantograph</b> <b>contact</b> <b>strip</b> material for the current collector of electric trains, and the proposal of the wear equation of those composites. Low friction coefficients, of less than 0. 15, and relatively low specific wear rates, of less than 10 − 4 mm 2 /N, were obtained for the Cu/C/RBC composites, when both the mean diameter and the mass fraction of the rice bran ceramics (RBC) particulate were small. At the opposite compounding ratios, the contrary results were obtained. According to SEM observation on wear particles and worn surfaces at low and high wear conditions, different wear modes were observed as follows: ploughing with no typical wear particle; small cracks and small plastic flow with fine wear particles; large brittle fracture and severe plastic flow with flake-like-shaped wear particles. On {{the basis of the}} wear mode map of ceramics proposed by Hokkirigawa, the wear mode transition of the Cu/C/RBC composites is discussed. The wear equation which showed the exponential relationship between the specific wear rates and the parameter Sw is proposed. As indicated by this equation, the Cu/C/RBC composites have low Sw values due to their high fracture toughness and low friction coefficient resulting in low specific wear rates...|$|E
40|$|The {{transfer}} of electrical {{power from the}} overhead line to the train is carried out through the sliding <b>contact</b> between the <b>pantograph’s</b> <b>contact</b> <b>strip</b> and the overhead line’s contact wire. The state of the contact {{is defined by the}} current collection quality, where electrical arcs play a predominant role. Indeed, electrical arcs are generated when, during current collection, contact losses occur due to the dynamics of pantograph-catenary interaction. The main effects of the electrical arcs are electromagnetic disturbances and high values of local temperature on the strip and on the wire, which in turn cause an increase of wear rate on <b>contact</b> <b>strip</b> and <b>contact</b> wire. The aim {{of this paper is to}} analyze, by means of laboratory tests, the effect of electrical arc occurrence on the wear of strip and wire. Two different kinds of carbon based strip are considered: plain carbon strip and copper impregnated carbon <b>strip.</b> The <b>contact</b> wire considered in this work is a pure copper wire...|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- In {{a railway}} system, trains get {{electricity}} through a structure mainly composed by <b>contact</b> wires and <b>pantographs.</b> The electricity runs through contact wire, a fixed wire suspended above railway tracks. Trains {{make contact with}} the wire and get the electricity that runs along the contact wire by means of a pantograph. In a railway system, a pantograph is a device fixed {{on the top of a}} train that reaches upwards towards the contact wire suspended above the train and creates the necessary contact between train and wire carrying electricity. The end part of the pantograph that touches the contact wire is known as <b>contact</b> <b>strip</b> line. But if the surface of a <b>contact</b> <b>strip</b> line is not smooth, <b>contact</b> between <b>pantograph</b> and suspended <b>contact</b> wire you get vibrations, generally a frequency of thousands of Hz with constant time damping of few hundred seconds. These vibrations give rise to acoustic signals that can be picked up by microphones mounted along the track. The acoustic signal is filtered to a range of thousands of hertz using a specific data signal process.

40|$|The {{method by}} which current is {{collected}} from overhead contact lines over the tracks via pantographs is widely used to supply power to EMUs and electric locomotives. Pantographs were first installed to trains in operation in Japan in 1914. Then, in 1922, the former Japanese National Railways completed the installation of pantographs to all electric locomotives and EMUs. Thus, pantographs have been playing the main role in current collection for rolling stock in Japan for nearly a century. The most important function required of pantographs is to collect the required current efficiently to vehicles when needed. To do that, pantographs need to have conductivity and capacity appropriate to their usage. These functions also should be maintained even in high speed running. Factors that determine the current collectivity of pantographs are largely classified into two factors: dynamic performance of the pantograph and wear resistance between the <b>contact</b> <b>strip</b> and the <b>contact</b> wire. <b>Pantographs</b> absolutely must follow the vertical deviation of the contact wire even in high speed running without fail. <b>Contact</b> <b>strips</b> are installed {{to the top of}} a <b>pantograph</b> that <b>contacts</b> the contact wire, (Fig. 1). If a pantograph cannot follow the contact wire and <b>contact</b> <b>strips</b> lose <b>contact</b> to the wire while large current is flowing, arcs are generated or current collection worsens. Such a situation is called contact loss. Arcs caused by contact loss increase wear of <b>contact</b> <b>strips</b> and <b>contact</b> wire; and in worse case scenarios, they break both. If contact wire or <b>contact</b> <b>strips</b> wear easily or cause wear on each other, that results in shorter lifespan and increase in maintenance expenses. Based on these factors, the Technical Center is carrying out R&D projects with an aim of extending lifespan of both of contact wires and <b>contact</b> <b>strips</b> by decreasing wear of those. Here I wil...|$|R

40|$|A {{new method}} to {{estimate}} the electron diffusion length in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) is presented. DSCs were fabricated on conducting glass substrates that were patterned by laser ablation of the fluorine-doped tin oxide coating to form parallel <b>contact</b> <b>strips</b> separated by uncontacted strips of the same width. The relative collection efficiency was measured {{as a function of}} the gap between the <b>contact</b> <b>strips,</b> which determines the lateral distance traveled by electrons to reach the contacts. To avoid complications arising from nonlinear recombination kinetics, current measurements were performed using small amplitude perturbations of the electron density close to open circuit and the maximum power point to minimize electron density gradients in the film. One and two-dimensional solutions of the continuity equation for electron transport and back reaction predict that the relative collection efficiency should fall as spacing between the <b>contact</b> <b>strips</b> exceeds the electron diffusion length and electrons are lost by back electron transfer during transit to the contacts. Measurements of the relative collection efficiency were fitted to the predicted dependence of the collection efficiency on the spacing between the <b>contact</b> <b>strips</b> to obtain the value of the electron diffusion length.

The aim is to assess the overall pantograph sway in crosswinds based on the relative movements of the <b>pantograph</b> and <b>contact</b> wire, {{taking into account the}} crosswind deflection of the train body. The pantograph and wire deflections are derived from simplified models of such structures, whereas train body displacements are computed via Vampire. A spectral approach is used to simulate the turbulent crosswind, which is then used with aerodynamic admittance function to obtain unsteady crosswind loading. Analysis of data shows negligible crosswind deflections of the pantograph itself in the range of few millimeters, but train body and wire deflections are much larger. It is shown that crosswinds may cause the pantograph sway to exceed prescribed limits for some combinations of wind gust and track conditions. ...|$|R
