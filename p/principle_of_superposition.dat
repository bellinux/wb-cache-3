5|$|Interferometry {{makes use}} of the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>superposition</b> to combine waves {{in a way that}} will cause the result of their {{combination}} to have some meaningful property that is diagnostic of the original state of the waves. This works because when two waves with the same frequency combine, the resulting intensity pattern is determined by the phase difference between the two waves—waves that are in phase will undergo constructive interference while waves that are out of phase will undergo destructive interference. Waves which are not completely in phase nor completely out of phase will have an intermediate intensity pattern, which can be used to determine their relative phase difference. Most interferometers use light or some other form of electromagnetic wave.|$|E

Perform {{numerical}} {{analysis of the}} distribution of the factual contributions of line sources of distortion in the voltage distortion at the point of common coupling, based on the <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>superposition</b> and exclusions.

Mathematical model for determining the factual contribution of line sources of distortion in the voltage distortion at the point of common coupling, based on the <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>superposition</b> and exclusions, are equivalent. To assess the degree of participation of each source of distortion in the voltage distortion at the point of common coupling and distribution of financial compensation to the injured party by all sources of distortion developed a one-dimensional criteria based on the scalar product of vectors.

2500|$|When a beam {{of light}} is partly blocked by an obstacle, some of the light is {{scattered}} around the object, and light and dark bands are often seen at [...] the edge of the shadow – this effect is known as diffraction. These effects can be modelled using the Huygens–Fresnel principle. Huygens postulated that every point on a primary wavefront acts as a source of spherical secondary wavelets and the sum of these secondary wavelets determines the form of the wave at any subsequent time. Fresnel developed an equation using the Huygens wavelets together with the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>superposition</b> of waves, which models these diffraction effects quite well.|$|E
2500|$|In {{traditional}} classical physics diffraction arises {{because of}} the way in which waves propagate; this is described by the Huygens–Fresnel principle and the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>superposition</b> of waves. The propagation of a wave can be visualized by considering every particle of the transmitted medium on a wavefront as a point source for a secondary spherical wave. The wave displacement at any subsequent point is the sum of these secondary waves. When waves are added together, their sum is determined by the relative phases as well as the amplitudes of the individual waves so that the summed amplitude of the waves can have any value between zero and the sum of the individual amplitudes. [...] Hence, diffraction patterns usually have a series of maxima and minima.|$|E

[...] The sea state evolves according to physical equations – based on a spectral representation of the conservation of wave action – which include: wave propagation / advection, refraction (by bathymetry and currents), shoaling, and a source function which allows for wave energy to be augmented or diminished. [...] The source function has at least three terms: wind forcing, nonlinear transfer, and dissipation by whitecapping. Wind data are typically provided from a separate atmospheric model from an operational weather forecasting center.|$|E

As usual it starts from the static case, but it is strictly based on Helmholtz theorem of uniqueness of vector fields, on primary experimental observations upon the sources of electric and magnetic fields, on Lenz's law and on <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>superposition</b> and reciprocity <b>of</b> interactions.

2500|$|When rock {{units are}} placed under {{horizontal}} compression, they shorten and become thicker. Because rock units, other than muds, do not significantly change in volume, {{this is accomplished}} in two primary ways: through faulting and folding. In the shallow crust, where brittle deformation can occur, thrust faults form, which causes deeper rock to move on top of shallower rock. Because deeper rock is often older, as noted by the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>superposition,</b> this can result in older rocks moving on top of younger ones. Movement along faults can result in folding, either because the faults are not planar or because rock layers are dragged along, forming drag folds as slip occurs along the fault. Deeper in the Earth, rocks behave plastically and fold instead of faulting. These folds can either be those where the material {{in the center of}} the fold buckles upwards, creating [...] "antiforms", or where it buckles downwards, creating [...] "synforms". If the tops of the rock units within the folds remain pointing upwards, they are called anticlines and synclines, respectively. If some of the units in the fold are facing downward, the structure is called an overturned anticline or syncline, and if all of the rock units are overturned or the correct up-direction is unknown, they are simply called by the most general terms, antiforms and synforms.|$|E
