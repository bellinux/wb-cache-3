50|$|The {{original}} detection mechanism used in picosecond ultrasonics {{is based}} on the <b>photoelastic</b> <b>effect.</b> The refractive index and extinction coefficient near the surface of the solid are perturbed by the returning strain pulses (within the optical absorption depth of the probe light), resulting in changes in the optical reflectance or transmission. The measured temporal echo shape results from a spatial integral involving both the probe light optical absorption profile and the strain pulse spatial profile (see below).|$|E

50|$|The {{principle}} of operation of photoelastic modulators {{is based on}} the <b>photoelastic</b> <b>effect,</b> in which a mechanically stressed sample exhibits birefringence proportional to the resulting strain. Photoelastic modulators are resonant devices where the precise oscillation frequency is determined by the properties of the optical element/transducer assembly. The transducer is tuned to the resonance frequency of the optical element along its long dimension, determined by its length and the speed of sound in the material. A current is then sent through the transducer to vibrate the optical element through stretching and compressing which changes the birefringence of the transparent material. Because of this resonant character, the birefringence of the optical element can be modulated to large amplitudes, but also by the same reason, the operation of a PEM is limited to a single frequency, and most commercial devices manufactured today operate at about 50 kHz.|$|E
40|$|Many {{studies have}} been devoted to the search of {{photonic}} and phononic band gaps, but relatively few works {{are dealing with the}} simultaneous control of phonons and photons. Phoxonic structures hold promises for the simultaneous confinement and tailoring of sound and light waves with potential applications to acousto-optical devices and highly controllable photon-phonon interactions. The aim of this presentation is to investigate both the photonic and photonic band structures, and in particular dual photonic-photonic band gaps, in a model of silicon strip waveguide in which each unit cell contains one hole in the middle and two symmetric stubs {{on the side of the}} waveguide. We use the finite-element (FE) methods to calculate the dispersion curves and the finite difference time domain (FDTD) to obtain the transmission spectra. Appropriate choices of the geometrical parameters allows us to obtain a complete phononic gap together with a photonic band gap of a given polarization and symmetry. Then, we investigate the possibility of confined modes inside cavities inserted in the phoxonic strip waveguide. Such situation is suitable to enhance the photon-phonon interaction. The optomechanical and <b>photoelastic</b> <b>effects</b> of a phononic/photonic cavity are discussed and analyzed on a two dimensional infinite phoxonic crystal before being applied to the strip waveguide. Depending on the choice of the phononic defect mode, the importance of the optomechanical and the <b>photoelastic</b> <b>effects</b> on the photonic mode is then discussed and compared. Finally, we discuss the actual values of the geometrical parameters, compatible with the technological fabrication constraints, in order to find the photonic features in the range of the telecommunication wavelengths, with the acoustic frequencies falling in the gigahertz regime...|$|R
40|$|Stimulated Brillouin {{scattering}} (SBS) {{is a very}} fundamental {{interaction between}} light and travelling acoustic waves, which is mainly attributed to the electrostriction and <b>photoelastic</b> <b>effects</b> with the interaction strength being orders of magnitude larger than other nonlinearities. Although various photonic applications for all-optical light controlling based on SBS have been achieved in optical fiber and waveguides, the coherent light-acoustic interaction remains a challenge. Here, we experimentally demonstrated the Brillouin scattering induced transparency (BSIT) in a high quality optical microresonantor. Benefited from the triple-resonance in the whispering gallery cavity, the photon-phonon interaction is enhanced, and enables the light storage to the phonon, which has lifetime up to 10 us. In addition, due to the phase matching condition, the stored circulating acoustic phonon can only interact with certain direction light, which leads to non-reciprocal light storage and retrieval. Our work paves the way towards the low power consumption integrated all-optical switching, isolator and circulator, as well as quantum memory. Comment: 5 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of optical activity on two-wave mixing (TWM) in photorefractive BTO and BSO crystals {{in the absence}} of an applied field is studied both theoretically and experimentally. For the conventinal orientations of the grating vector, K [001] and K[001], the piezoelectric and <b>photoelastic</b> <b>effects</b> are either zero or negligible. This makes an analytical treatment of the TWM problem possible. We obtain an analytical solution for the coupled wave equations of TWM valid for arbitrary optical activity. This result is of special importance for BTO crystals. In these crystals under the condition of maximum energy transfer (|K|rD= 1, where rD is the Debye radius) neither the approximation of small optical activity nor the one of dominating optical activity is applicable and our analytical solution becomes essential. Our experimental setup uses beams with a trapezoidal overlap that allows us to study the thickness-dependence of the gain in a single measurement.

40|$|We {{describe}} the design, fabrication, and characterization of a one-dimensional silicon photonic crystal cavity {{in which a}} central slot is used to enhance the overlap between highly localized optical and mechanical modes. The optical mode has an extremely small mode volume of 0. 017 (λ_vac/n) ^ 3, and an optomechanical vacuum coupling rate of 310 kHz is measured. With optical quality factors up to 1. 2 · 10 ^ 5, fabricated devices are in the resolved-sideband regime. The electric field has its maximum at the slot wall and couples to the in-plane breathing motion of the slot. The optomechanical coupling is thus dominated by the moving-boundary effect, which we simulate to be six {{times greater than the}} <b>photoelastic</b> <b>effect,</b> in contrast to most structures, where the <b>photoelastic</b> <b>effect</b> is often the primary coupling mechanism...|$|E
30|$|We {{fabricated}} the LPG {{based on}} the PCF by periodically etching the silica cladding in the PCF with a wet-etching technique. The azimuthally symmetric and periodic micro-corrugations were successfully patterned {{on the surface of}} the silica cladding of the PCF. The applied strain effectively induces the mode coupling between the core and the cladding modes {{based on the}} <b>photoelastic</b> <b>effect,</b> which results in the resonant peak in the transmission spectrum. Increasing strain makes the transmission peak depth of the PCF-based LPG with periodic micro-ridges strong because of the <b>photoelastic</b> <b>effect.</b> Since the <b>photoelastic</b> <b>effect</b> is reduced by temperature, the extinction ratio of the proposed PCF-based LPG was reduced by increasing temperature. The temperature sensitivity of the transmission was measured to be − 4.5 [*]×[*] 10 − 3 dB/°C. We also measured the transmission characteristics of the proposed PCF-based LPG with variations in ambient index. In the PCF, the dispersion of the core mode is higher than that of the cladding mode. Since ambient index affects the variation of the effective refractive index of the core mode more than that of the cladding mode, increasing ambient index makes the resonant wavelength of the proposed PCF-based LPG shift to longer wavelengths. The ambient index sensitivity was measured to be ~ 108.9  nm/RIU. We believe that the experimental results are very useful for many applications to optical communications, fiber-optic sensors, instrument measurement, etc.|$|E

40|$|The {{fabrication}} {{of most of}} micro and optoelectronic devices is based on substrates cut as wafers from melt-grown single crystals. The growth of crystals, the subsequent annealing steps and the {{fabrication of}} devices itself are a run of numerous different thermal procedures which induce residual strains due to a spatially inhomogeneous cooling of the material. These thermally induced strains both intensify the problems of breakage and warpage of wafer, influence the properties of surface with respect to subsequent steps of epitaxy and deposition, and change the electrical and optical parameters of crystal because of piezoelectric and <b>photoelastic</b> <b>effects.</b> As rule of thumb, temperature gradients of {{an order of magnitude}} between 1 and 100 K cm- 1 cause a stress in a range of 1 and 100 MPa (10 - 6 and 10 - 3 on the scale of strain). As already discussed elsewhere [1, 2], thermal gradients around 10 K cm- 1 are typical of wafer annealing procedures. Consequently, there is a strong demand for techniques which are able for the nondestructive quantitative characterization of strain in large diameter semiconductor wafers. As demonstrated in numerous papers, the polariscopy based on the strain-induced birefringence has proved as the technique both of the highest sensitivity (10 - 7) and of an adequate high spatial resolution (< 100 µm), in particular achieved by means of the Scanning Infrared Polariscope (SIRP). Nevertheless, until now there has been a lack to compare the results obtained by the polariscopy with those of other suitable techniques on the same scale. The limit of sensitivity in strain of the Raman spectroscopy amounts to about 10 - 4 only. In this paper we present X-ray diffraction data of strain resolved down to 10 - 6. For the comparison we have particularly to take into account that the SIRP provides combinations of the strain tensor components whereas the X-ray diffraction technique yields the separate ones. The targets of comparison here presented are GaAs wafers multi-step annealed in arrangements of different geometry. Both the level and the spatial distribution of strain have significantly changed in dependence of this geometry. The maximum strain determined both by SIRP and by x-ray diffraction amounts to several 10 - 5. The points of x-ray measurement were chosen from characteristic areas in the highly resolved SIRP map. The strain data were converted into terms of separate stress components...|$|R

Methods: Five models were manufactured, in which two different clinical situations were correlated: 1) use of intrusion arch not cinched back and transpalatal bar for anchorage (Group 1); 2) use of intrusion arch cinched back and transpalatal bar for anchorage (Group 2). Stress generated in the apical and middle regions of tooth roots of maxillary anterior teeth and maxillary first molars was evaluated. Results: Taking a reference value of 1. 0 MPa = 100 %, qualitative descriptive analysis was performed, which showed uniformity between stress values in the apical region of anterior teeth of both groups (G 1 and G 2). In the posterior region, for models with the arch cinched back (G 2), stress remained within 100 %. As for G 1 models (with the arch not cinched back), variations in the mesial surface of first molars were observed, with an increase of 20 % in the generated stress. The apical region did not undergo any changes, while in the distal region of molars there was a decrease of 20 % in stress. Conclusion: Laboratory results revealed differences in stress between Groups 1 and 2 in the molar region, thereby indicating that there was a tendency towards mesial root tipping of first molars when the distal end of the CIA was not cinched back...|$|R
