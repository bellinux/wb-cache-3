40|$|This article {{examines}} {{the extent to which}} the European quota rule of the Television Without Frontiers Directive encroaches upon the sovereignty of the Member States in the area of broadcasting. It challenges the rationale of the European quota on three levels: its contribution to the creation of the internal nmrket, to the promotion of the Errropean audiovisual sector and to the fostering of Europe's cultural diversity/identity. It sets out the limits of the Community 's competence and shows that the legal basis of the Directive, Articles 47 (2) and 55 EC, cannot justify the harmoisation of national programme restrictions creating obstacles to the free movement of television broadcasts in the Community. The industrial objectives of the European quota are outlined and its failure to give a fresh impetus to the European <b>programme</b> <b>industry</b> is analysed. Consideration is given to Article 151 EC as a potential legal basis for the European quota provision and the inconsistencies of the quota's cultural conception are highlighted...|$|E

40|$|The High Intensity and Energy HIE-ISOLDE {{project is}} a major upgrade of the {{existing}} ISOLDE and REX-ISOLDE facilities {{with the objective of}} increasing the energy and the intensity of the delivered radioactive ion beams (RIB) [1]. In order to accommodate the future increase of primary beam intensity delivered by the new LINAC 4 H- driver to the Proton Synchrotron Booster (PSB) [2] and from this to ISOLDE, a major study is being carried out to upgrade the existing designs of the ISOLDE target and its supporting infrastructure. In particular, the extraction optics {{plays an important role in}} the initial beam transport and the quality of the beam supplied to the mass separators. Important factors include the emittance of the beam and the beam profile to avoid beam losses. A new double electrode extraction system has been developed for simplifying and improving the interface between the target unit and the frontend (target coupling table). Numerical and experimental studies have been performed in order to define the new extraction geometry, and the coupling table has been adapted to keep the compatibility. An alternative heating system is under study. An electron bombardment heating system is being developed as an option for avoiding the employment of big cross section cables. The results of these studies and the mechanical models developed are presented and discussed. © 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

40|$|This {{strategy}} project aims {{to serve}} as the foundation for the future strategic development of the Mechanical engineering programme (Master of Engineering) at Chalmers University of Technology (Chalmers). The goal is {{to be one of the}} top Mechanical engineering programmes in Europe. The project has been led during 2014 by two students attending programme. The programme consists of a Bachelor cycle and a Master’s cycle. An action research based approach has been used, and the data collection has included both quantitative and qualitative methods. Data collection aimed to gather the different stakeholders’ views of the future of Mechanical engineering education, and to learn from other programmes and universities. The stakeholders have been defined as: Academia (universities in general, and Chalmers in particular), students and alumni from the five year Mechanical engineering <b>programme,</b> <b>industry,</b> and society. The global outlook has focused on universities within Europe and the USA, and has included site visits. Data has been analysed continuously and summarised into five challenges. The challenges for the mechanical engineering programme have been identified as: recruitment, arenas for meetings between industry-university-student, skills of the engineer, internationalisation, and uncertainty. These have been further discussed and evolved into recommendations for the Mechanical engineering programme. The first recommendation, connected to the challenge ‘uncertainty’ is vital for a holistic long term development of the programme, and it states that The Mechanical engineering programme has to agree on what should characterise a Master of Science in Mechanical engineering, i. e. the combined Bachelor and Master’s cycles, at Chalmers. Without this foundation it will be exceedingly difficult to organise further developments. Other general recommendations for the programme include mapping and defining what is already being done in the programme, developing it and then improving the way that the strengths of the programme are exhibited both internally and externally...|$|E

40|$|Vitamin {{and mineral}} deficiencies, in {{particular}} deficiencies of iron, iodine, vitamin A and folic acid, cause significant economic losses through increased disabilities and mortality, reduced cognitive development and decreased work productivity of adults. Flour fortification involves adding essential {{vitamins and minerals}} to cereal flours (wheat, maize, sorghum) as it is produced, which in turn makes foods prepared with fortified flour more nutritious. Iron, zinc, folic acid, and other B-vitamins are commonly added to wheat and maize flours. This {{has proven to be}} a cost-effective means of reducing the prevalence of iron deficiency anaemia and neural tube birth defects and improving overall health. Flour fortification is applied both in developed as developing countries. Regions which implemented fortification programmes include North and South America, West Africa, Middle East and Australia. Specifically for Africa, the number of countries which implemented mandatory flour fortification increased from 2 in 2004 up to 27 in 2016. To obtain a successful national fortification <b>programme,</b> <b>industry</b> and government partners need to take their responsibility. They need to collaborate to produce high quality fortified foods. However, national fortification programmes are often hampered by poorly established or badly designed protocols and monitoring systems, lack of resources and insufficient qualified laboratory resources and expertise to test product samples. As these problems are undermining existing and possible future flour fortification programmes, training on quality assurance and quality control for flour fortification is an essential requirement for countries that are implementing or planning to embark on flour fortification. Since several years, the Smarter Futures project is organizing QA/QC trainings around Africa to support implementing fortification programmes. The strength of such a training is that it brings together the national stakeholders concerning food fortification which are the milling industry and the government agencies (health department, food control, etc.). This presentation will first focus on some technical aspects and challenges related to flour fortification. Further, the setup of the QA/QC training on flour fortification of May 2016, held in Kampala, Uganda will be presented. In this year’s edition, Ghent University, through support of VLIR-UOS (Belgian development cooperation), were able to include 14 participants from academia (MSc – PhD students and lecturers) as a third stakeholder in the training...|$|E
