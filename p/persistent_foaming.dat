40|$|The {{occurrence}} of <b>persistent</b> <b>foaming</b> is observed in many anaerobic digesters that have sugar beet as their feedstock. The formation of foam entails a significant {{risk of damage}} to biogas plants, as gas pipes can become blocked. For this reason, foaming tests have been conducted to investigate which measures lead to reductions in foam development. It was found that generally available fertilizers such as urea, ammonium nitrate and calcium cyanamide have a foam-reducing effect. However, batch fermentation tests showed inhibition of biogas production at higher concentrations of these substances, {{which means that they}} should be used with care. Calcium cyanamide was found to be very unsuitable, as this substance inhibited biogas production even at low concentrations and caused the fermentation process to come to a complete stop at higher concentrations...|$|E
40|$|Anaerobic {{digestion}} foaming {{has been}} encountered in several sewage treatment {{plants in the}} UK. Foaming has raised major concerns for the water utilities due to significant impacts on process efficiency and operational costs. Several foaming causes have been suggested {{over the past few}} years by researchers. However, the supporting experimental information is limited and in some cases site specific. The present report aimed to provide a better understanding of the anaerobic digestion foaming problem and to identify the underlying mechanisms of foaming. Field and laboratory investigation identified organic loading as a cause of foaming. Bench scale batch digestion studies in sludge showed that the critical organic loading for foaming was at 2. 5 kg VS. m - 3 while the 5 kg VS. m - 3 resulted in <b>persistent</b> <b>foaming.</b> Moreover, full scale foaming digesters exhibited higher foaming potential in digested sludge under aeration in the laboratory than the full scale non- foaming digesters indicating that the concentration of surface active agents was higher. Further investigation of the effect of the surface active compounds, BSA and n-valeric acid on foaming showed that both compounds induced <b>persistent</b> <b>foaming</b> at all the examined concentrations. Filamentous bacteria contribution to foam initiation and stabilization was considered insignificant, apart from one occasion (FI: 5), due to the abundance of filaments in foaming sludge (FI≤ 3) and their partitioning in foam (FI≤ 3). Part of the current work also assessed the cost implications of a foaming incident at the full scale. The antifoam cost was found to be of major concern for the water utilities costing between £ 1. 30 and £ 13. 00 per 1000 m 3 of digester volume per day. However, there was no information on biogas and energy loss whereas the information provided on cleaning, maintenance costs and manpower working hours was poor. Thus, the overall cost of a foaming incident at the full scale could not be estimated at this stage...|$|E

30|$|The {{migration}} of SMCs responds to a chemical signal produced during {{the accumulation of}} oxLDL, foam cells, and debris. This results {{in the formation of}} a fibrous cap, a layer of connective tissue that forms an atherosclerotic plaque, which shields the lesion from the lumen. The fibrous cap encloses a lipid-rich necrotic core composed of oxLDLs, cholesterol and apoptotic or necrotic cells that are unable to obtain sufficient nutrients for survival [6]. As the inflammatory process progresses, apoptosis (cell death that occurs normally) and matrix degradation by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) become apparent. As inflammation escalates, accompanied by <b>persistent</b> <b>foam</b> cell recruitment and the ever more necrotic environment within the atherosclerotic plaque, further development and maturation of the atherosclerotic lesion ensue. This assists in the enlargement of the lipid rich core and thickening of the fibrous cap [6].|$|R
40|$|The {{potentialities}} for the {{intensification of}} the process of lipase production by the yeast Yarrowia lipolytica on a renewable hydrophobic substrate (methyloleate) have been investigated. The key factor governing the lipase yield is {{the intensification of}} the oxygen transfer rate, considering the fact that Y. lipolytica is a strict aerobe. However, considering the nature of the substrate and the capacity for protein excretion and biosurfactant production of Y. lipolytica, intensification of oxygen transfer rate is accompanied by an excessive formation of foam. Two different foam control strategies have thus been implemented: a classical chemical foam control strategy (CFM) and a mechanical foam control (MFM) based on the Stirring As Foam Disruption (SAFD) principle. The second strategy allows foam control without any modifications of the physico-chemical properties of the broth. However, the MFM system design induced the formation of a <b>persistent</b> <b>foam</b> layer in the bioreactor. This phenomenon has led to the segregation of microbial cells between the foam phase and the liquid phase {{in the case of the}} bioreactors operated with MFM control, and induced a reduction at the level of the lipase yield. More interestingly, flow cytometry experiments have shown that residence time of microbial cells in the foam phase tends to induce a dimorphic transition which could potentially explain the reduction of lipase excretion.

40|$|The {{impact of}} {{increasing}} organic load on anaerobic digestion foaming was studied at both full and bench scale. Organic loadings of 1. 25, 2. 5 and 5 kg VS m(- 3) {{were applied to}} bench-scale digesters. Foaming was monitored at a full scale digester operated in a comparable organic loading range over 15 months. The bench scale batch studies identified 2. 5 kg VS m(- 3) as a critical threshold for foam initiation while 5 kg VS m(- 3) resulted in <b>persistent</b> <b>foaming.</b> Investigation of a full scale foaming event corroborated the laboratory observation that foaming may be initiated at a loading rate of 2. 5 kg VS m(- 3). Experimental findings on foam composition and differences in the quality characteristics between foaming and non-foaming sludges indicated that foam initiation derived from the combined effect of the liquid and gas phases inside a digester and that the solids/biomass ultimately stabilized foaming.

40|$|Our {{long term}} {{goal is to}} develop a tested model of optical {{properties}} in the surf zone and adjacent nearshore ocean, including the influence of suspended sediment, bubble population and surface foam, to assess how optical properties are related to short term events such as individual breaking wave crests, and to determine how wave-driven surf zone circulation influences spatial distribution of optical properties just offshore of breaking through seaward transport of fine sediment and small persistent bubbles. OBJECTIVES The ability to make optically-based observations in nearshore waters is strongly influenced by the presence of suspended sediment particles and of bubbles, both of which are present due to the action of breaking waves. Wave breaking is instrumental in injecting large volumes of air into the water column. This air volume subsequently evolves into a distribution of bubble sizes which interact with the fluid turbulence and are advected by the organized flow. Degassing of the water column can additionally generate a <b>persistent</b> <b>foam</b> layer which can prevent any optical penetration of the water column. Our goal is to develop time-resolved models for these processes in order to make predictions of optical properties of the water column. To date, we have begun this process by incorporating a continuum description of bubble populations and associated dynamics in 2 -D (Ripple) and 3 -D (Truchas) Navier-Stokes solvers. In the continuation of this work, our objectives are to: 1) Further develop the 3 -D Navier Stokes framework to incorporate sediment particle phases as well as chemistry and biology phases with possible interaction...|$|R
40|$|Time-averaged (over many wave periods) nearshore video {{observations}} {{show the}} process of wave breaking as one or more white alongshore bands of high intensity. Across a known depth profile, similar bands of dissipation can be predicted with a model describing the time-averaged cross-shore evolution of organized wave and roller energy. This close correspondence between observed and modeled dissipation proxies is used {{to develop a new}} remote sensing technique, termed Subtidal Beach Mapper (SBM), to estimate nearshore bathymetry. SBM operates on a time series of cross-shore intensity profiles to resolve the pattern in depth change on a morphological timescale (including overall gain or loss of sediment) rather than to focus on the particular change induced by a single intensity profile. From each intensity profile, the breaking-induced component is isolated by removing the contribution of background illumination and <b>persistent</b> <b>foam.</b> The depth profile is updated based on a comparison between this video-derived dissipation proxy and a cross-shore profile of the dissipation of the roller energy. This updating is implemented through time-dependent mass balance equations for the seabed and a buffer layer above the bed. SBM was tested using 1 year of hourly video data collected at Egmond aan Zee, Netherlands. The dominant morphological changes observed from ground truth data were reproduced reasonably well, including the shoreward migration of the outer bar and the net sediment gain in the profile. Root-mean square differences between surveyed and SBM derived depth after 1 year of video-based depth updating with an average of about 70 intensity profiles per month were smallest (~ 0. 2 m) on the inner bar and largest (~ 0. 6 m) in the outer bar trough, with a profile average value of about 0. 4 m. Despite the many processes included in SBM, the implementation of a heuristic scaling function in the mass balance equations to spatially adjust morphological growth rates was essential to these results, in particular near the shoreline, where otherwise the profile is prone to an unrealistic deepening.

40|$|Graduation date: 2003 Longshore {{currents}} {{are frequently}} occurring phenomena capable of transporting beach sediments, causing accretion and {{erosion of the}} shoreline. Forcing mechanisms are understood and well modeled for cases of alongshore homogeneous and monotonic bathymetry, yet the extension of these models to complex and irregular bathymetry sometimes fails. To test and improve these models, observational data over large spatial and temporal scales and {{from a variety of}} beaches and forcing conditions is necessary. In situ instruments have the drawback of being costly and difficult to operate for very long periods (months to years) over wide areas (hundreds of meters) on a routine basis, due to the frequent care and attention they demand while in the high energy environment of the surf zone. We present an optical method (Optical Current Meter or OCM) to measure the longshore component of surface currents in the nearshore by measuring the alongshore drift of <b>persistent</b> sea <b>foam</b> in the surf zone. The method is based on short time series of video data collected from an alongshore array of pixels. These space-time data are first Fourier transformed to a frequency-wavenumber spectrum, and finally to a velocity spectrum.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether the effluent of the Ash Flat Wastewater Treatment Plant changes the water quality or aquatic macroinvertebrate community structure of North Big Creek. Weekly water samples were analyzed for pH, N, P, COD, TSS and fecal coliform bacteria from 17 June to 19 August 1992. Aquatic macroinvertebrates were collected biweekly using a Turtox Indestructible™ Dip Net, and density indices were calculated. Station 1, above the effluent, was a spring habitat. Fecal coliform, N, P, TSS and COD values were higher at this station, while the aquatic macroinvertebrate community was relatively simple. The effluent impact upon Station 2 was most obvious from the <b>persistent</b> presence of <b>foam</b> and filamentous algae.

These space-time data are first Fourier transformed to a frequency-wave number spectrum and, finally, to a velocity spectrum. A model of the velocity spectrum is fit to the observed spectrum to estimate the foam drift velocity. Confidence intervals and other measures of the input and output data quality are calculated. Field test comparisons were made against an in situ bidirectional electromagnetic current meter {{on the basis of}} 1 month of video data from the 1997 Sandy Duck field experiment. The root mean square error between the two approaches was 0. 10 m/s. Linear regression analysis showed the gain between the two instruments to not be statistically different from one. Differences between the surface and interior measurements were compared to forcing mechanisms that may cause surface velocity shear. Velocity offsets and alongshore wind stress were well correlated for cases when waves and wind were not aligned to within ± 45 °, when wind- and wave-forced currents are reasonably separable. Calculated wind-dependent surface current shear, modeled as a surface boundary layer, correlated well with the observed velocity offsets for observations of nonalignment between wind and waves.

The Oudtshoorn district is responsible for about 90 % of the lucerne seed produced in South Africa. BOTANICAL DESCRIPTION: Trifolium repens: Low growing, spreading plants with trifoliate leaves, sometimes mistaken for grass. TOXIC PRINCIPLE: Frothy bloat: Saponins and glycoproteins. MECHANISM OF ACTION: • Soluble proteins escape rapidly from fragile thin-walled cells of above species during cellulose digestion. • This results in changes in surface tension of ruminal fluid and stabilization of gas bubbles in rumen. • Critical concentration of several surface-active agents leads to <b>persistent,</b> rigid <b>foam.</b> Phyto-oestrogenism: • The toxic principles of the clovers are various isoflavone glycosides, which are inherently oestrogenic and/or are biotransformed in the rumen to active or inactive compounds. • The oestrogenic compounds contained in lucerne are coumestans. SYNDROMES: Frothy bloat, ABPE, Phyto-oestrogenism. SYSTEMS AFFECTED: Gastro-intestinal, urogenital and respiratory systems.

40|$|Methods were {{developed}} for {{the isolation of the}} soluble leaf proteins in as pure a form as possible and free of any phenoloxidase products. This protein material was separated into two fractions (Fraction 1 and Fraction 2 proteins). A detailed study of the foaming properties of these soluble protein fractions was made so that the conditions necessary for the production of stable foams from these solutions could be evaluated. The nature of the foams derived from bovine salivary secretions and the soluble proteins of the holotrich protozoa were also examined. The foams derived from the leaf and protozoal proteins were rigid and of high stability only when the foams were of high compressive strength. In contrast the salivary secretions produced foams of low compressive strength but high persistence. For protozoal proteins and Fraction 1 protein of white clover and red clover the optimum pH for foam production was close to pH 5. 8 to 5. 9 and for the plant Fraction 2 proteins in the range 5. 1 to 5. 4. The foams derived from bovine salivary mucoprotein was unaffected by changes in pH over the range 3. 5 to 7. 5. The foams generated in vitro from rumen liquor were of low compressive strength but extremely high persistence, and their properties were very {{different from those of the}} foams generated from either the plant or protozoal proteins except that they showed maximum foam persistence in a similar pH range. The concentration of Fraction 1 protein in the rumen liquor was below the minimum concentration required to produce stable Fraction 1 protein foams. Of this low concentration only 24 % was surface denatured in production of these very stable rumen foams. The significance of this result is discussed. Apart from the low level of Fraction 1 protein, other low molecular weight proteins together with a major component containing carbohydrate as well as protein, were observed on analysing the rumen liquor by acrylamide gel electrophoresis and cellulose acetate electrophoresis. This major component resembled salivary mucoprotein in its schlieren profile in an analytical ultracentrifuge. This material was isolated by preparative ultracentrifugation and some of its properties examined. It was not precipitated by trichloracetic acid, unlike the protozoal and plant proteins, but was precipitated by 60 % ammonium sulphate, 80 % ethanol, and an equal volume of 1 % cetavlon. The antibody to this material gave a positive precipitin reaction with the salivary mucoprotein, the sensitivity of which could be increased by incubating the salivary mucoprotein with neuraminidase, an enzyme which removes the sialic acid from the mucoprotein. molecule. The significance of these findings in relation to other work is discussed. The action of various surfactants that have been implicated in the bloat syndrome on the foaming properties of Fraction 1 protein foams was examined. Thus calcium was found to increase the rigidity of Fraction 1 protein foams, slightly increase the rigidity of Fraction 2 protein foams at high calcium concentrations only, but was without effect on salivary mucoprotein foams. Sodium polygalacturonate increased the persistence of Fraction 1 protein foams at concentration greater than 0. 04 % w/v. Two salivary secretions were examined for their effect on Fraction 1 protein foams. The first of these was bovine salivary mucoprotein, which whilst increasing the persistence of the foam, decreased its rigidity. Foams of maximum persistence were produced from solutions containing Fraction 1 protein/mucoprotein in the ratio 2 / 1, w/w. The second salivary secretion examined was the oesophageal mucin. This material did not produce stable foams by itself, but was an extremely effective stabilizing agent of Fraction 1 protein foams. The most effective antifoaming agent of the polar lipids of red clover examined in this thesis, was phosphatydyl choline which at a concentration of 50 µg ml- 1 completely inhibited the production of Fraction 1 protein foams. Addition of mucoprotein to lipid/Fraction 1 protein mixtures which would not support stable foams, resulted in production of extremely <b>persistent</b> <b>foams.</b> Both Fraction 1 protein and mucoprotein were essential for the formation of these foams which resembled the properties of the foams generated in vitro from rumen liquor. From this study it appeared that neither the plant nor the protozoal proteins by themselves could account for the properties of the rumen foams. The properties of the rumen foams could be reproduced by generating foams from mixtures of Fraction 1 protein/plant lipid and salivary mucoprotein. The soluble proteins and the foaming properties of extracts of bloat and non-bloat provoking legume pastures were examined. It was found that the temperate non-bloating legumes contained condensed tannins which precipitated the soluble leaf proteins and thus by removing the plant foaming agents from solution inhibited foam production from these extracts. These tannins were isolated from Lotus pedunculatus Cav., and were shown to form insoluble complexes, not only with the soluble leaf proteins, but with protozoal proteins, salivary mucoprotein, and the protein present in rumen liquor. Tannins were common in the Lotus species, but of the Trifolium species examined, they were found only in Trifolium arvense L [...] The significance of incorporation of tannins into bloating pastures in an attempt to eliminate bloat is discussed. The non-bloating tropical legumes, apart from the Desmodium species, did not contain tannins but were lower in soluble leaf protein, and the bloat potential could be correlated with the compressive strength of the foams derived from extracts of these plants...|$|R
40|$|Particulate matter (PM) {{suspended}} in air varies {{in size from}} nanometers to micrometers and contains {{a wide range of}} chemical components, including organic compounds, black carbon (soot), inorganic minerals and metals. Atmospheric aerosols are generated from either primary sources like volcanic eruptions, re-suspended soil dust, sea spray, vegetative detritus, fossil fuel and biomass combustion emissions; or secondary atmospheric reactions via gas-to-particle conversion of atmospheric gases. Particle size, abundance, and chemical composition determine how a particle interacts with light and other atmospheric constituents (e. g. gases, water vapor) in addition to its impact on human health. While atmospheric scientists have been working on characterizing atmospheric aerosols for many years, major gaps persist in understanding the properties of many globally-important sources. This dissertation provides new understanding of the chemical composition of biomass burning and sea spray aerosols. PM emissions from biomass burning vary by fuel, and depend on fuel type and composition, moisture content, and combustion conditions. Although biomass smoke is critically important in global climate and local-regional health impacts, the physical and chemical composition of biomass burning aerosol is still not fully understood in the case of peat, agricultural residues and cooking fires. The Fire Laboratory at Missoula Experiments (FLAME) were designed to fulfill these gaps to improve our understanding in both historically undersampled and well-studied fuels while adding new instrumentation and experimental methods to provide previously unavailable information on chemical properties of biomass burning emissions. Globally-important biomass fuels were combusted in a controlled environment, and PM was chemically characterized to compute fuel based emission factors (EF) as the amount of chemical species released per unit mass of fuel burned. We showed that chemical composition of PM varies for different fuel types and certain fuels types (e. g., peat and ocote) emit considerably high concentrations of polycyclic aromatic compounds that are associated with negative health effects. We also showed that PM from biomass smoke contains fluoride for the first time, at approximately 0. 1 % by weight. With respect to the annual global emissions of PM due to biomass burning, this makes biomass burning an important source of fluoride to the atmosphere. Further, peatland fire emissions {{are one of the most}} understudied atmospheric aerosol sources but are a major source of greenhouse gases globally and cause severe air quality problems in Asia. This thesis provides the first field-based emissions characterization study, for samples collected at peat burning sites in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. Using these EFs and estimates of the mass of fuel burned, it was estimated that 3. 2 - 11 Tg of PM 2. 5 were emitted to atmosphere during 2015 El Niño peat fire episode which is ~ 10 % of estimated total annual PM flux for biomass burning. Overall, these studies computed more representative EFs for previously undersampled sources like peat, and previously unidentified chemical species like fluoride that can be used to update regional and global emission inventories. The concentration and composition of organic compounds in sea spray aerosol (SSA) alters its optical properties, hygroscopicity, cloud condensation, and ice nucleation properties and thus affects Earth’s radiative budget. In the past, SSA has been difficult to characterize, because of low concentrations relative to background pollutants. Nascent SSA was generated during a mesocosm, using a wave-flume at the University of California, San Diego and was characterized for saccharides and inorganic ions in order to assess their relative enrichment in fine (PM 2. 5) and coarse (PM 10 - 2. 5) SSA and sea surface microlayer (SSML) relative to seawater. For the first time, we showed that saccharides comprise a significant fraction of organic matter in fine and coarse SSA contributing 11 % and 27 %, respectively. Relative to sodium, saccharides were enriched 14 - 1314 times in fine SSA, 3 - 138 times in coarse SSA, but only up to 1. 0 - 16. 2 times in SSML. The saccharide and ion concentration in SSML and <b>persistent</b> whitecap <b>foam</b> was quantitatively assessed by another mesocosm study performed under controlled conditions. We demonstrated that relative to sodium, saccharides were enriched 1. 7 - 6. 4 times in SSML and 2. 1 - 12 times in foam. Higher enrichment of saccharides in foam over the SSML indicates that surface active organic compounds become increasingly enriched on aged bubble film surfaces. Similarly, we showed that fine SSA contains saccharides characteristic of energy-related polysaccharides, while coarse SSA contains saccharides that are characteristic of structure-related polysaccharides. The ultrafiltration studies showed that structure-related polysaccharides effectively coagulate to form large particulate organic matter and size is likely the reason for their exclusion from small SSA. The enrichment of organic species in SSML, foam and SSA led to an enrichment of inorganic ions probably through chelation with organic molecules. Mean enrichment factors for major ions demonstrated the highest enrichment in fine SSA for potassium (1. 3), magnesium (1. 4), and calcium (1. 7). Consequently, due to these organic and inorganic enrichments, SSA develops a significantly different chemical profile compared to seawater. These improved chemical profiles of SSA should be used to develop laboratory proxies to further study the transfer of organic matter across the ocean-air interface and the physical properties of SSA.. Overall, the results presented in this dissertation provide new chemical profiles for previously understudied emission sources like peatland fire emissions, and previously unquantified chemical species like F- in biomass burning emissions and enrichment of saccharides and ions in SSA. These data could be used in updating regional and global emission inventories, atmospheric modeling and human exposure studies...|$|R
