Thus, this study aimed at evaluating the influence of pre-germination treatments, in addition to verifying the germination performance at different temperatures and in different substrates.

In experiment I, seeds were submitted to the following methods for overcoming dormancy: witness - Intact seeds (T 1) immersion in water at 100 °C for 1 (T 2), 2 (T 3), 3 (T 4), 4 (T 5), 5 (T 6) and 6 min (T 7), immersion in concentrated sulfuric acid for 1 (T 8), 4 (T 9), 7 (T 10), 10 (T 11) and 13 min (T 12), scarification on sandpaper n° 80 (T 13) and lopping in the region opposite the micropyle (T 14).
