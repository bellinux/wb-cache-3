40|$|In {{this work}} we {{investigate}} several {{important aspects of}} the structure theory of the recently introduced quasi-Hopf superalgebras (QHSAs), which play a fundamental role in knot theory and integrable systems. In particular we introduce the opposite structure and prove in detail (for the graded case) Drinfeld 2 ̆ 7 s result that the coproduct Delta 2 ̆ 7 =_ (<b>S</b> <b>circle</b> times <b>S)</b> (.) T (.) Delta (.) S- 1 induced on a QHSA is obtained from the coproduct Delta by twisting. The corresponding "Drinfeld twist" F-D is explicitly constructed, as well as its inverse, and we investigate the complete QHSA associated with Delta 2 ̆ 7. We give a universal proof that the coassociator Phi 2 ̆ 7 = (<b>S</b> <b>circle</b> times <b>S</b> <b>circle</b> times <b>S)</b> Phi (321) and canonical elements alpha 2 ̆ 7 = S(beta), beta 2 ̆ 7 = S(alpha) correspond to twisting, the original coassociator Phi = Phi (123) and canonical elements alpha, beta with the Drinfeld twist F-D. Moreover in the quasi-tri angular case, it is shown algebraically that the R-matrix R 2 ̆ 7 = (<b>S</b> <b>circle</b> times <b>S)</b> R corresponds to twisting the original R-matrix R with F-D. This has important consequences in knot theory, which will be investigated elsewhere...|$|R

Factors affecting the complexation of uranyl(VI) by these strongly basic ligands in anhydrous dmso are elucidated.

We examined 154 SNPs in 12 metastasis-related genes for associations with breast cancer risk, stratified by LN and ER status, in European-American (EA) and African-American (AA) women. Methods 2, 671 women enrolled in the Women 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 <b>s</b> <b>Circle</b> of Health Study were genotyped. Pathway analyses were conducted using the adaptive rank truncated product (ARTP) method, with pARTP 22 ̆ 03040. 10 as significant. Multi-allelic risk scores were created for the ARTP-significant gene(s). Single-SNP and risk score associations were modeled using logistic regression, with false discovery rate (FDR) p-value adjustment. ResultsAlthough single-SNP associations were not significant at pFDR< 0. 05, several genes were significant in the ARTP analyses. In AA women, significant ARTP gene-level associations included CDH 1 with LN+ (pARTP= 0. 10; multi-allelic OR= 1. 13, 95...|$|R
40|$|Swirling motions {{induced by}} a {{counter-rotating}} vortex pair (CVP) provides {{a mechanism to}} entrain fluid from the periphery of this structure and mix surrounding fluids with those within the vortex structure. Eventually, the vortices act upon each other transporting molecularly mixed fluid into the core flow. This mechanism has potential to increase efficiency with more complete mixing. Therefore, a mixer is proposed which directly induces counter rotating vortices by a three dimensional geometry. The proposed swirl mixer is designed to induce counter rotating vortices based on the potential flow theory, Milne-Thomson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Circle</b> Theorem and Rankine vortex. Twelve test models are developed during the optimization process. Design factors were examined using a seven-hole pressure probe to investigate velocity vector fields produced by the test models, thereby obtaining an optimum CVP mixer that maximized tangential velocity with uniform axial flow. The optimized design was fabricated from Inconnel 718 using the Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS) technology. ...|$|R
