50|$|There {{are many}} {{strategies}} to cultural management. Establishment of new trees that are disease free {{by trying to}} plant trees {{as soon as they}} are received from the nursery {{to reduce the amount of}} stress the tree undergoes to reduce the amount of dead tissue. Apply insecticides to prevent insects such as, <b>peach</b> <b>tree</b> <b>borer</b> to prevent disease causing conidia from entering wounded parts of the tree that the insects create. Prune trees appropriately and at the correct time when buds start to break to promote wide angled branching. Infection at pruning sites is less common when done during late spring because of the smaller amount of inoculum present at this time. Inspect trees occasionally and removed any dead branches to prevent infection at these sites. Training trees properly also helps foster decreased amount of disease. Training trees during the first season to have branches develop wide crotch angles to sustain long orchard life. Avoid excessive and late fertilization during cold season to avoid low temperature injury. Fertilize trees during the early spring to prevent cold-susceptible growth.|$|E

50|$|Xanthocryptus novozealandicus, {{the lemon}} <b>tree</b> <b>borer</b> parasite, is a wasp {{in the family}} Ichneumonidae. It is a native insect of New Zealand.

When a suitable host is found, the female pushes her ovipositor through the wood and injects her eggs into the grub. This has the incidental benefit of helping to control some pests.

40|$|Abstract: The shoot {{branching}} {{patterns of}} the two-year-old branches of <b>peach</b> <b>trees</b> (Prunus persica (L.) Batsch cv. Elberta) were compared with different pruning measures. The branches were divided into a basal non-branching zone, a proleptic branching zone, a sylleptic branching zone and the part removed. We used the hidden semi-Markov model to capture the branching patterns. The final results showed that theoretical probability distributions of diverse lateral shoots of the parent branches calculated {{on the basis of}} the parameters of the hidden semi-Markov chain model were in good agreement with probabilities extracted from the observed data. This paper described the quantitative effects of pruning on branching architecture of a parent branch, taking into account of branch morphology. Results suggest that the hidden semi-Markov model could be used as an effective tool to describe the branching patterns. In addition, the application of hidden semi-Markov models to predict the effects of pruning on <b>peach</b> <b>tree</b> branching pattern based on growth parameters was discussed.

40|$|ABSTRACT <b>Peach</b> <b>Tree</b> Short Life (PTSL) is a {{syndrome}} {{characterized by}} a plant collapse {{at the end of}} dormancy, which causes include several biotic and abiotic components. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the C/N ratio and bark nutrients in symptomatic and asymptomatic short-life <b>peach</b> <b>trees.</b> Live tissue portions were removed from the bark of the main scaffolds of symptomatic and asymptomatic adjacent trees in nine commercial peach orchards located in Pelotas and Canguçu, state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. In laboratory, carbon (C), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium(Ca), magnesium (Mg), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), boron (B) contents and C/N ratio were determined. The main component analysis of the study variables did not allow the formation of different groups between symptomatic and asymptomatic short-life <b>peach</b> <b>trees.</b> <b>Peach</b> <b>trees</b> with visible PTSL symptoms had higher N, P and K contents and lower C/N ratio in the bark of the main scaffolds in the early sprouting season...|$|R
