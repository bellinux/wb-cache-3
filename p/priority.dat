5|$|Although XXBomber Command began {{preparations}} {{to attack}} on Singapore Naval Base again on 6February, this raid was cancelled {{on the third}} of the month by Admiral Louis Mountbatten, the commander of Allied forces in the Southeast Asian theatre. Mountbatten ordered that the naval installations at Singapore and Penang not be targeted as they would be needed by Allied forces following the projected liberation of Malaya and Singapore later in 1945. After requesting clarification of this order, Ramsey met with Mountbatten at Kandy. In this meeting Mountbatten assigned targets in the Kuala Lumpur area as XXBomber Command's first <b>priority,</b> while second <b>priority</b> was given to carefully selected areas of Singapore. These areas excluded the King GeorgeVI Graving Dock and several other docks and areas with heavy machinery, but allowed attacks on the West Wall area of Singapore Naval Base, naval oil stores and commercial dock facilities. Saigon was assigned as XXBomber Command's third <b>priority</b> and fourth <b>priority</b> was given to oil storage dumps on islands near Singapore.|$|E

Movement Control suggested that a special <b>priority</b> be allocated to such cases, and Major General Frank Berryman suggested calling it <b>priority</b> Neil after Fairley himself.

40|$|Abstract]: The most {{important}} technology and management <b>priorities</b> {{considered to be}} problematic and challenging for the chief information officer (CIO) can be identified by determining where significant performance gaps exist for individual <b>priorities.</b> Previous studies have identified the key technology and management <b>priorities</b> for CIOs but, surprisingly, have not evaluated the performance of these <b>priorities.</b> In 30 in-depth interviews, CIOs rated the importance and performance of 10 key technology and 10 key management <b>priorities</b> identified in a previous large-scale survey of CIOs. Significant performance gaps exist for four management and four technology <b>priorities.</b> Furthermore, the following technology and management <b>priorities</b> which exhibited performance gaps have remained constant <b>priorities</b> over time: align IT with business goals; IT-enabled process improvement; integrate/enhance systems and processes; and ensure data security and integrity. This research contributes to theory by identifying the {{most important}} technology and management <b>priorities</b> in ICT which exhibit performance gaps. Where the performance gaps exist in technology and management <b>priorities,</b> more attention and resources need to be dedicated by CIOs to the management of ICT, and to resolving the associated technology challenges...|$|R
40|$|Trade-offs between {{competitive}} <b>priorities</b> {{are often}} seen as exogenous – managers accept them as a given downside while simultaneously addressing multiple competitive <b>priorities.</b> However, some companies seem to face fewer trade-offs than others. The question is how companies reduce their trade-offs to successfully compete on multiple competitive <b>priorities</b> simultaneously. We address this question by theorising that bundles of action programmes are needed to reduce trade-offs between competitive <b>priorities.</b> We examine four Swiss manufacturing plants and show how the selection of action programmes influences the simultaneous competition on multiple competitive <b>priorities.</b> We show that successful competition on multiple competitive <b>priorities</b> does not happen by accident but is achieved by aligning competitive <b>priorities,</b> action programmes, infrastructural/structural changes and contextual factors...|$|R

40|$|The {{objectives}} of this thesis were (1) to identify older women's health <b>priorities</b> for promoting physical, {{psychological and social}} well-being; and (2) to measure {{the extent to which}} women perceive that their health <b>priorities</b> are being met. A qualitative methodology using 3 focus group sessions with 36 community-dwelling women aged 65 year and older was used to elicit older women's health <b>priorities.</b> <b>Priorities</b> were categorized into three groups: disease-related <b>priorities,</b> disability-related <b>priorities,</b> and psychosocial-related <b>priorities.</b> A questionnaire was developed to quantify the extent to which women perceive that these different <b>priorities</b> are being addressed. The survey was administered to a convenience sample of 609 community-based women aged 55 [...] 93 years (mean age 70 +/- 9 years) attending outpatient medical clinics. Unaddressed disability-related <b>priorities</b> were most prevalent. Women aged 75 years and older were significantly less likely to perceive that their <b>priorities</b> were unmet compared to younger mature women (OR 0. 564; 95 % confidence interval: 0. 387 [...] 0. 821) when adjusting for other health and socio-demographic variables. The implications of these findings and opportunities for improving preventive health care for older women are discussed...|$|R

40|$|This work {{is aimed}} at the life <b>priorities</b> of a patient {{within the context of}} nursing. The {{research}} is focused on the ideas of general nurses of the preferred life <b>priorities</b> of a patient, if there are differences in the ideas of general nurses and the preferred life <b>priorities</b> of a patient, if general nurses take interest in the life <b>priorities</b> of a patient and if they include the work with life <b>priorities</b> within the nursing process. In order to do the research, the method of quantitative collection of data was used, with the aid of the questionnaire technique. Two questionnaires were formed. The first questionnaire, of my own making, for general nurses was distributed among nurses working in hospitals {{in the area of the}} city of Plzeň. The other questionnaire, of my own making, for patients was distributed among patients hospitalized or visiting particular departments in hospitals in the area of the city of Plzeň. The research was carried out with the approval of the head nurse. Four aims of this Bachelor's Thesis were stated. The first one aims at assessment of nurses' ideas of the life <b>priorities</b> of a patient and if they consider these an important part of the nursing process. The second aim deals with the question if general nurses are willing to include the work with the patient's life <b>priorities</b> within the nursing process. The third one focuses on the conditions that general nurses have in order to include the life <b>priorities</b> of a patient within the nursing process. The fourth aim deals with the differences between the life <b>priorities</b> preferred by patients and ideas of general nurses of patients' life <b>priorities.</b> General nurses mostly consider life <b>priorities</b> of a patient an important part of the nursing process and most of them are willing to include the work with life <b>priorities</b> of a patient in the nursing process. Patients mostly perceive the care of their life <b>priorities</b> from nurses' side as insufficient. Although illnesses have changed patients' life <b>priorities,</b> some of them could have become unaccomplished, not all general nurses are interested in each patient's life <b>priorities.</b> There have been differences between life <b>priorities</b> preferred by patients and ideas of general nurses of life <b>priorities</b> of patients. The specific theories have been affirmed: T 1 : General nurses consider working with life <b>priorities</b> of patients as important. T 2 : General nurses are willing to include the work with life <b>priorities</b> of patients into the nursing process, if certain conditions are granted. T 3 : Work with patients' life <b>priorities</b> within the nursing process is more frequently influenced by working conditions of general nurses than life <b>priorities</b> preferred by patients. This Bachelor's Thesis may be used when teaching students preparing for the a non-physician medical profession. It may be recommended to general nurses as well as management workers as a tool of increasing the quality of nursing care within psychosocial care...|$|R
