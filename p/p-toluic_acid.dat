The solubilitymelting point relationship of the ensuing co-crystal or salt is not fully understood. In this thesis, a series of model co-crystals and pharmaceutical co-crystals and salts of baclofen were investigated. The model co-crystals were prepared from 4, 4 ’-bipyridine (BIPY) and 1, 2 -bis(4 -pyridyl) ethane (ETBIPY) used as host compounds which were combined {{with a series of}} carboxylic acids as co-formers, such as <b>p-toluic</b> <b>acid</b> (PTA), rac-phenylbutyric acid (racPBA), racemic and S-phenylsuccinic acid (racPSA and S-PSA, respectively). In the second part, six new multicomponent crystals of baclofen (BAC, (RS) 4 -amino- 3 -(4 - chlorophenyl) -butanoic acid), were prepared with mono- and dicarboxylic acids: two pharmaceutical co-crystals obtained with benzoic acid (BAC•BA) and <b>p-toluic</b> <b>acid</b> (BAC•PTA) and four pharmaceutical salts with 1 -hydroxy- 2 -naphthoic acid, (BAC+) (HNA-), oxalic acid, 2 (BAC+) (OA 2 -), maleic acid, (BAC+) (MA-) and p-toluene sulfonic acid, (BAC+) (PTSA-) •IPA. The compounds prepared were analysed by single crystal and powder X-ray diffractometry, differential scanning calorimetry and their solubility was measured in water and ethanol. From the analysis of the model co-crystals it was concluded that their aqueous solubility is inversely related to the melting point values and this can be explained by packing features. Also, the introduction of a chiral building block, compared to its racemic counterpart, is a valuable way to limit the formation of the intermolecular interactions in the new multicomponent crystal and thus decrease the efficiency of the packing which eventually leads to lower melting points and better solubility. The analysis of the baclofen crystals suggests that a strong, robust and predictable hydrogen bonding network with a combination of molecular building blocks which show acceptable molecular flexibility is a good recipe for successful co-crystal design...|$|E

40|$|C-Scorpionate vanadium(IV) [VOxCl 3 -x{k(3) -RC(pz) (3) }] [pz = pyrazol- 1 -yl; x= 0, R = SO 3 (1); x = 1, R= CH 2 OH (2) or CH 2 OSO 2 Me (3) ] {{complexes}} {{supported on}} functionalized carbon nanotubes (CNTs) {{are the first}} V-scorpionate catalysts used so far for the neat oxidation of o-, m- or p-xylene, with TBHP (70 % aqueous solution), to the corresponding toluic acids (main products), tolualdehydes and methylbenzyl alcohols. Remarkably, a <b>p-toluic</b> <b>acid</b> yield of 43 % (73 % selectivity, TON = 1. 34 V 10 (3)) was obtained with 2 @CNT in a simple microwave-assisted mild oxidation procedure, using a very low catalyst charge (3. 2 x 10 (- 2) mol% vs. substrate). Further, this occurred {{in the absence of}} any bromine source, what is significant towards the development of a greener and more sustainable process for oxidation of xylenes. Moreover, reuse of catalysts with preservation of their activity was found for up to six consecutive cycles. The effects of reaction parameters, such as reaction time, temperature, amount of catalyst or type of heating source, on the performance of the above catalytic systems are reported and discussed. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E
40|$|The {{inhibition}} of the type- 3 copper enzyme tyrosinase by halide ions was studied by kinetic and paramagnetic (1) H NMR methods. All halides are inhibitors in {{the conversion of}} l- 3, 4 -dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-DOPA) with apparent inhibition constants that follow the order I(-) Cl(-) > Br(-) >> I(-)) and reduced (affinity I(-) > Br(-) > Cl(-) >> F(-)) enzyme. The paramagnetic (1) H NMR of the oxidized enzyme complexed with the halides {{is consistent with a}} direct interaction of halide with the type- 3 site and shows that the (Cu-His(3)) (2) coordination occurs in all halide-bound species. It is surmised that halides bridge both of the copper ions in the active site. Fluoride and chloride are shown to bind only to the low pH form of oxidized tyrosinase, explaining the strong pH dependence of the inhibition by these ions. We further show that <b>p-toluic</b> <b>acid</b> and the bidentate transition state analogue, Kojic acid, displace chloride from the oxidized active site, whereas the monodentate substrate analogue, p-nitrophenol, forms a ternary complex with the enzyme and the chloride ion. On the basis of the experimental results, a model is formulated for the inhibitor action and for the reaction of diphenols with the oxidized enzyme...|$|E
40|$|A novel sulfate-reducing {{bacterium}} isolated from fuel-contaminated subsurface soil, strain PRTOL 1, mineralizes toluene {{as the sole}} electron donor and carbon source under strictly anaerobic conditions. The mineralization of 80 % of toluene carbon to CO 2 was demonstrated in experiments with [ring-U- 14 C]toluene; 15 % of toluene carbon was converted to biomass and nonvolatile metabolic by-products, primarily the former. The observed stoichiometric ratio of moles of sulfate consumed per mole of toluene consumed {{was consistent with the}} theoretical ratio for mineralization of toluene coupled with the reduction of sulfate to hydrogen sulfide. Strain PRTOL 1 also transforms o- and p-xylene to metabolic products when grown with toluene. However, xylene transformation by PRTOL 1 is slow relative to toluene degradation and cannot be sustained over time. Stable isotope-labeled substrates were used in conjunction with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to investigate the by-products of toluene and xylene metabolism. The predominant by-products from toluene, o-xylene, and p-xylene were benzylsuccinic acid, (2 -methylbenzyl) succinic acid, and 4 -methylbenzoic acid (or <b>p-toluic</b> <b>acid),</b> respectively. Metabolic by-products accounted for nearly all of the o-xylene consumed. Enzyme assays indicated that acetyl coenzyme A oxidation proceeded via the carbon monoxide dehydrogenase pathway. Compared with the only other reported toluene-degrading, {{sulfate-reducing bacterium}}, strain PRTOL 1 is distinct in that it has a novel 16 S rRNA gene sequence and was derived from a freshwater rather than marine environment...|$|E
