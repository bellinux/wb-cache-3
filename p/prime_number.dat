5|$|If gcd(a,b)=1, then a and b {{are said}} to be coprime (or {{relatively}} prime). This property does not imply that a or b are themselves prime numbers. For example, neither 6 nor 35 is a <b>prime</b> <b>number,</b> since they both have two prime factors: 6=2×3 and 35=5×7. Nevertheless, 6 and 35 are coprime. No natural number other than 1 divides both 6 and 35, since they have no prime factors in common.|$|E
5|$|Since w divides both {{terms on}} the {{right-hand}} side, it must also divide the left-hand side, v. This result is known as Euclid's lemma.

Conversely, if a number w is coprime to each {{of a series of}} numbers a1, a2, …, a'n, then w is also coprime to their product, a1×a2×…×a'n.|$|E
5|$|Euler also {{pioneered the}} use of {{analytic}} methods to solve number theory problems. In doing so, he united two disparate branches of mathematics and introduced a new field of study, analytic number theory. In breaking ground for this new field, Euler created the theory of hypergeometric series, q-series, hyperbolic trigonometric functions and the analytic theory of continued fractions. For example, he proved the infinitude of primes using the divergence of the harmonic series, and he used analytic methods to gain some understanding of the way prime numbers are distributed.

As we know, the trend for accessing to the largest <b>prime</b> <b>numbers</b> due to using Mersenne theorem, although resulted in vast development of related numbers, however it has reduced the speed of accessing to <b>prime</b> <b>numbers</b> from one to five years. This paper could attain to theorems that are more extended than Mersenne theorem with accelerating the speed of accessing to <b>prime</b> <b>numbers.</b> Since that time, the reason for frequently using Mersenne theorem was that no one could find an efficient formula for accessing to the largest <b>prime</b> <b>numbers.</b> This paper provided some relations for <b>prime</b> <b>numbers</b> that one could define several formulas for attaining <b>prime</b> <b>numbers</b> in any interval; therefore, according to flexibility of these relations, it could be found a new branch in the field of accessing to great <b>prime</b> <b>numbers</b> followed by providing an algorithm {{at the end of this}} paper for finding the largest <b>prime</b> <b>numbers.</b> Comment: 12 pages, 5 main theorem, 3 table, 1 algorith...|$|R

40|$|The {{fundamental}} theorem of arithmetic {{states that}} any composite natural integer {{can be expressed}} in one and only one way {{as a product of}} <b>prime</b> <b>numbers.</b> This sets the understanding of the organization of <b>prime</b> <b>numbers</b> at the core of number theory. In this work we present a simple, self-consistent and deterministic scheme allowing to investigate further the intrinsic organization of <b>prime</b> <b>numbers.</b> Using this scheme, we establish an algorithm that yields the complete list of <b>prime</b> <b>numbers</b> below any preassigned limit x. Counting the latter yields π(x), the <b>number</b> of <b>prime</b> <b>numbers</b> below x. Based on preliminary tests on computing clusters available, a considerable gain in computational speed and algorithmic simplicity towards producing complete lists of large <b>prime</b> <b>numbers</b> is observed. At the core of the new scheme lays its ability to provide, in a deterministic way, complete lists of consecutive and composite odd numbers below any preassigned limit x. The complete list of <b>prime</b> <b>numbers</b> below x is deduced from the latter. The two key ingredients of the scheme are a set of eleven generic tables, coupled with a three-criteria test applied on the differences between pairs of the consecutive composite odd numbers initially obtained. Since it leads to counting all the elements of a complete list of <b>prime</b> <b>numbers</b> up to x, our deterministic scheme provides a new approach to the long standing problem of " how many <b>prime</b> <b>numbers</b> are there below any preassigned limit x ". The said scheme therefore potentially contributes towards studies aimed at unveiling the organization of <b>prime</b> <b>numbers.</b> We illustrate the latter in a follow-up paper, Paper II [3], where we propose a new perspective on the Riemann hypothesis...|$|R
