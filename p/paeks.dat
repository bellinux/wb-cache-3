Described here is the design of novel sulfonated <b>PAEKs</b> (SPAEKs) and nonsulfonated <b>PAEKs</b> containing crown ether units in the main chain, {{which can be used}} in sensing applications and ion-selective membranes. To this end, 4, 4 ′(5 ′) -di(hydroxybenzo) - 18 -crown- 6 was synthesized and used as monomer in a step growth polymerization to form crown ether-containing <b>PAEKs</b> and SPAEKs. The successful synthesis of <b>PAEKs</b> containing 18 -crown- 6 and sulfonate groups was confirmed by gel permeation chromatography, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Membranes are fabricated from the sulfonated polymers. Potassium ion transport properties of the SPAEK and crown ether-containing SPAEK membranes are assessed by diffusion dialysis.

40|$|The crystal {{structure}} of Poly Aryl Ether Ketones (<b>PAEKs)</b> fabricated using {{a range of}} manufacturing processes has been investigated by high resolution electron microscopy. The study has revealed a hierarchical spherulitic {{crystal structure}}, different from the common spherulite morphology with lamellae grown in a radial direction. Results show that spherulites in laser sintered <b>PAEKs</b> are built of granular crystal blocks of 75 - 145 nm in size self-assembled along the radial direction. The study also showed that the granular crystal blocks are composed of small primary crystals approximately 20 - 30 nm in size combined together with a secondary structure.

40|$|This {{research}} project reports {{a new approach}} to thermoplastic composite matrix design, in which a low-MW polymer additive acts as a plasticiser and flow-promoter at high temperatures, but as a non-covalent cross-linking agent at lower temperatures. Thus, poly(aryl ether ketone) s (<b>PAEKs)</b> are functionalised with π-electron rich terminal groups and blended with π-electron deficient polyimides. A non-covalent charge-transfer stacking interaction between the two polymers forms a self-assembled supramolecular network. Carbon fibre composites with matrices composed of these supramolecular polymer blends were produced, and the thermomechanical performance of these materials are reported. In designing functionalised <b>PAEKs,</b> novel benzoyl-pyrene and -perylene derived compounds were synthesised. The synthesis of these compounds and their subsequent use as functional end-groups in polycondensations are also discussed. During the course of polymer synthesis, the effect of varying polymerisation conditions involving different alkali metal carbonates was systematically investigated. It was found that monomer sequence distribution in <b>PAEKs</b> can be controlled by changing the alkali metal cation used in the nucleophilic synthesis. The mechanism of modifying monomer sequence distribution is presented herein. Investigating the interaction of polycyclic aromatic molecules pyrene and perylene with binary co-polyimides containing both strongly-binding and weakly-binding diimide sequences results in the emergence of fractal-like patterns in the 1 H NMR spectra of the polyimide. The polyimide spectrum at high intercalator loadings shows self-similarity over a range of different length scales...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{objective}} of the present paper is to investigate the potential of an artificial neural network technique to predict the weight loss of various polyaryletherketones (<b>PAEKs)</b> and their composites in a three-body abrasive wear situation. Back-propagation neural networks {{have been used to}} predict the weight loss based on an experimental database in a three-body abrasive wear situation. The results show that the predicted data are perfectly acceptable when compared to the actual experimental test results. Hence a well-trained artificial neural networks (ANNs) system is expected to be very helpful for estimating the weight loss in the complex three-body abrasive wear situation of polymer composites.

Raman shifts of A 1 (LO) and E 1 (TO) band <b>paeks</b> at threading screw dislocation(TSD) were investigated in n-type on/off-axis 4 H- and 6 H-SiC single crystal wafers by micro-Raman scattering at room temperature. The results showed that A 1 (LO) band were shifted toward higher frequency while the E 1 (TO) band were shifted toward lower frequency on the on-axis wafers. The shifts are caused by increasing electron concentration and lattice disorder near the dislocation core, respectively. In the off-axis wafer, no shift was observed possibly due to the measurement geometry which does not contain whole dislocation core...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the development of the Ketonex dispersion process in order to reliably and reproducibly produce PEKK dispersions with controlled properties, together with the modification of pre-existing process parameters to achieve a range of particulate PAEK copolymers. Specific emphasis was placed on industrial considerations, pre-commercial scale-up and addressing potential materials applications. Chapter 1 explores well established methods for the production of <b>PAEKs</b> by both nucleophilic and electrophilic routes. General materials properties are described, and structure-property relationships are discussed. Chapter 2 describes in detail the process parameters associated with the Ketonex dispersion process. Parameters are discussed on a laboratory scale and are related to scale-up, industrial and commercial considerations. Chapter 3 evaluates the production of PEKKs with a range of T:I ratios by the dispersion process. The PEKKs are analysed using a range of techniques and are compared to literature data for process evaluation. Chapter 4 discusses the theory behind the action of the benzoic acid dispersant used in the dispersion process, which results in the production of fine particulate PEKK. A hypothesis involving the nucleation of polymerisation by aluminium benzoate is proposed. Chapter 5 demonstrates how the dispersion process can be modified to produce a range of PAEK copolymers. The incorporation of imide and sulfone co-monomers are evaluated in detail, while a selection of alternative monomers undergo preliminary evaluation. Chapter 6 addresses an epoxy toughening application. Amine end-capped <b>PAEKs</b> are produced by the dispersion process by in situ functionalisation. A protected end-capper is devised, its attachment and deprotection confirmed through a model compound approach and is successfully applied to the polymerisation system. </p...|$|E

40|$|Amine {{end-capped}} polyaryletherketones (<b>PAEKs)</b> {{are available}} by a dispersion process using a protection-deprotection strategy with an end-capping aminoaromatic derivative which adds no further {{steps to the}} dispersion polymerisation method. A model compound approach was employed to demonstrate successful amine attachment to the polymer, together with its compatibility and suitability within the polymer system. This approach was also successful for linear and trifunctional versions. Scale-up of the PAEK dispersion synthesis to 300 g batches was achieved. Amine end-capped poly(ether ketone ketone) (PEKK) with 100 : 0, 80 : 20, 60 : 40 terephthaloyl (T) :isophthaloyl (I) ratios, along with branched PEKK and PEKK-imide copolymers, were synthesised.

40|$|Novel {{amorphous}} thermoplastic poly(phenylquinoxaline) s (PPQ), poly(aryl ether ketone) s (<b>PAEKs)</b> and poly(aryl ether phthalazine) s {{have been}} synthesized. The reaction of an aromatic Schiff's base and a tertiary amine incorporating an activated methylene moiety {{in the presence}} of strong base to produce an enamine has been investigated. Hydrolysis of the resulting enamines resulted in deoxybenzoins which were converted to benzils by a mild oxidation reaction. This chemistry was investigated as a possible method for the synthesis of the tetraketone compounds (sometimes called bisbenzils) which serve as monomers for poly(phenylquinoxaline) polymers. Two novel monomers have been prepared, the corresponding polymers with 1, 1 $ sp prime$, 2, 2 $ sp prime$-tetraminobiphenyl were synthesized and their physical properties evaluated. The novel polymers exhibited increased solvent resistance as compared to other PPQ polymers reported previously in the literature. Two novel fluorine containing monomers were synthesized and polymerized with commercial biphenols to produce amorphous, fluorinated poly(aryl ether ketone) s. The physical properties of these polymers were evaluated and compared to those of analogous nonfluorinated polymers in order to determine what benefits can be obtained by introducing fluorine into the polymer architecture. The fluorinated polymers were found to show enhanced solubility. They were readily soluble in solvents which contain a ketone moiety, such as acetone, or cyclohexanone. A novel dihalide monomer incorporating bulky 2 -naphthalenyl moieties was synthesized and polymerized with commercial biphenols in an attempt to obtain poly(aryl ether ketone) s with extremely high glass transition temperatures (Tg's). Several poly(aryl ether ketone) polymers were reacted with hydrazine monohydrate {{in the presence of}} a catalytic quantity of acid to produce poly(aryl ether phthalazine) s via ring closure of the o-diketone moiety in the backbone of the <b>PAEKs.</b> The resulting polymers are amorphous thermoplastics which displayed increased glass transition temperatures (Tg) and Young's moduli. It was found that the poly(aryl ether phthalazine) s undergo a thermal reaction above the Tg of the polymer resulting in a rearrangement of the phthalazine moiety to a quinazoline moiety. Some crosslinking of the polymers also occurs, resulting in insoluble polymers which showed an increase in the Tg...|$|E
40|$|Poly(aryl ether ketone) s (PAEK) {{are high}} {{performance}} thermoplastics, which are chemically robust, semi-crystalline, and stable at high temperatures. Of {{the family of}} <b>PAEKs,</b> poly(ether ether ketone) (PEEK) is a well-known semi-crystalline thermoplastic widely used for electronics, energy, industrial, and medical applications due to its resistance to solvents, radiation, heat, and other environmental factors. The traditional PEEK is prepared from 4, 4 ’-difluorobenzophenone (2) and disodium hydroquinone. However, a challenge is processability, since due to its highly crystalline nature, PEEK possesses very limited solubility. An approach to solve these issues is to pre-functionalize PEEK polymers synthesized by nucleophilic aromatic substitution from 3, 5 -difluorobenzophenone (1) and hydroquinone, which results in a pendant benzoyl group. By using varying ratios of 3, 5 -difluorobenzophenone (1) and 4, 4 ’-difluorobenzophenone (2) the degree of crystallinity in the polymer can be tailored. Herein, a series of semi-crystalline PEEK analogues bearing functional groups on the pendant benzoyl moiety, were synthesized and characterized in order to investigate the effects of structural variances on the thermal and solubility behavior...|$|E
