A constant marginal utility of consumption does not make this distinction, and leads to the result that richer countries should mitigate less.|$|E

The average <b>poor</b> <b>person</b> in sub-Saharan Africa is estimated to live on only 70 cents per day, and was poorer in 2003 than in 1973, indicating increasing poverty in some areas.

See also Sifre to Deuteronomy 110:2:1. Reprinted in, e.g., Sifre to Deuteronomy: An Analytical Translation. Translated by Jacob Neusner, volume 1, page 280.

Rabbi Abin observed that when a <b>poor</b> <b>person</b> stands at one's door, God stands at the person's right, as [...] says: [...] "Because He stands at the right hand of the needy."

2500|$|Rabbi Phinehas in {{the name}} of Rabbi Reuben {{interpreted}} the words [...] "If your brother grows poor [...] [...] [...] then shall his kinsman [...] [...] [...] redeem" [...] in [...] to exhort Israel to acts of charity. Rabbi Phinehas taught that God will reward with life anyone who gives a coin to a <b>poor</b> <b>person,</b> for the donor could be giving not just a coin, but life. Rabbi Phinehas explained that if a loaf costs ten coins, and a <b>poor</b> <b>person</b> has but nine, then the gift of a single coin allows the <b>poor</b> <b>person</b> to buy the loaf, eat, and become refreshed. Thus, Rabbi Phinehas taught, when illness strikes the donor, and the donor's soul presses to leave the donor's body, God will return the gift of life. Similarly, Rav Nahman taught that [...] exhorts Israel to acts of charity, because fortune revolves like a wheel in the world, sometimes leaving one poor and sometimes well off. And similarly, Rabbi Tanhum son of Rabbi Hiyya taught that [...] exhorts Israel to acts of charity, because God made the poor as well as the rich, so that they might benefit each other; the rich one benefiting the poor one with charity, and the poor one benefiting the rich one by affording the rich one the opportunity to do good. Bearing this in mind, when Rabbi Tanhum's mother went to buy him a pound of meat, she would buy him two pounds, one for him and one for the poor.|$|E
