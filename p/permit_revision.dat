40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been great {{interest}} {{in the use of}} adaptive features in clinical trials (i. e., changes in design or analyses guided by examination of the accumulated data at an interim point in the trial) that may make the studies more efficient (e. g., shorter duration, fewer patients). Many statistical methods have been developed to maintain the validity of study results when adaptive designs are used (e. g., control of the Type I error rate). Group sequential designs, which allow early stopping for efficacy in light of compelling evidence of benefit or early stopping for futility when the likelihood of success is low at interim analyses, have been widely used for many years. In this dissertation, we study several aspects of statistical issues in group sequential/ adaptive designs.

In the first project, we propose a pre-specified stepwise two-stage sample size adaptation to lessen the information on treatment effect that would be revealed. We minimize expected sample size among a class of these designs and compare efficiency with the fully optimized two-stage design, optimal two-stage grou...|$|R

40|$|Green {{infrastructure}} (GI) {{has been}} increasingly {{recognized as the}} most effective approach for major cities to manage {{the environmental impacts of}} stormwater runoff. However, adoption of this infrastructure has yet to achieve scale - in part, because these approaches can produce highly variable results and require site-specific testing to confirm cost-effectiveness. Meanwhile, pollution from runoff remains the largest source of contamination to urban waterways (NRC 2008). While green infrastructure pilot studies, called 'demonstration projects', have been conducted throughout the U. S. for several years with encouraging results, I wanted to better understand their role in furthering green infrastructure initiatives. I use the City of Boston (Boston) as a case study to explore how demonstration projects can further GI use. Boston recently entered a consent decree with the U. S. EPA and the Conservation Law Foundation to conduct three demonstration projects using GI, and to fulfill other pollution mitigation requirements. Boston will use these projects to test a variety of green infrastructural components meant to lessen the adverse impacts of runoff. To give context, I provide a brief history of stormwater management in Boston and highlight some of the current challenges that might benefit from pilot testing. After reviewing plans for these demonstration projects, along with two additional Boston-based GI projects, I discuss how these projects are designed to further the commonly cited project objectives, which include testing the physical performance of green infrastructure for expanded use, fostering interdepartmental learning to construct and maintain GI, cultivating public awareness of and support for GI, and achieving regulatory compliance. I argue that demonstration projects can have optimal impact when designed to consider testing opportunities that relate to all four objectives. I discovered that demonstration projects have particular value to cities to support fairness in stormwater discharge <b>permit</b> <b>revisions.</b> Also, green infrastructure's contribution to a healthier, urban experience is an under emphasized objective of these projects.

Improved information provided early in the process has reduced the need for agencies to request additional information; • Reduced violations [...] JARPA’s cover sheet is designed to inform applicants on which permits they need, resulting in fewer violations; • Reduced revisions and increased coordination between agencies [...] all permitting agencies will receive consistent information at the same time, encouraging early coordination on projects.

40|$|Current pattern-detection {{proposals}} for streaming data {{recognize the need}} to move beyond a simple regular-expression model over strictly ordered input. We continue in this direction, relaxing restrictions present in some models, removing the requirement for ordered input, and <b>permitting</b> stream <b>revisions</b> (modification of prior events). Further, recognizing that patterns of interest in modern applications may change frequently over the lifetime of a query, we support updating of a pattern specification without blocking input or restarting the operator. Our new pattern operator (called AFA) is a streaming adaptation of a non-deterministic finite automaton (NFA) where additional schema-based user-defined information, called a register, is accessible to NFA transitions during execution. AFAs support dynamic patterns, where the pattern itself can change over time. We propose clean order-agnostic patterndetection semantics for AFAs, with new algorithms that allow a very efficient implementation, while retaining significant expressiveness and supporting native handling of out-of-order input, stream revisions, dynamic patterns, and several optimizations. Experiments on Microsoft StreamInsight show that we achieve event rates of more than 200 K events/sec (up to 5 × better than simpler schemes). Our dynamic patterns give up to orders-of-magnitude better throughput than solutions such as operator restart, and our other optimizations are very effective, incurring low memory and latency. ...|$|R
