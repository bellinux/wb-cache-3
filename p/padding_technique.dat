40|$|Abstract. Coron et al. {{proposed}} the ES-based scheme PSS-ES which realizes an encryption scheme and a signature scheme {{with a unique}} <b>padding</b> <b>technique</b> and key pair. The security of PSS-ES as an encryption scheme {{is based on the}} partial-domain one-wayness of the encryption permutation. In this paper, we propose new ES schemes OAEP-ES, OAEP++-ES, and REACT-ES, and prove their security under the assumption of only the one-wayness of encryption permutation. OAEP-ES, OAEP++-ES, and REACT-ES suit practical implementation because they use the same <b>padding</b> <b>technique</b> for encryption and for signature, and their security proof guarantees that we can prepare one key pair to realize encryption and signature {{in the same way as}} PSS-ES. Since one-wayness is a weaker assumption than partial-domain one-wayness, the proposed schemes offer tighter security than PSS-ES. Hence, we conclude that OAEP-ES, OAEP++-ES, and REACT-ES are more effective than PSS-ES. REACT-ES is the most practical approach in terms of the tightness of security and communication efficiency. ...|$|E

Study Design: A prospective study of patients diagnosed of unilateral or bilateral oroantral communication (OAC) closed using the buccal fat pad between May 2012 and January 2013 was performed. Data analysis extended to: age, sex, and cause, location and size of oroantral communication. Complications and success related to buccal fat pad surgery were evaluated. Also, patient satisfaction was assessed after six months of surgery. Results: Nine patients (3 men and 6 women) {{with a mean age of}} 50. 5 years and 11 OAC treated with buccal fat pads were included. The most common cause of oroantral communication was the extraction of molars. The average widest diameter of the oroantral communication was 7. 1 mm. One week after the surgeries no complications were found. One month after surgery, one patient presented persistence of the oroantral communication; in this patient, the buccal fat <b>pad</b> <b>technique</b> was considered a failure, and a second intervention was performed using a buccal mucoperiosteal flap to achieve primary closure of soft tissues.

In particular, recent research revealed that many high profile Web applications might cause private user information to leak from encrypted traffic due to side-channel attacks exploiting packet sizes and timing.

In this paper, we propose a novel k-indistinguishable traffic <b>padding</b> <b>technique</b> to achieve the optimal tradeoff between privacy protection and communication and computational cost. Specifically, we first present a formal model of the privacy-preserving traffic padding (PPTP).

Finally, we confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithms by comparing them to existing solutions through experiments using real-world Web applications. ...|$|E

Two types of arbitrarily shaped cod-ing, which guarantee equivalence {{between the number of}} pixels inside shapes and DCT coefficients to be coded, are proposed as [3] and [4]. These methods obtain same DCT coefficients, and the difference is that the former calculates outside pixel values from the inside whereas the latter varies the inside pixels by themselves. They are based on 1 D-DCT; therefore, 1 D-DCT must be executed twice, namely horizontal and vertical directions. This procedure does not guarantee the equivalence. In this paper, we extend their method to two-dimensional transform. In addition, we discuss methods to optimize position of DCT coefficients and pixels using statistical model.
