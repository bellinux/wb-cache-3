5|$|Bär's 204th and 205th victories, {{against two}} Hawker Typhoons, were {{achieved}} on 1 January 1945 during Unternehmen Bodenplatte, a Luftwaffe mass attack against Allied airfields in the Benelux area. The operation resulted {{in hundreds of}} aircraft losses on both sides. Bär's JG3 contributed by raiding Eindhoven in the Netherlands, shooting down about six RAF fighters and destroying many aircraft on the ground. One of Bär's 'aerial kills' {{may not have been}} airborne. Historian Norman Franks states both aircraft, from No. 438 Squadron RAF, were taxiing when hit. Flight Lieutenant <b>Pete</b> <b>Wilson</b> was wounded and later died from his injuries after Bär's strafing attack. The second Typhoon did get airborne. Its pilot, Flight Officer Ross Keller was killed. This version of events is contradicted by a witness, Pilot Officer 'Bill' Harle, who thought both aircraft were airborne.|$|E
5|$|In July 1987, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service {{expressed}} concerns that construction near the San Diego River crossing {{might result in}} the destruction of the endangered least Bell's vireo habitat. Two of the four alternative routes considered by Caltrans passed through the Carlton Hills golf course, which the public opposed. In April1988, the Sierra Club denounced the Prospect Avenue route; federal negotiators recommended shifting the route from Hollins Lake towards the golf course. Environmental concerns raised in June1988 related to the least Bell's vireo included decrease of insects, a darker environment after overpasses are constructed, and the fragmenting of habitat. Nevertheless, Caltrans still desired the Prospect Avenue route over concerns of a more expensive and less traveled northern route. Upset because of the delays, the Santee City Council wrote to U.S. senators <b>Pete</b> <b>Wilson</b> and Alan Cranston, asking for their assistance. Councilman Jim Bartell alleged that the issue would affect the city council elections.|$|E

In addition to her husband and immediate family, former presidents Ronald Reagan and Gerald Ford and their wives, Nancy and Betty, were also in attendance. Lady Bird Johnson was unable to attend because she was in the hospital recovering from a stroke, and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis did not attend either. President Nixon sobbed openly, profusely, and at times uncontrollably during the ceremony. It was a rare display of emotion from the former president, and Helen McCain Smith said that she had never seen him more distraught.|$|E

50|$|The 2006 {{race between}} {{incumbent}} Republican Heather Wilson and Democratic state Attorney General Patricia Madrid was a cliffhanger, with Wilson being reelected by 861 votes. John Kerry narrowly won the district with 52% in 2004 (CPVI=D+2). With {{the retirement of}} longtime U.S. Senator <b>Pete</b> Domenici, <b>Wilson</b> ran and lost {{as a candidate for}} the Republican nomination in the race for an open U.S. Senate seat, leaving this an open seat. The Democratic nominee was Martin Heinrich (former Albuquerque City Councilor).

25|$|In 1972 Santa Fe {{proposed}} to demolish {{the station and}} replace it with two 12-story buildings.

5000|$|CBC (Cork Broadcasting Company) 230m MW was {{the first}} pirate station in Cork in 1978.

50|$|Another {{event in}} this period that {{would prove to be}} of incalculable future {{importance}} to Columbia was the 1937 hiring of a new talent scout - music writer, producer and impresario John Hammond. Alongside his extraordinary significance as a discoverer, promoter, connector and producer of jazz, blues and folk artists during the swing music era, Hammond had already been of great help to Columbia - in 1932-33, through his involvement in the UK music paper Melody Maker, Hammond had arranged for the struggling US Columbia label to provide recordings for the UK Columbia label, mostly using the specially created Columbia W-265000 matrix series. Hammond recorded Fletcher Henderson, Benny Carter, Joe Venuti, and other jazz performers during a time when the economy was bad enough that many of them would not {{have had the opportunity to}} enter a studio and play real jazz (a handful of these in this special series were issued in the US). Hammond's work for Columbia was interrupted by his service during WWII, and he had less involvement with the music scene during the bebop era, but when returned to work as a talent scout for Columbia in the 1950s, his career proved to be of incalculable historical and cultural importance - the list of superstar artists he would discover and sign to Columbia over the course of his career included Charlie Christian, Count Basie, Teddy <b>Wilson,</b> <b>Pete</b> Seeger, Bob Dylan, Leonard Cohen, Aretha Franklin, Bruce Springsteen and Stevie Ray Vaughan, and in the early 1960s Hammond would also exert an enormous cultural effect on the emerging rock music scene thanks to his championing of reissue LPs of the music of blues artists Robert Johnson and Bessie Smith.|$|R
25|$|<b>Pete</b> <b>Wilson</b> {{was elected}} Governor of California to succeed {{outgoing}} two-term Republican governor George Deukmejian, who {{chose not to}} seek a third term in 1990, defeating former San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein, who {{would go on to}} be elected to Wilson's former U.S. Senate seat two years later.

25|$|As the {{fastest-growing}} demographic group, after Asians, Latinos are hotly contested by both parties. Immigration {{is an important}} political issue for this group. Backlash against illegal aliens led {{to the passage of}} California Proposition 187 in 1994, a ballot initiative which would have denied many public services to illegal aliens. Association of this proposal with California Republicans, especially incumbent governor <b>Pete</b> <b>Wilson,</b> drove many Hispanic voters to the Democrats.|$|E

25|$|In 1982, Brown {{chose not}} to seek a third term as governor; instead, {{he ran for the}} United States Senate for the seat being vacated by Republican S.I. Hayakawa.

After his Senate defeat in 1982, many considered Brown's political career to be over.|$|E
