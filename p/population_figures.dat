5|$|The empire's {{population}} was classified into white people, {{also referred to}} as Europeans, and non-white people, variously referred to as persons of colour, negros and natives. The largest ethnic grouping in the empire was Indians (including what are now Pakistanis and Bangladeshis), who were classified into a number of individual South Asian ethnic groups.

5|$|Kowloon Walled City's early {{population}} fluctuated between {{zero and}} a few hundred, and began growing steadily shortly after World War II.

Official census numbers estimated the Walled City's population at 10,004 in 1971 and 14,617 in 1981, but these figures were commonly considered to be much too low. Informal estimates, on the other hand, often mistakenly included the neighbouring squatter village of Sai Tau Tsuen. <b>Population</b> <b>figures</b> of about 50,000 were also reported.|$|E

5|$|<b>Population</b> <b>figures</b> for elk are {{in excess}} of 30,000—the largest {{population}} of any large mammal species in Yellowstone. The northern herd has decreased enormously since the mid‑1990s; this {{has been attributed to}} wolf predation and causal effects such as elk using more forested regions to evade predation, consequently making it harder for researchers to accurately count them. The northern herd migrates west into southwestern Montana in the winter. The southern herd migrates southward, and the majority of these elk winter on the National Elk Refuge, immediately southeast of Grand Teton National Park. The southern herd migration is the largest mammalian migration remaining in the U.S. outside of Alaska.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the free}} {{population}} 23.4% {{of males and}} 13.4% of females were considered literate. Men represented 52% (5,123,869) of the total <b>population.</b> <b>Figures</b> for the population by age showed 24.6% were children younger than 10 years old; 21.1% were adolescents and young men between 11 and 20; 32.9% were adults between 21 and 40; 8.4% were between 41 and 50; 12.8% were between 51 and 70; and lastly, only 3.4% were over 71. The residents in the combined northeast and southeast regions comprised 87.2% of the nation's population. The second national census was held in 1890 when the Brazilian republic {{was only a few}} months old. Its results showed that the population had grown to 14,333,915 inhabitants since the 1872 census.|$|E
5|$|Approximately 89.5 {{percent of}} {{residents}} {{over the age}} of five spoke English at home, according to the 2007–2011 American Community Survey. It was then estimated that 889 people, comprising 18.5 percent of local inhabitants have German ancestrythe largest ethnicity in Omakand 15.3 percent have Irish ancestry. The Omak area has a relatively high percentage of people of American Indian and Mexican ancestries; there were over 80 American Indians and over 535 Mexican immigrants, with a combined percentage of 28 percent of residents. Conversely, the city has a small Asian population, making up {{less than one percent of}} Omakians. The 2010 census showed that approximately 35 percent of residents lived alone, most of whom were female. Those {{over the age of}} 65 comprised about 16 percent of the population.

5|$|Las Casas {{has also}} often {{been accused of}} exaggerating the atrocities he {{described}} in the Indies, some scholars holding that the initial <b>population</b> <b>figures</b> given by him were too high, making the population decline look worse than it actually was, and that epidemics of European disease were the prime cause of the population decline, not violence and exploitation. Demographic studies {{such as those of}} colonial Mexico by Sherburne F. Cook in the mid-20th century suggested that the decline {{in the first years of}} the conquest was indeed drastic – ranging between 80 and 90%, due of course to many different causes, but all ultimately traceable to the arrival of the Europeans. The overwhelming main cause was disease introduced by the Europeans. It has also been noted that exaggeration of numbers was the norm in writing in 16th-century accounts, and both contemporary detractors and supporters of Las Casas were guilty of similar exaggerations.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} people counted in the census of 1381 was 59,873,305; however, this number dropped {{significantly}} when the government found that some 3 million people were missing from the tax census of 1391. Even though underreporting figures was made a capital crime in 1381, the need for survival pushed many to abandon the tax registration and wander from their region, where Hongwu had attempted to impose rigid immobility on the populace. The government tried to mitigate this by creating their own conservative estimate of 60,545,812 people in 1393. In his Studies on the Population of China, Ho Ping-ti suggests revising the 1393 census to 65 million people, noting that large areas of North China and frontier areas were not counted in that census. Brook states that the <b>population</b> <b>figures</b> gathered in the official censuses after 1393 ranged between 51 and 62 million, while the population was in fact increasing. Even the Hongzhi Emperor (r. 1487–505) remarked that the daily increase in subjects coincided with the daily dwindling amount of registered civilians and soldiers. William Atwell states that around 1400 the population of China was perhaps 90 million people, citing Heijdra and Mote.|$|E
5|$|An {{independent}} {{study by the}} French historian Bernard B. Fall determined that the US Navy transported around 310,000refugees. The French were credited with around 214,000airlifted refugees, 270,000seaborne refugees and 120,000 and 80,000 Vietnamese and French military evacuees respectively. During the US Navy voyages, 54 people died on board, and 111 babies were born. Fall believed that of the 109,000refugees who went south by their own means, a large number hitchhiked on southbound French transport vessels that were {{not related to the}} migration operation. Fall felt that the figures were likely to have been overestimated, due to immigration fraud. Some refugees would travel south and register themselves, before smuggling themselves onto vessels returning north for another shipment of humans. They would then return south and re-register to claim another aid package. Likewise, with instances of entire villages moving south, the authorities frequently did not explicitly count the number of villagers, but simply took the word of the village leaders. The chiefs would often inflate the <b>population</b> <b>figures</b> to claim more aid rations. The mass exodus did not disrupt the north largely because whole villages often emigrated, instead of half a village moving and leaving the remainder of the community in disarray. Fall estimated that around 120,000Viet Minh troops and their dependents went north. Most of these evacuations were attributed to Viet Minh military strategy, with some being ordered to stay behind in readiness for future guerrilla activities. The northward movement was facilitated by vessels leaving from assembly areas at Qui Nhơn and Cà Mau at the southernmost extremity of Vietnam. The voyages to North Vietnam were provided by empty French ships heading back north to fetch more southbound anti-communists, as well vessels from communist nations such as Poland. The Viet Minh also actively cultivated the Montagnard indigenous people of Vietnam, whose land in the Central Highlands was encroached upon by incoming northern settlers. The communists spread propaganda through broadcasts in tribal languages and infiltrated the highland areas. According {{to a study by the}} Michigan State University Group, some 6,000tribespeople went north with the communists, accompanied by some Viet Minh who had adopted the indigenous culture.|$|E
