40|$|Using {{finite element}} analyses, the authors {{investigated}} which muscle groups acting around the hip-joint most prominently affected the load distributions in cemented total hip reconstructions with a bonded and debonded femoral stem. The {{purpose was to}} determine which muscle groups {{should be included in}} <b>pre-clinical</b> <b>tests,</b> predicting bone adaptation and mechanical failure of cemented reconstructions, ensuring an adequate representation of in vivo loading of the reconstruction. Loads were applied as occurring during heel-strike, mid-stance and push-off phases of gait. The stress/strain distributions within the reconstruction, produced by the hip-joint contact force, were compared to ones produced after sequentially including the abductors, the iliotibial tract and the adductors and vastii. Inclusion of the abductors had the most pronounced effect. They neutralized lateral bending of the reconstruction at heel-strike and increased medial bending at mid-stance and push-off. Bone strains and stem stresses were changed accordingly. Peak tensile cement stresses were reduced during all gait phases by amounts up to 50 % around a bonded stem and 11 % around a debonded one. Additional inclusion of the iliotibial tract, the adductors and the vastii produced relatively small effects during all gait phases. Their most prominent effect was a slight reduction of bone strains {{at the level of the}} stem tip during heelstrike. These results suggest that a loading configuration including the hip-joint contact force and the abductor forces can adequately reproduce in vivo loading of cemented total hip reconstructions in <b>pre-clinical</b> <b>tests...</b>|$|R

It results from defects in the sub-sarcolemmal protein dystrophin, {{a component of}} the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC) which links the intracellular cy-toskeleton to the extracellular matrix.

40|$|Idiopathic {{scoliosis}} is {{the most}} common spinal deformity, and the brace treatment is the fundamental therapy. Brace works on the curve via the pressure they exert on the rib cage, usually on three points, to push against the progressive abnormal curvature of the spine and to reduce the local spasticity. Considering the possibility of the spine collapse, due to the six degrees of freedom of each vertebras with respect to the adjacent one, spine needs more thrusts relating to the curvature extension. This paper is focused on an innovative brace working by a three-dimensional thrusts system. The brace is internally covered by air pocket devices. Design and prototype of air pocket device is described. Air pockets apply the necessary corrective thrusts, at many levels of the spine, by compressed air at the specific pressure required in that area of the rib cage. Thrusts can be modified and checked. The design of the brace is presented together with a basic prototype, the design and the prototype of the air pocket device. First experimental tests on a simplified prototype of brace are also described. Finally, a <b>pre-clinical</b> <b>test</b> is performed by a healthy volunteer to validate the new brace concept...|$|R

40|$|Patello-femoral {{problems}} affect {{nearly a}} quarter of the population and remain a common cause of knee replacement revision surgery. Minimally invasive treatments such as osteochondral substitutions are early interventions {{that can be used to}} prevent or delay the need for these replacements. Lack of <b>pre-clinical</b> <b>testing</b> is a major challenge in getting these promising treatments to clinical trials. The purpose of this research was to develop a platform that can get these products one step closer to clinical trials and hence getting them out in the market as a viable product for treating osteochondral lesions. The aim of this project was to develop and validate a design specification for the <b>pre-clinical</b> <b>testing</b> of natural patello-femoral joint (PFJ). A characterization study was carried out to investigate the suitable animal model required to simulate a human joint that requires osteochondral substitutions. The size of the porcine PFJ was closer to the human PFJ and the material properties of its cartilage were also similar to the human cartilage. Therefore, the porcine PFJ was chosen as the animal model to develop the methodologies for this project. A methodology was developed to investigate wear of the natural porcine PFJ by adapting a single station knee simulator to apply the porcine PFJ gait cycle to the joints. The position of the patella with respect to the femur determined through a contact point study was used to set up the samples in the simulator. A positive (cobalt chrome on natural cartilage) and negative (cartilage on cartilage) control was used to investigate the wear. This study showed the potential of using an Alicona Infinite focus G 5 optical profiler to assess the change in cartilage topography in natural joints. The contact area and pressure in the PFJ was measured using Tekscan pressure sensors. This study showed the change in contact mechanics across a gait cycle and the effect of sample geometry on the contact mechanics of a joint. In-vitro simulation can reduce the need for animal testing and progress the preclinical trials for new tissue substitutions. Developing the methodology in a human knee is not practical. However, by establishing an animal model can bring this a step closer. The methods developed in this thesis can contribute towards creating a <b>pre-clinical</b> <b>testing</b> system that can be used to assess early interventions to the PFJ...|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} optimal size, shape, and {{placement}} of a proximal radius-fracture fixation-plate is addressed computationally using a combined finite-element/design-optimization procedure. To expand {{the set of}} physiological loading conditions experienced by the implant during normal everyday activities of the patient, beyond those typically covered by the <b>pre-clinical</b> implant-evaluation <b>testing</b> procedures, {{the case of a}} wheel-chair push exertion is considered.

40|$|Background Snakebite is a {{significant}} cause of death and disability in subsistent farming populations of sub-Saharan Africa. Antivenom {{is the most effective}} treatment of envenoming and is manufactured from IgG of venom-immunised horses/sheep but, because of complex fiscal reasons, there is a paucity of antivenom in sub-Saharan Africa. To address the plight of thousands of snakebite victims in savannah Nigeria, the EchiTAb Study Group organised the production, testing and delivery of antivenoms designed to treat envenoming by the most medically-important snakes in the region. The Echis saw-scaled vipers have a wide African distribution and medical importance. In an effort to maximise the clinical utility of scarce antivenom resources in Africa, we aimed to ascertain, at the pre-clinical level, to what extent the E. ocellatus-specific EchiTAbG antivenom, which was designed specifically for Nigeria, neutralised the lethal activity of venom from two other African species, E. pyramidum leakeyi and E. coloratus. Methodology/Principal Findings Despite apparently quite distinctive venom protein profiles, we observed extensive cross-species similarity in the immuno-reactivity profiles of Echis species-specific antisera. Using WHO standard <b>pre-clinical</b> in vivo <b>tests,</b> we determined that the monospecific EchiTAbG antivenom was as effective at neutralising the venom-induced lethal effects of E. pyramidum leakeyi and E. coloratus as it was against E. ocellatus venom. Under the restricted conditions of this assay, the antivenom was ineffective against the lethal effects of venom from the non-African Echis species, E. carinatus sochureki. Conclusions/Significance Using WHO-recommended <b>pre-clinical</b> <b>tests</b> we have demonstrated that the new anti-E. ocellatus monospecific antivenom EchiTAbG, developed in response to the considerable snakebite-induced mortality and morbidity in Nigeria, neutralised the lethal effects of venoms from Echis species representing each taxonomic group of this genus in Africa. This suggests that this monospecific antivenom has potential to treat envenoming by most, perhaps all, African Echis species...|$|R
