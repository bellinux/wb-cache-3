40|$|<b>Pruning</b> of trees, {{in which}} some {{branches}} are removed from the lower crown of a tree, has been extensively used in China in silvicultural management for many purposes. With an experimental and modelling approach, the effects of <b>pruning</b> on tree growth and on the harvest of plant material were studied. In Chapter 2 the aboveground biomass production and harvest of plant material of five subtropical Chinese tree species as affected by annual <b>pruning</b> were analysed. The biomass production of trees decreased following <b>pruning,</b> and the reduction in biomass production was correlated with <b>pruning</b> intensity. The results indicated that, for the investigated five subtropical tree species, the annual <b>pruning</b> regime could not provide enough time for a tree to fully recover its growth, which consequently prevented the sustainable gain of high harvests of plant materials. In Chapter 3, the aboveground biomass allocation and leaf dynamics of four tree species following <b>pruning</b> were investigated. <b>Pruned</b> trees allocated proportionally more of their aboveground biomass to leaves and less to wood, irrespective of species and <b>pruning</b> seasons. This allocation pattern {{was positively correlated with}} <b>pruning</b> intensity. The increased proportional allocation of aboveground biomass to leaves following <b>pruning</b> would benefit <b>pruned</b> trees to alleviate the negative <b>pruning</b> effects and recover from the <b>pruning</b> damage. Chapter 4 focuses on the leaf emergence and shoot production of trees after <b>pruning.</b> <b>Pruning</b> had no effect on the leaf density and shoot production. <b>Pruning</b> facilitated the shoot production on the bare stem parts beneath the remaining crown. In Chapter 5 the leaf efficiency of two Ficus tree species as affected by <b>pruning</b> is reported. The leaf efficiency of both species was increased after <b>pruning.</b> In Chapters 6, a tree growth model was constructed. In Chapter 7, this tree model was applied to simulate the effects of <b>pruning</b> on branch harvest, taking <b>pruning</b> intensity, <b>pruning</b> season, <b>pruning</b> frequency, and tree size at which <b>pruning</b> starts into consideration. To sum up, the effects of <b>pruning</b> on tree growth depended on many factors including <b>pruning</b> season, <b>pruning</b> intensity, <b>pruning</b> interval, tree species, and tree size. Heavy and repeated <b>pruning</b> with short intervals reduced tree growth always. This negative effect, however, can be mitigated to some extent by the increased biomass partitioning to leaves and the increased leaf productivity in the <b>pruned</b> tree...|$|R
40|$|This work compares {{mechanical}} <b>pruning</b> {{followed up}} by hand <b>pruning</b> versus manual <b>pruning</b> {{in the case}} of ‘Fortune’ mandarins. Yield and fruit quality were measured over a three-year period. Two mechanical <b>pruning</b> intensities were tested, these intensities being measured as the width of the row middles left free after mechanical <b>pruning.</b> Although there were differences in biomass and diameter of the branches that were cut, no differences were observed between the two mechanical <b>pruning</b> intensities in terms of yield or fruit quality. In all <b>pruning</b> treatments, fruit size reached the highest category. The <b>pruning</b> treatments consisted in: (i) hand <b>pruning</b> every year, (ii) mechanical <b>pruning</b> followed up by hand <b>pruning</b> every year, and (iii) alternating the two previous methods over the years studied. On analysing the accumulated fruit production of the three years, it can be observed that {{there were no significant differences}} in yield when mechanical <b>pruning</b> was alternated with hand <b>pruning</b> over the years. When only mechanical <b>pruning</b> was used for the three years, however, a 22 % reduction in yield was observed with respect to the treatment involving hand <b>pruning</b> alone.

5|$|Cropping {{systems can}} be {{modified}} to favor natural enemies, a practice {{sometimes referred to as}} habitat manipulation. Providing a suitable habitat, such as a shelterbelt, hedgerow, or beetle bank where beneficial insects such as parasitoidal wasps can live and reproduce, can help ensure the survival of populations of natural enemies. Things as simple as leaving a layer of fallen leaves or mulch in place provides a suitable food source for worms and provides a shelter for insects, in turn being a food source for such beneficial mammals as hedgehogs and shrews. Compost piles and stacks of wood can provide shelter for invertebrates and small mammals. Long grass and ponds support amphibians. Not removing dead annuals and non-hardy plants in the autumn allows insects to make use of their hollow stems during winter. In California, <b>prune</b> trees are sometimes planted in grape vineyards to provide an improved overwintering habitat or refuge for a key grape pest parasitoid. The providing of artificial shelters in the form of wooden caskets, boxes or flowerpots is also sometimes undertaken, particularly in gardens, to make a cropped area more attractive to natural enemies. For example, earwigs are natural predators which can be encouraged in gardens by hanging upside-down flowerpots filled with straw or wood wool. Green lacewings can be encouraged by using plastic bottles with an open bottom and a roll of cardboard inside. Birdhouses enable insectivorous birds to nest; the most useful birds can be attracted by choosing an opening just large enough for the desired species.|$|E

Secondly, we examine the ability of the minimax search to filter away <b>pruning</b> errors and give bounds on the rate of error propagation to the root.
