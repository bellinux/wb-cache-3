50|$|The {{responsibility}} of the classification society is to verify that merchant ships and marine structures presented to it comply with Rules that the society has established for design, construction and <b>periodic</b> <b>survey.</b> Classification itself does not judge the economic viability of a vessel.

40|$|Abstract—As Forest Inventory and Analysis {{changes from}} a <b>periodic</b> <b>survey</b> to a multipanel annual survey, a {{transition}} will occur where {{only some of}} the panels have been resurveyed. Several estimation techniques use data from the <b>periodic</b> <b>survey</b> in addition to the data from the partially completed multipanel data. These estimation techniques were compared using data from two periodic surveys from Georgia. The comparison criteria were based on (1) an estimated mean within the confidence interval derived from using the complete multipanel data set and (2) a small, estimated standard error that does not underestimate the complete data standard error. Multiple imputation matching performed best; the double sampling ratio estimator also performed well. Two methodssingle imputation using group means and single imputation using matched standsboth underestimated the standard error. Replacing the missing observations with growth model predictions using SETWIGS caused an overestimation of the mean...|$|E
