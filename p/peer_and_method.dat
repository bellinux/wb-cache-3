40|$|Introduction. Improvements in {{medicine}} have significantly prolonged life of chronically ill {{children and adolescents}} {{in the past several}} decades. There is a great variability in adaptation to illness among chronically ill persons - some of them seem to be very well adapted, with almost no problems. However, research results suggest that chronically ill children {{are more likely to have}} psychological problems than their healthy <b>peers.</b> Material <b>and</b> <b>methods.</b> Eighty-four subjects, all elementary school pupils, participated in the study. The first group included adolescents with chronical illness (malignant illness, insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, epilepsy, or asthma), and the second their healthy <b>peers.</b> Depression <b>and</b> social support were evaluated. The Birleson's Depression Scale and Perceived Social Support Scales (forms for friends and for family members) were used. Results and discussion. The results show significant differences for two of the three variables: depression, and perceived social support from family, while there was no significant difference for perceived social support from friends. The results suggest that chronically ill adolescents are more depressed and that they perceive that the social support they receive from their families is lower when compared to their healthy peers. Conclusion. The results of this study showed that chronically ill adolescents are more depressed than their healthy peers. This group of adolescents also perceives that they have less social support from their families than their healthy peers. When it comes to perceived social support from friends, these two groups do not differ. ...|$|R

The children with cerebral palsy took part in the skill-based activities and overall activities individually compared to the normal peers. The children with cerebral palsy, in comparison with their normal peers, often performed most of the activities inside the house.

Autism is a spectrum disorder with various labels, such as Asperger’s Syndrome and Pervasive Developmental Disorder, and can be classified as mild, moderate, severe and high functioning.

Numerous {{studies have}} {{characterized}} {{patients with chronic}} skin disease as psychologically vulnerable, mainly {{due to the fact}} that their condition affects their social relations and all other aspects of life. The purpose of this work was to determine whether there are significant differences in the level of anxiety, severity of depressive symptoms, and presence of stressful life events between adolescent patients with vitiligo <b>and</b> healthy <b>peers.</b> Material <b>and</b> <b>methods.</b> 33 patients with vitiligo aged 10 - 15 years, and a control group of 60 healthy subjects of the same age, were included in this prospective study. A clinical examination was performed to determine the clinical types of vitiligo, estimate depressive symptoms using the Birleson Depression Scale, and anxiety was evaluated by the Spielberger's scale (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory). For determination of the frequency of stressful events, the Risk Scale was used. Results. Adolescents with vitiligo did not show more pronounced signs of anxiety or depression than healthy subjects; differences were not apparent in the Risk Scale either, considering stressful events. Discussion and conclusion. The lack of differences between the two examined groups might be due to prepubertal age of the majority of subjects. 63. 63 % of all children included in this study were in the prepubertal age (10 - 12 years), which is the period when they are still not focused on their own body and changes to physical appearance. It is possible that early onset of vitiligo is a "protective factor", enabling the child to attain compensatory mechanisms to solve the problem of vitiligo through various interests and aspirations, which do not depend on physical appearance. ...|$|R
