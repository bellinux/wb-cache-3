40|$|The {{conjugated}} polymeric {{backbone of}} polydiacetylenes (PDAs), comprising of alternating eneyne groups, undergo intriguing stress-, chemical- or temperature-induced chromatic phase transitions {{associated with the}} disruption of the backbone structure and shortening of the conjugation length. PDAs, such as polymerized 10, 12 pentacosadiynoic acids (PCDA), when incorporated with inorganic oxides form nanocomposites and uniform blends with polymers. Blends of poly-PCDA with polymers, such as <b>polyvinyl</b> alcohol, polyvinylidene <b>fluoride</b> and cellulose increase the blue to red transition temperature without affecting the irreversibility of the red phase. However, the addition of zinc oxide to pure poly-PCDA makes the red phase highly reversible and substantially increases the blue to red transition temperature. The addition of TiO 2 to poly-PCDA {{on the other hand}} does not affect the irreversibility of the red phase and the chromatic transition temperature. In order to understand the atomic scale interactions associated with these changes in the chromatic transitions, we have investigated both the nanocomposites and polymer blends using Raman and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) measurements...|$|R

5000|$|PVF film {{lamination}} {{is made up}} of <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>fluoride</b> (commercially {{known as}} Tedlar). It consists of a film layer laminated to the PVC fabric during the manufacturing process. The result is a thicker fabric that can resist weather and chemical agents better than competing fabrics. Its self-cleaning ability repels such things as acid rain, graffiti, and bird droppings. Because of these characteristics it can often be found in use in industrialized areas, desert regions, and coastal zones. The thicker coating has a slow erosion rate, resulting in a life expectancy of approximately 25 years depending upon environmental conditions. This topcoating is flexible, which creates a strong and consistent bond to the PVC. PVF coated fabrics may be manufactured in a variety of colors, but are also subject to minimum manufacture runs. PVF coating also makes the fabric non-weldable. Seams are not overlapped, but instead are butted with an extra welded seam, then applied to the underside of the fabric that does not have a topcoating.|$|E
