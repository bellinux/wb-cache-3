Just before to the No. 2 Audi's accident, the GT1-leading Aston Martin had also come off the track, {{damaging}} its front splitter. The necessary repairs led to the car spending eight minutes in the garage, dropping it to fourth in class. The lone factory Corvette gained a <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> over second in class. Scuderia Ecosse's Ferrari briefly took over the GT2 lead after Risi's problems, but it too broke down on the track, handing the lead to the IMSA Performance Matmut Porsche. Binnie Motorsport's entry had a sizable lead in its class, having not suffered the many problems its LMP2 competitors had.|$|E
5|$|The NGC 4038 Group is a {{group of}} galaxies across Corvus and Crater. The group may contain between 13 and 27 galaxies. The best-known member is the Antennae {{peculiar}} galaxy, located 0.25 north of 31 Crateris. It consists of two interacting galaxies—NGC 4038 and 4039—that appear to have a heart shape as seen from Earth. The name originates from the huge tidal tails that come off the ends of the two galaxies, formed because of the spiral galaxies' original rotation. Both original galaxies were spiral galaxies and are now experiencing extensive star formation due to the interaction of gas clouds. The galaxies are 45 million light-years from Earth and each has multiple ultraluminous X-ray sources, the source of which is unknown. Astronomers theorize that they may be a rare type of x-ray emitting binary stars or intermediate-mass black holes. The Antennae Galaxies appear in a telescope at the 10th magnitude. SN 2004gt was a type Ic supernova that erupted on December 12, 2004. The progenitor was not identified from older images of the galaxy, and is either a type WC Wolf–Rayet star with a mass over 40 times that of the Sun, or a star 20 to 40 times as massive as the Sun in a binary star system. SN 2007sr was a Type Ia supernova event that peaked in brightness on December 14, 2007. The galaxy has been identified as a good <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> detailed images in case of further supernovae.|$|E

25|$|The only ways to {{the island}} are {{swimming}} or boating.

Any unpowered boats launched from the parking lot on the Pennsylvania side require a launch permit from the Pennsylvania Fish & Boat Commission. Larger boats should not attempt to approach the island's rocky shore line.

25|$|At {{the time}} of hatching, the young start calling within the eggs. They have an egg-tooth {{at the tip of}} their snouts, which is {{developed}} from the skin, and that helps them pierce out of the shell. Hearing the calls, the female usually excavates the nest and sometimes takes the unhatched eggs in her mouth, slowly rolling the eggs to help the process. The young is usually carried to the water in the mouth. She would then introduce her hatchlings to the water and even feed them. The mother would then take care of her young for over a year before the next mating season. In the absence of the mother crocodile, the father would act in her <b>place</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> care of the young. However, even with a sophisticated parental nurturing, young crocodiles have a very high mortality rate due to their vulnerability to predation. A group of hatchlings is called a pod or crèche and may be protected for months.|$|E

That same day Allenby's own estimate arrived, claiming that he would need 13 extra divisions (an impossible demand even if Haig’s forces went on the defensive) and that he might face 18 Turkish and 2 German divisions.
