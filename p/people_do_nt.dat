40|$|A novel {{approach}} is presented for the isogeometric Boundary Element analysis of domains that contain predefine dinclusions with material properties {{that are different}} {{to the rest of}} the domain and which also may exhibit inelastic behavior. The paper is complementary to a paper published recently in this journal, which focused on plane problems. The theoretical framework and implementation are extended to three-dimensional problems here. In our approach the geometry of inclusions is described using NURBS surfaces. The advantage over currently used methods is that no discretization into cells is required, in order to evaluate the arising volume integrals. The implementation is verifie <b>do</b> <b>ntest</b> cases by comparison with either exact solutions or ones computed by the Finite Element method...|$|R

The second {{iteration}} of {{the theory}} built on the analysis of collective action, and showed how this {{was linked to the}} mechanisms through which people make their activities meaningful and build commitments to them. Here, investments of social structural and social cognitive resources are expressed as emergent contributions to social action through a set of generative mechanisms: coherence (what <b>people</b> <b>do</b> to make sense of objects, agency, and contexts); cognitive participation (what <b>people</b> <b>do</b> to initiate and be enrolled into delivering an ensemble of practices); collective action (what <b>people</b> <b>do</b> to enact those practices); and reflexive monitoring (what <b>people</b> <b>do</b> to appraise the consequences of their contributions). These constructs are the core {{of the theory}}, and provide the foundation of its analytic purchase on practice.|$|R

I focused on the prices of raw materials for biofuel production in connection with legislative obligations and CO 2 emissions, including the impact of indirect land use changes (ILUC) and based on searches draw conclusions from primary studies that deal with macroeconomic modeling. This thesis confirmed the hypothesis that the current agricultural policy on biofuels does not comply with the theory of comparative advantage of growing food where it is advatageous both economically and environmentally...|$|R
