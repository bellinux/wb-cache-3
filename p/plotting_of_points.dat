40|$|This {{introduction}} {{to the concept of}} biological complexity demystifies and debunks the argument of Paley that a complex watch is compelling evidence requiring a (complex) watchmaker (designer or creator). It employs a mathematical exercise to demonstrate this, involving a randomizing component (a die), and a simple mathematical rule (the non-random component), resulting in the repeated <b>plotting</b> <b>of</b> <b>points.</b> Repeated cycles eventually produce an orderly pattern. Students will learn that simple rules, acting on random events can easily produce complex, seemingly designed patterns. Educational levels: High school, Middle school...|$|E

That is, it's a <b>plot</b> <b>of</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> the form (Φ−1(pk), x(k)), where plotting points pk are equal to pk=(k−α)/(n+1−2α) and α is an adjustment constant, which can be anything between 0 and1.

50|$|Dot {{plot may}} also refer to <b>plots</b> <b>of</b> <b>points</b> that each belong {{to one of}} several categories.

Compared to (vertical) bar charts and pie charts, Cleveland argues that dot plots allow more accurate interpretation of the graph by readers by making the labels easier to read, reducing non-data ink (or graph clutter) and supporting table look-up.|$|R
