Together these military reforms enabled Hong Taiji to resoundingly defeat Ming forces in a series of battles from 1640 to 1642 for the territories of Songshan and Jinzhou. This final victory resulted in the surrender of many of the Ming dynasty's most battle-hardened troops, the death of Yuan Chonghuan {{at the hands of the}} Chongzhen Emperor (who thought Yuan had betrayed him), and the complete and <b>permanent</b> <b>withdrawal</b> of the remaining Ming forces north of the Great Wall.|$|E

25|$|Natalie Mendoza, who was {{originally}} cast as Arachne, suffered a concussion {{during the first}} preview performance on November 28, 2010, when she was struck {{in the head by}} equipment in the wings. She did not report the accident to producers until November 30.

25|$|The {{result was}} the Antiquities Act of 1906, a towering piece of American {{legislation}} by any standards. As {{a result of the}} Antiquities Act, it was now no longer necessary for Congress to authorize <b>permanent</b> <b>withdrawal</b> of land for the purpose of preservation of cultural or other resources; a presidential proclamation would now suffice. This apparent short-circuiting of separation of powers was controversial at the time, and has remained so for the 100 years since its passage, but Lacey's experienced hand guided the bill through Congress, meeting the objections of its critics and propelling it toward passage and presidential signature. President Theodore Roosevelt signed the Antiquities Act into law on June 8, 1906, and Hewett's place {{in the history of the}} conservation movement was secured. Ironically, Roosevelt's first use of the Antiquities Act was not to protect one of the ruins that Hewett had made his life's passion, but rather to establish Devil's Tower National Monument in Wyoming, a site of more geological and scenic interest than archaeological significance. However, the Act would soon be put, repeatedly and vigorously, to its (or at least Hewett's) intended purpose.|$|E

25|$|Post–Second World War {{economic}} and political decline, as well as changing attitudes in British society and government, were reflected by the armed forces' contracting global role, and later epitomised by its political defeat during the Suez Crisis (1956). Reflecting Britain's new {{role in the world}} and the escalation of the Cold War (1947–1991), the country became a founding member of the NATO military alliance in 1949. Defence Reviews, such as those in 1957 and 1966, announced significant reductions in conventional forces, the pursuement of a doctrine based on nuclear deterrence, and a <b>permanent</b> military <b>withdrawal</b> East of Suez. By the mid-1970s, the armed forces had reconfigured to focus on the responsibilities allocated to them by NATO. The British Army of the Rhine and RAF Germany consequently represented the largest and most important overseas commitments that the armed forces had during this period, while the Royal Navy developed an anti-submarine warfare specialisation, with a particular focus on countering Soviet submarines in the Eastern Atlantic and North Sea.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThrough {{an unusual}} {{differentiation}} process, human trophoblast progenitors (cytotrophoblasts) {{give rise to}} tumor-like cells that invade the uterus. By an unknown mechanism, invasive cytotrophoblasts exhibit <b>permanent</b> cell cycle <b>withdrawal.</b> Here, we report molecular cytogenetic data showing that ∼ 20 to 60 % of these interphase cells had acquired aneusomies involving chromosomes X, Y, or 16. The incidence positively correlated with gestational age and differentiation to an invasive phenotype. Scoring 12 chromosomes in flow-sorted cytotrophoblasts showed that more than 95 % of the cells were hyperdiploid. Thus, aneuploidy {{appears to be an}} important component of normal placentation, perhaps limiting the proliferative and invasive potential of cytotrophoblasts within the uterus...|$|R

My own opinion has been the same from the first, and I conceive that the time for action has now come. All my correspondents are in unison.” Every post-bag was heavy with admonitions, of greater cogency than such epistles sometimes possess; and a voluminous bundle of letters still at Hawarden bears witness to the emotions of the time. Sir William Harcourt and I, who had taken part in the proceedings at Sheffield, made our reports.

40|$|The most {{effective}} therapy of human prolactinomas {{is represented by}} dopamine D- 2 receptor agonists; there is, however, a population of nonresponder patients who require surgical intervention. In the present study, we report that prolactinomas totally resistant to pharmacological therapy have a high potential of both growing in soft agar and forming tumors in nude mice and lack D- 2 receptors for dopamine. These tumors express the receptors for nerve growth factor (NGF) and are sensitive to its differentiating activity. After exposure to NGF for 4 days, prolactinoma cells decreased their proliferation rate, lost their capability to form colonies in soft agar, lost their tumorigenic activity in nude mice, and reexpressed the lactotroph-specific D- 2 receptor protein inhibiting prolactin release. These effects were <b>permanent</b> after NGF <b>withdrawal</b> and were reproducible in vivo in nude mice transplanted with the tumors. NGF in fact remarkably and lastingly depressed tumor growth and induced expression of D- 2 receptors when injected intravenously once a day for 5 days into prolactinoma-bearing nude mice. These data suggest that NGF may induce a long-lasting switch of gene expression in human prolactinomas, modifying their transforming phenotype and reverting them to more differentiated, less malignant, dopamine-sensitive lactotroph-like cells. The possibility thus arises that short-term treatment with NGF may restore the refractory patients to conventional pharmacological therapy with D- 2 agonists...|$|R
6000|$|My {{own sense}} of the great matter, meanwhile--that is of our possibilities, still more than of our actualities, of Italy {{in general and of}} Florence in particular--was a {{perfectly}} recoverable little awareness, as I find, of certain mild soft irregular breathings thence on the part of an absent pair in whom our parents were closely interested and whose communications, whose Roman, Sorrentine, Florentine letters, letters in especial from the Baths of Lucca, kept open, in our air, more than any other sweet irritation, that [...] "question of Europe" [...] which was to have after all, in the immediate years, so limited, so shortened, a solution. Mary Temple the elder had, early in our Fourteenth Street period, married Edmund Tweedy, a haunter of that neighbourhood and of our house in it from the first, but never more than during a winter spent with us there by that quasi-relative, who, by an extension of interest and admiration--she was in those years quite exceedingly handsome--ranked for us with the Albany aunts, adding so a twist, as it were, to our tie with the Temple cousins, her own close kin. This couple must have been, putting real relatives aside, my parents' best friends in Europe, twitching thereby hardest the fine firm thread attached at one end to our general desire and at the other to their supposed felicity. The real relatives, those planted out in the same countries, are a chapter by themselves, whose effect on us, whose place in our vision, I should like to trace: that of the Kings, for instance, of my mother's kin, that of the Masons, of my father's--the Kings who cultivated, for years, the highest instructional, social and moral possibilities at Geneva, the Masons, above all, less strenuous but more sympathetic, who reported themselves to us hauntingly, during a considerable period, as enjoying every conceivable agrément at Tours and at the then undeveloped Trouville, even the winter Trouville, on the lowest possible terms. Fain would I, as for the [...] "mere pleasure" [...] of it, under the temptation to delineate, gather into my loose net the singularly sharp and rounded image of our cousin Charlotte of the former name, who figured for us, on the field of Europe, wherever we looked, {{and all the rest of}} time, as a character of characters and a marvel of placid consistency; through my vague remembrance of her return from China after the arrest of a commercial career there by her husband's death in the Red Sea--which somehow sounded like a dreadful form of death, and my scarce less faint recovery of some Christmas treat of our childhood under her roof in Gramercy Park, amid dim chinoiseries and, in that twilight of time, dimmer offspring, Vernon, Anne, Arthur, marked to us always, in the distincter years, as of all our young relatives the most intensely educated and most pointedly proper--an occasion followed by her <b>permanent</b> and invidious <b>withdrawal</b> from her own country. I would keep her in my eye through the Genevese age and on to the crisis of the Civil War, in which Vernon, unforgiven by her stiff conservatism for his Northern loyalty, laid down before Petersburg a young life of understanding and pain, uncommemorated as to the gallantry of its end--he had insistently returned to the front, after a recovery from first wounds, as under his mother's malediction--on the stone beneath which he lies in the old burial ground at Newport, the cradle of his father's family. I should further pursue my subject through other periods and places, other constantly [...] "quiet" [...] but vivid exhibitions, to the very end of the story--which for myself was the impression, first, of a little lonely, soft-voiced, gentle, relentless lady, in a dull Surrey garden of a summer afternoon, more than half blind and all dependent on the dame de compagnie who read aloud to her that Saturday Review which had ever been the prop and mirror of her opinions and to which she remained faithful, her children estranged and outworn, dead and ignored; and the vision, second and for a climax, of an old-world rez-de-chaussée at Versailles, goal of my final pilgrimage, almost in presence of the end (end of her very personal career, I mean, but not of her perfectly firm spirit or of her charmingly smooth address).|$|R
