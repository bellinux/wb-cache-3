40|$|This {{paper will}} {{introduce}} {{a theory of}} emergent animal social complexity using various results from computational models and empirical results. These results will be organized into a vertical model of social complexity. This will support the perspective that social complexity is in essence an emergent phenomenon while helping to answer two interrelated questions. The first of these involves how behavior is integrated at units of analysis larger than the individual organism. The second involves <b>placing</b> <b>aggregate</b> social events into the context of processes occurring within individual organisms over time (e. g. genomic and physiological processes). By using a complex systems perspective, five principles of social complexity can be identified. These principles suggest that lower-level mechanisms give rise to high-level mechanisms, ultimately resulting in metastable networks of social relations. These network structures then constrain lower-level phenomena ranging from transient, collective social groups to physiological regulatory mechanisms within individual organisms. In conclusion, the broader implications and drawbacks of applying the theory to a diversity of natural populations will be discussed. Comment: 22 pages, 4 figures. Working pape...|$|E

She arrived in the Puget Sound Navy Yard in Seattle on 16 August, where she remained until 2 February 1921, when she was decommissioned. During this period of inactivity, she was renamed Missoula on 7 June 1920 so her original name could be used for one of the planned South Dakota-class battleships, and she reclassified with the hull number CA-13. Though decommissioned in 1921, the ship remained in the Navy's inventory until 15 July 1930, when she was formally stricken from the naval register, according to the terms of the London Naval Treaty, which <b>placed</b> <b>aggregate</b> tonnage limits on the cruiser fleets of the signatory countries.

This huge multimillion dollar facility boasts: on site pipe and rebar fabrication, concrete batch plants, large module construction halls, and many other permanent facilities. Noticeably, one of the critical facilities seemingly missing is a functional and reusable dry dock.

The most frequent underlying medical conditions were chronic lung (37 %) and cardio-vascular diseases (15 %).

40|$|Loess {{grain size}} data used to infer {{transport}} direction or wind strength are generally derived from vigorously disaggregated samples. However, these data may not adequately represent the effective {{particle size distribution}} during loess transport, if the transported dust contained aggregates of fine-grained material. Thin sections of minimally altered C and BC horizons in the late Pleistocene Peoria Loess of Nebraska, USA, indicate the presence of aggregates with diameters of 30 – 1000 Am. The larger aggregates (3 ̆e 250 μm) are unlikely to have been transported, and are interpreted {{as the result of}} soil faunal activity and other pedogenic processes after deposition. Aggregates smaller than 250 Am could have a similar origin, but laser diffraction particle size analysis suggests that many are sedimentary particles. Comparison of minimally and fully dispersed particle size distributions from each sampling site was used to estimate the modal diameter of aggregates. The aggregate modal diameter becomes finer with decreasing loess thickness, representing increasing distance from the source. A similar trend was observed in the modal diameter of fully dispersed particle size distributions, which represents the mode of sand and silt transported as individual grains. We interpret both trends as the result of sorting during transport, supporting the interpretation that many of the aggregates were transported rather than formed in <b>place.</b> <b>Aggregate</b> content appears to increase with distance from the source, explaining a much more rapid downwind increase in clay content than would be expected if clay were transported as particles smaller than 2 Am diameter. Although the Peoria Loess of Nebraska contains sedimentary aggregates, many of the coarse silt and sand grains in this loess were transported as primary particles, were thoroughly exposed to sunlight and are potentially well suited for luminescence dating...|$|R

This paper proposes a two-stage casting process to produce a lightweight concrete. This process involves <b>placing</b> lightweight <b>aggregates</b> in a frame and then filling in the remaining interstitial voids with cementitious grout. The casting process results in the lowest density of lightweight concrete, which consequently has low compressive strength. The irregularly shaped aggregates compensate for the weak point {{in terms of strength}} while the round-shape aggregates provide a strength of 20 MPa. Therefore, the proposed casting process can be applied for manufacturing non-structural elements and structural composites requiring a very low density and a strength of at most 20 MPa...|$|R

30|$|In this paper, an {{energy-efficient}} LEACH Protocol {{is presented}} to improve the lifetime of the sensor network.

Data ensemble can save considerable energy while the source nodes forming one cluster are deployed in a relatively small area when the sink node is far away from the source nodes. An election weight is determined by taking account of the concentration degree of SNs and their residual energy for optimal CH election. The EE-LEACH Protocol results in a better packet delivery ratio, lesser energy consumption and lesser E 2 E delay than the EBRP and LEACH Protocols. The experimental results shows that the proposed EE-LEACH yields better outcomes than the existing EBRP and LEACH Protocols.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the design issue of sensor networks by placing a few powerful aggregate nodes into a dense sensor network such that the network lifetime is significantly prolonged when performing data gathering. Specifically, the problem is to <b>place</b> K <b>aggregate</b> nodes into a dense sensor network of n sensor nodes with K << n such that the lifetime of the resulting network is maximized, subject to the constraints that both the maximum transmission range of an aggregate node and the maximum transmission delay between an aggregate node and a sensor node covered by the aggregate node are met. Clearly, this is a joint optimization problem of aggregate node placement and the communication structure, which is NP-hard. We approach the problem by devising a fast and scalable heuristic algorithm. We also conduct experiments by simulation to evaluate its performance, and the experimental {{results show that the}} proposed algorithm outperforms a commonly equal distance placement schema significantly.
