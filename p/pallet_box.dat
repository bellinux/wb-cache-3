40|$|The {{wind system}} sets the {{operational}} {{conditions for the}} organ pipes. The pipe foot pressure is by nature very unsteady and {{is a result of}} the wind system response to the activities of the organ player. Changing flows create propagating pressure waves. These are spread in the wind system, interact with each other and are reflected at the system boundaries. This investigation is in many aspects related to the newly reconstructed baroque organ in Örgryte Nya Kyrka, Göteborg, Sweden. The dynamic behaviour of the wind system was studied by means of measurements and numerical simulations. The full scale laboratory test rig was used to illustrate component characteristics as well as system performance. Among the many results achieved, the very strong influence of the wind trunk length on the <b>pallet</b> <b>box</b> pressure is to be pointed out. Unlike <b>pallet</b> <b>box</b> pressures, transient pressures in the tone channel can easily be affected by the organ player by means of sensitive fingering at key attack and release. Computer simulations as well as test rig measurements confirm this behaviour and illustrate the impacts of several design parameters. By means of section valves, different wind system layouts were created and tested in Örgryte. The flexible system in Örgryte offers a certain amount of freedom to tune the wind system to suit the type of music played. Furthermore, the influence of the type of wind supply (blower/bellows) was studied. The new arrangement with a speed controlled blower performed very well. All tests and simulations point out the dominant role of the wind trunks on the dynamic behaviour of the wind system and the importance of the system layout. The numerical simulations proved to be most informative and principally correct. The wind system research - creating the background of this report - is done within the research programme of Göteborg Organ Art Center (GOArt) covering a much wider field of the organ art...|$|E
40|$|The {{microscopic}} cuticle {{model to}} describe moisture loss through the apple cuticle, which {{was developed in}} Veraverbeke et al. [Postharvest Biol. Technol. (2003 b) ], was applied to simulate moisture loss of different apple cultivars in realistic storage situations. The moisture loss calculated from the original microscopic cuticle model was, therefore, integrated over a whole apple with an average apple radius to obtain a macroscopic moisture loss model. The effect {{of the position of}} an apple in a <b>pallet</b> <b>box</b> during long-term storage was further simulated by introduction of specific surface boundary conditions. The predicted moisture loss with this macroscopic model for 6 months of storage at RH 97. 5 % was 4. 1 % for 'Elstar' and 3. 5 % for 'Jonagold' fruit, which agreed well with data obtained from practice. In addition. three practical case studies were simulated to describe the effect of different surface structures, relative humidity and, blocked lenticels on moisture loss of fruit in long-term storage.

40|$|This report {{analyzes}} {{disposable packaging}} and returnable packaging with the methods life cycle analysis and life cycle costs analysis. These two different packaging are analyzed through the company Clas Ohlson’s packaging-flow. To {{get a picture}} of how the flow works, a visit at the company and email contact have been done with Clas Ohlson to get relevant information Today Clas Ohlson has a big flow of articles to the stores without larger variations in the demand, with the exception of autumn, which is when customers start shopping for Christmas. Clas Ohlson’s articles are placed on a pallet and are wrapped into plastic-film for protection {{and to make sure that}} nothing will be stolen. In this report Plastic-film is compared to the company Nycopac AB’s product Nyco Sleeve. In Sweden Posten takes care of Clas Ohlson’s transports and is the company’s third party-logistics provider. Nyco Sleeve is a type of <b>pallet</b> <b>box,</b> which is placed on a pallet with the possibility to place three units upon each other. The <b>pallet</b> <b>box</b> is possible to fold, which makes it doable to place pallet boxes upon each other in reverse transportation. Our Life cycle costs analysis shows that Nyco Sleeve is profitable compared to continue using plastic-film as secondary packaging. Nyco Sleeve demands a larger investment, almost seven times larger than the price for plastic-film but the expenses will be recovered relatively fast because of decreasing transportation costs. Posten’s pricing depends on each pallet place that is used which means that Nyco Sleeve’s higher weight does not affect the price. The total costs decreases because Nyco Sleeve increases the fill ratio on each pallet place, which results that less pallet places need to be used in the transport. If Nyco Sleeve is used the total pallet places decrease from about 116 000 to about 93 000 pallets considering 2012 s flow. Due to decreasing costs each year, the pay-off-method shows that the investment reaches break even in about 0. 7 years The life cycle analysis that examines the environmental impact of the packaging shows the same trend as the life cycle cost analysis, it is the transport that has the decisive influence on the environment. Important to note is that the transportations from Clas Ohlson’s warehouse to stores and the reverse transports stand for the largest carbon dioxide emissions and not the transportations from production or to waste disposal. The production phase’s emission is also important especially for Nyco Sleeve, which causes large amounts of emission compared to the plastic film. Decreasing transportations and that it is possible to reuse Nyco Sleeve even out the differences between the two packaging types when it comes to emission in production. The life cycle analysis’ scenario analysis shows that Nyco Sleeve environmental impact reaches break even after about two years compared to break even for the economic costs in 0. 7 years. If only one loop is investigated the calculations show that Nyco Sleeve has larger environmental impact then plastic film but over time and when several loops are considered Nyco Sleeves carbon dioxide emission is economized.  Rapporten analyserar engångs- och returemballage genom de två analysmetoderna, livscykelkostnads- och livscykelanalys.
