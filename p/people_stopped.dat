25|$|Pica is most {{commonly}} seen in pregnant women, small children, {{and those with}} developmental disabilities such as autism. Children eating painted plaster containing lead may suffer brain damage from lead poisoning. There is a similar risk from eating soil near roads that existed before tetraethyllead in petrol was phased out (in some countries) or before <b>people</b> <b>stopped</b> using contaminated oil (containing toxic PCBs or dioxin) to settle dust. In addition to poisoning, {{there is also a}} much greater risk of gastro-intestinal obstruction or tearing in the stomach. Another risk of eating soil is the ingestion of animal feces and accompanying parasites. Pica can also be found in other animals and is commonly found in dogs.|$|E
25|$|Ulliott {{began playing}} poker {{with his parents}} {{as a young child}} and later learned three card brag at the age of 16, after being {{introduced}} to Hull's Fifty-One Club casino. By the time of his second marriage, Ulliott was organising poker games {{in the back of his}} shop and dominating the home games of others to the extent that <b>people</b> <b>stopped</b> telling him where they were being held. At the end of 1990, he met Gary Whitaker, a cafe manager from Wakefield, at Napoleon's Casino, Leeds. They travelled together to poker games six nights a week, and Whitaker placed bets for Ulliott after he was banned from all of William Hill's betting shops for successfully gambling £4,000 up to £70,000. Whitaker went on to become Ulliott's regular driver as he took part in a regular game with Dave Colclough, John Shipley and Lucy Rokach, and held a 10% stake in his action.|$|E

25|$|The {{utility of}} broadly {{grouping}} the antipsychotics into first generation and atypical categories has been challenged. It {{has been argued}} that a more nuanced view, matching the properties of individual drugs to the needs of specific patients is preferable. While the atypical (second-generation) antipsychotics were marketed as offering greater efficacy in reducing psychotic symptoms while reducing side effects (and extrapyramidal symptoms in particular) than typical medications, the results showing these effects often lacked robustness, and the assumption was increasingly challenged even as atypical prescriptions were soaring. In 2005 the US government body NIMH published the results of a major independent (not funded by the pharmaceutical companies) multi-site, double-blind study (the CATIE project). This study compared several atypical antipsychotics to an older typical antipsychotic, perphenazine, among 1,493 persons with schizophrenia. The study found that only olanzapine outperformed perphenazine in discontinuation rate (the rate at which <b>people</b> <b>stopped</b> taking it due to its effects). The authors noted an apparent superior efficacy of olanzapine to the other drugs in terms of reduction in psychopathology and rate of hospitalizations, but olanzapine was associated with relatively severe metabolic effects such as a major weight gain problem (averaging 9.4lbs over 18 months) and increases in glucose, cholesterol, and triglycerides. No other atypical studied (risperidone, quetiapine, and ziprasidone) did better than the typical perphenazine on the measures used, nor did they produce fewer adverse effects than the typical antipsychotic perphenazine (a result supported by a meta-analysis by Leucht et al. published in The Lancet), although more patients discontinued perphenazine owing to extrapyramidal effects compared to the atypical agents (8% vs. 2% to 4%, P=0.002). A phase 2 part of this CATIE study roughly replicated these findings. Compliance has not been shown to be different between the two types. Overall evaluations of the CATIE and other studies have led many researchers to question the first-line prescribing of atypicals over typicals, or even to question the distinction between the two classes.|$|E

2500|$|Darien {{is one of}} the few {{municipalities}} in Connecticut that {{comply with}} the State's mandate to report the racial and ethnic makeup of <b>people</b> <b>stopped</b> by the police. [...] 82% of the <b>people</b> <b>stopped</b> are White, 12% are Black, 15% are Hispanic. [...] This is a higher proportion of Black people than live in the town, but consistent with the makeup of the population of the general area. In July 2016, a Black man accused the Darien Police of racial profiling when he was stopped on his way to work. The man uploaded footage of the encounter online which soon reached over 50,000 views, followed by a Bridgeport man's online petition for an apology and racial sensitivity training for officers. The Darien Police denied the allegation and no apology was issued. The incident prompted U.S. Representative Jim Himes to host a panel discussion at the Darien Library on race relations and institutional racism in Darien and Connecticut.|$|E

2500|$|In 1856, Semmelweis's {{assistant}} Josef Fleischer {{reported the}} successful results of hand washing activities at St. Rochus and Pest maternity {{institutions in the}} Viennese Medical Weekly (Wiener Medizinische Wochenschrift). The editor remarked sarcastically {{that it was time}} <b>people</b> <b>stopped</b> being misled about the theory of chlorine washings. Two years later, Semmelweis finally published his own account of his work in an essay entitled [...] "The Etiology of Childbed Fever". Two years later, he published a second essay, [...] "The Difference in Opinion between Myself and the English Physicians regarding Childbed Fever". In 1861, Semmelweis finally published his main work Die Ätiologie, der Begriff und die Prophylaxis des Kindbettfiebers (German for [...] "The Etiology, Concept and Prophylaxis of Childbed Fever"). In his 1861 book, Semmelweis lamented the slow adoption of his ideas: [...] "Most medical lecture halls continue to resound with lectures on epidemic childbed fever and with discourses against my theories. [...] In published medical works my teachings are either ignored or attacked. The medical faculty at Würzburg awarded a prize to a monograph written in 1859 in which my teachings were rejected".|$|E

2500|$|Despite this, on most simple test {{questions}} such as [...] "Who is the girl pulling?" [...] or [...] "What is the red box on?" [...] Genie did not react or reply to test questions at all. When she did respond she clearly had no understanding of the sentence and gave completely ungrammatical and nonsensical answers, either stating the answer in the question, attempting to fuse two separate questions into one, or attempting to state a declarative sentence as a question. She also remained entirely unable to ask an interrogative question in conversation, only ever attempting to upon specific request, and efforts during mid-1973 to help her memorize interrogative questions were completely unsuccessful. Curtiss theorized this inability was because Genie had no deixis or linguistic movement in her speech, and in 1975 the scientists speculated emotional difficulties may have made her unwilling to attempt them in spontaneous speech. Curtiss attributed Genie's failure to memorize them to being generally unable to remember sentences using grammar she had not mastered, which is typical of young children. After seeing how much trouble the tests gave Genie Curtiss ended them, and after approximately a year <b>people</b> <b>stopped</b> asking her to produce these questions.|$|E
2500|$|... "Learn the Hard Way" [...] is the album's fourth track. It is {{the third}} song on the album, and shares {{similarities}} with the song [...] "Never Say Never". The Guy Roche-produced [...] "Almost Doesn't Count" [...] is the fifth track. Brandy performed the song in the 1999 film Double Platinum, starring Diana Ross and herself. The international single [...] "Top of the World" [...] is the album's sixth track.

In the music video, directed by Paul Hunter, Brandy was featured incurring various supernatural phenomena. She spontaneously floated in the air, flipping and somersaulting above random objects; telephone poles and vehicles, as <b>people</b> <b>stopped</b> to stare. These strange phenomena also included balancing herself vertically and horizontally alongside skyscrapers and buildings. The Darkchild-produced [...] "U Don't Know Me (Like U Used To)", which is the album's seventh and final single, is noted for its remix version with Shaunta and Da Brat. The remix was released as the lead single to the same-named EP. [...] "Never Say Never", also produced by Rodney Jerkins, is the eighth song of the album. [...] "Never Say Never" [...] was released as a Germany single in 2000. [...] "Truthfully", a ballad about a broken relationship, was penned by former Boyz II Men member, singer-songwriter Marc Nelson. Recorded in a single take, it took Nelson five different sessions to get Norwood in the recording studio as she felt initially nervous about working with him. Main production on the song was helmed by Harvey Mason, Jr. who received his first major placement as a producer on [...] "Truthfully".
