25|$|Mathematical {{optimization}} {{is used in}} much modern controller design. High-level controllers such as model <b>predictive</b> <b>control</b> (MPC) or real-time optimization (RTO) employ mathematical optimization. These algorithms run {{online and}} repeatedly determine values for decision variables, such as choke openings in a process plant, by iteratively solving a mathematical optimization problem including constraints and {{a model of the}} system to be controlled.|$|E
25|$|A {{particular}} robustness {{issue is}} the requirement for a control system to perform properly {{in the presence of}} input and state constraints. In the physical world every signal is limited. It could happen that a controller will send control signals that cannot be followed by the physical system, for example, trying to rotate a valve at excessive speed. This can produce undesired behavior of the closed-loop system, or even damage or break actuators or other subsystems. Specific control techniques are available to solve the problem: model <b>predictive</b> <b>control</b> (see later), and anti-wind up systems. The latter consists of an additional control block that ensures that the control signal never exceeds a given threshold.|$|E
2500|$|Optimal {{control is}} a {{particular}} control technique in which the control signal optimizes a certain [...] "cost index": for example, {{in the case of}} a satellite, the jet thrusts needed to bring it to desired trajectory that consume the least amount of fuel. Two optimal control design methods have been widely used in industrial applications, as it has been shown they can guarantee closed-loop stability. These are Model <b>Predictive</b> <b>Control</b> (MPC) and linear-quadratic-Gaussian control (LQG). The first can more explicitly take into account constraints on the signals in the system, which is an important feature in many industrial processes. However, the [...] "optimal control" [...] structure in MPC is only a means to achieve such a result, as it does not optimize a true performance index of the closed-loop control system. Together with PID controllers, MPC systems are the most widely used control technique in process control.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a state space model <b>predictive</b> fault-tolerant <b>control</b> scheme for batch processes with unknown disturbances and partial actuator faults. To develop the model <b>predictive</b> fault-tolerant <b>control,</b> the batch process is first treated into a non-minimal representation using state space transformation. The relevant {{concepts of the}} corresponding model <b>predictive</b> fault-tolerant <b>control</b> is thus introduced through state space formulation, where improved closed-loop control performance is achieved even with unknown disturbances and actuator faults, because, unlike traditional model <b>predictive</b> fault-tolerant <b>control,</b> the proposed control method can directly regulate the process output/input changes in the design. For performance comparison, a traditional model <b>predictive</b> fault-tolerant <b>control</b> is also designed. Application to injection velocity control shows that the proposed scheme achieve the design objective well with performance improvement. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|A novel robust <b>predictive</b> {{functional}} <b>control</b> {{based on}} nonlinear disturbance observer is investigated {{in order to}} address the control system design for flight vehicles with significant uncertainties, external disturbances, and measurement noise. Firstly, the nonlinear longitudinal dynamics of the flight vehicle are transformed into linear-like state-space equations with state-dependent coefficient matrices. And then the lumped disturbances are considered in the linear structure predictive model of the <b>predictive</b> functional <b>control</b> to increase the precision of the predictive output and resolve the intractable mismatched disturbance problem. As the lumped disturbances cannot be derived or measured directly, the nonlinear disturbance observer is applied to estimate the lumped disturbances, which are then introduced to the <b>predictive</b> functional <b>control</b> to replace the unknown actual lumped disturbances. Consequently, the robust <b>predictive</b> functional <b>control</b> for the flight vehicle is proposed.

This paper aims to clarify the real reason for this phenomenon under bidirectional power flows, i. e., rectifier mode and inverter mode, and, furthermore, seeks to propose effective solutions. A detailed analysis of instantaneous current variations under different conditions was conducted. An enhanced <b>predictive</b> current <b>control</b> strategy with improved switching patterns was then proposed.

This modified control scheme is not only capable of stabilizing more periodic orbits than the original <b>predictive</b> feedback <b>control</b> but also speeds up convergence for typical chaotic maps, as illustrated in both theory and application. The proposed adaptation scheme provides a way to tune parameters online, yielding a broadly applicable, fast chaos control that converges reliably, even for periodic orbits of large period...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we explore {{learning}} based <b>predictive</b> cruise <b>control</b> {{and the impact of}} this technology on increasing fuel efficiency for commercial trucks. Traditional cruise control is wasteful when maintaining a constant velocity over rolling hills. <b>Predictive</b> cruise <b>control</b> is able to look ahead at future road conditions and solve for a cost effective course of action. Model based controllers have been implemented in this field but cannot accommodate the many complexities of a dynamic environment which includes changing road and vehicle conditions. In this work, we focus on incorporating a learner into an already successful model based predictive cruise controller in order to improve its performance. We explore back propagating neural networks to predict future errors then take actions to prevent said errors from occurring. The results show that this approach improves the model based <b>predictive</b> cruise <b>control</b> by up to 60 % under certain conditions. In addition, we explore the benefits of classifier ensembles to further improve the gains due to intelligent cruise control. ...|$|R
