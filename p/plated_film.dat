As a result, we confirmed that the tin whisker under thermal shock stress did not cause short-circuit failure in field.

It {{is generally}} said that Sn is a metal easily generating whiskers in high temperature atmosphere, and each concerned manufacturer, etc. has made research about this type whickers 1).

However, it has been lately found that, if a thermal stress shock is charged on a product with Sn plate on Ni under-plate, it generates lint-like deposition products (i. e. we call them “whiskers ”) 3). As these whiskers have lint-like sinuous shape, some of which grow to few score micrometers, there is a concern that they may cause short-circuit failure between electrodes on electronics components. Therefore, we have performed stress analyses in order to investigate, in what conditions, these whiskers generated under the thermal shock stress grow and how they affect product reliability, and estimated the reliability level of electronics components used in the market environment in respect of the whisker generation.

40|$|Previous {{work has}} {{indicated}} very close agreement between vendor-certified values on TXRF reference calibration {{standards and the}} results from an ion beam technique—heavy ion backscattering spectrometry (HIBS) —which does not require standards for accurate analysis. However, when {{any one of these}} standards are utilized to calibrate a TXRF system, serious discrepancies (up to 100 % relative) are noted {{when the rest of the}} standards are analyzed as though they were samples. Since there is very high confidence in the HIBS results, these selfinconsistencies among standards suggest that there may be something unique to the TXRF analysis which is responsible for the discrepancies. Although there may be other possibilities for the disagreement among the TXRF results, this paper focuses on the possible effects of errors in angle registration and possible errors due to the location of the contaminating element relative to the sample surface. Errors in angle registration, at least for the instruments studied, were found to be significant but nowhere near the magnitude required to fully explain the discrepancies. The results of the angle scans determined that even though all the standards were produced by the same vendor using the same process, very significant differences in the forms of the contamination could be inferred from the shapes of the angle scans.

An anodic oxidation is very common to improve corrosion resistance and micropore formation. However there is almost no investigation about anodic oxidation of plated aluminum film. The plated aluminum films were anodized to create micropore. An oxalic acid was used to anodize Al <b>plated</b> <b>film.</b> Five conditions had been investigated to create micropores by changing oxalic acid concentration, applied voltage and treated time. The best condition was 0. 1 mol/l oxalic acid concentration, 40 V applied voltage and 5 minutes treatment time. In this study, the plated Al films were not uniformly formed. The area that was not uniformly formed, micropore, wave-like structure and so on, showed heterogeneous anodic oxidation. Therefore, an uniform Al film formation is necessary for micropore formation. The plated aluminum film area which showed some roughness also showed heterogeneous anodic oxidation. However, there was some regularity of micropore arrangement.

40|$|Abstract. New {{copper plating}} bath chemisties are being {{developed}} to meet the emerging need of plating copper into sub-micron features on semiconductor wafers. These chemistries are {{designed to provide a}} fast, efficient, fill for even the most challenging wafer terrain. It has been found that maintaining the concentration of the additives in these plating baths at certain levels is critical to the performance of the bath. Plating technology for semiconductor applications requires rigid bath control and disciplined methodology. Establishing correlations between what is found in the <b>plated</b> <b>film</b> and bath chemistry control parameters is fundamental in producing interconnects that are consistent and reliable. To establish these correlations, {{it is important to have}} a clear understanding of the chemical composition of the bath. It is theorized that the "suppressor " bath components help moderate the deposition rate of the copper fill and the "leveler " additives improve the topology of the copper overfill. Too much or too little of these components in the bath can be detrimental to the quality of the copper deposition and may result in "fill failure " leading to a higher than necessary scrap rate for the wafers. Indirect bath measurements, such as Cyclic Voltammetric Stripping (CVS), tell an incomplete story as these techniques only measures the combined effect of the additives and by-products on the plating quality. High Performance Liquid (HPLC) and Ion Chromatography are analytical techniques which provide important information on the concentration, chemical balance and trend measurement of major constituents such as additives, brighteners, boosters, stabilizers, carriers, levelers, inhibitors, accelerators, transition metals, metal complexes and contaminants in the plating bath. This information provides for improved device quality, reduced scrap rate and reduced costs of bath maintenance. This, however, is not the end of the story. In addition to additives, copper plating baths also contain process byproducts. This paper will cover the development of analytical methods using metal free liquid chromatography to quantify the components and any related by-products found in copper plating baths used for small-featured semiconductors. ...|$|E
40|$|It is {{impossible}} to deposit aluminum from aqueous solution because hydrogen generation occur before aluminum deposition. A dimethyl sulfone {{is one of the}} most promising candidates for non-aqueous solvent. The plating solution was composed of aluminum chloride and dimethyl sulfone. Since a melting point of dimethyl sulfone is from 107 to 109 ℃, a plating temperature is necessary to be higher than this value. However, the aluminum plating at the plating temperature lower than 130 ℃ was not reproducible. Results of thermal desorption spectrometry(TDS) showed that a desorption peak of H 2 O was 126 ℃. The following plating was performed after dehydration at 150 ℃ and the plating temperature was 150 ℃. The uniform aluminum plating was occurred at current density more than 2. 0 A/dm 2, and the plating at current density more than 8. 0 A/dm 2, delamination was observed. Then the optimum current density is 6. 0 A/dm 2. The edge of substrate masked to improve uniformity of deposition. A ratio of dimethyl sulfone to aluminum chloride is controlled at 10 : 3, 10 : 5, 10 : 7 and 10 : 10. The deposits from the bath from the ratio of 10 : 3 and 10 : 5 showed high uniformity and good adhesion between deposits and substrates.

40|$|Electrodeposition {{of copper}} is used {{extensively}} for the fabrication of electrical interconnects in semiconductor device manufacturing and in {{printed circuit board}} production, {{as well as other}} industries. Copper is often plated from an acidic copper sulfate electrolyte with a number of inorganic and organic constituents. Electrolyte enables filling of complex surface geometries with desired internal and surface properties. Continuing miniaturization of modern microelectronics requires a highly controlled electrodeposition process and also requires interconnect materials with improved electromigration and stress migration resistances. Thus, current research deals with two avenues that have a potential to improve the process of copper electroplating and extend copper technology {{to meet the challenges of}} future device dimensions. The improvement in the plating process of copper is being sought by the integration of an iron redox couple (Fe 3 +/Fe 2 +) to copper electrolytes. Certain benefits of incorporating Fe 3 +/Fe 2 + subsystem in combination with inert anode to the electrolyte have been previously recognized, though without regards to the impact that Fe 3 +/Fe 2 + can exert on the behavior of additives. Organic additives are essential constituents of all copper plating baths. Therefore, we studied how the presence of Fe 3 +/Fe 2 + affects organics additives, with focus on two representative components: polyethylene glycol (PEG) and bis(3 -sulfopropyl) -disulfide (SPS). Electrochemical studies on a rotating disk electrode (RDE) and microfluidic device showed that the behavior of PEG during copper deposition is not affected in the presence of Fe 3 + and Fe 2 + ions. Kinetics of adsorption and desorption of PEG on copper electrode were also unaffected. In contrast, the activity of SPS increased when Fe 3 +/Fe 2 + were present in a copper-plating bath. By means of the electrochemical analysis and investigation by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), it was revealed that the Fe 3 +/Fe 2 + redox couple reacts with SPS to form 3 -mercaptopropyl sulfonate (MPS) in the bulk solution. The ratio of Fe 3 +/Fe 2 + determined the reducing power of the electrolyte by changing the concentration of MPS derived from SPS. The estimates of the standard reduction potential of SPS to MPS reduction, based on equilibrium calculation with reference to HPLC results, put the reduction potential in the range between 0. 3 - 0. 4 V vs. standard hydrogen electrode (SHE). To facilitate the study SPS/MPS equilibrium in the presence of ferrous and ferric ions, a new chromatographic method was developed for the detection of SPS, MPS, monoxide-of-SPS, and dioxide-of-SPS from a copper electrolyte. An HPLC tool was coupled with an electrochemical detector, which enabled concentration sampling in a range of just a few parts per billion (ppb). Due to its low limit of detection and effective separation of detectable compounds, this method can prove crucial for plating bath control, where very little amount of certain byproducts may significantly decrease performance of the electrolyte. As technology advances to create smaller microelectronics, copper interconnects are becoming more prone to failures by electromigration and stress migration effects. Copper can potentially be made less susceptible to these effects if alloyed with about one weight percent of another metal. Accordingly our research examined copper-silver (Cu-Ag) and copper-tin (Cu-Sn) alloys as two possible applications in interconnect technology. The main challenge for depositing silver from copper plating electrolytes, which contain about 50 ppm of chloride, is the low solubility of silver ions with chloride. Together with other additives, chloride is a crucial component promoting defect-free filling of surface features. To overcome this challenge, it was shown that the application of pulse-plating instead of direct current plating enabled the use of chloride at a substantial concentration, while also allowing a wide range of Cu-Ag alloy compositions. Theoretical estimates of alloy compositions were in agreement with experimental values at various pulse frequencies and duty cycles, electrode rotation speeds, and electrolyte concentrations. However, organic additives decreased incorporation of Ag into the alloy due to a possible complexing effect on silver ion. It was also discovered that salt of copper (CuSO 4 * 5 H 2 O) from a number of major chemical suppliers contains Ag as an impurity. Pulsating conditions were responsible for an unwanted increased in surface roughness of the <b>plated</b> <b>film</b> alloys. However, the addition of a leveling agent polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) at 10 ppm of chloride improved roughness and surface quality of the deposited Cu-Ag thin films. Electrodeposits of copper-tin alloy thin films were prepared from acidic copper sulfate electrolytes by polarizing copper deposition into the region where Sn deposition became possible. The ability to polarize copper deposition demonstrated with the use of EPE, poly(ethylene glycol) -block-poly(propylene glycol) -block-poly(ethylene glycol), and bromide in comparison to several other chemistries. Sn content between 0 - 7 at% was obtained above the reduction potential of Sn 2 +. High Sn content of up to 20 at% was achieved when Cu deposition was suppressed below the deposition potential of Sn 2 + by the combination of Br and EPE. A positive correlation between Sn content and concentration of Sn 2 + in the electrolyte was observed. Higher tin content in the alloy was also correlated with low rotation speeds...|$|E
