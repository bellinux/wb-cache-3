5|$|The Old Man of Hoy {{is a red}} {{sandstone}} stack and <b>perched</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> plinth of basalt rock. It {{is separated}} from the mainland by a 60-metre (200ft) chasm strewn with debris, and has nearly vertical sides with a top just a few metres wide. The rock is composed of layers of soft, sandy and pebbly sandstone and harder flagstones of Old Red Sandstone, giving the sides a notched and slab-like profile.|$|E
5|$|After their {{conquest of}} Pasir Panjang Ridge, the Japanese {{proceeded}} to march towards {{the city of}} Singapore for their final decisive thrust against remaining Allied forces there. <b>Perched</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> hill (near present Keppel Country Club) along Pasir Panjang Road, the escaped Malay and British soldiers had gathered together and waited patiently to ambush the Japanese convoy heading towards the city. Using mounted Bofors guns, they let loose deluge of gunshots causing the Japanese to scramble for cover. The Japanese tanks attempted to move forward to engage the enemy {{but they could not}} advance due to the sea of dead and wounded bodies blocking its way. About 100 Japanese soldiers were killed during the ambush before the Anglo-Malay force retreated to the city to join their fellow men for their final stand against the Japanese.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} {{was designed by}} Carl Frelinghuysen Gould of Bebb and Gould with assistance from John Graham & Company. The architecture has a distinctive Art Deco style. The structure is <b>perched</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> hill overlooking downtown Seattle and is a prominent piece of the city's skyline. It has been listed in the National Register of Historic Places and has been recognized as a landmark by the City of Seattle. The {{building was}} retrofitted to better withstand an earthquake in the 1990s. However, portions of the building suffered significant damage and required repair due to the 2001 Nisqually earthquake.|$|E

5|$|The same year, on the {{occasion}} of Eusebi Güell's obtaining the title of count, Gaudí designed a coat of arms for his patron. He devised a shield with the lower part in a catenary shape typical of Gaudí. He divided it into two parts: the lantern of Palau Güell features a dove and a gear-wheel on the right in allusion to the Colònia Güell in Santa Coloma de Cervelló (coloma is Catalan for dove), with the phrase ahir pastor (yesterday Shepherd). On the left is an owl <b>perched</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> half-moon—symbol of prudence and wisdom—with the words avuy senyor (today Lord). The shield is surmounted by a helmet with the count's coronet and the dove symbol of the Holy Spirit.|$|E
5|$|In November 2003, Irwin was {{filming a}} {{documentary}} on sea lions {{off the coast of}} Baja California Peninsula in Mexico when he heard via his boat's radio that two scuba divers were reported missing in the area. Irwin and his entire crew suspended operations to aid in the search. His team's divers searched with the rescue divers, and Irwin used his vessel to patrol the waters around the island where the incident occurred, as well as using his satellite communications system to call in a rescue plane. On {{the second day of the}} search, kayakers found one of the divers, Scott Jones, <b>perched</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> narrow rock ledge jutting out from the side of a cliff. Irwin and a crew member escorted him to Irwin's boat. Jones did not recognise Irwin. The other lost diver, Katie Vrooman, was found dead by a search plane later the same day not far from Jones' location.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not known}} when cacti were first cultivated. Opuntias (prickly pears) were used {{for a variety of}} {{purposes}} by the Aztecs, whose empire, lasting from the 14th to the 16th century, had a complex system of horticulture. Their capital from the 15th century was Tenochtitlan (now Mexico City); one explanation for the origin of the name is that it includes the Nahuatl word nōchtli, referring to the fruit of an opuntia. The coat of arms of Mexico shows an eagle <b>perched</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> cactus while holding a snake, an image {{at the center of the}} myth of the founding of Tenochtitlan. The Aztecs symbolically linked the ripe red fruits of an opuntia to human hearts; just as the fruit quenches thirst, so offering human hearts to the sun god ensured the sun would keep moving.|$|E

5|$|The {{territorial}} {{call of the}} Australian raven is a slow, high ah-ah-aaaah {{with the}} last note drawn out. It uses this call to communicate with other Australian ravens in the area. When giving this call, the species has a horizontal posture, holding its head forward and body parallel to the ground, while <b>perched</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> prominent position. It ruffles its hackles and lowers its tail, and sometimes holds its beak open between calls. In contrast, the little raven and forest raven hold their bodies in an upright posture. This call becomes louder if trespassers encroach upon the Australian raven's territory. The five Australian species {{are very difficult to}} tell apart, with the call being the easiest way to do so, although the drawing-out of the final note—long held to be solely recorded for the Australian raven—has been recorded for the other species and is hence not diagnostic.|$|E
5|$|With {{the bridge}} having been {{captured}} {{other elements of}} the brigade established a bridgehead for the advancing 11th Armoured and on 19 April they arrived in Lüneburg, where they began to prepare for the crossing of the Elbe. The assault began at 2:00am on 29 April with No. 6 Commando leading the way across in Buffalo landing vehicles. Under fire the entire way, they landed downstream from the objective—Lauenburg—and launched an assault against the defenders who were <b>perched</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> cliff overlooking the narrow landing beach. After reaching the top of the cliff, they broke through the defences and established themselves {{to the north of the}} town, while the rest of the brigade came up. Throughout the remainder of the day, the town was cleared and patrols sent out; a patrol from No. 6 Commando captured the Elbe–Trave Canal bridge, arriving just as the demolition party was preparing it for detonation.|$|E
5|$|The {{breeding}} season takes place over five months from August to January {{with up to}} three broods raised. The male proposes suitable nest sites to the female by rubbing his body over a suitable tree fork, all the while trilling continuously. He may indicate several sites before the female ultimately makes the decision where to build, at which point she constructs the nest alone. The nest is a neat, deep cup made of soft dry grass and bark. Spider webs, feathers and fur are used for binding or filling, and the nest is generally placed in a tree fork or even a mistletoe bush. It may be decorated with lichen and camouflaged {{to blend in with}} its surroundings. Two to three dull white eggs tinted bluish, greyish or brownish and splotched with dark grey-brown are laid on consecutive days, measuring 16mm × 13mm (0.6 × 0.5in). Females alone develop brood patches and incubate, although both sexes feed the young. The male will keep lookout either on the nest or <b>perched</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> nearby branch, rather than brood while the female is foraging, and parents will feed young and dart off quickly if there are predators in the vicinity. Extra-pair mating and fertilisation is fairly common, with 23% of nestlings and 37% of broods having a different father to the one rearing them, and {{there is some evidence that}} extra-pair couplings are more likely to produce male birds.|$|E

25|$|Formerly {{the capital}} of Angoumois in the Ancien Régime, Angoulême was a {{fortified}} town for a long time, and was highly coveted due to its position at the centre of many roads important to communication, so therefore it suffered many sieges. From its tumultuous past, the city, <b>perched</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> rocky spur, inherited a large historical, religious, and urban heritage which attracts a lot of tourists.|$|E
25|$|From the beginning, {{animosity}} {{marked the}} relationship between Isabella and her three younger brothers Cesare, Decio and Fabio, who perhaps envied their gifted sister and the attention lavished on her education.

In the castle Isabella dedicated herself to writing poems, finding in poetry the only solace for her solitude.|$|E

25|$|On {{the crest}} sits an Australian wedge-tailed eagle, <b>perched</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> {{parchment}} scroll and clasping an escallop shell. The wedge-tailed eagle (aquila audax), {{being such a}} well-known Australian bird that is found across the continent, was selected to symbolise La Trobe as an Australian university. One might also note that the wedge-tail is the largest Australian bird of prey, which may reflect the founder's early aspirations of La Trobe being a large and prominent university within Australia.|$|E
25|$|The city of Mexico-Tenochtitlan {{was founded}} by the Mexica people in 1325. The old Mexica city that is now simply {{referred}} to as Tenochtitlan was built on {{an island in the}} center of the inland lake system of the Valley of Mexico, which it shared with a smaller city-state called Tlatelolco. According to legend, the Mexicas' principal god, Huitzilopochtli, indicated the site where they were to build their home by presenting an eagle <b>perched</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> nopal cactus with a snake in its beak.|$|E

25|$|He {{had often}} visited Rothbury as a child, {{when he was}} afflicted by a severe cough, and he had fond {{memories}} of the area. In 1863 he bought some land in a steep-sided, narrow valley where the Debdon Burn flows towards the River Coquet near Rothbury. He had the land cleared and supervised {{the building of a}} house <b>perched</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> ledge of rock, overlooking the burn. He also supervised a programme of planting trees and mosses so as to cover the rocky hillside with vegetation.|$|E
25|$|Using {{his newly}} {{developed}} electromagnetic principle, Henry in 1831 created {{one of the}} first machines to use electromagnetism for motion. This was the earliest ancestor of modern DC motor. It did not make use of rotating motion, but was merely an electromagnet <b>perched</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> pole, rocking back and forth. The rocking motion was caused by one of the two leads on both ends of the magnet rocker touching one of the two battery cells, causing a polarity change, and rocking the opposite direction until the other two leads hit the other battery.|$|E
25|$|Parsons {{was also}} a painter. In 1959, Tony Smith {{designed}} her waterfront house-studio on the North Fork of {{the east end of}} Long Island, New York, <b>perched</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> cliff overlooking Long Island Sound, where Parsons worked on her art in her time off from the gallery. Her painting style changed in 1947, turning from small landscapes and portraits into a bold, subjective abstraction when she began to make constructions from bits of wood and other materials that washed up on the beach near her home; most often her constructions reflected the area around her North Fork home, but sometimes the pieces reflected her travels to the Caribbean and abroad.|$|E
