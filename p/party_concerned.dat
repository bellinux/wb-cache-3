25|$|The {{right to}} privacy is {{protected}} by Article 30 of the Basic Law and Article 14 of the Bill of Rights. At statutory level, protection is mainly offered by the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, which has quite a limited scope. It stipulates six data protection principles which must be adhered to when dealing with personal data. Non-compliance with the principles is not a criminal offence but the <b>party</b> <b>concerned</b> may be served with an enforcement notice by the Privacy Commissioner. Non-compliance with an enforcement notice is punishable by a penalty of a fine at Level 5 and imprisonment for 2 years. The statute also creates a civil cause of action: an individual who suffers damage, including injured feeling, by reason of a contravention of the Ordinance in relation {{to his or her}} personal data may seek compensation from the data user concerned.|$|E
2500|$|Standardisation {{of degrees}} into the three cycles of bachelor's–master's–doctorate across the European Higher Education Area (EHEA) is {{being carried out}} through the Bologna process, {{although}} not all EHEA member states have fully conformed to the 1999 Bologna declaration in favour of their own historic customs. With respect to the title [...] "doctor", {{it should be noted}} that the Bologna process makes no prescriptions regarding the names of degrees nor the titles they may confer. However, under the Lisbon Recognition Convention, recognition of a foreign degree allows [...] "the use of an academic title, subject to the laws and regulations of the country in which recognition is sought". According to the Explanatory report, this means that: [...] "The competent authorities of the Parties may grant the right to use the title in the exact form in which it was awarded in the <b>Party</b> <b>concerned</b> or in any other form. They may alternatively grant the right to use the corresponding title of the country in which recognition is sought." ...|$|E

60|$|In the {{beginning}} of October Mr. and Mrs. Egremont were invited to a great shooting party at Sir James Jerningham's. The invitation did not include Ursula. Perhaps she had never dawned on their hostess's imagination; perhaps it was that Lady Jerningham was well known to dislike girls, or any one who might absorb young men's attention. At any rate the omission was a cause of thankfulness to the <b>party</b> <b>concerned,</b> {{and she did not}} neglect to worry her mother by a protest against keeping such company as would be met at Waldicotes.|$|E

Your uncle is as much surprised as I am--and nothing but the belief of your being a <b>party</b> <b>concerned</b> would have allowed him to act as he has done. But if you are really innocent and ignorant, I must be more explicit.|$|E

60|$|If {{the roof}} of the theatre of San Carlo were to fall in, so many people would play upon the numbers {{attached}} to such an accident in the Diviner, that the Government would soon close those numbers, and decline to run the risk of losing any more upon them. This often happens. Not long ago, when there was a fire in the King's Palace, there was such a desperate run on fire, and king, and palace, that further stakes on the numbers attached to those words in the Golden Book were forbidden. Every accident or event, is supposed, by the ignorant populace, to be a revelation to the beholder, or <b>party</b> <b>concerned,</b> in connection with the lottery. Certain people who have a talent for dreaming fortunately, are much sought after; and there are some priests who are constantly favoured with visions of the lucky numbers.|$|E

That would be enough for us to marry upon, and we might trust to time and chance for the rest." ...|$|E
60|$|Meanwhile {{his sudden}} {{departure}} excited a considerable sensation among the party {{whom he had}} just left, and who were induced to form conclusions not very favourable to his character. Sir Bingo, in particular, blustered loudly and more loudly, {{in proportion to the}} increasing distance betwixt himself and his antagonist, declaring his resolution to be revenged on the scoundrel for his insolence--to drive him from the neighbourhood--and I know not what other menaces of formidable import. The devil, in the old stories of diàblerie, was always sure to start up at the elbow of any one who nursed diabolical purposes, and only wanted a little backing from the foul fiend to carry his imaginations into action. The noble Captain MacTurk had so far this property of his infernal majesty, that the least hint of an approaching quarrel drew him always to the vicinity of the <b>party</b> <b>concerned.</b> He was now at Sir Bingo's side, and was taking his own view of the matter, in his character of peace-maker.|$|E

60|$|January 30.--False delicacy. Mr. Gibson, Mr. Cowan, Mr. J.B., {{were with}} {{me last night}} to talk over {{important}} matters, and suggest an individual for a certain highly confidential situation. I was led to mention a person of whom I knew nothing {{but that he was}} an honest and intelligent man. All seemed to acquiesce, and agreed to move the thing to the <b>party</b> <b>concerned</b> this morning, and so Mr. G. and Mr. C. left me, when J.B. let out that it was their unanimous opinion that we should be in great trouble were the individual appointed, from faults of temper, etc., which would make it difficult to get on with him. With a hearty curse I hurried J.B. {{to let them know that}} I had no partiality for the man whatever, and only named him because he had been proposed for a similar situation elsewhere. This is provoking enough, that they would let me embarrass my affairs with a bad man (an unfit one, I mean) rather than contradict me. I dare say great men are often used so.|$|E
60|$|Your Lordships will observe {{something}} here worthy of your notice. You will first perceive, {{that the very}} treaty in which Mr. Hastings, by his representative, Mr. Middleton, was a <b>party</b> <b>concerned,</b> supposes that the Nabob Sujah ul Dowlah had other children besides the reigning prince by his sole legitimate wife; and yet Mr. Hastings, in his defence, has thought proper, with a full knowledge of that circumstance, to doubt whether there were any other children. You next see that these women have Mr. Middleton's (that is, Mr. Hastings's) guaranty for the allowances which are made and settled upon them, and {{for the maintenance of}} their attendants, for the security and enjoyment of their own possessions, for their having a law officer of high rank, a moulavy, of their own. In short, there is a regular establishment formed for all these women: they are not separated as a part distinct from the Begums, but they are put by this very guaranty entirely under their management; the maintenance of the children is secured; the whole order and economy of their establishment is delivered entirely to the Begum, the grandmother, and the Begum, the mother, of the Nabob.|$|E

"I {{called at}} your worthy father's mansion, {{to have a}} fuller {{explanation}} with you than I can give here, the morning after this to-all-parties-most-distressing occurrence happened: and was then informed of your serious illness, for which pray accept my best condolences. The next thing I thought of doing was to write to your respected father, requesting a private interview. But on maturer consideration, I thought it perhaps slightly injudicious to take such a step, while you, as the principal <b>party</b> <b>concerned,</b> were ill in bed, and not able {{to come forward and}} back me. I was anxious, you will observe, to act for your interests, as well as the interests of my darling girl--of course, knowing {{at the same time that}} I had the marriage certificate in my possession, if needed as a proof, and supposing I was driven to extremities and obliged to take my own course in the matter. But, as I said before, I have a fatherly and friendly confidence in your feeling as convinced of the spotless innocence of my child as I do. So will write no more on this head.|$|E
