40|$|Antibodies to {{herpes simplex}} virus type 1 (HSV- 1) and HSV- 2 of the {{immunoglobulin}} G (IgG) and IgA isotypes were detected in the cervicovaginal secretions (CVS) of 77 HSV- 1 - and HSV- 2 -seropositive but clinically asymptomatic African women by type-specific enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting (ECL-WB). Of the 77 subjects, 34 were HIV negative, shedding HSV- 2 DNA in their genital secretions; 20 were HIV <b>positive,</b> <b>shedding</b> HSV- 2 DNA; and 23 were HIV negative, not shedding HSV- 2 DNA. HSV-specific IgG was detected in CVS of nearly 70 % of the women studied. HSV-specific IgA was found in CVS of 50 % of the women studied. The distribution of CVS HSV-specific antibodies to each HSV type was highly heterogeneous, with a slight predominance of detectable IgG to HSV- 1 (59 %) over IgG to HSV- 2 (41 %), whereas the frequency of detectable IgA to HSV- 1 (39 %) {{was similar to that}} of IgA to HSV- 2 (36 %). The presence of detectable HSV-specific antibodies was inversely associated with HSV- 2 DNA genital asymptomatic shedding but was not affected by HIV seropositivity. In addition, 13 of 77 (17 %) CVS samples showed neutralizing activity against HSV- 2, as assessed by an HSV- 2 in vitro infectivity reduction assay. Neutralizing activity in CVS was associated with the presence of IgG and/or IgA antibodies to HSV- 1 and/or to HSV- 2 by ECL-WB. Among women whose CVS showed HSV- 2 -neutralizing activity, the specific activity of HSV-specific neutralizing antibodies was substantially (fivefold) higher in HSV- 2 DNA shedders than in nonshedders. In conclusion, HSV-specific antibodies are frequently detected in CVS of asymptomatic African women seropositive for HSV- 1 and HSV- 2. A subset of these women had functional neutralizing activity against HSV- 2 in their CVS. The origin of these antibodies and their role in HSV- 2 disease of the female genital tract remain to be determined...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT This study {{involved}} the microscopic {{examination of the}} bovine rectoanal junction (RAJ) collected from a total of 62 slaughter cattle at an abattoir in South East Queensland, Australia. These tissues were examined via an immunohistochemical technique, initially developed {{as part of this}} study, for visual confirmation and evaluation of E. coli O 157 colonisation and specific histopathological criteria were also evaluated to determine if microscopic changes were present within the RAJ mucosa as a result of E. coli O 157 colonisation. Microbial culture results (performed by Dr. Narelle Fegan, Food Science Australia, Cannon Hill) were also obtained from these and other animals with culture results then compared with those obtained via microscopy. In the first instance, this was performed as a double-blinded study whereby bacterial culture and microscopic examination were performed independently without knowledge of the results obtained by other detection methods. Attaching and effacing (A/E) lesions were not observed along the RAJ mucosa of any of the cattle sampled, regardless of colonisation status and level of faecal E. coli O 157 excretion. There {{was no significant difference in}} the numbers of lymphocytes, neutrophils, plasma cells or eosinophils within the RAJ mucosa between colonised and non colonised cattle indicating that E. coli O 157 colonisation of the bovine RAJ does not induce a host inflammatory response. Random sampling of a group of cattle presenting for slaughter revealed an overall prevalence of E. coli O 157 culture positive animals of 10 %. In this group of cattle, and in another group of cattle with a known <b>positive</b> <b>shedding</b> status, a single high shedding animal was present with this animal being responsible for over 99 % of the E. coli O 157 shedding within each group. The presence of one of these animals was associated with a prevalence of 30 % culture-positive cattle within the batch of animals sampled on that particular visit. The immunohistochemical technique developed and utilised in this study was highly specific for E. coli O 157 with no cross-reaction with either of E. coli O 26 :H 11 (EC 473), E. coli O 111 :H- (EC 26) and E. coli O 91 :H 21 (EC 21) serotypes. Utilising an E. coli O 157 -spiked agar gel, it was estimated that this technique allowed for the visual detection of E. coli O 157 bacteria at a minimum concentration of approximately 3. 85 x 103 bacteria/ml. Mucosal-associated bacterial colonies were only observed in one animal, with this animal also shedding the largest faecal concentration of E. coli O 157 (4. 6 x 105 CFU/g faeces) of all cattle within the study. Colonisation of this animal was multifocal rather than diffuse, a total of only 14 bacterial colonies were observed and no colonies were observed in regions immediately overlying mucosal-associated lymphoid follicles. All bacterial colonies were adherent to enterocytes in regions heavily concentrated with submucosal lymphoid follicles, and the number of bacteria per colony varied between 1 and 40...|$|E

Two separate trials {{with the same kind}} of experimental design, one with commercial turkeys and one with spf-chickens, were performed. In each experiment two differently housed groups were included. The first group contained 4 control birds whereas the second group consisted of 10 infected and 4 in-contact birds. The birds were infected via the cloaca at 14 days of life with 380. 000 cells of a mono-eukaryotic culture of Histomonas meleagridis consisting of a cloned isolate (Turkey/Austria/ 2922 / 04). The infected birds started to excrete live parasites as soon as two days post infection. Rapid spread of the parasite to in-contact turkeys and chickens was noticed.

" The way in which these agents are transmitted is largely unknown. Thus, this study aimed to investigate fleas, ticks, and rodents as well as saliva and feces from infected cats for the presence of hemotropic mycoplasmas, to gain insight into potential transmission routes for these agents. DNA was extracted from arthropods and from rodent blood or tissue samples from Switzerland and from salivary and fecal swabs from two experimentally infected and six naturally infected cats. All samples were analyzed with real-time PCR, and some positive samples were confirmed by sequencing. Feline hemotropic mycoplasmas were detected in cat fleas and in a few Ixodes sp. and Rhipicephalus sp. ticks collected from animals but not in ticks collected from vegetation or from rodent samples, although the latter were frequently Mycoplasma coccoides PCR <b>positive.</b> When <b>shedding</b> patterns of feline hemotropic mycoplasmas were investigated, "Ca.

Our results suggest that besides an ostensibly indirect transmission by fleas, direct transmission through saliva and feces at the early phase of infection could {{play a role in the}} epizootiology of feline hemotropic mycoplasmas.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate shedding after an outbreak of Q fever abortion in goat herds and to assess the relationship with the occurrence of abortions and antibody responses. Aborting and nonaborting goats were monitored by PCR for C. burnetii shedding 15 and 30 days after the abortion episodes. PCR analysis of all samples showed that 70 % (n = 50) of the aborting and 53 % (n = 70) of the nonaborting goats were positive. C. burnetii was shed into vaginal mucus, feces, and milk of 44 %, 21 %, and 38 %, respectively, of goats that aborted and 27 %, 20 %, and 31 %, respectively, of goats that delivered normally. Statistical comparison of these shedding results did not reveal any difference between these two groups. PCR results obtained for the vaginal and fecal routes were concordant in 81 % of cases, whereas those for milk correlated with only 49 % of cases with either vaginal or fecal shedding status. Serological analysis, using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA), and complement fixation tests, showed that at least 24 % of the seronegative goats <b>shed</b> bacteria. <b>Positive</b> vaginal and fecal <b>shedding,</b> unlike <b>positive</b> milk <b>shedding,</b> was observed more often in animals that were weakly positive or negative by ELISA or IFA.

40|$|This paper aims {{to explain}} {{public support for}} {{democracy}} in six East Asian societies using the 2006 AsiaBarometer data. The project investigates whether East Asians' support for democracy is primarily based on perceived political performance, such as satisfaction with human rights, or perceived economic performance. The work also examines whether East Asians' support for democracy is constrained by traditional values or the postmodern value of post-materialism. The analysis shows that for three democracies, satisfaction with human rights, i. e. perceived political performance and an intrinsic value embodied in democracy, counts more in shaping public support for democracy than perceived economic performance. Because support based on perceived economic performance is more volatile than support based on firm commitment to human rights, this finding <b>sheds</b> <b>positive</b> light on the prospects for democratic stability for the three East Asian democracies. For three East Asian autocratic societies, democratic support is based more on perceived economic rather than political performance, casting a pall on the future prospects for democratization of them.

40|$|The D-term is, like {{mass and}} spin, a {{fundamental}} property {{related to the}} energy-momentum tensor. Yet {{it is not known}} experimentally for any particle. In all theoretical studies so far the D-terms of various particles were found negative. Early works gave rise to the assumption the negative sign could be related to stability. The emerging question is whether it is possible to find a field-theoretical system with a <b>positive</b> D-term. To <b>shed</b> some light on this question we investigate Q-clouds, an extreme parametric limit in the Q-ball system. Q-clouds are classically unstable solutions which delocalize, spread out over all space forming an infinitely dilute gas of free quanta, and are even energetically unstable against tunneling to plane waves. In short, these extremely unstable field configurations provide an ideal candidate system for our purposes. By studying the energy-momentum tensor we show that at any stage of the Q-cloud limit one deals with perfectly well-defined and, when viewed in appropriately scaled coordinates, non-dissipating non-topological solitonic solutions. We investigate in detail their properties, and find new physical interpretations by observing that Q-clouds resemble BPS Skyrmions in certain aspects, and correspond to universal non-perturbative solutions in (complex) |Φ|^ 4 theory. In particular, we show that also Q-cloud solutions have negative D-terms. Our findings do not prove that D-terms must always be negative. But they indicate that it is unlikely to realize a positive D-term in a consistent physical system. Comment: 23 pages, 7 figures, revised versio...|$|R

During a project reviewing Nordic research literature on architecturalcompetitions, a series of interviews was conducted with building clients as well as architects, focusing on the impact of the above-mentioned changes within the building sector on architectural competitions as an institution. In the interviews, ICT and notleast BIM was a recurring theme that both parties saw as having a positive impact on competitions. But when looking closely into the answers, these revealed diverse understandings of how and why the impact of BIM on competitions could be said to be <b>positive.</b> The paper <b>sheds</b> light on the interaction between the actors (building clients, architects and client consultants) and the applied technologies (competition forms, ICT tools, directives) in architectural competitions in a theoretical actor-network perspective. The diverging understandings of the role of BIM are demonstrating one of many negotiations in progress in the network of architectural competitions. BIM is transformed from an inscription device visually representing the competition proposals to form an actant that challenges the very concept of architectural competition. The objective of the paper is to contribute to theunderstanding of BIM used in the kind of network that an architectural competition constitutes, and thereby give professionalactors a possibility to act {{on the basis of a}} wider understanding of interrelations mediated by BIM...|$|R
40|$|A {{national}} {{survey was conducted}} to determine the prevalence of Escherichia coli O 26, O 103, O 111, and O 145 in feces of Scottish cattle. In total, 6, 086 fecal pats from 338 farms were tested. The weighted mean percentages of farms on which shedding was detected were 23 % for E. coli O 26, 22 % for E. coli O 103, and 10 % for E. coli O 145. The weighted mean prevalences in fecal pats were 4. 6 % for E. coli O 26, 2. 7 % for E. coli O 103, and 0. 7 % for E. coli O 145. No E. coli O 111 was detected. Farms with cattle shedding E. coli serogroup O 26, O 103, or O 145 were widely dispersed across Scotland and were identified most often in summer and autumn. However, on individual farms, fecal shedding of E. coli O 26, O 103, or O 145 was frequently undetectable or the numbers of pats testing positive were small. For serogroup O 26 or O 103 there was clustering of positive pats within management groups, {{and the presence of}} an animal shedding one of these serogroups was a <b>positive</b> predictor for <b>shedding</b> by others, suggesting local transmission of infection. Carriage of vtx was rare in E. coli O 103 and O 145 isolates, but 49. 0 % of E. coli O 26 isolates possessed vtx, invariably vtx 1 alone or vtx 1 and vtx 2 together. The carriage of eae and ehxA genes was highly associated in all three serogroups. Among E. coli serogroup O 26 isolates, 28. 9 % carried vtx, eae, and ehxA—a profile consistent with E. coli O 26 strains known to cause human disease...|$|R
40|$|We {{define the}} common {{randomness}} assisted capacity of an arbitrarily varying channel (AVWC) when the Eavesdropper is kept ignorant about the common randomness. We prove a multi-letter capacity formula for this model. We prove that, if enough common randomness is used, the capacity formula {{can be given}} a single-shot form again. We then consider the opposite extremal case, where no common randomness is available. It is known that {{the capacity of the}} system can be discontinuous under these circumstances. We prove here that it is still stable {{in the sense that it}} is continuous around its positivity points. We further prove that discontinuities can only arise if the legal link is symmetrizable and characterize the points where it is <b>positive.</b> These results <b>shed</b> new light on the design principles of communication systems with embedded security features. At last we investigate the effect of super-activation of the message transmission capacity of AVWCs under the average error criterion. We give a complete characterization of those AVWCs that may be super-activated. The effect is thereby also related to the (conjectured) super-activation of the common randomness assisted capacity of AVWCs with an eavesdropper that gets to know the common randomness. Super-activation is based on the idea of "wasting" a few bits of non-secret messages in order to enable provably secret transmission of a large bulk of data, a concept that may prove to be of further importance in the design of communication systems. In this work we provide further insight into this phenomenon by providing a class of codes that is capacity-achieving and does not convey any information to the Eavesdropper.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{research}} study was to describe the general South African public’s perception {{of the image of}} nurses. The general public’s perception of nurses in South Africa and globally is seen as {{one of the main reasons}} for the current shortage of nurses, as the profession is generally portrayed extremely negatively in the open press. The picture painted reveals long working hours, poor pay and negligence resulting from poor performance and support as the essence of the nursing profession. The public is bombarded with images of nurses’ strikes and poor patient outcomes. Positive feedback is rare and seldom contributes to changing public perceptions of nurses. Studies on the public perceptions of nurses have been carried out in various countries, but published studies on the South African situation could not be found. This study aimed to determine and describe the general South African public’s perception of nurses and the results will be used to make recommendations that could improve the image of nurses and encourage more respect for the profession as a whole. A quantitative non-experimental and descriptive design was used to gain more information about the South African public’s perception of the image of nurses. A questionnaire was used to gather the data, which consist of biographical data and responses to 19 statements regarding nurses and the profession. The objectives of the study were formulated from the research question as follows: 1) to determine the general public’s perception of nurses; and 2) to formulate recommendations, based on the research results, for enhancing nurses’ public image. The population of the research comprised the 1 000 respondents to whom the questionnaires were distributed. Of these, 776 questionnaires were returned. The questionnaires were distributed in five provinces of South Africa, namely Gauteng, the Western Cape, the Free State, KwaZulu-Natal and Mpumalanga. Accordingly, the objectives of the research were achieved, as the general South African public’s perception of the image of nurses was determined and described. In addition, recommendations for improving the current image of nurses were made. The findings of this study were predominantly <b>positive</b> and <b>shed</b> some light on the reasons for the current declining numbers of new registrations at the South African Nursing Council. The respondents, however, indicated that only 43. 6 % want their children to become nurses and that nursing is still viewed as a predominantly female profession. The public viewed nurses as extremely hardworking (80. 03 %), caring and understanding (78. 2 %) and supported the statement that “nurses treat their work as a profession in its own right, not secondary to a doctor’s” (73, 8 %). In view of the findings, the recommendations included the importance of improving the image of nurses among school children and improving recruitment strategies. It is also recommended that nurses in the profession should be made aware of the important role they play in changing their image and in re-branding the profession as a knowledge-based career for all genders and age groups. Consequently, this should be emphasised in training programmes and should be the focus of future South African campaigns. Dissertation (MCur) [...] University of Pretoria, 2011.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The authors {{characterize}} {{the recovery of}} parenteral nutrition-induced changes in gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) and upper respiratory tract immunity with enteral nutrition and provide further information defining the effects of enteral feeding on mucosal immunity. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: The small intestine plays {{a prominent role in}} development and maintenance of mucosal immunity, both intestinal and extraintestinal, primarily through immunoglobulin A (IgA) -mediated mechanisms. Prior research has shown that mice fed total parenteral nutrition (TPN) have reduced GALT T and B cells, the cells responsible for IgA production, as well as impaired upper respiratory tract immunity to viral challenge of previously immunized animals. The recovery of TPN-induced changes in GALT and upper respiratory tract immunity after enteral refeeding is studied. METHODS: Male institute of Cancer Research mice received 5 days of TPN followed by 0 to 4 days of chow. Small intestinal GALT was characterized by flow cytometry. In a second experiment, animals were immunized intranasally with moused-adapted influenza virus. Three weeks later, one group received a 5 -day course of TPN followed by enteral refeeding for 5 days. A second group received TPN alone. Both groups were challenged with intranasal virus and killed 40 hours postchallenge to determine viral shedding from the upper respiratory tract. RESULTS: Animals fed TPN only had significantly fewer GALT lymphocytes compared with those chow-fed control subjects. Peyer's patch counts increased after a single day of refeeding, returning to normal levels by 48 hours. Lamina propria counts remained significantly depressed after 24 hours of refeeding, but also returned to normal after 48 hours of refeeding. The T-cell and B-cell populations mimicked total cell patterns. Lamina propria CD 4 +/CD 8 + ratio returned to normal only after 72 hours of refeeding. None of the 9 animals refed enterally for 5 days were <b>positive</b> for viral <b>shedding,</b> compared with 8 of 12 matched TPN-fed animals. CONCLUSIONS: Enteral refeeding after TPN is associated with rapid repletion of GALT cellularity, initially within Peyer's patches and subsequently within the lamina propria. Refeeding corrects the impairment of IgA-mediated upper respiratory tract antiviral immunity occurring with TPN administration. This work further enhances the authors' knowledge of the underlying immunologic differences influenced by routes of nutrition...|$|R
40|$|The use of MP 3 players has {{expanded}} rapidly {{during the last}} decade. 1 In 2010, nearly 70 percent of the young Norwegian population listened to MP 3 players daily. While the MP 3 player has always been small and easily fits into a pocket, its storage capacity keeps escalating—it is now possible to store up to forty thousand songs on an iPod, for example. Additionally, listeners now {{have the capability to}} stream music online using their smart phones via services such as Spotify or Wimp. The unprecedented availability of music offered by the MP 3 player, and the high degree to which young people use these players as a result, compels us to explore this device’s impact upon it’s users. This text is based on a research project which took a positive, resource-oriented approach to the study of MP 3 -player use (Skånland, 2012). This use has already evoked relatively negative approaches, including scholarly interest in (and concern about) the potential for hearing damage when one listens to music on headsets or earbuds; about traffic safety when pedestrians bring music into the streets; and about the consequences of this individualised music listening for social interaction. The present study took a contrasting perspective and sought to explore whether and how the use of MP 3 players might function as a medium of musical self-care, subjective wellbeing, and positive health maintenance. In the interests of examining the possible role of MP 3 players in individuals’ selfcare, the study focused on self-regulation and coping mechanisms. I carried out the research via a qualitative, empirical study using interviews with twelve adult urban users of MP 3 players that covered, in particular, their experiences with this device. In this article, I will focus on the story of the youngest informant, an eighteen-year-old young woman, and her use of her MP 3 player as a coping and self-regulating resource, in order to explore the general healthful potential of everyday music listening. I will present the young woman’s narrative in parts while introducing theories on self-regulation, coping, wellbeing, and <b>positive</b> health to <b>shed</b> light on her experiences...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Studies {{have shown}} that {{metallothionein}} 3 (MT- 3) is not expressed in normal urothelium or in the UROtsa cell line, but is expressed in urothelial cancer and in tumors generated from the UROtsa cells that have been transformed by cadmium (Cd + 2) or arsenite (As + 3). The present study had two major goals. One, to determine if epigenetic modifications control urothelial MT- 3 gene expression and if regulation is altered by malignant transformation by Cd + 2 or As + 3. Two, to determine if MT- 3 expression might translate clinically as a biomarker for malignant urothelial cells released into the urine. Results The histone deacetylase inhibitor MS- 275 induced MT- 3 mRNA expression in both parental UROtsa cells and their transformed counterparts. The demethylating agent, 5 -Aza- 2 '-deoxycytidine (5 -AZC) {{had no effect on}} MT- 3 mRNA expression. ChIP analysis showed that metal-responsive transformation factor- 1 (MTF- 1) binding to metal response elements (MRE) elements of the MT- 3 promoter was restricted in parental UROtsa cells, but MTF- 1 binding to the MREs was unrestricted in the transformed cell lines. Histone modifications at acetyl H 4, trimethyl H 3 K 4, trimethyl H 3 K 27, and trimethyl H 3 K 9 were compared between the parental and transformed cell lines in the presence and absence of MS- 275. The pattern of histone modifications suggested that the MT- 3 promoter in the Cd + 2 and As + 3 transformed cells has gained bivalent chromatin structure, having elements of being "transcriptionally repressed" and "transcription ready", when compared to parental cells. An analysis of MT- 3 staining in urinary cytologies showed that a subset of both active and non-active patients with urothelial cancer <b>shed</b> <b>positive</b> cells in their urine, but that control patients only rarely <b>shed</b> MT- 3 <b>positive</b> cells. Conclusion The MT- 3 gene is silenced in non-transformed urothelial cells by a mechanism involving histone modification of the MT- 3 promoter. In contrast, transformation of the urothelial cells with either Cd + 2 or As + 3 modified the chromatin of the MT- 3 promoter to a bivalent state of promoter readiness. Urinary cytology for MT- 3 positive cells would not improve the diagnosis of urothelial cancer, but might have potential as a biomarker for tumor progression. </p...|$|R
40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} in partial fulfilment of {{the requirements}} of the University of Wolverhampton for the degree of Doctor of PhilosophyAbstract Colorectal cancer (CRC), which includes cancer of the large bowel and rectum is the third most common cancer in men and the second in women and there is a poorer survival rate in less developed regions of the world such as West Africa mainly due to the ‘out of reach’ costs of chemotherapy. Evidence suggests that aspirin, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) has the potential to decrease incidence of, or mortality from a number of cancers including CRC through several mechanisms of action. However, this evidence is dampened by aspirin’s gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity, which {{have been found to be}} mostly age-dependent. The search for potential aspirin-related compounds with the same or better cytotoxic effects against cancer cells accompanied by a safer toxicity profile has been ongoing over the years and led to us to synthesise a number of novel aspirin analogues. One of the mechanisms of action suggested for the anticancer property of aspirin is the COX-dependent pathway. In this thesis SW 480 cell line, a CRC cell line that is COX- 2 negative and mismatch repair (MMR) proficient was used to study the possible COX-independent mechanism of action for aspirin, its analogues and diflunisal at 0. 5 mM. Diflunisal was included in this study because it is also a salicylate with reports of having cytotoxic effects. OE 33 and FLO 1 oesophageal cancer cells were also employed in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and synergy experiments to show effects were not just specific to SW 480 cells alone. These aspirin analogues were synthesised, identified using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and infra-red (IR) spectroscopy, and tested for purity using thin layer chromatography (TLC) and melting point. The findings of this study suggest that these compounds breakdown into salicylates and perturb epidermal growth factor (EGF) internalization with PN 517 (fumaryldiaspirin) and PN 590 (ortho-thioaspirin) also driving EGF co-localization with early-endosome antigen- 1 (EEA 1). The perturbation of the internalization of EGF by aspirin and PN 517 was also observed by a time-lapse assay using live confocal imaging. These compounds also had specific effects on different tyrosine phosphorylation sites of the EGFR, with none but PN 590 inhibiting 4 phosphorylation at Y 1068, and all but PN 502 (ortho-aspirin), PN 548 (meta-aspirin) and PN 549 (para-aspirin) inhibiting phosphorylation at Y 1045 and Y 1173. Given that the EGF internalization assay involved the cells being treated with compounds for 2 h, cells were also treated for this same time period and probed with pEGFR 1045, which resulted in the compounds having no significant effect on phosphorylation at that site which is responsible for the ubiquitination of the EGFR. Most of these compounds were apoptotic with some showing a combination of apoptosis and necrosis. Aspirin and its isomers drove apoptotic cell death in SW 480 cells via the BCL 2 -BAX pathway while the thioaspirins appear to follow the p 21 pathway by decreasing the expression of the protein. In addition, it was shown that PN 502 (aspirin), PN 517 and PN 590 had synergistic effects when used in combination with oxaliplatin at ED 50, ED 75 and ED 90 in SW 480 CRC cells. The cytotoxicity of these compounds individually or in combination was determined using MTT assay followed by the use of the CompuSyn and CalcuSyn software to calculate combination index (CI), which indicated whether a drug combination was synergistic, antagonistic or additive. PN 517 and PN 524 were synergistic when used in combination with cisplatin in OE 33 oesophageal cancer cells. Effect of these compounds on the EGFR indicates a delay or disruption of the signalling pathway involved in the proliferation of cancer cells, thus, translating into protection against tumour formation or progression while the synergistic effects of these compounds when used in combination with platinum compounds can provide patients with less toxic chemotherapeutic regimen especially in patients with CRC tumours that harbour mutant TP 53 gene and normally resistant to oxaliplatin. It is therefore proposed that the perturbation of EGF internalization is a novel mechanism of action for aspirin and its analogues in cancer therapy. These <b>positive</b> findings <b>shed</b> light on the understanding of the possible mechanism of action for aspirins and gives hope for a more affordable, less toxic therapy for the prevention, treatment and management of cancer...|$|R
