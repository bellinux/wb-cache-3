5|$|Although the {{investigation}} {{did not find}} any considerable evidence linking Kocharyan to the Hunanyan group, many Armenian <b>politicians</b> and analysts believe that President Robert Kocharyan and National Security Minister Serzh Sargsyan were behind the assassination of Vazgen Sargsyan and other leading <b>politicians.</b> In January 2000, investigators alleged that several members of the President Robert Kocharian's inner circle may have been behind the October 27 shooting, promoting some opposition figures to call for Kocharian's resignation. However, Kocharyan gradually consolidated his power throughout the year to emerge as the most powerful figure in the country's leadership.|$|E

5|$|Darwaza and Hafiz Kanaan—another leading al-Fatat {{member from}} Nablus—lobbied Arab groups in Jerusalem to {{advocate}} Syro-Palestinian unity {{before the arrival}} of the King-Crane Commission on 10 June 1919. They first met with Haj Amin al-Husseini and Kamil al-Husayni of al-Nadi al-Arabi party and they immediately expressed their support. They also suggested that Darwaza meet Raghib al-Nashashibi, Hussam ad-Din Jarallah, and Aref al-Dajani, supporters of independence. Darwaza convinced Nashashibi to gather some of the Older <b>Politicians</b> of Jerusalem to a meeting at his house. When it was made clear that Musa al-Husayni, a leader of the Older <b>Politicians,</b> was now in favor of unity, all of the other Older <b>Politicians</b> followed suit. When the commission arrived in Jaffa, it concluded on 27 June that it was in favor of Syro-Palestinian unity under a British Mandate.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1920s and early 1930s, the <b>politicians</b> became less {{satisfied}} with the solution. Kjeller was considered {{too far away from}} the city center (about , but along the mainline railway), while travel to Gressholmen needed to be made by ferry. The <b>politicians</b> also wanted to have a combined land- and seaplane airport, and it had become clear that serving Gressholmen was interfering with ship traffic. A committee was established to look into the matter. While considering many locations, it made detail surveys of only two places: Ekeberg, located southeast of the city center, and Fornebu, to the southwest.|$|E

5|$|Even {{before his}} {{accession}} {{to the throne}} of Belgium in 1865, the future king Leopold II began lobbying leading Belgian <b>politicians</b> to create a colonial empire in the Far East or Africa, which would expand and enhance Belgian prestige. Politically, however, colonisation was unpopular in Belgium as it was perceived as a risky and expensive gamble with no obvious benefit {{to the country and}} his many attempts to persuade <b>politicians</b> met with little success.|$|E
5|$|Fortuyn's {{political}} heritage scattered {{among various}} <b>politicians,</b> {{many of which}} were not successful. These include Marco Pastors, leader of the One NL, and Hilbrand Nawijn, leader of the Party for the Netherlands—none of which managed to win a seat in the 2006 election. More importantly however, the party had been squeezed out by the tougher line on immigration issues by mainstream <b>politicians</b> such as Minister for Integration and Immigration Rita Verdonk, who largely adopted Fortuyn's policies. By the end of the decade, former LPF supporters had mostly moved to support Geert Wilders and his Party for Freedom (PVV).|$|E
5|$|He did not tarry long there either: on December 12–13, {{he was in}} Kraków; on December 17, in Wrocław; {{and shortly}} after, he settled in Leipzig, where many notable Polish {{soldiers}} and <b>politicians</b> formed an émigré community. Soon he and some others began plotting an uprising against Russian rule in Poland. The <b>politicians,</b> grouped around Ignacy Potocki and Hugo Kołłątaj, sought contacts with similar opposition groups in Poland and by spring 1793 had been joined by other <b>politicians</b> and revolutionaries, including Ignacy Działyński. While Kołłątaj and others had begun planning an uprising before Kościuszko joined them, his support was a major boon to them, as {{he was among the}} most popular individuals in Poland.|$|E

5|$|In early 1975 Merlyn Rees set up {{elections}} for the Northern Ireland Constitutional Convention at which all of Northern Ireland's <b>politicians</b> would plan their way forward. These were held on 1 May 1975 and the United Ulster Unionist Council (UUUC), which had won 11 out of 12 Northern Irish seats in the February 1974 general election, won a majority again. As the UUUC would not abide any form of power-sharing with the Dublin government, no agreement could be reached and the convention failed, again marginalising Northern Ireland's <b>politicians</b> and the communities they represented.|$|E
