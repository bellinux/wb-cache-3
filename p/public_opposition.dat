5|$|As {{the leader}} of the Melkite church in Egypt Zoghby was a vocal proponent of rights for Christians, and opposed the {{limitations}} placed on them by that country's Law of Personal Statutes. The Nasser regime imprisoned him on December 20, 1954, for his <b>public</b> <b>opposition</b> to the statutes. Released shortly afterwards, he continued to serve as patriarchal vicar in Egypt.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, the {{majority}} Labor government made sweeping {{changes to the}} education system, shutting down 23 schools across the territory. These {{were made in the}} face of sustained <b>public</b> <b>opposition,</b> and since then, there have been campaigns from opposition parties and the community to re-open some of them. This included the 2008 election, where it was a major topic.|$|E
5|$|In 2016, Boston briefly {{shouldered}} a bid as the US applicant for the 2024 Summer Olympics. The bid {{was supported}} by the mayor and a coalition of business leaders and local philanthropists, but was eventually dropped due to <b>public</b> <b>opposition.</b> The USOC then selected Los Angeles to be the American candidate with Los Angeles ultimately securing the right to host the 2028 Summer Olympics.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, <b>public</b> <b>opposition</b> to the planned {{demolition}} {{of some of}} the historic structures downtown like the McCarthy Building led to them being placed on the then-new National Register. In the early 1970s, the five predecessor historic districts were recognized and added as well, along with some other structures.|$|E
5|$|The city {{went into}} decline {{by the early}} to mid-20th century, as {{factories}} became old and obsolete and businesses {{moved out of the}} region for cheaper labor elsewhere. Boston responded by initiating various urban renewal projects, {{under the direction of the}} Boston Redevelopment Authority (BRA) established in 1957. In 1958, BRA initiated a project to improve the historic West End neighborhood. Extensive demolition was met with strong <b>public</b> <b>opposition.</b>|$|E
5|$|Two other spurs of I-87 {{were planned}} but never constructed. In the Hudson Valley, I-487 {{would have run}} along the Hudson River from I-87 and I-287 in Tarrytown to I-84 east of Beacon. The other spur, I-687, would have {{connected}} I-90 in Albany to I-87 near Albany International Airport in Colonie. Both routes were cancelled in the 1970s {{as a result of}} <b>public</b> <b>opposition.</b>|$|E

The campaign is ongoing and the charity plans to present the names received to the British government {{as a sign of the}} British <b>public's</b> <b>opposition</b> to the war.|$|R
50|$|The <b>public's</b> <b>opposition</b> to a rate {{increase}} prevented the Local Board of Health from purchasing the water company in 1863. By 1870 the District Medical Officer urged the Local Board of Health and Sanitary Board that town's {{use of the}} company's water should be made obligatory. The Boards were concerned by any possible public backlash over the cost or assumed reduction in civil liberties that locals may have incurred due to the project.|$|R
5|$|In 1970, the {{proposed}} visit of a South African team to England was subject of widespread <b>public</b> <b>opposition.</b> The MCC {{was no longer}} solely responsible for any decisions, being {{only a part of}} the Cricket Council, but Allen pressed the government to intervene and decide whether the tour should go ahead. He believed it was a political matter outside the scope of cricket authorities; the government eventually became involved and the tour was cancelled.|$|E
5|$|Individual {{school districts}} have responded to {{complaints}} by local Native American individuals and tribes, or have made changes due to an increased awareness of the issue among educators and students. New Native mascots have not been proposed in recent decades, or are withdrawn before becoming official due to <b>public</b> <b>opposition.</b> For example, in 2016 {{when one of the}} teams in the National College Prospects Hockey League (NCPHL) was announced as the Lake Erie Warriors with a caricature Mohawk logo it was immediate changed to the Lake Erie Eagles.|$|E
5|$|Kingston Road was {{formerly}} Ontario Highway 2, {{and was the}} main highway through Scarborough until {{the building of the}} Highway 401, which runs east-west across the middle of Scarborough, with six to eight lanes in each direction. The short, minor freeway Highway 2A runs parallel to Lake Ontario {{in the eastern part of}} Scarborough. In the 1960s, Metropolitan Toronto planned to build a second east-west highway across Scarborough. It was intended to link Highway 2A with an eastern extension of the Gardiner Expressway. The highway, known as the Scarborough Expressway, was cancelled due to <b>public</b> <b>opposition.</b>|$|E

5|$|<b>Public</b> <b>opposition</b> to the German {{occupiers}} {{was heavily}} repressed. Displays of patriotism, such as singing the national anthem, La Brabançonne, or celebrating Belgian National Day were banned and those {{breaking the rules}} risked strict prison sentences. Newspapers, books and mail were all tightly censored and regulated. Numerous high-profile Belgian figures, including Adolphe Max, the mayor of Brussels, and the historian Henri Pirenne, were imprisoned in Germany as hostages. The aftermath of the Battle of Verdun in 1916 marked {{a turning point in}} the occupation and was followed by more repressive measures by the administration, including the deportation of workers to Germany.|$|E
5|$|Traffic {{conditions}} on the parkway often exceed its intended capacity of 60,000 vehicles per day. Today, some sections carry an average of 100,000 vehicles a day and have bumper-to-bumper traffic conditions during commuting hours. The parkway was planned {{to be one of}} two north-south expressways into downtown Toronto. The other was cancelled due to <b>public</b> <b>opposition,</b> leaving the DVP as the sole north-south expressway into downtown. The parkway is also used by regional transit buses which can access designated lanes to pass slow-moving traffic.|$|E
5|$|Bardanes is {{probably}} identical with the patrikios Bardanios who {{appears in the}} Chronicle of Theophanes the Confessor in the mid-790s. In 795, he was Domestic of the Schools (commander of the Scholai guards), and was dispatched to arrest the monk Plato of Sakkoudion for his <b>public</b> <b>opposition</b> to the second marriage of Emperor Constantine VI (r. 780–797) to Plato's niece Theodote. In 797, as strategos (military governor) of the Thracesian Theme, this same Bardanios supported the Empress-mother Irene of Athens when she usurped the throne from her son. On Easter Monday, 1 April 799, he is recorded {{as one of the}} four patrikioi (along with Niketas Triphyllios, Sisinnios Triphyllios and Constantine Boilas) who led the horses of the Empress's carriage on a unique triumphal procession from the palace to the Church of the Holy Apostles.|$|E

5|$|In 1919, the Rowlatt Act gave {{extensive}} {{powers to}} the British government and police, and allowed indefinite {{arrest and detention}} of individuals, warrant-less searches and seizures, restrictions on public gatherings, and intensive censorship of media and publications. The <b>public</b> <b>opposition</b> to this act eventually led to mass campaigns of non-violent civil disobedience throughout the country demanding guaranteed civil freedoms, and limitations on government power. Indians, who were seeking independence and their own government, were particularly influenced by the independence of Ireland {{and the development of}} the Irish constitution. Also, the directive principles of state policy in Irish constitution were looked upon by the people of India as an inspiration for the independent India's government to comprehensively tackle complex social and economic challenges across a vast, diverse nation and population.|$|E
5|$|No formal {{coursing}} {{has taken}} place in Northern Ireland since 2002, as Ministers have refused the coursing clubs permission to net hares, and have protected them from being coursed or hunted under the Game Preservation (Northern Ireland) Act and in June 2010 the Northern Ireland Assembly voted to ban the practice. The two extant Northern Ireland coursing clubs since 2002 have travelled to the Republic to hold meetings jointly with coursing clubs there. Opinion polls commissioned by the League Against Cruel Sports as part of its campaigning have shown very strong <b>public</b> <b>opposition</b> to hare coursing from both urban and rural residents of Northern Ireland (and the Republic of Ireland).|$|E
5|$|<b>Public</b> <b>opposition</b> to {{the project}} was broad. The Adelaide City Council objected to the plan {{on the basis that}} it would {{interfere}} with the well-designed layout of the city proper. In response, the government altered the plan to redirect the line underneath the city, at a considerable increase in cost. Residents in inner-city suburbs such as St Peters were concerned about the noise of the light rail vehicles, and protested against any disruption of the Torrens Gorge in the Modbury corridor. Test drilling commenced for the tunnel, but the entire light rail project was halted in 1980 after Premier David Tonkin appointed Michael Wilson, an opponent of the plan, as Transport Minister.|$|E
40|$|From a 1996 survey {{comparing}} {{the views of}} economists and ordinary voters, Bryan Caplan deduces several biases—anti-market, anti-foreign, pessimistic, and makework biases—to support his thesis that voters are rationally irrational, i. e., that, aware of the inconsequentiality of their votes, they rationally indulge their “preferences” for public policies that have harmful results. Yet if the standard of comparison is the <b>public's</b> <b>opposition</b> to harmful policies, rather than the level of its opposition relative to that of economists, the “biases” disappear. In absolute terms, voters support free trade and are against protectionism, such that free-trade agreements are more prevalent among democratic, rather than autocratic, regimes. Finally, the protectionist policies that are adopted {{in this country are}} the product of interest-group politics, not of voters' wrongheaded policy preferences...|$|R
5000|$|In December 2011, {{the newly}} elected Kukuriku {{coalition}} government announced that the modernisation of the IVF law {{would be one of}} its first priorities. Proposed changes to the law would allow single women access to IVF as well. Other changes were also proposed concerning the freezing of embryos and the fertilization of eggs. The Catholic Church immediately indicated its <b>public</b> <b>oppositions</b> to these changes, stating that they had not been involved in the discussions as much as they should like to have been. The Church subsequently initiated a petition against the legislation, but the Minister of Health, Rajko Ostojić, announced that the law would be going ahead with no compromises. When asked about his attitude on lesbian couples having access to IVF Ostojić said: [...] "Gay is OK!" ...|$|R

5|$|Royal Oak sank {{with up to}} 3,000tons of {{fuel oil}} aboard, the precise amount being unknown since such records were lost with the ship. Oil leaked from the {{corroding}} hull at an increased rate during the 1990s and concerns about the environmental impact led the Ministry of Defence to consider plans for extracting it. Royal Oaks status as a war grave required that surveys and any proposed techniques for removing the oil be handled sensitively: plans in the 1950s to raise and salvage the wreck had been dropped in response to <b>public</b> <b>opposition.</b> In addition to the ethical concerns, poorly managed efforts could destabilise the wreck, resulting in a mass release of the remaining oil; the ship also contains many tons of unexploded ordnance.|$|E
5|$|The 2009 {{white paper}} {{outlined}} the replacement submarine as a 4,000-ton vessel fitted with land-attack cruise missiles {{in addition to}} torpedoes and anti-ship missiles, capable of launching and recovering covert operatives while submerged, and carrying surveillance and intelligence-gathering equipment. The project initially had four options: a Military-Off-The-Shelf (MOTS) design without modification, a MOTS design modified for Australian conditions, an evolution of an existing submarine, or a newly designed submarine. Nuclear propulsion was ruled out {{because of the lack}} of nuclear infrastructure and <b>public</b> <b>opposition</b> to nuclear technology. Designs initially considered for purchase or modification included the Spanish S-80 class, the French-designed Scorpène class, the German-designed Type 214, and Japan's Sōryū class, along with an evolution of the Collins.|$|E
5|$|The East Washington Avenue Bridge serves an {{area that}} was {{previously}} known as Pembroke, the name stemming from the 1650s, that grew to become a prosperous agricultural community. East of Pembroke was the village of Newfield, which was chartered as the borough of Bridgeport in 1800. In 1821, it became the township of Bridgeport before being chartered as a city in 1836. The need for the bridge arose when Reverend Birdsey Noble purchased 50 acres from Senator Wright; {{with the intention of}} selling housing lots. The location of the bridge was originally planned to be one quarter of a mile to the south, but it was changed through <b>public</b> <b>opposition,</b> and a toll bridge was constructed in 1836. The description of this bridge and details of its service life and replacement have not been found in records.|$|E
