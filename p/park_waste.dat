40|$|We report here an {{assessment}} of sources and inputs of organic and inorganic pollutants to the Doñana National Park (SW Spain), {{one of the finest}} wetlands in Europe. In the absence of local pollution sources, the occurrence and distribution of heavy metals (Zn, Cu, Pb), organochlorine compounds (DDT and PCBs) and hydrocarbons (both natural and anthropogenic) in different biotic and abiotic compartments of the park are explained in terms of transport processes related to geographical, hydrological and biological factors. In this respect, it has been recognised that drainage waters from the northern opencast-worked polymetallic sulphide deposits constitute a chronic input of heavy metals into the <b>park.</b> <b>Waste</b> waters from olive-oil manufacturing mills in the area may also contribute to the mobilisation of metals towards the park. However, the resulting relative distributions of Zn, Cu and Pb within the park differ from those of mine effluents, indicating a differential transport of these metals through the water systems. Zinc seems to be the best indicator of input from the mining area. Petroleum hydrocarbons enter the park from the SE via the main rivers and tidal sea movements, whereas PAHs, PCBs and DDTs are uniformly distributed at very low levels in surface sediments, indicating a contribution by aeolian transport. Evidence of inefficient recycling of organic matter in the shallow ponds is obtained by the identification of well preserved natural products from local plants and chemical markers of denitrifying bacteria (cyanobacterial markers).

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{focuses on}} the spatial and {{architectural}} integration of a combined waste (or: wastewater) /energy system in the EVA Centre (Information Center on Sustainability with conference center, hotel, and Spa & Vitality center) in the deep green district ‘Lanxmeer ’ in Culemborg (the Netherlands). The design of the district and the building is based on permaculture, Reggio Emilia and organic design principles. An innovative mixture of ‘red and green ’ development is presented (urban agriculture), together with a concept of integrated decentralised technologies for wastewater and organic waste treatment with energy and nutrients recovery. The concept is called Sustainable Implant (S. I.). Principally, the concept {{is based on a}} small scale biogas installation (with treatment of blackwater and green waste/garden & <b>park</b> <b>waste),</b> Combined Heat Power (CHP) and accompanying closed glasshouse, designed as a four storey high double skin façade of the EVA Centre, with partial wastewater treatment based on the Living Machine concept. These compact ‘hanging gardens’, as they are called, are situated in a non-ventilated space with heat (and water) recovery, heat/cold storage (in an underlying aquifer) and with injection of the surplus CO 2 of the biogas plant. The S. I. will be realized {{as a part of the}} EVA Centre and has an interconnecting role between both district and EVA Centre, inhabitants and visitors. The system layout and the dimensioning backgrounds are explained in this paper. Additional emphasis is put on maintenance, conservation and administration of the integrated whole, and the possible consequences for the district and its inhabitants...|$|E

40|$|Globally, many {{countries}} worldwide aim at increasing the environmental sustainability of waste management activities. Special attention {{is devoted to}} bio-waste, as its improper handling may have severe environmental consequences. In particular, most waste management strategies should encourage diverting bio-waste away from landfills to reduce {{emissions of greenhouse gases}} and leachate. The European Waste Framework Directive (WFD – 2008 / 98 /EC) defines bio-waste as “biodegradable garden and <b>park</b> <b>waste,</b> food and kitchen waste from households, restaurants, caterers and retail premises and comparable waste from food processing plants”. Bio-waste {{should not be confused with}} the wider term “biodegradable waste”, which covers also other biodegradable materials such as wood, paper and cardboard. In Europe, landfilling of untreated bio-waste is being progressively reduced to meet the requirements set by the Landfill Directive (1999 / 31 /EC). Other options for bio-waste management are then prioritized (e. g. biological treatment), inline with the so-called “waste hierarchy”, the legally binding priority order for waste management established by the Waste Framework Directive (2008 / 98 /EC). However, following the waste hierarchy may not always lead to the identification of the most environmentally sound option, and new approaches are thus needed for a more differentiated and science based support to decision-making for bio-waste management. For this purpose, the Institute for Environment and Sustainability (IES) of Joint Research Centre (JRC) has developed guidelines that provide environmentally sound support to decision-making and policy-making for bio-waste management using Life Cycle Thinking (LCT) and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). The methodological approach developed in the JRC guidelines is presented and contextualized in this paper. Although the findings presented in this paper refer to the European context, their appropriateness extends far outside Europe and could be used to improve the environmental performance of bio-waste management strategies elsewhere in the world, including developing countries.

40|$|Environmental {{problems}} {{and climate change}} arising from waste incineration are taken quite seriously in the world. In Korea, the waste disposal methods are largely classified into landfill, incineration, recycling, etc. {{and the amount of}} incinerated waste has risen by 24. 5 % from 2002. In the analysis of CO 2 emissions estimations of waste incinerators fossil carbon content are main factor by the IPCC. FCF differs depending on the characteristics of waste in each country, and a wide range of default values are proposed by the IPCC. This study conducted research on the existing classifications of the IPCC and Korean waste classification systems based on FCF for accurate greenhouse gas emissions estimation of waste incineration. The characteristics possible for sorting were classified according to FCF and form. The characteristics sorted according to fossil carbon fraction were paper, textiles, rubber, and leather. Paper was classified into pure paper and processed paper; textiles were classified into cotton and synthetic fibers; and rubber and leather were classified into artificial and natural. The analysis of FCF was implemented by collecting representative samples from each classification group, by applying the 14 C method, and using AMS equipment. And the analysis values were compared with the default values proposed by the IPCC. In this study of garden and <b>park</b> <b>waste</b> and plastics, the differences were within the range of the IPCC default values or the differences were negligible. However, coated paper, synthetic textiles, natural rubber, synthetic rubber, artificial leather, and other wastes showed differences of over 10 % in FCF content. IPCC is comprised of largely 9 types of qualitative classifications, in emissions estimation a great difference can occur from the combined characteristics according with the existing IPCC classification system by using the minutely classified waste characteristics as in this study. Implications: Fossil carbon fraction (FCF) differs depending on the characteristics of waste in each country; and a wide range of default values are proposed by the IPCC. This study conducted research on the existing classifications of the IPCC and Korean waste classification systems based on FCF for accurate greenhouse gas emissions estimation of waste incineration.

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} program Functional Compost is to develop and test compost, which have been enriched with chitin, for plant growth promoting properties and to recognise specific mechanisms. Two types of compost were included in the program: source separated biodegradable municipal solid waste compost (DM = 62 %) and garden and <b>park</b> <b>waste</b> compost (DM = 66 %). Chitin was added in trace amounts during the maturity phase, combined with two levels of trace amounts immediately before adding the compost to the growth medium. The research program includes several parallel experiments. In experiment I, compost (20 vol. %) was added to soil (no plants) and incubated at 15 C for 5 month, under regular determination of microbial respiration and gross and net N mineralization. There was a significant increase in respiration due to chitin enrichment, which could not be explained by the amount of C derived from the chitin, which therefore suggest a priming effect. The N analyses are still being processed in the laboratory, but data are expected to be available at the conference. In experiment II, compost was mixed with sand, put into pots in a climate chamber, and spring barley seeds infected with Fusarium culmorum were sown in the pots. After 3 weeks of growth, the health of the plants was determined, and the chitinase activity in the sand was measured. The health of the plants and the chitinase activity was significantly higher in the treatments receiving municipal waste compared to the treatments receiving garden waste compost. However, there was no clear effect of the chitin enrichment. Additionally, the microbial community structure of the two types of compost, with and without early chitin, was determined by Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE). There was a clear separation between compost types, and with or without early chitin amendment. Experiment III is a regular growth experiment, and is running right now. Compost has been incorporated into soil, put into pots in the greenhouse, and spring barley is grown for 2 month before determination for wet and dry weight and N uptake. Data from experiment III is expected to be available at the conference...|$|E

40|$|This {{analysis}} {{describes the}} handling of biodegradable park and garden waste in the municipality of Lund in Sweden, from these three different perspectives: impact on environment, energy consumption and costs. Today‘s methods, {{as well as some}} other different possibilities in recycling of park and garden waste are investigated. A limitation in the analysis is that all the park and garden waste handled in the municipality is either composted or returned directly to the area after shredding. Composting may be carried out either regionally at SYSAV's "mattress" compost plant (see fig. 2) at Spillepeng in Malmö, or locally on a smaller scale in the municipality of Lund. These limitations allow the impact on the environment to be equal to the fuel consumption for transports and treatment of park and garden waste. More than 7000 tonnes of park and garden waste are produced in the municipality of Lund every year. Almost half of this comes from the household‘s garden waste. The remainder originates from different housing companies, church-yard management, parks etc. Almost half of the park and garden waste from the municipality of Lund is transported to the regional "mattress" compost at Spillepeng. The rest is treated at local windrow composting plants, by home composting or by composting in different areas e. g. in residential areas and in allotments, and by bringing it back, after shredding, to where it originated. Transporting park and garden waste is both energy consuming and expensive, since the material is voluminous. By shredding the park and garden waste it is possible to increase volume weight by four to six times. With the higher volume weight the efficiency of the transports will increase as well. While the distance of transport exceeds 25 km, {{the handling of}} park and garden waste will not be as costly and energy consuming if it is shredded before the transport to a mattress compost plant, as when it is transported unshredded. The cost and energy consumption for the shredding are covered by the higher efficiency in transport, at this distance. Most of the larger composting plants for park and garden waste in Sweden are big central windrow composts. There are small differences in costs and energy consumption between different sizes of windrow composts. This means that long transports of park and garden waste to large central windrow compost plants, compared to short transports to small windrow compost plants, is not a way to save costs and energy. Composting at "mattress" compost plants is not as costly and energy consuming as composting in windrow compost plants. On the other hand, to make a "mattress" compost plant profitable, there must be more than 5000 tonnes of park and garden waste composted every year. If the park and garden waste is shredded at a recycling station it may also be possible to compost it in windrows at the station. Costs and energy consumption for composting park and garden waste are higher at local windrow composts than at regional "mattress" composts. The costly and energy consuming transports of park and garden waste, on the other hand, makes the handling less energy consuming and costly if the park and garden waste is composted locally at a windrow compost, compared to transporting it to a regional mattress compost, if the transport distance exceeds 5 - 6 km. If` all park and garden waste from the municipality of Lund is transported to the regional "mattress" compost plant at Spillepeng, the cost and fuel consumption are calculated to be approx. SEK 5. l millions and approx. 125 m 3 diesel/year respectively. If all the park and garden waste is handled within the municipality by home composting of garden waste and by shredding all the <b>park</b> <b>waste</b> before transport to a local windrow compost, the cost is calculated to decrease to less than SEK 3 millions and the fuel consumption is calculated to decrease to about 20 m 3 diesel/year. Composting is not an end in itself, but it is a way to recycle park and garden waste from green urban areas. By bringing the biodegradable organic material back directly after shredding it, it is also possible to recycle park and garden waste. Another way of recycling is burning ligneous material and digesting biodegradable material with a high amount of nitrogen, followed by spreading of ash and digestion rests. To evaluate the impact on the environment and costs for these alternatives further research is needed. To clarify differences in emissions and the impact on the environment of different processes of decomposition of park and garden waste such as "matress" composting, windrow composting, home composting, natural decomposition, digesting and burning, thorough measurements of emissions from these processes are needed...|$|E
40|$|In such territories {{where food}} {{production}} is mostly scattered in several small / medium size or even domestic farms, {{a lot of}} heterogeneous residues are produced yearly, since farmers usually carry out different activities in their properties. The amount and composition of farm residues, therefore, widely change during year, according to the single production process periodically achieved. Coupling high efficiency micro-cogeneration energy units with easy handling biomass conversion equipments, suitable to treat different materials, would provide many important advantages to the farmers and to the community as well, so {{that the increase in}} feedstock flexibility of gasification units is nowadays seen as a further paramount step towards their wide spreading in rural areas and as a real necessity for their utilization at small scale. Two main research topics were thought to be of main concern at this purpose, and they were therefore discussed in this work: the investigation of fuels properties impact on gasification process development and the technical feasibility of small scale gasification units integration with cogeneration systems. According to these two main aspects, the present work was thus divided in two main parts. The first one is focused on the biomass gasification process, that was investigated in its theoretical aspects and then analytically modelled in order to simulate thermo-chemical conversion of different biomass fuels, such as wood (<b>park</b> <b>waste</b> wood and softwood), wheat straw, sewage sludge and refuse derived fuels. The main idea is to correlate the results of reactor design procedures with the physical properties of biomasses and the corresponding working conditions of gasifiers (temperature profile, above all), in order to point out the main differences which prevent the use of the same conversion unit for different materials. At this scope, a gasification kinetic free model was initially developed in Excel sheets, considering different values of air to biomass ratio and the downdraft gasification technology as particular examined application. The differences in syngas production and working conditions (process temperatures, above all) among the considered fuels were tried to be connected to some biomass properties, such elementary composition, ash and water contents. The novelty of this analytical approach was the use of kinetic constants ratio in order to determine oxygen distribution among the different oxidation reactions (regarding volatile matter only) while equilibrium of water gas shift reaction was considered in gasification zone, by which the energy and mass balances involved in the process algorithm were linked together, as well. Moreover, the main advantage of this analytical tool is the easiness by which the input data corresponding to the particular biomass materials can be inserted into the model, so that a rapid evaluation on their own thermo-chemical conversion properties is possible to be obtained, mainly based on their chemical composition A good conformity of the model results with the other literature and experimental data was detected for almost all the considered materials (except for refuse derived fuels, because of their unfitting chemical composition with the model assumptions). Successively, a dimensioning procedure for open core downdraft gasifiers was set up, by the analysis on the fundamental thermo-physical and thermo-chemical mechanisms which are supposed to regulate the main solid conversion steps involved in the gasification process. Gasification units were schematically subdivided in four reaction zones, respectively corresponding to biomass heating, solids drying, pyrolysis and char gasification processes, and the time required for the full development of each of these steps was correlated to the kinetics rates (for pyrolysis and char gasification processes only) and to the heat and mass transfer phenomena from gas to solid phase. On the basis of this analysis and according to the kinetic free model results and biomass physical properties (particles size, above all) it was achieved that for all the considered materials char gasification step is kinetically limited and therefore temperature is the main working parameter controlling this step. Solids drying is mainly regulated by heat transfer from bulk gas to the inner layers of particles and the corresponding time especially depends on particle size. Biomass heating is almost totally achieved by the radiative heat transfer from the hot walls of reactor to the bed of material. For pyrolysis, instead, working temperature, particles size and the same nature of biomass (through its own pyrolysis heat) have all comparable weights on the process development, so that the corresponding time can be differently depending on one of these factors according to the particular fuel is gasified and the particular conditions are established inside the gasifier. The same analysis also led to the estimation of reaction zone volumes for each biomass fuel, so as a comparison among the dimensions of the differently fed gasification units was finally accomplished. Each biomass material showed a different volumes distribution, so that any dimensioned gasification unit {{does not seem to be}} suitable for more than one biomass species. Nevertheless, since reactors diameters were found out quite similar for all the examined materials, it could be envisaged to design a single units for all of them by adopting the largest diameter and by combining together the maximum heights of each reaction zone, as they were calculated for the different biomasses. A total height of gasifier as around 2400 mm would be obtained in this case. Besides, by arranging air injecting nozzles at different levels along the reactor, gasification zone could be properly set up according to the particular material is in turn gasified. Finally, since gasification and pyrolysis times were found to considerably change according to even short temperature variations, it could be also envisaged to regulate air feeding rate for each gasified material (which process temperatures depend on), so as the available reactor volumes would be suitable for the complete development of solid conversion in each case, without even changing fluid dynamics behaviour of the unit as well as air/biomass ratio in noticeable measure. The second part of this work dealt with the gas cleaning systems to be adopted downstream the gasifiers in order to run high efficiency CHP units (i. e. internal engines and micro-turbines). Especially in the case multi–fuel gasifiers are assumed to be used, weightier gas cleaning lines need to be envisaged in order to reach the standard gas quality degree required to fuel cogeneration units. Indeed, as the more heterogeneous feed to the gasification unit, several contaminant species can simultaneously be present in the exit gas stream and, as a consequence, suitable gas cleaning systems have to be designed. In this work, an overall study on gas cleaning lines assessment is carried out. Differently from the other research efforts carried out in the same field, the main scope is to define general arrangements for gas cleaning lines suitable to remove several contaminants from the gas stream, independently on the feedstock material and the energy plant size The gas contaminant species taken into account in this analysis were: particulate, tars, sulphur (in H 2 S form), alkali metals, nitrogen (in NH 3 form) and acid gases (in HCl form). For each of these species, alternative cleaning devices were designed according to three different plant sizes, respectively corresponding with 8 Nm 3 /h, 125 Nm 3 /h and 350 Nm 3 /h gas flows. Their performances were examined on the basis of their optimal working conditions (efficiency, temperature and pressure drops, above all) and their own consumption of energy and materials. Successively, the designed units were combined together in different overall gas cleaning line arrangements, paths, by following some technical constraints which were mainly determined from the same performance analysis on the cleaning units and from the presumable synergic effects by contaminants on the right working of some of them (filters clogging, catalysts deactivation, etc.). One of the main issues to be stated in paths design accomplishment was the tars removal from the gas stream, preventing filters plugging and/or line pipes clogging At this scope, a catalytic tars cracking unit was envisaged as the only solution to be adopted, and, therefore, a catalytic material which is able to work at relatively low temperatures was chosen. Nevertheless, a rapid drop in tars cracking efficiency was also estimated for this same material, so that an high frequency of catalysts regeneration and a consequent relevant air consumption for this operation were calculated in all of the cases. Other difficulties had to be overcome in the abatement of alkali metals, which condense at temperatures lower than tars, but they also need to be removed in the first sections of gas cleaning line in order to avoid corrosion of materials. In this case a dry scrubber technology was envisaged, by using the same fine particles filter units and by choosing for them corrosion resistant materials, like ceramic ones. Besides these two solutions which seem to be unavoidable in gas cleaning line design, high temperature gas cleaning lines were not possible to be achieved for the two larger plant sizes, as well. Indeed, as the use of temperature control devices was precluded in the adopted design procedure, ammonia partial oxidation units (as the only considered methods for the abatement of ammonia at high temperature) were not suitable for the large scale units, because of the high increase of reactors temperature by the exothermic reactions involved in the process. In spite of these limitations, yet, overall arrangements for each considered plant size were finally designed, so that the possibility to clean the gas up to the required standard degree was technically demonstrated, even in the case several contaminants are simultaneously present in the gas stream. Moreover, all the possible paths defined for the different plant sizes were compared each others on the basis of some defined operational parameters, among which total pressure drops, total energy losses, number of units and secondary materials consumption. On the basis of this analysis, dry gas cleaning methods proved preferable to the ones including water scrubber technology in al of the cases, especially because of the high water consumption provided by water scrubber units in ammonia adsorption process. This result is yet connected to the possibility to use activated carbon units for ammonia removal and Nahcolite adsorber for chloride acid. The very high efficiency of this latter material is also remarkable. Finally, as an estimation of the overall energy loss pertaining the gas cleaning process, the total enthalpy losses estimated for the three plant sizes were compared with the respective gas streams energy contents, these latter obtained on the basis of low heating value of gas only. This overall study on gas cleaning systems is thus proposed as an analytical tool by which different gas cleaning line configurations can be evaluated, according to the particular practical application they are adopted for and the size of cogeneration unit they are connected to. ...|$|E

To conclude, the public has high acceptance for not having litter bins along the trails but the Department still has to closely monitor the cleanliness and hygiene conditions of the trails. The effectiveness of this trial scheme must be critically evaluated before it is implemented to the whole Hong Kong to prevent irreversible destruction to the protected country <b>parks.</b> <b>Waste</b> management strategies such as waste classification and waste study, installation of drinking fountains along hiking trails and redesigning litter bins are suggested to tackle the waste problems in the country parks. published_or_final_versionEnvironmental ManagementMasterMaster of Science in Environmental Managemen...|$|R

50|$|With {{the end of}} the North American Rockwell contract, the {{remaining}} Federal government holdings were transferred to the General Services Administration as surplus property for interim management and eventual disposal. In the mid-1980s, {{the remaining}} parcels of the former post were transferred to the Missouri Department of Conservation for wildlife management and outdoor recreation, the Neosho R-5 public school district for agriculture instructional farm, and the Missouri National Guard to operate a military training facility under license from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on 4358.09 acre. The remainder of the land was given to various public and private entities which uses now include a municipal airport, industrial <b>parks,</b> industrial <b>waste</b> treatment facility operations, regional landfill, underground fuel storage, burn pits and lagoons.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIt has {{commonly}} {{been suggested}} that in modern cities individual or household deprivation (for example, low income or education) is amplified by area level deprivation (for example, lack of jobs or good schools), in ways which damage {{the health of the}} poorest and increase health inequalities. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the location of a range of resources and exposures by deprivation in a UK city. We examined the location of 42 resources in Glasgow City, Scotland, in 2005 – 2006, by quintile of small area deprivation. Measures included number per 1000 population, network distance to nearest resource, and percentage of data zones containing at least one of each type of resource. Twelve resources had higher density in, and/or were closer to or more common in, more deprived neighbourhoods: public nurseries, public primary schools, police stations, pharmacies, credit unions, post offices, bus stops, bingo halls, public swimming pools, public sports centres, outdoor play areas, and vacant and derelict land/buildings. Sixteen had higher density in, and/or were closer to, or more common in, more affluent neighbourhoods: public secondary schools, private schools, banks, building societies, museums/art galleries, railway stations, subway stations, tennis courts, bowling greens, private health clubs, private swimming pools, colleges, A & E hospitals, <b>parks,</b> <b>waste</b> disposal sites, and tourist attractions. Private nurseries, Universities, fire stations, general, dental and ophthalmic practices, pawn brokers, ATMs, supermarkets, fast food chains, cafes, public libraries, golf courses, and cinemas showed no clear pattern by deprivation. Thus it appears that in the early 21 st century access to resources does not always disadvantage poorer neighbourhoods in the UK. We conclude that we need to ensure that theories and policies are based on up-to-date and context-specific empirical evidence on the distribution of neighbourhood resources, and to engage in further research on interactions between individual and environmental factors in shaping health and health inequalities...|$|R
