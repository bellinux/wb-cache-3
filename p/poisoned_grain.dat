40|$|Grain {{refinement}} of aluminium and magnesium alloys {{has been a}} challenging topic for decades and this {{is partly due to}} the complex nature of the mechanisms occurring during solidification and the lack of a common experimental method allowing comparison of data from different research groups. A new analytical approach that plots grain size versus the inverse of the growth restriction factor Q enables additional valuable information to be revealed about the efficiency and potency of grain refiner particles and master alloys. The present paper describes the new analytical approach and then gives examples where insights into the grain refinement mechanisms have been achieved. For aluminium alloys, the new analytical approach compares the effectiveness of different master alloys and examines the mechanism of <b>poisoning</b> of <b>grain</b> refinement by Zr. For magnesium alloys, the new analytical approach is applied to explain phenomena such as superheating and native grain refinement.

40|$|This paper traces how {{advances}} in the fundamental understanding of initial solidification during grain refinement has led to practical changes in grain refinement practice leading to substantial cost savings for alloy producers. A theoretical study of grain refinement showed that the achievement of a fine grained microstructure is dependent upon the addition of potent and numerous nucleating substrates and solute elements that provide constitutional undercooling to facilitate further nucleation in the melt. In Al alloys, Ti {{is the most effective}} solute element for grain refining as its ability to generate constitutional undercooling far exceeds all other elements. It is particularly effective in low solute wrought alloys, where {{it has been shown that}} it can be used to partially substitute for more expensive grain refiners substantially reducing the cost of the grain refining process. In contrast, because of the high solute levels in Al-Si foundry alloys, Ti additions are not effective grain refiners despite being regularly added to these alloys for this purpose and are therefore an unnecessary addition. Finally, a new methodology of assessing grain refinement is applied to the assessment of different <b>grain</b> refiners, <b>poisoning</b> of <b>grain</b> refinement in Al alloys and grain refinement mechanisms in Mg alloys...|$|R
40|$|To {{be able to}} {{determine}} the grain size obtained from the addition of a grain refining master alloy, the relationship between grain size (d), solute content (defined by the growth restriction factor Q), and the potency and number density of nucleant particles needs to be understood. A study was undertaken on aluminium alloys where additions of TiB 2 and Ti were made to eight wrought aluminum alloys covering a range of alloying elements and compositions. It was found from analysis of the data that d = a/(3) root pct TiB 2 + b/Q. From consideration of the experimental data and from further analysis of previously published data, it is shown that the coefficients a and b relate to characteristics of the nucleant particles added by a grain refiner. The term a is related to the maximum density of active TiB 2 nucleant particles within the melt, while b is related to their potency. By using the analysis methodology presented in this article, the performance characteristics of different master alloys were defined and the effects of Zr and Si on the <b>poisoning</b> of <b>grain</b> refinement were illustrated...|$|R

Common sources are from mining and industrial wastes; vehicle emissions; lead-acid batteries; fertilisers; paints; treated woods; aging water supply infrastructure; and microplastics floating in the world's oceans. Arsenic, cadmium and lead may be present in children's toys at levels that exceed regulatory standards. Lead can be used in toys as a stabilizer, color enhancer, or anti-corrosive agent. Cadmium is sometimes employed as a stabilizer, or to increase the mass and luster of toy jewelry. Arsenic is thought to be used in connection with coloring dyes.

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{tested the}} efficacy of a single drench of virginiamycin for protecting sheep against <b>grain</b> <b>poisoning</b> (lactic acidosis). In Expt 1, 80 penned sheep (30 ± 0. 4 kg) were drenched with 0, 40, 80, or 160 mg of virginiamycin in 10 mL of water, then fed wheat ad libitum. Eleven sheep that received no virginiamycin and one receiving 40 mg virginiamycin were withdrawn from the trial due to inappetence after eating wheat. Sheep drenched with 80 or 60 mg virginiamycin were heavier (P < 0. 05) than control sheep at 20 days after drenching, and none was withdrawn. Rumen pH was higher (P < 0. 05) in sheep drenched with virginiamycin than in control sheep. In Expt 2, 100 sheep (62 ± 0. 7 kg) were either gradually introduced to a standing wheat crop by restricting {{the length of time}} they had access to the crop, or drenched with 160 mg of virginiamycin then given unlimited access to the crop.

40|$|Pyrrolizidine {{alkaloids}} (PAs) {{are one of}} {{the most}} significant groups of plant toxins in the world and are an important cause of poisoning in livestock, resulting in significant financial and production losses each year (Kellerman et al. 1996). Pyrrolizidine alkaloids may also enter the human food chain as contaminants of grains, via animal products such as milk, eggs and honey or may be consumed as constituents of herbal medicines (ANZFA 2001). Not all PAs are toxic. Pyrrolizidine alkaloids affecting human health are the esters of 1, 2 -unsaturated hydroxymethyl dehydropyrrolizidines (DHP). Before it can be converted to DHP, PAs need to have certain essential features, which include an unsaturated 3 -pyrrole ring, one or two hydroxyl groups attached to the ring, one or two ester groups and a branched acid moiety (Mattocks 1986). These compounds can be metabolized in the liver to nucleophillic pyrroles which cause damage to hepatocytes (Winter and Segall 1989). Although the involvement of PAs in the development of hepatic veno-occlusive disease is well established (Bras et al. 1961), there is still uncertainty concerning the consequences of long-term, low-dose exposure in humans. Exposure to PAs through the use of herbal remedies may also be a contributing factor to the high rates of liver cancer and cirrhosis seen in Africa (Steenkamp et al. 2000). Crotalaria spp. are known to contain toxic PAs and various incidences of human <b>poisoning</b> through contaminated <b>grains</b> have been recorded in the scientific literature (IPCS 1989). Legislation controlling the allowable levels of toxic seeds in grains in South Africa is generally much stricter than in many other grain producing countries. The Soybean and Sunflower Forum recently commissioned a study (Eloff et al. 2003) to review published and unpublished information on toxic seed that could affect human health in South Africa and to make recommendations accordingly. Crotalaria sphaerocarpa is one of the problem plants discussed in the review and is apparently the only species which regularly contaminate grain in certain areas in South Africa. There is uncertainty at present about the number of these seeds that should be allowed in grains and the threat that this may pose to human health. Based on the review a provisional recommended level of 10 seeds of C. sphaerocarpa per 10 kg of grain was proposed as an approximated safe level in the report. As emphasized by the authors (Eloff et al. 2003), this absolute level is based on assumptions that must still be tested. As a follow-up on the report, a sensitive LC-MS/MS method for the determination of toxic PAs in plants was developed in this study. The characteristic fragments produced by 1, 2 -unsaturated necine bases under specific MS/MS conditions were used to discriminate between the toxic and non-toxic PAs. The concentration of these PAs were then determined using multi-reaction-mode experiments. Quantitative results were calculated against a retrorsine calibration curve and expressed as µg retrorsine equivalents per gram plant material. Various extraction methods described in the literature were investigated. A final liquid-liquid extraction method was used to extract unsaturated PAs from small amounts (about one gram) of milled plant samples. Recoveries from spiked lucerne samples were 98 % for retrorsine and 105 % for monocrotaline. To determine the applicability of the LC-MS/MS method the unsaturated PA content of C. laburnifolia and C. dura were investigated. Crotalaria laburnifolia, which is regarded as non-toxic, contained low concentrations (< 20 µg. g- 1) of unsaturated PAs. Crotalaria dura, on the other hand, is known to be toxic to livestock and the concentration of unsaturated PAs was significantly higher (585 µg. g- 1). The toxic PA content of Senecio inaequidens was also determined after an incident of livestock poisoning. The plant material contained very high concentrations of retrorsine (11. 5 mg. g- 1) and senecionine (0. 5 mg. g- 1) which were also present in the rumen content collected post-motally. These results confirmed the suspected toxicity of S. inaequidens. The LC-MS/MS method was also used to follow variations in unsaturated PA content in C. sphaerocarpa plants during the growing season. Pyrrolizidine alkaloids were present in the roots of the growing plants as N-oxides and also found in the mature aerial parts, where it was present mainly as the basic alkaloids. The method was used to determine the concentration of unsaturated PAs, in various C. sphaerocarpa seeds from different locations, in order to calculate the allowable level of C sphaerocarpa seed in maize. Of all the seed samples analyzed, the highest unsaturated PA concentration found was 150 µg. g- 1. The allowable level of seed was calculated using this result and was found to be 656 seeds per 10 kg maize, based on the Australian and New Zealand Food Authority level of 0. 1 µg. kg- 1. day- 1. If these results are confirmed with systematic statistical samples of C. sphaerocarpa seed from different grain production areas, the allowable level could be increased substantially. This may have an economic benefit to grain producers. Thesis (PhD (Paraclinical Science)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2007. Paraclinical SciencesPhDunrestricte...|$|R
