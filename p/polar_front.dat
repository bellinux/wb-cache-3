5|$|The {{thermal wind}} {{relation}} {{does not explain}} why the winds are organized into tight jets, rather than distributed more broadly over the hemisphere. One factor {{that contributes to the}} creation of a concentrated polar jet is the undercutting of sub-tropical air masses by the more dense polar air masses at the <b>polar</b> <b>front.</b> This causes surface low pressure and higher pressure at altitude. At high altitudes, lack of friction allows air to respond freely to the steep pressure gradient with low pressure at high altitude over the pole. This results in the formation of planetary wind circulations that experience a strong Coriolis deflection and thus can be considered 'quasi-geostrophic'. The <b>polar</b> <b>front</b> jet stream is closely linked to the frontogenesis process in midlatitudes, as the acceleration/deceleration of the air flow induces areas of low/high pressure respectively, which link to the formation of cyclones and anticyclones along the <b>polar</b> <b>front</b> in a relatively narrow region.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{tracking}} inland on July16, {{interaction with}} China's mountainous terrain disrupted {{the organization of}} Billie, weakening it down to tropical storm intensity. However, the tropical cyclone's stint over land was short-lived as the system quickly curved northward into the Yellow Sea by July17. Despite moving back over water, Billie continued to weaken, and made landfall on the western coast of North Korea with winds of 75km/h (40mph). Over the Korean peninsula, Billie began to intake cold air from a <b>polar</b> <b>front,</b> enabling the system to transition into an extratropical cyclone by 1800UTC that day. These remnants tracked eastward across the Sea of Japan before they were last noted just off of Hokkaido on July18.|$|E
5|$|<b>Polar</b> <b>front</b> {{theory is}} {{attributed}} to Jacob Bjerknes, and was derived from a coastal network of observation sites in Norway during World War I. This theory proposed that the main inflow into a cyclone was concentrated along two lines of convergence, one ahead (or east) of the low and another trailing equatorward (south in the Northern Hemisphere and north in the Southern Hemisphere) and behind (or west) of the low. The convergence line ahead of the low became known as either the steering line or the warm front. The trailing convergence zone {{was referred to as}} the squall line or cold front. Areas of clouds and rainfall appeared to be focused along these convergence zones. A conveyor belt, also referred to as the warm conveyor belt, is a term describing the flow of a stream of warm moist air originating within the warm sector (or generally equatorward) of an extratropical cyclone in advance of the cold front which slopes up above and poleward (north in the Northern Hemisphere and south in the Southern Hemisphere) of the surface warm front. The concept of the conveyor belt originated in 1969.|$|E

25|$|Swell {{regularity}} varies {{across the}} globe and throughout the year. During winter, heavy swells are generated in the mid-latitudes, when the North and South <b>polar</b> <b>fronts</b> shift toward the Equator. The predominantly Westerly winds generate swells that advance Eastward, so waves tend to be largest on West coasts during winter months. However, an endless train of mid-latitude cyclones cause the isobars to become undulated, redirecting swells at regular intervals toward the tropics.|$|R
25|$|The United Kingdom {{straddles}} the higher mid-latitudes between 49° and 61°N. It {{is on the}} western seaboard of Afro-Eurasia, the world's largest land mass. Since the UK is always in or close to {{the path of the}} <b>polar</b> <b>front</b> jet stream, frequent changes in pressure and unsettled weather are typical. Many types of weather can be experienced in a single day. In general the climate of the UK is cool and often cloudy, and hot temperatures are infrequent.|$|E
25|$|The Köppen climate {{classification}} places Ramallah in the Csa category. Climates of {{this class}} generally {{occur on the}} western sides of continents between the latitudes of 30° and 45°. These climates are in the <b>polar</b> <b>front</b> region in winter, and thus have moderate temperatures and changeable, rainy weather. Summers are hot and dry, due to the domination of the subtropical high pressure systems, except in the immediate coastal areas, where summers are milder due to the nearby presence of cold ocean currents that may bring fog but prevent rain.|$|E
25|$|The subantarctic region {{comprises}} two geographic {{zones and}} three distinct fronts. The northernmost {{boundary of the}} subantarctic region is the rather ill-defined Subtropical Front (STF), {{also referred to as}} the Subtropical Convergence. To the south of the STF is a geographic zone, the Subantarctic Zone (SAZ). South of the SAZ is the Subantarctic Front (SAF). South of the SAF is another marine zone, called the Polar Frontal Zone (PFZ). The SAZ and the PFZ together form the subantarctic region. The southernmost boundary of the PFZ (and hence, the southern border of the subantarctic region) is the Antarctic Convergence, located approximately 200 kilometers south of the Antarctic <b>Polar</b> <b>Front</b> (APF).|$|E
5000|$|The Minuano is a {{cold wind}} that blows in the South of Brazil and in Uruguay. It is widely {{mentioned}} in the Gaúcho folklore of the region. This wind originates from cold <b>polar</b> <b>fronts</b> that come from the South west of South America during periods of high atmospheric pressure, usually following rains caused by {{the shock of the}} cold front with warmer stationary humid air. Some times it produces a [...] "howling" [...] sound.|$|R
25|$|East coasts {{also receive}} heavy winter swells when {{low-pressure}} cells {{form in the}} sub-tropics, where slow moving highs inhibit their movement. These lows produce a shorter fetch than <b>polar</b> <b>fronts,</b> however they can still generate heavy swells, since their slower movement increases the duration of a particular wind direction. The variables of fetch and duration both influence how long wind acts over a wave as it travels, since a wave reaching {{the end of a}} fetch behaves as if the wind died.|$|R
50|$|The Zonda wind is {{produced}} by the northeastward movement of <b>polar</b> <b>fronts,</b> and although is hot and dry at the low-lands, it is the main mechanism for snow precipitation at the high altitude chains, where it looks as viento blanco, reaching speeds sometimes over 200 km/h. Thus, {{instead of being a}} snow-eater, this wind is particularly important for this arid region, as it is connected to the buildup of the winter snow cover and accumulation over the scarce local glaciers.|$|R
25|$|The {{effects of}} local surface low {{pressure}} are extremely limited because upper-level subsidence still continues to block {{any form of}} air ascent. Also, to be protected against rain-bearing weather systems by the atmospheric circulation itself, the desert is made even drier by his geographical configuration and location. Indeed, the extreme aridity of the Sahara can not be only explained by the subtropical high pressure. The Atlas Mountains, found in Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia also help to enhance the aridity of {{the northern part of}} the desert. These major mountain ranges act as a barrier causing a strong rain shadow effect on the leeward side by dropping much of the humidity brought by atmospheric disturbances along the <b>polar</b> <b>front</b> which affects the surrounding Mediterranean climates.|$|E
25|$|The WSC has {{a unique}} {{structure}} as it flows poleward off the western coast of Spitsbergen. It is easiest to discuss horizontal movements and vertical movements of the WSC, separately. The WSC begins its movement in the Norwegian Sea where it branches off the Norwegian Atlantic Current and arrives at Spitsbergen's western coast, where it is guided by the bathymetric profile of the ocean floor surrounding Svalbard. Specifically, it tends to follow along steep continental shelves. The current is quite narrow and strong, having a width of roughly 100 kilometers and a maximum speed of 35cm/s. At about 80° North latitude the WSC splits into two different sections, the Svalbard branch and the Yermak Branch. The Svalbard Branch continues to follow the continental shelf northeastward, and eventually sinks to an intermediate depth and is cyclonically recirculated throughout the Arctic, eventually being pushed out through the East Greenland Current. The Yermak Branch moves northwesterly till about 81°N, and then it moves directly westward and eventually equatorward in the Return Atlantic Current. The Return Atlantic Current is directly east of the East Greenland Current. The high salinity and warm temperatures of the Return Atlantic Current compared to the cold temperatures and low salinities of the EGC contribute {{to the existence of}} the East Greenland <b>Polar</b> <b>Front</b> a result of the strong gradient in both salinity and temperature. There is a current that splits off from the Yermak Branch and flows towards the Northeast at a higher latitude. This current is not well understood in the literature, and thus more information is needed. It is believed this current loops back into the Svalbard Branch further along in its track eastward.|$|E

500|$|Fronts in {{meteorology}} are {{the leading}} edges of air masses that have a density, air temperature, and humidity different from the air mass it is invading. When an air mass passes over an area, it is marked by changes in temperature, moisture, wind speed and direction, atmospheric pressure, and often {{a change in the}} precipitation pattern. The change is called a front, whether it be warm or cold. Cold fronts develop when cold air masses, usually moving equatorward from the polar region high pressure zones, interact with warm moist air of [...] low pressure systems. The fronts develop at the leading edge of that cold air mass and wrap around (counter-clockwise in the northern hemisphere) about the low pressure zone. [...] A <b>polar</b> <b>front</b> may form approximately along the equatorward edge of the high-level polar jet. Fronts are guided by winds aloft, but they normally move at lesser speeds than those winds. In the northern hemisphere, they usually travel from west to east, although they can move in a north-south direction as well as they may wrap around an associated low pressure zone. Movement is driven by the pressure gradient force (horizontal differences in atmospheric pressure) and the Coriolis force (caused by the Earth's rotation on its axis). Frontal zones can be distorted by such geographic features as mountains and large bodies of water.|$|E
