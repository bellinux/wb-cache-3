40|$|Magister Scientiae - MScThe {{industry}} of <b>pension</b> <b>funds</b> {{has become one}} of the drivers of today’s economic activity by its important volume of contribution in the financial market and by creating wealth. The increasing importance that <b>pension</b> <b>funds</b> have acquired in today’s economy and financial market, raises special attention from investors, financial actors and pundits in the sector. Regarding this economic weight of <b>pension</b> <b>funds,</b> a thorough analysis of the performance of different <b>pension</b> <b>funds</b> plans in order to optimise benefits need to be undertaken. The research explores criteria and invariants that make it possible to compare the performance of different <b>pension</b> <b>fund</b> products. <b>Pension</b> <b>fund</b> companies currently do measure their performances with those of others. Likewise, the individual investing in a pension plan compares different products available in the market. There exist different ways of measuring the performance of a <b>pension</b> <b>fund</b> according to their different schemes. Generally, there exist two main <b>pension</b> <b>funds</b> plans. The defined benefit (DB) <b>pension</b> <b>funds</b> plan which is mostly preferred by pension members due to his ability to hold the risk to the <b>pension</b> <b>fund</b> manager. The defined contributions (DC) <b>pension</b> <b>fund</b> plan on the other hand, is more popularly preferred by the <b>pension</b> <b>fund</b> managers due to its ability to transfer the risk to the <b>pension</b> <b>fund</b> members. One of the reasons that motivate <b>pension</b> <b>fund</b> members’ choices of entering into a certain programme is that their expectations of maintaining their living lifestyle after retirement are met by the <b>pension</b> <b>fund</b> strategies. This dissertation investigates the various properties and characteristics of the defined contribution <b>pension</b> <b>fund</b> plan with a minimum guarantee and benchmark in order to mitigate the risk that <b>pension</b> <b>fund</b> members are subject to. For the <b>pension</b> <b>fund</b> manager the aim is to find the optimal asset allocation strategy which optimises its retribution which is in fact a part of the surplus (the difference between the <b>pension</b> <b>fund</b> value and the guarantee) (2004) [19] and to analyse the effect of sharing between the contributor and the <b>pension</b> <b>fund.</b> From the <b>pension</b> <b>fund</b> members’ perspective it is to define a optimal guarantee as a solution to the contributor’s optimisation programme. In particular, we consider a case of a <b>pension</b> <b>fund</b> company which invests in a bond, stocks and a money market account. The uncertainty in the financial market is driven by Brownian motions. Numerical simulations were performed to compare the different models...|$|R
