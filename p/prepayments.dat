2500|$|A collateralized {{mortgage}} obligation, or [...] "pay-through bond", is a debt {{obligation of}} a legal entity that is collateralized by the assets it owns. Pay-through bonds are typically divided into classes that have different maturities and different priorities for the receipt of principal {{and in some cases}} of interest. They often contain a sequential pay security structure, with at least two classes of mortgage-backed securities issued, with one class receiving scheduled principal payments and <b>prepayments</b> before any other class. Pay-through securities are classified as debt for income tax purposes.|$|E

With all of the loans as adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), we find that 1) <b>Prepayment</b> speeds up and then slows down as the mortgage seasons; 2) <b>Prepayment</b> speeds up as the rate markup decreases; 3) <b>Prepayment</b> speeds up as the interest rate increases; 4) <b>Prepayment</b> speeds up when the profitability ratio of the banks (the prime-HIBOR spread) is higher; 5) <b>Prepayment</b> speeds up {{as the price of}} the property market falls; 6) <b>Prepayment</b> speed is faster for loans with a lower loan-tovalue ratio; 7) <b>Prepayment</b> exhibits a seasonal pattern: people tend to prepay in the summer.

2500|$|Theoretical pricing models {{must take}} into account the link between {{interest}} rates and loan prepayment speed. Mortgage <b>prepayments</b> are usually made because a home is sold or because the homeowner is refinancing to a new mortgage, presumably with a lower rate or shorter term. Prepayment is classified as a risk for the MBS investor {{despite the fact that they}} receive the money, because it tends to occur when floating rates drop and the fixed income of the bond would be more valuable (negative convexity). In other words, the proceeds received would need to be reinvested at a lower interest rate. Hence the term [...] prepayment risk.|$|E

50|$|NAS {{bonds are}} {{designed}} to protect investors from volatility and negative convexity resulting from <b>prepayments.</b> NAS tranches of bonds are fully protected from <b>prepayments</b> for a specified period, after which time <b>prepayments</b> are allocated to the tranche using a specified step down formula. For example, an NAS bond might be protected from <b>prepayments</b> for five years, and then would receive 10% of the <b>prepayments</b> for the first month, then 20%, and so on. Recently, issuers have added features to accelerate the proportion of <b>prepayments</b> flowing to the NAS class of bond {{in order to create}} shorter bonds and reduce extension risk.

40|$|Contact author. 1 Although {{extensive}} {{studies have}} been done to examine the <b>prepayment</b> of primary mortgages, not much has been done to analyze the <b>prepayment</b> of home equity loans. This paper studies the <b>prepayment</b> of fixed-rate home equity loans using a large loan-level sample for the period 1995 to 1998. We find that <b>prepayment</b> of home equity loans is sensitive to changes in market interest rates, indicating that borrowers refinance their loans when market interest rates are lower than coupon interest rates. We also find that trends in interest rate changes {{play an important role in}} borrower <b>prepayment</b> decisions. When borrowers expect market interest rates to decrease further, they will wait for better opportunities to prepay their home equity loans even when the loans are already “in the money. ” Loan size and borrower creditworthiness also affect the <b>prepayment</b> of home equity loans. However, the loan-to-value ratio, an important factor in primary mortgage <b>prepayment,</b> has little effect on the <b>prepayment</b> of home equity loans. This paper also documents the effect of payment delinquencies on <b>prepayment</b> behavior. Borrowers with either minor or major delinquencies in making monthly payments are less likely to prepay their home equity loans. ...|$|R

25|$|Unlike {{corporate}} bonds, most securitizations are amortized, {{meaning that}} the principal amount borrowed is paid back gradually over the specified term of the loan, rather than in one lump sum at the maturity of the loan. Fully amortizing securitizations are generally collateralised by fully amortizing assets, such as home equity loans, auto loans, and student loans. <b>Prepayment</b> uncertainty is an important concern with fully amortizing ABS. The possible rate of <b>prepayment</b> varies widely {{with the type of}} underlying asset pool, so many <b>prepayment</b> models have been developed to try to define common <b>prepayment</b> activity.

We also introduce a risk unique to each loan pool of mortgages, called a loan pool risk (LPR), and we regard LPR as a systematic risk other than interest rate. Using the model, we discuss the condi-tional distribution of <b>prepayment</b> times and a risk-neutral valuation of pass-through MBS.
