Currently the Scottish <b>powan,</b> along with the Welsh gwyniad known from a single lake, and four similar populations in England known as schelly, are generally considered belonging to the widespread Eurasian common whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus). This accords with the close genetic similarity among these units. The FishBase and IUCN however classify the Scottish <b>powan</b> as a distinct species, Coregonus clupeoides.|$|E

50|$|The <b>powan</b> (Coregonus clupeoides) {{is a kind}} of {{freshwater}} whitefish endemic to two lochs in Scotland, Loch Lomond and Loch Eck. It has been successfully introduced in two other sites, Loch Sloy and the Carron Valley Reservoir.|$|E
50|$|Loch Eck; (Gaelic: Loch Eich) is a {{freshwater}} loch {{located on}} the Cowal peninsula, north of Dunoon, Argyll and Bute, Scotland. It is seven miles long. Apart from Loch Lomond, {{it is the only}} naturally occurring habitat of the <b>Powan</b> (fish).|$|E

50|$|Ruffe {{were first}} {{discovered}} in Loch Lomond, Scotland, in 1982, probably having been introduced as live bait by pike anglers. It is now abundant throughout the Loch, concern was {{raised about the}} effect of the huge ruffe population on the endemic whitefish population known as <b>powan</b> Coregonus lavaretus as ruffe prey on their eggs. Ruffe became the principal food item for the three main fish predators found in the area, the great cormorant, grey heron and northern pike.|$|E
50|$|The Obra {{is also an}} {{important}} habitat for birds. There are over 150 species inhabiting the area. Some of the important birds found here are the sea eagle, osprey, golden eagle, common merganser, eagle owl, black stork, black woodpecker, and corn crake. Swamp turtles also live in Obra's waters. Over 40 species of mammals roam the area around the Obra, including beaver, river otter, deer, badgers, hare, and wild boar. Fish species found in Obra include catfish, river trout, grayling, lake trout, <b>powan,</b> barbel, and salmon.|$|E
50|$|In {{the broad}} sense, Coregonus lavaretus, {{referred}} to as the common whitefish or European whitefish, is widespread from central and northwest Europe to Siberia. Often called the C. lavaretus complex and considered as a superspecies, it encompasses many of the whitefish populations suggested by others to be locally restricted species (such as the British <b>powan</b> and the gwyniad or the Alpine gravenche, as well as distinct intralacustrine morphs and populations characterized by different feeding habits, gill raker numbers, growth patterns and migration behaviour. Genetic studies suggest that the whitefish diversity within this complex is mostly of post-glacial origin. The resource polymorphism represented by the feeding morphs has evolved repeatedly and independently within individual lakes, and similar morphs in different lakes are not related to each other.|$|E
50|$|Of the 42 {{species of}} fish found in Scottish fresh waters, only half have arrived by natural colonisation. Native species include allis shad, brown trout, European eel and river lamprey. Scottish rivers support {{one of the largest}} Atlantic salmon {{resources}} in Europe, with nearly 400 rivers supporting genetically distinct populations. Five fish species are considered 'late arrivals' to Scotland, having colonised by natural means prior to 1790. They are the northern pike, roach, stone loach, European perch, and minnow. Rarer native species include the endemic Salvelinus killinensis and the <b>powan,</b> the latter found in only two locations and under threat from introduced ruffe and the Arctic charr. The latter may have been the first fish species to re-enter fresh waters when the last ice age ended, and about 200 populations exist.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} is mainly a {{descriptive}} account {{of the food and}} feeding of the two Scottish <b>powan</b> populations from Loch Lomond and Loch Eck. Quantitative and qualitative comparisons of <b>powan</b> diet are made. Seasonal variations of diet are determined for the two populations and some aspects of the planktivorous feeding of adult pawan in Loch Lomond are examined. The partitioning of the ingested energy into somatic and non-somatic growth is considered. Factors affecting the feeding of the two populations are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Immunopathological and ultrastructural {{studies were}} carried out on the gut of 30 {{specimens}} of <b>powan</b> Coregonus lavaretus (L.) from Lake Piediluco, Italy. The digestive tracts of 10 (33. 3 %) of the <b>powan</b> were found to harbour an acanthocephalan Dentitruncus truttae (Sinzar 1955). The numerous trunk spines of D. truttae reduced the number of mucosal folds near the parasite site of infection. The acanthocephalan induced hyperplasia and hypertrophy of the intestinal mucous cells and many worms were surrounded with an adherent mucous gel. Near the site of acanthocephalan attachment, the number of mucous cells was significantly higher (P 0. 05). In infected intestine, mast cells were more abundant than in uninfected gut (P < 0. 01). Migration of the mast cells and their intense degranulation at the site of infection were suggested. Immunohistochemical tests applied to sections of intestinal tissue of both infected and uninfected <b>powan</b> revealed that the parasitized C. lavaretus had a larger number of mast cells positive for met-enkephalin and serotonin antisera...|$|E
40|$|The <b>powan,</b> Coregonus lavaretus (L.) is {{endemic to}} only two British waters, Loch Lomond and Loch Eck, Scotland. This thesis {{describes}} the seasonal and longer term growth {{processes of the}} two populations, concentrating on growth in length back-calculated from scales, factors affecting recruitment and mortality, reproductive cycles, and seasonal deposition and mobilisation of storage products, particularly lipid. The interrelationships of these cycles is discussed. The populations differ in their diet and duration of feeding, and it is shown {{that most of the}} inter-population differences in seasonal cycles of growth relate to these feeding differences. The Loch Eck population is the more variable. In addition to adult and immature <b>powan,</b> a third category is identified, termed adolescents. These are fish which are entering their first reproductive cycle. Immature and adolescent fish are analysed separately and compared with the adults. There are some differences in seasonal cycles between the juveniles and adults, mainly in relation to {{the presence or absence of}} the reproductive cycle. A preliminary histological study of the ovaries of adolescent females is carried out. Comparison of historical data with the results of the present study shows that there has been little change in the Loch Lomond <b>powan</b> in the past 200 years. Both lochs are coming under increasing human pressure, and conservational measures urgently need to be taken if the <b>powan</b> populations are to survive...|$|E
40|$|Histopathological, ultrastructural and {{immunohistochemical}} investigations {{were conducted}} on 26 specimens of <b>powan</b> Coregonus lavaretus (L.) from Loch Lomond (Scotland). The hearts of all 26 <b>powan</b> (15 females and 11 males) investigated harboured metacercariae of the digenean trematode Ichthyocotylurus erraticus (Rudolphi, 1809). The vast majority of metacercariae were located either singly or as an aggregation of white cysts {{on the surface of}} the bulbus arteriosus. The intensity of infection ranged from 2 to 200 larvae heart– 1, although the number of metacercariae found on male <b>powan</b> did not exceed 13. Histochemically, the parasite cyst wall gave a strong positive reaction with periodic acid schiff (PAS) and a faint positive signal with Azan-Mallory stain. All the metacercariae cysts were embedded in a granulomatous proliferation of heart epicardium tissue, forming a reactive fibroconnective capsule around the parasite. The capsule enclosing the parasite (produced by the host’s reaction to the parasite) measured 13. 57 to 90. 20 µm (37. 43 ± 3. 56) in thickness. Within the capsule wall, eosinophilic granular cells (EGCs), granulocytes, melanocytes and, in some instances, partially degenerated or vacuolated epithelioid cells were observed in close proximity to the cyst wall. Pigment-bearing macrophages were scattered throughout the granulomatous host-tissue reaction and as macrophage aggregates (MAs) within the capsules surrounding parasites. Immunohistochemical tests were applied to infected heart sections using 12 different antisera. Nerve fibres immunoreactive to bombesin, substance P (SP), and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) antisera were observed in close proximity to the parasite larvae. The presence of a serotonin-like substance was also observed within host immune-cells surrounding trematode cysts. Large cells of the epicardium were found to be immunoreactive to met-enkephalin and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) antisera but not immunoreactive to anti-protein gene-product 9. 5 (PGP 9. 5) sera.

30|$|A higher lipid {{content was}} {{observed}} in female bodies compared to males (Table  2). This is in agreement with positive correlations of concurrent increases in the lipid content with fish size (Salam et al. 2001) and the lipid content with CF (Yousaf et al. 2011). A higher lipid content {{in the body of}} females might play a major role as a source of metabolic energy for growth and reproduction (Tocher 2003). This result is in general agreement with the effect of sex on body compositions reported in <b>powan</b> (Dörücü 2000), Russian sturgeon Acipenser gueldenstaedtii (Memid et al. 2006), Australian red claw crayfish (Thompson et al. 2006), and freshwater catfish Wallago attu (Yousaf et al. 2011).|$|E
40|$|The use of {{translocation}} {{of animals}} to an ecosystem {{to which they}} are not native as a conservation strategy is controversial, but may be the only choice where in situ intervention is not possible. This strategy has been used to establish conservation refuge site populations for three important species of rare freshwater fishes in Scotland. Eleven translocations have been initiated over the last four decades in Scotland, five of these have resulted in the successful establishment of conservation refuges populations of Arctic charr, <b>powan</b> and vendace. The outcome of the remaining six is not yet certain. The approach taken has enabled the protection of, not only important species, but also of the considerable and discrete between-population diversity in phenotype and genotype that is found in these species...|$|E
40|$|There {{have been}} {{numerous}} studies in which the reproductive cycles of teleosts have been correlated with either environmental cycles or associated physiological cycles, or both. Such correlation is seldom accurately achieved; usually because the reproductive cycle of the species concerned is lax, sometimes because {{only one or two}} factors of an integrated whole were examined. The <b>powan</b> of Loch Lomond, Coregonus lavaretus (L.) (Teleostei, Salmoniformes) {{is the subject of a}} long-term study investigating its growth, in particular reproduction. This race is a freshwater glacial relict form of a boreal group, and thus has an exceptionally strictly times reproductive cycle. It thus represents an ideal subject for cyclical studies. This thesis investigates the relationship between lipid storage and the reproductive cycle and the role of thyroid gland...|$|E
40|$|The {{pathological}} changes {{induced by}} an infection of Diphyllobothrium dendriticum (Nitzsch, 1824) plerocercoids in <b>powan,</b> Coregonus lavaretus (L.), from Loch Lomond, Scotland were assessed using {{a range of}} immunohistochemical and ultrastructural techniques. From a sample of 36 <b>powan,</b> the occurrence of encysted plerocercoids of D. dendriticum on the outer surface of the stomach was 38. 5 % (n= 10) {{with the number of}} cysts ranging from 4 to 15 in number and measuring 4. 2 ± 1. 0 mm × 3. 4 ± 0. 9 mm in dimensions (mean ± SD). Histological examination of intestinal samples also revealed the presence of plerocercoids (2 - 21) encapsulated within a proliferation of mesenteric fibrous tissues of the gastric wall and, occasionally, by the gut lamina propria-submucosa and lamina muscularis. In section, cysts were tri-layered and were formed from a series of concentric whorls of fibroblast and collagen fibre-based connective elements. The extent of necrosis within each of the muscle layers and the serosa of the stomach was found to differ, notably within the latter which was marked by a chronic inflammatory reaction and fibrosis. Within the body of the cyst and in the vicinity around it, a high number of mast cell / eosinophilic granule cells (EGCs) in a state of degranulation were seen, in addition to melano-macrophages centres (MMC). Immunohistochemical staining of histological sections of infected stomach material revealed a high density of elements, in close proximity to plerocercoids, staining positive for serotonin (5 -HT), bombesin, substance P (SP) and galanin. Uninfected material did not present the same levels of activity. Sections through both infected and uninfected tissue were also tested for the presence of elements containing vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), met-enkephalin, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), neuropeptide Y (NPY) and nitric oxide synthase (NOS), but were found to be absent...|$|E
30|$|Different growth {{categories}} of guppies influenced by sex {{were reported by}} Nakajima and Taniguchi (2002). Moreover, those of other aquatic species, such as the Australian red claw crayfish Cherax quadricarinatus (Thompson et al. 2006) and Siamese fighting fish (Thongprajukaew et al. 2013), were also observed. Generally, in nature, this phenomenon occurs in many animal species in which morphometric differences are important for sexual attraction. However, differences in weight and length between sexes were not observed, such as in <b>powan</b> Coregonus lavaretus (Dörücü 2000) and Opsariichthys bidens (Sui et al. 2012). An increased digestive organ weight was reported to play a potent role in increasing growth (Thongprajukaew et al. 2011). This might illustrate higher efficiencies of the gastrointestinal system for digestion, absorption, and utilization of nutrients in females than in males.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} provide an {{accurate}} basis for the correlation of endocrine changes and phases of the reproductive (and associated) cycles in the <b>powan</b> of Loch Lomond, 'Coregonus- lavaretus (L.), the following experiments were carried out, Cell types in the pituitary were identified using light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. To locate gonadotropic cells an immunofluorescence technique was employed using antibody prepared in rabbit and an immunodiffusion method to detect the presence of antibody in the rabbit serum. In order to purify pituitary gonadotropin, two purification techniques 'were used. One was alcoholic extraction followed by gel filtration on sephadex; the other was buffer extraction followed by affinity chromatography on Concanavalin A-sepharose. To characterise the fractions from columns, two in vitro bioassays were employed; (i) ovulation of the oocytes of medaka (Oryzias latipes); (ii) Cyclic AMP production in immature trout gonads. The concentration of pituitary gonadotropins was measured using a heterologous radioimmunoassay technique. Using a radioimmunoassay technique, the serum testosterone and oestradiol- 17 β concentrations were determined. Serum proteins were characterised using SDS gel electrophoresis...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} the diet of otters Lutra lutra was {{examined}} following {{the establishment of}} a population of non-native ruffe Gymnocephalus cernuus in Loch Lomond, Scotland. Otter spraints (n= 453) were collected at monthly intervals from four sites during 2002. Overall, 98 % of spraints contained at least one species of fish, invertebrates were found in 49 %, 17 % contained amphibians, while mammals and birds were found in 9 %. The most frequent prey from all sites were ruffe, which were found in 69 % of spraints. Eel Anguilla anguilla, cyprinids (roach Rutilus rutilus, dace Leuciscus leuciscus and minnow Phoxinus phoxinus) and Salmo spp. were also relatively common and were recovered in 60 %, 35 % and 33 % of spraints, respectively. Northern pike Esox lucius (14 %), perch Perca fluviatilis (12 %), stickleback Gasterosteus aculeatus (9 %), <b>powan</b> Coregonus lavaretus (14 %) and lampreys Lampetra spp. (2 %) were less common. The fact that ruffe were the most frequent prey in otter spraints in all regions and in all seasons of the year indicated that they {{are one of the most}} important prey for otters in Loch Lomond at the present time...|$|E
40|$|STUDY OF THE DISTRIBUTIONAND PISCICULTURAL ROLEOF CERTAIN FRESH-WATER COPEPODAAND CLADOCERA - I. — In {{the lakes}} of the Haute-Savoie and the Jura, as wellas in the ponds of the Bresse, the Côte-d'Or, and Lorraine, acertain {{number of species}} of Copepoda (excluding the group ofthe Harpacticoïda {{which has not been}} studied) and of Cladocerahave been discovered. In the lake of Montriond (Haute-Savoie) the {{quantitative}} variations, the temperature, and theoxygen have been susceptible of examination at the same timein the course of a year. II. — The discovery of the piscicultural function of thesespecies was then attempted by the examination of the stomachiccontents of 178 fish from the Lake of Geneva : bleak, roach,trout, char, <b>powan,</b> perch, and burbot. Sida crystallina (O. F. MÜLLER) plays an important part in the food of the perch, thechar, and the <b>powan.</b> Daphnia iongispina (O. F. MÜLLER),Bythotrephes iongimanus (F. LEYDIG), Leptodora Kindtii (F 0 CKE) are appreciated by the majority of the species. The bleakshows a predilection for Chydorus sphcericus (O. F. MÜLLER) and Acroperus harpce (BAIRD) (Chydoridae) while Simocephalusvetulus (O. F. MÜLLER) (Daphnida) a littoral species, has neverbeen found in this fish. The bleak has a special relish forMacrocyclops gigas (CLAUS), a deep-water species. In the stomach of a fish, a varied diet is not found but oftena single species represented by a large number of individuals. Must it be admitted that all these Entomostraca, certain ofwhich are however rare in the fisheries, live in compact swarms,or on the other hand that the fish chooses its food with extremecare ? 1) VANDEL had noticed that with a normal net he did notcatch any Bythotrephes longimanus in Saint-Point lake (Jura),while with a net presenting a wide opening he had capturedas many as forty of them in vertical fishing. 2) In a series of experiments some fry bred from a pelagicfish, the char, have been fed either with the lacustral animalculesof the Leman or with the animalcules of ponds : the fish havedisplayed indifference. The question of the choice of the species is therefore not yetsolved : it is not absolutely certain that the Entomostracadescribed as rare are so in fact, and a VANDEL remarks, thefood requirements of certain fish are still unknown. III. — In a systematic study of the function and the distributionof each of the species found, certain structural anomaliesof slight importance have been described (plate outside thetext). Cyclops strenuus (FISCHER) and Cyclops furcifer (CLAUS) recently separated are rather badly characterized. On theother hand Megacyclops gigas (CLAUS) and Megacyclops viridis(JURINE) recently distinguished by Roy (1932) are always welldefined...|$|E
40|$|Many Salmo trutta populations {{consist of}} non-{{anadromous}} (freshwater-resident) brown trout and anadromous (sea-run migratory) sea trout. Although adult brown trout and sea trout {{can usually be}} identified using differences in size and body colouration, {{it is not possible}} to easily identify eggs/alevins as the progeny of brown trout or sea trout. In this study we show that delta(13) C and delta(15) N, measured using a continuous how isotope ratio mass spectrometer (CF-IRMS), can accurately identify fish eggs as the progeny of freshwater-resident (delta(13) C(egg) = - 25. 7 +/- 1. 9 parts per thousand, delta(15) N(egg) = 9. 2 +/- 1. 8 parts per thousand) or migratory (delta(13) C(egg) = - 19. 9 +/- 1. 1 parts per thousand, delta(15) N(egg) = 14. 3 +/- 1. 5 parts per thousand) adult female Salmo trutta, Case studies show that stable isotope analysis is a more reliable technique for distinguishing anadromous adult fish than differentiation using morphological characteristics. For example, stable isotope analysis of brown trout from Loch Eck, Scotland, revealed that some individuals possessed delta(13) C and delta(15) N signatures indicative of marine feeding despite visual identification as freshwater-resident fish, It is most likely that these fish are misidentified sea trout although it possible that these fish mag be brown trout that have adopted an estuarine feeding strategy to avoid interspecific competition for food within Loch Eck with salmon, <b>powan</b> and Arctic charr. Most stable isotope studies of fish ecology use terminal tissue sampling to provide sufficient biological material for isotopic analysis; however, our study suggests that adipose fin tissue could provide a comparable measure of delta(13) C and delta(15) N. Such a strategy would be invaluable when studying the trophic ecology or migration patterns of fish of high conservation value...|$|E
40|$|The {{stability}} of a discrete body size dimorphism of sexually mature river lamprey Lampetra fluviatilis from the River Endrick, Scotland, was examined over a 21 year period. Stable isotope {{analysis was used}} to test the hypothesis that the two size forms comprise individuals with differing migration and parasitic foraging strategies. Maturing river lamprey and the brook lamprey Lampetra planeri were trapped over 3 months each year in the periods 1983 – 1984 and 2004 – 2005. Brook lamprey catches and catches of both species combined showed no significant trend in catch rate with time. The catch rate of small body size river lamprey declined between 1983 – 1984 and 2004 – 2005 (although the difference did not reach statistical significance; P = 0 · 055). In contrast, there was {{a significant increase in the}} catch rate of the large body size river lamprey and as a consequence, a significant change in the relative proportion of each of the two river lamprey morphs over the study period. Analysis of the stable isotopes of C and N in muscle tissue showed that brook lamprey tissue derived its carbon from a freshwater source and had a δ 13 C more consistent with that of the River Endrick than with Loch Lomond. δ 15 N values for this species showed it to be feeding at the base of the food chain, consistent with filter feeding as an ammocoete. The large body size and the small body size river lamprey adults differed substantially in their δ 13 C values, with the small body size δ 13 C signature indicative of a freshwater carbon source and the large body size morph of a marine source. The small body size morph had a δ 13 C signature that was consistent with that of Loch Lomond <b>powan</b> Coregonus lavaretus suggesting that they share a common carbon source. The large body size morph was clearly feeding at a higher trophic level than the small body size morph. A single small body size river lamprey individual with typical morphology for that group, however, had C and N signatures that clustered with those of the large body size morphs. This individual had either migrated to sea to forage, as is typical for the species, or had been feeding on an anadromous fish with a strong marine C signature in fresh water. It is concluded that the body size dimorphism is indicative of a differential migration and foraging strategy in the parasitic phase of the life cycle of river lamprey at this site...|$|E
