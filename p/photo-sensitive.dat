2500|$|According to T. O'Conor Sloane, Abbott {{was head}} of the Engineer School of Application, Fort Totten (Queens), New York, when he {{produced}} photographs depicting the sensitivity of photo-gelatine plates. [...] Abbott gave military command to his military class to use a mule in an unethical photographic experiment. A cotton bag with six ounces of dynamite was fastened {{to the head of the}} mule. The slide camera was supported by a fuse and the dynamite was connect to the same electrical circuit. The class pressed a key to send electricity through both wires. The <b>photo-sensitive</b> plate captured a photograph of the instant death of the mule.|$|E
2500|$|Areas {{that should}} not be {{soldered}} may be covered with solder resist (solder mask). One of the most common solder resists used today is called [...] "LPI" [...] (liquid photoimageable solder mask). A <b>photo-sensitive</b> coating is applied {{to the surface of the}} PWB, then exposed to light through the solder mask image film, and finally developed where the unexposed areas are washed away. [...] Dry film solder mask is similar to the dry film used to image the PWB for plating or etching. [...] After being laminated to the PWB surface it is imaged and develop as LPI. [...] Once common but no longer commonly used because of its low accuracy and resolution is to screen print epoxy ink. Solder resist also provides protection from the environment.|$|E
2500|$|Early seismometers had an {{arrangement}} of levers on jeweled bearings, to scratch smoked glass or paper. [...] Later, mirrors reflected a light beam to a direct-recording plate or roll of photographic paper. [...] Briefly, some designs returned to mechanical movements to save money. [...] In mid-twentieth-century systems, the light was reflected {{to a pair of}} differential electronic photosensors called a photomultiplier. [...] The voltage generated in the photomultiplier was used to drive galvanometers which had a small mirror mounted on the axis. [...] The moving reflected light beam would strike the surface of the turning drum, which was covered with <b>photo-sensitive</b> paper. [...] The expense of developing photo sensitive paper caused many seismic observatories to switch to ink or thermal-sensitive paper.|$|E
2500|$|A {{computer}} {{graphic representation}} of the projected teeth movements, [...] created in the software program ClinCheck, is provided {{to the doctor and}} patient [...] for approval or modification before aligners are manufactured. The aligners are modeled using CAD-CAM (computer-aided-design and computer-aided-manufacturing) software and manufactured using a rapid prototyping technique called stereolithography. The molds for the aligners are built in layers using a <b>photo-sensitive</b> liquid resin that cures into a hard plastic when exposed to a laser. The aligners are made from an elastic thermoplastic material that applies pressure to the teeth to move into the aligner's position. Patients that need a tooth rotated or pulled down may have a small, tooth-colored composite attachment bonded onto certain teeth. More attachments can make the aligners less aesthetically pleasing. Reproximation, (also called interproximal reduction or IPR and colloquially, filing or drilling), is sometimes used at the contacts between teeth to allow for a better fit.|$|E

50|$|Optoelectrowetting {{can also}} be {{achieved}} using the photocapacitance in a liquid-insulator-semiconductor junction. The <b>photo-sensitive</b> electrowetting is achieved via optical modulation of carriers in the space charge region at the insulator-semiconductor junction which acts as a photodiode - similar to a charge-coupled device based on a metal-oxide-semiconductor.|$|E
50|$|Many SSRs use optical coupling. The {{control voltage}} energizes an {{internal}} LED which illuminates and switches on a <b>photo-sensitive</b> diode (photo-voltaic); the diode current {{turns on a}} back-to-back thyristor, SCR, or MOSFET to switch the load. The optical coupling allows the control circuit to be electrically isolated from the load.|$|E
5000|$|The image {{dissector}} has no [...] "charge storage" [...] characteristic; {{the vast majority}} of electrons emitted by the photocathode are excluded by the scanning aperture, and thus wasted rather than being stored on a <b>photo-sensitive</b> target, as in the iconoscope or image orthicon (see below), which largely accounts for its low light sensitivity.|$|E
5000|$|The term [...] "emulsion" [...] is {{also used}} to refer to the <b>photo-sensitive</b> side of {{photographic}} film. Such a photographic emulsion consist of silver halide colloidal particles dispersed in a gelatin matrix. Nuclear emulsions are similar to photographic emulsions, except that they are used in particle physics to detect high-energy elementary particles.|$|E
50|$|IGZO's {{advantage}} over zinc oxide {{is that it}} can be deposited as a uniform amorphous phase while retaining the high carrier mobility common to oxide semiconductors. The transistors are slightly <b>photo-sensitive,</b> but the effect becomes significant only in the deep violet to ultra-violet (photon energy above 3 eV) range, offering the possibility of a fully transparent transistor.|$|E
50|$|Carotenoderma is {{deliberately}} caused by beta-carotenoid treatment of certain <b>photo-sensitive</b> dermatitis {{diseases such as}} erythropoietic protoporphyria, where beta carotene is prescribed in quantities which discolor the skin. These high doses of beta carotene {{have been found to}} be harmless in studies, though cosmetically displeasing to some. In a recent meta analysis of these treatments, however, the effectiveness of the treatment has been called into question.|$|E
50|$|Most of the inventions {{that led}} to optical sound-on-film {{technology}} employed {{the use of an}} electric lamp, called an exciter, shining through a translucent waveform printed {{on the edge of a}} film strip. When the light shines through the film, it is read by a <b>photo-sensitive</b> material and fed through a processor that converts the photovoltaic impulse into an electrical signal that is then amplified and converted into analogue sound waves through a speaker.|$|E
50|$|Ways {{to measure}} {{component}} positions within an electromagnetic system, {{such as a}} brushless direct current motor, include (I.) the Hall Effect, (II.) light detection with a light-dark position encoder such as a Gray code disk and (III.) induced voltage by moving the amount of metal core inserted into a transformer. When Hall is compared to <b>photo-sensitive</b> methods, {{it is harder to}} get absolute position with Hall. Hall detection is also sensitive to stray magnetic fields.|$|E
50|$|Colored {{light has}} been used to treat or {{ameliorate}} a number of medical conditions, not all of them directly related to vision, such as: age-related macular degeneration, autism, blepharospasm, color blindness, dyskinesia, dyslexia, migraine, and <b>photo-sensitive</b> epilepsy. BPI has a line of therapeutic dyes to match the needs of researchers and practitioners dealing with these conditions. The company maintains a website that links medical conditions to articles that suggest a benefit from the use of specially tinted lenses.|$|E
50|$|As the ink is <b>photo-sensitive,</b> {{it needs}} to be {{protected}} from exposure to direct sun rays. Therefore, amber-coloured plastic containers are used for storing the ink, which in earlier times was stored in brown-coloured glass bottles. On application, the ink remains on the fingernail for at least two days, to even up to a month depending upon the person's body temperature and the environment. The ink contains silver nitrate, which on exposure to UV light gets darker.|$|E
50|$|Wolcott's {{patented}} camera used {{a polished}} concave mirror {{to reflect the}} focused light onto a photosensitive plate that {{was less than a}} half inch square. The pictures were not a negative image of reverse colors, but a correct positive image that did not require reversion of the image. The size of the <b>photo-sensitive</b> plate was eventually increased to just over two square inches that they could make a likeness image, because of their refined mechanical lighting techniques.|$|E
50|$|If the {{measurement}} is adjusted to account only for light that reacts with the <b>photo-sensitive</b> surface, that is, weighted by the appropriate spectral sensitivity, the exposure is still measured in radiometric units (joules per square meter), rather than photometric units (weighted by the nominal {{sensitivity of the}} human eye). Only in this appropriately weighted case does the H measure the effective amount of light falling on the film, such that the characteristic curve will be correct independent of the spectrum of the light.|$|E
50|$|For his 2009 series Lightning Fields Sugimoto {{abandoned}} {{the use of}} the camera, producing photographs using a400,000 volt Van de Graaff generator to apply an electrical charge directly onto the film. Instead of placing an object on <b>photo-sensitive</b> paper, then exposing it to light, he produced the image by causing electrical sparks to erupt over the on surface of a 7-by-2.5-foot sheet of film laid on a large metal tabletop. The highly detailed results combine bristling textures and branching sparks into highly evocative images.|$|E
5000|$|Most {{films are}} shot double-system: The picture is shot on film, while {{the sound is}} {{recorded}} separately. For convenience during the editing process, the sound is transferred to a magnetic track ("mag") [...] - [...] sprocketed recording film, which is filmstock coated with magnetic oxide, instead of <b>photo-sensitive</b> emulsion. One [...] "frame" [...] on the magnetic film equals one frame of picture. The magnetic film is usually edge-coded: sequential numbers are stamped on the edge every few frames to facilitate locating particular frames or scenes.|$|E
5000|$|Wolcott and Johnson {{continued}} {{to improve their}} photography techniques as time went on. Wolcott improved his <b>photo-sensitive</b> plate {{and came up with}} a chemical [...] "accelerator" [...] that was a mix of bromide and chloride. This along with improved polished silver plates earned them a second U.S. patent in photography in December 1841, designated #2,391. They also came up with new innovative studio lighting by designing special outdoor mirrors that provided more light to the inside studio itself for faster better quality portrait pictures.|$|E
50|$|The {{completed}} mask with opened exposure windows is {{then placed}} atop a <b>photo-sensitive</b> printing plate, which both plate and mask with stripped negatives fixed by register pins, and then vacuum-sealed in a framed enclosure under glass and exposed to very bright light, allowing the rays {{to pass through}} the negatives and expose the printing plate's surface. The plate is then developed and the unexposed areas are washed away, leaving behind cured emulsion that will hold the ink on press. A single etched plate is necessary for each color to be printed.|$|E
50|$|Francis Galton, from Birmingham, was an {{important}} eugenicist from the Darwin-Wedgwood family; {{a person who had}} such a profound international impact on the science of breeding and heredity, yet never had any children himself. He invented the term eugenics and the phrase nature versus nurture. He did research from the breeding records of the Basset Hound Club and the hounds of Sir Everett Millais, and his work directly led to the German Society for Racial Hygiene in 1905 founded by Alfred Ploetz. Thomas Wedgwood, son of Josiah Wedgwood, discovered the first <b>photo-sensitive</b> (light-sensitive) chemicals - silver nitrate and silver chloride in the 1790s.|$|E
50|$|Another {{example of}} the {{development}} of the Micromegas detectors is the invention of the “bulk” technology. The “bulk” technology consists of the integration of the micro-mesh with the printed circuit board (that carries the readout electrodes) in order to build a monolithic detector. Such a detector is very robust and can be produced within an industrial process (a successful try has been conducted with the 3M firm in 2006) allowing public applications. For instance, by modifying the micro-mesh {{in order to make it}} <b>photo-sensitive</b> to UV light, the Micromegas can be used to prevent forest fires.|$|E
5000|$|Following the {{purchase}} of his first computer, a Motorola D-1, in 1976, White refocused his attention on the emerging field of robotics, and during the mid- to late-1970s began making interactive machines whose internal logic expressed itself primarily through motion. [...] "Menage" [...] (1974) was White's first robotic work, and again demonstrated his interest in exploring complex behaviours generated from simple principles. Four robots mounted upon ceiling tracks were fitted with <b>photo-sensitive</b> scanners and programmed to recognize and react to light sources mounted on the other robots. The machines competed for one another's attention as they moved automatically along the overhead tracks.|$|E

50|$|Light {{sensitive}} polymer plates {{allow for}} photorealistic etchings. A <b>photo-sensitive</b> coating {{is applied to}} the plate by either the plate supplier or the artist. Light is projected onto the plate as a negative image to expose it. Photopolymer plates are either washed in hot water or under other chemicals according to the plate manufacturers' instructions. Areas of the photo-etch image may be stopped-out before etching to exclude them from the final image on the plate, or removed or lightened by scraping and burnishing once the plate has been etched. Once the photo-etching process is complete, the plate can be worked further as a normal intaglio plate, using drypoint, further etching, engraving, etc. The final result is an intaglio plate which is printed like any other.|$|E

50|$|The {{green sea}} urchin is often found {{with pieces of}} algae, bits of {{seagrass}} and fragments of mollusc shell on its aboral (upper) surface, holding them in place with its tube feet. It is thought that the urchin is <b>photo-sensitive</b> and that these pieces of debris may provide some protection from strong sunlight and ultraviolet light in the clear shallow waters it favours.While subsequent research confirmed that a different species, L. pictus (= L. anamesus), submerged in 20-cm deep aquaria responded negatively to sunlight and UV light and succumbed following extended exposure to UV light. However, studies in wave tanks with or without light showed they masked with shell material and aggregated in groups when exposed to surge activity. Masked and/or aggregated urchins were able to remain stable on the sand whereas unmasked individuals rolled around helplessly on the sand.|$|E
