40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2013 Almost {{one-third of}} U. S. adults ages 20 and over have hypertension, a {{major risk factor}} for heart disease and stroke. Regular blood {{pressure}} screenings and subsequent treatment can significantly reduce morbidity and mortality. In response to this health concern, researchers have developed interventions to motivate at-risk individuals to pursue a blood <b>pressure</b> <b>check.</b> It is important to assess these interventions for effectiveness. This study's objective was to examine one such intervention: a direct-mailing campaign in King County, Washington. Specifically, this research investigated the relationship between health communication processing variables and a subsequent blood <b>pressure</b> <b>check,</b> and whether individualizing the message was effective in motivating behavior change. This study also assessed whether certain demographic characteristics influenced the likelihood for individuals to report a blood <b>pressure</b> <b>check</b> after receiving the mailing. Data was used from a randomized control intervention that utilized a 2 x 2 design, manipulating personal risk information and source personalization. Participants of this intervention resided in one of four fire districts in King County, Washington, and were eligible for the study {{if they had a}} systolic blood pressure ≥ 160 mmHg and/or a diastolic blood pressure ≥ 100 mmHg, as reported by emergency medical technicians (EMTs) during a 911 visit between July 2007 and September 2009. Statistical analyses, including descriptive, bivariate, and logistic regression, were conducted to measure the participants' likelihood of reporting a blood <b>pressure</b> <b>check</b> subsequent to receiving a brochure. Results from bi-variate analyses indicated that some information processes, including how much the participant liked the mailing and how useful he or she found the mailing, were associated with reporting a repeat blood <b>pressure</b> <b>check.</b> Older age, insurance status, and prior history of hypertension were also positively associated with the outcome variable, providing evidence that direct-mailing interventions can be more effective for certain demographics than others...|$|E

40|$|BackgroundAn early {{provision}} of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) eliminated cost-sharing {{for a range of}} recommended preventive services. This provision took effect in September 2010, but little is known about its effect on preventive service use. MethodsWe evaluated changes in the use of recommended preventive services from 2009 (before the implementation of ACA cost-sharing provision) to 2011 / 2012 (after the implementation) in the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, a nationally representative household interview survey in the US. Specifically, we examined: blood <b>pressure</b> <b>check,</b> cholesterol check, flu vaccination, and cervical, breast, and colorectal cancer screening, controlling for demographic characteristics and stratifying by insurance type. ResultsThere were 64, 280 (21, 310 before and 42, 970 after the implementation of ACA cost-sharing provision) adults included in the analyses. Receipt of recent blood <b>pressure</b> <b>check,</b> cholesterol check and flu vaccination increased significantly from 2009 to 2011 / 2012, primarily in the privately insured population aged 1822 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 c 64 years, with adjusted prevalence ratios (95...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the {{prevalence}} of high risk health behaviours among adult Jamaicans aged 15 – 49 years in 2000, and to compare the results with the 1993 survey. A nationally representative sample of 2013 persons aged 15 – 74 years was surveyed in 2000 using cluster sampling in the Jamaica Healthy Lifestyle Survey (Wilks et al, unpublished). Interviewer administered questionnaires and anthropometrical measurements were done. Data for a sub-sample of adults aged 15 – 49 years were analyzed. The sub-sample included 1401 persons (473 men and 928 women). Significantly more men (18. 6 %) than women (4. 3 %) reported never having had a blood <b>pressure</b> <b>check</b> (p = 0. 0001). Approximately one-third of the women reported that they had never had a Pap smear (36. 0 %) or a breast examination (31. 2 %). Current cigarette smoking was reported in 28. 6 % of men and 7. 7 % of women (OR 3. 73 CI 2. 71, 5. 15), while 49. 0 % of men and 15. 0 % of women ever smoked marijuana (OR 3. 28 CI 2. 56, 4. 20). Significantly more men (28. 0 %) than women (11. 7 %) reported ever having a sexually transmitted disease (OR 2. 93 CI 2. 16, 3. 97); having more than one sexual partner in the past year (49. 1 % vs 11. 4 %, OR 4. 31 CI 3. 22, 5. 76) and usually using a condom during sexual intercourse (55. 3 % vs 40. 5 %, OR 1. 3 CI 1. 11, 1. 68). Between 1993 and 2000, significant trends include: more persons reported having a blood <b>pressure</b> <b>check,</b> a reduction in multiple sexual partners, increased condom use at last sex (women), reduced crack/cocaine use (males) and increased marijuana smoking. Although there were some significant positive lifestyle trends between 1993 and 2000, high risk behaviours remain common among Jamaican adults.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{investigated}} the causal effect of having a usual source of medical care on the timing of preventive services by women and children. METHODS: Data on 17, 110 children and 23, 488 women from the 1988 and 1990 National Health Interview Surveys were used to estimate ordered probit models {{of the effect of}} having a usual source of medical care on the time since the last receipt of each preventive service (routine checkups for children; blood <b>pressure</b> <b>checks,</b> Pap smears, and breast exams for adult women; mammograms for older women). Two-stage instrumental variables methods were used to eliminate simultaneity bias. RESULTS: The existence of a usual source of medical care was strongly correlated with the earlier receipt of preventive services, and the relationship appears to be causal for Pap smears, breast exams, and mammograms. However, there was little evidence that having a regular provider caused an increased rate of routine checkups for children or blood <b>pressure</b> <b>checks</b> for adult women. CONCLUSIONS: Delivery systems that encourage the development of long-term relationships with medical providers may increase cancer screening rates among women...|$|R

40|$|This study {{analysed}} the {{determinants of}} screening uptake for blood pressure and cholesterol level checks. Furthermore, it investigated the presence of possible spillover effects from one type of cardiovascular screening to another type of cardiovascular screening. A dynamic random effects bivariate panel probit model with initial conditions (Wooldridge-type estimator) was adopted for the estimation. The outcome variables were the participation in blood pressure and cholesterol level checks by individuals in a given year. The balanced panel sample of 21, 138 observations was constructed from 1, 626 individuals from the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS) between 1996 and 2008. The analysis showed the significance of past screening behaviour for both cardiovascular screening examinations. For both cardiovascular screening examinations state dependence exist. The study also shows a significant spillover effect of the cholesterol level check on the blood <b>pressure</b> <b>check</b> and vice versa. Also a poorer health status led to a higher uptake for both types of screening examinations.

40|$|OBJECTIVE — To {{evaluate}} {{health care}} access and utilization and health status and outcomes for {{type 2 diabetic}} patients according to race and ethnicity and to determine whether health status is influenced by health care access and utilization. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — National samples of Caucasians, African-Americans, and Mexican-Americans were studied in the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Information on medical history and treatment of diabetes, health care access and utilization, and health status and outcomes was obtained by structured questionnaires and by clinical and laboratory assessments. RESULTS — Almost all patients in each race and ethnic group had one primary source of ambulatory medical care (92 – 97 %), saw one physician at this source (83 – 92 %), and had at least semiannual physician visits (83 – 90 %). Almost all patients $ 65 years of age had health insurance (99 – 100 %), and for those patients, 65 years of age, Caucasians (91 %) and African-Americans (89 %) had higher rates of coverage than Mexican-Americans (66 %).

40|$|Introduction Ipilimumab (Yervoy®) {{is a human}} {{monoclonal}} antibody that {{has been shown to}} significantly improve survival in cases of metastatic melanoma. 1 Ipilimumab blocks cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA- 4), a protein receptor on the surface of T-cells, resulting in their activation, proliferation and an anti-tumor response. 2, 3, 4 Commonly reported immune-related side effects of ipilimumab are enterocolitis, dermatitis, and hepatitis. 5, 6, 7 However, different endocrinopathies, including autoimmune hypopituitarism, have become emerging clinical entities in patients taking ipilimumab. We present a case of ipilimumab induced hypophysitis in a 62 -yearold male presenting with fatigue and hypotension. Case Presentation A 62 -year-old male with a history of melanoma metastatic to the lung and brain status-post frontal craniotomy and whole brain radiation, as well as a recent diagnosis of hypothyroidism, presented from the oncology office with hypotension after receiving his fourth dose of ipilimumab therapy.

40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} whether permanent and transitory income effects mask {{the impact of}} unobservable factors on the uptake of health check-ups in Britain. Methods: We used a secondary data representative of the British population, the British Household Panel Survey. Outcome variables included uptake of dental health check-ups, eyesight tests, blood <b>pressure</b> <b>checks,</b> cholesterol tests, mammograms and cervical smear tests. Transitory income was measured as monthly household income and permanent income as average income over 13 years. Estimation method applied dynamic random effect probit model. Results: Results showed the absence of permanent and transitory effects on the uptake of eyesight tests, cholesterol tests, mammograms and cervical smear tests. Permanent income was associated with dental check-ups and transitory income with uptake of blood pressure tests. Conclusions: The presence of income effects on the uptake of blood <b>pressure</b> <b>checks</b> {{may be due to}} factors associated with income, such as stress or lifestyles, rather than income per se.

RESEARCH DESIGN ANDMETHODS — Secondary analyses of data from 6, 562 dia-betic individuals aged 18 years from the nationally representative Medical Expenditure Panel Survey from 2002 to 2005 were performed. Outcome measures included receipt of seven diabetic services plus five barriers to care. RESULTS — More than 84 % of diabetic individuals in the U. S. had full-year coverage and a USC; 2. 3 % had neither one. In multivariate analyses, the uninsured with no USC had one-fifth the odds of receiving A 1 C screening (odds ratio 0. 23 [95 % CI 0. 14 – 0. 38]) and one-tenth the odds of a blood <b>pressure</b> <b>check</b> (0. 08 [0. 05 – 0. 15]), compared with insured diabetic individuals with a USC. Similarly, being uninsured without a USC was associated with 5. 5 times the likelihood of unmet medical needs (5. 51 [3. 49 – 8. 70]) and three times more delayed urgent care (3. 13 [1. 53 – 6. 38]) compared with being insured with a USC.
