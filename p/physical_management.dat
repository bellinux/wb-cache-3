40|$|<b>Physical</b> Security <b>Management</b> is a {{multidisciplinary}} endeavor {{and a very}} tough knowledge domain to model. It is a diffused area of knowledge that is continuously evolving and informally represented. The domain has many complex features interconnecting the physical and the social views of the world. Many international and national bodies create knowledge models to allow knowledge sharing and effective <b>physical</b> security <b>management</b> activities. These models are often narrow in focus and deal with specific organizations. Analysis of these models uncover that many <b>physical</b> security <b>management</b> activities are actually common even though organization are different. This project report creates a unified view of <b>physical</b> security <b>management</b> {{in the form of}} a metamodel that can be seen as a language for this domain. Design Research Science is a procedure of a series of thoughts and activities by which an artifact is developed and achieved. Design Science conceptualized by supports a practical research prototype that calls for the creation of innovative artifacts to solve real- world problems. The metamodel is validated and refined to serve as a representational layer to unify facilitate and further access to <b>physical</b> security <b>management</b> expertise. This aims to facilitate knowledge sharing, combining and matching different <b>physical</b> security <b>management</b> activities at different organizations. This project report synthesizes and validates a methodical metamodelling process applicable to domains represented in a diffused amid informal manner by focusing on the validation and the metamodelling process on <b>physical</b> security <b>management.</b> Comparison against other models is validation technique which is used to identify any missing concepts in the initial version of the metamodel and to also ensure its broad coverag...|$|R

50|$|Several {{scenarios}} {{serve to}} contraindicate the fabrication of palatal lift prostheses or discourage their use. The <b>physical</b> <b>management</b> of palatopharyngeal incompetence {{by way of}} a palatal lift prosthesis might not be well tolerated by patients with strong gag reflexes. Edentulous patients or partially edentulous patients without a sufficient number of dental abutments cannot predictably retain palatal lift prostheses. Dentoalveolar growth and development, pediatric dental exfoliation, and exodontia secondary to periodontitis, carious lesions, other pathoses, or trauma can necessitate the fabrication of successive palatal lift prostheses that may be deemed too costly and/or time consuming. As such, surgical tactics aimed at mitigating palatopharyngeal incompetence can be employed as a substitute to its prosthetic management. Conversely, prosthetic palatopharyngeal incompetence management can offer a favorable substitute to surgical management when surgical contraindications are encountered.|$|E
50|$|Roberton {{was born}} near Hamilton, Lanarkshire and educated {{for the medical}} {{profession}} at Glasgow and Edinburgh. He was admitted {{a member of the}} Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh in 1817. He intended to be a ship's surgeon, and {{was on his way to}} the West Indies when he was wrecked on the Lancashire coast. While at Liverpool he was encouraged to take up his residence at Warrington. He became a Licentiate of the Society of Apothecaries in 1822, and on 9 October 1823 married Mary (1794/5-1851), daughter of David Bellhouse. The couple subsequently moved to Manchester. He soon had an extensive general practice, and, on his appointment in 1827 to the post of surgeon to the Manchester Lying-in Hospital, turned his special attention to midwifery and to the physiology and diseases of women and children. He was also a lecturer at the Marsden Street School of Medicine. His first publication was Observations on the Mortality and <b>Physical</b> <b>Management</b> of Children (1827). From 1830 onwards he wrote a series of scientific papers for the Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal on the time of onset of female puberty in various countries, which led James Cowles Prichard to alter some of the conclusions which he had arrived at in the earlier editions of his Physical History of Mankind. These, along with other similar papers, are reprinted in Roberton's most important work, Essays and Notes on the Physiology and Diseases of Women and on Practical Midwifery (London, 1851). He devoted much time to the subject of hospital construction and the provision of convalescent homes, on which he wrote a number of pamphlets between 1831 and 1861.|$|E

A review has been conducted of iceberg management techniques in current practice, techniques that have been tested as prototypes, and some of the techniques that have been proposed but never tested.

Areas are identified in which improvements to iceberg management techniques are prospective, and may lead to significant increases in operational efficiency.

40|$|Utilization of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAVs) in agriculture, forestry, {{or other}} {{environmental}} contexts has recently become common. However, {{in the case}} of spatial planning, the role of UAVs still seems to be underestimated. At present, sections of municipal development use UAVs mainly for promotional purposes (films, folders, brochures, etc.). The use of UAVs for spatial management provides results, first of all, in the form of savings in human resources and time; however, more frequently, it is also connected with financial savings (given the decreasing cost of UAVs and photogrammetric software). The performed research presented here relates to the possibilities of using UAVs to update planning documents, and, in particular, to update the study of conditions and directions of spatial management and preparation of local plans for <b>physical</b> <b>management.</b> Based on acquired photographs with a resolution of 3 cm, a cloud of points is generated, as well as 3 D models and the true orthophotomap.

40|$|Part IV: ICT and Emerging TechnologiesInternational audiencePhysical asset Management is “the optimal {{life cycle}} <b>management</b> of <b>physical</b> assets to {{sustainably}} achieve the stated business objectives”. A "physical asset" {{is defined as}} a physical item that has potential or actual value to an organization. During 2011 - 2012 the European Federation of National Maintenance Societies (EFNMS) European Asset Management Committee (EAMC) carried out a survey of industries seeking to map <b>physical</b> asset <b>management</b> practices.

This paper presents the survey deeper findings regarding the responses, influences of industrial sector and business environment on <b>physical</b> asset <b>management</b> practices, identification of typical existing asset management profiles and improvement suggestions. Focus is given on comparing asset management practices between Greece and other EU countries, offering insight into different technological, business environment and other factors influencing <b>physical</b> asset <b>management</b> practices...|$|R
