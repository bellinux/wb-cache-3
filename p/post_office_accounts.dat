40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} ADRN {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The Child Benefit dataset records the number of UK families that are claiming a Child Benefit {{and the number of}} children for whom the benefit is received from 2003. On average, more than 98 per cent of children in the UK are estimated to receive the Child Benefit, which is paid directly into claimants’ bank, building society or <b>post</b> <b>office</b> <b>accounts.</b> The Child Benefit dataset contains details {{of the total number of}} claimants, by age of child, sex of child and household composition. Geographic referencing is possible allowing records to be linked to Ward, District or Government Office Region. The Child Benefit was introduced in 1977 and administered by the Department for Work and Pensions until 2003. Thereafter, responsibility for the collection of Child Benefit information was passed from the DWP to the HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) in April 2003. Hence HMRC only hold child benefit data from 2003. In 2007 / 08 Child Benefit was paid to the carers of more than 13 million children in 7. 5 million families in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Child Benefit is available for the majority of children in the UK (around 98 %) and so the dataset holds information relating to claims in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The Child Benefit dataset is obtained from the HMRC computer systems that administer the benefit. Data scans are carried out quarterly. National Level quarterly data is scheduled for release approximately three months after the relevant period. Responsibility Quarterly datasets based on a 5 % sample are available from May 2003 to October 2007. In addition annual datasets which give complete coverage of Child Benefit recipients are available from 2003 to 2006, and quarterly from May 2009. The annual dataset can be geographically referenced to the Lower Layer Super Output Area, as can quarterly datasets from June 2009. The Child Benefit dataset geographical areas are calculated using the postcode and address information reported on the claim. Accurate linking using the National Insurance Number, Child Benefit Number, or names and addresses can then occur. More specifically, most HMRC data do contain names and addresses. Variables within the dataset may be subject to statistical disclosure control techniques to prevent disclosure and confidentiality issues being breached. Published counts of Child Benefit data at a small area level are also rounded so the published total number of claimants in a larger area may possibly not match the summed totals from data tables produced at a smaller geography. The HMRC also carry out a number of standard checks to ensure overall quality of the data. However, many people now receive Child Benefit directly into bank or <b>Post</b> <b>Office</b> <b>accounts.</b> Although people should inform the HMRC when they move home, the address information may not always be up to date. The dataset information comes from a scan of the computer systems that are used to administer Child Benefit. Anyone attempting to defraud the system is liable to prosecution. Therefore the quality of the dataset is believed to be of a high standard. Please note that families with children may choose not to claim Child Benefit (take up rates are estimated to be around 98 %) and there are some circumstances where a child might be ineligible. Research Usage and Linkage As the Child Benefit data are restricted in scope, the potential for research purposes is limited. However, it does provide a good basis for assessing the overall number of claimants at specified times, the geographical distribution of claimants and estimating the size of the child population. For example, the Office for National Statistics use this dataset to create population estimates at the lower layer super output area level. The data has been used to estimate the number of children living in low income households (English Indices of Deprivation 2007, Economic Deprivation Index 2008 and the Child Well-being Index 2009), and also to estimate the proportion of children post 16 years old staying in full-time education (English Indices of Deprivation 2007 and Child Well-being 2009). In the past the data also formed the basis of sampling frames for the Millennium Cohort Study. The Child Benefit dataset is linked by the HMRC to other datasets that they hold, to help with the administration of tax credits. This includes the Tax Credit Claimants dataset which has the same referencing in order for comparisons to be made. Linking is made using the National Insurance number, Child Benefit Number or names and addresses. In theory, it is possible to link the Child Benefit dataset with other individual tax records and DWP benefit data. These linked datasets have the potential to be used for in-depth research of family income, work and worklessness patterns. Finally, the initial wave of the Families and Children Study was drawn from Child Benefit records. </div...|$|E

50|$|The day Prime Minister signs this TCP law, some {{concerned}} citizens will submit about 200 affidavits. The first affidavit {{is known as}} Mineral Royalties for Citizens and Military (MRCM). The MRCM affidavit is a 7-page proposed law listed at chapter 5 of righttorecall.info/301.pdf. It is expected in a democracy like India that citizens should be the owners of all the assets of nation-state. The proposed MRCM law creates an administrative system by which each citizen DIRECTLY gets his/her rightful part of mineral royalties and land rents from GoI plots. E.g. Say in Dec-2008, the mineral royalties and land rent from GoI plots was Rs 30000 crores. Then as per the proposed MRCM law, Rs 10000 cr will go towards Military. And for rest Rs 20000 cr, each citizen will get about Rs 200 deposited in his local SBI <b>account</b> or local <b>post</b> <b>office</b> bank <b>account.</b> If each of the adult citizens of India visits bank once a month to withdraw the cash, only about 100,000 clerks will be needed.
