METHODS: Records of closed claims were provided by Swiss <b>professional</b> medical <b>liability</b> <b>insurance</b> companies and the Office for Extrajudicial Expert Review of the Swiss Medical Association. Data were collected by an onsite reviewer, converted into a standardised format and sent to the SSAR Closed Claims Study Group.

40|$|Objectives: Dentistry, {{like all}} other health care professions, has in recent years been {{subjected}} {{to an increase in}} legal pressure by patients. Nevertheless, there are areas of activity in dentistry in which, whether because of their frequency or due to the importance of the damage and sequelae claimed, this legal pressure is greater. Amongst these areas of activity is that of oral surgery. Study design: To be meticulously analyzed in this report are 63 sentences issued by courts of second instance or higher levels regarding lawsuits involving oral surgery. The data collection file includes 13 variables. The descriptive and comparative statistical study by cross-referencing certain variables provides us with a clear and accurate picture of the lawsuit profile. Results and conclusions: Implantological surgery was the practice subject to the most claims due to surgery (55. 6 percent: 35 sentences), and it drew our attention that in 71. 4 % of all cases (45 sentences) there was a ruling against the professional. The most frequent range of damage payments was between ? 18, 001 and ? 60, 000 (40. 9 %: 18 sentences), the highest amount having been ? 24, 000, an important factor to take into account when contracting <b>professional</b> civil <b>liability</b> <b>insurance.</b> © Medicina Oral S.

Researches on Selecting Project Delivery Systems by Victor Sanvido and Mark Konchar of Pennsylvania State University found that design-build projects are delivered 33.5% faster than projects that are designed and built under separate contracts (design-bid-build).

Similar cost and time savings were found in a comparison study of design-build, and design-bid-build for the water/wastewater construction industry, a peer-reviewed paper authored by Smith Culp Consulting that {{will be published in}} July 2011 by the American Society of Civil Engineers.

40|$|Many U. S. lawyers “go bare” and {{represent}} clients without maintaining malpractice insurance. Efforts to require these lawyers to carry lawyer <b>professional</b> <b>liability</b> (LPL) <b>insurance</b> have mostly foundered, due to bar opposition {{and concerns about}} the cost of insurance. As a compromise between protecting the public and protecting lawyers’ interests, many states now require lawyers to disclose whether they carry LPL insurance to clients, regulators, or both. This Article draws on survey data from Arizona, Connecticut and New Mexico lawyers that shed light on which lawyers go bare and the reasons why they do so. The Article then looks at states’ insurance disclosure requirements and assesses how well they achieve their primary purpose of public protection and their secondary aim of inducing uninsured lawyers to purchase LPL insurance. It also examines whether some of the bar’s arguments against disclosure requirements have proved meritorious. The Article then returns to the question, first considered forty years ago, of whether U. S. lawyers should be required to maintain LPL insurance. The evidence suggests that—like lawyers throughout {{much of the rest of}} the world—U. S. lawyers should be required to maintain LPL insurance. It explains why the current disclosure rules do not sufficiently alert clients to the risks posed by uninsured lawyers. The Article recommends measures to improve the current insurance disclosure rules, while recognizing the limitations of any disclosure scheme...|$|R
