5|$|The period {{also saw}} the {{development}} of charter fairs in England, which reached their heyday in the 13th century. From the 12th century onwards, many English towns acquired a charter from the Crown allowing them to hold an annual fair, usually serving a regional or local customer base and lasting {{for two or three}} days. The practice increased in the next century and over 2,200 charters were issued to markets and fairs by English kings between 1200 and 1270. Fairs grew in popularity as the international wool trade increased: the fairs allowed English wool producers and ports on the east coast to engage with visiting foreign merchants, circumnavigating those English merchants in London keen to make a profit as middlemen. At the same time, wealthy magnate consumers in England began to use the new fairs as a way to buy goods like spices, wax, <b>preserved</b> <b>fish</b> and foreign cloth in bulk from the international merchants at the fairs, again bypassing the usual London merchants.|$|E

500|$|In Temple Hills, Maryland, {{residents}} were evacuated from two damaged apartment buildings. In Kensington, {{the tops of}} four spires on the Washington D.C. Temple of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints {{fell to the ground}} along with several pieces of marble from the façade. Near Brunswick, the earthquake caused [...] "significant discoloration and a reduction in the quality of the water" [...] of a spring, leading officials to warn against using the water until further notice. In the Fells Point neighborhood of Baltimore, St. Patrick Catholic Church was deemed unsafe and was scheduled to be closed for weeks for repairs. In Salisbury, the City Police station endured damage above doorways and in concrete block walls, and there was also minor cracking in classroom walls at Salisbury University. In Annapolis, several buildings at the United States Naval Academy were damaged. In Suitland, eight jars of <b>preserved</b> <b>fish</b> specimens fell from shelves at a Smithsonian Institution storage facility. The 1740 Mt. Calvert Mansion, a historic site and museum located on the Patuxent River in Upper Marlboro, received substantial structural damage and was closed indefinitely to the public.|$|E
2500|$|The Apalachee {{were part}} of an {{expansive}} trade network that extended from the Gulf Coast to the Great Lakes, and westward to what is now Oklahoma. [...] The Apalachee acquired copper artifacts, sheets of mica, greenstone, and galena from distant locations through this trade. [...] The Apalachee probably paid for such imports with shells, pearls, shark teeth, <b>preserved</b> <b>fish</b> and sea turtle meat, salt, and cassina leaves and twigs (used to make the black drink).|$|E
2500|$|The Talkeetna Mountains Hadrosaur was a hadrosaurid of {{indeterminate}} classification whose carcass {{appeared to}} have been deposited in a bathyal or outer shelf environment that later became Alaska's Matanuska Formation. Every element of its skeleton not found in a concretion bore many closely spaced ovualar conical depressions ranging in diameter from [...] and [...] deep. These depressions are probably bite marks. The depressions are not symmetrical enough for gastropod drill marks and are not shaped like sponge borings. None of the <b>preserved</b> <b>fish</b> fossils of the Matanuska Formation fit the size or geometry of the borings. The size and spacing and shape by contrast, however, closely resembles the teeth of Tylosaurus proriger. The apparent tooth marks are unlikely to have occurred before the carcass was washed out to sea since that would have punctured the body, preventing the buildup of bloating gases that allowed the carcass to drift out to sea in the first place. The distribution of bite marks corresponds inversely to the presence of flesh in the animal. For instance, lower limb bones sustained the most damage because there was the least amount of flesh shielding the bones at those locations. The concretions formed as the flesh chemically reacted to the seafloor on the largest parts of the animal where the scavenging mosasaur would be unable to fully wrap its jaws around the carcass. Bones pulled free from the carcass were buried in the mud and preserved in mudstone.|$|E

Stoffel had but one mode of arguing--that was with the cudgel; but he used it with such effect that he routed his antagonists, broke up the settlement, and would have driven the inhabitants into the sea, if they had not managed to escape across the Sound to the mainland by the Devil's Stepping-stones, which remain to this day monuments of this great Dutch victory over the Yankees.|$|E
60|$|It {{was about}} eleven o'clock {{when we reached}} Elandslaagte Station. A train awaited the prisoners. There were six or seven closed vans {{for the men and}} a {{first-class}} carriage for the officers. Into a compartment of this we were speedily bundled. Two Boers with rifles sat themselves between us, and the doors were locked. I was desperately hungry, and asked for both food and water. 'Plenty is coming,' they said, so we waited patiently, and sure enough, in a few minutes a railway official came along the platform, opened the door, and thrust before us in generous profusion two tins of preserved mutton, two tins of <b>preserved</b> <b>fish,</b> four or five loaves, half a dozen pots of jam, and a large can of tea. As far as I could see the soldiers fared no worse. The reader will believe that we did not stand on ceremony, but fell to at once and made the first satisfying meal for three days. While we ate a great crowd of Boers gathered around the train and peered curiously in at the windows. One of them was a doctor, who, noticing that my hand was bound up, inquired whether I were wounded. The cut caused by the splinter of bullet was insignificant, but since it was ragged and had received no attention for two days it had begun to fester. I therefore showed him my hand, and he immediately bustled off to get bandages and hot water and what not, with which, amid the approving grins of the rough fellows who thronged the platform, he soon bound me up very correctly.|$|E
