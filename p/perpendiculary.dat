Here, the length of the ellipse corresponds to the material thickness. The shaping of the beam <b>perpendiculary</b> to the band edges is made on consideration of the shape of the components...|$|E

By combining abinitio and semi-empirical models [1], a scaling analysis of the Landauer conductance has been performed and characteristic transport length scales extracted from phenomenological laws. A quantitative analysis {{of the relationship between}} energy-dependant elastic mean free path and localization length has been done, and an external magnetic eld applied <b>perpendiculary</b> to the nanotube axis is shown to induce a shift in energies of quasibound states, a phe-nomenon that results in giant magnetoconductance uctuations under Fermi level shift.

40|$|AbstractThe {{shape of}} the {{cladding}} tracks is extremely important for producing layers or structures by adding them sequently. This paper shows {{the influence of the}} laser power of a diode laser in the range of 500 to 1000 W on the shapes of single tracks in scanner based laser wire cladding. The scanner was used to oscillate the beam <b>perpendiculary</b> to the welding direction. Stainless steel (ER 318 Si) wire with a 0. 6 mm diameter was used as deposition material. Height, width, penetration, molten area and weld seam angles of single tracks were obtained from cross-sections at three different positions of each track. The influence of these different positions on the results depends on the traverse speed. The paper discusses this influence in respect to the heat dissipation in the substrate material...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} an external magnetic field on the magnitude and dephasing of the transient lateral photovoltaic effect (T-LPE) in lithographically patterned Co lines of widths of a few microns grown over naturally passivated p-type Si(100). The T-LPE peak-to-peak magnitude and dephasing, measured by lock-in or through the characteristic time of laser OFF exponential relaxation, exhibit a notable influence of the magnetization direction of the ferromagnetic overlayer. We show experimentally and by numerical simulations that the T-LPE magnitude {{is determined by the}} Co anisotropic magnetoresistance. On the other hand, the magnetic field dependence of the dephasing could be described by the influence of the Lorentz force acting <b>perpendiculary</b> to both the Co magnetization and the photocarrier drift directions. Our findings could stimulate the development of fast position sensitive detectors with magnetically tuned magnitude and phase responses...|$|E
40|$|We {{present and}} discuss a new {{experimental}} setup to perform small angle X-ray scattering and diffraction (SAXSD) of localized liposome colloidal microparticles. A home-built inverted infrared laser tweezers microscope {{is used to}} trap, manipulate and aggregate micron-scale liposome particles at single locations inside a 100 microns glass capillary. The micro-focused X-ray and the laser beams are aligned to intersect each other <b>perpendiculary,</b> allowing to associate the X-ray diffraction signal to the micron-sized region of interest inside the capillary. Throughout the laser tweezer setup, using diffractive optical elements implemented on a spatial light modulator, {{we are able to}} manipulate small aggregates of colloidal particles (liposomes) and fix them in the optical path of the X-ray beam. We present and discuss first scattering and diffraction experiments on phospholipid liposomes, at the ID 13 microfocus beamline of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF). The results demonstrate that we can push the limit of measurable cluster size close to a single liposome...|$|E
40|$|The {{experimental}} work {{was performed to}} investigate the joining of SiSiC, and the reliability of interfaces of laminated SiSiC and of plasma sprayed zirconia base coatings. For SiSiC different process steps of the diffusion bonding technique were investigated and optimized. Tensile, 4 -point bending, and double torsion experiments were performed on laminated SiSiC. From these investigations {{it was found that}} the interface and sheet orientations determine a non-isotropic strength distribution in this material. In double torsion experiments the influence of the different interface configurations on the macrocrack propagation in laminated SiSiC was investigated. The highest crack resistance was observed when the crack was propagating towards the interfaces <b>perpendiculary.</b> The long term reliability was tested by four point bending fatigue loading up to 10 high 7 cycles. In order to characterize the fracture mechanics behaviour of ceramic coatings on metallic substrates four experimental tech niques with different specimen types were elaborated. Investigations on adhesion strength were performed on tensile specimens. In ZrO thermal barrier coatings the influence of substrate heating during deposition on the properties of the coatings was investigated. A special temperature-time profile leads to K sub IC factors up to 1, 5 MNm high - 3 / 2. Service simulation tests performed on a test rig by CSM revealed a clear correlation between the observed failure behaviour and the measured crack resistance...|$|E
40|$|Laser {{lithography}} on non-planar surfaces is {{a technology}} {{which has been}} investigated at the IOF for more than 5 years. A special lithography system was developed for this purpose, allowing to structure spherical substrates with radii of curvature of greater or equal 10 mm. Binary or gray scale exposures with a minimum feature size of about µm covering a field of view (FOV) of ± 10 ° are possible in standard operation mode. We present two approaches which will overcome certain disadvantages of the writing strategy {{at the expense of}} an increase in minimum feature size. First, we propose an exposure strategy which allows for an extension of the FOV to up to ± 20 ° with satisfying accuracy of the structures. The according data is decomposed into concentric circles and projected onto the sphere so the exposure is not <b>perpendiculary</b> to the surface any more. Here we make use of the ability of our laser lithography system to adapt {{to a wide range of}} possible substrate thicknesses. On substrates with a flat edge, even layer to layer alignment for the curved structures is possible with an accuracy of less of equal 2 µm. Example structures as well as prospects and limitations of this exposure strategy are presented. Secondly, similar to planar lithography, the use of a mask to produce multiple copies of a master sample is possible. Evidently the spherical mask needs to have the opposite radius of curvature than the desired substrate, and additional problems arising from the curved geometry have to be taken into consideration. Despite a lowered contrast due to back reflections and a varying distance between mask and substrate exposure results of sufficient quality are achieved with the help of an adapted aperture...|$|E
40|$|Many modern trains {{today have}} {{distributed}} engines in every wagon throughout the train making the leading wagon relatively light. This {{can cause a}} risk of derailment, when traveling at high speeds and exposed to strong crosswind or sudden gusts of wind. To study the forces acting on a train {{as a result of}} side wind, low Reynolds number experiments on a simplified train geometry has been conducted at the RTRI institute in japan. The experiments includes both stationary yaw angles as well as a train moving through a region of crosswind. The experimental data consists of pressure measurments at 38 locations distributed along the train body. The simulated scenarios consists of a stationary train exposed to side wind of 5 m/s at yaw angle 90 degrees (Re = 16000), as well as a train moving at 5 m/s <b>perpendiculary</b> through the side wind (Re = 23000). To simulate the moving train a moving velocity profile is used to {{as a model for the}} side wind. PANS and LES are run on identical meshes for both cases. The standard Smagorinsky model is employed in the LES. For the RANS part of PANS the ζ-f-model is used. The parameter fk defined as the unresolved to total ratio of turbulence kinetic energy, is recomputed before each timestep. The mesh for the stationary case is slightly to coarse for LES, which makes it possible to see the advantage of PANS. All simulations are performed using the commersial software package AVL Fire. Good agreement with the experimental data is found with both LES and PANS for the stationary case. However, PANS makes a substantially better prediction of the pressure at the lateral ends of the train, where the spanwise mesh-resolution is coarser. In the moving case LES and PANS displays very similar results, having some discrepancies but showing fair agreement to experimental data. The computing of fk assumes a stable time averaged flow, which is the probable reason why PANS does not show the same advantage in the moving scenario...|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} we {{concentrate}} our {{efforts on the}} generation of laser emission at low THz frequencies (3 - 1 THz range) employing the quantum cascade technology. Quantum cascade (QC) lasers are unipolar semiconductor lasers based on intersubband transitions in quantum wells that cover {{a large portion of}} the Mid and Far Infrared electromagnetic spectrum. Two main research lines have been followed: (i) the development of quantum cascade lasers based on population inversion between parabolic subbands and (ii) the development of low frequency QC lasers based on a three-dimensional electron confinement induced by an external magnetic field. (i) : Gain and laser action have been demonstrated in different systems at frequencies of 3. 4 3. 6 THz exploiting bound-to-bound and bound-to-continuum optical transition. A QC laser emitting at 3. 6 THz and based on a vertical transition and resonant tunneling in a single quantum well has been demonstrated. To overcome the limitations in performance of such a system, an heterostructure laser based on a bound-to-continuum transition has been developed. The structure was the first one to operate above the technologically important temperature of liquid nitrogen. With a further development of the bound-to-continuum design that includes lower state lifetime reduction by optical phonon emission, laser action was successfully achieved at 115 K. A study of different waveguide mechanisms suitable for different THz frequencies has also been carried out. (ii) : THz quantum cascade lasers based on the in-plane confinement introduced by a strong magnetic field applied <b>perpendiculary</b> to the plane of the layers have been developed. A model system based on large single quantum wells (50 - 60 nm wide) has been exploited to study this gain mechanism. Such an approach led to the extension of the frequency range of operation of QC lasers, with the demonstration of laser action at 1. 39 THz (220 m) which is the lowest frequency observed to-date for this kind of technology. The size confinement induced by the magnetic field radically modifies the physics of the system allowing laser action with extremely reduced threshold current densities (0. 65 A/cm 2), a factor of 70 lower than any other quantum cascade laser and among the lowest ever observed for a semiconductor laser in general. Electron wavefunction localization is at the basis of the observed effects. Resonances in transport and in laser emission characteristics have been observed and attributed to many-body phenomena. The magnetic field has been used also as a spectroscopic tool to investigate the structures developed in the research line (i). Multi-frequency operation obtained by selectively injecting carriers in the excited states of a single quantum well structure has also been demonstrated...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, {{pesticides}} use {{is necessary}} to satisfy the growing demand for agricultural products. During pesticide spray application, the agricultural mixture containing the active ingredient is fragmented to a cloud of droplets of various sizes and speeds. The droplet size distribution within the spray affects {{the efficiency of the}} treatment. According to the target, a specific droplet size should be used. However, hydraulic nozzles usually used in field application produce sprays with a wide droplet size distribution containing an important proportion of small or too large droplets. This results in non-optimal application and therefore losses of product into the environment. This statement conducted the research as early as in the 60 ’s to create the rotary atomizer. This device is able to produce narrow droplet size distribution using Plateau-Rayleigh break up mechanism. The characteristics of the produced spray by the rotary atomiser can be tuned by adjusting the rotational speed and the volumetric flow rate. Although offering agronomic and environmental qualities this has not met success for the application of plant protection products in field crops because of their cost, size and complexity. The aim of the thesis was the design of a hydraulic nozzle with the rotary atomizer qualities and without the constraints of rotating parts. Unlike the rotary atomizer which has two control variables, the developed hydraulic nozzle will have a narrower operating range, thus a specific geometry has to be design for each kind of treatment. The new hydraulic nozzle design is composed by an inlet pipe ending <b>perpendiculary</b> on a plate. There is a thin opening at the junction between the pipe and the plate. The edge of the plate is constituted of channels formed by structures. These channels aim to divide the liquid sheet in multiple jets. The breakup of these jets into droplets generate a narrow droplet size distribution. The thesis can been seen as a roadmap providing design tools at each step starting from the determination of an optimal droplet size according to the kind of treatment and ending with a nozzle geometry. The prediction of the optimal droplet size according to the treatment was done using integrated modelling approach of the spray transport and retention by the plant. As each spray requires a specific nozzle geometry, an analytical model of the flow on the nozzle was developed. This model allows the determination of geometry according to the desired spray. Finally, a prototype of nozzle has been built. The measurement of the spray characteristics of the prototype was realized using a developed high-speed imaging technique providing the droplet size and speed. The prototype showed results in term of narrowing of the droplet size distribution...|$|E

LITEN IS A SMALL MUNICIPALITY NEAR BEROUN INHABITED BY APPROXIMATELY 1000 CITIZIENS. IT IS SURROUNDED BY THE BEAUTIFUL NATURE OF CZECH KARST AND THE FORESTS OF KARLSTEJN REGION. AS FAR AS URBANISM IS CONCERNED, THE MUNICIPALITY IS QUITE FRAGMENTED. THE VILLAGE LIKE CHARACTER OF DEVELOPEMENTS OF LONG BUILDINGS WITH ENCLOSED FARMYARDS BUILT <b>PERPENDICULARY</b> TO ROADS IS IRREGULARLY DISRUPTED BY MODERN DEVELOPMENT. THE MOST PROBLEMATIC ISUE OF THE MUNICIPALITY IS THE SEGREGATION OF LOCAL CHATEAU COMPLEX, WHICH IHAS ALWAYS BEEN THE HEART OF LITEN. THE NEWLY DESIGNED SQUARE LIES IN THE HEART OF THE MUNICIPALITY AND IT CORRESPONDS TO THE TWO DOMINANTS OF LITEN - THE CHATEAU AND THE CHURCH. A CLEAR RESPONSE TO THIS HISTORICAL AXIS CAN BE SEEN IN TURNING THE CHATEAU´S ENTRANCE, WHICH ENABLES THE CONNECTION OF THE SQUARE WITH THE CHATEAU´S COURTYARD. APART FROM THE SQUARE AND COURTYARD, THERE ARE FEW LARGER SPOTS WHERE BIGGER CROWDS OF PEOPLE ARE EXPECTED TO OCCUR. THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE STREETS CORRESPONDS TO THE BASIC MODEL OF A VILLAGE - A HOUSE WITH A BRICH FENCE OR A GATE. THIS BASIC ELEMENT IS TRANSFORMED TO TWO DESIGN FORMS: A HOUSE WITH A SADDLE ROF AND A SINGLE STOREY UNIT WITH A FLAT ROOF. THIS FLAT ROOF CAN BE USED AS A TERRACE, IT ARTICULATES THE PLACE, AND YET IT MAINTAINS THE STREET LINE. BY THIS, THE BASIC FORM OF MUNICIPALITY IS ESTABLISHED - A TRANSITION BETWEEN THE URBANISM OF A VILAGE AND A TOWN. THE SECOND MODEL IS THAT OF AN OUTDOOR ROOFED ARCADE WITH A FLAT ROOF, WHICH ACTS AS A FENCE, AND IT ALLOWS A PASSAGE BETWEN TWO VISUALLY SEPARATED SPACES. THE ARCHITECTUAL STUDY DEALS WITH THE AREA SOUTH-EAST OF THE CHATEAU IN GRETER DETAIL. SINCE LITEN IS CLOSELY LINKED WITH JARMILA NOVOTNA, A FAMOUS OPERA SINGER, I HAS DECIDED TO DEVOTE THIS PART OF THE AREA TO A MULTIFUNCTIONAL CULTURAL-EDUCATIONAL CENTRE. THE PURSUIT OF KEEPING ALL HISTORICALY VALUABLE BUILDINGS AND THEIR SUPLEMENTATION BY NEW BUILDINGS LED TO VISUALLY ENCLOSED BLOCK, WHERE THREE MULTIFUNCTIONAL ATELIERS, TWO AUDITORIUMS, A CAFÉ AND A BUILDING FOR TEMPORARY ACCOMMODATION OF ARTISTS OR MULTIDAY ART COURSE ATTENDANTS ARE TO BE FOUND. IT IS POSSIBLE TO LET THIS ACCOMODATION FACILITY TO BE USED BY THE PUBLIC AND TO ENSURE BY THIS ECONOMIC PROFITABILITY. THE SAME CAN BE APLIED FOR BOTH AUDITORIUMS. AN OPEN SPACE GRASSY AREA WITH A STAGE IS SITUATED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BUILDINGS, AND IS SUITABLE FOR OPEN-AIR EVENTS. USUALLY, THIS PLACE IS ACCESSIBLE TO ALL AND THE INHABITANTS OF LITEN CAN CROSS IT FREELY. WHEN A PRIVATE EVENT IS TAKING PLACE, THE AREA CAN BE EASILY ENCLOSED. ANOTHER ART PLATFORM IS SITUATED IN FRONT OF THE MAIN ENTRANCE. THE PLACE IS DESCRIBED AS A ?CULTURE PLACE?, WHICH ENABLES AL VARIATIONS OF STREET ART ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING FOR EXAMPLE BUSKONG OR STREET DRAWING. ARTS AND CULTURE CAN THEREFORE BECOME A PART OF EVERYDAY LIFE OF LITEN. THE MULTIFUNCTIONALITY OF THE WKOLE AREA MAKES MULTI-GENRE AND MULTI-FIELD INTERCONNECTIONS POSSIBLE, AND THAT IS WHY THIS PROJECT IS UNIQUE. IT ENABLES MEETING OF ARTISTS FROM DIFFERENT FIELDS, DISCOURSE AND COOPERATION, THEREFORE IT CAN LEAD TO QUALITY INTERCONNECTED CULTURE AND ARTS, WHICH IS, ESPECIALLY IN TODAY´S WORLD OF FAST DEVELOPING NEW MEDIA, EXTREMLY VALUABLE. THESE FUNCTIONS ARE SUPPLEMENTED BY THE EXISTING BUILDINGS, THE ORIGINAL BARN AND A BREWERy. THE BRICK BARN FUNCTIONS AS A HOTEL WITH INTERIORS OF LOFT MOTIF, THE ADJACENT BREWERY IS DESIGNED TO BE A RESTAURANT. PRODUCTION OF LOCAL BEER WILL BE RENEWED IN THE REAR PART OF BREWERY. ABOVE THE RESTAURANT, IN THE SECOND FLOOR ORIGINALLY USED FOR STORING HOPS AND MALT, TWO HALLS ARE DESIGNED. THEY ARE DESIGNED FOR EXHIBITIONS OR THEY CAN BE USED AS FILM OR PHOTOGRAPHIC STUDIOS, NEWSROOM FOR ONLINE STREAMING OR AS A PLACE FOR DISCUSSIONS. THE BREWERY IS NEIGHBOURED BY A SMALL BRICK HOUSE, WHICH HAS BEEN USED AS A PALET STORAGE PLACE, AND WHICH IS DESIGNED TO BE A MUST AND CIDER HOUSE WITH AN APPLE ORCHARD SURROUNDING THE RENEWED POND...|$|E
