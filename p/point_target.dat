[...] It has no turret, and its inconspicuous main armament is a fortification 75mm Blockhaus Schneider, placed in a barbette in the right front corner of the tank. [...] The right side had been chosen because the gunner had to stand {{to the left of the}} barrel to operate the gun. [...] The cannon type was developed from a 75mm trench mortar that had been adapted to fire from a fixed fortification position by adding a recoil compensator and a gun shield; in this configuration it weighed 210 kilogrammes. [...] This short-barrelled cannon had a length of just 9.5 calibres. It fired the standard French HE Model 1915 75mm shell but with a reduced propelling charge, shortening the length of the round from 350 to 241 millimetres, allowing for a muzzle velocity of only two hundred metres per second. This limited the maximum range to 2200 metres, the practical range was six hundred metres and the tank needed to close within two hundred metres of a <b>point</b> <b>target</b> to allow for precision shooting. [...] The gun has a traverse of 60°, a depression of -10° and an elevation of 30°. [...] The ammunition stock is ninety vertically stowed rounds. [...] Two 8mm Hotchkiss Model 1914 machine guns, projecting from the flanks in large hemispherical ballmounts, and resting on pintles, complement the short 75mm gun. The right machine gun is, because of the room needed for the main gun, positioned more to the rear than the left one. [...] The machine guns have a traverse of 106°, a depression of -45° and an elevation of 20°. [...] To the right of the cannon there is a bin for twenty readily accessible 75mm rounds. [...] Three other bins are positioned respectively at the extreme right rear corner (fourteen rounds), to the left of the engine (thirty-two) and at the left rear corner (twenty-four). The latter is situated to the right of a bin, at the extreme left corner, for the stock of four thousand rounds of 8mm ammunition. In 1918, in practice fifty belts with ninety-six rounds were carried, for a total of 4800 rounds.|$|E

50|$|The M31 GMLRS Unitary rocket {{transformed}} the M270 into a <b>point</b> <b>target</b> artillery {{system for the}} first time. Due to GPS guidance and a single 200 lb high-explosive warhead, the M31 could hit targets accurately with less chance of collateral damage while needing fewer rockets to be fired, reducing logistical requirements. The unitary warhead also made the MLRS able {{to be used in}} urban environments. The M31 had a dual-mode fuse with point detonation and delay options to defeat soft targets and lightly fortified bunkers respectively, with the upgraded M31A1 equipped with a multi-mode fuse adding a proximity airburst mode for use against personnel in the open; proximity mode can be set for 3 or 10 m height of burst (HOB). The GMLRS has a minimum engagement range of 15 km and can hit a target out to 70 km, impacting at a speed of Mach 2.5.|$|E
5000|$|The cyclic rate {{reflects}} {{how fast}} a self-loading firearm can fire, extract, reload, and recock its mechanism {{to prepare for}} follow-up shots. This is not, however, the effective rate of fire. The effective rate of fire is {{the rate at which}} shots can be accurately (effectively) fired at a specific <b>point</b> <b>target.</b> Many firearms have been developed with high rates of fire which have proven to have extremely low rates of effective fire. An easy example of this is the MAC-10 [...] submachine gun. The MAC-10 in 9mm originally fired at 1,200 rpm. At this rate individual shots can no longer be heard so its fire sounds like a giant zipper being ripped apart. When a MAC-10 fires, the probability of hitting a target with more than 1 or 2 rounds is quite low. So it has a very poor effective rate of fire.|$|E
50|$|The Mk 19 is a belt-fed, blowback-operated, air-cooled, crew-served, fully {{automatic}} weapon {{that is designed}} not to cook off. It fires 40 mm grenades at a cyclic rate of 325 to 375 rounds per minute, giving a practical rate of fire of 60 rounds per minute (rapid) and 40 rounds per minute (sustained). The weapon operates on the blowback principle, which uses the chamber pressure from each fired round to load and re-cock the weapon. The Mk 19 can launch its grenade at a maximum distance of 2,212 m, though its effective range to a <b>point</b> <b>target</b> is about 1,500 m, since the large rear leaf sight is only graduated as far. The nearest safe distance to launch the grenade is 310 meters in training and 75 meters in combat. Though the Mk 19 has a flash suppressor, it serves only to save the eyesight of its operator, not concealing the weapon's position. For night operation, a picatinny rail quadrant sight can be added for thermal and night vision optics.|$|E
40|$|Data {{collected}} by the Shuttle Imaging Radar-B (SIR-B) on two ascending orbits over a site in west-central Illinois were used to establish end-to-end transfer functions for conversion of the digital numbers on the eight-bit image to values of the radar backscattering coefficient, sigma(0). The transfer function for each data take was defined by the SIR response to an array of six calibrated <b>point</b> <b>targets</b> of known radar cross section and to {{a large number of}} area-extended targets, also with a known cross section, as measured by externally calibrated, truck-mounted scatterometers. In spite of variance in the SIR transmit power, end-to-end transfer functions generated from either <b>point</b> <b>targets</b> or area-extended targets were found to yield close agreement for a given pass, indicating that targets of known radar cross section can be used to provide transfer functions for orbital SAR. Although the use of area-extended targets yielded the most satisfactory results, the use of <b>point</b> <b>targets</b> is far simpler and may be the preferred alternative for many situations...|$|R

50|$|The maximum {{effective}} <b>point</b> <b>target</b> {{range of}} an M4 carbine with M855 rounds is 500 m, {{with a maximum}} effective area target range of 600 m. These mark the greatest distances the rounds {{can be expected to}} accurately hit the target, not the ranges that they have terminal effectiveness against them. Because the M855 is yaw dependent it requires instability in flight to deform upon hitting the target. It is the most stable in flight between 150 - 350 m, potentially lessening its effectiveness if it strikes an enemy between those distances. In addition to this, tests have shown that 5.56 mm bullets fragment most reliably when traveling faster than 2,500 ft/s. From full-length 20 in rifle and machine gun barrels, rounds exhibit velocities above 2,500 ft/s out to 200 m. An M855 fired from a shorter barreled M4 carbine exhibits a bullet velocity of 2,522 ft/s at 150 m range. Even if it impacts at optimum speeds, 70 percent of 5.56 mm bullets will not begin to yaw until 4.7 in of tissue penetration. 15 percent more begin to yaw after that distance, so up to 85 percent of rounds that hit do not start to fragment until nearly 5 in of penetration. Against small statured or thin combatants, the M855 has little chance of yawing before passing through cleanly and leaving a wound cavity no bigger than the bullet itself. The factors of impact angle and velocity, instability distance, and penetration before yaw reduce the round's predictable effectiveness considerably in combat situations.|$|E
5000|$|General Dynamics first {{realized}} the capability gap being experienced by U.S. forces in Afghanistan around 2010. In many cases, troops were on low ground and being engaged by PKM machine gun {{fire from the}} high ground, forcing them to return fire from where they were instead {{of being able to}} seek a better position. The M2 [...]50-caliber machine gun is too heavy for use by dismounted patrols, and rounds from an M240 begin to drift off target at 800 meters, especially when shooting upwards. At closer ranges, an M240 is accurate but does not have enough penetrating power against hard structures. The Precision Sniper Rifle competition going on at that time also showed the U.S. military was interested in infantry weapons with a 1,500-meter range. To achieve desired range capabilities, the [...]338-caliber was chosen, specifically the [...]338 Norma Magnum over the [...]338 Lapua Magnum for several reasons including greater barrel life and a less tapered case for better use in a belt link. At 1,000 yd, the 7.62 NATO's velocity drops to about 1,000 ft/s; at that range, the [...]338NM travels at 2,000 ft/s and out to 1,100 yd, the round is capable of defeating Level III armor. A machine gun was then designed around the concept with Short Recoil Impulse Averaging technology, uses available subsystem components to keep cost down, and has a broad view 6-power scope to enable <b>point</b> <b>target</b> engagement out to 1,000-1,200 meters. Development of prototypes was entirely company-funded and took 12 months. The LWMMG was first unveiled on 15 May 2012 at the Joint Armaments Conference in Seattle, Washington.|$|E
5000|$|On November 1, 1911, Italian aviator Second Lieutenant Giulio Gavotti dropped four {{bombs on}} two Turkish-held oases in Libya, {{carrying}} out the world's first air strike {{as part of the}} Italo-Turkish War. The use of air strikes was extended in World War I. For example, at the Battle of Neuve Chapelle in 1915, the British dropped bombs on German rail communications. However, it was not until World War II that the Oxford English Dictionary first records usage of the term [...] "air strike," [...] which remained two separate words for some time thereafter. The Second World War also saw the first development of precision-guided munitions, which were fielded successfully by the Germans, and contributed to the modern sense of air [...] "strike," [...] a precision targeted attack as opposed to a strafing run or area bombing. The importance of precision targeting cannot be overstated: by some statistics, over a hundred raids were necessary to destroy a <b>point</b> <b>target</b> in World War 2; by the Persian Gulf War, the U.S. Air Force was able to release to media precise footage of television- or radar-guided bombs directly hitting the target without significant collateral damage (using, for example, the LANTIRN pod). Paul Fussell noted in his seminal work The Great War and Modern Memory the popular 20th century tendency to assume an errant bomb hitting a church, for example, was completely deliberate and reflective of the inherent evil of the enemy; over time, expectations for reduced collateral damage have increased to the point that developed countries engaging in war against less technologically advanced countries approach near-zero in terms of such damage and to a large degree, they have done so.|$|E

5000|$|The 300 AAC Blackout was {{designed}} to achieve energies similar to the 7.62×39mm Soviet in an AR-15 while using standard AR magazines at their full capacity. The 7.62 Soviet's cartridge taper prevented reliable feeding in AR magazines and created wear on the bolt. From the 14.5 in barrel of the M4 Carbine, the M855 5.56×45mm round has an effective <b>point</b> <b>target</b> range of 500 meters. The bullet has significant drop, drift, and energy loss at that distance. From a 16 in barrel, a 125 gr g 300 BLK round has a lower velocity and similar bullet drop and drift at shorter distances. However, {{it has the same}} amount of energy at 700 meters that the M855 has at 500 meters. In terms of hit probability, the Blackout has an effective range of 460 meters. From a 9 in barrel, the 125 gr BLK round has the same muzzle energy as the M855 from the M4, and 5 percent more energy at 440 meters. In comparison with 7.62×39mm rounds, 300 BLK rounds with varying loads have a better ballistic coefficient and more energy out of similar length barrels. 300 BLK rounds like the Barnes TAC 110 grain, have [...] "barrier blind" [...] performance, being capable of penetration through several inches of different hard targets. 300 BLK allows a user to have one firearm with the capability of switching between subsonic, supersonic VMAX or barrier penetrating ammunition all with just the change of a magazine. It is able to replace the H&K MP5 for close quarters, and with just a magazine change, bring the fight to longer distances, outperforming the M4 carbine. The [...]30 caliber cartridge has an 89.1 percent increase in frontal bullet area over the 5.56×45mm, and so leaves a larger wound cavity in soft targets. It also penetrates deeper and initially yaws faster. 300 BLK rounds are effective out of barrels as short as 4.5 in. Weapons chambered for the round can be as light, compact, and quiet when suppressed as submachine guns like the 9×19mm Luger MP5 and 4.6×30mm MP7 while having more energy and accuracy at longer range.|$|E
