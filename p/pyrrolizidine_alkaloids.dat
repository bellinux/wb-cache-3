25|$|<b>Pyrrolizidine</b> <b>alkaloids</b> (PAs) are {{the toxins}} the bella moth {{is able to}} ingest and use for {{protection}} from predators. They {{are known to be}} the principal toxins found in plants that can cause disease in humans and other animals. Reported pathways for human exposure include crop contamination, milk and honey contamination and some traditional herbal medicines. Once ingested, the alkaloids affect mainly the liver and the lungs. Human poisoning can cause veno-occlusive disease and teratogenicity.|$|E
25|$|During the larval stages, {{caterpillars}} feed on {{leguminous plants}} {{of the genus}} Crotalaria. These plants contain large amounts of toxins, particularly <b>pyrrolizidine</b> <b>alkaloids</b> (PAs), which are found in high concentrations in the seeds. Bella moth caterpillars sequester these toxins and use them as a deterrent for predators. Since PAs are an extremely valuable resource, individual larvae compete with one another to colonize an entire pod, an elongated seed-containing pouch from the food plant. Larvae that are unable to take ownership of a pod must obtain the chemicals from leaves, where they are found at much lower densities. These caterpillars sequester smaller amounts of PAs and {{are more susceptible to}} predation.|$|E
25|$|Members of this genus are leathery, {{tough to}} kill and fake death. Since they are {{unpleasant}} to smell and taste, they are soon released by the predators, recover and fly off soon thereafter. The butterfly sequesters toxins from its food plants of the family Asclepiadaceae. The butterflies also congregate with other danaiines to sip from the sap of Crotalaria, Heliotropium and other plants which provide the <b>pyrrolizidine</b> <b>alkaloids</b> which they sequester. A study in north-eastern India showed a preference to foraging on Crotalaria juncea compared to Bauhinia purpurea, Barleria cristata rosea and Nerium oleander. To advertise their unpalatability, the butterfly has prominent markings with a striking colour pattern. The striped tiger is mimicked by both sexes of the Indian Tamil lacewing (Cethosia nietneri mahratta) and the leopard lacewing (Cethosia cyane) and females of the common palmfly (Elymnias hypermnestra).|$|E

25|$|The {{spermatophore}} {{that males}} {{give to the}} females when mating contains sperm, nutrients, and <b>pyrrolizidine</b> <b>alkaloids</b> (PA), and accounts for up to 11% of the male's body mass. PA {{plays an important role}} in preventing predation in Utetheisa ornatrix because it is poisonous to most organisms. Males transmit PA to the females via a sperm package; the females then give this mating gift to the eggs, along with their own alkaloidal supplement and is utilized to protect the offspring from predation. In addition, females also personally benefit from the gift through protection and nutrition. After mating with a PA-rich male, the received PA is quickly allocated to all body parts. As a result, females become and remain unacceptable as prey to numerous organisms such as spiders. Another problem that females face is the risk of incurring a PA deficit due to the large amount of eggs they lay. Spermatophores is one way for females to compensate for this loss in PA.|$|E
25|$|More {{aggressive}} self-defense {{measures are}} taken by some caterpillars. These measures include having spiny bristles or long fine hair-like setae with detachable tips that will irritate by lodging {{in the skin}} or mucous membranes. However some birds (such as cuckoos) will swallow even the hairiest of caterpillars. Other caterpillars acquire toxins from their host plants that render them unpalatable to most of their predators. For instance, ornate moth caterpillars utilize <b>pyrrolizidine</b> <b>alkaloids</b> that they obtain from their food plants to deter predators. The most aggressive caterpillar defenses are bristles associated with venom glands. These bristles are called urticating hairs. A venom which {{is among the most}} potent defensive chemicals in any animal is produced by the South American silk moth genus Lonomia. Its venom is an anticoagulant powerful enough to cause a human to hemorrhage to death (See Lonomiasis). This chemical is being investigated for potential medical applications. Most urticating hairs range in effect from mild irritation to dermatitis.|$|E

2500|$|The {{digestion}} of {{this species}} is most remarkable in the larval stage.

2500|$|Many species retain distasteful or {{poisonous}} chemicals {{acquired from}} their host plants. Some species {{also have the}} ability to make their own defenses (Nishida, 2002). Common defenses include: cardiac glycosides (or cardenolides), <b>pyrrolizidine</b> <b>alkaloids,</b> pyrazines and histamines. Larvae usually acquire these chemicals, and may retain them in the adult stage. But adults can acquire them, too, by regurgitating decomposing plants containing the compounds and sucking up the fluid. Adults can transfer the defenses to their eggs, and males sometimes transfer them to females to help with defense of the eggs.

2500|$|Although most female moths mate multiply, {{very low}} {{instances}} of mixed paternities occur. [...] In fact, most progeny {{in a single}} clutch is sired exclusively by one male. Females of this species do not select based on age, mating order, between-mating interval, or duration of copulation. [...] Instead, female Utetheisa ornatix demonstrate female choice in mate selection that depends on body size, systemic content of defensive pyrrolizidine alkaloid, and glandular content of the courtship pheromone hydroxydanaidal. [...] Selecting for these males provides the females with multiple benefits such as obtaining sperm packages with more defensive <b>pyrrolizidine</b> <b>alkaloids</b> which results in larger offspring. Offspring fathered by larger males are generally less vulnerable to predation because of their higher alkaloid content, allowing the offspring to have higher viability and fitness.|$|E
