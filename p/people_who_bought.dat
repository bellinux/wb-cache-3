500|$|The Clash's politicised lyrics, musical experimentation, and rebellious {{attitude}} had a far-reaching {{influence on}} rock, and alternative rock in particular.

In January 2003, shortly {{after the death of}} Joe Strummer, the band—including original drummer Terry Chimes—were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In 2004, Rolling Stone Magazine ranked the Clash number 28 on its list of the 100 greatest artists of all time. Critic Sean Egan wrote that the Clash were exceptional because:They were a group whose music was, and is, special to their audience because that music insisted on addressing the conditions of poverty, petty injustice, and mundane life experienced by the <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>bought</b> their records. Moreover, although their rebel stances were often no more than posturing, from the Clash's stubborn principles came a fundamental change in the perception of what is possible in the music industry, from subject matter to authenticity to quality control to price ceilings.|$|E
500|$|The American third leg {{began in}} mid-August with shows at outdoor amphitheaters {{as well as}} indoor arenas.

Then on September 25, Max Weinberg took a two-month absence from the television show, to join Springsteen for the final portion of the leg. [...] Ticket sales were slower than normal on this leg, partly due to Ticketmaster's new [...] "paperless ticketing" [...] system that may have come into effect due to the earlier problems with Springsteen sales. [...] In arenas that did not sell well, management relocated the <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>bought</b> tickets behind the stage to other sections and put up the screen used for stadium and amphitheater shows behind the stage. [...] In a hint to fans to buy up, Van Zandt said, “You never know. This could be the last tour.

2500|$|Early {{editions of}} a book as popular and {{enduring}} as J. R. R. Tolkien's The Hobbit inevitably attract the attention and money of both book collectors and fans. Because a publisher cannot predict accurately how the public will receive a new author, they usually print a small first run and follow it with reprints as needed. Often this first run is called a [...] "first edition". Technically, however, the first edition spans not only the first printing but all printings until the type is reset. In the collectibles market, normally {{it is the first}} printing that commands the bulk of attention and money. That is because it was printed in small quantity and under risk of failure in the market. The <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>bought</b> the first copies pioneered the book's popularity, and those copies are considered precious. While {{the same is true of}} The Hobbit, the curious history of the book complicates and broadens the market considerably.|$|E

60|$|There {{were armed}} slaves. At {{the opening of}} the period of the Punic wars, in 264 B.C., the Etruscan sport of setting slaves to fight for their lives was revived in Rome.

And also there were learned slaves. The conquests of the later Republic were among the highly civilized cities of Greece, North Africa and Asia Minor; and they brought in many highly educated captives. The tutor of a young Roman of good family was usually a slave. A rich man would have a Greek slave as librarian, and slave secretaries and learned men. He would keep his poet as he would keep a performing dog. In this atmosphere of slavery the traditions of modern literary criticism were evolved. The slaves still boast and quarrel in our reviews.
