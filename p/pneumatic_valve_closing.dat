40|$|Purpose. Experimental {{research}} of technical state change in metal-metal sealing units of <b>pneumatic</b> <b>valve</b> with two-positioned polarized electromagnetic drive. Design/methodology/approach. It {{has been shown}} that the work peculiarity of <b>pneumatic</b> <b>valves</b> with two-positioned electromagnetic drive and with metal-metal sealing is shock loads during its closure and opening. Such loads lead to intensive wearing process and increasing of gas leakage through the sealing units of different design and made of different materials. It has been experimentally confirmed, that the effective way of wear intensiveness decreasing in metal-metal sealing units is the use of special damping units in the valve Findings. As a result of experimental research it was concluded that including in the valve design of special damping device reduces the stress in the sealing unit elements, which occurs in the sealing units elements during the <b>valve</b> <b>closing,</b> and, as a result, the wear intensiveness of the sealing unit decreases. Usage of less wear-resisting, comparatively to the stainless steel 08 ? 18 ? 10 ? materials leads to the increase of wear intensiveness of the sealing unit contact surfaces. Originality/value. Comparative analysis of the obtained experimental dependencies shows, that including of the damping device decreases the intensiveness of gas leakage increase through the <b>closed</b> <b>valve,</b> which occurs with the increase of the operational cycles. Damping element provides the kinetic energy dissipation that decreases the wear speed of the sealing surfaces of the valve slide and the saddle. ? ?????? ????????? ????????????????? ???????????? ????????? ???????????? ????????? ???????? ????? ???? ??????? ? ??????? ?????????????? ???????? ? ??????????????? ?????????????? ???????????????? ????????. ????????????, ??? ???????????? ???????????????? ????? ???????????????? ???????? ???????? ????????????? ??????? ???????? ?? ???????? ????????? ???? ??????? ??? ??? ????????, ??? ???????? ? ??????????? ????????? ?????? ? ?????????? ???????? ???? ????? ?????? ? ???????? ?????????. ???????????? ????????????????? ??????????? ?????????? ???????? ???? ????? ???????? ???? ??????? ?????????? ??????????????? ?????????? ? ?????????????? ????????? ??????????????? ??????????. ???????????????? ????????????, ??? ??????????? ???????? ?????????? ????????????? ?????? ????????? ????????? ???? ??????? ???? ??????? ? ??????? ???????? ?????????? ??????????? ???????????? ????????? ? ??????????? ???????...|$|R

40|$|Within {{the area}} of systems health management, the task of prognostics centers on {{predicting}} when components will fail. Model-based prognostics exploits domain knowledge of the system, its components, and how they fail by casting the underlying physical phenomena in a physics-based model that is derived from first principles. Uncertainty cannot be avoided in prediction, therefore, algorithms are employed that help in managing these uncertainties. The particle filtering algorithm has become a popular choice for model-based prognostics due to its wide applicability, ease of implementation, and support for uncertainty management. We develop a general modelbased prognostics methodology within a robust probabilistic framework using particle filters. As a case study, we consider a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>valve</b> from the Space Shuttle cryogenic refueling system.
