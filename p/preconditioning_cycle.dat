In the present study, we analyzed {{whether or not}} IP {{has an impact on}} mitochondrial function {{at the end of a}} sustained ischemic period. Göttinger minipigs were subjected to 90 -min low-flow ischemia without (n= 5) and with (n= 5) a <b>preconditioning</b> <b>cycle</b> of 10 -min ischemia and 15 -min reperfusion. Mitochondria were isolated from the ischemic or preconditioned anterior wall (AW) and the control posterior wall (PW) at the end of ischemia. Basal mitochondrial respiration was not different between AW and PW. The ADP-stimulated (state 3) respiration in AW mitochondria compared to PW mitochondria was equally decreased in non-preconditioned and preconditioned pigs. The uncoupled respiration as well as the membrane potential (rhodamine 123 fluorescence) were not significantly different between groups. However, the recovery of the membrane potential (Delta rhodamine 123 fluorescence/s) after the addition of ADP was delayed in mitochondria obtained from AW compared to PW, both in non-preconditioned and in preconditioned pig hearts. Neither the amount of marker proteins for complexes of the electron transport chain nor the level of reactive oxygen species were affected by ischemia without or with IP. State 3 respiration and recovery of membrane potential were impaired in pig mitochondria after 90 min of low-flow ischemia. IP did not improve mitochondrial function during ischemia. Therefore, the preservation of mitochondrial function by IP may occur during reperfusion rather than during the sustained ischemic period...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Connexin 43 (Cx 43) is {{involved}} in infarct size reduction by ischemic preconditioning (IP); the underlying mechanism of protection, however, is unknown. Since mitochondria have been proposed {{to be involved in}} IP's protection, the present study analyzed whether Cx 43 is localized at mitochondria of cardiomyocytes and whether such localization is affected by IP. METHODS AND RESULTS: Western blot analysis on mitochondrial preparations isolated from rat, mouse, pig, and human hearts showed the presence of Cx 43. The preparations were not contaminated with markers for other cell compartments. The localization of Cx 43 to mitochondria was also confirmed by FACS sorting (double staining with MitoTracker Red and Cx 43) and immuno-electron and confocal microscopy. To study the role of Cx 43 in IP, mitochondria were isolated from the ischemic anterior wall (AW) and the control posterior wall (PW) of pig myocardium at the end of 90 min low-flow ischemia without (n= 13) or with (n= 13) a preceding <b>preconditioning</b> <b>cycle</b> of 10 min ischemia and 15 min reperfusion. With IP, the mitochondrial Cx 43 /adenine nucleotide transporter ratio was 3. 4 +/- 0. 7 fold greater in AW than in PW, whereas the ratio remained unchanged in non-preconditioned myocardium (1. 1 +/- 0. 2, p< 0. 05). The enhancement of the mitochondrial Cx 43 protein level occurred rapidly, since an increase of mitochondrial Cx 43 was already detected with two cycles of 5 min ischemia/reperfusion in isolated rat hearts to 262 +/- 63 % of baseline. CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate that Cx 43 is localized at cardiomyocyte mitochondria and that IP enhances such mitochondrial localization...|$|E

One and three water-stress <b>preconditioning</b> <b>cycles</b> were imposed by withholding water, and the subsequent adjustment in solute potential upon relief of the stress and complete rehydration was monitored with thermocouple psychrometers. Both leaves and roots exhibited a substantial adjustment in ψs in response to water stress with the former exhibiting the larger absolute adjustment. The osmotic adjustment of leaves was 0. 41 megapascal compared to 0. 19 megapascal in the roots. The roots, however, exhibited much larger percentage osmotic adjustments of 46 and 63 % in the one and three stress cycles, respectively, compared to 22 and 40 % in the leaves in similar stress cycles. The osmotically adjusted condition of leaves and roots decreased after relief of the single cycle stress to about half the initial value within 3 days, and to the well-watered control level within 6 days.

Here we investigated the intramitochondrial localization of Cx 43, the mechanism of Cx 43 translocation to mitochondria and the effect of inhibiting translocation on the protection of preconditioning. Confocal microscopy of mitochondria devoid of the outer membrane and Western blotting on fractionated mitochondria showed that Cx 43 is located at the inner mitochondrial membrane, and coimmunoprecipita-tion of Cx 43 with Tom 20 (Translocase of the outer membrane 20) and with heat shock protein 90 (Hsp 90) indicated that it interacts with the regular mitochondrial protein import machinery. In isolated rat hearts, geldanamycin, a blocker of Hsp 90 -dependent translocation of proteins to the inner mitochondrial membrane through the TOM pathway, rapidly (15 minutes) reduced mitochondrial Cx 43 content by approximately one-third in the absence or presence of diazoxide. Geldanamycin alone had no effect on infarct size, but it ablated the protection against infarction afforded by diazoxide. Geldanamycin abolished the 2 -fold increase in mitochondrial Cx 43 induced by 2 <b>preconditioning</b> <b>cycles</b> of ischemia/reperfusion, but this effect was not associated with reduced protection. These results demonstrate that Cx 43 is transported to the inner mitochondrial membrane through translocation via the TOM complex and that a normal mitochondrial Cx 43 content is important for the diazoxide-related pathway of preconditioning.

40|$|Quantifying the {{mechanical}} properties of porcine aortic and mitral valve tissue Background: Valvular {{heart disease is}} a prevalent condition among the elderly and an emerging issue due to population aging. Current treatments include valve replacements and repair procedures. Our long term goal is the computational simulation of valve repair, requiring detailed knowledge of the material properties of human heart valves. To familiarize ourselves with new biaxial testing equipment and develop adequate processing methods, we focused here on porcine heart valves. Methods: The aortic and mitral valve leaflets from five pig hearts provided from a local abattoir were divided into: 1) Fresh tissues, processed within one day post mortem and 2) Fresh/frozen tissues, stored at − 18 °C prior to experimentation. Samples of 6. 5 × 6. 5 mm 2 were cut and mounted on a biaxial tissue tester (BioTester; CellScale, Waterloo, ON, Canada). Ten <b>preconditioning</b> <b>cycles</b> were carried out to elicit stable mechanical responses following nine displacementcontrolled protocols, each with different ratios of circumferential to radial displacements.

No significant difference was observed in {{the mechanical}} behaviour of the right, left and noncoronary aortic leaflets, while the anterior and posterior mitral leaflets behaved differently under similar loads.

The slow onset of VIIP, its chronic nature, and certain clinical features strongly suggest that biomechanical factors acting on the ONS play a role in VIIP. Here we measure several relevant ONS properties needed to model VIIP biomechanics. The ONS (meninges) of fresh porcine eyes (n 7) was reflected, the nerve proper was truncated near the sclera, and the meninges were repositioned to create a hollow cylinder of meningeal connective tissue attached to the posterior sclera. The distal end was cannulated, sealed, and pressure clamped (mimicking cerebrospinal fluid [CSF] pressure), while the eye was also cannulated for independent control of intraocular pressure (IOP). The meninges were inflated (CSF pressure cycling 7 - 50 mmHg) while ONS outer diameter was imaged. In another set of experiments (n 4), fluid permeation rate across the meninges was recorded by observing the drainage of an elevated fluid reservoir (30 mmHg) connected to the meninges. The ONS showed behavior typical of soft tissues: viscoelasticity, with hysteresis in early <b>preconditioning</b> <b>cycles</b> and repeatable behavior after 4 cycles, and nonlinear stiffening, particularly at CSF pressures 15 mmHg (Figure). Tangent moduli measured from the loading curve were 372 101, 1199 358, and 2050 379 kPa (mean SEM) at CSF pressures of 7, 15 and 30 mmHg, respectively. Flow rate measurements through the intact meninges at 30 mmHg gave a permeability of 1. 34 0. 46 lmincm 2 mmHg (mean SEM). The ONS is a tough, strain-stiffening connective tissue that is surprisingly permeable. The latter observation suggests that there could be significant CSF drainage through the ONS into the orbit, likely important for CSF transport in the optic nerve. These experimental measurements, extended to human eyes, are informing computational models of the pathophysiology and biomechanics of the ONS in VIIP syndrome...|$|R

40|$|Collagen fiber re-alignment and {{uncrimping}} are postulated {{mechanisms of}} structural response to load. It {{has been suggested}} that fibers re-orient in the direction of load and then 2 ̆ 2 uncrimp 2 ̆ 2 before collagen is tensioned and that in general, the structure {{is a result of the}} function tendons perform. However, little is known about how fiber re-alignment and uncrimping change in response to load, how this change relates to tendon mechanical properties, and if these changes are dependent on the underlying structure. Throughout postnatal development, dramatic structural and compositional changes occur in tendon. Postnatal tendons, with immature collagen networks, may respond to load in a different manner and timescale than mature collagen networks. Therefore, the overall objective of this study was to quantify the mechanical properties and structural response to load in a developmental mouse tendon model at 4, 10, 28 and 90 days old. Local collagen fiber re-alignment and crimp frequency were quantified throughout mechanical testing and local mechanical properties were measured. Throughout development, fiber re-alignment occurred at different points in the mechanical testing protocol. At early development, re-alignment was not identified until the linear (4 days) or toe-regions (10 days) of the mechanical test suggesting that fibers required a prolonged exposure to mechanical load before responding and that the immature collagen network present may delay re-alignment. The uncrimping of collagen fibers was identified during the toe-region of the mechanical test at all ages suggesting that crimp contributes to tendon nonlinear behavior. Additionally, results at 28 and 90 days suggested that collagen fiber crimp frequency decreased with increasing number of <b>preconditioning</b> <b>cycles,</b> which may affect toe-region properties. Mechanical properties and cross-sectional area increased throughout development. The insertion site demonstrated lower moduli values and a more disorganized fiber distribution compared to the midsubstance at all ages suggesting it experiences multi-axial loads. Further, the tendon locations demonstrated different re-alignment and crimp behaviors suggesting that locations may respond to load differently and develop at different rates. Results from this study suggest that structure affects the tendon 2 ̆ 7 s ability to respond to load and that the loading protocol applied may affect the measurement of mechanical properties. ...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} was to determine whether hypothermia during the ischemic preconditioning period attenuates the protective effect of ischemic preconditioning. Methods: Experiments were performed in buffer-perfused isolated rabbit hearts. All hearts underwent 45 minutes of regional ischemia, followed by 2 hours of reperfusion. Ischemic preconditioning was elicited by either one or four periods of 5 minutes of regional ischemia. Hypothermia (25 ° C) was induced beginning either 20 or 50 minutes before the 45 -minute period of regional ischemia; normothermia (38 ° C) was restored 10 minutes before the 45 -minute period of regional ischemia. Except for the hypothermic periods noted, hearts were maintained at 38 ° C. Results: Normothermic ischemic preconditioning with either one or four cycles of 5 minutes of coronary occlusion resulted in a profound reduction of infarct size (58 % reduction with one cycle, p < 0. 05; 95 % reduction with four cycles, p < 0. 01).

Using a porcine model of warm ischemia-reperfusion-induced AKI (40 -min bilateral cross-clamping of renal arteries, 48 -h reperfusion), we examined the renoprotective efficacy of EPO (1, 000 iu/kg iv.) or remote ischemic <b>preconditioning</b> (3 <b>cycles,</b> 5 -min inflation/deflation to 200 mmHg of a hindlimb sphygmomanometer cuff). Ischemia-reperfusion induced significant kidney injury at 24 and 48 h (χ 2, 1 degree of freedom, > 10 for 6 / 7 histopathological features). At 2 h, a panel of biomarkers including plasma creatinine, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, and IL- 1 β, and urinary albumin:creatinine {{could be used to}} predict histopathological injury. Ischemia-reperfusion increased cell proliferation and apoptosis in the renal cortex but, for pretreated groups, the apoptotic cells were predominantly intratubular rather than interstitial. At 48 -h reperfusion, plasma IL- 1 β and the number of subcapsular cells in G 2 -M arrest were reduced after preoperative EPO, but not after remote ischemic preconditioning. These data suggest an intrarenal mechanism acting within cortical cells that may underpin a renoprotective function for preoperative EPO and, to a limited extent, remote ischemic preconditioning. Despite equivocal longer-term outcomes in clinical studies investigating EPO as a renoprotective agent in AKI, optimal clinical dosing and administration have not been established. Our data suggest further clinical studies on the potential renoprotective effect of EPO and remote ischemic preconditioning are justified...|$|R
40|$|It {{is known}} that initial loading curves of soft {{biological}} tissues are substantially different from subsequent loadings. The later loading curves are generally used for assessing the mechanical properties of a tissue, and the first loading cycles, referred to as preconditioning, are omitted. However, slow viscoelastic phenomena related to fluid flow or collagen viscoelasticity are initiated during these first <b>preconditioning</b> loading <b>cycles</b> and may persist during the actual data collection. When these data are subsequently used for fitting of material properties, the viscoelastic phenomena {{that occurred during the}} initial cycles are not accounted for. The aim of the present study is to explore whether the above phenomena are significant for articular cartilage, by evaluating the effect of such time-dependent phenomena by means of computational modeling. Results show that under indentation, collagen viscoelasticity dominates the time-dependent behavior. Under UC, fluid-dependent effects are more important. Interestingly, viscoelastic and poroelastic effects may act in opposite directions and may cancel each other out in a stress-strain curve. Therefore, equilibrium may be apparent in a stress-strain relationship, even though internally the tissue is not in equilibrium. Also, the time-dependent effects of viscoelasticity and poroelasticity may reinforce each other, resulting in a sustained effect that lasts longer than suggested by their individual effects. Finally, the results illustrate that data collected from a mechanical test may depend on the preconditioning protocol. In conclusion, preconditioning influences the mechanical response of articular cartilage significantly and therefore cannot be neglected when determining the mechanical properties. To determine the full viscoelastic and poroelastic properties of articular cartilage requires fitting to both preconditioning and post-preconditioned loading cycles...|$|R

40|$|Cell cycle checkpoints {{activated}} by DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) {{are essential for}} the maintenance of the genomic integrity of proliferating cells. Following DNA damage, cells must detect the break and either transiently block cell cycle progression, to allow time for repair, or exit the cell cycle. Reversal of a DNA-damage-induced checkpoint not only requires the repair of these lesions, but a cell must also prevent permanent exit from the cell cycle and actively terminate checkpoint signalling to allow cell cycle progression to resume. It is becoming increasingly clear that despite the shared mechanisms of DNA damage detection throughout the cell cycle, the checkpoint and its reversal are precisely tuned to each cell cycle phase. Furthermore, recent findings challenge the dogmatic view that complete repair is a <b>precondition</b> for cell <b>cycle</b> resumption. In this Commentary, we highlight cell-cycle-dependent differences in checkpoint signalling and recovery after a DNA DSB, and summarise the molecular mechanisms that underlie the reversal of DNA damage checkpoints, before discussing when and how cell fate decisions after a DSB are made...|$|R

We investigated {{the effect of}} ischemic preconditioning on mitogen-activated protein kinases (extracellular signal-regulated kinases I and 2, C-Jun N-terminal kinases, p 38 mitogen-activated kinase) and heat shock protein 27 phosphorylation in diabetic and nondiabetic rat hearts in vivo. Two groups of anaesthetized nondiabetic and diabetic rats underwent a <b>preconditioning</b> protocol (3 <b>cycles</b> of 3 min coronary artery occlusion and 5 min of reperfusion). Two further groups served as untreated controls. Hearts were excised for protein measurements by Western blot. Four additional groups underwent 25 min of coronary occlusion followed by 2 h of reperfusion to induce myocardial infarction. In these animals, infarct size was measured. IPC reduced infarct size in the nondiabetic rats {{but not in the}} diabetic animals. In diabetic rats, IPC induced phosphorylation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases and of heat shock protein 27. We conclude that protection by IPC is blocked by diabetes mellitus in the rat heart in vivo without affecting phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases or heat shock protein 27. Therefore, the blockade mechanism of diabetes mellitus is downstream of mitogen-activated kinases and heat shock protein 2...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the thermal fatigue {{reliability}} of fine pitch flip-chip BGA packages employing multi-layer organic built-up substrates with an integral heat spreader. For high density FPGA devices, the die size and package footprint are larger than the prevailing industry standard, this poses a significant challenge for meeting component level temperature cycle condition B (- 55 ˚C to + 125 ˚C) reliability requirements. Finite element modeling (FEM) is a key component for identifying high stress regions and identifying solutions to long term reliability problems. FEM was used to study two different material combinations where the heat spreader/stiffener attach adhesive and thermal interface materials (TIM) were changed. Temperature cycle tests were performed on both material sets. A secondary goal {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effects of the substrate land pad geometry and moisture <b>preconditioning.</b> The temperature <b>cycle</b> test lots were built with both solder mask defined (SMD) and non-solder mask defined (NSMD) pads and the test lots were subjected to two different levels of moisture preconditioning (JEDEC levels 3 and 4).

40|$|AbstractObjectives. We {{sought to}} {{determine}} whether the cardioprotective effects of ischemic preconditioning can be reinstated once they are lost in a rat model of coronary occlusion. Background. We have shown in a previous study that the cardioprotective effects of preconditioning are lost if there is a time lag (≥ 1 h) between the preconditioning and sustained coronary occlusion events in the rat. However, whether the beneficial effects of preconditioning can be regained once they are lost in this model is unknown. Methods. Twenty-eight rats were randomized to one of four groups. Group 1 (control group) underwent 90 min of coronary occlusion without preconditioning. Group 2 had <b>preconditioning</b> (three <b>cycles</b> of 3 min of coronary occlusion and 5 min of reperfusion) that was immediately followed by 90 min of coronary occlusion. In group 3, 90 min of occlusion was delayed by 1 h after preconditioning. In group 4, preconditioning was repeated 1 h after a first preconditioning sequence, followed by 90 min of occlusion. After 4 h of reperfusion, the area at risk was delineated by intravenous injection of blue dye during a brief coronary occlusion, and the area of necrosis was determined by the triphenyltetrazolium chloride technique. Results. Myocardial infarct size, expressed as a percent of the anatomic area at risk in groups 1 and 3 averaged 44. 1 ± 6. 9 % (mean ± SEM) and 49. 9 ± 6. 9 %, respectively. In contrast, groups 2 and 4 (12. 1 ± 3. 2 % and 10. 1 ± 2. 6 %, respectively) had a significantly smaller infarct size (p < 0. 01 vs. groups 1 and 3). The incidence of ventricular tachycardia during the 90 min of coronary occlusion in both groups 2 and 4 (14. 3 %, p < 0. 005 and 28. 6 %, p < 0. 05, respectively) was significantly lower than in groups 1 and 3 (100 % in both groups). Conclusions. Repeat preconditioning at 1 h was capable of recapturing the cardioprotective effects of preconditioning on both infarct size and ventricular arrhythmia...|$|R
40|$|Bonding {{is a very}} {{important}} issue when FRP plates or sheets are used to strengthen R. C. beams. It depends on the mechanical and physical properties of concrete, composite and adhesive. Few studies {{can be found on the}} effect of these degrading actions, when they occur as cyclic events and not as steady state actions. The exposition to deicing salts or freeze-thaw cycles may in fact deteriorate the mechanical properties of FRP, adhesive and concrete substrate. Due to the lack of information, the design rules against the effect of aggressive environment are currently very conservative, even in recent recommendations. The present experimental study is a preliminary investigation of a quite wide research program aimed at the definition of the basic correlations between degradation phenomena and changes in mechanical parameters of the FRP-concrete bonding (fracture energy, peak shear stress, etc). A number of specimens have been <b>preconditioned</b> by thermal <b>cycles</b> and/or immersion in salt-spray fog environment. Then, pull-push debonding tests have been performed under standard conditions.

40|$|Ischemic {{preconditioning}} (IPC) inhibits Ca²⁺‐loading during ischemia which {{contributes to}} cardioprotection by inhibiting mechanical injury due to hypercontracture and biochemical injury through mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) pores during reperfusion. However, whether remote‐IPC reduced Ca²⁺‐loading during ischemia and its subsequent involvement in inhibiting MPT pore formation during reperfusion {{has not been}} directly shown. We have developed a cellular model of remote IPC {{to look at the}} impact of remote conditioning on Ca²⁺‐regulation and MPT pore opening during simulated ischemia and reperfusion, using fluorescence microscopy. Ventricular cardiomyocytes were isolated from control rat hearts, hearts <b>preconditioned</b> with three <b>cycles</b> of ischemia/reperfusion or naïve myocytes remotely conditioned with effluent collected from preconditioned hearts. Both conventional‐IPC and remote‐IPC reduced the loss of Ca²⁺‐homeostasis and contractile function following reenergization of metabolically inhibited cells and protected myocytes against ischemia/reperfusion injury. However, only conventional‐IPC reduced the Ca²⁺‐loading during metabolic inhibition and this was independent of any change in sarcKATP channel activity but was associated with a reduction in Na⁺‐loading, reflecting a decrease in Na/H exchanger activity. Remote‐IPC delayed opening of the MPT pores in response to ROS, which was dependent on PKCε and NOS‐signaling. These data show that remote‐IPC inhibits MPT pore opening to a similar degree as conventional IPC, however, the contribution of MPT pore inhibition to protection against reperfusion injury is independent of Ca²⁺‐loading in remote IPC. We suggest that inhibition of the MPT pore and not Ca²⁺‐loading is the common link in cardioprotection between conventional and remote IPC. Peer-reviewedPublisher Versio...|$|R
40|$|Ischemic {{preconditioning}} {{has been}} acknowledged {{as a powerful}} method of decreasing ischemic injury. However, the antiarrhythmic mechanism of ischemic preconditioning during ischemia is unclear. We studied the effects of ischemic preconditioning on arrhythmias and cardiac electrophysiology during ischemia in Langendorff rat hearts (n = 44). In the non-preconditioned group (PC(-); n = 24), the hearts underwent 5 -min zero-flow global ischemia without any prior ischemic preconditioning. In the preconditioned group (PC(+); n = 20), the hearts were <b>preconditioned</b> by three <b>cycles</b> of 3 -min zero-flow global ischemia and 5 -min reperfusion before undergoing 5 -min global ischemia. Ischemic preconditioning reduced the incidence of ischemia-induced arrhythmias (PC(-); 38. 9 %, PC(+) : 8. 3 %, p < 0. 05), shortened monophasic action potential duration (MAPD, P < 0. 05), attenuated conduction delay (conduction time; PC(-) : 234. 2 %, PC(+) : 173. 4 %, P < 0. 05) and increased the ventricular fibrillation threshold. Although the shortening of MAPD in PC(-) hearts was not influenced by {{the presence or absence}} of arrhythmias, conduction time prolongation at 3 -min was more obvious in PC(-) hearts with arrhythmia than in PC(-) hearts without arrhythmia (PC(-) with arrhythmia: 220. 2 %, PC(-) without arrhythmia: 190. 7 %, P < 0. 05). We concluded that ischemic preconditioning could protect the rat hearts from ischemia-induced arrhythmias and postulated that attenuation of conduction delay during ischemia might be an important factor in the antiarrhythmic action of ischemic preconditioning...|$|R
40|$|AbstractNumerous {{studies show}} that {{pharmacological}} inhibition of p 38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (p 38 s) before lethal ischemia prevents conditioning. However, these inhibitors have off-target effects and do not discriminate between the alpha and beta isoforms; the activation of which {{is thought to have}} diverse and perhaps opposing actions with p 38 α aggravating, and p 38 β reducing, myocardial injury. We adopted a chemical genetic approach using mice in which either the p 38 α (DRα) or p 38 β (DRβ) alleles were targeted to substitute the “gatekeeper” threonine residue for methionine, thereby preventing the binding of a pharmacological inhibitor, SB 203580. Isolated, perfused wild-type (WT), DRα and DRβ mouse hearts underwent ischemic <b>preconditioning</b> with 4 <b>cycles</b> of 4 min ischemia/ 6 min reperfusion, with or without SB 203580 (10 µM), followed by 30 min of global ischemia and 120 min of reperfusion. In WT and DRβ hearts, SB 203580 completely abolished the reduction in myocardial infarction seen with preconditioning and also the phosphorylation of downstream substrates of p 38. These effects of SB 203580 were not seen in DRα hearts. Furthermore ischemic preconditioning occurred unaltered in p 38 β null hearts. Contrary to expectation the activation of p 38 α, and not p 38 β, is necessary for ischemic preconditioning. Since p 38 α is also the isoform that leads to lethal myocardial injury, it is unlikely that targeted therapeutic strategies to achieve isoform-selective inhibition will only prevent the harmful consequences of activation...|$|R
