25|$|Another way {{to create}} a {{catalytic}} Baeyer–Villiger oxidation is by using enzymes as the catalyst. Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenases (BVMOs) use dioxygen to perform the Baeyer–Villiger oxidation. These enzymes are capable of enantioselective oxidations of <b>prochiral</b> substrates.|$|E
25|$|Aminotransferase enzymes {{can be used}} to {{synthesize}} chiral amines in non-racemic form either through kinetic resolution of a racemate or reductive amination of a <b>prochiral</b> ketone.

25|$|There {{have been}} {{attempts}} to use organometallic catalysts to perform enantioselective Baeyer–Villiger oxidations. The first reported instance {{of one such}} oxidation of a <b>prochiral</b> ketone used dioxygen as the oxidant with a copper catalyst.

25|$|In 1987, E. J. Corey and {{co-workers}} {{found out that}} the formation of oxazaborolidines from borane and chiral amino alcohols. And the oxazaborolidines were found to catalyze the rapid and highly enantioselective reduction of <b>prochiral</b> ketones in the presence of BH3THF. This enantioselective reduction of achiral ketones with catalytic oxazaborolidine is called Corey–Bakshi–Shibata reduction or CBS reduction.|$|E
25|$|As in {{hydrogenation}} {{reactions of}} other functional groups, the reductant in C=N hydrogenations is either hydrogen gas or a transfer hydrogenation reductant such as formic acid. The process is usually catalyzed by {{a transition metal}} complex. If the complex is chiral and non-racemic and the substrate is <b>prochiral,</b> an excess of a single enantiomer of a chiral product can result.|$|E
25|$|In 1981, Hirao and {{co-workers}} {{have found that}} asymmetric reduction of <b>prochiral</b> armomatic ketones with chiral amino alcohols and borane afforded the corresponding secondary alcohols with 60% ee. They {{found out that the}} chiral amino alcohols would react with borane to form aloxyl-amine-borane complexes. The complexes are proposed to contain a relatively rigid five member-ring system which makes them thermal and hydrolytic stable and soluble {{in a wide variety of}} protic and aprotic solvents.|$|E
500|$|When {{bound in}} the active site of an oxidoreductase, the {{nicotinamide}} ring of the coenzyme is positioned {{so that it can}} accept a hydride from the other substrate. Depending on the enzyme, the hydride donor is positioned either [...] "above" [...] or [...] "below" [...] the plane of the planar C4 carbon, as defined in the figure. Class A oxidoreductases transfer the atom from above; class B enzymes transfer it from below. Since the C4 carbon that accepts the hydrogen is <b>prochiral,</b> this can be exploited in enzyme kinetics to give information about the enzyme's mechanism. This is done by mixing an enzyme with a substrate that has deuterium atoms substituted for the hydrogens, so the enzyme will reduce NAD by transferring deuterium rather than hydrogen. In this case, an enzyme can produce one of two stereoisomers of NADH.|$|E
2500|$|Electrophilic {{fluorination}} rely on {{sources of}} [...] "F+". [...] Often such reagents feature N-F bonds, for example F-TEDA-BF4. [...] Asymmetric fluorination, whereby {{only one of}} two possible enantiomeric products are generated from a <b>prochiral</b> substrate, rely on electrophilic fluorination reagents.

2500|$|Acetaldehyde is {{a common}} {{electrophile}} in organic synthesis. In condensation reactions, acetaldehyde is <b>prochiral.</b> It is used primarily {{as a source of}} the [...] "CH3C+H(OH)" [...] synthon in aldol and related condensation reactions. Grignard reagents and organolithium compounds react with MeCHO to give hydroxyethyl derivatives. In one of the more spectacular condensation reactions, three equivalents of formaldehyde add to MeCHO to give pentaerythritol, C(CH2OH)4.|$|E
2500|$|Such {{reactions}} usually involve an aqueous acidic workup, {{though this}} step is rarely shown in reaction schemes. [...] In cases where the Grignard reagent is adding to an aldehyde or a <b>prochiral</b> ketone, the Felkin-Anh model or Cram's Rule can usually predict which stereoisomer will be formed. [...] With easily deprotonated 1,3-diketones and related acidic substrates, the Grignard reagent RMgX functions merely as a base, giving the enolate anion and liberating the alkane RH.|$|E
2500|$|Homogeneous {{catalysts}} {{are also}} used in asymmetric synthesis by the hydrogenation of <b>prochiral</b> substrates. [...] An early demonstration of this approach was the Rh-catalyzed hydrogenation of enamides as precursors to the drug L-DOPA. To achieve asymmetric reduction, these catalyst are made chiral by use of chiral diphosphine ligands. Rhodium catalyzed hydrogenation has also {{been used in the}} herbicide production of S-metolachlor, which uses a Josiphos type ligand (called Xyliphos). [...] In principle asymmetric hydrogenation can be catalyzed by chiral heterogeneous catalysts, but this approach remains more of a curiosity than a useful technology.|$|E
2500|$|Acyclic {{unsaturated}} substrates (olefins, ketones, enamines imines) represents {{the most common}} <b>prochiral</b> substrates. Substrates that are particularly amenable to asymmetric hydrogenation often feature a polar functional group adjacent to the site to be hydrogenates. [...] In the absence of this functional) group, catalysis often results in low ee's. [...] For unfunctionalized olefins, iridium with P,N-based ligands) have proven successful catalysts. Catalyst utility within this category is unusually narrow; consequently, many different categories of solved and unsolved catalytic problems have developed. 1,1-disubstituted, 1,2-diaryl trisubstituted, 1,1,2-trialkyl and tetrasubstituted olefins represent classes that have been investigated separately, and even within these classes variations may exist that make different solutions optimal.|$|E
2500|$|The {{preference}} for producing one enantiomer instead of another in these reactions is often {{explained in terms}} of steric interactions between the ligand and the <b>prochiral</b> substrate. [...] Consideration of these interactions has {{led to the development of}} quadrant diagrams where [...] "blocked" [...] areas are denoted with a shaded box, while [...] "open" [...] areas are left unfilled. [...] In the modeled reaction, large groups on an incoming olefin will tend to orient to fill the open areas of the diagram, while smaller groups will be directed to the blocked areas and hydrogen delivery will then occur to the back face of the olefin, fixing the stereochemistry. [...] Note that only part of the chiral phosphine ligand is shown for the sake of clarity.|$|E

5000|$|Crotonaldehyde is a {{multifunctional}} molecule that exhibits diverse reactivity. It is {{an excellent}} <b>prochiral</b> dienophile. [...] It is a Michael acceptor. Addition of methylmagnesium chloride affords 3-penten-2-ol.|$|E
50|$|Although achiral, {{glycerol}} is <b>prochiral</b> {{with respect}} to reactions {{of one of the}} two primary alcohols. Thus, in substituted derivatives, the stereospecific numbering labels each carbon as either sn-1, sn-2, or sn-3.|$|E
50|$|In stereochemistry, <b>prochiral</b> {{molecules}} {{are those}} that can be converted from achiral to chiral in a single step. An achiral species which {{can be converted to}} a chiral in two steps is called proprochiral.|$|E

50|$|Hydroformylation of <b>prochiral</b> alkenes creates new stereocenters. Using chiral {{phosphine}} ligands, the hydroformylation can {{be tailored}} to favor one enantiomer.

50|$|Isotetramantane (C22H28). Triamantane {{has eight}} faces on {{to which a}} new C4H4 unit can be added {{resulting}} in four isomers. One of these isomers displays a helical twist and is therefore <b>prochiral.</b> The P and M enantiomers have been separated.|$|E
5000|$|In this way, chiral phosphines such as chiraphos, DIPAMP, and DIOP {{have been}} {{attached}} to Rh.

50|$|Most alkenes are <b>prochiral,</b> {{meaning in}} this context that their hydrocyanation generates chiral nitriles. Conventional hydrocyanation catalysts, e.g. Ni(P(OR)3)4, {{catalyse}} the formation of racemic mixtures, consisting of equal amounts of the two enantiomeric nitriles. When however the supporting ligands are chiral, the hydrocyanation can be highly enantioselective. For asymmetric hydrocyanation, popular chiral ligands are chelating aryl diphosphite complexes.|$|E
50|$|Ketones are {{classified}} {{on the basis}} of their substituents. One broad classification subdivides ketones into symmetrical and asymmetrical derivatives, depending on the equivalency of the two organic substituents attached to the carbonyl center. Acetone and benzophenone (C6H5C(O)C6H5) are symmetrical ketones. Acetophenone (C6H5C(O)CH3) is an asymmetrical ketone. In the area of stereochemistry, asymmetrical ketones are known for being <b>prochiral.</b>|$|E
50|$|Somewhat {{like the}} parent amines, imines are mildly basic and {{reversibly}} protonate to give iminium salts.
