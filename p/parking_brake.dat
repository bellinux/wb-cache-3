5|$|During {{the course}} of the evaluation, the Tri-partite pilots {{developed}} a typical sortie routine for the Kestrel of conducting short take-offs (STO) and returning to base on vertical landings. This manner of operation (STOVL) was judged to be the optimal practice. Operating from rough airstrips was also trialled at nearby RAF Bircham Newton, where the aircraft proved adept at traversing boggy ground and taking off from a variety of temporary ground coverings. During testing one aircraft was lost when a pilot tried to do a rolling take-off with the <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> on; the evaluations were finalised in November 1965.|$|E
5|$|Aurion {{takes its}} doors, windows, roof panels, body sides (except front quarters) from the Camry XV40. However, the other panels are unique {{from the regular}} Camry. This {{component}} sharing also means that Aurion has the same wheelbase, front and rear axle tracks, and interior dimensions. Interior design also largely parallels the Camry. Notable differences include the redesigned upper dashboard portion and restyled centre console, plus the substitution of the Australian Camry's hand-operated <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> with a foot-operated equivalent (as shared with the Camry for Japan and North America). The reasoning behind this component sharing strategy was to reduce costs and to allow the car to be built alongside the Camry, thus simplifying the manufacturing process.|$|E
25|$|Power {{operated}} parking brakes are {{fitted to}} heavy commercial vehicles with air brakes, such as trucks and buses. These are usually spring applied, with air pressure {{being used to}} hold the brake off and powerful springs holding the brakes on. In most cases, a small lever in the cab is connected to a valve which can admit air to the <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> cylinders to release the <b>parking</b> <b>brake,</b> or release the air to apply the brake. On some modern vehicles the valve is operated electrically from a lever or button in the cab. The system is relatively safe since if air pressure is lost the springs will apply the brakes. Also, the system prevents the <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> being released if there is insufficient air pressure to apply the foot brake. A disadvantage to this system {{is that if a}} vehicle requires towing and cannot provide its own air supply, an external supply must be provided to allow the <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> to be released, or the brake shoes must be manually wound off against the springs.|$|E

25|$|Large {{vehicles}} are usually fitted with power operated or power assisted parking brakes. Power assisted parking brakes are usually found on large vans {{as well as}} some older heavy vehicles. These operate {{in the same way as}} a conventional parking brakes, but pulling the lever operates a valve that allows air or hydraulic pressure or vacuum into a cylinder which applies force to the brake shoes and makes applying the <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> easier. When releasing the <b>parking</b> <b>brake,</b> the same mechanism also provides assistance to the driver in disengaging the ratchet. Particularly on commercial vehicles with air operated brakes, this has the added benefit of making it much harder or even impossible to release the <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> when insufficient air pressure is available to operate the brakes. A reservoir or accumulator is usually provided so a limited amount of power assistance is available with the engine off.|$|E
25|$|The {{bucket seat}} option {{introduced}} on Electra 225 convertibles in 1959 was now available on Electra coupes and included a center consolette with storage compartment.

50|$|Apart from {{performing}} the basic vehicle holding function required of <b>park</b> <b>brakes,</b> the EPB systems provide other functions like automatic {{release of the}} <b>park</b> <b>brakes</b> when the driver presses the accelerator, and re-clamping using additional force on detection of vehicle motion. Further, the hill-hold function, which applies brakes to prevent roll-back when pulling away on a gradient, can also be implemented using the EPB.|$|R
25|$|In {{vehicles}} with rear disc brakes, the <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> either actuates the disc calipers (again, with much less force) {{or a small}} drum brake housed within the hub assembly (the inner circumference of the disc is often used instead of a separate drum).|$|E

25|$|The first 800 {{units were}} sent in reverse with a lever; all units after that were sent in reverse with a pedal between the clutch and brake pedals. The middle pedal {{was used to}} engage reverse gear when the car was in neutral. The right pedal {{operated}} the transmission brake â€“ there were no brakes on the wheels. The floor lever also controlled the <b>parking</b> <b>brake,</b> which was activated by pulling the lever all the way back. This doubled as an emergency brake.|$|E
25|$|Disc brakes {{were most}} popular on sports cars {{when they were}} first introduced, since these {{vehicles}} are more demanding about brake performance. Discs have now become the more common form in most passenger vehicles, although many (particularly light weight vehicles) use drum brakes on the rear wheels to keep costs and weight down as well as to simplify the provisions for a <b>parking</b> <b>brake.</b> As the front brakes perform most of the braking effort, this can be a reasonable compromise.|$|E
25|$|The trams had {{a primary}} dynamic braking {{controlled}} through 12 stages.

40|$|Purpose. Clear and {{uninterrupted}} {{operation of}} humps {{depends on the}} quality of technical equipment and control technology of cuts speed. Technology of interval and purposive regulation of cuts speed is used at most humps. The article discusses ways to reduce the cuts rolling speed to a safe level {{at the beginning of the}} sorting sidings equipped with quasi-continuous speed control system. Methodology. It proposed three fundamentally different ways to reduce the cuts rolling speed at the beginning of the sorting siding. The analysis of the ways to reduce cuts rolling speed to a safe level at the beginning of the sorting sidings was conducted using simulation the process of cuts rolling from humps equipped with quasi-continuous speed control. Findings. As a result of analysis, the inappropriateness of opposite elevation using on the roll-out part of the hump after the last separation switch point. Spot regulators of cars speed can be used to reduce the cuts rolling speed at the beginning of the sorting siding, but this leads to a division conditions deterioration on the last separating switch points of long cuts with the following after them short cuts. Reducing the cuts rolling speed at the beginning of the sorting siding can be carried out using the beam on a stationary wagon retarders <b>park</b> <b>brake</b> position. Control Algorithm <b>park</b> <b>brake</b> position is quite simple. All produce should be unhooked from it at a safe speed. If the accuracy of the implementation of the set speed output to unhook from the <b>park</b> <b>brake</b> position is low, it is possible to eliminate the error of point regulators cars speed.

Buick dropped the Riviera name as a body style designation after the 1963 model year, shifting the Riviera name exclusively to Buick's new personal luxury coupe that had been introduced in 1963. Buick added a 7-way tilt steering wheel and a new cruise control as an option.|$|E
25|$|The Bel Air, {{which had}} been the top line series since 1953, was now the middle range. Wagons were still classed by themselves, but had model numbers {{matching}} the car series. Parkwood 6-passenger and Kingswood 9-passenger wagons had Bel Air's model number, and as such were the middle range wagons. Under the hood, little change took place. A variety of speed options, such as fuel injection, special cams and lowered compression, gave horsepower ratings up to 315. Bel Air production was 447,100. The new Impala line surpassed Bel Air production by 20,000 units. A <b>parking</b> <b>brake</b> warning light was optional.|$|E
