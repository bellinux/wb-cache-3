5|$|In May 2007, YouTube {{launched}} its Partner Program, a {{system based on}} AdSense which allows the uploader of the video to share the revenue produced by advertising on the site. YouTube typically takes 45 percent of the advertising revenue from videos in the Partner Program, with 55 percent going to the uploader. There are over a million members of the YouTube Partner Program. According to TubeMogul, in 2013 a pre-roll advertisement on YouTube (one that is shown before the video starts) cost advertisers on average $7.60 per 1000 views. Usually no {{more than half of}} eligible videos have a pre-roll advertisement, {{due to a lack of}} interested advertisers. In 2013, YouTube introduced an option for channels with at least a thousand subscribers to require a paid subscription in order for viewers to watch videos. YouTube Play Buttons, a part of the YouTube Creator Rewards, are a recognition by YouTube of its most popular channels. The trophies made of nickel plated copper-nickel alloy, golden <b>plated</b> <b>brass,</b> silver plated metal and ruby are given to channels with at least one hundred thousand, a million, ten million and fifty million views, respectively.|$|E

Other less common variants are the all-metal whistle, the PVC whistle, the Flanna square holed whistle, and the wooden whistle.|$|E
50|$|Calamine brass was {{produced}} using proportions of two-sevenths fine copper, four-sevenths calamine, and one-seventh shruff (old <b>plate</b> <b>brass).</b> Calamine brass {{was the first}} type of brass produced, probably starting during the 1st millennium BC, and was not replaced in Europe by other brass manufactures until the 18th century (it is likely that Indian brass manufacturers had developed more advanced techniques some centuries earlier).|$|R

60|$|So {{they went}} up across the square, and {{wondered}} still more as they went; for along the quays lay in order great cables, and yards, and masts, before the fair temple of Poseidon, the blue-haired king of the seas. And round the square worked the ship-wrights, as many in number as ants, twining ropes, and hewing timber, and smoothing long yards and oars. And the Minuai went on in silence through clean white marble streets, till {{they came to the}} hall of Alcinous, and they wondered then still more. For the lofty palace shone aloft in the sun, with walls of <b>plated</b> <b>brass,</b> from the threshold to the innermost chamber, and the doors were of silver and gold. And {{on each side of the}} doorway sat living dogs of gold, who never grew old or died, so well Hephaistos had made them in his forges in smoking Lemnos, and gave them to Alcinous to guard his gates by night. And within, against the walls, stood thrones on either side, down the whole length of the hall, strewn with rich glossy shawls; and on them the merchant kings of those crafty sea-roving Phæaces sat eating and drinking in pride, and feasting there all the year round. And boys of molten gold stood each on a polished altar, and held torches in their hands, to give light all night to the guests. And round the house sat fifty maid-servants, some grinding the meal in the mill, some turning the spindle, some weaving at the loom, while their hands twinkled as they passed the shuttle, like quivering aspen leaves.|$|E

50|$|A draftsman's {{beam compass}} {{consists}} {{of a set of}} points and holders, mounted on a <b>plated</b> <b>brass,</b> aluminum, or electrum rod. One end is generally locked {{down at the end of}} the rod, while the other has both rough and fine adjustments, though some are opposite in construction. The locked tip holder {{consists of a}} needle, for the center of the radius, and the other holds either a lead clutch, or an inking nib. There are older variants which use a wooden beam. Another similar type is a Machinist or Engineers beam compass, which uses scribing points only, similar to ones used by woodworkers, except that its fine adjustment is generally more refined. These beam compasses can be extended by adding press-in rods, or by using a lockable rod connector.|$|E

Several electronic makers such as [...] "Korg" [...] combine a metronome function with the pitchpipe function.|$|E
50|$|Early {{flashlights}} used vulcanized fiber or {{hard rubber}} tubes with metal end caps. Many other materials including drawn steel, <b>plated</b> <b>brass,</b> copper, silver, even wood and leather have been used. Modern flashlights are generally {{made of plastic}} or aluminum. Plastics range from low-cost polystyrene and polyethylene to more complex mixtures of ABS or glass-reinforced epoxies. Some manufacturers have proprietary plastic formulations for their products. A desirable plastic for manufacturing flashlights allows for ease of molding and adequate mechanical properties of the finished flashlight case. Aluminum, either plain, painted or anodized, is a popular choice. It is electrically conductive, can be easily machined, and dissipates heat well. Several standard alloys of aluminum are used. Other metals include copper, stainless steel, and titanium, which can be polished to provide a decorative finish. Zinc can be die-cast into intricate shapes. Magnesium and its alloys provide strength and heat dissipation similar to aluminum with less weight, but they corrode easily.|$|E

50|$|Kegerators are {{generally}} {{designed for use}} with beer kegs, but they are gaining popularity for dispensing other types of drinks, most notably wine, cold brewed coffee, kombucha, and soda. With home brew kegs, you can put whatever liquid you want inside the keg, pressurize it and dispense it with a kegerator. Different types of liquids require different alterations to the dispense system. Wine and cold brewed coffee use a CO2/Nitrogen blend to pressurize the kegs. These types of drinks also require all stainless steel contact with the dispense system fittings because the higher acid content can corrode the chrome <b>plated</b> <b>brass</b> normally found in dispense systems. You may also need to change out the beer line for silicone wine line, which {{is less likely to}} impart flavors. In many larger cities, coffee houses and wineries are offering their products in commercial kegs for use in a kegerator. If that is not available, you can always fill a home brew keg yourself.|$|E
5000|$|The Mace, {{a symbol}} of {{authority}} dating back to medieval times, {{when it was a}} studded, club-like weapon that was made of iron and could break armor. It later would be used in processions of city mayors and other dignitaries, and became an emblem of order and authority during academic ceremonies. The staff of IU's Mace is 30 inches long and made of polished ebony encircled with four brass, gold-plated collars and entwined by swirled gold bands. Atop the staff is a globe of <b>plated</b> <b>brass</b> with four flat sides. The sides of the globe are embossed with IU's seal, the seal of the state of Indiana, the emblematic initials [...] "IU," [...] and the donor inscription. The Mace was presented to the university by Indiana Alpha of Phi Delta Theta in 1949. Mounted on the globe of the Mace are 12 large synthetic jewels of blue sapphire, ruby, garnet and topaz. Atop this rests an eagle with outstretched wings.|$|E
5000|$|All Lange watches contain {{mechanical}} {{rather than}} quartz movements and, {{with the exception}} of a very few special edition watches, Lange watch cases are made of yellow gold, rose gold, white gold, or platinum. Lange movements are developed, produced, and assembled by Lange itself. Lange's movement design and decoration is distinctively Glashütte in appearance, eschewing typically Swiss features, such as multiple bridges and cocks, or pearlage, in favor of three-quarter plates, [...] "Glashütte stripes", hand-engraved balance cocks and screwed gold chatons. Lange movements are made from a metal known as German silver, as opposed to the <b>plated</b> <b>brass</b> typically used for Swiss movements. Lange watches tend to have a distinctive appearance. For example, the [...] "Lange 1" [...] model features an asymmetric layout with no overlap among its key indicators: a dial displaying the hours and minutes, a smaller subsidiary dial displaying seconds, an oversized double window date display, and a power reserve indicator. Lange's watches are often described as more [...] "austere" [...] or [...] "Teutonic" [...] in appearance than watches produced by comparable Swiss firms.|$|E
