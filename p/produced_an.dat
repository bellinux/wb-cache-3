5|$|Some {{essential}} {{features of}} Modernisme were: an anticlassical language inherited from Romanticism with {{a tendency to}} lyricism and subjectivity; the determined connection of architecture with the applied arts and artistic work that <b>produced</b> <b>an</b> overtly ornamental style; the use of new materials from which emerged a mixed constructional language, rich in contrasts, that sought a plastic effect for the whole; {{a strong sense of}} optimism and faith in progress that <b>produced</b> <b>an</b> emphatic art that reflected the atmosphere of prosperity of the time, above all of the esthetic of the bourgeoisie.|$|E

5|$|An {{isolated}} severe thunderstorm in {{the outer}} bands of Allison <b>produced</b> <b>an</b> F1 tornado in Worcester and Middlesex Counties in Massachusetts, impacting over 100trees and damaging one house and one small camper. A microburst in Leominster and another in Shirley damaged several trees. Lightning from the storm hit two houses, causing significant damage there but little elsewhere.

5|$|Apart {{from some}} western troupes' 19th-century visits, the first {{professional}} performance of Hamlet in Japan was Otojirō Kawakami's 1903 Shimpa ("new school theatre") adaptation.

At the Philips Stadion, Arsenal <b>produced</b> <b>an</b> impressive display against PSV, winning 4–0. It was their first win in European football away from home in 19 months and the match set a new club record, as Gilberto scored the fastest goal in the competition at 20.07 seconds.|$|E

50|$|Several gas or metal-vapor lamps {{can also}} be used. When {{operated}} at low pressure and current, these lamps generally produce light in various spectral lines, {{with one or two}} lines being most predominant. Because these lines are very narrow, the lamps can be combined with narrow-bandwidth filters to isolate the strongest line. A helium-discharge lamp will <b>produce</b> <b>a</b> line at 587.6 nm (yellow) while <b>a</b> mercury-vapor lamp <b>produces</b> <b>a</b> line at 546.1 (yellowish green). Cadmium vapor <b>produces</b> <b>a</b> line at 643.8 (red), but low pressure sodium <b>produces</b> <b>a</b> line at 589.3 (yellow). Of all the lights, low pressure sodium {{is the only one that}} <b>produces</b> <b>a</b> single line, requiring no filter.|$|R
5|$|As {{a patron}} James V {{supported}} poets William Stewart and John Bellenden. Stewart produced a verse {{version of the}} Latin History of Scotland compiled in 1527 by Boece and Bellenden produced a prose translation of Livy's History of Rome in 1533. Sir David Lindsay of the Mount the Lord Lyon, {{the head of the}} Lyon Court and diplomat, was a prolific poet. He <b>produced</b> <b>an</b> interlude at Linlithgow Palace thought to be a version of his play The Thrie Estaitis in 1540, the first surviving full Scottish play, which satirised the corruption of church and state, making use of elements such as medieval morality plays, with a humanist agenda.|$|E
5|$|Before Lauper {{covered the}} song, the band The Cars <b>produced</b> <b>an</b> {{early version of}} it that was not released. Shear's version was {{originally}} a folk rock song, but Lauper instead {{turned it into a}} pop ballad for her album, with a heavy emphasis on a synthesizer. According to Lauper, she wanted it to be just like Shear's version, with a bit more of an acoustic sound. However, she changed her mind, saying that she wanted to sing it like herself. Unlike her other singles from the album, this one did not have a music video released with it.|$|E

5|$|During the 1980s, glam metal {{became popular}} with {{groups such as}} Mötley Crüe and Poison. Underground scenes <b>produced</b> <b>an</b> array of more {{aggressive}} styles: thrash metal broke into the mainstream with bands such as Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer, and Anthrax, while other extreme subgenres of metal such as death metal and black metal remain subcultural phenomena. Since the mid-1990s popular styles have further expanded {{the definition of the}} genre. These include groove metal (with bands such as Pantera, Sepultura, and Lamb of God) and nu metal (with bands such as Korn, Slipknot, and Linkin Park), the latter of which often incorporates elements of grunge and hip hop.|$|E
