5|$|After {{planting}} the vineyards and vinting wines, Romito opened the Mount Hope Estate and Winery in 1980. To promote his new business the first year, Romito hosted several events including an art show, a bluegrass concert, a fifties revival, a country-western weekend, a classical orchestra concert, and a one-day modern jousting tournament. The jousting tournament was so <b>popular</b> <b>that</b> Romito held a two-day renaissance festival {{the following year}} in the winery's parking lot, and gradually expanded this into a permanent attraction, the Pennsylvania Renaissance Faire. The property was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1980, and in 1991 the boundaries were increased {{as part of the}} Iron and Steel Resources of Pennsylvania Multiple Property Submission (MPS).|$|E
5|$|Dungeon Keeper was {{referenced}} in Theme Hospitals introduction scene twice: {{a doctor}} is briefly seen playing a console version, and the Horned Reaper makes a cameo appearance as a patient. Early concept art for Black & White used Dungeon Keepers Horned Reaper to represent creatures.

5|$|Gruban {{successfully}} appealed {{against his}} internment, {{and as soon}} as he was freed brought Booth to court. The case was so <b>popular</b> <b>that</b> the involved barristers found it physically difficult to get into the court each day due to the size of the crowds gathered outside. Although the barristers on both sides were noted for their skill the case went almost entirely one way, with the jury taking only ten minutes to find Booth guilty. This was one of the first noted cases of Patrick Hastings, and his victory in it led to him applying to become a King's Counsel.|$|E

5|$|Johnson entered {{politics}} in 1804, {{when he was}} elected to represent Scott County in the Kentucky House of Representatives. He was twenty-three years old. Although the Kentucky Constitution imposed an age requirement of twenty-four for members of the House of Representatives, Johnson was so <b>popular</b> <b>that</b> no one raised questions about his age, and he was allowed to take his seat. He was placed on the Committee on Courts of Justice. During his tenure, he supported legislation to protect settlers from land speculators. On January 26, 1807, he delivered an address condemning the Burr conspiracy.|$|E
5|$|Some bootleggers noticed rock {{fans that}} {{had grown up with}} the music in the 1960s wanted rare or {{unreleased}} recordings of bands that had split up and looked unlikely to reform. For instance, the release of Golden Eggs, a bootleg of outtakes by The Yardbirds had proven to be so <b>popular</b> <b>that</b> the bootlegger had managed to interview the band's Keith Relf for the sequel, More Golden Eggs. Archive live performances became popular; a 1970 release of Dylan's set with the Hawks (later to become the Band) at the Manchester Free Trade Hall in 1966 (incorrectly assumed to be the Royal Albert Hall for years) was critically and commercially successful owing to the good sound quality and the concert's historical importance.|$|E
5|$|Sławomir Cenckiewicz {{also said}} that in 1983, when Wałęsa was {{nominated}} for the Nobel Peace Prize, the secret police tried to embarrass him and leaked information about Wałęsa's previous collaboration with the government. By this time though, Wałęsa was already so <b>popular</b> <b>that</b> most Poles {{did not believe the}} official media and dismissed the allegations as a manipulation by the Communist authorities. The book's first print run sold out in Poland within hours. The book received substantial coverage in the media, provoked nationwide debate, and was noted by the international press. Wałęsa vowed to sue the authors but never did.|$|E

5|$|The Keynesian Revolution was {{associated}} with the rise of modern liberalism in the West during the post-war period. Keynesian ideas became so <b>popular</b> <b>that</b> some scholars point to Keynes as representing the ideals of modern liberalism, as Adam Smith represented the ideals of classical liberalism. After the war, Winston Churchill attempted to check the rise of Keynesian policy-making in the United Kingdom and used rhetoric critical of the mixed economy in his 1945 election campaign. Despite his popularity as a war hero, Churchill suffered a landslide defeat to Clement Attlee whose government's economic policy continued to be influenced by Keynes's ideas.|$|E
5|$|The Samba was not {{the only}} Talbot model to see {{customer}} interest waning; as the 1980s progressed, all Talbots began to sell rather poorly and the range was gradually phased out. Peugeot had been working on developing a replacement for the Samba as late as 1984, which would have been based on the forthcoming Citroen AX, but this project was abandoned as Peugeot took the decision to phase out the Talbot brand, and the Peugeot 205 was proving so <b>popular</b> <b>that</b> Peugeot felt little need for a third car of this size within the group.|$|E
5|$|The {{pamphlet}} contained woodblock illustrations and {{was printed}} without attribution to Gray, at his request. Immediately after, Owen's magazine with Gray's poem was printed but contained multiple errors and other problems. In a 20 February letter to Walpole, Gray {{thanked him for}} intervening and helping to get a quality version of the poem published before Owen. It was so <b>popular</b> <b>that</b> it was reprinted twelve times and reproduced in many different periodicals until 1765, including in Gray's Six Poems (1753), in his Odes (1757), and in Volume IV of Dodsley's 1755 compilation of poetry. The revised version of 1768 was that later printed.|$|E

5|$|The {{unauthorised}} juvenile {{productions of}} Pinafore were so <b>popular</b> <b>that</b> Carte mounted his own children's version, played at matinees at the Opera Comique beginning on 16 December 1879. François Cellier, {{who had taken}} over from his brother as Carte's music director in London, adapted the score for children's voices. Between its two Christmas seasons in London, the children's production went on a provincial tour from 2 August 1880 to 11 December 1880.|$|E
5|$|Dunn {{trained and}} showed Tennessee Walking Horses for 50 years, and {{during his career}} won two World Grand Championships and 20 World Championships with various horses, {{competing}} in 125 to 150 horse shows a year. Dunn participated in the breed's major annual horse show, the Tennessee Walking Horse National Celebration, nearly every year from 1950. By 1993 he was so <b>popular</b> <b>that</b> he often signed autographs for several hours before a performance. In total, Dunn personally showed 108 horses at the Celebration, and several hundred others which he trained were shown by other riders. Among them was Sundust Royal Flush, a stallion who, at the 1970 Celebration, won both the Preliminary Stallion class and the Three-Year-Old World Championship. Among other winning horses were Stock Exchange, who won the Junior Stallion Championship at the Dixie Jubilee in Baton Rouge, Louisiana in 1984, and Yankee Delight, who won the Grand Championship at the same show. Dunn rode both horses to their wins. Among horses that were trained by Dunn but ridden by amateur riders, Delight Puff and Stuff was Amateur Champion, and Aces Executive was Ladies' Champion, also in 1984.|$|E
5|$|Etymologiae was {{the most}} used {{textbook}} throughout the Middle Ages. It was so <b>popular</b> <b>that</b> it was read in place {{of many of the}} original classical texts that it summarized, so these ceased to be copied and were lost. It was cited by Dante Alighieri, who placed Isidore in his Paradiso, quoted by Geoffrey Chaucer, and mentioned by the poets Bocaccio, Petrarch and John Gower. Among the thousand-odd surviving manuscript copies is the 13th-century Codex Gigas; the earliest surviving manuscript, the Codex Sangallensis, preserves books XI to XX from the 9th century. Etymologiae was printed in at least ten editions between 1472 and 1530, after which its importance faded in the Renaissance. The first scholarly edition was printed in Madrid in 1599; the first modern critical edition was edited by Wallace Lindsay in 1911.|$|E

5|$|Fantastic Adventures was {{initially}} published in bedsheet format, {{the same size}} as the early sf magazines such as Amazing, perhaps in order to attract fans who were nostalgic for the larger format. It started as a bimonthly, but in January 1940 began a monthly schedule. Sales were weaker than for Amazing, however, and with the June issue the schedule reverted to bimonthly. The size was also reduced to a standard pulp format, since that was cheaper to produce. Sales did not improve, and Ziff-Davis planned to make the October issue the last one. That issue carried Robert Moore Williams' Jongor of Lost Land, and had a cover by J. Allen St. John; the combination proved to be so <b>popular</b> <b>that</b> October sales were twice the August figures. This convinced Ziff-Davis that the magazine was viable, and it was restarted in January 1941as a bimonthly at first, but switching to monthly again in May of that year.|$|E
5|$|In 1771 his Synopsis of Quadrupeds was published; {{a second}} edition was {{expanded}} into a History of Quadrupeds. At {{the end of}} that same year, 1771, he published A Tour in Scotland in 1769. This proved so <b>popular</b> <b>that</b> he decided to undertake another journey and in the summer of 1772, set out from Chester with two companions, the Rev. John Lightfoot, a naturalist, and Rev. J. Stewart, a Scotsman knowledgeable in the customs of the country. They travelled through the Lake District, Carlisle, Eskdale, which Pennant much admired, Dumfries and Glasgow. In passing, he was fascinated by the account of the inundation of the surrounding farmland by a bursting out of the Solway Moss peatbog. The party set sail in a ninety-ton cutter from Greenock to explore the outer isles. They first visited Bute and Arran and then continued to Ailsa Craig. Pennant was interested in the birds, frogs and molluscs and considered their distribution. The boat then rounded the Mull of Kintyre and continued to Gigha. They would have continued to Islay but were becalmed. During this enforced idleness, the ever-industrious Pennant started on his ancient history of the Hebrides. When the wind picked up they continued to Jura.|$|E
5|$|In December 2013, Burger King {{returned}} to Finland after {{three decades of}} absence. The first restaurant, located on Mannerheimintie in central Helsinki, instantly proved so <b>popular</b> <b>that</b> for every day since its opening, people have had to queue {{in front of the}} restaurant to get in, sometimes for over half an hour. The only exception so far has been Christmas time, when the restaurant was closed. According to Mikko Molberg, the leader of the Finnish Burger King franchise, the restaurant has attracted over 2000 customers on every single day, which has surprised the restaurant employees and the franchise owners. The long queues have been extensively covered and ridiculed in social media, comparing them to people queuing in front of a McDonald's restaurant in Moscow, Russia in the early 1990s, and contrasting them with the nearly nonexistent queues to Burger King restaurants in Stockholm, Sweden.|$|E
