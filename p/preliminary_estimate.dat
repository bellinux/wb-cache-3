Winds blew at up to , catching many off-guard after a previous forecast that deemed the region was safe. Some sections of the city were left without power. The winds destroyed poorly built structures and damaged others, and some streets were flooded. An athletic stadium was demolished by the storm, and glass windows were shattered in downtown stores. A <b>preliminary</b> <b>estimate</b> placed the damage in Houston at $500,000. In the aftermath of the storm, fifteen truckloads of shattered glass were removed.|$|E

These estimates are produced using the Current Employment Statistics (CES) survey which is an on-going national probability sample survey of all non-farm establishments in the United States. The <b>preliminary</b> <b>estimates</b> are revised {{a number of times}} to incorporate late reporting in the CES sample and the most recent benchmark population information. In this paper, we develop a statistical method which has the potential to minimize the amount of revision between the <b>preliminary</b> <b>estimates</b> and the second revision of the estimates. Based on the historical data, we first build an appropriate model which links these two estimates and then use this relationship to predict the second revision from the knowledge of the <b>preliminary</b> <b>estimates</b> for the current month.

One <b>preliminary</b> <b>estimate</b> placed the number of dead in the Jérémie area alone at 1,500, suggesting {{the worst of the}} tragedy occurred there. Indeed, some modern sources have unofficially referred to the storm as Hurricane Jérémie. The Haitian government worked to bring emergency supplies and relief workers, at least partially by way of ship, to the flood-stricken region. As little was known about the extent of losses, officials rushed to restore communications with the disaster area.|$|E
5|$|The outer rainbands of Erika {{passed over}} Puerto Rico, {{producing}} maximum sustained winds of 23mph (37km/h) and a peak wind gust of 42mph (68km/h) at the Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport. The wind gusts snapped tree branches into power lines, leaving up to 12,000people without power in San Juan, Guaynabo and Bayamón. Rainfall was {{light on the}} island, with Caguas reporting a peak total of 0.77inches (20mm). The hurricane produced swells of 10 to 12ft (3 to 3.7m) on the northern coast of Puerto Rico, causing beach erosion or coastal flooding. One road was closed when sections of it were flooded or washed out. The strong waves forced the evacuation of eight families in the northern portion of the island. The strong waves killed two surfers in the northeastern waters of the island.
