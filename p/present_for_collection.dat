After storage at 5 =deg for 24 hr in the collection medium, and after their subsequent removal from the inhibitory medium, the endogenous respiration rate of such spermatozoa and their respiration in the presence of fructose is greater than the initial respiration level.

40|$|Access to {{specific}} information items often {{needs to be}} restricted due to privacy, competitive, legal, or national security issues. However, the growth of problems such as international terrorism creates requirements for increased sharing of information. In general, there is a tradeoff that must be made between protecting information and carrying out needed activities. Numerous information sharing efforts have {{addressed the issue of}} multi-level security. Resulting systems limit access {{to specific}} information items based on a hierarchy of user access privileges. Although such systems can facilitate the use of already-approved information by specific users, they do not fundamentally change the overall extent of exploitation of sensitive information by users. This paper presents a different approach to information sharing for sensitive data. The technique of latent semantic indexing is used to extract high-level relationship information from both non-sensitive and sensitive text. This relationship information is then used in an integrated fashion to improve the ability of users to carry out analysis on the non-sensitive data. The sensitive data is used in a background mode in which it is completely protected from exposure. The efficacy of the technique is demonstrated in this paper using a representative counterterrorism analysis task. Test results are <b>presented</b> <b>for</b> <b>collections</b> of from one to six million news articles. In the testing, the set of notional sensitive documents used as background was four to five orders of magnitude smaller than the test <b>collections.</b> Precision improvements <b>for</b> the chosen information discovery task varied from 39 to 167 %. The experiment demonstrates that sensitive textual information may be used in a fashion that greatly improves the exploitation of other text information, {{while at the same time}} completely protecting the sensitive information.

40|$|Funding a {{response}} to climate change after Kyoto will require another look at both burden sharing and funding mechanisms. After reviewing the risks of cap-and-trade with carbon offsets and the advantages of a harmonized carbon tax, a method is proposed to utilize a harmonized carbon price to finance the Green Climate Fund. A common carbon price is set across all nations with either a carbon tax or an emissions trading floor price with carbon offsets excluded. The harmonized carbon price is incrementally increased until 2050 to reach the cost of atmospheric removal and achieve equilibrium. Carbon revenues collected internally within nations are used for internal investments in climate change. Financing for the Green Climate Fund is generated from transferring {{a percentage of the}} collected revenues, based on a sliding window of historical responsibility for fossil fuel emissions and national wealth. Collected revenue is disbursed for climate aid based on a set of national climate need factors for adaptation and mitigation, including preserving strategic carbon absorbers, low-carbon infrastructures, technology transfer and population management. In the interest of distributive justice, nations themselves determine the need factors of each other. Unlike cap-and-trade, this method does not explicitly set emissions caps, but total global emissions can be regulated nevertheless. Formulas are <b>presented</b> <b>for</b> <b>collection</b> and disbursement, which require parameters for a globally harmonized carbon price, a climate fund contribution rate, historical responsibility from fossil fuel emissions, a national wealth threshold for fund contributions and need factors for each nation. Published economic and emissions data are used with the formulas to demonstrate an example of how the financing can work. This presents an equitable way to address climate needs across all nations on both a global and regional level. ...|$|R

40|$|Direct {{methods for}} solving large sparse linear systems of {{equations}} are popular {{because of their}} generality and robustness. Their main weakness is that the memory they require usually increases rapidly with problem size. We discuss the design {{and development of the}} first release of a new symmetric direct solver that aims to circumvent this limitation by allowing the system matrix, intermediate data, and the matrix factors to be stored externally. The code, which is written in Fortran and called HSL MA 77, implements a multifrontal algorithm. The first release is for positive-definite systems and performs a Cholesky factorization. Special attention is paid to the use of efficient dense linear algebra kernel codes that handle the full-matrix operations on the frontal matrix and to the input/output operations. The input/output operations are performed using a separate package that provides a virtual-memory system and allows the data to be spread over many files; for very large problems these may be held on more than one device.
