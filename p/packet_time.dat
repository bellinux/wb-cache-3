However, {{it is hard to}} accurately measure <b>packet</b> <b>time</b> information in an increasing number of network environments, such as widely deployed highspeed networks, and emerging cloud computing networks. Motivated by the observation that many applications only need the relative bandwidth information of different paths instead of the actual bandwidth information of a single path, we propose sequence-based bandwidth comparison. Specifically, this paper proposes a capacity comparison method, called PathComp, which can relatively compare the capacities of the paths from two senders to the same receiver. PathComp mainly uses the arrival sequence information of packets, and does not require any accurate <b>packet</b> <b>time</b> information. Our testbed, campus network, and EC 2 experiments show that PathComp can not only determine which path is faster but also accurately determine how much faster in a variety of network environments...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel algorithm {{for determining the}} 3 D location of a Mobile Tag (MT) using wireless Base Stations (BSs) and Ultra Wide Band (UWB) one-way signaling. The algorithm is designed for low power, rapid deployment applications in which the BSs are independent, wireless UWB transceivers located at known positions and the tags are receiveonly or transmit-only UWB mobile units. The algorithm utilizes multi-BS time synchronization and hybrid Time Difference of Arrival-Time of Flight (TDoA-ToF) localization to achieve high accuracy tag localization. The algorithm consists of two concurrent tasks. In task I, the BSs exploit periodic inter-BS transmissions to obtain high accuracy multi-BS time synchronization.

The algorithm is based on timestamping, or control, of <b>packet</b> <b>Time</b> of Emission (ToE) and estimation of the <b>packet</b> <b>Time</b> of Arrival (ToA).

40|$|Cloud {{computing}} is transforming a {{large part}} of IT industry, as evidenced by the increasing popularity of public cloud computing services, such as Amazon Web Service, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Windows Azure, and Rackspace Public Cloud. Many cloud computing applications are bandwidth-intensive, and thus the network bandwidth information of clouds is important for their users to manage and troubleshoot the application performance. ^ The current bandwidth estimation methods originally developed for the traditional Internet, however, face great challenges in clouds due to virtualization that is the main enabling technique of cloud computing. First, virtual machine scheduling, which is an important component of computer virtualization for processor sharing, interferes with packet time-stamping and thus corrupts the network bandwidth information carried by the packet timestamps. Second, rate limiting, which is a basic building block of network virtualization for bandwidth sharing, shapes the network packets and thus complicates the bandwidth analysis of the packets. ^ In this dissertation, we tackle the two virtualization challenges to design new bandwidth estimation methodologies for clouds. First, we design bandwidth estimation methods for networks with rate limiting, which is widely used in cloud networks. Bandwidth estimation for networks with token bucket shapers (i. e., a basic type of rate limiters) has been studied before, and the conclusion is that “both capacity and available bandwidth measurement are challenging because of the dichotomy between the raw link bandwidth and the token bucket rate”. Our methods are based on in-depth analysis of the multi-modal distributions of measured bandwidths. ^ Second, we expand the design space of bandwidth estimation methods to challenging but not rare networks where accurate and correct <b>packet</b> <b>time</b> information are hard to obtain, such as in cloud networks with heavy virtual machine scheduling. Specifically, we design and develop a fundamentally new class of sequence-based bandwidth comparison methods that relatively compare the bandwidth information of multiple paths instead of accurately estimating the bandwidth information of a single path. By doing so, our methods use only packet sequence information but not <b>packet</b> <b>time</b> information, and are fundamentally different from the current bandwidth estimation methods that all use <b>packet</b> <b>time</b> information. Furthermore, we design and develop a new class of sequence-based bandwidth estimation methods by conveying the time information in the packet sequence. Sequence-based bandwidth estimation methods estimate the bandwidth information of a path using the time information conveyed in the packet sequence from another path. ...|$|E
