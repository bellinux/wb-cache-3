25|$|Their second child, a son named William ("Billy") John, {{was born}} on April 21, 2017. The infant {{was born with a}} rare {{congenital}} heart defect, tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) with <b>pulmonary</b> <b>atresia,</b> which was first detected when he had a purplish appearance at three hours after birth. He underwent successful surgery at three days of age. The first guests Kimmel had when his show returned following his son's birth were cardiac surgeon Dr. Mehmet Oz, who explained the condition, and snowboarder Shaun White, who was born with TOF.|$|E

50|$|In {{regards to}} the {{diagnosis}} of <b>pulmonary</b> <b>atresia</b> the body requires oxygenated blood for survival. <b>pulmonary</b> <b>atresia</b> is not threatening to a developing fetus however, because the mother's placenta provides the needed oxygen since the baby's lungs are not yet functional. Once the baby is born its lungs must now provide the oxygen needed for survival, but with <b>pulmonary</b> <b>atresia</b> there is no opening on the pulmonary valve for blood {{to get to the}} lungs and become oxygenated. Due to this, the newborn baby is blue in color and <b>pulmonary</b> <b>atresia</b> can usually be diagnosed within hours or minutes after birth.|$|E

40|$|An eight-month-old {{boy with}} {{findings}} of persistent left pulmonary basal infiltrate {{was diagnosed with}} congenital unilateral <b>pulmonary</b> vein <b>atresia</b> by bronchoscopy. Cardiac catheterization documented slow left pulmonary venous return to atretic pulmonary veins. Conservative treatment was chosen because the child was asymptomatic and corrective surgery or percutaneous intervention was not technically possible. After a 3 -year follow-up, the child still has no documented pulmonary hypertension. Early diagnosis of unilateral <b>pulmonary</b> vein <b>atresia</b> is important to anticipate potential threatening complications like pulmonary hypertension and hemoptysis.

50|$|The {{prognosis}} for <b>pulmonary</b> <b>atresia</b> varies for every child, if {{the condition is}} left uncorrected it may be fatal, but the prognosis has greatly improved over the years for those with <b>pulmonary</b> <b>atresia.</b> Some factors that affect how well the child does include how well the heart is beating, and {{the condition of the}} blood vessels that supply the heart. Most cases of <b>pulmonary</b> <b>atresia</b> can be helped with surgery, if the patient's right ventricle is exceptionally small, many surgeries will be needed in order to help stimulate normal circulation of blood to the heart.If uncorrected, babies with this type of congenital heart disease may only survive for {{the first few days of}} life. Many children with <b>pulmonary</b> <b>atresia</b> will go on to lead normal lives, though complications such as endocarditis, stroke and seizures are possible.|$|E

The initial diagnosis was suspected in our patient from chest computerized tomography (CT), and confirmed with cardiac catheterization and pulmonary angiography. Treatment aim is to preserve lung function and minimize irreversible pulmonary remodeling [Pourmoghadam et al.; Harrison et al. ].

50|$|Less common CHD's are tricuspid and <b>pulmonary</b> <b>atresia,</b> and Ebstein's anomaly. Tricuspid atresia is the {{complete}} absence of the tricuspid valve {{which can lead to}} an underdeveloped or absent right ventricle. <b>Pulmonary</b> <b>atresia</b> is {{the complete}} closure of the pulmonary valve. Ebstein's anomaly is the displacement of the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve causing a larger atrium and a smaller ventricle than normal.|$|E

40|$|The {{spectrum}} of {{congenital heart disease}} ranges from simple lesions like a persistent arterial duct to lethal conditions like the hypoplastic left heart syndrome.

Complex cardiac surgery, like the arterial switch operation in the neonate, Fontan operations and repair of complex <b>pulmonary</b> <b>atresias,</b> when performed in well-equipped and experienced centres, can also achieve excellent short- and long-term outcomes. The surgical success are attributed to improvement in surgical techniques and cardiopulmonary bypass, better myocardial protection and advances in post-operative intensive care, {{such as the use of}} inhaled nitric oxide in post-operative pulmonary hypertensive crisis and mechanical circulatory support like extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and ventricular assist device to treat post-operative low cardiac output syndrome...|$|R

50|$|The Blalock-Thomas-Taussig shunt (commonly {{called the}} Blalock-Taussig shunt) is a {{surgical}} procedure used to increase pulmonary blood flow for palliation in duct dependent cyanotic heart defects like <b>pulmonary</b> <b>atresia,</b> which are common causes of blue baby syndrome.

50|$|<b>Pulmonary</b> <b>Atresia</b> with Intact Ventricular Septum (PA-IVS) {{is a rare}} {{congenital}} malformation. PA-IVS involves complete blockage of the pulmonary valve {{located on}} the right side of the heart. This blockage prevents the flow of blood to the lungs. Because of this lack of blood flowing through the right side of the heart, the structures on that side, such as the pulmonary valve and the tricuspid valve, are abnormally small.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{investigate}} the efficacy {{and safety of}} transcatheter radiofrequency-assisted valve dilatation for infants with <b>pulmonary</b> valve <b>atresia</b> and intact ventricular septum {{as an alternative to}} the use of laser heated wires. DESIGN [...] Prospective clinical study. SETTING [...] Three paediatric cardiology centres. PATIENTS [...] Four children (aged 5 - 101 days, weight 2. 8 kg) with <b>pulmonary</b> valve <b>atresia</b> and intact ventricular septum underwent percutaneous radiofrequency-assisted valve dilatation. METHODS [...] After delineating the atretic valve by angiography, 0. 020 inch or 0. 018 inch radiofrequency wires were used to perforate the atretic valve. The valve was then dilated with conventional balloon dilatation catheters up to the valve annulus diameter. RESULTS [...] In all four cases the radiofrequency wire perforated the atretic pulmonary valve and balloon dilatation was successful. In one patient the radiofrequency wire also passed through the anterior wall of the pulmonary artery causing tamponade which required surgical repair shortly afterwards. This patient died from sepsis six days later. One patient died three weeks after the procedure from septicaemia and a paradoxical coronary embolus. Two patients were discharged after 4 and 14 days respectively. CONCLUSIONS [...] Radiofrequency-assisted valve dilatation is a promising alternative to the recently developed laser wire technique. The major advantages are a reduction in cost and improved safety for the staff performing the procedure...|$|R
