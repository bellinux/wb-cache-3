All eukaryote cells contain mitochondria, and animal mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has a relatively fast mutation rate, resulting in the generation of diversity within and between populations over relatively short evolutionary timescales (thousands of generations).

This contrasts with the nuclear genome, which is around 100 000 times larger, where males and females each contribute two full genomes to the gene pool and effective size is therefore proportional to twice the total population size.

40|$|The {{relative}} {{timing and}} size of regional human population growth following our expansion from Africa remains unknown. Human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) diversity carries a legacy of our population history. Given a set of sequences, we can use coalescent theory to estimate past <b>population</b> size <b>through</b> <b>time</b> and draw inferences about human population history. However, recent work has challenged the validity of using mtDNA diversity to infer species population sizes. Here we use Bayesian coalescent inference methods, together with a global dataset of 357 human mtDNA coding region sequences, to infer human <b>population</b> sizes <b>through</b> <b>time</b> across eight major geographic regions. Our estimates of relative population sizes show remarkable cocordance with the contemporary regional distribution of humans across Africa, Eurasia and the Americas, indicating that mtDNA diversity is a good predictor of population size in humans. Plots of <b>population</b> size <b>through</b> <b>time</b> show slow growth in sub-Saharan Africa beginning 143 - 193 kya, followed by a rapid expansion into Eurasia after {{the emergence of the}} first non-African mtDNA lineages 50 - 70 kya.

Investigation of multiple stressors is paramount to accurately represent the mosaic of stressors found in natural environments. The synergism between different stressors {{is not always}} predictable and further work is needed in this field. Resurrection ecology, the hatching of dormant life-stages of some species, pro- vides a powerful method to study species adaptive mechanisms through time to environmental stressors. In this thesis I examine a combination of stressors on Daphnia magna resurrected from the Lake Ring system and assess neutral genetic diversity through time in the same sediment core. Preliminary analysis suggests there are no differences in fitness responses between the sub-populations to combinations of stressors. As neutral genetic variation was also stable over time it is possible standing genetic variation, and possibly the buffering effect of resting egg banks, allow this species to adapt and evolve to strong environmental selection pressures. Further work investigating the mechanisms underpinning this adaptive ability will be done using whole genome and transcriptome sequencing. Finally it was also found hatched and unhatched sub-populations of Daphnia magna, from the same sediment core, show the same neutral genetic diversity and structure suggesting resting stages can be confidently used to represent dormant <b>populations</b> <b>through</b> <b>time...</b>|$|E

When the ancient DNA and the phylogenetic rates are used to estimate the time of origin of the lineages, two very different estimates resulted. In addition, these same rates provide very different estimates of the time of expansion of these lineages. We suggest that the rate calculated from ancient DNA is more consistent with the glacial history of Antarctica and requires fewer assumptions than does a narrative based on the phylogenetic rate. Finally, we suggest that our study indicates an important new role for ancient DNA studies in the timing of divergent events in history...|$|E

A particularly important goal is to understand how urban density affects the persistence of animal <b>populations</b> <b>through</b> <b>time,</b> and how these impacts can be mediated by habitat provision; but data on this question are limited for some taxa. Here, we use data from a citizen science monitoring program to investigate the effect of urbanization on patterns of frog species richness and occurrence over 13 years. Sites surrounded by {{a high proportion of}} bare ground (a proxy for urbanization) had consistently lower frog occurrence, but we found no evidence that declines were restricted to urban areas. Instead, several frog species showed declines in rural wetlands with low-quality habitat. Our analysis shows that urban wetlands had low but stable species richness; but also that population trajectories are strongly influenced by vegetation provision in both the riparian zone and the wider landscape. Future increases in the extent of urban environments in our study area are likely to negatively impact populations of several frog species. However, existing urban areas are unlikely to lose further frog species in the medium term. We recommend that landscape planning and management focus on the conservation and restoration of rural wetlands to arrest current declines, and the revegetation of urban wetlands to facilitate the re-expansion of urban-sensitive species...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Habitat selection, and its {{associated}} density and frequency-dependent evolution, has a profound influence on such vital phenomena as population regulation, species interactions, the assembly of ecological communities, and the origin and maintenance of biodiversity. Different strategies of habitat selection, and their importance in ecology and evolution, can often be revealed simply by plots of density in adjacent habitats. For individual species, the strategies are closely intertwined with mechanisms of population regulation, and with the persistence of <b>populations</b> <b>through</b> <b>time.</b> For interacting species, strategies of habitat selection are not only responsible for species coexistence, but provide {{one of the most}} convenient mechanisms for measuring compe-tition, and the various community structures caused by competitive interactions. Other kinds of interactions, such as those between predators and prey, demonstrate that an understanding of the coevolution of habitat-selection strategies among strongly interacting species is essential to properly interpret their spatial and temporal dynamics. At the evolutionary scale, the frequency dependence associated with habitat selection may often allow popu-lations to diverge and diversify into separate species. Habitat selection thereby demonstrates how we can map microevolutionary strategies in behavior onto their pop-ulation and community consequences, and from there, onto macroevolutionary patterns of speciation and adap-tive radiation. We can anticipate that future studies of habitat selection will not only help us complete those maps, but that they will also continue to enrich the panoply of ideas that shape evolutionary ecology...|$|E

Classical structure functions for quantifying spatial patterns have limitations, for example, although Ripley’s K function is useful for identifying differences in spatial patterns through space, this makes it difficult to identify differences in spatial patterns through time. To complement Ripley’s K function, we use the Thomas process, a point pattern model, to quantify temporal changes in spatial patterns for five tropical tree species known to have density-dependent mortality from species-specific pests and/or pathogens on Barro Colorado Island, Panama. We fit the data of each species to the model to estimate the cluster size (σ) and density of cluster centres (ρ). We compared spatial patterns based on the pair correlation function of the Thomas process determined from σ and ρ. We found reduced clustering over the past 20 years for Ocotea whitei (Lauraceae) and Quararibea asterolepis (Bombacaceae), the two species with the best-documented cases of pathogen and pest outbreaks on BCI, suggesting support for the Janzen-Connell Hypothesis; however, we reject the hypothesis because neither species showed spatial regularity throughout the census period.

Dietary niche characterizes the functional role of organisms in a food web, as it reflects both resources' diversity used by a consumer and trophic interactions in the system. Dietary niches are controlled both by biotic and abiotic factors, but their interactions in natural systems remain poorly studied. Here, we investigated the variability of dietary niche in salmonid wild populations focusing both on inter-population and intra-population (through time) trophic changes, using marble trout (Salmo marmoratus) living in Slovenian headwater streams as a model system. Stable isotope analysis showed high variability of dietary niche and trophic diversity among six of the seven remnant marble trout populations. We observed substantial differences in dietary niche width among populations and within <b>populations</b> <b>through</b> <b>time.</b> Results of partial least square path modelling highlighted opposite effects of immature and mature trout on trophic niche structure. Direct effects of temperature and slope (stream and watershed) were opposite; temperature narrowed dietary niches while slope increased them. Environmental factors (e. g., temperature, stream and watershed slope) had indirect effects on trophic niches after accounting for fish density. Our results showed that size-distribution and sexual maturity are key determinants of the dietary niche width in a population. Increasing density of immature trout tended to widen the dietary niche while increasing density of mature trout tended to narrow it. Environmental factors had direct effects both on resources and consumers densities and indirect effects. Direct and indirect effects were often antagonistic...|$|E

We investigate cases in which the population varies in size and evolves according to a class of models that includes suitably conditioned (1 + β) -stable continuous state branching processes (in particular, it includes the conditioned Feller continuous state branching process). We also consider the discrete time Markov chain that tracks the MRCA age just before and after its successive jumps. We find transition probabilities for both the continuous and discrete time processes, determine when these processes are transient and recurrent, and compute stationary distributions when they exist. We also introduce a new family of Markov processes that stand in a relation with respect to the (1 + β) -stable continuous state branching process that is similar to the one between the Bessel-squared diffusions and the Feller continuous state branching process. 1...|$|R

However, individual lakes may harbor different species of haptophyte algae with different sensitivities to temperature variations, thus presenting a significant challenge to the use of lacustrine alkenones for paleotemperature reconstructions. To explore the extent of lacustrine haptophyte diversity, we conducted the first comprehensive phylogenetic and geochemical survey of lacustrine alkenone producers. We sampled 15 alkenone-containing lake surface sediments from a variety of geographic locales and inferred identities of environmental sequences using 18 S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene-based phylogenies. For two lakes, BrayaSø in southwest Greenland and Tso Ur on the Tibetan Plateau, we also analyzed both surface and downcore sediments to characterize haptophyte <b>populations</b> <b>through</b> <b>time.</b> In parallel with phylogenetic analyses, we determined the alkenone distributions (including C 37 /C 38 ratios, and the presence/absence of C 38 methyl ketones and C 40 compounds) in all the samples. The resulting alkenone profiles from this study do not all align with traditional “marine” versus “coastal/lacustrine” alkenone profiles. Additionally, our genetic data indicate the presence of multiple haptophyte species from a single lake sediment sample; these distinct haptophyte populations could not be discerned from the alkenone profiles alone. These results show that alkenone profiles are not a reliable way to assess the haptophyte algae in lakes and that DNA fingerprinting is a preferred approach for species identification. Although closely related haptophyte species or subspecies may not warrant different temperature calibrations, our results emphasize the importance of genetic data for inferring haptophyte identities and eventually selecting alkenone–temperature calibrations for paleoclimate reconstructions...|$|E

The second experiment used a split-plot design in which rye or lupine was planted into field plots with histories of five tropical cover crops: soybean (Glycine max), cowpea (Vigna unguiculata), sorghum-sudangrass (Sorghum bicolor × S. sudanense), sunn hemp (Crotalaria juncea), and corn. Population densities of M. incognita and Helicotylenchus dihystera were affected by previous tropical cover crops (P ≤ 0. 05) but not by the winter cover crops present at the time of sampling. Plots planted to sunn hemp in the fall maintained the lowest M. incognita and H. dihystera numbers. Results suggest that winter cover crops tested did not suppress plant-parasitic nematodes effectively. Planting tropical cover crops such as sunn hemp after corn in a triple-cropping system with winter cover crops may provide more versatile nematode management strategies in northern Florida...|$|E

Janeiro {{is supported}} by a PhD scholarship (SFRH/BD/ 96078 / 2013) funded by the Fundação para a Ciência e Tecnologia (FCT). Integral projection models (IPMs) are extremely flexible tools for ecological and evolutionary inference. IPMs track the distribution of phenotype in <b>populations</b> <b>through</b> <b>time,</b> using functions describing phenotype-dependent development, inheritance, survival and fecundity. For evolutionary inference, two important features of any model are the ability to (i) characterize relationships among traits (including values of the same traits across ages) within individuals, and (ii) characterize similarity between individuals and their descendants. In IPM analyses, the former depends on regressions of observed trait values at each age on values at the previous age (development functions), and the latter on regressions of offspring values at birth on parent values as adults (inheritance functions). We show analytically that development functions, characterized this way, will typically underestimate covariances of trait values across ages, due to compounding of regression to the mean across projection steps. Similarly, we show that inheritance, characterized this way, is inconsistent with a modern understanding of inheritance, and underestimates the degree to which relatives are phenotypically similar. Additionally, we show that the use of a constant biometric inheritance function, particularly with a constant intercept, is incompatible with evolution. Consequently, current implementations of IPMs will predict little or no phenotypic evolution, purely as artifacts of their construction. We present alternative approaches to constructing development and inheritance functions, based on a quantitative genetic approach, and show analytically and through an empirical example on a population of bighorn sheep how they can potentially recover patterns that are critical to evolutionary inference.

40|$|A {{stochastic}} model of purchase behavior is developed to aid marketing managers analyze and predict consumer purchase behavior. The model {{is based upon}} a composite structure, that is, it integrates several submodel components (e. g., brand choice and purchase incidence behavior) within its structure. Although the overall model is founded upon individual consumer behavior assumptions, it provides measures of market behavior by aggregating individual behavior parameters over a heterogeneous population of consumers. Thus, the model is developed from assumptions of relevant probability laws that relate to individual consumer's probability of brand choice and the time between product class purchases; {{as well as the}} distributions of brand choice probability and the average product class purchase rate of individuals over the population of consumers. The model provides aggregate market behavior measures including brand market share, expected brand sales and the distribution of brand purchase probability over the consumer <b>population</b> <b>through</b> <b>time.</b> Other measures of market behavior of potential use to marketing managers, such as the cumulative penetration, trial and repeat purchase ratio for a given brand, are also derived from the brand's aggregate theoretical purchase distribution. ...|$|R

Al-though many individuals flew considerable distances along transects, most recaptures were in traps near the point of release.
