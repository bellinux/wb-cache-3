40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the effect of}} <b>non-woven</b> <b>polypropylene</b> covers on plant growth and development, frost protection, tuber yield and quality and the economic effectiveness in early potato production. A high income from early potato production is possible under conditions assuring early setting and rapid gain of tuber yield and its marketing when the price is highest. The application of <b>non-woven</b> <b>polypropylene</b> covers accelerates plant emergence by 28 days and the growth and development of plants in the later period, and results in an earlier new potato harvest by up to 2 - 3 weeks. It also increases the tuber yield and reduces the yield variability in all years. Accelerating plant growth using <b>non-woven</b> <b>polypropylene</b> covers affects not only tuber yield quantity, but also contributes to improvement of the tuber quality, especially {{by an increase in}} dry matter, potassium and phosphorus content of tubers and decrease nitrate concentration. Such a method of potato production requires higher incurred input. Increasing the production inputs is effective when the value of the tuber yield increase obtained as a result of plant covering is higher than the costs incurred. A higher productive effect of covering is usually obtained in years with a cold spring and a very early potato harvest date. A considerable tuber yield increase in cultivation under <b>non-woven</b> <b>polypropylene</b> cover results in decreased unit costs and, consequently, the cost-effectiveness of production is higher than without covering. In conditions favouring rapid potato growth, the production costs of 1 kg tuber under cover are higher, which makes production less profitable than cultivation without plant covering...|$|R

Some preliminary heavy metals adsorption tests gave interesting results: at 20 °C for 24 h and in a 1000 mg/L heavy metals solution, PP-g-AA-cysteine adsorbs 95 mg Cu/g PP (CuSO 4 solution), 104 mg Cu/g PP (Cu(NO 3) 2 solution), 135 mgPb/g PP (Pb(NO 3) 2 solution) and 21 mg Cr/g PP (Cr(NO 3) 3 solution).

30|$|Fibrous {{materials}} are well-known for large specific surface area, fast absorption rate, and excellent actual operability. Some researchers have reported {{a lot of}} fibrous materials {{which can be used}} as oil absorbents, for example, the fibers prepared via dry-wet spinning (Feng and Xiao 2006), gelation spinning (Xu and Xiao 2010), wet spinning (Zhao et al. 2011), melt spinning (Zhao et al. 2012), reactive extrusion-melt spinning (Ma et al. 2013), and graft modification (Li and Wei 2012). Due to good practicability and wide applicability, non-woven fabrics, such as melt blown <b>polypropylene</b> <b>non-woven</b> fabric (Zhao et al. 2013 a, b), are another important fibrous material which can be used as oil absorbent (Radetic et al. 2008). The above-mentioned fibrous materials involving the fibers and non-woven fabrics can absorb a large amount of oily organic liquids; however, since the fibrous {{materials are}} composed of thick fibers, they absorb organic liquids at a relatively slow rate, which has an adverse effect on their application. Electrospun fibrous materials are of great advantage to oil absorption rate for the reason that the diameter of electrospun fibers can reach nanometer level (Zhu et al. 2011). In recent years, some polymers, such as polyacrylonitrile (Su et al. 2012; Liu et al. 2014), poly(m-phenylene isophthalamide) (Tang et al. 2013), and cellulose acetate (Shang et al. 2012), have been electrospun into fibrous materials and used as oil absorbents to separate oil from water. Polystyrene, as a commonly solvent-soluble and thermoplastic polymer, has more excellent electrospinnability in comparison with other polymers, thus electrospun polystyrene fibrous material has been used widely as oil absorbent (Lin et al. 2012, 2013; Lee et al. 2013; Wu et al. 2012). However, polystyrene is a kind of rigid polymer, thus its electrospun fibrous material exhibits some disadvantages. First, some fibers can fall off the fibrous material due to weak cohesive force among fibers. Second, owning to low temperature brittleness, some fibers break at low temperature, and the fibrous material shows poor strength. Therefore, it is very necessary to improve the performance of electrospun polystyrene fibrous material. The previous work showed that electrospun poly (meth)acrylate fibers could adhere to each other to provide a strong cohesive force for fibrous material (Mo et al. 2014); additionally, poly (butyl acrylate) has good low temperature resistance because it has the properties similar to those of natural rubber. Thereby it was proposed that to copolymerize with butyl acrylate was an effective approach to supply electrospun polystyrene material with good cohesive force and flexibility. As a consequence, the shortages of electrospun polystyrene material could be remedied easily.|$|E

The non-wovens, modified in air, helium and argon, showed {{a significant increase in}} liq. absorptive capacity due to the incorporation of oxygen-contg. groups, such as C-O, O-C=O and C=O.

40|$|Bacterial {{infections are}} {{a serious problem}} for {{patients}} with burns and other wounds. Such burn wound infection accounts for the pathogenic bacteria by colonising onto burned areas. Therefore, the need for detection and inhibition of such bacterial colonisation requires a methodology for sensing/killing pathogenic bacteria. This research project aims to design a ‗smart‘ wound dressing system which can respond to the microbiological environment of the wound via a simple colour change and will release antimicrobials only when required. Two strains of pathogenic bacteria Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA 476) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PAO 1) {{were used in the}} study. The non-pathogenic bacterium E. coli (DH 5 α) was used as a control organism as it does not secrete virulence factors and therefore does not lyse membranes of vesicles. The key contributions of this thesis are outlined below. Firstly, an initial responsive nanocapsule system was studied. The fundamental work with giant unilamellar vesicles proved such a responsive system can provide antimicrobial properties when antimicrobial agents were encapsulated within the vesicles. Secondly, partially polymerised vesicles—polydiacetylene/phospholipid vesicles were then developed to improve vesicle stability. The vesicle system was optimised by varying molar concentration of diacetylene monomers (TCDA) in order to obtain relatively stable vesicles as well as sensitivity to the toxins secreted by the pathogenic strains. Measurements proved that the polydiacetylene/phospholipid vesicles can respond to pathogenic bacteria when fluorescent dye/antimcirobials were encapsulated in the vesicles. Finally, a simple prototype dressing was constructed. Plasma polymerised maleic anhydride (pp-MA) deposited onto <b>non-woven</b> <b>polypropylene</b> was shown to be a good method to stabilise vesicles via covalent bonding.

Several novel antimicrobial monomer systems were synthesised and characterised based on silver, copper and zinc as the active constituent with phosphines, phosphites, maleimide and a novel Schiff base among the ligand systems. All monomers were found to greatly inhibit the growth of P. aeruginosa and S. aureus in solution and on solid media. Successful monomers were deposited onto suitable substrates (glass, gold, plastics, <b>non-woven</b> <b>polypropylene)</b> using continuous wave and pulse plasma, with the films characterised and low levels of active metal found in analysis using XPS and SIMS. Films were tested against solutions of pathogenic bacteria using a number of traditional and modern microbiological techniques and found to inhibit growth under a range of conditions, potentially due to the synergistic action of metal and ligand on bacterial cells. Effective control of bacteria was exhibited at times varying from 1 h to 24 h+.

This, in combination to the overuse of antibiotics and evolution of resistant bacterial stains, means {{there is a need for}} a more intelligent approach in the prevention of biofilm formation and bacterial infection. In this work, the antimicrobial properties of metals (in particular silver and zinc) was utilized and incorporated into polymeric biomaterial to render them antimicrobial. Several methods of functionalising polymers with antimicrobial metals were assessed. The materials developed throughout this work were designed to respond to changes in environmental as a result of infection. These changes include differences in pH and temperature all of which are altered in response to infection. This smart design allows for the reduction of unnecessary release of antimicrobial, and will reduce the likelihood of toxicity and resistance. Polymer modifications in this research include modifications made during polymer synthesis, i. e. reaction with additional antimicrobial monomer. In this case, pH responsive zinc containing crosslinker molecule was designed to crosslink into any polymeric material. Post synthesis modifications were also investigated, and include the ‘grafting to’ and ‘grafting from’ of polymers which could then be functionalised with antimicrobial metals. This work demonstrated methods to modify <b>non-woven</b> <b>polypropylene.</b> A system, for the ‘grafting from’ approach to give a pH responsive release of antimicrobial metals from a polymer brush was investigated. Secondly a ‘grafting to’ approach to give a temperature responsive release of metals was investigated. Finally, several zinc compounds were synthesised and assessed for there ability to graft via plasma assisted grafting. The results presented in this work demonstrate novel ways of incorporating antimicrobial metal functionality into polymeric biomaterials and their antimicrobial efficacy.

40|$|Railways {{form one}} of the major {{worldwide}} transportation networks and they continue to provide quick and safe public and freight transportation. In order to compete with other modes of transportation and to meet the ever growing demand of public and freight transport, railway industries face challenges to improve their efficiency and decrease the costs of maintenance and infrastructure. Large cyclic loading from heavy haul and passenger trains often leads to progressive deterioration of the track. The excessive deformations and degradations of the ballast layer and unacceptable differential settlement or pumping of underlying soft and compressible subgrade soils necessitate frequent costly track maintenance works. Hundreds of millions of dollars are spent each year for the construction and maintenance of rail tracks in large countries like the USA, Canada and Australia. A proper understanding of load transfer mechanisms and their effects on track deformations are essential prerequisites for designing the new track and rehabilitating the existing one. The reinforcement of the track by means of geosynthetics leads to significant reduction in the downward propagation of stresses and assures more resilient long-term performance. The geocomposite (combination of biaxial geogrid and <b>non-woven</b> <b>polypropylene</b> geotextile) serves the functions of reinforcement, filtration and separation, thereby reducing the vertical and lateral deformations. To stabilise subgrade soil under rail tacks and road embankments, two advanced ground improvement schemes have been introduced. Stabilization of soft subgrade soils using prefabricated vertical drains (PVDs) is essential for improving overall stability of track and reducing the differential settlement during the train operation. The effectiveness of using geocomposite geosynthetic and PVDs has been observed through field measurements and elasto-plastic finite element analyses. These have been the first fully instrumented, comprehensive field trials carried out in Australian Railways, and it was very encouraging to see the field observations matching the numerical predictions. Moreover, the improvement of an unstable formation soil with pH neutral chemical admixture and the sub-surface drainage is described. Internal erosional behaviour of lignosulfonate treated erodible soils has been studied using the Process Simulation Apparatus for Internal Crack Erosion (PSAICE) designed and built at the University of Wollongong (UOW). Effectiveness of lignosulfonate treated erodible soils on the erosion resistance has been investigated and its advantages over conventional methods are presented and discussed...|$|R
