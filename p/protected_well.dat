Therefore, implementation of water and sanitation projects {{in line with this}} target need to give due attention to measured water quality and assess if water is of acceptable standards. In this regard, an assessment of groundwater quality was carried out in three wards of Murehwa District in Zimbabwe in February and March 2011. Samples from 60 randomly selected ground water sources; 30 <b>protected</b> <b>wells</b> and 30 from unprotected wells were analysed for thermotolerant coliform, pH and turbidity parameters using a portable Delagua water testing kit.
