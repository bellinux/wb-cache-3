In this paper, we construct such candidates {{in the case of}} acyclic cluster algebras with 'polarised' <b>principal</b> <b>coefficients,</b> and study the resulting Frobenius categorifications. Since cluster algebras with <b>principal</b> <b>coefficients</b> are obtained from those with polarised <b>principal</b> <b>coefficients</b> by setting half of the frozen variables to 1, our categories also indirectly model cluster algebras with <b>principal</b> <b>coefficients,</b> for which no Frobenius categorification can exist.
