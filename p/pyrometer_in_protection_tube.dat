50|$|To {{get around}} these difficulties, the ratio or two-color {{pyrometer}} was developed. They {{rely on the}} fact that Planck's law, which relates temperature to the intensity of radiation emitted at individual wavelengths, can be solved for temperature if Planck's statement of the intensities at two different wavelengths is divided. This solution assumes that the emissivity is the same at both wavelengths and cancels out in the division. This is known as the gray body assumption. Ratio pyrometers are essentially two brightness <b>pyrometers</b> <b>in</b> a single instrument.

40|$|Abstract. Silicon {{nitrides}} {{are often}} used as ladles, stalks, heater element <b>protection</b> <b>tubes,</b> etc., <b>in</b> the metal casting industry. A low wettability for molten metals is required for these purposes since wetting by molten metals leads to adhesion of solidified metals, which causes several problems. Surface structure is known to affect wettability. Thus, the present study attempts to fabricate silicon nitrides with controlled surface structures. Silicon nitrides, whose surfaces were covered with ordered hemispherical protrusions, were fabricated by the slip-casting technique. The cast bodies were sintered, and subjected to wettability tests using molten metals. For comparison, silicon nitrides with as-sintered and polished surfaces were also prepared. The surface with protrusions exhibited a lower contact angle compared to the as-sintered and polished surfaces.

40|$|Summary: This paper {{describes}} the design, modeling and optimization of a miniaturized self-calibrated pyrometer to detect infrared radiation (in 5 - 20 µm range of wavelengths) {{in order to}} measure the real temperature of objects without contact. The microsystem consists of a thermally insulated absorbing area and two thermopiles with the hot junctions in the absorbing area and the cold junctions on a heat sink (i. e. the silicon bulk). The complete microsystem is in silicon planar technology and each thermopile has a different reference temperature, biased by a Peltier microstructure near to the cold junction of the thermopile. A silicon die passivated with a silicon nitride membrane is the ground floor of all microsystem.

Uncertainty estimates for automatic two-color <b>pyrometers</b> certified <b>in</b> Production are {+-} 16. 7 C. Additional uncertainty and bias are introduced when measuring production melt temperatures. A - 19. 4 C bias was measured in a large 1987 data set which {{is believed to be}} caused primarily by use of Pyrex{trademark} windows (not present in current configuration) and window fogging. Large variability (2 {sigma} = 28. 6 C) exists in the first 10 m of the hold period. This variability is attributed to emissivity variation across the melt and reflection from hot surfaces. For runs with hold periods extending to 20 m, the uncertainty approaches the calibration uncertainty of the pyrometers. When certifying pyrometers on a strip lamp at the Y- 12 Standards Laboratory, it is important to limit ambient temperature variation (23 {+-} 4 C), to order calibration points from high to low temperatures, to allow 6 m for the lamp to reach thermal equilibrium (12 m for certifications below 1200 C) to minimize pyrometer bias, and to calibrate the pyrometer if error exceeds vendor specifications.
