50|$|The pied plover (Vanellus cayanus), {{also known}} as the <b>pied</b> <b>lapwing,</b> is a species of bird in the family Charadriidae. It is a {{strongly}} marked bird with a prominent black V on its mantle.|$|E
50|$|The {{last three}} of these {{seem to be very}} closely related to the {{southern}} lapwing and all were placed in Belonopterus by the describing authors. If Viator picis, also from the Late Pleistocene of Talara, does not belong to an entirely extinct lineage, it might belong to that group too; it seems too large to be closely related to the smallish <b>pied</b> <b>lapwing.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Mosquito Inlet is an estuary {{northwest}} of the island, having an area of 674 ha, where four bird species, the eastern curlew, masked <b>lapwing,</b> <b>pied</b> oystercatcher and sooty oystercatcher roost.|$|R
50|$|India's Thar Desert {{spans the}} western states of Rajasthan and Gujarat. More people live here {{than in any other}} desert, with a {{population}} density 100 times that of the Sahara, and growing all the time. Fortunately the people of the desert look favourably on their wild neighbours, as demonstrated by the villagers of Khichan, who feed large flocks of demoiselle cranes over the winter. The birds are revered as symbols of fortune. Thapar visits a desert dwelling of the Bishnoi people, strict vegetarians and guardians of the animal population. Despite this, poaching is rife and the blackbucks, filmed in the breeding season, are being increasingly marginalised. The chinkara or Indian gazelle is an even hardier animal, getting all the moisture it needs from plants and the morning dew. Wolves and jackals are also shown. Around a camp fire, the nocturnal inhabitants of the desert are filmed as they emerge from the sand: dung beetles, gerbils and predatory saw scaled vipers and scorpions. The people of Jodhpur are vegetarians but use domesticated oxen, camels and buffalo as working animals. When they die, the carcasses are taken {{to the edge of the}} city and left as food for scavengers, among them Asian king vultures, Indian white-rumped vultures and griffon vultures. Waterholes attract many animals before they dry up during the heat of summer. It is also used by people and their livestock for washing and drinking. Birds shown include <b>pied</b> kingfisher, red-wattled <b>lapwing</b> and black-winged stilt. To escape egrets, frogs hop across the surface of the water. At night, climbing perch leave the water and travel across land to find other pools, and an ingenious ratel uses logs to reach a stricken kingfisher chick. The most extreme environment is the Rann of Kutch salt flats where only the monsoon brings relief to the last population of Indian wild asses. In the closing scenes, Thapar observes flocks of flamingos which come to the salt flats in times of flood.|$|R
