50|$|<b>Permanent</b> <b>magnet</b> <b>generators</b> (PMGs) or alternators (PMAs) do {{not require}} a DC supply for the {{excitation}} circuit, nor do they have slip rings and contact brushes. A key disadvantage in PMAs or PMGs is that the air gap flux is not controllable, so the voltage of the machine cannot be easily regulated. A persistent magnetic field imposes safety issues during assembly, field service or repair. High performance permanent magnets, themselves, have structural and thermal issues. Torque current MMF vectorially combines with the persistent flux of permanent magnets, which leads to higher air-gap flux density and eventually, core saturation. In this permanent magnet alternators the speed is directly proportional to the output voltage of the alternator.|$|E

Subsequently, by means of the finite element analysis software-ANSYS Maxwell, the corresponding electromagnetic characteristics are analyzed to verify the correctness of the mentioned models. In addition, a compensation control strategy based on flux-linkage observation is proposed to solve the problems of unstable suspension force and generating voltage under variable load condition in this paper. Meanwhile, the corresponding control system is constructed and its feasibility is validated by simulation results. Finally, an experimental prototype of a 2. 2 kW HEBPMG is tested.
