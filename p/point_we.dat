This has happened because of the advent of television. Burrakatha is a long-format art form.

25|$|We have {{supposed}} that the rigid body rotates around an arbitrary <b>point.</b> <b>We</b> should {{prove that the}} angular velocity previously defined is independent from the choice of origin, {{which means that the}} angular velocity is an intrinsic property of the spinning rigid body.|$|E
30|$|However, {{this does}} not work for {{boundary}} <b>points.</b> <b>We</b> observe that if the patch is mirrored along its boundary, then the boundary points become inner <b>points.</b> <b>We</b> {{do not need to}} really mirror the patch, such as creating new <b>points.</b> Instead, <b>we</b> use {{a modified version of the}} Laplacian contraction, and these boundary points contract normally along the inward curvature flow in normal directions as inner points.|$|R

25|$|Multiplying this {{infinite}} sum by 3 in base 5 gives …0000001. As {{there are}} no negative powers of 5 in this expansion of 1/3 (i.e. no numbers {{to the right of}} the decimal <b>point),</b> <b>we</b> see that 1/3 satisfies the definition of being a -adic integer in base 5.|$|E
25|$|Then {{there is}} a variety Av and a family of degree 0 line bundles P, the Poincaré bundle, parametrised by Av such that a family L on T is {{associated}} a unique morphism f: T → Av so that L is isomorphic to the pullback of P along the morphism 1A×f: A×T → A×Av. Applying this to the case when T is a <b>point,</b> <b>we</b> see that the points of Av correspond to line bundles of degree 0 on A, so {{there is a}} natural group operation on Av given by tensor product of line bundles, which makes it into an abelian variety.|$|E

25|$|The last {{period was}} really victorious for NAER MATARON. We {{composed}} the harshest and most extreme music {{we ever had}} for our new album.

We are more strong and enthusiastic than ever before and feel that we are also supported henceforth in the same spirit. To this <b>point,</b> <b>we</b> wish to extend our salute to the hordes that supported our black metal war machine throughout the last 13 years and especially thank Michael and Season of Mist for giving us the chance to deliver {{what will be the}} most extreme and uncompromising work of NAER MATARON to date.|$|E
25|$|In {{differential}} geometry, the {{two principal}} curvatures {{at a given}} point of a surface are the eigenvalues of the shape operator at the point. They measure how the surface bends by different amounts in different directions at that <b>point.</b> <b>We</b> represent the surface by the implicit function theorem as the graph of a function, f, of two variables, {{in such a way}} that the point p is a critical point, i.e., the gradient of f vanishes (this can always be attained by a suitable rigid motion). Then the Gaussian curvature of the surface at p is the determinant of the Hessian matrix of f (being the product of the eigenvalues of the Hessian). (Recall that the Hessian is the 2-by-2 matrix of second derivatives.) This definition allows one immediately to grasp the distinction between cup/cap versus saddle point.|$|E
25|$|Often we {{encompass}} {{the record of}} an entire matter by one notation, a single image. For example, the prosecutor {{has said that the}} defendant killed a man by poison, has charged that the motive for the crime was an inheritance, and declared that there are many witnesses and accessories to this act. If in order to facilitate our defense we wish to remember this first <b>point,</b> <b>we</b> shall in our first background form an image of the whole matter. We shall picture the man in question as lying ill in bed, if we know his person. If we do not know him, we shall yet take some one to be our invalid, but not a man of the lowest class, so that he may come to mind at once. And we shall place the defendant at the bedside, holding in his right hand a cup, and in his left hand tablets, and on the fourth finger a ram's testicles (Latin testiculi suggests testes or witnesses). In this way we can record the man who was poisoned, the inheritance, and the witnesses.|$|E
