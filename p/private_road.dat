5|$|Lower North East Road {{runs around}} Anstey Hill {{and up the}} {{escarpment}} of the Burnside-Eden Fault Zone. It connects the suburbsformerly villagesof Hope Valley and Houghton. Three roads were surveyed and built to connect the same locations. The first was a <b>private</b> <b>road</b> constructed by George Anstey in 1841although officially surveyed in 1844to reach his estate, as a mostly straight-line extension of Grand Junction Road. It followed {{the base of a}} gully, before rising steeply up Anstey Hill. From 1842 to 1846, Anstey constructed a replacement <b>private</b> <b>road</b> with a devil's elbow (double hairpin bend) that followed the land's contours more closely. As Chairman of Roads for the District of Yatala, Anstey allocated most of the district's funding to his road, leading to a public outcry that forced him from office in 1851. This ungravelled road became known as Anstey Hill Road and remained in use for 20 years. New Road, later renamed Houghton Road and subsequently Lower North East Road, was constructed in 1873 as a replacement. It was longer than the preceding roads but lacked a devil's elbow, was more evenly sloped, and was paved in 1930. It now separates {{a small part of the}} parkthat contains Klopper's quarries and the Gun Emplacementfrom the rest. Remains of the two previous roads can be seen near Klopper's quarries.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} days of the agency, the only means of {{transportation}} were bullock-carts known as jhatkas along with palanquins. The roads connecting Madras to Calcutta in the north and the kingdom of Travancore in the south served as lines of communication during wars. From the early 20th century onwards, bullock-carts and horses were gradually replaced by bicycles and motor vehicles, while motor buses were the main means of <b>private</b> <b>road</b> transportation. Presidency Transport and the City Motor Service were pioneers, operating buses manufactured by Simpson and Co. as early as 1910. The first organised bus system in Madras city was operated by Madras Tramways Corporation between 1925 and 1928. The 1939 Motor Vehicles Act imposed restrictions on public-owned bus and motor services. Most of the early bus services were operated by private agencies.|$|E
5|$|The {{right-of-way}} {{on which}} the parkway was built had originally {{been part of a}} <b>private</b> <b>road</b> leading to Sagtikos Manor. The parkway was designed to have connections with the Sunken Meadow Spur (the future Sunken Meadow State Parkway) and the Captree State Parkway (now known as the Robert Moses Causeway) proposed by New York City highway engineer Robert Moses. On November13, 1949, a new interchange between the Southern State Parkway and Bay Shore Road was opened to traffic. This interchange would eventually serve as the Southern State Parkway's junction with the Sagtikos, Heckscher and Captree state parkways. Proposals conceived at this time called for grading on the new Sagtikos State Parkway to begin in early 1950.|$|E

40|$|Over {{the last}} few decades new {{residential}} developments have increasingly featured <b>private</b> <b>roads.</b> Many planned unit developments and new-urbanism-style projects have turned to <b>private</b> <b>roads.</b> This paper considers some of the spatial, socioeconomic, and planning implications created by <b>private</b> <b>roads</b> in the Canadian context. While private streets provide a useful tool for achieving design and density objectives, and for transferring the burden of development costs to those who benefit from growth, they exacerbate social segregation and spatial fragmentation of the urban landscape. ...|$|R

5|$|There are two {{ornamental}} woods {{within the}} grounds, Summercombe Wood and Luscombe Wood. Luscombe Wood covers an area {{south of the}} house, through the centre of which runs a <b>private</b> <b>road</b> known as The Terrace. The wood is made up primarily of deciduous trees, interspaced with laurels. It also includes an 18th-century pine plantation {{to the east of}} the woods. The north-west boundary of the woods is Haldon Lane and {{the other side of the}} road is Summercombe Wood. Summercombe has largely been replanted in the latter half of the 20th century, but the original 19th century drive follows a stream through the valley past a pond to a stone bridge to two further areas of nearby woodland. At the west side of Summercombe Wood, there is a 19th-century lodge, Haldon Lodge.|$|E
5|$|In 1689, William III {{moved his}} {{residence}} to Kensington Palace {{on the far}} side of Hyde Park and had a drive laid out across its southern edge which was known as the King's <b>Private</b> <b>Road.</b> The drive is still in existence as a wide straight gravelled carriage track leading west from Hyde Park Corner across the southern boundary of Hyde Park towards Kensington Palace and now known as Rotten Row, possibly a corruption of rotteran (to muster), Ratten Row (roundabout way), Route du roi, or rotten (the soft material with which the road is covered). It is believed to be the first road in London to be lit at night, which was done to deter highwaymen. In 1749, Horace Walpole was robbed while travelling through the park from Holland House. The row was used by the wealthy for horseback rides in the early 19th century.|$|E

In Pennsylvania, {{township}} roads are numbered by county (i.e., a single number may {{be assigned to}} multiple roads as long as each road is in a different county), but are maintained by township (i.e., the township is entirely responsible for their upkeep). Like many township roads in the state, Blewett, Clark, Doyle, Hines, Mud Pond, and Paluch are all unpaved.

500|$|The name of {{the park}} derives from a road built by George Alexander Anstey, a South Australian {{pastoral}} and horticultural pioneer. Anstey established Highercombe Estate on two land sections east of the park that he purchased in 1840. [...] He built a <b>private</b> <b>road</b> to his estate, which ran along {{the base of a}} gully and up a steep hillside.

500|$|According to Mulligan, {{a problem}} during the {{production}} {{was that her}} role required her to drive: {{at the time she}} {{did not know how to}} drive or have a driver's licence. She did a two-week intensive course to learn how to work a manual gear change so she could eventually film the driving scenes, but failed the driving test. [...] "I’m really bad at it", she explained. [...] " [...] no hand and eye coordination." [...] The production team ultimately had to shoot the scene on a <b>private</b> <b>road,</b> where she was allowed to get behind the wheel. The director had a hard time making Knightley look plain in the film. He tells in an interview: [...] "It was difficult. She was eager and happy to do it because the role called for it.

50|$|Many <b>private</b> <b>roads</b> {{may be used}} by {{the general}} public, and may have {{different}} speed limits and different regulations from public roads. These are usually dead ends in the countryside. <b>Private</b> <b>roads</b> are maintained by the community using them. They may not be eligible for communal subsidies. There is about 100000 km of these servicing the inhabitants of rural areas. Cottage roads comprise about as much and forest roads about 120000 km. Some of these are not public rights of way, which is usually indicated by a sign. Forest roads are not regularly maintained, nor addressed for emergency services. Some ice roads, which form seasonally, depending on temperature, are maintained by the state, the longest one being the 7 km Koli Ice Road, which cuts 50 km off the distance between Lieksa and Koli. <b>Private</b> ice <b>roads</b> are also sometimes built by the inhabitants of lakeland and archipelago.|$|R
