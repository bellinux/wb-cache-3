50|$|Biotic ethics (also called life-centered ethics) is {{a branch}} of ethics that values not only species and biospheres, but life itself. On this basis, biotic ethics defines a human purpose to secure and <b>propagate</b> <b>life.</b> These {{principles}} are related to bioethics, and to environmental ethics that seek to conserve existing species. However, biotic ethics value more generally organic gene/protein life itself, the structures and processes shared by all the biota. These processes result in self-propagation, an effective purpose that humans share with all life. Belonging to life then implies a human purpose to safeguard and <b>propagate</b> <b>life.</b> This purpose defines basic moral values: Acts that sustain life are good, and acts that destroy life are evil. Panbiotic ethics extends these principles to space, seeking to secure and expand life in the galaxy.|$|E

In general, biotic ethics may approve these developments if they help to <b>propagate</b> <b>life.</b> This ethical guidance may be in fact vital when advancing technology makes human designs self-fulfilling.

50|$|This episode {{covers the}} nature of how life may have {{developed}} on Earth {{and the possibility of}} life on other planets. Tyson begins by explaining how the human development of writing systems enabled the transfer of information through generations, describing how Princess Enheduanna (Christiane Amanpour) ca. 2280 BCE {{would be one of the}} first to sign her name to her works, and how Gilgamesh collected stories, including that of Utnapishtim documenting a great flood comparable to the story of Noah's Ark. Tyson explains how DNA similarly records information to <b>propagate</b> <b>life,</b> and postulates theories of how DNA originated on Earth, including evolution from a shallow tide pool, or from the ejecta of meteor collisions from other planets. In the latter case, Tyson explains how comparing the composition of the Nakhla meteorite in 1911 to results collected by the Viking program demonstrated that material from Mars could transit to Earth, and the ability of some microbes to survive the harsh conditions of space. With the motions of solar systems through the galaxy over billions of years, life could conceivably propagate from planet to planet in the same manner.|$|E

40|$|Accurate {{chromosome}} segregation during cell division {{is crucial for}} <b>propagating</b> <b>life</b> and protects from cellular transformation. The SKAP: Astrin heterodimer localizes to spindle microtubules and to mature microtubule-kinetochore attachments during mitosis. Depletion of either subunit disrupts spindle structure and destabilizes kinetochore-microtubule attachments. Here, we identify molecular requirements for the inter-subunit interaction of SKAP and Astrin, and discuss requirements for their kinetochore recruitment. We also identify and characterize a microtubule-binding domain in SKAP, distinct from the SXIP motif that mediates end binding (EB) protein binding and plus end tracking, and show that it stimulates the growth-rate of microtubules, possibly through a direct interaction with tubulin. Mutations targeting this microtubule-binding domain impair microtubule plus-end tracking but not kinetochore targeting, and recapitulate many effects observed during depletion of SKAP. Collectively, our studies represent the first thorough mechanistic analysis of SKAP and Astrin, and significantly advance our functional understanding of these important mitotic proteins...|$|R
40|$|To {{construct}} a synthetic cell {{we need to}} understand the rules that permit life. A central idea in modern biology is that in addition to the four entities making reality, matter, energy, space and time, a fifth one, information, plays a central role. As a consequence of this central importance of the management of information, the bacterial cell is organised as a Turing machine, where the machine, with its compartments defining an inside and an outside and its metabolism, reads and expresses the genetic program carried by the genome. This highly abstract organisation is implemented using concrete objects and dynamics, and this is at the cost of repeated incompatibilities (frustration), which need to be sorted out by appropriate «patches».

The sun and the moon are the two eternal death-results of the death of individuals. Matter, all matter, is the Life-born. And what we know as inert matter, this is only the result of death in individuals, it is the dead bodies of individuals decomposed and resmelted between the hammer and anvil, fire and sand of the sun and the moon. When time began, the first individual died, the poles of the sun and moon were flung into space, and between the two, in a strange chaos and battle, the dead body was torn and melted and smelted, and rolled beneath the feet of the living. So the world was formed, always under the feet of the living.|$|R

40|$|Astroecology {{concerns}} {{the relations between}} life and space resources, and cosmo-ecology extrapolates these relations to cosmological scales. Experimental astroecology can quantify the amounts of life that {{can be derived from}} space resources. For this purpose, soluble carbon and electrolyte nutrients were measured in asteroid/meteorite materials. Microorganisms and plant cultures were observed to grow on these materials, whose fertilities are similar to productive agricultural soils. Based on measured nutrient contents, the 1022 kg carbonaceous asteroids can yield 1018 kg biomass with N and P as limiting nutrients (compared with the estimated 1015 kg biomass on Earth). These data quantify the amounts of life that can be derived from asteroids in terms of time-integrated biomass [BIOTAint = biomass (kg) × lifetime (years) ], as 1027 kg-years during the next billion years of the Solar System (a thousand times the 1024 kg-years to date). The 1026 kg cometary materials can yield biota 10 000 times still larger. In the galaxy, potential future life can be estimated based on stellar luminosities. For example, the Sun will develop into a white dwarf star whose 1015 W luminosity can sustain a BIOTAint of 1034 kg-years over 1020 years. The 1012 main sequence and white and red dwarf stars can sustain 1046 kg-years of BIOTAint in the galaxy and 1057 kg-years in the universe. Life has great potentials in space, but the probability of present extraterrestrial life may be incomputable because of biological and ecological complexities. However, we can establish and expand life in space with present technology, by seeding new young solar systems. Microbial representatives of our life-form can be launched by solar sails to new planetary systems, including extremophiles suited to diverse new environments, autotrophs and heterotrophs to continually form and recycle biomolecules, and simple multicellulars to jump-start higher evolution. These programs can be motivated by life-centered biotic ethics that seek to secure and <b>propagate</b> <b>life.</b> In space, life can develop immense populations and diverse new branches. Some may develop into intelligent species that can expand life further in the galaxy, giving our human endeavors a cosmic purpose...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Female {{reproductive}} potential, or {{the ability}} to <b>propagate</b> <b>life,</b> is limited in mammals with the majority of oocytes lost before birth. In mice, surviving perinatal oocytes are enclosed in ovarian follicles for subsequent oocyte development and function in the adult. Before birth, fetal germ cells of both sexes develop in clusters, or germline cysts, in the undifferentiated gonad. Upon sex determination of the fetal gonad, germ cell cysts become organized into testicular or ovarian cord-like structures and begin to interact with gonadal somatic cells. Although germline cysts and testicular cords are required for spermatogenesis, the role of cyst and ovarian cord formation in mammalian oocyte development and female fertility has not been determined. Results Here, we examine whether intact fetal ovarian germ and somatic cell cord structures are required for oocyte development using mouse gonad re-aggregation and transplantation to disrupt gonadal organization. We observed that germ cells from disrupted female gonad prior to embryonic day e 13. 5 completed prophase I of meiosis but did not survive following transplantation. Furthermore, re-aggregated ovaries from e 13. 5 to e 15. 5 developed with a reduced number of oocytes. Oocyte loss occurred before follicle formation and was associated with an absence of ovarian cord structure and ovary disorganization. However, disrupted ovaries from e 16. 5 or later were resistant to the re-aggregation impairment and supported robust oocyte survival and development in follicles. Conclusions Thus, we demonstrate a critical window of oocyte development from e 13. 5 to e 16. 5 in the intact fetal mouse ovary, corresponding to the establishment of ovarian cord structure, which promotes oocyte interaction with neighboring ovarian somatic granulosa cells before birth and imparts oocytes with competence to survive and develop in follicles. Because germline cyst and ovarian cord structures are conserved in the human fetal ovary, the identification of genetic components and molecular mechanisms of pre-follicle stage germ and somatic cell structures may be important for understanding human female infertility. In addition, this work provides a foundation for development of a robust fetal ovarian niche and transplantation based system to direct stem cell-derived oocyte differentiation as a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of infertility. </p...|$|E

Earlier studies have identified Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO) {{as one of}} the most influencing factors of the intraseasonal variability of the monsoon rainfall.

Associated with this, negative convective anomalies over monsoon trough zone region extended eastwards to date line indicating weaker than normal northern hemisphere inter tropical convergence zone (ITCZ). The positive convective anomalies over OTCZ and negative convective anomalies over ITCZ formed a dipole like pattern.

40|$|Interactions {{within and}} between species complicate {{quantification}} of climate effects, by causing indirect, often delayed, effects of climate fluctuations and compensation of mortality. Here we identify direct and indirect climate effects by analysing unique Russian time-series data from the Norwegian Sea–Barents Sea ecosystem on the first life stages of cod, capelin, herring and haddock, their predators, competitors and zooplanktonic prey. By analysing growth and survival from one life stage to the next (eggs–larvae– juveniles–recruits), we find evidence for both bottom-up, direct and top-down effects of climate. Ambient zooplankton biomass predicts survival of all species, whereas ambient temperature mainly affects survival through effects on growth. In warm years, all species experienced improved growth and feeding conditions. Cohorts born following a warm year will, however, experience increased predation and competition because of increased densities of subadult cod and herring, leading to delayed climate effects. While climate thus affects early growth and survival through several mechanisms, {{only some of the}} identified mechanisms were found to be significant predictors of population growth. In particular, our findings exemplify that climate impacts are barely <b>propagated</b> to later <b>life</b> stages when density dependence is strong...|$|R
2500|$|He then tackles the {{question}} of why evolution has permitted organisms to senesce, even though (1) senescence lowers individual fitness, and (2) there is no obvious necessity for senescence. In answering this question, Medawar provides two fundamental and interrelated insights. First, there is an inexorable decline in probability of an organism's existence, and, therefore, in what he terms [...] "reproductive value." [...] He suggests that it therefore follows that the force of natural selection weakens progressively with age late in life (because the fecundity of younger age-groups is overwhelmingly more significant in producing the next generation). What happens to an organism after reproduction is only weakly reflected in natural selection by the effect on its younger relatives. He pointed out that likelihood of death at various times of life, as judged by life tables, was an indirect measure of fitness, that is, the capacity of an organism to <b>propagate</b> its genes. <b>Life</b> tables for humans show, for example that the lowest likelihood of death in human females comes at about age 14, which in primitive societies would likely be an age of peak reproduction. This has served as the basis for all three modern theories for the evolution of senescence.|$|R
40|$|Present {{theory of}} marine {{community}} structure includes {{the effect of}} environmental factors that act upon larval survival on distribution and abundance of benthic adults. The theory assumes that pre-settlement environmental factors produce a direct effect at the population level, determining the abundance of individuals that enter the benthic habitat. These are density effects that propagate from the larval to the benthic phase (abbreviated here as DEMPHs). However, recent information suggests that pre-settlement factors may also produce an effect on population abundance, mediated by changes in traits of settlers. For instance, larvae experiencing food stress may give rise to juveniles with reduced energy reserves, growth rate, and in consequence with a low life expectancy. Thus, such trait-mediated (e. g. life historical, physiological) effects <b>propagate</b> through different <b>life</b> phases of the complex life cycles of benthic invertebrates, ultimately affecting juvenile survival. In this paper, I discuss the potential role of this special kind of trait-mediated effect (abbreviated here as DELPHIs) on benthic communities. I show that DELPHIs may affect {{the shape of the}} stock-settlement function leading to an erroneous interpretation of the role of post-settlement factors on benthic communities. Mortality due to DELPHIs is the consequence of pre-settlement factors but may be confounded with mortality due to post-settlement factors. In this regard, I conclude that the only solution to avoid this error is to incorporate measurements of traits of individuals in settlement and recruitment studies. Besides, DELPHIs may allow for complex interactions between pre- and post-settlement processes, suggesting that dichotomous views about the role of pre- and post-settlement processes are not appropriate. Finally, I suggest that future field research in benthic communities should incorporate an estimation of DELPHIs as a tool to expand, and thus improve, marine community theory...|$|R

40|$|The ever {{increasing}} need for lower density and higher temperature-capable materials {{for aircraft engines}} {{has led to the}} development of Ceramic Matrix Composites (CMCs). Today's aircraft engines operate with > 3000 "F gas temperatures at the entrance to the turbine section, but unless heavily cooled, metallic components cannot operate above approx. 2000 F. CMCs attempt to push component capability to nearly 2700 F with much less cooling, which can help improve engine efficiency and performance in terms of better fuel efficiency, higher thrust, and reduced emissions. The NASA Glenn Research Center has been researching the benefits of the SiC/SiC CMC for engine applications. A CMC is made up of a matrix material, fibers, and an interphase, which is a protective coating over the fibers. There are several methods or architectures in which the orientation of the fibers can be manipulated to achieve a particular material property objective as well as a particular component geometric shape and size. The required shape manipulation can be a limiting factor in the design and performance of the component if there is a lack of bending capability of the fiber as making the fiber more flexible typically sacrifices strength and other fiber properties. Various analysis codes are available (pcGINA, CEMCAN) that can predict the effective Young's Moduli, thermal conductivities, coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE), and various other properties of a CMC. There are also various analysis codes (NASAlife) that can be used to predict the life of CMCs under expected engine service conditions. The objective of this summer study is to utilize and optimize these codes for examining the tradeoffs between CMC properties and the complex fiber architectures that will be needed for several different component designs. For example, for the pcGINA code, there are six variations of architecture available. Depending on which architecture is analyzed, the user is able to specify the fiber tow size, tow spacing, weave parameter, and angle of orientation of fibers. By holding the volume fraction of the fibers constant, variations in tow spacing can be explored for different architectures. The CMC material properties are usually calculated assuming the component is manufactured perfectly. However, this is typically not the case so that a quantification of the material property variability is needed to account for processing and/or manufacturing imperfections. The overall inputs and outputs are presented using a regression software to rapidly investigate the tradeoffs associated with fiber architecture, material properties, and ultimately cost. This information is then <b>propagated</b> through <b>lifing</b> models and Larson-Miller data to assess timehemperature-dependent CMC strength. In addition, a first order cost estimation will be quantified from a current qualitative perspective. This cost estimation includes the manufacturing challenges, such as tooling, as well as the component cost for a particular application. Ultimately, a cost to performance ratio should be established that compares the effectiveness of CMCs to their current rival, nickel superalloys...|$|R
