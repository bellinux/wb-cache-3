40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is {{to look into the}} {{applicability}} of Discrete Element Modelling (DEM) coupled to Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) to simulate micro-scale colloidal particles immersed in fluid. Numerical methods were implemented through the commercial framework of EDEM 2. 3. As opposed to dissolved matter, which behaves as a continuum within the fluid <b>medium,</b> <b>particulate</b> matter is made of discrete entities that interact amongst themselves, and with the fluid and any physical boundaries. Particulate matter is ubiquitous in many purification processes that would beneficiate from having an easy way to model particle dynamics immersed in water. In an effort to understand better the dynamics of particle deposition under surface forces and hydraulic forces, a micro-scale numerical model was built adopting both a mechanistic and a statistical approach to represent the forces involved in colloidal suspension. The primary aim of the model was to simulate particle aggregation, deposition and cluster re-suspension in real world micro-systems. Case studies include colloidal flocculation in a constricted tube, and colloidal fouling around membrane filtration feed spacers. This work used a DEM-CFD coupling method that combined the DEM particle flow simulation with hydrodynamics forces from a velocity field computed through CFD. It also implemented boundary-particle and particle-particle interactions by enabling the modelling of surface and interfacial forces. Two kinds of coupling method were considered: two-way and one-way coupling. Two-way coupling is suitable for high particle concentration flow where particle loading affects the hydrodynamics. One-way coupling is suitable for dispersed particle configuration where the flow field is assumed to be undisturbed by the particles. The advantages and drawbacks of both techniques for micron-size particles were investigated. EDEM 2. 3 was customised with plug-ins to implement Van der Waals forces and Brownian forces and its post-processing features offered the ability to investigate easily the microparticles behaviour under the influence of fluid forces. In this context, DEM-CFD modelling using EDEM 2. 3 represents an improvement on previously published works as it enables higher visibility and reproducibility along with increasing the number of potential users of such modelling.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{discusses the}} design and scaling characteristics of Tesla – or so-called “friction” – turbines, and offers design solutions for achieving optimum performance given the input specifications. The research covers turbines ranging from sub-watt power scavenging designs to watt-range mobile applications to kilowatt-range renewable energy applications. The characteristics of the turbine are demonstrated using micro fabrication, theoretical analysis, and ANSYS, COMSOL, and MATLAB simulations. A MATLAB GUI is provided for generating design specifications and turbine performance sensitivity. In Tesla turbines, the fluid profile {{and the length of}} the fluid path inside the rotor control the pressure drop and momentum transfer. In this research, analyses of rotor performance for incompressible flow are developed for different fluid profiles and fluid-path lengths. First, frictional losses in the nozzle and at the rotor-turbine interface are investigated, along with other turbine losses. These losses are then classified and modeled in terms of their relationship to head loss and shaft power loss, and investigated using MATLAB and COMSOL. As the turbine scales down, this scaled performance is evaluated and a constraint list for turbine hardware and operating parameters is derived. These results are used to optimize performance for the full range of millimeter to meter sized turbines. Tesla turbines at the scales covered in this dissertation (mm – m) are relatively easy to manufacture. The experimental mini-turbines presented in this research have two primary components, fabricated using commercially available technologies: 1) four 1 cm-diameter rotors with variation in number of disks, interdisk spacing, and effective area, and 2) a turbine enclosure with eight nozzles of varying area, angle, and shape. Test results from different configurations of nozzles and rotors are presented, and observations made on the performance trends of the turbine. Flow through the 1 cm rotors is also simulated in ANSYS to verify the momentum equations. The performance difference between analytical solutions, simulation, and experimental results is then studied, and a mapping of experimental results onto analytical results is proposed. In addition, various scaling-down methodologies are investigated. Disk spacing is varied as a power function of radius, and turbine performance is analyzed across the turbine range of 1 mm to 400 mm diameter. Using this approach, constant power density designs are specified that perform at better than 35 % mechanical efficiency for the entire range. As the turbine is scaled down, the roughening of the disks must be increased to control the fluid profile. Power density is very sensitive to the rotor spacing and the input head, and efficiency is very sensitive to the operating parameters and turbine design. This dissertation argues that these sensitivities explain the wide discrepancies in published turbine performances. A practical design tool is also offered, which inputs user specifications on head, flow, <b>particulate</b> size, and <b>medium</b> to generate a list of possible turbine designs along with a recommendation for four candidate designs. The sensitivities of turbine performance to the input head and input flow variations are also reported. The tool is designed to cover 20 mW to 20 kW power range and 2 mm to 500 mm rotor radius range.

To get further insight into the possible physical causes of the absence of speckles, we use the numerically exact superposition T-matrix solver of the Maxwell equations and analyze the scattering of plane-wave and Gaussian beams by representative multi-sphere groups. We show that phase and amplitude variations across an incident Gaussian beam do not serve to extinguish the pronounced speckle pattern typical of plane-wave illumination of a fixed multi-particle group.

The part is immersed within a bed of the <b>particulate</b> <b>medium</b> contained in a die chamber. Heating to sintering temperature is achieved by resistive heating of the medium while applying compaction pressure. The process is capable of ultra-high temperatures and short cycle times, and it offers the potential for low processing costs. Control of the process as well as selection of process conditions require knowledge of the temperatures within the die. Temperature gradients will exist {{because of the high}} heating rate and because of variations of density and electrical resistivity of the medium due to the presence of the part. Direct measurement of temperature with thermocouples or other conventional means is impractical because of the high temperatures, high currents, and high pressures. Therefore, a computer model was developed to predict the temperature as a function of time and applied voltage for any location in the die. The computer model contains three parts: a geometrical model to approximate the density and resistivity variations in the medium, a finite-element model to calculate the rate of resistive heating within each element, and a finite-difference model to calculate the temperature distribution based upon solution of the heat-transfer equations.

In a number of papers Lumme and Bowell (1, 2), Lumme and Irvine (3), and Hapke (4) have considered models to interpret both the disk-integrated and disk-resolved data of atmosphereless bodies. Although these models differ considerably in details and produce different values of the individual parameters, they can fit the data very well. This seems to indicate that the solution is not unique. However, the major difficulties in these models are {{in the manner in which}} they treat both the surface roughness and the single particle phase function. Neither in the models can the surface roughness be qualitatively related to real laboratory samples and the single particle phase functions have been parametrized on a mathematical rather than on a physical basis. Also a verification of both models with strignent laboratory tests has been in its infancy. Voyager spacecraft have in recent years greately increased the disk-resolved data base for atmosphereless bodies. For these reasons it has turned out to be appropriate to reopen the question of a scattering model.

40|$|The {{remediation}} of soils {{which contain}} oil residues {{is a problem}} of considerable interest to environmental geotechnical engineering. In recent years, surfactants have been proposed as agents which can lower the interfacial tension between immiscible liquids and lead to the extraction of oil. The interaction between the oil phase within a porous medium and a penetrating surfactant gives rise to interesting fluid flow problems associated with moving interfaces. Whether or not the interface between the oil phase and the surfactant migrates either as a "front" or degenerates into "fingering" will depend on a variety of factors including the grain size and pore size distribution of the fine grain soil, the soil-surfactant-oil surface chemistry, the viscosity of the oil and the pressures that are associated with the injected surfactant. The objective of this research is to gain some understanding through experimental simulations, of how some of these factors influence the surfactant migration through a porous medium and to examine the influence of the particle size, size distribution and viscosity of the oil {{on the development of the}} various interface mechanisms. This objective was achieved by the design and fabrication of a laboratory model representing a highly idealized single well in situ injection scenario associated with an oil-saturated stratum of fine thickness.

The mixture model was modified with corrections for wall lift forces, hindered settling, slurry rheology and particle interactions. Predicted velocity profiles are in agreement with the experimental data of Fanglu and Wenzhen (1987), measured by laser doppler anemometry. Predicted density profiles are close to gamma ray tomography data, showing a density drop near the wall. The turbulence analysis showed that the change in the body shape from cylindrical to the conical section is one of the sources for the turbulence inside the cyclone. Once correct medium segregation was predicted, the performance characteristics of the DMC on coal were modelled using Lagrangian particle tracking for particles ranging in size from 0. 5 to 4 mm. The predicted Ep values are very close to the experimental values although a slight deviation in the cut-point predictions was observed.
