25|$|Another type of the badnjak {{that has}} {{developed}} among the Serbs has mostly replaced the traditional log, whose burning is usually unfeasible in modern homes. It is a cluster of oak twigs with their brown leaves still attached, with which the home is decorated on the Eve. This cluster is also called the badnjak, and it is usually kept in the home until next Christmas Eve. For the convenience of those living in towns and cities, such little badnjaks can be bought at marketplaces or distributed in churches.

5|$|The zduhaći {{of a band}} {{would leave}} their bodies in sleep and gather at an {{appointed}} place, before flying into a battle. They used various weapons, such as spindles, beech buds, sharp splinters, leaves, <b>stalks</b> <b>of</b> <b>straw,</b> fluff, flakes, sand, long twigs, cornel stones, pine cones, eggshells, and other light objects. As believed in Herzegovina, zduhaći uprooted gigantic firs and oaks and fought with them. However, the most powerful zduhać weapon was held to be a stick of luč (resinous wood burned to give light or used as kindling) charred at both ends, or any charred splinter of wood. A zduhać who was hit with this weapon would surely die. People therefore avoided igniting the sticks at both ends, and they took care that no splinters were left half-burned.|$|R
5|$|These ancient traditions have modern, reduced versions. Modern houses {{usually have}} no ognjište {{on which to}} burn a badnjak, {{but it may be}} symbolically {{represented}} by several oak twigs, some of which are burnt in a wood-burning kitchen stove and the others placed beside it. Some people chop the badnjak into shorter logs {{so that they can be}} put into the hearth and burnt. The most prevalent custom, however, is to place a cluster of oak twigs, with their brown leaves still attached, in whichever location in the home the family feels is appropriate. This cluster is also called the badnjak, and it is usually kept in the home until next Christmas Eve.

30|$|In {{order to}} obtain pulp, <b>stalks</b> <b>of</b> wheat <b>straw</b> from Kiev region {{harvested}} in 2015 were used. Averaged chemical composition relative to absolutely dry raw material (a.d.r.m.) was 44.2 % of cellulose, 18.6 % of lignin, 25.2 % of pentosans, 4.2 % of ash, 4.9 % of resin, fats and waxes, and 71.8 % of holocellulose. Chemical composition <b>of</b> wheat <b>straw</b> <b>stalks</b> was identified according to standard methods [29].

60|$|Then, on {{the slight}} {{turn of the}} Lower Hope Reach, {{clusters}} of factory chimneys come distinctly into view, tall and slender above the squat ranges of cement works in Grays and Greenhithe. Smoking quietly at the top against the great blaze of a magnificent sunset, they give an industrial character to the scene, speak of work, manufactures, and trade, as palm-groves on the coral strands of distant islands speak of the luxuriant grace, beauty and vigour of tropical nature. The houses of Gravesend crowd upon the shore with an effect of confusion {{as if they had}} tumbled down haphazard {{from the top of the}} hill at the back. The flatness of the Kentish shore ends there. A fleet of steam-tugs lies at anchor in front of the various piers. A conspicuous church spire, the first seen distinctly coming from the sea, has a thoughtful grace, the serenity of a fine form above the chaotic disorder of men's houses. But on the other side, on the flat Essex side, a shapeless and desolate red edifice, a vast pile of bricks with many windows and a slate roof more inaccessible than an Alpine slope, towers over the bend in monstrous ugliness, the tallest, heaviest building for miles around, a thing like an hotel, like a mansion of flats (all to let), exiled into these fields out of a street in West Kensington. Just round the corner, as it were, on a pier defined with stone blocks and wooden piles, a white mast, slender like a <b>stalk</b> <b>of</b> <b>straw</b> and crossed by a yard like a knitting-needle, flying the signals of flag and balloon, watches over a set of heavy dock- gates. Mast-heads and funnel-tops of ships peep above the ranges of corrugated iron roofs. This is the entrance to Tilbury Dock, the most recent of all London docks, the nearest to the sea.|$|R
30|$|In this {{research}} work, the organosolv pulp and nanocellulose were prepared from the wheat <b>straw,</b> one <b>of</b> {{the most abundant}} sources of cellulose for countries with limited supply of wood. Organosolv pulp was obtained from <b>stalks</b> <b>of</b> wheat <b>straw</b> by delignification in isobutanol–H 2 O–KOH–hydrazine solution, which is an effective system for removal of lignin and hemicellulose components. Thermochemical treatment of organosolv pulp using acetic acid and hydrogen peroxide was carried out for remove residual lignin and partial hydrolysis of hemicellulose. Organosolv pulp is an interesting low-cost starting material for nanocellulose production with using of sulfuric acid and sonication. The advantages of this method of nanocellulose preparation consist in using low concentration of sulfuric acid (43 %) before ultrasonic treatment <b>of</b> organosolv wheat <b>straw</b> pulp. To form the idea about the structure and properties of OSP nanocellulose, {{a wide variety of}} measurement methods (SEM, TEM, AFM, XRD, TGA and DTA, mechanical research) were used. It was found out that by using the method of acid hydrolysis and ultrasound treatment of OSP it is possible to obtain nanocellulose with density up to 1.3  g/cm 3, transparency up to 70 %, crystallinity degree 72.5 %. The TEM and AFM methods show that nanocellulose have diameter of particles in the range from 10 to 40  nm. Thermogravimetric analysis confirmed that nanocellulose films have more dense structure and smaller mass loss in the temperature range 220 – 260  °C compared with OSP. The obtained nanocellulose films had high Young’s modulus up to 11.45  GPa and tensile strength up to 42.3  MPa. The properties of obtained nanocellulose from OSP exhibit great potential in its application for the preparation of new nanocomposite materials, for example for production of biocomposites, which are applied in optoelectronic devices, packaging, and building.|$|R
