The latter is the thermodynamic minimum of the system. Below 473 K and with long reaction times (2 h, batch reactor), radical chlorination to form <b>pentachloroethane</b> is dominant.

40|$|A {{tungsten}} alkoxy scorpionate shows {{activity in}} the electrocatalytic reductive dehalogenation of <b>pentachloroethane</b> and trichloroethylene owing {{to the formation of}} hydrogen and halogen bonded adducts with the substrates, which is further reinforced by dispersive interactions. The ensuing proximity between the substrate molecule and the metal centre promotes dechlorination in a concerted process. Two-electron reduction of <b>pentachloroethane</b> yields trichloroethylene that undergoes further, non-catalysed, reactions that ultimately give acetylenes. Interestingly, <b>pentachloroethane</b> proved to be a highly efficient proton donor for the transient anions, in extremely exothermic and rapid proton transfer concerted with chloride anion abstraction, which yields perchloroethylene. The total process and the mechanism thereof were verified based on DFT and coupled cluster (CC) calculations. The calculations evaluated feasibility of various pathways in the mechanism.

40|$|HFC- 134 a can be {{produced}} on an industrial scale from trichloroethene. The trichloroethene for this process is produced via the oxychlorination of 1, 2 -dichl~roethane over a supported copper catalyst. Unfortunately, this process currently exhibits relatively poor selectivity towards trichloroethene and results {{in the formation of}} toxic, oligomeric by-products. The current process also produces significant. quantities of CO 2 through combustion ofits chlorocarbon feedstock. In order to understand the ongms of the selectivity of the oxychlorination of 1, 2 dichloroethane, this study has examined the chlorination and oxychlorination of higher chlorocarbons via thermodynamic calculations, eql;lilibrium measurements, and a continuous flow micro-reactor {{in order to understand the}} delicate balance. between the. surface and gas-phase chemistry within the system. It was found that the presence of the catalyst is not necessary to affect the desired chemistry. However, it was found that the presence of the catalyst favoured the formation of <b>pentachloroethane</b> and tetrachloroethene, as well as supplying chlorine via the Deacon process (conversion ofHCl and oxygen to chlorine). Tetrachloroethene was found to be the thermodynamic minimum of the system, with trichloroethene an intermediate in the formation oftetrachloroethene. At low temperatures Ã‚Â« 473 K) and long reaction times (2 h, batch reactor), radical chlorination to form <b>pentachloroethane</b> was the dominant reaction. Increasing the reaction temperature to > 573 K and moving from a batch to continuous system resulted in the loss ofradical chlorination activity for the system, with radical dehydrochlorination to form trichloroethene becoming the dominant reaction. Heterogeneous chlorination was be performed under flow conditions, and was found to provide a route to <b>pentachloroethane</b> and tetrachloroethene from. High conversions were found favour the formation of oligomeric products, and results suggest that trichloroethene and tetrachloroethene may themselves be major sources ofoligomer formation. Oxychlorination reactions using the continuous flow micro-reactor have shown that, for this system, it is possible to explain the observed chemistry by a series of chlorination and dehydrochlorination processes alone, without the need to invoke additional surface processes. Results have shown that the selectivity of the reaction can be manipulated by parameter control, and that, on a laboratory scale at least; the system can be operated with minimal oligimer and CO 2 formation. The knowledge gained from tIiis work provides a framework for the improvement ofthe industrial oxychlorination process. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

The decomposition of chloroform at 510 ˚C was investigated in a continuous flow system, using nitrogen as the carrier gas. The main products of the reaction were hydrogen chloride, tetrachloroethylene, <b>pentachloroethane</b> and hexachloroethane; hydrogen and chlorine could not be detected. Neither {{the addition of a}} radical initiator (azobisisobutyroni trile) nor an inhibitor (phenol) affected the breakdown, and so we have rejected the idea that the main reaction mechanism is of a radical nature. From the results obtained by varying the surface to volume ratio of the reactor, the reaction appeared to be catalysed by the surface of the reactor, but pretreating the tube by steaming, soaking in water or EDTA solution did not affect the pyrolysis. The reaction appeared to be virtually unaltered when a tube made from very pure silica was used. Kinetic investigations showed that the reaction was first order with respect to chloroform, and exhibited an induction period. Carrying out the reaction in a carbonised tube resulted in a faster reaction, and an increase in the induction period. To account for the results obtained, a mechanism is suggested which involves the formation of a carbon polymer on the silica reactor. Chloroform could then be adsorbed onto the polymer where reaction could occur. In a carbonised tube a graphite-like carbon structure may begin to take over as the catalyst.

The hexachloroethane dehalogenation activity of CYP 101 has been investigated by mutagenesis. The effects of active-site polarity and volume were probed by combinations of active-site mutations. Increasing the active-site hydrophobicity by the Y 96 A and Y 96 F mutations strengthened hexachloroethane binding but decreased the rate of reaction. Increasing the polarity with the F 87 Y mutation drastically weakened hexachloroethane binding but did not affect the rate of reaction. The Y 96 H mutation had little effect at pH 7. 4, but weakened hexachloroethane binding while increasing the rate of dehalogenation by up to 40 % at pH 6. 5, suggesting that the imidazole side-chain was partially protonated at pH 6. 5 but not at pH 7. 4. Substitutions by bulkier side-chains at F 87, T 101 and V 247 weakened hexachloroethane binding but increased the dehalogenation rate. The effect of the individual mutations was additive in multiple mutants, and the most active mutant for hexachloroethane reductive dehalogenation at pH 7. 4 was F 87 W-V 247 L (80 min- 1 or 2. 5 x the activity of the wild-type).

(ii) This reaction was promoted by the addition of iron powder or spongy titanium, and especially this effect was remarkable with the fitted quantities for each metal. It is suggested by this fact that some attention for the treating of aluminum containing these metals with chlorohydrocarbon at the temperature near the boiling point should be paid. (iii) The present study is not sufficient to explain the mechanism for the effect of the addition of these metals, but that may be concerned with the chlorides produc ing from these metals. 金属アルミニウムと四塩化炭素との反応については著者の一人浅岡等が昭和 21 年以来種々の実験を行いその結果を発表して来ており，雑誌『化学』の昭和 31 年 6 月号にはその頃までの報告の総括をなしている。それ以後も引続きこの反応に関しての発表をなして来ている。これ等の研究は主として夜相の沸点附近に於けるこの反応を塩化アルミニウム自己触媒反応とて取扱うのを主目標として来たのであるが，これは叉塩素化炭化水素と金属との反応の一つの代表としての価値をも認めて来たものでもある。そして塩素化炭化水素としては四塩化エタン，五塩化エタン及びトリクロロエチレン等を用いた実験も一部行って来ているが，一方に於て金属の側についてもアルミニウムの代りにアルミニウム合金とか他の金属とかの場合の反応を定性的には少し行ったりして来たのである。先ず鉄粉と四塩化炭素を液相の沸点附近に長時間加熱すれば六塩化エタンの生成が認められるから，これはアルミニウムの場合と全く類似の次式で示される反応が起ったものと推定される。 6 CCl_ 4 + 2 Fe = 3 C_ 2 Cl_ 6 + 2 FeCl_ 3 ところがこの反応の反応誘導期は極めて長く，自己触媒反応の過程に入ってからも反応の進行は極めて緩徐である。更にこの反応は予め塩化鉄や塩化アルミニウムを添加した場合には反応誘導期の可成の知縮が起り，後者の添加の方が著しく良好な事が知られた。本報に於てはアルミニウム以外の金属と四塩化炭素との反応の研究の予備段階として標題の研究をなした結果について述べるものである...|$|E

On the basis of evaluated literature, the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) proposes ecotoxicological environmental risk limits for these compounds for water, soil, sediment and air. The proposed environmental risk limits are the scientific basis for Environmental Quality Standards set by the interdepartmental Steering Group 'Substances'. Three levels have been distinguished: Negligible Concentrations (NC); Maximum Permissible Concentrations (MPC), a level at which no harmful effects are to be expected, and Serious Risk Concentrations (SRCeco), a level at which possible serious effects are to be expected. The environmental risk limits play an important role for the implementation of the national policy concerning substances. The substances evaluated in this report are: acrylonitrile, ethylene, ethylene oxide, dichloromethane, trichloromethane, tetrachloromethane, 1, 1 -dichloroethane, 1, 2 -dichloroethane, 1, 1, 1 -trichloroethane, 1, 1, 2 -trichloroethane, 1, 1, 2, 2 -tetrachloroethane, <b>pentachloroethane,</b> hexachloroethane, 1, 2 -dichloropropane, 1, 3 -dichloropropane, chloroethylene, 1, 1 -dichloroethylene, 1, 2 -dichloroethylene (trans- and cis- 1, 2 -dichloroethylene), trichloroethylene, tetrachloroethylene, 3 -chloropropene, 1, 3 -dichloropropene (trans- and cis- 1, 3 -dichloropropene), 2, 3 -dichloropropene, 2 -chlorobutadiene and hexachlorobutadiene.
