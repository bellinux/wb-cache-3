25|$|McDavid {{was born}} in 1997 in Richmond Hill, Ontario to Brian and Kelly McDavid. He has an older brother named Cameron. McDavid first skated at age 3, {{and the next year}} he started playing hockey; his parents lied about his age because <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> <b>required</b> to be 5 years old. When McDavid was 6, the hockey {{association}} in his hometown of Newmarket would not let him play above his age group. Instead of having him play in the lower level, McDavid's parents enrolled him with a team in nearby Aurora, where he played against players as old as 9. McDavid later joined the York-Simcoe Express, a team in Aurora, Ontario, where he was coached by his father, Brian; the team would win four Ontario Minor Hockey Association championships.|$|E
25|$|Second season casting {{opened on}} June 5, 2009, and closed on July 10, 2009. Applicants {{were invited to}} a {{television}} production studio in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, where they met with the producers and had a screen test to determine how they came across on television. Participants were selected for the show, in part, based on their strong personalities. The final eight participants were told in early September 2009 that they were selected for the show. The eight teens who appear in the second season were required to sign a confidentiality agreement prior to the commencement of filming. All the <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> <b>required</b> to take a three-day survival program with David Arama, a wilderness survival expert and close friend of Les Stroud's.

25|$|Participants in {{the trial}} were {{recruited}} when they sought medical care at general medical or psychiatric clinics. No advertising was used to recruit subjects {{in order to maximize}} the generalizability of the study results. <b>Participants</b> <b>were</b> <b>required</b> to have a minimum score of 14 point on the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D17) in order to be enrolled {{in the trial}}. Generally accepted cutoffs are 7–17 points for mild depression, 18–24 points for moderate depression, and ≥ 24 for severe depression. The average participant baseline HAM-D17 score was 22. The pre-specified primary endpoint of this trial was remission as determined by the HAM-D score, with all patients with missing scores rated as non-responders. In the aftermath of the trial, the investigators have presented the results mainly using the secondary endpoint of remission according to the QIDS-SR16 Score, which tend to be somewhat higher.|$|E

25|$|Pius X on his {{election}} made two decisions. He formally abolished the veto of heads of state, declaring {{that anyone who}} dared introduce a civil veto in the conclave would suffer automatic excommunication (future conclave <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> <b>required</b> {{to swear an oath}} not to transmit a veto by a secular monarch to the conclave), and declined to reappoint Rampolla as Secretary of State. Like his predecessors, Pope Pius X disputed the Kingdom of Italy's right to own Rome. Following the precedents established by his two immediate predecessors for the granting of the urbi et orbi blessing since the 1870 invasion of Rome, Pius X gave his first Urbi et Orbi on a balcony facing into St. Peter's Basilica rather than to the crowds outside, so as to symbolise his opposition to Italian rule of Rome and his demand for a return of the States of the Church.|$|E
2500|$|Wat Phra Dhammakaya {{became known}} for its {{emphasis}} on meditation, especially samatha meditation (meditation aiming at tranquility of mind). Every Sunday morning, meditation was taught to the public. Every weekend a meditation retreat {{was held at the}} temple at no cost. For these weekends, the temple started using the word dhutanga ('ascetic practice') for accommodation in the open air, a word normally used for monastic practice. Seven-day retreats were held regularly at several locations, during which <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> <b>required</b> to keep the eight precepts. Also, special retreats were led by Luang Por Dhammajayo himself in Doi Suthep. With regard to the three Trainings (...) in Buddhist teaching, the temple was described as the temple that represents the meditation aspect (...) , whereas the Santi Asoke movement represents the discipline aspect (...) and Luang Por Buddhadasa and his followers the wisdom aspect (...)

2500|$|In {{the first}} experiment, words and conflict-words were used (see first figure). The task {{required}} {{the participants to}} read the written color names of the words independently {{of the color of}} the ink (for example, they would have to read [...] "purple" [...] no matter what the color of the font). In experiment 2, stimulus conflict-words and color patches were used, and <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> <b>required</b> to say the ink-color of the letters independently of the written word with the second kind of stimulus and also name the color of the patches. If the word [...] "purple" [...] was written in red font, they would have to say [...] "red", rather than [...] "purple". When the squares were shown, the participant spoke the name of the color. Stroop, in the third experiment, tested his participants at different stages of practice at the tasks and stimuli used in the first and second experiments, examining learning effects.|$|E

2500|$|The organising of the {{festivals and}} {{supporting}} events were themselves practical workshops in every sense. The Nambassa spectacles were organised on a purely voluntary basis by energetic and visionary young unemployed hippies (at a time when New Zealand's unemployment rate was at an unprecedented high), coordinated into a cohesive working force by Terry. Three months out of each festival its supporters would assemble at a farm community called the [...] "Mother Centre", living in house trucks, vans, cars and tents. Nambassa's open door policy encouraged anyone of whatever race, creed or economic circumstance to join in, providing one met the basic rules of the Mother Centre camp. The guidelines were no alcohol or hard drugs, and vegetarian diet was supplied by the Trust. <b>Participants</b> <b>were</b> <b>required</b> to work each day towards the collective goal of preparing the festival in time for opening day. In exchange they were fed and had immediate needs catered for. Over the years thousands of people, young and old, carved out permanent careers from the inspiration learnt, just from being involved with or going to a Nambassa event.|$|E
