40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the status of}} the cognitive sphere among the children with the lengthy run of the <b>perennial</b> allergic <b>rhinitis</b> and elaborate the therapeutic tactics for the correction of the revealed disc orders, the researchers have examined 108 children aged between 14 and 15 years old. The research included patients with the exacerbation of the moderately severe or severe run of the <b>perennial</b> allergic <b>rhinitis</b> and length of the disease for no less than 3 years. As the basic therapy, the researchers prescribed mometasone nasal spray to all the children (Nasonex, Scheringcplough, USA). Before, in the course of and immediately right after the treatment, all the patients underwent the evaluation of the cognitive functions with the aid of the «binatest» and «mnemotest» test computer systems. The researchers determined the oxygen concentration in blood with handy pulse oximetry OXY 9. The research findings showed that 95, 3 % of the examined children suffered from the disorders of the cognitive functions. The application of the adequate anti-inflammatory therapy of the <b>perennial</b> allergic <b>rhinitis</b> effectively corrected the changes in the cognitive sphere of the children, suffering from the <b>perennial</b> allergic <b>rhinitis.</b> The oxygen concentration in blood of the children with the <b>perennial</b> allergic <b>rhinitis</b> remained normal at different stages of the disease.

40|$|The {{efficacy}} of budesonide, terfenadine and {{a combination of}} budesonide and oxymetazoline {{in the treatment of}} <b>perennial</b> <b>rhinitis</b> was evaluated by a double blind, parallel group study. Adult patients with <b>perennial</b> <b>rhinitis</b> were randomized into three groups. Group 1 patients received budesonide nasal aerosol 400 μg/day for 21 days and oxymetazoline nasal drops for the first three days. Group 2 and 3 patients received budesonide 400 μg/day and terfenadine tablet 60 mg twice/day respectively. Nasal symptoms were assessed by the patients before and daily during the treatment period using a simple scoring system. One hundred and forty-two patients were recruited and 130 completed the study. Budesonide, but not terfenadine, significantly reduced all nasal symptoms from baseline (p< 0. 05). Terfenadine could significantly relieve the nasal blockage (p< 0. 05) more than other nasal symptoms. Budesonide with or without oxymetazoline nasal drops provided a better control of nasal symptoms than terfenadine (p< 0. 05). Budesonide with oxymetazoline for the first three days showed a faster relief of nasal blockage than budesonide alone (p< 0. 05). Mild and transient adverse effects were encountered in all three groups.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Little {{is known}} about the {{epidemiology}} of rhinitis, particularly the perennial and non-allergic forms. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the symptoms, atopic state, and medical history of individuals with seasonal and <b>perennial</b> <b>rhinitis.</b> DESIGN: Of 7702 adults aged 16 - 65 years registered with a London general practice, 2969 (30 %) were screened by postal questionnaire. Samples of 113 subjects without rhinitis, 51 with seasonal symptoms alone, 128 with perennial symptoms and seasonal exacerbations were then interviewed. Atopic and non-atopic subjects were distinguished by skinprick testing with five common allergens. RESULTS: The estimated minimum prevalence of rhinitis was 24 %: 3 % had seasonal symptoms only, of whom 78 % were atopic; 13 % had perennial symptoms only, of whom 50 % were atopic; and 8 % had perennial symptoms with seasonal exacerbations, of whom 68 % were atopic. Seasonal rhinitis was characterised by sneezing, itching, and a high prevalence of diurnal variation in symptoms. The most common provoking factors were dust, pollens, and infections. By comparison, <b>perennial</b> <b>rhinitis</b> was characterised by a higher prevalence of nasal blockage and catarrh, and a lower prevalence of diurnal variation and provocation by pollen. There were no significant differences among the groups in the sociodemographic characteristics examined. Subjects with seasonal rhinitis were more likely to be atopic and to have eczema and a family history of hayfever than those without rhinitis. Those with <b>perennial</b> <b>rhinitis</b> were more likely to have past or current eczema or migraine, be wheezy or labelled asthmatic, or have a family history of nose trouble other than hayfever. Subjects with both seasonal and perennial symptoms presented an intermediate clinical picture. CONCLUSIONS: Seasonal and <b>perennial</b> <b>rhinitis</b> differ in their atopic state, clinical presentation, and medical history.

We were able to observe that nasal provocation with methacholine bromide, though on the one hand it was not able to provoke a significant reaction in the mucociliary transport function even though it caused a substantial reaction in the conductance in all five groups, on the other hand it caused a significant modification of nasal secretion with varying levels in the different groups. Furthermore, it was to be observed that nasal provocation with a cold water solution set at 2 - 4 °C caused a more significant reduction of the nasal conductance in subjects affected by <b>perennial</b> <b>rhinitis</b> of non-allergic origin in comparison to the other groups taken into consideration, even though it did not cause particular variations in the parameters relative to mucociliary transport and nasal secretion...|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{elevated}} intranasal temperature on symptoms {{and signs of}} <b>perennial</b> <b>rhinitis</b> were studied in 78 patients by a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled cUnical trial.

Each treat ment consisted of three 30 -minute sessions, during which the patient's intranasal temperature was raised by inhalation of saturated hot air (42 °C to 44 °C). Subjective response was recorded on a daily symptom score card during the week following treatment. Nasal patency was determined before and after treatment by measuring maximal nasal expiratory and inspiratory airflow and by measuring the area covered with vapor formed by the exhaled air on a plate.

The study was aimed at evaluating the cytokine profile in patients with seasonal and <b>perennial</b> allergic <b>rhinitis.</b> The cytokine profile of nasal secretion and blood serum of 44 patients with AR was studied. 24 of them had seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR), and 20 patients suffered from <b>perennial</b> allergic <b>rhinitis</b> (PAR).

However, population-based prospective data are scarce and do not cover new onset of rhinitis later in life. The authors studied the association between occupational exposure and adult onset of rhinitis prospectively. METHODS: The data of 4994 participants (age at follow-up 28 - 57 years) from 27 centres of the European Community Respiratory Health Survey II who were symptom-free at baseline were analysed. As outcome at follow-up self-reported (a) nasal allergies ("allergic rhinitis") and (b) runny, blocked nose for 12 months a year ("perennial rhinitis") were used. Occupational exposures at any time during follow-up were defined by job title. RESULTS: The cumulative incidence of allergic rhinitis, <b>perennial</b> <b>rhinitis</b> and both conditions was 12 %, 11 % and 3 %, respectively. Compared to office workers, male medical professionals were at increased risk of new onset of allergic rhinitis (OR 3. 0; 95 % CI 1. 4 to 6. 4).
