40|$|As are {{traditional}} fractionation technologies, static dry fractionation {{is a highly}} reliable technology for the consistent production of good-quality palm kernel stearin (PKS) for use as cocoa butter substitute (CBS) after total hydrogenation. A new process route now permits the production of unhardened yet high-quality CBS. Also an increase in total stearin yield can be achieved, via a successful refractionation of <b>palm</b> kernel <b>olein.</b> DSC analysis together with pilot static fractionation trials on the <b>palm</b> kernel <b>olein</b> indicates that a cooling water temperature that is too low (e. g., 17 degrees C) may result in the quick formation of unstable crystals that are possibly later converted to a more stable form. The resulting mixture of crystals with a possibly different polymorphic structure is easily squeezed through the filter cloth during filtration, whereas a slower, but more homogeneous co-crystallization occurs at higher temperature (18 degrees C or higher) and results {{in a much more}} stress-resistant slurry. Polarized light microscopy analysis confirmed that crystal size is not the only determining factor for a successful filtration. The total two-stage static fractionation of palm kernel oil (PKO) [iodine value (IV) 18] on a pilot scale results in the following three end products: PIKS IV 5 (yield: 29 %, for direct use as CBS), PK olein IV 27 (yield: 58 %), and PIKS IV 7 (yield: 13 % for use as CBS after full hydrogenation). The unhardened PKS IV 5 has outstanding melting and crystallization properties, comparable to traditional hydrogenated stearin fractions. Therefore, rather than the higher stearin yield, the reduced hydrogenation capacity is most probably the most important benefit of the two-stage static fractionation process. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Modification of the {{characteristics}} of palm oil (PO), sunflower oil, and <b>palm</b> kernel <b>olein</b> (PKOo) according to conventional three-component mixture designs was undertaken by a combination of blending and chemical interesterification (CIE) techniques. TAG composition and solid fat content (SFC) profile of the starting blends were analyzed and compared with those of the interesterified blends. Upon CIE, extensive re-arrangement of FA among TAG was evident. Concentrations of several TAG were increased, some were decreased, and several new TAG were formed. The resulting changes in TAG profile were reflected in the SFC of the blends. The SFC values of the chemically interesterified blends, except binary blends of PO/PKOo, revealed that they were softer than their respective starting blends. SFC data also indicated that eutectic interaction occurred between PO and PKOo in the starting blends and that this interaction was diminished after CIE. Paper no.

Blending of PS with PKOo reduced the SMP, SFC, altered the FAC and TAG composition and changed the crystal polymorphism from ᵝ to mixture of ᵝ and ᵝ'. The changes in the physicochemical properties of PS were due to the replacement of the high melting TAG in PS with medium chain TAG in PKOo. From the analysis, 1 : 1 and 3 : 2 were the better PSPKOo blend formulations ill slowing down the weight loss, respiration gases and gave better appearance when compared to other PSPKOo blends formulations. These two different coating formulations, 1 : 1 and 3 : 2 PSPKOo blends were applied onto guava by hand-wiping techniques" stored at 10 °C and 20 °C and were compared to beeswax (commercial coating) in terms of respiration gases, cohesiveness, weight loss, glossiness, colour and appearance. Guavas coated with 1 : 1 PSPKOo blend showed the lowest weight loss, while coating with 3 : 2 PSPKO showed the best guava appearance at 20 °C. Both the PSPKOo coating blends significantly reduced (p O. 05) was observed between the two coating formulations in terms of weight loss, ethylene gas concentrations, lightness, greenness and yellowness of guava for both storage temperatures. However, both coating resulted in better guava appearance than beeswax at both storage temperatures, The PSPKOo blend (at 31 %) was incorporated into chitosan of different degree of deacetylation (DD) (85 % and 95 %) and molecular weight (MW) (100. 000 and 300. 000 Da) to form films and the films were evaluated in terms of particle size, diameter and stability of emulsion and also thickness and tensile strength. The chitosan with 85 % DD (MW 300. 000 Da) + 31 % PSPKOo blend resulted in the strongest film and thus this chitosan was added with 15. 50 / 0 and 310 / 0 PSPKOo blends for comparison of physical properties of film. Emulsion blend containing 85 % DD (MW 300. 000 Da) and 31 % PSPKOo blend of chitosan gave the biggest particle size, highest viscosity and the most stable emulsion, resulting in the thickest film with the highest TS and EM.

40|$|<b>Palm</b> <b>olein</b> {{is one of}} {{the major}} palm oil {{products}} that domestically and industrially used as cooking or frying oil. <b>Palm</b> <b>olein</b> tends to crystallize at low temperature that limits its usage in temperate countries. In spite of various nutritional studies, <b>palm</b> <b>olein</b> is also not well considered as recommended choice due to its higher saturation content. Against these factors, there is a need to reduce its saturation content. In this study, the saturation content in <b>palm</b> <b>olein</b> was reduced through the combination of enzymatic interesterification and dry fractionation. Enzymatic interesterification allows interchanging of acyl groups between and within triacylglycerols (TAG) molecules, specifically at sn- 1 and - 3 positions to form new TAG species such as triunsaturated (mainly OLL, OLO, and OOO) and trisaturated TAG (PPP and PPS). The high melting trisaturated TAG can facilitate the crystallization of the interesterified <b>palm</b> <b>olein,</b> and easily removed as stearin fraction during fractionation process. Two sn- 1, 3 specific immobilized lipases; Lipozyme® TL IM (Thermomyces Lanuginosa) and Lipozyme® RM IM (Rhizomucor Miehei) were selected as biocatalysts for interesterification in solvent-free system. The pilot-scale enzymatic interesterification using packed-bed Lipozyme® TL IM produced the greatest amount of trisaturated TAG (5. 5...|$|E
40|$|AbstractVegetable oil {{is one of}} the {{bio-oils}} {{that have}} been promoted to replace petroleum-based products due to its eco- friendly characteristics. Palm oil has high productivity rate, and so it could fulfil the demand for a bio-lubricant. In this paper, the influence of the normal load on friction and wear performance were investigated for a RBD <b>palm</b> <b>olein</b> and compared with paraffinic mineral oil using four-ball tribotester. The normal load was varied from 30  kg to 60  kg. All experimental works were conforming to ASTM D 4172. The results exhibited that the RBD <b>palm</b> <b>olein</b> has lower coefficient of friction compared to paraffinic mineral oil. However, the wear scar of ball bearings lubricated with RBD <b>palm</b> <b>olein</b> showed larger diameter compared to paraffinic mineral oil. As a conclusion, RBD <b>palm</b> <b>olein</b> has better performance compared to paraffinic mineral oil in terms of capability to reduce friction...|$|E

Wherein, pressure applied between surface to surface contacts and sliding between surface in gear and wet clutch mechanism. From this research, the results provide an understanding of RBD <b>Palm</b> <b>Olein</b> performance against extreme pressure condition. It was found that RBD <b>Palm</b> <b>Olein</b> oil has good mild extreme pressure properties, but film breakdown occurs at higher pressure load. The frictional torque results also indicated with pressure increment, the friction force occurs between moving bodies also increase...|$|E

The normal load was set to 40 kg and the test oil was heated up to 75 °C before the experiments. The result showed that <b>palm</b> <b>olein</b> has low friction coefficient compared to additive-free paraffinic mineral oil...|$|E
