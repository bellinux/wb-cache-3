2500|$|When back at Fort Benning, Christopher {{attacked}} a fellow soldier with a <b>paring</b> <b>knife</b> {{in what was}} described as an unprovoked attack. The soldier survived the attack and Christopher {{was placed in the}} fort's stockade, where he attempted suicide by cutting himself with a razor. In a subsequent psychiatric session, he told a psychiatrist that he [...] "had to" [...] kill blacks. This admission caused Christopher's home to be searched by the police. There the police found evidence linking Christopher to three murders, which led to his indictment in April 1981 and his transfer back to Buffalo for his trial on May 8.|$|E
2500|$|A knife (plural knives) {{is a tool}} with {{a cutting}} edge or blade, {{hand-held}} or otherwise, with most having a handle. [...] Some types of knives are used as utensils, including knives used at the dining table (e.g., butter knives and steak knives) and knives used in the kitchen (e.g., <b>paring</b> <b>knife,</b> bread knife, cleaver). Many types of knives are used as tools, such as the combat knife carried by soldiers, the pocket knife carried by hikers and the hunting knife used by hunters. Knives are also used as a traditional or religious implement, such as the kirpan. Some types of knives are used as weapons, such as daggers or switchblades. Some types of knives are used as sports equipment (e.g., throwing knives). Knives are also used in agriculture, food harvesting etc.; the sickle, the scythe and even the combine harvester are knives.|$|E
2500|$|Eaton {{made his}} major league debut for the Padres on May 30, 2000, against the Milwaukee Brewers, and {{won his first}} major league game. He went 7–4 in the [...] season, {{striking}} out 90 in 135 innings, and posting a 4.13 ERA. Eaton did not lose in his first eight starts as a Padre, posting a 1–0 record with a 3.02 ERA. He posted the best day game ERA in the National League (2.34), and became the third Padres pitcher, after Juan Eichelberger and Doug Brocail, to steal two bases in a single season. His batting average (.289) led all major league pitchers. Eaton's first full season in the major leagues, , produced mixed results. Eaton suffered a bizarre injury when he accidentally stabbed himself in the stomach while trying to open a DVD package with a <b>paring</b> <b>knife,</b> and underwent season-ending [...] "Tommy John" [...] surgery on August 21. Before his injuries, Eaton posted an 8–5 record with a 4.32 ERA. This season also produced his first two career complete games, and he posted two ten-strikeout games against the Houston Astros and the San Francisco Giants.|$|E
5000|$|The chef’s costume, {{the jacket}} and hat, or “toque”, are steeped {{in history and}} {{tradition}} which members honor by dressing appropriately for each regular event and by wearing a Les Marmitons jacket and hat.

50|$|A {{variety of}} {{different}} Opinels have been offered over the years. A few are sold more for their novelty value than for practical purposes, such as Le Géant. Besides the Slim Effile series and the Couteau du Jardin, Opinel also offers a hawkbill-bladed pruning knife designed {{for use in the}} garden or vineyard, and a large folding wood saw with locking blade using the same Virobloc mechanism as found on large Opinel knives. For the kitchen, the company sells vegetable peelers, chefs <b>knives,</b> <b>paring</b> <b>knives,</b> knives with corkscrews (couteau tire-bouchon), and prep knives for the kitchen, including a mushroom knife (couteau à champignon), with an integral boar's hair cleaning brush.|$|R
50|$|Very sharp knives sharpen {{at about}} 10 dps (degrees per side) (which {{implies that the}} knife's edge has an {{included}} angle of 20-degrees). Generally speaking, razors, <b>paring</b> <b>knives,</b> and fillet knives should be the sharpest knives at an angle of 12° - 18°. Most kitchen knives, like utility/slicing knives, chef’s knives, boning knives, carving knives, should be sharpened to 15° - 25°. The exceptions are Japanese style knives that are usually sharpened to 14° - 16° depending on the knife maker. Japanese style knives utilize a much harder steel, {{and are therefore more}} brittle than their Western style counterparts. This means care should be taken when handling these knives as they are susceptible to chipping and breaking. The sporting knife category, including pocket knives, survival knives, and hunting knives, sees more intense action and should be sharpened to the 25° - 30° angle range. The less sharp angle means there is more metal there to cut, thus providing more durability out in the field. For an extremely durable edge, a machete, chisel, drawknife or ax should be sharpened down to 30° - 40° providing even more ruggedness and longer lasting sharpness.|$|R

50|$|For culinary use, a zester, grater, {{vegetable}} peeler, <b>paring</b> <b>knife,</b> {{or even a}} surform tool is used {{to scrape}} or cut zest from the fruit. Alternatively, the peel is sliced, then excess pith (if any) cut away.|$|E
5000|$|In kitchen usage, {{a utility}} knife is between a chef's knife and <b>paring</b> <b>knife</b> in size, about 10 cm and 18 cm (4 and 7 inches) in length. The utility knife has {{declined}} in popularity, {{and is at}} times derided as filler for knife sets[...] This decline is attributed to the knife being : compared to a chef's knife, it is too short for many food items, has insufficient clearance when used at a cutting board, and is too fragile for heavier cutting tasks, while compared to a <b>paring</b> <b>knife,</b> which is used when cutting between one's hands, (e.g., carving a radish), the added length offers no benefit and indeed makes control harder in these fine tasks. [...] Some designs have a serrated blade.|$|E
50|$|Larkin favored {{varieties}} of pine, especially white pine and sugar pine, when carving her pieces, {{and an average}} sculpture took about two days to carve.

5000|$|... 16th century French bookbinders used a tool {{also known}} as a <b>paring</b> <b>knife</b> (couteau à parer) to thin the edges of the leather binding being {{prepared}} to cover a book in order to ensure it was neater and stuck better to the board. The knife was a large piece of steel, very thin at the cutting edge, with a wooden handle.|$|E
50|$|A {{kitchen knife}} is any knife that is {{intended}} to be used in food preparation. While much of this work can be accomplished with a few general-purpose knives - notably a large chef's knife, a tough cleaver, and a small <b>paring</b> <b>knife</b> - there are also many specialized knives that are designed for specific tasks. Kitchen knives can be made from several different materials.|$|E
50|$|A <b>paring</b> <b>knife</b> {{is a small}} {{knife with}} a plain edge blade that is ideal for peeling and other small or {{intricate}} work (such as de-veining a shrimp, removing the seeds from a jalapeño, 'skinning' or cutting small garnishes). It {{is designed to be}} an all-purpose knife, similar to a chef's knife, except smaller. Paring knives are usually between 6 and 10 cm (2½ and 4 inches) long.|$|E
50|$|Also {{known as}} a bird's beak knife, a peeling knife has a pointed tip that curves {{downward}} (sometimes upward) and {{from side to side}} (towards the blade). It can be used to cut decorative garnishes (such as rosettes or fluted mushrooms), slice soft fruits, or to remove skins and blemishes. It is also used to make a cut {{known as a}} tourné cut in vegetables such as carrots. It is a specialized type of <b>paring</b> <b>knife.</b>|$|E
50|$|A peeler (potato peeler or {{vegetable}} peeler) is a kitchen tool {{consisting of a}} slotted metal blade attached to a handle {{that is used to}} remove the outer skin or peel of certain vegetables, often potatoes and carrots, and fruits such as apples, pears, etc. A <b>paring</b> <b>knife</b> may also be used to peel vegetables. A peeler differs from a knife in that the blade has a slot cut into it, which is sharpened on the inside edge, while the other side prevents the blade from cutting too far into the vegetable.|$|E
5000|$|Durst {{claimed he}} and Black, a cranky and confrontational loner, {{struggled}} {{for control of}} Durst's [...]22-caliber target pistol after Black grabbed it from its hiding place and threatened him with it. During the struggle, the pistol discharged, shooting Black in the face. During cross-examination, Durst admitted to using a <b>paring</b> <b>knife,</b> two saws, and an axe to dismember Black's body before bagging and dumping his remains in Galveston Bay. Black's head was never recovered, so prosecutors were unable to present sufficient forensic evidence to dispute Durst's account of the struggle. As a result of lack of forensics, the jury acquitted Durst of murder.|$|E
5000|$|Kitchen knives {{generally}} either {{feature a}} curve near the tip, as in a chef's knife, or are straight for their entire length. The edge itself may be generally smooth (a [...] "straight" [...] or [...] "clean" [...] edge), {{or may be}} serrated or scalloped (have [...] "teeth") in some way. Lastly, the point may differ in shape: most common is a sharp, triangular point (not pictured), as in a chef's knife or <b>paring</b> <b>knife,</b> though the French point (also called [...] "Sheep's foot") is common in santokus, and a round point is sometimes found on long slicing knives.|$|E

50|$|Persimmons are eaten fresh, dried, raw, or cooked. When eaten fresh, {{they are}} usually eaten whole like an apple in bite-size slices, and may be peeled. One way to consume ripe persimmons, which may have soft texture, is to remove the top leaf with a <b>paring</b> <b>knife</b> and scoop out the flesh with a spoon. Riper persimmons can also be eaten by {{removing}} the top leaf, breaking the fruit in half, and eating from the inside out. The flesh ranges from firm to mushy, and the texture is unique. The flesh is sweet and, when firm owing to being unripe, possesses an apple-like crunch. American persimmons (Diospyros virginiana) and Diospyros digyna are completely inedible until they are fully ripe.|$|E

50|$|In January 1994, Kristina Fetters {{was sent}} to Orchard Place, an {{unlocked}} facility in Des Moines for children with behavioral or mental health problems, and she was put on Prozac. On October 25, 1994, {{the morning of the}} murder, Fetters and her roommate, Jeanie Fox, escaped from the facility and hitchhiked to her great-aunt Arlene Klehm's home in northern Polk County, Iowa. Allegedly, Fetters had previously discussed with other girls at Orchard Place about her plan to rob and kill her great-aunt. When Fetters and Fox arrived at Klehm's home, the young girls waited for visitors to leave before entering the home. Once inside the home, Fetters reportedly struck Klehm on the head with a frying pan, then attempted to slit Klehm's throat before stabbing her in the back with a <b>paring</b> <b>knife.</b> The two girls attempted to rob the house, but after being unable to find the keys to the safe or Klehm's truck, they left the scene. After police were called to the house, they discovered the murder, and Kristina Fetters was arrested that night and confessed to the crime.|$|E
50|$|On March 1, 2004, Shuvender Sem, who {{had been}} {{enrolled}} at the university for less than two months, stabbed another student {{in the face with}} a pen during a class called Teaching for Enlightenment. Told by university staff that he did not require medical attention, the injured student drove himself to the hospital where he received seven stitches. University officials consulted a psychologist and decided that Sem would have to leave the university, but didn't report the incident to police. Sem didn't appear dangerous or agitated and was taken by Joel Wysong, the school's dean of men, to his on-campus apartment until he could take a flight home the next morning. Left unattended, Sem took a <b>paring</b> <b>knife</b> from Wysong's kitchen and went to the university's dining hall. Wysong followed Sem to the dining hall and watched while Sem interacted with other students, but did not take him back into custody. After about ten minutes and without provocation, Sem stabbed another student, freshman Levi Butler, four times in the chest, killing him.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the early}} morning hours of September 5, 1972, members of Black September broke into the Israeli {{quarters}} of the Olympic Village. After seizing the coaches in the first apartment and wounding wrestling coach Moshe Weinberg in the face, the hostage takers forced Weinberg to lead them to other potential hostages in another apartment. There, they seized six wrestlers and weightlifters, including Romano. As the athletes were being led back to the coaches' apartment, Weinberg attacked the hostage takers, which allowed wrestler Gad Tsobari to escape but resulted in Weinberg's death by gunfire. Once inside the apartment, Romano attacked the intruders, slashing Afif Ahmed Hamid in the face with a <b>paring</b> <b>knife</b> and grabbing his AK-47 away from him before being shot to death. According to a report publicized in December 2015, Romano was tortured by the terrorists before being killed. The terrorists cut off his genitals in front of their other prisoners. [...] Romano's bloodied corpse was left at the feet of his teammates all day as a warning. The other nine Israeli athletes were killed during a bungled German rescue attempt later that night.|$|E
5000|$|On June 22, 1990, Dillbeck {{was working}} with other prison inmates at a {{catering}} function at Quincy Vocational Center in Quincy, Florida.

Dillbeck purchased a <b>paring</b> <b>knife</b> and on June 24, 1990, less than 48 hours after his escape, he approached a woman named Faye Vann who was sitting in her vehicle {{in the parking lot of}} the Tallahassee Mall. Governor Bob Martinez criticized the incident, ordering tighter custody of inmates and fired the corrections officers involved. According to a 1991 article, the case was [...] "reminiscent" [...] of Willie Horton being released in 1988 by Michael Dukakis's release programs. Armed with the knife, Dillbeck attempted to carjack the vehicle entering it, but Vann resisted. He then stabbed Vann repeatedly, causing her death. The vehicle crashed in the Mall lot and Dillbeck fled on foot chased by a Mall Security Officer [...] First reports to 911 were of a vehicle crash then soon were relayed as a stabbing and a Security Officer in foot pursuit of the suspect. [...] Dillbeck was subsequently arrested by police a short time later still armed with the knife in a back yard of a nearby house.|$|E
5000|$|The average Chinese home uses some {{variation}} of the rectangular-bladed knife, usually around 18 cm to 28 cm (7-11 inches) in length. Traditional knives had a simply-forged, carbon steel blade with a long, ground bevel, but the typical Chinese chef's knife is now a stamped blade. The traditional handle is a full-length tang that is only about 1 or 2 cm wide, which is passed through a metal cap, then {{through the center of}} a round, wood dowel, then bent over and hammered into the end of the handle to retain it. Newer models, particularly those made in Japan or Germany, have full-width tangs and riveted or injection-molded handles, but these handles generally retain something of the traditional, round cross-section. The wide blade of Caidao keeps the cook's fingers well off the cutting surface and the round handle gives a nice [...] "pivot point" [...] for the cutting stroke. The blade has a curvature or rocker along its edge that is generally uniform, improving the knife's ability to chop and mince meats and vegetables. The broad rectangular blade also serves to scoop up chopped food for transport to the wok or bowl. Although it may seem unwieldy, skilled practitioners worldwide may be observed using this style of knife for everything — even carving and fine work normally accomplished with a <b>paring</b> <b>knife.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In 1924, Vassos {{created his}} first {{industrial}} design, a lotion bottle popular as a hip flask during Prohibition. In 1933 he designed the widely popular Perey turnstile still {{used in many}} subway stations. Other notable designs included a streamlined <b>paring</b> <b>knife,</b> Hohner accordions, computers, an electron microscope for the RCA company, corporate logos, and shotguns. These highly functional and visually striking designs include major forms of media in the 20th century. His strengths in designing media tools for consumers and professionals alike set him apart from other industrial designers. Vassos designed numerous radios, phonograph players, the Constellation jukebox for the Mills Company, and total environments for movie theaters, international expositions, and restaurants. John Vassos’s contributions to public projects like the famous RCA Building for the 1939/1940 New York World’s Fair, have been overlooked for decades. John Vassos Consulting considered RCA, NBC, United Artists, Waterman Pens, Coke-Cola, Wallace Silver, Nedick’s, Mills Industries, and the United States Government among its scores of national clients. Vassos designed the cabinets of the RCA Corporation's first commercially available television sets. For the 1939 New York World's Fair he created a novel TV cabinet in transparent Lucite plastic {{as well as the}} company's first mass-produced television sets - the TRK12, TRK-9, and TRK-5 which were sold at major department stores in the New York metropolitan area. [...] He created the visionary [...] "Musicorner" [...] for the America at Home Pavilion also at the 1939/1940 New York World's Fair, which was the first vision of an integrated media-centered room which combined radio, television, and record player housed within a single cabinet. In 1941, Vassos designed the RCA 621TS television set, which was slated to be sold the following year as a 1942 model. However, after Pearl Harbor and America's entry into World War II, manufacture of most consumer goods (including radio and television sets) was prohibited {{for the duration of the}} war, so the design was withheld until the end of the war, when it was brought out in 1946 as a limited run model until the post-war designs were fully ready. [...] His industrial design contributions at RCA spanned over 40 years and included the designs for microphones, broadcast equipment, transmitter buildings, RCA's first color television camera which became the standard in the field, and the RCA 501 computer among many other hundreds of products for the company.|$|E
