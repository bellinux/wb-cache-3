40|$|Three {{historical}} {{ethnic minorities}} {{are present in}} Calabria: Albanians, Greeks, and Occitans. The Albanian ethnic minority is the more populous, having settled in Calabria between the 15 th and 17 th centuries, and these populations are now located in the <b>provinces</b> <b>of</b> <b>Cosenza</b> and Catanzaro. In the present study the Albanian population structure is analyzed based on the allele frequencies of six classic genetic markers: ACP, GC, PGM 1, AK, ADA, and 6 PGD. The results show a significant heterogeneity between the Albanian population in Calabria and the population in Molise. Therefore the cultural and reproductive isolation of the Albanian ethnic minority of Calabria is related to a great genetic peculiarity. Moreover, the frequencies of some alleles, particularly those of the PGM* 1 W 31 variant, and {{the analysis of the}} R matrix still show the actual peculiar genetic structure of the Albanians of Calabria, although the genetic flow is evident in the decrease of endogamy and in the increase in the degree of mixing...|$|R
50|$|Today Magliocco Dolce {{is found}} almost {{exclusively}} in Calabria though {{the exact number of}} plantings of the grape variety is hard to determine because for many years the grape was often confused and inter-planted in field blends with other varieties. Even in the official 2000 census, plantings of Magliocco Canino and Magliocco Dolce were counted together though ampelographers believe that most of the Calabrian plantings in the <b>provinces</b> <b>of</b> Catanzaro, <b>Cosenza</b> and Crotone <b>of</b> the 616 acres reported are Magliocco Dolce.|$|R
5000|$|The Apulo-Calabrese is {{particularly}} {{associated with the}} <b>provinces</b> <b>of</b> Catanzaro, <b>Cosenza</b> and Reggio di Calabria, and with the area of Lagonegro in the <b>province</b> <b>of</b> Potenza. In the early 20th century, local sub-types from these areas were known as the Catanzarese, the Cosentina, the Reggitana and the Lagonegrese respectively; these types are now considered extinct. The Calabrese was the principal pig of the region; in the mid-1920s the population was recorded as 131,736. Numbers fell drastically after the Second World War, and in particular from the 1970s, following the introduction of faster-growing foreign breeds such as the British Yorkshire.|$|R

5000|$|The first {{mention of}} a [...] "Magliocca" [...] grape dates to the late 15th century when it was {{documented}} growing in the Calabria region. However, which [...] "Magliocco" [...] grape this was is not yet known. Ampelographers have speculated that since the name Magliocco means [...] "tender knot" [...] in Greek that potentially Magliocco Dolce (or Magliocco Canino) could have originated in Greece. Additionally, Magliocco Dolce has been known under the synonym of Greco nero around the village of Lamezia Terme. However, DNA evidence in the early 21st century has {{cast doubt on the}} validity of that theory with it being far more likely that both grapes originated in southern Italy. The early synonym Arvino suggest that potentially Magliocco Dolce originated near Lago Arvo on the La Sila plateau that straddles the borders <b>of</b> the <b>provinces</b> <b>of</b> Catanzaro, <b>Cosenza</b> and Crotone in Calabria.|$|R

40|$|An endemic goiter {{study was}} carried out in a vast {{territory}} of the Calabria region, including the <b>provinces</b> <b>of</b> Catanzaro and <b>Cosenza.</b> About 50 % of 7231 school-children, aged between 6 and 12 years, examined in 34 villages, presented a thyroid enlargement. The high prevalence of goiter seems to be related to a moderate iodine deficiency intake indicated by a mild urinary iodine excretion (lower than 100 micrograms/g creatinine). In a few villages, in which a two year voluntary iodine prophylaxis {{was carried out}}, an increase in the urinary iodine excretion with a decreased goiter prevalence was observed. A slight increase in TT 3, FT 3 and TSH in one endemic area studied, compared to the control area, was also observed.
