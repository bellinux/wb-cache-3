5|$|During Sophia's lifetime, {{there were}} various rumours about her alleged incestuous {{relationship}} with her brother, Ernest Augustus, Duke of Cumberland, who later became the King of Hanover. The Prince Regent supposedly warned his sisters not to be alone {{in the same room}} with the Duke, and Cumberland was deeply unpopular with the British people. It is unclear whether there was truth to these rumours or whether they were circulated by the Duke's numerous <b>political</b> <b>enemies.</b>|$|E
5|$|Operation Sandwedge was a {{proposed}} clandestine intelligence-gathering operation against the <b>political</b> <b>enemies</b> of the Richard Nixon presidential administration. The proposals were {{put together by}} H. R. Haldeman, John Ehrlichman and Jack Caulfield in 1971. Caulfield, a former police officer, created a plan to target the Democratic Party and the anti-Vietnam War movement, inspired by what he {{believed to be the}} Democratic Party's employment of a private investigation firm.|$|E
5|$|Word of Sharp's alleged claims soon reached Jereboam Beauchamp, {{reviving}} {{his resolve}} to kill him. Beauchamp abandoned {{the idea of}} killing Sharp honorably in a duel. Instead, he decided to murder him and cast suspicion on his <b>political</b> <b>enemies.</b> To add to the intrigue, Beauchamp plotted to commit the murder {{on the eve of}} the General Assembly's opening session.|$|E

5|$|During the {{campaign}} Shelby's <b>political</b> <b>enemies,</b> notably Humphrey Marshall, criticized {{his response to}} Jefferson's second letter regarding the Genêt affair and questioned his loyalty to the United States. Shelby contended that his noncommittal response to the letter was meant to draw the federal government's attention {{to the situation in}} the west. He cited the agreement between Washington and the Spanish as evidence that his ploy had worked. He also claimed to have known at the time he wrote the letter that the French scheme was destined to fail.|$|E
5|$|Empress Matilda (c. 7 February 110210 September 1167), {{also known}} as the Empress Maude, was the {{claimant}} to the English throne during the civil war known as the Anarchy. The daughter of King Henry I of England, she moved to Germany as a child when she married the future Holy Roman Emperor Henry V. She travelled with her husband into Italy in 1116, was controversially crowned in St. Peter's Basilica, and acted as the imperial regent in Italy. Matilda and Henry had no children, and when Henry died in 1125, the crown was claimed by Lothair II, one of his <b>political</b> <b>enemies.</b>|$|E
5|$|Fields' <b>political</b> <b>enemies</b> {{charged him}} with {{corruption}} and chastised him for issuing too many pardons. He also drew criticism for appointing his eldest son as state examiner, political supporter James Brown as tax commissioner, and other relatives and political supporters to low-ranking positions in the state government. Although the party strongly supported Alben Barkley's senatorial bid in 1926, Fields and his allies refused to support 1927 gubernatorial candidate J. C. W. Beckham, and the governorship went to Republican Flem D. Sampson.|$|E

5|$|Goebel's {{abrasive}} personality {{made him}} many <b>political</b> <b>enemies,</b> but his championing of populist causes, like railroad regulation, also won him many friends. This conflict of opinions {{came to a}} head in the Kentucky gubernatorial election of 1899. Goebel, a Democrat, divided his party with self-serving political tactics at a time when Kentucky Republicans were finally gaining strength, having elected the party's first governor four years previously. These dynamics led to a close contest between Goebel and William S. Taylor. In the politically chaotic climate that resulted, Goebel was assassinated. Everyone charged in connection with the murder was either acquitted or eventually pardoned, and the identity of his assassin remains uncertain.|$|E
5|$|In 132, Zhang {{introduced}} an intricate seismoscope to the court, which he claimed could detect the precise cardinal {{direction of a}} distant earthquake. On one occasion his device indicated that an earthquake had occurred in the northwest. As there was no perceivable tremor felt in the capital his <b>political</b> <b>enemies</b> were briefly able to relish the failure of his device, until a messenger arrived shortly afterwards to report that an earthquake had occurred about 400km (248mi) to 500km (310mi) northwest of Luoyang in Gansu province.|$|E
5|$|On 19 August AD 14, Augustus {{died while}} visiting Nola {{where his father}} had died. Both Tacitus and Cassius Dio wrote that Livia was rumored to have brought about Augustus' death by {{poisoning}} fresh figs. This element features in many modern works of historical fiction pertaining to Augustus' life, but some historians view it {{as likely to have}} been a salacious fabrication made by those who had favoured Postumus as heir, or other of Tiberius' <b>political</b> <b>enemies.</b> Livia had long been the target of similar rumors of poisoning on the behalf of her son, most or all of which are unlikely to have been true.|$|E

5|$|Röhm {{hoped to}} assume {{command of the}} army and absorb it into the ranks of the SA. Hindenburg and Defence Minister Werner von Blomberg {{threatened}} to impose martial law if the alarming activities of the SA were not curtailed. Hitler also suspected that Röhm was plotting to depose him, so he ordered the deaths of Röhm and other <b>political</b> <b>enemies.</b> Up to 200 people were killed from 30 June to 2 July 1934 in an event that became known as the Night of the Long Knives. After this purge, the SA was no longer a major force.|$|E
5|$|Though {{she never}} wed, rumours spread that Sophia became {{pregnant}} by Thomas Garth, an equerry of her father's, and {{gave birth to}} an illegitimate son {{in the summer of}} 1800. Other gossip declared the child was the product of rape by her elder brother the Duke of Cumberland, who was deeply unpopular. Historians are divided on the validity of these stories, as some believe she gave birth to Garth's child while others call them tales spread by the Royal Family's <b>political</b> <b>enemies.</b>|$|E
5|$|Whether Sharp {{had made}} the claim is uncertain, but Beauchamp {{believed}} he had. He planned to murder him and flee with Anna to Missouri. He would murder Sharp {{in the early morning}} of November 7, 1825, when the new legislature convened its session, as he hoped that suspicion would fall on Sharp's <b>political</b> <b>enemies.</b> Three weeks prior to that date, Beauchamp sold his property, telling his friends that he was planning to move to Missouri. He hired laborers to help load his wagons two days before the planned murder.|$|E

5|$|With Adair constitutionally ineligible to seek {{a second}} {{consecutive}} term, Desha was the first candidate to publicly declare his intention to seek the governorship in 1824. He began his campaign in late 1823 and faced little opposition until Christopher Tompkins declared his candidacy in May 1824. Tompkins was a little-known judge from Bourbon County who vehemently held {{to the principles of}} the Anti-Relief faction. Colonel William Russell, a military veteran of 50 years, also sought to carry the mantle of the Anti-Relief faction. While not as eloquent or well-versed in the faction's rhetoric, he had few <b>political</b> <b>enemies</b> and his military career brought him great respect among the electorate.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to Puerto Rico in 1859, Betances established {{a very successful}} surgery and ophthalmology practice in Mayagüez. Even fierce <b>political</b> <b>enemies</b> such as Spanish pro-monarchy journalist José Pérez Morís regarded Betances as the best surgeon in Puerto Rico at the time. His good reputation in Puerto Rico would survive his stay in the island nation for many years. In 1895, while Betances was living in Paris, the manufacturers of the Emulsión de Scott (a codfish liver oil product that is still sold today, manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline in modern times), paid an endorsement fee to Betances to have him appear on advertisements on Spanish language magazines and newspapers all over New York City and the Caribbean, based on his solid reputation as a doctor.|$|E
5|$|During {{the course}} of the Peloponnesian War, Alcibiades changed his {{political}} allegiance several times. In his native Athens in the early 410s BC, he advocated an aggressive foreign policy and was a prominent proponent of the Sicilian Expedition, but he fled to Sparta after his <b>political</b> <b>enemies</b> brought charges of sacrilege against him. In Sparta, he served as a strategic adviser, proposing or supervising several major campaigns against Athens. In Sparta too, however, Alcibiades soon made powerful enemies and felt forced to defect to Persia. There he served as an adviser to the satrap Tissaphernes until his Athenian political allies brought about his recall. He then served as an Athenian general (Strategos) for several years, but his enemies eventually succeeded in exiling him a second time.|$|E

25|$|In {{exile in}} the United States, Calles was {{in contact with}} various U.S. fascists, {{although}} he rejected their anti-Semitic and anti-Mexican sentiments, and also befriended José Vasconcelos, a Mexican philosopher who had previously been a <b>political</b> <b>enemy.</b>|$|R
5|$|Given {{the heated}} {{political}} {{environment of the}} Old Court-New Court controversy, allies of his father claimed that the governor's <b>political</b> <b>enemies</b> had framed his son. The governor's legislative allies passed legislation providing for a favorable change of venue for the trial, and the governor used his appointment power to ensure that sympathetic judges would hear the case. Isaac Desha was twice convicted, but both times, {{the judge in the}} case set aside the verdict on procedural grounds. While awaiting a third trial, Desha attempted suicide by slitting his throat, but doctors saved his life, reconnecting his severed windpipe with a silver tube. Shortly after the suicide attempt, Governor Desha issued a pardon for his son.|$|E
5|$|Hindman's edicts, however, {{raised the}} ire of the local citizenry, and his <b>political</b> <b>enemies</b> demanded that the Confederate leaders in Richmond replace him. By August 1862, the {{authorities}} in Richmond decided to replace him with the well-meaning but incompetent Theophilus H. Holmes. Hindman convinced Holmes {{to give him a}} field command in northern Arkansas, and he proceeded with a plan to drive out the invader. Hindman aggressively moved into northwest Arkansas and managed to intercept the Federal army while it was divided into two parts. At this moment, however, Hindman's normally aggressive style gave way to uncharacteristic doubt. Rather than attack the divided pieces of the Federal army, Hindman entrenched himself at Prairie Grove, Arkansas, allowing the Federal forces to recombine and assault him.|$|E
5|$|In 1820, rumors {{surfaced}} that Sharp had fathered a stillborn {{illegitimate child}} with Anna Cooke, a planter's daughter. Sharp denied the charge, and the immediate political effects were minimal. When {{the charges were}} repeated during Sharp's 1825 General Assembly campaign, opponents publicized the allegation {{that the child was}} a mulatto. Whether Sharp made such a claim, or whether it was a rumor started by his <b>political</b> <b>enemies,</b> remains in doubt. Jereboam Beauchamp, who had married Cooke in 1824, avenged the honor of his wife by fatally stabbing Sharp at his home early on the morning of November 7, 1825. Sharp's murder inspired fictional works, most notably Edgar Allan Poe's unfinished play Politian and Robert Penn Warren's novel World Enough and Time (1950).|$|E
50|$|The town of Sprague, Washington, {{founded in}} 1880, {{was named for}} General Sprague. Lincoln County, Washington, was {{originally}} named for Sprague, until opposition from <b>political</b> <b>enemy</b> (and former Union colonel) Joseph H. Houghton, a Washington Territory legislator.|$|R
