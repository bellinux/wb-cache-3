25|$|Bottle caps, or closures, {{are used}} to seal the {{openings}} of bottles of many types. They can be small circular pieces of metal, usually steel, with plastic backings, and for plastic bottles a <b>plastic</b> <b>cap</b> is used instead. Caps can also be plastic, sometimes with a pour spout. Flip-Top caps like Flapper closures provide controlled dispensing of dry products. The crown cork, the first form of a bottle cap, possessed flanges bent over a sealed bottle to compress the liquid inside. It was invented and patented in 1892 by William Painter of Baltimore, Maryland.|$|E

2500|$|Because it {{had already}} been issued in large numbers, the {{existing}} M3 magazine design was retained, despite demonstrated deficiencies exposed during the weapon's firing trials and its early combat service. [...] In an effort to improve reliability, a hard plastic Tenite cap designated T2 was adopted in November 1944 to fit over the feed lips of loaded magazines. [...] These caps protected the feed lips while keeping out dirt, sand, and debris. [...] Sometime during the 1960s the hard T2 <b>plastic</b> <b>cap</b> was replaced in service with one of pliant neoprene rubber, which could be removed with less noise. [...] Unfortunately, during service in the humid climate of Vietnam it was discovered that the rubber cap caused rust to form on the covered portion of the magazine, while causing loaded ammunition to corrode.|$|E

40|$|When {{light comes}} {{into contact with}} milk, the milk will start to {{deteriorate}} and taste bad due to production of off-flavour compounds. Aseptic milk carton packages stored at ambient temperature usually have a layer of aluminium foil, which acts as a barrier for incoming light, water, oxygen and other gases. If the aluminium would not be present the light barrier would mainly consist of the paperboard. In order to develop a milk package without aluminium foil for ambient storage, {{it is important to}} obtain knowledge of light barrier properties of paperboard and <b>plastic</b> <b>caps.</b> When measuring the light barrier in the material two spectrophotometers were used. The spectrophotometers measured the fraction of light that was able to penetrate a sample. The investigation of paperboards for 1 litre packages showed that they had protection against light of wavelengths that induced off flavour reactions with Riboflavin (220 - 375, 410 - 475 nm). But the transmission for light within the range 650 - 700 nm was above 0. 1 %. Those wavelengths induce off flavour reactions with porphyrins and chlorins. Different layers in the paperboard contribute differently to the total light barrier of the paperboard. Exposing a paperboard to sunlight deteriorates its light barrier in the long run, while printing on paperboard improves its light barrier. The <b>plastic</b> <b>caps</b> on packages are a fraction of the total package in term of area. But the light barrier of the total package could be lacking due to the <b>plastic</b> <b>caps</b> which is why they have been investigated. Different colouring pigments give different light barrier properties in the cap...|$|R

50|$|A {{stainless}} steel cell, full of <b>plastic</b> <b>caps</b> of different dimension, slowly rotates (1-3 rpm) partially submerged inside a tank, {{where there are}} wastewaters to be purified. <b>Plastic</b> <b>caps</b> spontaneously form a bacterial film that progressively presents, at first, heterotrophic bacteria development which are able to nourish of organic carbon pollutants; then the decrease of COD and BOD concentration and then the development of autotrophic bacteria. They belong to the Nitrosomonas and Nitrobacter category and {{they are able to}} oxidize ammonium, transforming it into nitrites and nitrates.The cell containing the carriers (caps) can be flooded as needed; in this way the depuration process control is obtained and it can be oriented both to the carbon removal both to the wastewaters denitrification. These plants, like happening for the biological disks, do not need any blower for the bacteria film oxygenation. It's the slow reactor rotation - alternatively submerged into sewage and into atmosphere - to guarantee the adequate oxygen supply for the oxidation aerobically of the sewage made by the biological film attached to the carriers. In this way it is possible to obtain a huge reduction of functioning and operating treatment costs.|$|R
