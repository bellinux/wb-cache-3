25|$|The bulk {{of modern}} {{commercial}} production uses the <b>plasticulture</b> system. In this method, raised beds are formed each year, fumigated, {{and covered with}} plastic to prevent weed growth and erosion. Plants, usually obtained from northern nurseries, are planted through holes punched in this covering, and irrigation tubing is run underneath. Runners are removed from the plants as they appear, {{in order to encourage}} the plants to put most of their energy into fruit development. At the end of the harvest season, the plastic is removed and the plants are plowed into the ground. Because strawberry plants more than a year or two old begin to decline in productivity and fruit quality, this system of replacing the plants each year allows for improved yields and denser plantings. However, because it requires a longer growing season to allow for establishment of the plants each year, and because of the increased costs in terms of forming and covering the mounds and purchasing plants each year, it is not always practical in all areas.|$|E
50|$|<b>Plasticulture</b> {{is the use}} {{of plastic}} mulch in agriculture. Farmers use plastic sheets as mulch to cover 50-70% of the soil and allows them to use drip {{irrigation}} systems to have better control over soil nutrients and moisture. Rain is not required in this system, and farms that use <b>plasticulture</b> are built to encourage the fastest runoff of rain. The use of pesticides with <b>plasticulture</b> allows pesticides to be transported easier in the surface runoff towards wetlands or tidal creeks. The runoff from pesticides and chemicals in the plastic can cause serious deformations and death in shellfish as the runoff carries the chemicals towards the oceans.|$|E

5000|$|The use of <b>plasticulture</b> in {{agriculture}} is growing rapidly, perhaps nowhere more visibly than around Almería in southern Spain. The eastern approaches to Almería, {{north of the}} airport, are densely covered, as is a large area further north-east, surrounding the towns of Campohermoso, Los Pipaces and Los Grillos (close to Níjar).|$|E
50|$|The use of {{polyethylene}} for soil solarization differs {{in principle}} from its traditional agricultural use. With solarization, soil is mulched during the hottest months (rather than the coldest, as in conventional <b>plasticulture</b> which {{is aimed at}} protecting the crop) {{in order to increase}} the maximal temperatures in an attempt to achieve lethal heat levels.|$|E
5000|$|The plastic {{materials}} {{themselves are}} often and broadly {{referred to as}} [...] "ag plastics." [...] <b>Plasticulture</b> ag plastics include soil fumigation film, irrigation drip tape/tubing, nursery pots and silage bags, but the term is most often used to describe all kinds of plastic plant/soil coverings. Such coverings range from plastic mulch film, row coverings, high and low tunnels (polytunnels), to plastic greenhouses.|$|E
50|$|The {{economy of}} Almería is mostly based on agriculture, {{which is located}} mainly {{in the western part}} of the region. Numerous {{greenhouses}} mostly constructed with <b>plasticulture</b> produce tonnes of fruit and vegetables, more than 70% of their product being exported to the rest of Europe. These greenhouses are controversial, with allegations of cheap labor and harsh conditions. The plastic often ends up the sea, killing marine life.|$|E
5000|$|In <b>plasticulture,</b> strawberries, tomatoes, peppers, melons, {{and other}} fruits and {{vegetables}} are often grown under plastic to control temperature, retain moisture and control weeds.

5000|$|Strawberry cultivars {{vary widely}} in size, color, flavor, shape, degree of fertility, season of ripening, {{liability}} to disease and constitution of plant. On average, a strawberry has about 200 seeds on its external membrane. [...] Some vary in foliage, and some vary materially {{in the relative}} development of their sexual organs. In most cases, the flowers appear hermaphroditic in structure, but function as either male or female.For purposes of commercial production, plants are propagated from runners and, in general, distributed as either bare root plants or plugs.

Parliament has wisely not attempted to explain in detail what {{is or is not}} bad faith in this context; how far a dealing must so fall-short in order to amount to bad faith is a matter best left to be adjudged not by some paraphrase by the Courts (which leads to the danger of the Courts then construing not the Act but the paraphrase) but by reference to the words of the Act and upon a regard to all material surrounding circumstances." ...|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the increased runoff that results from <b>plasticulture,</b> {{there is also the}} problem of the increased amount of waste form the plastic mulch itself. The use of plastic mulch for vegetables, strawberries, and other row and orchard crops exceeds 110 million pounds annually in the United States. Most plastic ends up in the landfill, although there are other disposal options such as disking mulches into the soil, on-site burying, on-site storage, reuse, recycling, and incineration. The incineration and recycling options are complicated by the variety of the types of plastics that are used and by the geographic dispersal of the plastics. Plastics also contain stabilizers and dyes as well as heavy metals, which limits the amount of products that can be recycled. Research is continually being conducted on creating biodegradable or photodegradable mulches. While there has been minor success with this, there is also the problem of how long the plastic takes to degrade, as many biodegradable products {{take a long time to}} break down.|$|E

40|$|Windbreaks are an {{important}} and often overlooked component of a <b>plasticulture</b> system. They provide benefits regardless of where you farm or what crops you are raising. When wind protection is included in a <b>plasticulture</b> production system, crops benefit from less wind stress and an improved microclimate for growth and development. There is less crop injury due to soil abrasion or wind-whipping of plants, less extreme soil temperature fluctuations, and improved soil warming.

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} compare three cold-climate strawberry pro-duction systems. Replicated field plots of conventional matted row, advanced matted row and cold-climate <b>plasticulture</b> production systems were established in 2002 at Beltsville, MD, and managed according to commercial standard practices for the re-gion. The following components of sustainability were determined: economic viability and efficiency, environmental impacts, and public acceptance. Marketable yields for the first harvest season {{in the spring of}} 2003 were lower than normal due to above average rainfall and high disease incidence. The conventional matted row was the highest yielding at 17, 400 kg/ha, followed by the advanced matted row and plasticul-ture with 13, 200 and 11, 800 kg/ha, respectively. During the establishment year, soil loss from rain-induced surface runoff was more than 4 -fold greater in conventional matted row, and 1. 5 -fold greater in <b>plasticulture</b> compared to advanced matted row. To identify preferences of pick-your-own customers, volunteers harvested fruit from subplots in each system and completed questionnaires.

S. A [...] A series of whole plant harvests were performed on 'Sweet Charlie' and 'Camarosa' strawberry plants in a nursery and a <b>plasticulture</b> fruit field to study their pattern of dry matter partitioning. Plants were either treated with prohexadione-calcium or mowed, or treated with prohexadione-calcium and mowed in the nursery and compared to untreated plants. All treatments caused a reduction in plant height at the time bare-roots transplants were dug in the nursery. Treated plants allocated more dry matter to root and less to leaves, resulting {{in an increase in}} root to shoot ratio and this effect lasted until plants were well established after transplantation into the <b>plasticulture</b> system. By fruiting, treated plants allocated more biomass to fruits, and this difference was due to increased fruit number and not increased fruit size. Untreated plants allocated more to leaves, both in number and percentage, and to stems. Prohexadione-calcium increased root allocation, and mowing (alone or combined with prohexadione-calcium) decreased it. Plants that were prohexadione-calcium-treated and mowed had the highest harvest index and untreated plants had the lowest. 'Camarosa' developed many more leaves and proportionally less fruits than 'Sweet Charlie' during the fruiting phase...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Hoop house <b>plasticulture</b> {{has been}} {{promoted}} as a production technology that allows fruit and vegetable crops to be grown in the cool season months in early spring and late fall. At this time little information regarding the economics of hoop house <b>plasticulture</b> is available. Two fruit and vegetable production systems were developed for growing conditions in south-central Oklahoma. The first system has a spinach crop followed by field tomato, and the second system has annually produced strawberry followed by yellow and zucchini squash. Crop production data were collected in a three-year randomized and replicated experiment. The objectives were (1) to determine the expected cost of production for each crop and systems, (2) to determine the breakeven price for each crop in each system, and (3) to determine how robust breakeven prices are {{to a number of}} yield, expense and marketing scenarios. The expected total cost of production were $ 1, 968 and $ 1, 652 per house for spinach and tomato crops, respectively, and $ 2, 749, $ 359 and $ 353 per house for yellow and zucchini squash crops, respectively. Breakeven prices for spinach and tomato were $ 3. 32 and $ 0. 83 per pound, respectively, and $ 6. 16, $ 0. 92, and $ 1. 40 per pound for strawberry and yellow and zucchini squash, respectively. Breakeven prices for spinach and strawberry crops were most sensitive to assumptions about quantity of marketable yield sold and/or quantity of yield consumed by grower household. breakeven prices, economics, fruits and vegetables, hoop houses, <b>plasticulture,</b> Agribusiness, Farm Management, Labor and Human Capital, Marketing, Production Economics,...|$|E

40|$|Anticipating the phaseout of methyl bromide, the USDA–ARS {{small fruit}} {{breeding}} program at Beltsville, Md., discontinued soil fumigation in strawberry breeding and selection trials {{in the mid}} 1990 s. To address resulting weed and pathogen pests, a modified or ad- vanced matted row system was developed. This system uses matted row-type culture, established on raised beds with subsurface drip irrigation and organic mulch. The mulch is the residue of a killed cover crop that fixes some nitrogen and provides an economical, biodegrad- able mulch for suppressing weeds and reducing erosion. Since 1996, the small fruit breeding program has conducted replicated performance trials on both advanced matted row and a regional adaptation of annual hill <b>plasticulture.</b> Both of these systems were managed without methyl bromide fumigation or fungicide application.

40|$|Most {{growers in}} Arkansas now produce {{strawberries}} using the <b>plasticulture</b> production system. Consequently, this {{system will be}} {{referred to in the}} remainder of this profile. Strawberry <b>plasticulture</b> is the annual hill training system in which ‘green ’ strawberry transplants (freshly dug or plug plants) are planted in early fall in double rows at densities of approximately 15, 000 to 17, 400 plants per acre on methyl bromide fumigated, raised beds that are covered with black plastic mulch. Methyl bromide (67 %) + chloropicrin (33 %) is currently applied prior to planting (minimum of two weeks between application and planting) transplants for management of soil borne diseases, nematodes, insects, and weeds. A single application of approximately 200 lb. of product per acre is injected into the soil during construction of the raised beds. Row middles are not treated. The bed is then immediately covered with black plastic mulch. Transplants are set in late September to mid October. In the strawberry <b>plasticulture</b> system berries can be harvested in just 7 to 8 months after planting. Drip and overhead sprinkler irrigation are used to reduce stress on plants during establishment, irrigate plants, and protect plants from frost. Following a period of vegetative growth in the fall, cool temperatures and short day length stimulate the plant to produce flowers that begin to bloom in March. The harvest period is mid April through May. Fruit are harvested by hand every 2 - 3 days during the harvest season. Due to the frequency of harvest, preharvest intervals (PHI) and restricted entry intervals (REI) are important considerations for growers. Following harvest (early to mid June), the strawberry plants are destroyed due to the high risk of infection with anthracnose fruit rot in second year beds...|$|E

40|$|Methyl bromide-dependent <b>plasticulture</b> {{production}} of strawberries {{is an important}} component of income for small to midsize farms in North Carolina. This system consists of plastic mulch, drip fertigation, and soil pest-management treatment. This system is like a three-legged stool and the phase out of a major soil pest-management treatment, namely methyl bromide (MB), threatens the current profitability of strawberry enterprises. MB {{is an integral part of}} the small-scale farmer’s <b>plasticulture</b> tool box for growing profitable crops of strawberries (Poling and Monks, 1994). The expected economic impact is difficult to measure because there is no simple exchange of an alternative compound for methyl bromide. Changes in cultural systems or using alternative fumigants will require changes in management practices and scheduling of activities. Likewise, adopting alternative practices may impact pest populations and result in a shift of predominant or important pathogens, insects, or weeds. In 1997 we initiated four field trials in different regions of NC (Coastal, Piedmont, Mountains) to explore alternative products or alternative farming systems to minimize risk of decreased profits with the pending loss of methyl bromide as a soil fumigant (Louws et al., 1998 a, 1998 b).

40|$|Winter {{squash and}} pumpkin growers in the Northeast are seeking {{production}} {{systems that are}} more costeffective than those they are currently using. An intensive <b>plasticulture</b> system that utilizes transplants and high plant populations, plastic mulch and drip irrigation, scouting, and as-needed fertilizer and pesticide applications is consistent with this objective because it results in greatly increased yields of marketable fruit. This system increases certain inputs – plant numbers and agricultural plastics, most notably – {{in order to increase}} marketable yields per acre. At the same time, other inputs – including herbicides, insecticides, fungicides and fertilizers – may be reduced. Three field trials were undertaken in 2003 to evaluate various aspects of the <b>plasticulture</b> system: pumpkin fertigation treatments were evaluated at Al Lansing’s farm in Albany County, and winter squash fertigation and pumpkin and winter squash disease management treatments were evaluated at Cornell’s Valatie farm in Columbia County. At the Lansing farm we evaluated the impact of four nitrogen fertigation rates – 50, 65, 80, and 95 lb N/acre - on pumpkin yields. The number of pumpkins increased with increasing fertilizer rates. At the Valatie farm we evaluated how four rates of nitrogen fertilizer – 30, 45, 60 and 75 lb N/acre - affected the yields of acorn and butternut squashes. The squashes exhibited yield responses only at the highest N rate. Average fruit size was not impacted by these treatments. New, powdery mildew tolerant varieties of squash out-yielded standard varieties even when the newer varieties were given the lowest rates of N and the standards were given the highest N rates. These studies suggest that high yields of acorn and butternut squashes grown using <b>plasticulture</b> techniques may be obtained by selecting good varieties, using high plant populations, and by choosing modest fertilizer rates. In another trial at the Valatie farm we intended to find out how three disease management strategies affected disease incidence, fruit yield, and fruit quality in pumpkins and acorn and butternut squashes. Heavy rains just prior to harvest followed by a rapid Phytophthora infestation destroyed the entire trial making data collection impossible. We expect to repeat this work in 2004...|$|E

The effect these nursery practices had on fruit production in annual hill <b>plasticulture</b> was also determined. In one experiment Camarosa plants were sprayed with ProCa at an active ingredient concentration of 62. 5 mg L- 1 on Aug. 22, Sep. 05, or Sep. 19, 2001 and 2002, corresponding, respectively, to growing degree days (10 degrees C base) of 800, 894 and 965 in 2001 and 726, 821 and 908 in 2002. Application on Aug. 22 increased production of daughter plants, especially those of marketable size, by increasing the number of daughters per meter of runner and allocating more dry matter to marketable daughters. In a second experiment, field plots were mowed and/or treated with ProCa at an active ingredient concentration of 62. 5 mg L- 1 on Sep. 05 or Sep. 19, 2001 and 2002.
