5|$|The Rocky Horror Picture Show {{remains a}} {{cultural}} phenomenon {{in both the}} U.S. and U.K. Cult film <b>participants</b> <b>are</b> often people {{on the fringe of}} society that find connection and community at the screenings although the film attracts fans of differing backgrounds all over the world.|$|E
5|$|The {{participants}} in the programme are four trans women and three trans men {{from different parts of}} the British Isles. They range in age from 22 to 52; five of the <b>participants</b> <b>are</b> under 30.|$|E
5|$|Today, LARP is a {{widespread}} activity internationally. Games with thousands of <b>participants</b> <b>are</b> run by for-profit companies, and a small industry exists to sell costume, armour and foam weapons intended primarily for LARP.|$|E
30|$|The mean <b>participant</b> age <b>was</b> {{approximately}} 66.9 (SD[*]=[*] 7.74) years. Demographic {{information was}} also collected {{to know that}} all the <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> unrelated Caucasian men. Due to the characteristics of this pathology, all of the <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> men.|$|R
30|$|All <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> {{provided}} with BB and Cisco ASDM monitoring tools. Two <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> randomly selected (here identified as Participant 2 and <b>Participant</b> 4) and <b>were</b> furnished with EtherApe, which represented the “enhanced visualization” condition.|$|R
50|$|During a whispered speech test, the <b>{{participant}}</b> <b>is</b> {{asked to}} cover the opening of one ear with a finger. The tester will then step back 1 to 2 feet behind the participant and say a series of words in a soft whisper. The <b>participant</b> <b>is</b> then asked to repeat what is heard. If the <b>participant</b> <b>is</b> unable to distinguish the word, the tester will speak progressively louder until the <b>participant</b> <b>is</b> able {{to understand what is}} being said. The other ear is then tested.|$|R

5|$|Additionally, NATO cooperates and {{discusses}} its activities with numerous other non-NATO members. The Mediterranean Dialogue {{was established in}} 1994 to coordinate {{in a similar way}} with Israel and countries in North Africa. The Istanbul Cooperation Initiative was announced in 2004 as a dialog forum for the Middle East along the same lines as the Mediterranean Dialogue. The four <b>participants</b> <b>are</b> also linked through the Gulf Cooperation Council.|$|E
5|$|After {{completion}} of the Wood Badge course, <b>participants</b> <b>are</b> awarded the insignia in a Wood Badge bead ceremony. They receive automatic membership in 1st Gilwell Park Scout Group or Gilwell Troop 1. These leaders are henceforth called Gilwellians or Wood Badgers. It is estimated that worldwide over 100,000 Scouters have completed their Wood Badge training. The 1st Gilwell Scout Group meets annually during the first weekend in September at Gilwell Park for the Gilwell Reunion. Gilwell Reunions are also held in other places, often on that same weekend.|$|E
30|$|This {{categorization}} {{was supported}} by the way the research <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> assigned to treatment and control groups, as defined by Shadish et al. (2002). During the coding process, two main categories emerged: (a) randomized, where the <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> randomly selected and assigned to the treatment or control group, and (b) quasi-experimental, where the <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> assigned by the researchers.|$|R
50|$|In {{the summer}} of 2010, three program <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> {{selected}} for the inaugural One Week Job Program. Spots for the program were awarded based on public votes during an online competition. The first three <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> from Toronto, Texas and Tennessee. Each <b>participant</b> <b>was</b> awarded a scholarship of $3,000 (CDN) and given eight weeks to try eight different jobs.|$|R
30|$|<b>Participants</b> <b>were</b> 42 Temple University {{undergraduates}} (31 females) fulfilling {{a requirement}} for an introductory psychology course. Two <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> excluded from the analysis for not following instructions.|$|R
5|$|As a {{condition}} of receiving the grant, the P.R. Department of the Family must submit an annual plan of operation to the FNS, which describes how it will distribute the funds assigned as nutrition assistance to qualifying persons. This includes identifying the island population which is eligible for the NAP benefits (i.e., family income limits, family status limits, etc.), establishing the process in which individual <b>participants</b> <b>are</b> selected, {{and the process of}} determining the benefit amount for each participant. The plan of operation is reviewed and approved by the FNS before funds are disbursed.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 17th century the Cherokee and Creek {{had begun to}} compete for the same {{resources}} and fought a battle at nearby Slaughter Gap. The Creek lost, ceding the Blood Mountain area to the Cherokee, who considered it a holy place. Archaeological evidence has been discovered that tends to back the story of the battle, but the date of the battle and its <b>participants</b> <b>are</b> still disputed.|$|E
5|$|Each NFL {{franchise}} {{seeks to}} add new players through the annual NFL Draft. The draft rules were last updated in 2009. The {{team with the}} worst record the previous year picks first, the next-worst team second, and so on. Teams that {{did not make the}} playoffs are ordered by their regular-season record with any remaining ties broken by strength of schedule. Playoff <b>participants</b> <b>are</b> sequenced after non-playoff teams, based on their round of elimination (wild card, division, conference, and Super Bowl).|$|E
25|$|<b>Participants</b> <b>were</b> then {{divided into}} 2 groups to {{evaluate}} the computer’s performance and <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> asked to describe this performance from the choice of about 20 adjectives. Half of the <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> assigned to evaluate on computer #1, the computer that praised its own work. The other half were sent to another computer {{across the room to}} evaluate computer#1’s performance.|$|R
30|$|<b>Participants</b> <b>were</b> 160 South Korean {{respondents}} recruited {{through an}} online survey company in South Korea (48.1 % male, Mage =  22.94  ±  2.06  years; age range 20 – 29  years). The experiment was conducted using a mobile platform {{provided by the}} online survey company. Three <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> excluded due to incompleteness in their data; thus, the responses of 157 <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> analyzed.|$|R

5|$|In {{the second}} chapter, the book {{describes}} {{the process as}} new drugs move from animal testing through phase 1 (first-in-man study), phase 2, and phase 3 clinical trials. Phase 1 <b>participants</b> <b>are</b> referred to as volunteers, but in the US are paid $200–$400 per day, and because studies can last several weeks and subjects may volunteer several times a year, earning potential becomes {{the main reason for}} participation. <b>Participants</b> <b>are</b> usually taken from the poorest groups in society, and outsourcing increasingly means that trials may be conducted in countries with highly competitive wages by contract research organizations (CROs). The rate of growth for clinical trials in India is 20 percent a year, in Argentina 27 percent, and in China 47 percent, while trials in the UK have fallen by 10 percent a year and in the US by six percent.|$|E
5|$|In this test, {{a number}} of cards are {{presented}} to the participants. The figures on the cards differ with respect to color, quantity, and shape. The <b>participants</b> <b>are</b> then given a pile of additional cards and are asked to match each one {{to one of the}} previous cards. Typically, children between ages nine and eleven demonstrate the cognitive flexibility needed for this test.|$|E
30|$|For {{each test}} {{sentence}} in the survey paper, <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> asked to complete three tasks about the {{sentence in the}} following order: (1) acceptability judgement, (2) grammaticality judgement, and (3) subject selection. In the acceptability judgement task, <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> required to rate the acceptability of a test sentence on a 7 -point Likert scale. In the grammaticality judgement task, <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> required to decide whether a test sentence was grammatical or not. In the subject selection task, <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> required to choose the subject out of the two NPs in a test sentence; a third choice ‘cannot decide’ was also allowed. To ensure that the <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> {{paying attention to the}} subject selection task, for half of the tasks, the presented order of the two NPs in the question was the reverse of their positions in the test sentences. Before completing the survey, <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> instructed that there were no standard answers to the tasks and that they should base their answers on their first impressions.|$|R
30|$|<b>Participants</b> <b>were</b> {{recruited}} through word of mouth, radio advertisements, local e-mail subscription services, social media, and flyers. All potential <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> {{screened for}} exclusion criteria via telephone scripts and face-to-face interviews.|$|R
5000|$|All these of the {{categories}} are indicated for only the primary animate <b>participant.</b> If there <b>is</b> also a second participant (such as in transitive sentences), {{the number of the}} second <b>participant</b> <b>is</b> also indicated.

5|$|One of {{the major}} points that Asch makes is that <b>participants</b> <b>are</b> not {{completely}} blind in the experiment and making arbitrary choices based on this bias. Asch claims that participants were acting reasonable in their change of evaluation of the judgment because {{the context of the}} judgment and thus the meaning of the judgment had changed. Lorge, however, suggested that if the participants were behaving logical, their evaluations should have remained the same despite the change in author.|$|E
5|$|Sociological {{investigation}} {{indicates that}} certain {{sectors of society}} {{are more likely to}} engage in New Age practices than others. The majority of <b>participants</b> <b>are</b> from the middle and upper-middle classes of Western society. Sutcliffe noted that although most influential New Age figureheads were male, approximately two-thirds of its participants were female.|$|E
5|$|The {{complete}} {{scene of}} the wedding is not always depicted. Sometimes, only the principal <b>participants</b> <b>are</b> shown. Chola bronzes featuring only Shiva and Parvati {{as described in the}} wedding scene are found. South Indian sculptures, like those from Madurai, feature only the couple and Vishnu. In this configuration, Parvati is depicted in the centre with Vishnu on the left giving away her hand to Shiva on the right. Sometimes as in the Elephanta Caves, Parvati's biological father Himavan, instead of Vishnu, is depicted giving away his daughter to Shiva.|$|E
30|$|We {{tried to}} ensure that <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> paying {{attention}} in two ways. First, a button with the label “Press me now” would periodically appear onscreen as the videos played; <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> instructed to click this button as quickly as possible. Second, immediately following each video, <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> asked three basic questions about the candidate’s responses (e.g., “Where did the candidate say they attended college?”).|$|R
30|$|<b>Participants</b> <b>were</b> 280 {{undergraduate}} {{students from a}} UK University, of whom 126 were male and 154 were female. The mean age of <b>participants</b> <b>was</b> 18.95  years (SD = 1.11  years, range = 18 – 26  years). <b>Participants</b> <b>were</b> typically from a Caucasian background (63 %), with other predominant ethnic backgrounds being Black (13 %) and Indian (10 %). Ethical approval {{was obtained from the}} University's Ethics Committee.|$|R
30|$|The {{instructions}} {{given to}} the <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> similar to those for the lexical decision task. The <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> to judge whether the phrase was ambiguous and to press “Q” on the keyboard with the left hand if so or “P” {{with his right hand}} if not. In front of these letters were marks indicating what the keys meant. <b>Participants</b> <b>were</b> instructed to react as quickly as possible.|$|R
5|$|The <b>participants</b> <b>are</b> ranked {{based on}} their {{individual}} scores. Medals are awarded to the highest ranked participants; slightly {{fewer than half of}} them receive a medal. The cutoffs (minimum scores required to receive a gold, silver or bronze medal respectively) are then chosen so that the numbers of gold, silver and bronze medals awarded are approximately in the ratios 1:2:3. Participants who do not win a medal but who score seven points on at least one problem receive an honorable mention.|$|E
5|$|Experimental research: The {{researcher}} isolates {{a single}} social process and reproduces it {{in a laboratory}} (for example, by creating a situation where unconscious sexist judgements are possible), seeking {{to determine whether or}} not certain social variables can cause, or depend upon, other variables (for instance, seeing if people's feelings about traditional gender roles can be manipulated by the activation of contrasting gender stereotypes). <b>Participants</b> <b>are</b> randomly assigned to different groups that either serve as controls—acting as reference points because they are tested with regard to the dependent variable, albeit without having been exposed to any independent variables of interest—or receive one or more treatments. Randomization allows the researcher to be sure that any resulting differences between groups are the result of the treatment.|$|E
5|$|Following {{years of}} {{disruption}} and conflict, stability was {{restored to the}} opera house and its two companies after the appointment in May 2001 of a new chief executive, Tony Hall, formerly a senior executive at the BBC. The following year Antonio Pappano succeeded Haitink as music director of The Royal Opera. Following the redevelopment, a second, smaller auditorium, the Linbury Studio Theatre has been made available for small-scale productions by The Royal Opera and The Royal Ballet, for visiting companies, and for work produced in the ROH2 programme, which supports new work and developing artists. The Royal Opera encourages young singers {{at the start of}} their careers with the Jette Parker Young Artists Programme; <b>participants</b> <b>are</b> salaried members of the company and receive daily coaching in all aspects of opera.|$|E
30|$|The <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> 51 men and 59 women. The {{average age}} of the <b>participants</b> <b>was</b> 20, ranging from 18 to 22  years of age. Both male and female <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> {{undergraduate}} students in business who were enrolled in the same course, in the same university team, and who came from the same geographical area of the south-west Atlantic coast in France. All were Caucasian.|$|R
50|$|The <b>participant</b> <b>is</b> {{asked to}} read a series of related word-reading and color-naming trials. In the first {{component}} of the task, known as the word-reading condition of the task, the <b>participant</b> <b>is</b> {{asked to read}} {{as quickly as possible}} a series of color names printed either in white or other various colors. The <b>participant</b> <b>is</b> then asked to name the color of a series of colored blocks.|$|R
5000|$|In [...] "The Disposable Spill-Proof Coffee Cup Problem", {{adapted from}} Janson & Smith, 1991, <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> asked to {{construct}} as many designs {{as possible for}} an inexpensive, disposable, spill-proof coffee cup. Standard condition <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> presented only with instructions. In the fixated condition, <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> presented with instructions, a design, and problems they should be aware of. Finally, in the defixated condition, <b>participants</b> <b>were</b> presented the same as other conditions in addition to suggestions of design elements they should avoid using. The other two problems included building a bike rack, and designing a container for cream cheese.|$|R
