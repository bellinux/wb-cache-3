The helicopters are used for aerial firefighting (water bombing) and may be fitted with tanks or carry helibuckets. Helibuckets, such as the Bambi bucket, are usually filled by submerging the bucket into lakes, rivers, reservoirs, or <b>portable</b> <b>tanks.</b> Tanks fitted onto helicopters are filled from a hose while the helicopter is on the ground or water is siphoned from lakes or reservoirs through a hanging snorkel as the helicopter hovers over the water source. Helitack helicopters are also used to deliver firefighters, who rappel down to inaccessible areas, and to resupply firefighters. Common firefighting helicopters include variants of the Bell 205 and the Erickson S-64 Aircrane helitanker.|$|R

50|$|Helicopters may {{be fitted}} with tanks (helitankers) {{or they may}} carry buckets. Some helitankers, such as the Erickson AirCrane, are also {{outfitted}} with a front-mounted foam cannon. Buckets are usually filled by submerging or dipping them in lakes, rivers, reservoirs, or portable tanks. The most popular of the buckets is the flexible Bambi Bucket. Tanks can be filled on the ground (by water tenders or truck-mounted systems) or water can be siphoned from lakes, rivers, reservoirs, or a <b>portable</b> <b>tank</b> through a hanging snorkel. Popular firefighting helicopters include variants of the Bell 204, Bell 205, Bell 212, Boeing Vertol 107, Boeing Vertol 234 and the Erickson S-64 Aircrane helitanker, which features a snorkel for filling from a natural or man-made water source while in hover. Currently the world's largest helicopter, the Mil Mi-26, uses a Bambi bucket.|$|E
5000|$|The flowing {{movement}} of finely powdered substances or low conductivity fluids in pipes or through mechanical agitation can build up static electricity.The flow of granules of material like sand down a plastic chute can transfer charge, {{which can be}} easily measured using a multimeter connected to metal foil lining the chute at intervals, and can be roughly proportional to particulate flow. [...] Dust clouds of finely powdered substances can become combustible or explosive. When there is a static discharge in a dust or vapor cloud, explosions have occurred. Among the major industrial incidents that have occurred are: a grain silo in southwest France, a paint plant in Thailand, a factory making fiberglass moldings in Canada, a storage tank explosion inGlenpool, Oklahoma in 2003, and a <b>portable</b> <b>tank</b> filling operation and a tank farm in Des Moines, Iowa and Valley Center, Kansas in 2007.|$|E

5000|$|There {{are several}} {{variations}} {{of this one}} but the premise is the same in all. The Crew (4-6 team members) simulates receiving an alarm, responding to and handling the alarm. The firefighters start out in street clothes and dress in full turnout gear (Helmet, Coat, and boots) board their fire engine and respond approximately 200 feet up the course to a portable water tank, the engine crew simultaneously stretches 100-150 feet of 2 1/2 inch hose toward a target area as other crew members place hard suction hose to the intake on the engine and another member connects the 2 1/2" [...] line to the discharge. The pump operator must then draft water from the <b>portable</b> <b>tank</b> and discharge it through the 2 1/2 inch hose to knock down a target (usually a beer keg or traffic cone with a ball on top) This contest checks crew integrity, skill of the equipment operator, skill of the nozzle crew, and operation of the equipment. When done by a well versed team {{it can be done}} in under a minute as was accomplished many times in the late 1980s and early 1990s at Greenfield Village SPAAMFAA musters in Michigan.Some variations include stadium response where apparatus does not drive, another variation is the crew is lying on cots on an elevated platform and must slide down a pole. One variation exempts the equipment operator from wearing gear however it must be on the truck.|$|E
50|$|He {{was born}} in Truro, Nova Scotia, the son of David McCurdy and Mary Archibald. He moved to Baddeck with his family {{at the age of}} nine and was educated there and at Whitby, Ontario. He {{returned}} to Baddeck, where he entered business with his father and brother William. In 1881, he married Lucy O'Brien. The following year, he bought his father's share in the business. The business failed in 1887 and McCurdy became private secretary to Alexander Graham Bell, who he had met in Baddeck. In 1889, he became an assistant in Bell's lab in Washington, D.C.. In 1899, he developed a <b>portable</b> <b>tank</b> for developing film, later selling the patent to Eastman Kodak. He married Hattie Maria Mace in 1902 {{after the death of his}} first wife. After leaving Bell's employ to pursue his own inventions, McCurdy moved to Toronto in 1903. A few years later, he moved to Victoria, British Columbia. He was president of the British Columbia Natural History Society and contributed an article about Victoria to the National Geographic Magazine. McCurdy helped establish the Victoria centre of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada and served as its vice-president; McCurdy lobbied for the establishment of the Dominion Dominion Astrophysical Observatory on Vancouver Island, for a brief time the site of the largest telescope in the world. In 1916, he ran for the Esquimalt seat in the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia; although he was at first declared elected, Robert Henry Pooley was declared elected after a recount.

40|$|A {{borehole}} permeameter is {{well suited}} for testing saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat) at specific depths in the vadose zone. Most applications of the method involve fine-grained soils that allow hand auguring of test holes and require a small water reservoir to maintain a constant head. In non-cohesive gravels, hand-dug test holes are difficult to excavate, holes are prone to collapse, and large volumes of water are necessary to maintain a constant head {{for the duration of}} the test. For coarse alluvial gravels, a direct-push steel permeameter was designed to place a slotted pipe at a specific sampling depth. Measurements can be made at successive depths at the same location. A 3790 L (1000 gallons) trailer-mounted water tank maintained a constant head in the permeameter. Head in the <b>portable</b> <b>tank</b> was measured with a pressure transducer and flow was calculated based on a volumetric rating curve. A U. S.

40|$|The National Aeronautics and Space Administration {{plans to}} begin {{construction}} of a lunar base soon {{after the turn of}} the century. During the Apollo missions, lunar dust proved to be a problem because the dust adhered to all exposed material surfaces. Since lunar dust will be a problem during the establishment and operation of this base, the need exists for a device to remove the dust from space suits before the astronauts enter clean environments. The physical properties of lunar dust were characterized and energy methods for removing the dust were identified. Eight alternate designs were developed to remove the dust. The final design uses a brush and gas jet to remove the dust. The brush bristles are made from Kevlar fibers and the gas jet uses pressurized carbon dioxide from a <b>portable</b> <b>tank.</b> A throttling valve allows variable gas flow. Also, the tank is insulated with Kapton and electrically heated to prevent condensation of the carbon dioxide when the tank is exposed to the cold (- 240 F) lunar night...|$|E
