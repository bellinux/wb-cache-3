25|$|Arthur Leigh Allen, of Vallejo, owned {{a mobile}} home at Sunset Trailer Park in Santa Rosa {{at the time of}} the murders. He had been fired from his Valley Springs Elementary School {{teaching}} position for suspected child molestation in 1968 and was a full-time student at Sonoma State College. Allen was arrested on September 27, 1974, by the Sonoma County Sheriff's Office and charged with child molestation in an unrelated case involving a young boy. He pleaded guilty on March 14, 1975, and was imprisoned at Atascadero State Hospital until late 1977. Robert Graysmith, in his book Zodiac Unmasked, claims that a Santa Rosa County sheriff revealed that chipmunk hairs were found on all of the Santa Rosa Hitchhiker victims and that Allen had been collecting and studying the same species. Allen was the main suspect in the Zodiac case from 1971 until October 2002, ten years after his death, when his DNA was compared to a partial DNA profile obtained from saliva recovered on the underside of a postage stamp and envelopes from verified Zodiac letters. Results were a conclusive non-match. Fingerprints in blood recovered from the taxicab of Zodiac murder victim Paul Stine, a writer's <b>palm</b> <b>print</b> found on the Zodiac letter of January 29, 1974, and handwriting exemplars further ruled out Allen as Zodiac.|$|E
500|$|Chandler's {{daughter}} Valerie Troxell said in {{an interview}} after the execution that: [...] "I believe they did execute an innocent man. I don't think one person could have pulled off such a heinous crime. It would have to have been more than one person...The forensic evidence was not there. The <b>palm</b> <b>print</b> would prove he did meet them and gave them directions, but it didn't mean he killed them. I think the prosecution had a very weak case." [...] Troxell also said that she had sent a letter to Florida Governor Rick Scott asking him to commute Chandler's sentence to life in prison.|$|E
500|$|The case {{remained}} unsolved {{for over}} three years, {{partly due to the}} volume of tips received by police investigators. The biggest tip was from a Madeira Beach police bulletin describing a similar rape of a 24-year-old Canadian tourist some two weeks before the murders (See below under [...] "Witnesses"). Chandler was arrested for the murders on September 24, 1992. His handwritten directions on a brochure found in the Rogers' vehicle, and a description of his boat written by Jo Rogers on the brochure, were the primary clues that led to him being named a suspect. Local police posted images of Chandler's handwriting on the brochure on billboards in the Tampa Bay area, leading to a call from a former neighbor who provided a copy of a work order that he had written. This was the first such use of billboards by law enforcement in the U.S. and billboards became useful tools in later searches for missing people. Through handwriting analysis, the two samples were [...] matched conclusively. Another of Chandler's neighbors, and one of the secretaries on the investigative task force, thought that Chandler resembled the composite sketch of the suspect in the seemingly related rape case. A <b>palm</b> <b>print</b> from the brochure was also matched to Chandler. He had sold his boat and left town with his family soon after the billboards appeared. In 1990, when the television show Unsolved Mysteries was about to report on the deaths of the Rogers family, Chandler and his then-wife moved from their home on Dalton Avenue in Tampa to Port Orange near Daytona Beach.|$|E

30|$|In {{forensic}} {{investigations and}} medico-legal practices, {{the determination of}} a person’s identity is the first {{and one of the}} most important tasks. Forensic analyses are usually performed by examining different parts of the body, like face, teeth, skull, and fingerprints. Routinely, fingerprints and <b>palm</b> <b>prints</b> are used by forensic officials for identification (Uthman et al., 2012). The reason is that a substantial amount of research has been conducted targeting the fingerprints and <b>palm</b> <b>prints</b> for human identification. Like fingerprints and <b>palm</b> <b>prints,</b> footprints are also widely recovered as pieces of evidence from the crime scenes. It is evident from the reported cases that culprits mostly remove their footwear to reduce the noise of walking, hence leaving their foot impressions at the crime scene (Khan and Moorthy, 2013). Thus, the footprint analysis can provide a great help in the forensic investigations to identify the sex.|$|R

Although Dredd and DeMarco's discovery of his actions has forced Narcos to begin his coup early, it is nevertheless successful, since most of the judges have already been issued with the sabotaged Lawgivers. Legitimate Lawgivers have a safety feature which consists of a sensor in the grip which can detect the <b>palm</b> <b>print</b> of the user, and an explosive charge, so that if an unauthorised user attempts to fire one, it will explode in his hand. On the transmission of a radio signal by Narcos, however, all of the sabotaged Lawgivers are programmed to explode if fired by a judge, resulting in hundreds of judges across the city being killed or crippled before they realise what has happened. At the same time, Narcos dispatches thousands of [...] "Assassinator"-class robots from hiding-places citywide to attack the judges everywhere simultaneously. Surprised and hampered by the sabotage of their weapons, the Judges are soon in disarray.|$|E
