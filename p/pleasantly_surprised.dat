40|$|Campaigns for the {{maintenance}} of national, regional and local identities and for the retrieval of our tangible and intangible cultural heritage represent commendable initiatives after the long, dark night imposed by the omnipotent ideology of proletarian internationalism, which promoted the dissolution and destruction of these values. The guild of the architects in Romania has distinguished itself among the professional categories that have waged the above-mentioned campaigns. Acting individually, in groups, in associations or in NGOs, Romanian architects have vigorously advocated the recovery, preservation and development of our architectural heritage, all the more so as their forerunners succeeded in imposing a “national style in architecture. ” An enumeration of these names, associations or NGOs would be superfluous and unfair on account of its inevitable omissions.

Another source of comedy is Hägar's simplistic, childlike cluelessness, often finding himself at odds with his more sensible family members. Much to Hägar's chagrin, on the few occasions where he behaves maturely (such as helping Helga in daily tasks or displaying self-control of his titanic appetite), the other characters are often caught off guard, since they are more accustomed to his bumbling and childish attitude. The most notable example was when Helga demanded that Hägar speak the truth at least one time, Hägar agrees and does so, something that <b>pleasantly</b> <b>surprises</b> even God himself, who promptly makes angels playing the trumpets in celebration of this [...] "miracle".|$|R

The character of Gordon Cole, first played by Lynch in this episode as a voice in a telephone call, was conceived as being hard of hearing; this was because Lynch liked the idea of delivering his lines in a loud voice, and worked backwards to establish a reason for this. Engels wrote most of Cole's dialogue over the series, having had experience with his own mother being similarly hard of hearing.|$|E

Tarkovsky had met her when they were students at the State Institute of Cinematography. It was she who had introduced the novel, Solaris to him. Tarkovsky auditioned her in 1970 but decided she was too young for the part. He instead recommended her to director Larisa Shepitko who cast her in You and I.

5000|$|Inaugurated in 1883, Peleș Castle is {{not only}} a {{pleasant}} place during summer time; it has been conceived to be also a national monument, meant to keep the trophies of the Plevna victory, which explains the simple but majestic style. The castle's courtyard - Bramantes type - with a fountain in the middle, in the most accurate Renaissance style, <b>pleasantly</b> <b>surprises</b> the visitor. The courtyard has a merry decoration, made out of plants and flowers; all round, the building's facades are animated by elegant drawings. The interior of the castle is a true wonder, due to the beauty and richness of the sculpted wood and the stained glass windows. As you get in the vestibule, you are on the Honor Staircase, in front of the most important rulers of old Romania: Holy Stephen the Great, and Michael the Brave. In a proud attitude, wearing whether a fur cap or with the gold crown on their heads, they impress through the brilliant dressing, in which the white of ermine blends with the emerald green or the red of the large mantle. On the right and on left side of the two rulers, as servant knights, four shield bearers carry the Romanian Provinces escutcheons. Inside the Queen's library, over the groups of children symbolizing poetry and science, there is the image of Ulfilas (311-383 AD) a Goth religious ruler, from the northern side of Danube River, translating the Bible in their language and bringing his contribution in spreading Christianity, a Christian apostle of the Romans, and the image of Dante Alighieri, the creator of western poetry. Passing the library and getting into the dormitory, we will meet the image of Genies and Allegories of Painting and Music, as well as a series of legendary themes. Inside the apartments reserved for the honor guests, a number of coat-of-arms were shining through their heraldic abundance, speaking about the ancestors of the Royal Family. But among all, the glass paintings from the Peleș Castle are, beyond any doubt, the most profound and shining. Here, the subjects are taken out of Alecsandri's poetry.|$|R

40|$|Children 2 ̆ 7 s {{literature}} can {{be defined}} as a 2 ̆ 2 specific picture books, which are a type of tradebook that contain thirty pages with pictures on every page. Both text and illustrations in a picture book work together to create meaning 2 ̆ 2 (Giorgis 2 ̆ 6 Hartman. 2000, 34). This topic piqued my interest because I am a visual learner and look to the pictures or graphic displays in the text to help explain the text. I find it difficult to read long stretches of text without accompanying graphics or illustrations. But, since {{it was the end of}} the school year the idea came and went without any action on my part. At the end of the summer I went to the National Science Museum in Minneapolis, Minnesota where I stumbled on some children 2 ̆ 7 s literature about DNA. The illustrations were magnificent and the reading made the vocabulary easier to understand. One of the employees at the museum mentioned that some of the children 2 ̆ 7 s literature was used in high school as tradebooks. I proceeded to search the Internet for these books and ones similar, and found many to do with my subject area. I ordered some books on topics that are saturated with misconceptions and difficult concepts to use in my classroom. Just because some teachers in Minnesota use children 2 ̆ 7 s literature does not mean that these types of tradebooks are necessarily successful. This led me to the library to search a topic that might have no merits or support at all. I was <b>pleasantly</b> <b>surprise</b> by the information I unturned. 2 ̆ 2 Picture books can be appropriate for students of all ages 2 ̆ 2 (Giorgis 2 ̆ 6 Hartman, 2000. 35). 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 Picture books not only entertain and amuse students, but can also assist them in learning and retaining skills related to content and concepts in all curricular areas. Picture books also support older students in their ongoing literacy development 2 ̆ 2 (Giorgis 2 ̆ 6 Hartman, 2000, 35). 2 ̆ 2 Tradebooks are generally more interesting and less confusing for children than texts. Children 2 ̆ 7 s books have story lines that help children understand and remember concepts better than textbooks that tend to present science as lists of facts to be memorized 2 ̆ 2 (Rice, 2002. 557). 2 ̆ 2 Reading picture books in secondary courses increases motivation, understanding of concepts, and aesthetic appreciation, and provides easier material for less able readers 2 ̆ 2 (Car, 2001, 146). Armed with literary support I have decided to research the question: How does the use of children 2 ̆ 7 s literature support student construction of basic biological concepts...|$|R
