5|$|Based on observations, Iridomyrmex {{workers can}} be {{deformed}} {{when they are}} born. For example, a captured specimen had its <b>propodeum</b> and gaster fused together, and the petiole was still present but enlarged. Despite the deformity, the worker {{was still able to}} forage with little trouble.|$|E
5|$|The {{relative}} position of eyes is highly variable within the species. For example, eye location ranges from being completely within the antennal scrobes to completely outside the scrobes. In {{some cases the}} eye itself is located outside the antennal scrobe, but the eye's fossa is well marked and confluent with the antennal scrobe. In most specimens, the antennal carina (ridge extending along the dorsal antennal region) bifurcates from the antennal scrobes and lies straight above the eyes. However, in specimens from Nicaragua, a strongly impressed antennal carina is present. In these specimens about 40% of the eye's area lies within the antennal scrobes. In the gyne, only ~1/6 of the eye lies within the antennal scrobes. A depression sometimes forms in the integument in {{the sides of the}} <b>propodeum,</b> below the propodeal spiracle and above the metapleural gland. The depth of this depression varies among specimens and tends to be deepest in larger specimens.|$|E
5|$|The mesosoma is half {{as broad}} than the head when viewed dorsally. The {{junction}} of the mesoscutellum (middle {{part of the}} scutellum) and the propdeums dorsal surface are indistinct; on two Z. ferox specimens, these body parts are slightly angled. The propodeal dorsums posterior margin is concave. The propleuron (the lateral exoskeletal plate of the prothorax) is well developed and the mesopleuron (the lateral exoskeleton plate of the mesothorax) is separated {{from the rest of}} the mesosoma by distinct sulci (deep grooves of the head). The <b>propodeum</b> is high and the propodeal spiracles (external openings) are slit-like and located around the mid-regions of the propodeal sides. The opening of the metapleural gland is semicircular and the metapleural bulla (the reservoirs) is developed. On the legs, the femora and tibiae are flattened and tibiae with anterior and posterior margins are bordered by a carina. The trochantellus (proximal end of the femur) is found on all legs, and the forelegs have patches of dense and elongated setae. The protibia has three spurs; the large spur ("calcar") is curved and the other two spurs are just as long as the calcar. Pretarsal claws are present with a subapical tooth.|$|E
25|$|The red {{imported}} ant can be misidentified as the similar-looking S. richteri. The {{two species}} {{can be distinguished}} from each other through morphological examinations of the head, thorax, and postpetiole. In S. richteri, {{the sides of the}} head are broadly elliptical and the cordate shape seen in the red imported fire ant is absent. The region of the occipital lobes that are situated nearby the midline and occipital excision appear more crease-like in S. richteri than it does in the red imported fire ant. The scapes of S. richteri are longer than they are in the red imported fire ant, and the pronotum has strong angulate shoulders. Such character is almost absent in the red imported fire ant. A shallow but sunken area is only known in the larger workers of S. richteri, which is located in the posterior region of the dorsum of the pronotum. This feature is completely absent in larger red imported fire ant workers. The red imported fire ant's promesonotum is strongly convex, whereas this feature is weakly convex in S. richteri. Upon examination, the base of the <b>propodeum</b> is elongated and straight in S. richteri, while convex and shorter in the red imported fire ant. It also has a wide postpetiole with either straight or diverging sides. The postpetiole in S. richteri is narrower with converging sides. In S. richteri, the transverse impression on the posterodorsal portion of the postpetiole is strong, but weak or absent in the red imported fire ant. As well as that, S. richteri workers are 15% larger than red imported fire ant workers, are blackish-brown, and have a yellow stripe on the dorsal side of the gaster.|$|E
500|$|The only {{specimen}} of Y. intermedius is [...] that has several cracks surrounding it, {{and areas of}} white [...] "mold" [...] coatings. The indent behind the <b>propodeum</b> (the first abdominal segment) is deep, {{the connection between the}} segment and the thorax is wide and covered in wrinkles of the exoskeleton. The <b>propodeum</b> has an angular appearance with a rounded corner when viewed from the side. [...] This separates the species from both Y. geinitzi and Y. mayrianum. [...] The legs of Y. intermedius are generally free of hairs while the mesosoma and head have only a few sparse hairs on the upper surface. [...] This is different then the much hairier Y. constrictus which always has numerous erect hairs on the body and legs. The high conical <b>propodeum</b> and scape which does not extend to the edge ofhte head capsule isolate Y. intermedius from Y. samlandicus. [...] The right antennae of the type specimen is preserved with the head of a Ctenobethylus goepperti worker ant clamped near the tip, and it seems the two had just fought prior to entombment.|$|E
500|$|The mesosoma is [...] {{wide and}} covered in erect setae (on the dorsal surfaces). On the <b>propodeum,</b> the setae are {{slightly}} recurved. The neck is long and one-quarter {{the length of the}} thorax (when excluding the <b>propodeum).</b> V-shaped sulci are present on the dorsomedial portion of the pronotum. The promesonotal suture (a rigid joint between two or more hard elements of an organism) is also well developed and complete. The sulcus is known to demarcate the entirety of the ants' mesoscutum and mesoscutellum. When measured, the scutellum is approximately half the length of the scutum, and the scutellums dorsal surface has a pair of deep, rectangular-shaped foveae that is located nearby the median line. The dorsellum is well developed and has a pair of shallow foveae. The pronotum contains little to no foveae or setae, but it is fully developed. The mesopleuron is separated from the mesosoma by complete sulci, and when viewed dorsally, it bears a series of C-shaped grooves and foveae. The <b>propodeum</b> measures [...] long and sports a slit-like spiracle which faces to the rear; the posterior margin of the <b>propodeum</b> is shelf-like and medically emarginates. The metapleural gland has a large, crescent shaped opening and well developed metapleural bulla. Trochantellus is found on all legs, and they are very well separated from the trochanter (leg part attached rigidly to the femur) and femur on both the meso- and metathoracic legs (the middle and hindmost pair of legs). On the ventral margin, a subapical tooth can be seen on the large claws. The metasoma is mostly obscured by a large bubble. A large stinger appears to be present.|$|E
500|$|Unlike other genera in Dolichoderinae, {{the front}} {{margin of the}} clypeus is not below the mandibles; instead, it is located above them.

500|$|There are {{two forms}} of Polistes exclamans in the United States: typical and variable. The typical form is found in {{south-eastern}} United States and inhabits the following states: North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Florida, Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Kansas, Colorado, and Arizona. Although this formâ€™s color can vary, it almost always has some yellow coloring. Both the <b>propodeum</b> and the mesonotum are marked with yellow. The <b>propodeum</b> normally has four yellow stripes, whereas the mesonotum has yellow lines. It also may have yellow markings on its head. The wings, however, are not yellow in color or yellow tinged like some other wasps but are infuscate and purple in color. The typical form often can be confused with Polistes fuscatus, Polistes crinitus, or Polistes minor. The variable form is red-brown in coloring. The middle of the flagellum, {{the base of the}} abdominal segments, and the outer side of the mid and hind tibiae are infuscate or black colored, as are the wings. Instead of yellow markings, the variable form has pale ivory-white markings that are dispersed throughout the body. P. exclamans have antennae banded with red, black and yellow, while most paper wasps only have one antennae color. In females, the fore wing length can range from [...] and in males the fore wings can range from [...] The extent of ferruginous markings is variable.|$|E
500|$|In general, meat ants are {{medium to}} large in size, {{measuring}} , {{and can be}} easily recognised by their dark-bluish body and red head. Generally, their heads and pronotums share similar colours and are lighter than the mesothorax (the middle of the three segments in the thorax) and the <b>propodeum</b> (the first abdominal segment), which are reddish brown. However, the head may sometimes be lighter, and the pronotum and mesothorax may share similar colours. The mesosomal setae (as in haur found on the mesosoma) are dark and sometimes translucent. The iridescence between the compound eyes and the lateral portion of the head ranges from slightly purple to strong and dark purple. The colour of the legs and coxae (the basal segment of the insect leg, which attaches to the body) are darker than the mesothorax, and the petiole (narrow waist) is reddish brown and also darker than the mesothorax. The lateral portion of the second gastral tergite (a dorsal segment other than the head) is shiny, and the iridescence varies among workers, from green or blue to plain green and purple. The soft hairs on the head are frequent around the occipital margin, and around the mandibular insertion, three to eight pale setae are usually seen. The soft hairs are also common around the first gastral tergite. Examined specimens show no known ocelli. Erect setae on the pronotum are abundant. The [...] (meaning in front and toward the back) portion of the <b>propodeum</b> is arched and flat.|$|E
500|$|M. campanulae are {{medium-sized}} bees. [...] Anatomically, {{they have}} a head, a middle section called a mesosoma, and a posterior section called a metasoma. [...] The mesosoma is formed by fusion of the first abdominal segment or <b>propodeum</b> with the thorax. [...] They have both compound eyes and simple eyes (ocelli), similar to many other insects. [...] The mandibles in these resin gathering bees are characteristically lacking cutting edges found in the closely related leafcutters. [...] The males are smaller than the females.

500|$|A {{large number}} of hairs grow from the gaster, mesonotum, pronotum and <b>propodeum.</b> On average, {{individual}} hairs are [...] long. Golden, erect setae are present under the head and on the mesosoma. The setae on the tibia are short in comparison to setae on the mesosoma. The workers' eyes bulge while soldiers' eyes are flat. Within the Camponotus nigriceps species group, the black-headed sugar ant can be easily mistaken for a banded sugar ant due to its similar appearance, but the latter are darker and have a band wrapping around their gaster, a feature absent on the black-headed sugar ant. Minor worker specimens are usually examined when trying to identify similar-looking species.|$|E
500|$|Ants of genus Myrmecia are {{generally}} {{referred to as}} [...] "bulldog ants" [...] and M. nigrocincta, like other species in the genus, has elongated mandibles. M. nigrocincta ants are primarily black and orange-red in colour. They have mandibles which are either black or yellow depending on where the ants are found. The gaster, head, legs and mesonotum are black while the pronotum, <b>propodeum,</b> petiole and post-petiole are red. The ant has linear ridges along the front of its head. It also has apical spurs on the tibia of both its middle leg and hind leg. The legs are thin and become more slender away from the body. M. nigrocincta can be distinguished from other species in the Myrmecia genus by the bi-coloured thorax and post-petiole which are yellowish-red and black and the yellowish-red node.|$|E
500|$|Sphecomyrma ants can be {{distinguished}} from other ants by their extremely primitive body structure, small, narrow wasp-like mandibles, short scapes (the basal segment of the antenna) and the exceptionally long funiculus, which is four times longer than the scape. The suture (a pattern of shallow grooves on the head) is well developed and the trochantellus (the [...] end of the femur) is absent. The node (a segment between the mesosoma, the middle part of the body, and gaster) of the petiole is noticeably dome-shaped and is separated from the <b>propodeum,</b> the first abdominal segment, {{and parts of the}} metasoma, the posterior part of the body, by several constrictions. The cuticle (outer exoskeleton of the body) is not sculptured and is covered with either scattered or spare setae, which are different types of bristle or hair-like structures. The body structure shows that Sphecomyrma ants were medium-sized formicids. Workers are known to have stingers.|$|E
500|$|Y. orbiculata was {{described}} {{from a single}} part and counterpart compression fossil found at the Middle Ypresian McAbee Fossil Beds, Kamloops Group, near Cache Creek, British Columbia. The type specimens numbered UCCIPR L-18 F-749 and UCCIPR L-18 F-750 for the part and counterpart is currently preserved in the palaeoentomology collections housed at Thompson Rivers University, in Kamloops, British Columbia. Archibald, Cover, and Moreau coined the specific epithet from the Latin [...] "orbiculatus", [...] meaning [...] "rounded" [...] or [...] "circular", {{in reference to the}} shape of the head. The species is discernible from the other two species of Ypresiomyrma by its notably rounded head capsule, and by the shape of the petiole which has a smoothly sloping convex shape with a node in the center. The petiole is similar in appearance to Prionomyrmex janzeni, and the <b>propodeum</b> is round. The queen is estimated to have been approximately [...] The compound eyes are large and oval shape, but the antennae cannot be described due to poor preservation. The mandibles are large, containing seven to eight teeth. A well-developed stinger is also present.|$|E
500|$|S. freyi ants are small, {{measuring}} [...] The mandibles are wasp-like, its 12-segmented antennae are {{far apart}} {{from each other}} and the second funicular segment is longer than all the other segments. This is unusual for ants, but such case occurs in Nothomyrmecia macrops. The scapes are very short at [...] The compound eyes are very long and convex, situated on the middle side of the head. The clypeus (one of the sclerites that make up the [...] "face" [...] of an arthropod or insect) is broad and convex and the ocelli (photoreceptors) are well developed. The mesosoma is slender and closely resembles those of Methocha malayana, measuring [...] The mesonotum is also long and slender with a distinct convexed scutum and scutellum, but these two features are separated from each other by an axillary region.

The gaster measures , and an acute protruding stinger, measuring [...] is present. The legs are long and slender with two tibial spurs present at each tibia, and the tarsal claws have a median tooth. The two worker specimens have little morphological differences, but they range in size. The head and segments of the antenna tend to be smaller in the holotype specimen while in the paratype they are slightly larger. The pubescence is short but scattered throughout the body, measuring [...] The colour of the specimens appears to be light-brown. The metapleural gland exhibits a notably wide and oval-shaped orifice, (openings into the body). The separation between the orifice and the posterior portion of the <b>propodeum</b> is twice the diameter than the orifice itself. The cuticle situated in the anterior portion (referring to what is in front) of the orifice is thinner in contrast to the cuticle surrounding the mesosoma, where it is notably transparent. An oddly shaped chamber can be seen beneath the cuticle, but this is most likely the atrium (chamber with a hardened, thickened wall). The gland itself is covered in a whitish mass and is located in the [...] region (meaning in front and toward the back) of the subcuticular chamber. The gland is said to be shrunken from its original size.|$|E
500|$|S. mesaki {{was found}} in a small piece of amber barely larger than the ant itself. The {{incomplete}} specimen numbered AMNH NJ-1023 is currently preserved at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. The appendages breach the surface of the amber while the petiole and gaster are completely absent. Engel and Grimaldi coined the specific epithet after Bob Mesak, the original collector who donated the specimen to the museum. The species is discernible from the other species by a portion of the clypeus having an elongated ventral lobe. The broad but shallow scrobes of the antennae, the size of the head and oval-shaped eyes can further distinguish S. mesaki from other Sphecomyrma ants. The only body parts of the ant that are preserved are the legs, mesosoma and head. The head is notably large, but it is shorter than its mesosoma. The head is [...] long and [...] wide, with the eyes alone measuring [...] The vertex is covered in sparse pilosity with [...] setae. Ocelli are present on top of the ants' head, precisely located just above the dorsal tangent. The base of the antennae emerges from the scrobes, which are equally as long as the scape. The eyes are well developed and located above the bottom of the antennae. The clypeus is setose, meaning that it bears bristles or setae, except on the middle part. The mandibles are small and only contain two teeth. The antennae are moderately long, the scapes are very short but the pedicel is even shorter. The mesosoma measures [...] and is setose. Several setae are seen around the metanotum (the dorsal sclerite) and <b>propodeum.</b> The coxae, the proximal segment and functional base of the leg, are setose (bearing bristle or setae), inflated and large. The metapleural gland opening is small and noticeable, located away from the <b>propodeum</b> and above the metacoxa (the hind of the coxa). The legs are moderately long. The forelegs first tarsomere (subsegments of the tarsus) is longer than the combined length of other tarsomeres more distant than the first subsegment. The number of stiff setae varies on each tarsomere: for example, the first tarsomere has seven pairs while the fourth tarsomere has only two pairs. The pretarsal claw has a single subapical tooth and the metasoma is absent.|$|E

The mesosoma measures , the length of the head is , the scape is , the diameter of the eyes are [...] and the forewings are [...] The species has a head which is shorter than it is wide, but has mandibles about as long as the head which are triangular in outline. The eyes are oval shaped. As with the three other species the antennal scape is long, one-third of the scape length protrudes past the occipital margin of the head. The pronotum in profile is either straight or weakly concave, and the petiole is weakly rounded with no node present. The <b>propodeum</b> has small denticles and is weakly convex, and the legs are long. The gaster has a well developed and long sting. This species can be distinguished from other Archimyrmex ants by its long mandibles; the shape of the petiole is almost the same as A. smekali, but their mandibles are much shorter and the mesosoma is more compact. The propodeum's dorsal surface is also more convex.|$|E

The head capsule has mandibles which are about 70% {{as long as the}} head capsule, and have four to five large teeth each. The antennal scape is longer than the occipital margin and the antenna is composed of an estimated twelve segments. The legs are elongated and narrow, the <b>propodeum</b> is weakly convex and the petiole does not have a node (a segment between the mesosoma and gaster). A. smekali can be distinguished from other species by its massive size, the constriction in the post-petiole and the absence of the node. It was previously thought the ant had an eight-segmented antennae, but the lectotype has seven segments; Dlussky also mentions that the original description provided by Elsa Rossi de Garcia does not match the description he provided.|$|E

500|$|M. herculeanus was {{described}} {{from a single}} side of a compression fossil found at the Middle Ypresian McAbee Fossil Beds, Kamloops Group, near Cache Creek, British Columbia. The incomplete specimen numbered UCCIPR L-18 F-974, is currently preserved in the paleontology collections housed at the Thompson Rivers University, Kamloops, British Columbia. Archibald, Cover, and Moreau coined the specific epithet [...] "herculeanus" [...] from the Latin name [...] "Hercules" [...] {{in reference to the}} notably sturdy and large morphology of the type specimen, and after the divine hero Heracles in Greek mythology, who was the son of Zeus and Alcmene. The species is discernible from the other species of Myrmeciinae by its notably larger size, the worker caste ant is estimated at over [...] in life. Its size is comparable to ants in the genus Ypresiomyrma. The shape of the petiole, a narrow waist that is located between the mesosoma and gaster is distinct from other species and is similar in structure to the genus Prionomyrmex though the shape and size of the mandibles are distinct. Overall, M. herculeanus was assigned to Myrmeciinae due to its mandible length, despite them being poorly preserved, and due to the appearance of its petiole and <b>propodeum.</b> The legs are long in comparison to its body length, and the gaster is robust. It is unknown if the species had a sting, due to the preservation of the specimen. The size of the single known worker is larger than any of the studied queens; as Myrmeciinae queens are slightly larger than the other castes in a species, this indicates M. herculeanus is most likely a distinct species. Due to the incomplete nature of the type specimen, the species was placed in Myrmeciites.|$|E

On average, workers measure around this character distinguishes these ants from queens, {{as well as}} the different variety of colours they exhibit on their bodies. The head and pronotum range from orange to brick-red, and the mesonotum and <b>propodeum</b> are either light, same in colour or darker than the head. The gaster can be brown or black with blue or purple iridescence and the legs are either orange or brown. The iridescence around the foreparts is blue, pink, pale greenish yellow and purple. The erect setae are brown. The head has a concave posterior margin (as in the end of an organism from its head) with erect setae abundant in front of the face. The sides of the head are convex. Fully erect setae on the genal (side region of the head) are either present or absent, although a small number of setae may be seen around the mandibular insertion. The eyes are semicircular and positioned around the midpoint of the ants' head capsule. The frontal carinae (a keel-shaped ridge or structure) are convex and the antennal scapes extend beyond the head's posterior margin by two or three times the diameter. Erect setae are found all over the antennal scape and noticeably prominent on the clypeal margin (a shield-like plate at the front of an insect). The mandibles are elongated and triangular, with long curved setae around the head capsule. The pronotum is evenly curved with at least 12 or more pronotal setae present. These setae are mostly short and bristly. The mesonotum is sinuous (meaning it has many curves), and, like the pronotum, has 12 or more mesonotal setae. The mesothoracic spiracles are very small and the propodeal dorsum is smooth or convex. There are also a number of propodeal setae. The dorsum of the node (a segment between the mesosoma and gaster) is thin, scale-like and sometimes vertical. There are both non-marginal and marginal setae present on the first gastral tergite around the gaster.|$|E

[...] Another patch of setae is present on the <b>propodeum,</b> sparse setae are found on the gaster and a group of tapered setae are clustered towards the end. [...] Based on the striking size of the workers, the species name [...] "magnus" [...] was chosen from the Latin meaning large.|$|E
2500|$|Queens have a {{head length}} of [...] and a width of [...] The scapes measure [...] and the thorax is [...] The head is almost indistinguishable from S. richteri, but the {{occipital}} excision is less crease-like and the scapes are considerably shorter. Its petiolar scale is convex and {{resembles that of}} S. richteri. The postpetiole has straight sides that never concave, unlike in S. richteri where they concave. The thorax is almost identical, but the clear space between the metapleural striate area and propodeal spiracles is either a narrow crease or not present. The side portions of the petiole are punctate. The sides of the postpetiole are opaque with punctures present, but no irregular roughening is seen. The anterior of the dorsum is shagreen, and the middle and rear regions bear transverse puncto-striae. All these regions have erect hairs. The anterior portions of both the petiole and postpetiole have appressed pubescence that is also seen on the <b>propodeum.</b> The colour of the queen {{is similar to that}} of a worker: the gaster is dark brown and the legs, scapes, and thorax are light brown with dark streaks on the mesoscutum. The head is yellowish or yellowish-brown around the central regions, the occiput and mandibles are a similar colour to the thorax, and the wing veins range from colourless to pale brown. Males appear similar to S. richteri, but the upper borders of the petiolar scales are more concave. In both species, the postpetiole's and petiole's spiracles strongly project. The whole body of the male is concolorous black, but the antennae are whitish. Like the queen, the wing veins are colourless or pale brown.|$|E
2500|$|Red {{imported}} {{fire ant}} workers {{range in size}} from small to medium, making them polymorphic. Workers measure between [...] The head measures [...] and is [...] wide. In the larger workers (as in the major workers), their heads measure [...] and [...] wide. The antenna scapes measure [...] and the thoracic length is [...] The head becomes wider behind the eyes with rounded occipital lobes present, and unlike the similar-looking S. richteri, the lobes peak further than the midline, but the occipital excision is not as crease-like. The scapes in major workers do not extend beyond occipital peak by one or two scape diameters; this feature is more noticeable in S. richteri. In medium-sized workers, the scapes reach the occipital peaks and exceed the rear border in the smallest workers. In small and medium workers, the head tends to have more elliptical sides. The head of small workers is wider out front than it is behind. In the major workers, the pronotum does not have any angular shoulders, nor does it have any sunken posteromedian area. The promesonotum is convex and the <b>propodeum</b> base is rounded and also convex. The base and declivity are of equal length. The suture of the promesonotum is either strong or weak in larger workers. The petiole has a thick and blunt scale; if observed from behind, it is not as rounded above in contrast to S. richteri, and sometimes it may be subtruncate. The postpetiole is large and broad, and in the larger workers, it is broader than its length. The postpetiole tends to be less broad in front and broader behind. On the rear side of the dorsal surface, a transverse impression is present. In S. richteri, this feature is also present but much weaker.|$|E

50|$|This ant is distinctively {{coloured}} {{with the}} head, antennae, thorax, legs and petiole and the anterior {{part of the}} first abdominal segment reddish or ochre-brown. The remainder of the abdomen is black or deep brown. The integument is smooth and reflective, though fine sculpturing granules can be seen under magnification. The <b>propodeum</b> is longer than it is wide. Posteriorly, the <b>propodeum</b> is concave with some fine vertical striations. The head and body are hairless.|$|E

5000|$|Nesagapostemon {{is one of}} {{only five}} Halictidae genera which are known from the Dominican amber record, three of which are totally extinct. [...] Nesagapostemon has a strong keel or carina {{encircling}} the <b>Propodeum.</b> The basal area of the <b>Propodeum,</b> not slanting in profile, is only half of the length of the vertical posterior surface. The related extinct halictid genus Eickwortapis has a longer basal area on the <b>Propodeum</b> and it does slant in profile. The middle legs have a dense covering of hairs, those on the inner surface being long enough to cover the metatibial spurs and those on the outside being long and plumose. Unlike Eickwortapis the inner metatibial spur on Nesagapostemon is hooked and the inner border of the [...] "C" [...] vein is double the length of the pterostigma.|$|E
