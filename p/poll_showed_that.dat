5|$|A ruling of the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina on 6 August 2017 {{decided that}} a disputed {{military}} facility in Han Pijesak is to be registered as property of Bosnia and Herzegovina. It {{is expected to be}} a precedent for all other similar facilities, and could thus be the final factor that will enable the activation of the MAP for Bosnia. An August 2010 <b>poll</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> 70 percent of the country supports NATO membership, but results were very different in the two constituent entities. While 90 percent of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina supported NATO membership, only 33 percent in Republika Srpska did.|$|E
5|$|On June28, 1991, a {{few months}} before the {{dissolution}} of the Soviet Union, the autonomous oblast declared its sovereignty and separated from Krasnodar Krai. It was subsequently recognized as the Republic of Adygea within the Russian SFSR and retained its status of a republic within the Russian Federation after the formal dissolution of the Soviet Union in December 1991. Between 2004 and 2006, attempts were made to merge the republic with Krasnodar Krai, but the proposal met with strong resistance from the native Adyghe population and was eventually put to rest. The results of a 2011 opinion <b>poll</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> 83% of the population of Adygea and over 90% of the population of Krasnodar Krai regard a potential merger in an unfavorable light.|$|E
5|$|In March 2013, a CRA <b>poll</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> the Progressive Conservatives {{had fallen}} below the NDP, with 39 per cent {{indicating}} they supported the New Democrats and 38 per cent supporting the PC Party.

An Angus Reid poll released on April 8, 2013, rating the performance of provincial premiers, showed that Dunderdale was the most unpopular premier in the country. Her approval rating was tied with British Columbia's Christy Clark at 25 per cent, while 73 per cent of respondents said they disapproved of Dunderdale's performance as premier.|$|E

5|$|The bill's passage was {{met with}} concern by Catholic authorities, {{including}} Pope John Paul II — who warned of a weakening of family values — and his successor Pope Benedict XVI. Cardinal López Trujillo, president of the Pontifical Council for the Family, said the Church was making an urgent call for freedom of conscience for Catholics and appealing to them to resist the law. He said every profession linked with implementing same-sex marriages should oppose it, {{even if it meant}} losing their jobs. Gay rights supporters argued that while the Catholic Church also formally opposed opposite-sex, non-religious marriage, its opposition was not as vocal; for example, the Church did not object to the marriage of Prince Felipe to Letizia Ortiz, who had divorced from a previous civil marriage. The church was unable to gather enough support to derail the bill, even though 80% of Spaniards identify as members of the Catholic Faith. Sociologists believe {{this may be due to}} the significant increase of liberalism in the realm of individual rights in recent years, where the Church traditionally had most influence, especially on family issues. A <b>poll</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> three quarters of Spaniards believe the church hierarchy is out of touch with social reality. A complementary explanation might be that the Church's influence on Spaniards declined after the death in 1975 of the dictator General Francisco Franco, whose regime was closely linked to the Church.|$|E
