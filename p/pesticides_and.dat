5|$|For {{most of its}} history, {{agriculture}} {{has been}} organic, without synthetic fertilisers or <b>pesticides,</b> <b>and</b> without GMOs. With the advent of chemical agriculture, Rudolf Steiner called for farming without synthetic <b>pesticides,</b> <b>and</b> his Agriculture Course of 1924 {{laid the foundation for}} biodynamic agriculture. Lord Northbourne developed these ideas and presented his manifesto of organic farming in 1940. This became a worldwide movement, and organic farming is now practiced in most countries.|$|E
40|$|A content {{analysis}} of 36 newspapers in 12 states were examined to determine if balanced reporting of <b>pesticide</b> <b>and</b> water issues existed in 1995. There were two hypotheses explored in this study: One, that journalists tend to bias their reporting of <b>pesticide</b> <b>and</b> water issues by using more mentions from environmental groups than other sources; and two, that journalists tend to bias their reporting by using more negative terminology than positive terminology when reporting on <b>pesticide</b> <b>and</b> water issues. An on-line search using the Lexis-Nexis newspaper database produced 302 usable articles for this study. The number of mentions of environmental groups, government agencies and agri-industry officials were listed in coding sheets. Also, negative versus positive terminology was coded. A chi-square analysis of coded data derived from the selected articles demonstrated that journalists use a balance of sources when reporting on <b>pesticide</b> <b>and</b> water issues. However the analysis also shows that journalists frequently use more negative terminology, such as "toxic," or "contaminated," than positive when writing about <b>pesticide</b> <b>and</b> water issues. Recommendations {{at the end of}} this study are made to help reporters understand more thoroughly the definitions of some of the terminology they use in writing about <b>pesticide</b> <b>and</b> water issues.

5|$|Synthetic nitrogen, {{along with}} mined rock phosphate, <b>pesticides</b> <b>and</b> mechanization, have greatly {{increased}} crop yields {{in the early}} 20th century. Increased supply of grains has led to cheaper livestock as well. Further, global yield increases were experienced later in the 20th century when high-yield varieties of common staple grains such as rice, wheat, and corn were introduced {{as a part of}} the Green Revolution. The Green Revolution exported the technologies (including <b>pesticides</b> <b>and</b> synthetic nitrogen) of the developed world to the developing world. Thomas Malthus famously predicted that the Earth would not be able to support its growing population, but technologies such as the Green Revolution have allowed the world to produce a surplus of food.|$|E

5|$|Choughs can be locally {{threatened}} by the accumulation of <b>pesticides</b> <b>and</b> heavy metals in the mountain soils, heavy rain, shooting and other human disturbances, but a longer-term threat comes from global warming, which would cause the species' preferred Alpine climate zone to shift to higher, more restricted areas, or locally to disappear entirely.

The local extinction of the Alpine chough and the reduced range of red-billed chough in the islands may have been due to climate change or human activity.|$|E

5|$|Many {{risk factors}} and {{protective}} factors have been proposed, sometimes in relation to theories concerning possible mechanisms of the disease, however, none have been conclusively related to PD by empirical evidence. When epidemiological studies {{have been carried out}} in order to test the relationship between a given factor and PD, they have often been flawed and their results have in some cases been contradictory. The most frequently replicated relationships are an increased risk of PD in those exposed to <b>pesticides,</b> <b>and</b> a reduced risk in smokers.|$|E
5|$|Since 1900, {{agriculture}} in the developed nations, {{and to a lesser}} extent in the developing world, has seen large rises in productivity as human labour has been replaced by mechanization, and assisted by synthetic fertilizers, <b>pesticides,</b> <b>and</b> selective breeding. The Haber-Bosch process allowed the synthesis of ammonium nitrate fertilizer on an industrial scale, greatly increasing crop yields. Modern agriculture has raised social, political, and environmental issues including water pollution, biofuels, genetically modified organisms, tariffs and farm subsidies. In response, organic farming developed in the twentieth century as an alternative to the use of synthetic pesticides.|$|E

5|$|Frog {{mutations}} {{and genetic}} defects have increased since the 1990s. These often include missing legs or extra legs. Various causes {{have been identified}} or hypothesized, including an increase in ultraviolet radiation affecting the spawn {{on the surface of}} ponds, chemical contamination from <b>pesticides</b> <b>and</b> fertilizers, and parasites such as the trematode Ribeiroia ondatrae. Probably all these are involved in a complex way as stressors, environmental factors contributing to rates of disease, and vulnerability to attack by parasites. Malformations impair mobility and the individuals may not survive to adulthood. An {{increase in the number of}} frogs eaten by birds may actually increase the likelihood of parasitism of other frogs, because the trematode's complex lifecycle includes the ramshorn snail and several intermediate hosts such as birds.|$|E

5|$|Human {{activities}} have affected stocks of {{many species of}} teleost, through overfishing, pollution and global warming. Among many recorded instances, overfishing caused the complete collapse of the Atlantic cod population off Newfoundland in 1992, leading to Canada's indefinite closure of the fishery. Pollution, especially in rivers and along coasts, has harmed teleosts as sewage, <b>pesticides</b> <b>and</b> herbicides have entered the water. Many pollutants, such as heavy metals, organochlorines, and carbamates interfere with teleost reproduction, often by disrupting their endocrine systems. In the roach, river pollution has caused the intersex condition, in which an individual's gonads contain both cells that can make male gametes (such as spermatogonia) and cells that can make female gametes (such as oogonia). Since endocrine disruption also affects humans, teleosts are used to indicate the presence of such chemicals in water. Water pollution caused local extinction of teleost populations in many northern European lakes {{in the second half}} of the twentieth century.|$|E
5|$|Human {{attitudes toward}} insects are often negative, {{reinforced}} by sensationalism in the media. This {{has produced a}} society that attempts to eliminate insects from daily life. For example, nearly 75 million pounds of broad-spectrum insecticides are manufactured and sold each year for use in American homes and gardens. Annual revenues from insecticide sales to homeowners exceeded $450 million in 2004. Out of the roughly a million species of insects described so far, not more than 1,000 {{can be regarded as}} serious pests, and less than 10,000 (about 1%) are even occasional pests. Yet not one species of insect has been permanently eradicated through the use of pesticides. Instead, at least 1,000 species have developed field resistance to <b>pesticides,</b> <b>and</b> extensive harm has been done to beneficial insects including pollinators such as bees.|$|E
5|$|Like {{other animals}} {{at the highest}} trophic levels, the killer whale is {{particularly}} at risk of poisoning from bioaccumulation of toxins, including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). European harbor seals have problems in reproductive and immune functions associated {{with high levels of}} PCBs and related contaminants, and a survey off the Washington coast found PCB levels in killer whales were higher than levels that had caused health problems in harbor seals. Blubber samples in the Norwegian Arctic show higher levels of PCBs, <b>pesticides</b> <b>and</b> brominated flame-retardants than in polar bears. When food is scarce, killer whales metabolize blubber for energy, which increases pollutant concentrations in their blood.|$|E
