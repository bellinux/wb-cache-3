Such combustion driven pumps directly transmit the impulse form a combustion event through the actuation membrane to the pump fluid. In order to allow this direct transmission, the pump needs to be almost entirely made of an elastomer (e.g. silicone rubber). Hence, the combustion causes the membrane to expand and thereby pumps the fluid out of the adjacent <b>pumping</b> <b>chamber.</b> The first combustion-driven soft pump was developed by ETH Zurich.|$|E

50|$|Effect of precession. When {{the piston}} {{is at the}} top of the {{reciprocation}} cycle (commonly referred to as top-dead-center or just TDC), the connection between the trapped fluid chamber and the pump's discharge port is closed. Shortly thereafter, that same chamber becomes open to the pump's inlet port. As the piston continues to precess about the cylinder block axis, it moves away from the valve plate thereby increasing the volume of the trapped chamber. As this occurs, fluid enters the chamber from the pump's inlet to fill the void. This process continues until the piston reaches the bottom of the reciprocation cylinder - commonly referred to as bottom-dead-center or BDC. At BDC, the connection between the <b>pumping</b> <b>chamber</b> and inlet port is closed. Shortly thereafter, the chamber becomes open to the discharge port again and the pumping cycle starts over.|$|E
5000|$|In an {{aircraft}} with a reciprocating fuel injected engine a hot start {{is a condition}} where an engine start is attempted {{after it has been}} run, achieved operating temperature, and then recently shut down. The engine is [...] "hot" [...] and hence the terminology hot start. When a reciprocating fuel injected engine is shut down, the residual engine heat dissipates into the air and the surrounding aircraft structure. Some of this heat is transferred to the engine fuel lines and fuel injector lines in the engine compartment and, because no fuel is flowing in the lines to cool them as would be under normal operating conditions, the fuel may vaporize or [...] "boil" [...] within these fuel lines creating a condition called vapor lock. This combination of liquid fuel and vaporized fuel within the fuel line will result in inconsistent fuel availability to the engine fuel pump and fuel injection system. If severe, the fuel pumps can [...] "cavitate" [...] (when the <b>pumping</b> <b>chamber</b> fills with fuel vapor rather than liquid fuel) and become ineffective. The vapor in the fuel lines and loss of fuel pump effectiveness result in inconsistent fuel flow to the engine fuel injectors and ultimately the cylinders resulting difficult starting. Vapor lock can also occur in flight in some aircraft resulting in a rough running engine or engine stoppage.|$|E
50|$|The Inductive Pump {{was first}} {{patented}} in the United States by Laurence R. Salamey in 1998 U.S. patent number 5 713 728 {{and again in}} 1999 U.S. patent number 5 899 672. An additional patent has been filed for in 2014 by Salamey. The pump was originally designed as an improvement to peristaltic and diaphragm pumps as they were susceptible to fracturing of the <b>pumping</b> <b>chamber</b> with use due to their flexing of plastic parts. Inductive pumps {{were found to be}} an improvement to accuracy and length of service before repairs were required. Over time Salamey continued to develop his understanding of magnetic fields and their use for propagation of force with the inductive pump. This has led to further refinements and increased efficiency. Additionally inductive pumps have developed the ability to achieve much higher pressures in excess of 3,000 psi. The same inductive pump technology can be applied to very small pumps delivering volumes in the micro-liter range to much larger pumps delivering volumes in the 10 gallon per minute range. Understanding of magnetic field propagation has led to increased design simplicity which is a hallmark of inductive pumps. There are very few moving parts and no mechanical linkages. The piston is the only moving part aside from the check valves and it is driven by an electrically controlled magnetic field.|$|E

50|$|Prior to the {{widespread}} adoption of electronic fuel injection, most carbureted automobile engines used mechanical fuel pumps to transfer fuel from {{the fuel tank}} into the fuel bowls of the carburetor. Most mechanical fuel pumps are diaphragm pumps, which are a type of positive displacement pump. Diaphragm pumps contain a <b>pump</b> <b>chamber</b> whose volume is increased or decreased by the flexing of a flexible diaphragm, similar to the action of a piston pump. A check valve is located at both the inlet and outlet ports of the <b>pump</b> <b>chamber</b> to force the fuel to flow in one direction only. Specific designs vary, but in the most common configuration, these pumps are typically bolted onto the engine block or head, and the engine's camshaft has an extra eccentric lobe that operates a lever on the pump, either directly or via a pushrod, by pulling the diaphragm to bottom dead center. In doing so, the volume inside the <b>pump</b> <b>chamber</b> increased, causing pressure to decrease.This allows fuel to be pushed into the pump from the tank (caused by atmospheric pressure acting on the fuel in the tank). The return motion of the diaphragm to top dead center is accomplished by a diaphragm spring, during which the fuel in the <b>pump</b> <b>chamber</b> is squeezed through the outlet port and into the carburetor. The pressure at which the fuel is expelled from the pump is thus limited (and therefore regulated) by the force applied by the diaphragm spring.|$|R
