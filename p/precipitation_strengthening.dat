50|$|The {{addition}} of scandium to aluminium creates nanoscale Al3Sc precipitates which limit the excessive grain growth {{that occurs in}} the heat-affected zone of welded aluminium components. This has two beneficial effects: the precipitated Al3Sc forms smaller crystals than are formed in other aluminium alloys and the width of precipitate-free zones that normally exist at the grain boundaries of age-hardenable aluminium alloys is reduced. Scandium is also a potent grain refiner in cast aluminium alloys, and atom for atom, the most potent strengthener in aluminium, both {{as a result of}} grain refinement and <b>precipitation</b> <b>strengthening.</b>|$|E

40|$|AbstractMagnesium–zinc–zirconium (ZK) alloys are <b>precipitation</b> <b>strengthened</b> by the {{addition}} of zinc and grain refined by zirconium. In ZK alloys these mechanisms interact since some Zn can be precipitated into Zn–Zr intermetallics. This reduces the fraction of age hardening precipitates. An experimental study has confirmed the presence of these two particle types in ZK 60, a commercial Mg–Zn–Zr alloy. A model has been developed to consider <b>precipitation</b> and <b>strengthening</b> in ZK alloys accounting for this interaction. It has been shown that whilst Zr additions will increase strength by grain refinement this is balanced by a loss of age hardening response. It is predicted that if the same fine grain size could be achieved without Zr then a significant strength increase of around 15 % would be expected. Therefore, in wrought applications where the final grain size is determined by recrystallisation, the use of Zr grain refiner in ZK alloys does not lead to optimum strengthening. The model was then applied to explore strategies to increase strengthening in Mg–Zn alloys...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: <b>Precipitation</b> <b>strengthened</b> copper {{constitutes}} {{a group of}} functional and structural materials used where combination of high electrical conductivity with high strength is required. A growing trend to use new copper-based functional materials is recently observed world-wide. Within this group of materials particular attention is drawn to those with ultrafine grain size of a copper matrix. Design/methodology/approach: This study was aimed to investigate mechanical properties and microstructure in strips of age hardenable CuNi 2 Si alloy processed by continuous repetitive corrugation and straightening (CRCS). Tests were performed with quenched (900 °C/ 1 hour/water) or annealed (650 °C / 1 hour) 0. 8 mm thick strips using original die set construction (toothed rolls and plain rolls set) installed in tensile testing machine. The changes of mechanical properties (HV, ultimate tensile strength, 0. 2 yield strength) as well as microstructure evolution versus number of deformation cycles were investigated. The microstructure was investigated by optical and electron microscopy (TEM and SEM equipped with EBSD). Findings: The obtained strengthening effects and observed microstructure changes have been discussed basing on the existing theories related to strengthening of ultra fine grained copper based materials. Practical implications: The CRCS process effectively reduced the grain size of CuNi 2 Si 1 alloy strips especially for annealed material, demonstrating the CRCS as a promising new method for producing ultra fine grained metallic strips.

5000|$|Heat {{treating}} is a {{group of}} industrial and metalworking processes used to alter the physical, and sometimes chemical, properties of a material. The most common application is metallurgical. Heat treatments are also used in the manufacture of many other materials, such as glass. Heat treatment involves the use of heating or chilling, normally to extreme temperatures, to achieve a desired result such as hardening or softening of a material. Heat treatment techniques include annealing, case hardening, <b>precipitation</b> <b>strengthening,</b> tempering, and quenching. It is noteworthy that while the term [...] "heat treatment" [...] applies only to processes where the heating and cooling are done for the specific purpose of altering properties intentionally, heating and cooling often occur incidentally during other manufacturing processes such as hot forming or welding.|$|E
5000|$|Dual-phase steel (DP steel) is a {{high-strength}} steel {{that has a}} ferritic-martensitic microstructure.DP steels are produced from low or medium carbon steels that are quenched from a temperature above A1 but below A3 determined from continuous cooling transformation diagram.This results in a microstructure consisting of a soft ferrite matrix containing islands of martensite as the secondary phase (martensite increases the tensile strength).Therefore, the overall behavior of DP steels is governed by the volume fraction, morpology (size, aspect ratio, interconnectivity, etc.), the grain size and the carbon content.For achieving these microstructures, DP steels typically contain 0.06-0.15 wt.% C and 1.5-3% Mn (the former strengthens the martensite, and the latter causes solid solution strengthening in ferrite, while both stabilize the austenite), Cr & Mo (to retard pearlite or bainite formation), Si (to promote ferrite transformation), V and Nb (for <b>precipitation</b> <b>strengthening</b> and microstructure refinement).The desire to produce high strength steels with formability greater than microalloyed steel led the development of DP steels in the 1970s.|$|E
5000|$|Inconel alloys are oxidation- and {{corrosion-resistant}} materials {{well suited}} for service in extreme environments subjected to high pressure and kinetic energy.

Inconel's high temperature strength is developed by solid solution strengthening or <b>precipitation</b> <b>strengthening,</b> depending on the alloy. In age-hardening or precipitation-strengthening varieties, small amounts of niobium combine with nickel to form the intermetallic compound Ni3Nb or gamma prime (γ').

40|$|Through {{analyzing}} the mesoscale disturbance field of a Meiyu rainstorm, {{it is found}} that there are close relations between the development and propagation of inertia-gravitational waves, rain belts and low vortex. The propagating patterns of inertia-gravitational waves are different in the upper and lower levels. In the early period of precipitation, convective instability triggers the inertia-gravitational waves. When there are inertia-gravitational waves propagating southward in the upper and lower levels, it is favorable to form multi-rain belts. In the mid of precipitation, the inertia-gravitational waves in the upper-layer rotate anticlockwise with the lower-layer vortex center, and <b>precipitation</b> <b>strengthens</b> and moves eastward in the meantime.

5000|$|Metals can be {{heat-treated}} {{to alter}} the properties of strength, ductility, toughness, hardness and/or resistance to corrosion. Common heat treatment processes include annealing, <b>precipitation</b> <b>strengthening,</b> quenching, and tempering. The annealing process softens the metal by heating it and then allowing it to cool very slowly, which gets rid of stresses in the metal and makes the grain structure large and soft-edged {{so that when the}} metal is hit or stressed it dents or perhaps bends, rather than breaking; it is also easier to sand, grind, or cut annealed metal. Quenching is the process of cooling a high-carbon steel very quickly after heating, thus [...] "freezing" [...] the steel's molecules in the very hard martensite form, which makes the metal harder. There is a balance between hardness and toughness in any steel; the harder the steel, the less tough or impact-resistant it is, and the more impact-resistant it is, the less hard it is. Tempering relieves stresses in the metal that were caused by the hardening process; tempering makes the metal less hard while making it better able to sustain impacts without breaking.|$|E
5000|$|High-strength {{low-alloy}} steel (HSLA) {{is a type}} of alloy steel that provides better mechanical properties or greater resistance to corrosion than carbon steel. HSLA steels vary from other steels in that they are not made to meet a specific chemical composition but rather to specific mechanical properties. They have a carbon content between 0.05-0.25% to retain formability and weldability. Other alloying elements include up to 2.0% manganese and small quantities of copper, nickel, niobium, nitrogen, vanadium, chromium, molybdenum, titanium, calcium, rare earth elements, or zirconium. Copper, titanium, vanadium, and niobium are added for strengthening purposes. These elements are intended to alter the microstructure of carbon steels, which is usually a ferrite-pearlite aggregate, to produce a very fine dispersion of alloy carbides in an almost pure ferrite matrix. This eliminates the toughness-reducing effect of a pearlitic volume fraction yet maintains and increases the material's strength by refining the grain size, which in the case of ferrite increases yield strength by 50% for every halving of the mean grain diameter. <b>Precipitation</b> <b>strengthening</b> plays a minor role, too. Their yield strengths can be anywhere between [...] Because of their higher strength and toughness HSLA steels usually require 25 to 30% more power to form, as compared to carbon steels.|$|E
50|$|Creep {{resistance}} {{is dependent on}} slowing the speed of dislocation motion within a crystal structure. In modern Ni based superalloys, the γ’-Ni3(Al,Ti) phase present acts {{as a barrier to}} dislocation motion. For this reason, this γ’ intermetallic phase, when present in high volume fractions, drastically increases the strength of these alloys due to its ordered nature and high coherency with the γ matrix. The chemical additions of aluminum and titanium promote the creation of the γ’ phase. The γ’ phase size can be precisely controlled by careful <b>precipitation</b> <b>strengthening</b> heat treatments. Many superalloys are produced using a two-phase heat treatment that creates a dispersion of cuboidal γ’ particles known as the primary phase, with a fine dispersion between these known as secondary γ’. In order to improve the oxidation resistance of these alloys, Al, Cr, B, and Y are added. The Al and Cr form oxide layers that passivate the surface and protect the superalloy from further oxidation while B and Y are used to improve the adhesion of this oxide scale to the substrate. Cr, Fe, Co, Mo and Re all preferentially partition to the γ matrix while Al, Ti, Nb, Ta, and V preferentially partition to the γ’ precipitates and solid solution strengthen the matrix and precipitates respectively. In addition to solid solution strengthening, if grain boundaries are present, certain elements are chosen for grain boundary strengthening. B and Zr tend to segregate to the grain boundaries which reduces the grain boundary energy and results in better grain boundary cohesion and ductility. Another form of grain boundary strengthening is achieved through the addition of C and a carbide former, such as Cr, Mo, W, Nb, Ta, Ti, or Hf, which drives precipitation of carbides at grain boundaries and thereby reduces grain boundary sliding.|$|E
40|$|A multi-mechanistic {{model for}} {{microstructure}} development and strengthening during non-isothermal treatment of <b>precipitation</b> <b>strengthened</b> Al-Cu-Mg based alloys is derived. The formation kinetics of the precipitates is modelled using the Kampmann and Wagner numerical model {{that accounts for}} complete transformation from the nucleation to the coarsening stages. The increase in critical resolved shear strength of the grains due to the precipitates is based on two mechanisms i. e. modulus hardening mechanism for the shearable Cu:Mg co-clusters and the Orowan mechanism for the non-shearable S phase precipitates. The contributions due to solute and dislocation hardening are also incorporated. The model is verified by comparing the predicted results with differential scanning calorimetry and hardness data on 2024 aluminium alloys. The microstructural development and strength/hardness predictions of the model are in reasonable agreement with the experimental data and the differences are {{discussed in terms of}} requirements for further model development...|$|R

Ultra-AHSS are designed to have austenite as the major phase, and the ductility is enhanced primarily by continuous strain hardening generated during forming.

40|$|In {{particle}} strengthened alloy systems, e. g. <b>precipitation</b> <b>strengthened</b> Ni-base superalloys, high-temperature creep is {{dictated by}} the motion of dislocations and their interactions with the particles. In particular, the steady state creep rate at low stress and high temperature is primarily governed by the evolution of interfacial dislocation networks which form {{as a result of}} dislocation-particle interactions. Development of back-stress during creep may be attributed to evolution of these networks. To understand the role of dislocation-particle interactions on the evolution of back stress, we have performed systematic discrete dislocation dynamics simulations (using a modified ParaDis code) in three dimensions using a model system composed of coherent cuboidal particles embedded in a matrix. Our model takes into account forces on the dislocations arising due to order strengthening. Our results show that the interparticle spacing critically controls the onset of dynamic recovery process during creep. Also the interparticle spacing and applied stress strongly affects the evolution of interfacial dislocation network...|$|R
5000|$|While Ni based {{superalloys}} {{are excellent}} high temperature materials and have proven very useful, Co based superalloys potentially possess superior hot corrosion, oxidation, and wear resistance {{as compared to}} Ni-based superalloys. For this reason, efforts have also been put into developing Co based superalloys {{over the past several}} years. Despite that, traditional Co based superalloys have not found widespread usage because they have a lower strength at high temperature than Ni based superalloys. The main {{reason for this is that}} they appear to lack the γ’ <b>precipitation</b> <b>strengthening</b> that is so important in the high temperature strength of Ni-based superalloys. A 2006 report on metastable γ’-Co3(Al,W) intermetallic compound with the L12 structure suggests Co based alloys as alternative to traditional Ni based superalloys. However this class of alloys was reported in a PhD thesis by C. S. Lee in 1971. The two-phase microstructure consists of cuboidal γ’ precipitates embedded in a continuous γ matrix and is therefore morphologically identical to the microstructure observed in Ni based superalloys. Like in the Ni-based system, there is a high degree of coherency between the two phases which is one of the main factors resulting in the superior strength at high temperatures. This provides a pathway for the development of a new class of load-bearing Co based superalloys for application in severe environments. In these alloys 'W' is the crucial addition for getting γ’ intermetallic compound that makes them much denser (>9.6 gm/cm3) compared to Ni-based superalloys. Recently a new class of γ - γ’ cobalt based superalloys have been developed that are [...] "W" [...] free and have much lower density comparable to nickel based superalloys. In addition to the fact that many of the properties of these new Co based superalloys could be better than those of the more traditional Ni based ones, Co also has a higher melting temperature than Ni. Therefore, if the high temperature strength could be improved, the development of novel Co based superalloys could allow for an increase in jet engine operation temperature resulting in an increased efficiency.|$|E

These experimental results were compared with both isothermal data and predictions of the Bodner-Partom-Bodner, 1987 elastic-viscoplastic theory to assess the effects of thermal history on constitutive behavior. The results indicate that the hardening evolution equations based on isothermal data are applicable for nonisothermal loading of these <b>precipitation</b> <b>strengthened</b> alloys.

The stress dependence of the creep rate is very sharp at both test temperatures and the apparent creep activation energy measured around 760 C is high, much larger in magnitude than the self-diffusion energy. Stress rupture in this large grain size material is transgranular and crystallographic cracking is observed. The rupture ductility is dependent on creep strain rate, but usually is low.
