25|$|The {{salivary glands}} in mammals are exocrine glands, glands with ducts, that produce saliva, which is {{composed}} of several components including amylase, a digestive enzyme that breaks down starch into maltose and glucose. In humans and some other mammals the secretion is alpha-amylase, also known as <b>ptyalin.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{digestive}} {{functions of}} saliva include moistening food {{and helping to}} create a food bolus. This lubricative function of saliva allows the food bolus to be passed easily from the mouth into the esophagus. Saliva contains the enzyme amylase, also called <b>ptyalin,</b> which is capable of breaking down starch into simpler sugars such as maltose and dextrin that can be further broken down in the small intestine. Only about 30% starch digestion {{takes place in the}} mouth cavity. Salivary glands also secrete salivary lipase (a more potent form of lipase) to begin fat digestion. Salivary lipase plays a large role in fat digestion in newborn infants as their pancreatic lipase still needs some time to develop.|$|E
25|$|The two parotid glands {{are major}} salivary glands {{wrapped around the}} mandibular ramus in humans. The largest of the salivary glands, they secrete saliva to {{facilitate}} mastication and swallowing, and amylase to begin the digestion of starches. It is the serous type of gland which secretes the <b>ptyalin.</b> It enters the oral cavity via the parotid duct or Stensen duct. The glands are located posterior to the mandibular ramus and anterior to the mastoid process of the temporal bone. They are clinically relevant in dissections of facial nerve branches while exposing the different lobes of it since any iatrogenic lesion will result in either loss of action or strength of muscles involved in facial expression. They produce 20% of the total salivary content in the oral cavity. Mumps, a virus infection, is caused due to infection in parotid salivary gland.|$|E

60|$|Section 20. In {{the month}} of the rabbit the food is acted upon by the teeth and saliva. The saliva {{contains}} <b>ptyalin,</b> a ferment converting starch into sugar, and it also serves to moisten the food as it is ground up by the cheek teeth. It does not act on fat to any appreciable extent. The teeth of the rabbit are shown in Figure XVIII., Sheet 4. The incisor teeth in front, two pairs above and one pair below (i.), are simply employed in grasping the food; the cheek teeth-- the premolars (pm.) and molars (m.) behind-- triturate the food by a complicated motion over each. Their crowns are flat for this purpose, with harder ridges running across them.|$|E
60|$|Section 21. This {{grinding}} {{up of the}} food in the mouth invariably occurs in herbivorous animals, {{where there is a}} considerable amount of starch and comparatively little hydrocarbon in the food. By finely dividing the food, it ensures its intimate contact with the digestive ferment, <b>ptyalin.</b> In such meat-eaters as the cat and dog, where little starchy matter and much fat is taken, the saliva is, of course, of less importance, and this mastication does not occur. The cheek teeth of a dog ({Section 91}), and more so of a cat, are sharp, and used for gnawing off fragments of food, which are swallowed at once. Between the incisors and premolars of a dog come the characteristic biting teeth, or canines, absent in the rabbit.|$|E
6000|$|Section 23. After mastication, {{the food}} is worked by the tongue and cheeks into a saliva-soaked [...] "bolus" [...] and swallowed. The passage down the {{oesophagus}} is called deglutition. In the stomach it comes {{under the influence of}} the gastric juice, formed in little glandular pits in the stomach wall-- the gastric (Figure VIII. Sheet 3) and pyloric glands. This fluid is distinctly acid, its acidity being due to about one-tenth per cent {of a hundred} of hydrochloric acid, and it therefore stops any further action of the <b>ptyalin,</b> which can act only on neutral or slightly alkaline fluids. The gastric juice does not act on carbo-hydrates or hydrocarbons to any very noticeable degree. Its essential property is the conversion of proteids into peptones, and the ferment by which this is effected is called pepsin. Milk contains a peculiar soluble proteid, called casein, which is precipitated by a special ferment, the rennet-ferment, and the insoluble proteid, the curd, thus obtained is then acted on by the pepsin. In the manufacture of cheese, the rennetferment obtained, from the stomach of a calf is used to curdle the milk.|$|E
5000|$|Amylase {{is found}} in saliva and breaks starch into maltose and dextrin. This form of amylase is also called [...] "ptyalin" [...] It will break large, {{insoluble}} starch molecules into soluble starches (amylodextrin, erythrodextrin, and achrodextrin) producing successively smaller starches and ultimately maltose. <b>Ptyalin</b> acts on linear α(1,4) glycosidic linkages, but compound hydrolysis requires an enzyme that acts on branched products. Salivary amylase is inactivated in the stomach by gastric acid. In gastric juice adjusted to pH 3.3, <b>ptyalin</b> was totally inactivated in 20 minutes at 37 °C. In contrast, 50% of amylase activity remained after 150 minutes of exposure to gastric juice at pH 4.3. Both starch, the substrate for <b>ptyalin,</b> and the product (short chains of glucose) are able to partially protect it against inactivation by gastric acid. <b>Ptyalin</b> added to buffer at pH 3.0 underwent complete inactivation in 120 minutes; however, addition of starch at a 0.1% level resulted in 10% of the activity remaining, and similar addition of starch to a 1.0% level resulted in about 40% of the activity remaining at 120 minutes.|$|E

50|$|There are {{a number}} of glucosides found in natural phenols and polyphenols, as, for example, in the {{flavonoids}} chemical family. Arbutin, which occurs in bearberry along with methyl arbutin, hydrolyses to hydroquinone and glucose. Pharmacologically it acts as a urinary antiseptic and diuretic; Salicin, also termed saligenin and glucose occurs in the willow. The enzymes <b>ptyalin</b> and emulsin convert it into glucose and saligenin, ortho-oxybenzylalcohol. Oxidation gives the aldehyde helicin.|$|E
50|$|Inulin is indigestible by {{the human}} enzymes <b>ptyalin</b> and amylase, which are adapted to digest starch. As a result, inulin passes {{through much of the}} {{digestive}} system intact. It is only in the colon that bacteria metabolise inulin, with the release of significant quantities of carbon dioxide, hydrogen, and/or methane. Inulin-containing foods can be rather gassy, in particular for those unaccustomed to inulin, and these foods should be consumed in moderation at first.|$|E
50|$|In some cultures, {{instead of}} germinating the maize {{to release the}} {{starches}} therein, the maize is ground, moistened in the chicha maker's mouth, and formed into small balls, which are then flattened and laid out to dry. Naturally occurring <b>ptyalin</b> enzymes in the maker's saliva catalyses the breakdown of starch in the maize into maltose. (This process of chewing grains or other starches {{was used in the}} production of alcoholic beverages in pre-modern cultures around the world, including, for example, sake in Japan.) Chicha prepared in this manner is known as Chicha de Muko.|$|E

40|$|The {{application}} of platinum redox electrode for potentiometric determination of salivary α-amylase (<b>ptyalin)</b> is described. <b>Ptyalin,</b> an enzyme present in human saliva, catalyses the hydrolysis of starch. The nonhydrolysed starch, which amount is {{inversely proportional to}} the <b>ptyalin</b> concentration, forms a complex with triiodide reducing accordingly initial triiodide concentration. The change of triiodide ion concentration causes the change of the triiodide/iodide redox-couple ratio, which results with the changes of the electrode potential of a redox-sensor. The changes are directly correlated with <b>ptyalin</b> concentration. The experimental data were compared with an appropriate theoretical model in which the sensor and analyte properties were optimized with Solver using the least-squares criterion to fit a theoretical curve to the experimental data set. The influence of physical activity on the <b>ptyalin</b> level in saliva was also investigated. It was found that <b>ptyalin</b> concentration in the rowers saliva strongly increases after their exposing to stronger physical activity (training), even by 2, 6 to 7 times in comparison with ptyaline level before training. The influence of alcohol consumption to the <b>ptyalin</b> level in saliva has opposite effect, i. e. after alcohol consumption the <b>ptyalin</b> activity/concentration dramatically desreases by 9, 5 - 24, 9 times compared to its activity before alcohol consumption...|$|E

The subjects were randomized to perform a simulated search in a confined space without or with communication, and the stress indices were compared between the two groups. Stress was observed in the form of changes in <b>ptyalin</b> level, visual analog scale scores including impression of the subjects, and autonomic nervous system responses.

40|$|The amounts, {{hydrogen}} ion concentrations, viscosity, specific gravity and <b>ptyalin</b> {{levels of the}} saliva collected for thirty minutes after stimulating the parotid glands were measured in 129 normal persons (129 normal parotids) and 118 patients (129 morbid parotids), {{and the results were}} interpreted {{on the basis of the}} theory of statistical inference. Stimulus was applied by dripping 1 cc of the aqueous solution of 1 / 4 mol tartaric acid on the tongue at ten minutes 2 ̆ 7 intervals. A study on the relation between the results of the above experiments and sialographic appearances of the parotids was also performed. 1) There was no significant change in the saliva secretion by a parotid gland attributable to the difference in seasons-i. e. between the period from May to October and the period from November to April. 2) Both the amounts and {{hydrogen ion}} concentrations were larger in persons younger than 19 years of age than in any other age groups, while they showed no essential difference between persons in their 20 s and 30 s than those over 40 years of age, 3) There was a close relation between the amounts of saliva secretion and the following 5 types of sialographic shadows of the parotid glands as classified by Prof. Kitamura-homogeneous shadow (type I), lobulated shadow (type II), dappled shadow with small spots (type II[), dapped shadow with large spots (type IV) and shadowless (type V). The secretion increased in amounts in the order as indicated above. 4) In cases of acute inflammation, there were a decrease in amounts, a fall in <b>ptyalin</b> levels and an increase in specific gravity. 5) In cases of sialoangiectasis, there were a decrease in amounts, a fall in <b>ptyalin</b> levels and an increase in hydrogen ion concentrations. 6) In cases of tumors of the parotid gland, there were decreases in amounts and hydrogen ion concentrations. 7) In cases where a parotid gland of one side had been removed, there was no increase in the amounts of saliva secretion by the residual gland; on the contrary, there were decreases in amounts and hydrogen ion concentrations and a rise in <b>ptyalin</b> levels; and many of them demonstrated shadows of types I and II which are assumed to indicate normal parotids. 8) There was no change in the functioning of the parotid gland on the same side as the ear which had had its inner and middle ears radically operated on. 9) In cases of xerostomia, there were decreases in amounts and hydrogen ion concentrations and arise in <b>ptyalin</b> levels; many of those cases that showed objected symptoms demonstrated shadows of types III and IV which are assumed to indicate morbid parotids. 10) In cases of atrophic rhinitis, there was no change in the nature of saliva secreted by the parotids. 11) The viscosity of the saliva secreted by the parotid gland has been of no significance...|$|E
40|$|Discussions on enzymes in oral biology {{traditionally}} have included salivary amylase (<b>ptyalin,</b> diastase, a- 1, 4 -glucan 4 -glucano-hydrolase, EC 3. 2. 1. 1). The function of amylase {{in the oral}} cavity is uncertain, except for {{its role in the}} digestion of starch remnants. ' Properties of Amylase ACTIVITY. -Alpha-amylase catalyzes a random splitting of the a- 1, 4 glucosidic bonds of glucan (this is not true with maltose). The end products of amylolytic digestion of starches, therefore, are maltose, some glucose, and "limit dextrins " that contain branching linkages other than a- 1, 4 glucosidic linkages. 2 - 4 The activity proceeds according to the "multiple attack " theory: each enzyme molecule is able to split a number of linkages on different glucose chains during one enzyme substrate complex formation. The degree of multiple attack is different for amylases from different sources (eg, salivary, pancreatic, bacterial); this is important when comparing the activity of different amylases. 5, 6 The activity of a-amylase is different from that of P-amylase, which splits off maltose units from the non-reducing end of the glucan in a zipper fashion. Beta-amylase is not found in animal sources and is present in the oral cavity only as a microbial product. The catalytic range of a-amylase also probably extends to the synthesis of maltose and maltosaccharides from a-D-glucopyran-osyl compounds; the amylases are part of a "glucosylase " group of enzymes. 7 ' 8 The activity and stability of a-amylase depends on the presence of chlorine ions and calcium; the latter probably form intra...|$|E
40|$|In a {{previous}} study (9) in which we evalu-ated the gastrointestinal tract {{in a group of}} 102 aged individuals, more than one-third com-plained of some aberration of taste. The present investigation was, therefore, formulated to ex-plore the possibility that the ability to perceive specific tastes was impaired with age and was related to the complaints referable to taste. Age-related changes occurring in the mouth might theoretically constitute important factors in the problem. A gradual diminution in the number of taste buds with increasing age has been described (11, 20). This change begins at age 40 - 45 in females and 50 - 60 in males (1). It has been reported that as many as two-thirds of the taste buds become atrophic in old age (17). The lips and oral mucosa become atrophic, and there is a loss of elasticity and a decrease in the tunica propria. The muscle tone and papillary coating of the tongue are de-creased (6). There is also symmetrical bilateral asymptomatic submaxillary gland enlargement (18). Significant physiological changes also occur. There is a decrease in the flow of saliva with a reduction in the <b>ptyalin</b> content. The pH of the saliva tends to become neutral, and slight alkalinity, especially in the edentulous patient, is not infrequent. The mucous glands secrete a thick ropy saliva which has a high mucin content (6). METHOD AND MATERIAL The control subjects selected (table 1) con-sisted of 100 non-institutionalized individuals under the age of 65 who were divided into two groups: Group I was composed of 45 individ-uals (27 females, 18 males) between the ages of 18 and 39, and Group II consisted of 55 indi-viduals (25 females, 30 males) between the ages of 40 and 64.

40|$|The {{following}} general conclusions may {{be drawn}} from the preceding work: Fibrin is altered by formaldehyde and is then less easily digested by pepsin and by trypsin. Papaïn is apparently unable to digest fibrin even when this is exposed to very weak formaldehyde (1 : 1000) for a very short time. The casein of milk, on contact with formaldehyde, undergoes rapid alteration and is as a result not coagulated by rennet, or but very slowly. Such altered casein, like similar fibrin, is not readily digested by the proteolytic ferments. The longer the formaldehyde acts on casein and on fibrin the more marked is the result. Pepsin is not affected by a one per cent solution of formaldehyde, even when the mixture has stood for four weeks. Even a five per cent solution of formaldehyde acting for three weeks has no effect on pepsin. Contrary results obtained by others are due to an alteration of the fibrin by the formaldehyde. A putrid solution of pepsin in distilled water one month old digests fibrin as readily as a fresh solution. Rennet is not affected even by a four per cent solution of formaldehyde acting for several weeks. The absence of coagulation at times is due to the action of formaldehyde on the casein of the milk and not on the rennet ferment. Papaïn is very quickly altered by formaldehyde, even in very dilute solution. Moreover, it is unable to digest fibrin that has been exposed to the action of a very dilute solution of formaldehyde for a short time. Trypsin is altered by formaldehyde {{to such an extent that}} digestion of fibrin will not take place, or but very slowly. The extent to which trypsin is affected by formaldehyde depends largely upon the amount of organic matter present, as well as on the amount of ferment in the solution. Amylopsin is not destroyed by very dilute solutions of formaldehyde, but stronger solutions decrease the activity of the ferment, and if used in sufficient concentration will destroy it completely. <b>Ptyalin,</b> like the diastatic ferment of the pancreas, is not destroyed by dilute solutions of formaldehyde. If the latter is used in rather strong concentration and allowed to act for some time it will destroy the ferment. The action of formaldehyde is more rapid and more marked at a slightly elevated temperature than at ordinary room temperature. Malt diastase, unlike the diastatic ferments of the saliva and pancreatic solution, is not destroyed by formaldehyde when this is used in moderate amount and at ordinary temperature. Unlike pepsin, a solution of malt diastase readily undergoes decomposition on standing even for one or more days. This destruction is undoubtedly due to bacteria since it does not take place when formaldehyde is present. Consequently the favoring action which formaldehyde apparently exerts on diastase really consists in the inhibition of the growth of micro-organisms, and hence the diastase is protected against decomposition...|$|E
