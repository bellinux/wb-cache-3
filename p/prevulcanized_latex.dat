40|$|To {{improve the}} {{hydrophilic}} property of natural rubber latex (NR), various methods for combining hydrophilic polymers; ie, mechanical blending (MB), semi-latex interpenetrating polymer network (semi-LIPN), and latex interpenetrating polymer network (LIPN), were studied. Polyacrylamide (PAM) and phthalated chitosan (PhChi) were chosen as hydrophilic polymers for this study. The desired membranes must possess sufficient tensile strength and high water sorption selectivity. The potential membrane usable for pervaporation dehydration of aqueous azeotrope ethanol was the LIPN type prepared from <b>prevulcanized</b> <b>latex</b> and PAM with 60 / 40 ratio and with 1 % EGDM...|$|E
40|$|The {{polymers}} {{are generally}} {{known to be}} very lightweight materials, flexible and easy processing. Each year, more and more the technology area has the demand for these properties associated with adjustable electrical conductivity. From this perspective, there are studies that seek to associate intrinsically conducting polymers (ICP) with polymer matrices that has good mechanical property. Among those ICP, polypyrrole (PPy) and polyaniline (PAni) has received much attention due to easy of synthesis, high environmental stability, high conductivity (10 2 S/cm) and low cost of monomers. However, they have poor mechanical property and low solubility. An alternative {{to overcome these problems}} is to make in situ polymerization of the conductive polymer in the presence of another polymer that possesses good mechanical properties. In this way, the aim {{of this study was to}} obtain natural rubber (NR) composites with PAni and NR with PPY by in situ polymerization of aniline and pyrrole, respectively, in the natural and prevulcanized natural rubber latex. Morphological, structural, electrical, mechanical and thermal properties these samples were studied. Analysis of infrared and UV-Vis-NIR spectra showed the polyaniline and polypyrrole are in doped state. The electrical conductivity of the composites showed to be dependent on the ratio rubber/ monomer, staying in the range of 10 - 14 to 10 - 2 S/cm. In most cases, higher conductivity occurred when <b>prevulcanized</b> <b>latex</b> was used. The strain at break of the composites increases with decreasing rubber/monomer ratio. For the same synthesis conditions the strain at break was higher to the composites obtained from <b>prevulcanized</b> <b>latex.</b> In some polymerization condition it was evident the occurrence of encapsulation of prevulcanized rubber particles with the conducting polymers mainly to low rubber/monomer ratioOs polímeros geralmente são muito conhecidos por serem materiais leves, flexíveis e de fácil processamento. Cada vez mais a área tecnológica tem a demanda dessas propriedades associadas a condutividade elétrica ajustável. Nessa perspectiva, há trabalhos que se empenham em associar Polímeros Condutores Intrínsecos (PCI) com matrizes de boa propriedade mecânica. Entre os PCI, o polipirrol (PPy) e a polianilina (PAni) têm se destacado devido à fácil síntese, alta estabilidade ambiental, alta condutividade (10 2 S/cm) e baixo custo dos monômeros. Uma das limitações nas aplicações tecnológica desses polímeros condutores está na sua pobre propriedade mecânica e baixa solubilidade. Uma das alternativas para contornar esses problemas é fazer a polimerizão in situ dos polímeros condutores na presença de um polímero com boas propriedades mecânicas. Dessa forma, o objetivo desse trabalho foi preparar blendas de borracha natural (BN) com PAni e BN com PPy através da polimerização in situ da anilina e do pirrol, respectivamente, no látex de seringueira, natural e prevulcanizado. Foram estudadas as propriedades morfológicas, estruturais, elétricas, mecânicas e térmicas dessas amostras. As análises dos espectros de infravermelho e UV-Vis- NIR evidenciaram a síntese, em meio látex, da polianilina no estado sal de esmeraldina (dopada) e do polipirrol no estado dopado. As blendas apresentaram condutividade elétrica na faixa de 10 - 14 a 10 - 2 S/cm que variou em função da razão borracha/monômero. Na maioria dos casos, obteve-se maior condutividade elétrica quando utilizou-se o látex prevulcanizado. A tensão na ruptura aumentou com a diminuição da razão de BN/monômero para as blendas obtidas a partir de látex natural e também de látex prevulcanizado. Para a mesma condição de síntese, a tensão de ruptura foi superior para as blendas obtidas a partir do látex [...] ...|$|E
30|$|The use of {{chemically}} crosslinked nanogels {{to improve}} various properties of virgin elastomers {{has been reported}} for the first time. Following conclusions {{can be drawn from}} the present work. Sulfur <b>prevulcanized</b> nanosized <b>latex</b> gels have been prepared and characterized using various methods. The morphology of gel filled NR and SBR systems has been studied using X-ray dot mapping, TEM, and AFM. These show that the gels are evenly distributed at low loadings, while they tend to form agglomerates at relatively higher loadings. SBR nanogels have greater tendency for agglomeration.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Modified {{natural rubber}} latex {{can be used}} as {{paperboard}} barrier coating in order to replace unrecyclable wax coating material. Natural rubber latex (NRL) was prevucanized in different time interval and the efficiency of crosslinking were determined by swelling ratio test. <b>Prevulcanized</b> natural rubber <b>latex</b> (Pre-VNRL) was blended with modified lignin dispersion to decrease sticking tendency of the coatings. Particle size of lignin dispersion was reduced by Mannish reaction using octylamine which can increase hydrophobility in lignin. Compared with Pre-VNRL coating, a reduction of water vapour transition rate (WVTR) was observed in blending-coated paper. Such moisture-barrier behaviour is attributable to a good compatibility of the nano-sized modified lignin particles with rubber. The blocking (sticking) tendency decreased with the content increase of lignin due to stiffness of lignin...|$|R
40|$|Nanoparticies {{have been}} widely used to enhance the {{properties}} of natural rubber (NR). In the present paper a novel nanocomposite was developed by blending nano-ZnO slurry with <b>prevulcanized</b> NR <b>latex,</b> and the thermal degradation process of pure NR and NR/ZnO nanocomposites with different nano-ZnO loading was studied with a Perkin Elemer TGA- 7 thermogravimetric analyzer. The thermal degradation parameters of NR/ZnO (2 parts ZnO per hundred dlY rubber) at different heating rates (B s) were studied. The results show that the thermal degradation of pure NR and NR/ZnO nanocomposites in nitrogen is a one-step reaction. The degradation temperatures of NR/ZnO nanocomposite increase with an increasing B. The peak height (R p) on the differential thermogravimetric curve increases with the increase of B. The degradation rates are not affected significantly by B, and the average values of thermal degradation rate C p and C f are 44. 42 % and 81. 04 %, respectively. The thermal degradation kinetic parameters are calculated with Ozawa-Flynn-Wall method. The activation energy (E) and the frequency factor (A) vary with ecomposition degree, and can be divided into three phases corresponding to the volatilization of low-molecular-weight materials, the thermal degradation ofNR main chains and the decomposition of residual carbon. <br /...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In {{order to}} obtain natural rubber (NR) latex-based biomaterial, the NR latex {{concentrate}} was prepared into <b>prevulcanized</b> natural rubber <b>latex</b> (SNRL) and then blended with a water dispersion of chitosan (CS) and poly(3 -hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) together, with {{the total amount of}} CS and PHB is of 1, 3, 5, 10 parts per hundred rubber (phr), and CS and PHB is of a ratio of 1 : 1; the SNRL was also blended with a water dispersion of CS or PHB only in the same amount for properties comparison. The mechanical properties including the tensile strength, elongation at break, 300 % modulus, tear strength and hardness of the 24 h water-leached SNRL/CS/PHB, SNRL/CS or SNRL/PHB films were tested. The results indicated that, the tensile strength first increased with increase in CS/PHB, CS or PHB content up to 1. 0 phr then decreased, the elongation at break decreased, the 300 % modulus, tear strength and Shore A hardness increased, with increase in CS/PHB, CS or PHB content, whereas most of the tensile strength and elasticity of the films can be retained when the content of CS/PHB, CS or PHB was less than 5. 0 phr.
