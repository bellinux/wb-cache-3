[...] The C-message weighting filter was chiefly used in North America. [...] The <b>Psophometric</b> <b>filter</b> is {{used for this purpose}} on international circuits. [...] See Psophometric weighting to see a comparison of frequency response curves for the C-message weighting and Psophometric weighting filters.|$|E
