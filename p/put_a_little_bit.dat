This allows us to formulate an approach to quantum theory which is perhaps compatible with quantum gravity.

This paper is written in relatively lay terms and presumes no prior knowledge of quantum theory. Keywords: Relationalism; Quantum Theory; Darwinian Evolution. In this short note we will try and learn a few things from the major modern physical theories of our time and then we shall try to apply these lessons to quantum theory.

6000|$|Miss Crawley, at present, {{lived with}} the Miss Prettymans, and {{assisted}} them in the school. This arrangement {{had been going on}} for the last twelve months, since the time in which Grace would have left the school in the natural course of things. There had been no bargain made, and no intention that Grace should stay. She had been invited to fill the place of an absent superintendent, first for one month, then for another, and then for two more months; and when the assistant came back, the Miss Prettymans thought there were reasons why Grace should be asked to remain a little longer. But they took great care to let the fashionable world of Silverbridge know that Grace Crawley was a visitor with them, and not a teacher. [...] "We pay her no salary, or anything of that kind," [...] said Miss Anne Prettyman; a statement, however, which was by no means true, for during those four months the regular stipend had been paid to her; and twice since then, Miss Annabella Prettyman, who managed all the money matters, had called Grace into her little room, and had made a little speech, and had <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of paper into her hand. [...] "I know I ought not to take it," [...] Grace had said to her friend Anne. [...] "If I was not here, there would be no one in my place." [...] "Nonsense, my dear," [...] Anne Prettyman had said; [...] "it is the greatest comfort to us in the world. And you should make yourself nice, you know, for his sake. All the gentlemen like it." [...] Then Grace had been very angry, and had sworn that she would give the money back again. Nevertheless, I think she did make herself as nice as she knew how to do. And from all this it may be seen that the Miss Prettymans had hitherto quite approved of Major Grantly's attentions.|$|E

He {{worked closely}} with McAbee to achieve {{a black and white}} that could help audiences suspend disbelief about an outer space where there is no {{atmosphere}} to filter light, while still leaving a lot up to the imagination. [...] "We wanted the audience to see much of what is happening in shadow," [...] explains McAbee. The Boy’s performance on stage was lit and photographed to create a massive shadow, which in some shots takes up much of the screen. Mott also lit and photographed The Boy like a silent movie star in the scenes that he and Curtis share in the space ship. Says McAbee," [...] Mott worked on <b>putting</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> more light on Greg than on me.

2500|$|Queensrÿche is {{the first}} album by the band to feature a vocalist other than Tate, {{sparking}} concerns with some fans that the sound will be too drastically {{different from what they}} were used to. New vocalist La Torre said in a late March 2013 interview that Tate always was [...] "a huge inspiration" [...] to him as a fan of the band, and he always tries to honor what Tate did vocally: [...] "I try to represent [...] {{to the best of my}} ability, but I also do <b>put</b> [...] <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of my flavor, which is <b>a</b> <b>little</b> edgier and <b>a</b> <b>little</b> grittier at times, and I try to be authentic but me at the same time." [...] La Torre especially sought to provide a [...] "common thread" [...] in the vocals, that he felt was missing from the previous few records released by Queensrÿche.|$|R
5000|$|La Torre's {{singing voice}} and style has been {{compared}} to that of Geoff Tate's in the 80s and early 90s. Commenting on his position in Queensrÿche, he has said: [...] "I always try to honor what Geoff Tate did vocally. He was a huge inspiration, and I try to represent Queensrÿche {{to the best of my}} ability, but I also, you know, do <b>put</b> in <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of my flavor, which is <b>a</b> <b>little</b> edgier and <b>a</b> <b>little</b> grittier at times. And, you know, I try to be authentic but me at the same time." [...] He also considers Tate to be a legendary artist, who shaped [...] "a certain unique defined sound that was very influential to me". He names Rob Halford, Ronnie James Dio, Geoff Tate, Bruce Dickinson and Jeff Scott Soto as the greatest examples of tenor vocalists, while he also likes to do growls and heavier singing in the style of Chuck Billy and Phil Anselmo.|$|R

Also, whatever accent he <b>puts</b> on, there's <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of <b>a</b> buzz to it that he can't disguise.

60|$|Sir Alured in {{his letter}} {{expressed}} a hope that Everett might be informed instantly. He would have written himself had he known Everett's address. But he did know that his elder cousin was in town, and he besought his elder cousin to come at once,--quite at once,--to Wharton. Emily, he said, would of course accompany her father on such an occasion. Then there were long letters from Mary Wharton, and even from Lady Wharton, to Emily. The Whartons {{must have been very}} much moved when Lady Wharton could be induced to write a long letter. The Whartons were very much moved. They were in a state of enthusiasm at these news, amounting almost to fury. It seemed as though they thought that every tenant and labourer on the estate, and every tenant and labourer's wife, would be in an abnormal condition and unfit for the duties of life, till they should have seen Everett as heir of the property. Lady Wharton {{went so far as to}} tell Emily which bedroom was being prepared for Everett,--a bedroom very different in honour from any by the occupation of which he had as yet been graced. And there were twenty points as to new wills and new deeds as to which the present baronet wanted the immediate advice of his cousin. There were a score of things which could now be done which were before impossible. Trees could be cut down, and buildings <b>put</b> up; and <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of land sold, and <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of land bought;--the doing of all which would give new life to Sir Alured. A life interest in an estate is a much pleasanter thing when the heir is a friend who can be walked about the property, than when he is an enemy who must be kept at arm's length. All these delights could now be Sir Alured's,--if the old heir would give him his counsel and the young one his assistance.|$|R
