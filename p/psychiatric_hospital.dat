5|$|In 1929 the USSR had 70 <b>psychiatric</b> <b>hospitals</b> and 21,103 <b>psychiatric</b> beds. By 1935 {{this had}} {{increased}} to 102 <b>psychiatric</b> <b>hospitals</b> and 33,772 <b>psychiatric</b> beds, and by 1955 there were 200 <b>psychiatric</b> <b>hospitals</b> and 116,000 <b>psychiatric</b> {{beds in the}} Soviet Union. The Soviet authorities built <b>psychiatric</b> <b>hospitals</b> at a rapid pace and increased the quantity of beds for patients with nervous and mental illnesses: between 1962 and 1974 the number of beds for psychiatric patients increased from 222,600 to 390,000. Such an expansion {{in the number of}} psychiatric beds was expected to continue in the years up to 1980. Throughout this period the dominant trend in Soviet psychiatry ran counter to the vigorous attempts in Western countries to treat as many as possible as out-patients rather than in-patients.|$|R

[...] He agreed that Falun Gong practitioners sent to <b>psychiatric</b> <b>hospitals</b> had been [...] "misdiagnosed and mistreated", but did not find definitive evidence that the use of psychiatric facilities was part of a uniform government policy, noting instead that patterns of institutionalization varied from province to province.|$|R

40|$|Objective: This paper aims {{to explore}} the options {{available}} for developing community-based care and {{improving the quality of}} care in <b>psychiatric</b> <b>hospitals</b> in Ghana. Method: Semi-structured interviews (SSIs) and focus group discussions (FGDs) were conducted with a cross-section of stakeholders including health professionals, researchers, policy makers, politicians, users and carers. The SSIs and FGDs were recorded digitally and transcribed verbatim. Apriori and emergent themes were coded and analysed with NVivo version 7. 0, using a framework analysis. Results: <b>Psychiatric</b> <b>hospitals</b> in Ghana have a mean bed occupancy rate of 155 %. Most respondents were of the view that the state <b>psychiatric</b> <b>hospitals</b> were very congested, substantially compromising quality of care. They also noted that the community psychiatric system was lacking human and material resources. Suggestions for addressing these difficulties included committing adequate resources to community psychiatric services, using <b>psychiatric</b> <b>hospitals</b> only as referral facilities, relapse prevention programmes, strengthening psychosocial services, adopting more precise diagnoses {{and the development of a}} policy on long-stay patients. Conclusion: There is an urgent need to build a credible system of community-based care and improve the quality of care in <b>psychiatric</b> <b>hospitals</b> in Ghana...|$|R

5|$|In his ghostly form, Frank {{confronts the}} Grim Reaper and discovers {{that he is}} the ghost of Johnny Bartlett, a <b>psychiatric</b> <b>hospital</b> orderly who killed twelve people 30 years earlier, before being captured, convicted and executed. Newspaper reports reveal that his {{greatest}} desire was to become the most prolific serial killer ever, showing pride at killing more than contemporaries like Charles Starkweather. Patricia Bradley, then a teenager, was accused as his accomplice, although she escaped the death penalty due to her underage status. Lucy resuscitates Frank and they visit Patricia. Unknown to them, Patricia is still in love with Bartlett and on friendly, homicidal terms with Bartlett's ghost, and eventually kills her own mother, who had been trying to monitor her daughter's behavior. Lucy and Frank trap Bartlett's spirit in his urn, which Patricia has kept. The pair make for the chapel of the now-abandoned <b>psychiatric</b> <b>hospital</b> hoping to send Bartlett's ghost to Hell.|$|E

50|$|The new Italian law {{was created}} after {{conducting}} the long-term pilot experiments of deinstitutionalization {{in a number}} of cities (including Gorizia, Arezzo, Trieste, Perugia, Ferrara) between 1961 and 1978.

The demonstration consisted in showing the effectiveness of the new system of care per its ability to make a gradual and ultimate closure of <b>psychiatric</b> <b>hospitals</b> possible, while the new services, which can appropriately be called “alternative” instead of “complementary” to the <b>psychiatric</b> <b>hospitals,</b> were being created.

But in reality, in the psychiatric wards of Belgian prisons and in the high-security <b>psychiatric</b> <b>hospitals,</b> the space given to mentalhealth care is very problematic : services are underfinanced, drug treatment is systematic and these confinement places are very often overcrowded. The separation between evaluation tasks and caring tasks, which has been recently enforced in some places of confinement, marks a very important issue...|$|R
