The present slate shingles are, of course, not the original roofing material which most likely was cedar shingles or clapboards painted or covered with tar.|$|E

There was a low <b>plastered</b> <b>ceiling</b> to a part of it; the rest was open, to the ridge of the tiled roof, and there were beams across. Hay and straw were stored in {{that portion of the}} place, fagots for firing, and a heap of apples in sand. I had to pass through that part, to get at the other. My memory is circumstantial and unshaken. I try it with these details, and I see them all, in this my cell in the Bastille, near the close of the tenth year of my captivity, as I saw them all that night.|$|E
