50|$|India {{is faced}} with huge {{challenges}} to manage its vast <b>population</b> <b>reserve</b> and correctly transition from the burden of overpopulation to empowering Indians to drive domestic growth. The process of technology transition & human capital capacity-building initiated in India during the 1960s started bearing its fruits in the mid-1990 and dove-tailed neatly with the adoption of economic reforms rendered inevitable {{after the end of}} the Cold War. Reduced venture capital facilities forced educated entrepreneurs to leverage intra-familial/neighbourhood angel investors to create technology start-ups right from the beginning of the digital Revolution, many of which have matured into niche/sectoral leaders (Biocon, Reddy Labs, Sun-Ranbaxy, Dishman, Wipro, Infosys, Larsen & Toubro, Welspun, Suzlon, Vedanta, Reliance). Prudent opening-up of the Indian economy has allowed long established domestic business conglomerates (Tata, Mahindra, Birla, Bajaj, Kirloskar, Godrej, TVS, Essar) to select optimums in production-possibilities in preparation for competition in the domestic markets from global heavy-weights. Corporate India is increasingly using the public-private partnership model to cater to India's vast public infrastructure requirements.|$|E

In order {{to transport the}} coal to Newcastle, the Company was desirous of constructing a railway 6+1/4 mi long, junctioning with the Government line, then under construction, at Adamstown. The necessary act was passed on 14 April 1885, and five years was allowed for {{the completion of the}} line. However, trouble developed in that {{it was found that the}} <b>population</b> <b>reserve</b> adjoining Newcastle encroached on the Company's property, and that several other portions had been taken up by different persons. This led to court proceedings and it was not until 1887 that the position had become sufficiently stabilised to warrant the Company proceeding with the construction of the line. As by this time the Company's five-year period prescribed by the act had nearly expired, an amending act was obtained on 5 June 1888, granting a further five year. On 21 December of that year, another amending act was passed authorising, amongst other things, deviations in the route, a branch to the South Burwood Coal Company's colliery, and an extension of the rights of construction to the northern shores of Lake Macquarie, through or near the village of Belmont.|$|E

40|$|Akşehir, as a {{characteristic}} Ottoman {{town in the}} XVI. Century, has been a settlement since the early ages because of its geographical position fit for cultivation and husbandry. Besides this, it has been of central importance due to its location along the pilgrim way of İstanbul-Konya-Halep-Mekke and within a commercial and economic activity. We can predict that Akşehir which had an important <b>population</b> <b>reserve</b> until the ottoman period, was an important center before the ottomans because it was very near to Konya, the capital of Anatolian Seljuks {{and it was on}} the very important trade routes. When we look at Akşehir town economically, different from the constituent villages, agricultural sector was more backward than service sector. Besides, we can understand from registry books that in Akşehir villages grow a variety of fruit and vegetables. We can think that this was a good proof that the foundations of the area which was known as Green Akşehir were laid since those dates...|$|E

40|$|Improved {{management}} {{approaches are}} needed to reduce {{the rate at which}} humans are depleting exploited marine populations and degrading marine ecosystems. Networks of no-take marine reserves are promising management tools because of their potential to (1) protect coastal ecosys-tem structure and functioning, (2) benefit exploited populations and fisheries, (3) improve scientif-ic understanding of marine ecosystems, and (4) provide enriched opportunities for non-extractive human activities. By protecting marine ecosystems and their <b>populations,</b> no-take <b>reserve</b> net-works can reduce risk by providing important insurance for fishery managers against overex-ploitation of individual <b>populations.</b> Replicated <b>reserves</b> also foster strong scientific testing of fish-ery and conservation management strategies. Reserve networks will require social acceptance, adequate enforcement, and effective scientific evaluation to be successful. Processes for reserve establishment should accommodate adaptive management so boundaries and regulations can be modified to enhance performance. However, even well-designed reserve networks will require continued conservation efforts outside reserve boundaries to be effective.
