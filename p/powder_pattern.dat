50|$|In {{polycrystalline}} {{media or}} frozen solution, ENDOR can provide spatial {{relationships between the}} coupled nuclei and electron spins. This is possible in solid phases where the EPR spectrum arises from the observance of all orientations of paramagnetic species; as such the EPR spectrum is dominated by large anisotropic interactions. This is not so in liquid phase samples where spatial relationships are not possible. Such spatial arrangements require that the ENDOR spectra are recorded at different magnetic field settings within the EPR <b>powder</b> <b>pattern.</b>|$|E
40|$|The use of {{calculated}} <b>powder</b> <b>patterns</b> {{within the}} materials diffraction {{community has been}} described and referenced {{many times in the}} past. However, with the availability of increasing amounts of single-crystal-derived structural information, calculating <b>powder</b> <b>patterns</b> for identification and comparison may be easier, in some circumstances, than generating experimental reference patterns from well-characterized materials. For this reason, a task group of members of the International Centre for Diffraction Data, was formed “to make recommendations on the calculation of <b>powder</b> difffraction <b>patterns</b> and the use of these data for the characterization of crystalline materials. ...|$|R

50|$|The X-ray {{diffraction}} {{patterns of}} plastic crystals {{are characterized by}} strong diffuse intensity {{in addition to the}} sharp Bragg peaks. In a <b>powder</b> <b>pattern</b> this intensity appears to resemble an amorphous background as one would expect for a liquid, but for a single crystal the diffuse contribution reveals itself to be highly structured. The Bragg peaks can be used to determine an average structure but due to the large amount of disorder this is not very insightful. It is the structure of the diffuse scattering that reflects the details of the constrained disorder in the system. Recent advances in two-dimensional detection at synchrotron beam lines facilitate the study of such patterns.|$|E
50|$|The {{powdered}} {{x-ray diffraction}} pattern had {{a slightly different}} conclusion but relatively {{the same as the}} electron diffraction and microscopy end numbers. The <b>powder</b> <b>pattern</b> was indexed on a monoclinic unit cell and the absences consistent with the P21/c space group were found. The unit cell was similar to the electron diffraction and microscopy: a = 19.794(8), b =14.367(5), c = 11.320(3) Å, β = 125.49(4)°. But there was an unexplained 0.066 Å difference in the c parameters. The reflections that correspond to the 2xa superstructure are not visible in the powder x-ray pattern of khmaralite. The intensity of the strongest super-cell reflection is only 0.4% of that of the most intense sub-cell reflection.|$|E

5000|$|Coffinite's {{chemical}} formula is U(SiO4)1−x(OH)4x. [...] X-ray powder patterns from samples of coffinite allowed geologists to classify it {{as a new}} mineral in 1955. [...] A comparison to the x-ray <b>powder</b> <b>pattern</b> of zircon (ZrSiO4) and thorite (ThSiO4) {{was the basis for}} this classification. [...] Preliminary chemical analysis indicated that the uranous silicate exhibited hydroxyl substitution. [...] The results of Sherwood’s preliminary chemical analysis were based on samples from three locations. Hydroxyl bonds and silicon-oxygen bonds also proved to exist after infrared absorption spectral analyses were performed. [...] The hydroxyl substitution occurs as (OH)44− for (SiO4)4−. [...] The hydroxyl constituent in coffinite later proved to be nonessential in the formation of a stable synthetic mineral. [...] Recent electron microprobe analysis of the submicroscopic crystals uncovered an abundance of calcium, yttrium, phosphorus, and minimal lead substitutions along with traces of other rare earth elements.|$|E
5000|$|The {{technique}} is a time-honored but a somewhat out-of-favor technique for {{the determination of}} degree of crystallinity of polymer samples. The diffraction pattern generated allows to determine the chemical composition or phase composition of the film, {{the texture of the}} film (preferred alignment of crystallites), the crystallite size and presence of film stress. According to this method the sample is scanned in a wide-angle X-ray goniometer, and the scattering intensity is plotted {{as a function of the}} 2θ angle. X-ray diffraction is a non destructive method of characterization of solid materials. When X-rays are directed in solids they will scatter in predictable patterns based upon the internal structure of the solid. A crystalline solid consists of regularly spaced atoms (electrons) that can be described by imaginary planes. The distance between these planes is called the d-spacing. The intensity of the d-space pattern is directly proportional to the number of electrons (atoms) that are found in the imaginary planes. Every crystalline solid will have a unique pattern of d-spacings (known as the <b>powder</b> <b>pattern),</b> which is a “finger print” for that solid. In fact solids with the same chemical composition but different phases can be identified by their pattern of d-spacings.|$|E
5000|$|When alacranite {{was first}} {{discovered}} in 1970 by Clark, it {{was associated with}} barite and calcite veins in the Alacran silver mine. [...] They also assumed that the mineral was identical to the species occurring in the Ag-As-Sb vein deposit at Alacran due to the similarity of its X-ray diffraction <b>powder</b> <b>pattern.</b> [...] They discovered that alacranite {{was similar to the}} high-temperature α polymorph of As4S4 in X-ray characteristics. In addition, alacranite was considered as realgar-like mineral. After that, they reported the composition of alacranite as As8S9 when they noticed another occurrence of Alacranite in Uzon Caldera associated with realgar and uzonite as cement in sandy gravels. They reported the composition of alacranite to be As8S9 regarding to the electron-microprobe analyses. When they analyzed a mineral during seafloor sampling consisting of red and orange arsenic sulfides by X-ray diffraction, a mixture of realgar and alacranite was resulted and it was noticed that the mineral was identical to synthetic β-As4S4 supposed that the original chemical formula of alacranite (As8S9) was incorrect. They argued that it is identical to alacranite because of the similarity of the physical properties and the unit-cell dimensions but further studies argue that it is different with respect to chemical formula and unit-cell volume. [...] The chemistry of the average of four analyses in Uzon caldera, Russia corresponding to alacranite results in 67.35% arsenic and 32.61% sulfur resulting in a total of 99.96%, yielding the formula As7.98S9.02, ideally As8S9.|$|E

40|$|Amino acids play a {{vital role}} as the {{building}} blocks of proteins and their arrangement in the polypeptide chain controls protein structure and folding. These systems have been extensively investigated by NMR using 13 C and 15 N as the probe nuclei. Unfortunately, due to the low natural abundances of the probe nuclei (especially of 15 N), costly isotopic labelling is often necessary to obtain high quality spectra. Nitrogen has two NMR active nuclei (14 N and 15 N), the former is 99. 63 % naturally abundant and perhaps may have use as an alternative probe nucleus, despite difficulties associated with 14 N NMR. Nitrogen- 14 is an integer-spin nucleus (I = 1) with a non-zero electric quadrupole moment (eQ = 20. 44 mb) and a low gyromagnetic ratio (γ = 1. 93 × 107 rad T− 1 s− 1) [1]. Due to the quadrupolar nature of this nucleus, it couples to the surrounding electric field gradient (EFG), which is dependent upon the local ground state electronic environment.

40|$|One of {{the limits}} of {{quantitative}} phase analysis of natural clays using the Rietveld method is the lack of an applicable structure model for the highly disordered phases such as montmorillonite.

Since DIFFaX is bases upon a recursive method and produces a statistical crystal, a super-cell composed of n layers describing the average disordered structure was re-defined {{to be used in the}} codes which apply the deterministic Rietveld algorithm. Therefore, a working structure composed of 4 layers (an ideal layer, a b/ 3 shifted layer, a -b/ 3 shifted layer, and a -a/ 3 shifted layer) was described and used in GSAS [3] to fit a natural international standard of Ca-montmorillonite...|$|R
