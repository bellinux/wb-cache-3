50|$|<b>Precommitment</b> is a {{strategy}} in which a party to a conflict uses a commitment device to strengthen its position by cutting off some of its options to make its threats more credible. Any party employing a Strategy of Deterrence faces the problem that retaliating against an attack may ultimately result in significant damage to their own side. If this damage is significant enough, then the opponent may take the view that such retaliation would be irrational, and therefore, that the threat lacks credibility, and hence, it ceases {{to be an effective}} deterrent. <b>Precommitment</b> improves the credibility of a threat, either by imposing significant penalties on the threatening party for not following through, or, by making it impossible to not respond.|$|E
40|$|In {{this article}} we present {{a model of a}} market which is ex post contestable. We show that in a market {{characterized}} by uncertainty a firm will face a tradeoff between efficiency and flexibility and generally will make some <b>precommitments</b> to take advantage of ex ante technologies. We show that in the face of potential entry the incumbent will increase his <b>precommitments</b> and in so doing will affect the probability of entry. The degree of market contestability is therefore endogenously determined by the choice of <b>precommitments.</b> The extent to which <b>precommitments</b> will be used to affect entry probabilities is shown to depend on the efficiency of ex ante production, adjustment costs, and the degree of uncertainty. In particular, we show that the market becomes "more contestable" as the relative efficiency of ex post production increases and as market conditions become more uncertain. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} entry deterrence in a duopoly {{where the}} postentry game is Stackelberg. It is argued that, in reality, firms {{can use a}} broader range of <b>precommitments</b> than is allowed for in the literature. This paper permits such <b>precommitments</b> and analyzes the perfect equilibria. It also allows for the fact that there may be fixed costs associated not only with entry, but with beginning production. Several interesting possibilities are explained, including the existence of excess capacity and the holding of inventories {{even in the absence of}} any uncertainty.

40|$|We {{study how}} the {{underwriting}} decision of an equity rights offering {{is affected by}} the risk of offering failure. Firms can reduce failure risk by getting underwriting or by self-insuring through subscription price discounts and subscription <b>precommitments.</b> Self-insurance is generally regarded to be relatively costless, but we provide evidence from Singapore that is consistent with the existence of implicit costs. In particular, the existence of self-insurance costs implies that firms with better projects will have larger discounts and that firms with higher ownership concentration will have more <b>precommitments.</b> Hence, our results support costly self-insurance against issue failure as a factor in explaining the rights issue paradox...|$|R
5000|$|Finally, Logue {{defines the}} {{relationship}} between responses and outcomes as outcome contingencies. [...] Outcome contingencies also impact the degree of self-control that a person exercises. For instance, {{if a person is}} able to change his choice after the initial choice is made, the person is far more likely to take the impulsive, rather than self-controlled, choice. Additionally, it is possible for people to make <b>precommitment</b> action. A <b>precommitment</b> action is an action meant to lead to a self-controlled action at a later period in time. When a person sets an alarm clock, they are making a precommitted response to wake up early in the morning. Hence, that person is more likely to exercise the self-controlled decision to wake up, rather than to fall back in bed for a little more sleep.|$|E

40|$|The nation-state’s {{struggle}} with liberal individualism {{on the one}} hand and the recognition of group rights on the other is well documented in the literatures on constitutionalism, constitution-making, comparative politics and racial/ethnic relations. However, the manner in which this conundrum manifests in a state’s acceptance or rejection of affirmative action has been under-discussed. Traditional approaches to the study of affirmative action are inadequate because they tend to circumscribe the universe of policies and programs that may qualify as affirmative action by focusing only on certain groups, issue domains or countries. More specifically, current scholarship on affirmative action suffers from several substantive and methodological shortcomings: (1) a neglect of the constitutional foundations of affirmative action, (2) a fundamental definitional uncertainty when it comes to understanding what affirmative action actually is, (3) a lack of a clear analytical framework with which to classify various types of affirmative action policies, (4) a narrow focus on single-case studies, and (5) a paucity of inter-group and intra-group comparisons. To address these lacunae, this study focuses on constitutional <b>precommitments</b> to affirmative action. Prior to any substantive analysis, this study first proposes a consensus definition of affirmative action and develops a universal typology and sub-typology with which to categorize, analyze and compare affirmative action <b>precommitments.</b> Next, this study employs a large N comparative methodology to examine the constitutions of 30 countries and categorize affirmative action <b>precommitments</b> through the use of constitutional textual analysis and secondary source historical materials. Finally, this study compares affirmative action <b>precommitments</b> – both inter-group and intra-group – for racial/ethnic minorities and women across the sample. There are three principal substantive findings. First, although liberal individualism remains central to the constitution-making process, all cases exhibited constitutional acknowledgement of some form of group rights and/or preferences. Second, for various reasons, racial/ethnic minorities tend to fare better than women when it comes to the overall prevalence of preferential constitutional <b>precommitments.</b> Third, historical evidence suggests that both endogenous and exogenous political pressures, such as internal ethnic conflicts and global human rights movements, matter when it comes to racial/ethnic minorities’ or women’s chances of having affirmative action provisions included in constitutions during the constitution-making process. ...|$|R
40|$|Contemporary Hobbesian contractarianism {{began in}} the wake of John Rawls' {{revitalization}} of contractarianism in A Theory of Justice and the subsequent body of critical literature which has grown up around it. Philosophers have been impressed with Rawls' powerful application of a contractarian framework to traditional issues in moral and political philosophy but dismayed at the extensive normative <b>precommitments</b> of his particular contractarian theory. They have thus sought an equally powerful contractarian approach unwed to strong normative <b>precommitments.</b> Of all extant contractarian theories, Thomas Hobbes' theory in Leviathan uniquely constitutes such an approach. Like all contractarians, Hobbes specifies a hypothetical choice problem consisting of a choice environment, a choice problem, and a method of resolution. But Hobbes' choice environment purports to make virtually no substantive normative <b>precommitments.</b> The strength of Hobbesian contractarianism is that it seeks to generate substantive normative conclusions from premises established in a normatively minimalistic theoretical framework, and thus promises not to beg any fundamental normative questions. This dissertation considers in detail three comprehensive and game-theoretically sophisticated books which are central to the current corpus of contemporary Hobbesian contractarianism. These are Jean Hampton's Hobbes and the Social Contract Tradition, Gregory Kavka's Hobbesian Moral and Political Theory, and David Gauthier's Morals by Agreement. We explain the common denominators and points of divergence among these theories while undertaking an extensive critical investigation of each. Two fundamental themes emerge from these investigations. First, Hobbesian contractarianism tends to run afoul of collective action problems at various levels of its overall argument. Collective actions problems arise when the requirements of individual and collective rationality diverge. Second, the normative minimalism which is heralded as the primary virtue of Hobbesian contractarianism is also revealed as one of its fundamental problems. By minimalizing its normative <b>precommitments,</b> Hobbesian contractarianism undermines its ultimate goal of generating powerful normative conclusions...|$|R

5000|$|In various {{economic}} {{papers and}} in the book Passions Within Reason, he discusses the idea that emotions have important roles in decision making and personal interactions, even when {{they seem to be}} irrational. For example, the emotions of love give more value to long term romantic commitment. A [...] "rational" [...] person would dump his partner as soon as he found a better partnership. Emotional attachment gives more long term meaning to the relationship. Put poetically: [...] "Those sensible about love are incapable of it." [...] Similarly, anger {{can be used as a}} <b>precommitment</b> device. Frank states that envy can be useful in that it enforces more fair distributions. By acting [...] "irrationally" [...] when treated unfairly, a person can obtain better results in situations which resemble the ultimatum game if their opponent anticipates their emotional response and adjusts their strategy accordingly.|$|E
5000|$|Scheinkman {{is perhaps}} most closely {{associated}} with his classic six page paper from 1979 with L. M. Benveniste [...] "On the Differentiability of the Value Function in Dynamic Models of Economics", which provides conditions on model primitives allowing for the standard differentiable treatment of infinite-horizon dynamic models. [...] At least as influential, however, is his very different work with David Kreps in 1983 showing that [...] "Quantity <b>precommitment</b> and Bertrand competition yield Cournot outcomes" [...] and thus providing the canonical modern foundation of Cournot equilibrium {{as the result of}} capacity pre-commitments. [...] Building on his interest in the intersection between economics and physics, he helped draw out and test some of the most salient implication of the theory of social interactions, in a series of papers with his star student Edward Glaeser (among others), for [...] "Growth in Cities" [...] (1992), crime (1996) and [...] "Measuring Trust" [...] (2000). Perhaps one of the best loved of Scheinkman's papers is his work with Kevin Murphy and Sherwin Rosen on [...] "Cattle Cycles" [...] (1994), which provides one of the sharpest applications of natural economic theory to explain cyclical variations.|$|E
50|$|Ulysses and the Sirens is a 1909 oil {{painting}} by Herbert James Draper measuring 69.25 x 84 in. It is {{held at the}} Ferens Art Gallery in Kingston upon Hull, England. The gallery purchased the painting from Draper in 1910 for £600. Draper also painted a reduced replica that is housed at the Leeds Art Gallery. The subject of the painting is an episode in the epic poem Odyssey by Homer in which Ulysses is tormented by the voices of Sirens, although {{there are only two}} Sirens in Homer's poem and they stay in a meadow. The painting depicts Ulysses tied to the mast and forcibly attendant to the Sirens' seductions. Although the Sirens were depicted in ancient Greek art as scary, ugly creatures, Draper maintains the spirit but not the content of the story by transferring the Sirens' seductiveness from their song to a visible form, depicting the Sirens as beautiful mermaids who invade Ulysses' ship. The Sirens are nude and their tails disappear as they board the ship. Draper's conflation of Sirens with mermaids and his sexualization of these figures are consistent with other artwork of the Victorian and Edwardian eras. Norwegian social theorist Jon Elster used the name of Draper's painting as the title for his 1979 book about rationality and <b>precommitment.</b>|$|E
40|$|One {{major problem}} with moral {{discourse}} {{is that we}} tend treat moral utterances as if they represent propositions. But complex metaphysical problems arise {{when we try to}} describe the nature of the moral facts that correspond to these propositions. If moral facts do not exist, how can moralizers justify engagement in moral practice? One possibility is abolitionism; abandoning morality and growing out of our old habits. Another option that has been suggested is that morality be preserved as a useful fiction. Moral fictionalists propose that moralizers come to understand their moral beliefs as fictive <b>precommitments</b> that are instrumentally valuable. In this essay, I argue that this type of instrumentalist justification does not allow moralizers to have genuinely moral reasons for acting in accordance with their <b>precommitments.</b> The legislative function of morality and the concept of moral personhood cannot be supported by metaethical theories that only provide instrumental reasons for adopting moral discourse. Ironically, this implies that an instrumentalist moral society {{would not be able to}} preserve as many useful moral concepts as would a non-instrumentalist moral society. Since the fictionalists’ own criterion demands that they endorse the most instrumentally valuable metaethical theory, they cannot persuasively argue that their own metaethical alternative is viable. Fictionalists should, I argue, prefer a non-instrumentalist theory that preserves more of the functions of moral discourse, such as quasi-realism. The argumentative strategy employed by fictionalists is therefore self-undermining...|$|R

40|$|Natural-rate models {{suggest that}} the {{systematic}} parts of monetary policy will not have important consequences for the business cycle. Nevertheless, we often observe high and variable rates of monetary growth, and a tendency for monetary authorities to pursue countercyclical policies. This behavior is shown {{to be consistent with}} a rational expectations equilibrium in a discretionary environment where the policymaker pursues a "reasonable" objective, but where <b>precommitments</b> on monetary growth are precluded. At each point in time, the policymaker optimizes subject to given inflationary expectations, which determine a Phillips Curve-type tradeoff between monetary growth/inflation and unemployment. Inflationary expectations are formed with the knowledge that policymakers will be in this situation. Accordingly, equilibrium excludes systematic deviations between actual and expected inflation, which means that the equilibrium unemployment rate ends up independent of "policy" in our model. However, the equilibrium rates of monetary growth/inflation depend on various parameters, including the slope of the Phillips Curve, the costs attached to unemployment versus inflation, and the level of the natural unemployment rate. The monetary authority determines an average inflation rate that is "excessive," and also tends to behave countercyclically. Outcomes are shown to improve if a costlessly operating rule is implemented in order to precomrnit future policy choices in the appropriate manner. The value of these <b>precommitments</b> [...] that is, of long-term agreements {{between the government and the}} private sector [...] underlies the argument for rules over discretion. Discretion is the sub-set of rules that provides no guarantees about the government's future behavior. ...|$|R
40|$|Humans {{can resist}} temptations by exerting willpower, the effortful {{inhibition}} of impulses. But willpower can be disrupted by emotions and depleted over time. Luckily, humans can deploy alternative self-control strategies like <b>precommitment,</b> the voluntary restriction {{of access to}} temptations. Here, we examined the neural mechanisms of willpower and <b>precommitment</b> using fMRI. Behaviorally, <b>precommitment</b> facilitated choices for large delayed rewards, relative to willpower, especially in more impulsive individuals. While willpower was associated with activation in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), posterior parietal cortex (PPC), and inferior frontal gyrus, <b>precommitment</b> engaged lateral frontopolar cortex (LFPC). During <b>precommitment,</b> LFPC showed increased functional connectivity with DLPFC and PPC, especially in more impulsive individuals, {{and the relationship between}} impulsivity and LFPC connectivity was mediated by value-related activation in ventromedial PFC.

40|$|Background and aims: <b>Precommitment</b> {{refers to}} the ability to prospectively {{restrict}} the access to temptations. This study examined whether risk-taking during gambling is decreased when an individual has the opportunity to precommit to his forthcoming bet. Methods: Sixty individuals participated in a gambling task that consisted of direct choice (simply chose one monetary option among four available ones, ranging from low-risk to high-risk options) or <b>precommitment</b> trials (before choosing an amount, participants had the opportunity to make a binding choice that made high-risk options unavailable). Results: We found that participants utilized the <b>precommitment</b> option, such that risk-taking was decreased on <b>precommitment</b> trials compared to direct choices. Within the <b>precommitment</b> trials, {{there was no significant difference}} in risk-taking following decisions to restrict versus non-restrict. Discussion: These findings suggest that the opportunity to precommit may be sufficient to reduce the attractiveness of risk. Conclusions: Present results might be exploited to create interventions aiming at enhancing one's ability to anticipate self-control failures while gambling.

40|$|Different market {{settings}} are considered {{in a free}} trade environment, where firms can choose technology, quality, and price or quantity. The shape of competition in prices requires the intervention of governments, via a common antidumping policy, to make firms converge on the simultaneous equilibrium which is socially optimal. In the Cournot framework, the equilibria we obtain impinge upon the kind of <b>precommitments</b> undertaken by firms. The coincidence between firms' behaviour and social preference obtains either when competition is tough, since income is low, or when firms must compete in quantities in the market stage, since they cannot modify qualities.

40|$|Rationality is an {{important}} concept in Artificial Intelligence and Philosophy. When artificial systems {{are considered to be}} intelligent or autonomous, it is almost obligatory to attribute intentions and beliefs to them. The currently dominant view of intentions sees them as involving commitments {{on the part of the}} agents who have them. But the notion of commitment seems to clash with the notion of rationality. It is argued that this need not be so. Commitments are only appropriate for agents with a limited capacity to reason. A treatment of commitment has been previously proposed that reconciles them with rationality. Here further motivations for the commitments of limited agents are discussed. This analysis is extended to account for the so-called <b>precommitments,</b> which have been excluded by others as introducing too much complexity...|$|R

40|$|A {{classical}} equilibrium {{model is}} analysed of two interdependent monetary economies {{in which it}} is assumed that cash is the only asset, and which is characterized by perfect foresight, flexible exchange rates and imperfect substitution between home and foreign goods. The first-best optimum sets the marginal rate of substitution between private and public goods to unity and leads to no tax distortions and the optimal quantity of money. Both non-cooperative and cooperative market-oriented outcomes are time-inconsistent, since each government has an incentive to renege and levy a surprise inflation tax. International policy coordination without <b>precommitment</b> can be counterproductive even though there are no tax distortions and the provision of public goods is optimal, since it exacerbates the credibility problems perceived by the private sectors and therefore leads to excessive inflation and too low a level of real money balances. The reason is that a unilateral surprise inflation tax induces a real depreciation and leads to inflation costs, but a multilateral expansion of monetary growth does not. The typical ranking in order of decreasing welfare is first-best optimum, cooperation with <b>precommitment,</b> competition with <b>precommitment,</b> competition without <b>precommitment</b> and coordination without <b>precommitment.</b> Exchange Rates; Inflation Tax; Policy Coordination; Precommitment; Time Consistency...|$|E
40|$|It {{is argued}} that trigger {{mechanisms}} cannot support reputation if voters are atomistic and have access to good information about party preferences. Therefore the choice for a party lies between <b>precommitment,</b> enforced by penalties, and discretion. The paper uses a model of Labor and Conservative preferences derived from Minford and Peel (1982) and estimates the difference of policies and outcomes for each party over an electoral period. Under discretion inflation is 10 - 30 per cent higher than under <b>precommitment</b> and unemployment is temporarily and modestly lower; under <b>precommitment</b> inflation is negligible (Labour is only slightly more inflationary in this case). Higher levels of welfare are achieved under both parties with <b>precommitment</b> but the penalties {{would have to be}} greater under Labour to support this strategy. The paper therefore suggests that rational policy should never have been discretionary in practice; episodes of apparent discretion may therefore have simply represented mistakes in attempted <b>precommitment.</b> An implication of modelling government preferences explicitly (appendix) is that the Lucas critique has little scope over policy change, since agents are fully aware of these preferences.

40|$|The {{players in}} most {{economically}} important games are agents, not principals. This {{raises the possibility}} of the principal's setting a strategic compensation scheme. The central question addressed here is whether unobservable agency contracts can serve as <b>precommitments.</b> I argue that, in terms of Nash equilibrium outcomes, the answer is no when it is common knowledge that there exists a contract that "solves" the standard agency problems and that the principal and agent have the same preferences over income and effort. However, I also show that when these conditions are not satisfied (as they typically will not be), provisions of the agency contract enacted solely to deal with incentive and risk sharing problems of the agency relationship may have the secondary effect of credibly precommitting the agent in the game he plays with other agents. I also briefly consider the effects of contract renegotiation. ...|$|R
40|$|Rationality is {{a useful}} metaphor for {{understanding}} autonomous, intelligent agents. A persuasive view of intelligent agents uses cognitive primitives such as intentions and beliefs to describe, explain, and specify their behavior. These primitives are often associated with a notion of commitment that is internal to the given agent. However, at first sight, there is a tension between commitments and rationality. We show how the two concepts can be reconciled for the important and interesting case of limited, intelligent agents. We show how our approach extends to handle more subtle issues such as <b>precommitments,</b> which have previously been assumed to be conceptually too complex. We close with a proposal to develop conative policies {{as a means to}} represent commitments in a generic, declarative manner. 1 Introduction How can limited agents cope with a complex world?

40|$|This paper {{takes an}} {{economic}} approach to derive an evolutionary learning model based {{entirely on the}} endogenous employment of genetic operators {{in the service of}} self-interested autonomous agents. Reproductive decisions depend on subjective tradeoffs between {{the quality and quantity of}} offspring, avoiding the imposition of an external fitness function as typically used in genetic algorithms in favor of evolving, heterogeneous preferences over reproductive outcomes, expressed via reaction functions. When combined with a density-dependent economic or ecological problem, the implicit fitness approach draws a very different picture of “fitness ” than other evolutionary algorithms. An application to learning in a repeated Cournot oligopoly game is developed analytically, predictions tested against a computational simulation. The result is an evolutionarily stable asymmetric equilibrium of much greater average profitability than concentrated Cournot-Nash collusion, while supporting a much larger population of heterogeneous competitors. Implicit-fitness maximizers learn to collude not with their competitors but with their immediate ancestors and descendents to overcome short-run myopia with <b>precommitments</b> through intergenerational wealth transfers...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{functions}} of transfer pricing is the optimal coordination of internal trade between responsibility centers in decentralized firms. According to standard theory the efficient level of internal trade is achieved by marginal cost pricing. If one of the firm's profit centers faces duopolistic competition on the final product market, the firm's headquarters can gain a strategic advantage when it systematically distorts the transfer price. Because headquarters cannot credibly commit to the equilibrium strategy that is induced by transfer pricing, the market outcome achieved by strategic transfer pricing cannot be replicated by centralized decision making. Since unobservable contracts cannot serve as credible <b>precommitments</b> unless they are employed for other than strategic reasons, {{the applicability of the}} basic concept is limited to observable transfer prices.

40|$|Anti-entrenchment rules prevent governments {{from passing}} unrepeatable {{legislation}} {{and ensure that}} subsequent governments are free to revisit the policy choices of the past.

This Article develops a typology of mechanisms for public entrenchment through private law and private rights, as well as core anti-entrenchment protections embedded in the law. It then develops a framework for evaluating entrenchment concerns, comparing the costs of decreased flexibility against the benefits of increased reliance.
