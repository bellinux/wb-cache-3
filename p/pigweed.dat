5|$|Mesa Verdeans {{supplemented}} {{their diet}} by gathering {{the seeds and}} fruits of wild plants, searching large expanses of land while procuring these resources. Depending on the season, they collected piñon nuts and juniper berries, weedy goosefoot, <b>pigweed,</b> purslane, tomatillo, tansy mustard, globe mallow, sunflower seeds, and yucca, as well as various species of grass and cacti. Prickly pear fruits provided a rare source of natural sugar. Wild seeds were cooked and ground up into porridge. They used sagebrush and mountain mahogany, along with piñon and juniper, for firewood. They also smoked wild tobacco. Because the Ancestral Puebloans considered all material consumed and discarded by their communities as sacred, their midden piles were viewed with reverence. Starting during the Basketmaker III period, , Mesa Verdeans often buried their dead in these mounds.|$|E
5|$|Ailanthus {{produces}} an allelopathic chemical called ailanthone, which inhibits {{the growth of}} other plants. The inhibitors are strongest in the bark and roots, but are also present in the leaves, wood and seeds of the plant. One study showed that a crude extract of the root bark inhibited 50% of a sample of garden cress (Lepidium sativum) seeds from germinating. The same study tested the extract as an herbicide on garden cress, redroot <b>pigweed</b> (Amaranthus retroflexus), velvetleaf (Abutilon theophrasti), yellow bristlegrass (Setaria pumila), barnyard grass (Echinochloa crusgalli), pea (Pisum sativum cv. Sugar Snap) and maize (Zea mays cv. Silver Queen). It proved able to kill nearly 100% of seedlings {{with the exception of}} velvetleaf, which showed some resistance. Another experiment showed a water extract of the chemical was either lethal or highly damaging to 11 North American hardwoods and 34 conifers, with the white ash (Fraxinus americana) being the only plant not adversely affected. The chemical does not, however, affect the tree of heaven's own seedlings, indicating that A. altissima has a defence mechanism to prevent autotoxicity. Resistance in various plant species has been shown to increase with exposure. Populations without prior exposure to the chemicals are most susceptible to them. Seeds produced from exposed plants have also been shown to be more resistant than their unexposed counterparts.|$|E

2500|$|The {{introduction}} of pottery, its widespread use, {{and the increased}} sophistication of its forms and decoration, first believed to have occurred around 1,000 BCE, is a major demarcation of the Woodland era. Archaic pots were thick, heavy, and fragile, but Woodland pottery pots were more intricately designed, and had more uses, such as for cooking and storing surplus food. Woodland peoples also used baskets and gourds for containers too. Around 200BCE, maize production migrated to the eastern United States from Mexico. The {{introduction of}} corn is when Kentucky natives slowly changed from growing indigenous plants to a maize based agricultural economy. In addition to cultivating corn, the Woodland people also cultivated giant ragweeds, amaranth (<b>pigweed),</b> and maygrass. The initial four plants {{known to have been}} domesticated were goosefoot (Chenopodium berlandieri), sunflower (Helianthus annuus var. macroscarpus), marshelder (Iva annua var. macrocarpa), and squash (Cucurbita pepo ssp. ovifera) (gourds). Woodland people raised tobacco in their gardens which they used for smoking. Woodland people still used ground stone tools, especially for processing nuts and seeds. They mined both Mammoth Cave and Salts Cave for gypsum and mirabilite, a salty seasoning. Shellfish was still an important part of their diets, and the most common prey was white-tailed deer. Spears also continued to be made, but late in the Woodland era, the straight bow became the typical weapon of choice in the eastern United States, which is illustrated by the reduction in size of arrowheads. In addition to bows and arrows, some southeastern Woodland peoples also used blowguns. Between 100 BCE and 450BC, the native Americans in Kentucky begin to build burial mounds, which indicates social change. The Woodland Indians buried their dead in conical, and then later flat, or oval-shaped, burial mounds, which were often [...] high (like Serpent Mound). This practice resulted in the Woodland people being called the Mound Builders by 19th-century observers.|$|E

40|$|<b>Pigweeds</b> (Amaranthus spp.) are of {{economic}} importance worldwide. In Europe, Amaranthus retroflexus {{is one of}} the ten weed species of greatest economic importance. It is a serious problem weed in several field crops (e. g. maize), as well as in vegetables, orchards and grape vines. It is an annual spreading by seeds which have a long viability and are dispersed principally by wind and water, but also by machinery. There is great variability in seed germination which renders control with post-emergence herbicides difficult. In addition, triazine herbicide-resistant populations occur in ten European countries. The aim of this subproject of COST action 816 is to investigate the possibilities of classical and inundative biological control of Amaranthus spp. to characterize potential biological control agents and to develop methods for their integration with current phytosanitary measures in the target crops. The project was initiated with an extended literature survey followed by field surveys for insects and pathogens associated with Amaranthus spp. in several European countries. Promising isolates of fungal pathogens have been tested on detached leaves and whole plants, and initial studies on the application of pathogens causing damping off in seedlings have been made. Further, the variability of different provenances of Amaranthus spp. in response to fungal attack has been investigated. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|The potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) is {{the most}} {{important}} dicotyledonous source of hu- man food. It ranks fifth major food crop of the world, exceed only by the grasses such as wheat, rice, maize, and barley. It is characte- ristically a crop of the cool, temperate regions or of elevation of approximately 2000 m or more in the tropics. It requires cool nights and well drained soil with adequate moisture and does not produce well in low altitude, warm, tropical environment. Com-mercial production of most potatoes is primarily through vegetative propagation by means of lateral buds formed on the tuber, a modified stem. Trough such vegetative propagation, many diseases are transmitted from generation to generation. Suppression of such diseases and reduction of yield losses due to disease are a necessary part of increasing the food supply. The principles, strategies, and tactics of plant disease management are important to preven-ting yield losses. Integrated pest management (IPM) may supply effective control of the potato pests including aphids (vector of some viruses), Verticillium wilt blackleg, bacterial ring rot, Rhizoctonia, Phytophthora infestans (late blight) and several weeds (night shades, <b>pigweeds,</b> lambs quarters, and annual grasses).

The objective of this research was to evaluate the competitive ability of five weed species of the Amaranthus L. genus (A. deflexus, A. hybridus, A. retroflexus, A. spinosus and A. viridis) with dry bean plants (Phaseolus vulgaris L. - 'Carioca Precoce' cultivar), using the replacement series design. A fixed total density equivalent to 80 plants m- 2 was used in pots of 2. 8 L capacity varying the proportions between the species in coexistence. To install the experiment, Amaranthus seedlings were transplanted to the pots at the phenological stage of completely expanded cotyledon leaves, while the crop was seeded. A factorial scheme (5 x 5) was used to carry out the experiment, consisting of five species of Amaranthus (<b>pigweeds)</b> and five species proportions (beans:pigweeds) : 4 : 0, 3 : 1, 2 : 2, 1 : 3 and 0 : 4.
