5|$|John Calvin was {{influenced}} by Martin Luther's idea of baptism as God's <b>promises</b> to the baptized person attached to the outward sign of washing with water. Calvin maintained Zwingli's idea of baptism as a public pledge, but insisted that it was secondary to baptism's meaning {{as a sign of}} God's promise to forgive sin. He maintained that sacraments were effective instruments in bringing about the <b>promises</b> they represent, however he also maintained that the <b>promises</b> could be refused by the baptized, and would have no effect in that case. Calvin carefully distinguished between the outward sign of the washing of water with the <b>promises</b> that baptism signifies while maintaining that they were inseparable. Calvin's baptismal theology is very similar to that of Luther. It differs in the way Calvin subordinated sacraments to the preaching of the word of God. While Luther placed preaching and sacraments on the same level, Calvin saw sacraments as confirmation which is added to the preaching of the word of God.|$|E

40|$|<b>Promise</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{powerful}} tools producing trust and facilitating cooperation, and sticking to the <b>promise</b> is deemed as a key social norm in social interactions. The present study explored the extent to which <b>promise</b> would influence investors' decision-making in the trust game where <b>promise</b> had no predictive value regarding trustees' reciprocation. In addition, we examined the neural underpinnings of the investors' outcome processing related to the trustees' <b>promise</b> keeping and <b>promise</b> breaking. Consistent with our hypothesis, behavioral results indicated that <b>promise</b> could effectively increase the investment frequency of investors. Electrophysiological results showed that, <b>promise</b> induced larger differentiated-FRN responses to the reward and non-reward discrepancy. Taken together, these results suggested that <b>promise</b> would promote cooperative behavior, while breach of <b>promise</b> would be regarded as a violation of the social norm, corroborating the vital role of non-enforceable commitment in social decision making...|$|R

Throughout the 1920s, Du Bois and the NAACP shifted support {{back and forth between}} the Republican Party and the Democratic Party, induced by <b>promises</b> from the candidates to fight lynchings, improve working conditions, or support voting rights in the South; invariably, the candidates failed to deliver on their <b>promises.</b>|$|E

5|$|Early Reformed theologians such as John Calvin and Huldrych Zwingli {{rejected}} the medieval belief in transubstantiation, that {{the bread and}} wine of the Eucharist change into Christ's body and blood, but taught that Christ's person, including his body and blood, are presented to Christians who partake of it in faith. They also disagree with Martin Luther and the Lutheran tradition which taught that Christ's body is physically eaten with the mouth in the sacrament. Later Reformed orthodox theologians continued to teach views {{similar to that of}} Calvin and Zwingli. In the modern period, Karl Barth espoused a symbolic view that the sacrament only communicates God's <b>promises</b> rather than functioning to actually confer these <b>promises.</b> Other Reformed theologians continued to teach the traditional view.|$|E
40|$|SummaryPromises {{are one of}} {{the oldest}} human-specific {{psychological}} mechanisms fostering cooperation and trust. Here, we study the neural underpinnings of <b>promise</b> keeping and <b>promise</b> breaking. Subjects first make a <b>promise</b> decision (<b>promise</b> stage), then they anticipate whether the <b>promise</b> affects the interaction partner's decision (anticipation stage) and are subsequently free to keep or break the <b>promise</b> (decision stage). Findings revealed that the breaking of the <b>promise</b> is associated with increased activation in the DLPFC, ACC, and amygdala, suggesting that the dishonest act involves an emotional conflict due to the suppression of the honest response. Moreover, the breach of the <b>promise</b> can be predicted by a perfidious brain activity pattern (anterior insula, ACC, inferior frontal gyrus) during the <b>promise</b> and anticipation stage, indicating that brain measurements may reveal malevolent intentions before dishonest or deceitful acts are actually committed...|$|R

5|$|In Reformed theology, sacraments {{are held}} to be, along with the word of God preached, the means of grace. In the sacraments, God graciously condescends to use common {{material}} objects to communicate divine <b>promises</b> to people. The grace promised consists not only in benefits which God bestows on people, but Christ's person himself, to whom God unites the believer. Sacraments confirm or ratify the <b>promises</b> communicated in preaching. Both preaching and the sacraments are not merely symbolic and representative of the reality to which they refer, but actually create the reality of saving grace. The sacraments are made efficacious by the Holy Spirit in actually bringing into effect the <b>promises</b> signified in the sacraments. This efficacy is only beneficial, however, {{for those who have}} faith. The sacrament remains efficacious regardless of the recipient's response. Its effect is negative, resulting in judgement, for the faithless; while it confers Christ and his benefits for the faithful.|$|E

Kania made <b>promises</b> of the sort that Gomułka and Gierek had made when each came power. But whatever goodwill the new leader gained, it lasted for an even shorter period than it had been the case in 1956 and 1971, because there was no way that the regime could have kept the <b>promises</b> it had made at Gdańsk, even if it wanted to. The authorities were still trapped by the contradiction: if they followed economic necessity, they would generate political instability. GNP fell in 1979 by 2%, in 1980 by 8% and in 1981 by 15–20%.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{provides}} {{a unique perspective}} to the milk market relative to previous studies. While there is rich literature on the various sectors of the milk market, a contribution to this literature was made by providing a specific econometric analysis of the <b>Promised</b> Land brand. Previous work conducted by Capps and Salin (2010) provided the foundation for this thesis. The purpose of this thesis was threefold: 1. Estimate household demand functions for <b>Promised</b> Land white and chocolate milk using Nielsen homescan data. The demand functions were estimated using a tobit model to estimate the conditional and unconditional own-price and cross-price effects of <b>Promised</b> Land white and chocolate milk. 2. Assess the impacts of household demographic drivers of demand for <b>Promised</b> Land white and chocolate milk. 3. Use the empirical results derived from the tobit model to identify substitutes and complements of <b>Promised</b> Land white and chocolate milk and provide a profile of households that purchase <b>Promised</b> Land white and chocolate milk. The study concluded that households who purchased <b>Promised</b> Land white were insensitive {{to changes in the}} price of <b>Promised</b> Land white milk. The price of private label milk was the only cross-price that was significant in the quantity of <b>Promised</b> Land white milk purchased. The estimated elasticities showed that <b>Promised</b> Land white milk and private label white milk were substitutes. From the estimated elasticities, it was found that households that purchased <b>Promised</b> Land chocolate milk were largely insensitive to changes in the price of <b>Promised</b> Land chocolate milk. It was also found that the prices of Nesquick, Oak Farms, and private label chocolate milk had a significant effect on the quantity of <b>Promised</b> Land chocolate milk purchased. Of these significant prices, private label and Oak Farms chocolate milk were substitutes for <b>Promised</b> Land chocolate milk. The price of Nesquick chocolate milk demonstrated a complementary relationship with <b>Promised</b> Land chocolate milk...|$|R
