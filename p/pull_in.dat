5|$|In {{some areas}} of the world, {{including}} Berlin, Germany, dropping salt is prohibited altogether except on the highest-risk roads; plain sand without any melting agents is spread instead. While this may protect the environment, it is more labour-intensive, as more gritting runs are needed; because the sand is insoluble, it tends to accumulate at the sides of the road, making it more difficult for buses to <b>pull</b> <b>in</b> at bus stops.|$|E
5|$|The {{equivalence}} between gravitational and {{inertial effects}} {{does not constitute}} a complete theory of gravity. When it comes to explaining gravity near our own location on the Earth's surface, noting that our reference frame is not in free fall, so that fictitious forces are to be expected, provides a suitable explanation. But a freely falling reference frame {{on one side of}} the Earth cannot explain why the people on the opposite side of the Earth experience a gravitational <b>pull</b> <b>in</b> the opposite direction.|$|E
5|$|In 1576, Elizabeth I {{granted the}} castles of Brownsea and Corfe for life to Sir Christopher Hatton, {{making him the}} Admiral of Purbeck. Hatton argued with the town of Poole, {{claiming}} {{that he had the}} right to search and inspect ships going into Poole Harbour, as well as the rights to the revenues from the local ferry service; he lost his legal case around the ferrying rights in 1581. In 1589, the Bountiful Gift refused to <b>pull</b> <b>in</b> for inspection, arguing that it had had a valid pass to leave, and Brownsea Castle fired on the vessel, killing two of the crew. The castle's captain, Walter Partridge, was tried and conflicted of manslaughter, but ultimately pardoned. The rest of the island, but not the castle, was leased out to various landowners over the next few years.|$|E

5|$|Opening across 2,602 North American theaters, The Boy Next Door was {{projected}} to <b>pull</b> <b>in</b> $12–15million over its opening weekend. The film earned $5.7million on its opening day, well over its budget. It opened at number {{two at the}} US box office, with an opening weekend gross of $14.9million, {{significantly higher than the}} other new releases for that week. The Hollywood Reporter revealed that 45 percent of the film's opening week audience was Hispanic, while 71 percent of the overall audience was female. The film became Lopez's best opening weekend for a January release, beating her romantic comedy The Wedding Planner (2001) which opened with $13.5million. It was also her best opening weekend for a thriller film, ahead of Angel Eyes (2001, $9.2million), Enough (2002, $14million), and Parker (2013, $7million). Furthermore, it is Lopez's biggest live-action opening since 2005's Monster-in-Law. The Boy Next Door ended its domestic box office run with a total of $35.4million, and has earned another $19.6million in foreign markets, making a total of $55million.|$|E
5|$|Study of Saturn's moons {{has also}} been aided by {{advances}} in telescope instrumentation, primarily the introduction of digital charge-coupled devices which replaced photographic plates. For the entire 20th century, Phoebe stood alone among Saturn's known moons with its highly irregular orbit. Beginning in 2000, however, three dozen additional irregular moons have been discovered using ground-based telescopes. A survey starting in late 2000 and conducted using three medium-size telescopes found thirteen new moons orbiting Saturn at a great distance, in eccentric orbits, which are highly inclined to both the equator of Saturn and the ecliptic. They are probably fragments of larger bodies captured by Saturn's gravitational <b>pull.</b> <b>In</b> 2005, astronomers using the Mauna Kea Observatory announced the discovery of twelve more small outer moons, in 2006, astronomers using the Subaru 8.2m telescope reported the discovery of nine more irregular moons, in , Tarqeq (S/2007 S 1) was announced and in May {{of the same year}} S/2007 S 2 and S/2007 S 3 were reported.|$|E
5|$|Able {{to return}} to Another world, Serge allies with the Acacia Dragoons against Porre and locates that dimension's Dragon Tear, {{allowing}} him {{to return to}} his human form. He then enters the Sea of Eden, Another world's physical equivalent of the Dead Sea, finding a temporal research facility from the distant future called Chronopolis. Lynx and Kid are inside; Serge defeats Lynx and the supercomputer FATE, allowing the six Dragons of El Nido to steal the Frozen Flame and retire to Terra Tower, a massive structure raised from the sea floor. Kid falls into a coma, and Harle bids the party goodbye to fly with the Dragons. Serge regroups his party and tends to Kid, who remains comatose. Continuing his adventure, he obtains and cleanses the corrupted Masamune sword from Chrono Trigger. He then uses the Dragon relics and shards of the Dragon Tears to create the mythic Element Chrono Cross. The spiritual power of the Masamune later allows him to lift Kid from her coma. At Terra Tower, the prophet of time, revealed to be Belthasar from Chrono Trigger, visits him with visions of Crono, Marle, and Lucca. Serge learns that the time research facility Chronopolis created El Nido thousands of years ago after a catastrophic experimental failure drew it to the past. The introduction of a temporally foreign object in history caused the planet to <b>pull</b> <b>in</b> a counterbalance from a different dimension. This was Dinopolis, a city of Dragonians—parallel universe descendants of Chrono Triggers Reptites. The institutions warred and Chronopolis subjugated the Dragonians. Humans captured their chief creation—the Dragon God, an entity capable of controlling nature.|$|E

In many situations, holism and simple underlying signatures <b>pull</b> <b>in</b> different directions.|$|E
