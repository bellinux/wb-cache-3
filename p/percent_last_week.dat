40|$|The {{decrease}} in Anopheles quadrimaculatus prevalence, {{which began in}} late July, continued generally through September. This is shown graphically by the accompanying chart. Drought {{and the advent of}} cooler weather tended to diminish breeding in some of the areas; in others the pooling of streams and the stabilization of pond and lake surfaces have increased the control problem. Entomological reports (M- 7) received during the month show that in a total of 480 or 92 percent of the zones, quadrimaculatus densities were satisfactorily low. This compares with 91 percent in this category during August. The number of satisfactory zones had increased to 94 <b>percent</b> by the <b>last</b> <b>week</b> in September. Inspectional and control work was discontinued in several of the more northerly zones during the month...|$|R

40|$|More {{organizations}} saw growth (43 percent) than declines (33 percent). Combined, two?thirds {{of respondents}} said they saw contributions increase or stay about the same as in 2009. This is an improvement over a year ago at the same time, when 46 percent reported a decline and only 54 percent saw growth or stable contributions levels.    A far larger share in 2010 saw stable amounts of contributions received (24 percent versus 11 <b>percent</b> <b>last</b> year at this time). The shift between 2009 and 2010 is from "decreased" to "about the same".    The results in this wave are an improvement over the November 2010 survey conducted by the Nonprofit Research Collaborative. At that time, 36 percent of responding charities reported an increase and 37 percent reported a decrease {{in the first nine months}} of 2010. This suggests that the "uptick" in giving anticipated in the <b>last</b> <b>weeks</b> of 2010 might have occurred, but nonetheless, the growth in contributions received did not match expectations for the year...|$|R

40|$|Background: To analyse the {{prevalence}} of seizures and use of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in the end-of-life (EOL) phase of patients with high-grade glioma (HGG) and to identify patient characteristics associated with the occurrence of seizures in the <b>last</b> <b>week</b> of life. Methods: Patients were recruited from a cohort of adults with HGG diagnosed in 2005 and 2006 in three tertiary referral centres for patients with brain tumour. Physicians involved in the EOL care of patients who had HGG and had died were asked to fill in a questionnaire regarding seizures and antiepileptic treatment in the last 3 months and in the <b>last</b> <b>week</b> of life. Data on seizures and use of AEDs before the EOL phase were obtained from medical correspondence and hospital medical charts. Results: Out of 155 patients who had died, data for 92 patients were eligible for analysis. Twenty-nine percent of these 92 patients had seizures during the <b>last</b> <b>week</b> of life; 33 % of patients {{had a history of}} seizures and 22 % did not. Besides a history of status epilepticus (p= 0. 047), we identified no other significant risk factors for developing seizures in the <b>last</b> <b>week</b> of life. Seventy percent of all patients used AEDs before the <b>last</b> <b>week</b> of life. In 35 % of patients in whom AEDs were tapered, seizures occurred in the <b>last</b> <b>week</b> of life. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that seizures are a common symptom in patients with HGG during the <b>last</b> <b>week</b> of life and emphasise the importance of adequate AED treatment throughout the EOL phase...|$|R
