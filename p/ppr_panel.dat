40|$|Following {{a request}} from the European Commission, the Panel on Plant Protection Products and their Residues (PPR) was asked to deliver a {{scientific}} opinion on {{the report of the}} FOCUS groundwater working group (FOCUS, 2009) with respect to lower tier leaching assessments. The <b>PPR</b> <b>Panel</b> is of the general opinion that the FOCUS groundwater working group has successfully harmonised major concepts in the leaching models and that, overall, the leaching estimations have improved. Despite several limitations, the <b>PPR</b> <b>Panel</b> considers that the revised FOCUS scenarios cover significant arable areas in the EU, including the New Member States, and allow for decision making at the EU level. The <b>PPR</b> <b>Panel</b> however has observed that flaws in underlying data have become apparent after finalising the report. Also new approaches on scenario selection have become available. The <b>PPR</b> <b>Panel</b> recommends that these flaws and new approaches are taken into account when developing revised scenarios...|$|E
40|$|The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) {{asked the}} Panel on Plant Protection Products and their Residues (<b>PPR</b> <b>Panel)</b> {{to develop a}} Scientific Opinion on the {{relevance}} of dissimilar mode of action and its appropriate application for cumulative risk assessment of pesticides residues in food. The present opinion was preceded by three previous opinions of the <b>PPR</b> <b>Panel</b> (EFSA, 2008, 2009, 2013). The {{purpose of the present}} opinion was to assess the relevance of dissimilar modes of action (MoA) for cumulative risk assessment, to evaluate the existing methods for assessing chemicals acting by dissimilar MoA and to identify which methods need to be considered. The <b>PPR</b> <b>Panel</b> restricted its considerations of pesticide combinations with dissimilar modes of action to substances that produce a common adverse effect on the same organ/system. The <b>PPR</b> <b>Panel</b> noted that there is no case documented in the scientific literature where independent action provided more conservative predictions of combination effects than dose addition, and where at the same time independent action also produced accurate predictions. The use of independent action as an assessment concept for combination effects requires demonstration that modes of action of individual substances in a mixture are strictly independent, a condition that can rarely be met in practice. The <b>PPR</b> <b>Panel</b> also noted that there is no cumulative risk assessment method derived from independent action. The <b>PPR</b> <b>Panel</b> therefore recommends using cumulative risk assessment methods derived from dose addition also for the assessment of mixtures of pesticides with dissimilar modes of action, provided they produce a common adverse outcome. Pesticides that produce common adverse outcomes on the same target organ/system should be grouped together in CAGs, and their combined effects assessed by using the concept of dose addition as a pragmatic and conservative default approach for the purpose of assessing cumulative risk in relation to MRL setting or risk assessment of chemical mixtures in practice...|$|E
40|$|Regulation EC No. 396 / 2005 {{from the}} European Parliament and the Council has {{required}} since September 2008 that cumulative and synergistic effects of pesticides {{be considered when}} Maximum Residue Levels (MRLs) are adopted. On 15 April 2008, the <b>PPR</b> <b>Panel</b> adopted an opinion on the suitability of existing methodologies and proposed a tiered approach for assessment of the cumulative effects of pesticides. As a second stage of its work in this area, the <b>PPR</b> <b>Panel</b> carried out a cumulative risk assessment for triazole fungicides to test the methods that had been proposed. This exercise applied the tiered approach in different scenarios of relevance for risk management in pre- and post-registration conditions, for both acute and chronic cumulative effects. The <b>PPR</b> <b>Panel</b> describes in this opinion progressive steps of refinement in cumulative risk assessment: (i) establishment of a Cumulative Assessment Group (CAG) through a careful analysis of the specific toxicological effects common to triazole pesticides and their underlying biochemical mechanisms, (ii) refinement of the hazard characterisation, using in successive tiers, regulatory reference values, reference values based on the common specific toxicological effects and benchmark dose modelling, and (iii) refinement of the cumulative exposure assessment making use of deterministic and probabilistic methodologies in successive tiers. Based on the lessons learned from this exercise, the <b>PPR</b> <b>Panel</b> proposes a simplification of the overall tiered approach. The CAG should be as refined as the data allo...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Printed Circuit Board (PCB) manufacture involves an electrolytic copper deposition stage for consolidation of conductive circuit paths. Miniaturisation trends requiring increased circuit densities and high aspect ratio through-holes are restricted by the phenomenon of non-uniform copper electrodeposit thickness which can affect electrical impedance properties of the circuitry, cause electrical discontinuity between adjoining circuit layers and inhibit component-lead insertion. This thesis considers means of enhancing the electrodeposition process to alleviate the aforementioned problems. Following {{a comprehensive review of}} process technology, both a novel electrolyte agitation method utilising eductors and a Periodic Pulse Reverse (PPR) current technique were investigated experimentally within a pilot tank containing 350 litres of electrolyte. Eductor agitation was analysed/optimised using high-speed photography and a mass transport mapping technique. Data for agitation configurations were verified by statistical analysis of thickness distributions across high surface-area <b>panels.</b> <b>PPR</b> current was initially studied with a small-scale pulse unit and Assaf Cell throwing power test, followed by pilot tank trials using a full-size pulse rectifier in conjunction with eductor agitation and a proprietary electrolyte containing additives. Through-hole throwing power, deposit morphology and microstructure were investigated under various low-frequency pulse conditions and anodic-to-cathodic current density ratios. Eductor agitation and PPR current were compared against the more widely used air agitation and direct current techniques. The effects of air agitation on electrolyte conductivity and commercially produced PCBs were also considered. Optimum agitation conditions were achieved using eight eductors inclined at 37. 5 ° from the horizontal and spaced equidistantly along longitudinal tank walls. Such conditions decreased the standard deviation of copper thickness measured on high surface area panels and lessened edge-effects. Consistent agitation levels up to ten times greater than static solution were recorded, providing enhanced deposition rates; by comparison, air agitation achieved levels of around seven times in uniform regions. Conductivity data showed good correlation with a theoretical approach; air agitation was found to reduce conductivity in proportion to the voidage fraction of gas bubbles and by 20 - 30...|$|R
40|$|Buprofezin is an {{insecticide}} with a thiadiazine structure. This {{active substance}} was proposed {{for inclusion in}} Annex I of the Directive 91 / 414 /EEC in 2005, but in the Draft Assessment Report (DAR), the Rapporteur Member State (Finland) identified a data gap: “new studies for in vitro and in vivo chromosomal aberration assays were required because the potency to cause chromosomal aberrations was insufficiently studied through the submitted information”. In {{the light of the}} results of the new genotoxicity studies the carcinogenic potential of buprofezin was reassessed by the Pesticide Risk Assessment Peer Review (PRAPeR) expert meeting (EFSA) but a conclusion could not be reached. Therefore the Scientific Panel on Plant Protection Products and their Residues (<b>PPR</b> <b>Panel)</b> of EFSA was asked for an opinion by the PRAPeR Unit on the genotoxic and carcinogenic potential of buprofezin in the context of the human risk assessment. The <b>PPR</b> <b>Panel</b> re-evaluated the long-term toxicity/carcinogenicity studies on buprofezin. Two studies on the carcinogenicity of buprofezin were conducted in mice and rats.

The PPR Unit (Plant Protection Products and their Residues Unit, Risk Assessment Directorate) as well as the Pesticides/PRAPeR Unit (Scientific Cooperation and Assistance Directorate) both works on Plant Protection Products in relation to Directive 91 / 414 EEC. PRAPeR coordinates the Pesticide Risk Assessment Peer Review for the approval of active substances by the European Commission and the Members States, whereas the <b>PPR</b> <b>Panel</b> provides independent scientific opinions and guidance for the Community’s legislation in the field of plant protection products.

This {{scientific}} opinion of the <b>PPR</b> <b>Panel</b> is the second of three requested deliverables within this mandate. The scientific background for the risk assessment on sediment organisms in edge-of-field surface waters is provided, with reference to benthic ecology and ecotoxicology, available test protocols and current knowledge on exposure and effects of sediment-bound plant protection products (PPPs). The scientific opinion provides approaches on how to derive regulatory acceptable concentrations (RACs) for sediment organisms and exposure to active substances of PPPs and transformation products of these substances, and how to link them in a tiered approach to predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) for the sediment compartment.

40|$|In 2013, EFSA {{published}} a comprehensive systematic review of epidemiological studies published from 2006 to 2012 investigating {{the association between}} pesticide exposure and many health outcomes. Despite the considerable amount of epidemiological information available, the quality of much of this evidence was rather low and many limitations likely affect the results so firm conclusions cannot be drawn. Studies that {{do not meet the}} ‘recognised standards’ mentioned in the Regulation (EU) No 1107 / 2009 are thus not suited for risk assessment. In this Scientific Opinion, the EFSA Panel on Plant Protection Products and their residues (<b>PPR</b> <b>Panel)</b> was requested to assess the methodological limitations of pesticide epidemiology studies and found that poor exposure characterisation primarily defined the major limitation. Frequent use of case–control studies as opposed to prospective studies was considered another limitation. Inadequate definition or deficiencies in health outcomes need to be avoided and reporting of findings could be improved in some cases. The <b>PPR</b> <b>Panel</b> proposed recommendations on how to improve the quality and reliability of pesticide epidemiology studies to overcome these limitations and to facilitate an appropriate use for risk assessment. The Panel recommended the conduct of systematic reviews and meta-analysis, where appropriate, of pesticide observational studies as useful methodology to understand the potential hazards of pesticides, exposure scenarios and methods for assessing exposure, exposure–response characterisation and risk characterisation. Finally, the <b>PPR</b> <b>Panel</b> proposed a methodological approach to integrate and weight multiple lines of evidence, including epidemiological data, for pesticide risk assessment.

40|$|The Scientific Panel on Plant Health, Plant Protection Products {{and their}} Residues (<b>PPR</b> <b>Panel)</b> {{was asked by}} EFSA for an opinion on the {{possibility}} of refining the acute and chronic aquatic risk assessment of pesticides by lowering the assessment factor if additional species were tested. In particular, the <b>PPR</b> <b>Panel</b> was asked how these values could be reduced when additional singlespecies studies are available whilst still maintaining the same level of protection as foreseen in the Directive 91 / 414 /EEC. The current approach for acute and chronic risk assessment to protect the ecosystem against adverse effects of pesticides uses the lowest available toxicity value from laboratory standard toxicity tests, i. e. the most sensitive tested species, and divides this value by a fixed assessment factor. This results in an increase of conservatism when more species are tested and does not reflect the increased certainty that more data provide. To answer this question the <b>PPR</b> <b>Panel</b> reviewed existing literature, guidance documents, and data. Statistical calculations based on species sensitivity distributions were used to develop a range of options for adjusting the risk assessment when more species are tested. The <b>PPR</b> <b>Panel</b> assessed the current level of protection and found that it is not equal for different taxonomic groups and for different substances. On average, the level of protection provided by the current approach is, for example, markedly higher for fish than for crustaceans and insects. The <b>PPR</b> <b>Panel</b> identified a range of possible methods either to maintain at least the current unspecified level of protection, or to achieve any specified level of protection. For taxonomic groups where the legislation requires only one species (e. g. crustaceans), this effectively sets the level of protection in the effects assessment. When additional species are tested, the same average level of protection can be maintained by taking the geometric mean (rather than the lowest value) and dividing by the current assessment factor. For fish, where the legislation requires that at least two species are tested, this implies a higher level of protection in the effects assessment. In this case, a different procedure is required when additional species are tested. The minimum is then replaced by the second or third lowest toxicity value depending on the sample size available, and divided by the current assessment factor. The Panel described three further approaches that allow a particular level of protection to be achieved, provided such a level is specified. These methods involve using a modified assessment factor that incorporates an estimate of the variation between species, which can either be specific to the substance under consideration or derived from existing information on related substances. These three methods relate only to uncertainty due to variation between species. Any other uncertainties that are relevant to the assessment would need to be accounted for separately...|$|E
40|$|The European Food Safety Authority {{asked the}} Panel on Plant Protection Products and their Residues {{to develop an}} Opinion on the {{identification}} of pesticides {{to be included in}} cumulative assessment groups (CAGs) {{on the basis of their}} toxicological profile. In 2008, the <b>PPR</b> <b>Panel</b> adopted an Opinion on the suitability of existing methodologies for cumulative risk assessment of pesticides and a tiered approach was proposed, which was applied to a selected group of triazole pesticides in 2009. The present Opinion suggests a methodology for grouping of pesticides based on phenomenological effects and provides CAGs for the thyroid and nervous system. This approach can be applied even when the underlying biochemical events mediating the effects are not understood, and is based on a standardised and thorough review of Draft Assessment Reports (DARs) supporting the approval of all pesticides in Europe, and on recommendations from the European Commission. Pesticidal active substances exhibiting neurotoxic properties were allocated to CAGs for acute effects on motor, sensory and autonomic divisions of the nervous system and neurochemical endpoints. Chronic effects across the same divisions/endpoints and neuropathological effects were collated. Active substances having adverse effects on the thyroid system were allocated to CAGs for effects either on C-cells/the calcitonin system or on follicular cells/the T 3 /T 4 system. The <b>PPR</b> <b>Panel</b> notes that the resulting groups encompass many pesticides and also that individual pesticides could appear in several groups and therefore the data entries for performing cumulative risk assessment (CRA) are of considerable magnitude. Although some CAGs contain a large number of pesticides, little indication of cumulative risk may be inferred from the size of CAGs per se. The <b>PPR</b> <b>Panel</b> recommends that the methodology is implemented for all major organ/systems but the approach used should be considered specific for pesticides...|$|E
40|$|EFSA’s Panel on Plant Protection Products {{and their}} Residues (<b>PPR</b> <b>Panel)</b> {{provides}} independent scientific advice {{in the field}} of risk assessment of plant protection products (PPPs, pesticides). Since its establishment in 2003 under Regulation (EC) No 178 / 2002, it has delivered a series of scientific outputs in support of evaluation of pesticide active substances, establishing scientific principles and guidance documents {{in the field of}} pesticide risk assessment and in support of decision making of European Union (EU) law makers. Next to a series of scientific opinions evaluating specific adverse effects of PPPs for human health (like for instance carcinogenicity) the Panel also delivered scientific opinions on general principles in the field of human health risk assessment (like reference value setting) and is, in particular over the last years, very much engaged in development of methodologies to meet new challenges in regulatory risk assessments such as assessment of toxicity of pesticide metabolites and potential cumulative effects of pesticides to human health. Fate, behaviour and transformation of pesticides after their application and consequent release to the environment are a major aspect of pesticide risk assessment.

40|$|The European Food Safety Authority {{asked the}} Panel on Plant Protection Products (PPR) and their {{residues}} {{to deliver a}} Scientific Opinion on the developmental neurotoxicity (DNT) potential of the neonicotinoid insecticides acetamiprid and imidacloprid. An in vitro study (Kimura-Kuroda et al., 2012) suggested that excitation and/or desensitisation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) by these compounds might affect developing mammalian nervous systems as occurs with nicotine. To evaluate the DNT potential of acetamiprid and imidacloprid, the <b>PPR</b> <b>Panel</b> scrutinised the open literature, the draft assessments reports and dossiers submitted for approval. The Panel concludes that both compounds may affect neuronal development and function, although several methodological limitations have been identified. Considering the available DNT studies for imidacloprid and acetamiprid, important uncertainties still remain and further in vivo studies following OECD test guideline (TG) 426 are required to robustly characterise a DNT potential and dose-response relationships, particularly for acetamiprid. The Panel considers that current ARfDs may not be protective enough for the possible DNT of acetamiprid and imidacloprid and no reliable conclusion can be drawn as regards the ADI for acetamiprid. More conservative reference values are proposed based on {{the analysis of the}} existing toxicological data. However, the current ADI for imidacloprid is considered adequate to protect against its potential developmental neurotoxic effects. Limitations of the in vitro system used by Kimura-Kuroda et al. (2012) prevent its current use as a screening tool in the regulatory arena. The <b>PPR</b> <b>Panel</b> encourages the definition of clear and consistent criteria at EU level to trigger submission of mandatory DNT studies, which could include development of an integrated DNT testing strategy composed of robust, reliable and validated in vitro assays and other alternative methods complementary to the in vivo TG 426 for assessing the DNT potential of substances...|$|E

The <b>PPR</b> <b>Panel</b> is of the general opinion that, as suggested in the FOCUS report, substance parameter refinement can be applied in risk assessment. State of the art knowledge has developed {{to such an extent that}} scenario refinement is feasible as well, but will make assessment more complex unless embedded in basic tools and adequate guidance. The same is true for spatial modelling but establishment of adequate databases will require quite some effort. The Panel considers current knowledge on groundwater hydrology insufficient for implementation of monitoring as the highest tier of the assessment at the European level. The implementation of scenario refinement and spatial modelling requires clear criteria on the extent of arable surface areas with estimated leaching rates below the threshold level...|$|E
40|$|Following {{a request}} from the European Commission, the Panel on Plant Protection Products and their Residues (<b>PPR</b> <b>Panel)</b> was asked to deliver a {{scientific}} opinion on the toxicological relevance of 2 -trifluoromethyl-benzene-sulfonamide (TBSA), a soil and ground water metabolite of tritosulfuron, {{in the context of}} its potential risk to humans. Tritosulfuron is a new active substance submitted for registration in Europe for use as a post emergence systemic herbicide to control a range of dicotyledonous weeds in cereals. TBSA was identified in lysimeter studies at a concentration of 0. 107 µg/L in groundwater. TBSA has been identified as a minor metabolite (< 1 % of the administered dose) in the rat after single or repeated administration of [phenyl- 14 C]-tritosulfuron. Furthermore, TBSA has been identified in batches of technical grade tritosulfuron as an impurity. Several toxicity studies have been performed on TBSA but concerns regarding the chromosomal damaging (clastogenic) properties and the potential reproductive toxicity of the compound remained.

40|$|Following {{a request}} from the Commission, the Panel on Plant Protection Products and their Residues (PPR) was asked to deliver a {{scientific}} opinion on the possible developmental neurotoxicity of deltamethrin. The potential developmental neurotoxicity of deltamethrin was addressed by the notifier in guideline-compliant reproductive and developmental toxicity studies in different animal species including a multi-generation study in rats and a separate developmental neurotoxicity (DNT) study in the rat, {{in accordance with the}} new OECD guideline TG 426. The data available from the open literature include experimental studies carried out in rodents involving exposure during prenatal life and/or during neonatal life. These studies had several limitations and did not provide any clear evidence for a developmental neurotoxic effect of deltamethrin. The <b>PPR</b> <b>Panel</b> concluded that deltamethrin has been adequately tested for developmental neurotoxicity and that the available data do not indicate that deltamethrin is a developmental neurotoxic agent. The existing health-based guidance values for deltamethrin are based on neurological signs, as the most relevant critical effects observed in adult animals from different species.

40|$|This {{scientific}} output, {{published on}} 02 / 08 / 2012, replaces the earlier version published on 26 / 07 / 2012. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) asked the Panel on Plant Protection Products and their Residues (PPR) {{to develop an}} opinion on approaches to evaluate the toxicological relevance of metabolites and degradates of pesticide active substances in dietary risk assessment. This opinion identifies the threshold of toxicological concern (TTC) concept as an appropriate screening tool. The TTC values for genotoxic and toxic compounds {{were found to be}} sufficiently conservative for chronic exposure, {{as a result of a}} validation study with a group of pesticides belonging to different chemical classes. Three critical steps were identified in the application of a TTC scheme: 1) the estimate of the level of the metabolite, 2) the evaluation of genotoxicity alerts and 3) the detection of neurotoxic metabolites. Tentative TTC values for acute exposure were established by the <b>PPR</b> <b>Panel</b> by analysis of the lowest 5 th percentiles of No Observed Adverse Effect Levels (NOAELs) used to establish the Acute Reference Doses (ARfD) for the EFSA pesticide data set.

40|$|In 2013, EFSA {{published}} a literature review on epidemiological studies linking exposure to pesticides {{and human health}} outcome. As a follow up, the EFSA Panel on Plant Protection Products and their residues (<b>PPR</b> <b>Panel)</b> was requested to investigate the plausible involvement of pesticide exposure as {{a risk factor for}} Parkinson's disease (PD) and childhood leukaemia (CHL). A systematic literature review on PD and CHL and mode of actions for pesticides was published by EFSA in 2016 and used as background documentation. The Panel used the Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP) conceptual framework to define the biological plausibility in relation to epidemiological studies by means of identification of specific symptoms of the diseases as AO. The AOP combines multiple information and provides knowledge of biological pathways, highlights species differences and similarities, identifies research needs and supports regulatory decisions. In this context, the AOP approach could help in organising the available experimental knowledge to assess biological plausibility by describing the link between a molecular initiating event (MIE) and the AO through a series of biologically plausible and essential key events (KEs). As the AOP is chemically agnostic, tool chemical compounds were selected to empirically support the response and temporal concordance of the key event relationships (KERs). Three qualitative and one putative AOP were developed by the Panel using the results obtained. The Panel supports the use of the AOP framework to scientifically and transparently explore the biological plausibility of the association between pesticide exposure and human health outcomes, identify data gaps, define a tailored testing strategy and suggests an AOP’s informed Integrated Approach for Testing and Assessment (IATA) ...|$|E

This Guidance of the <b>PPR</b> <b>Panel</b> {{is the first of}} three {{requested}} deliverables within this mandate. It has its focus on tiered acute and chronic effect assessment schemes with detailed guidance on tier 1 and higher tier effect assessments for aquatic organisms in edge-of-field surface waters and on proposals regarding how to link effects to exposure estimates. The exposure assessment methodology was not reviewed and it is assumed that the current FOCUS surface water exposure assessment methodology will continue to be used for exposure assessment at EU level. The current GD is intended to be used for authorisation of active substances at EU level as well as for plant protection products at Member State level. The effect assessment schemes in this GD allow for the derivation of regulatory acceptable concentrations (RACs) on the basis of two options: (1) the ecological threshold option (ETO), accepting negligible population effects only, and (2) the ecological recovery option (ERO), accepting some population-level effects if ecological recovery takes place within an acceptable time period. In the tiered effect assessment schemes, in principle, all tiers (1, 2 and 3) are able to address the ETO, while the model ecosystem approach (tier 3), under certain conditions, is able to also address the ERO. The GD provides the scientific background for the risk assessment to aquatic organisms in edge-of-field surface waters and is structured to give detailed guidance on all assessment steps.
