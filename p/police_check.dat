2500|$|The {{island is}} subject to {{separate}} immigration controls from the remainder of Australia. Until recently immigration to Norfolk Island even by other Australian citizens was heavily restricted. [...] In 2012, immigration controls were relaxed {{with the introduction of}} an Unrestricted Entry Permit for all Australian and New Zealand citizens upon arrival and the option to apply for residency; the only criteria are to pass a <b>police</b> <b>check</b> and be able to pay into the local health scheme. From 1 July 2016, the Australian migration system replaced the immigration arrangements previously maintained by the Norfolk Island Government.|$|E
2500|$|On 2 January 1981, Sutcliffe {{was stopped}} by the police with 24-year-old prostitute Olivia Reivers in the {{driveway}} of Light Trades House in Melbourne Avenue, Broomhill, Sheffield. A <b>police</b> <b>check</b> revealed his car had false number plates and Sutcliffe was arrested and transferred to Dewsbury Police Station. At Dewsbury he was questioned {{in relation to the}} Yorkshire Ripper case as he matched many of the known physical characteristics. The next day police returned {{to the scene of the}} arrest and discovered a knife, hammer and rope he had discarded when he briefly slipped away from the police after telling them he was [...] "bursting for a pee". Sutcliffe hid a second knife in the toilet cistern at the police station when he was permitted to use the toilet. The police obtained a search warrant for his home at 6, Garden Lane in Heaton, Bradford and brought his wife in for questioning.|$|E

2500|$|Costs were {{controlled}} during construction {{and operation of}} the system by going with the lowest bidder and using relatively cheap, commercially available technology without regard for [...] "buy Canadian" [...] policies. This has worked out well for a pioneer system because the German technology chosen has since become {{a more or less}} standard design for most North American LRT systems, and compatible new-generation equipment with new features is available off-the-shelf. [...] A grade-separated system was passed over in preference for a system with few elevated or buried segments, and the trains and stations selected were of the tried and tested, utilitarian variety (for example, vehicles were not air conditioned, storage yards were not automated, and stations were usually modest concrete platforms with a shelter overhead). [...] This allowed greater amounts of track to be laid within available budgets. The CTrain reduced fare collection costs by using an honour system of payment. Transit <b>police</b> <b>check</b> passenger tickets at random, and fines are set at a level high enough that those who are caught pay the costs for those who evade detection. Staffing costs were kept low by employing a minimum number of workers, and because the system is all-electric (wind powered) it can run all night with only 1 driver per train and 2 people in the control room. It now runs 22 hours per day without significantly increased overhead. (The other 2 hours are reserved for track maintenance).|$|E
