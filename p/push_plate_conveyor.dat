50|$|The plasma would cool to 14,000 °C as it traversed the 25 m {{distance}} to the <b>pusher</b> <b>plate</b> and then reheat to 67,000 °C as, at about 300 microseconds, it hits the <b>pusher</b> <b>plate</b> and is recompressed. This temperature emits ultraviolet light, which is poorly transmitted through most plasmas. This helps keep the <b>pusher</b> <b>plate</b> cool. The cigar shaped distribution profile and low density of the plasma reduces the instantaneous shock to the <b>pusher</b> <b>plate.</b>|$|R
50|$|The bombs {{had to be}} {{launched}} behind the <b>pusher</b> <b>plate</b> with enough velocity to explode 20-30 meters beyond it every 1.1 seconds. Numerous proposals were investigated, from multiple guns poking {{over the edge of}} the <b>pusher</b> <b>plate</b> to rocket propelled bombs launched from roller coaster tracks, however the final reference design used a simple gas gun to shoot the devices through a hole in the center of the <b>pusher</b> <b>plate.</b>|$|R
50|$|Another {{potential}} {{problem with the}} <b>pusher</b> <b>plate</b> is that of spalling—shards of metal—potentially flying {{off the top of}} the plate. The shockwave from the impacting plasma on the bottom of the plate passes through the plate and reaches the top surface. At that point spalling may occur damaging the <b>pusher</b> <b>plate.</b> For that reason alternative substances, plywood and fiberglass, were investigated for the surface layer of the <b>pusher</b> <b>plate</b> and thought to be acceptable.|$|R

50|$|True {{engineering}} {{tests of}} the vehicle systems {{were thought to be}} impossible because several thousand nuclear explosions could not be performed in any one place. Experiments were designed to test <b>pusher</b> <b>plates</b> in nuclear fireballs and long-term tests of <b>pusher</b> <b>plates</b> could occur in space. Several of these tests almost flew. The shock-absorber designs could be tested at full-scale on Earth using chemical explosives.|$|R
50|$|B&P Process Equipment and Systems (B&P) {{makes the}} largest {{single-stage}} pusher centrifuge, which they {{claimed to be}} superior to multistage designs. They claimed that additional impurities enter the liquid housing due to additional particles tumbling in each stage. The problem can be overcome by using a shorter inner basket with smaller diameter between the <b>pusher</b> <b>plates</b> and the basket and enabling pusher movement to take place between the <b>pusher</b> <b>plate</b> and the basket {{as well as between}} the inner basket and the outer basket. Compared to single-stage pushers that have pusher movement only between <b>pusher</b> <b>plate</b> and basket, multistage centrifuges have the advantages that the cake height is reduced, filtration resistance is lower and lesser force is required.|$|R

40|$|A {{preliminary}} {{scheme was}} developed for base-mounted solid-propellant retro rocket motors to self-penetrate the Orion Crew Module heat shield for configurations with the heat shield retained during landings on Earth. In this system the motors propel impactors into structural <b>push</b> <b>plates,</b> which in turn push through the heat shield ablator material. The <b>push</b> <b>plates</b> are sized such that the remaining port in the ablator material {{is large enough to}} provide adequate flow area for the motor exhaust plume. The <b>push</b> <b>plate</b> thickness is sized to assure structural integrity behind the ablative thermal protection material. The concept feasibility was demonstrated and the performance was characterized using a gas gun to launch representative impactors into heat shield targets with <b>push</b> <b>plates.</b> The tests were conducted using targets equipped with Fiberform(R) and PICA as the heat shield ablator material layer. The PICA penetration event times were estimated to be under 30 ms from the start of motor ignition. The mass of the system (not including motors) was estimated to be less than 2. 3 kg (5 lbs) per motor. The configuration and demonstrations are discussed...|$|R
50|$|To {{estimate}} {{the upper and}} lower limits of what could be done using contemporary technology (in 1968), Dyson considered two starship designs. The more conservative energy limited <b>pusher</b> <b>plate</b> design simply had to absorb all the thermal energy of each impinging explosion (4×1015 joules, half of which would be absorbed by the <b>pusher</b> <b>plate)</b> without melting. Dyson estimated that if the exposed surface consisted of copper with a thickness of 1 mm, then the diameter and mass of the hemispherical <b>pusher</b> <b>plate</b> would have to be 20 kilometers and 5 million metric tons, respectively. 100 seconds would be required to allow the copper to radiatively cool before the next explosion. It would then take on the order of 1000 years for the energy-limited heat sink Orion design to reach Alpha Centauri.|$|R
50|$|From 1957 to 1964 this {{information}} was used to design a spacecraft propulsion system called Orion, in which nuclear explosives would be thrown behind a pusher-plate mounted {{on the bottom of}} a spacecraft and exploded. The shock wave and radiation from the detonation would impact against the underside of the <b>pusher</b> <b>plate,</b> giving it a powerful <b>push.</b> The <b>pusher</b> <b>plate</b> would be mounted on large two-stage shock absorbers that would smoothly transmit acceleration {{to the rest of the}} spacecraft.|$|R
50|$|One {{issue that}} {{remained}} unresolved {{at the conclusion}} of the project was whether or not the turbulence created by the combination of the propellant and ablated <b>pusher</b> <b>plate</b> would dramatically increase the total ablation of the <b>pusher</b> <b>plate.</b> According to Freeman Dyson in the 1960s they would have had to actually perform a test with a real nuclear explosive to determine this; with modern simulation technology this could be determined fairly accurately without such empirical investigation.|$|R

40|$|This study {{offers a}} method applied in {{injection}} mould with automatic thread demoulding by using servo {{control and the}} combination of mechanical structures. In injection moulding, using hydraulic motor to drive gears and cores with thread for automatically taking plastic-injected parts with thread off from the cores is a common method for thread demoulding. The thread demoulding is completed by two movements. One of them is realized by {{the rotation of the}} threaded cores driven by hydraulic motor; the other is to stop the injected plastic part from turning and meanwhile push it out by a <b>pushing</b> <b>plate.</b> The <b>pushing</b> <b>plate</b> is usually driven by springs which give forces that vary with the distance the plate travels. Because of this, the displacement of the <b>pushing</b> <b>plate</b> might be different from that of displacement of the core thread goes along the core axis. Thus the parts moulded may be damaged at the thread area on the part when the automatic thread demoulding is proceeding. This technique needs much to be improved hereon in injection moulding. In this study, the author brings up a solution that the hydraulic motor is replaced by a step motor and the <b>pushing</b> <b>plate</b> is driven by a servo motor. And there is a programmable logic controller to synchronize the two movements driven by the motors. Through the improvement the mechanism is substantially enhanced compared with the spring-driven pushing demoulding system...|$|R
50|$|Exposure to {{repeated}} nuclear blasts raises {{the problem of}} ablation (erosion) of the <b>pusher</b> <b>plate.</b> Calculations and experiments indicated that a steel <b>pusher</b> <b>plate</b> would ablate less than 1 mm, if unprotected. If sprayed with an oil it would not ablate at all (this was discovered by accident; a test plate had oily fingerprints on it and the fingerprints suffered no ablation). The absorption spectra of carbon and hydrogen minimize heating. The design temperature of the shockwave, 67,000 °C, emits ultraviolet light. Most materials and elements are opaque to ultraviolet especially at the 340 MPa pressures the plate experiences. This prevents the plate from melting or ablating.|$|R

50|$|The {{smaller the}} bomb, the smaller each impulse will be, so {{the higher the}} rate of impulses and more than {{will be needed to}} achieve orbit. Smaller impulses also mean less g shock on the <b>pusher</b> <b>plate</b> and less need for damping to smooth out the acceleration.|$|R

5000|$|In {{order to}} improve on this {{performance}} while reducing size and cost, Dyson also considered an alternative momentum limited <b>pusher</b> <b>plate</b> design where an ablation coating of the exposed surface is substituted {{to get rid of}} the excess heat. The limitation is then set by the capacity of shock absorbers to transfer momentum from the impulsively accelerated <b>pusher</b> <b>plate</b> to the smoothly accelerated vehicle. Dyson calculated that the properties of available materials limited the velocity transferred by each explosion to ~30 meters per second independent of the size and nature of the explosion. If the vehicle is to be accelerated at 1 Earth gravity (9.81 m/s2) with this velocity transfer, then the pulse rate is one explosion every three seconds.

50|$|Since {{weight is}} no limitation, an Orion craft can be {{extremely}} robust. An unmanned craft could tolerate very large accelerations, perhaps 100 g.
