5|$|Andrzej Frycz Modrzewski {{was one of}} the {{greatest}} theorists of political thought in Renaissance Europe. His most famous work, On the Improvement of the Commonwealth, was published in Kraków in 1551. Modrzewski criticized the feudal societal relations and proposed broad realistic reforms. He postulated that all social classes should be subjected to the law to the same degree, and wanted to moderate the existing inequities. Modrzewski, an influential and often translated author, was a passionate proponent of <b>peaceful</b> <b>resolution</b> <b>of</b> international conflicts. Bishop Wawrzyniec Goślicki (Goslicius), who wrote and published in 1568 a study entitled De optimo senatore (The Counsellor in the 1598 English translation), was another popular and influential in the West political thinker.|$|E
5|$|Carrier Air Group 8 (CVG-8) was {{established}} on 15 September 1948 {{in response to}} the Berlin Blockade with newly qualified pilots and reservists who volunteered for active duty. VA-84 and VA-85, the air group's attack squadrons, began receiving Maulers in November and the last aircraft was delivered in January 1949. Later that month the air group made a flyover of President Harry Truman's Inauguration ceremony. The squadron conducted their qualifications aboard the Midway from 3 to 6 May with ten Maulers crashing into the safety barrier between them. CVG-8 made a two-week cruise aboard the Midway beginning on 27 June along the East Coast of the United States, before it was disbanded in November after the <b>peaceful</b> <b>resolution</b> <b>of</b> the Berlin Blockade.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the 1930s, {{tensions}} built between Germany and the United Kingdom {{as well as}} its allies. During late 1937 {{and throughout}} 1938, German demands for the annexation of Czechoslovakia's Sudetenland led to an international crisis. In an attempt to avoid war, British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain met with German Chancellor Adolf Hitler in September and brokered the Munich Agreement. The agreement averted immediate war and allowed Germany to annex the Sudetenland. Chamberlain had intended the agreement to lead to further <b>peaceful</b> <b>resolution</b> <b>of</b> issues, but relations between both countries soon deteriorated. On 15 March 1939, Germany breached the terms of the agreement by invading and occupying the remnants of the Czech state.|$|E

50|$|The {{roots of}} the Carey Institute go back to 1924 when Laura Talmage Huyck convened “Country Forums on Human Relations” at her home as a {{reaction}} to the carnage of World War I. The forums aimed to promote global understanding that would lead to <b>peaceful</b> <b>resolutions</b> <b>of</b> differences. Participants came from many countries to discuss how to achieve world peace and mutual understanding.|$|R
5|$|The Polish Foreign Minister Józef Beck, who {{had just}} {{returned}} from a trip to Sorrento, called for a government meeting on the night of March 16. During the meeting he argued that the ultimatum needed to contain only one demand: the establishment of diplomatic relations. In his view, such an ultimatum would not have violated any genuine Lithuanian interests and would offer much-improved prospects for <b>peaceful</b> <b>resolution</b> <b>of</b> the conflict and a speedy relief of tension. It was in accordance with Beck's vision for Eastern Europe, which was based on a Warsaw-dominated Polish–Baltic–Scandinavian bloc free of Soviet or German influence, a modified version of Józef Piłsudski's Międzymorze, which required the normalization of relations with Lithuania. The removal of the other demands also reflected political pressure on Poland from the Soviet Union, France, and the United Kingdom to prevent the conflict from escalating into warfare.|$|E
5|$|An ally of Illinois' Stephen A. Douglas, Breckinridge {{supported}} {{the doctrine of}} popular sovereignty as expressed in Douglas's Kansas–Nebraska Act. He believed passage of the act would remove the issue of slavery from national politics – although it ultimately had the opposite effect – and acted as a liaison between Douglas and Pierce to secure its passage. During {{the debate on the}} House floor, New York's Francis B. Cutting, incensed by a statement that Breckinridge had made, demanded that he explain or retract it. Breckinridge interpreted Cutting's demand as a challenge to duel. Under code duello, the individual being challenged retained the right to name the weapons used and the distance between the combatants; Breckinridge chose rifles at 60 paces. He also specified that the duel should be held at Silver Spring, Maryland, the home of his friend Francis Preston Blair. Cutting, who had not intended his initial remark as a challenge, believed that Breckinridge's naming of terms constituted a challenge; he chose to use pistols at a distance of 10 paces. While the two men attempted to clarify who had issued the challenge and who reserved the right to choose the terms, mutual friends resolved the issue, preventing the duel. The recently adopted Kentucky Constitution prevented anyone who participated in a duel from holding elected office, and the <b>peaceful</b> <b>resolution</b> <b>of</b> the issue may have saved Breckinridge's political career.|$|E
5|$|De Launay {{had limited}} options: if he allowed the Revolutionaries to destroy his main gate, {{he would have}} to turn the cannon {{directly}} inside the Bastille's courtyard on the crowds, causing great loss of life and preventing any <b>peaceful</b> <b>resolution</b> <b>of</b> the episode. De Launay could not withstand a long siege, and he was dissuaded by his officers from committing mass suicide by detonating his supplies of powder. Instead, de Launay attempted to negotiate a surrender, threatening to blow up the Bastille if his demands were not met. In the midst of this attempt, the Bastille's drawbridge suddenly came down and the revolutionary crowd stormed in. De Launay was dragged outside into the streets and killed by the crowd, and three officers and three soldiers were killed {{during the course of the}} afternoon by the crowd. The soldiers of the Swiss Salis-Samade Regiment, however, were not wearing their uniform coats and were mistaken for Bastille prisoners; they were left unharmed by the crowds until they were escorted away by French Guards and other regular soldiers among the attackers. The valuable powder and guns were seized and a search begun for the other prisoners in the Bastille.|$|E

5|$|During the 1923 Corfu {{incident}} with Greece, the Italian Navy, including Andrea Doria, was deployed {{to the island}} to secure a Greek apology following the murder of Enrico Tellini and four others. Following the <b>peaceful</b> <b>resolution</b> <b>of</b> the incident, Andrea Doria visited Spain. On 16 January 1925, Andrea Doria visited Lisbon {{to participate in the}} 400th anniversary of the death of Vasco de Gama. She thereafter went to La Spezia for a refit, which began on 7 February and was completed by June. Following civil unrest in Syria, Andrea Doria steamed to the eastern Mediterranean with a squadron of destroyers in the event that Italian nationals would need to be evacuated. The ships remained docked in Leros until 12 December, by which time the disturbances in Syria had been calmed down. She spent the next six years on normal peacetime duties, until she was withdrawn from service in August 1932. She was placed in reserve in Taranto, with a skeleton crew for maintenance. In March 1937, she started the major reconstruction in Trieste, where she arrived on the 30th. The refit began on 8 April at the Cantieri Riuniti dell'Adriatico shipyard.|$|E

2500|$|Li {{believes}} that Wushu is not primarily for self-defense {{and instead of}} trying to play the hero people should think about <b>peaceful</b> <b>resolutions</b> <b>of</b> conflicts and call the police if necessary: [...] "A gun outdoes years of martial arts training in a split second. Like I've said many times before, it is important to differentiate between movies and reality. The hero in movies may be able to knock the gun off his opponent and save the day, but in real life – probably that is not the case." [...] He has also stated that he has never had to use his martial arts skills in a real life fight and he does not wish to, either.|$|R
40|$|Conflict {{parties are}} {{frequently}} involved {{into more than}} one conflict at a given time. In this paper the interrelated structure of conflictive relations is modeled as a conflict network where opponents are embedded in a local structure of bilateral conflicts. Conflict parties invest in specific conflict technology to attack their respective rivals and defend their own resources. We show that there exists a unique equilibrium for this conflict game and examine the relation between aggregated equilibrium investment (interpreted as conflict intensity) and underlying network characteristics. The derived results have implications for <b>peaceful</b> <b>resolutions</b> <b>of</b> conflicts because neglecting the fact that opponents are embedded into an interrelated conflict structure might have adverse consequences for conflict intensity.

The most important international legal acts of the International Labour Organisation (ILO), the acts of the Council of Europe and the acts in the Republic of Macedonia are analysed. In addition, the paper analyses the role and responsibilities of institutions in Macedonia that are important in resolving this type of disputes. We consider such legal solution legally invalid because the state is given the chance to interfere in the process <b>of</b> <b>peaceful</b> <b>of</b> <b>resolution</b> <b>of</b> labour disputes, which violates the basic principles of neutrality and impartiality. Therefore, we consider it necessary to established an independent institution for resolving collective labour disputes.
