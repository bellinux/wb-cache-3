40|$|In {{this work}} we propose a {{different}} approach to the problem of estimating a transfer matrix with data aided, which can be applied to SISO and SIMO channels, either baud-rate or fractionally sampled signals. The approach is based on the Empirical Likelihood method [1, 2], a flexible semi-parametric estimation method, which can easily integrate in the estimation procedure some <b>prior</b> <b>informations</b> on the structure of the parameter of interest. Moreover, this improved estimation method does not assume any model for the data distribution. The contributions of this paper is twofold: first, we introduce the Empirical Likelihood method in a general context, i. e. without any <b>prior</b> <b>informations</b> and then, we derive closed-form expressions of estimators for the transfer matrix. All results are presented under Gaussian assumptions and under a mixture of Gaussian and Student-t distributions. This allows to show the robustness of the proposed method. 1...|$|R

This method of evaluating possible pricing strategies does have its limitations as it requires a number of assumptions to be made about the market place in which an organisation operates.

25|$|Bayesian {{decision}} analysis {{can also be}} applied to the channel selection process. In order to help provide further information the method can be used that produces results in a profit or loss aspect. <b>Prior</b> <b>information</b> can include costs, expected profit, training expenses and any other costs relevant to the decision as well as managerial experience which can be displayed in a normal distribution. Bayesian decision making under uncertainty lets a marketing manager assess his/her options for channel logistics by computing the most profitable method choice. A number of different costs can be entered into the model that helps to assess the ramifications of change in distribution method. Identifying and quantifying all of the relevant information for this process can be very time consuming and costly if the analysis delays possible future earnings.|$|E

40|$|Bayes factors (BFs) play an {{important}} role in comparing the fit of statistical models. However, computational limitations or lack of an appropriate prior sometimes prevent researchers from using exact BFs. Instead, it is approximated, often using the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) or a variant of BIC. The authors provide a comparison of several BF approximations, including two new approximations, the Scaled Unit <b>Information</b> <b>Prior</b> Bayesian <b>Information</b> Criterion (SPBIC) and Information matrix-based Bayesian Information Criterion (IBIC). The SPBIC uses a scaled unit <b>information</b> <b>prior</b> that is more general than the BIC’s unit <b>information</b> <b>prior,</b> and the IBIC utilizes more terms of approximation than the BIC. Through simulation, the authors show that several measures perform well in large samples, that performance declines in smaller samples, and that SPBIC and IBIC provide improvement to existing measures under some conditions, including small sample sizes. The authors illustrate the use of the fit measures with the crime data of Ehrlich and then conclude with recommendations for researchers...|$|R
40|$|Bonett [1] {{provides}} an approximate confidence interval for σ and shows {{it to be}} nearly exact under normality and, for small samples, under moderate non-normality. This paper proposes a new method for determining the confidence interval for σ. We follow the suggestion of Bonett [1] and include any <b>prior</b> kurtosis <b>information.</b> An important modification from the Bonett method is to base the interval on / 2 tα, the (/ 2) 100 thα quantile of Student T distribution, rather than on / 2 Zα, the (/ 2) 100 thα quantile of standard normal distribution. Further, {{the use of the}} median as an estimate of the population mean gives a slightly higher coverage probability for the confidence interval for σ when data are from skewed leptokurtic distributions. Monte Carlo Simulation results for selected normal and non-normal distributions show that the confidence intervals obtained from the new method have appreciably higher coverage probabilities than the confidence intervals from the original Bonett method that does not use <b>prior</b> kurtosis <b>information,</b> and also higher coverage probabilities than the Bonett method that does use <b>prior</b> kurtosis <b>information...</b>|$|R

The methodology used for this analysis is in the form of decision trees and ‘stop’/‘go’ procedures. If the predicted payoff (the posterior) is acceptable for the organisation the project should go ahead, if not, development should stop. By reviewing the posterior (which then becomes the new prior) on regular intervals throughout the development stage managers are able to make the best possible decision with the information available at hand. Although the review process may delay further development and increase costs, it can help greatly to reduce uncertainty in high risk decisions.|$|E
