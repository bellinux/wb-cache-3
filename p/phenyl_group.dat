25|$|Phenol, {{also known}} as {{carbolic}} acid, is an aromatic organic compound with the molecular formula C6H5OH. It is a white crystalline solid that is volatile. The molecule consists of a <b>phenyl</b> <b>group</b> (−C6H5) bonded to a hydroxyl group (−OH). It is mildly acidic and requires careful handling due to its propensity to cause chemical burns.|$|E

PD is considered an analog of lewisite. At its freezing point, -20°C, PD becomes a microcrystalline solid mass. The compound has a C-metalloid bond between the <b>phenyl</b> <b>group</b> and the arsenic and two covalent bonds between the arsenic and the chlorine.|$|E

25|$|Aniline is {{an organic}} {{compound}} with the formula C6H5NH2. Consisting of a <b>phenyl</b> <b>group</b> attached to an amino group, aniline is the prototypical aromatic amine. Its main use {{is in the}} manufacture of precursors to polyurethane and other industrial chemicals. Like most volatile amines, it possesses the odour of rotten fish. It ignites readily, burning with a smoky flame characteristic of aromatic compounds.|$|E
25|$|The main RAFT {{equilibrium}} {{and hence}} the rate retardation of the reaction is influenced by both temperature and chemical factors. A high temperature favors formation of the fragmentation products rather than the adduct radical Pn-S-C•(Z)-S-Pm. RAFT agents with a radical stabilising Z-group such as <b>Phenyl</b> <b>group</b> favor the adduct radical, as do propagating radicals whose monomers lack radical stabilising features, for example Vinyl acetate.|$|E
25|$|Zinc enolates, {{prepared}} from {{alkali metal}} enolates and ZnCl2, provide control of stereochemistry in aldol condensation reactions due to chelation {{on to the}} zinc. In the example shown below, the threo product was favored over the erythro {{by a factor of}} 5:1 when ZnCl2 in DME/ether was used. The chelate is more stable when the bulky <b>phenyl</b> <b>group</b> is pseudo-equatorial rather than pseudo-axial, i.e., threo rather than erythro.|$|E

5000|$|Usually, a [...] "phenyl group" [...] {{is synonymous}} to C6H5- and is {{represented}} by the symbol Ph or, archaically, Φ. Benzene is sometimes denoted as PhH. <b>Phenyl</b> <b>groups</b> are generally attached to other atoms or groups. For example, triphenylmethane (Ph3CH) has three <b>phenyl</b> <b>groups</b> attached to the same carbon center. Many or even most phenyl compounds are not described with the term [...] "phenyl". For example, the chloro derivative C6H5Cl is normally called chlorobenzene, although it could be called phenyl chloride.

25|$|For optimal {{activity}} and selectivity of the coxibs, a 4-methylsulfonylphenyl attached to an unsaturated (usually) five-membered ring with a vicinal lipophilic group is required (rofecoxib). The SO2CH3 {{can be replaced}} by SO2NH2, wherein the lipophilic pocket is occupied by an optionally substituted phenyl ring or a bulky alkoxy substituent (celecoxib). Within the hydrophilic side-pocket of COX-2, the oxygen of the sulfonamide (or sulfone) group interacts with Hist90, Arg513, and Gln192 and forms hydrogen bonds. The substituted <b>phenyl</b> <b>group</b> {{at the top of}} the channel interacts with the side-chains of amino acid residues through hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions. Tyr385 makes for some sterical restrictions of this side of the binding site so a small substituent of the <b>phenyl</b> <b>group</b> makes for better binding. Degrees of freedom are also important for the binding. The central ring of the coxibs decides the orientation of the aromatic rings and, therefore, the binding to COX enzyme even though it often has no electrostatic interactions with any of the amino acid residues. The high lipophilicity of the active site does require low polarity of the central scaffold of the coxibs.|$|E
25|$|Another {{commercial}} semisynthesis (by {{the company}} Natural Pharmaceuticals) {{relies on the}} isolation {{of a group of}} paclitaxel derivatives isolated from primary ornamental taxanes. These derivatives have the same skeleton as paclitaxel except for the organic residue R of the terminal tail amide group which can be phenyl, or propyl or pentyl (among others) whereas in paclitaxel it is an explicit <b>phenyl</b> <b>group.</b> The semisynthesis consists of conversion of the amide group to an amine with Schwartz's reagent through an imine followed by acidic workup and a benzoylation.|$|E
25|$|Later, Corey {{demonstrated}} that substituted boranes were easier {{to prepare and}} much more stable. The reduction mechanism begins with the oxazoborolidine being only slightly basic at , coordinating with the stoichiometric borane of the boron amine complex(scheme 10). Lack of donation from the nitrogen to the boron increases its Lewis acidity, allowing coordination with the ketone substrate. The complexation of the substrate occurs from the most accessible lone pair of the oxygen leading to restricted rotation around the B-O bond due to the sterically neighboring <b>phenyl</b> <b>group.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{reason for}} ethidium bromide's intense {{fluorescence}} after binding with DNA {{is probably not}} due to rigid stabilization of the phenyl , because the phenyl ring {{has been shown to}} project outside the intercalated bases. In fact, the <b>phenyl</b> <b>group</b> is found to be almost perpendicular to the plane of the ring system, as it rotates about its single bond to find a position where it will impinge upon the ring system minimally. Instead, the hydrophobic environment found between the base pairs is believed to be responsible. By moving into this hydrophobic environment and away from the solvent, the ethidium cation is forced to shed any water molecules that were associated with it. As water is a highly efficient fluorescent quencher, the removal of these water molecules allows the ethidium to fluoresce.|$|E

40|$|We have {{investigated}} thermal and electron-induced chemistry of benzene (C 6 H 6) adsorbed on a Au(111) surface. Thermal desorption of benzene occurs in three desorption peaks: monolayer at 239 K, bilayer at 155 K, and multilayer films at 151 K. Electron-induced dissociation (EID) {{has been reported}} previously to selectively break a single C-H bond in molecules present in physisorbed layers and condensed films on metal surfaces, and we investigate whether EID at an incident energy of 30 eV can cleanly prepare adsorbed phenyl (C 6 H 5 (a)) groups on the surface at low temperatures (90 K). We use infrared reflection-absorption spectroscopy (IRAS) to show unequivocally that adsorbed <b>phenyl</b> <b>groups</b> can be formed by this procedure. <b>Phenyl</b> <b>groups</b> on Au(111) are bound with the molecular (ring) plane perpendicular to the Au surface plane, with the molecular z-axis tilted away from the surface normal. In contrast to previous reports of the chemistry of <b>phenyl</b> <b>groups</b> adsorbed on Cu(111) and Ag(111) surfaces, we find that adsorbed <b>phenyl</b> <b>groups</b> are stable only until 165 K on Au(111). At higher temperatures, <b>phenyl</b> <b>groups</b> undergo coupling reactions to form adsorbed biphenyl (C 6 H 5 -C 6 H 5) species which desorb intact from the surface at 400 K. While C-H activation (bond cleavage) on Au surfaces is difficult, hydrogenation and C-C coupling reactions are facile. Diffusion of aryl and alkyl intermediates to Au sites could result in immediate coupling and possibly desorption of products. This implies that Au atoms may play a more important role in bimetallic hydrocarbon conversion catalysis than simply blocking reactive sites. 1...|$|R
