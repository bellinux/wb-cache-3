40|$|In {{this paper}} we have {{proposed}} a test cost model for core-based 3 D Stacked ICs (SICs) connected by Through Silicon Vias (TSVs). Unlike {{in the case of}} non-stacked chips, where the test flow is well defined by applying the same test schedule both at wafer sort and at <b>package</b> <b>test,</b> the most cost-efficient test flow for 3 D TSV-SICs is yet undefined. Therefore, analysing the various alternatives of test flow, we present a cost model with the optimal test flow. In the test flow alternatives, we analyse the effect of all possible moments of testing for a 3 D TSV-SIC, viz., wafer sort, intermediate <b>test</b> and <b>package</b> <b>test.</b> For the optimal test flow, we have performed experiments with various varying yield and test time parameters, which further support our claim...|$|R
