5|$|Although {{opened in}} 1800 {{at the cost}} of £100,000, the new harbour at Grimsby failed to attract the levels of trade the company had projected, caused largely by a lack of inland {{transport}} networks. The financial <b>problems</b> <b>facing</b> <b>the</b> Grimsby Haven Company led to factions and difficulty in its running and put strain on Boucherett's relations with Yarborough; having invested much money and time in the now failing company, Boucherett also found it draining of him financially.|$|E

5|$|The Polish Second Army {{consisted}} of five infantry divisions: (5th, 7th, 8th, 9th and 10th, the 1st Armored Corps, and smaller units), about 84,000–90,000 men, and 500 tanks. Many {{of them were}} new recruits inexperienced in combat, incorporated from the recently retaken Polish territories. The quality of the officer corps has also been questioned. One of the major <b>problems</b> <b>facing</b> <b>the</b> People's Army was lack of a qualified cadre; a 1944 estimate showed that the army had one officer for each 1,200 soldiers. Many of the officers in the Polish Army were Soviet officers of Polish descent.|$|E

The <b>problems</b> <b>facing</b> <b>the</b> monarchy were complex and daunting but Catherine was able to keep the monarchy and the state institutions functioning even at a minimum level. At first, Catherine compromised and made concessions to the rebelling Protestants, or Huguenots, as they became known. She failed, however, to grasp the theological issues that drove their movement. Later she resorted, in frustration and anger, to hard-line policies against them. In return, she came to be blamed for the excessive persecutions carried out under her sons' rule, in particular for the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre of 1572, in which thousands of Huguenots were killed in Paris and throughout France.|$|E

5|$|VHEMT {{was founded}} in 1991 by Les U. Knight, an American activist who became {{involved}} in the environmental movement in the 1970s and thereafter concluded that human extinction was the best solution to the <b>problems</b> <b>facing</b> <b>the</b> Earth's biosphere and humanity. Knight publishes the group's newsletter and serves as its spokesman. Although the group is promoted by a website and represented at some environmental events, it relies heavily on coverage from outside media to spread its message. Many commentators view its platform as unacceptably extreme, though other writers have applauded VHEMT's perspective. In response to VHEMT, some journalists and academics have argued that humans can develop sustainable lifestyles or can reduce their population to sustainable levels. Others maintain that, whatever the merits of the idea, the human reproductive drive will prevent humankind from ever voluntarily seeking extinction.|$|E
5|$|Allen {{returned}} to Jamaica {{to serve as}} a pastor, and was given increasing leadership responsibilities within the broader Seventh-day Adventist Church. Allen was appointed as the Director of Education and Communications within the Central Jamaica Conference of Seventh-day Adventists, one of five regional conferences within Jamaica. He later served as the Director of Education and Family Life for the West Indies Union of Seventh-day Adventists, which at the time had jurisdiction over Jamaica, The Bahamas, the Cayman Islands, and the Turks and Caicos Islands. In 1993, he {{returned to}} Andrews University, where he worked in the registrar's office while pursuing a doctorate in Educational Administration and Supervision. After receiving his doctorate in 1998, Allen returned to Jamaica, where he became the President of the Central Jamaica Conference, and in 2000, the President of the West Indies Union of Seventh-day Adventists. In 2005, he was elected to a second five-year term. In his acceptance speech, Allen opined that church outreach should address the <b>problems</b> <b>facing</b> <b>the</b> community, including the HIV/AIDS epidemic, domestic abuse, teenage pregnancy, unemployment, and violent crime. During this time, Allen also served as the chairman of the boards of Northern Caribbean University and Andrews Memorial Hospital.|$|E
5|$|The {{relocation}} of the livestock market had {{done little to}} resolve the problems of congestion {{in and around the}} market. Many of the mediaeval access routes to the market were too narrow for wheeled transport, and the narrow alleys were also dark, dangerous and mostly unpaved. Although the market had been resurfaced during the 18thcentury, this had been with flint pebble cobblestones which were easily dislodged and trapped refuse. William Chase, editor of the first Norwich Directory, lobbied in the late 18thcentury for civic improvements and a rationalisation of the streets around the market. However, the economy of Norwich depended heavily on the textile industry, which had suffered badly from the loss of export markets during the French Wars, and funds for improvements were limited. By the beginning of the 19thcentury the only significant improvement had been the paving of Gentleman's Walk. In 1805 a number of Improvement Commissions were established to propose solutions to the <b>problems</b> <b>facing</b> <b>the</b> area, but little action was taken. Local councils had no powers to levy rates to fund general civic improvements and as a consequence funds for improvement works had to be raised either through tolls and rents, via public appeals, or through long term borrowing, and the city was initially unable to raise sufficient funds.|$|E

5|$|Aside from non-military <b>problems</b> <b>facing</b> <b>the</b> junta, it {{also came}} into {{conflict}} with the Americans over political strategy, most notably as to whether armed force or politics should {{be the focus of}} efforts to end the communist threat to South Vietnam. Minh, the leading generals and Tho, favored a politically oriented solution, feeling that the deposal of Diệm and Nhu had created new possibilities for ending the insurgency of the National Liberation Front, or Viet Cong, mainly through an outreach program. They thought that military force would not be sufficient for Saigon, and that political means were more effective than using American firepower in making up for this. To the junta leaders, the rapid growth of the insurgency in Diệm's final year was due to it being seen as a rallying point and symbol of opposition to Diệm and Nhu, rather than an endorsement of the communists. The senior junta generals believed that with the Ngô brothers dead, the insurgency was now without its major focus of opposition, and therefore, motivation to operate in a vigorous way. To them, most of the insurgents were non-communist, with heavy elements of Cao Đài and Hòa Hảo religious sects or other opposition that had joined because of passionate anti-Diệm sentiment. Minh thus saw the post-Diệm period as an opportunity for grassroots political strengthening to undercut the NLF support base and force the remainder to integrate into mainstream society due to political realities.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. A {{challenging}} <b>problem</b> <b>facing</b> <b>the</b> clinician is {{the management}} of critically ill patients in whom repeated attempts at {{weaning from mechanical ventilation}} are unsuc-cessful. The difficulty weaning these patients from the venti-lator can be augmented in the presence of detraining of respi-ratory muscles, malnutrition, stress and the metabolic response to iniury, and/or immobilization. An understanding of basic concepts of established tenets of exercise physiology and of nutritional support will allow their application to respiratory muscle function with the goal of facilitating the endurance and strength of respiratory muscles needed to sustain spontaneous ventilation.
