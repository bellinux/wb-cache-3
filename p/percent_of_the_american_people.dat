Speaking from the conservative Protestant perspective, the Reverend Dr. Billy Graham said, [...] "n my opinion ... the Supreme Court ... is wrong. ... Eighty <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> want Bible reading and prayer in the schools. Why should a majority be so severely penalized ...?" [...] The mainline denominations, {{with the exception of}} the Roman Catholic Church, registered less critical opinions of the verdict, in fact seeing it as a boon to religious freedom by its very limiting of governmental authority in the sphere of public schools.|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 30 - 33) Television is {{the only}} source of news for sixty <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people.</b> This figure is likely to grow as newspapers fail, networks add more hours of news programming and cable television becomes more and more pervasive as a communications resource in the United States. The nature of television is such that through the manipulation of sound and picture those who control the content of television news program have it in their power to bring whatever bias they choose to the presentation of their news telecasts. Because of this situation, it is of utmost importance that the viewer, no matter how casual, possesses the tools necessary to recognize and evaluate that bias if and where it exists. It is to make a contribution toward satisfying this need that Tools of Bias was made the subject of this paper and the television tape which accompanies it. Tools of Bias is a teaching lesson in the recognition of bias as it exists in television news broadcasting. (See more in text. ...|$|E
40|$|Since the 2002 {{release of}} Richard Florida’s seminal book, The Rise of the Creative Class, a {{considerable}} amount of the regional and local development discussion has focused on his concept of attracting and retaining the creative class as a vehicle of economic growth. Florida’s (2002) work centers on the premise that contemporary development is not a process of attracting large employers but attracting talented people to an area; it is a process of jobs following people, not people following jobs. Although Florida has a primarily urban focus (Peck, 2005), with more than 59 million or 19. 3 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> living in rural areas, including nearly 12 percent of Illinoisans (U. S. Census Bureau, 2013), ignoring the impact of rural artists and creative activities comes at the detriment of local, state and national economic progress. With Florida in mind as an avenue to increasing economic activity in the region, the Paul Simon Public Policy Institute convened a day-long conference held at the Carbondale Civic Center April 29, 2014. As part of the conference the information contained in this paper was presented by Kent Dolezal, Lindsay Knaus and Nichole Sack. This paper’s purpose is to summarizes the concepts in those remarks and disseminate the information to a wider audience...|$|E
