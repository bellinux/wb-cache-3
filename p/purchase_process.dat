25|$|From a more {{academic}} {{point of}} view, Barak Libai, Eitan Muller and Renana Peres constructed a {{research in the}} subject which is {{among the first to}} shed light on the actual value created by word of mouth programs and explore issues such as how targeting opinion leaders creates more value than targeting random customers. In seeding programs, word-of-mouth can gain customers who would not otherwise have bought the product, this is called expansion. However, word-of-mouth can also accelerate the <b>purchase</b> <b>process</b> of customers who would have purchased anyway, the faster the adoption, the greater the profits. These processes of expansion and acceleration integrate to create social value in a word-of-mouth seeding program for a new product. Furthermore, when deciding upon an optimal seeding program, the researchers conclude that “Influencer Seeding Programs” yield higher customer equity than “random Seeding Programs”. Of course, the decision about which program type to adopt depends on how much the company is willing to invest in discovering their influencers.|$|E

The {{purpose of this}} thesis is to explore how {{the configuration of the}} <b>purchasing</b> <b>process</b> for freight transport services can influence the reduction of CO 2 emissions. This thesis is a compilation of three papers based on empirical data, collected mainly through interviews in three multiple-case studies. The results include descriptions of the <b>purchasing</b> <b>process</b> for freight transport services. Influence of the contextual dimensions purchase task, importance, and service type on the <b>purchasing</b> <b>process</b> for freight transport is discussed, and eight different types of contexts and their implications for the configuration of the <b>purchasing</b> <b>process</b> are presented. Relationships between the <b>purchasing</b> <b>process</b> for freight transport and logistical variables, related to CO 2 emissions, are identified. In particular, time requirements and information sharing are highlighted as important underlying aspects of the relationships. Different configurations of the <b>purchasing</b> <b>process</b> for freight transport services facilitate or hinder consideration of such aspects. The results lead to increased understanding of how contextual variables influence the configuration of the <b>purchasing</b> <b>process.</b> The results also contribute to theory on reducing negative effects of freight transport on the environment, by connecting practices to logistical variables that are related to CO 2 emissions, combining a <b>purchasing</b> <b>process</b> model with an existing framework that depicts the relationship between logistics and environmental effects. The results can be used by companies purchasing freight transport to support discussions aiming to reduce CO 2 emissions...|$|R
40|$|Background:China {{could be}} seemed {{as a highly}} {{developing}} country. There are many opportunities and challenges inChina. Its preferential policies and huge potential market attract a lot of foreign companies to come toChina. Meanwhile, Chinese government encourages the development of domestic enterprises. Therefore, at present there mainly coexist three forms of enterprises inChina: foreign-funded companies, private companies and state-controlling companies. In order to enhance competitiveness, almost every company in china has its own supply chain network. Supply Chain management {{plays an important role}} in Chinese companies. Research question: 1.      What is the current situation of <b>purchasing</b> <b>process</b> and <b>purchasing</b> <b>process</b> integration for some manufacturers of different ownerships in China?   2.      How can <b>purchasing</b> <b>process</b> be integrated for some manufacturers of different ownerships in China from manufacture’s perspectives?   Purpose: The purpose of this thesis is to study the current situation in <b>purchasing</b> <b>process</b> integration in Chinese manufacturing industry of three kinds of ownership and evaluate the <b>purchasing</b> <b>process</b> of three kinds of companies in China. In addition, it gives some suggestions to remove potential obstacles and optimize the purchasing process; and aims to help the companies to gain competitive advantage in the long term.   Method: The empirical foundation for this thesis is intended to be on multiple case study method. It studies of the three types of manufacturing enterprises in China. To represent these three types of companies, three companies are chosen from each as selected research objects. Data is collected through semi-structure interviews, so the questionnaire would be open-ended. Long-distance telephone interview with purchasing managers and material managers separately for each company would be adopted.   Conclusion: The <b>purchasing</b> <b>process</b> of three companies who represent three different types of ownership is studied. It studies the current situation in <b>purchasing</b> <b>process</b> integration in Chinese manufacturing industry of three kinds of ownership and evaluates the <b>purchasing</b> <b>process</b> of three kinds of companies in China. Then the obstacles in <b>purchasing</b> <b>process</b> are found out. Then suggestions on <b>purchasing</b> <b>process</b> integration are used to tackle these obstacles.   Future Work: This thesis focuses on three manufacturing companies in China. The result of this thesis cannot represent all the obstacles in <b>purchasing</b> <b>process</b> in manufacturing industry in China. But the <b>purchasing</b> <b>process,</b> characteristics, strength and weakness are similar in the same type of ownership. Meanwhile, the recommendation on <b>purchasing</b> <b>process</b> integration also cannot solve all the obstacles found, due to the companies’ own condition. In future research, it recommends to add more research companies. Furthermore, more studies could be included to identify common obstacles and dig out solutions related to <b>purchasing</b> <b>process</b> integration in Chinese manufacturing industry...|$|R

The sale was finalized in October 2015. The location was selected after an original proposal to construct the arena on Piers 30 and 32, just south of the Bay Bridge, met with vocal opposition due to concerns about traffic, environmental impacts and obstruction of views. The new location, which still faces some vocal opposition in San Francisco, apparently eliminates the need for any voter approval, which would have been required with the original site. Some type of waterfront park is planned across from the projected arena, which will be located at an already-existing Muni T-Third stop. The Central Subway, planned to open in 2018, may provide a direct connection between the new site and the downtown Powell Street Muni/BART station. The Golden State Warriors may consider a concurrent name change, possibly returning to their former name of San Francisco Warriors, although the team's recent success has them reconsidering that decision. On January 27, 2016, it was announced that the Warriors' new arena would be called Chase Center as part of an agreement with JPMorgan Chase.|$|E

40|$|This thesis was {{conducted}} on assignment by a multinational chemical corporation as a case study. The {{purpose of this study}} is to find ways to improve the <b>purchasing</b> <b>process</b> for small <b>purchases</b> at the case company. The improvements looked after are mainly cost and time savings. <b>Purchasing</b> <b>process</b> is the process that starts from the requisition of goods or services and ends when the invoice is paid. In this thesis the purchases with value less than 1000 € are considered to be small. The theoretical framework of the thesis consists of general theoretical view of costs and performance of the <b>purchasing</b> <b>process,</b> different types of <b>purchasing</b> <b>processes</b> and a model for improving <b>purchasing</b> <b>processes.</b> The categorization to small and large purchases is the most important followed by the division between direct and indirect purchases. Also models that provide more strategic perspective for categorization were found to be useful. Auditing and managerial control are important parts of the <b>purchasing</b> <b>process.</b> When considering the transaction costs of purchasing from the costs–benefits perspective large and small purchases should not have the same <b>processes.</b> <b>Purchasing</b> cards, e-procurement and vendor managed inventory are seen as an alternative to the traditional <b>purchasing</b> <b>process.</b> The empirical data collection was done by interviewing the company employees that take part of the <b>purchasing</b> <b>process</b> in their daily work. The interviews had open-ended questions and the answers were coded and analyzed. The results consist of process description and assessment as well as suggestions for potential improvements. At the case company the basic <b>purchasing</b> <b>process</b> was similar to the traditional <b>purchasing</b> <b>process</b> that is entirely done with computers and online. For some categories there was already more sophisticated e-procurement solutions in use. To improve the current e-procurement based solutions elimination of authorization workflow and better information exchange can be seen as potential improvements for most of the case purchases. Purchasing cards and a lightweight form of vendor managed inventory can be seen as potential improvements for some categories. Implementing the changes incurs at least some cost and the benefits might be hard to measure. This thesis has revealed that the small purchases have potential for significant cost and time savings at the case company...|$|R

40|$|Many {{retailers}} have moved toward strategies that use large assortments and/or customization {{in order to}} establish a competitive advantage. Large assortment strategies used by category killers can however backfire if the complexity causes information overload that aggravate customers’ <b>purchasing</b> decision <b>process.</b> In order to facilitate the <b>purchasing</b> <b>process</b> for customers, retailers can adopt a self-service strategy. This will enable customers to manage their decision-making easier without any help from personnel. Further, retailer can thereby achieve a high level of customer satisfaction {{at the same time as}} keeping costs down. However, if a department store uses a self-service strategy, the system needs to function smoothly or the store runs the risk of loosing potential customers. This study investigates three studios at IKEA’s two department stores in Gothenburg. It examines the customer satisfaction as well as functionality of the <b>purchasing</b> <b>process</b> within these studios.
