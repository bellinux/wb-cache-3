25|$|The Soviet Union, {{after long}} <b>peering</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> keyhole of {{a closed door}} on what it {{considered}} a Western sphere of influence, now found itself invited over the threshold {{as a friend of}} the Arabs. Shortly after it reopened, the canal was traversed by the first Soviet warships since World War I. The Soviets' burgeoning influence in the Middle East, although it was not to last, included acquiring Mediterranean bases, introducing multipurpose projects, supporting the budding Palestinian liberation movement and penetrating the Arab countries. Nasser claimed to be the defender of the Palestinian cause, but his anti-Israel warlike rhetoric damaged the Palestinians since it convinced a lot of the Israelis to oppose reconciliation with the Palestinians.|$|E
500|$|Scully and Bonsaint {{drive to}} the Turner home. Scully, <b>peering</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> windows, discovers Melissa {{attempting}} to {{set fire to the}} house, with her, her daughter and Chinga all trapped inside. Bonsaint breaks down the nailed door as Melissa runs to a closet and grabs hold of a hammer which she, against her will, turns upon herself. Thinking quickly, Scully grabs the Chinga doll and throws it inside a microwave oven in the kitchen. As the doll melts, Melissa drops the hammer and regains her senses. Returning to the office on Monday, Scully downplays any excitement or involvement regarding the case, insisting that she was only relaxing on her vacation. [...] In the final scene, a fisherman is seen pulling up a lobster trap, and in it is the burned doll, which comes back to life.|$|E
2500|$|On [...] "Something in the Way of Things (In Town)", Amiri Baraka {{performs}} {{a poem about}} how the spirit of death and decay permeates African-American urban experiences. Set to a fusion of several African-American music influences, his poem observes [...] "something {{in the way of}} our selves" [...] and uses unusual imagery such as death [...] "riding on top of the car <b>peering</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> windshield" [...] and a [...] "Negro squinting at us through the cage" [...] with a smile [...] "that ain't a smile but teeth flying against our necks".|$|E

2500|$|Her memoir, The Private Life of a Country House (1912–1939), recounts her {{childhood}} years at Pilgrims Hall, and forms {{a detailed account}} of upper-middle-class family life in a small English country house with servants before the Second World War. It first came out in 1980 and has since been reissued five times; the 2011 edition is associated with the National Trust. The Sunday Times describes it as a [...] "minor classic", and a review of the first edition states [...] "The charm of this book is that so many of the details of everyday life come alive and the more ordinary, prosaic things take on their true importance ... Reading it is rather like <b>peering</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> windows of a long-forgotten doll's house." [...] Her recollections have been quoted by several recent texts; Pamela Sambrook writes that Lewis is [...] "particularly successful at retrieving the memory of domestic trivia." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{he commented}} that the {{doughnuts}} were growing stale, Maud indifferently responded that because he had purchased them, he was obligated to finish them. [...] Frank, unwilling to eat the moldy doughnuts, buried the rest in the backyard. However, Maud, <b>peering</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> window, noticed his actions and immediately scooped them out. [...] "Dust off" [...] them, she gave one to Frank. [...] Annoyed, Frank told her he no longer wanted to eat the doughnuts because they were [...] "not fit to eat and you know it". [...] Maud rejoined that {{because he did not}} confer with her prior to buying the doughnuts, he had to eat them. [...] However, she told him, [...] "I'll let you off this time if you promise never again to buy any food unless I ask you to get it." [...] Frank consented, and the incident [...] "taught him a lesson he never forgot: that ... around the house she was the boss".|$|E
