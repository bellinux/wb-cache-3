50|$|Hart {{was born}} in Cairo, Illinois, the eldest of four children, and raised in Rochester, New York. His father managed a <b>printing</b> <b>roller</b> factory, and Hart worked there {{for a time in}} his teens but lost the job due to an {{explosion}} that took place when he was off sketching instead of watching the glue vats. Around the age of 18, he went to London on a cattle boat and while in England became an itinerant sign painter to support himself. Eventually he landed in Chicago, where he worked for a while as an illustrator for a newspaper and also as a sign painter for the Chicago World's Fair of 1893 and other clients. Although Hart was initially self-taught, in the 1890s he attended the Chicago Art Institute on and off for several years, and in 1907 he spent a year at the Académie Julien in Paris.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: With the {{development}} of numerically control and digital drive, it is a trend to put the Electronic Line-Shaft (ELS) technology into printing machine instead of the Mechanical Line-Shafting (MLS). After the shaftless reform of a printing machine for a factory, {{it was found that}} the printing accuracy and speed of most printing units was improved observably except the folding ripple. The paper analyzes the formation reason of folding ripple and the different characteristics between ELS and MLS. The research result shows that also there are many advantages in using ELS the synchronous capability is less than MLS when a periodic disturbance act on them under the same transmission stiffness. Therefore it is proposed that the AC motors must connect directly to the main <b>printing</b> <b>roller</b> to decrease the periodic disturbance and to increase the stiffness during the shaftless reform of printing machine...|$|E

40|$|Solar energy {{delivered}} by organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices {{has the potential}} to be a widely adopted source of sustainable electricity for a range of applications. Printing and coating technologies are being investigated as a means of quickly and cost effectively mass-producing OPV devices. This paper uses an analysis framework to review and assess the suitability of printing and coating technologies for delivering marketable OPV products. The analysis framework was developed by linking the OPV materials and fabrication method to the consumer requirements. The consumer requirements were {{delivered by}} the performance characteristics resulting from the device properties. These device properties were produced by the materials and fabrication method, including the printing/coating method. Specific criteria were developed for each of the stages and the interconnections were mapped to allow pathways between the fabrication technique and consumer requirements to be followed. The benefits and limitations of printing and coating processes were reviewed using the analysis framework for inkjet <b>printing,</b> <b>roller</b> printing, screen printing, pad printing, spin coating and spray coating, amongst others. Suitable processes were those that could meet the performance characteristics by the ability to produce nanoscale films, create set patterning and produce a variety of device sizes. The compatibility of the polymer physical properties with the printing/coating method was also important to achieve consistent products. The most suitable process for a particular application was dependent on the target device size and intended use. Identification of effective printing/coating techniques is necessary for rapid scale-up and commercially viable mass-manufacture of OPV products...|$|E

40|$|In 2008, a {{prototype}} machine demonstrating {{the application of}} roll-to-roll technology in micro-contact printing was developed. In this research, the prototype machine was upgraded by designing and machining a device that could fabricate a flat stamp with significantly less variance. The print roll wrapping system was reconfigured in order to capture the stamp with uniform force and good alignment. The motion control for the <b>print</b> <b>roller</b> and impression roller was also improved. In addition multi-layer printing with the updated machine was tested. This thesis focuses on the general design of the updated system and the measurement of key components of the systems {{as well as the}} print quality. Results demonstrate that the flat stamp can achieve the flatness of ± 16 [micro]m with thickness of 1194 [micro]m; that the wrapping process can guarantee a <b>print</b> <b>roller</b> roundness error in the 20 [micro]m range; that the distortion of the print using the updated system is approximately 3. 8. The multi-layer printing test did not achieve acceptable results owing to a lack of proper control of the machine. However, initial trials, achieved alignment errors of 1017 [micro]m along the printing direction and 113 [micro]m across the printing direction. by Wenzhuo Yang. Thesis (M. Eng.)

40|$|Microcontact {{printing}} {{is based}} on the use of elastomeric stamps to transfer ink onto a substrate taking advantage of the self-assembly process. Features as small as 300 nm can be easily printed over an extended area. The accuracy and the speed of the process make it suitable for many industrial applications in areas such as the manufacture of flexible displays and electronics. In 2008, a group of MIT mechanical engineering students built a prototype machine that demonstrated the advantages of the roll-to-roll paradigm in terms of high throughput, convenient material handling and conformal contact propagation. The prototype machine, although characterized by defects such as air trapping at very high speed, was able to print at speeds as high as 400 fpm with contact times of 7 ms, over an 8 "x 8 " substrate area. This year, an improved quality printing output and multilayer printing process were set as goals. To achieve the objectives, a device that could cast a flat stamp with little variance was designed and machined. (cont.) A high precision wrapping system was designed and fabricated. Finally, a high-precision positioning system was introduced to compensate for misalignment in the multi-layer printing process. This thesis describes the design of a five-axis high-precision positioning system to control the <b>print</b> <b>roller</b> along five degrees of freedom. Using flexures and micrometer heads as principal position control devices, the <b>print</b> <b>roller</b> can be positioned and oriented with high repeatability, 2. 5 lim accuracy, 2. 5 pm resolution, and the calibration showed that, in the worst case, the coupling among axes is limited to the 8 %. Moreover, experimental results demonstrate that the new stamp casting method can accomplish ± 16 p. m flatness with thickness of 1194 pm and that the innovative wrapping process ensures alignment of the backing plate with respect to the <b>print</b> <b>roller</b> with less than ± 75 V 1 m absolute misalignment. Consequently, using the upgraded roll-to-roll machine and the newly developed wrapping and stamp fabrication processes, deformation of the printed output is limited to an average of 3. 8 %. Finally, the multi-layer printing process was tested and a ± 75 V 1 m misalignment was achieved between two layers. by Paolo Baldesi. Thesis (M. Eng.)

40|$|Microcontact {{printing}} is {{an emerging}} printing technique {{that could potentially}} find application in the electronics industry. High-speed roll-to-roll equipment was built at Nano Terra, Inc in 2008, for microcontact printing. However, the equipment was a proof-of-concept, capable of single-layer printing, while the industry requires a multi-layer printing capability. In addition, the quality of printing it delivered was not industry competitive. The existing equipment has thus been upgraded {{with a view to}} achieve high-precision multi-layer microcontact printing; including a new method to manufacture a flat stamp, design of a high-precision wrapping system, design of a five-axis positioning system, and modification of the impression roller.
