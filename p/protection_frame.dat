As an ethnic group with a unique historical relationship with the United States government, Hmong former refugees have regularly engaged in protests in response to perceived political threats, political opportunities, or both. Using cataloged English-language newspapers, this study examines the characteristics, forms and collective action frames of 84 Hmong American-led protest events in the United States between 1980 and 2010. The evidence indicates that Hmong American protests emerged in the 1990 s, coinciding with their formation of socioeconomically mobile ethnic communities, and continued to increase in frequency throughout the 2000 s particularly in places with substantial concentrations of Hmong. Although most Hmong protest events involved demonstrations, these events varied greatly {{in terms of their}} targets and issues. During the past 30 - 35 years, Hmong American cycles of protest have produced three master frames: the refugee <b>protection</b> <b>frame,</b> the military service frame, and the civil rights frame.

As described in the MIL-DTL- 27422, the drop impact test must be conducted to check the dynamic response of the fuel tank.

Anghileri (1998) preliminary investigated the crashworthiness of fuel tank by means of experiments and simulations. Numerical models for the analysis of water sloshing in a fuel tank during crash was developed and verified by experimental results, which generates four different models to simulate the water inside the tank (Anghileri et al. 2005). Li et al.

40|$|When {{the first}} boats sank {{off the coast}} of Lampedusa, Italy, the debate about {{refugees}} and migration started {{to become one of the}} most widely discussed issues in mass media and therefore in communication studies again. The concept of framing becomes relevant when investigating the depiction of certain events and issues in news coverage. However, it still lacks a coherent definition. Most recently, it has been argued that a consideration of further elements is necessary in order to restructure the concept. Thus, the present case-study focuses on a combination of linguistic elements used in recent migration discourse and a potential impact of language on news frames. The results of a combined frame and corpus-based analysis of the German Süddeutsche Zeitung and the English Guardian show that connotation of key words used in news frames about the Lampedusa incident between October 2013 and October 2014 diverge from the orientation of news frames. Although approximately two thirds of the examined articles use <b>protection</b> <b>frames,</b> the majority of the identified key words describing refugees is connoted negatively.
