5|$|In September, Saville told Secretary of Defense James Forrestal, Secretary of the Air Force Stuart Symington, and the {{assembled}} Air Force staff that America's air defenses were wholly inadequate. The Chiefs of Staff agreed that air defense {{was second in}} importance only to a strong retaliation force, one that would give <b>pause</b> <b>to</b> an aggressor. In November, Saville was named commanding general of ADC. He worked to combine it with Tactical Air Command (TAC) to form {{the backbone of the}} Continental Air Command (CONAC) organization. In February 1949, Saville updated the House Armed Services Committee on the necessity of radar air defense, and in March the Lashup plan was approved by Congress.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the outer}} {{defenses}} were gradually moved inward, thereby sacrificing a vital {{foothold in the}} steppe transitional zone. Despite the withdrawal from the steppe, the Ming military remained in a strong position against the nomads until the Tumu Crisis in 1449, which caused {{the collapse of the}} early Ming security system. Over half of the campaigning Chinese army perished in the conflict, while the Mongols captured the Zhengtong Emperor. This military debacle shattered the Chinese military might that had so impressed and given <b>pause</b> <b>to</b> the Mongols {{since the beginning of the}} dynasty, and caused the Ming to be on the defensive ever after.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{greatest}} differences between the solitary and gregarious phases is behavioural. The gregaria nymphs are attracted to each other, this being seen {{as early as the}} second instar. They soon form bands of many thousands of individuals. These groups behave like cohesive units and move across the landscape, mostly downhill, but making their way round barriers and merging with other bands. The attraction between the insects seems to be largely visual, but also involves olfactory cues, and the band seem to navigate using the sun. They <b>pause</b> <b>to</b> feed at intervals before resuming their march, and may cover tens of kilometres over a few weeks.|$|E

5|$|Marta {{continues}} {{running in}} the direction she believes will lead back to Pleasant Valley, swimming across Middle Fork River, crossing the nearby highway and railroad tracks, and running through various woodlands in between. Pausing only to drink water and tend her paws, she crosses Pyramid Peak and swims across the Hungry Horse Reservoir, before a week without food and exhaustion cause her to collapse on the shore. After resting, she continues her run, though hunger now spurs her to <b>pause</b> <b>to</b> hunt when she can but she eventually collapses by Flathead Lake, where she remains unconscious for days. Meanwhile, unskilled at hunting and without the adults {{to teach them how}} to survive, Annie and Sula slowly starve to death. Oldtooth reaches Middle Fork Valley, where illness and his lame foot drive him to hunt local livestock. He is shot and killed by a human.|$|E

25|$|During play, {{the umpire}} at the bowler's end makes the decisions, which he mainly {{indicates}} using arm movements.

25|$|Free-motion machine {{embroidery}} can be time-consuming. Since {{a standard}} sewing machine {{has only one}} needle, the operator must <b>pause</b> <b>to</b> re-thread the machine manually for each subsequent color in a multi-color design. He or she must also manually trim and clean up loose or connecting threads after the design is completed.|$|E

25|$|The Operation Millpond B-26s {{had been}} {{scheduled}} to strike at Kong Le, but the strike was stayed by an event {{on the far side of}} the world. The Bay of Pigs Invasion failed, and that failure gave <b>pause</b> <b>to</b> U.S. actions in Laos. A ceasefire was sought. Simultaneously, the Programs Evaluation Office shed its civilian guise and went above ground to become a Military Advisory Assistance Group. Emblematic of the change, the Hotfoot teams donned their U.S. uniforms and became White Star Mobile Training Teams.|$|E

25|$|Another form of {{this theory}} is that a very early copyist, {{preparing}} a Gospels-codex for liturgical use, transplanted the section {{to the end of}} John as a practical step, so as to simplify the lector's task on Pentecost (so that the lector would not have to <b>pause</b> <b>to</b> find the final portion of the lection), and after the section was thus transplanted, it dropped out altogether from the Alexandrian transmission-line which is represented by the oldest manuscripts, and from related branches (including one which later yielded, or influenced, the Syriac Peshitta).|$|E
25|$|In early May, Bonaparte's French army won {{the battles}} of Fombio and Lodi and overran the Austrian {{province}} of Lombardy. Beaulieu evacuated Milan {{except for a}} 2,000-man garrison that he left in the citadel. In mid-May, the French occupied Milan and Brescia. At this time, the army had to <b>pause</b> <b>to</b> put down a revolt in Pavia. At the village of Binasco, the French atrociously massacred the adult male population. Beaulieu pulled his army back behind the Mincio, with strong patrols west of the river. He urgently {{tried to put the}} fortress of Mantua into a state where it could sustain a siege.|$|E
25|$|By 28 July, GM 16 from Muang Soui encamped on the {{mountain}} {{just east of the}} Route 7/13 intersection. GM 11 was only a hill away to the north. There was a <b>pause</b> <b>to</b> coordinate action between the two columns. The following day, three ADC companies of irregulars led by CIA case officer Tony Poe were heli-lifted into Sala Phou Khoun by Air America. On impulse, Poe ignored CIA restrictions on engaging in combat, and led his troops in the unauthorized assault. At 2100 hours, the three companies of guerrillas occupied the empty intersection. GM 11 and GM 16 did not move in until the following day.|$|E

25|$|About {{halfway through}} the book, Cochran and Harpending <b>pause</b> <b>to</b> {{consider}} two different {{ways of looking at}} the information found in gene variants. Researchers commonly see them merely as markers of human migration, ignoring their functions. The authors support such research, but argue for a more complete understanding of the geographic distributions of genes. Where the usual geographical analysis treats the distribution of genes as an effect of history, in the authors' view, the genes themselves are a major cause: Two variants in the same gene do not necessarily have the same effect, and their relative, selective benefits will control the spread of genes through populations in both space and time.|$|E
25|$|Tinamous {{form one}} of the most {{terrestrial}} groups of flying birds, spending virtually all of their time on the ground. They walk silently, pausing frequently in mid-stride. When a potential threat is detected, a tinamou will typically freeze in one of two positions, either crouched or with its neck extended upwards. As far as possible, they will avoid resorting to flight by stealthy walking or running away from danger as well as by concealment in dense vegetation. They may then <b>pause</b> <b>to</b> observe the cause of their alarm from cover. They also hide in burrows. Their cryptic behavior has allowed them to survive or even thrive in areas where guans have been extirpated.|$|E
25|$|After {{participating}} in the Tullahoma campaign's maneuvers, the Regular Brigade had spent its time drilling and then repairing roads and guarding railroad lines. After a <b>pause</b> <b>to</b> regroup, Rosecrans moved his army again on August 16, 1863 across the Cumberland Plateau to the Tennessee River and Sequatchie River banks. In early September 1863, the Army of the Cumberland began to advance on Chattanooga. With Thomas's and McCook's corps threatening his supply lines, Bragg evacuated Chattanooga on September 8, 1863. On September 10, 1863, the Regular Brigade crossed the Tennessee River at Bridgeport, Alabama with General King in command. Captain Albert B. Dod had joined the 15th U.S. Infantry and, since he outranked Captain Keteltas, assumed command of the 1st Battalion while Keteltas resumed command of Company E.|$|E

25|$|The Balloon Corps was {{reassigned to}} the Engineers Corps. Lowe {{had been paid}} as a colonel ($10 gold per day), but in March 1863, Captain Comstock {{was put in charge}} of the newly reassigned air {{division}} and cut Lowe's pay to $6 cash ($3 gold). At the same time, a Congressional assessment was being made of the air division and a disparaging third party report, which Lowe refuted in a lengthy response, gave <b>pause</b> <b>to</b> the Union commanders for further use of balloons. In addition, Lowe's appointments of personnel independent of the engineer officers had strained his relations with the military. Lowe tendered his resignation in May 1863 and the Allen brothers took charge of the Balloon Corps, but by August, the Corps had ceased to exist.|$|E
25|$|Roland and his ka-tet {{travel to}} Thunderclap, {{then to the}} nearby Devar-Toi, to stop a group of psychics known as Breakers who are {{allowing}} their telepathic abilities {{to be used to}} break away at the beams that support the Tower. Ted Brautigan and Dinky Earnshaw assist the gunslingers with information and weapons, and reunite Roland with his old friend Sheemie Ruiz from Mejis. The Gunslingers free the Breakers from their captors, but Eddie is wounded after the battle and dies a short while later. Roland and Jake <b>pause</b> <b>to</b> mourn and then jump to Maine of 1999 along with Oy, in order {{to save the life of}} Stephen King (whom he writes to be an omniscient secondary character in the book); the ka-tet have come to believe that the success of their quest depends on King surviving to write about it through his books.|$|E
25|$|Estonia {{was soon}} occupied, and {{refugees}} were evacuated {{further into the}} inner Russian provinces. Most of the Scouts were among the refugees. This {{was the end of}} Scouting in these towns, but not in the larger centers. In Tartu, the second largest city in Estonia and the seat of a 300-year-old university, Scout troops were organized at every large school with no other aid than a Russian translation of Baden-Powell's 'Scouting for Boys' and some consultation with a visiting Scouts in uniform from Pärnu. A few patrols of these troops were even able to continue their activities when Scouting was banned during the following German occupation. The Estonian War of Liberation, however, brought a <b>pause</b> <b>to</b> Scouting in Tartu as most boys over 16 (many even younger) volunteered for the fighting forces. But they restored their troops and patrols {{as soon as they were}} able to return to their school benches; one of these Scouts, now in the United States, is still active among Scouts of Estonian extraction.|$|E
