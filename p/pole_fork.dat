50|$|The {{traditional}} lavvu {{consists of}} two types of wooden poles: 1) three or more <b>forked</b> <b>poles</b> and; 2) several straight <b>poles.</b> The <b>forked</b> <b>poles</b> have a two-stem fork at the top end. These three poles are interlocked so that they form a tripod. Upon this assembly of the <b>forked</b> <b>poles,</b> the straight poles are laid in a circular fashion. Reindeer hides were used as a cover until the mid-19th century when large amounts of inexpensive manufactured British textiles were {{made available to the}} Sami.|$|R

60|$|This man {{was very}} clever and quick to learn {{anything}} in his line. Our tent {{was of a}} kind new to him, but when he had once seen it pitched it was surprising how quickly he would find and prepare the <b>pole</b> and <b>forked</b> stakes to pitch it with, cutting and placing them right the first time, though I am sure {{that the majority of}} white men would have blundered several times.|$|R
60|$|The {{furniture}} of {{the cabins}} was, like the clothing of the pioneers, homemade. A bedstead was contrived by stretching <b>poles</b> from <b>forked</b> sticks {{driven into the}} ground, and laying clapboards across them; the bedclothes were bearskins. Stools, benches, and tables were roughed out with auger and broadax; the puncheon floor was left bare, and if the earth formed the floor, no rug ever replaced the grass which was its first carpet. The cabin had but one room where the whole of life went on by day; the father and mother slept there at night, and the children mounted to their chamber in the loft {{by means of a}} ladder.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of a Pima Indian woman, Si-Rup, {{sitting down}} before {{carrying}} firewood in her "Kathak", or basket, Pima, Arizona, 1904. The conical basket hangs from a strap slung {{around the top}} of her head. She wears a light skirt and shirt. A long <b>pole</b> with a <b>fork</b> on the end helps her to put on the kathak. A native dwelling roughly constructed of vertical posts, horizonal beams and a thatched roof is visible behind her. Scattered about the ground are pots, clothing, and other household items...|$|R
50|$|Anthropomorphic wooden cult figurines, {{sometimes}} called pole gods, {{have been found}} at many archaeological sites in Central and Northern Europe. They are generally interpreted as cult images, in some cases presumably depicting deities, sometimes with either a votive or an apotropaic (protective) function. Many have been preserved in peat bogs. The majority {{are more or less}} crudely worked <b>poles</b> or <b>forked</b> sticks; some take the form of carved planks. They have been dated to periods from the Mesolithic to the Early Middle Ages, including the Roman Era and the Migration Age. The majority have been found in areas of Germanic settlement, but some are from areas of Celtic settlement and from the later part of the date range, Slavic settlement. A typology has been developed based on the large number found at Oberdorla, Thuringia, at a sacrificial bog which is now the Opfermoor Vogtei open-air museum.|$|R
50|$|Witches {{were said}} to fly mounted on <b>forks,</b> <b>poles,</b> and {{especially}} brooms; in each case, the flying object was first anointed with an unguent provided by the Devil. It was said that, because in the past witches were always persecuted and garroted with brooms, the Devil had given them this particular power {{in order to be}} able to escape. While they fly, they supposedly would repeat, over and over"Per ací, per allà, cap ací, cap allà", ("Here, there, hence, thence") as if they were in a cavalcade of animals.|$|R
60|$|The ostrich {{is easily}} {{killed by a}} blow on the neck with a stout stick, but this is as {{objectionable}} as the choking process, on the ground of cost. In short, the only legitimate method of meeting a savage papa, in his own field, is with a strong <b>forked</b> <b>pole</b> eight or nine feet long, with which you catch the bird {{at the root of}} the neck, and thus keeping him at pole's-length, let him kick and hiss away to his heart's content till he is tired, or until assistance comes to you, or until you work him near a wall, when you may jump over and escape, for an ostrich will not jump.|$|R
60|$|Then this {{concentrated}} brew {{is mixed}} in a long, deep vat with cubic gallons of hot water, and the sheep are caught by their hind legs and flung into the compound. After being thoroughly ducked {{by means of}} a <b>forked</b> <b>pole</b> {{in the hands of a}} gentleman detailed for that purpose, they are allowed to clamber up an incline into a corral and dry or die, as the state of their constitutions may decree. If you ever caught an able-bodied, two-year-old mutton by the hind legs and felt the 750 volts of kicking that he can send though your arm seventeen times before you can hurl him into the vat, you will, of course, hope that he may die instead of dry.|$|R
5000|$|The Luna Jacal or Luna's Jacal was the {{residence}} of Gilberto Luna, a Mexican pioneer farmer {{in the area of}} Texas that would become Big Bend National Park. The jacal, an indigenous Tejano dwelling suited to the desert environment, was built about 1890 [...] with a low sandstone and limestone wall about 4 ft, with <b>forked</b> <b>poles</b> set upright into the walls, supporting roof poles. The house backs up to a large boulder. A heavier line of poles extends the length of the jacal. The roof was made of ocotillo branches weighted down with earth and stones, presently replaced with an inappropriate soil-cement roof. Luna raised a large family at the jacal, peacefully coexisting with otherwise hostile Comanche who used the Alamo Creek area as a war trail. Luna died there in 1947 at age 108 or 109.|$|R
60|$|Half the night, {{shouting}} and yelling, barking dogs, hauling of sleds and cracking of dried-skin tepees murdered sleep {{for those in}} the cabin. In the morning the level plain and edge of the forest held an Indian village. Caribou hides, strung on <b>forked</b> <b>poles,</b> constituted tent-like habitations with no distinguishable doors. Fires smoked in the holes in the snow. Not till late in the day did any life manifest itself round the tepees, and then a group of children, poorly clad in ragged pieces of blankets and skins, gaped at Jones. He saw their pinched, brown faces, staring, hungry eyes, naked legs and throats, and noted particularly their dwarfish size. When he spoke they fled precipitously a little way, then turned. He called again, and all ran except one small lad. Jones went into the cabin and came out with a handful of sugar in square lumps.|$|R
60|$|When he had {{had enough}} of this it {{occurred}} to Loveday that he might get into the house in spite of the locked doors; and by entering the garden, placing a <b>pole</b> from the <b>fork</b> of an apple-tree to the window-sill of a bedroom on that side, and climbing across like a Barbary ape, he entered the window and stepped down inside. There was something anomalous in being close to the familiar furniture without having first seen his father, and its silent, impassive shine was not cheering; it was as if his relations were all dead, and only their tables and chests of drawers left to greet him. He went downstairs and seated himself in the dark parlour. Finding this place, too, rather solitary, and the tick of the invisible clock preternaturally loud, he unearthed the tinder-box, obtained a light, and set about making the house comfortable for his father's return, divining that the miller had gone out to meet him by the wrong road.|$|R
50|$|The three dip nets {{were shaped}} like bags. One type, called taláka'yi, was {{suspended}} on the prongs of a <b>forked</b> <b>pole,</b> {{and was used}} from a canoe, land, or from wading and was used for catching suckers, trout and pike. Another dip net, a tamichi, was used only for fishing suckers. The tamichi was four to five feet deep and wide when closed. The mesh at the lower edge of the bags opening are threaded along a stick which is then placed in the water to catch the fish. The fisherman would wade in the water while moving the net while women and children would wade pushing the fish towards the fisherman. When the fish enter the net, the fisherman releases the bag which then closes. The third bag, the lipake, was small with an oval hoop sewn into the opening. The fisherman would dive {{into the water and}} would hold the net in one hand while driving the suckers in with his free hand. Upon succeeding at capturing the fish, the fisherman would then flip the hoop over the net to close it for safe capture.|$|R
5000|$|They {{are first}} {{mentioned}} by the 1st century AD historian, Tacitus. Under {{the reign of}} the 2nd Roman Emperor, Tiberius, a faction of Treveri led by Julius Florus, and the Aedui, led by Julius Sacrovir, led a rebellion of Gaulish debtors against the Romans in 21 CE. The Crupellarii, heavily armoured Gallic gladiators, fought against Roman legionaries."In addition were some slaves who were being trained for gladiators, clad after the national fashion in a complete covering of steel. They were called crupellarii, and though they were ill-adapted for inflicting wounds, they were impenetrable to them...""...the cavalry threw itself on the flanks, and the infantry charged the van. On the wings there was but a brief resistance. The men in mail were somewhat of an obstacle, as the iron plates did not yield to javelins or swords; but our men, snatching up hatchets and pickaxes, hacked at their bodies and their armour as if they were battering a wall. Some beat down the unwieldy mass with pikes and <b>forked</b> <b>poles,</b> and they were left lying on the ground, without an effort to rise, like dead men." ...|$|R
