5|$|Abe refines this <b>proof-of-concept</b> {{and builds}} a stable time-apparatus ("the box"), sized to {{accommodate}} a human subject. Abe uses this box to travel six hours into his own past—as part of this process, Original-Abe sits incommunicado in a hotel room, {{so as not to}} interact or interfere with the outside world, after which Original-Abe enters the box, waits inside the box for six hours (thus going back in time six hours), and becomes Future-Abe, who travels across town, explains the proceedings to Aaron, and brings Aaron back to the self-storage facility housing the box. At the end of the overlap-timespan, Original-Abe enters the box and ceases to exist.|$|E

Engineering complex service-oriented systems {{presents}} grand challenges due {{to their}} great complexity, volatility, and uncertainty in their rapidly evolving technology and social contexts.

This paper proposes an approach called Organic Aggregation Service Engineering Framework (OASEF). Experience from <b>proof-of-concepts</b> case studies shows that it provides a practical means to develop service-oriented systems. It enables and promotes a focus on higher-level intellectual engineering efforts, and provides a mechanism to capture and reuse engineering capacities in a model-driven environment...|$|R

In 2002, Canadian company General Fusion began <b>proof-of-concept</b> experiments based on a hybrid magneto-inertial approach called Magnetized Target Fusion.

30|$|Hyperjacking A hyperjacking attack {{tries to}} take control of the {{hypervisor}} that manages the virtual environment. This is possible when attacker injects an hypervisor beneath the original one, or has direct access to the original hypervisor. Hijacking an Operating System (OS) using a hypervisor is associated to the emergence of VM-based rootkit (VMBR) with Subvirt, Vitriol and Blue Pill as illustrating <b>proof-of-concepts</b> [33]. When the target is the host OS, hyperjacking becomes a serious attack as once the hypervisor is owned, attacker can take full control of the environment, and use any guest OS as a staging ground to attack other guests.|$|R
