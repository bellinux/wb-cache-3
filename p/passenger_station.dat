5|$|Ashford {{has been}} a {{communications}} hub and has stood at the centre of five railway lines since the 19th century. The arrival of the railways became a source of employment {{and contributed to the}} town's growth. With the opening of the international <b>passenger</b> <b>station</b> it is now a European communications centre, with new lines running between London and the Channel Tunnel (via High Speed 1). The M20 motorway also links Ashford to those two destinations for road traffic.|$|E
5|$|The Mount Loretto Spur is an {{abandoned}} {{branch of the}} Staten Island Railway whose purpose was to serve the Mount Loretto Children's Home. The spur diverged off of the Main Line south of Pleasant Plains. The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad served the Mount Loretto non-electrified branch until 1950, which had some industry and a <b>passenger</b> <b>station.</b> The Mount Loretto branch track was removed in the 1960s and 1970s but some ties were visible until the 1980s. A coal dump trestle is all that remains, located behind the powerhouse.|$|E

5|$|After construction, {{the station}} {{served as the}} PRR's sole Philadelphia stop for most long-distance east-west Main Line traffic to avoid a reverse move into Broad Street Station (and later 30th Street Station). It also served local trains from Fort Washington, Chestnut Hill, Bustleton, and Trenton, {{as well as a}} variety of {{services}} from the PRR-owned West Jersey and Seashore Railroad system. Within a decade of completion, the station was already overcrowded. On June 22, 1912, the PRR signed a million-dollar contract for massive renovations to the station. Designed by PRR architect William H. Cookman, the modifications reflected the latest in <b>passenger</b> <b>station</b> design.|$|E
5|$|NY410 {{begins at}} a rural {{intersection}} with NY26 {{in the town}} of Denmark. The two-lane route heads eastward from the junction, winding to the north and south across open, rolling terrain with several cultivated fields. After , the highway meets County Route19 (CR19, named East Road) and turns to the northeast toward the village of Castorland. The open fields gradually give way to homes as NY410 enters the village limits as Main Street. The route passes {{through the center of the}} village, serving four lightly developed residential blocks before crossing the Mohawk, Adirondack and Northern Railroad at the northeastern edge of the community. At the rail crossing, the highway passes south of what was once the New York Central Railroad's Castorland <b>passenger</b> <b>station.</b>|$|E
5|$|Opposition to the {{railroad}} line returning to service included {{that it would}} be as much of a problem to downtown traffic as the container trucks and that the noise would be a disturbance to nearby residents. As with before, however, trains are occasional and reserved for specialty loads, such as oversized loads and hazardous materials, which will be banned from the tunnel. It was also stated that the trains, which will be able to go up to 30mph on the newly renovated line versus the old limit of 5mph, will be able to cross Biscayne Boulevard in 90 seconds. The current plan is for the line to be strictly for intermodal services, with the project including a rail yard and station at the port, however, in the future a <b>passenger</b> <b>station</b> may be added.|$|E

5|$|Presiding Justice Edward Lazansky (joined by Justice J. Addison Young) wrote a dissent. Lazansky, {{the son of}} Czech immigrants, {{had been}} elected New York Secretary of State as a Democrat in 1910. Elected to the Supreme Court in 1917, he had been {{designated}} presiding justice of the Second Department by Governor Smith earlier in 1927. Lazansky did not question the jury finding of negligence, but felt that the employees' conduct was not the proximate cause of Palsgraf's injuries, since the man's conduct in bringing a package that might explode to a crowded <b>passenger</b> <b>station</b> was an independent act of negligence, rendering the neglect by the railroad too remote in causation {{for there to be}} liability.|$|E
5|$|The {{station at}} Brattøra has had four names, {{following}} the name {{changes of the}} city. It was opened as Throndhjem, changed in 1894 to Trondhjem, on 1 January 1930 to Nidaros and to Trondheim on 6 March 1931. The station at Brattøra is physically divided in two parts by the bridge over Ravnkloa. From 1884, the western part was officially called Throndhjem V and the eastern part Throndhjem Ø. The freight station for the Røros Line was located at Throndhjem V, while the <b>passenger</b> <b>station</b> for both lines was located at Throndhjem Ø, just like today. While there were two stations in 1882–84, they were 'probably' referred to as Brattøra and Kalvskinnet.|$|E
5|$|In 1895, the Fitchburg and B {{demolished}} the 1848-built union station. Two new station buildings {{opened to}} replace it: a <b>passenger</b> <b>station</b> (the {{centerpiece of the}} new Depot Square) in {{the northeast corner of}} the junction, and a freight station in the southeast which replaced the formerly separate freight houses. In 1897, the junction of the P was relocated slightly to the west to eliminate angled grade crossings of Main Street and Park Street. An island platform was constructed around that time between the two Fitchburg main tracks east of the diamond crossing to serve commuters to Boston. In 1906, East Main Street was rerouted onto a bridge east of the station, eliminating traffic problems caused when trains blocked the grade crossing. The old Stony Brook freight house and engine house were removed as part of the construction. Two signal bridges built at right angles over the junction in the 1910s and an interlocking tower built in 1929 controlled the various train movements across the complex junction.|$|E

5|$|Just beyond East Norwood, the Pennsylvania built McCullough Yard in 1927, {{improving}} switching {{operations for}} the growing industrial base in Norwood. A connection was included to the Pennsylvania's Chicago-bound Richmond Branch, which the CL crossed over north of the yard. In Butler County, north of Brecon, the CL curved abruptly northeast onto the original line, partially graded in the 1850s between Sharonville and Lebanon. Just beyond, it began to descend slowly through Mason to Hageman, where it crossed the Middletown Branch, and then rose slightly, alongside Turtle Creek, to Lebanon. The Pennsylvania tore down the original Lebanon <b>passenger</b> <b>station</b> in 1960, replacing it (for freight purposes) with a smaller building from Kings Mills on the Little Miami Railroad. The Lebanon Council of Garden Clubs acquired the land in 1972, tore down the freight depot, and erected {{a replica of the}} old passenger depot in its place, with a gift shop inside.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of the line was prompted by the need of mine owners around Guisborough and East Cleveland to transport their iron ore to the River Tees. Guisborough was already served by the Middlesbrough and Guisborough Railway (M), {{a subsidiary of the}} Stockton and Darlington (S), which had built a line (opened in 1854) running along the south of the valley in which Guisborough sits. However, the line was an inconveniently long distance from the lucrative iron ore mines in the north of the valley, along the south flank of the Eston Hills, and provided no connection at all for mines east of Guisborough. The M had been built by a group of industrialists based in Stockton and Darlington who used it to service their own mines, deliberately avoiding the estates of their rivals. It only provided a minimal passenger service to Middlesbrough – one train a day each way – and the line had originally not even been planned to have a <b>passenger</b> <b>station</b> in Guisborough.|$|E
