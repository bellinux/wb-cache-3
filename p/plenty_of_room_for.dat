5|$|This pyramid was {{the last}} pyramid ever built {{as part of a}} {{mortuary}} complex in Egypt. The pyramid would be abandoned by subsequent pharaohs of the New Kingdom, for both practical and religious reasons. The Giza plateau offered <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> building pyramids; but {{this was not the case}} with the confined, cliff-bound geography of Thebes and any burials in the surrounding desert were vulnerable to flooding. The pyramid form was associated with the sun god Re, who had been overshadowed by Amun in importance. One of the meanings of Amun's name was the hidden one, which meant that it was now theologically permissible to hide the Pharaoh's tomb by fully separating the mortuary template from the actual burial place. This provided the added advantage that the resting place of the pharaoh could be kept hidden from necropolis robbers. All subsequent pharaohs of the New Kingdom would be buried in rock-cut shaft tombs in the Valley of the Kings.|$|E

25|$|The {{best known}} case of {{possible}} homosexuality in ancient Egypt {{is that of}} the two high officials Nyankh-Khnum and Khnum-hotep. Both men lived and served under pharaoh Niuserre during the 5th Dynasty (c. 24942345 BC). Nyankh-Khnum and Khnum-hotep each had families of their own with children and wives, but when they died their families apparently decided to bury them together in one and the same mastaba tomb. In this mastaba, several paintings depict both men embracing each other and touching their faces nose-on-nose. These depictions leave <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> speculation, because in ancient Egypt the nose-on-nose touching normally represented a kiss.|$|E

25|$|Griffith Stadium hosted {{numerous}} football events {{before the}} Redskins moved there in 1937. It {{was the home}} of Georgetown Hoyas football from 1921 until 1950, George Washington Colonials football in the 1930s and 1940s, and Maryland Terrapins football in 1948. The stadium was the host of an annual Thanksgiving Day game between Howard and Lincoln Universities, {{which was one of}} the most popular events during the year, drawing many African American alumni and fans from the surrounding neighborhoods. One major reason for the stadium's early-1920s expansion was that Clark Griffith had envisioned the stadium hosting the annual Army–Navy football game, played every December. Temporary seats were often placed in right field for football games at Griffith, with the gridiron stretching from left field to the first base line. The exceptional distance from home to the left-field area allowed <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> the football field.|$|E
25|$|Other castles {{begun in}} the 11th century were built on {{elevated}} sites that {{took advantage of the}} steep slopes for defense, rather than on moats. The central tower became the final defensive layer of the castle, while the main domestic quarters were built against the walls around the perimeter, allowing <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> a variety of functions. Conisborough Castle is an English example, with the shell keep rising on the earlier motte, and a wall with the residential and service quarters built into it, enclosing the bailey. The ruins within the bailey show remains of a great hall with central fireplace, a kitchen and a two storeyed residential block with adjacent latrines. The keep itself contains a room for the lord, complete with a hooded fireplace, while a small vaulted chapel was built into the thick outer wall of the keep. Ludlow Castle, Shropshire {{begun in the}} 11th century, was lived in by a number of members of the Tudor royal family and had both its fortifications and living quarters improved over several centuries.|$|E
25|$|At 1:50 pm, {{the troops}} of A/27/9 AIB {{set out for}} the town. Thirty minutes later, Engemen led the 17 tanks of A/14/9 AIB forward. The troops and tanks arrived {{at about the same time}} and {{advanced}} quickly through Remagen against light resistance. The Germans relied for local defense on Volksturm, citizens who were conscripted close to their homes in the belief that they would defend their towns and villages. German defensive policy did not include planning for defending rear areas in depth. There were no antitank ditches or mines, barbed wire, or trenches on the route to Remagen. The few defensive obstacles that had been constructed were too weak to block tanks or had been placed in open terrain, and the roadblocks they had built usually allowed <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> vehicles to pass. The only defense that slowed the Americans down was a machine gun manned by infantry over the town square, which two of the Pershings quickly dispatched. Relatively unmolested, the Americans arrived in strength at the western end of the bridge and the tanks began covering the bridge and the east shore with tank rounds, destroying a locomotive attached to a string of freight cars on the rail line parallel to the river.|$|E
40|$|Image {{interpolation}} is {{to convert}} a low-resolution (LR) image into a high-resolution (HR) image through mathematical modeling. An accurate model usually {{leads to a}} better reconstruction quality, and the autoregressive (AR) model is a widely adopted model for image interpolation. Although {{a large amount of}} works have been done on AR models for image interpolation, there are <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>for</b> improvements. In this work, we propose a robust and precise k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) searching scheme to form an accurate AR model of the local statistic.

Canning said that Liz's admission of being somewhat jealous of Jenna's success was a much needed storyline for the show, and one that gave the audience something deeper to latch onto. However, Canning pointed out that small hints of what their friendship was like in the past were played for laughs as opposed to establishing any sort of history.

40|$|Abstract: High {{precision}} cosmic-ray antiproton fluxes {{recently reported}} by BESS-Polar and PAMELA {{are consistent with}} secondary production from interactions of primary cosmic rays with the interstellar medium. This severely constrains the possibility of antiprotons of primary origin such as annihilation of supersymmetric dark matter or evaporation of primordial black holes.
