25|$|However, many Sephardic and chasidic Jews wear Rabbeinu Tam's Tefillin (in {{addition}} to wearing Rashi's) per opinions {{presented in the}} Shulchan Aruch and its extensive commentaries authored throughout the early-modern and modern era.

25|$|Danish <b>philosophy</b> <b>has</b> a long {{tradition}} as part of Western philosophy.

Some Indian Buddhists regard him as a Bodhisattva, although he never claimed it himself. Outside India, during the late 1990s, some Hungarian Romani people drew parallels between their own situation and that of the downtrodden people in India. Inspired by Ambedkar, they started to convert to Buddhism.|$|E
