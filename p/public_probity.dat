"I {{heard from}} my uncle many tales of his devoted activity, {{in which he}} was always guided by a simple wisdom, a high sense of honour, and the most scrupulous {{conception}} of private and <b>public</b> <b>probity.</b> He remains a living figure for me because of that meeting in a billiard room, when, in my anxiety to hear about a particularly wolfish wolf, I came in momentary contact with a man who was preeminently a man amongst all men capable of feeling deeply, of believing steadily, of loving ardently.|$|E
5000|$|The {{elections}} were held {{ahead of schedule}} following the early dissolution of parliament. This was reportedly done in order to [...] "choose a Parliament that would reinforce the [...] "new order" [...] of economic reform and <b>public</b> <b>probity</b> advocated by the new President", Joseph Saidu Momoh.|$|E
5000|$|One {{history of}} the Revolution which {{appeared}} in 1797, called [...] "Two Friends of Liberty" [...] closes its account of his death as follows: [...] "Calm, as was his conscience, he climbed {{the steps of the}} guillotine to meet his death with all the assurance {{of a man who had}} never used his life but to bring happiness to all who surrounded him". No-one, in fact, ever took the practice of private virtues farther than Arnaud de Laporte which was the best guarantee possible one could have for his <b>public</b> <b>probity</b> in office. Also, the esteem in which he was held by those who came to know him and even those who knew him only slightly was always accompanied by a genuine sentiment of affection.|$|E

50|$|In late February 2010, a news leak {{occurred}} which {{erupted in}} a government scandal surrounding the redevelopment of the Windsor Hotel. A document prepared by a senior media advisor to Planning Minister Justin Madden was sent by email to the ABC Newsdesk. It detailed plans by the Victorian Government to run a sham community consultation process {{in a bid to}} reject the plans. In response to <b>public</b> outcry, a <b>probity</b> officer was appointed to oversee the decision making process.|$|R
40|$|Probity audits" are a {{new type}} of audit gaining some {{popularity}} in the Australian <b>public</b> sector. <b>Probity</b> audits refer to independent reviews of government privatisations, contracting out projects (government procurements), and expression of interests to ascertain whether procedures followed are consistent with appropriate regulations, guidelines and best practice principles of openness and transparency. In recent times probity audits have been used by Australian public sector agencies in such activities as procurement, disposal of assets and contracting out of services. They provide one means of demonstrating open and accountable government processes, and assuring taxpayers that they are receiving value for money. However, there is scant empirical evidence on this topic. Surveys government departments in one Australian jurisdiction on their practices in relation to probity audits. Concludes that, while many have conducted probity audits, the concept is not fully understood. Further, the majority of the audits conducted were "real-time" and performed by parties outside the public sector. Concludes by suggesting areas for further researc...|$|R
5000|$|In June 2016, President dos Santos {{appointed}} {{his daughter}} {{as a director}} of the state-owned oil company, Sonangol. The appointment was challenged {{on the grounds that it}} violates Angola's <b>public</b> <b>probity</b> laws. Opposition politicians and critics declared this as dos Santos' attempts at becoming a [...] "king" [...] of Angola. It has been noted that placing his daughter in such a prominent position signals the likelihood on her intent to enter politics when President dos Santos' rule is up. The Angolan Supreme Court accepted the case in October, marking the first time a court has ever heard any case against the president since dos Santos' tenure. Bloomberg noted that Sonangol is planning a substantial restructuring due to external market pressure on oil, and that dos Santos wanted someone he fully trusted responsible for the restructuring to secure his family's interests.|$|E
5000|$|As of 2010, the {{government}} began implementing financial management software to track all state revenues and expenditures. The 2010 <b>Public</b> <b>Probity</b> Law states that all government officials must declare their wealth, but information declared under this law is not made public. The 2010 Anti-Money Laundering and Terrorism Financing Law provides for up to 24 years in prison, was intended to fight money laundering, and the Angolan Central Bank is tasked with preventing and uncovering money laundering. The 2002 Law on Access to Administrative Documents guarantees public access to official documents, but it is largely canceled out by the 2002 State Secrets Law, which is routinely used to prevent disclosure of information. There is also a Public Procurement Law, passed in 2010, but it is considered essentially meaningless. A 2011 penal code also indirectly criminalizes government corruption. The Law of Crimes Against the Economy criminalizes extortion and active and “passive corruption.” ...|$|E

40|$|The Popular Legal Action is a {{constitutional}} remedy, which is originated from {{the necessity of}} improving the Defense of Public Interest {{as well as of}} the Public Administration Morality Act. This remedy is a clear manifestation of the citizens’ sovereignty. This legal measure entitles any citizen to obtain the invalidation of illegal administrative acts or contract that can cause damages to the Federal, State and Municipal Property, which includes public agencies and any private party entitled to handle public money. This study has the purpose of preserving the <b>public</b> interest through <b>probity,</b> efficiency and morality when handling public property. In addition, it includes the environmental protection and the State Properties. Its aim is the prevention and interruption of the illicit act with the consequent conviction of the defendants who must return the damaged property to its status quo ante. It is a legal enforcement act that puts the Public Administration Defense into effect, not taking into consideration any personal advantage from the author. Although this legal remedy is concerned with the population as a whole, who is the beneficiary of the possible nullification of the illicit act, it is clear that this citizen will have his/her constitutional right preserved. In short, this Popular Legal Action is a political right that each citizen can make use of, in order to supervise the Administrative legality as well as his/her right to participate in the State Policy. A ação popular constitui-se em remédio constitucional nascido da necessidade de melhorar a defesa do interesse público e da moral administrativa. É uma manifestação direta da soberania popular. Através dela, qualquer cidadão é parte legítima para obter a invalidação de atos ou contratos administrativos ilegais e lesivos do patrimônio federal, estadual e municipal, ou de suas autarquias, entidades paraestatais e pessoas jurídicas subvencionadas com dinheiros públicos. Tem por objeto o interesse difuso à preservação da probidade, eficiência e moralidade na gestão da coisa pública, à tutela do meio ambiente e do patrimônio público. Sua finalidade é a prevenção e a desconstituição de ato lesivo e condenação dos responsáveis à reposição do status quo ante. É um meio processual que efetiva essa defesa públicoadministrativa e independe de o autor ter proveito pessoal na questão. Embora o interesse possa dizer respeito à coletividade como um todo, que é beneficiária da possível anulação do ato impugnado, o certo é que o autor popular age em nome próprio e no exercício de um direito seu, garantido constitucionalmente. É um direito político que faz com que o cidadão seja um fiscalizador da legalidade administrativa, tendo seu direito de participação na vida política do Estado...|$|R
40|$|If deficits, nor defaults, don't {{really matter}} anymore, what sign {{of our times}} is it? What has changed from the days that Franklin Delano Roosevelt risked the fragile {{economic}} recovery from the great depression by returning, in 1937, to the standard of his economic orthodoxy, a belief in fiscal rectitude and anaversion to debts and deficits? If that {{was a sign of}} a certain American character, what has happened to it? A massive shift in public culture must have occurred, affecting people's views on <b>public</b> <b>probity</b> and political rectitude.
