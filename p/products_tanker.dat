40|$|First {{the entire}} <b>products</b> <b>tanker</b> market system, {{including}} the petroleum products market, <b>products</b> <b>tanker</b> shipping {{market and the}} <b>products</b> <b>tanker</b> shipbuilding market, is introduced. The relationship among principal elements is discussed. General information about petroleum products and products tankers is described. Then, the world petroleum products market and <b>products</b> <b>tanker</b> shipping market are examined referring to 1985 Drewry report. Finally, the analysis of <b>products</b> <b>tanker</b> shipbuilding market is made by analyzing the statistics of the products tankers ordered between 1980 and 1986 according to Fairplay orderbook. Major aspects, such as flag, owner, shipbuilder, vessel tonnage, dimensions, speed and engine, are examined. Conclusions and predictions are then make...|$|E

40|$|The primary {{objective}} of this PhD research is to develop an advanced understanding of the necessary and realistic performance expectations from a full form medium size ship system by means of numerical computer modelling. This includes the minimisation of the harmful environmental signature by increasing its efficiency {{in compliance with the}} EEDI requirements while in search of how the EEDI methodology might be enhanced. The investigation has focused on a medium sized <b>products</b> <b>tanker</b> acting as a midpoint of the spectrum of ship sizes within the range of 20, 000 – 60, 000 DWT of this type. In order to solve such an extensive problem, in the first place, it was important to analyse the energy efficient technology market in a structured manner and then, to identify the most favourable fuel consumption reduction methods that can be associated with the examined ship type. Next, an integrated computer simulation model, involving linked engine, propeller and hull analysis programs, has been developed and calibrated with the model tests and sea trial data. The ship system has been analysed under diverse conditions including various propulsion systems, innovative machinery arrangements, efficiency enhancing hydrodynamic appendages as well as changing weather and load conditions. The evaluation of potential benefits associated with the deployment of innovative technology(s), operation profile(s) or their combination has been made by comparing the designated Energy Efficiency Indicators (EDI), namely, the propulsive efficiency, fuel oil consumption, exhaust emissions footprint and EEDI, respectively associated with the technical, fuel savings, environmental and legal perspectives. In addition, such a comprehensive analysis has also helped to detect a number of uncertainties in the current EEDI formulation while pointing out ways in which it can be improved...|$|E

40|$|The oil {{refining}} {{industry in the}} EEA faces future challenges. Some of these challenges are competition from non-EEA refiners, increased import of petroleum products to the EEA and unsophisticated technology of existing refineries. If the {{oil refining}} industry in the EEA will change in the future, what impact will these changes have on the intermediate <b>product</b> <b>tanker</b> segment trading in the EEA? These possible future changes in the refining industry are essential for ship-owners’ decision making in regards to efficient operation of intermediate <b>product</b> <b>tankers</b> in the EEA. The {{purpose of this study}} is to investigate how and why the oil refining industry in the EEA will develop until year 2025 and how these changes will affect the intermediate <b>product</b> <b>tanker</b> segment. To fulfil the purpose, a case study has been performed. The primary information for this study has been retrieved by conducting ten interviews with semi-structured questions. The result from this study shows that the refining industry in the EEA faces several future challenges. Increased competition from non-EEA refiners and increased import of petroleum products have been highlighted as the main challenges for the refining industry in EEA. This study also shows that the intermediate <b>product</b> <b>tankers</b> still are expected to be needed for regional transportation within the EEA. However, the intermediate product segment faces competition from larger segments and therefore it is important that the segment keeps its flexibility compared to larger segments to not lose its market shares. The size of existing intermediate <b>product</b> <b>tankers</b> is appropriate and therefore the size should retain in order to keep the segment´s flexibility...|$|R

5|$|An oil tanker, {{also known}} as a {{petroleum}} tanker, is a merchant ship designed for the bulk transport of oil. There are two basic types of oil tankers: crude <b>tankers</b> and <b>product</b> <b>tankers.</b> Crude tankers move large quantities of unrefined crude oil from its point of extraction to refineries. For example, moving crude oil from oil wells in Nigeria to the refineries on the coast of the United States. <b>Product</b> <b>tankers,</b> generally much smaller, are designed to move refined products from refineries to points near consuming markets. For example, moving gasoline from refineries in Europe to consumer markets in Nigeria and other West African nations.|$|R
