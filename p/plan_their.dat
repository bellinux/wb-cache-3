5|$|After {{the second}} year, {{as the child}} begins to see the {{caregiver}} as an independent person, a more complex and goal-corrected partnership is formed. Children begin to notice others' goals and feelings and <b>plan</b> <b>their</b> actions accordingly. For example, whereas babies cry because of pain, two-year-olds cry to summon their caregiver, and if that does not work, cry louder, shout, or follow.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, CART {{became the}} 39th public {{transportation}} {{system in the}} United States to be featured on Google Transit, a website that allows transportation users to electronically <b>plan</b> <b>their</b> travel routes. In 2010, CART buses were modified to include a GPS tracking system that allows riders to see the location of buses and their predicted arrival times via the CART and Google websites. CART buses transport more than 1.3million travelers annually.|$|E

5|$|Mesa Verdeans used astronomical {{observations}} to <b>plan</b> <b>their</b> farming and religious ceremonies, drawing on both natural {{features in the}} landscape and masonry structures built for this purpose. Several great houses in the region were aligned to the cardinal directions, which positioned windows, doors, and walls along {{the path of the}} sun, whose rays would indicate the passing of seasons. Mesa Verde's Sun Temple is thought to have been an astronomical observatory.|$|E
5|$|Boy Scouts {{learn to}} use the ideals {{spelled out in the}} Scout Oath, the Scout Law, the Outdoor Code, the Scout motto ("Be prepared"), and the Scout slogan ("Do a good turn daily"). They wear a uniform and work {{together}} in patrols of four to ten boys with an elected patrol leader. Scouts share responsibilities, apply skills learned at meetings and live together in the outdoors. The advancement system provides opportunities for personal growth and self-reliance. Scouts interact with adult leaders who act as role models and mentors, but they are expected to <b>plan</b> <b>their</b> own activities within the troop and to participate in community service. Opportunities are provided for leadership training with practical application.|$|E
5|$|By early 1944, Allied {{submarines}} were sinking {{large numbers}} of Japanese ships. Their activities were frequently guided by 'Ultra' intelligence relating to ship movements which was collected by intercepting and decrypting encoded radio transmissions. The IJN routinely broadcast the location and intended route of convoys under its protection, and decrypting these messages allowed Allied naval commanders to alert submarines {{in the vicinity of}} convoys. The submarine commanders were free to <b>plan</b> <b>their</b> interception and attack where conditions were most favorable.|$|E

5|$|In early 1975 Merlyn Rees set up {{elections}} for the Northern Ireland Constitutional Convention at which all of Northern Ireland's politicians would <b>plan</b> <b>their</b> way forward. These were held on 1 May 1975 and the United Ulster Unionist Council (UUUC), which had won 11 out of 12 Northern Irish seats in the February 1974 general election, won a majority again. As the UUUC would not abide any form of power-sharing with the Dublin government, no agreement could be reached and the convention failed, again marginalising Northern Ireland's politicians and the communities they represented.|$|E

The gharial's wife demands that her husband bring home the monkey to eat, believing that the fruit made the monkey's heart sweet. The gharial complies at first and attempts to lure the monkey to his home, but soon comes clean about the <b>plan.</b> <b>Their</b> friendship ends after that.

5|$|At 07:20 Moscow time on 19 November, Soviet {{forces on}} the {{northern}} flank of the Axis forces at Stalingrad began their offensive; forces in the south began on 20 November. Although Romanian units were able to repel the first attacks, {{by the end of}} 20 November the Third and Fourth Romanian armies were in headlong retreat, as the Red Army bypassed several German infantry divisions. German mobile reserves were not strong enough to parry the Soviet mechanized spearheads, while the Sixth Army did not react quickly enough nor decisively enough to disengage German armored forces in Stalingrad and reorient them to defeat the impending threat. By late 22 November Soviet forces linked up at the town of Kalach, encircling some 290,000 men east of the Don River. Instead of attempting {{to break out of the}} encirclement, German leader Adolf Hitler decided to keep Axis forces in Stalingrad and resupply them by air. In the meantime, Soviet and German commanders began to <b>plan</b> <b>their</b> next movements.|$|E
5|$|Between February 17 and February 19, 1975, North Vietnamese field {{commanders in}} the Central Highlands Front held a conference to plan for their {{upcoming}} offensive. In order to <b>plan</b> <b>their</b> combat strategy, North Vietnamese commanders assessed the potential obstacles faced by the Vietnam People’s Army {{and the strength of}} the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) in the Central Highlands. Following extensive discussions, North Vietnamese commanders concluded that the South Vietnamese army in the Central Highlands could mobilise about 5–7 regiment-sized units to counter the upcoming offensive. In the worst-case scenario, if South Vietnamese units were not tied up elsewhere, North Vietnamese commanders thought that South Vietnam could probably mobilise between nine and twelve regiments. North Vietnamese commanders believed South Vietnam could deploy about one or two armoured brigades, three to five battalions of artillery, and 80 aircraft per day to support the army. The North Vietnamese commanders within the Central Highlands Front discussed the possibility of the United States re-entering the conflict, which they believed would see the commitment of about 100 fighter-bombers from the United States Seventh Fleet.|$|E

5|$|In 2010, the {{brothers}} were both accepted to New York University. They had initial {{plans to attend}} the university {{in the fall of}} 2010; however, they deferred for one year. Dylan initially planned on majoring in fine/studio arts and minoring in economics while Cole planned on majoring in film and television production and minoring in drama. Instead, they both enrolled in the Gallatin School of Individualized Study, which allows students to <b>plan</b> <b>their</b> own curriculum. Cole focused his curriculum on the humanities and archaeology while Dylan focused on video game design. In 2011, Dylan was elected president of the Third Avenue North residence hall at New York University. Both brothers graduated in May 2015; they told Entertainment magazine that they had walked away with each other's diplomas at the graduation ceremony.|$|E
5|$|In the U.S., the National Organization for Women (NOW) {{began in}} 1966 to seek women's equality, {{including}} through the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), {{which did not}} pass, although some states enacted their own. Reproductive rights in the U.S. centred on the court decision in Roe v. Wade enunciating a woman's right to choose whether to carry a pregnancy to term. Western women gained more reliable birth control, allowing family planning and careers. The movement started in the 1910s in the U.S. under Margaret Sanger and elsewhere under Marie Stopes. In the final three decades of the 20th century, Western women knew a new freedom through birth control, which enabled women to <b>plan</b> <b>their</b> adult lives, often making way for both career and family.|$|E
