5|$|Some of the house's {{architecture}} {{also reflects}} the influences from contemporary buildings across North Wales, in particular Gwydir Castle, built by Robert Wynn's father John. Plas Mawr lacks a fashionable long gallery, for example, which was popular in England at the time, and was {{already beginning to}} appear in Welsh houses. Instead, it has a rear turret, or belvedere, which is raised prominently above {{the height of the}} rest of the house, overlooking the town: this was a slightly antiquated feature, but was widely used in other Wynn family properties, including Bodysgallen Hall. The design of Plas Mawr influenced other buildings in North Wales at the time, including the redecoration of Gwydir Castle, Maenan Hall further up the Conwy valley, Plas Mawr in Caernarfon and Hen Blas in Beaumaris. It also later shaped the architecture of 19th- and 20th-century buildings in Conwy itself, surviving examples of which include the town's <b>police</b> <b>station</b> <b>and</b> the Castlebank Hotel.|$|E
