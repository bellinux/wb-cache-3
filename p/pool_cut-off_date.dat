40|$|This is {{the first}} paper that {{documents}} that school entry <b>cut-off</b> <b>date</b> affects the timing of births. Many countries require children to reach a certain age by a specified date in the calendar year in order to start primary school. There is a clear tradeoff for parents to time a birth either {{before or after the}} school entry cut-off date; births just before <b>cut-off</b> <b>date</b> benefit parents by avoiding a year of child care costs through sending their children to school at a relatively young age, while births just after <b>cut-off</b> <b>date</b> may benefit children from being in the oldest among the school cohort, which is shown to provide the children with academic advantage. Using the universe of birth during 1974 – 2010 in Japan, I find that more than 1, 800 births per year are shifted roughly a week before the <b>cut-off</b> <b>date</b> to a week following the <b>cut-off</b> <b>date.</b> The overall shifts in births, however, mask heterogeneous responses of mothers. I find that non-working mothers are more likely to delay births than working mothers. Also male births and higher parity births {{are more likely to be}} delayed. Interestingly among those working mothers, mothers with low skilled jobs are more likely to shift births before the school entry <b>cut-off</b> <b>dates,</b> suggesting that for those mothers financial burden of child care outweighs the importance of future academic advantage of children. This study may have implications for growing literature that assumes births around the school entry <b>cut-off</b> <b>dates</b> are random. Acknowledgement...|$|R

50|$|<b>Cut-off</b> <b>dates</b> for {{academic}} cohort structuring, including {{the setting of}} academic years, are usually determined by national education authorities and tend {{to be based on}} autumn start dates, so August or September <b>cut-off</b> <b>dates</b> are common in the Northern Hemisphere and February or March <b>cut-off</b> <b>dates</b> are common in the Southern Hemisphere. This tendency reflects the historical need for children to be involved in summer-time agricultural work with school starting after harvesting.A ‘relative age effect’ in academia is illustrated in the third graph which shows the % deviation from month of birth profile norms evident in graduations from Oxford University over a 10-year period. Academic relative age effects seem to be moderated by culture.|$|R
40|$|The Relative Age Effect is {{explored}} in 742 Japanese baseball {{players on the}} roster of THE PROFESSIONAL BASEBALL ORGANIZATION OF JAPAN in 2002. The cut off date, April 1 st in Japan, segments the birth-month distribution of players. Players born after the <b>cut-off</b> <b>date</b> are over-represented, whereas players born before the <b>cut-off</b> <b>date</b> are under-represented. The distribution decreasing {{from left to right}} after <b>cut-off</b> <b>date</b> is linear and steep. In Japan, early-births [HAYA-UMARE], whose birth dates are in January, February and March, are less likely to become professional baseball players. Divided by personal traits, high-school graduates rather than university graduates, lower achievers rather than upper achievers, and right-handed throwers rather than left-handed throwers, have higher relative age effects. ...|$|R

50|$|The United States Department of State {{publishes a}} monthly Visa Bulletin https://travel.state.gov/visa/bulletin/bulletin_1360.html which lists <b>cut-off</b> <b>dates</b> for {{different}} immigration categories and countries of birth. Only those intending applicants with priority <b>dates</b> before the <b>cut-off</b> <b>date</b> {{are permitted to}} file their Adjustment of Status (AOS) applications or attend immigrant visa interviews at consulates. The <b>cut-off</b> <b>dates</b> generally move forward over time as old cases are approved or abandoned. However, in certain cases, such as if {{a large number of}} old cases work their way through the system at about the same time, the <b>cut-off</b> <b>dates</b> can actually retrogress (or roll back). If an individual already has a pending AOS application on file when a retrogression occurs that places the cut-off earlier than the applicant's priority date, USCIS sets the application aside and will not adjudicate it until the priority date is current again. As an example, after months of stagnation, in June 2007 the priority <b>date</b> <b>cut-offs</b> for employment-based second and third-preference (EB2 and EB3) applicants (the bulk of employment-based green card applicants) advanced dramatically for all countries of birth. On the low end, the cut-off advanced eight months for immigrants from mainland China for EB2 category. EB3 for India-born applicants has moved forward 25 months, the most of any category, thus impacting a huge number of workers with jobs requiring bachelor's degrees.|$|R

40|$|Project {{monitoring}} involves {{collecting the}} actual-progress data, and comparing {{them against the}} relevant planned-progress data to evaluate the overall project progress at specified <b>cut-off</b> <b>dates.</b> Inevitable issues including variations in reporting skills {{as well as the}} willingness to record accurate data impact {{on the quality of the}} collected data. Comparison against multiple possible benchmarks (one-to-many) rather than a single benchmark (one-to-one) offers the potential to alleviate the negative impact of low-quality data on the progress evaluation. Special patterns, which can be readily manipulated within computer programs, are devised to encode the planned and actual progress at the <b>cut-off</b> <b>dates.</b> Basically, pattern recognition techniques are utilized to classify the multiple patterns representing the planned progress at a given <b>cut-off</b> <b>date</b> and the classification is used to evaluate the pattern representing the actual progress at the same date. The pattern recognition techniques generalize a virtual benchmark to represent the planned progress based on multiple patterns generated at a given <b>cut-off</b> <b>date</b> and representing possible benchmarks. In addition to the alleviation of the negative impact of low-quality data on the progress evaluation, the generalization feature potentially encourages a long-run attitude in site personnel to report high-quality data. Finally, the pattern recognition concept and technique proved their robustness to monitor and evaluate the overall progress of the projects based on the technique of critical path method.

40|$|Studies in the US, the UK and Europe found {{children}} born {{close to the}} <b>cut-off</b> <b>date</b> {{for the start of}} school year face disadvantage in terms of educational attainment.
