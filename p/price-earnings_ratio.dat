2500|$|As {{a result}} of the rapidly-increasing usage of the Internet, many investors were eager to invest, at any valuation, in any company that had one of the Internet-related prefixes or a [...] ".com" [...] suffix in its name, leading to a stock market bubble. During the bubble, the valuations of {{companies}} in the quaternary sector of the economy increased rapidly. Venture capitalists, eager to profit on this investment demand, moved to raise and invest capital faster and with less caution than usual. A combination of rapidly increasing stock prices, market confidence that the companies would turn future profits, speculation in stocks by individuals, and widely available venture capital created an environment in which many investors were willing to overlook traditional metrics, such as the <b>price–earnings</b> <b>ratio,</b> in favor of basing confidence on technological advancements. The low interest rates of 1998–99 helped increase the availability of funding. The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, which lowered the top marginal capital gains tax in the United States, is also cited as a reason that people were willing to make more speculative investments.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The use of <b>price–earnings</b> <b>ratios</b> and dividend-price ratios as {{forecasting}} {{variables for}} the stock market is examined using aggregate annual US data 1871 to 2000 and aggregate quarterly data for twelve countries since 1970.

We conclude that, overall, the ratios do poorly in forecasting any of these. Rather, the ratios appear to be useful primarily in forecasting future stock price changes, contrary to the simple efficient-markets models.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we show that}} {{measures}} of economic uncertainty (conditional volatility of consumption) predict and are predicted by valuation ratios at long horizons.
