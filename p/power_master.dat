60|$|Severus {{with great}} labor and charge terrified the Caledonians; {{but he did}} not subdue them. He {{neglected}} those easy and assured means of subjection which the nature of that part of Britain affords to a <b>power</b> <b>master</b> of the sea, by the bays, friths, and lakes with which it is everywhere pierced, and in some places almost cut through. A few garrisons at the necks of land, and a fleet to connect them and to awe the coast, must at any time have been sufficient irrecoverably to subdue that part of Britain. This was a neglect in Agricola occasioned probably by a limited command; and it was not rectified by boundless authority in Severus. The Caledonians again resumed their arms, and renewed their ravages on the Roman frontier. Severus died before he could take any new measures; and from his death there is an almost total silence concerning the affairs of Britain until the division of the Empire.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. A. (Applied Language and Literary Studies)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2006 This {{dissertation}} attempts a Bakhtinian {{analysis of}} the polyphonic dialogue between Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness, Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now, Karel Schoeman's Na die Geliefde Land and Jason Xenopoulos' Promised Land. Specific Bakthinian concepts are employed {{to determine whether the}} films are "apt" adaptations of the literary texts; how the stylistically hybrid texts engage in conversation with different movements, genres and trends; how the polyphonic conversations between different texts and discourses, such as literature and film, or colonialism and postcolonialism, can provide insight into the variety of discourses, textual and ideological, of a postcolonial, post-apartheid South Africa; and how identity crises experienced by key characters can be explained using the notions of hybridity, "The Marginal Man" and liminality. All four texts have key characters that experience identity crises that spring from cultural hybridity; their cultural hybridity has the potential to either render them marginally stagnant or lead them to liminally active participation within their imagined communities. This dissertation argues that even though there are major differences between the films and the literary texts they are based upon, they are relevant to a specific target audience and therefore enrich the ur-texts. Salient characteristics of realism, symbolism, impressionism, modernism, postmodernism, postcolonialism and the apocalyptic dialogise one another within the four texts, thereby liberating the texts from one authorial reading. The dialogue between the discourses of literature and film supplement an understanding of the dialogue between war, imperialism, colonialism, postcolonialism and the Will to <b>Power.</b> <b>Master...</b>|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. Engineering Sciences (Nuclear Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. The {{intention}} {{of this research}} was to uncover the reasons for the perceived lack of confidence in nuclear power by the labour unions, and hence to propose a framework for building the unions’ confidence in nuclear energy. A literature review of the views of labour unions, globally, on nuclear power was conducted. This provided the insight to design the experiment for this study. The literature review revealed that there were five major reasons causing labour unions to oppose nuclear power: environmental impact, safety, cost, political influence and job creation. The research was then categorized {{on the basis of these}} reasons. The labour unions selected for this research were Solidarity, Confederation of South African Trade Unions (COSATU) and National Union of Mineworkers (NUM). Questions were prepared on each of the five categories and in–depth interviews were telephonically conducted. The responses to these interviews were analyzed to establish the best way forward for building greater labour union confidence in the nuclear industry in South Africa. The results of the interviews showed that Solidarity was in favour of nuclear power, while COSATU and NUM were against it for the following reasons: 1. They believed that the industry would not create a significant number of jobs, and may even lead to job losses. 2. They had the perception that the nuclear industry was dominated by white people and that the expansion of the industry would ultimately result in the creation of White jobs at the expense of Black jobs. 3. They were of the opinion that the nuclear industry harbored certain secrets which resulted in their distrust of it. These findings were then used to develop recommendations for building the confidence of the unions in nuclear <b>power.</b> <b>Master...</b>|$|E
40|$|A new {{technique}} for reducing errors in a laser-cooled cesium fountain frequency standard provides for strong {{suppression of the}} light shift without need for mechanical shutters. Because mechanical shutters are typically susceptible to failure after operating times {{of the order of}} months, the elimination of mechanical shutters could contribute significantly to the reliability of frequency standards that are required to function continuously for longer time intervals. With respect to the operation of an atomic-fountain frequency standard, the term "light shift" denotes an undesired relative shift in the two energy levels of the atoms (in this case, cesium atoms) in the atomic fountain during interrogation by microwaves. The shift in energy levels translates to a frequency shift that reduces the precision and possibly accuracy of the frequency standard. For reasons too complex to describe within the space available for this article, the light shift is caused by any laser light that reaches the atoms during the microwave- interrogation period, but is strongest for near-resonance light. In the absence of any mitigating design feature, the light shift, expressed as a fraction of the standard fs frequency, could be as large as approx. 2 x 10 (exp - 11), the largest error in the standard. In a typical prior design, to suppress light shift, the intensity of laser light is reduced during the interrogation period by using a single-pass acoustooptic modulator to deflect the majority of light away from the main optical path. Mechanical shutters are used to block the remaining undeflected light to ensure complete attenuation. Without shutters, this remaining undeflected light could cause a light shift of as much as. 10. 15, which is unacceptably large in some applications. The {{new technique}} implemented here involves additionally shifting the laser wavelength off resonance by a relatively large amount (typically of the order of nanometers) during microwave interrogation. In this design, when microwave interrogation is not underway, the atoms are illuminated by a slave laser locked to the lasing frequency of a lower <b>power</b> <b>master</b> laser...|$|E
