5|$|Two {{stages of}} {{volcanic}} activity constructed the Itcha Range. The first stage, {{referred to as}} the felsic shield-building stage, occurred between 3.8and 3.0million years ago. Three phases comprise this stage; a pre-explosive phase, an explosive phase and a post-explosive phase. Analysis of the first trachyte magmas to erupt during the pre-explosive phase suggest they were relatively fluid as shown by their areal extent. Eruptions became more viscous during the explosive phase, followed by more viscosity during the post-explosive phase. As a result, the volume of erupted material became smaller over time. The increasing viscousness of felsic lava during the shield-building stage suggests a maturing <b>plumbing</b> <b>system</b> underneath the Itcha Range, which may have consisted of multiple, isolated, cupola-type magma chambers.|$|E

25|$|The {{route of}} {{transmission}} {{is important to}} epidemiologists because patterns of contact vary between different populations and different groups of populations depending on socio-economic, cultural and other features. For example, low personal and food hygiene {{due to the lack}} of a clean water supply may result in increased transmission of diseases by the fecal-oral route, such as cholera. Differences in incidence of such diseases between different groups can also throw light on the routes of transmission of the disease. For example, if it is noted that polio is more common in cities in underdeveloped countries, without a clean water supply, than in cities with a good <b>plumbing</b> <b>system,</b> we might advance the theory that polio is spread by the fecal-oral route. It can be minimised to a certain extent if we all consider being sure of what we do.|$|E
25|$|When {{planning}} {{these new}} facilities, Metcalf {{was concerned about}} the security of the collection – damage to manuscripts and books from variations in heat and humidity, or worst of all, damage from a flood. In the case of Houghton, the building that was to house the rare collections at Harvard, many features were designed into the air conditioning and plumbing systems that were meant to mitigate the risk of damage. Catch basins were installed under any pipe running horizontally to catch and divert any water from leaks. The <b>plumbing</b> <b>system</b> itself was designed so that the location of leaks could be found quickly through a series of shut-off valves, and the walls were designed with easy access to plumbing. The display cases themselves were designed so that they were well ventilated. This allowed lighting to be installed in the cases (rather than outside) without impacting the temperature and humidity levels. It was features like these that helped keep the collections safe.|$|E

50|$|In 1926, a {{group of}} Los Angeles {{plumbing}} inspectors recognized {{that there were no}} uniform requirements for the installation and maintenance of <b>plumbing</b> <b>systems.</b> At that time, heating was done by boilers that piped the heat to radiators. Efficient air conditioning was not available. Widely divergent practices and the use of many different, often conflicting, plumbing codes by local jurisdictions led to <b>plumbing</b> <b>systems</b> that were incompatible and potentially dangerous. This underscored the necessity of developing a model code that could be uniformly applied across jurisdictions.|$|R
25|$|As magma {{nears the}} surface and its {{pressure}} decreases, gases escape. This process is much like {{what happens when you}} open a bottle of fizzy drink and carbon dioxide escapes. Sulfur dioxide {{is one of the main}} components of volcanic gases, and increasing amounts of it herald the arrival of increasing amounts of magma near the surface. For example, on May 13, 1991, an increasing amount of sulfur dioxide was released from Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines. On May 28, just two weeks later, sulfur dioxide emissions had increased to 5,000 tonnes, ten times the earlier amount. Mount Pinatubo later erupted on June 12, 1991. On several occasions, such as before the Mount Pinatubo eruption and the 1993 Galeras, Colombia eruption, sulfur dioxide emissions have dropped to low levels prior to eruptions. Most scientists believe that this drop in gas levels is caused by the sealing of gas passages by hardened magma. Such an event leads to increased pressure in the volcano's <b>plumbing</b> <b>system</b> and an increased chance of an explosive eruption. A multi-component gas analyzer system (Multi-GAS) is an instrument package used to take real-time high-resolution measurements of volcanic gas plumes. Multi-GAS measurements of CO2/SO2 ratios can allow detection of the pre-eruptive degassing of rising magmas, improving prediction of volcanic activity.|$|E
500|$|A key {{requirement}} that enables a geyser to erupt is a material called geyserite found in rocks nearby the geyser. [...] Geyserite—mostly silicon dioxide (SiO2), is dissolved from {{the rocks and}} gets deposited {{on the walls of}} the geyser's <b>plumbing</b> <b>system</b> and on the surface. The deposits make the channels carrying the water up to the surface pressure-tight. This allows the pressure to be carried all the way to the top and not be leaked out into the loose gravel or soil that are normally under the geyser fields.|$|E

2500|$|The ancient Greek {{civilization of}} Crete, {{known as the}} Minoan civilization, was the first civilization to use {{underground}} clay pipes for sanitation and water supply. [...] Their capital, Knossos, had a well-organized water system for bringing in clean water, taking out waste water and storm sewage canals for overflow when there was heavy rain. It {{was also one of}} the first uses of a flush toilet, dating back to 18th century BC. The Minoan civilization had stone sewers that were periodically flushed with clean water. In addition to sophisticated water and sewer systems they devised elaborate heating systems. The Ancient Greeks of Athens and Asia Minor also used an indoor <b>plumbing</b> <b>system,</b> used for pressurized showers. [...] The Greek inventor Heron used pressurized piping for fire fighting purposes in the City of Alexandria.

2500|$|Pure {{water has}} a pH close to 7 (neither {{alkaline}} nor acidic). Sea water can have [...] pH values {{that range from}} 7.5 to 8.4 (moderately alkaline). Fresh water can have widely ranging pH values depending on the geology of the drainage basin or aquifer {{and the influence of}} contaminant inputs (acid rain). If the water is acidic (lower than 7), lime, soda ash, or sodium hydroxide can be added to raise the pH during water purification processes. Lime addition increases the calcium ion concentration, thus raising the water hardness. For highly acidic waters, forced draft degasifiers can be an effective way to raise the pH, by stripping dissolved carbon dioxide from the water. Making the water alkaline helps coagulation and flocculation processes work effectively and also helps to minimize the risk of lead being dissolved from lead pipes and from lead solder in pipe fittings. [...] Sufficient alkalinity also reduces the corrosiveness of water to iron pipes. Acid (carbonic acid, hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid) may be added to alkaline waters in some circumstances to lower the pH. Alkaline water (above pH 7.0) {{does not necessarily mean that}} lead or copper from the <b>plumbing</b> <b>system</b> will not be dissolved into the water. [...] The ability of water to precipitate calcium carbonate to protect metal surfaces and reduce the likelihood of toxic metals being dissolved in water is a function of pH, mineral content, temperature, alkalinity and calcium concentration.|$|E
