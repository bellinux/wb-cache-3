Ryan is uncooperative until Ensign Mayweather intervenes, saying that Ryan's motivations are not about preventing future attacks on Earth ships; they are about personal revenge, and doing so simply exposes other freighter crews to revenge attacks as well. Ryan relents. Later, Archer and Captain Keene of Fortunate discuss Ryan's actions and his demotion to Crewman 3rd class. They agree Ryan acted rashly, but Keene also muses that acting on their own is the primary motivation his <b>people</b> are <b>out</b> <b>here</b> — to both challenge and prove themselves.|$|R

I felt so horrible about the way we treat these destitute people that I wanted to write a desperate-sounding song - the line 'let me hear you scream if you're with me' could be understood to come from the perspective of someone who is locked up, needing to hear that there are people outside who are behind him and supporting him." [...] Kim Moyes said [...] "In a lot of ways song is a 'mega-mix' of three or four Presets ideas and it's a really glued-together, solid Presets song.

40|$|When Ruth Finnegan {{published}} {{her book}} Oral Literature in Africa (Oxford: The Clarendon Press, 1970), {{out of five}} hundred and fifty-eight pages she devoted only two and half pages to the epic, and even these were negative. 2 ̆ 2 All in all, 2 ̆ 2 she wrote, 2 ̆ 2 epic poetry {{does not seem to}} be a typical African form.... Certain elements of epic also come into many other forms of poetry and prose. But in general terms and apart from Islamic influences, epic seems to be of remarkably little significance in African oral literature, and the a priori assumption that epic is the natural form for many non-literate <b>peoples</b> turns <b>out</b> <b>here</b> to have little support 2 ̆ 2 (p. 110).

(He waits for an answer, but Eileen remains silent with her eyes closed. Carmody starts to walk up and down, talking with an air of desperation.) You're not asking a bit of news from home. I'm thinkin' the <b>people</b> <b>out</b> <b>here</b> have taken all the thought of us out of your head. We're all well, thank God. I've another good job on the streets from Murphy and one that'll last a long time, praise be! I'm needin' it surely, with all the expenses--but no matter. Billy had a raise from his old skinflint of a boss a month back. He's gettin' seven a week now and proud as a turkey. He was comin' out with us to-day, but he'd a date with his girl. Sure, he's got a girl now, the young bucko! What d'you think of him? It's old Malloy's girl he's after--the pop-eyed one with glasses, you remember--as ugly as a blind sheep, only he don't think so.

[...] "It was not from want of warnings, for <b>people</b> living <b>out</b> <b>here</b> had written again and again telling what vast preparations they were making, but the people who govern the country paid no attention. It was much easier to believe what was pleasant than what was unpleasant; but their folly will cost the country very dear. If they had sent over twenty thousand men a year ago {{there would have been no}} war; now they will have to send over a hundred thousand men, perhaps even more; and great sums of money will be spent, and great numbers of lives lost, simply because our government refused to believe what everyone <b>out</b> <b>here</b> knew to be the fact. We did nothing, and allowed the Boers to complete all their preparations, and to choose their own time for war. But though we have made a horrible mistake, do not think, chief, that there is any doubt about our conquering at last; the men who now govern our country are men and not cowards, and will not, as that other government did, go on their knees to the Boers, and even if they would do so, the people would not sanction it." ...|$|R
