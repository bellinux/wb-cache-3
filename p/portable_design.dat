Kazuma Kaneko suggested a Shin Megami Tensei game for the Nintendo DS. There were two main reasons for developing the game for this platform: Kaneko felt that the <b>portable</b> <b>design</b> fit in well with Shin Megami Tensei gameplay philosophies, fellow role-playing game Etrian Odyssey had been a commercial success, it had the biggest install base among their target audience, and its nature as a portable game meant people could concentrate more on the game when knowing that they could end their play session with ease. The game's title was originally going to be Shin Megami Tensei IV, but due to the game's setting, {{it was decided to}} give it its own subtitle.

5000|$|The outdoor {{gas grill}} {{was invented in}} the early 1950s by Don McGlaughlin, owner of the Chicago Combustion Corporation, known today as LazyMan. McGlaughlin invented the first {{built-in}} grill from the successful gas broiler called BROILBURGER. These first Lazy-Man grills were marketed as [...] "open-fire charcoal-type gas broilers" [...] which featured [...] "permanent coals", otherwise known as lava rock. In the 1950s, most residential households {{did not have a}} barbecue, so the term broiler was used for marketing purposes to commercial establishments. The gas open-broiler design was adapted into the first portable gas grill in 1954 by Chicago Combustion Corporation as the Model AP.

50|$|Since the Apple II, Macintosh, IBM, Commodore, and Atari {{computers}} all had varying graphics {{capabilities and}} different processors, releasing a software title for each different brand of computer usually involved programming it again from scratch for each platform.

The compact images from Graphics Magician could be used across platforms, and an adventure game development and deployment language called Comprehend was created to be system independent and was used for several releases. Also using Graphics Magician across platforms and with a <b>portable</b> <b>design,</b> the first three titles in the Adventures Around the World geography game series were released. However a similar idea called Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego reached the market a few months sooner and doomed the Penguin Software series.|$|E
