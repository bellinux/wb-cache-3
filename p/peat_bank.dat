40|$|Botanical macrofassil {{analysis}} of a more than 9000 years old, radiocarbon dated peat sequence of a moss <b>peat</b> <b>bank</b> from South Georgia, shows a clear evolution in the vegetation. Seven ecological phases could be distinguished {{and they can be}} interpreted in terms of climate development during the Holocene. Until 2200 years ago, Warnstorfia fontinatiopsis was the dominant moss species pointing to a wet environment. Lower numbers of this species in association with the presence of drier species are assumed to indicate drier periods, such as occurring between ca 6000 - 5200 and 4400 - 3400 cal yr BR The most prominent and definitive vegetation change took place around 2200 cal yr BP. A Polytilchum-Chollsodontium moss <b>peat</b> <b>bank</b> was formed, which is still growing there today. The forcing mechanism for this vegetation change is thought to be a temperature decrease, rather than a precipitation decrease. This conclusion is mainly based on the fact that, today, moss peat banks have their optimal occurrence range in the maritime Antarctic, a region were the mean annual temperature is ca 4 degrees C lower than on South Georgia. The remarkable change in the moss bank vegetation at 2200 cal yr BP raises the question whether this moment was only a short climatic deterioration, or a definitive change to a cooler and wetter climate after a Holocene climatic optimum period.

40|$|First paragraph: In 1993, a peat-cutter, Bruce Field, {{working on}} the blanket <b>peat</b> <b>bank</b> he rented from the Sutherland Estate by Loch Farlary, above Golspie in Sutherland (fig 1), {{reported}} to Scottish Natural Heritage and Historic Scotland several pieces of pine wood bearing axe marks. Their depth in the peat suggested the cut marks to be prehistoric. This paper summarizes the work undertaken to understand the age and archaeological significance of this find (see also Tipping et al 2001 in press). The pine trees were initially thought {{to be part of}} a population that flourished briefly across northern Scotland in the middle of the Holocene period from c 4800 cal BP (Huntley, Daniell & Allen 1997). The subsequent collapse across northernmost Scotland of this population, the pine decline, at around 4200 - 4000 cal BP is unexplained: climate change has been widely assumed (Dubois & Ferguson 1985; Bridge, Haggart & Lowe 1990; Gear & Huntley 1991) but anthropogenic activity has not been disproved (Birks 1975; Bennett 1995).

40|$|Oxygen isotope {{palaeoclimate}} records, {{preserved in}} moss tissue cellulose, are complicated by environmental {{influences on the}} relationships between source water inputs and evaporative conditions. We carried out stable isotope analyses of precipitation collected from the maritime Antarctic and cellulose extracted from co-located Chorisodontium aciphyllum dominated moss <b>peat</b> <b>bank</b> deposits accumulated since 1870 A. D. Analyses of stable oxygen and hydrogen isotope composition of summer precipitation on Signy Island (60. 7 °S, 45. 6 °W) established a local meteoric water line (LMWL) similar to both the global MWL and other LMWLs, and almost identical to the HadAM 3 isotope-enabled global circulation model output. The oxygen isotopic composition of cellulose (δ 18 OC) revealed little temporal variation between four moss peat banks on Signy Island since 1870. However, δ 18 OC followed two patterns with Sites A and D consistently 3 ‰ enriched relative to δ 18 OC values from Sites B and C. The growing moss surfaces at Sites A and D {{are likely to have}} been hydrated by isotopically heavier summer precipitation, whilst at Sites B and C, the moss banks are regularly saturated by the isotopically depleted snow melt streams. Laboratory experiments revealed that evaporative enrichment of C. aciphyllum moss leaf water by 5 ‰ occurred rapidly following saturation (ecologically equivalent to post-rainfall or snow melt periods). In addition to the recognized source water-cellulose fractionation extent of 27 [*]±[*] 3 ‰, such a shift would account for the 32 ‰ difference measured between δ 18 O of Signy Island precipitation and cellulose...|$|E

Spiny lobsters sheltered among mangrove prop roots, in undercut <b>peat</b> <b>banks</b> and under corals near islands, and they ranged in size from newly recruited juveniles to subadults. Lobsters prefened to shelter under large stony corals, but their use of mangrove prop roots nd undercut <b>peat</b> <b>banks</b> increased when the density of corals was low. Den residence time and distance moved within a site were similar at islands isolated by deep water channels and islands separated by shallow seagrass beds, but {{as a consequence of}} high immigration rates, population sizes were highest near shallow islands. Predation on newly settled juveniles was greater in seagrass and coral crevices than in mangrove prop roots, whereas the survival of largerjuveniles was higher in mangroves and coral patch reefs than in seagrass. These results suggest that mangrove habitats may function as a nursery for juvenile spiny lobsters but that the use of this habitat depends on shelter characteristics and the isolation of islands...|$|R

40|$|Signy Island, {{maritime}} Antarctic, {{lies within}} {{the region of the}} Southern Hemisphere that is currently experiencing the most rapid rates of environmental change. In this study, peat cores up to 2 m in depth from four moss banks on Signy Island were used to reconstruct changes in moss growth and climatic characteristics over the late Holocene. Measurements included radiocarbon dating (to determine peat accumulation rates) and stable carbon isotope composition of moss cellulose (to estimate photosynthetic limitation by CO 2 supply and model CO 2 assimilation rate). For at least one intensively 14 C-dated Chorisodontium aciphyllum moss <b>peat</b> <b>bank,</b> the vertical accumulation rate of peat was 3. 9 mm yr− 1 over the last 30 years. Before the industrial revolution, rates of peat accumulation in all cores were much lower, at around 0. 6 – 1 mm yr− 1. Carbon- 13 discrimination (Δ), corrected for background and anthropogenic source inputs, was used to develop a predictive model for CO 2 assimilation. Between 1680 and 1900, there had been a gradual increase in Δ, and hence assimilation rate. Since 1800, assimilation has also been stimulated by the changes in atmospheric CO 2 concentration, but a recent decline in Δ (over the past 50 – 100 years) can perhaps be attributed to documented changes in temperature and/or precipitation. The overall increase in CO 2 assimilation rate (13 C proxy) and enhanced C accumulation (14 C proxy) are consistent with warmer and wetter conditions currently generating higher growth rates {{than at any time in}} the past three millennia, with the decline in Δ perhaps compensated by a longer growing season...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. Polar bears fasting on land {{along the}} western coast of Hudson Bay during the open water period, from late July through early November, {{excavate}} three different types of structures, which we termed pits, deep dens, and shallow dens. Pits were shallow excavations found {{on the tops of}} banks or beach ridges, whereas both deep and shallow dens were dug into frozen <b>peat</b> <b>banks.</b> Pits were used as temporary resting places. The function of shallow dens is less clear, although some bears have been observed resting in them. Deep dens, which have an entrance tunnel and an enlarged inner chamber, are similar in size and structure to maternity dens dug in snow by female polar bears elsewhere in their range. Deep and shallow dens are primarily occupied by lone females, most of which are pregnant, while pits are generally occupied by adult males and are used more during summer than in autumn. Pregnant polar bears in western Hudson Bay give birth between mid-November and mid-December, by which time snowdrifts suitable for the construction of maternity dens have not yet formed in most years. Thus, because earth dens represent the only consistently suitable environment available at the time of parturition, we suggest most cubs in western Hudson Bay are born in them. Consequently, the availability of suitable habitat for the construction and use of earth dens is probably critical to the survival of the polar bear population in Western Hudson Bay. Secondary benefits of earth dens to pregnant females, and to other bears during the warm weather in late summer, are that they help the bears to conserve energy by remaining cool and to avoid insect harassment.

40|$|The Antarctic Peninsula {{is one of}} {{the most}} rapidly warming regions on Earth, with air {{temperature}} increases of as much as 3 °C recorded since the 1950 s. However, the longer-term context of this change is limited and existing records, largely relying on ice core data, are not suitably located to be able to trace the spatial signature of change over time. We are working on a project exploiting stable isotope records preserved in moss <b>peat</b> <b>banks</b> spanning 10 degrees of latitude along the Antarctic Peninsula as an archive of late Holocene climate variability. Here we present a unique time series of past moss growth and soil microbial activity that has been produced from a 150 year old moss bank at Lazarev Bay, Alexander Island (69 °S), a site at the southern limit of significant plant growth in the Antarctic Peninsula region. These moss banks are ideal archives for palaeoclimate research as they are well-preserved by freezing, generally monospecific, easily dated by radiocarbon techniques, and have sufficiently high accumulation rates to permit decadal resolution. We use accumulation rates, cellulose δ 13 C and fossil testate amoebae to show that growth rates, assimilation and microbial productivity rose rapidly in the 1960 s, consistent with temperature change, although recently may have stalled, concurrent with other evidence. The increase in biological activity is unprecedented in the last 150 years. Along with work completed on Signy Island (60 °S), in the South Orkney Islands, in which we used carbon isotope evidence to show recent climate-related enhancement of CO 2 assimilation and peat accumulation rates in Antarctica, the observed relationships between moss growth, microbial activity and climate suggests that moss bank records have the potential to test the regional expression of temperature variability shown by instrumental data on the Antarctic Peninsula over centennial to millennial timescales, by providing long-term records of summer growth conditions, complementing the more distant and widely dispersed ice core records. We will conclude by placing the records into the wider context of the latest progress of analysis of moss bank cores obtained along the length of the Antarctic Peninsula and Scotia arc.

The study of profiles and fossil gley horizons allowed assessment of former water tables and provided data for the plan to replenish the reserve of fresh water by surface water from the rivers in the central parts of the coastal dune area of the Netherlands. North Kennemerland consists of old dunes (beach barriers or ridges), young dunes, peat and marine deposits. After the formation of the old marine sand and beach ridges (4000 - 2000 B.

50|$|Augusta {{township}} {{is located}} within the St. Lawrence Lowlands region; its southern-most boundary is the shoreline of the St. Lawrence River. Much of the area is situated on top of large layers of limestone and grey sandstone, which formed between 500—75 million years ago during the Paleozoic era and the Ordovician period. There is not much known about the period directly following the Ordovician period except that there were long periods of erosion followed by marine invasions. The last glaciation occurred around one million years ago which was responsible {{for many of the}} present-day landscape features. During this glaciation the entire area of what would become Augusta was covered in a sheet of ice around two to three miles in thickness. This ice sheet melted around 12,000 years ago as a result of climatic changes. A few thousand years after it melted the Ottawa—St. Lawrence Valley was flooded by an arm of the Atlantic Ocean to a depth of around 400 ft; geologists refer to this flooding as the Champlain Sea. The retreat of the Champlain Sea around 9,500 years ago left excessive stone surfaces in many areas. The bedrock and boulder clay in the eastern portion of the township are covered by beds of sand which are likely glacial-fluvial in origin; before the forest could take root many dunes were formed just north of the town of Prescott.

40|$|Microbial biomass and {{activity}} {{were examined in}} four different arctic sediments: littoral lake sediment and profundal lake sediment from Toolik Lake, Alaska, thaw pond sediment, and eroding river <b>bank</b> <b>peat.</b> The thaw pond sediment had the largest viable microbial biomass, while the profundal sediment had the smallest. Rates of glucose or acetate incorporation into lipids, glucose mineralization, and lignocellulose mineralization (all normalized per unit of biomass) were highest in the river peat sample, however. The kinetics of glucose mineralization in the profundal sediment were very different {{from those in the}} other three samples: although the initial rate of mineralization was five times lower than that in the peat and two times lower than that in the littoral and thaw pond sediments, the maximum amount of 14 CO 2 evolved from [14 C]glucose eventually equaled that in the peat and exceeded that in the littoral and thaw pond sediments by 2. 0 and 3. 5 times, respectively. Carex aquatilis [14 C-cellulose]- and [14 C-lignin]lignocellulose mineralization rates in the profundal sediment equaled or exceeded those in the littoral sediment after 16 and 46 days, but the pattern of nutrient limitation differed: the profundal sediment was the only one sampled that exhibited nitrogen limitation, while the other three sediments appeared to be limited primarily by phosphorus. The addition of nitrogen and phosphorus together had no cumulative effects on lignocellulose mineralization. When the rates of mineralization or incorporation of glucose are compared with those of lignocellulose, {{the results of this study}} indicate that profundal sediment communities may be better able to utilize the more recalcitrant substrates relative to the labile substrates than microbial communities from sediments rich in detritus and standing macrophytes...|$|R
40|$|During {{the years}} 1968 - 1970 a {{study has been}} made of the soft-bottom {{macrofauna}} (Coelenterata, Mollusca, Echiuroidea, Polychaeta, Archiannelida, Crustacea Malacostraca) of the estuaries of the rivers Rhine, Meuse, and Scheldt in the southwestern part of The Netherlands and of the adjacent part of the North Sea. 1751 samples were taken with 0. 1 and 0. 2 m² Van Veen grabs; in the intertidal zone several hundreds of samples were dug out, whereas further samples were taken for the analysis of interstitial polychaetes and archiannelids. Of the environmental factors especially salinity, sediment composition, current velocity, water temperature, oxygen saturation, turbidity, water pollution, exposure to waves, and the influence of ice have been investigated. Salinity shows a gradient from over 19. 0 promille Cl in the offshore waters to below 0. 3 promille Cl in the freshwater tidal area. Sediments mostly consist of medium, fine and very fine sands, but coarse sands, muds, and <b>peat</b> <b>banks</b> also occur. Current velocity is in general below 1. 5 m/sec., whereas water temperatures range between about 1 and 22 °C {{in the course of the}} year. Oxygen saturation is low in the rivers (0 - 70 %) and shows in the brackish water areas a gradient to values over 100 % reached in the marine parts of the estuaries. Water pollution shows the reverse pattern, but turbidity is highest in the brackish parts of the rivers. The larger part of the shores of the estuaries is sheltered against wave-action, but the beaches along the North Sea may be considered as semi-exposed. The influence of ice is most severe in the freshwater tidal area. Food is abundant in the estuaries, but less in the offshore parts of the North Sea. Taxonomical remarks have been made on, among others, Polinices polianus, Venus gallina striatula, Eteone foliosa, Nereis virens, Nephtys caeca, Aricidea minuta, Spio martinensis, Streblospio shrubsolii, Tharyx marioni, and Ophelia borealis. For 2 coelenterates, 19 gastropods, 44 lamellibranchs, 1 echiurid, 76 polychaetes, 4 archiannelids, 6 leeches, 15 decapod crustaceans, 2 mysids, 8 cumaceans, 1 tanaid, 9 isopods, 31 amphipods, 8 echinoderms, and 1 species of Branchiostoma the distribution is compared with the environmental data mentioned above or earlier papers treating this have been enumerated. For many species this comparison was carried out by means of a maximum-likelihood method. The following general trends in the distribution of the species studied over the estuarine area were observed. The biological limit of the estuarine environment at the seaward side could be placed where the level sea-bottom changes into a topography of tidal channels and shallows. At the landward side no clear-cut limit could be demonstrated. The brackish-water minimum in the species distribution demonstrated first by Remane (1934) could be confirmed for the estuaries of the Delta area. It appears that nearly all species occurring in the brackish water area also live or may live in either the more marine parts of the estuaries or in fresh water. Hence, nearly all may probably be considered as euryhaline marine or freshwater species. The fauna investigated could be divided in a relatively stenotherm component occurring only offshore and a relatively eurytherm component occurring offshore as well as in the estuaries. Below low water level no species could be demonstrated to be restricted by hydrostatic pressure to a certain depth range. Only three species could be shown to be restricted to the intertidal zone. Several species proved to be restricted to a certain sediment range. Of the species occurring in the brackish water area most appeared to prefer muddy sediments. Therefore, species considered as brackish-water species probably often are really euryhaline inhabitants of mud-bottoms. No species could be shown to be governed directly in its distribution by the exposure to wave-action, but many proved to be so indirectly by the nature of the sediment. Some species probably were inhibited in their occurrence by a high turbidity. Pollution and low values for the oxygen saturation could be shown to be inhibiting for several species in the freshwater tidal area, but for only very few in the brackish tidal area. Shortage of food probably is the reason for the absence from the offshore waters of some species common in the seaward parts of the estuaries. It proved to be impossible to apply any biological brackish water subdivision to the estuaries of the Delta area. The subdivisions proposed earlier could be correlated to hydrographical irregularities of the estuaries. The species characteristic for the brackish water stretch of the estuaries of the Delta area are demonstrated to occur in nearly all estuaries and brackish waters along the Atlantic coasts of Europe. Some species also occur in the western part of the Mediterranean. This European estuarine brackish-water fauna, however, is nearly completely different with regard to species composition from similar brackish water faunas in South Africa, S. E. Asia, New Zealand, and N. Siberia, and along the Pacific as well as along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of N. America. Hence, a similarity of brackish-water faunas all over the world does not exist. The species diversity proved to be lowest in the brackish parts of the estuaries and in the intertidal zone of the freshwater tidal area. Especially intertidal sand-bottoms show a gradient from a high number of species in the beaches along the North Sea to nearly no species in the sand flats of the freshwater tidal area; intertidal mud bottoms and subtidal sand bottoms show a comparable pattern. Because the brackish water areas lodge a relatively high number of species introduced from other parts of the world, they are supposed to be undersaturated with regard to the number of species occurring. Omnivores are relatively abundant,in the brackish parts of the estuaries, so the few species occurring apparently occupy wide niches. The percentage of species with pelagic larvae decreases strongly from the sea to the river, whereas the number of species with a non-pelagic development shows the reverse pattern. Pollution, turbidity, size of brackish waters and the critical salinity hypothesis of Khlebovich are ruled out as an explanation for the species minimum in brackish waters. Instability of temperature and salinity partially explain this phenomenon, but a satisfactory explanation for the exceptions only is provided by the time-stability hypothesis of Sanders. It is shown that the history of the N. W. European estuaries during the Pleistocene glaciations sufficiently explains the poverty of brackish water species in these estuaries. Also for other brackish water faunas, geological history probably forms a reasonable explanation for their poverty...|$|R
