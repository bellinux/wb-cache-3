30|$|Generally, {{there are}} two {{commonly}} used types of redundancies - standby redundancy and active or <b>parallel</b> <b>redundancy.</b> In standby redundancy, a redundant component is attached {{in such a way}} that it starts functioning immediately after the failure of the component to which it is attached. <b>Parallel</b> <b>redundancy</b> is used when it is difficult or not possible to replace the failed components during operation of the system. The redundant components are connected in parallel with the components of the system, and they function simultaneously with the original components. In this paper, the active or <b>parallel</b> <b>redundancy</b> at component level is considered to increase the system life stochastically. It has been noted in Barlow and Proschan [1] that in the case of active redundancy, component-wise redundancy works much better than the system-wise redundancy.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—We {{present a}} novel {{lossless}} universal source coding algorithm that uses parallel computational units {{to increase the}} throughput. The length-N input sequence is partitioned into B blocks. Processing each block indepen-dently of the other blocks can accelerate the computation {{by a factor of}} B, but degrades the compression quality. Instead, our approach is to first estimate the minimum description length (MDL) source underlying the entire input, and then encode each of the B blocks in parallel based on the MDL source. With this two-pass approach, the compression loss incurred by using more parallel units is insignificant. Our algorithm is work-efficient, i. e., its computational complexity is O(N/B). Its redundancy is approximately B log(N/B) bits above Rissanen’s lower bound on universal coding performance, with respect to any tree source whose maximal depth is at most log(N/B).

3000|$|The {{intersection}} {{analysis of}} fractures is a standalone procedure, {{but it is}} also one link of a complete simulation task. For a certain region of study, the number of fractures, N f, is fixed. The workflow of the intersection analysis is essentially an enumeration process in which each pair of fractures is selected and successively tested against intersection. Thus, there are a total number of N f (N f  –  1)/ 2 pairs of fractures for the analysis. A simple method to parallelize this procedure is evenly dividing (as possible) the N f [...] fractures into [...] N_group groups according to the fractures’ ordinal numbers and selecting each fracture from the group to test it against every other fracture from the entire fracture pool. This approach exactly distributes the required analysis of all pairs of fractures into several groups. Thus, the complete task can be solved in <b>parallel</b> without <b>redundancy</b> with the total number of calculations equal to N f (N f  –  1)/ 2.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Reliable packet {{delivery}} within stringent delay constraints is of primal {{importance to}} industrial processes with hard real-time constraints, such as electrical grid monitoring. Because retransmission and coding techniques counteract the delay requirements, reliability is achieved through replication over multiple fail-independent paths. Existing solutions such as <b>parallel</b> <b>redundancy</b> protocol (PRP) replicate all packets at the MAC layer over parallel paths. PRP works best in local area networks, e. g., sub-station networks. However, {{it is not}} viable for IP layer wide area networks which {{are a part of}} emerging smart grids. Such a limitation on scalability, coupled with lack of security, and diagnostic inability, renders it unsuitable for reliable data delivery in smart grids. To address this issue, we present a transport-layer design: IP <b>parallel</b> <b>redundancy</b> protocol (iPRP). Designing iPRP poses non-trivial challenges in the form of selective packet replication, soft-state and multicast support. Besides unicast, iPRP supports multicast, which is widely using in smart grid networks. It duplicates only time-critical UDP traffic. iPRP only requires a simple software installation on the end-devices. No other modification to the existing monitoring application, end-device operating system or intermediate network devices is needed. iPRP has a set of diagnostic tools for network debugging. With our implementation of iPRP in Linux, we show that iPRP supports multiple flows with minimal processing and delay overhead. It is being installed in our campus smart grid network and is publicly available. I...|$|E
