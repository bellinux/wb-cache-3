The binding provisions of law concerning discretionary <b>powers</b> <b>of</b> <b>auditing</b> companies proprietary rights, to some extent, petrify the current auditing market structure.

Bearing in mind the vital influence of statutory auditors on companies functioning, and allowing the companies access to capital, it is advisable to abolish all binding restrictions and simultaneously strengthen the internal control mechanisms facilitating high quality of financial review and statutory auditors independence. The auditing services market is, most of all, subject to price competition. The binding requisition of statutory auditors (including auditing companies) salary disclosure intensifies mutual chain <b>of</b> <b>audit</b> pricing dependence and restricts competition.

40|$|Despite {{the growing}} {{literature}} {{on the market for}} audit services, to date no study has examined the determinants <b>of</b> <b>audit</b> fees for the smallest auditees in the market. This study therefore provides some new theory and evidence on the determinants <b>of</b> the <b>audit</b> fees <b>of</b> micro-firms operating in the UK manufacturing sector. A key finding of the study is that in the highly competitive market under consideration, independent small auditees willingly paid a premium to be audited by a mid-tier or a (then) Big Six auditor, with the latter commanding the higher premium. It is concluded that {{these findings are consistent with}} Big Six (and, to a lesser extent, mid-tier) auditors commanding a brand premium stemming from the (perceived) higher quality audit conducted by large auditors, for which small firms are willing to pay a premium in order to benefit from associated 'reputational' and 'signalling' effects. The common finding that the explanatory <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>audit</b> fee models declines as a function of firm size is also examined. The empirical analysis confirms this effect, but evidence is offered that, rather than resulting from model misspecification, it is likely that <b>audit</b> prices <b>of</b> the smallest auditees are relatively insensitive to variations in corporate size, which may result from lower incremental economies of scale and minimum pricing...|$|R

It is informed by Michael Power’s Audit Society (1999) and associated works, which present audit as a collection of ideas which shape how society defines control, accountability and transparency. The premise of this doctoral research is that the age of performance assessment in the NHS is evidence <b>of</b> <b>Power’s</b> <b>Audit</b> Society in action. A longitudinal analysis of annual Overview Reports produced by Audit Scotland, which symbolise the national audit body’s identity relative to the NHS, explores the impact which the performance assessment regime had upon the evolution <b>of</b> the national <b>audit</b> body and demonstrates the capacity <b>of</b> a national <b>audit</b> body to forge its own role in performance assessment and in doing so shift its identity from traditional external auditor to authoritative commentator on performance. A recent performance crisis in a Scottish NHS board {{is the subject of a}} case study which explores the role <b>of</b> <b>audit</b> when significant gaming is uncovered in a previously high-trust system. This case demonstrates how the ritual appeal <b>of</b> <b>audit</b> can be mobilised by the government to restore public confidence in reported improvements in performance across the whole NHS. The organisational impact <b>of</b> <b>audit</b> on performance management is explored through an observation-based case study set in a Scottish NHS board, which traces interactions between the main actors in audit and performance networks.
