50|$|Maringá {{has five}} {{shopping}} malls: Avenida Center Mall, Cidade Mall, Mandacaru Boulevard Mall, Maringá Park Mall (formerly Aspen Park Mall) and Catuaí Maringá Mall, {{this is the}} second largest shopping mall in the State of Paraná (behind only Londrina Catuaí Mall).The commercial vocation of Maringá can be proven by dynamism and variety of items offered by companies from the sectors of food products, pharmaceuticals, clothing, appliances, fittings, bookstores, restaurants, snack bars. And for being a polo wholesaler, commodity prices are also competitive. These factors combine to attract consumers from different regions of Paraná, southwest of São Paulo and some cities in Mato Grosso and Mato Grosso do Sul.The companies act in at least seven segments of the wholesale market: food, dry goods and offal, paper, glass, textiles, wood, auto <b>parts</b> <b>and</b> <b>appliances.</b> Not to mention the many garment industries, which basically sell them at wholesale.The city houses the Maringa and Region Convention & Visitors Bureau, an organization of character and independent nonprofit whose goal is to develop the regional economy by encouraging tourism events. Established and maintained by public and private initiatives related to tourism and events industry, it is responsible for planned development of the same, including the city effectively in the national and international tourist circuits.|$|E
40|$|Software {{development}} tools are com-puter programs that help developers create other programs. Such tools {{have been in}} use {{since the early days}} of com-puting to improve the efficiency of the development process by automating mun-dane translation operations and bringing the level of abstraction closer to the appli-cation engineer. Nowadays, {{development tools}} are used in a variety of safety-critical applications, including the aviation, auto-motive, space, nuclear, railroad, medical, and military industries, and contribute to the risks associated with using respective products. Despite these risks to society, development tools are rarely qualified in a sense comparable to product certification in regulated industries. The objective of this article is to look at the current state of the tool qualification process, identify the issues, and propose recommendations for potential improvement, focusing on the aviation industry. System Certification Versus Software Tool Qualification Certification of airborne equipment is typ-ically achieved through the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) authoriza-tion of a type certificate (the entire air-craft), supplemental type certificate (new equipment in a specific aircraft), or a tech-nical standard order (minimum perfor-mance standard for materials, <b>parts,</b> <b>and</b> <b>appliances</b> used on civil aircraft). A special committee (SC- 145) of the Radio Tech-nical Commission for Aeronautics (RTCA) convened in 1980 to establish guidelines for developing airborne systems. Th...|$|E

The results have shown that this method could identify states of breakdown equipment {{for the purpose of}} diagnosis of failures of mechanical system accurately. 1 ． Introductions During the operation of mechanical system, the rate occurrence of its <b>parts</b> <b>and</b> <b>appliance</b> is due to failure of bearings, which can account about 30 %. If could we find and predict the failures and types of bearings, and take some measures on time, then eliminate failures at the beginning, it will pose the meaning of reality on perfection of equipment and safe of workmen.

Engineering plastics that are able to replace metal, {{play an important role in}} achieving those require-ments. Since these engineering plastics are available in a variety of chemical compositions and can, in additions, be modi-fied by reinforcement with a variety of fiber materials as well as fillers or by forming polymer alloys, it is easy to design a suitable plastic material for a given appliance. Furthermore, Super-engineering plastics, which are characterized by combin-ing much higher heat distortion temperature with excellent mechanical strength are being applied to mechanical and struc-tural components <b>and</b> <b>parts</b> of <b>appliances</b> as well as to electronic components <b>and</b> <b>parts.</b> In this paper, the engineering plas-tics and super-engineering plastics being applied to office appliances in country are outlined by each plastic type. 1...|$|R

In the Second Taiwan Strait Crisis, the Soviet Union {{under the leadership of}} Nikita Khrushchev recommended the internationalization of the Taiwan Question and appealed to the United Nations and other multilateral organizations to erase the crisis, further, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union called for the Ten Nations Summit in New Delhi to discuss the issue and eradicate the military tension on 27 September 1958 and undermined as one of the precursors of the latter Sino-Soviet split. Since the formation of the Russian Federation, Taiwan has exported many ferric materials to Russia in 2004-2005. In 2005, the total amount of the trade between the two economies was $2,188,944,473. Russia also has a representative office in Taipei, and Republic of China has a representative office in Moscow.
