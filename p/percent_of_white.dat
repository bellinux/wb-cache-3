25|$|Most white Americans in the 1950s {{were opposed}} to interracial {{marriage}} and did not see laws banning interracial marriage as an affront {{to the principles of}} American democracy. A 1958 Gallup poll showed that 94 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>white</b> Americans disapproved of interracial marriage. However, attitudes towards bans on interracial marriage quickly changed in the 1960s.|$|E
25|$|One notable Afrikaner {{nationalist}} organisation was the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging(AWB), {{a political}} and former paramilitary group. The group {{had the support of}} an estimated 5–7 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>white</b> South Africans in 1988. The organisation was beset by personal and militant scandals in the late 1980s and early 1990s that led to diminished support. This organisation was however never able to garner substantial Afrikaner support, which was held by the National Party until its dissolution.|$|E
25|$|In 1958 Robert Stuckert {{produced}} a statistical analysis using historical census data and immigration statistics. He {{concluded that the}} growth in the White population could not be attributed solely to births in the White population and immigration from Europe, but was also due to people identifying as white who were partly black. He concluded that 21 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>white</b> Americans had some recent African-American ancestors. He also concluded that the majority of Americans of known African descent were partly European and not entirely sub-Saharan African.|$|E
30|$|Drawing {{consistent}} inferences with schooling data drawn {{these two}} ways is in principle quite simple {{if the two}} types of questions have a similar structure of measurement error. Unfortunately, for the 1990 Census, Black et al. (2003) document that the education questions exhibit significant measurement error and that the degree of measurement error is correlated with race. Moreover, there was a dramatic increase in the educational attainment of Americans over the period. For instance, in 1940 88 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> blacks and 64 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>whites</b> between the ages of 25 and 60 did not have a high school education, and only 2 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> blacks and 8 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>whites</b> had a bachelor’s degree or better. By 2000, only 9 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> blacks and 5 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>whites</b> did not have a high school degree while fully 33 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>whites</b> and over 19 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> blacks had a bachelor’s degree or better.|$|R
5000|$|Reports {{analyzing}} the economic mobility of African-Americans {{compared to that}} <b>of</b> <b>whites</b> have found stark differences. One report found that 53 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> blacks born in the bottom income quintile remain there as adults, while only 33 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>whites</b> do. [...] Research has {{also found that the}} children of black middle-class families are more likely to fall out of the middle class.|$|R
5000|$|From the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (spanning from 2009 to 2013 which {{included}} data {{from more than}} 4,000 Native Americans and 170,000 whites), and The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System survey (conducted between 2011 and 2013, covered more than 21,000 Native Americans and 1 million <b>whites)</b> about 17 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>whites</b> and Native Americans were binge drinkers. When asked about {{the last time they}} had a drink, 40% <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> Native Americans had a drink during the previous month, compared to 43 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>whites</b> who did consume alcohol in the previous month. Despite only drinking marginally less than white people, Native Americans may be more vulnerable to the risks associated with drinking because of other issues, such as a lack of access to health care, safe housing and clean water ...|$|R
500|$|The city {{reached its}} highest {{recorded}} census population in 1950, reaching 856,796, and its population peaked {{in the early}} 1950s with approximately 880,000 residents. However, new highway construction and increased automobile ownership enabled further suburbanization and population began a long decline. Another factor in the city's population loss was white flight, which began in earnest during the late 1950s and continued during the 1960s and 1970s. From 1950 to 1960, the city population declined by 13 percent to 750,026, and from 1960 to 1970, the city declined another 17 percent to 622,236. Of this decline, the white population declined primarily due to [...] "massive outward migration, primarily to the suburbs." [...] Between 1960 and 1970, a net 34 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>white</b> city residents moved out; in addition, city white death rates exceeded birth rates. By the early 1970s, the white population of the city had decreased significantly, particularly among those of child-bearing age. The black population of St. Louis saw a natural increase of 19.5 percent during the 1960s, with no gain or loss through migration; during that decade, the overall percentage of black city residents rose from 29 to 41 percent. However, the black population declined in size from 1968 to 1972 by nearly 20,000 residents, representing significant black out-migration from the city during the period. Many moved to suburban developments in St. Louis County.|$|E
2500|$|Romney has denounced what {{he calls}} the [...] "cesspool of {{obscenity}} known as pornography". At a commencement address before Regent University, the Evangelical Christian school founded by Pat Robertson, Romney said, [...] "Pornography and violence poison our music and movies and TV and video games.... The Virginia Tech shooter, like the Columbine shooters before him, had drunk from this cesspool." [...] In remarks to the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in 2008 Romney said that [...] "tolerance for pornography, even celebration of it, and sexual promiscuity, combined with the twisted incentives of government welfare, have led to today's grim realities: 68 percent of African-American kids born out of wedlock, 45 percent of Hispanic kids, 25 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>white</b> kids." ...|$|E
2500|$|The second concept {{included}} in Rossiter's explanation {{of women in}} science is territorial segregation. The term refers to how female employment is often clustered in specific industries or categories in industries. Women stayed at home or took employment in feminine fields while men left the home to work. Although {{nearly half of the}} civilian work force is female, women still comprise the majority of low-paid jobs or jobs that society considered feminine. Statistics show that 60 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>white</b> professional women are nurses, daycare workers, or schoolteachers. Territorial disparities in science are often found between the 1920s and 1930s, when different fields in science were divided between men and women. Men dominated the chemistry, medical sciences, and engineering, while women dominated the fields of botany, zoology, and psychology. The fields in which the majority of women are concentrated are known as the [...] "soft" [...] sciences and tend to have relatively low salaries.|$|E
5000|$|One <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> Detroit blacks favored [...] "total separation" [...] {{between the}} races in 1968, whereas 17 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> Detroit <b>whites</b> did. African-Americans {{supported}} [...] "integration" [...] by 88 percent, while only 24 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>whites</b> supported integration. Residents of the 12th Street area differed significantly from African-Americans {{in the rest of}} the city however. For example, 22 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> 12th Street blacks thought they should [...] "get along without whites entirely". Nevertheless, the Detroit Free Press survey of black Detroiters in 1968 showed that the highest approval rating for people was given to conventional politicians like Charles Diggs (27 percent) and John Conyers (22 percent) compared to Albert Cleage (4 percent).|$|R
5000|$|The {{number of}} Americans holding antisemitic views {{declined}} markedly {{six years later}} when another ADL study classified only 12 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> the population—between 20 and 25 million adults—as [...] "most anti-Semitic." [...] Confirming the findings of previous surveys, both studies also found that African Americans {{were significantly more likely}} than whites to hold antisemitic views, with 34 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> blacks classified as [...] "most anti-Semitic," [...] compared to 9 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>whites</b> in 1998.|$|R
50|$|Afrikaans, a {{language}} derived from Dutch, {{is the most}} widely spoken language in the western {{half of the country}} (Western and Northern Cape). It is spoken as first language by approximately 61 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>whites</b> and 76 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> Coloured (multiracial) people in the country. Afrikaans is also spoken widely across the centre and north of the country, as a second (or third or even fourth) language by Black South Africans living in farming areas.|$|R
2500|$|Parti-coloured poodles are {{recognized}} in poodle {{history as the}} original colouring of the poodle. A parti poodle has solid-coloured patches over a white coat. The coat will usually be white and colored in equal amounts, though it can vary with a larger <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>white.</b> [...] Registries prefer that parti poodles have the same points as its correlating solid-colored descendants. [...] Brown and white parti poodles have liver-colored noses, eye rims and lips, dark or self-colored toenails and amber eyes. This is also permitted, but not preferred, in apricot and white parti poodles. Black/white, Blue/white, and silver/white poodles have black noses, eye rims and lips, black or self-colored toenails and very dark eyes. When the dog has markings that resemble those of a tuxedo, it is called a [...] "tuxedo" [...] poodle. The upper coat is solid: head, back, tail; and the lower coat is white: neck, chest, abdomen, and legs, making up usually 40% {{or more of the}} coat.|$|E
2500|$|Similarly, in a Wall Street Journal/NBC {{poll taken}} between March 24 and March 25, 63 percent of {{registered}} voters {{said that they had}} been following the Wright story [...] "very closely" [...] or [...] "somewhat closely". 85 percent said that they were disturbed [...] "a great deal" [...] or [...] "somewhat" [...] by Wright's comments. 46 percent said that they had heard or seen most of Obama's speech, and another 23 percent heard or saw news coverage of the speech. [...] Of those who had seen or heard the speech, 55 percent were satisfied with Obama's explanation of his relationship with Wright, and 44 percent said they were reassured about Obama's thinking and beliefs on the issue of race. (46 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>white</b> voters who saw the speech said that they were still uncertain or doubtful about Obama's thinking and beliefs on race.) In this poll, Obama and Clinton were tied among Democratic voters with 45 percent each; in a hypothetical general election matchup against John McCain, Obama lead slightly (44 to 42 percent) while Clinton trailed McCain slightly (44 to 46 percent).|$|E
2500|$|In {{terms of}} the white population, the top five percent or so were {{planters}} who possessed growing wealth and increasing political power and social prestige. They controlled the local Anglican church, choosing ministers and handling church property and disbursing local charity. They sought elected and appointed offices. [...] About 60 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>white</b> Virginians {{were part of a}} broad middle class that owned substantial farms; By the second generation, death rates from malaria and other local diseases had declined so much that a stable family structure was possible. The bottom third owned no land, and verged on poverty. Many were recent arrivals, or recently released from indentured servitude. [...] Social stratification was most severe in the Northern Neck, where the Fairfax family had been given a proprietorship. In some districts there 70 percent of the land was owned by a handful of families, and three fourths of the whites had no land at all. In the frontier districts, large numbers of Irish and German Protestants had settled, often moving down from Pennsylvania. Tobacco was not important there; farmers focused on hemp, grain, cattle, and horses. Entrepreneurs had begun to mine and smelt the local iron ores.|$|E

5000|$|Most anti-Italian hostility in the United States was {{directed}} at Southern Italians, particularly Sicilians. This was especially true in the American South, where Southern Italians and Sicilians were not considered full-fledged members of the [...] "white race". The U.S. Bureau of Immigration reinforced this distinction, classifying Northern and Southern Italians as two different races. Between 1890 and 1910, Sicilians made up less than 4 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> the <b>white</b> male population, yet were roughly 40 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> the <b>white</b> victims <b>of</b> southern lynch mobs.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To examine {{racial and}} ethnic {{differences}} in place of death, adjusting for likely confounders. DESIGN: A retrospective cohort analyzed using multinomial logistic regression. SETTING: United States in 1993. PARTICIPANTS: A nationally representative sample of 22, 658 deaths in 1993 from the National Mortality Followback Survey. MEASUREMENTS: Place of death as determined on the death certificate, with controls for age, sex, income, education, and cause of death. The outcomes of interest were death in a hospital during an inpatient stay, death in a nursing home, death in a private residence, or death in some other place. RESULTS: After adjustment, 43 % <b>of</b> <b>whites</b> die after an inpatient hospital stay, as do 50 % of blacks and 56 % of Mexican Americans. Twenty <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>whites,</b> 22 % <b>of</b> Mexican Americans, and 14 % of blacks die in nursing homes. Twenty-two <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>whites,</b> 18 % <b>of</b> blacks, and 9 % of Mexicans die in a private residence. CONCLUSIONS: There are substantial differences between whites, blacks, and Mexican Americans in place of death that cannot be explained by differences in age, sex, income, education, and causes of death between the groups...|$|R
