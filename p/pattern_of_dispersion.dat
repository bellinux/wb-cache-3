50|$|Random distribution, {{also known}} as {{unpredictable}} spacing, is the least common form of distribution in nature and occurs when {{the members of a}} given species are found in environments in which the position of each individual is independent of the other individuals: they neither attract nor repel one another. Random distribution is rare in nature as biotic factors, such as the interactions with neighboring individuals, and abiotic factors, such as climate or soil conditions, generally cause organisms to be either clustered or spread. Random distribution usually occurs in habitats where environmental conditions and resources are consistent. This <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>dispersion</b> is characterized by the lack of any strong social interactions between species. For example; When dandelion seeds are dispersed by wind, random distribution will often occur as the seedlings land in random places determined by uncontrollable factors. Oyster larvae can also travel hundreds of kilometers powered by sea currents, which can result in their random distribution.|$|E

Furthermore, for most species, there was a positive association between the degree of vertical differentiation in abundance across the thermocline, and the degree of temperature differentiation in the stratified water column.

The core finding was that vowel dispersion, i. e. distance {{from the center of the}} talker’s F 1 /F 2 space, was greater in words that represent difficult recognition targets, due to competition from other words in the lexicon (‘hard ’ words) than in easy recognition targets (‘easy ’ words).

Extending the investigation to all monophthongs in the database, we find that recognition difficulty fails to have a significant effect on dispersion when effects of segmental context are brought under statistical control. We conclude that the <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>dispersion</b> in Wright (1997) is not due to lexical competition, but is most likely due to segmental context, particularly place of articulation of consonants preceding and following the target vowels.

Larger, more mature worms produced less lactate and, at higher densities. worms tended to produce more acetate and succinate (pathways with a higher energy yield than lactate) and less ethanol. Thus, both more developed worms and high population density are associated with a shift from cytosolic to mitochondrial metabolism.

This pattern is often accepted as the major rule driving {{most of the other}} physiological, biological and ecological processes. Foraging on mobile prey, for instance, is assumed to be enhanced by schooling behaviour. Current theory assumes then that foraging is only possible for obligatory gregarious predatory fish from dawn to dusk. However, offshore mesopelagic communities perform vertical migrations and are out of reach for most oceanic pelagic predators during the day (with the exception of some apex predators, e. g. swordfish or big-eye tuna). To investigate how fish may overcome this apparent contradiction, we studied the 3 -dimensional spatial strategy of the South Pacific jack mackerel Trachurus murphyi according to the abiotic and biotic conditions of the habitat. Data came from acoustic surveys performed in central Chile in 1997, 1998 and 1999. Our results show that the jack mackerel distribution was driven by prey during the night when foraging, and related to the hydrology when resting during the day in {{the upper part of the}} oxycline. Fish were more aggregated at night than during the day, probably because jack mackerel cycles of schooling behaviour depend primarily on prey availability. This 'atypical' behaviour could be an adaptation of gregarious pelagic fish to an oceanic ecosystem.

The simulated results match very well with the experimental results close to the source of emission but decay to the ambient concentrations much slower. The effects of the initial emission concentration, exit velocity, exit direction and crosswind intensity have been investigated parametrically. The initial pollutant concentration will increase the local concentrations but the <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>dispersion</b> remains the same.

Visible <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> plant <b>dispersion</b> can be studied in Oliver's Woods as well, including uniform, random, and clumped patterns. The area has a trail for people to follow and a creek running through the lower elevated area.|$|R
40|$|Anthroponymy and {{demographic}} behavior Extensive use {{has long been}} made of censuses of households as indicators of demographic change in the late Middle Ages. These serial documents, which often {{take the form of}} name lists of "heads of households" (chefs de feux), have served primarily as source material for anthroponymic studies. Yet changes in the patronymic stock can also yield demographic information. The emergence and disappearance of surnames, as well as the <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>dispersion</b> and concentration <b>of</b> groups of homonymous households, no doubt reflect the instability of surnames in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. But in all likelihood these phenomena are also an indication of mortality rates, migration patterns, and the development of lineages. They afford an insight into—if not a way of quantifying—these forms of demographic behavior, which influenced the changes in the number of households. The article uses an example from Burgundy to test the validity of this working hypothesis. Beck Patrice.

We investigate <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> effective <b>dispersion</b> in the hierarchical, biological transport network formed by Physarum polycephalum. We demonstrate that a change in topology - pruning in the foraging state - causes a large increase in effective dispersion throughout the network. By comparison, changes {{in the hierarchy of}} tube radii result in smaller and more localized differences. Pruned networks capitalize on Taylor dispersion to increase the dispersion capability.
