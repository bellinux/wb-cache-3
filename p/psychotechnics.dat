25|$|In 1920, Édouard Claparède and Pierre Bovet {{created a}} new applied {{psychology}} organization called the International Congress of <b>Psychotechnics</b> Applied to Vocational Guidance, later called the International Congress of <b>Psychotechnics</b> and then the International Association of Applied Psychology. The IAAP is considered the oldest international psychology association. Today, at least 65 international groups deal with specialized aspects of psychology. In response to male predominance in the field, female psychologists in the U.S. formed National Council of Women Psychologists in 1941. This organization became the International Council of Women Psychologists after World War II, and the International Council of Psychologists in 1959. Several associations including the Association of Black Psychologists and the Asian American Psychological Association have arisen to promote non-European racial groups in the profession.|$|E
25|$|Psychology {{was first}} {{recognized}} as a major subject at the university by Professor Imre Sándor, who realized {{that the study of}} psychology {{is just as important as}} that of pedagogy. Accordingly, on 20 October 1926, he filed his petition to the directors of the university for the establishment of a fundamentally different, modern Department of Pedagogy and Psychology. György Málnási Bartók, the Professor of the Department of Philosophy, was an avid supporter of the petition, since the tuition of Psychology had been the responsibility of his department at that period. In his petition, Imre Sándor listed the following fields and branches as belonging to the new Department's sphere of competence: General Psychology, Developmental Psychology, Psychology of Differences, Education of Backward Children, <b>Psychotechnics,</b> and Pedagogical Somatology.|$|E

5000|$|In Psychotechnic League {{stories and}} books, <b>psychotechnics</b> stands for human peace and prosperity, for {{unification}} of Earth and afterwards {{of the entire}} Solar System [...] - [...] as {{against the forces of}} militarism, nationalism, political and religious extremism, which have caused World War III and might, if not stopped, cause [...] "another war which humanity may not survive" [...] (as described in [...] "Marius"). On these terms, Anderson is obviously on the side of <b>psychotechnics</b> and the characters representing the author's point of view act accordingly.|$|E
5000|$|In [...] "Question and Answer", however, <b>psychotechnics</b> [...] - [...] having {{succeeded in}} {{establishing}} {{peace and stability}} [...] - [...] sets itself squarely against spaceward expansion, seeking to keep humanity within the protecting cocoon of the Solar System and prevent its spread throughout the Galaxy. With this at stake, Anderson (and the character representing his point of view) turns against <b>psychotechnics</b> and for galactic expansion. This is inevitable, given Anderson's staunch support and advocacy of space flight in all periods of his fiction and non-fiction writing.|$|E

40|$|The {{relationship}} between <b>psychotechnic</b> and education levels and smoking habits was evaluated {{in a population}} of 2, 430 Belgian male army conscripts who were 18 - 29 y of age.

50|$|By {{the late}} 22nd century, the <b>Psychotechnic</b> Institute becomes {{a victim of}} its own success. An {{automated}} economy has created massive unemployment, which gives rise to an antitechnology movement called Humanism (a term having {{little to do with}} the historical philosophy of Humanism, and is indeed in many ways antithetical to it). Around 2170 the Humanists seize control of Earth, withdraw from the Solar Union, and abolish the <b>Psychotechnic</b> Institute. The Humanist regime quickly grows unpopular, and is overthrown by a popular uprising aided by Mars and Venus. However, the <b>Psychotechnic</b> Institute is not revived, and in its absence technic civilization begins a slow and steady descent into extremism which results in a new dark age starting in the 24th century.|$|R

5000|$|After World War II, many {{scientists}} were forbidden from cooperation with foreign researchers. The scientific {{community of the}} Soviet Union became increasingly closed. In addition to that, the party continued declaring various new theories [...] "pseudo-scientific". Genetics, pedology and <b>psychotechnics</b> were already banned in 1936 by a special decree of the Central Committee. On August 7, 1948, the V.I. Lenin Academy of Agricultural Sciences announced that {{from that point on}} Lamarckian inheritance, the theory that personality traits acquired during life are passed on to offspring, would be taught as [...] "the only correct theory". Soviet scientists were forced to redact prior work, and even after this ideology, known as Lysenkoism, was demonstrated to be false, it took many years for criticism of it to become acceptable. After the 1960s, during the Khrushchev Thaw, a policy of liberalization of science was implemented. Lysenkoism was officially renounced in 1963.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the work}} of Richard K. Morgan, the Red Room {{recruits}} 28 orphan girls to raise them to become undetectable deep-cover agents to infiltrate China and the West.

These girls are made to believe that they were trained in ballet at the Bolshoi Theatre. During her training, Natalia Romanova was contacted by The Enchantress, who manipulated her just to suggest that Romanova may be freed, only to prevent her from escaping - however, Romanova's effort attracted attention of the Red Room's organizers, who would have otherwise [...] "discarded" [...] Romanova. Natasha was paired with handler Ivan Petrovitch. Furthermore, the girls all received a special treatment designed by biochemist Lyudmila Kudrin. The Kudrin treatment allows women to appear young for many decades, as well as healthy and resilient at superhuman levels.|$|E
5000|$|Further, {{the outcome}} of World War III, as well as events in the centuries {{immediately}} following the war, is inconsistent between [...] "Question and Answer" [...] and the <b>Psychotechnic</b> League stories.

5000|$|Although [...] "Question and Answer" [...] {{is similar}} in {{background}} to the stories that make up Anderson's <b>Psychotechnic</b> League future history, Anderson himself did not include [...] "Question and Answer" [...] in a timeline of the <b>Psychotechnic</b> League stories that he created to accompany the novella [...] "The Snows of Ganymede" [...] in the Winter 1955 issue of Startling Stories, even though the story had already been published in Astounding by then.
