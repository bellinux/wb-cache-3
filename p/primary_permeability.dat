40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether the conceptus directs the formation of a tight- and adherens-dependent permeability barrier formed by the primary decidual zone and normal progression of decidual cell differentiation during embryo implantation. Four artificial models of decidualization were used, some apparently more physiological than others. The results show that both the formation of the permeability barrier and decidual cell differentiation of three of the artificial models were quite different from that of pregnant uteri. One artificial model of decidualization, namely pseudopregnant animals receiving concanavalin A-coated Sepharose bead transfers on d 2. 5 of pseudopregnancy, better recapitulated the decidual changes that occur in the pregnant uterus undergoing decidualization. This included the formation of a <b>primary</b> decidual zone-like <b>permeability</b> barrier and decidual growth. This model also exhibited similar temporal changes of the expression of genes involved in decidualization that are markers of decidual cell differentiation. Overall, the results of this study indicate that some models of inducing decidualization artificially produce responses that are more similar to those occurring in the pregnant uterus, whereas others are quite different.

30|$|A {{variety of}} other {{datasets}} {{can be used as}} a proxy for the favorability of each stratigraphic unit to host fracture permeability and fluid flow. Pressure–temperature-spinner logs, for example, may reveal discrete flowing intervals in wells correlated to specific faults or lithologic intervals in the 3 D geologic map. This type of information may also be available on mud logs or well completion reports. Well construction reports (detailing depth of the casing ‘shoe,’ above which the well has been cemented with steel casing and therefore sealed off from the formation) can also provide information relevant to which lithologic intervals tend to host permeability intervals. In a productive geothermal field, intervals along production or injection wells that are cased with slotted liners, otherwise open to fluid flow, and/or correspond with fault zones can be interpreted within lithologies favorable for hosting permeability and fluid flow. If flowing intervals are not faulted, geothermal fluids may reside with <b>primary</b> stratigraphic <b>permeability</b> that is charged with upwelling fluids from nearby faults (Siler et al. 2016 a).|$|R

Volcanic rocks formed after volcano eruption, cooling, solidification, compaction and consolidation contain disconnected <b>primary</b> pores without <b>permeability.</b> Only after various geological transformations in later stages, they can have reservoir capacities.

40|$|Declining {{conventional}} hydrocarbon reserves {{coupled with}} {{technological advances and}} growing energy demands have triggered a shift in exploration of energy-rich Australian basins, with a progressive focus on unconventional energy sources, such as coal seam gas, shale gas and enhanced geothermal systems. Unconventional play viability is often heavily dependent {{on the presence of}} secondary permeability due to interconnected natural fractures, as they commonly exert a prime control over total permeability due to low <b>primary</b> <b>permeabilities.</b> The structural permeability of the Northern Perth, South Australian Otway, and Northern Carnarvon basins are characterised using an integrated approach combining geophysical wellbore logs, seismic attribute analysis and detailed structural descriptions of core and outcrop. Integration of these methods allows for the identification of faults and fractures over a range of scales, providing crucial permeability information. New stress orientation data is also interpreted, and allows for stress-based predictions of fracture reactivation to be made. This study represents the first attempt at generating a database of fracture properties for Australian sedimentary basins through the combination of several methodologies, and addresses three significant scientific questions: 1) What are the main factors controlling fracture reactivation in Australian basins? 2) Can 3 D seismic attributes be used to identify natural fractures in the subsurface beyond the wellbore? And, 3) Are electrically conductive fractures in image logs actually open to fluid flow? This study demonstrates that distinct correlations exist between natural structural fabrics identified in 3 D seismic attribute analysis and the natural fractures identified through interpretation of electrical resistivity image logs from petroleum wells, and supports the supposition that similar features at different scales are being identified. Fracture reactivation within the studied basins, in particular the Otway and Carnarvon basins, shows that fracture reactivation can become complex, and depend not only on the in-situ stress regime but also fracture fills, as well as local and regional structures. Natural fractures identified on image logs as being electrically conductive are generally assumed to be hydraulically conductive. However, Otway Basin core shows open fractures are rarer than image logs indicate, and this is likely due to the presence of fracture filling siderite. Siderite is an iron-carbonate mineral that may cause fractures to appear hydraulically conductive on image logs. The techniques outlined herein represent an effective method by which potential structural permeability can be assessed on a regional scale with various levels of data availability. This is demonstrated in several case studies of Australian sedimentary basins featuring varying datasets. Basin-wide structural permeability is constrained using a variety of data, ranging from predominantly using image logs supported by 3 D seismic, to performing a basin-wide assessment using image logs, 3 D seismic, core, and outcrop studies.

30|$|Apart {{from some}} very shallow {{aquifers}} (not explicitly {{resolved in the}} model), the lithological units addressed here are composed of almost impermeable rocks. The Ligurian unit comprises low-permeability shaly flysch and sandstones. Similarly, clayey-marly lithotypes constitute the TUaB. These units act as a cap rock for the shallow geothermal reservoir hosted in the Burano formation (Barelli et al. 2010; Fulignati et al. 2014; Romagnoli et al. 2010). The <b>primary</b> <b>permeability</b> of the evaporites of the Burano formation is also very low. However, as has been observed in the geothermal aquifers in Larderello (e.g. Romagnoli et al. 2010) and Monte Amiata (e.g. Fulignati et al. 2014), a secondary, fracture-induced permeability exists. This {{can be related to}} an extended sub-horizontal shearing of the Burano formation during the compressional stage followed by steep fractures during the extensional phase. In addition, the Burano formation has been described as vuggy, at least locally, due to calcite dissolution (Fulignati et al. 2014; Lugli 2001), which may contribute to its high permeability.|$|E

Preferential weathering of the biotite gneiss is a significant factor controlling well yield. Most of the yield in each of the two wells studied is from openings along lithologic contacts between the granite gneiss and biotite gneiss, or from openings along compositional layering within the biotite gneiss.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this thesis {{is to improve the}} understanding of the position and characteristics of karst conduits within a rock massif. Such a characterisation is an important issue in civil engineering and in hydrogeology. Today in practice dissolution voids are considered as random in most cases. However, it is obvious for karst researchers that dissolution void distribution is not random, but defined by parameters controlling the speleogenesis. We developed a method to analyse the 3 D geometry of cave systems in order to demonstrate from a statistical point of view that karst conduits position is not random. The analysis of several among the largest cave systems in the World (more than 1500 km of analysed cave conduits) confirmed for the first time quantitatively that the development and position of karst conduits under phreatic conditions is strongly related to a restricted number of so called inception horizons. An inception horizon – a concept introduced by Lowe (1992) – is a part of a lithostratigraphic succession that is particularly susceptible to the effects of the earliest cave forming processes by virtue of physical, lithological or chemical deviation from the predominant carbonate facies within the formation. We demonstrate that probably less than 10 % of the existing bedding partings of a limestone sequence are inception horizons and guide more than 70 % of the phreatic conduits. Our analysis clearly confirms that the influence of these horizons onto the 3 D geometry of cave systems is high. Based on the 3 D analysis of cave systems as well as on field verifications, 18 inception horizons in six cave systems have been selected for field characterisation and sampling in order to identify the properties and processes that makes these particular lithostratigraphic horizons favourable to karstification. Around 200 rock samples from the horizons and the surrounding rock mass have been analysed. The results evidence that inception horizons have a thickness of some centimetres to decimetres and {{that it is possible to}} distinguish between 3 types of inception horizons: Inception horizons where the cave inception took place within the inception horizon (type 1); characterized by a slightly higher <b>primary</b> <b>permeability,</b> pyrite and quartz contents and lower matrix contents than the surrounding rock mass. Usually, fractures propagate through or occur within these horizons. Inception horizons where the cave inception took place at the contact with the inception horizon (type 2); characterized by a lower <b>primary</b> <b>permeability</b> and carbonate contents, but higher pyrite contents than the surrounding rock mass. Fractures usually are ending at these horizons. Inception horizons where the cave inception took place along bedding plane fractures (type 3); already a slippage of just a few millimetres, striation, brecciation and surface irregularities enhance openings along the sliding plane and cause a significant increase in permeability. Furthermore it can be assumed that for the inception of horizons of type 1 the <b>primary</b> <b>permeability</b> will be the relevant factor at beginning of karstification, whereas both the matrix and the pyrite contents are the key factors during the later phases of cave inception and gestation. Whereas for further cave development the total carbonate content will be crucial. For inception horizons of type 2, we can assume that the low <b>primary</b> <b>permeability,</b> the clogging of the pores by the clay minerals, the high content of pyrite (production of aggressive solutions within the horizon that concentrates the dissolution along the contact to the surrounding rock) and the ending of the fractures at the horizon are responsible for the enhanced karstification at the contact during cave inception and gestation phases. Using simple hydrogeological numerical modelling we show that an epigenic karstic rock massif can be subdivided into four speleogenetic zones: 1) vadose cave development zone above the water table, 2) the phreatic cave development and 3) gestation zone within the first tens of metres of the phreatic zone and 4) below them the inception zone. Each of these zones is characterized by typical speleogenetic processes as well as dissolution void distribution. Further, it was possible to explain and reproduce schematically the 3 D pattern of different cave systems by using the position and orientation of the inception horizons and the history of the landscape evolution (i. e. the re- and discharge area). This forward analysis provides a first idea of the geometry of the conduits as well as a better understanding of the development of a karst system in time and space (vertical section). Finally, we evaluated the feasibility to combine the improved inception horizon hypothesis, to predict inception horizons, with other current applied methods to improve the prediction of dissolution voids. Furthermore, we proposed a scientific based risk assessment for underground engineering proposes. Essentially, it is now evidenced that it is possible to quantify the probability of karst occurrences inside a karst massif by reconstructing the hydrogeolgical history and identifying the few inception horizons that guide the karstification at a regional scale...|$|E

In the {{modeling}} of thermal recovery processes of heavy oil, {{it is important}} to know the oil <b>primary</b> relative <b>permeability</b> in the reservoir; moreover we have to be aware of effects of the temperature on oil relative permeability as well. In this study, a sand pack of quartz (SiO 2) has been used to simulate and make a porous medium. Quartz is naturally water wet. During experiments there was no change in the pore volume of the media at different temperatures because of the low expansion coefficient of quartz. The fluid used in experiments is engine oil 50. Glass pipes with length of 91 cm and diameter of 2. 6 cm have been used in the experiments. At first, columns have been filled with sand, which sand grains had different diameters, then carbon dioxide was injected to the columns to deplete the air in the pores, then the porous media have been saturated with water to calculate the porosity using the scale model. In addition according to Darcy’s law in steady state, the absolute permeability was calculated. In the next step, oil was injected to columns until the water saturation reached connate water saturation and finally, water injection was begun to get residual oil saturation (Sor). Experiments results showed that increase of temperature increases the oil relative permeability, note that wetability was constant. Increasing the temperature decreases the oil viscosity then this reduction causes the fluid to move easier and its velocity increases as well...|$|R

Moreover, small volumes of contaminated groundwater might spread over relatively large portions of the subsurface due to the small storage capacity of these discontinuities.

40|$|International audienceWe {{conducted}} a multidisciplinary study {{to analyze the}} structure and the hydrogeological functioning of an andesitic coastal aquifer and to highlight the importance of faults and associated rock fracturing on groundwater flow. A helicopter-borne geophysical survey with an unprecedented resolution (SkyTEM) was flown over this aquifer in 2013. TDEM resistivity, total magnetic intensity, geological and hydrogeological data from 30 boreholes and two pumping tests were correlated, including one which lasted an exceptional 15 months. We demonstrate that heterogeneous hydrodynamic properties and channelized flows result from tectonically-controlled aquifer compartmentalization along the structural directions of successive tectonic phases. Significant fracturing of the central compartment results in enhanced hydrodynamic properties of the aquifer and an inverse relationship between electrical resistivity and transmissivity. Basalts within the fractured compartment have lower resistivity and higher permeability than basalts outside the compartment. Pumping tests demonstrate that the key factor is the hydraulic conductivity contrast between compartments rather than the hydrodynamic properties of the fault structure. In addition, compartmentalization and associated transmissivity contrasts protect the aquifer from seawater intrusion.

A <b>primary</b> <b>permeability</b> defect was postulated in the pathogenesis of the disease. The {{aim of this study}} was to identify a possible genetic pattern in the distribution of CD and/or abnormal permeability. METHODS: Differential urinary excretion of lactulose and mannitol (L/ M) in complete CD families was determined. Controls included healthy families and families with ulcerative colitis. Pedigrees were used to compare the distribution of CD and/or increased permeability. RESULTS: The L/M was significantly increased in patients with CD. Seventeen of 67 first-degree relatives (25 %) had a ratio greater than the upper limit (P 95 = 0. 0170). Permeability results of CD families showed a highly significant familial aggregation. The lack of a genetic pattern in relation with CD and occurrence of disturbed permeability especially within generation, points toward a shared environmental factor. Five of 14 healthy spouses (36 %) of patients with CD had also an increased permeability, and prevalence of increased permeability was not higher in families with known familial occurrence (P = 0. 85). CONCLUSIONS: This large family study confirms an increased permeability in a subset of healthy relatives of patients with CD. However, the absence of a typical family pattern and the high prevalence in spouses is in favor of a common nongenetic factor or a subclinical disease manifestation. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Gliomas are a broad {{category}} of primary brain tumors arisingfrom glial stem/progenitor cells. They account for roughly 40 %of all primary brain and {{central nervous system}} tumors, and 78 % of malignant CNS tumors 1. Of the different glioma subtypes, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), a highly invasive and almost uniformly fatal tumor, is the most common. Standard treatment for GBM involves surgical debulking followed by combination treatment with radiotherapy (RT) and temozolomide (TMZ), an oral alkylating agent, followed by temozolomide alone. Despite such aggressive treat-ment, virtually all GBM patients relapse, and roughly 75 % do not survive beyond 2 years 2. GBM {{is among the most}} highly vascularized of all malignancies and relies upon angiogenesis for growth and histological progression 3. Angiogenesis in GBM, like all solid tumors, is mediated primarily by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which stimulates capillary sprouting from pre-existing vessels toward VEGF-expressing tumor cells. Tumor VEGF expression and angiogenesis are hypoxia-driven, but can be activated independently by different tumor cell mutations 4. Because VEGF is also the <b>primary</b> vascular <b>permeability</b> factor, excessive VEGF production in GBM disturbs the normal blood brain barrier—tumor capillaries leak fluid into the surrounding brain tissue, often causing extensive vasogenic edema with increased interstitial pressure and mass effect. Besides VEGF, angiogenesis in malignant glioma is also induced by basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), angiopoietin- 2 (Ang- 2), stem cell factor, and hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor through different signaling pathways 4, 5. Brain tumor vasculature may also be formed by the recruitment and differentiation of bone marrow-derived progenitor cells to form new vessels (vasculogenesis); by formation of fluid-transporting channels within the tumor (intussusception); and by co-option of pre-existing vessels 5. Co-option of normal host capillaries by infiltrating glioma cells is thought to be instrumental in GBM invasiveness, and a precursor to neovascularization 5, 6...|$|R

Moreover, epidermal vegf−/− mice display abnormal permeability barrier homeostasis, attributable to decreased VEGF signaling of epidermal lamellar body production; a paucity of dermal capillaries with reduced vascular permeability; and neither angiogenesis nor epidermal hyperplasia in response to repeated tape stripping (a model of psoriasiform hyperplasia). These results support a central role for epidermal VEGF in the maintenance of epidermal permeability barrier homeostasis and a link between epidermal VEGF production and both dermal angiogenesis {{and the development of}} epidermal hyperplasia. Because psoriasis is commonly induced by external trauma [isomorphic (Koebner) phenomenon] and is associated with a prominent permeability barrier abnormality, excess VEGF production, prominent angiogenesis, and epidermal hyperplasia, these results could provide a potential outside-inside mechanistic basis for the development of psoriasis...|$|R
40|$|Water {{content of}} the {{protoplast}} in situ within the fully hydrated dormant bacterial spore was quantified by use of a spore in which the complex of coat and outer (pericortex) membrane was genetically defective or chemically removed, as evidenced by susceptibility of the cortex to lysozyme and by permeability of the periprotoplast integument to glucose. Water content was determined by equilibrium permeability measurement with 3 H-labeled water (confirmed by gravimetric measurement) for the entire spore, with 14 C-labeled glucose for the integument outside the inner (pericytoplasm) membrane, and by the difference for the protoplast. The method was applied to lysozyme-sensitive spores of Bacillus stearothermophilus, B. subtilis, B. cereus, B. thuringiensis, and B. megaterium (four types). Comparable lysozyme-resistant spores, in which the outer membrane functioned as the <b>primary</b> <b>permeability</b> barrier to glucose, were employed as controls. Heat resistances were expressed as D 100 values. Protoplast water {{content of the}} lysozyme-sensitive spore types correlated with heat resistance exponentially in two distinct clusters, with the four B. megaterium types in one alignment, and with the four other species types in another. Protoplast water contents of the B. megaterium spore types were sufficiently low (26 to 29 %, based on wet protoplast weight) to account almost entirely for their lesser heat resistance. Corresponding values of the other species types were similar or higher (30 to 55 %), indicating that these spores depended on factors additional to protoplast dehydration for their much greater heat resistance...|$|E
40|$|Spores of Bacillus anthracis, the causative {{agent of}} anthrax, are {{enclosed}} by a prominent loose-fitting, balloon-like layer called the exosporium. Although the exosporium {{serves as the}} source of surface antigens and a <b>primary</b> <b>permeability</b> barrier of the spore, its molecular structure and function are not well characterized. In this study, we identified five major proteins in purified B. anthracis (Sterne strain) exosporia. One protein was the recently identified collagen-like glycoprotein BclA, which appears to be a structural component of the exosporium hair-like nap. Using a large panel of unique antispore monoclonal antibodies, we demonstrated that BclA is the immunodominant antigen on the B. anthracis spore surface. We also showed that the BclA protein and not a carbohydrate constituent directs the dominant immune response. In addition, the length of the central (GXX) n repeat region of BclA appears to be strain specific. Two other unique proteins, BxpA and BxpB, were identified. BxpA is unusually rich in Gln and Pro residues and contains several different tandem repeats, which also exhibit strain-specific variation. In addition, BxpA was found to be cleaved approximately in half. BxpB appears to be glycosylated or associated with glycosylated material and is encoded by a gene that (along with bclA) may be part of an exosporium genomic island. The other two proteins identified were alanine racemase and superoxide dismutase, both of which were reported {{to be associated with the}} surface of other Bacillus spores. Possible functions of the newly identified proteins are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Karstification of the Carboniferous Limestone of the {{northern}} part of the Derbyshire limestone outcrop began to a limited extent prior to deposition of the Namurian, and continued in some areas with the development of a hydrothermal karst system during the mineralisation phases of the Permo-Triassic. Extensive cavernisation by allogenic streams and by percolating meteoric water began after the final stripping of the cover of younger rocks during the late Tertiary, and the cave systems were extended and modified throughout the Pleistocene, A complex series of erosional events, apparently related to successive glacial phases, gave rise to a series of abandoned cave levels in some areas. The cavities produced during the Permo- Triassic were of importance in determining the nature and orientation of the later karst drainage systems. Where such pre-existing cavity systems failed to correspond with the hydraulic gradients of the Pleistocene, bedding controlled tube networks developed at preferred horizons in the limestone, often where a fossil horizon gave a relatively higher <b>primary</b> <b>permeability</b> and an underlying clay 'wayboard' arrested downward percolation. Interbedded impermeable horizons are important in the development of perched groundwater areas. Where such horizons have been breached they often form the upper limits of large caverns, since oxidation of sulphide minerals which they contain has locally increased the aggressiveness of circulating groundwater. The concentration of large cave systems near the margins of the present outcrop suggests that stripping of the cover during the late Tertiary occurred fast, and was completed prior to the establishment of significant hydraulic gradients within the limestone...|$|E
40|$|Precisely {{controlled}} {{movements of}} ions {{into and out}} of cells and organelles are essential for life. TRP channels are a large class of channels that are united by a common <b>primary</b> structure and <b>permeability</b> to monovalent cations and calcium ions. They open and close to regulate cation entry into the cell. TRP channels {{play a crucial role in}} all the senses that allow humans to perceive the outside world. Because of the involvement of TRP channels in many physiological processes, it might not be surprising that some of the subfamilies are involved in human diseases. In this review we want to show the current stage in drug development targeting TRP channels in pain, cancer and polycystic kidney disease (PKD). In the management of pain, TRPV 1 has become a viable drug target for clinical use. Several synthetic antagonists of the TRPV 1 channel are progressed into clinical development focused primarily for use in the treatment of pain. In cancer, TRP channels may serve as prognostic/diagnostic markers or as therapeutic target for activation of the apoptotic pathway or delivering a toxic payload. The disturbance of the interaction between TRPP 1 and TRPP 2 in PKD has led to the discovery of novel potential therapeutic targets, although the majority of the drugs successfully tested so far were not specifically designed to treat PKD. Last decade, the scientific world opened the gate of TRP channels, but many years of research is required to pass through TRP channels. ...|$|R
40|$|In low porosity, low {{permeability}} zones, natural fractures are the <b>primary</b> source of <b>permeability</b> which affect both production and injection of fluids. The open fractures do not contribute much to porosity, but they provide an increased drainage network to any porosity. They also may connect the borehole to remote zones of better reservoir characteristics. An important approach to characterizing the fracture orientation and fracture permeability of reservoir formations is {{one based on}} the effects of such conditions on the propagation of acoustic and seismic waves in the rock. The project is a study directed toward the evaluation of acoustic logging and 3 D-seismic measurement techniques as well as fluid flow and transport methods for mapping permeability anisotropy and other petrophysical parameters for the understanding of the reservoir fracture systems and associated fluid dynamics. The principal application of these measurement techniques and methods is to identify and investigate the propagation characteristics of acoustic and seismic waves in the Twin Creek hydrocarbon reservoir owned by Union Pacific Resources (UPR) and to characterize the fracture permeability distribution using production data. This site is located in the overthrust area of Utah and Wyoming. UPR drilled six horizontal wells, and presently UPR has two rigs running with many established drill hole locations. In addition, there are numerous vertical wells that exist in the area as well as 3 D seismic surveys. Each horizontal well contains full FMS logs and MWD logs, gamma logs, etc...|$|R
40|$|Understanding methane {{emissions}} in underground coal mines {{is critical for}} a safe and productive mine. In addition to reasonable estimation of initial coalbed reservoir parameters, it is also crucial that changes in effective stress due to mining and pore pressure reduction {{are taken into account}} due to their effects on porosity and <b>permeability.</b> <b>Primary</b> parameters for estimation of emissions or modeling of the mining environment for this purpose are porosity and permeability which can change dramatically as a result of stress redistribution associated with mining and gas desorption from a large coal volume. These parameters affect the emission rates and ventilation requirements, as well as water inflow into the working environment. Stopping leakage, on the other hand, is a secondary stress dependent factor in estimation of emissions, as convergence of the roof and floor strata, compromising the integrity of the stopping, may result in leakage, making prediction of ventilation requirements difficult. This paper aims {{to examine the effects of}} porosity and permeability changes of the coal seam on methane {{emissions in}} an underground continuous miner section. The models were developed and executed in a dynamic fashion to simulate an advancing section. Through this process, the changes of effective stress in coal, particularly their change paths, on porosity and permeability were incorporated into the models and methane emissions, concentrations, air requirements, water inflow and possible leakage from the stoppings were investigated using a conventional coalbed methane reservoir model...|$|R
