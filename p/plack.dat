40|$|Quantum states {{evolving}} at equidistant {{steps into}} {{a set of}} mutually orthogonal states of finite or infinite cardinality p exhibit an interesting physical effect. The analysis of the amplitudes of the state at half the step time with the elements of this set (the anticipation amplitudes) shows, that for randomly chosen states measurements of the state at half-step time reveal information about the states at full step time, anticipating future states and reflecting past states with significant probability. For fixed N and p to infinity, the probability to measure a state which is N steps apart in future or past exceeds a constant lower bound. We characterize the spectrum, establish an analog to <b>Plack's</b> relation, define a random sampling scheme, analyze the resulting distribution of the anticipation probabilities and point out applications.

40|$|A {{method to}} {{determine}} the two parameter set of circular cylinders, whose surfaces contain three given points, {{is presented in the}} context of an efficient algorithm, based on the set of two parameter projections of the points onto planar sections, to compute radius and a point where the axes intersect the plane of the given points. The geometry of the surface of points, whose position vectors represent cylinder radius, r, and axial orientation, is revealed and described in terms of symmetry and singularity inherent in the triangle with vertices on the given points. This strongly suggests that, given one constraint on the axial orientation of the cylinder, there are up to six cylinders of identical radius on the three given points. A bivariate function, in two of the three line direction <b>Placker</b> coordinates, is derived to prove this. By specifying r and an axis direction, say, perpendicular to a given direction, one obtains a sixth order univariate polynomial in one of the line coordinates which yields six axis directions. These ideas are needed in the design of parallel manipulators...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose is}} to find out whether the {{diagnostics}} and registration of patients with mesothelioma in the Littoral – Mountainous County of Croatia corresponds to the world trends. Further, the intention was to show the incidence of the disease and suggest the measures of prevention in the county of 400. 000 inhabitants and its center Rijeka with 140. 000 people. To that purpose 43 patients with mesothelioma were monitored in two groups: 25 shipyard workers, mean age 66, and 18 workers in other occupations, mean age 62. Statistically the group did not differ significantly in the incidence of <b>placks,</b> left or right side effusion. The pleural puncture showed the significance (p< 0. 05) for incidence of rouse cells. In 20 patients out of 43 mesothelioma was confirmed by taking the material for pathohistology by means of VATS (video assisted thoracoscopy) and in 14 patients by TTB (transthoracic biopsy) with CT control. Spirometric values showed moderate restrictive difficulties. Although a considerable improvement in diagnosing mesothelioma has been achieved {{in the last five years}} an improved prevention activity by occupational medicine is required not only by periodic checkups of the exposed persons and examinations for retired workers with respiratory difficulties, but also by stimulating work case histories...|$|R
40|$|The {{continuing}} miniaturization of microelectronics {{raises the}} prospect of nanometre-scale devices with mechanical and electrical properties that are qualitatively different from those at larger dimensions. The investigation of these properties, and particularly the increasing influence of quantum effects on electron transport, has therefore attracted much interest. Quantum properties of the conductance can be observed when `breaking' a metallic contact: as two metal electrodes in {{contact with each other}} are slowly retracted, the contact area undergoes structural rearrangements until it consists in its final stages of only a few bridging atoms. Just before the abrubt transition to tunneling occurs, the electrical conductance through a monovalent metal contact is always close to a value of 2 e^ 2 /h, where e is the charge on an electron and h is <b>Plack's</b> constant. This value corresponds to one quantum unit of conductance, thus indicating that the `neck' of the contact consists of a single atom. In contrast to previous observations of only single-atom necks, here we describe the breaking of atomic-scale gold contacts, which leads to the formation of gold chains one atom thick and at least four atoms long. Once we start to pull out a chain, the conductance never exceeds 2 e^ 2 /h, confirming that it acts as a one-dimensional quantized nanowire. Given their high stability and the ability to support ballistic electron transport, these structures seem well suited for the investigation of atomic-scale electronics.
