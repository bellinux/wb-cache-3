40|$|Abstract Background The {{therapeutic}} effect of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) {{may be affected}} by the metabolism of the drug in the target organ. We investigated the in vitro metabolism of beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP), budesonide (BUD), ciclesonide (CIC), and fluticasone propionate (FP) in human lung precision-cut tissue slices. CIC, a new generation ICS, is hydrolyzed by esterases in the upper and lower airways to its <b>pharmacologically</b> <b>active</b> <b>metabolite</b> desisobutyryl-ciclesonide (des-CIC). Methods Lung tissue slices were incubated with BDP, BUD, CIC, and FP (initial target concentration of 25 μM) for 2, 6, and 24 h. Cellular viability was assessed using adenosine 5 '-triphosphate content and protein synthesis in lung slices. Metabolites and remaining parent compounds in the tissue samples were analyzed by HPLC with UV detection. Results BDP was hydrolyzed to the <b>pharmacologically</b> <b>active</b> <b>metabolite</b> beclomethasone- 17 -monopropionate (BMP) and, predominantly, to inactive beclomethasone (BOH). CIC was hydrolyzed initially to des-CIC with a slower rate compared to BDP. A distinctly smaller amount (approximately 10 -fold less) of fatty acid esters were formed by BMP (and/or BOH) than by BUD or des-CIC. The highest relative amounts of fatty acid esters were detected for BUD. For FP, no metabolites were detected at any time point. The amount of drug-related material in lung tissue (based on initial concentrations) at 24 h was highest for CIC, followed by BUD and FP; the smallest amount was detected for BDP. Conclusion The in vitro metabolic pathways of the tested ICS in human lung tissue were differing. While FP was metabolically stable, the majority of BDP was converted to inactive polar metabolites. The formation of fatty acid conjugates was confirmed for BMP (and/or BOH), BUD, and des-CIC. </p...|$|E

It is concluded that morphine does not accumulate in patients with renal failure but that accumulation of metabolites does occur. The previously reported observations of morphine accumulation during renal failure probably result from the use of radioimmunoassays that cannot distinguish between morphine and morphine- 6 -glucuronide.

Upon elution, the metabolites were screened on affinity for ERα with an on-line HRS assay. With this HRS system, we were able to follow, in a time-dependent manner, the formation of ERα-binding metabolites of tamoxifen and raloxifene. By analyzing the bioaffinity chromatograms with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, structural information of the <b>pharmacologically</b> <b>active</b> <b>metabolites</b> was obtained as well. For tamoxifen, 15 active and 6 nonactive metabolites were observed, of which 5 were of primary, 10 of secondary, and 6 of an as yet unknown order of metabolism.

A comparison of metabolite profiles, microarray results and EST data {{enable us to}} predict which terpene synthases are related with the production of specific terpenoids. Analysis of EST data further suggests several genes important for the growth and development of rhizomes. Ginger and turmeric accumulate important <b>pharmacologically</b> <b>active</b> <b>metabolites</b> at high levels in their rhizomes. Comparisons of ginger and turmeric EST data to publicly available sorghum rhizome ESTs revealed a total of 777 contigs common to ginger, turmeric and sorghum rhizomes but absent from other tissues. The list of rhizome-specific contigs was enriched for genes associated with regulation of tissue growth, development, and regulation of transcription. The analysis suggests ethylene response factors, AUX/IAA proteins, and rhizome-enriched MADS box transcription factors may play important roles in defining rhizome growth and development. From ginger and turmeric, 25 mono- and 16 sesquiterpene synthase sequences were cloned and the function of 13 mono- and 11 sesquiterpene synthases were revealed. There are many paralogs in the ginger and turmeric terpene synthase family, {{some of which have}} the same or similar function. However some paralogs have diverse functions and this suggests the evolution of terpene synthases in ginger and turmeric. Importantly, α-zingiberene/β-sesquiphellandrene synthase was identified, which makes the substrates for α-turmerone and β-turmerone production in turmeric. Also P 450 candidates for α- zingiberene/β-sesquiphellandrene oxidase are proposed. Research involving analysis of metabolite profiles requires the manipulation of a large datasets, such as those produced by GC/MS. We developed an approach to identify compounds that involves deconvolution of peaks obtained using SICs as well as common peak selections between samples even though the peaks may be very small and represent unknown compounds.
