These results suggest that outsourcing voting to <b>proxy</b> advisory <b>firms</b> appears to have the unintended economic consequence that boards of directors are induced to make choices that decrease shareholder value...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} whether there is an optimal capital structure at which point firm is able to maximize its value. An advanced panel threshold regression model is applied to test the panel threshold effect of capital structure on firm value among 90 unlisted Seafood Processing Enterprises in the South Central region of Vietnam (SEASCRs) during 2005 – 2011 period. In this study, I use BVE and ROE as surrogate for firm value and debt ratio (TD/TA) as surrogate for capital structure and as the threshold variable. The empirical results strongly indicate that triple threshold effect exists between debt ratio and firm value when BVE is selected to <b>proxy</b> <b>firm</b> value. However, when ROE is selected to <b>proxy</b> <b>firm</b> value, the result shows that there exists double thresholds effect between debt ratio and firm value. From these results, I may conclude that the relationship between capital structure and firm value has a nonlinear relationship represents an convex Parapol shape. In addition, the findings suggest implications for SEASCRs on flexible usage of financial leverage. Specifically, SEASCRs should not use loans over 57. 39 %. To ensure and enhance the Firm value, the scope of the optimal debt ratio should be less than 57. 39 %. </p...|$|E

The result shows that there is a single threshold effect of debt ratio on firm value when return on equity (ROE) is used to <b>proxy</b> <b>firm</b> value. Furthermore, based on our combined findings of ROE and earnings per share (EPS) triple threshold estimations, we find that the appropriate debt ratio range for the electronic listed firms in Taiwan should not be over 51. 57 percent or below 12. 37 percent. To ensure and enhance the firm's value, the optimal range of debt ratio should be within 12. 37 percent and 28. 70 percent.

40|$|The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC or Commission) {{appears to}} be on the verge of {{requiring}} investment advisers to undergo third party examinations. One justification for the rulemaking is that the Commission lacks sufficient resources to examine advisers frequently enough. Another is to create indirectly a self-regulatory organization (SRO) for investments advisers. Both may leave a rulemaking particularly vulnerable to challenge as arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedures Act. This Article considers three novel grounds on which a rulemaking may be successfully challenged. Congress has repeatedly rejected SEC requests to provide additional funding for examinations or to create an adviser SRO. This Article speculates that the rulemaking could be successfully challenged on the grounds that it usurps Congress’s power of the purse by imposing an unauthorized tax on investment advisers, and/or Congress’s authority to authorize the creation of an adviser SRO. On firmer ground, the Article discusses the risk that Section 206 (4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, under which a third party examination rule would likely be adopted, does not authorize such broad rulemaking. Such a challenge could not only defeat the rulemaking, but also undermine the viability of other rules adopted under Section 206 (4). This Article also considers some of the numerous examples of third party examiners that could provide useful models for a third party examination rule for advisers. It surveys seven types of third party examiners in order to provide a framework for thinking about how a third party compliance rule might be designed: nationally recognized statistical rating organizations; <b>proxy</b> <b>firm</b> advisors, the CFA Institute, public company auditors, compliance consultants, chief compliance officers, and surprise and internal controls auditors. Each examiner serves a distinctly different third party examination role and their regulation is equally varied, if not always consistent...|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effects of exchange rate volatility on firm performance in Nigeria, by examining cross sectional data for the most active 20 companies listed on the Nigerian Stock Exchange. The study developed three dynamic panel models that account for heterogeneities among the companies and it extended recent research by allowing international investors and corporations to base their investment decisions on the exchange rate volatilities between the Nigerian Naira and their home country currencies. The method {{used in the study}} is the dynamic panel data approach applying the Arrelano-Bond dynamic panel-data and Arellano-Bover generalized method of moments (GMM) estimators. The variables used in the study to <b>proxy</b> <b>firm</b> performance are the rate of return on assets (RRA), asset turnover ratio (ATR), and portfolio activity & resilience (PAR) variable. While RRA variable is obtained by simply dividing the firm’s profits by the total assets of the business, ATR variable and the PAR variables are obtained by dividing the firm’s sales revenue by the assets employed in the business and by dividing the percentage change in sales by the percentage change in gross domestic product GDP. The exchange rate volatility variable is simply obtained by taking the square of the mean adjusted relative change in the official exchange rate. The result of the paned data estimate shows that there is {{no significant difference between the}} Arrelano-Bond dynamic panel approach and Arellano-Bover generalized method of moments (GMM) estimators. The result of the three estimates revealed that exchange rate volatility has significant negative impacts on the rate of return on assets, asset turn ratio and the portfolio activity & resilience, thus, establishing that there exist a significant negative impact of exchange rate volatility on firm performance in Nigeria between 2004 and 2013. Overall, the study suggests that the higher the exchange rate volatility in an economy the less efficient will firms operating in the economy and by implication the lower will be firms’ operating performance...|$|E

40|$|A {{conventional}} wisdom {{in the contemporary}} corporate finance literature argues that {{small and medium-sized enterprises}} (SMEs) are informationally opaque. We use data from two credit information companies and in particular their disagreements over the creditworthiness of SMEs to study the empirical relevance of this often invoked assumption. Our panel data analysis shows that once unobserved firm-effects are controlled for, the disagreements (i. e., rating splits) are inversely related to the age of firms. We are not able to document such a robust relationship between the disagreements and the size of firms. This finding holds a lesson for empirical corporate finance researchers who need firm-level proxies for informational imperfections and asymmetries: of the two often-used <b>proxies,</b> <b>firm</b> size is not as closely related to informational opacity as firm age is. ...|$|R
