40|$|The spacer <b>promoter</b> {{of the rat}} rDNA repeat {{consists}} of two functional domains: a core (proximal) element that is sufficient for transcription in vitro, and an upstream (distal) <b>promoter</b> element that increases the efficiency of transcription. Two of the transcription factors that interact with the 45 S <b>promoter</b> also interact with the spacer <b>promoter.</b> Rat SL- 1, is required for transcription of the spacer <b>promoter</b> by heterologous extracts, e. g. human, and rat SF- 1 is required for efficient transcription in vitro. Order-of-addition experiments demonstrated that the preinitiation complex formed by these factors on the spacer <b>promoter</b> is not as stable as the complex formed on the 45 S <b>promoter.</b> DNase 1 footprinting experiments demonstrated binding sites for rat SL- 1 and SF- 1 on the distal element of the spacer <b>promoter.</b> The topology of the domains of the spacer <b>promoter</b> may explain both the reduced stability of the preinitiation complex formed on that <b>promoter</b> and the lower efficiency of transcription of that <b>promoter</b> {{when compared to the}} 45 S <b>promoter...</b>|$|R

5|$|In Escherichia coli, SOS {{boxes are}} 20-nucleotide long {{sequences}} near <b>promoters</b> with palindromic structure {{and a high}} degree of sequence conservation. In other classes and phyla, the sequence of SOS boxes varies considerably, with different length and composition, but it is always highly conserved and one of the strongest short signals in the genome. The high information content of SOS boxes permits differential binding of LexA to different <b>promoters</b> and allows for timing of the SOS response. The lesion repair genes are induced at the beginning of SOS response. The error-prone translesion polymerases, for example, UmuCD'2 (also called DNA polymerase V), are induced later on as a last resort. Once the DNA damage is repaired or bypassed using polymerases or through recombination, the amount of single-stranded DNA in cells is decreased, lowering the amounts of RecA filaments decreases cleavage activity of LexA homodimer, which then binds to the SOS boxes near <b>promoters</b> and restores normal gene expression.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe direct {{negative}} impact of the transcriptional activity of one component on the second one in cis {{is referred to as}} transcriptional interference (TI). U 6 is a type III RNA polymerase III <b>promoter</b> commonly used for driving small hairpin RNA (shRNA) expression in vector-based RNAi. In the design and construction of viral vectors, multiple transcription units may be arranged in close proximity in a space-limited vector. Determining if U 6 <b>promoter</b> activity can be affected by TI is critical for the expression of target shRNA in gene therapy or loss-of-function studies. In this research, we designed and implemented a modified retroviral system where shRNA and exogenous gene expressions were driven by two independent transcriptional units. We arranged U 6 <b>promoter</b> driving shRNA expression and UbiC <b>promoter</b> in two <b>promoter</b> arrangements. In primary macrophages, we found U 6 <b>promoter</b> activity was inhibited by UbiC <b>promoter</b> when in the divergent arrangement but not in tandem.

40|$|Transcription of the Escherichia coli melAB operon is {{regulated}} by the MelR protein, an AraC family member whose activity is modulated by the binding of melibiose. In the absence of melibiose, MelR is unable to activate the melAB <b>promoter</b> but autoregulates its own expression by repressing the melR <b>promoter.</b> Melibiose triggers MelR-dependent activation of the melAB <b>promoter</b> and relieves MelR-dependent repression of the melR <b>promoter.</b> Twenty-nine single amino acid substitutions in MelR that result in partial melibiose-independent activation of the melAB <b>promoter</b> have been identified.
