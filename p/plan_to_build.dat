5|$|Proposals for a tram network {{were made}} in the 1990s, and a <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> a line along Princes Street and Leith Walk to Newhaven was {{proposed}} in 1999 by the City of Edinburgh Council, Lothian and Edinburgh Enterprise and the New Edinburgh Tramways Company.|$|E
5|$|In the 1880s, Esteban Martínez, {{the parish}} priest of the ruined church, {{approached}} Spanish architect Genaro Palacios with a <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> {{a fire and}} earthquake-resistant structure made entirely of steel. Palacios completed a design that fused Earthquake Baroque with the Neo-Gothic style. His final design {{was said to have}} been inspired by the famed Gothic Burgos Cathedral in Burgos, Spain.|$|E

5|$|After its {{announcement}} in 1995, the project stalled because P Associates {{was unable to}} find investors to finance the project. Investors were skeptical that luxury residential apartments outside the Rittenhouse Square neighborhood in Center City could be successful. The delay allowed another developer to announce an agreement to acquire the property. In March 1999, Chicago-based developer the Barton Group announced its <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> a 37-story, 322-unit luxury residential tower. The Barton Group's plan would also incorporate the PSFS headquarters building and York Row into the tower.|$|E
5|$|For the {{remainder}} of his career Braham flew around the World. But, in 1968, Canadian policy pointed to the amalgamation of all the Canadian armed forces into one unified service. Worse still, the cancellation of the Avro Canada CF-105 Arrow put an end to Canada's <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> their own fighters which curbed Braham's ambitions as a test pilot. He resigned from the RCAF in January 1968 and settled in Nova Scotia with his wife and three sons. He had flown 5,370 hours in 66 types of aircraft with the RCAF.|$|E
5|$|Gerard Kitchen O'Neill (February 6, 1927 – April 27, 1992) was an American {{physicist}} and space activist. As {{a faculty member}} of Princeton University, he invented a device called the particle storage ring for high-energy physics experiments. Later, he invented a magnetic launcher called the mass driver. In the 1970s, he developed a <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> human settlements in outer space, including a space habitat design known as the O'Neill cylinder. He founded the Space Studies Institute, an organization devoted to funding research into space manufacturing and colonization.|$|E

In addition, the Port of Ashdod is undergoing a massive expansion program.|$|E
5|$|Paul Thiry was the fair's chief architect; he also {{designed}} the Coliseum building. Among the other {{architects of the}} fair, Seattle-born Minoru Yamasaki received {{one of his first}} major commissions to build the United States Science Pavilion. Yamasaki would later design New York's World Trade Center. Victor Steinbrueck and John Graham, Jr. designed the Space Needle. Hideki Shimizu and Kazuyuki Matsushita designed the original International Fountain. Despite the <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> a permanent civic center, more than half the structures built for the fair were torn down more or less immediately after it ended.|$|E

5|$|After the German {{invasion}} of Poland in September 1939 {{and the ensuing}} outbreak of the Second World War, the Netherlands hoped to remain neutral, as they had done during the First World War 25 years earlier. To ensure this neutrality, the Dutch army was mobilised from 24 August and entrenched. Large sums (almost 900 million guilders) were spent on defence. It proved very difficult to obtain new matériel in wartime, however, especially as the Dutch had ordered some of their new equipment from Germany, which deliberately delayed deliveries. Moreover, a considerable part of the funds were intended for the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia), much of it related to a <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> three battlecruisers.|$|E
5|$|Despite these precautions, {{pollution}} {{from the power}} stations was still a factor. In 1954, consideration was given to scrapping the <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> the Union Hall housing estate in Lemington because of probable {{pollution from}} nearby power stations. This was mainly {{because some of the}} houses were as high as, if not higher than, the power stations' chimneys. At times, this meant the estate being exposed to as much as 1.25 parts per million of sulphur dioxide. However the estate was still built, as these peak conditions were thought unlikely to occur on more than 18 days in a year.|$|E
5|$|During Brown's {{tenure in}} the New York State Senate his Democratic Party {{was in the}} minority. He {{was part of the}} {{majority}} that backed New York Governor George Pataki's 2001 <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> up to three Western New York casinos on Seneca Indian land. The legislation was controversial because it granted slot machine rights to casino operators {{for the first time in}} New York State. Both of the previous casinos used video gambling machines with debit cards. Brown supported the casinos as a way to support the local economy. When the casino was completed in 2003, he was on the seven-member commission that was to apportion the state's agreed 18% share of the slot machine revenue, amounting to approximately $40million.|$|E

5|$|In 1950 the Dade County Planning Board {{announced}} a <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> a highway connecting Key Biscayne with the Overseas Highway on Key Largo. The project envisioned bridges connecting artificial islands, {{to be built}} on the Safety Valve and existing small keys to Elliott Key and on to Key Largo. Áleman was expected to donate the right-of-way for a road running {{down the middle of}} the island to the first bridge at Cape Florida. With the prospect of a major highway passing through his property, Áleman rushed to prepare it for development: he had it completely cleared, leveled and filled in. A seawall was constructed along the western (Biscayne Bay) side of the Cape Florida property.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, {{as part of}} a state-brokered deal, LILCO's power {{generation}} facilities, including the Glenwood plant, were absorbed into KeySpan Energy, with the public Long Island Power Authority (LIPA) taking over transmission and delivery functions. In 2001, LIPA proposed building two mini-turbines at Glenwood Landing {{as part of a}} <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> ten such plants across Long Island to avoid the risk of rolling blackouts in the face of increased demand like those experienced in California the previous year. The pair of turbines produced 79 MW, just under an 80 MW threshold that would have triggered a full regulatory and environmental review. The new turbines were completed by May 2002, and were the first of the ten to enter operation.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, a {{regional}} transit authority (RTA) {{was formed to}} plan and construct a light rail system for the Seattle area. After an unsuccessful attempt in 1995, regional voters passed a $3.9 billion <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> light rail under the RTA in 1996. The downtown transit tunnel had already been planned for eventual light rail use and was built with tracks that would {{be incorporated into the}} initial system. The RTA, later renamed Sound Transit, approved the tunnel as part of the route of its initial light rail line in 1999. Ownership of the tunnel, including its stations, was transferred to Sound Transit in 2000 but returned two years later to King County Metro under a joint-operations agreement.|$|E

5|$|On 24 January 1959, Churchill College, Cambridge, was {{formally}} recognised by the University. Two days later, the Trustees announced that Cockcroft would be its first Master. Although {{it would also}} teach the humanities and social sciences, 70 per cent {{of the student body}} would study science and technology related subjects. Cockcroft nominated the first fellows, and he oversaw the initial construction. Controversy arose over the chapel. A 1961 <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> it {{at the entrance to the}} college, as was traditional at Cambridge, led to the immediate resignation of Francis Crick, a staunch atheist, as a fellow. The first undergraduates arrived in 1961, and the college, still incomplete, {{was formally}} opened by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, on 5 June 1964.|$|E
5|$|Over the years, several {{accidents}} {{have occurred}} on the bridge resulting in traffic congestion, and sometimes closure of the bridge for a few hours. To relieve the heavy traffic congestion at the entry to the bridge, the Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners (HRBC) <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> two one-way-exit and entry–ramps. These are planned with a semi-circular layout {{in the form of}} side wings, which will facilitate easy flow of traffic, before the toll plaza, on roads leading to the Howrah railway station. There are also plans to improve the lighting on the bridge by installing LED lamps and search lights covering the four pylons, the bridge spans, cables and under-deck. An electronic toll collection system was scheduled to be introduced by 2014, to help improve the flow of traffic across the bridge.|$|E
5|$|The first {{healthcare}} structure, the Santa Casa da Misericórdia da Póvoa de Varzim (Holy House of Mercy), {{opened in}} 1756.
