Laser <b>peening</b> provide significant fatigue life extension through shock wave mechanics which plastically deform the surface of the metal component changing the material properties.

40|$|Spontaneous reinnervation after diaphragmatic {{paralysis}} due to trauma, surgery, tumors {{and spinal}} cord injuries is frequently observed. A possible explanation could be collateral reinnervation, since the diaphragm is commonly double-innervated by the (accessory) phrenic nerve. Permutation entropy (<b>PeEn),</b> a complexity measure for time series, may reflect a functional state of neuromuscular transmission by quantifying the complexity of interactions across neural and muscular networks. In an established rat model, electromyographic signals of the diaphragm after phrenicotomy were analyzed using <b>PeEn</b> quantifying denervation and reinnervation. Thirty-three anesthetized rats were unilaterally phrenicotomized. After 1, 3, 9, 27 and 81 days, diaphragmatic electromyographic <b>PeEn</b> was analyzed in vivo from sternal, mid-costal and crural areas of both hemidiaphragms. After euthanasia of the animals, both hemidiaphragms were dissected for fiber type evaluation. The electromyographic incidence of an accessory phrenic nerve was 76 %. At day 1 after phrenicotomy, <b>PeEn</b> (normalized values) was significantly diminished in the sternal (median: 0. 69; interquartile range: 0. 66 - 0. 75) and mid-costal area (0. 68; 0. 66 - 0. 72) compared to the non-denervated side (0. 84; 0. 78 - 0. 90) at threshold p< 0. 05. In the crural area, innervated by the accessory phrenic nerve, <b>PeEn</b> remained unchanged (0. 79; 0. 72 - 0. 86).
