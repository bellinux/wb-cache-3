40|$|Cyber-physical {{systems such}} as {{autonomous}} spacecraft, power plants and automotive systems become more vulnerable to unanticipated failures as their complexity increases. Accurate tracking of system dynamics and fault diagnosis are essential. This paper presents an efficient state estimation method for dynamic systems modeled as concurrent probabilistic automata. First, the Labeled Uncertainty Graph (LUG) method in the planning domain is introduced to describe the state tracking and fault diagnosis processes. Because the system model is probabilistic, the Monte Carlo technique is employed to sample the probability distribution of belief states. In addition, to address the sample impoverishment problem, an innovative look-ahead technique is proposed to recursively generate most likely belief states without exhaustively checking all possible successor modes. The overall algorithms incorporate two major steps: a roll-forward process that estimates system state and identifies faults, and a roll-backward process that analyzes possible system trajectories once the faults have been detected. We demonstrate {{the effectiveness of this}} approach by applying it to a real world domain: the <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> of a spacecraft...|$|E

As compared to segregated standby redundancy and whole system standby redundancy, such method provides preservation of all unit functions {{in case of}} redundancy and gives the possibility for continuous monitoring of major and redundant elements. Example of that unit is given. Electric motor drive control channel block diagram contains two <b>control</b> <b>units</b> – the major and redundant; it also contains four <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> <b>units.</b> <b>Control</b> <b>units</b> programming was carried out using automata-based approach.

The RF <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> system of the МСС- 30 / 15 cyclotron is intended to excite the resonance system, which consists of two resonators galvanically coupled near the magnet axis. When designing the cyclotron, the operating frequency of the RF oscillations of the resonance system was chosen to be 40. 68 MHz {{in compliance with the}} “All-Union norms for the allowed radio noise, 5 - 89 ”. At the chosen frequency the resonance system is completely located inside the inner cavity of the vacuum chamber and is fixed to the side surface of its casing.

40|$|On {{the basis}} of {{previous}} concepts, analyses and experiments, the high flux test module (HFTM) for the International Fusion Materials Irradiation Facility (IFMIF) was further optimised. The work focused on the design and the thermal hydraulic analysis of the HFTM section containing the material specimens to be irradiated, the ''test section'', with the main objective to improve the concept {{with respect to the}} optimum use of the available irradiation volume and to the temperature of the specimens. Particular emphasis was laid on the application of design principles which assure stable and reproducible thermal conditions. The present work has confirmed the feasibility and suitability of the optimised design of the HFTM test section with chocolate plate like shaped rigs. In particular {{it has been shown that}} the envisaged irradiation temperatures can be reached with acceptable temperature differences inside the specimen stack. The latter can be achieved only by additional electrical heating of the axial ends of the capsules. Division of the heater in three sections with separate <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> and <b>control</b> <b>units</b> is necessary. Maintaining of the temperatures during beam-off periods likewise requires electrical heating. The required electrical heaters - mineral isolated wires - are commercially available. The potential of the CFD code STAR-CD for the thermal hydraulic analysis of complex systems like the HFTM was confirmed. Nevertheless, experimental confirmation is desirable. Suitable experiments are under preparation. To verify the assumptions made on the thermal conductivity of the contact faces and layers between the two shells of the rig, dedicated experiments are suggested. The present work must be complemented by a thermal mechanical analysis of the module. Most critical component in this respect seems to be the rig wall. Furthermore, it will be necessary to investigate the response of the HFTM to power transients, and to determine the requirements on the electrical heating control system. (orig.)

40|$|The {{high costs}} of {{connecting}} isolated bus stop shelters to the public electricity grid have meant {{that most of them}} are unlit. However, in these areas remote from the grid, where {{there is little or no}} other form of lighting, illumination of the bus stop shelter would be a particularly valuable improvement for the public transport user. The timetables can be read and the person waiting usually feels safer in an illuminated shelter. Nowadays, photovoltaics presents an economic alternative to supply energy to these remote locations. The disadvantage of this decentralised <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> is the <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> needed in each shelter to control the lighting. If the conventional timer technology is used, the configuration of this <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> according to the insolation conditions and the consumer requirements, is very complicated and unsatisfactory.

40|$|Textiles are {{ubiquitous}} to us, enveloping {{our skin}} and surroundings. Not {{only do they}} provide a protective shield or act as a comforting cocoon but they also serve esthetic appeal and cultural importance. Recent technologies have allowed the traditional functionality of textiles to be extended. Advances in materials science have added intelligence to textiles and created ‘smart’ clothes. Smart textiles can sense and react to environmental conditions or stimuli, e. g., from mechanical, thermal, chemical, electrical, or magnetic sources (Lam Po Tang and Stylios 2006). Such textiles find uses in many applications ranging from military and security to personalized healthcare, hygiene, and entertainment. Smart textiles may be termed ‘‘passive’’ or ‘‘active. ’’ A passive smart textile monitors the wearer’s physiology or the environment, e. g., a shirt with in-built thermistors to log body temperature over time. If actuators are integrated, the textile becomes an active, smart textile as it may respond to a particular stimulus, e. g., the temperature-aware shirt may automatically roll up the sleeves when body temperature rises. The fundamental components in any smart textile are sensors and actuators. Interconnections, <b>power</b> <b>supply,</b> and a <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> are also needed to complete the system. All these components must be integrated into textiles while still retaining the usual tactile, flexible, and comfortable properties that we expect from a textile.

40|$|As NASA {{works to}} develop an {{effective}} integrated portable life support system design for exploration Extravehicular activity (EVA), alternatives to the current system s electrical power and control architecture are needed to support new requirements for flexibility, maintainability, reliability, and reduced mass and volume. Experience with the current Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) has demonstrated that the current architecture, based in a central <b>power</b> <b>supply,</b> monitoring and <b>control</b> <b>unit,</b> with dedicated analog wiring harness connections to active components in the system has {{a significant impact on}} system packaging and seriously constrains design flexibility in adapting to component obsolescence and changing system needs over time. An alternative architecture based in the use of a digital data bus offers possible wiring harness and system power savings, but risks significant penalties in component complexity and cost. A hybrid architecture that relies on a set of electronic and power interface nodes serving functional models within the Portable Life Support System (PLSS) is proposed to minimize both packaging and component level penalties. A common interface node hardware design can further reduce penalties by reducing the nonrecurring development costs, making miniaturization more practical, maximizing opportunities for maturation and reliability growth, providing enhanced fault tolerance, and providing stable design interfaces for system components and a central control. Adaptation to varying specific module requirements can be achieved with modest changes in firmware code within the module. A preliminary design effort has developed a common set of hardware interface requirements and functional capabilities for such a node based on anticipated modules comprising an exploration PLSS, and a prototype node has been designed assembled, programmed, and tested. One instance of such a node has been adapted to support testing the swingbed carbon dioxide and humidity control element in NASA s advanced PLSS 2. 0 test article.

40|$|Since mid- 80 ‟s {{cathodic}} protection (CP) has been recognised as the „‟only technique known to stop corrosion {{regardless of the}} levels of chloride contamination in concrete‟‟ (FHWA, 1982) and is {{proved to be the}} most cost effective means to extend the useful life of the structure. Cathodic protection is an electrochemical technique to stop/mitigate corrosion by supplying „current‟ from an external source in order to suppress the „internally generated‟ current flow due to corrosion processes. The „external‟ current source could be obtained simply by coupling the steel to another electrochemically more active metal, e. g. zinc; alternatively the „external‟ current may be derived from a mains operated low voltage DC power source, viz. transformer/rectifier unit. These two different approaches to supply „external‟ current to stop corrosion are generically termed as: „Sacrificial Anode Cathodic Protection (SACP) ‟ system and „Impressed Current Cathodic Protection (ICCP) ‟ system, respectively. Both approaches have proved to be feasible, but the impressed current CP system offers greater flexibility with regard to its ability to provide the necessary current in situations where concrete resistivity is relatively high and variable. The sacrificial anode system is most effective if the concrete resistivity is very low or the anode is placed in a very low resistivity environment such as soil with low resistivity, as the inherent driving voltage is low e. g. the potential difference between zinc and corroding steel in concrete is limited to approximately 0. 7 volts. Other contra-distinction between the two approaches are that the design life of the sacrificial anode systems are usually range between 10 - 15 years; on the other hand the design life of the ICCP systems could be well in excess of 60 + years (depending on the type of anode system). Page 2 Following the successful application of first CP system, based on impressed current CP (ICCP), on a bridge deck in California, USA 1973, the technology has advanced significantly, particularly the anode systems (which is the main arbiter of a CP system) to deliver the protection current efficiently providing adequate protection (i. e. meeting the criteria recommended in BS EN ISO 12696 : 2012 and other International Standards). Most of the CP installations worldwide are operating in ICCP mode. However, due to the escalating cost of anode systems and associated external <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> as well as monitoring/control units for ICCP installation has led researchers to actively pursue different means of developing low cost anode systems. Researchers have mainly focused on sacrificial anode CP (SACP) systems, as SACP does not require an external <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> and <b>control</b> <b>units,</b> but the drawback to this anode system is that it has a shorter life span (usually 10 - 15 years compared to 60 + years for ICCP anodes). This work describes the development of an ICCP anode system design utilising commercially available zinc rich paint (ZRP) as a primary anode material offering an innovative but considerably low cost alternative to currently used materials for ICCP anode systems. It also describes the development of a simple and low cost „multifunctional‟ probe for monitoring the performance of the installed CP system, among other functions, such as LPR measurements, macrocell corrosion current measurement, E-log I tests for assessing the current requirements for CP design. For these functions both laboratory investigations and field trial on real life structure were employe...|$|R

Communication between the <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> interface and the VME control card is through a pair of fibers that also provides electrical isolation. This paper describes the <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> <b>control</b> system and it's impact on the SNS...|$|R
