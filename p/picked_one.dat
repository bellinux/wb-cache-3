25|$|Bob Markham (Mark Harmon) - A logger, widower, {{and single}} father to his {{daughter}} Abby. After his wife died, he sunk everything he had into logging. However, {{the way he was}} logging tore up so much soil, that a long dormant plague was released and threatened to kill his men, and daughter. With help from Tarzan and Terk, Markham gathered {{all but one of the}} ingredients for the cure. The last one was a flower that was only found in one part of the jungle, until Markham's men bulldozed over them while logging. By some luck, Abby had <b>picked</b> <b>one</b> of them before, and Jane showed her how to press it, thus preserving it. After Abby and Markham's men were cured, they ceased logging and started to plant the seeds saved from the flower.|$|E

25|$|Pholus {{was curious}} why the arrows caused so much death, and <b>picked</b> <b>one</b> up but dropped it, and the arrow stabbed his foot, {{poisoning}} him. One version states that a stray arrow hit Chiron as well, but Chiron was immortal, although he still felt the pain. Chiron's pain was so great, he volunteered {{to give up}} his immortality, and take the place of Prometheus, who had been chained in {{to the top of a}} mountain to have his liver eaten daily by an eagle, although he was an immortal Titan. Prometheus' torturer, the eagle, continued its torture on Chiron, so Heracles shot it dead with an arrow. It is generally accepted that the tale was meant to show Heracles as being the recipient of Chiron's surrendered immortality. However, this tale contradicts the fact that Chiron later taught Achilles. The tale of the Centaurs sometimes appears in other parts of the twelve labours, as does the freeing of Prometheus.|$|E
25|$|After {{winning the}} ODI {{series in the}} West Indies 2–1, where Yuvraj managed scores of 1 and 10, the Indian team toured England in June for the NatWest {{triangular}} series and a four-match Test series against the hosts. The NatWest Series featured teams from England and Sri Lanka, apart from India. In the first match at Lord's, Yuvraj won {{the man of the}} match for his all-round performance (3/39 and 64*) as India successfully chased down England's total of 271. In the next match against Sri Lanka, he scored 31 and shared a crucial 60-run sixth-wicket partnership with Mohammad Kaif to set up another successful run-chase. India's next match against England was washed out due to rain after Yuvraj had scored an unbeaten 40 off 19 balls to take India to 285/4 in their 50 overs. Yuvraj's knock of 37, along with a fifty from Rahul Dravid, helped India recover from 59/4 to reach the target of 188 against Sri Lanka. This win eliminated Sri Lanka from the series with another round of matches still to be played. Yuvraj had scores of 5 and 8 in the final round of matches but proved to be useful with the ball as he <b>picked</b> <b>one</b> wicket in each of the two games. At the end of the round-robin matches, India topped the points table with 19 points while England finished second with 15 points.|$|E

The Tennessean said: [...] Neely singled, as did Kuhn; Neil fanned, but Thomas got his third straight hit and both tallied.

500|$|While Nelson was {{apparently}} convinced that Bundy's concern was genuine, most biographers, researchers, and other observers {{have concluded that}} his sudden condemnation of pornography was one last manipulative attempt to shift blame by catering to Dobson's agenda as a longtime pornography critic. He told Dobson that [...] "true crime" [...] detective magazines had [...] "corrupted" [...] him and [...] "fueled [...] fantasies ... {{to the point of}} becoming a serial killer"; yet in a 1977 letter to Ann Rule, he wrote, [...] "Who in the world reads these publications? ... I have never purchased such a magazine, and [...] two or three occasions have I ever <b>picked</b> <b>one</b> up." [...] He told Michaud and Aynsworth in 1980, and Hagmaier the night before he spoke to Dobson, that pornography played a negligible role in his development as a serial killer. [...] "The problem wasn't pornography", wrote Dekle. [...] "The problem was Bundy." [...] "I wish I could believe that his motives were altruistic," [...] wrote Rule. [...] "But all I can see in that Dobson tape is another Ted Bundy manipulation of our minds. The effect of the tape is to place, once again, the onus of his crimes, not on himself, but on us." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{the first}} Finals Week, no contestants were {{eliminated}} due to disrupted telephone and mobile phone services {{in many areas}} of Luzon, caused by Typhoon Xangsane. In the results show, finalists still went through a familiar elimination routine. [...] Agoncillo called three contestants to an area dubbed the [...] "Hot Spot" [...] before revealing that no one would be eliminated and the votes would be carried over to the succeeding week. This was done because there were no official results to be announced. [...] According to sources from the network, the votes were not yet counted at the time. [...] ABC-5 Director for Creative and Entertainment Production Perci Intalan stated that the three finalists who were put in the [...] "Hot Spot" [...] (Marcelo, Armarie Cruz and Jelli Mateo) were not necessarily the Bottom Three. Intalan said, [...] "We were not allowed to announce who the Bottom Three were because the votes will be carried over next week and it might affect the voting if people knew who the Bottom Three were." [...] As a result, two contenders—Stef Lazaro and Drae Ybañez—were eliminated the following week. [...] Another non-elimination occurred on the fourth Finals Week due to reports of disrupted voting (among Sun Cellular and Smart subscribers). The votes amassed for this week were carried over to Week 5. Through the rest of the results night, each of the judges <b>picked</b> <b>one</b> finalist to give an encore performance: Cornejo picked Cruz, Corrales chose Marcelo, and Cayabyab picked Magdangal.|$|E

[...] The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, which represents 11,000 Air Canada employees, contended that the spinoff of Aveos by Air Canada into a stand-alone entity in 2007 was illegal; union leaders also feared that Air Canada would send its heavy maintenance to low-wage countries or non-union shops after 2013, when its contract with Aveos expires.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{negative}} review, AllMusic's Tim Sendra said the track felt [...] "forced and overdone", adding, [...] "She aims for {{several kinds of}} maturity here, {{but in the process}} the music suffers". A Rap-Up editor wrote that Gomez [...] "is all grown up and not afraid to show it". Mikael Wood of the Los Angeles Times wrote that the track's hip hop elements recalled Miley Cyrus' [...] "We Can't Stop" [...] (2013), and said: [...] "No one needs reminding of how well that worked to rebrand the former Hannah Montana. Bring on the wrecking ball". Digital Spy's Lewis Corner and Amy Davidson noticed that [...] "'Good for You' allows Selena to delve deeper than she has been allowed to before, but we wouldn't want her to ditch the polished pop gems altogether". Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine said that the song's approach to more serious subject matter embodied [...] "a newfound sophistication". Rob Markman of MTV News commended Gomez for [...] "thinking outside of the box" [...] for the song and specifically her collaboration with Rocky: [...] "There are plenty of rappers Selena could've chosen from, we're just happy she <b>picked</b> <b>one</b> who can actually spit", while Emmanuel C.M. of XXL, who praised Rocky's [...] "solid" [...] verse, said that him collaborating with Gomez was a smart decision, noting the track's [...] "lush" [...] production as [...] "right up [...] alley". VH1's Alexa Tietjen said the track's hook lacked the catchiness of Gomez's previous singles [...] "Come & Get It" [...] (2013) and [...] "The Heart Wants What It Wants" [...] (2014), but described the song as [...] "well-crafted" [...] and its melody equally as [...] "surprising" [...] as Gomez's collaboration with Rocky. Harley Brown of Spin wrote, [...] "Slowness and simplicity work well for Gomez here, leaving room for Rocky's verse to feel like a natural inclusion". Wass found Rocky's rap [...] "a little forced", but [...] "tasteful (by his standards)", while New York Dee Lockett considered it [...] "lazy".|$|E
