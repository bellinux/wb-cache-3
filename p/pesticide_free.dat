They believed that when “land was held narrowly, freedom withers,” and they were critical of the system of large growers profiting off bargain priced water provided by the government while small family farms and co-ops struggled to get the water they needed. The National Land for People advocated water reclamation and the enforcement of The Reclamation Act of 1902 and <b>pesticide</b> <b>free</b> farming. According to The Reclamation Act of 1902, farmers may not obtain more than 160 acres of federally subsidized water. Their leader created a 23-minute film titled The Richest Land that juxtaposed small farmers and corporate farmers, and Jessie Lopez De La Cruz and Delores Huerta both made cameos. On July 17, 1974 Lopez-De La Cruz found herself again on the political stage, speaking to the US Senate before the Select Committee on Small Business; she shared her life story and asked for the Senators to come to Fresno to listen to the needs of poor farm workers. Again in 1976, the National Land for People made its way to Washington to challenge congressional leaders to enforce water rights laws.|$|E

Deltamethrin at concentrations between 10 μM and 40 μM evoked [Ca 2 +]i rises in a concentration-dependent manner. The Ca 2 + entry was inhibited by nifedipine, econazole, phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate, and SKF 96365. Treatment with the endoplasmic reticulum Ca 2 + pump inhibitor 2, 5 -di-tert-butylhydroquinone (BHQ) in a Ca 2 +-free medium abolished deltamethrin-induced [Ca 2 +]i rise. Treatment with deltamethrin also abolished BHQ-induced [Ca 2 +]i rise. Inhibition of phospholipase C (PLC) activity with U 73122 abolished deltamethrin-evoked [Ca 2 +]i rise. Deltamethrin killed cells at 30 – 60 μM in a concentration-dependent manner. The cytotoxic effect of deltamethrin was not reversed by prechelating cytosolic Ca 2 + with the acetoxymethyl ester of 1, 2 -bis(2 -aminophenoxy) ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid. Annexin V/propidium iodide staining data suggest that 30 – 50 μM deltamethrin induced apoptosis.

40|$|Certification - just {{obey the}} rules! Cue: For some crops, buyers are only really {{interested}} in organic produce. For example medicinal herbs. Nobody wants to make medicines from herbs that might be contaminated with pesticides or chemical fertilizers. So medicinal herb growers {{must be able to}} prove that their crops are pure, and the best way is to get organic certification. But how easy is it to become a certified organic farmer? Many small farmers may be discouraged by fears of the high costs and complex rules they would need to follow. Maggy Frayne disagrees. As a grower of medicinal herbs in South Africa, she has had to obtain certification for her land and her processing system. But, as she told Lesibana Mantshiu, getting certification was not impossibly difficult, and there are ways of reducing the cost. IN:		?We have a 40 hectare farm ? OUT:		? cut the costs down. ? DUR?N	 2 ? 35 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Maggy Frayne with some advice for farmers who are thinking about organic certification. Transcript Frayne	We have a 40 hectare farm, which is in an irrigation system north of Brits. This farm was basically a wrecked farm, because it had been used for tobacco farming, where they use a lot of chemicals. We wanted to grow medicinal herbs and {{in order to do that}} successfully the herbs have to be grown organically, <b>free</b> of <b>pesticides,</b> <b>free</b> of herbicides, free of chemicals. So we set about, for three years, converting the land and getting rid of the chemical residues that were in the soil. We planted things like sunnhemp and cowpea, crops that would feed the soil, and eventually our soil was satisfactorily tested to be free of any chemicals. Mantshiu	Now Maggy, describe how you get organic certification. Frayne	In this country there are five different companies that can certify any farmer or organisation as organic. They all prescribe to the regulations which have been set by IFOAM, which is the International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements. If you want to be organically certified, you have to get a copy of the standards, and you have to work within those rules. The standards for organic certification are very clear to understand. You may only do certain things. You may not put certain things into your soil, and if you just live within those rules it is very easy to be organic. Mantshiu	Now lastly Maggy, what benefits has this process brought you? Frayne	In the field that we farm in, in medicinal herbs, our customers ask that our herbs are certified organic, because it is a guarantee of their purity. I know, because I was selling herbs before I was certified organic, that it was easier to sell them afterwards, when they were certified organic. But you must remember that certification is expensive, it can cost 5000 Rand, and it is an annual fee. You have to be inspected, and so you have got to allow for that money. But that is not the end of the world, because the certification bodies will allow groups of farmers to come together and be certified with one number, and that will cut the costs down. End of track.

Over 15 kinds of vegetable were grown under different farming systems in Mae Rim District, Chiang Mai Province. Kinds of vegetable grown depended on market demand and growing time. In this district alone, vegetable production accounted for 0. 57 million USD in 2007, of which 0. 08 million USD was from organic vegetables.

The credence nature of these quality attributes necessitates some form of quality assurance for accurate signalling to consumers. This thesis examines the appropriate role for private, third party, and government actors in credible quality assurance systems for production-derived attributes. Concurrently, it explores the nature of trust that Canadians put in various organizations for quality assurance. In a nationwide survey, Canadian consumers obtained significant benefits from government verification of <b>pesticide</b> <b>free</b> and environmentally sustainable grains contained in pre-packaged sliced bread. The data was collected using a discrete choice experiment. Farmers, third party, and government organizations were similarly trusted for accurate information about farming methods. The dimensions of this trust varied across organizations. Government standards relating to environmental sustainability were perceived as most effective. Results obtained using a latent class multinomial logit model showed that respondents who most valued production-derived food quality also received the greatest benefit from government verification and significant negative utility from supermarket or third party verification. In relative terms, the difference in utility between third party and government verification represents 141 % {{of the value of}} the environmentally sustainable attribute and 87 % of the <b>pesticide</b> <b>free</b> attribute.

To this end, we examined translocation of Nrf 2 and production of free radicals in rat brain exposed to DM. Indeed, DM initiated nuclear translocation of Nrf 2 in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, Nrf 2 translocation was accompanied by the expression of heme oxygenase- 1 gene, an Nrf 2 -regulated gene linked to free radical pro-duction.

40|$|International audienceWe {{studied the}} {{relationship}} between Parkinson's disease (PD) and the S 18 Y polymorphism in the UCH-L 1 gene and the effect on this relationship of age at onset, smoking, and <b>pesticides.</b> Patients requested <b>free</b> health coverage for PD to the Mutualit?ociale Agricole (MSA), the French health insurance organization for people whose work is related to agriculture. Controls requested reimbursement of health expenses to the MSA. A maximum of three controls were matched to each case. Analyses included participants with both parents born in Europe. There were no differences in S 18 Y genotypes between patients (n = 209; 67 % SS, 32 % SY, 1 % YY) and controls (n = 488; 66 % SS, 30 % SY, 4 % YY). The relationship between PD and S 18 Y was modified by age at onset (P = 0. 03). The Y allele was inversely associated with PD for patients with onset before 61 years (odds ratio [OR] = 0. 53; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 29 - 0. 99); there was no association for older patients (62 - 68 years: OR = 1. 21; 95 % CI, 0. 67 - 2. 20; > 68 years: OR = 1. 24; 95 % CI, 0. 67 - 2. 31). Among patients, Y carriers had a later onset than noncarriers (P = 0. 04). These findings were not modified or confounded by smoking and pesticides. In this community-based case-control study, carriers of the Y allele were at decreased risk of developing PD at a young age, independently of pesticides and smoking...|$|R
