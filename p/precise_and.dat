5|$|As {{technology}} improved, {{measurement of}} depth, {{latitude and longitude}} became more <b>precise</b> <b>and</b> it became possible to collect more or less continuous sets of data points. This allowed researchers to draw accurate and detailed maps of {{large areas of the}} ocean floor. Use of a continuously recording fathometer enabled Tolstoy & Ewing in the summer of 1947 to identify and describe the first abyssal plain. This plain, south of Newfoundland, is now known as the Sohm Abyssal Plain. Following this discovery many other examples were found in all the oceans.|$|E
5|$|Bobby Dodd {{took over}} the Georgia Tech {{football}} program following Coach Alexander's retirement in 1944. Dodd's coaching philosophy revolved around player treatment and character development. He {{did not believe in}} intense physical practices but rather <b>precise</b> <b>and</b> well executed practices. Dodd's philosophy translated to winning. He set the record for career wins at Tech at 165 career coaching wins including a 31-game winning streak from 1951–1952. He also managed to capture two Southeastern Conference Titles and the 1952 National Title, which concluded a 12–0 perfect season and Sugar Bowl conquest of previously undefeated, seventh ranked Ole Miss in a season that also included victories over Orange Bowl champions, 9th ranked, Alabama; 15th ranked Gator Bowl champions Florida Gators football; 16th ranked Duke; and a 7–4 rival Georgia. While 9–0 Michigan State would capture the AP and UP titles, the Yellow Jackets' were ranked first in the International News Service poll.|$|E

5|$|There are {{a number}} of {{different}} strands to the history of fiddle playing in County Donegal. Perhaps the best-known and, in {{the last half of the}} twentieth century, the most influential has been that of the Doherty family. Hugh Doherty is the first known musician of this family. Born in 1790, he headed an unbroken tradition of fiddlers and pipers in the Doherty family until the death, in 1980, of perhaps the best-known Donegal fiddler, John Doherty. John, a travelling tinsmith, was known for his extremely <b>precise</b> <b>and</b> fast finger- and bow-work and vast repertoire, and is considered to be one of the greatest Irish fiddlers ever recorded. John's older brother, Mickey, was also recorded and, though Mickey was another of the great Irish fiddlers, his reputation has been overshadowed by John's.|$|E
5|$|Although clepsydrae {{were more}} useful than sundials—they {{could be used}} indoors, during the night, and also when the sky was cloudy—they were not as {{accurate}}; the Greeks, therefore, sought a way to improve their water clocks. Although still not as accurate as sundials, Greek water clocks became more accurate around 325, and they were adapted to have a face with an hour hand, making {{the reading of the}} clock more <b>precise</b> <b>and</b> convenient. One of the more common problems in most types of clepsydrae was caused by water pressure: when the container holding the water was full, the increased pressure caused the water to flow more rapidly. This problem was addressed by Greek and Roman horologists beginning in 100, and improvements continued {{to be made in the}} following centuries. To counteract the increased water flow, the clock's water containers—usually bowls or jugs—were given a conical shape; positioned with the wide end up, a greater amount of water had to flow out in order to drop the same distance as when the water was lower in the cone. Along with this improvement, clocks were constructed more elegantly in this period, with hours marked by gongs, doors opening to miniature figurines, bells, or moving mechanisms. There were some remaining problems, however, which were never solved, such as the effect of temperature. Water flows more slowly when cold, or may even freeze.|$|E

5|$|Although, {{the use of}} oil as {{a binding}} agent {{can be traced to}} the 12th century, {{innovations}} in its handling and manipulation define the era. Egg tempera was the dominant medium until the 1430s, and while it produces both bright and light colours, it dries quickly and is a difficult medium in which to achieve naturalistic textures or deep shadows. Oil allows smooth, translucent surfaces and can be applied in a range of thicknesses, from fine lines to thick broad strokes. It dries slowly and is easily manipulated while still wet. These characteristics allowed more time to add subtle detail and enable wet-on-wet techniques. Smooth transitions of colour are possible because portions of the intermediary layers of paint can be wiped or removed as the paint dries. Oil enables differentiation among degrees of reflective light, from shadow to bright beams, and minute depictions of light effects through the use of transparent glazes. This new freedom in controlling light effects gave rise to more <b>precise</b> <b>and</b> realistic depictions of surface textures; van Eyck and van der Weyden typically show light falling on surfaces such as jewellery, wooden floors, textiles and household objects.|$|E
5|$|If, in {{the famous}} garden and {{cemetery}} scenes the dialogue of the two lovers, Juliet's asides, and Romeo's passionate outbursts are not sung, if the duets of love and despair are given to the orchestra, the reasons are numerous and easy to comprehend. First, and this alone would be sufficient, it is a symphony and not an opera. Second, since duets of this nature have been handled vocally a thousand times by the greatest masters, it was wise as well as unusual to attempt another means of expression. It is also because the very sublimity of this love made its depiction so dangerous for the musician {{that he had to}} give his imagination a latitude that the positive sense of the sung words would not have given him, resorting instead to instrumental language, which is richer, more varied, less <b>precise,</b> <b>and</b> by its very indefiniteness incomparably more powerful in such a case.|$|E
5|$|The {{challenge}} with Kibble balances {{is not only}} in reducing their uncertainty, but also in making them truly practical realizations of the kilogram. Nearly every aspect of Kibble balances and their support equipment requires such extraordinarily <b>precise</b> <b>and</b> accurate, state-of-the-art technology that—unlike a device like an atomic clock—few countries would currently choose to fund their operation. For instance, the NIST's Kibble balance used four resistance standards in 2007, each of which was rotated through the Kibble balance every two to six weeks after being calibrated in {{a different part of}} NIST headquarters facility in Gaithersburg, Maryland. It was found that simply moving the resistance standards {{down the hall to the}} Kibble balance after calibration altered their values 10ppb (equivalent to 10µg) or more. Present-day technology is insufficient to permit stable operation of Kibble balances between even biannual calibrations. If the kilogram is defined in terms of the Planck constant, it is likely there will only be a few—at most—Kibble balances initially operating in the world.|$|E
40|$|Extended on the {{approach}} {{in the first part}} of this two-part series of papers, multiobjective interregional equilibrium is analyzed within a multiobjective fuzzy linear programming framework. Interregional problems with <b>precise</b> objectives <b>and</b> <b>precise</b> constraints, with fuzzy objectives <b>and</b> <b>precise</b> constraints, <b>and</b> with fuzzy objectives and fuzzy constraints are individually examined. Properties of the equilibrium solution and of the associated dual optimal problem are investigated. The present framework comprises ordinary multiobjective interregional equilibrium problems as a special case. A variety of interregional optimization problems can be effectively solved through the use of fuzzy linear programming, as discussed in this two-part series of papers. ...|$|R

5|$|The {{two ships}} opened fire just before 18:00 {{at a range}} of about , with Shannon scoring the first hit, {{striking}} Chesapeake {{on one of her}} forward gunports with two round shot and a bag of musket balls fired by William Mindham, the gun captain of the aftmost of Shannons starboard 18-pounders. Chesapeake was moving faster than Shannon, and as she ranged {{down the side of the}} British ship, the destruction inflicted by the <b>precise</b> <b>and</b> methodical gunnery of the British crew moved aft with the American's forward gun crews suffering the heaviest losses. However, the American crew were well drilled and, despite their losses, returned fire briskly. As Chesapeake was heeling, many of their shots struck the water or waterline of Shannon causing little damage, but American carronade fire caused serious damage to Shannons rigging. In particular, a 32-pound carronade ball struck the piled shot for the Shannons 12-pounder gun that was stowed in the main chains; the shot was propelled through the timbers to scatter like hail across the gundeck.|$|E
