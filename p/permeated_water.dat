PRO processes, which use Seawater Reverse Osmosis (SWRO) brine as draw solutions, have a higher potential of being applied to any new, and existing membrane based seawater desalination systems, as an energy production and/or conservation process. Hydraulic pressure is applied on a high salinity draw solution, and the hydraulic pressure of the high salinity draw solution can be kept relatively constant during operation, even though the volumetric flow rate is to be increased. Therefore, the draw side of the PRO process can be considered near-isobaric, in most cases.

The quantitative analysis of water and ethanol from the cathode effluent {{has been carried out}} on-line by a GC under the following operation conditions: T(cell) = 30 - 90 degrees C, ethanol aqueous solution concentration C(ethanol) = 0 - 12. 0 mol L(- 1), helium flow rate at the cathode F(He), in the range of 80 - 1500 mL, min(- 1) and liquid solution flow rate to the anode F(1) = 0. 2 mL min(- 1). It was found that the water crossover rate is almost one order of magnitude higher than ethanol's. It was also found that the ethanol crossover rate depends on ethanol concentration and presents a volcano behavior, with the peak value at ethanol concentration of 8. 0 mol L(- 1). This could be attributed to the different swelling behavior of the Nafion((R)) membrane in the presence of various ethanol aqueous solutions.

On the other hand, TM-polarised light will encounter relatively smaller absorption due to a much lower optical conductivity. It was also observed that the conductivity of the GO film {{is affected by the}} amount of water molecule present in the film. Water molecules are able to permeate {{in and out of the}} GO film freely due to the film natural properties. The <b>permeated</b> <b>water</b> molecules readily interact with the functional groups of each individual GO layer and this interaction reduces the film conductivity by further widening its bandgap. This process was reversible when the water content in the film was reduced. In addition, photothermal reduction through optical phonon relaxation of GO film using near infrared light source was studied. A numerical model of wave propagation in GO film was then developed followed by experimental verification of the model. The GO film was then coated onto a planar optical waveguide. Strong polarisation effect was observed due to the large anisotropy complex dielectric function of GO film. The GO film functionalized waveguide polariser showed a broad band response over the visible and near infrared wavelength range with a maximum polarisation extinction ratio of more than 40 dB in the 1550 nm optical fibre communication window.

The research objective is to design and synthesize self-healing hydrogels in water/oil/gas system targeted for the separation of water from oil-water mixtures. This will be achieved by graft polymerization of water-soluble polymer such as polyacrylamide (PAM) homo-polymer and poly (Na-Ac/AM) copolymer reinforcing on a thin-fine metallic mesh. This work also involves {{the study of the}} effect of mesh size on the amount of water recovered from the oil-water mixture. Further, the factors affecting the micro porosity of synthesized hydrogels such as swelling index are investigated. The hydrogel coated percentage and swelling index (a characteristic property of hydrogels that indicates how much water is absorbed by the gel) are investigated. Different experiments are performed using several mesh sizes and various industrial oils. The hydrogel morphology was analysed by using scanning electron microscopy. Experiments conducted provide quantitative data regarding the degree of the separation of oil from water by using hydrogels. PAM Hydrogel- Coated Mesh was fabricated using a photo-initiated polymerization process with acrylamide (AM), N, N’-methylene bisacrylamide (BIS), 2, 2 ’-diethoxyacetophenone (DEOP), and polyacrylamide (PAM) (number average molecular weight is M_n= 5, 000, 000 - 6, 000, 000) as the precursor, cross-linker, initiator and adhesive agent, respectively. Distilled water was used to dissolve the AM, BIS, DEOP and PAM (50, 55, 60 : 1. 5 : 1 : 0. 5 by weight) respectively. Furthermore, Poly (Na-Ac/AM) Hydrogel-Coated Mesh was fabricated also by a photo-initiated polymerization process with sodium acrylate (Na-Ac), acrylamide (AM), N, N’-methylene bisacrylamide (BIS), 2, 2 ’-diethoxyacetophenone (DEOP), and polyacrylamide (PAM), as co-monomer, precursor, cross-linker, initiator and adhesive agent, respectively. In these copolymer hydrogels, distilled water was used to dissolve the Na-Ac, AM, BIS, DEOP and PAM (10, 55, 50, 5 : 1. 5 : 1 : 0. 5 by weight) respectively. The effect of the copolymer concentration on the separation time was studied through changing the monomers and the water concentrations. Oil-water mixtures of 5 / 95, 10 / 90 and 30 / 70 Oil/Water % were chosen based on industrial practices as it is not typical to find a wastewater stream with more than 30 % oil composition. In all cases, water passes through the mesh, whereas the oil remained in the upper glass tube. Any remnant oil that existed in the <b>permeated</b> <b>water</b> inside the beaker was analysed with an oil analyser. The wettability of water and oil on the PAM- hydrogel coated mesh was evaluated using the contact angle measurements obtained at ambient temperature. It was found that PAM polymer and Na-Ac/AM copolymer hydrogel coated meshes is a super-hydrophilic in an air-solid-liquid three phases with both the contact angle of oil and water lower than 15 degree and in under-water membrane become highly repulsive for oil, where all underwater OCAs of the four different size of meshes based on PAM coated mesh are greater than 90 degree. This indicates the hydrophobic properties of the coated mesh under the water and oil cannot penetrate through the coated mesh while the water absorbed through it. The difference in the water flow or separation time becomes smaller with increasing the mesh’s pore size up to 80 micron, while separation time was higher for 200 micron mesh as more hydrogel was as hydrogel was blocking the pores. In contrast, the separation time is faster with the copolymer due to the higher swelling capacity of the copolymer. Therefore, under-water oleo-phobic properties of the PAM coated mesh make it a promising candidate for many applications, such as for wastewater treatment produced in industry and daily life with more than 95 % separation efficiency. However, Na-Ac/AM copolymers coated meshes have lower separation efficiency than PAM homo-polymer due the highest swelling capacity of copolymers hydrogels, which end up with taking off from the mesh...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the synthesis, characterization, {{and application of}} Hydroxy Sodalite (H-SOD) membranes in selective separation of water from aqueous solutions and reaction media. The emphasis {{has been put on}} the development of a tight membrane film that could be primarily used for water separation only, followed by an explorative study on the performance of the membrane under elevated temperatures and pressures. Zeolite membranes are often composed of (an) intergrown layer(s) of crystals bonded to the surface of a support material. The crystal size and morphology, affinity of crystals with the support surface, and synthesis conditions determine the closure of the film. An interplay between these factors contributes to the formation of a film with no or very few defects. As described in Chapter 2, prior to preparation of the membrane, the conditions needed for synthesizing the powder were optimized through a series of experimentation studies. The synthesis time and temperature were varied accordingly to favour formation of hydroxy sodalite and inhibit the co-formation of other types of zeolites, which are often co-found as impurity phases (e. g., zeolites A, -X, and -P). The as-synthesized powder was tested for the amount of water it was capable of adsorbing and releasing. Similar to other members of the sodalite family, hydroxy sodalite consists of ?-cages, which can be occupied by water. As the cages are very small, the presence of this water contributes to the occupation of most of the available space. From TG/DT studies, it was found that hydroxy sodalite can release its entire crystalline water, but after this it is no longer capable of adsorbing back the lost water. Subsequently, if the material is only partially dehydrated, the lost water can be re-adsorbed. Therefore, provided that (part of) the crystalline water in the cages is preserved, sodalite has potential for water uptake. Following this, the thermostability of the crystals was studied during high temperature XRD measurements. The material maintained its structure up to 650 oC after which it started transforming to denser phases. Interestingly, the supported membrane showed a higher thermostability than the powder material. Attempts to increase the Si/Al ratio of the SOD were not successful, with the followed template-free synthesis procedure always the basic ratio of 1 was obtained. Based on the conditions optimized for synthesis of H-SOD powder, the membrane was developed. As highlighted in Chapter 3, unlike powder synthesis, which was successful over a range of different conditions (90 - 140 oC, 3 - 20 hrs), membrane synthesis only prevailed in a narrow range (~ 140 oC, 3. 5 hours). In contrast to powder formation, in membrane synthesis the rotation of the autoclave containing the sol and the support was essential, as was pre-treatment of the support. Rotation during synthesis ensures better mixing of the solution whereby concentration and temperature gradients in the autoclave are minimized. Support pre-treatment was found as another prerequisite. Supports were degassed prior each synthesis, this was done to prevent release of trapped air from the support pores during synthesis in the form of bubbles on the surface where crystals cannot (inter) grow. This combination of rotation during synthesis and support degassing resulted in the formation of closed membrane films which showed no N 2 permeability and very little He permeation (beyond detection limit of the set-up). The membrane <b>permeated</b> <b>water</b> at reasonable fluxes (up to 2. 1 kg. m- 2. h- 1) at elevated temperatures and pressures (200 oC, 22 bar), and was further used to separate water from a series of organic alcohols-water mixtures as demonstrated in Chapter 4. Two different types of alcohol homologues were dewatered, primary and secondary, where effect of operating conditions on the water flux were studied. In case of primary alcohols (methanol, ethanol, 1 -propanol, 1 -butanol, and 1 -pentanol) the water flux through the membrane increased with increasing water concentration, whereas the flux in the secondary alcohol systems showed a different dependency. In these, the membrane showed almost no permeability towards water until a certain water concentration above which the flux started increasing rapidly, although it generally remained very low compared to the corresponding case as in dewatering the primary alcohol. The behavior, although largely speculative, is attributed to the blocking of surface voids in the membrane by the secondary alcohols. The membranes showed good stability under the high temperatures and pressures (up to 200 oC at 22 bar) applied and were highly water selective with no traces of any of the tested alcohols in the permeate. Establishing the thermal and mechanical stability of the membrane and building on its excellent selectivity towards water, the long-term chemical stability of the membrane was evaluated under exposure to strong acidic and basic media as shown in Chapter 5. The membrane preserved its performance in a range of 2. 9 ? pH ? 13. 7. This characteristic was used in employing a H-SOD membrane later under reaction conditions (Chapters 7 and 8). Due to its very high water selectivity over other components, the H-SOD membrane was employed in desalinating seawater and other salt solutions (Chapter 6). The resultant permeate water was found to be ultra pure, i. e., (almost) no traces of original ions or salts were detected in the water. The findings open different windows for application of H-SOD membranes in industry or laboratories. Also here some unexplained phenomena were observed, namely the addition of NaCl increased the water flux through the membrane, like for seawater, whereas NaNO 3 addition lowered the flux. The applicability of the membrane in a catalytic membrane reactor was tested in esterification of acetic acid with ethanol and butanol. As illustrated in Chapter 7, the membrane was capable of selectively removing water under the reaction conditions, whereby the conversion was increased by 30 % leading to completion of the reaction. Chapter 8 finalises the use of H-SOD in relation to the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. The performance of H-SOD is compared with that of an amorphous silica membrane and a ceramic supported polymer membrane. A previous study on the application of the latter two membranes under FT conditions had showed the disintegration of the membranes at the high reaction temperature and pressure and abundant presence of water. In contrast, a hydroxy sodalite membrane which was employed in separating water from water/hydrogen streams at elevated temperatures and pressures showed absolute selectivity towards water while maintaining its stability. Hydroxy sodalite is an attractive material in terms of water separation applications at elevated temperatures and pressures. Fluxes remain low compared to other reported hydrophilic membranes. However, depending on the application and where costs of product recovery or recycling are detrimental to the process, sodalite is a clear candidate in that it is absolutely selective towards water, withstands thermal and mechanical stresses, and is chemically stable under not-too severe acidic and basic conditions. The future challenges in this respect comes down to the production of defect free membranes that can be scaled out in form of a membrane module or otherwise to drive flux to higher values worthy of industrial appreciation. Following the experimental study demonstrated in this thesis, utilization of hydroxy sodalite membranes under different reactive conditions will be a field for future exploration.

40|$|Naturally {{occurring}} pores show {{a variety}} of polarities and sizes that are presumably directly linked to their biological function. Many biological channels are selective toward permeants similar or smaller in size than water molecules, and therefore their pores operate in the regime of single-file water pores. Intrinsic factors affecting water permeability through such pores include the channel-membrane match, the structural stability of the channel, the channel geometry and channel-water affinity. We present an extensive molecular dynamics study {{on the role of}} the channel geometry and polarity on the water osmotic and diffusive permeability coefficients. We show that the polarity of the naturally occurring peptidic channels is close to optimal for water permeation, and that the water mobility for a wide range of channel polarities is essentially length independent. By systematically varying the geometry and polarity of model hydrophilic pores, based on the fold of gramicidin A, the water density, occupancy, and permeability are studied. Our focus is on the characterization of the transition between different permeation regimes in terms of the structure of water in the pores, the average pore occupancy and the dynamics of the <b>permeating</b> <b>water</b> molecules. We show that a general relationship between osmotic and diffusive water permeability coefficients in the single-file regime accounts for the time averaged pore occupancy, and that the dynamics of the <b>permeating</b> <b>water</b> molecules through narrow non single file channels effectively behaves like independent single-file columns...|$|R
