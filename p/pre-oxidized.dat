40|$|Caking coal is {{difficult}} to be gasified in fluidized bed (FB) because of the inevitable particle agglomeration caused by caking in the dense bottom of the bed. Literature {{studies have shown that}} <b>pre-oxidizing</b> the coal can suppress its caking propensity, while quick dispersion of coal particles, for example, by gas jetting in the plastic stage of heating is critical to such a suppression of the caking agglomeration. Thus, the so-called jetting pre-oxidation fluidized bed gasification (JPFBG) is devised in this study to gasify caking coal in FB. Coal particles usually below 5 mm are blown into the space above the bottom dense bed surface by an O- 2 -containing gas jet to disperse and meanwhile to <b>pre-oxidize</b> the particles. The resulting char particles with little, even without caking propensity fall into the dense bottom of the bed to allow their gasification there. After validating the destruction of caking agglomeration by jetting pre-oxidation in a laboratory FB apparatus, a 150 kg/h pilot JPFBG plant was built and the coal with the caking index of about 20 was successfully gasified in this plant using normal air and O- 2 -enriched air. The heating vale of the produced gas varied in 2. 9 - 5. 0 MJ/m(N) (3) and decreased with raising the oxygen percentage applied to the jet feeding. Raising the oxygen percentage for the jet caused more of the produced gas formed in the bottom dense bed of char gasification to burn off in the jetting zone. The optimal proportion of the oxygen applied to the jet feeding or coal pre-oxidation was found to be about 37 % against the total oxygen supply. Enriching the 02 content in the gasification agent to about 30 vol. % enhanced greatly the gasification rate of the tested low-reactivity coal in JPFB. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Comprising over 70 % of the Earth's surface, {{water is}} {{undoubtedly}} {{the most precious}} natural resource that exists on our planet. Without the seemingly invaluable compound comprised of hydrogen and oxygen, life on Earth would be non-existent: {{it is essential for}} everything on our planet to grow and prosper. Although we as humans recognize this fact, we disregard it by polluting our rivers, lakes, and oceans. Subsequently, we are slowly but surely harming our planet to the point where organisms are dying at a very alarming rate. In addition to innocent organisms dying off, our drinking water has become greatly affected as is our ability to use water for recreational purposes. In order to combat water pollution, we must understand the problems and become part of the solution. When is compared with other options of processing, biological treatment of residual water is considered a cheap and attractive alternative to eliminate various types of contaminants. The effíciency of the biological process depends on many factors such as the concentration of the contaminants, the chemical structure of the composed, the pH and the presence of inhibitory compounds in wastewater. Although some organic contaminants can be degraded through biological process, many other composed synthetic and natural are not biodegradable. On the hand, several chemical processes as advanced oxidation processes (AOP's) can be use for mineralization of many organic contaminants. The doubt that presents these processes is the use of expensive reagents. A potential viable solution proposed during last two decays is the combination of these processes with biological processing. In these combined processes, the chemical process would be utilized like pre-treatment step to enhance the biodegradability and elimínate the toxicity of the effluents, while the total mineralization would be completed in the biological process. For it, it is interesting to monitor the changes in the biodegradability of the effluents along the chemical process, this may be use to determine the optimum pre-treatment time. In the literature various indicators have been proposed to follow the biodegradability, where the ratios BOD 5 /COD and BOD 5 /TOC are the most utilized (BOD: Biological oxygen demand); COD: Chemical oxygen demand; TOC: total organic carbón). In general, are municipal wastewater was taken as reference values. Thus, it is considered that an effluent is biodegradable when the relation BOD 5 /COD is over 0. 4 or BOD 5 /TOC over 1. 0 (Metcalf & Eddy, 1985). The AOP's are defined like those processes that imply the generation of radicals highly reagents (especially radical hidroxilo) in suffícient quantities. Although most organic matter can be degraded by these processes, other compounds as the acetic acids,maleico and oxálico, acetona or cloroformo are not attacked by these radicals (Bigda, 1995). The advantage of AOP's {{comes from the fact that}} radicals can be formed through different processes. In this study, AOP's based on photo-oxidation well be used for treatment of water contained Phenol and 2, 4 -dichlorophenol. In the first chapter of this work a general literature review the reactions are presented in which a series of methods for the treating refractory were proposed, among them is found the adsorption in active carbon, humid oxidation, supercritical oxidation, electrochemical oxidation, chemical oxidation in its two parts classics and advanced oxidation. For all, a small bibliographical search as well previous publication in elimination of phenol (POH) and 2, 4 -dichlorophenol (DCP) are presented. Moreover, it was presented a basic explanation of the characteristics of the biological processing and its operational types. At the end of this chapter, it has been introduced a figure (Figure 3. 4) that shows a possible strategy to treat any type of wastewater depending on the organic load and the biodegradability. With respect to the results, the thesis present a framework of the combination of AOP's and biological treatment. In this case, synthetic residual water containing phenol (POH) and 2, 4 -diclorophenol (DCP) and textile dyes. These compound associates as contaminants in different types of water. They appear in different types of industrial effluents and included among the 130 priority contaminants gives by US EPA and the European Union. A study of the behaviour of these substances for a possible biological degradation showed that all presented low biodegradability, and some as the DCP and textile dyes were inhibited for biomass. Thus, it was necessary to seek alternatives treatment processes. In a first part of this work, the degradation of these composed was studied by means of advanced oxidation processes (AOP's), based on the use of the process of photo oxidation, in this case, direct irradiation with light UV or UVA, and combination these sources of light with; UV(A) /H 202, UV(A) /Fe(III),UV(A) /Fe(II) /H 202 and the process Fenton. These experiments were performed in four different, two of them are type tubular and the other two are type stirred tank. The followed variables along the process were the concentration of the contaminants, pH, initial concentration of the H 202, Conc. Initial of Fe(II), time of irradiation and total organic carbon (TOC). The effect of irradiation time in the degradation of both the POH and DCP was studied. Also, kinetic of the reactions were followed. Results show that direct UV photolysis is not efficient for DCP and POH elimination. First order reaction constant of aprox. 0. 0056 min- 1 and 0. 0066 min- 1 was obtained for POH and DCP, respect.) Also the combinations of this process with other hydroxyl radical sours were studied, for e. j., the effect of the quantity of peroxide or Fa(II), or the black light irradiation with UV at (300 - 420 nm) vs. 254 nm. By means of the combination H 202 /UV/Fe removals percentages of 100 DCP and POH were achieved. During these reactions, by-products were identified, for POH it was identified caticlos, quinone and hidroquinoin. In the case of DCP, only it was possible to identify the clorobenzoquinona and some carboxylic acids. As it was mentiond above, the hostility that AOP's presents is use of expensive reagents, and a possible alternative is the combination with biological process. In this study also, some strategies for these types of combination have been established, that was possible by means of a study of the improvement in the biodegradability of the treated solutions. In a second part of the work, therefore, the effect of these processes was studied in the biodegradability enhancement of the solutions. The better results were obtained by means of the process photo-Fenton, the ratios BOD 5 /COD increased from O up to 0. 92 and 0. 48 for solutions of 100 ppm of POH and DCP respectively. After time of irradiation of 30 min and initial concentrations of H 2 02 of 65 ppm and 300 ppm, respectively. Later the improvement of the biodegradability of the treated solutions, was studied the biodegradation of some solutions pre-tried of POH and DCP. Respect the DCP treated, the results have shown that activated sludge of a municipal wastewater plant could be adequate for the treatment of the <b>pre-oxidize</b> solutions and that was possible through co-digestion of the same with a residual water. By means of the combination photo Fenton -biological treatment. It was achieved up to a 89 of organic matter elimination. Continuing this line of investigation, it was developed also a complete combined processes consist of DCP pre-treated via Photo oxidation and aerobic and anaerobio biological reactors type SBR (sequencing batch reactor). By means of this process, elimination of organic matter up to 93 of TOC was obtained in a signifícant cycle time. The same strategy was applied to phenol, in this part a comparison has been established between single and coupled processes, the results have been shown that good improvement in organic matter take place in the combined processes. Finally, the use of the photo oxidation processes was examined to eliminate the colour and improvement the biodegradability of dyes solutions. The results have shown that these processes can be use efficiently for colour elimination and biodegradability improvement of dyes solutions...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 52 - 59) The frequent {{detection of}} antibiotics {{in the environment}} is causing great concern in scientific communities and public health agencies due to the potential adverse health effects the chemicals may have on aquatic life, animals and possibly humans. The major concern associated with this contamination {{is related to the}} selection and development of resistance and its implications for human medicine. Ciprofloxacin (CIP), the focus of this research, is an antibiotic frequently detected in aquatic environments. It has been detected in surface waters from 9 ng/L up to 30 ng/L and in hospital effluents from 0. 7 [lower case mu]g/L to 125 [lower case mu]g/L. Previous studies have shown that ozonation is an effective treatment method to remove antibiotics from water and wastewater. However, there is limited data on the potential development of resistance in microorganisms from exposure to reaction-intermediates formed during ozonation. The objective of this research was to investigate the possibility and rate of development of resistance in E. coli exposed to CIP solutions <b>pre-oxidized</b> at different levels. Analysis of the potential for the development of resistance was organized around the ozonation of 1000 [lower case mu]g/L CIP solution to various degrees of oxidation and exposing the <b>pre-oxidized</b> solution to initially non-resistant E. coli. Five oxidation levels at 98. 03, 98. 84, 99. 22, 99. 93, and 100 % CIP removal were used. The equivalent concentrations of these five oxidation levels were 19. 5, 11. 7, 7. 81, 0. 7, and 0 [lower case mu]g/L residual CIP. Three non-oxidized CIP exposures were conducted at concentrations comparable to three <b>pre-oxidized</b> CIP at 19. 5, 11. 7, and 7. 81 [lower case mu]g/L to compare the effects of non-oxidized CIP and <b>pre-oxidized</b> CIP exposures on initially non-resistant E. coli. The mean Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations (MIC) were determined for 12, 24, 48, and 72 -hour exposures and compared to MIC of the control (0 [lower case mu]g/L) to evaluate the potential for the development of resistance in E. coli. The results showed that the <b>pre-oxidized</b> CIP resulted in higher MICs than the control at all exposure times. This may indicate the development of a novel resistance by mutation of the bacteria or an up-regulation of an existing dormant gene. Some <b>pre-oxidized</b> CIP and non-oxidized CIP exposures showed to be significantly different from the control. As the exposure time increased, the MICs of both the <b>pre-oxidized</b> and non-oxidized CIP solutions became significantly different from the control, indicating an increased potential for development of resistance.

40|$|This master {{thesis is}} based on {{reduction}} experiments of pelletized Tyssedal ilmenite. The focus is set {{on the effect of}} changing parameters such as gas composition, gas flow, pellet size and pre-oxidation condition. The results are interpret regarding values of conversion, degree of metalization, XRF-analysis and microstructure images. Based on these results the aim was to find out how these parameters influenced reduction. Another goal was to reveal what hampered reduction inside both grains and pellets and caused the two stage reduction behaviour. EPMA was used to examine pellets and grains and to look for explanation for the slow reduction. XRD-analysis was decisive for explaining the importance of optimum pre-oxidation for the subsequent reduction. <b>Pre-oxidized</b> and green pellets with a size fraction of 8 - 10 mm were heated in a thermogravimetric analyzer. Ar was used during heating and cooling. Reduction occurred at 930 - 940 &# 176;C, with either CO, H 2 or both for up to 45 minutes. Gas flows used were 4. 8, 7 and 9 Nl/min. In total 18 experiments were carried out. Weight before and after reduction was measured, calculations of degree of metalization, XRF- and XRD-analysis was done. Microstructure images, point analysis, line scan and mapping were obtained by EPMA. Highest final values of conversion, c. 0. 9, were obtained for <b>pre-oxidized</b> pellets from 2011 reduced with H 2. Maximum degree of metalization, 94 - 99 % were obtained after reduction of <b>pre-oxidized</b> pellets from 2010. Final value of conversion and degree of metalization were 0. 23 and c. 24 % higher for <b>pre-oxidized</b> pellets from 2010 than from 2011. Only green pellets from 2011 was harder to reduce with CO. Reducibility was not increased with the pre-oxidation conditions at ETI Tyssedal in January 2011. In spite of that the <b>pre-oxidized</b> pellets from 2010 and 2011 are made in the same manner and from the same raw material they react differently during reduction. This should be kept in mind when comparing results from different sources. Reduction of <b>pre-oxidized</b> pellets occurred in two distinct linear stages separated by a clear bend. A normal behaviour with steadily decreasing oxygen removal rate was observed with green pellets. An increased flow of CO from 7 Nl/min to 9 Nl/min resulted in decreased reduction. Examination by EPMA confirmed the presence of the barrier effect and higher amount of oxygen 0. 6 - 1. 0 mm from the surface. This indicates hampered reduction in grains and pellets. This combined with slow migration of CO/CO 2 in the pellets can partly explain the unusual reduction behaviour. <b>Pre-oxidized</b> pellets from 2010 contains higher amount of the easily reducible M 3 O 5, and less M 2 O 3 compared to <b>pre-oxidized</b> pellets from 2011.

40|$|<b>Pre-oxidized</b> {{polyacrylonitrile}} fibers were carbonized in BCl 3. Effect {{of processing}} temperature and time on B element {{content in the}} PAN-based carbon fibers was studied. A series of techniques including XPS, FTIR and SEM, were employed to characterize the composition {{and structure of the}} sample. The microwave absorbing properties of the resultant PAN-based carbon fibers were studied by voten network analyzer. The results indicate that the <b>pre-oxidized</b> polyacrylonitrile fibers are converted to carbon fibers by carbonization in BCl 3 and BCN attachments are formed. The resultant fiber forms B–N bonds at the same time. The permittivity of carbon fibers/paraffin is lower in comparison of that of fibers carbonized in N 2, especially the imaginary part of the permittivity of carbon fibers paraffin reduces fastly.

The results {{have been used to}} determine the influences of these chemical (preoxidation) and mechanical (shot-peening) treatments on the high temperature oxidation of zirconium. The oxygen profile was revealed using micro-hardness techniques and confirmed by SEM-EDS techniques. After pre-oxidation the samples were first resurfaced then shot-peened in order to introduce residual stress. A significant increase of the hardness of about 400 HV was observed on <b>pre-oxidized</b> shot-peened samples. Thermogravimetric analysis for 30 min at 650 C under 200 mbar O 2 showed a significantly slower oxidation rate for shot-peened samples.

Both C and CNF layer thicknesses increase with time, but samples <b>pre-oxidized</b> at 500 °C normally lead to thinner CNF layers and thicker C layers, {{as compared to}} samples <b>pre-oxidized</b> and reduced at 700 °C. The mechanical stability of CNFs decreases with growth time, especially for oxidized-reduced samples. The addition of H 2 creates a maximum in the CNF thickness that coincides with a minimum in the C layer thickness, at 5 % H 2 for samples oxidized at 500 °C and at 20 % H 2 for samples oxidized-reduced at 700 °C.
