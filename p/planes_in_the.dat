5|$|The Laue back {{reflection}} mode records X-rays scattered backwards {{from a broad}} spectrum source. This is useful if the sample is too thick for X-rays to transmit through it. The diffracting <b>planes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> crystal are determined by knowing that the normal to the diffracting plane bisects the angle between the incident beam and the diffracted beam. A Greninger chart {{can be used to}} interpret the {{back reflection}} Laue photograph.|$|E
5|$|The Marcellus {{appears in}} {{outcrops}} {{along the northern}} margin of the formation in central New York.

5|$|The task {{groups were}} forced to stay within enemy air range longer than {{anticipated}} due to Canberra situation. Early morning fighter sweeps were launched to suppress air power on Luzon and Formosa while the newly formed task group attempted to escort Canberra to safety. Some air groups encountered Japanese <b>planes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> strike zones, but no major air-to-air combat developed. Throughout the afternoon, enemy aircraft flew to {{the perimeter of the}} task groups to relay sighting reports.|$|E
5|$|Flight Unlimited II is a 1997 flight {{simulator}} video game developed by Looking Glass Studios {{and published by}} Eidos Interactive. The player controls one of five <b>planes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> airspace of the San Francisco Bay Area, which is shared with up to 600 artificially intelligent aircraft directed by real-time air traffic control. The game eschews the aerobatics focus of its predecessor, Flight Unlimited, in favor of general civilian aviation. As such, new physics code and an engine were developed, the former because the programmer of Flight Unlimiteds computational fluid dynamics system, Seamus Blackley, had left the company.|$|E
5|$|The hardest natural {{diamonds}} mostly {{originate from}} the Copeton and Bingara fields {{located in the}} New England area in New South Wales, Australia. These diamonds are generally small, perfect to semiperfect octahedra, and are used to polish other diamonds. Their hardness {{is associated with the}} crystal growth form, which is single-stage crystal growth. Most other diamonds show more evidence of multiple growth stages, which produce inclusions, flaws, and defect <b>planes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> crystal lattice, all of which affect their hardness. It is possible to treat regular diamonds under a combination of high pressure and high temperature to produce diamonds that are harder than the diamonds used in hardness gauges.|$|E

5|$|Elsewhere in Europe, {{the beetle}} became {{established}} near USA {{military bases in}} Bordeaux during or immediately following World War I and had proceeded to spread {{by the beginning of}} World War II to Belgium, the Netherlands and Spain. The population increased dramatically during and immediately following World War II and spread eastward, and the beetle is now found over much of the continent. After World War II, in the Soviet occupation zone of Germany, almost half of all potato fields were infested by the beetle by 1950. In East Germany they were known as Amikäfer ('Yankee beetles') following a governmental claim that the beetles were dropped by American <b>planes.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> EU it remains a regulated (quarantine) pest for the UK, Republic of Ireland, Balearic Islands, Cyprus, Malta and southern parts of Sweden and Finland. It is not established in any of these Member States, but occasional infestations can occur when, for example, wind blows adults from Russia to Finland.|$|E
5|$|In 1809, Richard and Israel Inman {{constructed}} a gristmill {{at the foot}} of Solomon's Falls. It was converted to a house in 1833 and destroyed in 1850. A gristmill on the creek in Hanover Township had been built by 1812 and was run by George Mesinger. It was destroyed in 1840. In 1845, William Petty constructed the gristmill called Petty Mill in Hanover Township. This mill burned down in 1887. The Wyoming Division Canal, which was constructed in the 1830s, started at Solomon Creek. Construction of the Ashley <b>Planes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Solomon Creek gap began in 1837. They were used until 1848. An iron-producing forge operated on the creek in Ashley until 1839. There was also a sawmill on it until 1839. A powder mill operated on Solomon Creek, but was replaced with a brewery by 1885. A slaughterhouse discharged its waste into the creek in the early 20th century. The creek was used as the water supply for the Huber Breaker from the 1930s to the 1970s. The Wilkes-Barre and Hazleton Railway passed over Solomon Creek.|$|E
5|$|X-rays {{are used}} to produce the {{diffraction}} pattern because their wavelength λ is typically the same order of magnitude (1–100 angstroms) as the spacing d between <b>planes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> crystal. In principle, any wave impinging on a regular array of scatterers produces diffraction, as predicted first by Francesco Maria Grimaldi in 1665. To produce significant diffraction, the spacing between the scatterers and the wavelength of the impinging wave should be similar in size. For illustration, the diffraction of sunlight through a bird's feather was first reported by James Gregory in the later 17th century. The first artificial diffraction gratings for visible light were constructed by David Rittenhouse in 1787, and Joseph von Fraunhofer in 1821. However, visible light has too long a wavelength (typically, 5500 angstroms) to observe diffraction from crystals. Prior to the first X-ray diffraction experiments, the spacings between lattice planes in a crystal were not known with certainty.|$|E

25|$|Strategic weapons—weapons {{that could}} {{threaten}} an entire country—relied, {{for the time}} being, on long-range bombers that could penetrate deep into enemy territory. In the U.S., this requirement led, in 1946, to creation of the Strategic Air Command—a system of bombers headed by General Curtis LeMay (who previously presided over the firebombing of Japan during WWII). In operations like Chrome Dome, SAC kept nuclear-armed <b>planes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air 24 hours a day, ready for an order to attack Moscow.|$|E
25|$|There are no working {{waterway}} inclined <b>planes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> UK at the moment, but {{the remains}} of a famous one can be seen at Foxton in Leicestershire on the Leicester arm of the Grand Union Canal. The plane enabled wide-beam boats to bypass the flight of ten narrow locks, but failure to make improvements {{at the other end of}} the arm and high running costs led to its early demise. There are plans to restore it, and some funding has been obtained.|$|E

25|$|During the German retreat {{after the}} Battle of the Bulge, the 12th kept its <b>planes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air, {{spotting}} enemy vehicles, troops, and supplies. Medium bombers had knocked out so many {{roads and bridges}} that thousands of German vehicles were trying to escape, but {{had no way to}} move. On 26 January, 12th TRS pilots spotted 4,000 vehicles and called in P-47 Thunderbolt fighter-bombers in to finish the job. The 12th Squadron was commended by Generals Carl Spaatz and Weyland for its work during the German withdrawal.|$|E
25|$|On 26 September First Army {{began its}} great {{offensive}} near Verdun, {{and in response}} the German Air Service responded, very much reinforced. The squadron saw enemy aircraft patrolling and escorting reconnaissance <b>planes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region of Etain, and the patrol had a narrow escape. During the offensive, squadron pilots inflicted heavy losses upon enemy aircraft and balloons. As its pilots gained domination of the air, their responsibilities were expanded to include protection of ground forces, strafing of enemy troops and bombing of targets that could be observed within enemy lines.|$|E
25|$|To {{keep the}} plan simple, male names {{were given to}} fighters and float planes, and female names to bombers, {{reconnaissance}} aircraft and flying boats. Names beginning with T {{were given to the}} few transport <b>planes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Japanese inventory. Trainers were given names of trees, and gliders given names of birds. With the approval of General MacArthur, the MacArthur Southwest Pacific Code Name System came into being, circa September 1942, with an initial list of 50 names. The Tennessee background of Captain Frank McCoy, {{who was in charge of}} the ATAIU, was evident immediately because the initial names had a distinct hill-country flavour, such as Zeke, Rufe, Luke, Nate and others. The ATAIU quickly exhausted its list of hillbilly names and turned to names of friends and relatives.|$|E

25|$|General Ralph J. Mitchell, USMC, {{took over}} the command of all {{land-based}} <b>planes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> theater, called Air Command, Solomons (Airsols), on 20 November. Once the three airstrips in the Torokina Perimeter became fully functional, Mitchell moved Airsols headquarters there from Munda on New Georgia Island. The first raids by Airsols aircraft had limited success. Japanese anti-aircraft fire, especially from ships, had improved greatly since Kenney's raids, and inflicted significant damage on the raiders. Gradually, however, the Americans developed new formations and tactics that brought about increasing attrition among the Japanese fighter arm. The Navy could no longer risk exposing its ships to the relentless air attacks, and by late January, Admiral Kusaka had banned all shipping except barges from Simpson Harbor, which removed any remaining naval threat to the Torokina beachhead.|$|E
25|$|Louis-Dreyfus lent {{her voice}} to the 2013 {{animated}} film <b>Planes,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> role of Rochelle.

She also starred in the film Enough Said, directed by Nicole Holofcener, which was released on September 18, 2013. This marked her debut as a lead actress in a full-length feature film. The film received rave reviews from movie critics, ranking among the best-reviewed films of 2013. The website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 96% based on 152 reviews, many of them praising Louis-Dreyfus' performance. She received a number of Best Actress nominations for her role in the film at award ceremonies, including the Golden Globe Awards, Satellite Awards, Critics' Choice Movie Awards and the American Comedy Awards.|$|E
25|$|Dudayev {{was killed}} on 21 April 1996, by two laser-guided {{missiles}} when he was using a satellite phone, after his location was detected by a Russian reconnaissance aircraft, which intercepted his phone call. At the time Dudaev was reportedly talking to a liberal deputy of the Duma in Moscow, supposedly Konstantin Borovoy. Additional aircraft were dispatched (a Su-24MR and a Su-25) to locate Dudayev and fire a guided missile. Exact details of this operation were never released by the Russian government. Russian reconnaissance <b>planes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area had been monitoring satellite communications {{for quite some time}} trying to match Dudayev's voice signature to the existing samples of his speech. It was claimed Dudayev was killed by a combination of a rocket attack and a booby trap. He was 52 years old and died six days after his birthday.|$|E
