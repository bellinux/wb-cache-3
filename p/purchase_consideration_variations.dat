40|$|Description of Transaction/Event 1. An entity {{may issue}} its own equity {{instruments}} (e. g. shares) as <b>purchase</b> <b>consideration</b> when acquiring an asset. Paragraph 6. 1 of Accounting Standards AASB 1015 and AAS 21 “Acquisitions of Assets ” requires an acquisition {{to be measured}} at {{the cost to the}} acquiring entity. In determining the cost of acquisition, the Standards require equity instruments issued by the acquirer to be measured at their fair value as at the date of acquisition. 2. Both AASB 1015 and AAS 21 require that, where an entity or operation is acquired, any difference between the cost of acquisition and the aggregate fair value of the identifiable assets acquired (less, where applicable, the aggregate fair value of the identifiable liabilities assumed) must be accounted for in accordance with Accounting Standards AASB 1013 and AAS 18 “Accounting for Goodwill”. 3. The determination of the fair value of equity instruments issued in an acquisition and, therefore, the <b>purchase</b> <b>consideration,</b> has a direct effect on the calculation of any goodwill or discount on acquisition, where an entity or business operation is acquired. 4. Current Accounting Standards and other authoritative pronouncements provide limited guidance on the factors that should be taken into account in determining the fair value of equity instruments which are issued as <b>purchase</b> <b>consideration,</b> particularly those that are not traded in an active and liquid market. 5. Concern has been expressed that, in the absence of authoritative guidance, diverse or unacceptable accounting practices may be applied in determining the fair value of equity instruments issued as <b>purchase</b> <b>consideration</b> (and thus the amount of goodwill or discount on acquisition), and that this will undermine the relevance and reliability of general purpose financial reports...|$|R

Inspired by theories addressing embodied cognition and symbolic meaning portrayal, this paper argues that visual cues inspiring verticality perceptions (i. e., camera angle and advertising background orientation) affect luxury perceptions and, consequently, consumer evaluations and price expectations. Across three experiments, verticality cues fostered perceptions of product luxury but differentially affected price expectations and <b>purchase</b> <b>considerations</b> depending on product type.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a detailed survey designed to explore the factors associated with purchase of private health insurance in England. The survey, a nationally representative survey of the population of England aged 25 to 70, was carried out in the first 4 months of 1987. The achieved sample was 1360 individuals. The survey sought detailed information on both the reasons for health insurance purchase and the reasons for non-purchase by individuals and families. The paper is in two parts. In the first part the survey is analysed in depth. Tables are presented showing the pattern of health insurance across different socio-economic groups and regions of England. These tables are compared to those from the latest General Household Survey (GHS) which asked questions on insurance (the 1983 survey). The large size of the current sample means that the results {{in this part of the}} discussion paper can be treated as a partial up date to the GHS. In addition, the paper examines the motives for self <b>purchase,</b> <b>consideration</b> of <b>purchase</b> and non-purchase of health insurance.

This article documents a basic investigation of the vibration and acoustic behaviors of some PCMS through practical, analytical and numerical approaches, in order to evaluate the possibilities for minimizing, the transmission of noise and vibration.

Observations from this work are therefore expected to contribute towards design inputs to obtain better performances.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{earnings}} management phenomena in Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A) in the UK. The {{intention is to}} provide evidence of the occurrence of earnings management practices prior to {{the completion of the}} deal process among acquiring companies that issue shares as the <b>purchase</b> <b>consideration,</b> compared to those that use cash. In addition, the study examines the performance of the share acquirers against cash acquirers. The existing academic literature relating to,earnings management in US and Australian M&A transactions appears to provide contradictory results. The existing literature for the UK has anaysed the M&A position from a number of perspectives and reported similar results. However, limited research has been carried out for UK M&A from an earnings management perspective. Therefore, this study attempts to bridge the gap by providing evidence of earnings management practice in M&A activities in the UK. By using the accrual model, the results are directly comparable with existing research studies for the US and Australia. The main earnings management detection method used is this study is {{a modified version of the}} Jones model developed by Dechow et al (1995). In addition to this, the study investigates detection of earnings management by looking at 'other' measures and attempts to explain the performance of these companies, using ratio analysis. A control sample that uses cash as the <b>purchase</b> <b>consideration</b> is derived to compare the effect of earnings management with that of the main sample that uses shares. The accounting and market data for each company are obtained from Datastream for the time period of 1999 to 2003. The transaction values and the method of payment are gathered from different sources: National Statistics Bureau, Journal Monthly Acquisition and Hemscott premium websites. The results obtained by using the modified Jones model and 'other' measures highlight a positive and statistically significant difference between the share and cash sample. It indicates that in the years prior to M&A, acquiring firms manage earnings upward. It can be argued therefore that, acquiring firms' use accounting procedures in an attempt to increase their stock price, prior to stock for stock merger or acquisition. In addition, ratio analysis reveals that, firms that offer stock significantly under-perform those offering cash.
