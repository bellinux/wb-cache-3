50|$|<b>Progoitrin</b> is a {{biochemical}} {{from the}} glucosinolate family that {{is found in}} some food, which is inactive but after ingestion is converted to goitrin. Goitrin decrease the thyroid hormone production.|$|E
50|$|Goitrin is a sulfur-containing oxazolidine, a cyclic thiocarbamate, {{that reduces}} the {{production}} of thyroid hormones such as thyroxine. It is found in cruciferous vegetables such as cabbage, brussels sprouts and rapeseed oil, and is formed by the hydrolysis of a glucosinolate: <b>progoitrin</b> or 2-hydroxy-3-butenyl glucosinolate. The unstable isothiocyanate (2-hydroxy-3-butenyl isothiocyanate) derived from the latter glucosinolate spontaneously cyclizes to goitrin, because the hydroxy group is situated in proximity to the isothiocyanate group (allowing a five-membered ring to be formed). Hence, the oxygen in the molecule stems from the hydroxy group of the original unstable isothiocyanate. Plants containing this specific glucosinolate (or glucosinolates such as glucobrassicin and sinalbin which liberate thiocyanate ion) have goitrogenic potential due to the goitrin and thiocyanate they contain. However, they {{do not seem to}} alter thyroid function in humans at realistic amounts in the diet.|$|E
40|$|Glucosinolates (GLSs) are {{abundant}} in cruciferous vegetables and {{reported to have}} anti thyroidal effects. Four GLSs (sinigrin, <b>progoitrin,</b> glucoerucin, and glucotropaeolin) were administered orally to rats, and the breakdown products of GLSs (GLS-BPs: thiocyanate ions, cyanide ions, organic isothiocyanates, organic nitriles, and organic thiocyanates) were measured in serum. Thiocyanate ions were measured by colorimetric method, and cyanide ions were measured with CI-GC-MS. Organic isothiocyanates and their metabolites were measured with the cyclocondensation assay. Organic nitriles and organic thiocyanates were measured with EI-GC-MS. In all treatment groups except for <b>progoitrin,</b> thiocyanate ions were the highest among the five GLS-BPs. In the <b>progoitrin</b> treated group, {{a high concentration of}} organic isothiocyanates (goitrin) was detected. In the glucoerucin treated group, a relatively low amount of goitrogenic substances was observed. The metabolism to thiocyanate ions happened within five hours of the administration, and the distribution of GLSs varied with the side chain. GLSs with side chains that can form stable carbocation seemed to facilitate the degradation reaction and produce a large amount of goitrogenic thiocyanate ions. Because goitrogenic metabolites can be formed without myrosinase, the inactivation of myrosinase during cooking would have no effect on the anti-nutritional effect of GLSs in cruciferous vegetables...|$|E

The chromatography yielded a single peak and a 115. 6 -fold purification. Further FPLC gel filtration gave a single peak at 120 kDa. Denaturing SDS/PAGE of the protein revealed a single band at 60 kDa, {{indicating that the}} native B. brassicae myrosinase is a dimer. Kinetic parameters towards 8 glucosinolates were calculated. Strong differences of V-max and Km were observed depending on the substrate. Degradation products of each glucosinolate were identified and quantified by GC-MS and GLC-FID, respectively. Using both crude aphid homogenates and purified myrosinase, two unique hydroxyglucosinolates, 3 -butenyl- and benzyl-isothiocyanates were identified from <b>progoitrin</b> ((2 S) - 2 -hydroxybut- 3 -enyl-glucosinolate) and sinalbin (4 -hydroxybenzyl-glucosinolate) degradation respectively. Addition of ascorbic acid to the reaction mixtures containing sinalbin and <b>progoitrin</b> caused the production of hydroxyloted degradation products usually associated with plant myrosinase metabolisation.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of three-year (2000 - 2003) experiments to determine the effect of the date of sulfur application (fall + spring or spring only) and the fertilizer rate (0, 30, 60, 90 kg⋅ha- 1) on the usability of winter rape seeds. The pre-sowing and the spring rates of sulfur as well as the rate applied entirely in the spring did not lead to significant variations in crude fat concentrations, but a clear tendency towards an increase in the total protein content was observed in rape seeds. A one-way increase was reported to the level of 60 kg S⋅ha- 1. An increase in the sulfur rate (regardless of the date of application) to 90 kg⋅ha- 1 raised the concentrations of alkene glucosinolates, mainly gluconapin and <b>progoitrin,</b> and – to a les-ser degree – of indole glucosinolates, mainly 4 -hydroxyglucobrassicin, in rape seed cv. Lisek. The splitting of the total sulfur rate into two rates (fall + spring) caused a higher increase in the concentrations of gluconapin, <b>progoitrin</b> and 4 -hydroxyglucobrassicin than a single rate application in the spring...|$|E
40|$|International audienceGlucosinolates (GLSs) are {{of great}} {{interest}} for their potential as antioxidant and anticancer agents. Our aim was to assess in vitro antioxidant activity of cauliflower GLSs and their derivatives, {{as well as to}} evaluate their contribution to the overall antioxidant capacity of cauliflower extracts using four different in vitro assays, 2, 20 -azino-bis-(3 -ethyl-benzothiazoline- 6 -sulphonic acid) radical cation (ABTS-+), 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl assay (DPPH-), oxygen radical absorbance capacity assay (ORAC) and superoxide radical scavenging activity assay (SRSA). The antioxidant activities of GLSs determined using ABTS-+ and DPPH- assays were weak. In contrast, ORAC and SRSA assays showed significant antioxidant activity for GLSs. This activity was particularly important for glucobrassicin, which was the most effective GLS, and for glucoiberin and gluconapin. Mixtures of GLSs did not show either synergy or antagonism in general. Interestingly, the breakdown products, i. e. enzymatic hydrolysis-derived products (EHDP) of GLSs, were far more active than the native GLSs. The highest increases in antioxidant activity were obtained for EHDPs from <b>progoitrin,</b> sinigrin and glucoraphanin; <b>progoitrin</b> EHDP being the second most active derivative behind glucobrassicin EHDP.

40|$|Glucosinolate {{levels in}} leaves were {{determined}} {{in a collection}} of 36 varieties of nabicol (Brassica napus pabularia group) from northwestern Spain grown at two locations. Crude protein, acid detergent fibre, and sensory traits were also assessed by a consumer panel. The objectives were to determine the diversity among varieties in total glucosinolate content and glucosinolate profile and to evaluate their sensory attributes in relation to glucosinolate content for breeding purposes. Eight glucosinolates were identified, being the aliphatic glucosinolates, glucobrassicanapin, <b>progoitrin,</b> and gluconapin the most abundant. Glucosinolate composition varied between locations although the glucosinolate pattern was not significantly influenced. Differences in total glucosinolate content, glucosinolate profile, protein, acid detergent fibre, and flavour were found among varieties. The total glucosinolate content ranged from 1. 4 μmol g− 1 to 41. 0 μmol g− 1 dw at one location and from 1. 2 μmol g− 1 to 7. 6 μmol g− 1 dw at the other location. Sensory analysis comparing bitterness and flavour with variation in glucosinolate, gluconapin, <b>progoitrin,</b> and glucobrassicanapin concentrations suggested that other phytochemicals are probably involved on the characteristic flavour. The variety MBG-BRS 0035 had high total glucosinolate, glucobrassicanapin, and gluconapin contents at both locations and could be included in breeding programs to improve the nutritional value of this vegetable crop.

40|$|The {{glucosinolate}} {{contents of}} two different cultivars of Brassica rapa (Herfstraap and Oleifera) infected with Leptosphaeria maculans and Fusarium oxysporum were determined. Infection triggered the accumulation of aliphatic glucosinolates (gluconapin, <b>progoitrin,</b> glucobrassicanapin and gluconapoleiferin) and indole glucosinolate (4 -hydroxy-glucobrassicin) in Herfstraap and of two indole glucosinolates (glucobrassicin and 4 -hydroxy-glucobrassicin) in Oleifera. While total and aliphatic glucosinolates decreased significantly in Oleifera, a large increase was observed in Herfstraap after fungal infection. The indole glucosinolate glucobrassicin accumulated in Oleifera {{at a higher rate}} than Herfstraap especially after infection with F. oxysporum.

40|$|Objective of {{the study}} was to compare the {{composition}} and nutritional value of a winter brown- (BRC) and three yellow-seeded (YRC) cold-pressed rapeseed cakes as the components of pigs’ diets, and to assess their effects on colonic bacterial fermentation and the relative weight of organs. In experiment 1, the standardised ileal digestibility (SID) of protein and amino acids (AA) of cakes was determined in 12 male cannulated pigs. Each diet was fed to six pigs during three seven-day periods. Ileal digesta was collected during the last three days of the period. In experiment 2, five groups each containing six female pigs with initial body weights (BW) of 20 kg were fed on diets containing BRC, YRC, or soyabean oil meal (SBM) as the main protein source. The apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of nutrients and growth performance were measured untill 60 kg BW was reached, and short chain fatty acids (SCFA) concentrations in the colon, as well as the weight of the liver, kidney, heart, and thyroid, were recorded. The main differences between BRC and YRC were found in higher content of fat and protein, lower amounts of fibre and glucosinolates (Gls), and higher ATTD of fibre in YRC. Protein and AA SID, ATTD of nutrients, total SCFA colonic concentration, and growth performance did not significantly differ. The chemical composition of the three YRC was not uniform, the greatest differences were found among the amounts of Gls. The relative weights of the thyroid and heart were greater in pigs fed BRC than in YRC and SBM diets. Thyroid weight was positively correlated with dietary <b>progoitrin,</b> alkenyl Gls, and total Gls, whereas heart weight was positively correlated with <b>progoitrin</b> and alkenyl Gls. It was concluded that winter yellow-seeded rapeseed is a better raw material for cold-pressing than brown-seeded due to having lower Gls and fibre content. ...|$|E
40|$|Glucosinolates (GSs) were {{analyzed}} in 56 accessions of Brassica rapa {{grown in the}} greenhouse. Eight different glucosinolates were identified in the Brassica rapa group. They are the aliphatic glucosinolates <b>progoitrin</b> (PRO), gluconapin (NAP), glucobrassicanapin (GBN), the indolyl glucosinolates 4 -hydroxyglucobrassicin (4 OH), glucobrassicin (GBC), 4 -methoxyglucobrassicin (4 ME), neoglucobrassicin (NEO) and the aromatic glucosinolate gluconasturtiin (NAS). Gluconapin, glucobrassicanapin, <b>progoitrin</b> and gluconasturtiin are the most abundant GSs in the Brassica rapa, but there is considerable variation in content among accessions. The total glucosinolate contents in Brassica rapa group varied substantially between the different accessions. The highest amount of GSs (361 µmol/ 100 g FW) was observed in leaves of vegetable turnip, followed by rapid cycling and yellow sarson, {{with the amount of}} 200 and 178 µmol/ 100 g FW respectively. Whereas the lowest GSs content was found in turnip greens (20. 8 µmol/ 100 g FW) and Wutacai (22. 6 µmol/ 100 g FW). The total aliphatic GSs proportion varied from 50 to 90 % of the total GS, while generally the content of indolyl glucosinoloates, especially 4 OH glucobrassicin and neoglucobrassicin is low. Gluconasturtiin was found in relatively high concentrations in komastsuna (14. 6 µmol/ 100 g FW), yellow sarson (7. 1 µmol/ 100 g FW) and constitutes as much as 24 % of the total amount of glucosinolates. Relatively high amounts of gluconapin (281 mmol/ 100 g FW) and glucobrassicanapin (60. 0 mmol/ 100 g FW) were observed in the leaves of vegetable turnip. Compared with the Brassica oleracea group, Brassica rapa lacks glucoraphanin and sinigrin but contains gluconapin and glucobrassicanapin. Variations in glucosinolate content among genotypes suggest differences in their health-promoting properties and the opportunity for enhancement of their levels through breeding or genetic modification...|$|E
40|$|Diamondback moth (DBM), Plutella xylostella L., is {{a devastating}} pest of cabbage {{worldwide}} whose feeding attributes {{are influenced by}} glucosinolate profiles of the plant. Identifying the specific glucosinolates associated with plants’ resistance mechanism can provide cues to novel points of intervention in developing resistant cultivars. We studied the DBM larval feeding preference and extent of damage on cabbage leaves via controlled glass-house and in vitro multiple- and two-choice feeding tests. These feeding attributes {{were associated with the}} individual glucosinolate profiles, analyzed by HPLC, of each of the eight cabbage genotypes using multivariate analytical approach to identify the glucosinolates that may have roles in resistance. Both the glass-house and in vitro multiple-choice feeding tests identified the genotype BN 4303, BN 4059, and BN 4072 as the least preferred (resistant) and Rubra, YR Gold and BN 3383 as most preferred (susceptible) genotypes by DBM larvae. The principal component analysis separated the genotypes based on lower feeding scores in association with higher contents of glucobrassicin, glucoiberin, glucoiberverin in one direction and 4 -hydroxyglucobrassicin, glucoerucin, glucoraphanin, and <b>progoitrin</b> in opposite direction in a way to explain the major variation in resistant versus susceptible genotypes based on their extent of preference and leaf area damage. The simultaneous presence (or higher contents) of glucobrassicin, glucoiberin, and glucoiberverin and the absence (or lower contents) of 4 -hydroxyglucobrassicin, glucoerucin, glucoraphanin, and <b>progoitrin</b> in the least preferred genotypes and vice-versa in most preferred genotypes indicated their apparent role as putative repellents and attractants of DBM larvae in cabbage genotypes, respectively. These novel findings add to the current knowledgebase on the roles of glucosinolates in plant–herbivore interactions and will be helpful in setting breeding priorities for improving the resistance against DBM in cabbage using conventional and biotechnological approaches...|$|E
40|$|The {{potential}} of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) for screening the total glucosinolate (t-GSL) content, and also, the aliphatic glucosinolates gluconapin (GNA), glucobrassicanapin (GBN), <b>progoitrin</b> (PRO), glucoalyssin (GAL), and the indole glucosinolate glucobrassicin (GBS) in the leaf rape (Brassica napus L. ssp. pabularia DC), was assessed. This crop is grown for edible leaves for both fodder and human consumption. In Galicia (northwestern Spain) {{it is highly}} appreciated for human nutrition and have the common name of “nabicol”. A collection of 36 local populations of nabicol was analysed by NIRS for glucosinolate composition. The reference values for glucosinolates, as they were obtained by high performance liquid chromatography on the leaf samples, were regressed against different spectral transformations by modified partial least-squares (MPLS) regression. The coefficients of determination in cross-validation (r 2) shown by the equations for t-GSL, GNA, GBN, PRO, GAL and GBS were, respectively, 0. 88, 0. 73, 0. 81, 0. 78, 0. 37 and 0. 41. The standard deviation to standard error of cross-validation ratio, were for these constituents, as follows: t-GSL, 2. 96; GNA, 1. 94; GBN, 2. 31; PRO, 2. 11; GAL, 1. 27, and GBS, 1. 29. These {{results show that the}} equations developed for total glucosinolates, as well as those for gluconapin, glucobrassicanapin and <b>progoitrin,</b> can be used for screening these compounds in the leaves of this species. In addition, the glucoalyssin and glucobrassicin equations obtained, can be used to identify those samples with low and high contents. From the study of the MPLS loadings of the first three terms of the different equations, it can be concluded that some major cell components as protein and cellulose, highly participated in modelling the equations for glucosinolates.

40|$|The {{glucosinolate}} {{profile of}} leaves and seeds of 33 Brassica napus L. crops, including leafy crops, forage, rutabaga, and oilseed crops, was compared by high-performance liquid chromatography to investigate {{the relation between the}} consumable product of each crop and the glucosinolate profile. Glucosinolate concentration was higher in seeds than in leaves, varying from 3. 8 -fold in oilseed crops to 7. 1 -fold in root vegetable crops. Aliphatic glucosinolates predominated in both organs. In seeds, aliphatic glucosinolates represented between 91 % to 94 % in the different groups, whereas in leaves there was more variation. For root vegetable crops, aliphatic glucosinolates represented 80 % of the total glucosinolate concentration. For leafy and forage types, aliphatic glucosinolates represented approximately 90 % and for oilseed crops represented 92 %. Indole glucosinolates were more abundant in leaves (5 % to 17 %) than in seeds (5 % to 8 %). The total glucosinolate content in leaves ranged from 14 to 24 μmol·g− 1 dry weight (DW) in oilseed and forage types, respectively, whereas in the seeds, it ranged from 55 to 115 μmol·g− 1 DW in oilseed and forage types, respectively. Significant differences were noted among the four groups in glucosinolate concentration and glucosinolate composition. In the seeds, <b>progoitrin</b> was found as the main glucosinolate in all groups. In the leaves, two different glucosinolate profiles were found depending on the crop: forage and root vegetable crops showed high levels of <b>progoitrin,</b> whereas glucobrassicanapin was the main glucosinolate for oilseed and leafy crops. We suggest that different selection criteria applied on B. napus crops according to their use could have led to an indirect selection for glucosinolate profile in leaves.

The FTIR fingerprint was recorded for both, desulpho – standards of glucosinolates (sinigrin, gluconapin, <b>progoitrin,</b> glucoiberin, glucoraphanin, glucotropaeolin and glucobrassicin) and intact glucosinolates (sinigrin and glucotropaeolin). The extraction of glucosinolates was made according to the EU official method (EEC Regulation N. 1864 / 90). The FTIR spectra for standards and Brassica dried extracts were recorded in the MIR region, from 4000 and 900 cm- 1. The results obtained show that HATR/FT-MIR spectroscopy {{can be used as}} a fast method for the quantification of total glucosinolates considering the IR absorption at 800 cm- 1 or the region area of 750 - 900 cm- 1, is the most suitable. The HATR/FT-MIR is non-destructive, cheap and fast method to fingerprint, to predict and to quantify the glucosinolate composition of Brassica vegetables...|$|E

They {{are characterized by}} a particular sulfurous aroma, pungent flavor, and a bitter taste. In this work twelve local varieties grown as turnip greens and turnip tops were evaluated to define the sensory attributes, to relate them with secondary metabolites, and to select those sensorial traits that better describe these crops. Results showed differences in the sensory profiles of B. rapa varieties. Turnip greens were significantly differed for aroma intensity, leaf color, and salty taste, while turnip tops were for color and firmness of leaves, moistness and fibrosity in mouth, sharpness, and bitter taste. Secondary metabolites as glucosinolates in turnip greens and phenolic compounds in turnip tops were highly correlated with texture and flavor. Glucosinolates especially <b>progoitrin</b> (in turnip greens) and gluconapin (in turnip tops) showed correlation with bitter taste and aftertaste persistence. Correlation between sensory traits showed highest values between leaf firmness and stalk firmness (0. 94 **), leaf firmness and fibrosity (R= 0. 92 **), aftertaste persistence and bitterness (R= 0. 91 **) and between bitterness and moistness (R=- 0. 89 **).

In this view, the effect of some glucosinolates and their isothiocyanate (ITC) derived products on in vitro cell growth was studied. We report the isolation and characterization of ITCs derived from glucosinolates by using HPLC, GC-MS and NMR techniques. The in vitro activity of ITCs on human erythroleukemic K 562 cells have been investigated by using two alternative approaches, namely the in situ and pre-mix methods. No differences in antiproliferative activity were found comparing the effect of ITCs produced either by in situ or pre-mix method. In the experimental conditions used, the production of ITCs from glucosinolates is almost quantitative as confirmed by HPLC or GC-MS analysis. The ITCs inhibitory activity on K 562 cells growth is particularly evident {{in the cases of}} ITCs derived from sinigrin, <b>progoitrin,</b> epi-progoitrin, glucotropaeolin and glucocheirolin. Finally, the antiproliferative activity of the ITCs obtained from glucoraphenin, taken as an example, was determined on other tumor cell lines with different origin and hystotype. Considering the antiproliferative activity found for ITCs, these compounds could be considered potentially responsible for the reduction of colorectal cancer associated to dietes rich in cruciferous vegetables. Further studies will be aimed to the possible application of glucosinolate derived products as chemopreventive cancer agents...|$|E

Pekinensis). MYB 28 and MYB 29 expression in the stem was dramatically different {{when compared with the}} levels in the other organs. MYB 34, MYB 122, MYB 51, Dof 1. 1, and IQD 1 - 1 showed very low transcript levels among different organs. HPLC analysis showed that the glucosinolates (GSLs) consisted of five aliphatic GSLs (<b>progoitrin,</b> sinigrin, glucoalyssin, gluconapin, and glucobrassicanapin) and four indolic GSLs (4 -hydroxyglucobrassicin, glucobrassicin, 4 -methoxygluco-brassicin, and neoglucobrassicin). Aliphatic GSLs exhibited 63. 3 % of the total GSLs content, followed by aromatic GSL (19. 0 %), indolic GSLs (10 %), and unknown GSLs (7. 7 %) in different organs of Chinese cabbage. The total GSL content of different parts (ranked in descending order) was as follows: seed > flower > young leaves > stem > root > old leaves. The relationship between GSLs accumulation and expression of GSLs biosynthesis MYB TFs genes in different organs may be helpful to understand the mechanism of MYB TFs regulating GSL biosynthesis in Chinese cabbage...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of stages of development, soil types, dates of seeding, cultivars, and boron nutrition on glucosinolate composition and variation in rutabaga (Brassica napobrassica Mill.) and turnip (B, rapa L.) cultivars was studied by quantifying the glucosinolate hydrolysis products in these species. While in seeds of both species contents of goitrin and volatile isothiocyanates were inversely correlated, {{there was little}} variation in thiocyanate ion and total glucosinolate contents. Major synthesis or accumulation of different glucosinolates occurred at different times {{during the growing season}} in the sequence after seeding: indolyl glucosinolates yielding thiocyanate ion at the 2 -week stage; glucosinolates yielding volatile isothiocyanate hydrolysis products at the 4 -week stage; and <b>progoitrin</b> yielding goitrin at the 6 - or 8 -week stage. These glucosinolates were generally higher in roots of both species grown on organic soil than on loam soil. During ontogeny of both species, the content of volatile isothiocyanates generally were positively correlated with top/root ratio, while growth rate was positively correlated with thiocyanate ion content. While the contents of goitrin and volatile isothiocyanate tended to be higher in early-seeded (May 27) crops, the thiocyanate ion contents tended to be higher in late-seeded (June 21) crops. The occurrence of boron deficiency symptoms in roots of hydroponically-grown Snow Ball turnip (0. 1 ppm boron treatment) was associated with an accumulation of high quantities of glucosinolates and reducing sugars...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{present study}} aimed to {{investigate}} the contents of glucosinolates (GSLs) and carotenoids in eleven varieties of Chinese cabbage {{in relation to the}} expression level of the important transcription factors. MS and HPLC analysis identified the presence of 13 GSLs (<b>progoitrin,</b> sinigrin, glucoalyssin, gluconapoleiferin, gluconapin, glucocochlearin, glucobrassicanapin, glucoerucin, 4 -hydroxyglucobrassicin, glucobrassicin, 4 -methoxyglucobrassicin, neoglucobrassicin and gluconasturtiin) and four carotenoids (lutein, zeaxanthin, α-carotene and β-carotene). GSL contents were varied among the different cabbage varieties. The total GSL content ranged from 2. 7 to 57. 88 μmol/gDW. The proportion of gluconapin (54 %) and glucobrassicanapin (22 %) was higher in all the varieties, respectively. Results documented the variation in total and individual carotenoid contents that have also been observed among different varieties; however, the total carotenoid contents ranged from 289. 12 to 1001. 41 mgkg− 1 DW (mean 467. 66). Interestingly, the proportion of lutein (66. 5) and β-carotene (25. 9) were higher than α-carotene (5. 1) and zeaxanthin (2. 5 %). Consequently, the expression level of the regulatory gene, MYB 28 was higher in ‘K 0648 ’ and was directly proportional to GSL content. Similarly, the expression levels of 1 -PSY were higher in ‘K 0112 ’; however, the expression levels of 2 -ZDS, 3 -LCYB, 4 -LCYE, 5 -CHXB and 7 -NCED genes showed no significant difference. In addition, the correlation between GSL and carotenoid contents and gene expression level showed moderate significant difference in each Chinese cabbage...|$|E
40|$|A micellar {{electrokinetic}} capillary chromatography (MECC) {{method has}} been developed for monitoring the myrosinase catalysed hydrolysis of 2 -hydroxy substituted glucosinolates and the simultaneous formation of the corresponding degradation products (oxazolidine- 2 -thiones (OZTs) and nitriles). Glucosibarin ((2 R) - 2 -hydroxy- 2 -phenylethylglucosinolate) {{was chosen as the}} model glucosinolate owing to the difficulties in determining hydrolysis rates of this type of substrates in traditional UV-assays. The method was afterwards validated with glucobarbarin ((2 S) - 2 -hydroxy- 2 -phenylethylglucosinolate) and <b>progoitrin</b> ((2 R) - 2 -hydroxybut- 3 -enylglucosinolate). Aromatic glucosinolates without a 2 -hydroxy group in their side chains, such as glucotropaeolin (benzylglucosinolate) and gluconasturtiin (phenethylglucosinolate) were also tested. Formation of the glucosinolate hydrolysis products was monitored simultaneously at 206 nm and 230 nm. This allowed estimation of the extinction coefficient of the OZT derived from glucosibarin, which was found to be 18, 000 M− 1 cm− 1 and 12, 000 M− 1 cm− 1 at 206 nm and 230 nm, respectively. The developed method has limit of detection of 0. 04 mM and 0. 06 mM and limit of quantification of 0. 2 mM and 0. 3 mM for the glucosibarin derived OZT and nitrile, respectively. Linearity of the glucosinolate concentration was examined at six concentration levels from 2. 5 mMto 100 mMand at 206 nm a straight line (R 2 = 0. 9996) was obtained. The number of theoretical plates (N) at the optimal system conditions was 245, 000 for the intact glucosibarin, 264, 000 for the OZT and 252, 000 for the nitrile...|$|E
40|$|Natural {{populations of}} wild cabbage (Brassica oleracea) show {{significant}} qualitative diversity in heritable aliphatic glucosinolates, {{a class of}} secondary metabolites involved in defence against herbivore attack. One candidate mechanism {{for the maintenance of}} this diversity is that differential responses among herbivore species result in a net fitness balance across plant chemotypes. Such top-down differential selection would be promoted by consistent responses of herbivores to glucosinolates, temporal variation in herbivore abundance, and fitness impacts of herbivore attack on plants varying in glucosinolate profile. A 1 -year survey across 12 wild cabbage populations demonstrated differential responses of herbivores to glucosinolates. We extended this survey to investigate the temporal consistency of these responses, and the extent of variation in abundance of key herbivores. Within plant populations, the aphid Brevicoryne brassicae consistently preferred plants producing the glucosinolate <b>progoitrin.</b> Among populations, increasing frequencies of sinigrin production correlated positively with herbivory by whitefly Aleyrodes proletella and negatively with herbivory by snails. Two Pieris butterfly species showed no consistent response to glucosinolates among years. Rates of herbivory varied significantly among years within populations, but the frequency of herbivory at the population scale varied only for B. brassicae. B. brassicae emerges as a strong candidate herbivore to impose differential selection on glucosinolates, as it satisfies the key assumptions of consistent preferences and heterogeneity in abundance. We show that variation in plant secondary metabolites structures the local herbivore community and that, for some key species, this structuring is consistent over time. We discuss the implications of these patterns for the maintenance of diversity in plant defence chemistr...|$|E
40|$|Brassica {{vegetables}} are the predominant dietary source of glucosinolates (GLS) {{that can be}} degraded in the intestinal tract into isothiocyanates, which {{have been shown to}} possess anticarcinogenic properties. The effects of pilot-scale long-term boiling on GLS in white cabbage (Brassica oleracea L. ssp. capitata f. alba cv. `Bartolo¿) was experimentally determined and mathematically modeled. Cabbage was boiled, resulting in a dramatic decrease of 56 % in the total GLS levels within the plant matrix during the first 2 min. After 8 ¿ 12 min of boiling, the decrease progressed to over 70 %. <b>Progoitrin</b> had an exceptionally higher decline rate in comparison to all other GLS. As boiling progressed the concentration of all GLS continued to decrease at a lower rate for the remaining cooking period. A mathematical model was used to describe the concentration profile of the GLS in the plant matrix, based on leaching of GLS to the water phase due to cell lysis and thermal degradation of the GLS both in the plant matrix and in the water phase. The model described the concentration profiles very well. Estimated lysis and degradation rate constants for white cabbage differed from those reported in the literature for red cabbage. The degradation rate constants found were significantly higher in the plant matrix when compared to those in the water phase for all GLS. Identification of the kinetics of decline of GLS during cooking can aid in designing processing and preparation methods and determining the conditions for the optimal effects of ingestion of Brassicaceae toward cancer prevention...|$|E
40|$|During {{the period}} 1985 - 1986 a study {{was done on}} request by the European Commission to select methods for the {{determination}} of glucosinolates (GSL) in rapeseed with low GSL content (" 00 "-rapeseed). Several methods have been studied. The ISO 5504 did not determine the indolyl GSL {{which is one of}} the disadvantages of this procedure. Other methods for the determination of individual GSL in rapeseed have also been examined, methods which include the indolyls and have not the disadvantages of molecular shifts which occur after hydrolysis with the myrosinase enzyme. The different methods were compared with each other and with methods which determine the total GSL content like palladium test or glucose determinations. Finally we concluded that the HPLC separation of desulfated GSL offers a reliable method for the control of rapeseed varietles on the content of the different GSL. However for analysing Brassica seed residues intended for animal feed this method is less suitable since it only determines the intact glucosinolates in the seed. The calculation of the HPLC results needs calibration factors being the reelprocal value of the molar extinction coefficients in the ultraviolet range. These molar extinction coefficients have been determined by comparing the results with gaschromatography. For the indolyl-GSL a calibration factor relative to the internal standard sinigrin is ëstablished of 0. 21 at 226 nm and for <b>progoitrin</b> of 1. 37.

40|$|The {{nutrient}} profile of rapeseed (RS) {{makes it an}} ideal ingredient for high nutrient dense diets. Due to intensive breeding the content of glucosinolates in RS has been decreased (“ 00 ” varieties) and RS can be used at dietary doses up to 150 g/kg with-out any negative effect on egg production (Jeroch et al., 1999). But many factors affect the occurrence of fishy taint in “brown-shelled ” eggs (Butler and Fenwick, 1984). The taint {{is due to the}} presence of trimethylamine in the yolks of hens with impaired ability to convert trimethylamine to the odourless and tasteless N-oxide. The deficiency of the enzyme oxidase is not strictly linked to shell colour as Butler (Butler and Fenwick, 1984) revealed. Roth-Maier and Kirchgessner (1995) found that 250 g/kg RS did not affect the quality (flavour and odour) of eggs of Lohmann White – LSL. The presence of sinapine in RS or rapeseed meal is a source of trimethylamine. Goitrin (5 -vinyl-ox-azolidine- 2 -thione), a breakdown product of the glucosinolate <b>progoitrin,</b> also {{plays an important role in}} the production of egg taint because it in-hibits trimethylamine oxidase (Butler and Fenwick, 1984) responsible for trimethylamine oxidation. Thiocyanates are also breakdown products of glu-cosinolates, but their negative effects can be re-duced by the addition of extra iodine (McDowell, 1992).

This study evaluated the seed yield and active compounds of I. indigotica Fortune (Chinese woad) with the aim to investigate its intra-species chemotypic, phenotypic and productive variations. A field experiment {{was carried out in}} Central Italy under Mediterranean climate, comparing four I. indigotica accessions. The plant phenologi- cal, morphological and productive characteristics (siliculas and seed yields) have been evaluated and the seeds analysed for fatty acid composition and glucosinolate patterns. The four accessions, grown as win- ter annual crop, showed similar phenological development but a different percentage of plants that turn to flower. All the genotypes showed good adaptability to the environmental conditions and good agro- nomical performances, with good siliculas yield (1. 36 ± 0. 08 t ha− 1) and oil content (36. 8 ± 0. 82 % w/w). Significant differences among the accessions were observed for the fatty acid and glucosinolate profiles. The oil was rich in mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acid (58 % and 32 % as mean value, respectively) with major differences for the oleic and -linolenic acids.

40|$|Glucosinolate {{levels in}} leaves were {{determined}} {{in a collection}} of 113 varieties of turnip greens (Brassica rapa L.) from northwestern Spain grown at two sites. Sensorial attributes were also assessed by a consumer panel. The objectives were to determine the diversity among varieties in total glucosinolate content and glucosinolate profile and to evaluate their sensory attributes in relation to glucosinolate content for breeding purposes. Sixteen glucosinolates were identified, being the aliphatic glucosinolates, gluconapin and glucobrassicanapin the most abundant. Other aliphatic glucosinolates, such as <b>progoitrin,</b> glucoalyssin, and gluconapoleiferin were relatively abundant in varieties with a different glucosinolate profile. Indolic and aromatic glucosinolate concentrations were low and showed few differences among varieties. Differences in total glucosinolate content, glucosinolate profile and bitterness were found among varieties, with a total glucosinolate content ranging from 11. 8 to 74. 0 μmol g− 1 dw at one site and from 7. 5 to 56. 9 μmol g− 1 dw at the other site. Sensory analysis comparing bitterness with variation in glucosinolate, gluconapin and glucobrassicanapin concentrations suggested that these compounds and their breakdown products are not the only determinants of the characteristic flavour of this vegetable. Other phytochemicals are probably involved on the characteristic bitter flavour. The varieties MBG-BRS 0132, MBG-BRS 0082, MBG-BRS 0173, and MBG-BRS 0184 could be good candidates for future breeding programs since they had high total glucosinolate content and good agronomic performance. The presence of glucoraphanin in some varieties should be studied more extensively, because this aliphatic glucosinolate is the precursor of sulforaphane, a potent anti-cancer isothiocyanate.
