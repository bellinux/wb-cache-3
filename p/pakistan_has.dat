5|$|Dermotherium is a genus {{of fossil}} mammals {{closely related to}} the living colugos, a small group of gliding mammals from Southeast Asia. Two species are recognized: D.major from the Late Eocene of Thailand, based on a single {{fragment}} of the lower jaw, and D.chimaera from the Late Oligocene of Thailand, known from three fragments of the lower jaw and two isolated upper molars. In addition, a single isolated upper molar from the Early Oligocene of <b>Pakistan</b> <b>has</b> been tentatively assigned to D.chimaera. All sites where fossils of Dermotherium have been found probably developed in forested environments and the fossil species probably were forest dwellers like living colugos, but whether they already had the gliding adaptations of the living species is unknown.|$|E

5|$|Dzungariotherium orgosensis was {{described}} in 1973 based on fossilsmainly teethfrom Dzungaria in Xinjiang, northwest China. In 2017, a new species, P. huangheense, was named based on jaw elements from the Hanjiajing Formation in the Gansu Province of China; the name refers to the nearby Huanghe River. P. huangheense differs from P. bugtiense only in the anatomy of the rear portion of the jaw, {{as well as its}} larger size. A multitude of other species and genus namesmostly based on differences in size, snout shape, and front tooth arrangementhave been coined for various indricothere remains.

5|$|According to the UK Government review, the Burns Inquiry (published in 2000), hare {{coursing}} {{was taking place}} in Pakistan, Portugal and Spain. <b>Pakistan</b> <b>has</b> officially prohibited the use of dogs or hawks for coursing unless a special licence is issued for carrying out such activity although, according to some reports, {{hare coursing}} is still practised and popular. Hare coursing in Portugal is run in both forms: open (Prova de Galgos a Campo), and closed (park) coursing where it is known as lebre a corricão. Hare coursing in Portugal may only be legally undertaken with two dogs and operates under the same ethos as coursing in the United States. In Spain, the hare coursing is open coursing, and the areas where the activity takes place includes the Medinrua area. Coursing has long been undertaken in Spain, where Spanish galgos rather than greyhounds are used. These dogs have a precarious life after their coursing careers, with World Animal Protection suggesting that many tens of thousands die cruelly each year. Hare coursing also takes place in Russia but is illegal in most European countries and in Australia, where it {{had a long history}} from 1867 until it was banned in 1985 following a long decline in popularity.|$|E
