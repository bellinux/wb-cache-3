In 1997, an article was published which presented an extensive analysis of the genus Spindalis.

Four distinct species were identified—Spindalis dominicensis, Spindalis nigricephala, Spindalis portoricensis and Spindalis zena. S. zena was also subdivided into five subspecies: S. z. pretrei, S. z. salvini, S. z. benedicti, S. z. townsendi and S. z. zena. Specifically, the difference in vocalization, and morphology, distinguish S. portoricensis from S. dominicensis.|$|E

The simplest version, the Boolean model, places a random compact object at each {{point of a}} Poisson point process. More complex versions allow interactions based in various ways on the geometry of objects.

Abrupt changes in the dynamics typically result in clearly visible differences between the distributions before and after the break. Recurring dynamical regimes can be discovered by classifying the distributions {{in different parts of the}} time series. This paper discusses two algorithms which exploit the relation between ordinal <b>pattern</b> <b>distributions</b> and system dynamics for the segmentation and classification of time series. The first algorithm employs a kernel-based statistic, the Maximum Mean Discrepancy of ordinal <b>pattern</b> <b>distributions,</b> to detect and locate change points in the time series. The second algorithm uses clustering of the ordinal <b>pattern</b> <b>distributions</b> to classify time series segments with similar dynamics.

40|$|Abstract—Noise {{models are}} crucial for {{designing}} image restoration algorithms, generating synthetic training data, and predicting algorithm performance. There are two related but distinct estimation scenarios. The first is model calibration, {{where it is}} assumed that the input ideal bitmap and the output of the degradation process are both known. The second is the general estimation problem, where only the image from the output of the degradation process is given. While researchers have addressed the problem of calibration of models, issues with the general estimation problems have not been addressed in the literature. In this paper, we describe a parameter estimation algorithm for a morphological, binary, page-level image degradation model. The inputs to the estimation algorithm are 1) the degraded image and 2) information regarding the font type (italic, bold, serif, sans serif). We simulate degraded images using our model and search for the optimal parameter by looking for a parameter value for which the local neighborhood <b>pattern</b> <b>distributions</b> in the simulated image and the given degraded image are most similar. The parameter space is searched using a direct search optimization algorithm. We use the p-value of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test as the measure of similarity between the two neighborhood <b>pattern</b> <b>distributions.</b> We show results of our algorithm on degraded document images.
