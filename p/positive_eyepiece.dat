40|$|In {{the late}} 1620 s the Neapolitan {{telescope}} maker Francesco Fontana {{was the first}} to observe the sky using a telescope with two convex lenses, which he had manufactured himself. Fontana succeeded in drawing the most accurate maps of the Moon's surface of his time, which were to become popular through a number of publications spread all over Europe but without acknowledging the author. At the end of 1645, in a state of declining health and pressed by the need to defend his authorship, Fontana carried out an intense observational campaign, whose results he hurriedly collected in his Novae Coelestium Terrestriumque rerum Observationis (1646), the only book he left to posterity. Fontana observed the Moon's main craters, as the crater Tycho which he named Fons Major, their radial patterns and the change in their positions due to the Moon's motions. He observed the gibbosity of Mars at quadrature and, together with the Jesuit G. B. Zupus, he described the phases of Mercury. Fontana observed the two - and occasionally three - major bands of Jupiter, and inferred the rotation movement of the major planets Mars, Jupiter and Saturn, arguing that they could not be attached to an Aristotelian sky. He came close to revealing the ring structure of Saturn. He also suggested the presence of additional moons around Jupiter, Venus and Saturn, which prompted a debate that lasted more than a hundred years. In several places of his book Fontana repeatedly claimed to have conceived the first <b>positive</b> <b>eyepiece</b> in 1608, providing a declaration by Zupus to have used his telescope since 1614. This declaration is still the oldest record mentioning such a device. We finally suggest that the telescopes depicted in the two Allegory of Sight by J. Brueghel the Elder belonging to Albert VII might have been made by Fontana, and that he might have inspired the Sight by Jusepe Ribera (c. 1616).

40|$|AIMS—To {{compare the}} proliferative {{activity}} of intraepithelial melanocytes in primary acquired melanosis (PAM) without atypia and PAM with atypia by immunohistochemical staining for the Ki- 67 antigen and the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA).  METHODS—Formalin fixed, paraffin embedded sections from 35  archival specimens of PAM without atypia (n= 19) and with atypia (n= 16) were studied by immunostaining with MIB- 1 and PC- 10 monoclonal antibodies that react with the Ki- 67 antigen and PCNA respectively. The results were calculated as {{the mean number}} of <b>positive</b> cells per <b>eyepiece</b> grid. All specimens were evaluated by two masked observers, and the interobserver reproducibility was assessed.  RESULTS—The means of the positive cell count in PAM with atypia were significantly higher compared with PAM without atypia for both observers, in both the PC- 10 and the MIB- 1 stained sections. In a linear least square model that estimated the interobserver and between group variation, the difference of MIB- 1 and PC- 10 positive cell count between PAM without and with atypia remained highly significant. The difference between the observers was not significant.  CONCLUSIONS—Immunostaining with MIB- 1 and PC- 10 demonstrated that PAM with atypia has higher proliferative activity than PAM without atypia. This method was found to be reproducible between different observers.    Keywords: primary acquired melanosis; immunostaining; atypi...|$|R
