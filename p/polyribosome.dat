40|$|Antibiotics {{were used}} as probes of {{ribosome}} topology and function. Studies of [14 C]chloramphenicol and [14 C]erythromycin binding to ribosomes and <b>polyribosomes</b> revealed the following features. The requirement of high K+ concentration (150 mM) for [14 C]chloramphenicol binding to NH 4 Cl-washed ribosomes resulted from the washing procedure. Neither native 70 S ribosomes nor <b>polyribosomes</b> require K+ greater than 30 mM for [14 C]chloramphenicol binding. Whereas [14 C]chloramphenicol binds to both ribosomes and <b>polyribosomes,</b> [14 C]erythromycin binds essentially only to ribosomes. After removal of peptidyl-transfer ribonucleic acid (tRNA) from <b>polyribosomes,</b> [14 C]erythromycin could then be bound. The effects {{of a number of}} antibiotics on [14 C]chloramphenicol binding to ribosomes and <b>polyribosomes</b> was assessed. It was found that most of the macrolides (erythromycin, carbomycin, spiramycin III, niddamycin, oleandomycin, and tylosin) and streptogramins A and B (vernamycin A, PA 114 A, vernamycin Bα, and PA 114 B) inhibited chloramphenicol binding to NH 4 Cl-washed and native 70 S ribosomes, but not to <b>polyribosomes.</b> After removal of peptidyl-tRNA from <b>polyribosomes,</b> [14 C]chloramphenicol binding was then inhibited. In contrast, sparsomycin and althiomycin inhibited chloram-phenicol binding to <b>polyribosomes,</b> but not to ribosomes. After removal of peptidyl-tRNA from <b>polyribosomes,</b> sparsomycin and althiomycin were then ineffective. The presence of peptidyl-tRNA on <b>polyribosomes</b> apparently is required for binding of sparsomycin and althiomycin, but prevents binding of most macrolides and streptogramins. The lincosaminides (lincomycin and celesticetin) and methymycin (a small macrolide) inhibited [14 C]chloramphenicol binding to NH 4 Cl-washed and native 70 S ribosomes best, but also inhibited the binding to <b>polyribosomes.</b> The amino nucleosides and other antibiotics tested do not seem to interact strongly with the major chloramphenicol-binding site.

(1) Rough endoplasmic reticulum, from which ribosomes had been removed by treatment with pyrophosphate and citrate, bound over 50 % of added <b>polyribosomes,</b> whereas the untreated (or control) rough and smooth endoplasmic reticulum and the smooth endoplasmic reticulum treated with pyrophosphate–citrate did not bind <b>polyribosomes.</b> (2) The polyribosome-binding capacity of rough endoplasmic reticulum stripped of its ribosomes decayed upon storage of the membranes at 0 – 4 °C.

When transferred to a defined medium lacking cytokinin, very little cell division or cell enlargement took place {{over the course of}} a 6 -day culture period. Cells transferred to medium of the same composition, but containing 0. 5 μm zeatin, exhibited rapid initial growth, with maximum mitotic activity occurring after 24 hours in culture, and a doubling of the cell population within the first 36 hours of the culture period. The polyribosomal RNA content of the cells decreased over the course of the first 24 hours of the growth cycle while the <b>polyribosome</b> to monoribosome (P/M) ratio increased. The increase in the P/M ratio was greater in the cytokinin-treated cells. This apparent relationship between cytokinin-induced cell proliferation and <b>polyribosome</b> formation was examined further. <b>Polyribosome</b> formation was stimulated when zeatin was added directly to cell populations which had been cultured for 24 hours in medium lacking a cytokinin. Transfer to fresh medium alone also stimulated <b>polyribosome</b> formation, whether this medium contained a cytokinin or not. The magnitude of transfer-induced <b>polyribosome</b> formation depended upon the initial cell density (number of cells/ml of medium). Regardless of the initial cell density and independent of the P/M ratios attained, the cytokinin-treated cell populations divided while the cytokinin-deprived cell populations did not. In vivo labeling with [35 S]methionine and slab gel electrophoretic separation of sodium dodecyl sulfate derivatives of the labeled polypeptides demonstrated qualitative changes in the spectrum of proteins synthesized by the cytokinin-treated cells.

Using these techniques, messenger RNA species bearing up to 12 ribosomes (dodecamers) were resolved, with messenger RNA chains bearing 9 ribosomes (nonamers) being the most abundant (having the highest absorption peak). The data presented suggest that buffer of high ionic strength and high pH was more effective in preventing degradation of <b>polyribosomes</b> than was diethyl pyrocarbonate and, furthermore, that ratios involving large <b>polyribosomes</b> (hexamers and larger) were more accurate indices of degradation than were ratios involving total <b>polyribosomes...</b>|$|R

Large ribosomal subunits required a more prolonged mixing schedule to achieve saturation of membranes than did polyribosomes. 2. By using a procedure which minimized the effects on binidng by the stoicheiometric variables, competition between populations of polyribosomes, ribosomes and subunits for membrane sites showed that subunits, {{and to a lesser extent}} ribosomes, failed to block <b>polyribosome</b> attachment. 3.

The free <b>polyribosome</b> and the microsome-mitochondria fractions constituted active centers for protein synthesis. It was shown that nascent protein of the free <b>polyribosome</b> fractions was not associated significantly with the contaminating membranes. The kinetics of labeling during incorporation times up to 11 min suggested that protein synthesized on the free polyribosomes was rapidly transferred in vivo to the soluble fraction of the cell, while protein synthesized by the microsomes and mitochondria remained localized within these elements.

40|$|<b>Polyribosomes</b> {{containing}} nascent [3 H]proline-labeled collagen chains {{were isolated}} from chick embryo fibroblasts in culture. These nascent chains were nearly completely hydroxylated, {{as indicated by}} the presence of [3 H]hydroxyproline and high hydroxyproline/proline ratios. The <b>polyribosomes</b> were suspended in D 2 O at 15 degrees and the infrared spectrum was determined using a reference cell containing collagen-depleted <b>polyribosomes</b> in D 2 O, matched to equal RNA content. The amide I and amide II bands were observed. When the <b>polyribosomes</b> were heated in D 2 O at 44 degrees in the infrared cells, the N [...] D amide II absorbance at 1480 cm- 1 increased markedly, indicating that H leads to D exchange had occurred. Collagen-depleted <b>polyribosomes</b> showed no such changes in absorbance at 1450 - 1480 cm- 1 upon heating. <b>Polyribosomes</b> recovered from the infrared cells after treatment at 44 degrees and cooling still contained collagen, {{as indicated by the}}ir [3 H]hydroxyproline content. These data indicate that nascent collagen bound to the <b>polyribosomes</b> can assume a hydrogen-bonded structure. Taken with prior data showing that the nascent collagen was also resistant to pepsin digestion, it is suggested that the collagen examined is in triple-helix conformation. Because the nascent polyribosome-bound collagen is nearly fully hydroxylated, it must be considered that triple-helix formation can occur between nascent chains while they are attached to the endoplasmic reticulum surface and that chain association and triple-helix formation in vivo may well occur before rather than after release...|$|R
