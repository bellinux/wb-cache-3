40|$|The paper {{examines}} the influence <b>of</b> the real <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>beer</b> on violence-related injuries across the economic regions in England and Wales. The data are monthly frequency of violent-injury collected from a stratified sample of 58 National Health Service Emergency Departments 1995 - 2000. An econometric model based on economic, socio-demographic {{and environmental factors}} was estimated using panel techniques. It is shown {{that the rate of}} violence-related injury is negatively related to the real <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>beer,</b> as well as economic, sporting and socio-demographic factors. The principal conclusion of the paper is that the regional distribution of the incidence of violent injury is related to the regional distribution <b>of</b> the <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>beer.</b> The major policy conclusion is that increased alcohol prices would result in substantially fewer violent injuries and reduced demand on trauma services. ...|$|R

Using an, as yet, untapped data source, regression analysis indicates that a substantial proportion {{of the variance in}} the inter-state <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>beer</b> can be explained by demand pressure, transportation costs, and the <b>price</b> <b>of</b> substitutes, as well as taxes and the presence of legally-mandated exclusive territories governing the wholesale distribution <b>of</b> <b>beer.</b> ...|$|R

However, nationwide sports events were associated only with male assault injury. Violence-related harm was significantly and independently linked to other socio-economic and demographic factors. Our {{results suggest that the}} real <b>price</b> <b>of</b> alcohol (using <b>beer</b> as an example) has a part to play in controlling the consumption of alcohol and the incidence of violent injury.

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{in applied}} mathematics is {{an analysis of}} which factors affect the <b>pricing</b> <b>of</b> <b>beer</b> at the Swedish market. A multiple linear regression model is created with the statistical programming language R through {{a study of the}} influences for several explanatory variables. For example these variables include country <b>of</b> origin, <b>beer</b> style, volume sold and a Bayesian weighted mean rating from RateBeer, a popular website for beer enthusiasts. The main goal of the project is to find significant factors and, as follows directly, a significant model without any influence of multicollinearity. The regression analysis is based on a data set with 1413 observations which represent beers that sold over 1000 liters, among further restrictions, and is created from Systembolaget's sale statistics for 2016 and Ratebeer. This number of observations represents 43 % of Systembolaget's total assortment <b>of</b> <b>beer.</b> The model is developed through a thorough residual analysis, transformations of variables, determination of multicollinearity and a validation of the absence of outliers and high leverage points. All of these in favor for significance at a level of 95 %. In addition to the regression model, two submodels with associated box plots for the variable groups Country <b>of</b> Origin and <b>Beer</b> Style are created for analyzing the importance of these variables amongst each other. A k-fold cross validation study and three different variable selections are carried out for further adequacy checking, these are also given as recommendations for continued analysis. The result shows that there are several different factors that affect the <b>pricing</b> <b>of</b> <b>beer.</b> For example, higher alcohol by volume, sour beers and beers from New Zealand yields a higher price while beers with high sales, lagers and Austrian beers show a negative tendency for the price. The result can be used {{as an example of the}} influences behind the <b>pricing</b> <b>of</b> <b>beer</b> in Sweden. The first model in the analysis has 41 explanatory variables and in the final model the number of explanatory variables is reduced to 20 where all are significant...|$|R

30|$|Given the {{importance}} <b>of</b> <b>beer</b> style variety to consumers <b>of</b> <b>beer,</b> an understanding <b>of</b> {{the impact on}} demand of the various characteristics <b>of</b> <b>beer</b> is essential to breweries and retailers. To date, however, the economics literature includes relatively little research using hedonic methods to evaluate beer pricing. 4 For example, in an unpublished study, Schamel (2009) uses a hedonic model to explain variations in beer prices (per pint) across major cities around the world using attributes and demographics of the city. 5 More recently, Empen and Hamilton (2015) estimate the effect of games played during the German Bundesliga (soccer) season on the <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>beer.</b> Neither <b>of</b> these studies, however, shines any substantial light on {{the importance}} <b>of</b> various <b>beer</b> characteristics on the <b>prices</b> <b>of</b> domestic and foreign beers.|$|R

Understanding factors that influence the <b>price</b> <b>of</b> a particular commodity like beer provides important insights into price determination and the strategic interaction among firms.

50|$|Critics say TBS {{constitutes}} a foreign-owned monopoly over retail beer sales in Ontario, costing the consumer {{more in the}} long run in terms <b>of</b> convenience and <b>price.</b> Critics also state that if retail beer sales were opened up, then the average price to the consumer would drop due to competition within the marketplace. TBS has argued that the <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>beer</b> will increase if privatization occurs and points to the situations of BC and Alberta as prime examples. In an independent report titled “Alcohol Retailing Deregulation: Implications for Ontario” by economist Greg Flanagan, it was demonstrated that the general consequence of deregulating the sale of alcohol is an increase in average sale price. Since Alberta’s deregulation of alcohol in 1993, their retail alcohol prices have since tripled Ontario’s (28.2% vs 9.2%). By accounting for tax differentials and comparing the average (non-sale) 24 pack cost <b>of</b> <b>beer</b> between BC, Alberta, Quebec and Ontario, the report concludes stating that Ontarians are well served under the current regulated model.|$|R

In addition, a significant negative relationship is found for the strength of policies related to drinking and driving among youths and young adults and drinking by college students. However, the results indicate that many elements of campus life, (including participation in a fraternity or sorority, living on campus, and the ready availability of alcoholic beverages) are among the most important determinants of drinking and binge drinking among college students. ...|$|R
