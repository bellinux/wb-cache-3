40|$|The present work {{analyses}} the in vivo behaviour of a bioactive {{glass that}} can be used for osteostimulation in bone defects. the glass called S 53 P 4 was implanted as granules of 3 different sizes in <b>pokets</b> created in rabbit's dorsal muscles to investigate the reactions in the biological fluids. Before the implantation the granules were coated on one side with a layer of gold in order to obtain two sides with different permeability in the same granule and thus two differen velocities of diffusion. After 2 months granules were explanted and processed for observation under Scanning Electron Microscope with an X-ray microprobe in order to study the changed morphology of the granules and the distribution of the elements. The granules were partly leached but there were no signs of total glass breackdown and resorption...|$|R
40|$|A {{large number}} of farmers {{involved}} in bull fattening just before 3 or 4 months of Eid-Ul-Azha (Muslim festival), when they sell the animals with profitable prices. Cattle fattening for beef production have become an important business of the small farmers in Bangladesh. In few areas of Bangladesh a small scale commercial beef fattening program has already been started. Straw is the important crop residue; contribute the major portion of the fibrous part of the diet of the beef cattle. Rice straw is the basal feed for ruminants with low nutritive value and low digestibility. Farmers use rice straw of traditional varieties, green grass, sugarcane tops, wheat and rice bran, molasses, pulse bran and locally available resources such as pumpkin, carrot, banana, vegetable by products, rice gruel, boiled rice bran, oil cakes etc for beef fattening. The chemical treatment of straw {{is the most effective}} and economic method to improving the quality. Straw is mainly treated with urea and molasses and in some cases chemical treatment also done by the farmers. Urea molasses straw treatment in beef cattle resulted higher body weight, dressing percentage and also in better carcass quality than untreated straw. The acute shortage of feeds and fodder has long been identified as a serious constraint to optimum livestock production in Bangladesh. The nutritional factor is considered a major constraint to livestock productivity. Traditional grazing field is scarce except in some <b>pokets</b> in Pabna and Sylhet districts. Farmers used three years old cattle for beef fattening and maximum growth rate between 1. 1 to 1. 4 years of age. Cattle fattening period is 4. 5 months in rural areas of Bangladesh...|$|R

50|$|Dominican rock is also {{popular among}} {{younger and older}} crowds of the Dominican Republic. Dominican rock is {{influenced}} by British and American rock, but also has its own sense of unique style. The rock scene in the Dominican Republic has been very vibrant in recent years, spanning many genres of rock such as pop rock, reggae/rock, punk, metal. Dominican rock had started its scene in the early 1980s, when Luis Días & Transporte Urbano, (who {{is considered to be}} the father of Dominican rock), came onto the scene and created this genre. Since then, there have been hundreds of Dominican rock bands, with the most successful being Toque Profundo, Tabu Tek, Al-Jadaqui Tribu del Sol, Top 40, TKR, <b>Poket,</b> La Siembra, La Reforma and others. Rita Indiana y los Misterios are a musical group known for their blend of traditional merengue music with rock. Bocatabu, Dronk, Futuros Divorciados and 42-01 are new Dominican rock groups who are also on the rise.|$|E
40|$|Beagle {{dogs were}} anesthetized with pentobarbital-Na, and waxed silk was {{tightened}} around the under cut {{area of the}} dental necks of both postmolar teeth in the upper jaw. One week later, remarkable signs of gingivitis became apparent, and gingivitis was confirmed histologically. Prozime- 10 (P- 10, a proteolytic enzyme) and indomethacin were givin either orally in enteric-coated capsules or parenterally (intravenously or subcutaneously) for 7 consecutive days. The thickness of gingiva and the volume of exudate in the gingival <b>poket</b> were measured before the operation, 7 days after silk ligation and {{after the completion of}} the drug administration. The effect of test drugs was evaluated in relation to these changes. Oral administration of 12. 5 mg/kg P- 10 was quite effective in alleviating the inflammatory signs. Indomethacin (5 mg/kg, p. o.) was slightly less effective, but significantly effective. In all cases of indomethacin administration, mucous diarrhoea was observed, and in some cases a visible amout of blood was mixed in the stool. No such sign was noted with P- 10. The formation of granular tissue in the lamina propria of mucosa facing the waxed silk was noted characteristically in histological examinations of swollen gingiva. However, neither granular tissues nor any signs of inflammation were observed after P- 10 administration...|$|E
