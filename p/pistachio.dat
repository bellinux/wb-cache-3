5|$|Trees are {{the source}} of many of the world's best known fleshy fruits. Apples, pears, plums, {{cherries}} and citrus are all grown commercially in temperate climates and a wide range of edible fruits are found in the tropics. Other commercially important fruit include dates, figs and olives. Palm oil is obtained from the fruits of the oil palm (Elaeis guineensis). The fruits of the cocoa tree (Theobroma cacao) are used to make cocoa and chocolate and the berries of coffee trees, Coffea arabica and Coffea canephora, are processed to extract the coffee beans. In many rural areas of the world, fruit is gathered from forest trees for consumption. Many trees bear edible nuts which can loosely be described as being large, oily kernels found inside a hard shell. These include coconuts (Cocos nucifera), Brazil nuts (Bertholletia excelsa), pecans (Carya illinoinensis), hazel nuts (Corylus), almonds (Prunus dulcis), walnuts (Juglans regia), pistachios (Pistacia vera) and many others. They are high in nutritive value and contain high-quality protein, vitamins and minerals as well as dietary fibre. Walnuts are particularly beneficial to health and contain a higher level of antioxidants than do other nuts. A variety of nut oils are extracted by pressing for culinary use; some such as walnut, <b>pistachio</b> and hazelnut oils are prized for their distinctive flavours, but they tend to spoil quickly.|$|E

25|$|In 1998, the Seattle Times {{reported}} that <b>pistachio</b> makers in California were unhappy {{about the fact}} that Israel imported most of its <b>pistachio</b> from Iran. The head of Iran-China economic room, Asadollah Asgaroladi said in the article that such transactions are easily possible. Based on the article Israel imports only a quarter of pistachios from US and about half of its pistachios from Britain and Germany, whereas these two countries are not producers of <b>pistachio</b> at all and the source is very likely to be from Iran. Furthermore, in 1998 Israeli government punished the Hamama Brothers Co. for illegally importing 105 tonnes of <b>pistachio</b> from Iran. Israeli newspaper Ynet reported in 2007 that US government once again asked Israeli government to stop importing pistachios from Iran. In 2008 US ambassador to Israel, Richard H. Jones wrote a letter to Israel's finance minister Ronnie Bar-on demanding Israel to stop importing Iranian pistachios from Turkey. Similar reports have been published by Haaretz.|$|E

40|$|The navel orangeworm (NOW, Amyelois transitella Walker) is a {{multivoltine}} scavenger on fallen {{or damaged}} fruits and nuts {{and can also}} attack undamaged nuts. Since its arrival in California’s Central Valley in the late 1940 ’s, commercially grown almonds, <b>pistachios,</b> figs and walnuts have been infested by NOW and this moth is currently a primary pest of almonds and <b>pistachios</b> in California. This moth overwinters in the previous season’s unharvested crop (mummies) and development occurs sporadically through the winter and spring when temperatures exceed the lower threshold of 55 ° F. Adults emerge from the mummies {{on the ground and}} in the trees (first flight) and these females lay their eggs on other mummies to continue the life cycle. When this second wave emerges (second flight), females oviposit on mummies or the new crop nuts as they become available. Orchard sanitation during the winter months is an important practice for NOW control in almonds and <b>pistachios.</b> Eliminating mummies destroys overwintering insects and reduces the number of nuts available for oviposition by the first flight of NOW. Mummy almonds are destroyed on the ground by flail mowing while mummy <b>pistachios</b> are disked into the soil of the drive rows. Sanitation is more successful for almonds than <b>pistachios</b> because almonds are smashed by flail mowing while <b>pistachios</b> cannot be smashed because their shell is too tough. Hundreds of thousands of <b>pistachios</b> per acre remain on the ground and serve as a resource for NOW. A biological agent, entomopathogenic nematodes, can play a role in reducing the overwintering population in <b>pistachios,</b> because infective juvenile nematodes seek out infested nuts on the ground and kill the larvae inside.
