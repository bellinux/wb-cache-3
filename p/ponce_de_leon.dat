5|$|Juan <b>Ponce</b> <b>de</b> <b>León</b> charted Key Biscayne on {{his first}} mission to the New World in 1513. He christened the island Santa Marta and claimed it for the Spanish Crown. He {{reported}} that he found a fresh water spring on the island. <b>Ponce</b> <b>de</b> <b>León</b> called the bay behind the island (Biscayne Bay) Chequescha, a variant form of Tequesta.|$|E
5|$|What {{is known}} of the {{inhabitants}} of Florida after 1566 was recorded by European explorers and settlers. Juan <b>Ponce</b> <b>de</b> <b>León</b> is credited as the first European to have contact with Florida's indigenous people in 1513. <b>Ponce</b> <b>de</b> <b>León</b> met with hostility from tribes {{that may have been}} the Ais and the Tequesta before rounding Cape Sable to meet the Calusa, the largest and most powerful tribe in South Florida. <b>Ponce</b> <b>de</b> <b>León</b> found {{at least one of the}} Calusa fluent in Spanish. The explorer assumed the Spanish-speaker was from Hispaniola, but anthropologists have suggested that communication and trade between Calusa and native people in Cuba and the Florida Keys was common, or that <b>Ponce</b> <b>de</b> <b>León</b> was not the first Spaniard to make contact with the native people of Florida. During his second visit to South Florida, <b>Ponce</b> <b>de</b> <b>León</b> was killed by the Calusa, and the tribe gained a reputation for violence, causing future explorers to avoid them. In the more than 200years the Calusa had relations with the Spanish, they were able to resist their attempts to missionize them.|$|E
5|$|In March 1898, the {{baseball}} fields were finally completed. On April 16, 1898, the first baseball game between Georgia and Georgia Tech, {{then known as}} the Georgia School of Technology, was played. From 1902 until 1904, the Atlanta Crackers, the city's original professional baseball team played ball on the fields of Piedmont Park before moving to a stadium on <b>Ponce</b> <b>de</b> <b>Leon</b> Avenue.|$|E
50|$|The marquisate {{was created}} by the queen Isabella I of Castile to reward Duke Henry of Medina Sidonia (Enrique Pérez de Guzmán, 2nd Duke of Medina Sidonia). The Duke of Medina Sidonia had been {{recognized}} his rights and powers over the town of Gibraltar and its Campo by Isabella upon the death of Henry IV, her predecessor. As him, the Catholic Monarchs had to face a turbulent nobility. In Andalucía, the most powerful and rival families were the Guzmans (the Dukes of Medina Sidonia) and the <b>Ponce</b> <b>de</b> <b>Leons</b> (the Counts of Arcos).|$|R
5000|$|<b>De</b> <b>Leon</b> ( [...] ) {{is a city}} {{located in}} Comanche County in the U.S. state of Texas. The {{population}} was 2,246 {{at the time of}} the 2010 census. It is commonly associated with being named after the Spanish explorer <b>Ponce</b> <b>de</b> Leon; however the town actually obtains its name due to the location of the Leon River, translates to <b>de</b> <b>Leon</b> in Spanish, which flows directly North and East of the community, and drains into nearby Lake Proctor.|$|R
50|$|Pedro <b>Ponce</b> <b>de</b> Cabrera {{was buried}} in the chapel of Saint Benito at the Monastery of Santa María de Nogales, founded by his {{grandparents}} Vela Gutiérrez and Sancha <b>Ponce</b> <b>de</b> Cabrera. His widow Aldonza was also buried in the same chapel.|$|R
5|$|When <b>Ponce</b> <b>de</b> <b>León</b> {{arrived in}} Puerto Rico, {{he was well}} {{received}} by the Cacique (Tribal chief) Agüeybaná (The Great Sun), chieftain of the island Taino tribes. Besides the conquistadors, {{some of the first}} colonists were farmers and miners in search of gold. In 1508, <b>Ponce</b> <b>de</b> <b>León</b> became the first appointed governor of Puerto Rico, founding the first settlement of Caparra between the modern-day cities of Bayamón and San Juan. After being named Governor, de León and the conquistadors forced the Tainos to work in the mines and to build fortifications; many Tainos {{died as a result of}} cruel treatment during their labor. In 1510, upon Agüeybaná's death, his brother Güeybaná, better known as Agüeybaná II (The Brave), and a group of Tainos led Diego Salcedo, a Spaniard, to a river and drowned him, proving to his people that the white men were not gods. Upon realizing this, Agüeybaná II led his people in the Taino rebellion of 1511, the first rebellion in the island against the better armed Spanish forces. Guarionex, cacique of Utuado, attacked the village of Sotomayor (present day Aguada) and killed eighty of its inhabitants. Cacique Guarionex died during the attack which was considered a Taino victory.|$|E
5|$|The {{first person}} to officially occupy the {{position}} was Spanish conquistador Juan <b>Ponce</b> <b>de</b> <b>León</b> in 1509. At the time, the Spanish monarchy was responsible for appointing the functionary who would perform this office. The first native Puerto Rican to perform the function was Juan <b>Ponce</b> <b>de</b> <b>León</b> II, as interim governor in 1579. During this administration, all of those appointed to take the position had served another function within the empire's government or the Roman Catholic Church. In 1898, the United States invaded Puerto Rico and the Spanish government ceded control of the island to the United States. During the first two years, the entire government in Puerto Rico was appointed by the President of the United States. In 1900, the American government approved {{the establishment of the}} Foraker Act as a federal law, this act established a civilian government in the island. In 1947, the federal Elective Governor Act was enacted, which created a new system where, since 1948, the governor is elected through a democratic process every four years. The governor is in charge of Puerto Rico's executive branch and is responsible for appointing executive branch agency heads, including the Secretary of State, who fulfills the role of lieutenant governor, the legislative branch's Ombudsman and Comptroller and all judges in the judicial branch.|$|E
5|$|After the Taino victory {{the colonists}} formed a citizens' militia to defend {{themselves}} against the attacks. Juan <b>Ponce</b> <b>de</b> <b>León</b> {{and one of his}} top commanders, Diego de Salazar led the Spaniards in a series of offensives which included a massacre of the Taino forces in the domain of Agüeybaná II. The Spanish offensive culminated in the Battle of Yagüecas against Cacique Mabodomoca. Agüeybaná II was shot and killed, ending the first recorded military action in Puerto Rico. After the failed rebellion, the Tainos were forced to give up their customs and traditions by order of a Royal decree, approved by King Ferdinand II, which required that they adopt and practice the values, religion and language of their conquerors.|$|E
50|$|<b>De</b> <b>León</b> {{returned}} about 1844 {{to reclaim}} the family property, but did not become head of the <b>De</b> <b>León</b> clan. Leadership of the <b>De</b> <b>León</b> family rested with matriarch Patricia de la Garza <b>De</b> <b>León.</b> Fernando <b>De</b> <b>León</b> did, however, manage to regain 50,000 acre of his property.|$|R
2500|$|There is {{abundant}} contemporary documentary evidence of <b>Ponce</b> <b>de</b> Cabrera's exile to Castile, while <b>Ponce</b> <b>de</b> Minerva clearly remained {{on good terms}} with Ferdinand II throughout 1158. He was with the court at Faro in Galicia on 15 February. In March, the court was at Malgrado, where Ferdinand II rewarded Ponce with some lands between Siero and Carande. On 23 May Ponce was present for the ratification of the Treaty of Sahagún, for which he stood as a surety for Ferdinand II, along with his father-in-law, a certain Abril, and Pedro Alfonso. The Treaty stipulated that certain lands conquered by Sancho from his brother in the recent conflict were to be returned and held in fealty (in fidelitate) from Ferdinand. The treaty named three vassals among whom these lands could be distributed: <b>Ponce</b> <b>de</b> Minerva, <b>Ponce</b> <b>de</b> Cabrera, and Osorio Martínez. To {{the end of the}} surviving record of the treaty is appended a list of those who [...] "swore on the side of King Ferdinand", and Ponce is listed among them. Contrary to the Toledan historian's confused account, <b>Ponce</b> <b>de</b> Minerva was unswervingly loyal to Ferdinand II during the lifetime of Sancho III, although the presence of his name alongside the grieved <b>Ponce</b> <b>de</b> Cabrera and Osorio has raised suspicions. On 1 July he and the newly reconciled <b>Ponce</b> <b>de</b> Cabrera confirmed Ferdinand's grant to Rodrigo Sebastiánez, a monk of Oviedo.|$|R
50|$|Fernando Enríquez de Guzmán. Adelantado {{mayor of}} the border of Andalusia. He married Sancha <b>Ponce</b> <b>de</b> Cabrera, {{daughter}} of Juan <b>Ponce</b> <b>de</b> Cabrera, lord of Cabra, and granddaughter of King Alfonso IX of León. He {{was buried in the}} monastery of San Francisco in Seville.|$|R
5|$|Badajoz was {{captured}} by Alfonso IX of León on 19 March 1230. Shortly after its conquest, {{in the time of}} Alfonso X the Wise of Castile, a bishopric see was established and work was initiated on the Cathedral of San Juan Bautista. In 1336, during the reign of Alfonso XI of Castile, the troops of King Afonso IV of Portugal besieged the city. However, soon afterwards, the Castilian-Leonese troops, which included Pedro <b>Ponce</b> <b>de</b> <b>León</b> the Elder and Juan Alonso Pérez de Guzmán y Coronel, second lord of Sanlúcar de Barrameda and son of Alonso Pérez de Guzmán, defeated the troops of Alfonso IV in the Battle of Villanueva de Barcarrota. Their victory forced the king of Portugal to desert the city and it fell into neglect.|$|E
5|$|From 1893–1912, {{the team}} used area parks such as Brisbane Park, <b>Ponce</b> <b>de</b> <b>Leon</b> Park, and Piedmont Park {{as the home}} field. Georgia Tech took out a seven-year lease on {{what is now the}} {{southern}} end of Grant Field, although the land was not adequate for sports, due to its unleveled, rocky nature. In 1905, Heisman had 300 convict laborers clear rocks, remove tree stumps, and level out the field for play; Tech students then built a grandstand on the property. The land was purchased by 1913, and John W. Grant donated $15,000 towards the construction of the field's first permanent stands; the field was named Grant Field in honor of the donor's deceased son, Hugh Inman Grant.|$|E
5|$|Horses {{first arrived}} on the {{southeast}} North American mainland in 1521, brought by <b>Ponce</b> <b>de</b> <b>Leon</b> on his second trip to the region, where they were used by officers, scouts and livestock herders. Later expeditions brought more horses and cattle to Spanish Florida. By the late 16th century, horses were used extensively in the local cattle business and by the late 17th century the industry was flourishing, especially {{in what is now}} northern Florida and southern Georgia. The horses brought to North America by the Spanish and subsequently bred there included Barbs, Garranos, Spanish Jennets, Sorraias, Andalusians and other Iberian breeds. Overall, they were relatively small and had physical traits distinctive of Spanish breeds, including short backs, sloping shoulders, low set tails and wide foreheads.|$|E

5|$|In 1963, Briarcliff {{resident}} and artist Myril Adler proposed {{a series of}} exhibits of graphic art; the first showing was in October of that year and recurred each month thereafter, each with Sunday opening receptions. Exhibitors included Adler, Michael <b>Ponce</b> <b>de</b> <b>Leon,</b> Seong Moy, Rodolfo Abularach, Fritz Eichenberg, Jacob Landau, George Earl Ortman, Minna Citron, and Alfredo Da Silva. Exhibited works included etchings and engravings, woodcuts, cellocuts, lithographs, collage intaglios, and serigraphs. As {{a result of these}} exhibits, the library began a collection of prints donated by the exhibiting artists. In the library's small space, Adler displayed prints between shelves and in the youth and children's reading rooms.|$|E
5|$|When the Spanish Empire colonized Puerto Rico {{during the}} 16th century, the Spanish conquistador Juan <b>Ponce</b> <b>de</b> <b>León</b> {{established}} himself as the island's first governor replacing Vicente Yáñez Pinzón, who was appointed to take the position of Captain General of the City of Puerto Rico prior to the island's colonization but never performed this function. During this time period, the Spanish monarchy {{was in charge of}} appointing the governor of Puerto Rico, the person selected {{was in charge of the}} island's development and wealth and was responsible for reporting the colony's status to the Spanish Empire. After 1580 the Captaincy General of Puerto Rico was established, and the office of captain general was added to the governor.|$|E
5|$|After Juan <b>Ponce</b> <b>de</b> <b>León</b> {{began the}} {{colonization}} process of Puerto Rico, the archipelago became a strategic military location, used by Spain {{to protect its}} colonies and possessions in America. Vessels {{used it as a}} main point for resupplying before attempting long voyages and trading became a key part of economy. However, when the mines and rivers in the main island of Puerto Rico, then known as San Juan Bautista, were depleted Puerto Rico began suffering from shortage of gold and its income was reduced drastically, precipitating a recession. Beginning in the 16th century, the Spanish Crown was forced to issue a monetary support decree to the archipelago known as situado, which was supplied by the Royal banks in Central America, particularly Mexico. However, this aid failed to arrive often, contributing to the economical instability. This was exacerbated by other factors, including the costs of running an efficient military and a lack of commercial prosperity. Natural conditions and disasters also contributed, multiplying the costs of maintaining fortresses while hurricanes damaged haciendas, destroying crops and shortening the amount of laborers.|$|E

5|$|After Spain sent Columbus on {{his first}} voyage to the New World in 1492, other explorers followed. The first Europeans to arrive in {{territory}} of the modern United States were Spanish conquistadors such as Juan <b>Ponce</b> <b>de</b> <b>León,</b> who made {{his first visit to}} Florida in 1513; however, if unincorporated territories are accounted for, then credit would go to Christopher Columbus who landed in Puerto Rico on his 1493 voyage. Spanish set up the first settlements in Florida and New Mexico such as Saint Augustine and Santa Fe. The French established their own as well along the Mississippi River. Successful English settlement on the eastern coast of North America began with the Virginia Colony in 1607 at Jamestown and the Pilgrims' Plymouth Colony in 1620. Many settlers were dissenting Christian groups who came seeking religious freedom. The continent's first elected legislative assembly, Virginia's House of Burgesses created in 1619, the Mayflower Compact, signed by the Pilgrims before disembarking, and the Fundamental Orders of Connecticut, established precedents for the pattern of representative self-government and constitutionalism that would develop throughout the American colonies.|$|E
5|$|Fort George Island {{is located}} in Duval County, several miles {{northeast}} of downtown Jacksonville. It is a marsh island {{at the mouth of}} the St. Johns River, surrounded by tidal estuaries, Little Talbot Island, and the Nassau River. The north Atlantic coast of Florida had been inhabited for approximately 12,000 years when Spanish explorer Juan <b>Ponce</b> <b>de</b> <b>León</b> landed near Cape Canaveral in 1513. The Spanish met the Saturiwa, a Timucua tribe, who were the largest group of indigenous people in the region, numbering about 14,000. Bands of Timucua extended into central Florida and south Georgia. An estimated 35 chiefdoms existed in the territory, and their societies were complex with large villages sustained by fishing, hunting, and agriculture, but they frequently warred with each other and unrelated groups of Native Americans. The Spanish concentrated their efforts of exploration and settlement on the Gulf Coast of Florida. By 1562, Jean Ribault led French explorers to the mouth of the St. Johns River where they built a garrison in 1564, calling it Fort Caroline. Within 200 years the population of the indigenous people of Florida was decimated by disease and constant fighting. They left behind evidence of their existence in massive middens or shell mounds filled with discarded food byproducts. On Fort George Island, the shells were primarily oysters.|$|E
5|$|The Moorish {{presence}} in Gibraltar ended in 1462, when Enrique's son Juan Alonso de Guzmán, 1st Duke of Medina Sidonia captured {{it after the}} eighth siege. What followed was a bitter dispute over {{the rights to the}} fortress. The Duke of Medina Sidonia claimed Gibraltar as his own, making a mortal enemy of Juan <b>Ponce</b> <b>de</b> <b>León,</b> Count of Arcos, but Henry IV of Castile declared it crown property shortly afterwards and so began a civil war. Henry was deposed in effigy in 1465 by a council of nobles who proclaimed as king his half-brother Alfonso. Gibraltar's ninth siege took place after Medina Sidonia persuaded Alfonso to grant him the fortress, following which the Duke sent an army to storm the town. Henry's governor held out for fifteen months before finally surrendering in July 1467. Medina Sidonia's grandson, the third duke Juan Alfonso Pérez de Guzmán, was responsible for Gibraltar's tenth siege (and, as it happened, its last for 200 years). Queen Isabella I again declared Gibraltar crown property in 1501, but her death three years later left Castile in turmoil, prompting Medina Sidonia {{to take advantage of the}} kingdom's weakness. He assembled an army and marched on Gibraltar in the hope that the city would simply open its gates to him, but it did not, forcing him to lay siege to it instead; he abandoned the attempt after three months.|$|E

She and her husband renewed their vows on January 27, 1976, in a religious service officiated by Rev Alleysius Rodríguez. The couple separated, and their marriage was dissolved in 1996.|$|R
50|$|In 1831 Benavides married Agustina <b>De</b> <b>León,</b> {{daughter}} of empresario Martín <b>De</b> <b>León</b> {{and his wife}} Patricia de la Garza <b>De</b> <b>León.</b> The couple had three daughters, Pilar, Librada and Matiana.|$|R
