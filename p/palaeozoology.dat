50|$|The {{history of}} {{invertebrate}} paleozoology (also spelled <b>palaeozoology)</b> {{differs from the}} history of paleontology in that the former usually emphasizes paleobiology and the paleoecology of extinct marine invertebrates, while the latter typically emphasizes the earth sciences and the sedimentary rock remains of terrestrial vertebrates.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Palaeozoology,</b> also spelled as Paleozoology (Greek: , palaeon [...] "old" [...] and , zoon [...] "animal"), is {{the branch}} of paleontology, paleobiology, or zoology dealing with the {{recovery}} and identification of multicellular animal remains from geological (or even archeological) contexts, {{and the use of}} these fossils in the reconstruction of prehistoric environments and ancient ecosystems.|$|E
50|$|Awarded {{a senior}} studentship, {{he worked for}} a year on Permian {{amphibians}} with Walter Frederick Whittard and for two years at Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, where he studied dendroid graptolites under Gertrude Lilian Elles. Work on the Palaeontographical Society's monograph British Dendroid Graptolites (1927 and 1928) earned him a Cambridge PhD degree in 1928. He then worked as demonstrator at Imperial College and at Cambridge. He became reader in <b>palaeozoology</b> in 1944 and Woodwardian Professor of Geology in 1955.|$|E
50|$|Jarvik {{was born}} at a farm in Utby Parish near Mariestad in {{northern}} Västergötland. He studied botany, zoology, geology, and paleontology at Uppsala University, where he took his licentiate's degree in 1937. In 1942, he completed his PhD with the dissertation On {{the structure of the}} snout of Crossopterygians and lower Gnathostomes in general. He participated in the Greenland expedition of Gunnar Säve-Söderbergh in 1932 and was appointed assistant in the Department of <b>Palaeozoology</b> of the Swedish Museum of Natural History in Stockholm in 1937; he eventually succeeded Erik Stensiö as professor and head of the department in 1960, retiring in 1972.|$|E

His {{candidature}} citation read: [...] "Honorary Director of Bernard Price Institute for Palaeontological Research, Witwatersrand University; formerly Director of the Geological Survey of South Africa and Chief Geologist, South Africa Atomic Energy Board. The outstanding living {{authority on the}} geology of South Africa. Distinguished for the value and wide range of contributions to the geology of southern and central Africa especially {{in the fields of}} <b>palaeozoology,</b> stratigraphy and economic geology. To the systematic study of Karoo reptiles alone he has devoted 37 papers; other researches contain mollusca, fishes, amphibia and mammalia. Currently is co-ordinating geological studies throughout Africa south of the Sahara. The list of 106 publications is attached." ...|$|E

Martin could in 1919, record 49 foraminifera from {{tertiary}} strata of Java, {{on the strength of}} a critical study of the existant literature, and especially on the strength of his own studies and knowledge of the above mentioned fossils (Bibl. 49). In composing the following list of the Foraminifera I have only been able to perform such a critical study for a few families. For the greater part, however, I have had to restrict myself to recording the results obtained by others, and even therein I have been obliged to restrict myself...|$|E
40|$|Nicolaas Cornelis de Fremery (1 770 - 1844) as a {{palaeontologist}} Nicolaas Cornelis de Fremery (1770 - 1844) {{was one of}} {{the early}} palaeontologists in The Netherlands. After his studies in Leiden he was appointed professor in medicine, pharmacy, chemistry and natural history at the university of Utrecht. De Fremery published in his later years three articles on Dutch fossil mammals. In his first publication on a fossil skull of Bos primigenius. found in 1825 at Eembrugge, he clearly points out his ideas on geology. De Fremery appears to be influenced by the catastrofism theory of Georges Cuvier (1769 - 1832). De Fremery, however, added some remarkable new views to this widespread theory. The aim {{of this article is to}} analyse his work on the <b>palaeozoology</b> and the geology of The Netherlands. Comparisons with some foreign contemporaries are made...|$|E
40|$|The {{discovery}} of large Pleistocene mammals in 1907 and 1929 in the Starunia ozokerite mine, about 130 kilometres southeast of Lviv, Ukraine, was a spectacular scientific event {{on a world}} scale. A unique combination of brine and oil, into which the animals had sunk, resulted in the near perfect preservation of woolly rhinoceros. In 2004, investigations in Starunia were restarted by Polish and Ukrainian scientists. This issue of Annales Societatis Geologorum Poloniae contains 18 papers which present the results of field and laboratory studies in the Starunia area completed by Polish scientists in the years 2006 - 2009. Interdisciplinary studies were realized by eleven thematic working groups on: Quaternary lithology and sedimentology, palaeobotany (palynology and analysis of macrofossils), botany (analysis of halophytes), <b>palaeozoology</b> (malacological analysis), radiocarbon dating, microbiology, surface and near-surface geochemistry, organic geochemistry (bitumen content and its fractions, biomarkers and stable carbon isotopes) and inorganic geochemistry (chloride ion analysis), geoelectric survey (DC resistivity soundings, electromagnetic terrain conductivity measurements, resistivity imaging, penetrometer-based resistivity profiling and azimuthal pole-dipole DC resistivity soundings) and microgravimetric survey. Results of these studies enabled recognition of the geological setting and sedimentary environment of Quaternary sediments, which hosted the Pleistocene fossils, and to determine the most favourable area of about 1, 000 square metres for subsequent prospecting for extinct mammals within Pleistocene sediments in Starunia...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of an analysis of ichthyofaunal variability throughout the section of the Menilite-Krosno Series (MKS) in the Outer Carpathians of Poland. The studied tanathocoenoses were formed {{at the bottom of a}} more than 2, 000 m deep northern basin of the Tethys, being largely represented by the continental rise and bottoms of its narrow furrows, and - to a lesser degree - the continental slope and slopes of a submarine high. Lateral variability of statististically representative assemblages of tanathocoenoses hosted in thin, isochro- nous horizons is interpreted as a result of both local changes of ichthyocoenoses and the influence of post-mortem relocation of fishes that mainly dwelled the shelf and upper continental slope. Vertical variability, in turn, is considered as a resulting from changeable conditions of the ecological environment, the input and outflow of taxa whose evolution proceeded in the Indo-Pacific area, and the species extinction. Changeability of ichthyofauna within a ca. 16 -m. y. -long interval made it possible to document and formally describe 9 zones and 4 subzones of ichthyofauna of ecostratigraphic character. These zones comprise index, representative and accompanying taxa that belong to different ecological groups. Conceptual models of the origin of ichthyofaunal assemblages of individual zones are presented. It is suggested that the origin of assemblage differentiation resulted from the appearance and disappearance of the oxygen minimum zone in the water column, global and local sea level changes, topography of the basin bottom, as well as final basin infilling by sediments of submarine fans. The described and preserved collection of fossil Carpathian fishes, housed at the Department of <b>Palaeozoology</b> of the University of Wrocław, requires further specialized palaeontological studies in order to reconstruct a more complete composition of the Oligocene-Early Miocene ichthyofauna...|$|E
