Challenges to such objections often come down to debates over how evolution is defined (see the Defining evolution section above).

Evolutionary <b>processes,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of populations changing their genetic composition from generation to generation, have been observed in different scientific contexts, including the evolution of fruit flies, mice, and bacteria in the laboratory, and of tilapia in the field. Such studies on experimental evolution, particularly those using microorganisms, are now providing important insights into how evolution occurs, {{especially in the case of}} antibiotic resistance.|$|E

5|$|Although gallium has {{no natural}} {{function}} in biology, gallium ions interact with <b>processes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{body in a}} manner similar to iron(III). Because these processes include inflammation, a marker for many disease states, several gallium salts are used (or are in development) as pharmaceuticals and radiopharmaceuticals in medicine. When gallium ions are mistakenly taken up in place of iron(III) by bacteria such as Pseudomonas, the ions interfere with respiration, and the bacteria die. This happens because iron is redox-active, allowing the transfer of electrons during respiration, while gallium is redox-inactive.|$|E

5|$|Elemental {{chlorine}} is commercially {{produced from}} brine by electrolysis. The high oxidising potential of elemental chlorine {{led to the}} development of commercial bleaches and disinfectants, and a reagent for many <b>processes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> chemical industry. Chlorine is used in the manufacture of a wide range of consumer products, about two-thirds of them organic chemicals such as polyvinyl chloride, and many intermediates for the production of plastics and other end products which do not contain the element. As a common disinfectant, elemental chlorine and chlorine-generating compounds are used more directly in swimming pools to keep them clean and sanitary. Elemental chlorine at high concentrations is extremely dangerous and poisonous for all living organisms, and was used in World War I as the first gaseous chemical warfare agent.|$|E
5|$|Entities {{undergoing}} {{uniparental inheritance}} and {{with little to}} no recombination {{may be expected to}} be subject to Muller's ratchet, the inexorable accumulation of deleterious mutations until functionality is lost. Animal populations of mitochondria avoid this buildup through a developmental process known as the mtDNA bottleneck. The bottleneck exploits stochastic <b>processes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cell to increase in the cell-to-cell variability in mutant load as an organism develops: a single egg cell with some proportion of mutant mtDNA thus produces an embryo where different cells have different mutant loads. Cell-level selection may then act to remove those cells with more mutant mtDNA, leading to a stabilisation or reduction in mutant load between generations. The mechanism underlying the bottleneck is debated, with a recent mathematical and experimental metastudy providing evidence for a combination of random partitioning of mtDNAs at cell divisions and random turnover of mtDNA molecules within the cell.|$|E
5|$|Most of the ATP {{synthesized}} in the mitochondria will be {{used for}} cellular <b>processes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cytosol; thus it must be exported from its site of synthesis in the mitochondrial matrix. The inner membrane contains an antiporter, the ADP/ATP translocase, which is an integral membrane protein used to exchange newly synthesized ATP in the matrix for ADP in the intermembrane space. This translocase is driven by the membrane potential, as it results in the movement of about 4 negative charges out of the mitochondrial membrane in exchange for 3 negative charges moved inside. However, it is also necessary to transport phosphate into the mitochondrion; the phosphate carrier moves a proton in with each phosphate, partially dissipating the proton gradient.|$|E

He completed his MA in 1929 and continued to work toward his Ph.D. He became interested in using chromosomes for taxonomic studies, a method that Fernald did not support. Stebbins chose to concentrate his doctoral work on the cytology of plant reproductive <b>processes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> genus Antennaria, with cytologist E. C. Jeffrey as his supervisor and Fernald on his supervisory panel. During his Ph.D. candidature, Stebbins sought advice and supervision from geneticist Karl Sax. Sax identified several errors in Stebbins's work and disapproved of his interpretation of results that, while in accordance with Jeffrey's views, were inconsistent {{with the work of}} contemporary geneticists. Jeffrey and Sax argued over Stebbins's dissertation, and the thesis was revised numerous times to accommodate their differing views.|$|E
5|$|The Algonquians {{recognized}} maple sap as {{a source}} of energy and nutrition. At the beginning of the spring thaw, they used stone tools to make V-shaped incisions in tree trunks; they then inserted reeds or concave pieces of bark to run the sap into buckets, which were often made from birch bark. The maple sap was concentrated either by dropping hot cooking stones into the buckets or by leaving them exposed to the cold temperatures overnight and disposing of the layer of ice that formed on top. While there was widespread agriculture in Mesoamerica and the Southeast and Southwest regions of the United States, the production of maple syrup is one of only a few agricultural <b>processes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Northeast that is not a European colonial import.|$|E
30|$|In this paper, {{a method}} was {{proposed}} {{to calculate the}} specific capability indices for <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second stage of a two-stage <b>process.</b> <b>The</b> <b>process</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second stage is affected by <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first stage; therefore, sometimes <b>the</b> incapability <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second stage {{is a result of}} the incapability of the first stage. We omitted the effect of the quality characteristic of the first stage on the quality characteristic of <b>process</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second stage using the residuals. The process capability for the residuals shows the specific process capability of <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second stage. <b>In</b> addition, we proposed a method to determine the specification limits of the residuals based on the specification limits of <b>the</b> quality characteristics <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first and second stages. The simulation studies and the real case study showed that the process capability indices for the residuals calculate the specific process capability of <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second stage properly. This method can be extended to be used for the multistage processes with more than two stages. Future studies may also include calculating specific process capability indices for the multistage process when each stage has several correlated quality characteristics. The linear relation between quality characteristics is considered in this paper. Therefore, calculating specific process capability indices when the relations among quality characteristics are non-linear can be considered as future research.|$|R

5|$|The {{first few}} dorsal {{vertebrae}} {{are similar to}} the cervical vertebrae, but have taller and more prong-like neural spines. The rest are amphiplatyan, meaning that they are flat at both ends. They also have postzygapophyses which are less elongate and more pedestal-like, in addition to taller and more rectangular neural spines. The parapophyses, which are depressions instead of projections, have moved off from the transverse processes to the neural arch, between the transverse processes and the articular processes known as the prezygapophyses {{at the front of the}} vertebrae. However, they move back onto the base of the transverse <b>processes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> last few dorsals. In the third or fourth dorsal, the parapophysis is located very close to the suture between the neural spine and the centrum, which is unlike the other dorsals but similar to the first few dorsals in Edmontosaurus.

5|$|Weber's {{methodology}} {{was developed}} {{in the context of a}} wider debate about methodology of social sciences, the Methodenstreit.

Thus Weber's methodology emphasises the use of comparative historical analysis. Therefore, Weber was more interested in explaining how a certain outcome was the result of various historical processes rather than predicting an outcome of those <b>processes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> future.|$|E
