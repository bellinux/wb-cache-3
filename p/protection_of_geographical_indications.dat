In the current round of the World Trade Organization (WTO) negotiations, the European Union and other countries are seeking to expand protection through GIs. If they achieve the full range <b>of</b> <b>protection</b> they are seeking, many U.

This article describes and contrasts three systems of protecting property rights for agricultural products (certification mark, E.

The 19th century Russian poet, Alexander Pushkin once commented that [...] "Every Georgian dish is a poem." [...] In this regard, Georgia is among many European countries and regions having a history of local and specialist agricultural production.In result of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), administered by the World Trade Organization, having recognized the <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>geographical</b> <b>indications</b> for agricultural products, geographical indications of origin are for the first time afforded international protection as a separate branch of intellectual property. It serves to protect authentic products, and eliminate the unfair competition and misleading of consumers as to the true place of origin.After almost two decades of its existence as a sovereign state, Georgia goes ahead with the protection of its intellectual property. Protection of this property is of urgent importance as far as distinguished Georgian brands of wine, mineral water, or other food products are frequently misappropriated, especially within the post-soviet zone including Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and Eastern Europe. Moreover, registration of the entire intellectual property of Georgia is essential to be competitive at the international market as well as to promote quality in the food chain and stimulate value in sustainable rural development.A reflection of the views of Georgia on matters like consumer protection and intellectual property is a bilateral agreement signed between the European Union and Georgia on 14 July 2011 for the protection of their respective [...] "Geographical Indications".The agreement will contribute to the boost of trade between the EU and Georgia. Currently, around 3000 agriculture products have been registered for protection in the EU and, based on the agreement, 18 Georgian wines will be added to the list.Through this agreement, Georgia is harmonizing its legislation with the international standards on the Appellations of Origin and Geographical Indications of Goods.|$|E

40|$|Consumers {{express a}} growing {{interest}} for local and quality foods certified by their origin and theirenvironmental production standards. This {{has led to}} the emergence of certified products meeting sus-tainability criteria. Because consumers are willing to pay a price premium for sustainably producedcommodities, these certifications act as market-based instruments to promote sustainable land use. Among <b>Geographical</b> <b>Indications</b> (GIs) labels, the two European Union GIs – called <b>Protection</b> <b>of</b> Designa-tion of Origin (PDO) and <b>Protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>Geographical</b> <b>Indication</b> (PGI) – can be considered as agriculturalproduct certification. These GIs identify a good as originating from a region where a given quality, repu-tation or other characteristic of the good is attributable to its geographical origin. Land use is potentiallyaffected by GIs because product characteristics are associated with the biophysical attributes of the terroirand some product specifications relate to land management practices. Little empirical evidence substan-tiates the claim that GIs have an impact on land use. The objective {{of this study was to}} understand whetherGeographical Indications are an effective market-based instrument to promote conservation of extensiveland use practices in marginal mountain areas. We conducted farm surveys along a gradient of GI require-ments for the following similar cheese products: Tomme de Savoie PGI, Tomme de Savoie EQC, and Tomedes Bauges PDO. We tested the hypothesis that the more stringent PDO requirements were associatedwith more extensive agricultural practices and provided more benefits to farmers. Results showed thatthe strict standards of PGI and PDO are associated with greater benefits for farmers and more extensiveagricultural practices. In comparison to PGI farmers, PDO farmers obtain higher price premiums and gainmore knowledge. More extensive practices are observed on PDO farms but the differences between labelsare minor. Our results also reveal a great variability in agricultural practices among farms of a same label. Farmers have various motivations for labelling their product...|$|R

Centuries-old cultivation on sites whose climatic and pedological features differ from other sites made this variety of cabbage acquire special characteristics. That {{was one of the}} causes for proving its autochthony. For that reason the process of reselection of the Ogulin cabbage started about ten years ago in order to produce cabbage heads of the shape appropriate for packing whole sauerkraut heads, with maintaining, or even adding to their quality. The selection is being made by the Department of Vegetable Crops at the Faculty of Agriculture in Zagreb and the project has been co-financed by the town of Ogulin. The Ogulin cabbage has become the most famous product in the area due to its high quality. The cabbage producers supported the idea to ensure the <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>geographical</b> <b>indication</b> and designation <b>of</b> origin of the cabbage as a recognisable product. Requirements for the protection include proving that the product has been produced on the specific site for a number of years, which this article aims to show.

The design object of the project is the optimizazion/innovation of material and energy flows in the locally produced bean process (Fagiolo Cuneo). The Systemic Design (SD) studies not only the linear process, but also the inputs and outputs involved in each phase, to generate added value from what is usually considered waste. Environmental problems generate both difficulties but also the main opportunities for innovation related to Cuneo's bean supply-chain, from cultivation to distribution, from packaging design to rediscovering and promoting traditional recipes. This research evaluates the input and output of all stages of production, studies the energy needs, the flows of matter and energy and sizing a system to ensure zero impact on the environment. Cuneo's bean supply chain is of great importance for the cultural history of the province, highlighted by the presence of a 'Consortium' set up by the Chamber of Commerce of Cuneo in 1989, to promote this product registered as TFP (Traditional Food Products) and PGI (<b>Protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>Geographical</b> <b>Indication).</b> To ensure that this typical product with valuable organoleptic and nutritional characteristics becomes widespread it is necessary to introduce processes to ensure long term storage and faster cooking times for the end user. To achieve these goals the variety of bean chosen was Billò because its seeds have a rich pulp and the external part is thin. Furthermore, its cultivation can be strictly regulated and can be processed in an innovative way. The project was complex and involved many local SMEs and its strengths are related to the experimentation of new products, and the test of innovative production systems. The programmed changes provide an evolution in industrial processes that were modified from linear (resource extraction, processing and production of manufactured goods and scrap) to systemic and integrated, by creating a network of companies with zero emission...|$|R

Both the GI industry and the substitute product industry are assumed to be competitive (with free entry). The model is calibrated and solved for alternative parameter values. Results show that producers of the GI and of the lower-quality substitute good have divergent interests: GI producers are better off with full protection, whereas the substitute good 2 ̆ 7 s producers prefer intermediate levels <b>of</b> <b>protection</b> (but they never prefer zero protection because they benefit indirectly if the GI producers’ incentives to promote are preserved).

40|$|Origin related attributes, such as <b>geographical</b> <b>indications,</b> {{have been}} largely {{identified}} as good proxy indicators of wine quality and are therefore useful tools both for producers and consumers to address information asymmetry. For Argentina, a New World wine producer with an interesting growing pattern in international markets, {{the understanding of the}} role <b>of</b> <b>geographical</b> <b>indications</b> is a key issue. Despite the current success of the grape-variety based differentiation strategy, there is an increasing debate on its long-term suitability. Meanwhile, most Argentinean wineries do include non-protected geographical names and vineyard indications on their product label. Through the hedonic pricing methodology we estimated marginal willingness to pay for a wide variety <b>of</b> <b>geographical</b> names present on Argentinean Malbec wine labels sold in foreign markets. New World and Old World markets –well-known classification based on wine production and consumption traditions- have been included in the analysis, in an attempt to provide a comprehensive picture. The United States and the United Kingdom were considered from the former group while the Netherlands and Germany were considered for the latter. For a superior assessment of marginal willingness to pay, analyses were carried out for a Retail data set and an Free on Board data set, which is a novel approach in hedonic pricing. With the former data set we were able to estimate consumers’ willingness to pay for high- to medium-priced Malbec wines sold mostly in specialized shops. The latter data set extended estimates to all price segments sold in the wide diversity of off-trade or on-trade stores, giving insights into intermediates’ marginal willingness to pay. Overall, results indicate that both in New World and Old World countries, consumers {{are willing to pay for}} specific origin based wines when buying Argentinean Malbec wine. Differences between countries indicate that their ‘telescopic ability’ to differentiate geographical names and their willingness to pay vary substantially. United States’ consumers are willing to pay a price premium for many different geographical names, located in all the wine producing regions of Argentina. A similar but weaker behavior pattern was observed for English consumers. In the Netherlands and Germany, a reduced number <b>of</b> <b>geographical</b> names are appreciated by consumers and a strong concentration on specific areas was verified. The observed appreciation of vineyard indication -which is not controlled by law but simply defined by the vintner- in all four markets gives further support to conclusions. Both consumers and intermediate buyers are interested in the origin of the product and thus employ available tools to simplify their difficult purchasing decision. The revealed appreciation overcomes the lack of effective national and international <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> Argentinean wine <b>geographical</b> <b>indications.</b> Notwithstanding the importance of possible bilateral or multilateral agreements -for enhancing consumers’ ‘telescopic ability’ to recognize and discriminate among terroir-related wine attributes- the assessment <b>of</b> <b>geographical</b> <b>indications</b> territorial governance indicates a lack of collective management of resources. An actual change in producers’ mentality is required for the implementation <b>of</b> an effective <b>geographical</b> indiactions governance system able to benefit from the revealed appreciation. Adequate investments in human capital will be crucial to effectively implement this substantially new strategic approach based on an appropriate collective management <b>of</b> <b>geographical</b> <b>indication</b> property rights. ...|$|R
