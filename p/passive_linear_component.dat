40|$|Long {{before the}} {{invention}} of Feynman diagrams, engineers were using similar diagrams to reason about electrical circuits and more general networks containing mechanical, hydraulic, thermodynamic and chemical components. We can formalize this reasoning using props: that is, strict symmetric monoidal categories where the objects are natural numbers, with the tensor product of objects given by addition. In this approach, each kind of network corresponds to a prop, and each network of this kind is a morphism in that prop. A network with $m$ inputs and $n$ outputs is a morphism from $m$ to $n$, putting networks together in series is composition, and setting them side by side is tensoring. Here we work {{out the details of}} this approach for various kinds of electrical circuits, starting with circuits made solely of ideal perfectly conductive wires, then circuits with <b>passive</b> <b>linear</b> <b>components,</b> and then circuits that also have voltage and current sources. Each kind of circuit corresponds to a mathematically natural prop. We describe the "behavior" of these circuits using morphisms between props. In particular, we give a new proof of the black-boxing theorem proved by Fong and the first author; unlike the original proof, this new one easily generalizes to circuits with nonlinear components. We also use a morphism of props to clarify the relation between circuit diagrams and the signal-flow diagrams in control theory. Technically, the key tools are the Rosebrugh-Sabadini-Walters result relating circuits to special commutative Frobenius monoids, the monadic adjunction between props and signatures, and a result saying which symmetric monoidal categories are equivalent to props.

40|$|Stay cables, such as {{are used}} in {{cable-stayed}} bridges, are prone to vibration due to their low inherent damping characteristics. Transversely-attached passive viscous dampers have been implemented in many bridges to dampen such vibration. Several studies have investigated optimal <b>passive</b> <b>linear</b> viscous dampers, however even the optimal passive device can only add minimal damping to the cable when attached a reasonable distance from the cable deck anchor. This paper investigates the potential for improved damping using semiactive devices. The equations of motion of the cable/damper system are derived using an assumed modes approach and a control-oriented model is developed. The control-oriented model is shown to be more accurate that other models and facilitates low-order control designs. The effectiveness of <b>passive</b> <b>linear</b> viscous dampers are reviewed. The response of a cable with passive, active and semiactive dampers is studied. The response with a semiactive damper {{is found to be}} dramatically reduced compared to the optimal <b>passive</b> <b>linear</b> viscous damper for typical damper config-urations, thus demonstrating the efficacy of a semiactive damper for absorbing cable vibratory energy.

We test the reliability of this approach in three different soil conditions of the Santiago basin (Chilean capital) using standard equipment. This methodology is compared with reliable results from high-energy active source and borehole information. To obtain a confident shear wave depth-profile with standard equipment, it is necessary to combine the dispersion curves obtained with low-energy active source, <b>passive</b> <b>linear</b> and circular arrays.

Very recently, arising {{from the study of}} quantum random walks with multiphoton walkers, as well as the study of the computational complexity of <b>passive</b> <b>linear</b> optical interferometers fed with single-photon inputs, {{it has been shown that}} such <b>passive</b> <b>linear</b> optical devices generate a superexponentially large amount of number-path entanglement.

Our result implies a pathway forward to practical quantum metrology with readily available technology. 5 page(s...|$|R
