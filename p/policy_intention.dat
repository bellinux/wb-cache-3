How {{precisely}} future <b>policy</b> <b>intentions</b> are communicated has, according to theory, {{implications for the}} outcome of monetary policy. Norges Bank has gone further than most other central banks in communicating its <b>policy</b> <b>intentions.</b> The Bank publishes its own interest rate forecast, along with forecasts of inflation, the output gap, and other key variables. Moreover, Norges Bank aims to be precise about how the <b>policy</b> <b>intentions</b> are formed. The Bank currently uses optimal policy in a timeless perspective as the normative benchmark when assessing the <b>policy</b> <b>intentions.</b> Given the reaction pattern based on the timeless perspective, the Bank identifies and explains the factors that bring about {{a change in the}} interest rate forecast from one Monetary Policy Report to the next. The main arguments for publishing the interest rate forecast are discussed and validated against three years of experience with such forecasts. In this paper, we find evidence of reduced volatility in market interest rates on the days with interest rate decisions, which suggests that communicating <b>policy</b> <b>intentions</b> more precisely improves the market participants' understanding of the central bank's reaction pattern.

It thus throws into sharp relief the policy effects of education decentralisation in South Africa, illuminating through case study data the disjuncture between <b>policy</b> <b>intention</b> and effect. It argues for the need to re-examine some aspects of post-apartheid education policy given the historical apartheid legacy. It suggests that often, in practice, policies of education decentralisation may exacerbate rather than reduce inequities in society; they may exclude more than include...|$|E

40|$|Mind the gap: {{domestic}} versus {{foreign currency}} sovereign ratings 1 Over the past decade, {{it has become}} common practice for rating agencies to assign a domestic currency rating to the debt of sovereign nationals {{in addition to a}} foreign currency one. Often the domestic rating is higher, reflecting the presumed greater ability and willingness of sovereigns to service debt denominated in their own currency. However, the gap between the two ratings is neither omnipresent nor uniform.

40|$|Social {{research}} has long recognised that many social {{problems can be}} reduced through preventative programs. While governments cannot reasonably counter or reverse all the negative outcomes experienced by every citizen, the rationale of the ‘prevention’ approach is to anticipate and mitigate the likelihood of negative outcomes. Special relevance for the prevention approach has been claimed for the field of child and youth well-being. The <b>policy</b> <b>intention</b> is both to enhance the developmental well-being of children and young people, and to lessen {{the social and economic}} burden of dealing with the serious consequences of poor health, low skills, poverty, and anti-social behaviour later in the life cycle. However, the design and implementation of prevention programs has tended to be ‘top-down’, with little consultation with target groups (including children) and little debate on the values framework within which prevention programs operate. This paper discusses both technical and theoretical critiques of prevention approaches, and argues for the need to develop new approaches to overcome them...|$|E

40|$|The {{ability of}} a {{political}} system {{to respond to the}} preferences of its citizens is central to democra-tic theory and practice; yet most empirical research on government responsiveness has concen-trated on the United States. As a result, we know very little about the nature of government policy responsiveness in Europe and we have a poor understanding of the conditions that affect cross-national variations. This comparative study examines the relationship between public opinion and policy preferences in the United Kingdom and Denmark during the past three decades. We address two key questions: First, are the government’s <b>policy</b> <b>intentions</b> driven by public opinion or vice versa? Second, do political institutions influence the level of government responsiveness? We suggest that public opinion tends to drive the government’s <b>policy</b> <b>intentions</b> due to the threat of electoral sanction, and that this is more pronounced in proportional systems than in majoritarian democracies. The relationship between mass public opinion and public policy {{is at the heart of}} normative democratic theory. Government responsiveness to mass preferences is fundamental to most conceptions of democracy (Lijphart, 1984; Dahl, 1967). Yet, in spite of the importance of this issue, most empirical research on th...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Cities {{have become}} more {{independent}} players in a global and competitive game to attract investors who, in their turn, have to generate economic growth, with the hope and expectation that this growth will trickle down to all layers of society. In {{order to be able}} to play this game, local government has embraced a shift towards new urban policies based upon a neoliberal model of capitalism, and accompanying new governmental structures such as public private partnerships. However, in reality this economic growth has generally not produced the expected positive outcome. On the contrary it has, in many cities, enhanced socio-economic and spatial dualisation. In this paper we seek to analyse this shift towards neoliberal policies and new governance approaches in two Belgian cities, Ghent and Liege in qualitative manner. The <b>policy</b> <b>intention</b> of local government is screened at two levels: through analysis of policy documents and through use of a model that can help visualising and comparing the different policy approaches...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{considers}} {{the prospects for}} successful implementation by governments of guest-worker programs {{that are based on}} an intended tem-porary presence of foreign workers. A means of enforcement of temporary presence is a penalty imposed for overstaying the permissible time period. Employers who are obliged to post bonds for their foreign workers are pro-vided with an incentive to ensure that their workers leave {{at the end of their}} contractually speci®ed stay. We consider the consequences of such a bond when foreign workers can leave legal employers for illegal employment. We also investigate the e¨ectiveness of deferred payments to foreign workers as a means of discouraging transition from legal employment to illegal presence. In the ®nal analysis, although the <b>policy</b> <b>intention</b> is a temporary stay, we con-clude that if foreign workers do not wish to return home, there is an almost inevitability to the creation of a population of illegal immigrants (whose presence may be subsequently legalized) ...|$|E
