25|$|Liebmann's theorem (1900) {{answered}} Minding's question. The only regular (of class C2) closed {{surfaces in}} R3 with constant positive Gaussian curvature are spheres.

25|$|If the {{principal}} curvatures have different signs: , then the Gaussian curvature is negative {{and the surface}} {{is said to have}} a hyperbolic or saddle point. At such points, the surface will be saddle shaped. Because one <b>principal</b> <b>curvature</b> is negative, one is positive, and the normal curvature varies continuously if you rotate a plane orthogonal to the surface around the normal to the surface in two directions, the normal curvatures will be zero giving the Asymptotic curves for that point.|$|E
