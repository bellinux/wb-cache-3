500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the book when Cal discusses his family's history and actions prior to his birth, he speaks in an androgynous voice, with limited omniscience; he acknowledges that he is fabricating some of the details. John Mullan, University College London's professor of English and a contributor to The Guardian, wrote that by permitting Cal to be unrealistically aware of fellow characters' thoughts, Eugenides intentionally contravenes an elementary standard in storytelling fiction. In the novel's closing pages, Cal provides minute details about his father's dying moments and thoughts in a nonsensical car accident even though he is several thousand miles from the scene and only learns of the tragedy from his brother. Cal has the ability to dwell in the minds of others because as a female who has become a male, his identity is not confined by his own body. According to Mullan, this [...] "mobility of identification becomes a narrative principle" [...] and is thoroughly exploited in Middlesex. The novel follows the principle that people are molded by events prior to their birth, and Eugenides explores a character's <b>prenatal</b> <b>life</b> in terms of his or her genes; the narrator is, however, subject to the principle that whatever he does not know is of his imagination. As such, contradictory statements highlight the unreliable nature of Cal's narration. While narrating the story that pre-dates his birth, he remarks, [...] "Of course, a narrator in my position (prefetal at the time) can't be entirely sure about any of this." [...] However, he later says, [...] "I alone, from the private box of my primordial egg, saw what was going on." [...] Cal's dubious omniscience, doubtful narration, and parodies combine to show that his unreliability is an act of mischief.|$|E

40|$|Background: Exposure to {{stressful}} life events during pregnancy {{has been associated with}} later schizophrenia in offspring. We explore how prenatal stress and neurodevelopmental abnormalities in childhood associate to increase the risk of later psychotic experiences. Methods: Participants from the Mater University Study of Pregnancy (MUSP), an Australian based, pre-birth cohort study were examined for lifetime DSM-IV positive psychotic experiences at 21 years by a semi-structured interview (n =  2227). Structural equation modelling suggested psychotic experiences were best represented with a bifactor model including a general psychosis factor and two group factors. We tested for an association between <b>prenatal</b> stressful <b>life</b> events with the psychotic experiences, and examined for potential moderation and mediation by behaviour problems and cognitive ability in childhood. Results: <b>Prenatal</b> stressful <b>life</b> events predicted psychotic experiences indirectly via behaviour problems at child age five years, and this relationship was not confounded by maternal {{stressful life}} events at child age five. We found no statistical evidence for an interaction between <b>prenatal</b> stressful <b>life</b> events and behaviour problems or cognitive ability. Conclusion: The measurable effect of <b>prenatal</b> stressful <b>life</b> events on later psychotic experiences in offspring manifested as behaviour problems by age 5. By identifying early abnormal behavioural development as an intermediary, this finding further confirms the role of prenatal stress to later psychotic disorders...|$|R

40|$|UnrestrictedAsthma is {{the most}} common chronic {{inflammatory}} disease in childhood. The disease often starts early in life with significant burden to children and their families and the healthcare system. An accumulating body of evidence indicates that both <b>prenatal</b> and early <b>life</b> exposures play uniquely important roles in asthma occurrence by modulating airway and immune functions. In addition, timing of such exposures during these periods is likely to modulate the growth and development of airways and immune functions. Extensive literature reviews were done to critically evaluate earlier work and to understand the mechanisms of the underlying associations. The findings of the analyses are encouraging. Using data from the southern California Children's Health study, both <b>prenatal</b> and early <b>life</b> exposures were found to be associated with asthma occurrence in children. Additionally, timing of exposure in infancy and family history of asthma modified some of these associations. Some of the associations were stronger for particular asthma phenotypes. Given the enormous burden from childhood asthma, {{further research is needed to}} assess the role of these and other genetic, epigenetic and environmental factors during critical windows of development across distinct asthma phenotypes. These findings also indicate that any intervention strategy to reduce the burden of asthma in young children should target <b>prenatal</b> and early <b>life</b> as a critical time point to modulate exposures to prevent disease occurrence...|$|R
