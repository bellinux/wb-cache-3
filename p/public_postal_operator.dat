40|$|Postal {{services}} market in Poland has been liberalising for several years. It manifests itself through reduction of reserved area (market which {{is reserved for}} the <b>public</b> <b>postal</b> <b>operator)</b> and through increasing {{of the number of}} private postal operators. But these changes didn't {{have a major impact on}} the transformation of the Polish postal market. This market is regulated by a government appointed body and position of <b>public</b> <b>postal</b> <b>operator</b> – Poczta Polska SA – is protected by law. According to the European Directive opening up the postal market to the competition, by 1 January 2011 Poland must implement new Postal Law. New law will change, among other things, organizational and financial conditions of business activity of Poczta Polska SA. Taking into consideration the fact that the current financial standing of the Polish <b>public</b> <b>postal</b> <b>operator</b> is difficult, it should be underlined that Poczta Polska SA will be forced to take radical restructuring action. The main purpose of this article is to recognize the situation in the postal {{services market}} in Poland in the context of its full liberalisation and opening to the competition. The partial goals of this article are as follows: – to give an overview of the postal services market in Poland, – to show prospects of changes of this market in the face of EU Directives implementation, – to present the situation and purpose of Poczta Polska SA in the context of full liberalisation of the postal services market...|$|E

In this study the observed DMUs are <b>public</b> <b>postal</b> <b>operators</b> (PPOs) in European Union member states and Serbia as a candidate country. We demonstrated a sensitivity analysis of the inefficient PPOs by DEA-based approach. The development of this analytical process is performed based on real world data set. The estimations and implications are derived from the empirical study by using the CCR RTS method and the most productive scale size concept (MPSS). First, we estimated the RTS classification of all observed PPOs. After that, we determined stability intervals for preserving the RTS classification for each CCR inefficient PPO under evaluation. Finally, scale efficient inputs and output targets for these PPOs are designated...|$|R

Our results extend the literature on competition in liberalized mail markets by combining pricing and positioning strategies from a marketing perspective. Our analysis highlights that incumbent <b>postal</b> <b>operators</b> can defend their market shares by differentiating their services along one or more quality dimensions. Postal services are not necessarily homogenous. If <b>postal</b> <b>operators</b> focus solely on pricing strategies they will run into the more serious problems than if they compete on quality too.

50|$|A Digital Postmark (DPM) is a {{technology}} that applies a trusted time stamps issued by a <b>postal</b> <b>operator</b> to an electronic document, validates electronic signatures, and stores and archives all non-repudiation data needed to support a potential court challenge - it guarantees the certainty of date and time of the postmarking. This global standard was renamed the Electronic Postal Certification Mark (EPCM) in 2007 shortly after a new iteration of the technology was developed by Microsoft and Poste Italiane. The key addition to the traditional postmarking technology was integrity of the electronically postmarked item, meaning any kind of falsification and tampering will be easily and definitely detected. Additionally, content confidentiality is guaranteed since document certification is carried out without access or reading by the <b>postal</b> <b>operator.</b> The EPCM will eventually be available through the UPU to all international <b>postal</b> <b>operators</b> in the 191 member countries willing {{to be compliant with}} this standard, thus granting interoperability in certified communications between <b>postal</b> <b>operators.</b> In the United States, the US Postal Service operates a non-global standard called the Electronic Postmark, although it is soon expected to provide services utilizing the EPCM.|$|R

40|$|Driven {{by market}} opening and {{increased}} competition from electronic communication, <b>postal</b> <b>operators</b> have started extending their {{scope of business}} by offering hybrid mail services in addition to physical mail conveyance. This paper discusses commercial and regulatory aspects of reverse hybrid mail, i. e. the electronic delivery and archiving of physical mail messages. It argues that <b>postal</b> <b>operators</b> are well positioned to offer hybrid services due to their established brands and their reputation. The introduction of reverse hybrid mail is able to significantly {{reduce the cost of}} postal operations {{while at the same time}} fitting customers' needs better than traditional postal services. However, these effects rely on the assumption that a <b>postal</b> <b>operator</b> is actually allowed to introduce an electronic delivery system of letters to entire regions and to thereby partially substitute the physical delivery to the doorstep.
