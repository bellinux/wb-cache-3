40|$|Abstract: Switzerland {{has one of}} {{the highest}} {{employment}} rates of older individuals among industrialized countries. Nevertheless, in the past decade, Switzerland has experienced a marked trend toward <b>early</b> <b>retirement.</b> This study analyzes the motives of <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> in Switzerland in the 1990 s. The three main groups of motives that cover about 70 % of all <b>early</b> <b>retirements</b> are "personal reasons", company reorganizations", and "poor health". The incidence of <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> due to corporate restructuring has significantly increased during the economic recession of the mid- 1990 s. Contrary to other European countries, early exits from the labor force have not been promoted by public policies. In an international comparison, Switzerland thus has a relatively low frequency of <b>early</b> <b>retirement.</b> Furthermore, involuntary <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> is relatively rare in Switzerland, but often encountered in countries in which strict employment protection legislation forces firms to use <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> as a means to circumvent such legislation...|$|R
40|$|Orientation: Job {{characteristics}} play a {{major role}} in shaping employees’ <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> decisions. Research purpose: The objective of this study was to examine the mechanisms through which job characteristics associate with <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> intention, using the Job Demands-Resources (JD-R) model as a theoretical framework. Motivation of the study: <b>Early</b> <b>retirement</b> presents a threat to existing health and pension systems, and to organisational functioning. Therefore, it is important to examine how workrelated factors contribute to <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> decisions. Research design, approach and method: Two parallel processes were theorised to shape <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> intention: a health impairment process (i. e. job demands → recovery need → <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> intention) and a motivational process (i. e. job resources → work enjoyment → <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> intention). Survey data were collected from a heterogeneous sample of 1812 older workers (age > 45). Structural equation modeling was used to test the hypotheses. Main findings: Job demands and job resources were both associated with work enjoyment, which was associated with <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> intention. Recovery need did not add to the prediction of <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> intention. Practical/managerial implications: To retain older workers, companies should promote work conditions and practices that keep older workers motivated. Good health may be a necessary condition for retaining older workers, but it does not appear to be a sufficient one. Contribution/value-add: T he results suggest that – for <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> intention – the motivational process is more prominent than the health impairment process. </p...|$|R

By choosing countries that differ not only {{with respect to the}} coverage and generosity of publicly provided pensions but also with respect {{to the extent to which}} the state interferes in the non-public pillars of pension provision, we analyse to what extent such issues have an effect on individual <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> behaviour. Selectivity effects are expected to be stronger in countries with highly fragmented public systems or private <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> schemes. By pursuing a shift to more private pension provisions, governments might unintentionally create more inequality in <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> opportunities among the population.

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The European Company Surveys (ECS) are conducted by the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions (Eurofound), an autonomous agency of the European Union, funded from the general budget of the European Commission. The aims of the ECS are to map, assess and quantify information on workplace policies and practices across Europe in a harmonised way and – {{to a lesser extent}} – to monitor developments over time. The ECS has been carried out every four years since 2004. It is a questionnaire-based representative sample survey carried out by telephone in the language(s) of the country. Interviews take place with the manager responsible for human resources in the establishment and when possible with an employee representative. The first ECS (known as the Establishment Survey on Working Time and Work-Life Balance, 2004 - 2005, held under SN 5655) covered workplace practices with regard to working time arrangements and work-life balance. The second ECS, carried out in 2009 (SN 6568), looked at different forms of flexibility as well as accompanying human resource management practices and the nature and quality of workplace social dialogue. The third ECS (SN 7735), carried out in spring 2013, looked at practices with regard to work organisation, human resources management, employee participation and social dialogue in European workplaces. Further information about the ECS {{can be found on the}} Eurofound European Company Surveys webpages. The first ECS : The Establishment Survey on Working Time and Work-Life Balance, 2004 - 2005 is the first survey in the series and was conducted in the 15 existing EU member states (EU 15) and 6 of the new states who joined the EU in 2004 : Cyprus, Czech Republic, Hungary, Latvia, Poland and Slovenia. The topics to be covered in detail were agreed between TNS Infratest Sozialforschung, who conducted the first survey on behalf of the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions (EFILWC), the research team and advisory committee at EFILWC, and a group of experts from various countries. It was agreed to focus on the following working time arrangements which are likely to have an impact on work-life balance: part-time work extended operating hours (night work, week-end work, shift work) flexible working time arrangements (e. g. flexi-time, working time accounts) overtime childcare leave and other forms of long-term leave <b>phased</b> <b>retirement</b> and <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> For these working time arrangements, information about the incidence at establishment level was collected and (where it made sense and was possible within the given restrictions of the length of the questionnaire) information about the reasons for the introduction, the practical experiences and details of the regulations. Main Topics : Two questionnaires were fielded as part of the first ESWT survey. The management questionnaire, conducted with the most senior member of staff with responsibility for personnel at each establishment, covered background and demographic information about the organisation, variations of workload and other questions related to work organisation, part-time work, extended operating hours and work at 'unsocial hours', working time accounts and flexible working time arrangements, overtime, childcare leave and long-term leave, <b>phased</b> and <b>early</b> <b>retirement,</b> and measures to facilitate work-life balance.

40|$|<b>Early</b> <b>retirement</b> {{from the}} labour force has become {{standard}} practice for most {{employees in the}} industrialised world. However, {{as a result of}} the rising costs of <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> schemes, curbing the outflow of older workers from the labour force has become a central government policy objective. <b>Early</b> <b>retirement</b> reforms under which benefits are financed on a more actuarially neutral basis are currently being implemented in the Netherlands.

On the basis of a labour market and a population survey we examine retirement intentions under alternative <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> policies. The overall conclusion is that the retirement reform may lead to a substantial delay of the retirement date, but that in practice more forces than the financial incentives are at work.

Data sources were existing university administrative data files, combined with interviews from a random sample of seventy-two early retirees and eligible nonretirees. Results of the study are summarized below: (1) In general, demographic characteristics studied (age, sex, marital and health status, etc.) were not strong predictors of <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> decisions among the respondents. (2) Faculty salary was not a strong predictor of <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> behavior. (3) Self reported faculty productivity was a strong predictor of <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> decision-making.

Finincial crises and recessions set much higher requirements toward financial stability of the enterprise. In their search to regain stability and improve performance, companies utilize various operating and financing solutions.

In the sixteen-months period from January 2001 to April 2002, more than 36, 000 older individuals went into <b>early</b> <b>retirement.</b> They represent 8 % of all workers within nine years of the legal retirement age. One of the most important determinants of <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> is the wage rate, yet its effect is not linear: both high and low wages reduce the probability of an <b>early</b> <b>retirement.</b> Other factors such as a partner's employment status, education, industry, occupation, and coverage in the three social-security pillars also play an important role. A main finding of this study is that about 30 % of all early retirees continue working after retirement- and mostly for their same employer...|$|R
40|$|Generous <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> {{provisions}} {{account for}} {{a large proportion of}} the drop in the labour force participation of elderly workers. The aim of this paper is to provide a political-economic explanation of the wide spread adoption of <b>early</b> <b>retirement.</b> We suggest that the political support for generous <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> provisions relies on: (i) the existence of an initial, significant group of redundant elderly workers with incomplete working history, who are not entitled to an old age pension; and (ii) the policy persistence that this provision introduces by inducing low-ability workers to retire early. The majority which supports a social security system with <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> in a bidimensional voting game is composed of elderly workers with incomplete working history and low-ability workers. A descriptive analysis of eleven OECD countries confirms the relevance of the initial group of redundant elderly workers. <b>Early</b> <b>retirement</b> provisions were adopted during the deindustrialization process, almost always, immediately after the first severe decrease in industrial employment.

40|$|The {{retirement}} {{decisions of}} individuals are {{strongly influenced by}} spousal retirement, financial incentives and institutional constraints such as access to <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> benefits. In the European Union (EU), farm retirement is encouraged by <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> provisions for farmers. As exit from farming determines the characteristics of structural change in agriculture, {{it is important to}} find out how spousal retirement and economic incentives affect the timing and type of retirement decisions among elderly farmers. This paper analyses the timing of <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> decisions of farming couples using duration analysis and different exit channels. The empirical analysis is based on Finnish farm-level panel data for the period 1993 - 1998. The results suggest that an expected pension particularly advances farm transfers. Farming couples are found to co-ordinate their <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> according to spousal retirement under other pension schemes. duration, <b>early</b> <b>retirement,</b> farming couple, succession, Farm Management, Labor and Human Capital, J 26, Q 12, C 41,...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study, {{performed}} in a Swedish munici-pality. was to obtain a view of <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> pensioners, focusing on immigration and socio-economy as predictors of <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> pensions. A questionnaire was sent to 453 <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> pensioners with disorders of the musculoskeletal system. A correspond-ing questionnaire {{was sent to a}} randomly selected, age- and sex-matched control group of the same size. The response rate was 838. The study concludes that immigration and low socio-economy are predictors of <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> pension (ERP). The rate of immigrants was 19 % among the ERPs compared to 5 % among the controls. The early retired immigrants were comparatively young, and some of them were overqualified for their previous jobs. Of the ERPs 74 % were blue-collar workers compared to 3 9 4 of the controls. Neither work satisfaction nor unem-ployment was found to predict ERP.

40|$|Objectives Determinants in {{the domains}} health, job characteristics, skills, {{and social and}} {{financial}} factors may influence <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> through three central explanatory variables, namely, the ability, motivation, and opportunity to work. Based on the literature, we created the <b>Early</b> <b>Retirement</b> Model. This study aims to investigate whether data support the model and {{how it could be}} improved. Methods Employees aged 58 – 62 years (N= 1862), who participated in the first three waves of the Dutch Study on Transitions in Employment, Ability and Motivation (STREAM) were included. Determinants were assessed at baseline, central explanatory variables after one year, and <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> after two years. Structural equation modeling was applied. Results Testing the <b>Early</b> <b>Retirement</b> Model resulted in a model with good fit. Health, job characteristics, skills, and social and financial factors were related to the ability, motivation and/or opportunity to work (significant β range: 0. 05 – 0. 31). Lower work ability (β= - 0. 13) and less opportunity to work (attitude colleagues and supervisor about working until age 65 : β= - 0. 24) predicted <b>early</b> <b>retirement,</b> whereas the motivation to work (work engagement) did not. The model could be improved by adding direct effects of three determinants on <b>early</b> <b>retirement,</b> ie, support of colleagues and supervisor (β= 0. 14), positive attitude of the partner with respect to <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> (β= 0. 15), and not having a partner (β= - 0. 13). Conclusions The <b>Early</b> <b>Retirement</b> Model was largely supported by the data but could be improved. The prolongation of working life might be promoted by work-related interventions focusing on health, work ability, the social work climate, social norms on prolonged careers, and the learning environmen...|$|R
