A dock holds the iPad upright at an angle, and has a dock connector and audio line out port. Each generation of iPad requires a corresponding dock. A dock that included a <b>physical</b> <b>keyboard</b> was only supported for the original iPad, but all generations are compatible with Bluetooth keyboards that also work with Macs and PCs. The iPad can be charged by a standalone power adapter ("wall charger") also used for iPods and iPhones, and a 10 W charger is included with the iPad.|$|E

5|$|The {{smartphone}} considerably reduces its predecessor's sizes, measuring 4.3 by 2.4 by 6 inches (10.92, 6.09 and 15.24 centimeters, respectively). The Bold 9700 has a 624MHz {{processor and}} a 256MB Flash memory. The device uses a 2.44 inch HVGA (approximately 6.1cm) non-touch LCD display at {{a resolution of}} 480×360 pixels. The resolution of the display was {{compared to that of}} HTC Magic, as it has also HVGA quality. The model changes its predecessor's trackball to an optical trackpad, with simple functionalities such as swiping the thumb to move it and press it to make a selection. This change prevented problems including the accumulation of dust behind the trackball. Similarly to previous BlackBerry models, BlackBerry 9700 has a 35-key QWERTY-type <b>physical</b> <b>keyboard,</b> which is smaller than that of Bold 9000. On the top of the device, there are two buttons that respectively lock or mute it; {{on the right side of}} it, rubberized keys are found, which can either control the audio volume or the music player; further down, there is a camera shutter key. Cosmetic changes including the addition of a leatherette battery cover were carried out in order to appeal both sexes.|$|E

25|$|The BlackBerry Priv {{received}} mixed reviews. Critics {{praised the}} Priv's user experience for incorporating BlackBerry's traditional, productivity-oriented features {{on top of}} the standard Android experience, including a notifications feed and custom e-mail client. Some critics felt that the device's <b>physical</b> <b>keyboard</b> did not perform as well as those on previous BlackBerry devices, and that the Priv's performance was not up to par with other devices using the same system-on-chip. The Priv was also criticized for being more expensive than similarly-equipped devices in its class.|$|E
25|$|The Priv is {{the first}} BlackBerry-branded {{smartphone}} that does not run the company's proprietary BlackBerry OS or BlackBerry 10 (BB10) platforms. It instead uses Android, customized with features inspired by those on BlackBerry phones, and security enhancements. With its use of Android—one of two smartphone platforms that significantly impacted BlackBerry's early dominance in the smartphone industry—the company sought to leverage access to the larger ecosystem of software available through the Google Play Store (as opposed to BlackBerry 10 devices, which were limited to native BB10 apps from BlackBerry World and Android apps from the third-party Amazon Appstore running in a compatibility subsystem), in combination with a slide-out <b>physical</b> <b>keyboard</b> and privacy-focused features.|$|E
500|$|In July 2005, Google {{acquired}} Android Inc., {{a company}} led by Andy Rubin which {{was working on}} unspecified software for mobile devices. Under the leadership of Google, the team {{was in the process}} of developing a standardized, Linux-based operating system for mobile phones to compete against the likes of Symbian and Windows Mobile, which would be offered for use by individual original equipment manufacturers. Initial development of what would become Android was targeted towards a prototype device codenamed [...] "Sooner"; the device was a messaging phone in the style of BlackBerry, with a small, non-touch screen, navigation keys, and a physical QWERTY keyboard. The January 2007 unveiling of the iPhone, Apple's first smartphone, and its pioneering design aspects, caught Rubin off-guard and led to a change in course for the project. The operating system's design was quickly reworked, and attention shifted to a new prototype device codenamed [...] "Dream"—a touchscreen device with a sliding, <b>physical</b> <b>keyboard.</b> The inclusion of a <b>physical</b> <b>keyboard</b> was intentional, as Android developers recognized users did not like the idea of a virtual keyboard as they lacked the physical feedback that makes hardware keyboards useful.|$|E
40|$|Attacks {{that use}} side channels, such as sound and {{electromagnetic}} emanation, to infer keystrokes on <b>physical</b> <b>keyboards</b> are ineffective on smartphones without <b>physical</b> <b>keyboards.</b> We describe a new side channel, motion, on touch screen smartphones with only soft keyboards. Since typing on different locations {{on the screen}} causes different vibrations, motion data {{can be used to}} infer the keys being typed. To demonstrate this attack, we developed TouchLogger, an Android application that extracts features from device orientation data to infer keystrokes. TouchLogger correctly inferred more than 70 % of the keys typed on a number-only soft keyboard on a smartphone. We hope to raise the awareness of motion as a significant side channel that may leak confidential data. ...|$|R

2500|$|In late-April 2016, BlackBerry {{began to}} release an upgrade to Android 6.0 [...] "Marshmallow"; along with {{features}} {{added to the}} core Android platform (which includes a new permissions system, and systems to reduce background activity when the device is not being physically handled to conserve battery power), it adds S/MIME, Slack, Skype, and Pinterest support to BlackBerry Hub, slide input on the <b>physical</b> <b>keyboard,</b> faster autofocus, and 24fps and 120fps video recording modes.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{computer}} keyboards {{are designed to}} send scancodes to the operating system, rather than directly sending characters. From there, the series of scancodes is converted into a character stream by keyboard layout software. [...] This allows a <b>physical</b> <b>keyboard</b> to be dynamically mapped to any number of layouts without switching hardware components – merely by changing the software that interprets the keystrokes. It is usually possible for an advanced user to change keyboard operation, and third-party software is available to modify or extend keyboard functionality.|$|E

(The Priv could also be upgraded to 6.0) This device featured a 5.2-inch full high-definition display. BlackBerry chief security officer David Kleidermacher stressed data security during the launch, indicating that this model included built-in malware protection and encryption of all user information. Industry observers pointed out that the DTEK50 is a re-branded version of the Alcatel Idol 4 with additional security-oriented software customizations, manufactured and designed by TCL.|$|E
2500|$|The LG Optimus One is an {{entry-level}} {{series of}} touch-screen smartphones manufactured by LG Electronics, Inc. It was released running the Android 2.2 Froyo, and later LG released software to upgrade it to Android 2.3 Gingerbread. Cyanogenmod 7.2 supports the phone.

Versions of the Optimus One exist that operate on various frequency bands and either GSM or CDMA-based network protocols.

40|$|This study {{presents}} {{an evaluation of}} user performance and satisfaction of three <b>physical</b> <b>keyboards</b> that accompany two popular tablet computers. All keyboards were dual purpose in that they served as tablet covers in addition to typing input devices. The keyboards varied in weight, thickness, and key travel. The thinnest keyboard featured durability and pressure-sensitive keys while the other two keyboards were slightly thicker, but used mechanical keys. Participants unfamiliar with the keyboards were asked to type a series of phrases on each keyboard after a short practice. Typing performance, and perceived usability and workload were assessed. Results show a clear advantage in both performance and satisfaction for the mechanical-key keyboards. Users demonstrated typing speeds approximately 10 words per minute (WPM) slower and were prone to typing errors such as incorrect key substitutions, omissions, and inadvertent insertions with the thinner, pressure-sensitive keyboard. In addition, users reported the flat keyboard was more mentally demanding, more frustrating, and required more effort to use. Results from this study reveal the importance of tactile feedback to user typing performance and satisfaction. Designers of tablet <b>physical</b> <b>keyboards</b> must assess the tradeoff between optimal keyboard size, weight, and thickness, and a design that affords accurate typing...|$|R
