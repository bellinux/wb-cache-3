25|$|There {{are many}} {{physical}} separation processes {{similar to the}} belt filter press used for dewatering, including centrifuges, vacuum-disc filters, and the <b>plate</b> <b>and</b> <b>frame</b> <b>filter</b> press. When compared to other compression filters, belt filters use relatively lower pressures. Although centrifuges have lower moisture content, lower costs and simpler operations in coal tails processing, belt filters tend to make less noise and have much quicker startup and shutdown times.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} main basic types of filter presses: <b>plate</b> <b>and</b> <b>frame</b> <b>filter</b> presses, {{recessed}} <b>plate</b> <b>and</b> <b>frame</b> <b>filter</b> presses and automatic filter presses.|$|E
50|$|<b>Plate</b> <b>and</b> <b>frame</b> <b>filter</b> press produce up to 99% of solids recovery, and the {{moisture}} {{left in the}} cake commonly ranges from 15% to 20%. During cake washing, 90% of the filtrate can be removed by the wash liquid.|$|E
40|$|The {{carbonatation}} {{process at}} the Huletts refinery (Hulref) consists of adding a slurry of calcium hydroxide in water to the raw melt solution, to a desired pH. Carbon dioxide gas is then bubbled into the sugar solution, in saturators, under controlled conditions of alkalinity and temperature. Separation of the clear liquor and the calcium carbonate is done by filtration. The filter station at the refinery consists of 13 rotary leaf <b>filters</b> <b>and</b> four <b>plate</b> <b>and</b> <b>frame</b> <b>filters.</b> The performance of these filters has been deteriorating due to age and lack of maintenance. As a result there is a carryover of impurities which adversely affects {{the performance of the}} resin plant and also refined sugar quality. Options were considered regarding the way forward with the filter station. The installation of new filters was considered. Currently fully automated membrane filter presses are available that carry out both the filtration and de-sweetening of the calcium carbonate cake in one filtration step. This has major advantages in terms of operating personnel, liquor quality and quality of the filter cake. The new filters would reduce the moisture of the filter cake from 52 % to less than 30 %. The loss of sugar in the cake would also be reduced. This paper describes the pilot plant tests that were done. The results from these tests were used to scale up for the full-scale installation...|$|R
50|$|Lautering is the {{separation}} of the wort (the liquid containing the sugar extracted during mashing) from the grains. This is done either in a mash tun outfitted with a false bottom, in a lauter tun, or in a mash filter. Most separation processes have two stages: first wort run-off, during which the extract is separated in an undiluted state from the spent grains, and sparging, in which extract which remains with the grains is rinsed off with hot water. The lauter tun is a tank with holes in the bottom small enough to hold back the large bits of grist and hulls. The bed of grist that settles on it is the actual filter. Some lauter tuns have provision for rotating rakes or knives to cut into the bed of grist to maintain good flow. The knives can be turned so they push the grain, a feature used to drive the spent grain out of the vessel. The mash filter is a plate-and-frame <b>filter.</b> The empty <b>frames</b> contain the mash, including the spent grains, and have a capacity of around one hectoliter. The plates contain a support structure for the <b>filter</b> cloth. The <b>plates,</b> <b>frames,</b> <b>and</b> <b>filter</b> cloths are arranged in a carrier frame like so: frame, cloth, plate, cloth, with plates {{at each end of the}} structure. Newer mash filters have bladders that can press the liquid out of the grains between spargings. The grain does not act like a filtration medium in a mash filter.|$|R

5000|$|A <b>plate</b> <b>and</b> <b>frame</b> <b>filter</b> {{press is}} the most {{fundamental}} design, and many now refer it as a [...] "membrane filter plate". This type of filter press consists of many plates and frames assembled alternately with the supports {{of a pair of}} rails. The presence of a centrifuge pump ensures the remaining suspended solids do not settle in the system, and its main function is to deliver the suspension into each of the separating chambers in the <b>plate</b> <b>and</b> <b>frame</b> <b>filter.</b> For each of the individual separating chambers, there is one hollow filter frame separated from two filter plates by filter cloths. The introduced slurry flows through a port in each individual frame, and the filter cakes are accumulated in each hollow frame. As the filter cake becomes thicker, the filter resistance increases as well. So when the separating chamber is full, the filtration process is stopped as the optimum pressure difference is reached. The filtrate that passes through filter cloth is collected through collection pipes and stored in the filter tank. Filter cake (suspended solid) accumulation occurs at the hollow plate frame, then being separated at the filter plates by pulling the <b>plate</b> <b>and</b> <b>frame</b> <b>filter</b> press apart. The cakes then fall off from those plates and are discharged to the final collection point.|$|E
50|$|Typical cloth {{areas can}} range from 1 m2 or less on {{laboratory}} scale to 1000 m2 in a production environment, even though plates can provide filter areas up to 2000 m2. Normally, <b>plate</b> <b>and</b> <b>frame</b> <b>filter</b> press can form up to 50 mm of cake thickness, however, it can be push up to 200 mm for extreme cases. Recessed plate press can form up to 32 mm of cake thickness.|$|E

50|$|Membrane modules for {{dead-end}} flow microfiltration {{are mainly}} plate-and-frame configurations. They possess a flat and thin-film composite sheet where the plate is asymmetric. A thin selective skin is supported on a thicker layer that has larger pores. These systems are compact and possess a sturdy design, Compared to cross-flow filtration, <b>plate</b> <b>and</b> <b>frame</b> configurations possess a reduced capital expenditure; however the operating {{costs will be}} higher. The uses of <b>plate</b> <b>and</b> <b>frame</b> modules are most applicable for smaller and simpler scale applications (laboratory) which filter dilute solutions.|$|R
30|$|<b>Plate</b> <b>and</b> <b>frame</b> {{filtration}} presses {{working at}} the pressure of approximately 410 – 550  mPa are basic operation units, used by industrial FPH producers in order to purify protein fraction of hydrolysates from different impurities. As for investigations considering such a filtration for any studies with FPH, the information is very limited by a few publications (Chakraborty and Madhavan 1977; Loosen et al. 1994). It explains {{by the fact that}} <b>plate</b> <b>and</b> <b>frame</b> filtration is rather a technological step at a large production than a matter of investigation.|$|R
5000|$|An {{automatic}} {{filter press}} {{has the same}} concept as the manual filter and frame filter, except that the whole process is fully automated. It consists of larger <b>plate</b> <b>and</b> <b>frame</b> <b>filter</b> presses with mechanical [...] "plate shifters". The function of the plate shifter is to move the plates and allow rapid discharge of the filter cakes accumulated in between the plates. It also contains a diaphragm compressor in the filter plates which aids in optimizing the operating condition by further drying the filter cakes. An animation showing this principal of operation can be seen here.|$|E
50|$|A {{recessed}} plate filter press {{is made up}} of polypropylene squares at about 2 to 4 feet across with a concave depression and a hole in the center of each. Two plates join together to form a chamber to pressurize the slurry and squeeze the filtrate out through the filter cloth lining in the chamber. It is capable of holding 12 to 80 plates adjacent to each other, depending on the required capacity. When the filter press is closed, a series of chambers is formed. The differences with the <b>plate</b> <b>and</b> <b>frame</b> <b>filter</b> are that the plates are joined together {{in such a way that}} the cake forms in the recess on each plate, meaning that the cake thickness is restricted to 32mm unless extra frames are used as spacers. However, there are disadvantages to this method, such as longer cloth changing time, inability to accommodate filter papers, and the possibility of forming uneven cake.|$|E
40|$|Decolourisation at the Malelane {{cane sugar}} {{refinery}} {{is achieved by}} conventional carbonatation and cationic polyamine flocculant followed by light sulphitation. This technology is adequate to produce EEC 2 specification refined sugar. However, occasional high input raw sugar colour increases the blended sugar colour to above the specification limit. Under these conditions the fourth sugar is rejected and only again accepted for blending once the combined sugar colour is within the specification limit. Powdered activated carbon (PAC) is an established decolourising agent for sugar application. However, its once-off use contributes to its high operating cost and therefore limits wider use. The intermittent nature of the out of specification colour problem has prompted interest in PAC as an ad hoc additive for use during problem periods. PAC application requires carbon dosage equipment, contacting tanks and dedicated filters. The main purpose of this test work has been to determine whether PAC can be applied as an additive into the existing process {{without the need for}} any new equipment. For this reason, dosage directly into carbonated liquor prior to filtration was made the main focus area. After initial laboratory screening tests, a carbonated liquor slip-stream was treated with PAC and filtered in a pilot plant <b>plate</b> <b>and</b> <b>frame</b> <b>filter</b> unit alongside the factory pressure leaf filters. The decolourisation results obtained from laboratory testing and pilot plant performance have shown that PAC activity is not inhibited in the presence of carbonatation sludge and therefore could be used on an ad hoc basis to decolourise unfiltered carbonated liquor during periods of high input sugar colour...|$|E

40|$|About 10, 000 t of {{grinding}} scraps {{are produced}} {{in and around}} Turin each year. Grinding scraps result fromhigh speed tool cutting processes in the automobile and aerospace industries in which a fluid, called lubrorefrigerant oil, is used to cool the cutting tool. At present, grinding scraps are landfilled with an involved cost of 60 D /t, because the oil content (equal to 6. 40 % byweight, b. w.) does not permit recovery in secondary smelt furnaces. Secondary smelt foundries in fact only accept turnings, borings, scraps and oily machinery waste with an oil content no higher than 1 % b. w. The lubrorefrigerant fluid and heavy metal content of some grinding scrap samples have been determined. The characterized waste was then subjected to several laboratory tests in order to single out the most convenient operating conditions; these resulted to be: solid-liquid ratio 1 : 20 b. w., one washing phase, surfactant amount equal to 0. 15 % b. w. (of the washing water amount), solid-rinsing water ratio 1 : 20 b. w., employment of docusate sodium salt. The obtained results allowed a wet treatment to be arranged aimed at removing the cooling/cutting fluid from the waste and at a subsequent recovery or recycling the steel. The wet treatment involves a washing phase in a stirred reactor {{in the presence of}} docusate sodium salt, a filtration in a <b>plate</b> <b>and</b> <b>frame</b> <b>filter</b> for the solid separation and a final rinse in order to eliminate the residual surfactant amount. The treated material is finally pressed to minimize the residual moisture content. The oil is separated from the exhausted washing water using a cloth filter. The oily sludge is eventually landfilled. A cost analysis, carried out on the proposed reclamation plant, highlighted the economic advantage of the treatment (total annual plant operating costs are equal to about 40 D /t of treated grinding scrap) in comparison to the landfilling operation...|$|E
40|$|Anodising is an {{important}} finishing technique used to produce controlled oxide coating on aluminium extrusions which impart aesthetic finish, longer life and resistance to corrosion and abrasion. The anodising process however leads to generation of significant amounts of acid and alkaline waste containing mainly aluminium. Normally these wastes are neutralised producing aluminium hydroxide sludge the disposal of which is problematic. Finex is New Zealand's most recently developed anodising plant established in Hamilton in 2004. During the first period of operation the company {{was faced with a}} costly sludge disposal problem. The present project was devised to study their production plant and wastewater treatment plant. A brief study of the sludge showed that even under optimum conditions and with use of polyelectrolyte, gravity settling produced excessive volumes of sludge. The decision was made to install a <b>plate</b> <b>and</b> <b>frame</b> <b>filter</b> press. With the reduction of its bulk by dewatering, the problem of sludge disposal was essentially solved. However the 12 tonnes per week of dewatered sludge production still posed the challenge of devising a way of using the material beneficially. The characteristics of the sludge were determined and routes to commodity products were investigated. Commodity alum was produced in good yield at 4 C by treatment of the sludge with sulphuric acid followed by crystallisation with anhydrous potassium sulphate. The product was very similar to the commercial product. Under basic conditions, sodium aluminate was produced by adding stoichiometric amount of OH-. Under acid conditions at the H+/Al(OH) 3 stoichiometric ratio of 3, 95 % of the aluminium was recovered as aluminium salt solution. When acid addition was less than the stoichiometric ratio of 3, the polyelectrolyte containing sludge showed little tendency to re-suspend. A variety of mechanical and thermal methods was used in an attempt to disaggregate and re-suspend the sludge. These included ultrasonic treatment at 80 C at frequency 14 kHz for 6 hours, autoclaving the sludge in electrical furnace at 150 C for 6 hours, homogenisation at 3000 rpm for 30 minutes at 20 C and mechanical grinding using mortar and pestle at 20 C. The ultrasonic treatment was effective in re-suspending 30 % of the sludge. The other treatments were largely ineffective. On comparing the heavy metal concentration present in the original anodising sludge with the heavy metal concentration in the recovered commodity products, it was found that heavy metal content reduction was achieved with the alum crystallisation process. On producing aluminate, Cd, Mg and Ni were reduced through the removal of insoluble hydroxides. Minimal reduction of heavy metal content was achieved in the acidic aluminium chloride solution. The acidic and alkaline products prepared from anodising sludge were tested for their usefulness as coagulation agents. Critical coagulation concentrations for kaolin suspensions for all products were determined to be 5 mg/L. For all systems except the ultrasonic re-suspended sludge, clear solutions of low turbidity resulted after 1 hour standing. An analysis of the cost recovery of various commodity products from waste sludge indicated that recovery of acid aluminium chloride solution was most cost effective while the recovery of alum produces the purest product. Assuming that the acid aluminium chloride solution could be substituted for and sold at the same per kg of aluminium price as polyaluminium chloride, a 52 % margin over consumables cost allows the possibility of a modest profit. The main benefit to Finex from proceeding with a sludge recovery program however is likely to be enhancement of the companies green credentials...|$|E
