The force initially sailed to Gibraltar and, with the intention of establishing naval superiority in the Mediterranean, made their way to Toulon, anchoring off the port in July. Toulon was largely under the control of moderate republicans and royalists, but was threatened by the forces of the National Convention, which were marching on the city. Short of supplies and doubting their ability to defend themselves, the city authorities requested that Hood take it under his <b>protection.</b> <b>Hood</b> readily acquiesced and sent Nelson to carry dispatches to Sardinia and Naples requesting reinforcements. After delivering the dispatches to Sardinia, Agamemnon arrived at Naples in early September. There Nelson met Ferdinand IV, King of Naples, followed by the British ambassador to the kingdom, William Hamilton. At some point during the negotiations for reinforcements, Nelson was introduced to Hamilton's new wife, Emma Hamilton. The negotiations were successful, and 2,000 men and several ships were mustered by mid-September. Nelson put to sea in pursuit of a French frigate, but on failing to catch her, sailed for Leghorn, and then to Corsica. He arrived at Toulon on 5 October, where he found that a large French army had occupied the hills surrounding the city and was bombarding it. Hood still hoped the city could be held if more reinforcements arrived, and sent Nelson to join a squadron operating off Cagliari.|$|E
5000|$|Currently, {{language}} in German as in English, tauchen = [...] "diving" [...] only means in water.

50|$|Another {{operational}} area is fire protection, {{for instance in}} chemical industry or rescue in the mining industry, where need for a long use duration forbids use of compressed air sets. Advancements in rebreather design include special more-or-less complex gas proportioning and control devices, allowing use even deeper and even longer, for work divers, than emergency breathing sets {{and the type of}} sport diving called technical diving.

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references (leaves 51 - 53). Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. A prototype perforated backplane air baffle for a laboratory safety hood was designed, fabricated and its performance was evaluated experimentally. Relative to the historically poor performance of slot baffle design, the perforated metal created better laminar flow through the hood, and decreased turbulence in the form of vortices, ultimately resulting in better hood containment. New performance monitoring techniques were developed to aid in future testing of improved laboratory fume hood designs. Three methods were employed to evaluate the hood's performance: 1) face velocity testing, 2) tracer gas containment testing, and 3) smoke containment. Face velocity data was analyzed to evaluate turbulence and consistency across the hood face with the use of new statistical methods described in this thesis. It was determined that turbulence decreased and velocity uniformity increased as the average face velocity increased and as the open area of the hood face decreased. Tracer gas levels outside of the hood, in the operator's breathing zone, were kept below detectable levels (0. 02 ppm) at all face velocity / sash position settings. In this work, a <b>Hood</b> <b>Protection</b> Factor was developed as a quantitative means to compare hood performance. The <b>Hood</b> <b>Protection</b> Factor is a true ratio of the contaminant concentration inside the hood exhaust duct to that in the operator's breathing zone, as both are measured values. A qualitative assessment of the hood's performance was completed by means of smoke testing. Smoke testing showed that smoke was captured / retained without escaping from the hood at all face velocity / sash position settings. Static pressure measurements were taken at the back panel of the hood. Graphical analysis of this data allowed visualization of the uniformity of suction across the perforated air baffle. The prototype backplane air baffle provided reduced turbulence at the hood face, allowing improved containment efficiency. New performance monitoring techniques and statistical evaluation methods were developed so health and safety professionals may better evaluate and design laboratory fume hoods...|$|R
5000|$|Production of the GT-Four (or {{previously}} {{known as}} All-Trac in the US), continued for the Japanese, Australian, European, and British markets.

Influenced strongly by Toyota Team Europe, Toyota's factory team in the World Rally Championship, {{the final version of the}} GT-Four included improvements such as an all-aluminum hood to save weight, four-channel ABS (with G-force sensor), an improved turbocharger (incorrectly known by enthusiasts as the CT20B), and Super Strut Suspension. The 2500 homologation cars built to allow Toyota to enter the GT-Four as a Group A car in the World Rally Championship also sported extras such as all of the plumbing required to activate an anti-lag system, a water spray bar for the Intercooler's front heat exchanger, a water injection system for detonation <b>protection,</b> a <b>hood</b> spoiler mounted in front of the windscreen to stop hood flex at high speed and the standard rear spoiler mounted on riser blocks. The car proved to be quite competitive in the 1995 World Championship. However, the team was banned from competition for a year after the car's single victory due to turbocharger fixing - a device that meant there was no air path restriction on the intake - when the jubilee clip was undone this would flick back into place so as to go un-noticed by inspectors. Toyota has always claimed that they knew nothing of the fix - but opponents say it was one very cleverly engineered device. In some respects this car is a true sports car; in order to qualify for rallying it has a lot of special features and a unique strut arrangement.|$|R

40|$|Nearly {{one third}} of all conchs of Anthoceras buchi (Lesnikowa, 1949) from Baltoscandia display healed apertural breakages. Often {{multiple}} of these repair scars {{can be found in}} single conchs. Most of the scars are less than 2 mm deep, but deeper slit-like repaired breakages occasionally occur. Small injuries are usually around the entire apertural circumference, but the larger scars are concentrated at the ventral side of the conch, which is interpreted as result of a <b>protection</b> from a <b>hood.</b> The adult diameter of Anthoceras buchi is > 40 mm. Conch regions that exceed 30 mm in diameter rarely contain evidence of multiple repair scars. The relative frequency of deep healed breakages is highest at regions with diameters of 25 â€“ 30 mm. This pattern is interpreted as evidence for a size limitation of the predator: large specimens with conch diameters above 30 mm had a considerably lower risk to get injured and the preserved injuries were less severe. This potentially explains the strong evolutionary trend of size increase in endocerids during the Lower to Middle Ordovician as escalation between them and shell breaking predators. Additionally, a specimen of Anthoceras buchi is described and figured, which displays colour marks with a mottled pattern. doi: 10. 1002 /mmng. 201100001 </a...|$|R

Among the {{car accident}} casualties, Pedestrian occupied {{a large proportion}} of the injuries. Pedestrian protection became a key problem of vehicle safety. The engine hood was the most possible zone impacted by the head of pedestrian. The pedestrian <b>protection</b> of engine <b>hood</b> was an important performance of vehicle. The active engine hood was used to improve the pedestrian protection performance of vehicle and to meet the regulations. In the lifting system of active engine hood, springs were used to improve the pedestrian protection performance. A design optimization method about the spring stiffness used in active engine hood was developed in this research. The spring stiffness of K was set as design variable, and its interval was set 1 ~ 50 N/mm. The impacting zones of engine hood where HIC values of original engine hood were higher than the mean values of corresponding child and adult zones were selected as the cases of optimization. The objective was to minimize the sum of HIC values of those selected zones. The first type of constraints was that the HIC values of child zones were less than the mean HIC value of child zones. The second type of constraints was that the HIC values of adult zones were less than the mean HIC value of adult zones. The spring stiffness optimization model about active hood based on pedestrian protection was constructed and solved. The results of optimization indicated that the obtained spring stiffness by this method improved the pedestrian protection performance of engine hood...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} the main {{problems associated with}} passenger survival and evacuation in survivable aircraft fire situations under current regulatory safety requirements and assesses current and alternative strategies to combat cabin fire, and assist evacuation, {{with a view to}} identifying a best alternative strategy. The technical and management findings associated with a research programme which was conducted into passenger smoke <b>hood</b> <b>protection</b> are then described. The survival/evacuation/pathology aspects associated with 10 selected accidents to public transport aircraft which involved fire are reviewed at the outset of this study in order to set forth the attendant problems of survival in such situations. The pathology and toxicological findings associated with these accidents are then discussed. The assembled information is then analysed with a view towards identifying the key problems inherent in survival and evacuation from aircraft fires, including those which stem from survivable in-flight fires. The current regulatory requirements and associated strategies relating to occupant survival/evacuation are then critically reviewed against the key problems identified. A review of alternative strategies is then conducted and an assessment made of technical potential, related cost-benefit data, problems still to be resolved and possible timescales for implementation. A'best-strategy'is then selected. The potential benefits of this strategy are then set forth in terms of its relevance to the survival/evacuation problems identified, associated cost-effectiveness, potential synergy with existing, and possible future, requirements and implementation timescale. A review of data on aircraft fires is then conducted, including that associated with the thermochemical characteristics of such combustion atmospheres and related effects on animals and humans. Using this data, the approach used to develop a set of acceptance criteria for aircraft passenger smoke hood designs is described. In addition, the way in which a challenge combustion atmosphere model was developed, and against which filter-type smoke hoods could be tested, is described.

40|$|Turnout gear {{provides}} {{protection against}} dermal exposure to contaminants during firefighting; however, {{the level of}} protection is unknown. We explored the dermal contribution to the systemic dose of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and other aromatic hydrocarbons in firefighters during suppression and overhaul of controlled structure burns. The study was organized into two rounds, three controlled burns per round, and five firefighters per burn. The firefighters wore new or laundered turnout gear tested before each burn to ensure lack of PAH contamination. To ensure that any increase in systemic PAH levels after the burn {{was the result of}} dermal rather than inhalation exposure, the firefighters did not remove their self-contained breathing apparatus until overhaul was completed and they were > 30 m upwind from the burn structure. Specimens were collected before and at intervals after the burn for biomarker analysis. Urine was analyzed for phenanthrene equivalents using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and a benzene metabolite (s-phenylmercapturic acid) using liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry; both were adjusted by creatinine. Exhaled breath collected on thermal desorption tubes was analyzed for PAHs and other aromatic hydrocarbons using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. We collected personal air samples during the burn and skin wipe samples (corn oil medium) on several body sites before and after the burn. The air and wipe samples were analyzed for PAHs using a liquid chromatography with photodiode array detection. We explored possible changes in external exposures or biomarkers over time and the relationships between these variables using non-parametric sign tests and Spearman tests, respectively. We found significantly elevated (P < 0. 05) post-exposure breath concentrations of benzene compared with pre-exposure concentrations for both rounds. We also found significantly elevated post-exposure levels of PAHs on the neck compared with pre-exposure levels for round 1. We found statistically significant positive correlations between external exposures (i. e. personal air concentrations of PAHs) and biomarkers (i. e. change in urinary PAH metabolite levels in round 1 and change in breath concentrations of benzene in round 2). The results suggest that firefighters wearing full protective ensembles absorbed combustion products into their bodies. The PAHs most likely entered firefighters' bodies through their skin, with the neck being the primary site of exposure and absorption due to the lower level of dermal <b>protection</b> afforded by <b>hoods.</b> Aromatic hydrocarbons could have been absorbed dermally during firefighting or inhaled during the doffing of gear that was off-gassing contaminants...|$|R
