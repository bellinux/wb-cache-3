This may be displayed in the cockpit or cabin to allow the aircrew to monitor the aircraft in flight, and is usually recorded to allow the data to be analysed later.FTI typically monitors between 10 and 120000 parameters - for example temperatures inside the cargo and pressure distribution along the wing. FTI sources could be temperature sensors, <b>pressure</b> <b>probes,</b> voltages, current transducers, potentiometers, strain gauges, aircraft data buses or cameras. These sensors may be digitalized and acquired by the data acquisition system. A cockpit audio recording may also be included.

50|$|After {{returning}} to Douglas, he proposed and began studies for a tailless aircraft. These studies {{culminated in the}} design and production of the F4D-1 Skyray interceptor. For a period, the F4D-1 held six FAI World Records, including absolute speed and climb performance. In 1948, he became the Supervisor of Design Research at Douglas, a position he held until 1954. During this period, he conducted research into a number of areas, including laminar flow control and a means of calculating low speed flow about arbitrary bodies - Computational Fluid Dynamics. In 1954 he became Supervisor of Aerodynamics Research and from 1969 to 1975 he was Chief Aerodynamics Engineer - Research at Douglas. In this period, he oversaw development of practical methods of analyzing laminar and turbulent boundary layer flow, new and improved static <b>pressure</b> <b>probes,</b> the hydrogen bubble technique of flow visualization, potential flow analysis, analysis of stability and transition of boundary layers and the en method of predicting boundary layer transition.

The <b>pressure</b> <b>probes</b> and vanes {{that make up}} the air data sensors is an optical and flush air data system, position of the sensors is in linear/rotary optical encoders. Importantly, actuators - currently electro-hydraulic/direct drive - could be electro-hydrostatic to accurate substantive weight savings on the AMCA. The aircraft has integrated radio and navigation system supported by IRNSS, where all burdens earlier borne by analogue circuits will be carried out by digital processors. Communication systems are based on software radio ranging from UHF to K band, with data links for digital data/voice data and video footage. The aircraft is equipped with AMAGB gearbox, which is designed and produced by CVRDE. The castings are made of magnesium alloy and the gearbox has its own self-contained lubrication system. AMAGB operates in two modes. In the starter mode, it aids in starting the engine through jet fuel starter. In accessory mode, it drives two hydraulic pumps and an integrated drive generator. These accessories, in turn, generate hydraulic and electrical power for the aircraft.|$|E
40|$|Turgor {{measured}} with a miniature <b>pressure</b> <b>probe</b> was compared to that {{measured with}} an isopiestic thermocouple psychrometer in mature regions of soybean (Glycine max [L. ] Merr.) stems. The probe measured turgor directly in cells of intact stems whereas the psychrometer measured the water potential and osmotic potential of excised stem segments and turgor was calculated by difference. When care was taken to prevent dehydration when working with the <b>pressure</b> <b>probe,</b> and diffusive resistance and dilution errors with the psychrometer, both methods gave similar values of turgor whether the plants were dehydrating or rehydrating. This finding, together with the previously demonstrated similarity in turgor measured with the isopiestic psychrometer and a pressure chamber, indicates that the <b>pressure</b> <b>probe</b> provides accurate measurements of turgor despite the need to penetrate the cell.

40|$|The <b>pressure</b> <b>probe</b> {{has been}} widely used to study the water {{relations}} of plant cells. Here we describe a simple modification of the pressure-probe technique that permits the controlled microinjection of fluor-escent probes into plant cells while simultaneously measuring cell turgor pressure. Using the <b>pressure</b> <b>probe,</b> less than lnl of the membrane-impenneant fluorescent dye Lucifer Yellow CH was introduced into micropipettes and subsequently injected into leaf trichome cells of Nicotians clevelandli. Disrup-tion of cell contents could be minimized by raising the hydrostatic <b>pressure</b> in the <b>probe</b> prior to impalement to a value approaching the anticipated cell turgor pressure. Injections to the cytosol resulted in intercellular symplastic transport of the dye in both acropetal and basipetal directions. In contrast, no symplastic transport was observed following an injection of dye into the vacuole. As measured with the <b>pressure</b> <b>probe,</b> cell turgor <b>pressures</b> were in the range 0. 18 to 0. 36 MPa; the half-time for water exchange across the cell boundary was approxi-mately 10 s.

30|$|Taking {{the merits}} of Hevea brasiliensis, a novel phloem turgor <b>pressure</b> <b>probe</b> based {{on the state of}} the art cell <b>pressure</b> <b>probe</b> was developed. Our field {{measurements}} showed that the phloem turgor <b>pressure</b> <b>probe</b> can sensitively measure the real-time variation of phloem turgor pressure in H. brasiliensis but the calculation of phloem turgor pressure with xylem tension, xylem sap osmotic potential and phloem sap osmotic potential will under-estimate it. The measured phloem turgor pressure gradient in H. brasiliensis is contrary to the Münch theory. The phloem turgor pressure of H. brasiliensis varied from 8 – 12  bar as a consequence of water withdrawal from transpiration. Tapping could result in a sharp decrease of phloem turgor pressure followed by a recovery from 8 – 45  min after the tapping. The recovery of phloem turgor pressure after tapping and its change with xylem sap flow suggest the importance of phloem water relationship in the phloem turgor pressure regulation.|$|R
