The reverse link is considered for a system with N users and a single base station. The base station receives the signal at A different antennas. In addition to antenna diversity, frequency diversity is used by transmitting signals with larger than Nyquist bandwidth. The receiver consists of a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) MMSE linear (LE) or decision-feedback equalizer (DFE). The quasi-stationary, frequency selective radio channels between all users and the base station are assumed to be known at the receiver. We unify the concepts of frequency and antenna diversity and show that the total degree of diversity is equal to the <b>product</b> <b>of</b> <b>processing</b> gain and receiver inputs. It is proven that the general relationship between the equalizer output SNR and MMSE for the MIMO LE and DFE is the same as for the single-input single-output equalizers.

40|$|Microcin C (McC) is {{a potent}} {{antibacterial}} agent produced by some strains of Escherichia coli. McC consists of a ribosomally synthesized heptapeptide with a modified AMP attached through a phosphoramidate linkage to the alpha-carboxyl group of the terminal aspartate. McC is a Trojan horse inhibitor: it is actively taken inside sensitive cells and processed there, and the <b>product</b> <b>of</b> <b>processing,</b> a nonhydrolyzable aspartyl-adenylate, inhibits translation by preventing aminoacylation of tRNA(Asp) by aspartyl-tRNA synthetase (AspRS). Changing the last residue of the McC peptide should result in antibacterial compounds with targets other than AspRS. However, mutations that introduce amino acid substitutions in the last position of the McC peptide abolish McC production. Here, we report total chemical synthesis of three McC-like compounds containing a terminal aspartate, glutamate, or leucine attached to adenosine through a nonhydrolyzable sulfamoyl bond. We show that all three compounds function {{in a manner similar}} to that of McC, but the first compound inhibits bacterial growth by targeting AspRS while the latter two inhibit, respectively, GluRS and LeuRS.

Different extraction methods were applied and extracts were characterized through Ultra Fast High Performance Liquid Chromatography coupled to Photodiode array detector and Electrospray ionization Mass spectrometer (UPLC-PDA-ESI/MSn) for their phenol and anthocyanin contents. The concentrated pomegranate peel extract (PGE-C) was the richest in phenols (66. 97 g gallic acid equivalents/kg) while the concentrated sumac extract from fruits (SUF-C) showed the highest anthocyanin amount (171. 96 mg cyanidin 3 -glucoside equivalents/kg). Both phenolic and anthocyanin profile of pomegranate and sumac extracts were quite different: pomegranate extract was rich in cyanidin 3 -glucoside, pelargonidin 3 -glucoside and ellagic acid derivatives, while sumac extract was characterized by 7 -methyl-cyanidin 3 -galactoside and gallic acid derivatives. The concentrated extracts from both pomegranate peel and sumac leaves significantly reduced the development of Botrytis rots. In particular, the extract from pomegranate peel completely inhibited the pathogen at different intervals of time (0, 12, and 24 h) between treatment and pathogen inoculation on fruits maintained at 22 – 24 °C and high relative humidity (RH).

40|$|Poliovirus {{interactions}} with host cells were investigated {{by studying the}} formation of ribonucleoprotein complexes at the 3 ' end of poliovirus negative-strand RNA which are presumed {{to be involved in}} viral RNA synthesis. It was previously shown that two host cell proteins with molecular masses of 36 and 38 kDa bind to the 3 ' end of viral negative-strand RNA at approximately 3 to 4 h after infection. We tested the hypothesis that preexisting cellular proteins are modified during the course of infection and are subsequently recruited {{to play a role in}} viral replication. It was demonstrated that the 38 -kDa protein, either directly or indirectly, is the <b>product</b> <b>of</b> <b>processing</b> by poliovirus 3 CD/ 3 C proteinase. Only the modified 38 -kDa protein, not its precursor protein, has a high affinity for binding to the 3 ' end of viral negative-strand RNA. This modification depends on proteolytically active proteinase, and a direct correlation between the levels of 3 CD proteinase and the 38 -kDa protein was demonstrated in infected tissue culture cells. The nucleotide (nt) 5 - 10 region (positive-strand numbers) of poliovirus negative-strand RNA is important for binding of the 38 -kDa protein. Deletion of the nt 5 - 10 region in full-length, positive-strand RNA renders the RNA noninfectious in transfection experiments.

Four Gly-Gly-X sites {{are used to}} produce the matrix proteins, but the polyprotein contains an additional 15 sites potentially recognized by the protease. This study shows that cleavage occurs at many, if not all, Gly-Gly-X sites, and at steady state, p 150 and p 34 are minor products of processing. Significantly, only the final structural proteins, p 150 and p 34, were found in mature virions, suggesting {{that there is a}} mechanism for excluding incorrectly processed forms. ASF virus is assembled on the cytoplasmic face of the endoplasmic reticulum, and the distribution of pp 220 products between membranes and cytosol was studied. Incorrectly processed forms of p 34 were recovered from both the cytosol and membrane fractions. Interestingly, p 34 was only detected in the membrane fraction, and of the many processed forms bound to membranes, only p 34 was protected from trypsin, suggesting envelopment. The majority of the incorrectly processed forms of p 150 were recovered from the cytosol. Again, the correct <b>product</b> <b>of</b> <b>processing,</b> p 150, was selectively recruited to membranes. Sucrose density centrifugation showed that membrane-associated forms of p 34 and p 150 assembled into large structures suggestive of a viral matrix, while cytosolic and/or incorrectly processed forms of pp 220 did not. Taken together, these results suggest that association with cellular membranes is important for regulating the correct processing of pp 220 and the packaging of matrix proteins into virions...|$|E
