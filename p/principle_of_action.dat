2500|$|Wilberforce {{is a man}} [...] "of many {{excellent}} and admirable qualifications": he is eloquent, [...] "amiable, charitable, conscientious, pious, loyal, [...] humane". But he is also [...] "tractable to power" [...] and [...] "accessible to popularity". These qualities, according to Hazlitt, are inherently contradictory and render Wilberforce ineffectual. [...] "Loyalty, patriotism, friendship, humanity, are all virtues; but may they not sometimes clash?" [...] He is too afraid of criticism and too in love with praise. [...] "We can readily believe", Hazlitt explains, [...] "that Mr. Wilberforce's first object and <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> is {{to do what he}} thinks right: his next (and that we fear is of almost equal weight with the first) is to do what will be thought so by other people."

2500|$|Lorentz (1892a) set the {{foundations}} of Lorentz aether theory, by assuming the existence of electrons which he separated from the aether, and by replacing the [...] "Maxwell-Hertz" [...] Equations by the [...] "Maxwell-Lorentz" [...] Equations. In his model, the aether is completely motionless and, contrary to Fresnel's theory, also is not partially dragged by matter. An important consequence of this notion was that the velocity of light is totally independent of the velocity of the source. Lorentz gave no statements about the mechanical nature of the aether and the electromagnetic processes, but, vice versa, tried to explain the mechanical processes by electromagnetic ones and therefore created an abstract electromagnetic æther. In the framework of his theory, Lorentz calculated, like Heaviside, the contraction of the electrostatic fields. Lorentz (1895) also introduced {{what he called the}} [...] "Theorem of Corresponding States" [...] for terms of first order in [...] This theorem states that a moving observer (relative to the aether) in his [...] "fictitious" [...] field makes the same observations as a resting observer in his [...] "real" [...] field. An important part of it was local time , which paved the way to the Lorentz transformation and which he introduced independently of Voigt. With the help of this concept, Lorentz could explain the aberration of light, the Doppler effect and the Fizeau experiment as well. However, Lorentz's local time was only an auxiliary mathematical tool to simplify the transformation from one system into another– it was Poincaré in 1900 who recognized that [...] "local time" [...] is actually indicated by moving clocks. Lorentz also recognized that his theory violated the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> and reaction, since the aether acts on matter, but matter cannot act on the immobile aether.|$|E

40|$|The <b>Principle</b> <b>of</b> Least <b>Action</b> is {{used with}} a simple Lagrangian density, {{involving}} second-order derivatives of the wave function, to obtain the Schrödinger equation. A Hamiltonian density obtained from this simple Lagrangian density shows that Hamilton’s equations also give the Schrödinger equation. This simple Lagrangian density is equivalent to a standard Lagrangian density with first-order derivatives. For a time-independent system the <b>Principle</b> <b>of</b> Least <b>Action</b> reduces to the energy variational principle. For time-dependent systems the <b>Principle</b> <b>of</b> Least <b>Action</b> gives time-dependent approximations. Using a Hartree product trial wave function for a time-dependent many-boson system, we apply the <b>Principle</b> <b>of</b> Least <b>Action</b> to obtain the Gross-Pitaevskii equation that describes a Bose-Einstein condensate. ...|$|R

If six of them conspire to deprive the remaining four of their share, their conduct is termed unjust.|$|E

60|$|But here--with their position--the {{comparison}} between them ends.

And thus the aspirations of Numerian, founded on the general good, nourished by offices of kindness, and nobly directed to a generous end, might lead him into indiscretion, but could never degrade him into crime--might trouble the serenity of his life, but could never deprive him of the consolation of hope. While, on the contrary, the ambition of Ulpius, originating in revenge and directed to destruction, exacted cruelty from his heart and duplicity from his mind; and, as the reward for his service, mocked him alternately throughout his whole life with delusion and despair.|$|E
