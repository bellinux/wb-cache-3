The 4 -methoxybenzyl alcohol was prepared from 4 -methoxy-benzaldehyde using sodium borohydride (NaBH 4) reagent and ethanol absolute solution. The mixture was refluxed for 3 h. To yield colorless dilution compound with 90. 41 % in efficiency. Furthermore, bromination of 4 -methoxybenzyl alcohol with <b>phosphorus</b> <b>bromide</b> (PBr 3) was conducted by refluxing for 3 h. The product of this reaction was yellow liquid of 4 -methoxybenzyl bromide, 79. 03 % yield and 95. 34 % purity. The final step of reaction was benzylation of 1, 10 -phenanthroline monohydrate with 4 -methoxybenzyl bromide reagent. It was conducted by refluxing in aceton for 8 h at 55 oC. The yield of the reaction was (1) -N-(4 -methoxybenzyl) - 1, 10 -phenanthroline bromide (77. 63 %). It is pink solid form, and its melting point is 192 - 193 oC. Identification of the product {{was carried out by}} means of GC-MS, IR and 1 H-NMR spectrometers. The in vitro antiplasmodial activity on chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum FCR- 3 strain and chloroquine sensitive P. falciparum D 10 strain for (1) -N-(4 -methoxybenzyl) - 1, 10 -phenanthroline bromide were determined by microscopic method.

40|$|An {{analytical}} procedure, {{oxygen bomb}} combustion ion chromatography (IC), {{was developed for}} the elemental analysis of heteroatoms in fuel and organic wastes. The use of oxygen bomb combustion under elevated oxygen pressure (25 atm) was shown to produce nitrate upon oxidation of atmospheric nitrogen. As the nitrate formed could affect bromide determination, three methods for removing atmospheric nitrogen using evacuation, rinsing and purging procedures were investigated and the best method found is the purging of air by passing oxygen gas at ambient pressure {{at a rate of}} 420 ml/min for 5 min which was shown to be able to remove 95 % of the nitrates. The use of the more sensitive indirect photometric detection method was investigated for non-suppressed IC determination of anions using the phthalate mobile phase system. Good separation and satisfactory sensitivities were obtained for all the heteroatoms studied. In general, the oxygen bomb IC procedure was shown to give satisfactory results for heteroatom determination except nitrogen which show low recovery (40 % R. S. D.) as results of the formation of the insoluble NO and N 2 during oxidation. Under the optimised conditions, linear working ranges up to 3 orders of magnitude, good repeatability of less than 2 %, low detection limits at sub-μg/ml level, satisfactory retention times up to 16 min and good recoveries of more than 95 % were obtained for the heteroatoms investigated. The optimised analytical parameters for the procedure developed for the analysis of fluoride, <b>phosphorus,</b> chloride, <b>bromide,</b> iodide and sulphur are given and discussed. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Agriculture {{drainage}} ditches {{serve as the}} veins of the Midwestern agricultural landscapes. The transport of chemical fertilizers and pesticides in these ditches affects both local and downstream ecosystems. Although much research has already been conducted on chemical transport in streams and {{drainage ditches}}, {{as well as through}} drainage tiles, there has not been sufficient research on the effects of subsurface hydrology on nutrient storage and interactions between the stream water and the hyporheic zone. In this study, a 20 -meter flume was filled with ditch sediment from Marshall Ditch at Purdue University 2 ̆ 7 s Agronomy Center for Research and Education in West Lafayette, IN to serve as an artificial drainage ditch. A water table control was built such that the stream bed can be set to either drainage, saturated or seepage conditions. A series of short term injection studies, using <b>phosphorus</b> and <b>bromide,</b> were performed under three subsurface hydrologic conditions representing a losing stream (water table set below the sediment bed), saturation of the sediment bed and a seepage condition (water table set higher than sediment bed). Five treatments were compared: two seepage rates, two drainage rates and one saturation treatment. ^ Surface water quality samples were collected by automatic samplers located at 5, 10, 15, and 20 meters on one minute time intervals for the designated experimental timeframe. Drainage water quality samples were also collected every 2. 5 meters during the drainage treatment. It was found that under drainage conditions, there was no influence from the sediments on phosphorus mass transport to the surface water; i. e. surface water that entered the subsurface sediments did not return to the surface water column. The removal rate of total mass phosphorus during drainage conditions was directly related to the hydraulic flux of the treatment. During seepage and saturation conditions, the <b>bromide</b> and <b>phosphorus</b> analysis indicated possible storage in dead pool zones of the flume that were immeasurable, indicating that dead pool zones could be more influential during certain hydrologic conditions. ...|$|R
