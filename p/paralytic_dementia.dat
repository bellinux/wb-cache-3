5000|$|Oil Lamps, a 1971 film by Juraj Herz, {{based on}} the same named novel by Jaroslav Havlíček, {{describing}} the life of vivacious girl and her matrimony with a sardonic man, who suffer from emerging <b>paralytic</b> <b>dementia</b> ...|$|E
5000|$|Kanner's first {{research}} publication, [...] "General Paralysis Among The North American Indians," [...] {{explored the}} rarity of general <b>paralytic</b> <b>dementia,</b> a neuropsychiatric disorder {{that occurs in}} late-stage syphilis, in the Native Americans he treated at the Yankton State Hospital. In his premier paper, Kanner stated that in what he considered the more [...] "civilized" [...] countries of Europe, there was a higher susceptibility to <b>paralytic</b> <b>dementia</b> from syphilis compared to the [...] "less civilized" [...] Native Americans. Although syphilis was very popular amongst the Native Americans, Kanner only came across one patient, Thomas T. Robertson, who was Native American and had symptoms of the late-stage syphilis dementia. Kanner concluded that Native Americans rarely got general <b>paralytic</b> <b>dementia</b> because syphilis had been in their population {{for so long that}} it lost the power to produce general paralysis. On the other hand, Kanner argued, syphilis was relatively new to the white populations of Europe so it was more likely to produce general paralysis. However, Kanner believed that with time, the white race could also gain a similar resistance to general paralysis like that of the Native Americans.|$|E
2500|$|William [...] "Billy" [...] Gohl (February 6, 1873 – March 3, 1927) was an American {{serial killer}} who, {{while working as}} a union official, murdered sailors passing through Aberdeen, Washington. He murdered for an unknown period of time and was a suspect in dozens of murders until his capture in 1910. Spared from the death penalty by a request for {{leniency}} by the jury, he was {{sentenced to life in prison}} at Walla Walla State Penitentiary where he died in 1927 from lobar pneumonia and erysipelas complicated by <b>dementia</b> <b>paralytic</b> caused by syphilis.|$|R
50|$|General paresis, {{also known}} as general {{paralysis}} of the insane or <b>paralytic</b> <b>dementia,</b> is a severe neuropsychiatric disorder, classified as an organic mental disorder and caused by the chronic meningoencephalitis that leads to cerebral atrophy in late-stage syphilis. Degenerative changes are associated primarily with the frontal and temporal lobar cortex. The disease affects approximately 7% of infected individuals. It prevails among men.|$|E
5000|$|In 1822 Bayle was {{the first}} {{physician}} to provide a comprehensive description of general paresis, which is {{sometimes referred to as}} <b>paralytic</b> <b>dementia,</b> general paralysis of the insane, or [...] "maladie de Bayle" [...] in medical literature. In 1824 he founded the journal Revue médicale, and from 1828 to 1837 was publisher of the multi-volume Bibliothèque de thérapeutique (Library of Therapeutics).|$|E
5000|$|Savinov, who {{suffered}} from both alcoholism and <b>paralytic</b> <b>dementia,</b> was hospitalized in the early 1900s and died in asylum. [...] "Vizhu chyudnoye privolye" [...] was first recorded by Nina G. Tarasova for Zonophone Records in 1915, as [...] "Lyubov k Rodine". It has been performed since then by numerous Russian and Soviet artists, including Sergey Lemeshev, as Russian folk song, its authors usually uncredited.|$|E
5000|$|Grabill’s {{personal}} {{life can be}} called at best tumultuous. His wife Maggie left him with their 4 year old son in 1891 relocating to Chicago and soon thereafter to Denver. She sued for divorce which was granted, uncontested in January 1892. They would never see each other again. His son Ralph was raised by a maternal aunt in Denver and was educated at the University of Colorado in Boulder attaining a degree in engineering. Grabill’s parents got divorced in 1868 [...] while they lived in Champaign IL, his father’s whereabouts thereafter remain in the dark. His mother Catherine relocated to Chicago and operated a boarding house {{for a number of}} years in that city, only to return to Champaign where she would remarry in 1879 to the widowed windmill manufacturer Daniel L. Roots. That marriage did not last, ending in divorce in 1884. She relocated to Kankakee IL where she operated a boarding house. In November of 1893 Catherine Grabill got involved in a domestic dispute between one of her lodgers and the latter’s estranged husband who murdered both women in the course of an altercation. Grabill’s older brother Elias D. Grabill was educated as a lawyer and briefly ran a law practice in Champaign, but soon switched to teaching school. He lived in his later years in Kankakee IL. Another brother, Newton A. Grabill was a veteran of the American Civil War. Although he was married, he spent most of his remaining life after the war in and out homes for disabled veterans. Grabill’s two sisters, Elizabeth and Mary both married Chicago livestock brokers. Grabill himself, after his mother’s murder in Kankakee in November 1893, vanished. The events in his life (divorce, loss of his various businesses and murder of his mother) likely caused him to seek and eventually find anonymity. Grabill resurfaced in public records as living in St. Louis, Missouri between 1901 and 1903 [...] working as a salesman for Fairbanks, Morse and Company who manufactured, among other things, hydraulic pumps which were used by the mining industry. His mental health had deteriorated causing him to be institutionalized in February 1903 at the St. Louis City Insane Asylum where he died on August 23rd of that year. The death certificate [...] gives the cause of death as <b>paralytic</b> <b>dementia,</b> a disease attributed to, among other causes, chronic Mercury poisoning. Grabill, in his mining days, would have been exposed to mercury, a chemical used to extract precious metal from ore. John C. H. Grabill was buried the day after his death at St. Matthew’s Cemetery in St. Louis.|$|E
