5|$|According to the nebular hypothesis, stars form {{in massive}} and dense clouds of {{molecular}} hydrogen—giant molecular clouds (GMC). These clouds are gravitationally unstable, and matter coalesces within them to smaller denser clumps, which then rotate, collapse, and form stars. Star formation {{is a complex}} process, which always produces a gaseous <b>protoplanetary</b> <b>disk,</b> proplyd, around the young star. This may give birth to planets in certain circumstances, which are not well known. Thus the formation of planetary systems {{is thought to be}} a natural result of star formation. A Sun-like star usually takes approximately 1million years to form, with the <b>protoplanetary</b> <b>disk</b> evolving into a planetary system over the next10–100 million years.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter's regular {{satellites}} {{are believed}} to have formed from a circumplanetary disk, a ring of accreting gas and solid debris analogous to a <b>protoplanetary</b> <b>disk.</b> They may be the remnants of a score of Galilean-mass satellites that formed early in Jupiter's history.|$|E
5|$|However, that meaning {{should not}} be {{confused}} with the process of accretion forming the planets. In this context, accretion refers to the process of cooled, solidified grains of dust and ice orbiting the protostar in the <b>protoplanetary</b> <b>disk,</b> colliding and sticking together and gradually growing, up to and including the high-energy collisions between sizable planetesimals.|$|E
40|$|The {{interpretation}} of polarization in <b>protoplanetary</b> <b>disks</b> at millimeter wavelengths has been dramatically evolving. As a direct extension of polarization in star-forming regions, {{it has been}} thought that non-spherical dust grains aligned with magnetic fields would produce the intrinsic polarization in <b>protoplanetary</b> <b>disks</b> as well. However, it is pointed out that dust scattering can also produce polarization. Furthermore, even {{the direction of the}} alignment might not be determined by magnetic fields but by radiation fields. The recent ALMA observations show that both of the two new theories are working in <b>protoplanetary</b> <b>disks.</b> I would like to review these recent theoretical and observational developments of millimeter-wave polarization in <b>protoplanetary</b> <b>disks</b> and discuss what is crucial for further developments...|$|R

5|$|A {{hypothesis}} for {{the high}} metal content in SMR dwarf stars is that material enriched in heavy elements fell into the atmosphere from a <b>protoplanetary</b> <b>disk.</b> This would pollute the star's external layers, resulting in a higher than normal metallicity.

5|$|Because planetesimals are so numerous, {{and spread}} {{throughout}} the <b>protoplanetary</b> <b>disk,</b> some survive {{the formation of a}} planetary system.

40|$|<b>Proto{{planetary}}</b> <b>disks</b> {{are thought}} to be the birth places of planetary systems. The formation and the subsequent evolution of <b>protoplanetary</b> <b>disks</b> are regulated by the star formation process, which begins with the collapse of a cloud core to form a central protostar surrounded by a disk and an overlying envelope. In the protostellar phase, most of the envelope material is transferred onto the star through the disk during episodic, high accretion events. The initial conditions for planet formation in <b>protoplanetary</b> <b>disks</b> are likely set by the details of these processes. In this contribution, I will review some of the new observational results from Spitzer on protostellar evolution and the structure and evolution of <b>protoplanetary</b> <b>disks</b> surrounding young stars in the nearby star forming regions.

5|$|By 2005, the Spitzer Space Telescope had {{produced}} high-resolution infrared {{images of the}} dust around Vega. It was shown to extend out to 43″ (330AU) at a wavelength of 24μm, 70″ (543AU) at 70μm and 105″ (815AU) at 160μm. These much wider disks {{were found to be}} circular and free of clumps, with dust particles ranging from 1–50μm in size. The estimated total mass of this dust is 3 times the mass of the Earth. Production of the dust would require collisions between asteroids in a population corresponding to the Kuiper Belt around the Sun. Thus the dust is more likely created by a debris disk around Vega, rather than from a <b>protoplanetary</b> <b>disk</b> as was earlier thought.|$|E
5|$|In {{the north}} of the {{constellation}} is the Corona Australis Molecular Cloud, a dark molecular cloud with many embedded reflection nebulae, including NGC 6729, NGC 6726–7, and IC 4812. A star-forming region of around , it contains Herbig–Haro objects (protostars) and some very young stars. About 430 light years (130 parsecs) away, {{it is one of the}} closest star-forming regions to the Solar System. The related NGC 6726 and 6727, along with unrelated NGC 6729, were first recorded by Johann Friedrich Julius Schmidt in 1865. The Coronet cluster, about 554 light years (170 parsecs) away at the edge of the Gould Belt, is also used in studying star and <b>protoplanetary</b> <b>disk</b> formation.|$|E
5|$|The {{accretion}} process, {{by which}} 1km planetesimals grow into 1,000km sized bodies, is well understood now. This process develops inside any disk where the number density of planetesimals is sufficiently high, and proceeds in a runaway manner. Growth later slows and continues as oligarchic accretion. The {{end result is}} formation of planetary embryos of varying sizes, which depend on {{the distance from the}} star. Various simulations have demonstrated that the merger of embryos in the inner part of the <b>protoplanetary</b> <b>disk</b> leads to the formation of a few Earth-sized bodies. Thus the origin of terrestrial planets is now considered to be an almost solved problem.|$|E

40|$|High-energy {{radiation}} from the central T Tauri and protostars {{plays an important role}} in shaping <b>protoplanetary</b> <b>disks</b> and influences their evolution. Such radiation, in particular X-rays and extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) radiation, is predominantly generated in unstable stellar magnetic fields (e. g., the stellar corona), but also in accretion hot spots. Even jets may produce X-ray emission. Cosmic rays, i. e., high-energy particles either from the interstellar space or from the star itself, are of crucial importance. Both highenergy photons and particles ionize disk gas and lead to heating. Ionization and heating subsequently drive chemical networks, and the products of these processes are accessible through observations of molecular line emission. Furthermore, ionization supports the magnetorotational instability and therefore drives disk accretion, while heating of the disk surface layers induces photoevaporative flows. Both processes are crucial for the dispersal of <b>protoplanetary</b> <b>disks</b> and therefore critical for the time scales of planet formation. This chapter introduces the basic physics of ionization and heating starting from a quantum mechanical viewpoint, then discusses relevant processes in astrophysical gases and their applications to <b>protoplanetary</b> <b>disks,</b> and finally summarizes some properties of the most important high-energy sources for <b>protoplanetary</b> <b>disks...</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{formation}} timescale {{of giant}} planets {{is also an}} important problem. Old theories were unable to explain how their cores could form fast enough to accumulate significant amounts of gas from the quickly disappearing <b>protoplanetary</b> <b>disk.</b> The mean lifetime of the disks, which is less than ten million (107)years, appeared to be shorter than the time necessary for the core formation. Much progress has been done to solve this problem and current models of giant planet formation are now capable of forming Jupiter (or more massive planets) in about 4 million years or less, well within the average lifetime of gaseous disks.|$|E
5|$|The planets {{were formed}} 4.6 {{billion years ago}} in the <b>protoplanetary</b> <b>disk</b> that {{surrounded}} the early Sun. Through a process that included gravitational attraction, collision, and accretion, the disk formed clumps of matter that, with time, became protoplanets. The radiation pressure of the solar wind then expelled most of the unaccreted matter, and only those planets with sufficient mass retained their gaseous atmosphere. The planets continued to sweep up, or eject, the remaining matter during a period of intense bombardment, evidenced by the many impact craters on the Moon. During this period, some of the protoplanets may have collided and one such collision may have formed the Moon.|$|E
5|$|The <b>protoplanetary</b> <b>disk</b> is an {{accretion}} disk that feeds the central star. Initially very hot, the disk later cools {{in what is}} known as the T tauri star stage; here, formation of small dust grains made of rocks and ice is possible. The grains eventually may coagulate into kilometer-sized planetesimals. If the disk is massive enough, the runaway accretions begin, resulting in the rapid—100,000 to 300,000years—formation of Moon- to Mars-sized planetary embryos. Near the star, the planetary embryos go through a stage of violent mergers, producing a few terrestrial planets. The last stage takes approximately 100million to a billion years.|$|E

40|$|Observations {{of comets}} and chondritic porous interplanetary dust {{particles}} (CP-IDPs, grains likely shed from comets), {{as well as}} of <b>protoplanetary</b> <b>disks,</b> show that a large fraction of the submicron silicate grains in these objects are Mg-rich crystalline silicates. Here we review observations of the mineralogy and crystallinity of cometary grains and anhydrous CP IDPs, including new spectroscopy of the dust liberated by the Deep Impact experiment on 9 P/Tempel. Some key results of these observations are: that crystalline silicates are very Mg-rich; and that in most disks (including the Solar System’s) a gradient in the silicate crystalline fraction exists. We discuss the mechanisms by which Mg-rich crystals can be produced in <b>protoplanetary</b> <b>disks,</b> including: complete evaporation followed by slow-recondensation; or reduction of Fe in Mg-Fe silicates (possibly facilitated by C combustion to CO or CO 2), combined with thermal annealing.
