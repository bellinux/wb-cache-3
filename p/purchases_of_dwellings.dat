The actual level of foreign <b>purchases</b> <b>of</b> <b>dwellings</b> has been significantly lower. Foreign purchases appear to be most concentrated in new rather than established dwellings, in higher- rather than lower-priced dwellings, in medium- and high-density dwellings rather than detached dwellings, and in inner-city areas of Sydney and Melbourne rather than other locations...|$|E
40|$|The Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) of Israel {{produces}} an official monthly hedonic nationwide home price index starting in 1994. The Index of Prices of Dwellings is constructed {{using data from}} the Catalog of Real Estate Prices, a system through which information about <b>purchases</b> <b>of</b> <b>dwellings</b> is gathered by the Capital Gains Tax Bureaus throughout the country. These data on transactions include new dwellings and dwellings whose ownership changed. The sample consists of 67 urban localities which have: 1) 20, 000 or more residents, 2) 5, 000 or more dwellings, according to the inventory of dwellings in Israel as listed in the Municipal Taxation List, and 3) a reasonable number of transactions relative to the number of dwellings. The index excludes dwellings built by individuals, transactions performed through a group of buyers, transactions from public companies, and dwellings with no market value. The Index of Prices of Dwellings is calculated using a hedonic regression that considers the characteristics of the dwellings and adjusts for differences in their quality. We average the monthly observations (with a simple arithmetic average) to obtain quarterly observations. In order to reflect house prices prior to 1994, we follow Dovman, Ribon, and Yakhin (2012) and splice the current Index of Prices of Dwellings with a historical monthly index from the CBS...|$|E
40|$|Housing {{subsidies}} in Slovenia {{have been}} introduced in 2000 with the amendments of the 1992 Housing Act. However, these were reserved exclusively for tenants in the non-profit sector. Due to their positive results, the Government also introduced the subsidies for tenants in market rentals. Apart from the subsidies for rentals, there were several other subsidies offered, especially for <b>purchases</b> <b>of</b> <b>dwellings</b> by young families resolving their housing issues {{for the first time}} and for other categories of citizens. However, the present economic crisis has put a major pressure onto the budgetary means of the Government. Therefore, some austerity measures were introduced in the last few years, which took its toll on the subsidies as well. The purpose of the paper is to present the positive effects of subsidizing households’ housing expenses, especially those renting under the market conditions. The number of applications by young families for both purchases and rentals (over 26, 000 in six years) indicates that the need for this type of assistance is huge. At the same time, the paper will strive to indicate the possible side effects of the austerity measures in the resent housing situation in Slovenia. According to the analysis of the National Housing Fund, this step tends to deprive over 10, 000 young households in the years to come...|$|E

50|$|One {{argument}} is that <b>purchases</b> <b>of</b> new <b>dwellings</b> are treated as Investment in the System of National Accounts, so should not enter a consumption price index. It is {{said that this is}} more than just a matter of terminological uniformity. For example, it may be thought to help understanding and facilitate economic analysis if what is included under the heading of Consumption is the same in the Consumer Price Index and in the national income and expenditure accounts. Since these accounts include the equivalent rental value <b>of</b> owner-occupied <b>dwellings,</b> the equivalent rental approach would have to be applied in the Consumer Price Index too. But the national accounts do not apply it to other durables, so the argument demands consistency in one respect but accepts its rejection in another.|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} is to analyze the {{distributional}} effects of the subsidy systems related to housing in Flanders, the north region of Belgium. It is explored which income groups benefit the most. In addition, the mechanisms that lead to this distribution are clarified. Concerning owner-occupiers these subsidies are the mortgage interest deduction, the reduced VAT rate for renovation, the reduced transaction costs for the <b>purchase</b> <b>of</b> modest <b>dwellings</b> and the lower property tax for modest dwellings. With regard to the rental sector, social housing and the housing allowance are the subsidy schemes at stake. The distributive impact is measured by means of the ‘user cost’ concept. Within this perspective a dwelling is regarded as an investment good that generates housing services that can be consumed. The user cost is the price households pay for these services. In order to calculate the level of subsidies the actual user cost is compared with a benchmark. In this study the benchmark is the situation in which no subsidies are granted, given the existing tax system. Regarding owner-occupied housing, all fiscal arrangements that deviate from the general tax system, lower the costs and are aimed at specific target groups, are regarded as subsidies. The subsidy for social tenants is the difference between the actual – subsidized - rent and the market rent. Data are drawn from the Flemish Housing Survey of 2005 and administrative data. The results show that the tax advantages are mainly received by the 40 % highest incomes. The deductions on property tax and transaction costs are to a lesser extent directed at higher incomes, since they include a condition of modest housing. The subsidy of social rent is for 60 % directed at the lowest income quintile. With regard to housing allowances this share reaches more than 90 %. status: publishe...|$|R
