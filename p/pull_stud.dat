50|$|An {{improvement}} on CAT Tooling is BT Tooling, which looks similar and {{can easily be}} confused with CAT tooling. Like CAT Tooling, BT Tooling comes {{in a range of}} sizes and uses the same NMTB body taper. However, BT tooling is symmetrical about the spindle axis, which CAT tooling is not. This gives BT tooling greater stability and balance at high speeds. One other subtle difference between these two toolholders is the thread used to hold the <b>pull</b> <b>stud.</b> CAT Tooling is all Imperial thread and BT Tooling is all Metric thread. Note that this affects the <b>pull</b> <b>stud</b> only, it does not affect the tool that they can hold, both types of tooling are sold to accept both Imperial and metric sized tools.|$|E
50|$|For {{use with}} heavy loads (such as {{encountered}} by {{a milling machine}} spindle), there is usually a key to prevent rotation and/or a threaded section, which is engaged by a drawbar that engages either the threads or {{the head of a}} <b>pull</b> <b>stud</b> that is screwed into them. The drawbar is then tightened, drawing the shank firmly into the spindle. The draw-bar is important on milling machines as the transverse force component would otherwise cause the tool to wobble out of the taper.|$|E
5000|$|SK and HSK tooling, {{sometimes}} called [...] "Hollow Shank Tooling", {{is much more}} common in Europe where it was invented {{than it is in}} the United States. It is claimed that HSK tooling is even better than BT Tooling at high speeds. The holding mechanism for HSK tooling is placed within the (hollow) body of the tool and, as spindle speed increases, it expands, gripping the tool more tightly with increasing spindle speed. There is no <b>pull</b> <b>stud</b> with this type of tooling.|$|E
50|$|The {{pull-off}} test, {{also called}} <b>stud</b> <b>pull</b> test is a near-to-surface method {{in which an}} adhesive connection is made between a stud and the carrier (or object to be tested) by using a glue, possibly an epoxy or polyester resin, that is stronger than the bond {{that needs to be}} tested. The force required to <b>pull</b> the <b>stud</b> from the surface, together with the carrier, is measured. Simple mechanical hand-operated loading equipment has been developed for this purpose. When higher accuracy is required, tests can be performed with more advanced equipment called a bond tester. A bond tester provides more control and possibly automation. Applying the glue automatically and curing with UV light is the next step in automation.|$|R
40|$|When {{maintaining}} large-sized pumps, {{operations with}} basic parts are performed. The main outlet of the pump is pressurized. To perform these operations, it {{is required to}} apply special equipment which includes hydraulic wrenches to provide the necessary sealing force. The integral part of such a wrench is a multistage hydraulic cylinder which <b>pulls</b> the <b>stud</b> out. When you are citing the document, use the following link [URL]...|$|R
6000|$|... "I advise no man {{to attempt}} opening this sporran till he has my secret," [...] said Rob Roy; and then {{twisting}} one button in one direction, {{and another in}} another, <b>pulling</b> one <b>stud</b> upward, and pressing another downward, {{the mouth of the}} purse, which was bound with massive silver plate, opened and gave admittance to his hand. He made me remark, as if to break short the subject on which Bailie Jarvie had spoken, that a small steel pistol was concealed within the purse, the trigger of which was connected with the mounting, and made part of the machinery, so that the weapon would certainly be discharged, and in all probability its contents lodged in the person of any one, who, being unacquainted with the secret, should tamper with the lock which secured his treasure. [...] "This," [...] said he touching the pistol--"this is the keeper of my privy purse." ...|$|R
50|$|The NMTB tool shanks had the 7 in 24 taper, {{but they}} also had a {{constant}} diameter tail (pilot) {{at the end of}} the shank that was described in the 1927 patent. Subsequent design variations dropped the tail (making the shank shorter) and put a V-groove in the flange that aided automated tool changing. Modern designs started using power drawbars that gripped pull studs (also known as retention knobs) that were screwed into the tool shank rather than screw-in drawbars. The power drawbar would grip the <b>pull</b> <b>stud</b> rather than screwing into the tool shank.|$|E
25|$|Lintel 24 is the {{designation}} given by modern archaeologists {{to an ancient}} Maya limestone carving from Yaxchilan, in modern Chiapas, Mexico. The lintel dates to about 725 CE, placing it within the Maya Late Classic period. The text of Maya hieroglyphics indicates that the scene depicted is a bloodletting ritual that took place on 5 Eb 15 Mac, 709 CE. The ruler, Shield Jaguar, holds a torch while his consort, Lady Xoc, <b>pulls</b> a rope <b>studded</b> with what are now believed to be obsidian shards through her tongue in order to conjure a vision serpent.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the effects of}} post {{deposition}} heat treatments on the cohesive and adhesive strength properties of PS 304, a plasma sprayed nickel-chrome based, high temperature solid lubricant coating deposited on stainless steel, are studied. Plasma spray deposited coating samples were exposed in air at temperatures from 432 to 650 C for up to 500 hr to promote residual stress relief, enhance particle to particle bonding and increase coating to substrate bond strength. Coating pull-off strength was measured using a commercial adhesion tester that utilizes 13 mm diameter aluminum <b>pull</b> <b>studs</b> attached to the coating surface with epoxy. Pull off force was automatically recorded and converted to coating pull off strength. As deposited coating samples were also tested as a baseline. The as-deposited (untreated) samples either delaminated at the coating-substrate interface or failed internally (cohesive failure) at about 17 MPa. Samples heat treated at temperatures above 540 C for 100 hr or at 600 C or above for more than 24 hr exhibited strengths above 31 MPa, nearly a two fold increase. Coating failure occurred inside {{the body of the}} coating (cohesive failure) for nearly all of the heat-treated samples and only occasionally at the coating substrate interface (adhesive failure). Metallographic analyses of heat-treated coatings indicate that the Nickel-Chromium binder in the PS 304 appears to have segregated into two phases, a high nickel matrix phase and a high chromium precipitated phase. Analysis of the precipitates indicates the presence of silicon, a constituent of a flow enhancing additive in the commercial NiCr powder. The exact nature and structure of the precipitate phase is not known. This microstructural change is believed to be partially responsible for the coating strength increase. Diffusion bonding between particles may also be playing a role. Increasing the heat treatment temperature, exposure time or both accelerate the heat treatment process. Preliminary measurements indicate that the heat treatment also results in a one time, permanent coating thickness increase of about 3 %. Based upon these results, the incorporation of a heat treatment prior to final finishing has been incorporated in the application process of this coating technology...|$|R
50|$|The {{well known}} problem of <b>pulled</b> {{cylinder}} head <b>studs</b> with the K-Jetronic 2.7 engine only occurred in hot climates. This emerged in 1975 in California where thermal reactors, {{aimed at reducing}} emissions, were fitted below the cylinder heads thus causing heat build up around the magnesium crankcase and then made worse by the lean running K-Jetronic CIS. The fitting of a 5-blade engine fan {{instead of the usual}} 11-blade further compounded the situation.Bearing in mind Porsche's largest market being the USA, the 930 Turbo, Carrera 3.0 and all subsequent models used aluminium alloy crankcases which were around 15 lb heavier.|$|R
5000|$|Lady Xoc {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{prominent}} and probably politically powerful women in the Maya civilization. Lady Xoc is shown here performing an important royal rite of blood letting. By <b>pulling</b> the rope <b>studded</b> with obsidian shards through her tongue, she causes blood to drip onto paper strips held in a woven basket to be burned as depicted on Lintel 25. Blood scrolls can be seen on her face. The queen also wears an elaborate headdress. There are flower tassels on the main part of the head band and a mosaic depiction of Tlaloc sprouting quetzal feathers. Her elaborately carved huipil is trimmed with fringe and pearls. Her necklace also appears to have a pectoral depiction of the sun god. It is probably made of shell or jade plaques, as are her wrist cuffs.|$|R
40|$|The force {{needed to}} <b>pull</b> a {{cylindrical}} <b>stud</b> from a soft elastomeric film {{depends on their}} elastic and geometric properties. For a rigid stud and a thick elastomeric film, the pull-off stress (r) depends on the elastic modulus (E) of the film and the radius (a) of the stud as r (E=a) 1 = 2 (soft adhesion). However, when the film is very thin, the pull-off stress is {{significantly higher than the}} case with thick films, and its value depends on the elastic modulus and the thickness (h) of the film as r (E=h) 1 = 2 (hard adhesion). Here, we study the pull-off behavior of a soft cylin-drical stud, one flat end of which is coated with a high modulus thin baseplate. As the flexural rigidity of this baseplate is varied, we observe the transition between the two types of adhesion. We present a simple physical interpretation of the problem, which could be of value in understanding various biofouling and adhesive situations...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} {{experiments}} were carried out to investigate the adhesion properties and thermal stability of Cu/benzocyclobutene-divinyl tetramethyldisiloxane (BCB-DVS) interfaces by a <b>stud</b> <b>pull</b> test and cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (TEM), respectively. Multilayered specimens were prepared by spin-coating a layer of BCB-DVS onto a Si wafer and subsequently a layer of Cu was deposited on the BCB-DVS by electron beam evaporation. It {{was found that the}} average bond strength of the Cu/BCB-DVS interface was improved slightly by either Ar ion bombardment of the BCB-DVS surface or a Ti interlayer between Cu and BCB-DVS. A significant improvement was obtained by a combination of Ar ion bombardment and a Ti interlayer, and resulted in the formation of titanium carbides or oxides between Ti and BCB-DVS. Upon annealing the specimens at 260 degrees C in vacuum for 18 h, interdiffusion of Cu into BCB-DVS to form clusters was observed, by cross-sectional TEM, for specimens with a 5 nm Ti interlayer, whereas the Cu island was not present in specimens with a 20 nm Ti interlayer. Interfacial reactions upon annealing were demonstrated by the formation of Cu 3 TiO 5 and Cu-Ti intermetallics, identified by selected area diffraction...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTFA-MOD derived YBCO {{tapes are}} {{expected}} for many applications due to cost-efficiency. In some applications, uniformity and mechanical strength {{are required for}} tapes. A 205 m-long YBCO tape was fabricated with high and uniform Ic performance throughout the tape by adopting the interim annealing before the conversion process. The effect of the interim annealing on the crystal growth mechanism of YBCO has been studied focusing {{on the relationship between}} the interim annealing conditions and delamination, in this work. Delamination strength was evaluated in the samples prepared with and without interim annealing by the <b>stud</b> <b>pull</b> method. Measurements were carried out on 50 different points for each sample and the results were analyzed statistically. The difference between the two samples was remarkably seen in the delamination strength below 60 MPa. The conventionally annealed sample had more points with low delamination strength below 60 MPa than the interim annealed one. The cross sectional images of both samples observed by SEM showed that there were few pores within the interim annealed superconducting layer, although conventional superconducting layer had many pores. These results suggest that the pores within YBCO layer might be origins to be propagated for delamination at low strength...|$|R
40|$|Electrochemical {{polymerisation}} (ECP) of non conducting polymers to form thin, passive {{films on}} electrodes has received attention {{in recent years}} as a potential adhesion promotion technique. Work on carbon electrodes with applications in the carbon fibre composite industry have shown {{that it is possible to}} enhance adhesion of carbon fibres to the composite matrix through ECP pretreatments. ECP to produce passive coatings on metals has also been studied, however much of this work is concerned with production of corrosion inhibiting films, rather than adhesion promoting layers. ECP methods are a promising alternative to the chromate pretreatments and primers presently used to improve the adhesion and corrosion resistance of organic coatings on metals. This is because they can be non toxic, offer the possibility of pinhole free coatings and can be produced insitu, preventing the need for separate processing. Thin, uniform, reproducible polymer coatings based upon poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and poly (glycidyl acrylate) (PGA) were produced on stainless steel cathodes from dilute aqueous sulphuric acid containing potassium persulphate. Electrochemical activities of the solutions were identified by cyclic voltammetry. The polymers were confirmed to be PMMA and PGA by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The thickness of the coatings (between 30 and 400 nm) were measured by ellipsometry, and found to increase with increasing treatment time and with less negative electrode potential. The porosity of the coatings was assessed electrochemically and after an annealing treatment the porosity and coating thickness were both found to decrease for the PMMA coatings and remain relatively unchanged for the PGA coatings. The morphology of the ECP coatings were studied by various microscopy techniques. Further characterisation of the PMMA coatings was undertaken in order to clarify the polymerisation mechanism. This involved differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and solubility studies. A free radical polymerisation mechanism has been proposed in which the radicals are long lived resulting in post electrolysis polymerisation and very high molecular weights. The PMMA and PGA ECP coatings were used as tie layers in adhesion tests by adhering aluminium studs onto the ECP surface with the desired adhesive and subsequently <b>pulling</b> the <b>stud</b> off at a reproducible rate with an Instron tensile testing machine. It was conclusively shown that the adhesion strength between the stainless steel and a cyanoacrylate adhesive was improved by the presence of the PMMA ECP tie layer. In contrast the adhesion of the PMMA ECP tie layer to a standard epoxy adhesive was very poor. The adhesion of the PGA ECP tie layers to the stainless steel substrate was too great to be measured by the standard epoxy adhesive, therefore a toughened adhesive was employed to measure the strength of the interaction between the PGA layers and the stainless steel. This study demonstrates that the ECP technique can be used to improve adhesion of metals to adhesives if the tie layers are chemically compatible with both the metallic oxide and the adhesive. The adhesion is proposed to be improved by increased primary and/or secondary bonding at these interfaces and by excellent interfacial contact between the metallic electrode and the electropolymerised tie layer...|$|R
