40|$|The {{purpose of}} the paper {{is an attempt to}} answer the {{following}} questions: firstly, is the <b>pledge</b> an available and favourable form o f securing receivables related to agricultural production due from a debtor who is an agricultural producer, and, secondly, is the <b>pledge</b> an effective measure of obtaining the benefit for the creditor. Three types of <b>pledges</b> have been analysed: an ordinary <b>pledge</b> regulated by articles 306 - 335 of the civil code, a registered <b>pledge</b> and a statutory <b>pledge</b> related to the agricultural lease (article 701 civil code). The paper presents different issues related to the <b>pledge,</b> including the <b>pledge</b> being a subject and object o f the transaction, and the recovery o f the benefit secured by the <b>pledge.</b> The paper ends with a conclusion that from the point o f view o f both: the pledgor and the pledgee, a registered <b>pledge</b> is undoubtedly a much more advantageous and desirable form of securing receivables than an ordinary <b>pledge.</b> Consequently, postulates requesting modifications of some existing regulations concerning registered <b>pledge</b> act seem to be fully justifiable...|$|R

40|$|Since 1993, in {{response}} to a movement sponsored by the Southern Baptist Church, over 2. 5 million adolescents have taken public “virginity” <b>pledges,</b> in which they promise to abstain from sex until marriage. This paper explores the effect of those <b>pledges</b> on the transition to first intercourse. Adolescents who <b>pledge</b> are much less likely to have intercourse than adolescents who do not <b>pledge.</b> The delay effect is substantial. On the other hand, the <b>pledge</b> does not work for adolescents at all ages. Second, <b>pledging</b> delays intercourse only in contexts where there are some, but not too many, pledgers. The <b>pledge</b> works because it is embedded in an identity movement. Consequently, the <b>pledge</b> identity is meaningful only in contexts where it is at least partially nonnormative. Consequences of <b>pledging</b> are explored for those who break their promise. Promise breakers are less likely than others to use contraception at first intercourse...|$|R
