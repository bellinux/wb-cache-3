The objective of the present study was to determine the interaction effects of salinity and irrigation intervals on growth and flowering of two important commercial cultivars (‘Mahallati ’ and ‘Dezfuli’) of tuberose (<b>Polianthes</b> <b>tuberosa</b> L.). Irrigation treatments consisted of four irrigation intervals 2, 4, 6, and 8 days, and salinity treatments in the irrigation water were EC values of 0. 7 (control), 1. 9, 3. 1, and 4. 3 dS m- 1. This research was carried out in a complete randomized design with factorial arrangement. It can be concluded that tuberose is sensitive to water and salinity stress. In both cultivars of tuberose, vegetative and reproductive parameters were unfavorably affected by these stresses. However, ‘Mahallati ’ was more sensitive to those stresses than ‘Dezfuli’.

The study monitored morphological and decorative characters, productivity, technological and behaviour characteristics of the species and its use. In terms of multiplication of tuberose, number of bulbs per plant is a determining factor. The rate of multiplication of the species depends directly on the number of trained replacement bulbs. The bifactorial experiment focused on the influence of the culture substrate and the diameter of planted bulbs on the number of bulbs per plant, and therefore plant productivity. Based on the resulted data it can be concluded that the two experimental factors significantly influenced the average number of formed replacement bulbs / plant.

Thus, it is urgent for scientists to search for alternative drugs with selective antitumor action and minimal side effects. It is known that some plant metabolites exhibit antioxidant, cytotoxic, and antitumor activity, {{while at the same time}} being less toxic than modern allopathic drugs. In this work, we have investigated the cytotoxic and apoptosis-inducing effects of extracts obtained from plants of the family Asparagaceae on A 549 human lung adenocarcinoma cells. The analysis has been performed using flow cytofluorometry. If extracts showed cytotoxicity, the apoptosis-inducing action has been evaluated at the concentration of 50 μg/mL; in other cases, the analyzed concentration range was 50 – 300 μg/mL. On the basis of the experiments carried out, the following conclusions have been made. Extracts of the leaves and rhizomes of Sansevieria cylindrica and Sansevieria trifasciata do not possess antitumor activity. Extracts of the leaves of <b>Polianthes</b> <b>tuberosa</b> and Furcraea gigantea, which were cytotoxic at high concentrations, cause cell death at 50 μg/mL in the amount of 21. 35 ± 1. 86 and 15. 6 ± 3. 23, respectively. Extracts of <b>Polianthes</b> <b>tuberosa</b> bulbs and Yucca filamentosa leaves are able to induce apoptosis at higher concentrations. When the concentration reaches 100 μg/mL, the proportion of apoptotic cells for these plants is 45. 76 ± 1. 34 and 11. 33 ± 0. 07, respectively. The number of dead cells at the concentration of 300 μg/mL increased up to 73. 33 ± 3. 05 and 81. 75 ± 4. 07.

40|$|<b>Polianthes</b> <b>tuberosa</b> is {{a commercially}} {{valuable}} flower crop in the Mekong Delta of Vietnam that is propagated by the harvesting and planting of bulbs. The cultivation of P. tuberosa {{is complicated by}} an endemic nematode infection that damages {{a high proportion of}} the plants. Based on morphological criteria and ribosomal RNA gene sequencing, we have determined that the infection is caused by an Aphelenchoides sp. nematode and is most likely Aphelenchoides besseyi. By scoring various parts of harvested plants with flowers for the presence of viable nematodes over a period of six months, we determined that the nematode is an ectoparasite that can survive the intercrop periods, especially in the bulbs that are used to plant new crops. A comparison of farming practices in the Mekong Delta failed to identify useful control methods, but rather indicated that fields that have cultivated P. tuberosa for the longest periods suffer the worst damage from the nematode infection. Finally, we demonstrated that the nematode is capable of infecting 30 rice cultivars but does not cause the white tip disease usually associated with A. besseyi infection...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Effects of {{different}} types of antitranspirants (ATs), Kaolin and Vapor Gard, on vegetative growth, flowering, and chemical composition, of tuberose (<b>Polianthes</b> <b>tuberosa</b> L.) cv. “Double” plants, grown under different irrigation regimes were investigated. Results showed that plant biomass, number of leaves, length and weight of marketable inflorescences and bulb yield were significantly reduced by water deficit, particularly at 60 % evapo-transpiration (ET). But, the flowering period was markedly shortened under stress conditions. Under water deficit N, P, K, Ca, total carbohydrates and soluble sugars decreased in treated leaves as compared to the control plants. Both types of ATs effectively enhanced plant performance, flower formation, bulb production, nutrient uptake and carbohydrate synthesis at the 80 % ET treatment, relative to the irrigation regime of 80 % ET. The performance of Kaolin was more effective than that of Vapor Gard (VG). This might be contributed to its mechanism in reducing leaf temperature, transpiration rate, improvement of plant water status and maintaining biomass production of tuberose plants. Due to the superiority of Kaolin particle film in regulating plant performance and chemistry, it is recommended to be used for reducing water loss by plants in Al-Qassim region, Saudi Arabia...|$|E

The genus is endemic to México and comprises about 15 species, among them is <b>Polianthes</b> <b>tuberosa</b> L. The aim of this work was to study and characterize the embryo sac and early embryo development of this species in order to generate basic knowledge for its use in taxonomy, in vitro fertilization and production of haploid plants and to complement studies already performed in other genera and species belonging to the Agavoideae sub-family. It {{was found that the}} normal development of the P. tuberosa var. Simple embryo sac follows a monosporic pattern of the Polygonum type and starts its development from the chalazal megaspore. At maturity, the embryo sac is of a pyriform shape with a chalazal haustorial tube where the antipodals are located, just below the hypostase, which connects the embryo sac with the nucellar tissue of the ovule. The central cell nucleus shows a high polarity, being located at the chalazal extreme of the embryo sac. The position of cells inside the P. tuberosa embryo sac may be useful for in depth studies about the double fertilization. Furthermore, it was possible to make a chronological description of the events that happen from fertilization and early embryo development to the initial development of the endosperm which was classified as of the helobial type.|$|E

Also, limited studies on utilization of de-oiled cake have revealed that Jatropha bio-waste has good potential to be used as organic fertilizers produced via aerobic and anaerobic treatment. However, their commercial exploitation has not yet been possible. The present study aims at developing appropriate bio-processes and formulations utilizing Jatropha seed cake as organic fertilizer, for improving the growth of Polianthes tuberose L. (Tuberose). Pot experiments were carried out by growing tuberose plants on soil treated with composted formulations of Jatropha de-oiled cake, Farm Yard Manure (FYM) and inorganic fertilizers were also blended in soil. The treatment was carried out through soil amendment as well as foliar spray. The growth and morphological parameters were monitored for entire crop cycle. The growth Length and number of leaves, spike length, rachis length, number of bulb per plant and earliness of sprouting of bulb and yield enhancement were comparable to that achieved under inorganic fertilizer. Furthermore, performance of inorganic fertilizer also showed an improvement when blended with composted bio-waste. These findings would open new avenues for Jatropha based bio-wastes to be composted and used as organic fertilizers for commercial floriculture.

The experiment was laid out in randomized complete block design with 10 treatments of nitrogen in split doses and replicating thrice. The cut flower and vase life characteristics of tuberose were studied and the economics of production was also analysed. Significant difference was found between treatments of split doses of nitrogen in flowering and post-harvest characteristics of this flower. Three equal split doses of nitrogen, 33 % N basal + 33 % N at 30 days after planting + 33 % N at 50 days after planting resulted in the earliest spike initiation (60 days) and the first flower opening (95. 17 days). The same treatments recorded longest vase life (16. 47 days). The longest (91. 69 cm), heaviest (87. 97 g) and thickest (0. 89 cm) spikes with longest rachis (38. 77 cm) were produced by three equal split doses of nitrogen, 33 % N basal + 33 % N at 50 days after planting + 33 % N at 70 days after planting. The same treatments produced maximum net income (NRs. 214, 250 /-) and benefit-cost (B:C) ratio (1. 29) per hectare.

30|$|Endogenous {{organic acids}} are both {{a source of}} carbon skeletons for other {{biochemical}} pathways {{as well as an}} energy source for cells in the respiratory cycle [22]. In plants, malic acid (MA) is metabolized in mitochondria, acts as a common reserve anion in the plant vacuole, and is a counter ion for K and Ca cations, especially in nitrate-dependent plants [23 – 25]. Citrate and malate extruded by roots of calcicole plants (plants growing in alkaline soils) facilitate the extraction of phosphorus and iron from such soils [26]. Citric acid (CA) alone or in combination with iron sources has been sprayed on the foliage of plants for successful recovery from iron chlorosis [27 – 30]. Use of CA alone or in combinations with salicylic acid (SA) and MA increased the essential oil production of Ocimum basilicum L. and Anethum graveolens L. [31, 32]. Foliar application of CA extended the vase life of lily (Lilium spp.) and tuberose (<b>Polianthes</b> <b>tuberosa</b> L.) while improving drought tolerance in bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) [30, 33, 34]. Combination of 1  mM SA with 7  mM CA was superior to others for improving flowering and essential oil production in Ocimum basilicum L. [35]. The level of CA inside plant tissue is increased by exogenous application of CA and beneficial effects were observed, which were attributed to observed protective effects on peroxidation-linked membrane deterioration, free radical scavenging, maintenance of membrane stability, an increase in root activity, and activation of an antioxidant response [36]. The increase in peroxidase activity from CA application, which is responsible for H 2 O 2 metabolism, has been documented [37]. IBA is responsible for an H 2 O 2 increase, which promotes the formation of adventitious roots, possibly via a change in antioxidant enzymes activity; the same rooting response is reported with the addition of either ascorbic acid or H 2 O 2 [38].|$|E

Severe water stress, decreased stomatal frequency and conductance (gs), leaf water potential (&# 936;w), osmotic potential (&# 936;&# 960;), turgor potential (&# 936;p), relative water content (RWC), chlorophyll content (chl), carbon assimilation rate (A) and the transpiration rate (E). Both types of antitranspirants effectively enhanced the performance and physiological activities of water-stressed plants particularly, at the 80 % ET, {{but they did not}} compensate for the negative effects caused by the 60 % ET treatment. However, the particle type (Kaolin) was more effective than the emulsion type (VG) due to its ability to reduce leaf temperature. The increased gs caused by VG and Kaolin sprays were accompanied by increased A suggesting that gs might have a limiting effect on A in water-stressed plants. Water use efficiency (WUE) of Kaolin–sprayed leaves was significantly higher than that of VG–sprayed leaves. However, no significant differences between both antitranspirants on E were recorded. Increased WUE, therefore, could be attributed to a higher A by using Kaolin as compared with VG sprays. Thus, particle type antitranspirants are more effective in regulating water status, WUE and the photosynthetic activity of tuberose plants in Al-Qassim regions, Saudi Arabia.
