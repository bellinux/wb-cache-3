A <b>preliminary</b> <b>question</b> is whether the contract is reasonably certain in its essential terms, or essentialia negotii, such as price, subject matter and the identity of the parties. Generally the courts endeavour to [...] "make the agreement work", so in Hillas & Co Ltd v Arcos Ltd, the House of Lords held that an option to buy softwood of [...] "fair specification" [...] was sufficiently certain to be enforced, when read in the context of previous agreements between the parties. However the courts do not wish to [...] "make contracts for people", and so in Scammell and Nephew Ltd v Ouston, a clause stipulating the price of buying a new van as [...] "on hire purchase terms" [...] for two years was held unenforceable because there was no objective standard by which the court could know what price was intended or what a reasonable price might be. Similarly, in Baird Textile Holdings Ltd v M plc the Court of Appeal held that because the price and quantity to buy would be uncertain, in part, no term could be implied for M to give reasonable notice before terminating its purchasing agreement. Controversially, the House of Lords extended this idea by holding an agreement to negotiate towards a future contract in good faith is insufficiently certain to be enforceable.|$|E

40|$|The Emergence of Supranationality {{through the}} Procedure on <b>Preliminary</b> <b>Questions</b> Summary: The purpose of my thesis is to analyse the Emergence of Supranationality in the European Union. The reason of the thesis {{is to show}} the {{influence}} of the Procedure on <b>Preliminary</b> <b>Questions</b> before the European Court of Justice on the European integration and the main aim {{of this paper is to}} verify the hypothesis that the Procedure on <b>Preliminary</b> <b>Questions</b> before European Court of Justice emerges the Supranational paradigm of integration. The whole thesis is composed of introduction, six main chapters and conclusion. Each of the main chapters is divided into several subchapters and deals with different aspects of the whole topic. The first three chapters are more theoretical, they define basic terminology used in the thesis such as the Procedure on <b>Preliminary</b> <b>Questions</b> (its course, purpose and functions), the European Court of Justice and its position in the European Union or the two main theoretical approaches to the integration (supranational and intergovernmental paradigm). In Chapter IV, there are analysed two important decisions of European Court of Justice from the field of third pillar (C- 105 / 03 Criminal Proceeding against Maria Pupino and C- 303 / 05 Advocaten voor de Wereld).

60|$|In this lecture, I wish {{to apply}} the logical-analytic method {{to one of the}} oldest {{problems}} of philosophy, namely, the problem of our knowledge of the external world. What I have to say on this problem does not amount to an answer of a definite and dogmatic kind; it amounts only to an analysis and statement of the questions involved, with an indication of the directions in which evidence may be sought. But although not yet a definite solution, what can be said at present seems to me to throw a completely new light on the problem, and to be indispensable, not only in seeking the answer, but also in the <b>preliminary</b> <b>question</b> as to what parts of our problem may possibly have an ascertainable answer.|$|E
60|$|Our {{knowledge}} of truths, unlike our {{knowledge of}} things, has an opposite, namely error. So far as things are concerned, we may know them or not know them, {{but there is no}} positive state of mind which can be described as erroneous knowledge of things, so long, at any rate, as we confine ourselves to knowledge by acquaintance. Whatever we are acquainted with must be something; we may draw wrong inferences from our acquaintance, but the acquaintance itself cannot be deceptive. Thus there is no dualism as regards acquaintance. But as regards knowledge of truths, there is a dualism. We may believe what is false as well as what is true. We know that on very many subjects different people hold different and incompatible opinions: hence some beliefs must be erroneous. Since erroneous beliefs are often held just as strongly as true beliefs, it becomes a difficult question how they are to be distinguished from true beliefs. How are we to know, in a given case, that our belief is not erroneous? This is a question of the very greatest difficulty, to which no completely satisfactory answer is possible. There is, however, a <b>preliminary</b> <b>question</b> which is rather less difficult, and that is: What do we mean by truth and falsehood? It is this <b>preliminary</b> <b>question</b> which is to be considered in this chapter. In this chapter we are not asking how we can know whether a belief is true or false: we are asking what is meant by the question whether a belief is true or false. It is to be hoped that a clear answer to this question may help us to obtain an answer to the question what beliefs are true, but for the present we ask only 'What is truth?' and 'What is falsehood?' not 'What beliefs are true?' and 'What beliefs are false?' It is very important to keep these different questions entirely separate, since any confusion between them is sure to produce an answer which is not really applicable to either.|$|E

60|$|At {{the outset}} of an inquiry how far {{existing}} facts ought {{to be allowed to}} overrule ideas and principles that are at variance with them, a <b>preliminary</b> <b>question</b> lies in our way, about which it may be well to say something. This is the question of a dual doctrine. In plainer words, the question whether it is expedient that the more enlightened classes in a community should upon system not only possess their light in silence, but whether they should openly encourage a doctrine for the less enlightened classes which they do not believe to be true for themselves, while they regard it as indispensably useful in the case of less fortunate people. An eminent teacher tells us how after he had once succeeded in presenting the principle of Necessity to his own mind in a shape which seemed to bring with it all the advantages of the principle of Free Will, he 'no longer suffered under the burden so heavy to one who aims at being a reformer in opinions, of thinking one doctrine true, and the contrary doctrine morally beneficial.'[5] The discrepancy which this writer thought a heavy burden has struck others as the basis of a satisfactory solution.|$|E
6000|$|The real {{state of}} the case, then, is that the {{agnostic}} [...] "does not believe the authority" [...] on which [...] "these things" [...] are stated, which authority is Jesus Christ. He is simply an old-fashioned [...] "infidel" [...] who is afraid to own to his right name. As [...] "Presbyter is priest writ large," [...] so is [...] "agnostic" [...] the mere Greek equivalent for the Latin [...] "infidel." [...] There is an attractive simplicity about this solution of the problem; and it has that advantage of being somewhat offensive to the persons attacked, which is so dear to the less refined sort of controversialist. The agnostic says, [...] "I cannot find good evidence that so and so is true." [...] "Ah," [...] says his adversary, seizing his opportunity, [...] "then you declare that Jesus Christ was untruthful, for he said so and so;" [...] a very telling method of rousing prejudice. But suppose {{that the value of}} the evidence as to what Jesus may have said and done, and as to the exact nature and scope of his authority, is just that which the agnostic finds it most difficult to determine. If I venture to doubt that the Duke of Wellington gave the command [...] "Up, Guards, {332} and at 'em!" [...] at Waterloo, I do not think that even Dr. Wace would accuse me of disbelieving the Duke. Yet it would be just as reasonable to do this as to accuse any one of denying what Jesus said before the <b>preliminary</b> <b>question</b> as to what he did say is settled.|$|E
60|$|Day after day, {{with only}} short {{intervals}} of rest, Janet kept {{her place in}} that sad chamber. No wonder the sick-room and the lazaretto have so often been a refuge from the tossings of intellectual doubt--a place of repose for the worn and wounded spirit. Here is a duty about which all creeds and all philosophies are at one: here, at least, the conscience will not be dogged by doubt, the benign impulse will not be checked by adverse theory: here you may begin to act without settling one <b>preliminary</b> <b>question.</b> To moisten the sufferer's parched lips through the long night-watches, to bear up the drooping head, to lift the helpless limbs, to divine the want that can find no utterance beyond the feeble motion of the hand or beseeching glance of the eye--these are offices that demand no self-questionings, no casuistry, no assent to propositions, no weighing of consequences. Within the four walls where the stir and glare {{of the world are}} shut out, and every voice is subdued--where a human being lies prostrate, thrown on the tender mercies of his fellow, the moral relation of man to man is reduced to its utmost clearness and simplicity: bigotry cannot confuse it, theory cannot pervert it, passion, awed into quiescence, can neither pollute nor perturb it. As we bend over the sick-bed, all the forces of our nature rush towards the channels of pity, of patience, and of love, and sweep down the miserable choking drift of our quarrels, our debates, our would-be wisdom, and our clamorous selfish desires. This blessing of serene freedom from the importunities of opinion lies in all simple direct acts of mercy, and is one source of that sweet calm which is often felt by the watcher in the sick-room, even when the duties there are of a hard and terrible kind.|$|E

40|$|If appellate advocates {{could hear}} from courts about topics {{that might be}} raised during oral argument—as opposed to relying solely {{on their ability to}} {{anticipate}} the issues—might their answers be better? That seems likely, but it is unlikely that research could confirm that, as judicial practice overwhelmingly favors impromptu questioning. Spontaneity may be harmless if the question was predictable, or unavoidable if a judge just thought of the question. But sometimes advocates have to answer challenging questions concerning the law, facts, or implications of a position—questions that help decide the case, either due {{to the quality of the}} answer or the question’s effect on other judges—and all would be better served by advance notice to advocates that specific issues might come up during oral argument.

60|$|The second robbery {{to which}} Lady Eustace had been {{subjected}} {{by no means}} decreased the interest which was attached to her and her concerns in the fashionable world. Parliament had now met, and the party at Matching Priory,--Lady Glencora Palliser's party in the country,--had been to some extent broken up. All those gentlemen who were engaged {{in the service of}} Her Majesty's Government had necessarily gone to London, and they who had wives at Matching had taken their wives with them. Mr. and Mrs. Bonteen had seen the last of their holiday; Mr. Palliser himself was, of course, at his post; and all the private secretaries were with the public secretaries on the scene of action. On the 13th of February Mr. Palliser made his first great statement in Parliament on the matter of the five-farthinged penny, and pledged himself to do his very best to carry that stupendous measure through Parliament in the present session. The City men who were in the House that night,--and all the Directors of the Bank of England were in the gallery, and every chairman of a great banking company, and every Baring and every Rothschild, if there be Barings and Rothschilds who have not been returned by constituencies, and have not seats in the House by right,--agreed in declaring that the job in hand was too much for any one member or any one session. Some said that such a measure never could be passed, because the unfinished work of one session could not be used in lessening the labours of the next. Everything must be recommenced; and therefore,--so said these hopeless ones,--the penny with five farthings, the penny of which a hundred would make ten shillings, the halcyon penny, which would make all future pecuniary calculations easy to the meanest British capacity, could never become the law of the land. Others, more hopeful, were willing to believe that gradually the thing would so sink into the minds of members of Parliament, of writers of leading articles, and of the active public generally, as to admit of certain established axioms being taken as established, and placed, as it were, beyond the procrastinating power of debate. It might, for instance, at last be taken for granted that a decimal system was desirable,--so that a month or two of the spring need not be consumed on that <b>preliminary</b> <b>question.</b> But this period had not as yet been reached, and it was thought by the entire City that Mr. Palliser was much too sanguine. It was so probable, many said, that he might kill himself by labour which would be Herculean in all but success, and that no financier after him would venture to face the task. It behoved Lady Glencora to see that her Hercules did not kill himself.|$|E
