5|$|After Burgess's death, the PreCrime {{system is}} shut down. All the <b>prisoners</b> <b>are</b> unconditionally pardoned and released, {{although}} they are kept under occasional surveillance. Anderton and Lara are soon {{to have a new}} child together. The Precogs are sent to an undisclosed location to live their lives in peace.|$|E
5|$|When Miles {{reveals his}} secret {{identity}} to his girlfriend, Katie Bishop, {{she and her}} parents are revealed to be sleeper agents for the terrorist group Hydra, who then kidnap Miles, his father and Ganke, {{as part of a}} plan involving Dr. Doom. Miles and the other <b>prisoners</b> <b>are</b> freed, however, in part with help from Miles' dorm mate, Judge, Maria Hill, and other superhuman colleagues.|$|E
5|$|However, {{during the}} escort mission, Kael disappears and Sykes begins a {{search and rescue}} mission for the missing Captain. Sykes discovers a mortally wounded Kael near his crashed fighter, and it is {{revealed}} that Borvo had shot down Kael after he'd learned of the Hutt's secret plan to sell the escaped prisoners into slavery. Seeking vengeance and the freedom of his people, Sykes hunts down Borvo, assisted by a disgruntled Kotha who disagrees with Borvo's betrayal. Though the Hutt is able to escape to Nal Hutta, the <b>prisoners</b> <b>are</b> saved.|$|E
2500|$|Few <b>prisoners</b> <b>were</b> {{taken on}} any front. [...] Fifty <b>prisoners</b> <b>were</b> taken at Buna. [...] More than 200 <b>prisoners</b> <b>were</b> taken at Sanananda–Giruwa. No figure could be {{identified}} {{for the number of}} prisoners take at Gona. [...] Milner reports that 350 <b>prisoners</b> <b>were</b> taken during the fighting in Papua, indicating this includes fighting along the Kokoda Track, at Milne Bay and Goodenough Island.|$|R

50|$|The camp {{consisted}} of military barracks that held between 6 and 20 <b>prisoners</b> who <b>were</b> kept very isolated. Up to 200 <b>prisoners</b> <b>were</b> {{in the camp}} at one time. The <b>prisoners</b> <b>were</b> engaged in hard labor while at Fannrem. <b>Prisoners</b> <b>were</b> put to work as slave labor on the Thamshavn Line railroad.|$|R
5|$|In {{the course}} of the war, the camp was staffed by 7,000 members of the German Schutzstaffel (SS), {{approximately}} 12 percent of whom were later convicted of war crimes. Some, including camp commandant Rudolf Höss, were executed. The Allied Powers refused to believe early reports of the atrocities at the camp, and their failure to bomb the camp or its railways remains controversial. One hundred forty-four <b>prisoners</b> <b>are</b> known to have escaped from Auschwitz successfully, and on 7 October 1944, two Sonderkommando units—prisoners assigned to staff the gas chambers—launched a brief, unsuccessful uprising.|$|E
5|$|On board Galactica, Admiral William Adama (Edward James Olmos) {{appoints}} their Cylon prisoner Sharon Agathon (Grace Park) a Colonial {{officer and}} sends {{her to the}} planet to liaise with the resistance. When she arrives to meet with resistance members, Centurions attack, having learned of the meeting place from the intelligence Ellen provided. Simultaneously, the 200 human <b>prisoners</b> <b>are</b> being transported to a location by the Cylons and NCP. A masked Jammer, realizing {{they are to be}} executed, saves Cally by releasing her in secret and telling her to run. As she runs away, the sound of gunfire is heard.|$|E
5|$|As a maximum-security prison, it hosts {{dangerous}} {{as well as}} highly dangerous criminals, such as rapists, murderers, and child molesters. They compose half of the population, while {{a third of the}} residents are drug offenders. Sex offenders, who may face violence from other inmates, and prisoners who require close psychiatric or medical supervision, are located in Unit A, a restrictive and separated area. There is also a special unit (C8) focused on addiction recovery. Most inmates live in Units B and C, which are freer and have mixed cell blocks. Halden Prison receives both domestic and international criminals; as only around three-fifths of the <b>prisoners</b> <b>are</b> Norwegians (as of 2015), both Norwegian and English are used, and the prison has English teachers. However, fluency in Norwegian is a requirement to live in C8, because group and individual counseling is conducted in Norwegian.|$|E
25|$|<b>Prisoners</b> <b>were</b> {{injected}} with diseases, disguised as vaccinations, to study their effects. To study {{the effects of}} untreated venereal diseases, male and female <b>prisoners</b> <b>were</b> deliberately infected with syphilis and gonorrhoea, then studied. <b>Prisoners</b> <b>were</b> also repeatedly subject to rape by guards.|$|R
50|$|In 1983 and 1984, Soviet and Democratic Republic of Afghanistan (DRA) <b>prisoners</b> <b>were</b> {{brought to}} the {{fortress}} from holding cells (zindans). The <b>prisoners</b> <b>were</b> forced to perform hard labour, for example, quarrying and loading ordnance. In 1985, 12 Soviet (shuravi) and 40 Afghan <b>prisoners</b> <b>were</b> held at the Badaber fortress.|$|R
50|$|In July 1943, 374 {{political}} prisoners and POWs <b>prisoners</b> Yugoslav, <b>were</b> {{brought to the}} concentration camp. They were tasked with widening the road to Karigasniemi, Finland. After four or five months, only 111 of these <b>prisoners</b> <b>were</b> still alive. At {{the end of the}} prisoners' stay in Karasjok, before transportation out of Karasjok, 45 <b>prisoners</b> <b>were</b> massacred by the firing of small arms. At least one former <b>prisoner</b> <b>is</b> (as of 2013) still alive.|$|R
5|$|Hezbollah {{says that}} its {{continued}} hostilities against Israel are justified as reciprocal to Israeli operations against Lebanon and as retaliation {{for what they}} claim is Israel's occupation of Lebanese territory. Israel withdrew from Lebanon in 2000, and their withdrawal was verified by the United Nations as being in accordance with resolution 425 of 19 March 1978, however Lebanon considers the Shebaa farms—a 26-km² (10-mi²) piece of land captured by Israel from Syria in the 1967 war and considered by the UN to be Syrian territory occupied by Israel—to be Lebanese territory. Additionally, Hezbollah claims that three Lebanese <b>prisoners</b> <b>are</b> being held in Israel. Finally, Hezbollah consider Israel to be an illegitimate state. For these reasons, they justify their actions as acts of defensive jihad.|$|E
5|$|In {{the period}} from the 1960-s to 1986, the abuse of {{psychiatry}} for political purposes {{was reported to have}} been systematic in the Soviet Union and episodic in other Eastern European countries such as Romania, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia. The practice of incarceration of political dissidents in mental hospitals in Eastern Europe and the former USSR damaged the credibility of psychiatric practice in these states and entailed strong condemnation from the international community. Psychiatrists have been involved in human rights abuses in states across the world when the definitions of mental disease were expanded to include political disobedience. As scholars have long argued, governmental and medical institutions have at times classified threats to authority during periods of political disturbance and instability as a form of mental disease. In many countries political <b>prisoners</b> <b>are</b> still sometimes confined and abused in mental institutions.|$|E
5|$|A {{short time}} later, Luke escapes again by using string to shake a bush and {{distract}} the guards, visiting a nearby {{house where he}} uses an axe to remove his shackles. To keep the guard dogs from following his scent, he spreads curry powder and chili powder across the ground to send them into sneezing fits and overload their sensitive sense of smell. While free, Luke mails Dragline a magazine that includes a photograph of him with two beautiful women. He is soon recaptured, beaten, returned to the prison camp, and fitted with two sets of leg irons. Luke is warned by the Captain that if he ever attempts to escape again, he will be killed on the spot. Luke is now annoyed by the other prisoners fawning over the magazine photo and reveals {{it to be a}} fake. At first, the other <b>prisoners</b> <b>are</b> angry, but after a long stay in the box, when Luke is forced to eat a huge serving of rice, they come to help him finish it.|$|E
50|$|Virot {{was moved}} to camp Buchenwald. As the Allied forces were encroaching, one {{afternoon}} Virot and the other <b>prisoners</b> <b>were</b> called to an afternoon roll call. Virot knew this was suspicious, and immediately realized that the <b>prisoners</b> <b>were</b> to be shot. Suddenly, the Nazi officers ran: the Americans, who had arrived to liberate the city, threatened to kill the officers if they shot the <b>prisoners.</b> The <b>prisoners</b> <b>were</b> spared.|$|R
5000|$|There is {{evidence}} that many <b>prisoners</b> <b>were</b> abandoned in their cells during the storm, while the guards sought shelter. Hundreds of <b>prisoners</b> <b>were</b> later registered as [...] "unaccounted for".|$|R
50|$|Upon {{his death}} sentence, Kuttimani {{was sent to}} the Welikada (Welikade) maximum-security prison to wait for his execution. There were both Sinhala and Tamil prisoners. The Sinhala <b>prisoners</b> <b>were</b> convicted of {{criminal}} offences such as murder, rape, robbery, etc. The Tamil <b>prisoners</b> <b>were</b> all freedom fighters. The Sinhala and Tamil <b>prisoners</b> <b>were</b> kept apart all the time to avoid racial clashes between them.|$|R
5|$|Rodrigues {{is taken}} to Nagasaki, where he is imprisoned with many Japanese converts. At a tribunal, he is told Catholic {{doctrine}} is anathema to Japan. Rodrigues demands to see governor Inoue Masashige, who he learns, to his dismay, is the old man seated before him {{in charge of the}} proceedings. Rodrigues is returned to prison, and Kichijiro soon arrives to be imprisoned as well. He explains to Rodrigues that court officials threatened him in order that he betray Rodrigues. Kichijiro then says he is a Christian and asks to be absolved of his betrayal through a confession, which Rodrigues reluctantly grants him. He later is released after being told to step on a fumi-e (a crudely carved crucifix), an act symbolizing rejection of the faith. Later, Rodrigues is brought under guard to the shoreline to await someone. In the far distance, he witnesses an emaciated Garupe and three other prisoners approaching on the shoreline under separate guard. Still in the distance, the three other <b>prisoners</b> <b>are</b> taken offshore on a small boat and are about to be drowned from the boat one-by-one as an inducement to get Garupe to renounce his faith. Rodrigues is restrained by guards on shore as he watches Garupe refuse to apostatize. He then sees the desperate Garupe drowned next to the other three prisoners when he attempts to swim offshore trying to rescue the last prisoner from being drowned.|$|E
5|$|SS-Untersturmführer (second lieutenant) Amon Göth {{arrives in}} Kraków to oversee {{construction}} of Płaszów concentration camp. When {{the camp is}} completed, he orders the ghetto liquidated. Many people are shot and killed {{in the process of}} emptying the ghetto. Schindler witnesses the massacre and is profoundly affected. He particularly notices a tiny girl in a red coat – one of the few splashes of color in the black-and-white film – as she hides from the Nazis, and later sees her body (identifiable by the red coat) among those on a wagon load of corpses. Schindler is careful to maintain his friendship with Göth and, through bribery and lavish gifts, continues to enjoy SS support. Göth brutally mistreats his Jewish maid Helen Hirsch and randomly shoots people from the balcony of his villa, and the <b>prisoners</b> <b>are</b> in constant fear for their lives. As time passes, Schindler's focus shifts from making money to trying to save as many lives as possible. To better protect his workers, Schindler bribes Göth into allowing him to build a sub-camp.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins on}} a city {{sidewalk}} where Scherzinger walks into a telephone booth as several men in black suits pass by the booth. As Scherzinger begins to undress, the men stop to stare as she begins taking off her glasses and shaking her hair back. The video then moves to Scherzinger in a dress walking past four men mopping the floor to a supply closet where she enters and reappears moments later, {{dressed in a black}} body suit with a cape. As the chorus begins, the situation rapidly switches back-and-forth from Scherzinger in her good-girl persona shown fighting escaped jail prisoners dressed in striped suits (and Beagle Boys masks) to Scherzinger in her bad-girl persona fighting with police. As the song progresses, Scherzinger is shown in a classic looking automobile and riding a BMW motorcycle, with a streaking white and black background. Several shots of her bad-girl persona alone in a room with two <b>prisoners</b> <b>are</b> then shown. As the bridge begins, she is shown in her good-girl ego standing by a podium, talking to a group of reporters while waving her hands in the air. As the bridge ends, she brings her hands down, blowing back all of the reporters, who then begin dancing and pumping their arms to the song. The video moves to Scherzinger dancing with the police and prisoners before ending with her blowing away the two men who were in the room with her and walking away.|$|E
50|$|Under Nebraska's {{discretionary}} parole system, all <b>prisoners</b> <b>were</b> reviewed {{each year}} {{regardless of whether}} they were yet eligible for parole. At this initial hearing, the Board examined the prisoner's entire preconfinement and postconfinement record and considered any statements or letters the prisoner presented on his own behalf. If the Board determined at this initial hearing that the <b>prisoner</b> <b>was</b> not suitable for parole, then parole was denied and the <b>prisoner</b> <b>was</b> informed as to the Board's reasons for denying parole. If, however, the Board determined at the initial hearing that the <b>prisoner</b> <b>was</b> suitable for parole, then it scheduled a final parole hearing. At this final parole hearing, the <b>prisoner</b> <b>was</b> permitted to present evidence on his behalf and to be represented by private counsel of his choice. He was not, however, permitted to cross-examine witnesses or hear any evidence presented against him. The hearing was recorded. If the Board denied parole at this final hearing, the <b>prisoner</b> <b>was</b> furnished with a written explanation within 30 days.|$|R
50|$|A {{report from}} a 1915 visit by the Board of Charities and Correction {{indicated}} that {{the average number of}} <b>prisoners</b> <b>was</b> 3.7. The white male <b>prisoners</b> <b>were</b> kept in a large room. African-American <b>prisoners</b> <b>were</b> kept in four cells. There was one room for female <b>prisoners,</b> but it <b>was</b> rarely occupied. Oconee County {{was one of the few}} in South Carolina that served three meals each day. The prisoners did practically no labor.|$|R
60|$|The {{proprietor}} of the so-called sanitarium was also arrested, and both <b>prisoners</b> <b>were</b> driven down to the Brooklyn police station. A hearing was had, and the <b>prisoners</b> <b>were</b> held for trial.|$|R
25|$|In general, in Canada, <b>prisoners</b> <b>are</b> {{eligible}} {{to apply for}} full parole after serving one-third of their sentences. <b>Prisoners</b> <b>are</b> also {{eligible to}} apply for day parole, and can do this before being eligible to apply for full parole.|$|E
