40|$|Many {{economists and}} analysts claim that {{extended}} use of <b>pollution</b> <b>charges</b> in environmental policy will have substantial efficiency advantages in transition economies. This article challenges this view and argues instead that the pro-posed policy presumes {{the existence of}} an already-functioning institutional framework. By focusing on the Russian case, the article discusses a number of reasons why it is difficult to implement <b>pollution</b> <b>charges</b> in an economic sys-tem in which Communist behavioral patterns and jurisdictions are still preva-lent. By drawing on the new institutional economics literature, the authors identi-fy institutional obstacles related both to enterprise behavior and to environ-mental monitoring. These obstacles suggest that it is appropriate to view envi-ronmental problems in transition economies primarily as the results of institu-tional inertia in the economic and political systems. The article ends by discuss-ing alternative ways of controlling pollution in Russia and stresses the impor-tance of improving the legitimacy and basic trust for environmental legislation. The ongoing transition from a totalitarian to a democratic political sys-tem in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) and the former Soviet Union (FSU) has led to a recognition of the broad-scale environmental degrada-tion that took place during the Communist era. As a consequence, most post-Communist countries are now looking for ways to implement more efficient and more effective environmental polices. In this respect, the typical advice from economists and policy analysts in the West has been to use economic incentives, such as <b>pollution</b> <b>charges,</b> more extensively in controlling pollution (e. g., Bluffstone & Larson, 1997; Klarer, 1994...|$|R
