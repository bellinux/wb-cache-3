40|$|Structural {{properties}} of mixed Poisson processes {{have always been}} of specific importance in the field on insurance mathematics since they are widely used in the modelling of claim num-ber processes, especially in non-life insurance (see Albrecht (1985) for a general survey). Recently, Helter and Pfeifer (1987) have shown that a mixed Poisson process can be character-ized among the class of <b>pure</b> <b>birth</b> <b>processes</b> by martingale {{properties of}} certain transforma-tions of the occurrence times of the process. These transformations are connected with the intensities of the <b>birth</b> <b>process,</b> and give rise to strong limit theorems due to the Martingale Convergence Theorem. The aim of the present paper is to investigate which kind of trans-formations besides intensities render the occurrence times of a mixed Poisson process a martingale, and give characterizations of mixed Poisson processes {{in the class of}} birth proces-ses by martingale properties of such transformations. Among other results, it is shown that such transformations are essentially ratios of derivatives of completely monotonic functions (see Bernstein (I 928)), and thus natural generalizations of the intensities of mixed Poisson processes (ee Lundberg (1940)). 2.

40|$|The {{stochastic}} {{nature of}} pitting corrosion of metallic structures {{has been widely}} recognized. It is assumed {{that this kind of}} deterioration retains no memory of the past, so only {{the current state of the}} damage influences its future development. This characteristic allows pitting corrosion to be categorized as a Markov process. In this paper, two different models of pitting corrosion, developed using Markov chains, are presented. Firstly, a continuous-time, nonhomogeneous linear growth (<b>pure</b> <b>birth)</b> Markov <b>process</b> is used to model external pitting corrosion in underground pipelines. A closed-form solution of the system of Kolmogorov's forward equations is used to describe the transition probability function in a discrete pit depth space. The transition probability function is identified by correlating the stochastic pit depth mean with the empirical deterministic mean. In the second model, the distribution of maximum pit depths in a pitting experiment is successfully modeled after the combination of two stochastic processes: pit initiation and pit growth. Pit generation is modeled as a nonhomogeneous Poisson process, in which induction time is simulated as the realization of a Weibull process. Pit growth is simulated using a nonhomogeneous Markov process. An analytical solution of Kolmogorov's system of equations is also found for the transition probabilities from the first Markov state. Extreme value statistics is employed to find the distribution of maximum pit depths...|$|R
