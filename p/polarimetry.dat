Groups such as ZIMPOL/CHEOPS and PlanetPol are currently using polarimeters to search for extrasolar planets.

25|$|In ophthalmology, {{binocular}} retinal birefringence {{screening of}} the Henle fibers (photoreceptor axons that go radially outward from the fovea) provides a reliable detection of strabismus and possibly also of anisometropic amblyopia. Furthermore, scanning laser <b>polarimetry</b> utilises the birefringence of the optic nerve fibre layer to indirectly quantify its thickness, which is of use in the assessment and monitoring of glaucoma.|$|E
25|$|Birefringence {{and other}} polarization-based optical effects (such as optical {{rotation}} and linear or circular dichroism) {{can be measured}} by measuring {{the changes in the}} polarization of light passing through the material. These measurements are known as <b>polarimetry.</b> Polarized light microscopes, which contain two polarizers that are at 90° to each other {{on either side of the}} sample, are used to visualize birefringence. The addition of quarter-wave plates permit examination of circularly polarized light. Birefringence measurements have been made with phase-modulated systems for examining the transient flow behavior of fluids.|$|E
25|$|Screening for {{glaucoma}} {{is usually}} performed {{as part of}} a standard eye examination performed by optometrists and ophthalmologists. Testing for glaucoma should include measurements of the intraocular pressure via tonometry, anterior chamber angle examination or gonioscopy, and examination of the optic nerve to look for any visible damage to it, or change in the cup-to-disc ratio and also rim appearance and vascular change. A formal visual field test should be performed. The retinal nerve fiber layer can be assessed with imaging techniques such as optical coherence tomography, scanning laser <b>polarimetry,</b> and/or scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (Heidelberg retinal tomogram).|$|E
25|$|If two {{polarizer}}s {{are placed}} {{one after another}} (the second polarizer is generally called an analyzer), the mutual angle between their polarizing axes gives the value of θ in Malus's law. If the two axes are orthogonal, the polarizers are crossed and in theory no light is transmitted, though again practically speaking no polarizer is perfect and the transmission is not exactly zero (for example, crossed Polaroid sheets appear slightly blue in colour). If a transparent object is placed between the crossed polarizers, any polarization effects present in the sample (such as birefringence) will be shown as an increase in transmission. This effect is used in <b>polarimetry</b> to measure the optical activity of a sample.|$|E
500|$|The {{component}} of the radial velocity observed through line broadening depends on the inclination of the star's pole {{to the line of}} sight. The derived value is given as , where ve is the rotational velocity at the equator and i is the inclination. However, i is not always known, so the result gives a minimum value for the star's rotational velocity. That is, if i is not a right angle, then the actual velocity is greater than [...] This is sometimes referred to as the projected rotational velocity. In fast rotating stars <b>polarimetry</b> offers a method of recovering the actual velocity rather than just the rotational velocity; this technique has so far been applied only to Regulus.|$|E

2500|$|Roberto Mignani at the National Institute for Astrophysics in Milan who led {{the team}} of astronomers has commented that [...] "“When Einstein {{came up with the}} theory of general {{relativity}} 100 years ago, he had no idea that it would be used for navigational systems. The consequences of this discovery probably will also have to be realised on a longer timescale.” The team found that visible light from the star had undergone linear polarisation of around 16%. If the birefringence had been caused by light passing through interstellar gas or plasma, the effect should have been no more than 1%. Definitive proof would require repeating the observation at other wavelengths and on other neutron stars. At X-ray wavelengths the polarization from the quantum fluctuations should be near 100%. Although no telescope currently exists that can make such measurements, there are several proposed X-ray telescopes that may soon be able to verify the result conclusively such as ESO's European Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), China's Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope (HXMT) and NASA's Imaging X-ray <b>Polarimetry</b> Explorer (IXPE).|$|E
