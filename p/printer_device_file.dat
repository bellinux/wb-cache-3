It has a printer name of BASIC255 {{and opens the}} device that is the default printer for the {{terminal}} that begins a BASIC session. If desired, {{it is possible to}} create a different printer file numbered between 1 and 254. Use [...] "OPEN #x: PRINTER,NAME=" [...] and so forth to do this, specifying columns or device ID or other parameters as needed. The PAGEOFLOW keyword can be used to trap the page overflow condition for the printer.|$|R

5000|$|In some Unix-like systems, most <b>device</b> <b>files</b> {{are managed}} {{as part of}} a virtual file system {{traditionally}} mounted at /dev, possibly associated with a controlling daemon, which monitors hardware addition and removal at run time, making corresponding changes to the <b>device</b> <b>file</b> system if that's not automatically done by the kernel, and possibly invoking scripts in system or user space to handle special device needs. The FreeBSD and DragonFly BSD implementations have named the virtual <b>device</b> <b>file</b> system devfs and the associated daemon devd. Linux primarily uses a user space implementation known as udev, but there are many variants. Darwin, and operating systems such as macOS based on it, have a purely kernel-based <b>device</b> <b>file</b> system.|$|R

The I 2 C driver makes the TPM chip appear as a <b>device</b> <b>file</b> in Linux, and the TPM driver maintains the I/O state of the <b>device</b> <b>file.</b> The TPM driver provides operations tpmSend and tpmReceive to send and receive data from the TPM chip. If the <b>device</b> <b>file</b> is closed, the TPM driver initializes the device, and then opens the <b>device</b> <b>file,</b> which is then ready to be read and written. The TPM driver can also output the raw bytes to and from the TPM chip for facilitating debugging.|$|R
