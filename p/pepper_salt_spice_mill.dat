50|$|Food burr mills {{are usually}} {{manufactured}} {{for a single}} purpose: coffee beans, dried peppercorns, coarse <b>salt,</b> <b>spices,</b> or poppy seeds, for example. Coffee mills are usually powered by electric motors; domestic <b>pepper,</b> <b>salt,</b> and <b>spice</b> <b>mills,</b> used to sprinkle a little seasoning on food, are usually operated manually, sometimes by a battery-powered motor.|$|R

A few designs have abrasive surfaces which do not rotate; each squeeze of the handles moves one flat plate past another, then the plates are restored to their original position by a spring. Many hard spices are available in containers incorporating a simple cone burr grinder, intended to be discarded when empty.|$|R

40|$|Garlic and <b>salt</b> <b>spice</b> {{is widely}} used in Brazilian cookery, {{but it has a}} high sodium content; as high sodium intake has been {{strongly}} correlated to the incidence of chronic diseases. This study aimed to develop a garlic and <b>salt</b> <b>spice</b> with reduced sodium intake. Sensory evaluation was conducted by applying the spices to cooked rice. First, the optimal concentration of spice added during rice preparation was determined. Subsequently, seasonings (3 : 1) were prepared containing 0 %, 50 % and 25 % less NaCl using a mixture of salts consisting of KCl and monosodium glutamate; a seasoning with a 0 % NaCl reduction was established as a control. Three formulations of rice with different spices were assessed according to sensory testing acceptance, time-intensity and temporal domain of sensations. The proportions of salts used in the garlic and <b>salt</b> <b>spice</b> did not generate a strange or bad taste in the products; instead, the mixtures were less salty. However, the seasonings with lower sodium levels (F 2 and F 3) were better accepted in comparison to the traditional seasoning (F 1). Therefore, a mixture of NaCl, KCl and monosodium glutamate is a viable alternative to develop a garlic and <b>salt</b> <b>spice</b> with reduced sodium intake...|$|R
