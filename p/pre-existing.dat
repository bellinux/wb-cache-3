5|$|Although not {{commonly}} {{understood as}} Gnostic, many scholars, including Bultmann, have forcefully {{argued that the}} Gospel of John has elements in common with Gnosticism. Christian Gnosticism did not fully develop until the mid-2nd century, and so 2nd-century Proto-Orthodox Christians concentrated much effort in examining and refuting it. To say John's gospel contained elements of Gnosticism is to assume that Gnosticism had developed to a level that required the author to respond to it. Bultmann, for example, argued that the opening theme of the Gospel of John, the <b>pre-existing</b> Logos, was actually a Gnostic theme. Other scholars, e.g. Raymond E. Brown {{have argued that the}} <b>pre-existing</b> Logos theme arises from the more ancient Jewish writings in the eighth chapter of the Book of Proverbs, and was fully developed as a theme in Hellenistic Judaism by Philo Judaeus.|$|E

5|$|Many actin-related {{molecules}} {{create a}} free barbed end for polymerization by uncapping or severing <b>pre-existing</b> filaments and using these as actin nucleation cores. However, the Arp2/3 complex stimulates actin polymerization {{by creating a}} new nucleation core. Actin nucleation is an initial step {{in the formation of}} an actin filament. The nucleation core activity of Arp2/3 is activated by members of the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome family protein (WASP, N-WASP, WAVE, and WASH proteins). The V domain of a WASP protein interacts with actin monomers while the CA region associates with the Arp2/3 complex to create a nucleation core. However, de novo nucleation followed by polymerization is not sufficient to form integrated actin networks, since these newly synthesized polymers would not be associated with <b>pre-existing</b> filaments. Thus, the Arp2/3 complex binds to <b>pre-existing</b> filaments so that the new filaments can grow on the old ones and form a functional actin cytoskeleton. Capping proteins limit actin polymerization to the region activated by the Arp2/3 complex, and the elongated filament ends are recapped to prevent depolymerization and thus conserve the actin filament.|$|E
