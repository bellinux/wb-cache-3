40|$|Over 400 {{tree species}} are primary or {{secondary}} hosts of gypsy moth. Interactions between host plant compounds and a viral pathogen such as {{nuclear polyhedrosis virus}} (NPV) in vivo may explain gypsy moth host preference in later instars. Phenolic extracts from pines negatively affected growth of 2 nd and 3 rd but not 4 th instars when incorporated into artificial diet at low concentrations. The aglycone quercetin, and two of its glycosides found in pines, rutin and quercetin- 3 -O-glucoside, also reduced growth for 2 nd and 3 rd instars. When 3 rd instars were dosed with NPV (60, 000 PIBs/larva) and fed <b>pine</b> <b>extract</b> (0. 1 %) in diet, growth was reduced and mortality increased. Survivorship to adulthood was not significantly higher than control for 3 rd instars fed pine extracts over a range of viral doses, nor was it higher for 4 th instars dosed at 60, 000 PIBs/larvae. The three flavonoids also tended to have negative and synergistic effects on growth and survivorship of 3 rd and 4 th instars does with 60, 000 PIBs/larva. These results suggest that early instars of gypsy moth are quite sensitive to pine phenolics in diet, {{which may explain why}} they do not feed on pines in those instars. Gypsy moth is more tolerant of pine phenolics in later instars but these results do not support the hypothesis that gypsy moth later instars which feed on plant hosts such as pine, gain some protection from infectivity of NPV due to the phenolics present in those hosts...|$|E

Due to their high phenolic compound content, fruits and other plant materials provide a good alternative to conventional antioxidants. Plum, grape seed extract, cranberry, pomegranate, bearberry, <b>pine</b> bark <b>extract,</b> rosemary, oregano, other spices, irradiated almond skins, and green tea have functionality as antioxidants in meat and poultry products. Pomegranate, <b>pine</b> bark <b>extract,</b> cinnamon, and cloves have exhibited stronger antioxidant properties than some of the synthetic antioxidants currently used by the meat and poultry industry. Of the discussed natural antioxidants, grape seed extract, cranberry, sage extract, thyme extract, basil <b>extract,</b> ginger <b>extract,</b> <b>pine</b> bark <b>extract,</b> and a Chinese 5 -spice blend had the highest percent antioxidant activity (% AOA). (The quality of the antioxidant used may also impact its ability to function as an antioxidant).

40|$|Polyphenolic {{compounds}} occurring {{naturally in}} knotwood of plants {{are known to}} have antimicrobial effects. The knots (i. e. the branch bases inside tree stems) and outer branches in pine trees contain a remarkably high concentration of phenolic stilbenes, while lignans are the major phenolic constituents of spruce knots. Large amount of these phenolic compounds can be extracted from wood knots at pulp and paper mills where their presence is undesirable. In Finland, marinating of broiler meat is done not only to increase or add value to the meat, but also to enhance the safety and shelf-life. These products are usually packed under a modified atmosphere for further protection against spoilage microorganisms. However, studies have revealed that addition of marinades to poultry products do not have an inhibitory effect on either some psychrotrophic anaerobic bacteria, such as Brochothrix thermosphacta or lactic acid bacteria associated with spoilage. Also, the activity of pathogenic Campylobacter jejuni is not affected by marinating. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the inhibitory and lethal activities of extracts from spruce (Picea spp.) and pine (Pinus spp.) knotwood and outer branches that are dissolved in ethanol against the spoilage microorganisms in modified atmosphere packaged marinated broiler products. Modified atmosphere packaged broiler products were separately inoculated with ‘normal’ marinades, marinades with 70 % ethanol, marinades with a mixture of spruce and <b>pine</b> <b>extracts</b> dissolved in 70 % ethanol or mixture of spruce and <b>pine</b> <b>extracts</b> in powder form.

Methods Eleven volunteers received a single dose of 300 mg <b>pine</b> bark <b>extract,</b> five volunteers ingested 200 mg daily {{for five days}} to reach steady state concentrations. Plasma samples were obtained before and at defined time points after intake of the extract. Samples were analyzed by HPLC with ion-pair reagents and simultaneous UV and electrochemical detection. Results We quantified total plasma concentrations of catechin, caffeic acid, ferulic acid, taxifolin and the metabolite M 1 (δ-(3, 4 -dihydroxy-phenyl) -γ-valerolactone). Additionally, we describe plasma time courses and steady state appearance of ten so far unknown compounds, U 1 to U 10. After single ingestion, compounds derived from the extract were rapidly absorbed {{and the majority of}} them were detectable over whole experimental period of 14 h.

It was observed that the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were 6. 25, 0. 78, 0. 78, and 12. 5 (mg/ml) of acetol, furfural, 5 -methyl furfural, and terpine- 4 -ol, respectively. MICs of furfural and 5 -methyl furfural had the same order of magnitude as that of an antifungal agrochemical, chlorothalonil. Although furfural itself can not be completely substituted for an antifungal agrochemical, a partial mixture of furfural and antifungal agro-chemical {{may be used as}} a substitute. The use of agrochemicals for the prevention of plant disease caused by pathogenic fungus such as A. mali could be partially reduced by the application of this mixture...|$|R
40|$|Japanese {{red pine}} (Pinus densiflora) is widely present in China, Japan, and Korea. Its green pine leaves have {{traditionally}} {{been used as a}} food as well as a coloring agent. After being shed, pine leaves change their color from green to brown within two years, and al-though the brown pine leaves are abundantly available, their value has not been closely as-sessed. In this study, we investigated the potential anti-photoaging properties of brown pine leaves for skin. Brown <b>pine</b> leaf <b>extract</b> (BPLE) inhibited UVB-induced matrix metalloprotei-nase- 1 (MMP- 1) expression {{to a greater extent than}} <b>pine</b> leaf <b>extract</b> (PLE) in human kerati-nocytes and a human skin equivalent model. HPLC analysis revealed that the quantity of trans-communic acid (TCA) and dehydroabietic acid (DAA) significantly increases when the pine leaf color changes from green to brown. BPLE and TCA elicited reductions in UVB-in-duced MMP- 1 mRNA expression and activator protein- 1 (AP- 1) transactivation by reducing DNA binding activity of phospho-c-Jun, c-fos and Fra- 1. BPLE and TCA also inhibited UVB-induced Akt phosphorylation, but not mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK), known reg-ulators of AP- 1 transactivation. We additionally found that BPLE and TCA inhibited phos...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to evaluate the antimicrobial activities of the <b>pine</b> bark <b>extract</b> (Pinus pinea) which grows at Western parts of Turkey (Çine, Ayd›n) and Pycnogenol ® in cooked red meat against Staphylococcus aureus. For this purpose, P. pinea and Pycnogenol ® were added at 1 % concentration to raw meat. S. aureus was inoculated at 103 cfu g- 1 concentration to cooked meat. After that, meat was stored at 4 ˚C for 9 days. P. pinea reduced the numbers of S. aureus detected, which were 7. 9 x 102 cfu/g after 6 days and 7. 1 x 102 cfu/g after 9 days; whereas, the values for Pycnogenol® were 8. 6 x 102 cfu/g and 9. 8 x 102 cfu/g, respectively. On the other hand, values of 13. 7 x 102, 17. 2 x 102 cfu/g were obtained for the control after 6 and 9 days of storage. Therefore, P. pinea and Pycnogenol ® tested on cooked red meat reduced the numbers of S. aureus during storage when compared with the control. Results presented here may suggest that the use of <b>pine</b> bark <b>extracts</b> may provide protection against S. aureus, and thus, they present a potential {{to be used as a}} natural preservative in food industry...|$|R
40|$|Flavonoids {{are known}} to be {{effective}} scavengers of free radicals. In particular, proanthocyanidins are flavonoids that possess cardiovascular protection, antioxidative activities, and immunomodulatory activities. Here, we evaluated proanthocyanidin contents in the total polyphenolic compounds of <b>pine</b> needle <b>extracts</b> prepared by hot water, ethanol, hexane, hot water-hexane (HWH), and hot water-ethanol (HWE). Analysis of each extract indicated that the ethanol extract contained the highest proanthocyanidin concentration. The HWH and hexane extracts also contained relatively high concentrations of proanthocyanidin. On the other hand, proanthocyanidin content analyses out of the total polyphenolic compounds indicated that the HWH extract contained the highest content. These results suggest that HWH extraction is a suitable method to obtain an extract {{with a high level of}} pure proanthocyanidins and a relatively high yield. The HWH extract possessed superior activity in diverse antioxidative analyses such as 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), ferrous ion chelating (FIC), and ferric-ion reducing power (FRAP) assays. In addition, upon assessing the effects of the <b>pine</b> needle <b>extracts</b> on macrophages (Raw 264. 7 cell), the HWH extract exhibited the highest activity. In this study, we discerned an efficient extraction method to achieve relatively pure proanthocyanidins from pine needles and evaluated the biological functions of the resulting extract, which could potentially be used for its efficacious components in functional food products...|$|R
40|$|This {{experiment}} was conducted as completely randomized design (CRD) with factorial arrangement (4 × 3) including {{three levels of}} extract and four incubation times (10, 20, 30 and 40 days) to evaluate the effect of alcoholic <b>extract</b> of <b>pine</b> tree leaves under in vitro conditions to inhibit the growth of Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus Niger on the biomass of wet corn. Pine tree leaves were collected in autumn and their extract prepared using ethanol and used at concentrations of 0, 1 and 2 percent. Mass commercial corn was purchased from the factory. Ten grams of corn were mixed with 90 ml of saline solution and stirred several times, then serially diluted and the volume of 0. 1 ml {{was placed on the}} culture medium.   The samples were incubated at 25 oC for one week and the growth of fungi were checked every 24 hours from the second day of incubation. The fungus colonies were counted visually. The results indicated that 1 and 2 % of <b>pine</b> leaf <b>extract</b> effectively reduced the number of fungi colonies at days 10 and 20 of incubation and the growth of fungi were completely inhibited on days 30 and 40 of incubation.

40|$|The {{rheology}} {{of solutions}} of extracts from {{the bark of}} Pinus radiata was investigated {{in the presence of}} poly(ethylene glycol) s (PEGs) of different molecular weights. PEG with a molecular weight of 4600 (1 % w/w) was sufficient to reduce the viscosity of a concentrated (40 % w/w) <b>pine</b> tannin <b>extract</b> by one order of magnitude. The reduction of the viscosity was due to the inhibition of molecular association via hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions between tannin and PEG and depended on the molecular weight of PEG.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the phenolic acid, proanthocyanidin (PAs), and flavonol glycoside contents, as well as the antioxidant activities of <b>pine</b> needle <b>extracts</b> from six species of young <b>pine</b> trees. The <b>extracts</b> were prepared from Section Pinus (Diploxylon) : P. densiflora, P. sylvestris, P. pinaster and P. pinea, and Section Strobus (Haploxylon) : P. koraiensis and P. strobus. Phenolics were <b>extracted</b> from <b>pine</b> needles with 80 % acetone to obtain the soluble free fraction, and insoluble residues were digested with 4 M NaOH to obtain bound ethyl acetate and bound water fractions. Phenolics were analyzed by HPLC, and the hydrophilic antioxidant activity was measured using oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC). Total phenolic and flavonoid contents of the soluble free fraction were higher than those of the bound ethyl acetate and bound water fractions. The main phenolics were monomers and polymers of PAs in the soluble free fraction, and phenolic acids and flavonol glycosides in bound ethyl acetate fraction. Flavonol glycosides found in different species of pine needles were qualitatively similar within fractions, but composition varied among Pinus sections. High levels of kaempferol arabinoside and an unknown compound were present in all Strobus species. The soluble free fraction had the highest antioxidant activity, followed by bound ethyl acetate and bound water fractions...|$|R
