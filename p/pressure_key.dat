50|$|The dynamic {{behavior}} of a pneumatic tire is closely connected to its inflation <b>pressure.</b> <b>Key</b> factors like braking distance and lateral stability require the inflation pressures to be adjusted and kept as specified by the vehicle manufacturer. Extreme under-inflation can even lead to thermal and mechanical overload caused by overheating and subsequent, sudden destruction of the tire itself. Additionally, fuel efficiency and tire wear are severely affected by under-inflation. Tires do not only leak air if punctured, they also leak air naturally, and over a year, even a typical new, properly mounted tire can lose from 20 to 60 kPa (3 to 9 psi), roughly 10% or even more of its initial pressure.|$|E

40|$|The {{past few}} years of {{research}} in human evolutionary genetics have provided novel insights and questions regarding how human adaptations to recent selective pressures have taken place. Here, we review the advances most relevant to understanding human evolution in response to pathogen-induced selective <b>pressures.</b> <b>Key</b> insights come from theoretical models of adaptive evolution, particularly those that consider spatially structured populations, and from empirical population genomic studies of adaptive evolution in humans. We also review the CCR 5 -Δ 32 HIV resistance allele {{as a case study}} of pathogen resistance in humans. Taken together, the results make clear that the human response to pathogen-induced selection pressures depends on a complex interplay between the age of the pathogen, the genetic basis of potential resistance phenotypes, and how population structure impacts the adaptive process in humans...|$|R

40|$|Since 2009, South Africa {{has seen}} {{a major shift in}} {{emphasis}} concerning monitoring and evaluation (M&E) systems. This shift was partially stimulated by the South African government being faced with a number of <b>pressures,</b> <b>key</b> amongst which were persistent poverty and inequality and widespread service delivery protests. These pressures resulted ina greater willingness by government to address the poor quality of public services, and other governance problems that needed a greater focus on M&E to address these challenges. This led to the establishment of the Department of Performance Monitoring and Evaluation (DPME) in early 2010. A comprehensive survey on the state and use of M&E systems in national and provincial government was conducted by the DPME as an attempt to understand the M&E landscape since 1994. The results were used to make informed policy and programme decisions. This paper outlines the findings of the survey. </p...|$|R

Using the 1988 - 1998 GSS, we compared respondents by class, by whether or not they had children at home, and by how many hours spouses worked each week (and we controlled for several other factors, including religion of origin). Generally, Americans sustained their religious involvements despite high work and family commitments. Two exceptions: One, long work hours for wives depressed middle-class couples church attendance.
