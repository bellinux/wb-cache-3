40|$|Recent {{developments}} and {{reforms in the}} Russian payments system are discussed {{from the perspective of}} their impact on monetary policy. The large and highly variable payment float in the balance sheet of the Central Bank of Russia has complicated the conduct of monetary policy. However, reforms in late 1992 and early 1993 have been effective, as judged from their impact in reducing the level and variability of float, and have set the stage for medium-term reforms of the payments system. Rapid progress in the implementation of these reforms, and their appropriate coordination with monetary operations, remain critical to meet the emerging needs in money and foreign exchange markets, and to support the transition to indirect methods of monetary control.

It started it's operations in Bangladesh at the end of 2013 and within a very short span of time, has become quite popular. Kaymu replicates the eBay model of buying and selling where sellers sell on Kaymu in exchange of a commission percentage on sales. Kaymu is an online marketplace where sellers and buyers meet and exchange goods. Buyer can order anything from Kaymu and pay via cash on delivery (especially in Dhaka) and can receive products via home delivery all over Bangladesh (some sellers take <b>prepayment</b> via bank <b>account</b> or mobile banking).

Problems arise when delivery systems become unable to take the pressure and buyers suffer. Kaymu is still on the lookout for a dependable delivery partner. Financially Kaymu hopes to break even within the third year. Currently it runs from parent company funding and focuses on investing heavily on marketing to gain market share. Kaymu's revenue has hundred folded since it's inception and it is on the rise. Kaymu looks to bring on board more sellers to give the buyers more variety of products and at competitive rates.
