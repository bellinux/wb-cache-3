5|$|From {{passage in}} 1961 until {{approximately}} 1971, political officials were not prosecuted under the Travel Act. Since then, however, <b>prosecutors</b> <b>and</b> courts alike {{have found the}} Travel Act to be another valuable weapon in their continuing battle against the debilitating effects of political corruption.|$|E
5|$|In October 2012, federal <b>prosecutors</b> <b>and</b> FBI {{agents in}} Washington, D.C. {{investigated}} Jackson for alleged financial improprieties, including possible misuse of campaign funds. Sixteen days after being re-elected to another term, Jackson resigned effective on November 21, 2012, citing his {{health problems and}} acknowledging the ethics investigations.|$|E
5|$|On March 5, 1868, the {{impeachment}} trial {{began in the}} Senate and lasted almost three months; Congressmen George S. Boutwell, Benjamin Butler and Thaddeus Stevens acted as managers for the House, or <b>prosecutors,</b> <b>and</b> William M. Evarts, Benjamin R. Curtis and former Attorney General Stanbery were Johnson's counsel; Chief Justice Chase served as presiding judge.|$|E
50|$|In {{terms of}} section 105A(9), {{if the court}} is not {{satisfied}} that the agreement is just, it informs the <b>prosecutor</b> <b>and</b> the accused of what it considers a just sentence. The <b>prosecutor</b> <b>and</b> the accused may then abide by the agreement on the charge (for example, {{if there has been}} a plea to a lesser charge), whereupon the court convicts and proceeds to the sentence stage. The <b>prosecutor</b> <b>and</b> the accused at this point have the right to address the court and adduce evidence on sentence.|$|R

5|$|The Norwegian Prosecuting Authority is {{integrated}} into the Norwegian Police Service. The authority is divided into a higher and lower authority, with the higher authority (public prosecutor) being a separate government agency and the lower authority (police prosecutor) being members of the police. The latter includes chief of police, deputy chief of police, police <b>prosecutors</b> <b>and</b> deputy police prosecutors. In questions of prosecution the police districts are subordinate to the Norwegian Prosecuting Authority and in other matters subordinate to the National Police Directorate.|$|E
5|$|The court further {{considered}} whether {{invocation of}} Miranda rights could be implied from the behavior or ambiguous {{words of the}} accused. It concluded (in line with previous cases such as Davis v. United States) that there was good reason why invoking these rights should require an unambiguous act of the accused, including certainty for police, <b>prosecutors,</b> <b>and</b> accused, and social benefit in law enforcement.|$|E
5|$|However, Soeprapto {{also came}} into {{conflict}} with Minister of Justice Moeljatno {{over the role of}} the prosecution. Moeljatno took the traditional view that the prosecutor general's office, {{under the control of the}} Ministry of Justice during the Dutch colonial period, was in a similar station after independence; on the other hand, Soeprapto believed that the function of the prosecutor general was half executive and half judicial and as such demanded to be accountable only to the cabinet. This conflict climaxed with Moeljatno drafting a bill to explicitly make the prosecutor general subservient to the Minister of Justice, which passed in October 1956 over heavy opposition from <b>prosecutors</b> <b>and</b> police officers. However, the bill fell through when the reigning cabinet collapsed in March 1957.|$|E

5|$|On 6 September 2006, it was {{revealed}} {{that as a result of}} appeals brought by <b>prosecutors</b> <b>and</b> heard by the Supreme Court, Chen had the death penalty reimposed after his reduced sentence of life imprisonment was overturned. Rush, Nguyen and Norman also had their appeal verdicts overturned and the death penalty imposed. The new death sentences were unexpected. Prosecutors, in their appeals against the 20-year terms faced by most of the nine, had only called for them to be upgraded to life imprisonment. Czugaj's life sentence, after being reduced to 20 years on appeal, was reinstated. Stephens' life sentence was upheld on appeal as were Sukumaran's and Chan's death sentences. Lawrence had not lodged a further appeal to her 20-year sentence, so her sentence was not rejudged.|$|E
5|$|The Supreme People's Prosecutor (SPP), the Vietnamese {{equivalent}} to an attorney general, observes the implementation {{process of the}} Ministries, ministerial-level agencies, government organs, local authorities, social and economic organisations, the armed forces, security forces and the Vietnamese citizens in general. The SPP respects the Constitution and state laws, practices public prosecution as stated by the law and ensures law enforcement. The head of the SPP is elected, dismissed, or removed from office by a proposal of the President. The Deputy Heads, <b>prosecutors</b> <b>and</b> inspectors appointed by the SPP head can be dismissed by the President on the Head's request.|$|E
5|$|The {{screening}} of Underbelly in Victoria {{was put into}} jeopardy after last-minute legal proceedings were instituted by the Director of Public Prosecutions, Jeremy Rapke, QC. Rapke secured an urgent viewing of the series, after which he decided to seek an injunction stopping its broadcast in Victoria. A Supreme Court judge called <b>prosecutors</b> <b>and</b> defence lawyers together after serious concerns were raised about whether the show could prejudice {{the jury in the}} trial of Evangelos Goussis, who had pleaded not guilty to the 2004 gangland killing of Lewis Moran. Although Goussis was not named in the series, there were concerns the show could hurt his chance of a fair trial.|$|E

5|$|Declan McCullagh {{asserts that}} during the trial, the judge sealed the entire court file, forbade the defense from issuing subpoenas to witnesses, granted the {{prosecution}} significant latitude in making negative suggestions about Bell's character, and refused requests for a mistrial. McCullagh also asserts that he was subpoenaed by two Treasury Department agents {{to appear before the}} court, without being notified ahead of time as required by federal regulations regarding subpoenas involving the media. Following the conviction, Jim Bell renewed his attempts at firing his court-appointed lawyer, appealing his case to the Supreme Court, and filing civil lawsuits against those he alleges were involved in an orchestrated conspiracy to deny him a fair trial and an unbiased, court-appointed defense counsel; his targets included two judges, at least two <b>prosecutors,</b> <b>and</b> his former probation officers and defense attorneys.|$|E
5|$|In August 1993, police raided Jackson's home and, {{according}} to court documents, found books and photographs in his bedroom featuring young boys {{with little or no}} clothing. Since the books were legal to purchase and own, the jury decided not to indict Jackson. Jordan Chandler gave police a description of Jackson's intimate parts; a strip search revealed that Jordan had correctly claimed Jackson had patchy-colored buttocks, short pubic hair, and pink and brown marked testicles. Reportedly, Jordan had also drawn accurate pictures of a dark spot on Jackson's penis only visible when his penis was lifted. Despite differing initial internal reports from <b>prosecutors</b> <b>and</b> investigators, with reports of jurors feeling that the photos did not match the description, the DA stated his belief in a sworn affidavit that the description was accurate, along with the sheriff's photographer stating the description was accurate. A 2004 motion filed by Jackson's defense asserted that Jackson was never criminally indicted by any grand jury and that his settlement admitted no wrongdoing and contained no evidence of criminal misconduct.|$|E
5|$|On December 12, 2001, Ryder {{was arrested}} on {{shoplifting}} charges in Beverly Hills, California. She was accused of stealing $5,500 worth of designer clothes and accessories at a Saks Fifth Avenue department store. In the security offices of the store, before Ryder was arrested by the Los Angeles Police Department, she signed two civil demands that bound her {{to pay for the}} stolen and surrendered merchandise, as permitted under California's Statute for Civil Recovery for Shoplifting. Los Angeles District Attorney Stephen Cooley produced a team of eight <b>prosecutors,</b> <b>and</b> filed four felony charges against her. Ryder hired noted celebrity defense attorney Mark Geragos. Negotiations for a plea bargain failed at the end of summer 2002. As noted by Joel Mowbray from National Review, the prosecution was not ready to offer the actress an open door to a no-contest plea on misdemeanor charges.|$|E

5|$|After {{the ambush}} the two {{apparent}} shooters {{ran from the}} buildings and fled in a Ford sedan; the car was later discovered to have been set on fire and destroyed. Aiello's body was loaded into the taxicab and taken to Garfield Park Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. The coroner eventually removed 59 bullets, weighing over a pound, from the body. He was shot more times than any single victim of the St. Valentine's Day Massacre. A third machine gun position, which was ultimately not used, was later discovered by police in another nearby building, which had been rented {{a week before the}} murder by a man who gave the name Lon Celespe. Police, <b>prosecutors</b> <b>and</b> federal agents immediately and publicly speculated that Capone was behind the assassination, noting that the precision machine-gun ambush was typical of his attacks. However, at least one press story at the time speculated Moran could have been behind the hit. Prestogiacomo, fearful for his life, went into hiding for three days after Aiello's death before turning himself in to police. He was charged as an accessory before the fact of Aiello's murder, a charge also filed against John Sorce, an employee of Aiello's importing company. Detectives questioned whether Prestogiacomo provided Aiello's enemies with information about his whereabouts, something he vehemently denied. Police claimed Prestogiacomo was not cooperative and lied about his relationship with Aiello. The charges against Prestogiacomo went to a grand jury but were ultimately dropped. Frank Nitti was also wanted by police for questioning in connection with the murder.|$|E
