Average ammonia (NH 3) and odour removal efficiencies were 42 - 62 %. NH 3 outlet concentrations appeared rather constant and independent of fluctuations in inlet concentrations, so higher inlet concentrations led to higher calculated removal efficiencies.

The field study was performed for three day. One large-scale pig house with capacity of 230 pigs operate with deep litter manure system under the fully slatted floor and one small-scale pig feeding operation with capacity of 200 pigs operated by scraper and straw flow system, located at the Iksan city, South Korea, were investigated in this study.

Although {{it is well known that}} the prevalence of MRSA in pig farms is high, risk factors for the presence of MRSA in herds of <b>fattening</b> <b>pigs</b> are still poorly understood. The aim of this study was to evaluate available data from previous studies on MRSA in <b>fattening</b> <b>pigs</b> in a meta-analysis to answer the question: What are the factors associated with the occurrence of MRSA in <b>fattening</b> <b>pig</b> herds?The studies on MRSA in pigs that were identified by literature research were heterogeneous with respect to the risk factors investigated and the type of herds focused on. Therefore we decided to carry out a pooling analysis on herd level rather than a typical meta-analysis. Eligible herd data were identified based on the published literature and communication with the authors. The final data set covered 400 <b>fattening</b> <b>pig</b> herds from 10 different studies and 12 risk factors. The prevalence of MRSA in the 400 <b>fattening</b> <b>pig</b> herds was 53. 5 %. Data were analyzed using generalized estimating equations (GEE). The resulting multivariate model confirmed previously identified risk factors for MRSA in pig herds (herd size and herd type). It also identified further risk factors: group treatment of <b>fattening</b> <b>pigs</b> with antimicrobial drugs (OR= 1. 79) and <b>housing</b> <b>fattening</b> <b>pig</b> herds on at least partially slatted floors (OR= 2. 39) compared to plain floor.

40|$|Farmers make {{decisions}} in a planning {{environment in which}} planning information is frequently imperfect and outcomes uncertain. Efficient planning systems must therefore be dynamic in nature. However, available systems which are capable of being directly applied to individual farms on a whole farm basis {{do not reflect the}} true nature of the planning environment. This study explores the nature of these problems through developing a dynamic planning system for <b>pig</b> <b>fattening.</b> The study considers the nature of the <b>pig</b> <b>fattening</b> problem and specifies the important factors that planning models must allow for representing the realistic planning environment. The features of currently available models are reviewed leading to a statement of the improvements required. A realistic model of <b>pig</b> <b>fattening</b> is developed and possible solution algorithms are considered. As the models require detailed pig growth information a simulation model designed to predict response from alternative feeding patterns was developed. The output from this model together with the output from a model which calculates growth distributions and posterior probabilities on potential growth provide some of the input data for a stochastic multi-period linear programming model of the problem. The remainder, feed cost information, is obtained from least cost models formulated to represent the features of the dynamic planning problem. With imperfect information, planning involves continual re-planning as new observations are made. Consequently only the solution to the first period of the model is likely to be implemented. To ensure that the first period decision set is optimal it is shown that a minimum number of periods must be included in the planning model. The minimum number is referred to as the planning horizon. Methods of determining a planning horizon are reviewed and it is concluded that available methods do not provide a general method for all planning situations. A method is developed for the <b>pig</b> <b>fattening</b> problem. Finally, a number of planning experiments were carried out to demonstrate the value of the planning models and systems developed. The results indicate the potential value of applying sophisticated planning methods to individual farms and provide a means to examine the condition under which detailed individual farm dynamic planning can be worthwhile...|$|R

The manure on the floor was determined with floor contamination that was {{the proportion of the}} floor surface covered by a mixture of urine and faeces. Ammonia emission from an exhaust chimney was continuously measured for 135 days with a NOx analyser and a full-size ventilation rate sensor. Measurement data were processed and 900 steady-state data subsets were extracted. The steady-state data were used to investigate the effect of manure on the NH, emission. There was no good relationship established between the NH 3 emission rate and the manure depth (correlation coefficient r = - 0. 143). However, the NH 3 emission rate had a high correlation coefficient (r = 0. 852) with the floor contamination. A linear equation was built for the relationship between the NH 3 emission and the floor contamination. it was further found that the floor contamination itself was influenced by the weight of pigs and the inside room temperature. A model was developed to calculate the floor contamination {{as a function of the}} weight of pigs and the inside temperature (R- 2 = 0. 811). With higher floor contamination values in the house, the ventilation rate and the inside room temperature had stronger influence on the NH 3 emission rate. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B. V.

40|$|Development {{programs}} recommend <b>fattening</b> of <b>pigs</b> aged between 1 and 2 {{years by}} supplementing their local diet with industrial cereal bran, to improve womens' income. At the best moment {{to start this}} activity, just after the rainy season, high demand for these pigs induced higher prices and low margins. The start after the rainy season does not fit in the existing production system as farmers sell their surplus pigs {{before and during the}} rainy season. Traditional <b>pig</b> <b>fattening</b> lasts 3 years. About 60 women in 8 villages tested early fattening of young piglets. Piglets of the treatment were supplemented with a special concentrate and showed higher daily weight gains compared to the traditionally fed group. The gross margin of the early fattening was equal to the recommended <b>pig</b> <b>fattening,</b> but the first solved problems related to availability of piglets and thus fits better in the existing production system. Almost half of the early <b>fattened</b> <b>pigs</b> were sold within a year. Most of the women appreciated the experiment positively and suggested positive margins can be attained by selecting suitable piglets and rigorously respecting feeding and management schemes. Criteria were developed for selecting the most suitable piglets with a simple tailor tape. A projection on 3 years shows that the gross margin of early fattening is higher compared to traditional fattening and that it facilitates the production of more meat against lower cost...|$|R
40|$|The study {{monitored}} {{the effect of}} the housing system and the number of animals transported together on transport-induced mortality of slaughter pigs in the Czech Republic in the period from 2004 to 2008. Concerning the type of <b>housing</b> during the <b>fattening,</b> the lowest mortality rate during the subsequent transport to slaughter houses was detected among <b>pigs</b> <b>fattened</b> on solid floor (0. 047 %) and on deep bedding (0. 084 %). The highest mortality during transport was detected among <b>pigs</b> <b>fattened</b> on fully or partially slatted floor (0. 139 %), a significant difference (p < 0. 01) was found compared to other housing types. Assessment of the influence of individual pig load size on mortality showed the lowest mortality among pigs transported in loads of up to 40 animals (0. 053 %). Mortality during the transport in loads of the size of 41 to 120 animals was 0. 130 %, and for loads of the size over 120 pigs the mortality rate was 0. 156 %. These mortality rates are significantly higher (p < 0. 01) compared to the load sizes of up to 40 animals. <b>Fattening</b> <b>pig,</b> transportation, slatted floor, solid floor, deep bedding, welfare The number of transport-induced deaths of animals {{on the way to the}} slaughter house indicates how animal welfare is secured during transport, but may be also influenced b...|$|R
40|$|The {{excretion}} of campylobacter {{by eight}} individually <b>housed</b> <b>fattening</b> <b>pigs</b> was monitored during 15 weeks. Rectal faeces {{samples were collected}} six times from these pigs and twice from their mothers (seven sows). Campylobacter was cultured from these samples on Preston medium. In some pigs, samples positive for campylobacter alternated with negative samples. Campylobacter was detected in at least {{four of the six}} samples collected per <b>fattening</b> <b>pig.</b> The average campylobacter count per sampling showed a decreasing trend (P < 0. 001). Of the seven sows, six were shown to excrete campylobacter. Campylobacter isolates of pigs and sows were typed using the Enterobacterial Repetitive Intergenic Consensus Polymerase Chain Reaction (ERIC-PCR); 28 different campylobacter types were distinguished. Up to five different types were isolated from single faeces samples. Individual porkers could harbour up to eight types during their fattening period. The three types most frequently isolated from the <b>fattening</b> <b>pigs</b> were also present in the sows...|$|R

40|$|Measurements {{of indoor}} {{concentrations}} and emissions at different <b>pig</b> <b>fattening</b> facilities {{took place in}} order to evaluate the indoor air quality and emissions. Particulate matter (PM), more specifically PM 10, PM 2. 5 and PM 1, was measured simultaneously with ammonia and greenhouse gases (CH 4, N 2 O, CO 2). Based on these findings, an estimation {{was made of the}} total emissions for both <b>fattening</b> <b>pigs</b> and the total pig industry in Flanders. Furthermore, personal PM measurements were performed in order to assess the occupational exposure of the farmer and the veterinarian.

40|$|The {{additive}} AveMix® XG 10 is {{an enzyme}} preparation of endo- 1, 4 -beta-xylanase (xylanase) and endo- 1, 3 (4) -beta-glucanase (glucanase), produced by two strains of Trichoderma reesei. This product is currently authorised {{for use in}} chickens for fattening, laying hens, minor poultry species and weaned piglets as a zootechnical additive, under the functional group of digestibility enhancers. The applicant is now seeking {{an extension of the}} authorisation to <b>pigs</b> for <b>fattening</b> and minor porcine species at a recommended dose of 4 000 XU (xylanase units) and 900 BGU (beta-glucanase units) per kg complete feed. The FEEDAP Panel considers that, since the additive has been demonstrated to be safe for piglets at the recommended dose, this conclusion can be extended to <b>pigs</b> for <b>fattening</b> and extrapolated to minor growing porcine species. Supplementation of diets for <b>pigs</b> for <b>fattening</b> with Avemix® XG 10 at the recommended dose (4 000 XU and 900 BGU/kg) resulted in a significantly higher body weight and daily weight gain in one trial and significantly improved feed to gain ratio in two trials. Therefore, the FEEDAP Panel concludes that AveMix® XG 10 {{has the potential to be}} efficacious in <b>pigs</b> for <b>fattening</b> at this dose. Since the mode of action of xylanases and glucanases can reasonably be assumed to be the same in all porcine species, the conclusions on efficacy for weaned piglets and <b>pigs</b> for <b>fattening</b> can be extrapolated to include all minor porcine species for growing at 4 000 XU and 900 BGU/kg complete feed...|$|R
