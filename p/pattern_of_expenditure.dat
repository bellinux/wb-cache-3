The height of the chapel wall was increased, and many of the windows were altered. The college received advice from the architect John Nash about this work; he requested that, instead of paying him, the college should commission a portrait of him from Sir Thomas Lawrence to hang in the hall. Lawrence depicted Nash in his house in Regent Street, London; the portrait has been described by Lawrence's biographer, the art historian Sir Michael Levey, as [...] "pungently vivid".|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background During Ramadan fast, {{approximately}} one billion Muslims abstain from food and fluid between {{the hours of}} sunrise to sunset, and usually eat a large meal after sunset and another meal before sunrise. Many studies reported good health-related outcomes of fasting including weight loss. The objective {{of this study is}} to identify the local <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>expenditure</b> on food consumption, dietary habits during Ramadan and correlate that to self-reported weight gain after Ramadan in a group of families in Jeddah, Western Saudi Arabia. Methods A Cross-section study using a pre-designed questionnaire to identify the local <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>expenditure</b> on food consumption, dietary habits during Ramadan and correlate that to self-reported weight gain after Ramadan in a representative cohort of Saudis living in Jeddah. It was piloted on 173 nutrition students and administered by them to their families. Results A total of 173 Saudi families were interviewed. One out of 5 indicated that their expenditure increases during Ramadan. Approximately two thirds of the respondents (59. 5 %) reported weight gain after Ramadan. When asked about their perspective explanations for that: 40 % attributed that to types of foods being rich in fat and carbohydrates particularly date in (Sunset meal) 97. 7 % and rice in (Dawn meal) 80. 9 %. One third (31. 2 %) indicated that it was due to relative lack of physical exercise in Ramadan and 14. 5 % referred that to increase in food consumption. Two thirds (65. 2 %) of those with increased expenditure reported weight gain. Conclusion Surprisingly weight gain and not weight loss was reported after Ramadan by Saudis which indicates timely needed life-style and dietary modification programs for a population which reports one of the highest prevalence rates of diabetes. </p...|$|E

40|$|The Stability and Growth Pact and {{the process}} of fiscal {{consolidation}} in several European countries have enhanced the role of fiscal rules at sub-national level. This paper analyzes the combined effect of a rule to allocate capital and current block grants to local governments and the "golden rule" of public finance (surplus of current balance). We argue that the two fiscal rules introduce significant rigidities and distortions in local governments' expenditures structure since these mimic the structure of revenues. This effect is particularly relevant in municipalities that are more dependent of intergovernmental grants, mainly rural. On the other hand, urban municipalities with greater tax revenues (current revenues) are constrained in their ability to make capital investments because they receive per capita capital grants below what economies of scale would suggest. An empirical analysis of Portuguese local governments shows that it is no longer the median voter, but fiscal rules, that command the broad <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>expenditure</b> (current versus capital) at a local level.

40|$|The {{financial}} {{condition of the}} state governments in India has been {{a cause for concern}} for sometime now. Over the years, the consolidated financial position of the state governments has shown a marked deterioration in some of their major deficit indicators. One of the fundamental weaknesses of state government finances in India {{can be attributed to the}} increases in non-developmental expenditure, particularly the revenue component of the non-developmental expenditure, and interest payments as a proportion of revenue receipts. Structural imbalances in the form of large revenue deficits, rising interest burden, increasing distortions in the <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>expenditure,</b> and very slow growing non-tax revenues are major problem areas for state finances. These problems have been aggravated a great deal over the past few years because of a variety of reasons. The resource constraints in state finances have been accentuated by a near stagnant tax-GDP ratio, rising share of non-developmental outlay in the total expenditure, large volumes of hidden or implicit subsidies and increasing financial losses of state enterprises. A growing pressure on state finances has also stemmed from the rising demand for public services. Furthermore, the fiscal situation in the states is likely to come under much greater pressure with the acceptance of the Report of the Fifth Pay Commission by several state governments in India. Be that as it may, the critical problem in state finances is not only one of high levels of expenditure, but also one of increasing distortions in the <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>expenditure.</b> The three different methods of intergovernmental fiscal transfers have resulted in an inefficient transfer mechanism that has increased bureaucracy at the state level, accommodated numerous interest groups, and delinked plan requirements of states from actual transfers. Similarly, better fiscal performance is not acknowledged with higher transfers, instead the gap filling approach of the Finance Commission discourages fiscal discipline in the states. In the area of expenditure reduction, we have identified several potential areas for controlling expenditure of the state governments. In our view, by raising user charges on water in accordance with the costs incurred in providing water, and aligning tariff rates of the SEBs in line with their costs, the state governments could significantly cut their budgetary losses. In addition, a freeze on state government employment can help save scarce resources to be used for productive purposes elsewhere in the states...|$|E
40|$|Using an intertemporal, two-country general {{equilibrium}} model, I {{demonstrate that}} international asymmetries in expenditure patterns determine the real exchange rate effects of capital controls. Capital import taxes lower world interest rates but raise home interest rates. These changes {{in interest rates}} bring about {{a change in the}} composition of world expenditure, with a shift of home expenditure from the present ("today") to the future ("tomorrow") and a shift of foreign aggregate expenditure from tomorrow to today. If the <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>expenditure</b> across commodities is the same at home and abroad, the change in the composition of world expenditure has no effects on the (excess) demand for any particular commodity. Therefore, with identical expenditure patterns at home and abroad, the imposition of capital controls has no effect on the real exchange rate. However, when consumers have a preference for domestically produced goods, the shift in composition of world expenditure caused by interest rate changes implies a decline in demand today for home goods. In that case, capital controls lower the real exchange rate. Of course in period two the reverse happens. This result is mitigated when the country imposing capital controls is a large debtor.

Using the context of the collective model we provide interpretation of these results from the perspective of individual parental gender preferences. We also examine the potential effects of sample selection bias which may affect the results and may be important for other findings in the literature. Labor supply of mothers and overall child-related consumption is not affected by gender of the first child, but the <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>expenditure</b> significantly varies between those with first born sons and first born daughters.

These guidelines signal a commendable shift away from viewing the provision of WASH services as primarily an engineering challenge to one that requires activities that include source protection, institution building and long-term support, and pro-poor planning, all of which need to be budgeted for by WASH service providers and/or users. Preliminary findings indicate that LCCA can be used to assess the actual life- cycle costs of sustainable, equitable and efficient WASH services delivery.

30|$|There {{is now a}} large {{academic}} literature on China’s internal labor migration, and a significant discussion within that literature concerns the remittances sent home by migrant workers. My fieldwork indicates that {{a significant portion of}} the money remitted by rural migrant workers is spent on face-oriented etiquette. Ling’s husband became a migrant worker in Shenzhen, a major destination of rural workers, in 2003. At that time, he earned approximately CNY 600 per month and remitted CNY 500 per month to his wife and children in the village, leaving very little money for himself. When asked how the money was spent, Ling said, “zaijia you shenme chijiu yao songyi a!”, meaning “It is a custom to attend banquets and give gifts in the village”. Ling reported to me that over 80 % of her husband’s remittance was spent on village banquets and gifts and that the remainder was put aside for the educational needs of their two sons. This <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>expenditure</b> required Ling to often borrow money to satisfy daily needs. Another respondent, Pei, similarly remarked that it was not unusual for her family to not be able to afford meat, but at the same time it was unthinkable to avoid gift-giving in the village and returning renqing.
