Having was very popular dye {{and was used}} especially in textile industries and leather industries of fur. The aim {{of the study was}} to the optimum concentration of indigo <b>pigmen</b> on dyeing of suede leather. The materials used in study were crust suede leather, indigo <b>pigmen,</b> wetting agent, soda ash, ammonia, formic acid sulfonated oil, and redactors such as palm sugar. The dying of leather using indigo <b>pigmen</b> was principally similar with common dyeing and pH of indigo is 11. 5, however pH on several steps must adjusted. Variation of the concentration of in dyeing was 0. 5, 1, and 1. 5 % respectively.

Previous studies suggest that melanophores regulate the direction of pigment movements via changes in intracellular cAMP (Rozdzial and Haimo, 1986 a; Sammak et al., 1992), whereas erythrophores may use calcium- (Ca 2 ÷-) based regulation (Luby-Phelps and Porter, 1982; McNiven and Ward, 1988). Despite these observations, {{there have been no}} direct measurements in intact erythrophores or any cell type correlating changes of intracellular free Ca 2 + ([Ca 2 +]i) with organelle movements.
