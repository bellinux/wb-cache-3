The feasibility of growing several 12 cm diameter crystals sequentially at 12 cm/h during a furnace run and the subsequent slicing of the ingot using a multiblade slurry saw were investigated. The goal of the wafering process was a slice thickness of 0. 25 mm with minimal kerf. A slice + kerf of 0. 56 mm was achieved on 12 cm crystal using both 400 grit B 4 C and SiC abrasive slurries. Crystal growth experiments were performed at 12 cm diameter in a commercially available puller with both 10 and 12 kg melts. Several modifications to the <b>puller</b> hoz <b>zone</b> were required to achieve stable crystal growth over the entire crystal length and to prevent crystallinity loss a few centimeters down the crystal. The maximum practical growth rate for 12 cm crystal in this puller design was 10 cm/h, with 12 to 14 cm/h being the absolute maximum range at which melt freeze occurred...|$|R

40|$|By {{randomly}} mapping {{items and}} nodes {{to a common}} address space, most P 2 P index structures based on DHTs provide only exact match data lookups. This compromises their use in data-oriented applications where more advanced query facilities, such as range queries, are needed. We have previously proposed a P 2 P index structure that refines the Chord DHT by mapping data items to the Chord address space in an order-preserving way. Load balancing of skewed data is then achieved deterministically by <b>pulling</b> nodes to <b>zones</b> where too many data items reside. However, based on Chord's underlying routing infrastructure, our previous solution can no longer ensure logarithmic routing cost when the node distribution over the address space becomes highly skewed. In this paper, we push our previous study one step further and propose a simple yet efficient refinement to Chord's routing component. By offering nodes more flexibility {{in the choice of}} their neighbors, our solution ensures logarithmic routing cost, with high probability. Most importantly, our solution is dynamic {{in the sense that it}} adapts to any node distribution, including highly adversarial ones...|$|R

The exact thrust that the propeller will produce and the thrust that will be lost toe to the viscous forces is, nowadays, known only when the vessel is already built and the test of thrust of the boats, called bollard pull test, is performed. Thanks to the informatics development, the computational fluid dynamics is bringing betler results every day. The importance of numerical simulations in various fields of application is by now widely accepted. There are in particular relevant cases where experiments are too costly, too dangerous or even impossible when the process to be simulated is not even observable in experiments. Therefore computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations it is an economic and reliable way to determinate the boat capacities before its co nstructio n.

A measurement-based algorithm to estimate the throughput is also proposed. We then discuss the maximum achievable amount of information that can be relayed forward along a vehicular stream. A network coding technique will then be proposed to cancel the interference caused by relay signals to vehicles that are receiving messages from the corresponding information center. These theoretical results will give more insight into the vehicular communication system design. © 2011 IEEE...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAttempts {{to explore}} the {{dynamics}} of convergent boundaries are essentially based on the confrontation of the observed kinematics to the intrinsic dynamic properties of subduction zones. Which often mismatch. On {{the basis of the}} mantle flow model of Conrad and Behn (2010), I explore the role of the often neglected basal drag that the flowing mantle exerts underneath each plate. After computing the total torque underneath each plate, I find that (i) the net torque due to basal drag systematically drives plates away from their ridges and towards subduction zones, conformably to the plate circuit; (ii) compressive zones are found where the net drag forces from upper and lower plates are converging, and diverging for extensive zones; (iii) trench migration is dictated by the difference between the upper plate drag force and lower plate drag force. In other words, trenches advance where upper plates <b>pulls</b> the subduction <b>zones</b> and the lower plate pushes it. These results indicate that differences in the dynamics of plate boundaries arise from the global mantle circulation more than the from the local properties of subduction zones. The often neglected drag force thus appears crucial to reconcile the kinematics and dynamics of subduction zones...|$|R

The Iberian plate was formed during the Cadomian Orogeny of the late Neoproterozoic (about 650-550 Ma), from {{the margins of the}} Gondwana continent. Through collisions and accretion a group of island arcs (that included the Central Iberian Plate, Ossa-Morena Plate, South Portuguese Plate) began to disintegrate from Gondwana (along with other European fragments). These plates never separated substantially from each other since this period [...] By the Mesozoic, the three [...] "Portuguese plates" [...] were a part of the Northern France Armoric Plate until the Bay of Biscay began to separate. Following the separation of the Iberian Abyssal Plain, Iberia and Europe began to drift progressively from North America, as the Mid-Atlantic fracture <b>zone</b> <b>pulled</b> the three plates away from the larger continent. Eventually, Iberia collided with southern France attaching the region into a peninsula of Europe (during the Cenozoic).

40|$|Plate tectonic motions are {{commonly}} {{considered to be}} driven by slab <b>pull</b> at subduction <b>zones</b> and ridge push at mid-ocean ridges, with motion punctuated by plumes of hot material rising from the lower mantle¹,². Within this model, the geometry and location of mid-ocean ridges are considered to be independent of lower-mantle dynamics, such as deeply sourced plumes that produce voluminous lava eruptions−termed large igneous provinces². Here we use a global plate model³ to reconstruct the locations of large igneous provinces relative to plumes and mid-ocean ridges at the time they formed. We find that large igneous provinces repeatedly formed at specific locations where mid-ocean ridges and plumes interact. We calculate how much mantle material was converted to oceanic lithosphere at the mid-ocean ridges and find that slowly migrating ridge systems that have been stabilized by upwelling plumes have extracted large volumes of material from the same part of the upper mantle over periods up to 180 million years. The geochemical signatures of mid-ocean ridge basalts and seismic tomographic data show that upper-mantle temperatures are elevated at significant distances from ridge-plume interactions, indicating a far-field, indirect influence of plume-ridge interactions on the upper-mantle structure. We conclude that strong feedbacks exist between the dynamics of slowly migrating ridges and deeply sourced plumes. 5 page(s...|$|R

This Riverfront development {{will be even more}} important when it becomes a vital example of how a riverfront can stretch and pull together downtown Tampa and its surrounding areas: Hyde Park, Harbour Island, and Historic Ybor. The purpose of this master 2 ̆ 7 s project is to explore an ecological ex pansion design approach for the Tampa River Walk as a master plan and then zooming into to an area to design in detail of what the riverfront can be. It will start by concentrating on the areas that were not dealt with in the proposal by EDAW: the west side of Hillsborough River, and areas that are immediately adjacent. Furthermore, it will investigate future expansion of the River Walk as downtown Tampa potentially expands and connects out to the suburbs in thirty to forty years. The main focus of this project will be to create an iconic design that gives the Tampa 2 ̆ 7 s riverfront a character and identity. This unique characteristic will be created by knitting nature into the urban fabric and using the River Walk as a natural seam. The connection throughout the riverfront will be made by a natural green strip. It will explore the idea of stretching and <b>pulling</b> of public <b>zones</b> vertically and horizontally to create connectivity and identity with the River Walk. Two resarch methods that will play important roles in this investigation are Design and History Research, and Case Study and Multi-method Approaches to Research. The research timeline will concentrate on mainly the history of development and use of Tampa 2 ̆ 7 s riverfront starting from 16002 ̆ 7 s when Tampa Bay was discovered by Spanish explorers, through the River Walk development proposed today. Also, case studies of Chicago Water Front, San Antonio River Walk, and others will inform various strategies taken in different geographical locations and impacts they 2 ̆ 7 ve had on the growth of the cities. This project will provide an expansion design approach that is not only a concern for the present time, but also looking ahead at what it might provide for the future. The result of this project will hopefully serve as a stepping stone for a new way of revitalizing Tampa 2 ̆ 7 s downtown and surrounding areas through knitting of nature into an urban fabric...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{multistage}} mechanism of the Earth's crust enrichment in ore elements in underthrust zones. The processes of metamorphism {{and the formation of}} hydrothermal solutions at pulling of the watered oceanic lithospheric plate into the subduction zone have been described. Some physical and chemical transformation regularities of structural-material complexes in these areas and mechanisms of the formation of ore deposits have been discussed. Spatio-temporal patterns of the localization of a number of endogenetic and exogenetic deposits have been described using metallogeny of the Ural and the Verkhoyansk-Kolyma Fold Belts as an example. It has been shown that in nature there are several effective mechanisms of the enrichment of the crust in ore minerals. One of them is the process of <b>pulling</b> into subduction <b>zone</b> of metalliferous sediments and ferromanganese crusts as well as seabed nodules, their metamorphic transformation, partial melting and transition of ore components into magmatic melts and mineralized fluids. In the future this leads to the release of ore material by magmas and hydrothermal solutions into the folded formations of island-arc and Andean types and the formation of igneous, metasomatic and hydrothermal deposits. Another, yet no less powerful natural mechanism of a conveyor enrichment of the crust in ore elements is the process of destruction and sedimentation of mineral deposits formed in the folded areas as well as the formation of placers and their transfer to the marginal parts of the continent. Later, during the collision of active and passive margins of two lithospheric plates, such as the collision of the Kolyma Massif with {{the eastern part of the}} Siberian craton in the middle of the Mesozoic there was a thrusting of a younger lithospheric plate over a more ancient one. As a result, the sedimentary sequences of the passive margin of the Siberian plate were submerged and partially melted by the basic magmas intruded in the bottom of the cut. This led to the transition of a part of ore elements from placers to igneous rocks of granitoid composition and fluid solutions, thereby forming magmatic, metasomatic and hydrothermal mineral deposits. Cyclic enrichment of the Earth's crust in this way can repeatedly manifest itself in the history of the Earth and lead to the enrichment of ore deposits from the ancient complexes to the young ones. Studying processes of geodynamic evolution of the structural-material complexes of continental and oceanic lithosphere is important to understand the processes of ore genesis in the Earth's crust. Most endogenetic deposits are closely connected with the processes of metamorphism, magmatism and hydrothermal activity and are usually formed at the margins of lithospheric plates. A part of exogenetic deposits is also genetically connected with endogenetic and is formed due to their destruction. The regularities of ore genesis in underthrust zones described in the paper cover only a part of the natural processes of the Earth's crust enrichment in ore minerals. The paper has also focused on polycyclic and conveying mechanisms of the formation and transformation of ore elements in subduction zones, as well as on the mechanism of remobilization of orebearing deposits and their joint transfer to the upper structural layers of the folded system and the formation of ore-bearing volcano-plutonic associations...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Two main {{principal}} aspects for {{the genesis}} of porphyry copper deposits have been determined. The first genetic model concerns the petrologic and geochemical processes and the other relates the genesis to crustal deformation and geodynamic conditions (Kesler, 1997). Recent studies (e. g., Padilla Garza et al., 2001) show that the generation and emplacement of porphyry copper deposits may not only be dependent on magmatic and hydrothermal processes, but also that the regional and local tectonic setting plays an important role. Therefore in determining the suitable setting for emplacement of copper and other porphyry intrusions, determination of location of partial melting of the lower crust, generation of batholiths, and their volatile-rich derivative intrusions in the crust seems to be necessary (Carranza and Hale, 2002). Almost all porphyry copper deposits in Iran {{are located in the}} Urumieh-Dokhtar magmatic belt. These deposits show distinct spatial and temporal relationship with Miocene granodiorite plutonic rocks emplaced along strike slip faults (Mehrabi et al., 2005). Accordingly, the tectonic setting of ore deposits seem {{to be the most important}} factor for regional exploration of porphyry copper systems (Vearncombe and Vearncombe, 1999). There are several methods for analysis of distribution of ore deposits. In this research the role of structural control in the spatial distribution of porphyry deposits has been studied using Fry and Fractal methods. Here, the Fry method is used as a complementary method for Fractal analysis. Materials and methods Fry analysis is a self-adaptive method that is used for point objects. Fry analysis offers a visual approach to quantify the spatial trends in groups of point objects. Fry analysis can also be used to search for anisotropies in the distribution of point objects. More specifically it can be used to investigate whether a distribution of point objects occurs along linear trends, and whether such linear trends occur at a characteristic spacing. There is 37 and 42 copper point's index in the Khezr-Abad and Shar-B-Babak areas. The Fry patterns of copper index for two areas were determined with application of Dot Proc software. Fractal analysis is another technique for determination of regional distribution of faults. In this research the fractal dimension of joints and faults was determined in different locations using box-counting fractal method and drawing the logarithmic graphs. Results - The major faults show NW/SE trends in the Khezr-Abad area. They have a similar trend with Dehshir-Baft fault. Other sets of faults show NE/SW trend. These faults are younger than the Dehshir-Baft and release sinistral sense of shear. - Intrusion of two intrusive bodies leads to the accumulation of strike-slip faults in the vicinity of intrusive rocks. In this region faults and joints mainly show NW/SE and NE/SW trends. - The results of Fry analysis show that the mineralization in the Khezr-Abad occurred in the Cretaceous (and younger) rocks with NE/SW and NW/SE orientations. In the other words, these areas of mineralization are mainly related to the secondary faults or (P faults) in the pull basins and cross cutting points of these faults which have similar strike with the Dehshir-Baft fault. NE/SW mineralization is probably related to the tensional stress direction or faults having the general trends of central Iran structures. - The calculations of fractal dimension show that the southeastern parts of the Khezr Abad have higher amounts of fractal dimension (Db= 1. 7002). Also there is a relatively higher copper index in this part, indicating a logical relation between fault structures and mineralization. -The generated maps indicate that the mineralization in the Shahr-e-Babak area occurred at the intersection of faults and volcanic system and the Fry analysis shows a NE/SW and NW/SE trend of ore concentration. - Northwestern parts of the Share-e-Babak show higher fractal dimension (Db= 1. 748) that occurs in the areas with more volcanic rocks and copper indexes. - Results show that the porphyry copper mineralization mainly occurs near the great faults and related to the fault structures and shear zones in the Urumieh-Dokhtar structural zone. In the other word fault lineaments are the main factors in the local concentration of the ore deposits. Discussion The Study of geometry and mechanism of faults related to porphyry copper deposits is very important for determining the suitable location of ore concentration (Zarasvandi, 2004). For example, shear <b>zones,</b> <b>pull</b> apart basins, and step over along the strike slip faults are proper locations for concentration of porphyry ore deposits (Carranza and Hale, 2002). In this research the Khezr-Abad and Shahr-e-Babak areas have been studied. Plotted rose diagrams show the main role of the Dehshir-Baft shear zone for generating the joints and faults in the KhezrAbad area. In this area faults with NNW/SSE and NW/SE trends are the main direction of ore concentration. They are mainly related to the Dehshir-Baft fault. NE/SW faults show sinistral sense of shear and generally are younger than before mentioned sets. Finally the latest fault sets show N/S trend. The Shahre-e-Babak area is mainly dominated with Eocene igneous rocks. Volumetrically, andesite units are more abundant. Rose diagrams represent the existence of two main conjugate fault sets with NW/SE and NE/SW trends. The main copper indexes are located in the intersection of volcanic rocks with these two fault sets. Also the results of Fractal analyses reveal the higher Fractal dimension in the Northwestern part of the Shahr-e-Babak area. In the other words the most density of joint and faults occurred in this region. References: Carranza, J. M. and Hale, M., 2002. where are porphyry copper deposits spatially localized?
