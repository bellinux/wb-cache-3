40|$|The {{design of}} a failure {{detection}} and identification system consists of designing a robust residual generation process and a high <b>performance</b> <b>decision</b> making process.

The OIDSA is composed of a natural language processing agent, a fuzzy inference agent, and a <b>performance</b> <b>decision</b> support agent. All the needed information of the OIDSA, including the CMMI ontology and the project personal ontology, is stored in an ontology repository. In addition, the natural language processing agent, based on the Chinese Dictionary, periodically collects the information of the project progress from project members to analyze {{the features of the}} Chinese terms for semantic concept clustering. Next, the fuzzy inference agent computes the similarity of the planned progress report and actual progress report, based on the CMMI ontology, the project personal ontology, and natural language processing results. Finally, the <b>performance</b> <b>decision</b> support agent measures the completed percentage of the progress for each project member.

Understanding optimal decision-making {{will allow the}} military to more effectively train its leaders. The Cognitive Alignment with Performance Targeted Training Intervention Model (CAPTTIM) was developed to aid the training of optimal decision making. CAPTTIM determines when <b>decision</b> <b>performance</b> (categorized as near-optimal or suboptimal) is aligned or misaligned with cognitive state (categorized as exploration or exploitation) : when someone thinks they have figured out the task (exploitation cognitive state), is their <b>decision</b> <b>performance</b> actually near optimal? Prior research categorized subjects’ cognitive states as exploration or exploitation, but the delineation of <b>decision</b> <b>performance</b> had yet been done. The primary focus of this thesis was to use pre-collected and de-identified data to (1) determine and validate a threshold that delineated near-optimal and suboptimal <b>decision</b> <b>performance</b> with the metric, regret, and (2) categorize the combination of cognitive state and <b>decision</b> <b>performance</b> into CAPTTIM on a trial-by-trial basis. A change point analysis of regret provided an effective threshold delineation of <b>decision</b> <b>performance</b> across all subjects. Visualization techniques were employed to categorize decision and cognitive state data into CAPTTIM on a trial-by-trial basis. Thus, CAPTTIM was validated {{as a means of}} understanding decision-making. Captain, United States Marine Corp...|$|R

To better understand what potential cues and feedback help to guide the operators, a questionnaire was developed to learn what factors affect decisions. Operator responses address issues related to specific tasks, equipment operation, visibility, lighting, and communication issues.
