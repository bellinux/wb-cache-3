40|$|I {{describe}} {{the challenge of}} fully integrating securities markets in Europe by integrating the clearing and settlement functionalities. The initial condition {{is characterized by a}} multitude of standards, conventions, regulation and laws, which are inconsistent with a barrier-free post-trading environment. In addition, the current providers of <b>post-trading</b> <b>services</b> are mostly for-profit monopolies. The EU reform strategy is discussed in detail, and its performance so far is assessed. I argue that the special features of the post-trading industry may help understand the disappointing progress so far. ...|$|R

40|$|The execution, clearing, and {{settlement}} of financial transactions are all subject to substantial scale and scope economies which make {{each of these}} complementary functions a natural monopoly. Integration of trade, execution, {{and settlement}} in an exchange improves efficiency by economizing on transactions costs. When scope economies in clearing are more extensive than those in execution, integration is more costly, and efficient organization involves a trade-off of scope economies and transactions costs. A properly organized clearing cooperative can eliminate double marginalization problems and exploit scope economies, but can result in opportunism and underinvestment. Moreover, a clearing cooperative may exercise market power. Vertical integration and tying can foreclose entry, but foreclosure can be efficient because market power rents attract excessive entry. Integration of trading and <b>post-trade</b> <b>services</b> is the modal form of organization in financial markets, {{which is consistent with}} the hypothesis that transactional efficiencies explain organizational arrangements in these markets...|$|R

40|$|As major {{stakeholders}} in stock exchanges, issuers are closely watching where recent developments will lead to. A Pan-European stock exchange could {{be beneficial to}} all its users, provided that their concerns be addressed. The exchange’s quasi public service function must be preserved {{in the interest of}} issuers, investors and intermediaries alike. Competitive pricing is, among others, an issue. So is liquidity, especially for mid and small caps. More transparency should reign in operations and transactions. The same goes for indices setting, where issuers should get a say. A consolidated stock exchange would be in want of a clear European regulatory and supervisory framework, especially for <b>post-trading</b> <b>services,</b> so as not to endanger the stability and successful integration of financial markets. Issuers should be actively involved in the process. JEL classification : F 36, G 15, G 18, G 28 Joly Alain. The future of stock exchanges: how issuers look at it?.

40|$|Working paper du GATE 2011 - 29 The European Central Bank (ECB) {{will offer}} to banks in 2013 an {{european}} shared platform for securities settlement, named TARGET 2 Securities (T 2 S), {{in order to}} open the national financial markets. The financial crisis did not change the ECB agenda. This paper develops a spatial competition model to understand {{the impact of this}} new organisation on european <b>post-trading</b> <b>services.</b> We analyse the incentives of the Central Securities Depositaries (CSD) to move to T 2 S when they become competitors in the market for settlement services and remain in a monopoly position for depository services. Settlement and depository services are complementary goods, because banks have to pay for these two services to buy or sell a security. We show that such a reform should induce a decrease in the settlement price and more generally in post-trading prices, but that prices depend strongly on market organisation. Under certain conditions, partial adhesion would make prices increase. This configuration appears as a Nash equilibrium. As CSDs are free to adhere to T 2 S, the ECB might be forced to regulate...|$|R
40|$|The Market in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) aims to {{increase}} com-petition and to foster client {{protection in the}} European 8 ̆ 5 nancial market. Among other provisions, it abolishes the concentration rule and challenges the market power of existing trading venues. The directive introduces venue competition {{in order to achieve}} better execution and ultimately lower trading costs. In this paper I address the question of whether fostering competition between alternative trading venues alone may or not be able to impact actual competition in the market. I consider two reasons for why it may not: cash trading exhibits direct network e¤ects and the typical trading and post-trading bundling in the EU. I then propose an empiri-cal framework to evaluate the actual degree of competition between trading venues. This empirical approach constitutes, for the best of my knowledge, one of the 8 ̆ 5 rst attempts to structurally model 8 ̆ 5 nancial trading, which is instrumental for mea-suring empirically the impact of network e¤ects and of the bundle of trading and <b>post-trading</b> <b>services</b> as barriers to competition. This evaluation is provided in the companion paper, Ribeiro (2008) ...|$|R
50|$|One of the {{objectives}} of T2S {{is to reduce the}} cost of securities settlement in Europe, in particular for transactions across EU countries, which can be ten times more expensive than domestic transactions. In addition, banks will be able to optimise their collateral (finance) and liquidity management. The T2S settlement platform is also a step towards a single market for financial services. The T2S project will be a catalyst for further harmonisation of post-trade practices and regulations across Europe. Significant progress has already been made by the T2S governance bodies, composed of industry experts, on harmonisation of instructions management and settlement processes, {{as well as on the}} processing of corporate actions on unsettled transactions. As a result of reduced settlement costs, increased competition and greater harmonisation, T2S is expected to have a positive impact on European economic growth. The lower costs of settlement, and potentially the costs for other <b>post-trade</b> <b>services,</b> are expected to be passed on to investors. Furthermore, by making it easier and less costly to access securities in other EU countries, investors could benefit from more diversified bond and equity portfolios. In addition, issuers will gain access to a more diversified investor base.|$|R
5000|$|Despite the {{introduction}} of the euro more than ten years ago, the provision of <b>post-trading</b> <b>services</b> (i.e. clearing and settlement) remained heavily fragmented along national lines. For example, there were still 19 CSDs operating in the euro area in 2009 and almost 40 in the 27 countries of the EU.This situation is clearly not optimal for a single currency area or for the EU, as it encourages each country’s financial market to remain domestically-oriented. Investors continue to invest mostly in domestic securities, and as a result, the euro area financial market cannot fully benefit from the risk diversification and competition benefits that arise from having a single currency. These barriers which provoke a considerable competitive disadvantage for European capital markets were identified in a report by the Giovannini group. [...] EU authorities have taken up initiatives to remove impediments to competition between national markets. The most important initiatives from the European Commission are the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID), the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR) and the Central securities depositories Regulation (CSDR). T2S as a pan-European platform is intended to complement these existing initiatives by boosting competition, increasing price transparency and harmonising practices across Europe.|$|R
40|$|Towards an European {{integrated}} financial market: {{the impact}} of the settlement platform T 2 S The European Central Bank (ECB) will offer to banks in 2015 an european shared platform for securities settlement, named TARGET 2 Securities (T 2 S), in order to open the national financial markets. This paper develops a spatial competition model to understand {{the impact of}} this new organisation on european <b>post-trading</b> <b>services.</b> We analyse the incentives of the Central Securities Depositaries (CSD) to move to T 2 S when they become competitors in the market for settlement services and remain in a dominant position for depositary services. Settlement and depositary services are complementary because banks have to pay for these two services to buy or sell a security. We show that such a reform should induce a decrease in the settlement price and more generally in the post-trading prices, but that prices depend strongly on the market organisation and on the attractivity of T 2 S. Under certain conditions, partial adhesion would make prices increase and this configuration appears as a Nash equilibrium. As CSDs are free to adhere to T 2 S, the ECB might be forced to regulate the settlement prices. JEL classification: D 43; G 15; G 20...|$|R

40|$|In {{recent years}} stock exchanges have been {{increasingly}} diversifying their operations into related business {{areas such as}} derivatives trading, <b>post-trading</b> <b>services</b> and software sales. This trend can be observed most notably among profit-oriented trading venues. While the pursuit for diversification {{is likely to be}} driven by the attractiveness of these investment opportunities, it is yet an open question whether certain integration activities are also efficient, both from a social welfare and from the exchanges' perspective. Academic contributions so far analyzed different business models primarily from the social welfare perspective, whereas there is only little literature considering their impact on the exchange itself. By employing a panel data set of 28 stock exchanges for the years 1999 - 2003 we seek to shed light on this topic by comparing the factor productivity of exchanges with different business models. Our findings suggest three conclusions: (1) Integration activity comes at the cost of increased operational complexity which in some cases outweigh the potential synergies between related activities and therefore leads to technical inefficiencies and lower productivity growth. (2) We find no evidence that vertical integration is more efficient and productive than other business models. This finding could contribute to the ongoing discussion about the merits of vertical integration from a social welfare perspective. (3) The existence of a strong in-house IT-competence seems to be beneficial to overcome lower productivity growth associated with complex business models...|$|R
