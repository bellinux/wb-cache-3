40|$|Receptor kinases {{possessing}} intrinsic {{guanylate cyclase}} (GC) activity constitute {{a family of}} catalytically active membrane-bound proteins that play crucial roles in a myriad of signal transduction processes. Currently known GC-linked receptor kinases have an extracellular ligand-binding domain and an intracellular portion that is composed of an inactive kinase homology domain and a functional GC catalytic centre. A novel class of GC-linked receptor kinases was unearthed using homology-guided bioinformatic data mining tools designed from annotated amino acid residues in the GC catalytic centres of lower eukaryotes. The GC catalytic centre in this new class of receptor kinases is encapsulated within an active kinase domain, thereby conferring a dual catalytic function to this class of proteins. This is contrary to currently known classical GC-linked receptor kinases, which are mono-functional. There are currently four members of this novel class of receptor kinases which have been demonstrated to possess intrinsic GC and kinase activity. However, there is a paucity of information as to how this <b>dual</b> <b>catalysis</b> is physiologically regulated. In an attempt to uncover the modulatory mechanisms regulating the <b>dual</b> <b>catalysis</b> of novel GC-linked receptor kinases, this thesis examines the elements influencing the <b>dual</b> <b>catalysis</b> of the phytosulfokine receptor, PSKR 1. Most specifically, this study focuses on how receptor dimerisation, phosphorylation, {{and the effect of}} intracellular signalling molecules like calcium and ATP influence PSKR 1 ’s intrinsic <b>dual</b> <b>catalysis.</b> Analytical ultracentrifugation and size exclusion chromatography have demonstrated that the recombinantly expressed cytoplasmic domain of PSKR 1 is reversibly dimeric in solution. This observation probably represents a catalytically competent physiological arrangement of the receptor that may be a pre-requisite for PSKR 1 -mediated nucleotide cyclase and phospho-transferase activity. Mapping out of the phosphorylation pattern in the cytoplasmic domain of PSKR 1 using tandem mass spectroscopy identified 14 phosphorylation sites; eight phosphoserines, three phosphothreonines and three phosphotyrosines. Further in vitro studies revealed that PSKR 1 is capable of self-phosphorylating and that phosphorylation is essential for PSKR 1 -mediated <b>dual</b> <b>catalysis.</b> Apart from its obvious role in phosphorylation, ATP seemed to potentiate the nucleotide cyclase activity of PSKR 1, possibly through allosteric modulation. Intriguingly, calcium had a direct influence in regulating PSKR 1 -mediated <b>dual</b> <b>catalysis</b> without the aid of calcium sensor proteins such as calmodulin. At physiologically high calcium concentrations, PSKR 1 ’s nucleotide cyclase activity was enhanced while on the other hand the phospho-transferase activity of PSKR 1 was significantly suppressed. This observation points to calcium acting as a molecular switch regulating the <b>dual</b> <b>catalysis</b> of PSKR 1. Taken together, the findings obtained in this study informs a proposed model of how all these regulatory elements modulate PSKR 1 -mediated <b>dual</b> <b>catalysis.</b> In summation, the presence of catalytically relevant motifs within functional protein domains allows signalling proteins to self-regulate and fine-tune their signal output in concert with their immediate cellular environment. This necessitates the need for prospective studies to carry out similar bioinformatics search strategies in order to uncover hidden regulatory elements that facilitate the self-regulation of proteins...|$|R

40|$|Chiral {{molecules}} play {{a central}} role in our daily life and in nature, for instance the different enantiomers or diastereomers of a chiral molecule may show completely different biological activity. For this reason, it is a vital goal for synthetic chemists to design selective and efficient methodologies that allow the synthesis of the desired enantiomer. In this context, it is highly important that the concept of green chemistry is considered while designing new approaches that eventually will provide more environmental and sustainable chemical synthesis. The aim of this thesis is to develop the concept of combining transition metal catalysis and aminocatalysis in one process (<b>dual</b> <b>catalysis).</b> This strategy would give access to powerful tools to promote reactions that were not successful with either transition metal catalyst or the organocatalyst alone. The protocols presented in this thesis based on organocatalytic transformations via enamine or iminium intermediates or both, in combination with transition metal catalysis, describes new enantioselective organocatalytic procedures that afford valuable compounds with high chemo- and enantioselectivity from inexpensive commercial available starting materials. In paper I, we present a successful example of dual catalysis: the combination of transition metal activation of an electrophile and aminocatalyst activation of a nucleophile via enamine intermediate. In paper II, the opposite scenario is presented, here the transition metal activates the nucleophile and the aminocatalyst activates the electrophile via an iminium intermediate. In paper III,we present a domino Michael/carbocyclisation reaction that is catalysed by a chiral amine (via iminium/enamine activation) in combination with a transition metal catalysts activation of an electrophile.

In Chapter 1, the generation of a number of brucine derivatives is described. Taking the advantage of brucine-diol’s excellent molecular recognition capability for multiple organic functional groups, we focused on the synthetic modifications of brucine-diol and the synthesis of brucine N-oxide. We also produced various brucine derivatives with different functional moieties in good yields and selectivities. In Chapter 2, we described the investigation of brucine N-oxide catalyzed Morita-Baylis-Hillman (MBH) reaction of alkyl/aryl ketones. Brucine N-oxide was used as a nucleophilic organic catalyst in the MBH reaction of alkyl vinyl ketone. In addition, asymmetric MBH reactions of alkyl vinyl ketones with aldehydes were investigated using a <b>dual</b> <b>catalysis</b> of brucine N-oxide and proline. In this dual catalyst system, proline was found to form iminium intermediates with electron-deficient aryl aldehydes, while the N-oxide activated vinyl ketones provided enolates through the conjugate addition. Our <b>dual</b> <b>catalysis</b> approach also allowed the development of MBH reaction of aryl vinyl ketones. In Chapter 3, brucine diol-copper complex catalyzed asymmetric conjugate addition of glycine (ket) imines to nitroalkenes is discussed. Stereodivergent catalytic asymmetric conjugate reactions for glycine (ket) imines with nitroalkenes were achieved using various chiral catalysts derived from a single chiral source, brucine diol. Both syn- and anti-conjugate addition products were obtained with high diastereoselectivity and enantioselectivity. In Chapter 4, enantiodivergent production of endo-pyrrolidines from glycine (ket) imines using brucine diol-copper complex is described. The [3 + 2] cycloaddition reaction of glycine imines and activated alkenes was performed to produce endo-pyrrolidines.

In addition, the four coordination sites allow a distinctive advantage {{in the design of}} chiral ligands for asymmetric catalysis that is severely limited in the linear gold(I) catalysts having only two coordination sites. However, poor catalytic activity of the coordinatively saturated gold(III) complexes hindered the development of gold(III) catalysis. We envision that novel strategies of ligand design and substrate activation are the key to open up a new direction for gold(III) catalysis. We report the development of stable bis-cyclometallated gold(III) complexes [Au(C^N) ₂BF₄-] (HC^N = 2 -phenylquinoline and 3 -phenylisoquinoline) as efficient catalysts for organic synthesis by employing two novel strategies: (1) distorted square planar complex design and (2) gold-silver <b>dual</b> <b>catalysis</b> for substrate activation. X-ray crystallography study on the bis-cyclometallated gold(III) complex with bulky 2 -phenylquinoline ligands revealed the distorted square planar geometry and significant elongation of Au-N bonds (up to 0. 141 A) compared to other cyclometallated gold(III) complexes in literatures. Secondly, the significantly higher catalytic activity (83 % vs 8 % isolated yields) in propargylamine synthesis could be attributed to this unique distorted complex geometry. The bis-cyclometallated gold(III) complex could also catalyse the stereoselective propargylamine synthesis (up to 90 % isolated yield and dr > 99 : 1) and oligosaccharide modification with high aldehyde conversion. Thirdly, the catalysts were found to be active in indole alkylation by using a novel gold-silver <b>dual</b> <b>catalysis</b> (up to 80 % isolated yield). Alkylated indoles with different substituents could also be obtained (up to 94 % isolated yield). Finally, recyclability experiments of the catalyst in the propargylamine and dual metal-catalysed alkylated indole synthesis were conducted, demonstrating the exceptionally higher recyclability of bis-cyclometallated gold(III) complexes in catalysis over KAuCl 4. Given the four cordination sites of gold(III) centre, we envisage that the reactivity of gold(III) reductive elimination could be fine-tuned by modular ligand assembly. In this work, we are exploring the novel application of meticulously designed gold(III) complexes for modification of cysteine by C-S bond formation. A ligand controlled C-S bond formation reaction from gold-peptide adducts for chemoselective cysteine modification has been developed. Cyclometallated gold(III) complexes with bidentate msen as an ancillary ligand exhibited excellent cysteine chemoselectivity to give gold-peptide adducts up to 99 % conversion in aqueous medium under mild conditions and various pH values. The structures of gold-peptide adducts and S-arylated peptides were supported by model reactions between the gold(III) complexes and N-acetyl-L-cysteine benzyl amide. C-S bond formation from gold-peptide adducts could be controlled by the corresponding arylpyridine ligands to give S-arylated peptides up to 99 % conversion at 40 ℃. A dansyl functionalized gold(III) complex was synthesized for chemoselective cysteine modification with a biophysical probe under mild reaction conditions.

The physical, structural, and electronic properties of these compounds were explored computationally to understand the influence of the B-N replacement on structure, aromaticity, and the isosteric viability of these analogues. The class of azaborininones could similarly be accessed from both organotrifluoroborates and boronic acids. An inexpensive, common reagent, SiO 2, was found to serve as both a fluorophile and desiccant to facilitate the annulation process across three different azaborininone platforms. Computationally-derived pK a values, NICS aromaticity calculations, and electrostatic potential surfaces revealed a unique isoelectronic/isostructural relationship between these azaborines and their carbon isosteres that changed based on boron connectivity. The 2, 1 -borazaronaphthalene motif can be accessed through robust methods of synthesis and subsequent functionalization strategies, affording an ideal platform to use for a variety of applications. However, the initial scope of substructures for this archetype has been limited by the lack of nitrogen-containing heteroaryls that can be incorporated within them. Modified reaction conditions enabled greater tolerance to provide access to a wider range of substructures. Additionally, computational and experimental studies of solvent decomposition demonstrate that substitution off boron is important to stability. ^ Post-annulation derivitization of the azaborine cores can allow access to higher order functionalized structures. A method for functionalizing the 2, 1 -borazaronaphthalene scaffold using ammonium alkylbis(catecholato) silicates via photoredox/nickel <b>dual</b> <b>catalysis</b> was found to be highly effective. By forging Csp 3 –C sp 2 bonds via this approach, alkyl fragments with various functional groups can be introduced to the azaborine core, affording previously inaccessible heterocyclic isosteres in good to excellent yields. These conditions provide sensitive functional group tolerance, even permitting the cross-coupling of unprotected primary and secondary amines. Regioselective C-H borylation and subsequent cross-coupling of the 2, 1 -borazaronaphthalene core could also be achieved. Although 2, 1 -borazaronaphthalene is closely related to naphthalene in terms of structure, the argument is made that the former has electronic similarities to indole. Based on that premise, iridium-mediated C-H activation has enabled facile installation of a versatile, nucleophilic coupling handle at a previously inaccessible site of 2, 1 -borazaronaphthalenes. A variety of substituted 2, 1 -borazaronaphthalene cores can be successfully borylated and further cross-coupled in a facile manner to yield diverse C(8) -substituted 2, 1 -borazaronaphthalenes. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{numerical}} {{feasability study}} {{was performed on}} the integral performance of dual function catalyst particles in a packed bed reactor equipped with a porous membrane for distributive feeding of oxygen. The exothermic oxidative coupling and the endothermic steam reforming of methane (for simultaneous production of ethylene and synthesis gas) are integrated at the level of a porous catalyst particle with distributed activity, where the presence of the intraparticle heat-sink strongly reduces the total reaction heat and the temperature gradients in the reactor, eliminating the need for expensive conventional cooling of the reactor. Numerical simulations, with reaction kinetics taken from the literature, revealed that with distributive oxygen feeding via membranes indeed the local oxygen concentration in the packed bed membrane reactor can be kept low, which combined with a high Thiele modulus for oxidative coupling makes <b>dual</b> function <b>catalysis</b> possible. Using a reforming core diameter of approximately 15 - 40 micrometer, the steam reforming and oxidative coupling reaction rates could be effectively tuned to achieve autothermal operation, while the methane conversion was enhanced from 34 to 48 % at optimum C 2 production rates. In addition, it was shown that the temperature profiles in the reactor can be strongly reduced by employing the dual function catalyst and that the use of axial oxygen membrane flux profiles enables the use of a singele particle configuration to approach autothermal operation in the entire reactor...|$|R
