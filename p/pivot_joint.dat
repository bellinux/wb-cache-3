50|$|<b>Pivot</b> <b>joints</b> {{allow for}} rotation, {{which can be}} {{external}} (for example when rotating an arm outward), or internal (as in rotating an arm inward). When rotating the forearm, these movements are typically called pronation and supination. In the standard anatomical position, the forearms are supinated, {{which means that the}} palms are facing forward, and the thumbs are pointing away from the body. In contrast, a forearm in pronation would have the palm facing backward and the thumb would be closer to the body, pointing medially.|$|R

DJ headphones have other properties useful for DJs, such as designs that acoustically isolate {{the sounds of}} the headphones from the outside environment (hard shell headphones), flexible headbands and <b>pivot</b> <b>joints</b> to allow DJs to listen {{to one side of the}} headphones, while turning the other headphone away (so he/she can monitor the mix in the club), and replaceable cables. Replaceable cables enables DJs to buy new cables if a cable becomes frayed, worn, or damaged, or if a cable is accidentally cut.|$|R

50|$|An {{articulated}} bus (either a motor bus or trolleybus) is an articulated vehicle used in public transportation. It {{is usually a}} single-deck design, and comprises two rigid sections linked by a <b>pivoting</b> <b>joint</b> (articulation) enclosed by protective folding bellows on the in- {{and outside of the}} vehicle (usually of gray or black colour) and a cover plate {{on the inside of the}} vehicle. This arrangement allows a longer legal overall length than single-decker rigid-bodied buses, and hence a higher passenger capacity, while still allowing the bus to maneuver adequately on the roads of its service route.|$|R
50|$|The {{joints between}} bones allow movement, some {{allowing}} {{a wider range}} of movement than others, e.g. the ball and socket joint allows a greater range of movement than the <b>pivot</b> <b>joint</b> at the neck. Movement is powered by skeletal muscles, which are attached to the skeleton at various sites on bones. Muscles, bones, and joints provide the principal mechanics for movement, all coordinated by the nervous system.|$|E
50|$|The distal radioulnar joint is a <b>pivot</b> <b>joint</b> {{located between}} {{the bones of}} the forearm, the radius and ulna.

The capsule of the joint is lax and extends from the inferior sacciform recess to the ulnar shaft. Together with the proximal radioulnar joint, the distal radioulnar joint permits pronation and supination.|$|E

25|$|These {{equations}} {{mathematically model}} the behaviour of a limb {{in terms of}} a knowledge domain-independent, link-segment model, such as idealized solids of revolution or a skeleton with fixed-length limbs and perfect <b>pivot</b> <b>joints.</b> From these equations, inverse dynamics derives the torque (moment) level at each joint based on the movement of the attached limb or limbs affected by the joint. This process used to derive the joint moments is known as inverse dynamics because it reverses the forward dynamics equations of motion, the set of differential equations which yield the position and angle trajectories of the idealized skeleton's limbs from the accelerations and forces applied.|$|R
40|$|Experience {{has shown}} that the flutter {{prediction}} process for airplanes can be greatly affected by strong concentrated nonlinearities which may be localized in the linking elements of the control mechanism, in the <b>pivot</b> <b>joints</b> of variable-sweep-wing systems, and in the connecting points between wing and pylon-mounted external stores. The principle of equivalent linearization offers an efficent possibility for solving the related nonlinear flutter equations in the frequency domain as a complement to the well-known time domain procedures. Taking as an example an airplane with nonlinear control characteristics, it is demonstrated how the equivalent linearization approach can be extended to rather complicated systems with multiple sets of strongly interacting, concentrated nonlinearities...|$|R
50|$|The Ganz {{form was}} {{used on the}} Hungarian-built Les Belles Hongroisses 2BB2 400 {{locomotives}} for the French PO. This had four links forming the triangle, with the two upper vertices mounted to the locomotive frame (through a short swinging link) and to the jackshaft crankpin. The lower apex of the triangle contained a short triangular link, which linked {{the sides of the}} triangle to the wheel crankpin. By tilting this link, the suspension movement was absorbed. This linkage ran well at speed and as it was composed entirely of <b>pivoting</b> <b>joints</b> with no sliding, there was no lost motion. It was however complex, heavy and unbalanced.|$|R
