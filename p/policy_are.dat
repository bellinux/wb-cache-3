40|$|This study 2 ̆ 7 s {{objective}} was to identify and assess existing physical activity and nutrition policies for Australian schools. <b>Policies</b> <b>were</b> identified through {{a search of the}} websites of national and state/territory education departments and school associations, and were subsequently assessed against specific criteria. <b>Policies</b> <b>were</b> identified for government schools, but only for one non-government school association. Physical activity <b>policies</b> <b>were</b> identified at the national level and for six of eight state/territories. The national <b>policy</b> <b>was</b> mandated, and most state/territory physical activity <b>policies</b> <b>were</b> mandated and consistent with the national policy. Several physical activity policies did not meet expert recommendations for time and instructor qualifications. Nutrition <b>policies</b> <b>were</b> identified at the national level and all eight states/territories. The national <b>policy</b> <b>was</b> not mandated, but all state/territory nutrition <b>policies</b> <b>were</b> mandated and consistent with the national policy and relevant guidelines. Most physical activity and nutrition policies lacked information about implementation monitoring. To improve school practices, <b>policies</b> <b>are</b> needed that are mandated and consistent with expert recommendations, use clear language, and specify monitoring and accountability mechanisms. Implications for public health: Improvements in school policies can promote physical activity and healthy eating behaviours to positively influence student outcomes across Australia...|$|R

25|$|The {{challenges}} of the global food crisis followed by {{challenges of}} the global financial crisis made room for more integrated policy reforms. Considering the massive economic measures {{that have been taken}} over the past 12 months or so, Egyptian economic policymakers score high based on the inside lag, i.e. the lapse of time between the moment that the shock began to affect the economy and the moment that economic (monetary and fiscal) policy as well as the regulatory <b>policy</b> <b>are</b> altered and put into effect in response to the shock to various markets: goods market (real GDP), the labor market (unemployment rate), money market (interest rate and inflation), and the financial (stock and bond) market. Indeed, moderate financial panic occurred driven—at least partially—by the fear that other investors are about to panic and sell. There were falls in stock and bond market prices, and rises in nominal interest rates.|$|E

25|$|Some feminists, such as Carole Pateman, {{believe that}} {{exploitation}} is in both prostitution and sex trafficking. They believe {{that even if}} the women agreed to be a sex worker in a foreign country that the worker was still trafficked because of the preceding conditions that lead her to believe that sex work was the only viable work option. Other feminists such as Kamala Kempadoo, on the other hand, believe that prostitution is a form of labor just like any other migrant labor; however, due to the criminalization of prostitution, prostitutes are then subject to coercion and exploitation and subsequent trafficking. In the USA, each year 80,000 women are arrested for prostitution. Current debates about modifications to Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 <b>policy</b> <b>are</b> based about these two arguments. In providing aid for victims of sex trafficking the government must take a stand on whether or not they believe the sex industry and sex trafficking are inherently linked. These people involved in prostitution have an 80% higher chance of sexually transmitted infections and many never can afford to seek treatment. This results in serious infections, lifelong diseases, and sometimes even death.|$|E
