40|$|Precision {{stopping}} is {{an important}} automated vehicle control function that is critical in applications such as precision bus docking, automated truck or bus fueling, as well as automatic intersection, or toll booth stopping. The initial applications of this technology {{are most likely to}} be applied to heavy-duty vehicles such as buses or trucks. Such applications require specific attention to brake control since the characteristics of a typical <b>pneumatic</b> <b>brake</b> system of a heavy vehicle is inherently nonlinear with large uncertainties. The feasibility of providing a smooth precision stopping brake control based on a conventional <b>pneumatic</b> <b>brake</b> system has not yet been demonstrated. This paper describes the precision stopping problem, verifies the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>brake</b> model, details the indirect adaptive robust control (IARC) design for a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>brake</b> system, and reports the successful implementation of a bus precision docking demonstratio...|$|R

40|$|The {{technology}} and systems used draw from both British and North American systems. Structure and rollingstock gauges are clearly {{influenced by the}} British railway practice, as are braking systems. Wagon couplings on freight trains are predominately auto couplers with friction wedge type draft gear packages showing the North American influence. Privately owned railways on iron ore mines in the Australia’s North West show even more North American influence with American style braking and larger structure and rollingstock gauges. Australia is also characterized by three track gauges a legacy of colonial and state governments before federation. The presence of narrow gauge of 1067 mm, results in a large fleet of rollingstock with design differing from standard gauge rollingstock in North America, Britain and the southern states of Australia. The chapter is arranged to firstly give an overview of longitudinal train dynamics. The second section goes into considerable detail on approaches to modelling longitudinal train dynamics. The most space {{is given to the}} modelling of the wagon connection model. Sub-sections are also devoted to modelling traction and dynamic braking systems, rolling resistance, air resistance, curving resistance, the effect ofgrades and <b>pneumatic</b> <b>braking.</b> The sub section on <b>pneumatic</b> <b>braking</b> only provides an explanation of the effect of <b>pneumatic</b> <b>braking</b> on train dynamics. Modelling <b>pneumatic</b> <b>braking</b> systems would require a chapter in itself.

40|$|The {{development}} of soft actuator for the rehabilitation device and power assisting devices has been required based on aging society. However, a flexible actuator that can generate both larger force and longer displacement {{has not been}} developed. It is also difficult to realize a flexible displacement sensor with long stroke while deforming its form according to the actuator’s shape. In the previous study, the flexible actuator with larger force and longer stroke that can adjust its stroke by giving stepping motion using <b>pneumatic</b> balloons and <b>brakes</b> was proposed and tested. However, the slipping of the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>brake</b> prevents the larger generated force. In this paper, the improved <b>pneumatic</b> <b>brake</b> using a <b>pneumatic</b> balloon and a mechanical chuck is described.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the construction of}} an ASR system that is to control the slip of driving wheels of a vehicle by making use of the construction, function and operation of the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>braking</b> system and the pneumatic suspension control equipment. The essence of the solution presented is the use of the piston-spring part of the spring brake chamber as an actuator in the anti-slip regulation system. In the modernised version of the prototype, the system is controlled by means of a pneumatic solenoid valve, which performs the functions of an ASR modulator. The above concept may be implemented in trucks, buses, or other vehicles provided with <b>pneumatic</b> <b>braking</b> systems. The prototype ASR system proposed was verified by computer simulation tests. Dominika Trębac...|$|R

40|$|This study aims to {{investigate}} the hysteresis <b>characteristics</b> of a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>braking</b> system for multi-axle heavy vehicles (MHVs). Hysteresis affects emergency braking performance severely. The fact that MHVs have a large size and complex structure leads to more nonlinear coupling property of the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>braking</b> system compared to normal two-axle vehicles. Thus, theoretical analysis and simulation are not enough when studying hysteresis. In this article, the hysteresis of a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>brake</b> system for an eight-axle vehicle in an emergency braking situation is studied based on a novel test bench. A servo drive device is applied to simulate the driver’s braking intensions normally expressed by opening or moving speed of the brake pedal. With a reasonable arrangement of sensors and the NI LabVIEW platform, both the delay time of eight loops and the response time of each subassembly in a single loop are detected in real time. The outcomes of the experiment show that the delay time of each loop gets longer {{with the increase of}} pedal opening, and a quadratic relationship exists between them. Based on this, the pressure transient in the system is fitted to a first-order plus time delay model. Besides, the response time of treadle valve and controlling pipeline accounts for more than 80 % of the loop’s total delay time, indicating that these two subassemblies are the main contributors to the hysteresis effect...|$|R
