40|$|Autumn {{applications}} of sulphur – {{a new approach}} to control the <b>pear</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>blister</b> <b>mite</b> Eriophyes pyri. Abstract: The <b>pear</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>blister</b> <b>mite</b> can cause severe damage to pear leaves and young fruits in some regions. Due to hidden living inside leaf blisters, the mites are largely protected against the impact of plant protecting agents. Until now, treatments with mineral oil or rape oil in early spring, during the time when the mites leave their hibernation sites under the bud scales to invade the young leaves and blossoms, are the only possibility to control these mites in Swiss organic fruit growing. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine the effects of sulphur, mineral oil and Surround®WP applied after harvest during the time, when the mites leave their blisters and migrate to their hibernation sites. The different treatments were applied shortly after harvest to benefit from the mild temperatures in September. Counting the number of mites after dissection of the buds in laboratory in autumn and spring showed a good efficacy for all treatments. But the visual control in spring during bloom could not verify these results for all treatments. Only the sulphur-treated trees were virtually free of blisters in spring. With a corrected efficacy (Abbott’s formula) of 95...|$|E

40|$|The <b>pear</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>blister</b> <b>mite</b> Eriophyes pyri (Pagenstecher) causes {{severe damage}} to pear leaves and fruits. As mites are well {{sheltered}} {{from exposure to}} plant protection agents during summer and acaricide efﬁcacy is reduced when temperatures are low in early spring, autumn acaricide applications were evaluated to control mites as they migrate to their hibernation sites. Post-harvest sulphur and mineral oil treatments were applied in September 2003 and mites were monitored in the following spring. Only the sulphur treated trees were virtually free of blisters. Sulphur treatments showed an efﬁcacy of 95. 3 % (one application) to 99. 6 % (three applications), whereas, mineral oil treatments only had an efﬁcacy of 12. 8 % (one application) to 69. 6 % (three applications). That post harvest sulphur applications could decontaminate heavily infested orchards was possible was conﬁrmed by a large-plot trial in two orchards in 2004 / 2005...|$|E

40|$|Recent works {{showed that}} Stemphylium vesicarium, the causal agent of brown spot of pear, {{is able to}} colonize the herb plants of the lawn {{covering}} the orchard soil in a permanent manner. The fungus growths on the dead leaves of these plants as saprophyte and produces conidia from spring to autumn, and pseudothecia and ascospores of Pleospora allii from autumn to spring, more abundantly than on the <b>pear</b> <b>leaf</b> litter. Considering that S. vesicarium does not produce spores on the affected pear tissue, the orchard floor (<b>pear</b> <b>leaf</b> residues and dead herb plants) is then the inoculum source for both ascospores and conidia all season long. Recent works have then evaluated the possibility of reducing disease incidence by sanitation. The application of Trichoderma -based products on the orchard floor significantly reduces production of both ascospores and conidia as well as disease incidence on pear fruit.

Observation during field survey has proved that TuMV has infected caisin and turnip in Java and Bali. The highest intensity of mosaic disease i. e. 63, 3 % occurs in Tumpangan-Malang, followed by Denpasar Selatan and Bandungan-Semarang with the intensity of 30, 5 % and 19, 0 % respectively.

Strains of <b>pear</b> <b>leaf</b> scorch Xyl. fastidiosa (XF-PLS) shared similarities to strains of other host origins in the requirement of complex medium and the exhibition of rippled cell walls, however, recent serological and molecular biology studies showed difference among them. Five strains of XF-PLS were compared with 20 other strains originally isolated from almond, oleander, pecan, plum, peach, mulberry, grapes, citrus, coffee, and sycamore by sequence analyses of the 16 S rRNA gene and 16 S- 23 S rRNA internal transcribed spacer region (ITS). When sequences of 16 S rRNA gene based on fragment size of 1, 537 - 1, 540 bp were compared, the similarity index among 5 XF-PLS strains was 99. 3 - 99. 8 %, whereas it was 97. 8 - 98. 6 % between XF-PLS strains and strains from other hosts. When sequences of 16 S- 23 S rRNA ITS based on fragment size of 510 - 540 bp were compared, the similarity index among 5 XF-PLS strains was 99. 0 - 100 %, whereas it was 80. 7 - 82 % between XF-PLS strains and strains from other hosts. Multiple sequence alignments led to the identification of 5 polymorphic nucleotides in the 16 S rRNA gene among the 25 Xyl. fastidiosa strains, and there were considerable variations in the nucleotide sequences of 16 S- 23 S rRNA ITS between XF-PLS and the other 20 Xyl. fastidiosa strains. The phylogenetic trees revealed that XF-PLS strains were separated from strains of other hosts. Strains of other hosts were divided into four subgroups: strains from (1) oleander, (2) grape, almond M 23 and mulberry, (3) citrus and coffee, and (4) pecan, peach, plum, sycamore and almond M 12.
