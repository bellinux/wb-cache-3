5|$|One of the {{concerns}} of the Irish discussed in the first letter was over what is now known as Gresham's law: debased coins would cause silver and gold coinage to be hoarded or removed from the country, which would further debase the currency. Tenant farmers would {{no longer be able to}} pay their landlords, and, after the tenants were removed, there would be fewer crops grown in Ireland; the increase of <b>poverty</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> decrease of food supply would completely ruin Ireland's economy.|$|E
5|$|Scheduled castes and tribes form 28.6% and 5.8% of the population, respectively, {{in rural}} areas, and 19.9% and 1.5%, respectively, in urban areas.

This indicates {{the importance of}} public provision of health services to mitigate against <b>poverty</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> impact of illness on poor households.|$|E
5|$|Mathias officially {{declared}} his candidacy for the Senate on February 10, 1968, calling for troop {{reductions in the}} Vietnam War, and identifying urban blight, racial discrimination, welfare reform, and improving public schools as major issues. As the campaign drew on, the two primary issues became the war and crime. Mathias argued that the extensive bombing campaigns in North Vietnam should be reduced, while Brewster had argued for increasing bombardment. Brewster adopted a hard line stance on law and order, while Mathias advocated addressing the precipitating causes of <b>poverty</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> low standard of living in urban ghettos. Campaign finances were also an issue, with controversy erupting over Brewster's receipt of $15,000 in campaign contributions from his Senate staff and their families. On November 5, 1968, Mathias was elected, garnering 48% of the vote to Brewster's 39% and perennial candidate George P. Mahoney's 13%.|$|E

5|$|The Old Curiosity Shop is a 1911 American silent short drama film {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film is an adaptation of The Old Curiosity Shop by Charles Dickens that {{was limited to the}} time constrictions of the single reel format. The film focuses on the grandfather who gambles into <b>poverty</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> consequences which eventually claim the life of Little Nell. Its survival and attribution as a Thanhouser film was noted by Kamilla Elliott in her 2003 book Rethinking the Novel/Film Debate under the title Little Nell. In 2012, the work was confirmed to be a Thanhouser production at the Pordenone Silent Film Festival. The identification of the film as Little Nell arose due to head of the film having been lost.|$|E

5|$|The philanthropist Angela Burdett-Coutts {{was active}} in the East End, {{alleviating}} poverty by founding a sewing school for ex-weavers in Spitalfields and building the ornate Columbia Market in Bethnal Green. She helped to inaugurate the London Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, was a keen supporter of the 'Ragged School Union', and operated housing schemes {{similar to those of the}} Model Dwellings Companies such as the East End Dwellings Company and the Four Per Cent Industrial Dwellings Company, where investors received a financial return on their philanthropy. Between the 1890s and 1903, when the work was published, the social campaigner Charles Booth instigated an investigation into the life of London poor (based at Toynbee Hall), much of which was centred on the poverty and conditions in the East End. Further investigations were instigated by the 'Royal Commission on the Poor Laws and Relief of Distress 1905-09', the Commission found it difficult to agree, beyond that change was necessary and produced separate minority and majority reports. The minority report was the work of Booth with the founders of the London School of Economics Sidney and Beatrice Webb. They advocated focusing on the causes of <b>poverty</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> radical notion of poverty being involuntary, rather than the result of innate indolence. At the time their work was rejected but was gradually adopted as policy by successive governments.|$|E
