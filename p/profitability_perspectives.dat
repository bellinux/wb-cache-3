The analysis is performed from both safety and <b>profitability</b> <b>perspectives</b> and {{it aims to}} offer to strategy, technical and business teams {{a representation of the}} value added by the cloud programme within the company’s portfolio. Starting from the importance of the IT Governance in the actual business environments, we presented in the first section the main principles that drive the technology strategy in order to maximize the value added by IT assets in the business products. Section two summarizes the frameworks leveraged by our approach in order to implement the safety and profitability computation algorithms described in the third section. The paper concludes with benefits of our personal frameworks and presents the future developments. Keywords—audit cloud computing; cloud service safety; cloud governance I...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Dial-a-ride systems attract great attentions as a {{style of}} new {{transportation}} systems for urban areas. While it is reported that such systems improve usability of bus systems when applied {{in a small town}} or area, it is not obvious how and under what conditions the system are reasonable in comparison to traditional fixed-route bus systems. We con-ducted several computer simulations of dial-a-ride and fixed-route sys-tems to compare usability and profitability of both systems. Simulation results indicated that: (1) Usability of the dial-a-ride system with a fixed number of buses drops very quickly when the number of demands in-creases. (2) When we increase the number of buses proportionally to the number of demands, the usability of the dial-a-ride system is improved more significantly than the fixed-route system. (3) When frequency of demands is sufficiently large, the dial-a-ride system offers a reasonable solution from both usability and <b>profitability</b> <b>perspectives.</b> ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Fiber optics is a {{relatively}} new technology, one which has not yet been extensively used, because of its high cost. In order to evaluate the viability of such a costly investment, techno-economic models are employed. These models evaluate the investment from both technical (e. g., optimal network design) and economical (e. g., <b>profitability)</b> <b>perspectives.</b> However, an area that has not received much attention is the deployment plans of a given fiber optic investment. Existing works usually compare manually predefined deployment plans that are considered profitable, and then apply techno-economic analysis. While this indeed offers valuable information, it does not guarantee that the examined plans are the optimal ones. This should be considered as a major disadvantage, because there could be other deployment plans that could offer significantly higher profit. This paper offers a first attempt at looking for the optimal deployment plan of fiber optics, based on profit. Our method can be considered as a framework that wraps around existing techno-economic models. We employ a Genetic Algorithm (GA), which creates a population of deployment plans. These plans can then be evaluated through the usual techno-economic approach. The GA then evolves the population of these plans {{and at the end of}} the process acts as a decision support tool that advises on the optimal deployment plan, without the need for any human interference in the decisionmaking process. For comparison purposes, we compare the GA’s results with results under other profitable plans. Results show that the introduction of the use of the GA is very advantageous and leads to a significant increase in profit. I...|$|E

30|$|An {{important}} consideration {{is that this}} analysis takes no account {{of the value of}} the algal biomass produced. From this, it follows that there is a strong incentive to maximize this value, e.g., by conversion of the biomass to valuable products (nutraceuticals, animal food additive, premium organic fertilizer, etc.), to generate a revenue stream which can help to defray the costs of CO 2 capture/recycle. The size of the markets for algae-derived products is inversely related to the product price. Lower value products such as liquid fuels may be less attractive from a <b>profitability</b> <b>perspective,</b> but a utility-scale installation would produce a quantity of algal biomass that would inevitably oversupply lower volume, higher value product markets. However, there is no reason that utility-scale biomass utilization could not focus on developing both markets; lower value markets to utilize significant volumes, along with limited participation in higher value markets to maximize profits. By doing so, higher value market supply, and hence, profitability will be maintained.|$|R
40|$|The Internet {{has changed}} the way people {{purchase}} goods in the 21 st century: many types {{of goods and services}} have become available online. Luxury goods followed this trend after an initial delay, primarily {{due to the nature of}} these goods. At the time of the preparation of this document, there were no proven guidelines for building the most successful e-retail website for luxury goods from the brand management and <b>profitability</b> <b>perspectives.</b> Ralph Lauren (RL) is an established American brand, well known for quality and consistent style in the following categories: clothing for women, men, and children; home goods, accessories; and fragrances. RL Corporation houses many labels that constitute premium and luxury offerings. RL currently sells through the Internet in many countries, in addition to countless company owned stores, 9 flagship stores, department stores and boutiques distributed around the world. To continue growth, RL wants to launch an e-retail website for Canada. This thesis aims to provide supply chain network considerations for the successful operation of the Canadian e-retail website for RL. These considerations stem from a careful look into potential luxury website characteristics that would meet the company objective of elevating the brand towards the luxury category. It is recommended that RL secure expansion capacity that will likely be necessary for B 2 C operation at its Toronto distribution center (DC). In addition, material handling equipment that will process a high volume of small orders should be placed in this DC. The Vancouver cross-docking facility could be expanded in the future as prompted by sales volume and coupled with a DC to cater to the West Coast of Canada. Also, it is recommended that advanced customer tracking systems and databases be employed, especially to determine high value customers for tailored offerings in the luxury segment. by Dilek Tansoy and Yi Linn Teo.

40|$|The {{importance}} of passenger experience in aviation has become well {{understood in the}} last several years. It is now generally accepted that the provision of good passenger experience is not an option, but a necessity, from an aviation <b>profitability</b> <b>perspective.</b> In this paper, we paint a picture of the future passenger experience by consolidating a number of industry and research perspectives. Using the future passenger experience as a starting point, we explore the components needed to enable this future vision. From this bottom-up approach, we identify the need to resolve data formatting and data ownership issues. The resolution of these data integration issues is necessary to enable the seamless future travel experience that is envisioned by the aviation industry. By looking at the passenger experience from this bottom-up, data centric perspective, we identify a potential shift in the way that future passenger terminals will be designed. Whereas currently the design of terminals is largely an architectural practice, in the near future, the design of the terminal building may become more of a virtual technology practice. This of course will pose a new set of challenges to designers of airport terminal environments...|$|R
40|$|We {{examine the}} key factors that {{influence}} a firm's decision whether to use front-loaded or rear-loaded incentives. When using price packs, direct mail coupons, FSI coupons or peel-off coupons, consumers obtain an immediate benefit upon purchase or a front-loaded incentive. However, when buying products with in-pack coupons or products affiliated with loyalty programs, promotion incentives are obtained on the next purchase occasion or later, i. e., a rear-loaded incentive. Our analysis shows that the innate choice process of consumers in a market (variety-seeking or inertia) is an important determinant of the relative impact of front-loaded and rear-loaded promotions. While in both variety-seeking and inertial markets, the sales impact and the sales on discount are higher for front-loaded promotions than for rear-loaded promotions, from a <b>profitability</b> <b>perspective,</b> rear-loaded promotions may be better than front-loaded promotions. We show that in markets with high variety-seeking it is more profitable for a firm to rear-load, and in markets with high inertia it is more profitable to front-load. Model implications are verified using two empirical studies: (a) a longitudinal experiment (simulating markets with variety-seeking consumers and inertial consumers) and (b) market data on promotion usage.

Although {{there has}} been some {{improvement}} over the last decade, the representation of women on corporate boards in many countries, including South Africa, is still alarmingly low. In the quest for gender equality in top corporate ranks and for better corporate governance, legislators and institutional investors have both called for greater diversity on corporate boards. This study determines whether the desired increase in gender diversity on boards, measured as the proportion of women on the board, is linked to greater corporate profitability, in an attempt to establish if there is any justification for appointing women to the board on the grounds of firm financial profitability. The study uses the Top 100 companies listed on the JSE to examine {{the nature of the relationship}} between board gender diversity and corporate profitability, for the period 2004 to 2008. Findings from correlation and regression analyses both portray a positive association between gender diversity in the boardroom and corporate profitability, but a negative association for gender diversity in the executive suite. Industry comparative analysis also shows that, on average, companies with one or more female directors outperform other companies on all three measures of profitability: return on assets, return on equity, and return on sales, whereas companies with one or more female executives show lower average profitability. Therefore, the study can advocate the appointment and inclusion of women on corporate boards from a financial or company <b>profitability</b> <b>perspective,</b> but it cannot do the same for female executives.

40|$|Background: During {{the past}} ten years an {{increasing}} trend of international representation in Swedish boards, referred to as board internationalization, has occured. Figures show that in 1994 foreign board members held 3, 4 % (Sundin & Sundqvist, 1995) of the seats in Swedish companies boards, today that figure is 14, 2 % (Fristedt & Sundqvist, 2005). This trend seems to continue as the nominations of this year is streaming in. Although this trend occurs Swedish business press is questioning why not more foreign directors are being appointed members to board (Almgren, 2006). Fahim (2005) also questions this and argues that companies need to realise that there is a <b>profitability</b> <b>perspective</b> on the subject of diversity. In many of the large Swedish companies the absence of foreign directors is noticed, but there is a few in the forefront which have appointed foreign directors. The reasons for internationalizing a board can be different and it interesting to investigate how forefront companies discuss internationalization in general and which reasons in particular that drives board internationalization. Purpose: The thesis' purpose is to investigate the main rational for board internationalization. Frame of reference: In the frame of reference, four possible influences on the internationalization of the board is presented, in order to be discussed and compared to the empirical findings; corporate governance, ownership structure, stakeholder pressure, and competitive advantage. Method: In order to fulfill the purpose, a qualitative research method is chosen, based on in-depth interviews. The sample consists of ten interviews with chairmen of Swedish boards within companies that are represented by at least one foreign board member. Conclusion: We have concluded that the main rational of board internationalization is the search for competitive advantage, which is believed to be created by a board with diverse competences and networks. Regarding ownership structure, foreign private owners are the only ones that are influencing the internationalization. Both the corporate governance development and the stakeholder pressure are identified in the empirical findings, but not believed to be an influence of internationalization...|$|R

30|$|The {{main purpose}} of {{interviews}} and the key question was {{to find out the}} effective metrics to evaluate supply chain performance in case companies. Eighty-one metrics were resulted from interviews (shown in Table  2). As mention during interviews, some managers believed that it is needed to add some new metrics to their scorecards, to create more value for stakeholders. Hence, some new metrics were added according to experts’ ideas mentioned in Table  2. In practice, most of the metrics correlate with each other and have tangled cause-and-effect interplays and can be fitted into more than one perspective (Norrekilt 2000). But some metrics have higher correlations {{with each other and with}} BSC perspectives. As an example, higher level of customer expectations (customer perspective) will lead companies to use new technology (learning and growth perspective) and this in turn will increase the market share and <b>profitability</b> (financial <b>perspective)</b> (Bhagwat and Sharma 2007). In most studies, performance metrics are classified into four perspectives and directly in quantitative terms. Therefore, metrics with high correlations with each other and BSC perspectives have to be identified and classified into four BSC categories. In this study, a statistical method is applied to identify high correlation between metrics and BSC perspectives.|$|R

40|$|This {{theoretical}} essay {{examines the}} role of transaction costs along the value chain from a Porterian perspective, aiming to propose a conceptual apparatus that combines {{the view of the}} firm as a set of activities connected by links with that of the firm as a nexus of transactions and costs that cause loss of value. Using the literature on transaction cost economics and Porter’s competitive advantage, we elaborated a framework that separates value creation by a firm into three dimensions: value created by the activities, activity costs and cost of links. We also recognize that link costs are moderated by a firm’s institutional matrix, governance structures, and economies of scale and scope. The incorporation of these constructs is this paper’s primary contribution. We concluded that despite having differing orientations regarding <b>profitability,</b> the Porterian <b>perspective</b> and transaction cost economics have the potential for integration since analysis of value creation in the firm is incomplete when only using one of the approaches...|$|R

The impact is positive as well as negative. The positive aspects are manifold and the negative aspects can be worked upon to keep them sustainable. Telecommunication products have variety of ranges and apart from the business growth the telecommunication products have considerable contribution in development of the society. The telecommunication business is going through constant changes or up gradations and there is always a corresponding change realized from business point of view and hence the proportional change witnessed by the society. The telecom companies through their commercial operations actively contribute to the progress of the society. In India, the rural market segment forms a considerable part of the entire geography and telecom industry plays a major role in the rural development initiatives promoted by the Government of India in most economic way.

40|$|Competition {{and demand}} {{volatility}} often cause modern enterprises {{to be confronted}} by uncertain environments. When a firm manages revenue in such competitive and risky environments, the optimization of pricing and capacity allocation, subject to a fixed time and capacity, becomes a complicated problem. Many previous papers concerning revenue management (RM) and pricing require that the firm possesses the ability to know the demand curve (or demand distribution) and set prices on it to maximize profits. However, this assumption {{may not be the}} case in some industries. Therefore, this paper focuses on the dynamic lead indicators rather than assumptive lag indicators to establish a concise and flexible decision model for practical use. This paper provides an integrated real options (IRO) approach with analytic hierarchy process (AHP) for the auction RM problem under competitive/dynamic pricing and revenue uncertainty in Internet retailing.

This paper seeks to exploit the momentum <b>profitability</b> from the <b>perspective</b> of the excursion patterns in the stock price movements. A theoretical framework is developed for momentum strategy analysis and the long memory process in the financial markets. To test the null hypothesis of the Random Walk Hypothesis and the Efficient Market Hypothesis, we employ the Hurst exponent to detect the long-term memory existed in the stock return series. A time series with 0 < H < 0. 5 shows negative correlations between points and a mean-reverting behavior, while a series with 0. 5 < H < 1 indicates positive correlations and a long memory process. Basic momentum strategies are further applied to the past stock price data, and the back testing results show that there is a U-shaped relationship between {{the strategy}} returns and Hurst exponent. This paper also builds on earlier model of a rule-based naïve trading strategy using Hurst exponent as a signal. The strategy generates remarkably higher profitability compared with the benchmark returns. These findings provide new evidence against the random walk assumption and present challenges to a number of rational asset pricing theories. 	   ii 2021 - 05 - 3...|$|R

Irrigation is a method which supplies amount of water required in proper time to the cropped land and contributes to the increases of agriculture productivity. Using diesel pump to deliver water to the place of use causes problems both in terms of <b>profitability</b> and environmental <b>perspectives.</b> Higher price of diesel increases operation costs of diesel water pumping system thereby reducing the incomes. In addition the use of diesel pump emits a huge amount of CO 2 emissions which cause global warming. A possible solution to those problems is to use solar energy, a source of energy which is environmental friend and available for free. The main target of this thesis is to design and optimize a cost effective PVWPs considering three alternatives with tank storage, battery storage and a system without storages medium. The two areas in Eastern province of Rwanda were taken as case study to grow coffee and cassava with five hectares each. To run simulations, different tools have been used. Those includes CROPWAT to determine water requirements for two crops; MS Excel to design a PVWPs directly connected to irrigation system, make economic analysis, evaluate CO 2 emissions and calculate other parameters. Furthermore in PVsyst software the design and simulation for PVWPs with storages medium has been carried out.   Results showed that using PVWPs directly connected to irrigation system is the most profitable way when compared to the rest two alternatives.   They also showed that systems designed to irrigate coffee becomes the most profitable due to huge amount of electricity surplus and higher price per kilogram of coffee.

40|$|This {{research}} was undertaken to achieve two main objectives. The first {{objective was to}} investigation whether working capital management (WCM) is associated with profitability of Alternative Investment Market (AIM) listed Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) companies. The second objective was to investigate through a questionnaire survey the WCM practices of AIM listed SMEs and their effect on <b>profitability</b> from the <b>perspective</b> of financial directors. These two objectives were met {{by the use of}} a mixed research method approach. The study employed two research methods by collecting both quantitative and qualitative data. The financial data analysis is based on the annual reports of 160 AIM listed SMEs over a six year period (960 firm years) for the period 2005 to 2010. The findings of the panel data regression analysis show that SMEs with shorter inventory holding period, shorter accounts receivable period and shorter accounts payable period are more profitable. However, no evidence was found that cash conversion cycle has any effect on profitability of AIM listed SME companies. Under the control variables the corporate governance factors including: board size, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) age, CEO tenure and directors remuneration were found to be statistically significant in explaining the profitability of AIM listed SME companies. Also, the following company specific characteristics were found to have statistically significant effect on AIM listed SME companies’ profitability: company age, company size, asset tangibility, gross working capital efficiency and working capital requirement. In terms of the WCM practices, a questionnaire analysis was used. Questionnaires were sent to 248 companies to examine the WCM practices of AIM listed SME companies from the view point of financial directors. The analysis employed both t-test and one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). The findings of the t-test and one-way ANOVA analysis indicate that there are significant differences in the perception of financial directors about each component of WCM. First, there are differences in the educational level and work experience of financial directors and their attitude towards WCM. Second, there are differences in the importance attached to the effect of each component of WCM to profitability. Third, the results indicate significant differences in the way AIM listed SME companies set target level and strategy pursued for each component of WCM...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{analyzes the}} effect of R 2 ̆ 6 D and advertising on <b>profitability</b> from the <b>perspective</b> of transfer pricing analysis. After providing {{a review of the}} theoretical and economic literature on R 2 ̆ 6 D and advertising, it examines the standard financial models applied to intangible asset valuation and finds them lacking. The dissertation then examines the empirical relationship between R 2 ̆ 6 D, advertising, and profitability in greater detail using financial data for publicly-listed manufacturing firms over the period 1950 – 1998. As expected, the analysis confirms that current-period advertising and R 2 ̆ 6 D {{have a significant impact on}} current-period profitability. For transfer pricing analysis, establishing the relative contribution of R 2 ̆ 6 D and advertising to profitability is an important consideration. These results suggest that the impact of advertising on profitability is considerably closer to the impact of R 2 ̆ 6 D than the literature review suggests. This dissertation also estimates various distributed lag models to determine the relative duration of advertising and R 2 ̆ 6 D, although these models do not provide robust results. As an alternative, an estimate of the relative duration of advertising and R 2 ̆ 6 D is derived from a financial market valuation approach. These results support the conclusion that the duration of advertising 2 ̆ 7 s effect on profitability is considerably closer to that of R 2 ̆ 6 D than previous studies have suggested. Both the relative magnitude and the relative duration of advertising and R 2 ̆ 6 D effects have important ramifications for transfer pricing policies. This dissertation then examines geographical segment data for manufacturing firms over the period 1991 – 1996, in order to determine whether there is evidence that is consistent with the hypothesis that MNCs use cross-border technology payments to minimize their overall tax burden. While the evidence is not conclusive, it does show that firms with greater R 2 ̆ 6 D intensity have greater profitability differences between the parent companies and their foreign locations, and that these profitability differences are positively correlated with tax differentials. These results suggest the need for greater clarity and consistency in the development of international tax regulations on intercompany transactions involving intangible assets. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{report is}} the result of an {{investigation}} of the possibility to use RFID-technology in a producing company. The investigation is focused on a flow between the company’s producing subsidiary company in Lithuania and its main facility in Sweden. RFID is the abbreviation for radiofrequency identification. The RFID-technology forms the base of a system with wireless information transmission between an object to which a transponder, also called tag, has been attached and a reader. The information is transmitted by radio waves and the system is equipped with software that can digitalise the radio waves. The information is thereby converted into useful input to, for example, the company’s business system. RFID makes it possible to decrease the human interaction necessary and does not demand free line of sight in contrast to barcode systems. The objective of this final thesis is to: ·         give suggestions of how RFID can be applied in the flow of pallets between the Lithuanian subsidiary company and the main facility in Sweden ·         investigate if the adoption is practicable and what consequences will follow the suggested appliance ·         present profitability calculations ·         investigate what future opportunities the technology offers the company The scope of my work {{is to be able to}} present a report to the company that gives them a good insight in the RFID-technology and to give suggestions on how to use it in their operations. The report shall be useable as a decision basis for the company when deciding weather it is interesting for them to continue the investigation or not. The result of the investigation is a description of the flow which forms the basis of the two suggested alternatives of application of RFID-technology. The first alternative consists of a system of active tags which is attached to the pallets directly after the goods are produced. The second alternative is a system based on the use of passive tags in the form of self adhesive labels. Both alternatives induce a division of the flow into five zones between which a reading of the tags takes place and the pallets are thereby identified automatically. The system of active tags results in an initial investment of SEK 1   256   000 and the system of passive tags, SEK 227   000. Both alternatives make a SEK 648   000 saving in cost possible, mainly consisting of decreasing need of working effort in identifying pallets and manual reporting to the business system.     An analysis of the suggestions shows that the pay-back time for the alternative with active tags may be too long depending on the company’s intentions of future expansion of the system. The investment can be proven justifiable after a more thorough investigation. Concerning the system of passive tags, the analysis shows that the alternative is practicable and gives a great chance of fast profitability and also further profitability over time. The investigation is based on a theoretic study of RFID, Supply Chain Management and process analysis. A survey of the process has resulted in a flow chart and this has formed the basis of the work resulting in the two suggested applications. These have then been evaluated from a <b>profitability</b> and practicability <b>perspective.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Programs such as REDD (reducing {{emissions}} from deforestation and forest degradation) that provide {{financial incentives to}} maintain natural carbon stocks are being implemented worldwide to address climate change and the conservation of threatened ecosystems. In developing countries, where the relative cost of conservation is high, these programs are especially attractive to promote sustainable resource use and prevent conversion of valuable ecosystems to other land uses. To incorporate REDD effectively in these areas, the financial costs and benefits resulting from the project implementation needs to be accessed. Quantification of income received from ecosystem services under baseline and project scenarios needs to be estimated, along with other costs of conservation management {{in order for a}} comprehensive comparison to be done. Ensuring that the project not only generates additional value, but also promotes the livelihoods of communities that rely on these ecosystems is key to the long-term sustainability of conservation efforts. This report serves as a cost-benefit analysis case study in Ambro-Ambanja Bay, Madagascar. This financial analysis looks at Blue Ventures’ proposed conservation of mangrove forests in Northwestern Madagascar using a REDD project. Project cash flows center around net income derived from certain ecosystem services, carbon income generated from REDD and project implementation and transaction costs. One limitation of this analysis is the exclusion of several partial, indirect and non-use ecosystem services provided by the Ambro-Ambanja Bay mangrove forest. To address this, a total economic valuation framework of all ecosystem services provided by Ambro-Ambanja Bay mangroves was created to provide additional insight into the entire estimated value of healthy mangrove forests. The first chapter of this report provides a background on mangrove ecosystems, the state of Ambaro-Ambanja Bay mangroves, and the general objectives of the proposed project. The second chapter provides an overview of methods used to estimate deforestation, methods used to derive the net income generated from various ecosystem services, and estimates of the costs associated with the project. The chapter details how these costs and benefits were derived under the baseline and project scenarios to provide insight on the impacts the two scenarios have on the estimated financial cash flows. 	The third chapter consists of a financial analysis of the project from the perspective of each of the major stakeholders. The financial assumptions are stated along with an overview of the government, project developer and community perspectives. Costs and benefits for each perspective were summarized in the form of net present values (NPV), which were calculated under various scenarios. It was found that the project was profitable for the government and community perspectives, and breakeven for the project developer, when carbon income was included. Major differences in NPVs between the assorted scenarios were analyzed and the sensitivities of those NPVs to changes in the stated assumptions were also tested. The fourth chapter details a proposed framework for valuing the additional ecosystem services that were not valued in the initial cost benefit analysis. An overview of those ecosystem services along with the various methods chosen to value each service is discussed. Benefit transfer was the main method employed to value the partial, indirect and non-use services. The section then details what literature estimates, data and calculations were used or are needed to derive the annual per hectare value provided by each service from healthy Ambaro-Ambanja Bay mangroves. The fifth chapter identifies the aspects of the project that might introduce risk to the long-term sustainability of the project. These risks include delayed benefits from the community perspective due to a 14 year project payback period, heavy reliance on carbon credit income for project profitability from the community perspective, and reliance on donor funding to break even from the project developer perspective. Proposed management considerations to mitigate these risks include project refinancing, potential development of an additional project income generating activity, and diversification of donor funding sources. This report makes several key points and recommendations: •	Analyzing project <b>profitability</b> from the <b>perspective</b> of all major stakeholders is important in identifying where potential risks lie and who will be bearing those risks. •	Although measures of net present value provide a simplified summary of the total discounted value received, it is critical to look deeper into the characteristics of the distribution of costs and benefits over time and the impacts it might have on stakeholders, especially those that are risk-averse. •	Assumptions based on extremely volatile and new markets, such as the Voluntary Carbon Market, need to be made with caution and tested for project sensitivity. •	Estimation and assessment of the total economic value (TEV) of all of the ecosystem services is needed to determine the true value of healthy mangroves in Ambaro-Ambanja Bay. The indirect value of these services and the impact of deforestation on that value need to be considered by the stakeholders...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, {{organisations must}} {{cope with the}} {{pressure}} of cost reduction and efficiency in order to succeed in a highly competitive business environment. However, drivers to improve social interaction and employee’s performance and as such to contribute to organisational goals and objectives make it necessary {{to be concerned with}} other performance criteria as well, such as effectiveness, flexibility, employee satisfaction, productivity and creativity. There is a growing need for performance management and performance measurement that not only covers all aspects of an organisation, but which can be applied to various situations in a changing internal and external environment. Performance measurement methods which include an integrated perspective of performance have become essential. In addition, it has been realised that corporate real estate can contribute to organisational performance (Nourse and Roulac, 1993, De Vries et al., 2008, Lindholm, 2008, Den Heijer, 2011, Jensen et al., 2012). For this reason, worldwide organisations started to implement new ways of working in a more open and flexible work environment. Although there are various objectives and drivers of workplace change, the common objectives are to reduce costs and to increase efficiency. The changing organisational and external contexts, such as the increasing demand for talented knowledge workers and changing work patterns, have {{led to the development of}} new offices that can promote social networks and interaction among employees. The new workplace does not only aim at achieving cost efficiency, but it should also support employee satisfaction and productivity. This PhD research focuses on both themes i. e. performance measurement of workplace change. The aim of this research is to provide a conceptual framework that visualises the impact of workplace change on employees’ responses to the new work environment and to present guidelines on performance measurement of workplace change in different contexts. Two organisations in Thailand and one organisation in The Netherlands were selected to serve as case studies. The impact of culture was explored as a contextual background. Research methods Based on literature review an overview of performance measurement systems and measures has been developed. The list of corporate real estate performance measures has been classified in six categories according to Bradley (2002) and subsequently compared with the findings from the case studies. The six categories include: 1) stakeholder perception, 2) financial health, 3) organisational development, 4) productivity, 5) environmental responsibility and 6) cost efficiency. The impact of workplace change was examined using the work environment diagnosis instrument (WODI) questionnaire which evaluates employees’ responses to the changed work environment in three areas: employee satisfaction, perceived productivity support and prioritised aspects (Maarleveld, et al., 2009). The Organisational Culture Assessment Instrument (OCAI; Cameron and Quinn, 2006) was used to assess organisational culture. National culture was measured by using the Value Survey Module 94 (VSM 94; Hofstede, 1997). Research findings The conceptual framework that came to the fore from the literature review showed to be useful for both theoretical understanding of performance measurement and practical applications. Proposed performance measures have been applied in all three case studies but in different ways. The three case studies showed that performance measurement of an organisation is multi-dimensional. It includes several performance criteria and performance measures beyond cost efficiency. All seven performance criteria mentioned by Sink and Tuttle (1989) have been applied in all three cases including effectiveness, efficiency, quality, productivity, quality of worklife, innovation and <b>profitability.</b> The four <b>perspectives</b> of the Balanced Scorecard (financial, customer, internal business process, learning & growth) are applied in all three cases as well, with different points of focus regarding their business types. The corporate real estate performance measures found in the case studies and classified in the six categories can be aligned with most of the areas of the added value of CREM in the literature and can also be viewed as value dimensions. In all three cases, the performance measures related to human resource management were focused on the occupiers having been provided with an office environment that enables employees to increase their productivity. The findings show that organisation and workplace change characteristics have an influence on the satisfaction of employees. The physical characteristics of workplace change that have influenced different degrees of employee satisfaction include location, building grade, architectural design, workplace concept and supporting facilities. The findings also show a negative impact of workplace design on perceived productivity support, due to the miscalculation of the users’ needs and preferences during the implementation process. Furthermore staff characteristics, the work process and work patterns showed to have an effect on which work environment aspects employees perceive as being most important. Regarding the impact of culture, the findings show that the dominant organisational culture types obtained from the organisational culture survey have been influenced by the structure and staff characteristics of the case organisations. The data from the national culture surveys that were conducted in the case studies show large differences in comparison to the findings from the studies by Hofstede (1997). These differences can be explained by the organisational context. Conclusions The cross-case analysis led to several conclusions: • The relevance of corporate real estate performance measures depends on different stakeholders, and different real estate and managerial levels. • The study confirms that measuring employee satisfaction of the work environment can be used as a means to measure organisational performance. • The empirical findings confirm the relevance of the variables shown in the conceptual model of workplace change appraisal and the integrated conceptual model that connects organisational characteristics and characteristics of work processes to objective and subjective performance measurement indicators. • The findings show that information about organisational and national culture is vital for the interpretation of workplace characteristics and the appraisal of change. • The study shows that neither organisational nor national culture has absolute dominance in the employees’ appraisals. • The findings proved that national culture data from Hofstede cannot be generalised to organisations; on organisational level huge discrepancies were found with employees’ between scores on cultural dimensions and national culture indices. These conceptual frameworks on performance measurement and employees’ appraisals of workplace change can be used as a reference to provide input for further improvement of performance measurement and performance management. Many variables such as staff characteristics, work process, cultures and workplace characteristics simultaneously impact the performance measurement of workplace change. The relevance to performance management is that the organisations should be aware of the possible relationships between variables in the integrated conceptual model which could have an impact on performance measurement. The role of real estate that exceeds an operational asset focusing cost efficiency to also include a strategic resource contributing to other criteria of an organisational performance has been shown in this study. A step-by-step plan for prioritisation of corporate real estate performance measures and KPIs has been introduced as a means to find a balance between the costs of measuring and the benefits of being able to manage corporate real estate efficiently and effectively and as such to contribute to achieving organisational objectives and to supporting the core business and organisational performance. Methodological reflections The empirical studies include a combination of both qualitative and quantitative methods. The qualitative data from the case studies which were analysed inductively helped to understand workplace change phenomenon, to clarify the relationships between the variables in the conceptual framework of workplace change, and to answer the research questions formulated at the beginning of the thesis. So far, the quantitative data from questionnaire surveys were used to explore the relationships between employees’ responses to workplace change and organisational and national culture in a qualitative way. The collected data can be used for further exploration of complex relationships by statistical analysis. Triangulation of data collected from different sources (documents, surveys, interviews) helps to validate the findings through cross verification, i. e. reduce weakness or intrinsic biases from the researcher’s background knowledge. The assessment of both tangible (physical characteristics) and intangible components (perceived quality) of the office environment can help to validate the findings from the empirical research. This research study is an exploration of performance measurement concerning workplace change in different contexts. The conclusion of this study is based on the findings from two Thai cases and one case in the Netherlands. Although there are assumed cause-effect relationships between the variables in the conceptual models, more case studies are needed in order to collect comparable data that support the findings of this kind of research...|$|R
