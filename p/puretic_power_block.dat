50|$|The <b>Puretic</b> <b>power</b> <b>block</b> {{line was}} {{introduced}} in the 1950s and was the key factor in the mechanization of purse seining. The combination of these blocks with advances in fluid hydraulics and the new large synthetic nets changed the character of purse seine fishing. The original <b>Puretic</b> <b>power</b> <b>block</b> was driven by an endless rope from the warping head of a winch. Nowadays, power blocks are usually driven by hydraulic pumps powered by the main or auxiliary engine. Their rpm, pull and direction can be controlled remotely.|$|E

40|$|Australia is endeavouring {{to expand}} the mix of power resources, and is {{investing}} heavily {{in the development of}} renewable generation methods such as concentrated solar thermal power. In these systems, the <b>power</b> <b>block</b> and turbine need to maintain high efficiency under non-ideal conditions away from the design point. Literature shows that there is a clear relationship between the selection of fluids, the design of the operating cycle, the fluctuation in operating conditions and changes in <b>power</b> <b>block</b> performance. It is thus important for innovative <b>power</b> <b>block</b> designs to consider the performance of the system as a whole rather than by component, mainly turbine design, cycle development and economic analysis. However, there are few works that consider the coupling of multidisciplinary design and robust design to turbine-fluid selection and economic analysis for realistic systems. Furthermore, existing methodologies for robust optimisation often do not consider the effects of high-density gas properties on the performance of the <b>power</b> <b>block.</b> It is also critical that a power generation system produces ideal economic outcomes that meet a number of key performance indicators including levelised cost of electricity. Therefore, this paper develops a preliminary multidisciplinary design and robust design applied to turbine-fluid selection and economic analysis of a solar-thermal <b>power</b> <b>block.</b> In this work, an Organic Rankine Cycle using novel working fluids for a solar thermal power system is developed. Integrating robust optimisation into the development of the <b>power</b> <b>block</b> is key to push efficiency further and guarantee <b>power</b> <b>block</b> feasibility when running at non-ideal conditions. A preliminary multidisciplinary optimisation is applied to design the complete <b>power</b> <b>block</b> concept such that the <b>power</b> <b>block</b> operates at peak performance across multiple analysis approaches. When using a multidisciplinary design approach, it is possible to perform robust optimisation on the whole <b>power</b> <b>block</b> where the target is on the economic outcomes rather than traditional targets such as efficiency, specific power generation capacity or size...|$|R
50|$|Within a few months, during 1953 in San Pedro {{he invented}} the <b>Puretic</b> <b>power</b> <b>block.</b> A job which once needed 8 to 10 people could now equally quickly {{be done with}} only 5 or 6 people, but still no one was {{interested}} in the product.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>Puretic</b> <b>power</b> <b>block</b> {{revolutionized}} {{the technology of}} hauling fishing nets, particularly purse seine nets. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), [...] "no single invention has contributed more {{to the success of}} purse seine net hauling" [...] than the power block, which was [...] "the linch-pin in the mechanization of purse seining".|$|E
50|$|Seine fishing {{industries}} rapidly {{recognized the}} value of the <b>power</b> <b>block,</b> and by 1960, most northern seine vessels were using the <b>power</b> <b>block.</b> Nowadays <b>power</b> <b>blocks</b> come with dozens of configurations and sizes. They are installed on over twenty thousand fishing vessels across the major purse seining fisheries around the world. These fisheries haul huge schools of tuna, salmon, herring, sardines, anchovies and menhaden from the sea, accounting for a large part the world total fish catch.|$|R
50|$|The <b>power</b> <b>block</b> is a {{mechanized}} pulley used on some seiners {{to haul in}} the nets. According to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, {{no single}} invention has contributed more {{to the success of}} purse seine net hauling than the <b>power</b> <b>block.</b>|$|R
50|$|The use of <b>power</b> <b>blocks</b> {{was found}} to have further advantages. It is {{possible}} to fish in rougher weather with the <b>power</b> <b>block,</b> because the steady force exerted by the net stabilizes the vessel. When deployments are made which miss the schooling fish, the net can be rapidly retrieved and redeployed on the same school. The <b>power</b> <b>block</b> also makes it easy to get nets aboard in emergencies, such as a sudden shift in tides or winds, or shark attacks on the catch and net.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Puretic</b> <b>power</b> <b>block</b> is {{a special}} kind of {{mechanised}} winch used to haul nets on fishing vessels. The power block is a large powered aluminium pulley with a hard rubber-coated sheave. While many men were needed for the back-breaking work of hauling a purse seine manually, the same work could be done by fewer men with a power block.|$|E
50|$|The <b>puretic</b> <b>power</b> <b>block</b> {{revolutionized}} {{the fishing industry}} {{in such a way}} that FAO stated that no single invention has contributed more to the success of purse seine net hauling than extensive line of Power Blocks.In 1972 Canada issued a five dollar bill with a salmon seiner on the reverse. In 1975, Mario Puratić was proclaimed the inventor of the year in the United States and also one among America's most famous 100 inventors of the 20th century.|$|E

50|$|There {{are several}} {{advantages}} to the drum seine over the <b>power</b> <b>block.</b> The net can be hauled very quickly - {{at more than}} twice the speed of using a <b>power</b> <b>block,</b> the net does not require overhead handling, and the process is therefore safer. The most important advantage is that the drum system can be operated with fewer deckhands.|$|R
40|$|Some {{problems}} of fire-, explosion safety and acceptable heat state {{support of the}} turbocompressor unit <b>power</b> <b>block</b> equipment were considered. Research of the <b>power</b> <b>block</b> equipment heat state in the presence and absence of external heat insulation of the converted gas-turbine engine case was performed by computational fluid dynamics methods. Based on the maximum permissible gas-turbine engine case temperature under the conditions of fire- and explosion safety, thickness of heat-insulating mats on the different gas-turbine engine case parts was calculated. Simulation results have shown essential decrease of the temperatures of the gasturbine engine case external surface and low-sized <b>power</b> <b>block</b> equipment under low reduction of turbine efficiency and gas-turbine engine power due to additional heat expansion of the case. Advisability of external heat insulation application on the cases of converted gas-turbine engines, working in turbocompressor unit <b>power</b> <b>block</b> enclosures, needs additional feasibility study. ??????????? ????????? ???????? ??????????? ???????????????????????? ? ??????????? ????????? ????????? ???????????? ??????? ?????? ?????????????????? ?????????. ???????? ?????????????? ????????????????? ??????????? ???????? ????????? ???????????? ???????? ????? ??? ??????? ? ??? ?????????? ??????? ???????? ???????? ??????? ????????????????? ?????????????? ?????????. ??????? ????????????????? ?????, ??????????? ?? ????????? ???????? ??????? ?????????, ??????????????, ?????? ?? ??????????? ?? ???????????, ??????????? ?????????? ?? ???????? ????????????????????????. ?????????? ????????, ??? ???????? ??????? ????????? ???????? ????????? ???????? ? ????????????? ???????? ?????????? ??? ???????? ??????????? ? ?????????????? ???????????? ???????? ????? ??? ????????? ?????????? ???????????? ????????? ???????? ??????? ? ???????? ?????????, ??-?? ??????????????? ????????? ?????????? ???????. ???????????????? ?????????? ??????? ???????? ???????? ???????? ???????????????? ??????????, ?????????? ? ??????? ??????? ?????? ?????????????????? ?????????, ??????? ??????????????? ???????-?????????????? ???????????...|$|R

50|$|While he {{was working}} as a tuna and sardine {{fisherman}} from San Pedro, California, Puratić started thinking about the difficulty of hauling seine nets. The original <b>power</b> <b>block</b> he designed was essentially a simple winch which used a V-shaped roller coated with hard rubber. It was suspended from a davit, and powered from the warp end of the winch by a looping rope. In 1954, the <b>power</b> <b>block</b> was trialled by American purse seiners in the Pacific. They have evolved since then, and nowadays <b>power</b> <b>blocks</b> are <b>powered</b> by hydraulic pumps. Their speed, torque and direction can be remotely controlled from the bridge during operations. As a result, retrieving the net is safer and requires less manual work.|$|R
40|$|Organic Rankine cycle (ORC), {{powered by}} line-focusing concentrating solar {{collectors}} (parabolic trough collector and linear Fresnel reflector), is a promising option for modular scale. ORC based <b>power</b> <b>block,</b> with dry working fluids, offers higher design and part-load efficiencies compared to steam Rankine cycle (SRC) in small-medium scale, with temperature sources up to 400 degrees C. However, {{the cost of}} ORC <b>power</b> <b>block</b> is higher compared to the SRC <b>power</b> <b>block.</b> Similarly, parabolic trough collector (PTC) system has higher optical efficiency and higher cost compared to linear Fresnel reflector (LFR) system. The thermodynamic efficiencies and <b>power</b> <b>block</b> costs also vary with working fluids of the Rankine cycle. In this paper, thermo-economic comparisons of organic Rankine and steam Rankine cycles powered by line focusing concentrating solar collectors are reported. A simple selection methodology, based on thermoeconomic analysis, and a comparison diagram for working fluids of power generating cycles are also proposed. Concentrating solar power plants with any collector technology and any power generating cycle can be compared using the proposed methodology. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{considers}} {{the influence of}} impulse unloading of APS <b>power</b> <b>block</b> turbine on its dynamic steadiness. The performed calculations while simulating four various impulse turbine characteristics {{have shown that the}} highest effect is obtained while characteristics of APS <b>power</b> <b>block</b> turbine are close to the characteristics of a steam turbine K- 300 / 240. It has been established that an application of standard time interval for emergency automation startup and existing delay in the operation of electro-hydraulic transformer do not allow to influence on acceleration area and the positive effect due to load shedding is reached only due to an increase of braking site. While decreasing time period for control signal supply from 0, 2 sec to 0, 1 sec it is possible to increase steadiness by 10 %  for impulse characteristics of APS <b>power</b> <b>blocks</b> and by 39, 9 – 42, 6 % – for characteristics of the turbine K- 300 / 240. </p...|$|R

40|$|High thermal {{stresses}} are created during {{the operation of}} <b>power</b> <b>block</b> devices such as boiler drums, outlet headers, steam valves, turbines and heat exchangers. Due to a cyclic character of such stresses, a phenomenon of low-cyclic fatigue occurs, which {{may lead to the}} formation of fractures. Manufacturers of <b>power</b> <b>block</b> devices frequently advice the users to keep within the prescribed limits for maximum heating and cooling rates of elements [1]. Attempts are made to develop algorithms for operating <b>power</b> <b>blocks</b> [2, 3]. Thanks to these mathematical systems, one is able to extend the life of operating devices and shorten the duration of all transient operations. It is necessary to find temperature and pressure histories during heating and cooling operations of pressure elements so the maximum equivalent stresses at stress concentration points would not exceed the allowable values based on the assumed element lifetime. In this work, optimization will be done {{on the basis of a}} calculation of an initial medium temperature step and following that the maximum heating or cooling rate of temperature changes. The calculated results will have a very high practical significance because it will be possible to use them in power plants. Temperature step change can be easily implemented by suddenly opening hot water or steam supply to the interior of pressure element, which has lower initial temperature. Next, CFD calculation of the flowing medium in <b>power</b> <b>block</b> element will be presented. The calculated heat transfer coefficient will be compared with the values determined by methods for solving an inverse heat conduction problem [3]...|$|R
