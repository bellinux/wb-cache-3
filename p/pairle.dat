[...] While the gyrons of gyronny almost invariably meet in the fess point (the exact centre of the shield) [...] of the University of Zululand are an unusual example of gyronny meeting in the nombril point (a point on the shield midway between the fess point and the base point). Gyronny can be modified by (most of) the lines of partition (there would be exceptions such as dancetty and angled).|$|E

50|$|The {{coat of arms}} can be {{described}} as follows: Or, a pale and a chief Azure.

Both supporters are placed on a grassy mount from which {{at the base of the}} shield three wavy streams in <b>pairle</b> reversed Argent each surcharged with another Azure flow into a barry wavy ‘lakefront', below which is placed a scroll with the motto Diversity Our Strength between two maple leaves Gules, veined Or, at the extremities of the scroll.|$|E
50|$|The arms of Heston and Isleworth {{were granted}} in 1932. They were: Tierced in <b>pairle</b> Azure, Sable and gules in chief two wings {{conjoined}} argent to the dexter a cross bottonée or {{and to the}} sinister a lion rampant guardant per fesse of the last and or the fourth. The motto was 'UNITATE FORTIOR' (Latin: Stronger by union).The silver wings on blue referred to Heston Aerodrome. The gold cross bottony came from the seal of the Monastery of St. Saviour and St. Brigit of Syon, founded in 1416 at Twickenham by King Henry V {{and moved to the}} site on which Syon House now stands circa 1431. The gold and silver lion came from the arms of Hounslow Priory, founded in the thirteenth century by the Trinitarian Brothers of Redemption, on the site now occupied by Holy Trinity Church. The motto referred to the union of the two formerly separate parishes of Heston and Isleworth.|$|E
5000|$|Shields {{may also}} be divided into three parts: this is called tierced, as in tierced per pale, azure, argent and gules (though perhaps in English {{heraldry}} this is rarely if ever done, and the foregoing shield would be blazoned — as the pale {{is supposed to be}} one-third of the width of the field and is always so depicted under these circumstances — per pale azure and gules, a pale argent. but Scottish heraldry does use 'tierced in pale' (e.g. Clackmannan county (now Clackmannanshire) has Or; a saltire gules; a chief tierced in pale vert, argent, vert ...) [...] A particular type of tiercing, resembling a Y in shape (division lines per bend and bend sinister coming down from the chief, meeting at the fess point, and continuing down per pale), is called per pall (also per <b>pairle).</b> The arms of Pope Benedict XVI is [...] "tierced in mantle" [...] - as described in Vatican information pages, but the usual term in, for example South African heraldry, is chapé ployé (with arched lines, with straight lines: chapé (mantled)), which may be blazoned with three tinctures or just two - e.g. Okakarara Technical Institute: Gules, chapé Azure, on the partition lines respectively a bend and a bend sinister enhanced, in base a demi-cogwheel, Or, with a fountain issuant. Shields {{may also be}} divided into three parts by a combination of two methods of division, such as party per fess, in chief per pale. Another example is in the arms of Clive Cheesman: per pale and per pall. [...] This is to be distinguished from the essentially unique partition in the arms of the 2nd Weather Group of the United States Air Force, which is [...] "Dexter per chevron ployé and sinister per fess enhanced." ...|$|E
