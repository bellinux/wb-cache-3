She got them from the shelf; and as he went over them she heard him repeating the names of various goods now become familiar, <b>pongees,</b> poplins, percales and voiles, garbardines and galateas, lawns, organdies, crepes, and Madras shirtings, while he wrote down figures on a sheet of paper. So complete was his absorption in this task that Janet, although she had resented the insinuating pressure of his former attitude toward her, felt a paradoxical sensation of jealousy. Presently, without looking up, he told her to call up the Boston office and ask for Mr. Fraile, the cotton buyer; and she learned from the talk over the telephone though it was mostly about [...] "futures"--that Ditmar had lingered for a conference in Boston on his way back from New York. Afterwards, having dictated two telegrams which she wrote out on her machine, {{he leaned back in his}} chair; and though the business for the day was ended, showed a desire to detain her. His mood became communicative.|$|R

60|$|The {{decision}} for the blue <b>pongee</b> {{was the culmination of}} a struggle begun with the opening of her eyes that morning. It was Sunday, and the time was at hand when she must face the world. Might it not be delayed a little while--a week longer? For the remembrance of the staring eyes which had greeted her on her arrival at the station at Grenoble troubled her. It seemed to her a cruel thing that the house of God should hold such terrors for her: to-day she had a longing for it that she had never felt in her life before.|$|E

Miss Drexel, seized by {{inspiration}} or desperation, with a quick movement stripped off her short, corduroy tramping-skirt, and, looking very lithe and boyish in slender-cut <b>pongee</b> bloomers, ran along the sand and dropped the skirt for a foothold for the slowly revolving wheels. Almost, but not quite, did the car stop, then, gathering way, with the others running alongside and shoving, it emerged on the hard road.|$|E
6000|$|He {{stood for}} a few moments looking at her in silence. She had on the dress which he loved so much, a silver-grey merino skirt and jacket, with a blouse of white <b>pongee</b> silk showing in front. Some lighter {{coloured}} trimming fringed the cloth. She wore a grey toque, with a dash of white at the side, and a white veil which softened without concealing the dark brown curls and fresh girlish face beneath it. Her gloves were of grey suede, and the two little pointed tan shoes peeping from the edge of her skirt were the only touches of a darker tint in her attire. Crosse had the hereditary artist's eye, and he could only stand and stare and enjoy it. He was filled with admiration, with reverence, and with wonder that this perfect thing should really proclaim itself to be all his own. Whatever had he done, or could he do, to deserve it? ...|$|E

50|$|<b>Pongee</b> is a soft thin woven cloth. In {{the early}} 20th century, <b>pongee</b> was an {{important}} export from China to the United States. <b>Pongee</b> is still woven in silk by many mills across China, especially {{along the banks of}} the Yangtze at mills in Sichuan, Anhui, Zhejiang and Jiangsu provinces. Generally it varies in weight from 36 to about 50gm/sq m. In lighter variants, it is called Paj. It is used as a blouse weight or lining silk.|$|E

After being held up by Fallon in the early running she began to make {{progress}} at half way and took the lead more than three furlongs from the finish. In the closing stages she drew away from her rivals to win by eleven lengths from <b>Pongee</b> who took second ahead of Hazarista. The BBC described her performance as [...] "hugely [...] ". After the race Stoute indicated that the filly might well take on colts in the classic St Leger, saying [...] "She's a very progressive filly.

50|$|Like other volunteers {{during the}} war, {{especially}} the Red Cross and the Salvation Army, Library War Service librarians wore uniforms while performing their duties. There were separate uniforms for camp librarians and hospital librarians, {{as well as}} separate uniforms for men and women. Camp librarians wore a forest green uniform, similar to a military uniform, with ALA pins and patches that marked the wearer as a War Service librarian. Female librarians working in hospital libraries had a unique uniform of naturally colored <b>pongee.</b>|$|E

40|$|From the 1920 s {{through the}} 1960 s, the {{animation}} industry was a labor force segregated by gender, {{in which women}} were almost entirely restricted to the Inking and Paint department. Indeed, despite notable exceptions like Mary Blair and LaVerne Harding, Disney correspondence and internal papers show how women were regularly rejected as applicants or referred to inking and painting as their only career options. [1] One of the final steps in a Taylorized labor intensive industrial machine of specialized labor, the Ink and Paint Dept. usually consisted of several hundred female workers[2] in each animated studio, wearing white gloves (with thumb and two fingers cut off) and <b>pongee</b> smocks (to keep cels free from dust). After cleaned up pencil drawings were received from animators, inkers used the finest Gillott 290 nibs to make precise small, medium or large black (and sometimes color) lines around those drawings. Painters would then flip the nitrate cels and color in the inked outlines, following numbered specifications from a model sheet created by the Color Key Artist who selected colors for characters and props (Furniss, p. 74). They worked on raked boards (as inkers) or flat boards (as painters) producing 8 - 10 cels an hour (Zohn 2010, p. 289), enduring the lowest pay in the industry, while supervisors like Dot Smith would {{walk up and down}} the aisles at Disney urging them to work faster and faster with phrases like “Come on now, quick– like a bunny!” (Baldwin, 1995, p. 4) This paper examines the relationship of color, labor and gender in the Ink and Paint machine with a particular focus on the material representation of paints, pigments, inks and other color materials in classical cel production...|$|E
40|$|Hiram Royal Mallinson, {{an ambitious}} and talented son of mid-nineteenth-century {{immigrants}} from Poland, entered the silk trade in 1893 as a salesman {{for the company}} of Pelgram 2 ̆ 6 Meyer in Paterson, New Jersey. Just two years later Mallinson joined a new firm, Newwitter 2 ̆ 6 Migel, headquartered in New York City, as head of sales. In 1900, Migel and Mallinson bought out Newwitter and renamed the firm M. C. Migel 2 ̆ 6 Co. Migel and Mallinson consciously targeted the novelty market and the high-end or “class” customer generally conceded to European concerns at the time. The company was regarded as progressive, its output of excellent quality and a credit to the American industry. Migel retired from active participation in the firm in 1903, leaving Mallinson in charge—a position he maintained until 1931. His company’s long-term success within a turbulent industry was founded on a solid reputation for quality silks and, perhaps more importantly, on marketing practices not yet common in his day: buying or generating the right publicity, cultivating all potential consumers, and anticipating— even creating—consumer demand for novelty. Until 1913, M. C. Migel 2 ̆ 6 Co. concentrated primarily on woven textures and jacquardwoven designs. In the years between 1900 and 1913, the firm offered many innovative fabrics, such as “Waterette” waterproof taffeta, “Motora” <b>pongee</b> for the emerging motorist market, and “Madame Butterfly” marquisette. All competed against the luxury imports from Europe and the few other high-end American products. The company’s printed silks kept to prevailing Paris fashions, usually in simple color combinations that suited the relative lack of skill within the American silk-printing industry at this time. In November 1912, Migel sold {{his interest in the}} company to Mallinson. In early 1914, Mallinson stepped up his campaign against European competitors, introducing the Mexixe line of printed silks. [fig. 1] This series took advantage of Mexico’s prominence in the news due to the American war against Pancho Villa. The designs were based on Aztec, Mexican, and American Indian art, and although they were certainly influenced by European aesthetics, the underlying theme was an American original, not a variation on a French idea. The printing, in multiple colors on saturated grounds, challenged European supremacy in that art. The fabrics were used by several Paris couturiers, endorsing this upstart American attempt at original design. It was a stunning critical and sales success for the company and a notable first for the American industry. In its wake, Mallinson changed the company’s name to his own in January 1915...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2015 University of Washington Abstract Betel Use in Pregnancy Sahira Khalid Chair of the Supervisory Committee: Peter Milgrom, Professor Oral Health Sciences Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study is to pilot test a short questionnaire, which will gain {{information}} on pregnant women’s views on the risks associated with using betel nut, and to establish the questionnaire’s internal consistency and concurrent validity, which will be done by relating it to the developed craving scale. Study setting: This study was conducted at a <b>Pongee</b> State Hospital, Maternal and Child Department, Federated States of Micronesia. Participants were receiving prenatal care. Methods: This is a convenience sample. Members of the Dental Department staff confidentially administered the surveys in May and July 2015. Independent samples t-test was used to find difference between the mean number of betel nut users who also used tobacco and those who did not use tobacco with their betel nut use in terms of their responses on the dependence symptom scale (craving scale). Spearman’s rank correlation was used to test for a relationship between the dependence symptom scores and health risk beliefs assessment scores for betel nut users who used betel nut at some point in their lives. Chi-square test of association was used to test for association between the level of education of the respondents and their betel nut use (chewers or non-chewers) and to test for association between their betel nut use and whether they smoked or not during pregnancy, alcohol use, and substance abuse. Results: In this study, 80 % of the 55 respondents had ever used betel. More than one sixth of all users (14. 7 %) used betel in the previous month, and 26 (76. 5 %) also used tobacco with the betel. Although not statistically significant, the mean (± SD) dependence symptom scale score among users who also used tobacco from cigarette was 8. 25 ± 0. 822 versus 6. 00 ± 2. 00 among those who used betel nut alone (t (22) = - 0. 8, p = 0. 432). The dependency score was positively but not significantly associated with frequency of tobacco use (e. g., mean (SD) = 11 ± 1. 761) among most frequent users versus a mean (SD) = 9. 14 ± 0. 688 among the never users [F(3, 28) = 1. 968, p = 0. 142) ]. 83. 3 % of the users who did not believe that after the birth of a child, it is safe for a new mom to chew betel nut also agreed or strongly agreed that encouragement should be given to pregnant women so that they stop chewing betel nut (χ 2 = 13. 698, p < 0. 05). 88 % of the users who did not believe that after the birth of a child, it is safe for a new mom to chew betel nut also agreed or strongly agreed that more help should be given to pregnant women who want stop chewing betel nut (χ 2 = 18. 429, p < 0. 05). There was no significant relationship found between the craving scale and the health risk belief assessment scale for both, users who had ever used betel (ρ = - 0. 240, p = 0. 238) and who used betel within the past 30 days using Spearman’s rank correlation (ρ = - 0. 394, p = 0. 085). Conclusion: Dependence was observed in pregnant betel users who also chewed tobacco versus those who used betel nut alone. The beliefs which prompted the pregnant women to chew are: to reduce morning sickness/nausea, for relief and relaxation, to avoid having a smelly mouth, and to prevent them from feeling tired or to work for a longer time. The health belief scale and craving were 80 % reliable and had high internal consistency, and the items in the questionnaire are well inter-correlated. There was no significant relationship found between the craving scale and the health risk belief assessment scale for both, users who had ever used betel (ρ = - 0. 240, p = 0. 238) and who used betel within the past 30 days using Spearman’s rank correlation (ρ = - 0. 394, p = 0. 085). Additional studies are required to corroborate the data of this preliminary study and develop effective betel nut cessation intervention program. One possible next step is the collection of samples tied to birth records, examining pregnancy outcomes more thoroughly. Future studies should also involve adolescents or parents who are introducing betel to young children...|$|E
