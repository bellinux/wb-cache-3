25|$|Since 1998, the DNA <b>profiling</b> <b>system</b> {{supported}} by The National DNA Database in the UK is the SGM+ DNA <b>profiling</b> <b>system</b> that includes 10 STR regions and a sex-indicating test. STRs do not suffer from such subjectivity and provide similar {{power of discrimination}} (1 in 1013 for unrelated individuals if using a full SGM+ profile). Figures of this magnitude are {{not considered to be}} statistically supportable by scientists in the UK; for unrelated individuals with full matching DNA profiles a match probability of 1 in a billion is considered statistically supportable. However, with any DNA technique, the cautious juror should not convict on genetic fingerprint evidence alone if other factors raise doubt. Contamination with other evidence (secondary transfer) is a key source of incorrect DNA profiles and raising doubts as to whether a sample has been adulterated is a favorite defense technique. More rarely, chimerism is one such instance where the lack of a genetic match may unfairly exclude a suspect.|$|E

This paper {{describes}} one {{realization of}} the attribute inheritance mechanism in specific CAD/CAM software package supporting the design and manufacturing of the facade carpentry.

Each entity in the <b>profile</b> <b>system</b> is described by arbitrary number of attributes and each attribute has its own type and momentary value from the list of possible values. Frequent repetition of the same attributes has been noticed within the hierarchically organized data which impedes the change of value of typical attributes resulting in extending the necessary space for storing data. The suggested attribute inheritance mechanism should solve these problems...|$|R

A pre-evacuated 2 L glass flask was connected to the discharge of an Infrared Gas Analyzer (IRGA) of the <b>profile</b> <b>system</b> so that airs with known concentration of H 2 O and CO 2 can be sampled. To test the performance of this sampling system, we sampled airs from 8 levels (from 0. 1 to 40 m) at the KoFlux tower of Gwangneung deciduous forest, Korea. Air samples in the 2 L flask were separated into its component gases and pure H 2 O and CO 2 were extracted by using a vacuum extraction line. This novel technique successfully produced vertical profiles of δD of H 2 O and...|$|R

Objective: The objective of this research was to study the occurrence of the apical deviation ofcurved root canals instrumented with a manual technique and tworotary <b>systems</b> (<b>Profile</b> and Race). Material and methods: Thirty mesiovestibular canals of inferior molars were used; they were divided into three groups and instrumented with the mixed technique defended by Holland et al. (1991), with the <b>Profile</b> <b>system</b> and with the Race system. For the evaluation of apical deviation the radiographic platform method developed by Sydney et al. (1991) was used, which allows to obtain overlapped images of the first and the last instrument used in the root canal preparation in the same x-ray. Results: The analysis of the results showed that there is no statistically significant difference among the three groups in their relation to the amount of deviated canals; however, when the quality of the deviation is evaluated, there is a significant difference only between group 1 (manual technique) and group 2 (<b>Profile</b> <b>system).</b> Conclusion: When the deviation occurred, it was ignificantlysmaller in the group instrumented with the <b>Profile</b> <b>system...</b>|$|R
