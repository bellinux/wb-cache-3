5|$|The genetic {{heritability}} of Alzheimer's disease (and memory components thereof), {{based on}} reviews of twin and family studies, ranges from 49% to 79%. Around 0.1% {{of the cases}} are familial forms of autosomal (not sex-linked) dominant inheritance, which have an onset before age 65. This form of the disease is known as early onset familial Alzheimer's disease. Most of autosomal dominant familial AD {{can be attributed to}} mutations in one of three genes: those encoding amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilins 1 and 2. Most mutations in the APP and <b>presenilin</b> genes increase the production of a small protein called Aβ42, which is the main component of senile plaques. Some of the mutations merely alter the ratio between Aβ42 and the other major forms—particularly Aβ40—without increasing Aβ42 levels.|$|E
25|$|The gamma secretase complex {{consists}} of four individual proteins: PSEN1 (presenilin-1), nicastrin, APH-1 (anterior pharynx-defective 1), and PEN-2 (<b>presenilin</b> enhancer 2). Recent evidence suggests that a fifth protein, known as CD147, is a non-essential regulator of the complex whose absence increases activity. <b>Presenilin,</b> an aspartyl protease, is the catalytic subunit; mutations in the <b>presenilin</b> gene {{have been shown to}} be a major genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. In humans, two forms of <b>presenilin</b> and two forms of APH-1 have been identified in the genome; one of the APH homologs can also be expressed in two isoforms via alternative splicing, leading to at least six different possible gamma secretase complexes that may have tissue- or cell type specificity.|$|E
25|$|The {{proteins}} in the gamma secretase complex are heavily modified by proteolysis during assembly and maturation of the complex; a required activation step {{is in the}} autocatalytic cleavage of <b>presenilin</b> to N- and C-terminal fragments.

2500|$|The gamma secretase {{complex is}} unusual among proteases {{in having a}} [...] "sloppy" [...] {{cleavage}} site at the C-terminal site in amyloid beta generation; gamma secretase can cleave APP in any of multiple sites to generate a peptide of variable length, most typically from 39 to 42 amino acids long, with Aβ40 the most common isoform and Aβ42 the most susceptible to conformational changes leading to amyloid fibrillogenesis. Certain mutations in both APP and in both types of human <b>presenilin</b> are associated with increased Aβ42 production and the early-onset genetic form of familial Alzheimer's disease.
