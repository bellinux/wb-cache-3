40|$|In {{response}} to farmer requests after milk from their herds {{was rejected by}} processors due to poor quality, a study was carried out from April to October 2011 to determine the prevalence of sub clinical mastitis, associated risk factors and causative micro-organisms. Samples were collected from 195 dairy cows on 23 randomly selected dairy farms delivering milk to Isangano, Kirebe and Nyagatare milk collection centres in Nyagatare District, Rwanda. The Draminski ® Mastitis Detector was used to detect sub clinical mastitis in individual cows based on milk electrical conductivity changes. Risk factors for mastitis that were evaluated included teat-end condition, cow dirtiness, breed, parity, age and stage of lactation. Relationships of these factors with mastitis status were determined using Chi-square analysis, and relative importance as causes of mastitis was assessed using logistic regression. Samples from 16 sub clinical mastitis positive dairy cows were analysed to identify causative micro-organisms using Dairy Quality Control Inspection analytical kits. Sub clinical mastitis prevalence was 52 % across the farms. It was higher with increases in, amongst other risk factors, teat-end damage severity, cow dirtiness, and level of <b>pure</b> <b>dairy</b> <b>breed</b> genetics. The risk factors considered accounted for 62 % of mastitis prevalence; teat-end condition alone accounted for 30 %. Most of the mastitis cases (87. 5 %) were caused by coliform bacteria. Considering that farmers are upgrading their local Ankole cows to cross-breed dairy cows that {{are more susceptible to}} mastitis, results from this study indicate the need to dip the teats of cows in sanitisers, improve cow hygiene, and introduce mastitis prevention and control programmes...|$|E
40|$|About 80 % of Albanian {{small scale}} farms farming 1 - 2 dairy cows. The small {{agriculture}} land surface on farm property (1 - 1, 5 ha) {{is the main}} limiting factor for cow’s number increasing. So the farmer interest is not to {{increasing the number of}} cows in their farm but to fattening of calf’s born both for nutritive need of the family and market. The main objective {{of the study was to}} show the effect of industrial crosses (F 1) of Holstein Frison cows with meat breeds like as Piementese(P), Limousine(L), Kianina(C), Sharole(Sh) and Markixhana(M) on meat production increasing on small scale farms. To carried out this objective, two study methods were used: (i) The survey - 284 small scale farms was observed in the Albanian coastal field and (ii) Comparative essay of fattening calves (F 1) in semi intensive small scale farm condition - 32 calves, F 1 crosses of Holstein cows with above mentioned meat breeds were put in fattening in semi intensive small scale farm condition. 6 Holstein breed (H) calves of 3 - 4 months age was used as control group. The feeding of animals was based on forages produced in farm: corn silage 30 % D. M, fresh alpha-alpha and its hay. 35 % of dry matter requirements were supplied by bought concentrate feedstuffs with 15 % crude protein on dry matter bases. The fattening period lasted 8 months. The average daily body weight increasing for each crosses and control group were respectively 889 g (PxH), 998 g (LxH), 850 g (KxH), 1010 g(ChxH), 953 g (MxH) and 702 g (HxH). Multivariate analyses according to a linear model with constant factors (genotype, sex, genotype x sex) and covariance “live body weight in the beginning of experiment” showed that: (i) The effect of crossbreds on average daily gain is evident under the small-scale farms conditions, also, (ii) The average daily gain increases with 23 - 38 %, depending on the type of crosses, (iii) The crosses of dairy cattle with Limousine and Sharole result as most effective. The differences between F 1 crosses of Markigiana, Kianine and Piemonteze are not statistically significant, (iv) In semi intensive small scale farms the calf fattening can start from second month of life, (v) The farmers even though small scale farm condition can produce more meat though the crossing of dairy cattle with meat breeds in comparison with <b>pure</b> <b>dairy</b> <b>breed</b> calves...|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the ratio of lactose to milk oligosaccharides in mammalian milk/colostrum is based on the ratio of expression of a-lactalbumin and glycosyltransferases in the mammary epithelial cells. It has also been suggested that the high secretion of milk in <b>dairy</b> <b>breed</b> cows has been acquired by a high expression of a-lactalbumin expression. As there is a large difference of milk secretion level between dairy and non <b>dairy</b> <b>breed</b> cows, there may be a difference in the ratio of lactose to milk oligosaccharides in milks between dairy and non <b>dairy</b> <b>breed</b> cows. In this study, the concentrations of hexose, sialic acid as well as sialyllactoses, which are representative bovine milk oligosaccharides, were determined in the milks of dairy and non <b>dairy</b> <b>breed</b> cows. The concentration of hexose was significantly higher in the milks of non <b>dairy</b> <b>breed</b> cows than that of <b>dairy</b> <b>breed</b> cows, but {{there were no significant differences}} with respect to sialic acid and sialyllactose.

40|$|This {{experiment}} {{aimed to}} describe the influence of production system on the following characteristics from seven Spanish goat breeds: carcass weight, dressing percentage, head weight, viscera weight, kidney fat weight, fatness score, carcass length, leg length, rump perimeter, rump width, kidney fat colour and tissue composition of shoulder. Experiment involved 201 male, single-birth suckling kids from five meat and two <b>dairy</b> <b>breeds.</b> Animals from meat breeds were slaughtered at two targets carcass weights (light, 4 kg; heavy, 7 kg). In <b>dairy</b> <b>breeds,</b> half of the animals were reared with dam’s milk {{and the other half}} with a milk replacer and all of them were slaughtered at light weight (4 kg).

40|$|A {{conceptual}} framework for evaluating cross-breeding programmes in sub-Saharan Africa is developed based on a Kenyan case study. It depicts livestock production as a system where farm animals, plants, land and water are interlinked in particular ways and are also interlinked with the environment. Depending {{on the level of}} intensification and `modernisation', two livestock systems are defined. The first is the traditional livestock production system in which farm animals, plants, land and water are interlinked in a sustainable way with each component complementing the other. The second is a'modern' production system based on crossbreds with varying levels of exotic <b>dairy</b> cattle <b>breeds</b> or <b>pure</b> exotic <b>dairy</b> cattle <b>breeds.</b> Successful cross-breeding not only weakens the interlinkages in the traditional system, but also creates new linkages with external inputs. It is argued that the weakened existing and the newly formed linkages ought {{to be taken into account}} when cross-breeding programmes are being evaluated. To accurately evaluate cross-breeding programmes it is, therefore, important to delineate all the outputs and inputs of such a system. In this Report, the outputs and inputs of cattle cross-breeding programmes are defined. Outputs include the marketable products of milk, meat, manure, animal draft power, hides and skins. Inputs include the conventional ones such as research infrastructure, equipment and personnel, extension services, disease control services, exotic germplasm, indigenous germplasm, feeds and marketing infrastructure. Cross-breeding also entails loss of the non-marketed outputs and values of indigenous livestock, such as cultural value, wealth function, existence value, option value and recreation value. An attempt was made to demonstrate the applicability of the developed {{conceptual framework}} using the case of cross-breeding Zebu cattle with exotic <b>breeds</b> for <b>dairy</b> improvement in Kenya. Due to time and resource constraints, already existing models that were not specifically developed for the task envisaged in the conceptual framework were applied in the analysis. Some important variables could not be included in the analysis due to data and model limitations. Welfare effects of cross-breeding programmes were estimated using the Kenya Agricultural Sector Model (ASM). The impact of cross-breeding at the farm level was analysed using the Farm Level Income and Policy Simulation Model (FLIPSIM). The two models were developed by the Impact Assessment Group (2000) of Texas A&M University, USA, and applied to evaluate the impact of improved dairy technologies in Kenya in collaboration with the Kenya Agricultural Research Institute (KARI) and the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI). In this study, these models were used specifically to provide estimates of the economic benefits of crossbreeding indigenous Zebu cattle with exotic <b>dairy</b> <b>breeds.</b> Despite the data and model limitations, the analyses provided useful insights into the benefits and costs of breeding programmes in Kenya...|$|R

40|$|Over 90 % of beef {{produced}} in Finland is generated as {{a by-product of}} milk production with <b>dairy</b> <b>breed</b> animals, the majority of which are pure-bred Finnish Ayrshires.
