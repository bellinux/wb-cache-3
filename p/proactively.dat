5|$|Grant was {{vigorous}} in his {{enforcement of}} the 14th and 15th amendments and prosecuted thousands of persons who violated African American civil rights; he used military force to put down political insurrections in Louisiana, Mississippi, and South Carolina. He <b>proactively</b> used military and Justice Department enforcement of civil rights laws {{and the protection of}} African Americans more than any other 19th century president. He used his full powers to weaken the Ku Klux Klan, reducing violence and intimidation in the South. He appointed James Milton Turner as the first African American minister to a foreign nation. Grant's relationship with Charles Sumner, the leader in promoting civil rights, was shattered by the Senator's opposition to Grant's plan to acquire Santo Domingo by treaty. Grant retaliated, firing men Sumner had recommended and having allies strip Sumner of his chairmanship of the Foreign Relations Committee. Sumner joined the Liberal Republican movement in 1872 to fight Grant's reelection.|$|E
5|$|Service design {{management}} {{deals with the}} newly emerging field of service design. It is the activity of planning and organizing people, infrastructure, communication, and material components of a service. The aim {{is to improve the}} quality of the service, the interaction between the service provider and its customers, and the customer's experience. The increasing importance and size of the service sector in terms of people employed and economic importance requires that services should be well-designed in order to remain competitive and to continue to attract customers. Design management traditionally focuses in the design and development of manufactured products; service design managers can apply many of the same theoretical and methodological approaches. Systematic and strategic management of service design helps the business gain competitive advantages and conquer new markets. Companies that <b>proactively</b> identify the interests of their customers and use this information to develop services that create good experiences for the customer will open up new and profitable business opportunities.|$|E

25|$|Some of {{the issues}} that {{learning}} organizations were designed to address within institutions is fragmentation, competition and reactiveness. Fragmentation is described as breaking a problem into pieces. For example, each organization has an accounting department, finance, operations, IT and marketing. Competition occurs when employees are trying to do better or 'beat' others in an assignment instead of collaborating. Reactiveness occurs when an organization changes only in reaction to outside forces, rather than <b>proactively</b> initiating change.|$|E
25|$|Community {{policing}} {{is also a}} large element {{within the}} country of Syria. Citizens in Syria began using cyber community policing tactics via social media {{as a way to}} address the conflict happening around them. Doing so has given them some power to influence change in their environment. Their efforts demonstrate that global cyber community policing programs have the ability to connect communities and create social media networks that can effectively and <b>proactively</b> address, and hopefully prevent, threats to its citizens.|$|E

The aim of Street Pastors is not to <b>proactively</b> preach or evangelise, but to provide a neutral and reassuring presence in local communities.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the end of}} the Vietnam War, {{also known}} as the Vietnam Conflict and Second Indochina War, the United States was {{involved}} in a number of smaller conflicts during {{the end of the}} Cold War, including in Grenada, Panama, and elsewhere. In the Post-Cold War, the United States was involved in conflicts in the Middle East, Africa, the Caribbean, and in the Balkans. No Medals of Honor have been awarded for any of the aforementioned conflicts so far either <b>proactively</b> or retroactively.|$|E
25|$|Malcolm X {{returned}} from Mecca with moderate views that included an abandonment of {{his commitment to}} racial separatism. However, he still supported black nationalism and advocated that African Americans in the United States act <b>proactively</b> in their campaign for equal human rights, instead of relying on Caucasian citizens to change the laws that govern society. The tenets of Malcolm X's new philosophy are articulated in the charter of his Organization of Afro-American Unity (a secular Pan-Africanist group patterned after the Organization of African Unity), and he inspired {{some aspects of the}} future Black Panther movement.|$|E
25|$|In 2017, Mayor Sly James re-initiated the {{conversation}} for Kansas City's potential new terminal. Local design form Burns & McDonnell <b>proactively</b> proposed a privately funded option {{that would not}} require new public taxes. (Even if not privately funded, airport reconstruction would {{be paid for by}} takeoff and landing fees generated by the airport, not a separate tax initiative). Initially Burns & McDonnell were the only firm to present a privately funded option. In June 2017, Airport design firm AECOM also approached Kansas City to advise they would also submit a privately funded proposal. On July 18th 2017, two new teams emerged to submit proposals to the city for a new terminal.|$|E
25|$|Fear of {{subversion}} {{was widespread}} throughout the state. In West and Middle Tennessee it was fear of pro-Union activism, which was countered <b>proactively</b> by numerous local Committees of Safety and Vigilance from 1860 to 1862. They emerged {{as early as}} the 1860 Presidential election, and when the war began activists developed an aggressive program to detect and suppress Unionists. The committees set up a spy system, intercepted mail, inspected luggage, forced the enlistment of men into the Confederate Army, confiscated private property, and whenever it seemed necessary lynched enemies of the Confederacy. The committees were disbanded by the Union Army when it took control in 1862.|$|E
25|$|John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore, {{originally}} from Scotland, was the royal {{governor of the}} Colony of Virginia from 1771 to 1775. During his tenure, he worked <b>proactively</b> to extend Virginia's western borders past the Appalachian Mountains, despite the British Royal Proclamation of 1763. He notably defeated the Shawnee nation in Dunmore's War, gaining land south of the Ohio River. As a widespread dislike for the British crown (as {{a result of the}} American Revolution) became apparent, however, Dunmore changed his attitude towards the colonists; he became frustrated with the lack of respect towards the British Crown. Dunmore's popularity worsened after, following orders, he attempted to prevent the election of representatives to the Second Continental Congress.|$|E
25|$|When the Soviet Union invaded, Rydz-ÅšmigÅ‚y was {{initially}} inclined {{to order the}} eastern border forces to resist, but was dissuaded by Prime Minister Felicjan SÅ‚awoj SkÅ‚adkowski and President Ignacy MoÅ›cicki. At 04:00 on 17 September, Rydz-ÅšmigÅ‚y ordered the Polish troops to fall back, stipulating that they only engage Soviet troops in self-defense. However, the German invasion had severely damaged the Polish communication systems, causing command and control problems for the Polish forces. In the resulting confusion, clashes between Polish and Soviet forces occurred along the border. General Wilhelm Orlik-RÃ¼ckemann, who took command of the Border Protection Corps on 30 August, received no official directives after his appointment. As a result, he and his subordinates continued to engage Soviet forces <b>proactively,</b> before dissolving the group on 1 October.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to fostering conversation, KMG Ethiopia {{has taken an}} active role in pressing police to prosecute crimes such as bridal abduction. The practice has been illegal in Ethiopia since 2005, but in 2010 The Independent wrote that legal authorities outside the capital were loose in their application of law, with the first person to challenge her bridal abductionâ€”a 13-year-old who could not prove she had been a virgin {{at the time of her}} kidnappingâ€”being accused by her own defense attorney of inciting the rape. KMG has fostered support among women and men for victims, including persuading some to <b>proactively</b> intervene to prevent the act. According to The Independent, as of 2010 the rate of bridal abductions in the region had diminished by 90%.|$|E
25|$|When the FCC imposed its fin-syn {{rules in}} 1970, ABC <b>proactively</b> created two companies: Worldvision Enterprises as a {{syndication}} distributor, and ABC Circle Films as a production company. However, between the publication {{and implementation of}} these regulations, {{the separation of the}} network's catalog was made in 1973. The broadcast rights to pre-1973 productions were transferred to Worldvision, which became independent in the same year. The company has been sold several times since Paramount Television acquired it in 1999, and has most recently been absorbed into CBS Television Distribution, a unit of CBS Corporation. Nonetheless, Worldvision sold portions of its catalog, including the Ruby-Spears and Hanna-Barbera libraries, to Turner Broadcasting System in 1991. With Disney's 1996 purchase of ABC, ABC Circle Films was absorbed into Touchstone Television, a Disney subsidiary which in turn was renamed ABC Studios in 2007.|$|E

He <b>proactively</b> named himself general manager of the non-existent [...] "Seattle Kings" [...] in May 1972, and the next year the franchise gained the backing of entrepreneur Edward Nixon, brother of president Richard Nixon. However, McElhenny's plans fell through, as the Seattle Seahawks were founded in 1974.|$|E

[...] was known as Operation Kiso. [...] 39 individuals were named and ten of these <b>proactively</b> investigated; the school stated that it was assisting the police with their inquiries, and had instigated an action plan to review their safeguarding processes and procedures. [...] An Independent Schools Inspectorate report published in 2014 praised the school's current leadership, including its safeguarding provisions.|$|E
500|$|However, the {{alliance}} didn't automatically bring the Ottomans {{into the war}} as Germany had hoped. The literal wording of the treaty obligated Germany to oppose any foreign infringements on Ottoman territory (particularly by Russia) but only required that the Ottoman Empire assist Germany as per the latter's own terms with Austria-Hungary. Since Germany had <b>proactively</b> declared war on Russia several days before Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire was not compelled to join the conflict. Grand Vizier Said Halim Pasha and Finance Minister Djavid Bey were opposed to Ottoman involvement in the war and viewed {{the alliance}} as a passive agreement. Other Ottoman officials were hesitant to rush into an armed conflict following the disastrous First Balkan War, especially considering {{the possibility that the}} Balkan states might attack the Empire should it become belligerent.|$|E
500|$|A {{major theme}} of [...] "Box Cutter" [...] {{involves}} Walter's gradual change from an unwitting participant in a drug-dealing enterprise {{into a man}} more comfortable with {{a life of crime}} who embraces his darker side and becomes more <b>proactively</b> violent and dangerous. This development began during the latter episodes of the third season and would continue to be a major theme throughout the fourth season. The episode also introduced the ongoing theme of Jesse's moral decline and self guilt over his killing of Gale. Aaron Paul said of this, [...] "Jesse's much more raw this season. He's very distant, and he's turned to just utter chaos and destruction to keep his mind busy. When he's left alone in his own thoughts, that's when things can get kind of dangerous and scary for Jesse." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{major theme}} of [...] "Box Cutter", {{and the entire}} fourth season, {{involved}} Walter's gradual change into a darker character who becomes more <b>proactively</b> violent and dangerous. The episode also illustrates Jesse's moral decline and feelings of guilt over his killing of Gale, and Skyler's growing involvement in Walter's illegal activities. The episode received positive reviews, and was watched by 2.58 million households, according to Nielsen Media Research. Until the fifth-season premiere, [...] "Box Cutter" [...] was the most watched Breaking Bad episode in the series' history and the third-highest-rated season premiere for any AMC show, after the first two seasons' premieres of The Walking Dead. In 2012, Gilligan received the Writers Guild of America Award for Best Episodic Drama {{for his work on}} this episode. This marked his second win for individual work on Breaking Bad, along with his award from the pilot episode in 2009.|$|E
500|$|Different methods {{exist for}} {{more or less}} {{successful}} detection, prevention, correction or mitigation of the row hammer effect. [...] Tests show that simple ECC solutions, providing single-error correction and double-error detection (SECDED) capabilities, {{are not able to}} correct or detect all observed disturbance errors because some of them include more than two flipped bits per memory word. [...] A less effective solution is to introduce more frequent memory refreshing, with the refresh intervals shorter than the usual 64ms, but this technique results in higher power consumption and increased processing overhead; some vendors provide firmware updates that implement this type of mitigation. [...] One of the more complex prevention measures performs counter-based identification of frequently accessed memory rows and <b>proactively</b> refreshes their neighboring rows; another method issues additional infrequent random refreshes of memory rows neighboring the accessed rows regardless of their access frequency. [...] Research shows that these two prevention measures cause negligible performance impacts.|$|E
500|$|Direct {{negotiations}} between state {{governments and the}} Johnson administration ensued. As the summer wore on, administration officials began including assurances of the measure's limited scope with their demands for ratification. Johnson himself suggested directly to the governors of Mississippi and North Carolina that they could <b>proactively</b> control the allocation of rights to freedmen. Though Johnson obviously expected the freed people to enjoy at least some civil rights, including, as he specified, the right to testify in court, he wanted state lawmakers {{to know that the}} power to confer such rights would remain with the states. When South Carolina provisional governor Benjamin Franklin Perry objected to the scope of the amendment's enforcement clause, Secretary of State Seward responded by telegraph that in fact the second clause [...] "is really restraining in its effect, instead of enlarging the powers of Congress". White politicians throughout the South were concerned that Congress might cite the amendment's enforcement powers as a way to authorize black suffrage.|$|E

Lennon called the song one of Harrison's best: [...] "His mind and his music are clear. There is his innate talent, he brought that sound together." [...] Beatles biographer Bob Spitz described [...] "Something" [...] as a masterpiece, and [...] "an intensely stirring romantic ballad that would challenge 'Yesterday' and 'Michelle' {{as one of the}} most recognizable songs they ever produced". According to Kenneth Womack, [...] "Harrison comes into his own on Abbey Road... 'Here Comes the Sun' is matched â€“ indeed, surpassed â€“ only by 'Something', his crowning achievement". Inglis considered Abbey Road a turning point in Harrison's development as a songwriter and musician. He described Harrison's contributions to the LP as [...] "exquisite", declaring them equal to any previous Beatles songs. During the album's recording, Harrison asserted more creative control than before, <b>proactively</b> rejecting suggestions for changes to his music or lyrics, particularly from McCartney.|$|E
