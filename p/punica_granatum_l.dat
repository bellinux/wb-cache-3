The <b>Punica</b> <b>granatum</b> <b>L.</b> var. granatum (pomegranate) {{has been demonstrated}} to exert antitumor effects on various types of cancer cells. The present study aimed to evaluate the medicinal herbs <b>Punica</b> <b>granatum</b> <b>L.</b> var. spinosa (apple punice) that are native to Iran. This study was determined to test the possible cytotoxic activity and induction of apoptosis on human prostate cell lines. The effect of ethanol extracts of the herbs on the inhibition of cell proliferation was assessed by MTT colorimetric assay. PC 3 cell lines treated with the extracts were analyzed for the induction of apoptosis by cell death detection (ELISA) and TUNEL assay. Dye exclusion analysis was performed for viability rate. Our results demonstrated that the <b>Punica</b> <b>granatum</b> <b>L.</b> var. spinosa extract dose dependently suppressed the proliferation of PC 3 cells (IC 50 = 250. 21 µg/mL) when compared with a chemotherapeutic anticancer drug (Toxol) (Vesper Pharmaceuticals) with increased nucleosome production from apoptotic cells. The <b>Punica</b> <b>granatum</b> <b>L.</b> var. spinosa extract attenuated the human prostate cell proliferation in vitro possibly by inducing apoptosis.

40|$|Purpose: <b>Punica</b> <b>granatum</b> <b>L.</b> var. granatum (Pomegranate), an {{herbaceous}} plant found in Iran, The {{aim of this}} study was to investigate the cytotoxic effects, induction of apoptosis, and the mechanism of cell death of ethanol extract from <b>Punica</b> <b>granatum</b> <b>L.</b> var. spinosa on the mouse fi brosarcoma cell line, WEHI - 164. Methods: Various parts of the herbs were extracted from fruit using ethanol as the solvent, and the cytotoxicity and cell viability of the ethanolic extract were determined by the MTT assay. To determine whether necrosis or apoptosis is the predominant cause of cell death, cell death detection was performed using the ELISA method. The in duction of apoptosis was confirmed using the terminal de oxynucleotidyl transferase - (TdT -) mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay. Moreover, a sensitive immunoblotting technique was used to examine the production of Caspase - 3 and Bcl 2 proteins. Results : Our findings suggested that the ethalonic extract of <b>Punica</b> <b>granatum</b> <b>L.</b> var. spinosa altered cell morphology, decreased cell viability, suppressed cell proliferation and induced cell death in a time - and dose - dependent manner in WEHI - 164 cells (IC 50 = 229. 024 μg/ml), when compared to a chemotherapeutic anticancer drug, Toxol (Vesper Pharmaceuticals), with increased nucleosome production from apoptotic cells. Induction of apoptosis by the plant extract was proved by the decrease of pro - Caspase - 3 and Bcl 2 proteins and quantitatively confirmed by Immunoblotting analysis.
