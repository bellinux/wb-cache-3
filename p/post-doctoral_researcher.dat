25|$|Reporting at {{the annual}} meeting of the American Sociological Association (August 3, 2008), Becky Pettit, {{associate}} professor of sociology from the University of Washington and Bryan Sykes, a UW <b>post-doctoral</b> <b>researcher,</b> revealed that the mammoth increase in the United States's prison population since the 1970s is having profound demographic consequences that affect 1 in 50 Americans. Drawing data from a variety of sources that looked at prison and general populations, the researchers found that the boom in prison population is hiding lowered rates of fertility and increased rates of involuntary migration to rural areas and morbidity that is marked by a greater exposure to and risk of infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and HIV or AIDS.|$|E
25|$|Born to a {{prominent}} British Jewish family, Franklin was educated {{at a private}} day school at Norland Place in West London, Lindores School for Young Ladies in Sussex, and St Paul's Girls' School, London. Then she studied the Natural Sciences Tripos at Newnham College, Cambridge, from which she graduated in 1941. Earning a research fellowship, she joined the University of Cambridge physical chemistry laboratory under Ronald George Wreyford Norrish, who disappointed her for his lack of enthusiasm. Fortunately, the British Coal Utilisation Research Association (BCURA) offered her a research position in 1942, and started her work on coals. This helped her earn a Ph.D. in 1945. She went to Paris in 1947 as a chercheur (<b>post-doctoral</b> <b>researcher)</b> under Jacques Mering at the Laboratoire Central des Services Chimiques de l'Etat, where she became an accomplished X-ray crystallographer. She became a research associate at King's College London in 1951 and worked on X-ray diffraction studies, which would eventually facilitate the double helix theory of the DNA. In 1953, after two years, owing to disagreement with her director John Randall and more so with her colleague Maurice Wilkins, she was compelled to move to Birkbeck College. At Birkbeck, J. D. Bernal, chair of the physics department, offered her a separate research team. She died in 1958 {{at the age of}} 37 of ovarian cancer.|$|E

The study produced three concepts that we have labelled ‘research is exploring’, ‘research is building’ and ‘research is living’. This study is unusual in its focus on <b>post-doctoral</b> <b>researchers</b> and the use of metaphors to identify their conceptions of research...|$|R
