40|$|International audienceDespite {{extraordinary}} global {{progress in}} increasing coverage of antiretroviral treatment (ART), {{the majority of}} people needing ART currently are not receiving treatment. Both the number of people needing ART and the average ART price per patient-year are expected to increase in coming years, which will dramatically raise funding needs for ART. Several international organizations are using interventions in ART markets to decrease ART price or to improve ART quality, delivery and innovation, with the ultimate goal of improving population health. These organizations need to select those market interventions that are most likely to substantially affect population health outcomes (ex ante assessment) and to evaluate whether implemented interventions have improved health outcomes (ex <b>post</b> <b>assessment).</b> We develop a framework to structure ex ante and ex <b>post</b> <b>assessment</b> of the population health impact of market interventions, which is transmitted through effects in markets and health systems. Ex ante assessment should include evaluation of the safety and efficacy of the ART products whose markets will be affected by the intervention; theoretical consideration of the mechanisms through which the intervention will affect population health; and predictive modelling to estimate the potential population health impact of the intervention. For ex <b>post</b> <b>assessment,</b> analysts need to consider which outcomes to estimate empirically and which to model based on empirical findings and understanding of the economic and biological mechanisms along the causal pathway from market intervention to population health.

The seminar series {{was designed as a}} longitudinal team building experience to foster competency toward interprofessional collaborative practice.

Results Primarily reflecting the required attendance of the pharmacy and physician assistant students, 122 participants completed both assessments (89. 7 % response rate). Wilcoxon signed rank tests were conducted on the 19 RIPLS items. Contrary to the goals of the program, there was a statistically significant change on six of the nineteen items which should have theoretically improved.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{present study}} {{examined}} {{the effectiveness of a}} sub-stance abuse prevention program in preventing tobacco and alcohol use among elementary school students in grades 3 through 6. The prevention program teaches social resistance skills and general personal and social competence skills. Rates of substance use behavior, attitudes, knowl-edge, normative expectations, and related variables were examined among students (N = 1090) from 20 schools that were randomly assigned to ei-ther receive the prevention program (9 schools, n = 426) or serve as a control group (11 schools, n = 664). Data were analyzed at both the indi-vidual-level and school-level. Individual-level analyses controlling for gender, race, and family structure showed that intervention students re-ported less smoking in the past year, higher anti-drinking attitudes, in-creased substance use knowledge and skills-related knowledge, lower normative expectations for smoking and alcohol use, and higher self-es-teem at the <b>posttest</b> <b>assessment,</b> relative to control students.

40|$|The {{integration}} of the economic, social and environmental dimensions of agriculture in a holistic assessmentframework is essential to support the development of sustainable farming. Despite {{the fact that some}} sustainabilityassessment tools fulfil this condition, none of them is suitable for handling different assessmentsituations, especially considering diverse crop production systems – arable crops, fruits and vegetables – atdifferent stages of development – research-desk prototypes (ex ante assessment) or in-field applied croppingsystems (ex <b>post</b> <b>assessment).</b> The objective of this work is to explore the possibility of sharing a sustainabilityassessment framework that can be implemented on different objects for improving (i) the communicationamong the stakeholders involved in the development of sustainable farming and (ii) the action planning interms of research as well as policy making. In this respect, the adaptation of the qualitative sustainability assessment tool DEXiPM (i) from arable crops(Pelzer et al., 2012) to other production systems and (ii) from the ex ante to the ex <b>post</b> <b>assessment</b> has representeda valuable source of ideas. Regarding the first task, three groups of experts have analyzed and modifiedthe arable crop model in order to obtain suitable tools for assessing the sustainability of field vegetables,pomefruit orchards and grapevine systems. The majority of the modifications brought have involved theparts of the model ruled by technical and scientific knowledge (e. g. determining the fuel consumption), whilefew generic modifications have been brought to the part of the model that is ruled by stakeholder priorities(e. g. relevance of biodiversity in the environmental sustainability). Regarding the second task, the modelstructure has been modified case-by-case, according to the data available in ex <b>post</b> <b>assessment,</b> to integrateprecise quantitative indicators in the qualitative framework. Two case studies have illustrated different waysof joining qualitative and quantitative data to get the best compromise between assessment precision andcomprehensiveness. This work has provided the formalization of a sustainability assessment framework suitable for different assessmentsituations. This articulates (i) a fixed core of generic agricultural sustainability issues hierarchicallyorganized that can be weighted according to stakeholders’ priorities and (ii) a set of indicators that can be flexiblyestimated according to the assessment situation.
