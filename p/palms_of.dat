5|$|Sebaceous glands are {{microscopic}} exocrine glands in {{the skin}} that secrete an oily or waxy matter, called sebum, to lubricate and waterproof the skin and hair of mammals. In humans, they occur in the greatest number on the face and scalp, but also on {{all parts of the}} skin except the <b>palms</b> <b>of</b> the hands and soles of the feet. The type of secretion of the sebaceous glands is referred to as holocrine.|$|E

Later, Lucina freed the newborn Adonis from the tree.|$|E
5|$|Disagreement {{exists as}} to whether Attalea should be {{considered}} a single genus, or a group of related genera. In their 1996 Field Guide to the <b>Palms</b> <b>of</b> the Americas, Andrew Henderson, Gloria Galeano and Rodrigo Bernal combined all the species in the subtribe Attaleinae (as it was then defined) into a single genus, Attalea. In his 1999 Taxonomic Treatment of Palm Subtribe Attaleinae, American botanist Sidney F. Glassman divided the group into five genera—a more narrowly defined Attalea, Orbignya, Maximiliana, Scheelea and Ynesa. Rafäel Govaerts and John Dransfield recognised a single genus in their 2005 World Checklist of Palms, and Jean-Christophe Pintaud continued this usage in his 2008 review of the genus.|$|E

5|$|Ordinary {{smallpox}} generally {{produced a}} discrete rash, {{in which the}} pustules stood out on the skin separately. The distribution of the rash was densest on the face; denser on the extremities than on the trunk; and on the extremities, denser on the distal parts than on the proximal. The <b>palms</b> <b>of</b> the hands and soles of the feet {{were involved in the}} majority of cases. Sometimes, the blisters merged into sheets, forming a confluent rash, which began to detach the outer layers of skin from the underlying flesh. Patients with confluent smallpox often remained ill even after scabs have formed over all the lesions. In one case series, the case-fatality rate in confluent smallpox was 62 percent.|$|E
5|$|The {{paintings}} show {{a famous}} incident {{from the life}} of Saint Francis of Assisi, who is shown kneeling by a rock as he receives the stigmata of the crucified Christ on the <b>palms</b> <b>of</b> his hands and soles of his feet. Behind him are rock formations, shown in great detail, and a panoramic landscape that seems to relegate the figures to secondary importance. This treatment of Francis is the first such to appear in northern Renaissance art. The arguments attributing the works to van Eyck are circumstantial and based mainly on the style and quality of the panels. A later, third version is in the Museo del Prado in Madrid, but is weaker and strays significantly in tone and design.|$|E
5|$|Experts {{disagree}} {{about the number}} of species in the genus Attalea (broadly defined). In 1965, Dutch taxonomist Jan Gerard Wessels Boer estimated that there may be as many as 100 species in the genus. In their 1996 Field Guide to the <b>Palms</b> <b>of</b> the Americas Andrew Henderson and coauthors recognised 29 species in the genus, while Sidney Glassman recognised 65 species in his 1999 treatment of the group. Largely following Glassman's lead, Rafaël Govaerts and John Dransfield recognised 67 species in their 2005 World Checklist of Palms. An important element of this disagreement is the decision by Glassman to define species more narrowly than Henderson. As a result, what Henderson interpreted as variation within species, Glassman took as differences between morphologically similar species. This problem is {{complicated by the fact that}} many of these species are poorly represented in herbarium collections. The large size of the leaves, inflorescences and fruit of many Attalea species makes them difficult to collect. In addition, many important collections, including type specimen, have been lost or destroyed. Sparse or incomplete collections make it difficult to differentiate variation within a single species from variation between different species.|$|E
