5|$|If blood patches alone do {{not succeed}} in closing the dural tears, {{placement}} of <b>percutaneous</b> fibrin glue {{can be used in}} place of blood patching, raising the effectiveness of forming a clot and arresting CSF leakage.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, he {{designed}} the Racz catheter, a flexible, spring-wound catheter {{with a small}} fluoroscopic probe. In 1989, he developed epidural lysis of adhesions, {{sometimes referred to as}} <b>percutaneous</b> adhesiolysis, or simply the Racz procedure. It is a minimally invasive, <b>percutaneous</b> intervention for treating chronic spinal pain often due to scarring after post lumbar surgery syndrome, sometimes called failed back surgery, and also low-back and radicular pain from spinal stenosis, a disease of aging. The procedure is somewhat similar to an epidural and is used when conventional methods have failed. The Racz procedure may employ the use of a wire-bound catheter to mechanically break-up or dissolve scar tissue, also called epidural adhesions or fibrosis, which have formed around the nerve roots, and allows for local anesthetics, saline, and steroids to be injected into the affected area.|$|E
5|$|Several {{manufacturers}} market prepackaged cricothyrotomy kits, which enable one to {{use either}} a wire-guided <b>percutaneous</b> dilational (Seldinger) technique, or the classic surgical technique to insert a polyvinylchloride catheter through the cricothyroid membrane. The kits may be stocked in hospital emergency departments and operating suites, {{as well as}} ambulances and other selected pre-hospital settings.|$|E
5|$|Surgery, when {{considered}} {{necessary for}} {{diseases of the}} heart, can take place via an open operation or via small guidewires inserted via peripheral arteries ("percutaneous coronary intervention"). <b>Percutaneous</b> coronary intervention is usually used {{in the context of}} an acute coronary syndrome, and may be used to insert a stent.|$|E
5|$|After <b>percutaneous</b> {{coronary}} interventions (PCIs), such as {{the placement}} of a coronary artery stent, a U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality guideline recommends that aspirin be taken indefinitely. Frequently, aspirin is combined with an ADP receptor inhibitor, such as clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor to prevent blood clots. This is called dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT). United States and European Union guidelines disagree somewhat about how long, and for what indications this combined therapy should be continued after surgery. U.S. guidelines recommend DAPT for at least 12 months, while EU guidelines recommend DAPT for 6–12 months after a drug-eluting stent placement. However, they agree that aspirin be continued indefinitely after DAPT is complete.|$|E
5|$|Weight {{loss and}} eating {{difficulties}} due to dysphagia and other muscle discoordination are common, making nutrition management increasingly {{important as the}} disease advances. Thickening agents {{can be added to}} liquids as thicker fluids are easier and safer to swallow. Reminding the affected person to eat slowly and to take smaller pieces of food into the mouth may also be of use to prevent choking. If eating becomes too hazardous or uncomfortable, the option of using a <b>percutaneous</b> endoscopic gastrostomy is available. This is a feeding tube, permanently attached through the abdomen into the stomach, which reduces the risk of aspirating food and provides better nutritional management. Assessment and management by speech-language pathologists with experience in Huntington's disease is recommended.|$|E
25|$|In {{recognition}} of the focused training required by cardiologists to perform <b>percutaneous</b> coronary interventions and the rapid progression {{in the field of}} <b>percutaneous</b> coronary interventions, specialized fellowship training in the field of Interventional Cardiology was instituted in 1999.|$|E
25|$|<b>Percutaneous</b> closure is {{the method}} of choice in most centres.|$|E
25|$|<b>Percutaneous</b> ethanol {{injection}} (PEI) well tolerated, high RR {{in small}} (<3nbsp&cm) solitary tumors; as of 2005, no randomized trial comparing resection to <b>percutaneous</b> treatments; recurrence rates {{similar to those}} for postresection. However a comparative study found that local therapy can achieve a 5-year survival rate of around 60% for patients with small HCC.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} 2004, {{drug-eluting}} stents were used in nearly 80 percent of all <b>percutaneous</b> coronary interventions.|$|E
25|$|The {{treatment}} options for mitral stenosis include medical management, mitral valve replacement by surgery, and <b>percutaneous</b> mitral valvuloplasty by balloon catheter.|$|E
25|$|HCC, {{hepatocellular}} carcinoma; TACE, transarterial embolization/chemoembolization; PFS, progression-free survival; PS, performance status; HBV, hepatitis B virus; PEI, <b>percutaneous</b> ethanol injection; RFA, radiofrequency ablation; RR, response rate; MS, median survival.|$|E
25|$|In close {{cooperation}} with {{specialists in the}} orthopedic surgery, neurosurgery, and rehabilitation medicine departments, this center practices conventional open surgery as well as minimal invasive <b>percutaneous</b> surgery for spine-related diseases and trauma.|$|E
25|$|Soon after Andreas Gruentzig began {{performing}} <b>percutaneous</b> interventions {{on individuals}} with stable coronary artery disease, multiple groups described {{the use of}} catheter-delivered streptokinase {{for the treatment of}} acute myocardial infarction (heart attack).|$|E
25|$|Lung nodule <b>percutaneous</b> transthoracic needle biopsy: CBCT guides needle {{placement}} and demonstrated a diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 98.2%, 96.8%, and 100%, respectively. Diagnostic accuracy was unaffected by technically challenging conditions.|$|E
25|$|SEMS {{are also}} {{sometimes}} {{used in the}} vascular system, usually in the aorta and peripheral vascular system. In the past they {{have been used for}} saphenous vein graft and native coronary artery <b>percutaneous</b> coronary interventions.|$|E
25|$|Pseudoaneurysms can {{be caused}} by trauma that {{punctures}} the artery, such as knife and bullet wounds, as a result of <b>percutaneous</b> surgical procedures such as coronary angiography or arterial grafting, or use of an artery for injection.|$|E
25|$|Foetal haematocrit for the {{assessment}} of foetal anemia, Rh isoimmunization, or hydrops can be determined by <b>percutaneous</b> umbilical blood sampling (PUBS), which is done by placing a needle through the abdomen into the uterus and taking a portion of the umbilical cord.|$|E
25|$|From 24 to 34 {{weeks of}} gestation, when the fetus is {{typically}} viable, blood {{can be taken}} from the cord {{in order to test}} for abnormalities (particularly for hereditary conditions). This diagnostic genetic test procedure is known as <b>percutaneous</b> umbilical cord blood sampling.|$|E
25|$|The first <b>percutaneous</b> supraclavicular {{block was}} {{performed}} in 1911 by German surgeon Diedrich Kulenkampff (18801967). Just as his older colleague August Bier (18611949) had done with spinal anesthesia in 1898, Kulenkampff subjected himself to the supraclavicular block. Later that year, Georg Hirschel (18751963) described a <b>percutaneous</b> approach to the brachial plexus from the axilla. In 1928, Kulenkampff and Persky published their experiences with a thousand blocks without apparent major complications. They described their technique with the patient in the sitting position or in the supine position with a pillow between the shoulders. The needle was inserted above {{the midpoint of the}} clavicle where the pulse of the subclavian artery could be felt and it was directed medially toward the second or third thoracic spinous process.|$|E
25|$|Improper sharps {{management}} {{is a major}} factor involved in what is categorized as unsafe injections. Annually these account for 21 million, 2 million, and 260,000 of new HBV, HCV, and HIV infections annually. 40-65% of new HBV and HCV are due to <b>percutaneous</b> occupational exposure.|$|E
25|$|Portal Vein Embolization (PVE): Using a <b>percutaneous</b> transhepatic approach, an interventional {{radiologist}} embolizes the portal vein supplying {{the side of}} the liver with the tumor. Compensatory hypertrophy of the surviving lobe can qualify the patient for resection. This procedure can also serve as a bridge to transplant.|$|E
25|$|Gupta is an Emory Healthcare general {{neurosurgeon}} at Grady Memorial Hospital and {{has worked}} on spine, trauma and 3‑D‑image-guided operations. He has published medical journal articles on <b>percutaneous</b> pedicle screw placement, brain tumors, and spinal cord abnormalities. He is licensed to practice medicine in New York, Michigan, Georgia and South Carolina.|$|E
25|$|The table below {{shows the}} success rates and numbers of {{treatments}} for treatments involving both small and large kidney stones, where Treatment A includes all open surgical procedures and Treatment B is <b>percutaneous</b> nephrolithotomy (which involves only a small puncture). The numbers in parentheses indicate {{the number of success}} cases over the total size of the group.|$|E
25|$|As the {{umbilical}} vein is {{directly connected to}} the central circulation, {{it can be used}} as a route for placement of a venous catheter for infusion and medication. The umbilical vein catheter is a reliable alternative to <b>percutaneous</b> peripheral or central venous catheters or intraosseous canulas and may be employed in resuscitation or intensive care of the newborn.|$|E
25|$|Pulmonary {{pathology}} is a subspecialty of anatomic (and especially surgical) pathology {{that deals}} with diagnosis and characterization of neoplastic and non-neoplastic diseases of the lungs and thoracic pleura. Diagnostic specimens are often obtained via bronchoscopic transbronchial biopsy, CT-guided <b>percutaneous</b> biopsy, or video-assisted thoracic surgery. These tests can be necessary to diagnose between infection, inflammation, or fibrotic conditions.|$|E
25|$|For Bennett {{fractures}} {{where there}} is between 1mm and 3mm of displacement at the trapeziometacarpal joint, closed reduction and <b>percutaneous</b> pin fixation (CRPP) with Kirschner wires is often sufficient to ensure a satisfactory functional outcome. The wires are not employed to connect the two fracture fragments together, but rather to secure {{the first or second}} metacarpal to the trapezium.|$|E
25|$|In HIV–HCV co-infected {{patients}}, the Hepatitis C (HCV) viral load {{is higher}} than in HCV-mono-infected patients in both the plasma and liver tissue. Patients who are HIV-positive are commonly co-infected with HCV due to shared routes of transmission: <b>percutaneous</b> exposure to blood, sexual intercourse, and from a mother to her infant. Infection with HCV can be asymptomatic, self-limiting, or progress to cirrhosis or cancer.|$|E
25|$|Ultrasound {{is often}} the first medical imaging test {{performed}} when gallbladder disease such as gallstones are suspected. An abdominal X-ray or CT scan is another form of imaging {{that may be used}} to examine the gallbladder and surrounding organs. Other imaging options include MRCP (magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography), ERCP and <b>percutaneous</b> or intraoperative cholangiography. A cholescintigraphy scan is a nuclear imaging procedure used to assess the condition of the gallbladder.|$|E
25|$|The {{two most}} common {{surgical}} approaches are retroperitoneal (abdominal using laparoscopic surgery), infrainguinal/subinguinal (below the groin) and inguinal (groin using <b>percutaneous</b> embolization). Possible complications {{of this procedure}} include hematoma (bleeding into tissues), hydrocele (accumulation of fluid around the affected testicle), infection, or injury to the scrotal tissue or structures. In addition, injury to the artery that supplies the testicle may occur, resulting {{in a loss of}} a testicle.|$|E
25|$|Aspiration with ethanol {{sclerotherapy}} can {{be performed}} {{for the treatment of}} symptomatic simple renal cysts, but can be impractical in advanced patients with multiple cysts. The procedure itself consists in the <b>percutaneous</b> insertion of a needle into the identified cyst, under ultrasound guidance, with subsequent draining the contained liquid; the sclerotherapy is used to avoid liquid reaccumulation that can occur in the cyst, which can result in symptom recurrence.|$|E
25|$|Once {{someone is}} found to have an atrial septal defect, a {{determination}} of {{whether it should be}} corrected is typically made. If the atrial septal defect is causing the right ventricle to enlarge a secundum atrial septal defect should generally be closed. If the ASD is not causing problems the defect may simply checked every two or three years. Methods of closure of an ASD include surgical closure and <b>percutaneous</b> closure.|$|E
25|$|Patients {{may have}} {{particular}} problems, such as dysphagia, {{which can cause}} swallowed material to pass into the lungs and cause aspiration pneumonia. The condition may improve with time, but in the interim, a nasogastric tube may be inserted, enabling liquid food to be given directly into the stomach. If swallowing is still deemed unsafe, then a <b>percutaneous</b> endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube is passed and this can remain indefinitely.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after the}} first use of cocaine for topical anesthesia, blocks on {{peripheral}} nerves were described. Brachial plexus anesthesia by <b>percutaneous</b> injection through axillary and supraclavicular approaches {{was developed in the}} early 20th century. The search for the most effective and least traumatic approach for plexus anesthesia and peripheral nerve blocks continues to this day. In recent decades, continuous regional anesthesia using catheters and automatic pumps has evolved as a method of pain therapy.|$|E
25|$|The gold {{standard}} for diagnosis of cirrhosis is a liver biopsy, through a <b>percutaneous,</b> transjugular, laparoscopic, or fine-needle approach. A biopsy is not necessary if the clinical, laboratory, and radiologic data suggests cirrhosis. Furthermore, {{there is a small}} but significant risk of complications from liver biopsy, and cirrhosis itself predisposes for complications caused by liver biopsy. The best predictors of cirrhosis are ascites, platelet count <160,000/mm3, spider angiomata, and a Bonacini cirrhosis discriminant score greater than 7.|$|E
25|$|Renal {{pathology}} is a subspecialty of anatomic pathology {{that deals}} with the diagnosis and characterization of disease of the kidneys. In a medical setting, renal pathologists work closely with nephrologists and transplant surgeons, who typically obtain diagnostic specimens via <b>percutaneous</b> renal biopsy. The renal pathologist must synthesize findings from traditional microscope histology, electron microscopy, and immunofluorescence to obtain a definitive diagnosis. Medical renal diseases may affect the glomerulus, the tubules and interstitium, the vessels, {{or a combination of}} these compartments.|$|E
