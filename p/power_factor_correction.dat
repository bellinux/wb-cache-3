40|$|Generally, {{conventional}} <b>power</b> <b>factor</b> <b>corrections</b> techniques assume ideal conditions, viz. sinusoidal {{supply voltage}} and balanced load. But {{vast majority of}} the domestic and industrial loads present in the power distribution system are non-linear and unbalanced. Under such conditions, attempt to make the <b>power</b> <b>factor</b> unity result into a non-sinusoidal source current, which increases total harmonic distortion (THD) in the system. On the other hand attempt to make harmonic free current may not result in unity <b>power</b> <b>factor</b> because of the harmonics present in the supply voltage. Thus, there is a trade off between improvement in <b>power</b> <b>factor</b> and reduction in THD. With the introduction of power quality norms by various utilities, it has become unavoidable to optimize <b>power</b> <b>factor</b> while satisfying harmonics limits. In this paper, a novel technique for optimisation of THD and <b>power</b> <b>factor</b> subject to <b>power</b> quality constraints is presented. The algorithm uses Lagrange multiplier technique to optimise the non-linear equations. The algorithm calculates the control coefficients by Newton Raphson method and is used to compute the desired source current that balances the system besides optimising <b>power</b> <b>factor</b> satisfying the load power while meeting the THD limits. Knowing the load current, the compensating current to be supplied by the shunt active power filter to the power system is calculated. This technique, besides satisfying the power quality norms, also balances the imbalance in the system. It is applicable for single-phase and multi-phase system under sinusoidal and non-sinusoidal supply conditions.

Active three-phase converters shape the three-phase input current to be sinusoidal and to be in-phase with the input voltage, {{as well as to}} provide a steady DC output voltage. This thesis investigates various active three-phase rectifier and control topologies and identifies a rectifier and control topology most suitable for use in converting a variable voltage variable frequency generator output to a DC voltage. In this dissertation, design relations are derived for determining the plant transfer response (for the suitable topology/controller), design equations are derived for designing/choosing the filter components, and guidelines are derived that will assist in choosing the right semi-conductor components and to give an estimation of expected system efficiency. The dissertation investigates the implementation of both analogue and digital control and provides implementation methodologies for both controllers. Expected results are verified by simulation and a build-up prototype. It was shown that the VIENNA rectifier is able to convert a generator type input, with variable input voltage amplitude and variable frequency, to a constant DC-bus voltage whilst controlling the input current to be sinusoidal and in phase with the input voltage. The rectifier was able to maintain a constant DC voltage at the output for input voltages as low as half the rated input voltage and for an equivalent output power of half the rated output power. This suggests that the VIENNA rectifier, controlled as a dual-boost rectifier, is suitable for applications that require <b>power</b> <b>factor</b> <b>corrections</b> and simultaneously operate from a wide input voltage range.

In addition, the switching difficulties associated with the bidirectional switches have complicated the practical implementation of this class of converters. In this thesis, the dyadic matrix structure and the a-b-c to d-q- 0 transformation have been melded together to develop the dyadic matrix converter theory which is a generalized theory for the three-phase to three-phase matrix converters. The thesis addresses the zero-sequence interaction in the matrix converters {{and the role of}} the zero-sequence elements in the Displacement <b>Power</b> <b>Factor</b> (DPF) <b>correction</b> on the utility-side, based on the Static VAR Controller (SVC) principle.

García, "Power <b>Factor</b> <b>Correction</b> Without Current Sensor Based on Digital Current Rebuilding", IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics, vol. 25, no. 6, pp. 1527 - 1536, June 2010. A new digital control technique for <b>power</b> <b>factor</b> (PF) <b>correction</b> is presented. The main novelty of the method {{is that there is}} no current sensor. Instead, the input current is digitally rebuilt, using the estimated input current in the current loop. The circuit measures the input and output voltage by means of low cost ad hoc analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). Taking advantage of the slow dynamic behavior of these voltages, almost completely digital ADCs have been designed, leaving only a comparator and an RC filter in the analog part. Avoiding measuring current can provide a significant advantage compared to analog controllers and this also helps to reduce the total cost. The ultimate objective is to obtain a low-cost digital controller that can be easily integrated as an intellectual property (IP) block into a field-programmable gate array, or an application-specific integrated circuit. The experimental results show a reasonably high PF, despite not measuring the input current, and therefore the feasibility of the method.
