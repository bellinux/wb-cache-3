40|$|Abstract In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the relation between beliefs and goals in agent theory. Beliefs play three roles in reasoning about goals: they <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> in the generation of unconditional desires from conditional ones, they <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> in adoption of desires as goals, and they <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> {{in the selection of}} plans to achieve goals. In this paper {{we consider the}} role of goals in reasoning about beliefs. Though we assume that goals do not <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> in the belief generation problem, we argue that they <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> in the belief selection problem. We show the rationality of the use of goals in belief selection, in the sense that there are cases in which agents that take their goals into account in selecting a belief set from a set of alternatives outperform agents that do not do so. We also formally distinguish between the rational role of goals in belief selection and irrational wishful thinking...|$|R

5|$|While {{religion}} <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> in politics, politics also <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> in religion. In {{the year}} 714, Emperor Xuanzong forbade shops and vendors {{in the city}} of Chang'an to sell copied Buddhist sutras, instead giving the Buddhist clergy of the monasteries the sole right to distribute sutras to the laity. In the previous year of 713, Emperor Xuanzong had liquidated the highly lucrative Inexhaustible Treasury, which was run by a prominent Buddhist monastery in Chang'an. This monastery collected vast amounts of money, silk, and treasures through multitudes of anonymous people's repentances, leaving the donations on the monastery's premise. Although the monastery was generous in donations, Emperor Xuanzong issued a decree abolishing their treasury on grounds that their banking practices were fraudulent, collected their riches, and distributed the wealth to various other Buddhist monasteries and Daoist abbeys, and to repair statues, halls, and bridges in the city.|$|E
