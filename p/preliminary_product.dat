40|$|Up to now, {{high-resolution}} {{mapping of}} surface water extent from satellites {{has only been}} available for a few regions, over limited time periods. The extension of the temporal and spatial coverage was difficult, due to the limitation of the remote sensing technique [e. g., {{the interaction of the}} radiation with vegetation or cloud for visible observations or the temporal sampling with the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) ]. The advantages and the limitations of the various satellite techniques are reviewed. The need to have a global and consistent estimate of the water surfaces over long time periods triggered the development of a multi-satellite methodology to obtain consistent surface water all over the globe, regardless of the environments. The Global Inundation Extent from Multi-satellites (GIEMS) combines the complementary strengths of satellite observations from the visible to the microwave, to produce a low-resolution monthly dataset () of surface water extent and dynamics. Downscaling algorithms are now developed and applied to GIEMS, using high-spatial-resolution information from visible, near-infrared, and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite images, or from digital elevation models. <b>Preliminary</b> <b>products</b> are available down to 500 -m spatial resolution.
