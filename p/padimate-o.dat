It is harmless in the dark but mutagenic in sunlight, attacking DNA directly. A commercial sunscreen containing <b>Padimate-O</b> behaves in the same way. UV-A in sunlight also excites <b>Padimate-O,</b> although less than UV-B. Some related compounds, including a known carcinogen, behave similarly. As mutagens may be carcinogenic, our results suggest that some sunscreens could, while preventing sunburn, contribute to sunlight-related cancers...|$|E
