5|$|Body {{adornment}} {{has only}} recently become a subject of serious scholarly research by archaeologists, who have been hampered in studying body piercing by a sparsity of primary sources. Early records rarely discussed the use of piercings or their meaning, and while jewellery is common among grave goods, {{the deterioration of the}} flesh that it once adorned makes it difficult to discern how the jewellery may have been used. Also, the modern record has been vitiated with the 20th-century inventions of piercing enthusiast Doug Malloy. In the 1960s and 1970s, Malloy marketed contemporary body piercing by giving it the <b>patina</b> <b>of</b> history. His pamphlet Body & Genital Piercing in Brief included such commonly reproduced urban legends as the notion that Prince Albert invented the piercing that shares his name in order to diminish the appearance of his large penis in tight trousers, and that Roman centurions attached their capes to nipple piercings. Some of Malloy's myths are reprinted as fact in subsequently published histories of piercing.|$|E

25|$|Several {{products}} {{have been developed}} for the purpose of polishing silver that serve to remove sulfur from the metal without damaging or warping it. Because harsh polishing and buffing can permanently damage and devalue a piece of antique silver, valuable items are typically hand-polished to preserve the unique <b>patinas</b> <b>of</b> older pieces. Techniques such as wheel polishing, which are typically performed by professional jewelers or silver repair companies, are reserved for extreme tarnish or corrosion.|$|R
5|$|Copper, zinc, tin, {{and lead}} are {{mechanically}} weaker metals but have useful corrosion prevention properties. While {{each of them}} will react with air, the resulting <b>patinas</b> <b>of</b> either various copper salts, zinc carbonate, tin oxide, or a mixture of lead oxide, carbonate, and sulfate, confer valuable protective properties. Copper and lead are therefore used, for example, as roofing materials; zinc acts as an anti-corrosion agent in galvanised steel; and tin serves a similar purpose on steel cans.|$|R

In 2007, book critic Leslie Clark described her fiction as [...] "romance novels with a <b>patina</b> <b>of</b> pseudo-philosophy".

Hot Press magazine's Pete Murphy felt that the song was a let-down and called it [...] "standard dancefloor fodder veneered with a <b>patina</b> <b>of</b> urban and/or Afro-Caribbean sophistication". A writer for The Scotsman stated that regarded the song as [...] "another of those anonymous, mass-produced party hits sung by a faceless rent-a-vocalist".

500|$|AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave a mixed review {{calling the}} soundtrack [...] "unengaging". He theorized {{that it was}} due to Madonna's performance. Erlewine commended Madonna's singing but deduced that her vocals made the songs sound like she was [...] "trying really hard to be credible, which makes it {{difficult}} to connect with her". While reviewing the film, San Francisco Chronicles Octavio Roca's feeling about the soundtrack was mixed, saying that the [...] "delicious irony of Rice's lyrics remains intact, as does the freshness of Lloyd Webber's music". But Roca believed that the Latin influences present in the original songs were missing, due to John Mauceri's [...] "languid conducting of the soundtrack, and most of all by Vincent Paterson's choreography". A negative review came from The Baltimore Sun; critic J. D. Considine felt the soundtrack would disappoint Madonna fans [...] "because Evita just isn't pop music—or, at least, not the kind of pop music Madonna usually makes on her own... As a result, slogging through Evita is like listening to an opera written by someone who never got beyond learning how to write recitativo". Considine was also disappointed with the vocal abilities of Madonna and co-star Antonio Banderas; [...] "they lack the power and tone to lend this intoned dialog a <b>patina</b> <b>of</b> musicality". Finally, Owen Gleiberman from Entertainment Weekly called it a [...] "soundtrack of mediocre '70s rock".|$|E
40|$|Space {{weathering}} {{occurs on}} all ex-posed surfaces of lunar rocks, {{as well as}} on the surfaces of smaller grains in the lunar regolith. Space weather-ing alters these exposed surfaces primarily through the action of solar wind ions and micrometeorite impact processes. On lunar rocks specifically, the alteration products produced by space weathering form surface coatings known as patina. Patinas can have spectral reflectance properties different than the underlying rock. An understanding <b>of</b> <b>patina</b> composition and thickness is therefore important for interpreting re-motely sensed data from airless solar system bodies.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{contribute}} to the improvement of restoration and conservation sciences of metallic artefacts belonging to Cultural Heritage, a wide research has been started on the study of artificial (artistic) and natural (corrosion or alteration) <b>patinas</b> <b>of</b> copper-based alloys. Micro-Raman spectroscopy (mRS) coupled with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) equipped with energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (EDXS) were applied for the characterization of a number <b>of</b> <b>patinas</b> made on metallic substrate reproducing the typical copper-based alloys used for statuary. A non alloyed copper sheet has been also used to simulate the architectural cover typically used after a specific cold spray coating. To reach these goals, a number <b>of</b> <b>patinas</b> were experimentally produced in our laboratory using the torch technique and reactive solutions based on water as a solvent containing, respectively, copper nitrate, iron nitrate and potassium sulfide (‘liver of sulfur’). The only exception is a sample reproducing the architectural cover of a recent building nearly completely covered with copper sheets coated with copper salts. All the produced patinas were aged in a salt spray chamber and then studied with mRS, SEM and EDXS in order to understand their evolution between the two known terms and therefore the reactions involved in all patinas. mRS allowedus todetect asmain constituents <b>of</b> the ‘artistic’ <b>patinas,</b> before and after ageing: copper oxides (Cuprite and Tenorite), copper nitrates (Rouaite and Gerhardtite), copper chlorides (Botallackite, Atacamite and Paratacamite), a copper sulfate (Posnjakite), iron oxides (Magnetite and Hematite) and an iron hydroxide (Limonite) ...|$|R

At the end of the month, Alan Taylor, best known for directing episodes of the HBO fantasy series Game of Thrones, was chosen to direct the sequel. Feige mentioned Taylor's work on the series Mad Men, Boardwalk Empire and Game of Thrones as reasons for his hiring, saying [...] "With Alan's direction we got a few more layers of <b>patina,</b> <b>of</b> texture, of reality into our golden realm." [...] By January 10, Marvel Studios had commissioned screenwriter Robert Rodat to rewrite the sequel and Hiddleston stated that filming was expected to begin in London in the summer of 2012.

Hemsworth also revealed that the film would have a more Viking-influenced feel, elaborating [...] "I think the science fiction element to Thor… the danger is it falls a little bit into the world of it's 'tough to throw a light to.' I think of big waterfalls and mountains and a Viking influence, where the Norse mythology kind of grew from.

[...] Feige said [...] "while the relationship between Loki and Thor certainly has changed [...] and has progressed, a lot of Thor 2 is picking up where it left off in terms of Jane, who you just saw for a moment on a computer monitor, and also what's been going on in the nine realms without the Asgardians being able to use the Bifrost."

The people who built this cathedral intended that its interior should be light. There was nothing natural about its darkness. It was nothing to do with ageing of the stone.
