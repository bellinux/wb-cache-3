The standard states that the bolts must be tightened to at least 70% of the tensile yield strength.

50|$|Ultimate tensile {{strength}} is the {{tensile stress at}} which the bolt fails. Tensile yield strength is the stress at which the bolt will yield in tension across the entire section of the bolt and receive a permanent set (an elongation from which it will not recover when the force is removed) of 0.2% offset strain. <b>Proof</b> <b>strength</b> is the usable strength of the fastener. Tension testing of a bolt up to the proof load should not cause permanent set of the bolt and should be conducted on actual fasteners rather than calculated. If a bolt is tensioned beyond the proof load, it may behave in plastic manner due to yielding in the threads and the tension preload may be lost due to the permanent plastic deformations. When elongating a fastener prior to reaching the yield point, the fastener {{is said to be}} operating in the elastic region; whereas elongation beyond the yield point is referred to as operating in the plastic region of the bolt material. If a bolt is loaded in tension beyond its <b>proof</b> <b>strength,</b> the yielding at the net root section of the bolt will continue until the entire section is begins to yield and it has exceeded its yield strength. If tension increases, the bolt fractures at its ultimate strength.|$|E

Since the post to post spacing is a primary driver of cable rigidity, the post to post spacing is very important. It is generally recommended that post spacing {{be no more than}} 5 ft on center Some manufacturers require as little as no more than 3 ft on center. The reason for post spacing is more about the cable end fittings' machine thread loading capacity (how much tension can be put on the threads before they fail), than anything else.

40|$|A {{recent letter}} from us has {{indicated}} that the tensile <b>proof</b> <b>strength</b> of polycrystalline Ag micro-wires, with thicknesses {{in the range from}} 20 to 50. μm, depends strongly on the specimen size (t) and weakly on the grain size (d) when t/. d becomes smaller than about 3. In this work, we report further coupled effects of specimen size and grain size in the regime when their ratio is small. At a given grain size from 3 to 40. μm, the tensile elongation was found to decrease as the wire thickness decreases, and as the t/. d ratio gets smaller than about 3, the tensile elongation loses its dependence on the grain size. The work-hardening rate was found to scale approximately with the <b>proof</b> <b>strength,</b> and so they should be controlled by the same metallurgical factors. Transmission electron microscopy examination of the dislocation microstructures showed that in the regime where the grain size dominates strength and ductility, the dislocation density rises rapidly on deformation, but in the regime where the specimen thickness dominates strength and ductility, the dislocation density remains on the same order of magnitude as the undeformed state. The easy escape of dislocations from the specimen is thought to be the reason for the observed size effect of strength. © 2012 Elsevier B. V. postprin...|$|E

The alloy compositions were selected to provide an attractive balance of tensile strength and elongation, without relying on complex post-processing and heat treatments - and are therefore suitable for complex cross section extrusions and free from quench distortion. The as-spray formed microstructures showed fine homogeneous, equiaxed grains with an average size of 10 - 15 μm. Firstly, a laboratory scale extrusion was carried out to extrude 30 mm diameter billets into 7. 5 mm diameter cross-section and to investigate the effects of temperature and ram speeds on microstructural development. The microstructure after extrusion at 400 °C was partially dynamically recrystallised with a ∼ 0. 5 area fraction of ∼ 1 μm grains and the remainder were unrecrystallised elongated grains. Electron backscatter diffraction showed a mixed + double fibre texture. After peak age hardening at 150 °C for 96 h, the Al- 6 Mg- 1. 6 Li- 0. 4 Zr alloy showed a 0. 2 % <b>proof</b> <b>strength</b> of 495 MPa, a tensile strength of 553 MPa and elongation to failure of 8. 5 %; Al- 4 Mg- 1. 3 Li- 0. 4 Zr showed a 0. 2 % <b>proof</b> <b>strength</b> of 392 MPa, a tensile strength of 476 MPa and an elongation of 10 %. Subsequently, large-scale complex cross-section were extruded at ∼ 400 °C.

40|$|Recently, {{several authors}} have {{explored}} {{the connections between}} NP-complete problems for finite objects and the complexity of their analogs for infinite objects. In this paper, we will categorize infinite versions of several problems arising from finite complexity theory {{in terms of their}} recursion theoretic complexity and <b>proof</b> theoretic <b>strength.</b> These infinite analogs can behave in a variety of unexpected ways. Startling parallels exist between the computational complexity of certain graph theoretic problems and the recursion theoretic complexity and <b>proof</b> theoretic <b>strength</b> of their infinite analogs. For example, the problem of deciding which finite graphs have an Euler path is known to be P-time computable [9], and Beigel and Gasarch [4] have shown that the problem of deciding which infinite recursive graphs have an Euler path is arithmetical. By contrast, the problem of deciding which finite graphs have Hamilton paths is NP-complete [8], and Harel [6] has shown that the problem of deciding which infinite recursive graphs have a Hamilton graph is Σ 1 1 complete. Thus, the possibly greater computational complexity is paralleled by a demonstrable increase in recursion theoretic complexity.
