60|$|At length, in fact, an {{occasion}} came. In the year B.C. 67, {{which was about}} the time that Caesar commenced his successful career in rising to public office in Rome, as is described in the third chapter of this volume, the Cilician pirates, of whose desperate character and bold exploits something has already been said, had become so powerful, and were increasing so rapidly in the extent of their depredations, that the Roman people felt compelled to adopt some very vigorous measures for suppressing them. The pirates had increased in numbers during the wars between Marius and Sylla in a very alarming degree. They had built, equipped, and organized whole fleets. They had various fortresses, arsenals, ports, and watch-towers all along the coasts of the Mediterranean. They had also extensive warehouses, built in secure and secluded places, where they stored their plunder. Their fleets were well manned, and provided with skillful pilots, and with ample supplies of every kind; and they were so well constructed, both for speed and safety, that no other ships could be made to surpass them. Many of them, too, were adorned and decorated in the most sumptuous manner, with gilded sterns, purple awnings, and silver-mounted oars. The number of their galleys was said to be a thousand. With this force they made themselves almost complete masters of the sea. They attacked not only separate ships, but whole fleets of merchantmen sailing under convoy; and they increased the difficulty and expense of bringing grain to Rome so much, by intercepting the supplies, as very materially to enhance the price and to threaten a scarcity. They made themselves masters of many islands and of various maritime towns along the coast, until they had four hundred ports and cities in their <b>possession.</b> <b>In</b> <b>fact,</b> they had gone so far toward forming themselves into a regular maritime power, under a systematic and legitimate government, that very respectable young men from other countries began to enter their service, as one opening honorable avenues to wealth and fame.|$|E

60|$|But war is {{only the}} final flower of an evil tree. Even in times of peace, most men live lives of {{monotonous}} labor, most women are condemned to a drudgery which almost kills the possibility of happiness before youth is past, most children are allowed {{to grow up in}} ignorance of all that would enlarge their thoughts or stimulate their imagination. The few who are more fortunate are rendered illiberal by their unjust privileges, and oppressive through fear of the awakening indignation of the masses. From the highest to the lowest, almost all men are absorbed in the economic struggle: the struggle to acquire what is their due or to retain what is not their due. Material <b>possessions,</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> or <b>in</b> desire, dominate our outlook, usually to the exclusion of all generous and creative impulses. Possessiveness--the passion to have and to hold--is the ultimate source of war, and the foundation of all the ills from which the political world is suffering.

5000|$|Chief Justice Melville Fuller {{wrote for}} a {{unanimous}} court. He found, citing Jones v. United States (1890), {{that the court}} needed to examine what the legislative and executive branches had determined with respect to Isle of Pines. For example, after citing evidence that [...] "all the world knew that of Pines {{was an integral part}} of Cuba", he asked with respect to the Treaty of Paris: [...] "Has the treaty been otherwise interpreted by the political departments of this government?" [...] He found no evidence that U.S. authorities had taken actions that showed they viewed the Isle of Pines as falling within the jurisdiction of the United States. After reviewing the language of various international agreements, military orders, official correspondence, and the activities of government administrators at various levels, he found that the United States had never exercised sovereignty over the Isle of Pines, that since being ceded by Spain it had been under the de facto jurisdiction of Cuba, and that it was therefore foreign territory for tariff purposes. He concluded: The Isle of Pines continues at least de facto, under the jurisdiction of the government of the Republic of Cuba, and that settles the question before us, because, as the United States have never taken possession of the Isle of Pines as having been ceded by the treaty of peace, and as it has been and is being governed by the Republic of Cuba, it has remained [...] "foreign country" [...] within the meaning of the Dingley Act.... There has been no change of nationality for revenue purposes, but, on the contrary, the Cuban government has been recognized as rightfully exercising sovereignty over the Isle of Pines as a de facto government until otherwise provided. It must be treated as foreign, for this States government has never taken, nor aimed to take, that <b>possession</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> and in law which is essential to render it domestic.|$|E

40|$|George Bealer has {{provided}} an elaborate {{defense of the}} practice of appealing to intuition in philosophy. In the present paper, I argue that his defense fails.

40|$|Immissions from {{neighboring}} properties, such as noise, smoke, tremors etc, are governed in the substantive law by the Law on Foundations of Property Relations. The Law envisages that a lawsuit may be filed to prevent disturbances. Moreover, {{there is also}} the option to seek the compensation of incurred damages. The lawsuit for removal of neighboring immissions differs from the one for obstruction of possession, since it doesn't require establishment of the most recent status of possession, and since there is no deprivation of <b>possession</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact.</b> Neighboring immissions result in disturbance of possession, wherefore the lawsuit on neighboring immissions boils down to evidencing of environmental infringements of neighboring property's space - e. g. soil, air - set forth by the law. Disturbance of possession through illicit influencing of a property, whereupon such property does not change its holder, represents also a form of trespassing, which may be subject to a separate lawsuit. Such disturbance is not caused by immissions...|$|E

The loyalty of Aonghas to Robert, however, did not mean that John's loyalty to Robert's son and successor David II would follow suit. After Edward Balliol's coup against the Bruce regime in 1333, Edward attempted to court John. In 1336, Edward confirmed the territories which the Islay lords had acquired in the days of Robert I; and additionally, Edward awarded John the lands of Kintyre, Knapdale, Gigha, Colonsay, Mull, Skye, Lewis, and Morvern, held by magnates still loyal to the Bruces. John, however, never provided Edward with real assistance. Although Balliol's deposition by the supporters of David meant that the grants made to John void, John's pre-1336 <b>possessions</b> were <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> confirmed by King David in 1343. Moreover, in 1346, John inherited the great Lordship of Garmoran through his marriage to Amie mac Ruari after the death of her brother Raghnall Mac Ruaidhrí.
