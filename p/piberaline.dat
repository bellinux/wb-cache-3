It has stimulant and antidepressant effects which are thought to be due largely to its active metabolite benzylpiperazine. It was researched to a limited extent in Hungary and Spain, but was not widely accepted and {{does not seem to be}} in current use, although a closely related drug befuraline with similar effects has been slightly more successful.|$|E
