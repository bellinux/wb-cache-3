40|$|This article {{deals with}} the issue of <b>administrative</b> <b>decision,</b> which {{represents}} one of the principal forms of the realization of public administration in the Czech Republic. Even if the Czech legislation provides for its issuance a number of requirements in relation to its content and form, in practice, however, there are violations of these legal conditions and requirements and then we talk about a defective <b>administrative</b> <b>decision.</b> According to how to remedy the defective administrative acts, distinction is made between formally defective <b>administrative</b> <b>decisions,</b> factually inaccurate decisions, unlawful decisions, and next to them, separately null <b>administrative</b> <b>decisions.</b> The main attention is paid to the nullity, because only the nullity represents the most serious and also irremovable defect of an <b>administrative</b> <b>decision.</b> As the null decision does not exist from the perspective of law, it is not able to affect the rights and duties of its recipients. The null acts, as the only category of defective administrative acts, constitute an exception to the principle of the presumption of validity and correctness of administrative acts...|$|R
40|$|The problem {{statement}} {{addressed in this}} study is as follows: to what extent does EU law compel a Dutch stable <b>administrative</b> <b>decision</b> and judgement to be revoked if they are not compliant with that law? The {{problem statement}} presumes that Dutch law has a system in place with respect to the revocation of a stable <b>administrative</b> <b>decision</b> and judgement. In this study it is made clear {{that there is no such}} system. As a rule, revoking a stable <b>administrative</b> <b>decision</b> and judgement leads to contentment as well as resistance. To overcome the resistance and thereby to create consensus as to contentment, there must be systematic rules governing the revocation. Based on dogmatics, a system can be created, avoiding a situation in which there are only intuitive judgments which, because they lack structure, cannot lead to the certainty and predictability of the law. In that regard this study provids points to consider in the General Administrative Law Act about the revocation of a stable <b>administrative</b> <b>decision.</b> In view of the principle of national procedural autonomy, the starting point is that, in the absence of EU rules on this subject, EU law does not compel a national stable <b>administrative</b> <b>decision</b> and judgement to be revoked if they are not compliant with that law. There are circumstances, however, in which EU law recognises such an obligation. An EU law duty to revoke a national stable <b>administrative</b> <b>decision</b> is more powerful in force than the EU duty to revoke a national stable judgement. The European Court of Justice seems to have recognised that from the characterization of administration versus justice it follows that the administrative body’s freedom to revoke its stable <b>administrative</b> <b>decision</b> is greater than the court’s freedom to revoke its stable judgement. The the EU duty to revoke a national stable <b>administrative</b> <b>decision</b> unfavourably is more powerful in force than the EU duty to revoke a national stable <b>administrative</b> <b>decision</b> favourably. An explanation for this difference can be found in the fact that the EU law duty to recover – which can mean under Dutch law that a stable <b>administrative</b> <b>decision</b> is revoked unfavourably – is not so much about the interests of an individual (as is the case with the EU law duty to revoke a national stable <b>administrative</b> <b>decision</b> favourably), but rather about the general interests of the European Union itself, such as (in the case of EU (agricultural) aid) the justified allocation of financial resources and (in the case of state aid) the prevention of a distortion of competition...|$|R

Issues related to recognition of foreign <b>administrative</b> <b>decisions</b> could be understood as a balancing of interests between the involved legal orders and the affected individuals. The article puts forward a categorisation of recognition mechanisms in the light of this balancing of interests. It is concluded that the degrees of transfer of public power through the different recognition mechanisms make it possible for legislators and legal decision-makers to find an appropriate level of cooperation...|$|R
