25|$|Daewoo's now disbanded Worthing Technical Centre in the UK {{conducted}} the initial research and platform engineering, with Daewoo's main Technical Center in Bupyong, Incheon, South Korea completing {{the majority of}} the later development programme.

Long-term testing covered nearly 2.2 million kilometers (1.4million miles) with further testing outside South Korea on test sites in Arjeplog, Sweden; Granada and El Vendrell, Spain; Kapuskasing, Canada and Beijing, China. According to an April, 2003 GMDAT press release, Daewoo built 119 prototypes during the Kalos's design and development, crashing 31 for research and data-gathering purposes, and manufacturing 39 <b>pilot</b> <b>production</b> vehicles to verify standards and quality.|$|E
25|$|In 1931, Ford hired chemists Robert Boyer and Frank Calvert {{to produce}} {{artificial}} silk. They {{succeeded in making}} a textile fiber of spun soy protein fibers, hardened or tanned in a formaldehyde bath, which was given the name Azlon. It was usable {{in the making of}} suits, felt hats, and overcoats. Though <b>pilot</b> <b>production</b> of Azlon reached 5000pounds per day in 1940, it never reached the commercial market; Dupont's nylon was the winner in the quest to produce artificial silk. In 1932–33, the Ford Motor Company spent approximately $1,250,000 on soybean research. By 1935, every Ford car had soy involved in its manufacture. For example, soybean oil was used to paint the automobiles, as well as fluid for shock absorbers. Ford's involvement with the soybean opened many doors for agriculture and industry to be linked more strongly than ever before.|$|E
