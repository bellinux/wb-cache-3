40|$|International audiencePlaylist {{generation}} {{is a special}} form of music recommendation {{where the problem is}} to create a sequence of tracks to be played next, given a number of seed tracks. In academia, the evaluation of <b>playlisting</b> techniques is often done by assessing with the help of Information Retrieval measures if an algorithm is capable of selecting those tracks that also a human would pick next. Such approaches however cannot capture other factors, e. g., the homogeneity of the tracks that can determine the quality perception of <b>playlists.</b> In this work, we report the results of a multi-metric comparison of different academic approaches and a commercial <b>playlisting</b> service. Our results show that all tested techniques generate <b>playlists</b> with certain biases, e. g., towards very popular tracks, and often create <b>playlists</b> continuations that are quite different from those that are created by real users...|$|R

40|$|Automatically {{generated}} <b>playlists</b> {{have become}} an important medium for accessing and exploring large collections of music. In this paper, we present a probabilistic model for generating coherent <b>playlists</b> by embedding songs and social tags in a unified metric space. We show how the embedding {{can be learned from}} example <b>playlists,</b> providing the metric space with a probabilistic meaning for song/song, song/tag, and tag/tag distances. This enables at least three types of inference. First, our models can generate new <b>playlists,</b> outperforming conventional n-gram models in terms of predictive likelihood by orders of magnitude. Second, the learned tag embeddings provide a generalizing representation for embedding new songs, allowing it to create <b>playlists</b> even for songs it has never observed in training. Third, we show that the embedding space provides an effective metric for matching songs to naturallanguage queries, even if tags for a large fraction of the songs are missing. 1...|$|R
