Cellulose exhibited highest thermal stability during torrefation at 473 K. Hemicellulose attained 48 % decompositionafter torrefaction at 523 K while lignin decomposition was limited to 65 % after torrefaction at 573 K. Co-torrefaction ligno-hemicellulosic compounds followed a similar trend for torrefaction behavior of biomass samples. Morphology changes in torrefied cellulose and biomass were notable on fiber shrinkage basis while hemicellulose disintegrated into smaller. However, no significant morphology change was observed on lignin.

Xerogels and membranes were pyrolyzed under inert conditions in vacuum and nitrogen {{to form the}} hybrid carbon silica structures. FTIR analyses showed the presence of Si–C groups in addition to silanol and siloxane groups for samples pyrolysed at 450 °C. Vacuum pyrolyzed xerogels produced slightly higher pore volumes {{than that of the}} nitrogen <b>pyrolyzed</b> <b>samples.</b> As a result, the vacuum pyrolyzed membranes produced highest water fluxes compared to the nitrogen pyrolyzed membranes.

In this report, 1. 9 cm diameter cores of Mahogany oil shale were pyrolyzed at different temperatures and heating rates. Detailed 3 D imaging of core samples was done using multiscale X-ray computed tomography (CT) before and after pyrolysis to establish the pore structure. The pore structure of the unreacted material was not clear. Selected images of a core pyrolyzed at 400 oC were obtained at voxel resolutions from 39 microns (❍m) to 60 nanometers (nm). Some of the pore space created during pyrolysis was clearly visible at these resolutions and it was possible to distinguish between the reaction products and the host shale rock. The pore structure deduced from the images was used in Lattice Boltzmann simulations to calculate the permeability in the pore space.

In this study, SWCNT samples were first functionalized by reductive alkylation using metallic lithium and 1 -iodododecane in liquid ammonia. Samples of the alkyl-functionalized SWCNTs were then pyrolyzed under an inert atmosphere at selected temperatures between 100 and 500 °C to remove the addends. The extent of defunctionalization was assessed {{using a combination of}} thermogravimetric analysis, Raman measurements of the D, G, and radial breathing bands, absorption spectroscopy of the first- and second-order van Hove peaks, and near-IR fluorescence spectroscopy of (n,m) -specific emission bands. These measurements all indicate a substantial dependence of defunctionalization rate on nanotube diameter, with larger diameter nanotubes showing more facile loss of addends. The effective activation energy for defunctionalization is estimated to be a factor of ∼ 1. 44 greater for 0. 76 nm diameter nanotubes as compared to those with 1. 24 nm diameter. The experimental findings also reveal the quantitative variation with functionalization density of the Raman D/G intensity ratio and the relative near-IR fluorescence intensity. <b>Pyrolyzed</b> <b>samples</b> show spectroscopic properties that are equivalent to those of SWCNTs prior to functionalization.

The synergistic effect of combustion behaviour of coal blends is often uncertain. This study aims to clarify the factors that may affect the synergistic phenomena with emphasis on modification of char characteristics during treatment under different gas environments. Coal samples were subjected to various thermal conditions using a DTF, double-layered FBR, TGA and the resulting char specimens were characterized using a XRD, NMR, SEM, BET, etc. Char oxidation rate with O 2 and gasification rates with CO 2 were measured using a TGA and FBR respectively. The study showed that total weight loss and maximum decomposition rate of blends exceeded compared to the expected values, and confirmed the synergistic effect of coal blending on thermal decomposition rate and the nature as well as magnitude of pyrolysis products. The study confirmed that molecular structure of char is modified during pyrolysis due to interaction with the pyrolysis gases evolved from blend components, and impacts the char reactivity in accordance with known association with molecular structure. During combustion at high temperatures in a DTF, coal blends did not show notable synergistic effect under both O 2 /N 2 and O 2 /CO 2 conditions. The reaction rate of <b>pyrolyzed</b> char <b>samples</b> of coal blends was lower compared to their weighted constituent coal chars.

The extent of coal conversion varied with coal type and influenced by modification of char physical structure during devolatilization.

We undertook this work to determine the combustion properties of reduced-lignin black liquors-two kraft liquors and one soda liquor-in a laboratory-scale, single-particle furnace. The combustion times, maximum swollen volume, nitric oxide formation, cyanate formation, and sulfur release were measured for the original liquors, the filtrates, and intermediate levels of lignin reduction. Combustion experiments were conducted at 900 degrees C in 10 % oxygen. Cyanate formation experiments were carried out by pyrolyzing the droplets at 800 degrees C in 100 % nitrogen to form a char. The chars were then gasified at 800 degrees C in a 13 % carbon dioxide/ 87 % nitrogen atmosphere to obtain the smelt. Sulfur release was studied by <b>pyrolyzing</b> the <b>samples</b> at temperatures ranging from 300 degrees C to 900 degrees C. Liquors with the lowest lignin content had a smaller maximum swollen volume than the original sample. The devolatilization time was not affected by the lignin removal to any great extent, but lignin removal did have a clear effect on the char burning time. The amount of formed nitric oxide (g N/kg black liquor solids) remained constant or decreased slightly with increasing lignin removal in the kraft liquor samples, while for the soda samples the amount of nitric oxide formed increased. The amount of cyanate decreased clearly when comparing the samples with lowest lignin content to the original liquor samples. The peak sulfur release occurred at 500 degrees C for both kraft liquors. In almost all experiments, the share of sulfur released was highest for the original samples and lowest for the sample with lowest lignin content. These results provide new data on combustion properties for reduced-lignin black liquors and indicate that for lignin removal levels up to about 20 %, no significant changes are expected in the combustion behavior. Application: This work will help mills identify the effect of lignin precipitation on combustion properties of black liquor...|$|R
40|$|Wastewater {{treatment}} {{processes are}} {{not designed to}} remove estrogenic micropollutants and therefore when wastewater biosolids are land applied estrogenic micropollutants are discharged to the environment. Release of estrogenic compounds has deleterious effects on the terrestrial environment. Public concern stemming from micropollutants may reduce the value of biosolids which are important to water resource reclamation facilities (WRRF) as by-products. The objective {{of this research was}} to evaluate pyrolysis, the partial decomposition of organic material in an oxygen-deprived system under high temperatures, as a sustainable solution to remove estrogenic compounds from biosolids while producing a useable soil conditioner called biochar. Batch pyrolysis was conducted at different temperatures (100 - 500 °C) on anaerobically digested biosolids (ADB). Primary sludge (PS) and ADB samples were also collected from a WRRF to compare the estrogenicity of conventionally treated biosolids to <b>pyrolyzed</b> biosolids. These <b>samples</b> were extracted and analyzed via the yeast estrogen screen (YES) assay to quantify total estrogenicity. The YES assay utilizes a yeast strain, but the yeast is susceptible to toxicity from wastewater solids samples, causing estrogen response interference and test inaccuracy. Therefore, a cleanup method employing silica and alumina was developed and implemented prior to the YES assay to remove toxicity while maintaining estrogenicity. In the pyrolysis experiments, more than 95 % of the estrogen equivalents were removed from biosolids at 400 °C and higher temperatures. The biochar had significantly lower estrogenicity that PS and ADB. The lower estrogenicity in biochar could mean production of a more preferred product coming from WRRFs...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) {{experiment}} onboard the Curiosity rover of the Mars Science Laboratory {{mission is}} partly {{devoted to the}} in situ molecular analysis of gases evolving from solid samples collected on Mars surface/sub-surface. SAM has a gas-chromatograph coupled to a quadrupole mass spectrometer (GC-QMS) devoted to the separation and identification of organic and inorganic material [1]. Before proceeding to the GC-QMS analysis, the solid sample collected by Curiosity is subjected to a thermal treatment thanks to the pyrolysis oven to release the volatiles into the gas processing system. As the Viking landers in 1976 [2], SAM detected chlorohydrocarbons with the pyrolysis GC-QMS experiment [3, 4]. The detection of perchlorates salts in soil at the Phoenix Landing site [6] suggests that these chloro- hydrocarbons could come from the reaction of organics with oxychlorines. Oxychlorines indeed decomposed into molecular oxygen and volatile chlorine when heated and react with the organic matter in the samples by oxidation and/or chlorination processes. [3, 5, 7, 8]. During SAM pyrolysis, samples are heated to 850 ◦C. SAM detected C 1 to C 3 chloroalkanes, entirely attributed to reaction products occurring during the pyrolysis experiment between oxychlorines and organic carbon from instrument background [3] and chlorobenzene and C 2 to C 4 dichloroalkanes produced by reaction between Mars endogenous organics with oxychlorines [4]. To help understanding the influence of perchlorate and chlorate salts on organic matter during SAM pyrolysis, we systemically study the reaction products formed during pyrolysis of various organic compounds mixed with various perchlorates and chlorates. We selected organics from simple molecule forms as for instance PAHs and amino acids to complex material (> 30 carbon atoms) such as kerogen. The perchlorate and chlorate salts are prepared at 1 wt % concentration in silica and mixed with the organics to study the potential qualitative and/or quantitative effects. The experiments are performed on a laboratory GC-QMS with a Restek Rxi- 5 column (30 m x 0. 25 mm x 0. 25 μm) and an Intersciences pyrolyser. The mixture is pyrolyzed at different temperatures up to 900 ◦C to cover the SAM temperature range. Different experiments are done to discriminate the pyrolysis products directly coming from the organics, and those produced from the reaction with oxychlorine. These experiments are under progress and should bring key information on the potential to identify Martian organics when <b>pyrolyzing</b> solid <b>samples.</b> Depending on the organic families studied, we may find recurring molecules, which are potentially present in Mars’ surface samples. This work could thus highlight some organic precursors of the chlorinated compounds found on Mars, and support the interpretation of SAM measurements...|$|R
40|$|When {{impregnated}} in biomass, metal precursors display {{catalytic activity}} {{that results in}} {{a significant decrease in}} tar production and increases hydrogen formation during pyrolysis. The aim of this work was to assess the effect of nickel and iron salts on the pyrolysis mechanisms of the main constituents of biomass. Samples of metal-impregnated cellulose, hemicelluloses (beech wood xylan) and lignin were <b>pyrolyzed.</b> Beech wood <b>samples</b> with different metal contents (0. 10, 0. 26 and 0. 65 mmol/gwood) were also tested to compare the effects of iron and nickel in the biomass. As a result of metal impregnation, significant changes in the yields of pyrolysis products, in the concentration of tar compounds (determined by GC-MS) and in the composition of the gaseous fraction were obtained. The results showed that in cellulose, xylan and lignin, impregnated iron catalyzed rearrangement reactions leading to an increase in char yield and a decrease in tar formation. Impregnated nickel also catalyzed charring reactions in microcrystalline cellulose and in lignin, but promoted the depolymerization of amorphous xylan resulting in a 27 -fold increase in furfural yields. Nickel was more efficient than iron in the rearrangement of the aromatic rings in the matrix, which contributed to the large increase in hydrogen production observed with nickel-impregnated samples (+ 472 % for nickel-impregnated lignin). Based on these results, it was possible to explain the changes in pyrolysis yields obtained from beech wood after metal impregnation. The comparison of the catalytic effect of the two metals on biomass constituents explained the higher char yield and tar decrease obtained with iron-impregnated wood on one hand, and the higher aromatic tar reduction and hydrogen production increase obtained with nickel-impregnated wood on the other hand.
