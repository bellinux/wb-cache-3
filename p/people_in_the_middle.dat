25|$|The {{buildings}} on London Bridge were a major fire hazard {{and increased the}} load on its arches, several of {{which had to be}} rebuilt over the centuries. In 1212, perhaps the greatest of the early fires of London broke out on both ends of the bridge simultaneously, trapping many <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle.</b> Houses on the bridge were burnt during Wat Tyler's Peasants' Revolt in 1381 and during Jack Cade's rebellion in 1450. A major fire of 1633 that destroyed the northern third of the bridge formed a firebreak that prevented further damage to the bridge during the Great Fire of London (1666).|$|E

25|$|Setsuna {{was created}} as a Kurd because {{director}} Seiji Mizushima wanted to explore the situation <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> East go through which forces {{them to participate in}} wars. He was also made to contrast previous Gundam characters who were relatable with the audience. Setsuna has been a popular character in Japan, where voice actor Mamoru Miyano received an award for the role, and within the Gundam fanbase, ranking highly in various polls. However, critical reception to Setsuna's character from English-language publications for anime, manga and other media has been mixed, criticizing his silent personality but praising his growth across the series.|$|E
25|$|A {{possible}} non-literary but graphic {{indication that}} <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> Ages {{believed that the}} Earth (or perhaps the world) was a sphere {{is the use of}} the orb (globus cruciger) in the regalia of many kingdoms and of the Holy Roman Empire. It is attested {{from the time of the}} Christian late-Roman emperor Theodosius II (423) throughout the Middle Ages; the Reichsapfel was used in 1191 at the coronation of emperor Henry VI. However the word 'orbis' means 'circle' and there is no record of a globe as a representation of the Earth since ancient times in the west till that of Martin Behaim in 1492. Additionally it could well be a representation of the entire 'world' or cosmos.|$|E
25|$|The {{practice}} of medicine in the early Middle Ages was in fact empirical and pragmatic. It focused mainly on curing disease rather than discovering the cause of diseases. Often it was believed the cause of disease was supernatural. Nevertheless, approaches to curing disease existed. <b>People</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> Ages considered medicine through {{an understanding of the}} humors. This approach was likely influenced by a largely rural existence in which people understood the influences of the elements of the sustenance of agriculture. Since {{it was clear that the}} fertility of the earth depended on the proper balance of the elements, it followed that the same was true for the body, within which the various humors, as they were understood, had to be in balance. This approach greatly influenced medical theory throughout the Middle Ages.|$|E

500|$|Several notable <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> Ages had {{origins in}} Faversham.

500|$|The work {{displays}} a thoughtful symmetry. In {{the center of}} the five parts is the court hearing which confronts Jesus, Pilate, and the <b>people.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of the hearing, a chorale (22) interrupts the argument, which is a discussion about freedom and captivity. It is surrounded by two choral movements, which not only both ask for the crucifixion of Jesus, but also use the same musical motifs, the second time intensified. [...] Again, in a repetition of similar musical material, a preceding [...] choir explains the law, while a corresponding movement reminds Pilate of the Emperor whose authority is challenged by someone calling himself a king. Preceding this, Jesus is greeted in mockery as a king, corresponding in motif to the later request that Pilate should change the inscription saying he is [...] "the King of the Jews" [...] to [...] "He said: I am the King of the Jews".|$|E
500|$|The {{caricature}} {{of the period}} is also reflected in some more specific notions. One misconception, first propagated in the 19th century and still very common, is that all <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> Ages believed that the Earth was flat. This is untrue, as lecturers in the medieval universities commonly argued that evidence showed the Earth was a sphere. Lindberg and Ronald Numbers, another scholar of the period, state that there [...] "was scarcely a Christian scholar of the Middle Ages who did not acknowledge [...] sphericity and even know its approximate circumference". Other misconceptions such as [...] "the Church prohibited autopsies and dissections during the Middle Ages", [...] "the rise of Christianity killed off ancient science", or [...] "the medieval Christian Church suppressed the growth of natural philosophy", are all cited by Numbers as examples of widely popular myths that still pass as historical truth, although they are not supported by current historical research.|$|E
50|$|The precise dates {{on which}} festivals are celebrated are often flexible.

Consequently, the traditional times for seasonal celebrations do not agree with <b>the</b> seasons <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Southern Hemisphere or near <b>the</b> equator.

500|$|A week into filming, Francis {{felt the}} {{infected}} (referred to as [...] "Darkseekers" [...] or [...] "hemocytes" [...] in the script), {{who were being}} portrayed by actors wearing prosthetics, were not convincing. His decision to use CGI resulted in an increased budget and extended post-production, although the end results were not always well received. The concept behind the infected was that their adrenal glands were open {{all of the time}} and Lawrence explained, [...] "They needed to have an abandon in their performance that you just can't get out of <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of the night when they're barefoot. And their metabolisms are really spiked, so they're constantly hyperventilating, which you can't really get actors to do for a long time or they pass out." [...] The actors remained on set to provide motion capture. [...] "The film's producers and sound people wanted the creatures in the movie to sound somewhat human, but not the standard", so Mike Patton, lead singer of Faith No More, was engaged to provide the screams and howls of the infected.|$|E
500|$|The video {{does not}} have a {{substantial}} plot and, per Furtado's request, focuses on simultaneously celebrating and parodying the [...] "maneater cliché". It begins with Furtado searching for her runaway Great Dane, Toby, at night in a seemingly deserted industrial district of an unnamed city. She follows the dog to the basement of a dark, dilapidated building, where she encounters a silent crowd of <b>people</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of what MTV News described as a [...] "Fight Club-esque party". Furtado positions herself {{in the middle of the}} crowd and, as the initial beat of the song emerges, begins to dance with [...] "a sense of abandon", according to Furtado. This serves as the catalyst for a dance party that continues as the song plays. Towards the end of the video, Furtado moves to the roof of the building and dances in front of the rising sun. In the end she leaves the party at dawn, finding her dog sitting at the stairhead near the exit. [...] "I like to walk on the dangerous side of life", Furtado said of the filming of the video.|$|E

2500|$|Personality type {{refers to}} the {{psychological}} classification {{of different types of}} people. Personality types are distinguished from personality traits, which come in different degrees. There are many types of theories regarding personality, but each theory contains several and sometimes many sub theories.

[...] Cross-dressing is cited as an abomination in the Bible {{in the book of}} Deuteronomy (22:5), which states: [...] "A woman must not wear men’s clothing, nor a man wear women’s clothing, for the Lord your God detests anyone who does this", but as Aquinas noted above this principle was interpreted to be based on context.
