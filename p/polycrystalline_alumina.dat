40|$|Abstract The Hertzian {{indentation}} {{technique has}} been evaluated {{as a possible}} means of assessing the surface fracture behaviour {{of a set of}} qualitatively similar liquid phase sintered <b>polycrystalline</b> <b>aluminas</b> with systematically varied composition, and a range of grain sizes. The method provides a better correlation between microstructure characteristics and surface fracture behaviour than does Vickers indentation. The fracture toughness determined from Hertzian indentations was found to be a function of grain size, irrespective of the composition of the material. The cumulative probabilities of formation of ring cracks at specific loads during indentation with a spherical indenter were determined for each material from the set of 25 measurements, and the parameters of distribution of the probability of fracture were calculated. A statistical correlation between the failure probability distribution and the size distribution of alumina grains was detected...|$|R
40|$|The {{incorporation}} of silicon carbide (SiC) nanoparticles into <b>polycrystalline</b> <b>aluminas</b> (Al 2 O 3) can produce significant reductions in wear rate [1].

These materials have been wear tested under conditions of wet erosion and the results compared to those of pure Al 2 O 3.

40|$|Internal {{friction}} of high-purity single-crystal sapphire {{and three}} <b>polycrystalline</b> <b>aluminas</b> with different grain sizes has been measured up to very high temperature at {{the frequency of}} 10 Hz. Only an exponential background curve {{was found in the}} single-crystal while polycrystalline specimens showed a broad anelastic peak, superposed on the background component, whose nature was presumably related to the presence of internal grain boundaries. The overall internal friction curve of the polycrystalline specimens were markedly shifted to lower temperatures as compared to sapphire. The intensity of the grain-boundary peak was decreasing with increasing the grain size. A series of alloys, prepared by doping with increasing amounts of Cr 2 O 3, were also tested in comparison with ruby single-crystals. The Cr addition led to both an increase in intensity of the grain-boundary peak and a shift of its maximum towards lower temperatures. This characteristic anelastic behavior was clearly dictated by a lowered coherency of grain boundaries upon Cr alloying...|$|R
40|$|Discrete element method (DEM) was {{introduced}} to simulate crack initiation and propagation of <b>polycrystalline</b> <b>alumina</b> during the brittle model machining process. A bonded particle model (BPM) was employed in the DEM simulations procedure to generate a particle assembly system similar to the micro-structure of the <b>polycrystalline</b> <b>alumina.</b> Particle and parallel bond properties, which were calibrated {{through a series of}} numerical tests, were subsequently used in the simulations of <b>polycrystalline</b> <b>alumina</b> cutting process and scratching tests. It is found that the cracks initiated right under or in front of the machining tool. There were many micro-cracks remained on the machined surface, some of them propagated downwards to form macro-cracks or forwards to lead material removal. Both DEM simulations and acoustic emission measure experiments have found that the fracture became acute when the normal and the tangential force changed suddenly, causing the crack number to increase. In 3 D DEM scratching simulation, the surface cracks length and subsurface cracks depth linearly increased with the scratching depth, the value agreed well with the experimental results, and the surface-damage width decreased gradually with the depth to the surface, looking like half of a coin. ...|$|E
40|$|Optical microscopy, {{scanning}} electron microscopy, {{and transmission}} electron microscopy were employed to examine the interfacial microstructural effects of impurities in alumina substrates used to fabricate alumina-niobium interfaces via liquid-film-assisted joining. Three types of alumina were used: undoped high-purity single-crystal sapphire; a high-purity, high-strength polycrystalline alumina; and a lower-purity, lower-strength <b>polycrystalline</b> <b>alumina.</b> Interfaces formed between niobium and both the sapphire and high-purity <b>polycrystalline</b> <b>alumina</b> were free of detectable levels of impurities. In the lower-purity alumina, niobium silicides were observed at the alumina-niobium interface and on alumina grain boundaries near the interface.

40|$|<b>Polycrystalline</b> <b>aluminas</b> of {{tailored}} {{composition and}} grain size, prepared using liquid-phase sintering aids {{based on the}} Al 2 O 3 -CaO-SiO 2 and Al 2 O 3 -MgO-SiO 2 systems, have been indented at loads close to their critical fracture limit P*, using closely spaced arrays of low-load Vickers indentations. The propagation of cracks caused by indentation is influenced by internal residual stresses at alumina grain boundaries developed during cooling from the processing temperature, and primarily the result of thermal expansion mismatches between the alpha-Al 2 O 3 crystals of the matrix and an intergranular glass of composition related {{to that of the}} sintering aid. The Al 2 O 3 -MgO-SiO 2 system gives a glass of significantly lower expansivity than alpha-Al 2 O 3; hoop tensile stresses are generated at the alumina-alumina boundaries which assist microcrack propagation and the interlinking of lateral cracks from the closely spaced indentations. The converse is the case for the Al 2 O 3 -CaO-SiO 2 system, giving a glass of slightly higher expansivity than alumina, and which generates compressive stresses suppressing crack interlinking.

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} of fracture in <b>polycrystalline</b> <b>alumina</b> were investigated at the grain level using both the micromechanical tests and finite element (FE) model. First, the bending experiments {{were performed on}} the alumina microcantilever beams with a controlled displacement rate of 10 nm s– 1 at the free end; {{it was observed that}} the intergranular fracture dominates the failure process. The full scale 3 D Voronoi cell FE model of the microcantilever bending tests was then developed and experimentally validated to provide the insight into the cracking mechanisms in the intergranular fracture. It was found that the crystalline morphology and orientation of grains {{have a significant impact on}} the localised stress in <b>polycrystalline</b> <b>alumina.</b> The interaction of adjacent grains as well as their different orientations determines the localised tensile and shear stress state in grain boundaries. In the intergranular fracture process, the crack formation and propagation are predominantly governed by tensile opening (mode I) and shear sliding (mode II) along grain boundaries. Additionally, the parametric FE predictions reveal that the bulk failure load of the alumina microcantilever increases with the cohesive strength and total fracture energy of grain boundaries...|$|E

40|$|A new {{material}} {{model for the}} dynamic fracture analysis of anisotropic materials has been proposed {{within the framework of}} the bond-based peridynamic theory. This model enables predicting complex fracture phenomena such as spontaneous crack nucleation and crack branching, curving and arrest, a capability inherited from the bond-based peridynamic theory. An important feature of the model is that the bond properties, i. e. the stiffness constant and critical stretch, are continuous functions of bond orientation in the principal material axes. This facilitates fracture analysis of anisotropic materials with random orientations, such as polycrystalline microstructures. Elastic and fracture behaviour of the model has been verified through simulating uniaxial tension of a composite plate and fracture of a cortical bone compact tension specimen, and making quantitative comparisons to analytical and experimental data. To further demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed model, dynamic fracture of a <b>polycrystalline</b> microstructure (<b>alumina</b> ceramic) has been simulated.

The physical interpretation of the yield point of brittle materials, the Hugoniot clastic limit (HEL), the rate-dependence of this threshold, and the effect of polycrystalline microstructure still remain to be comprehensively explained. Evidence of failure occurring in glasses behind a travelling boundary that follows a shock fkont has been accumulated and verified in several laboratories. Such a boundary has been called a failure wave.

40|$|Chemical vapor {{deposition}} (CVD) from an aerosol {{generated by}} ultrasonic atomization {{was used to}} grow magnesium oxide films on <b>alumina</b> <b>polycrystalline</b> substrates. The precursor was a solution of magnesium acetylacetonate (Mg(acac) 2) in isopropanol. The decomposition of the salt was studied to determine the CVD temperature range. Thermal analysis of the salt by thermogravimetry, differential scanning calorimetry and IR and mass spectrometry enabled a decomposition model of the salt to be determined. Above the melting temperature at 265 °C, Mg(acac) 2 is no longer stable.

40|$|AbstractDuring {{the past}} decade, zirconia-based {{ceramics}} {{have been successfully}} introduced into the clinic to fabricate fixed dental prostheses (FDPs), along with a dental computer-aided/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) system. In this article (1) development of dental ceramics, (2) {{the current status of}} dental CAD/CAM systems, (3) CAD/CAM and zirconia restoration, (4) bond between zirconia and veneering ceramics, (5) bond of zirconia with resin-based luting agents, (6) surface finish of zirconia restoration and antagonist enamel wear, and (7) clinical evaluation of zirconia restoration are reviewed. Yttria partially stabilized tetragonal zirconia polycrystalline (Y-TZP) showed better mechanical properties and superior resistance to fracture than other conventional dental ceramics. Furthermore, ceria-stabilized tetragonal zirconia <b>polycrystalline</b> and <b>alumina</b> nanocomposites (Ce-TZP/A) had the highest fracture toughness and had resistance to low-temperature aging degradation. Both zirconia-based ceramics have been clinically available {{as an alternative to the}} metal framework for fixed dental prostheses (FDPs). Marginal adaptation of zirconia-based FDPs is acceptable for clinical application. The most frequent clinical complication with zirconia-based FDPs was chipping of the veneering porcelain that was affected by many factors. The mechanism for the bonding between zirconia and veneering ceramics remains unknown. There was no clear evidence of chemical bonding and the bond strength between zirconia and porcelain was lower than that between metal and porcelain. There were two alternatives proposed that might avoid chipping of veneering porcelains. One was hybrid-structured FDPs comprising CAD/CAM-fabricated porcelain parts adhering to a CAD/CAM fabricated zirconia framework. Another option was full-contour zirconia FDPs using high translucent zirconia. Combined application of silica coating and/or silane coupler, and 10 -methacryloyloxydecyl dihydrogen phosphate is currently one of the most reliable bonding systems for zirconia. Adhesive treatments could be applied to luting the restorations and fabricating hybrid-structured FDPs. Full-contour zirconia FDPs caused concern about the wear of antagonist enamel, because the hardness of Y-TZP was over double that of porcelain. However, this review demonstrates that highly polished zirconia yielded lower antagonist wear compared with porcelains. Polishing of zirconia is possible, but glazing is not recommended for the surface finish of zirconia. Clinical data since 2010 are included in this review. The zirconia frameworks rarely got damaged in many cases and complications often occurred in the veneering ceramic materials. Further clinical studies with larger sample sizes and longer follow-up periods are required to investigate the possible influencing factors of technical failures...|$|R
