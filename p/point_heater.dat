40|$|Abstract- Turnout {{equipment}} plays a {{vital role}} in the safe operation of railroad systems. It is of great importance in ensuring safety and punctuality, and in the smooth operation of point switching mechanisms. Failure of switching gear due to climatic conditions at their site of installation is a frequent occurrence, in particular, breakdown resulting from the effects of snow and ice or of piled-up snow. To prevent this happening, heating equipment can be installed {{to get rid of the}} ice and snow. Generally speaking, a <b>point</b> <b>heater</b> comprises a heating system, an electricity supply unit, and various kinds of sensor. However, overheating sometimes occurs owing to failures caused by inadequate sensor installation, resulting in the heater becoming unusable. Therefore, a converter is proposed to prevent this overheating by controlling the electricity supply to the heater while detecting the ambient temperature without the use of such sensors...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{develop an}} {{approach}} for measuring in-well fluid velocities using point electrical heating combined with spatially and temporally continuous temperature monitoring using Distributed Temperature Sensing (DTS). The method uses a <b>point</b> <b>heater</b> to warm a discrete volume of water. The rate of advection of this plume, once the heating is stopped, equates {{to the average}} flow velocity in the well. We conducted Thermal-Plume fibre Optic Tracking (T-POT) tests in a borehole in a fractured rock aquifer with the heater at the same depth and multiple pumping rates. Tracking of the thermal plume peak allowed the spatially varying velocity to be estimated up to 50 m downstream from the heating point, depending on the pumping rate. The T-POT technique {{can be used to}} estimate the velocity throughout long intervals provided that thermal dilution due to inflows, dispersion, or cooling by conduction do not render the thermal pulse unresolvable with DTS. A complete flow log may be obtained by deploying the heater at multiple depths, or with multiple point heaters...|$|E

The coil consists of two double pancakes wound with aluminum stabilized cables of the barrel- and end-cap toroids conductors for the ATLAS detector. The magnet current is applied up to 24 kA and quenches are induced by firing <b>point</b> <b>heaters.</b> The normal zone velocity is measured {{over a wide range}} of currents by using pickup coils, voltage taps and superconducting quench detectors. The signals coming from various sensors are presented and analyzed. The results extracted from the various detection methods are in good agreement.

30|$|With the {{objective}} of investigating the variability of indoor CO 2 concentration, the following methodology is applied. The Monte Carlo method is selected, because both uncertainty and sensitivity analyses can be performed with this method. First, the modelling approach and input parameters as well as related uncertainty distributions are defined (“Case study and modelling”). Uncertainties on occupancy schedule, doors and windows opening, and closing times are considered for occupant behaviour variability. Uncertainties on physical parameters include building characteristics such as air leakage and air inlet areas, building parameters such as ventilation flow rate, temperature set <b>point,</b> <b>heater</b> power, and wind pressure coefficients. Afterwards, the Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) method is used to build a sample of model input parameters. Among the different methods available, LHS sampling method has been chosen, since it allows exploring the input parameter space with a relatively reduced sample size. This method is particularly convenient to get a quick estimate of sensitivity indices when a few number of parameters has been selected and model evaluation cost is high [24, 25]. The sampling process is the generation {{of a set of}} model input parameters that will be used to perform the Monte Carlo analysis. For constant physical parameters, values from the sampling are used directly in the simulation. Occupant behaviour scenarios are also constructed from this sample that provides time and level variables. There are no fixed criteria for the sample size depending on the number of parameters. Some authors recommend that sample size should be at least the number of parameters multiplied by a factor of 4 / 3 [16] or 3 / 2 [26, 27]. The chosen size of the sample is here 500 for 178 parameters. LHS is implemented in Python with a matrix generated by the software R [28].|$|E
50|$|It is a point-wise {{self-regulating}} heater and self-limiting heater. Self-regulating means that every <b>point</b> of the <b>heater</b> independently keeps a constant temperature {{without the need}} of regulating electronics. Self-limiting means that the heater can never exceed a certain temperature in any point and requires no overheat protection.|$|R
40|$|It {{is noted}} that for {{parameters}} characterizing the Platteville ionospheric heating facility, the Langmuir wave evolution {{at the exact}} reflection <b>point</b> of the <b>heater</b> wave involves an oscillating two-stream instability followed by a collisionally damped three-dimensional soliton collapse.

5000|$|A {{thermostat}} is {{a simple}} negative feedback controller: when the temperature (the [...] "process variable" [...] or PV) goes below a set <b>point</b> (SP), the <b>heater</b> is switched on. Another example could be a pressure switch on an air compressor. When the pressure (PV) drops below the threshold (SP), the pump is powered. Refrigerators and vacuum pumps contain similar mechanisms operating in reverse, but still providing negative feedback to correct errors.|$|R
40|$|In {{large scale}} superconducting applications, like bending magnets in {{particle}} colliders, thermal stability {{is an important}} issue. A relatively small perturbation of about 100 µJ in a single point can create a small normal zone in the superconductor, which will experience sever joule heating. If the heating exceeds the cooling the normal zone will expand, and vice versa it will collapse. The thermal stability of a superconductor defines the amount of thermal energy required for a point disturbance to initiate an irreversible transition to the normal state. There is little empirical data available on this for the current generation Nb 3 Sn Rutherford cables. This work aims to {{provide an overview of}} the thermal stability in such cables. With the aid of <b>point</b> <b>heaters,</b> the thermal stability is probed at various positions on the cable surface under various operating conditions. It is shown that regardless of the high current density and poor cooling, these cables can recover from a quenched strand by current redistribution when the test conditions are far from the cable limitations. This transition point, where the cable can recover from a single normal strand, is determined for test current and applied magnetic field {{as close as possible to}} the typical operational conditions of a magnet coil within the experimental window. In the center part of a Rutherford cable, the thermal stability is significantly better than at the cable edges. This is due to a reduced RRR and degraded critical current at the thick and thin edges of the cable. The thermal stability decreases when Nb 3 Sn is operated at a lower temperature, i. e. 1. 9 K. Two numerical models and one analytical model are compared to the empirical observations. It is found that none of the models predicts all features of the thermal stability curves with high accuracy...|$|R

40|$|International audienceLegionella pneumophila is {{frequently}} detected {{in hot water}} distribution systems and thermal control is a common measure implemented by health care facilities. A risk assessment based on water temperature profiling and temperature distribution within the network is proposed, to guide effective monitoring strategies and allow the identification of high risk areas. Temperature and heat loss at control <b>points</b> (water <b>heater,</b> recirculation, representative points-of-use) were monitored in various sections of five health care facilities hot water distribution systems and results used to develop a temperature-based risk assessment tool. Detailed investigations show that defective return valves in faucets can cause widespread temperature losses because of hot and cold water mixing. Systems in which water temperature {{coming out of the}} water heaters was kept consistently above 60  °C and maintained above 55  °C across the network were negative for Legionella by culture or qPCR. For systems not meeting these temperature criteria, risk areas for L. pneumophila were identified using temperature profiling and system's characterization; higher risk was confirmed by more frequent microbiological detection by culture and qPCR. Results confirmed that maintaining sufficiently high temperatures within hot water distribution systems suppressed L. pneumophila culturability. However, the risk remains as shown by the persistence of L. pneumophila by qPCR...|$|R

This comb filter is made of three waveguides laid in two different but parallel layers: one is in the lower layer {{and the other two}} are in the upper layer. These two waveguides in upper layer do not cross each other but instead each twice cross over the waveguide in the lower layer. At each crossing <b>point</b> an electrode <b>heater</b> is deposited on the top surface to adjust the coupling ratio between these guides. By supplying power to each heater pair, respectively, the channel spacing can be selected to be either 1. 6 nm or 0. 8 nm; in addition a flat-top spectral response may be obtained at the 1. 6 nm channel spacing if power is supplied to both the heater pairs simultaneously...|$|R

Some factors associated with Legionella contamination were heater type, tank distance and capacity, water plant age, and mineral content. Pseudomonas presence was influenced by water source, hardness, free chlorine, and temperature. Legionella contamination {{was associated with a}} centralized heater, distance from the <b>heater</b> <b>point</b> > 10 m, and a water plant > 10 years old. Furthermore, zinc levels of 50 mg/L appeared to be protective against Legionella colonization.

5000|$|Startup costs: Beyond the 2x-4x larger initial {{purchase}} price (as {{compared to a}} tanked water heater), installing a tankless system comes at an increased cost, particularly in retrofit applications. They tend to be particularly expensive {{in areas such as}} the US where they are not dominant, compared to the established tank design. If a storage water heater is replaced with a tankless one, the installer may have to increase the size of the electrical wiring or gas pipeline to handle the load, and replace the existing vent pipe—possibly adding expense to the retrofit. Many tankless units have fully modulating gas valves that range from as low as 10,000 to over 1,000,000 BTUs. Most electrical installations require AWG 10 or 8 wire, corresponding to 5.5 or 8.5 mm2 for typical POU (<b>point</b> of use) <b>heaters</b> at North American voltages. Larger whole-house electric units may require up to AWG 2 wire. In gas appliances, both pressure and volume requirements must be met for optimum operation.|$|R
40|$|Based on {{a review}} of visual {{observations}} at or near critical heat flux (CHF) under subcooled flow boiling conditions and consideration of CHF triggering mechanisms, presented in a companion paper [Le Corre, J. M., Yao, S. C., Amon, C. H., 2010. Two-phase flow regimes and mechanisms of critical heat flux under subcooled flow boiling conditions. Nucl. Eng. Des. ], a model using a two-dimensional transient thermal analysis of the heater undergoing nucleation was developed to mechanistically predict CHF {{in the case of}} a bubbly flow regime. The model simulates the spatial and temporal heater temperature variations during nucleation at the wall, accounting for the stochastic nature of the boiling phenomena. It is postulated that a high local wall superheat occurring underneath a nucleating bubble at the time of bubble departure can prevent wall rewetting at CHF (Leidenfrost effect). The model has also the potential to evaluate the post-DNB heater temperature up to the <b>point</b> of <b>heater</b> melting. Validation of the proposed model was performed using detailed measured wall boiling parameters near CHF, thereby bypassing most needed constitutive relations. It was found that under limiting nucleation conditions; a peak wall temperature at the time of bubble departure can be reached at CHF preventing wall cooling by quenching. The simulations show that the resulting dry patch can survive the surrounding quenching events, preventing further nucleation and leading to a fast heater temperature increase. The model was applied at CHF conditions in simple geometry coupled with one-dimensional and three-dimensional (CFD) codes. It was found that, within the range where CHF occurs under bubbly flow conditions (as defined in Le Corre et al., 2010), the local wall superheat underneath nucleating bubbles is predicted to reach the Leidenfrost temperature. However, a better knowledge of statistical variations in wall boiling parameters would be necessary to correctly capture the CHF trends with mass flux (or Weber number) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to analyze the {{steady-state}} and transient behavior of the electrical and thermal parameters of thermoelectric generators (TEGs). The focus is on the required wait-time between measurements in order to reduce measurement errors which may appear until the system reaches steady-state. By knowing this waiting time, the total characterization time can also be reduced. The experimental characterization process is performed on a test rig known as TEGeta, which can be used to assess the output characteristics of TEG modules under different load values and temperature conditions. The setup offers the possibility to control the hot side temperature up to 1000 °C with a load variation range value between 0. 22 – 8. 13 Ω. A total of ten thermocouples are placed in the setup with the purpose of measuring the temperature in specific <b>points</b> between the <b>heater</b> and the heat sink. Based on the readings, the temperature on the hot and cold side of the modules can be extrapolated. This study provides quantitative data on the minimum waiting time of the temperatures in the surrounding system to reach equilibrium. Laboratory tests are performed on a calcium-manganese oxide module at temperatures between 400 and 800 °C to explore the high temperatures features of the setup...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe EISCAT {{incoherent}} radar system, {{which is}} collocated with the EISCAT heating facility, {{is used to}} diagnose the ionosphere while heating experiments are conducted. In late September 2002, an experiment was performed in which the heater transmitted a 2 -min-on/ 2 -min-off cycle while its pointing direction was kept fixed and the UHF beam was cycled through five pointing directions. This UHF cycle was used for three heater beam-pointing directions. For field-aligned heater beam and UHF pointing, UHF data indicated a gradual decrease, with time, in the altitude at which enhanced ion-line scatter occurred. This {{was accompanied by a}} reduction in the intensity of the scatter. For field-aligned <b>heater</b> <b>pointing</b> and the UHF elevation angle of 6 ° in the field-aligned direction, a persistent high-amplitude signature was observed, which remained at a fairly constant altitude throughout the period that the heater remained switched on. Different time histories of the backscatter amplitude were observed in other UHF pointing directions, including the "ion-line overshoot", which is characterized by an increase and subsequent decrease in the heater-enhanced backscatter just after heater switch-on. It is suggested that these signatures may be caused by {{the presence or absence of}} field-aligned irregularities and reduced recombination caused by heating. The CUTLASS coherent radar system, which operated simultaneously with the UHF radar and the heater, observed backscatter from field-aligned irregularities created by the heater. The intensity of this backscatter was highest from the regions of the ionosphere that were excited by the central part of the heater beam...|$|R
40|$|During {{the time}} period of February to April, 1979, twelve rod {{extensometers}} and twenty-two convergence measurement points were installed, calibrated and monitored {{in support of the}} spent fuel mine in granite. Readings taken during heading and bench advance shows good instrument stability, with little or no anchor creep or slippage. Repeat calibrations indicate excellent repeatability. Measurement <b>points</b> within the <b>heater</b> drifts indicate little closure. Convergence pins within the spent fuel drift were subjected to significant blast damage that resulted in a discontinuous record. A numerical analysis of the stresses and displacements of the rock mass {{as a result of the}} mine-by was performed. Two methods, finite element and displacement discontinuity, were used to model the mine-by. Comparison of the actual to predicted displacements show good agreement for the 33 {sup 0 } and 50 {sup 0 } extensometers for a rock mass modulus of 3 to 5 x 10 {sup 6 } psi and Poisson`s ratio of. 2. The horizontal extensometers however indicate a convergence of anchor and collar (divergence predicted) and the IRAD stressmeters installed within the pillar indicate a significant reduction in vertical compression during mining of the heading. A simple reduction of pillar modulus will not account for the observed stress and displacement changes. Varying the ratio of vertical to horizontal stress ratio over the range. 8 to 1. 25 also did not account for observed stresses and displacements. It is concluded that the displacements and stresses are a result of block motion or joint slippage within the pillars. This is primarily the result of the small dimensions of the pillars in relation to the spent fuel and heater drifts. This joint slippage can account for the formation of a stable stress arch around the openings and thus a relaxation of the pillar...|$|R
