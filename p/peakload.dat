40|$|Electricity {{production}} from wind generators holds significant importance in European Union’s 20 % renewable energy target by 2020. In this paper, I show that ownership of wind generators affects market outcomes by using both a Cournot oligopoly model {{and a real}} options model. In the Cournot oligopoly model, ownership of the wind generators by owners of fossil-fueled (<b>peakload)</b> generators decreases total <b>peakload</b> production and increases the market price. These effects increase with total wind generation and aggregate wind generator ownership. In the real options model, start up and shut down price thresholds are significantly higher when the monopolist at the <b>peakload</b> level owns both types of generators. Furthermore, when producing electricity with the <b>peakload</b> generator, the monopolist can avoid facing prices below marginal cost by owning a certain share of the wind generators...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} is at {{the crossroads}} of electricity markets, industrial organization and real options literature. The main contribution of the dissertation is to investigate the effects of market power when the strategic producers own a portfolio of generation technologies and have ability to affect prices while facing demand or production uncertainties. The dissertation presents three chapters that deal with the short and long term impacts of market power in the electricity markets. Specifically, the first chapter provides a thorough look at the start up and shut down decisions of the <b>peakload</b> generators and paves way to a better assessment of the extent of the market power of a strategic firm. The second chapter shows the significance of wind power generator ownership on the <b>peakload</b> firms production decisions and market outcomes. Finally, the third chapter investigates how the investment decisions and technology choice differ between fixed and flexible production generators. Overall, this dissertation mainly adopts a real options methodology where the optimal decisions of the producers have a direct impact on the electricity prices contrary to {{the vast majority of the}} real options literature. The first chapter studies the effects of operational characteristics of power plants on optimal dispatch decisions and estimation of market power. Specifically, I give a real options model to show how operational characteristics of power plants and market uncertainty affect start up and shut down decisions. I show that in the case of ownership of multiple generation technologies, optimal dispatch decisions cause capacity withholding for the <b>peakload</b> generator in both the monopoly and the social planner cases. Moreover, the difference between the start up trigger prices for the social planner and the marginal cost reveals significant levels of real options premium. Overall, the existence of significant real options premium levels shows that ignoring market uncertainties and operational characteristics of individual generators, results in overestimating the extent of market power of the firms in the industry. Therefore, I conclude that real options analysis can be an asset for more accurate investigations and decisions on the exercise of market power. The second chapter shifts the focus to the ownership of wind generators as the fixed baseload generation in the first chapter is assumed to be replaced by the stochastic wind generation. Specifically, this chapter investigates the short term effects of wind generator ownership by the owners of fossil-fueled <b>peakload</b> generators. I show that aggregate wind generator ownership reduces the positive impact of the wind generation on the market outcomes and as a result the total <b>peakload</b> production decreases and the market price increases. Furthermore, when all wind generators are owned by the <b>peakload</b> firms, the impact of wind generation on the market outcomes vanishes. Additionally, start up and shut down (suspension) price thresholds are significantly higher when the owner of <b>peakload</b> capacity also owns a share of wind power generators. I also find that a feed-in premium support scheme does not affect the <b>peakload</b> firms production levels and hence the market outcomes. However, under a feed-in tariff type of support scheme, there is an increase in the total production and a decrease in the market price. The third chapter, coauthored with Rune Ramsdal Ernstsen, compares the investment timing and the optimal level of investment for a hypothetical monopolist and a social planner that have a one-time opportunity to invest in a generator with either fixed or flexible production. It specifically investigates how the investment triggers, optimal capacities and technology choices change with the changes to the investment cost function, demand uncertainty and the level of installed capacity in the market. The main contribution of this paper is to document that the choice to invest between generators with fixed or flexible production does not only depend on the differences in costs for different technologies but also on the differences in operation of those technologies. We find that the strategic firm tends to invest at a higher demand trigger level and lower capacity compared to the social planner for both the baseload and the <b>peakload</b> investment cases. Hence, the strategic firm is expected to invest at a later date while incurring lower investment costs. Furthermore, for both the strategic firm and the social planner, fixed baseload generation is preferable during low uncertainty cases whereas high uncertainty tends to result in the choice of flexible <b>peakload</b> generation. We additionally find that highly convex investment costs greatly diminishes the impact of market power on the investment decisions...|$|E

40|$|Abstract In {{this paper}} we study {{the effects of}} {{operational}} characteristics of power plants on optimal dispatch decisions for a monopolist. The first aim {{of this paper is to}} give a mathematical model to show that the operational characteristics and uncertainty result in economic withholding. In this regard, we’ll be able to identify effects of these operational characteristics on the market price. Operational characteristics include: total maximum production capacity, minimum operation level, start-up and shut-down costs. Firms in the industry adjust their production or take start-up/shut-down decisions for their power plants according to realization of industry-wide exogenous demand shocks. We show that in the case of ownership of multiple generation technologies, optimal dispatch decisions will cause economic withholding at <b>peakload</b> level. Therefore, more costly generation unit will start when market price is well above its marginal cost. This result also holds for corresponding social planner’s problem. Hence, we can distinguish between the effects of market power and optimal dispatch decisions on market prices...|$|E
40|$|Background: Due to {{an aging}} {{population}} the incidence of both cardiac and tumor-related illnesses is increasing. A problem may arise if radiotherapy is necessary in close anatomic proximity to an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). These highly precise devices may respond to ionizing radiation {{with a loss of}} function or uncontrolled stimulation, with both effects being potentially life threatening. Available guidelines recommend the dose maximum to a pacemaker to be cumulative below 2 Gy. For most patients undergoing radiation therapy of the neck or of the chest this limit is exceeded, thus making a removal of the device and an implantation of an external ICD necessary. Case Report: A patient with severe cardiac problems underwent an implantation of an ICD. However, a recurrence of a laryngeal cancer was diagnosed. The irradiation dose after resection was 60 Gy to the tumor region and 50 Gy to the lymph nodes. Irradiation <b>peakload</b> to the ICD was calculated to be 2. 5 Gy. This dose was verified with thermoluminescence measurements. The ICD was externally deactivated during the sessions of irradiation. Device checks demonstrated no malfunction. Conclusion: Even though the dose limits of the ICD of 2 Gy were exceeded, the device demonstrated a regular function during and after radiotherapy. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{environmental}} standard review plan (ESRP) directs the staff’s {{review and assessment}} {{of the need for}} new baseload generating capacity. This review should include an assessment of the timing of the need for the additional capacity. The scope of the review directed by this plan should include a comparison of baseload capacity with baseload demand, a reserve margin assessment, projected cost of power, a comparison of total capacity in relation to <b>peakload</b> demand, a schedule evaluation, and an ultimate conclusion regarding the need for the electrical-production capability of the proposed facility. As such, it will draw on ESRPs 8. 2 and 8. 3. In performing this review, the reviewer may rely on the analysis in the applicant’s environmental report (ER) and/or State or regional authorities ’ or Independent System Operators ’ (ISOs’) analyses concerning the need for power and energy supply alternatives after ensuring that the analysis of the need for power and alternatives is reasonable and meets high quality standards. The reviewer of ESRP 8. 4 should consider that substantial amounts of electricity are now bought and sold in competitive wholesale markets by utilities, non-utility power producers, and power marketers and brokers within and between regions across the country and even between U. S. markets and markets in Canada and Mexico. As a result, the relevant area of analysis for this ESRP is likely to include the relevant utility service area, if the proposed project is expected to primarily serve the demand of a specific utility and service area, and a larger market area comprising trading partners of that utility and others in the regional wholesale market area surrounding and/or abutting the utility or power plant site. This larger area may coincide with the area covered by a regional transmission organization (RTO) ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe Iosipescu shear test, {{also known}} as {{asymmetric}} four point bending of a V-notched beam,is frequently used for measuring in-plane shear properties of composites. The ASTM standard(ASTM D- 5379 - 05) regulates how the test is to be performed. It prescribes a notch openingangle of 90 ° independently of the material tested, although this has proven to produceinhomogenous strain distributions in the test region (between the notches) for orthotropicmaterials. Commonly, strain gauges are attached {{in the center of}} the test region where thedeviation from average strain is high. Thus, systematic errors in the measurement in the rangeof 10 % or more may be introduced. The modified Iosipescu shear test, presented in this thesis, uses a variable notch opening angledepending on the material orthotropy and orientation to accomplish even stress- and strainfields in the test region. The variable notch opening angle accommodates both anisotropicmaterials and their orientation. Based on an elastic rescaling theory for orthotropic materials,the geometry was rescaled to recreate the same stress distribution in the test region as forisotropic materials. Specifically the notch opening angle was rescaled depending on theorthotropic ratio, the ratio of the two in-plane principal stiffnesses (Ex/Ey), to obtain theoptimal notch geometry. The rescaling procedure has been verified numerically with FEsimulationsand experimentally for several materials of different orthotropic ratio showingthat this was a very feasible method. Using a whole field optical measurement system duringtesting, significantly more homogenous strain fields were observed than for the standardspecimen geometry. Thus, there is no longer any need for correction factors, relying on FEsimulation,to obtain correct shear moduli. Constitutive shear properties and strength can thusbe more accurately measured, more completely and with fewer sources of error. Notablyhigher shear strengths at larger strains were also recorded compared to standard testing. The function of the new fixture was evaluated and compared with the standard Wyomingfixture. Combined in-situ 3 D deformation measurements of both the new fixture and thespecimen showed that out of plane specimen deformation was very low and substantiallylower than the Wyoming fixture. Thus considerably lower parasitic stresses are introducedwith the new fixture. Recommendations regarding fastening of the specimen were determined based on simpleanalysis combined with FE-calculations and experiments. For both isotropic and orthotropic itwas found favorable if the clamp load used to hold the specimen and the expected net <b>peakload</b> and were set about equal. This reduces the risk of failure outside the test region bycrushing, brushing, splitting and etc. The same effects as shown in the FE-simulations werealso observed experimentally and of similar relative magnitude. Problems with differences in strains arising on the front and back face of the specimen duringtesting have been frequently reported in the literature. This is believed to stem from deviationsfrom nominal specimen geometry such as non-parallel and/or non-perpendicular boundingsurfaces. Three types of these combinations were evaluated numerically and the two mostsignificant were confirmed experimentally. The most critical geometrical deviation assessedwas a specimen with slightly conical cross section in the gripping region. For both isotropicand orthotropic materials, very small deviations from nominal geometry, caused unacceptablylarge errors in measurements of constitutive behavior QC 20100827 </p...|$|E
40|$|As {{a result}} of {{deregulation}} of most power markets around the world electricity price modelling and forecasting have obtained increasing importance in recent years. For the modelling of electricity prices one cannot rely on conventional models used to model stock prices, due to the distinct features of electricity markets. Stylised facts about spot electricity prices have been documented in the literature (Weron 2006) : some examples are multi-scale seasonality, high volatility and spiking behaviour. The peculiar characteristics of electricity prices have induced researchers to develop several models, from linear time series and multivariate regression models to more complex non linear models with jumps. Despite this seemingly large number of models and related empirical analyses {{on a wide range}} of power markets, results are mixing and there is no single model that provides convincing superior performance in forecasting spot prices. This study considers whether combination forecasts of spot electricity prices are statistically superior to a wide range of single model based forecasts. To this end we focus on short-term forecasting since this is of greater concern when dealing with spot prices. We collected half-hourly spot data from the British UKPX (UK Power Exchange) electricity market for the period from April 1, 2005 to September 30, 2006. As it is customary, the 48 half-hourly time series are considered separately: in this work we focus on modelling data corresponding to some periods of the day in order to evaluate the forecasting performance of prices representative of different moments of the day, such as baseload and <b>peakload</b> prices. Several forecasting models for power spot prices are estimated on the basis of rolling estimation windows of different sizes. Included are linear ARMAX models, different specifications of multiple regression models, non linear Markov switching regression models and time-varying parameter regression models. One-day ahead forecasts are obtained for each model and evaluated according to different statistical criteria. As expected, forecasting results highlight that no model globally outperforms the others: differences in forecasting accuracy depend on several factors, such as model specification, the load and forecasting periods. Since different forecasting models seem to capture different features of spot price dynamics, we propose a forecasting approach based on the combination of forecasts. This approach has been useful to improve forecasting accuracy in several empirical situations (see, for example, Becker and Clements 2008; Sánchez 2008), but it is novel in the spot electricity price forecasting context. In this work different strategies have been employed to construct combination forecasts. The simplest approach sets the combinations to be the mean of the constituent forecasts, and is thus an equally weighted combination of the forecasts. An alternative has been to use a regression combination approach, where the combination weights are derived from regression methods. Finally, since the use of a fixed set of weights was deemed to be inappropriate in this context, we focus on an adaptive forecast combination procedure, which allows for time-varying combination coefficients. The results illustrate the usefulness of the procedure, showing that combination forecasts have the potential to produce forecasts of superior accuracy relative to the individual forecasts.
