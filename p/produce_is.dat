5|$|The top of Nescopeck Mountain was {{devoid of}} trees {{by the middle}} of the 1800s. Logging has been done on the ridge in the early 2000s and plans have been made to {{construct}} communication towers on the ridge. Local <b>produce</b> <b>is</b> sometimes traded over Nescopeck Mountain. The mountain is almost completely undeveloped.|$|E
5|$|French cuisine varies {{according}} to the season. In summer, salads and fruit dishes are popular because they are refreshing and <b>produce</b> <b>is</b> inexpensive and abundant. Greengrocers prefer to sell their fruit and vegetables at lower prices if needed, rather than see them rot in the heat. At the end of summer, mushrooms become plentiful and appear in stews throughout France. The hunting season begins in September and runs through February. Game of all kinds is eaten, often in elaborate dishes that celebrate {{the success of the}} hunt. Shellfish are at their peak when winter turns to spring, and oysters appear in restaurants in large quantities.|$|E
5|$|Beaches {{protected}} from tides and storms by coral reefs {{are often the}} best places for housing in tropical countries. Reefs are an important food source for low-technology fishing, both on the reefs themselves and in the adjacent seas. However, despite their great productivity, reefs are vulnerable to over-fishing, {{because much of the}} organic carbon they <b>produce</b> <b>is</b> exhaled as carbon dioxide by organisms at the middle levels of the food chain and never reaches the larger species that are of interest to fishermen. Tourism centered on reefs provides much of the income of some tropical islands, attracting photographers, divers and sports fishermen. However, human activities damage reefs in several ways: mining for construction materials; pollution, including large influxes of fresh water from storm drains; commercial fishing, including the use of dynamite to stun fish and the capture of young fish for aquariums; and tourist damage caused by boat anchors and the cumulative effect of walking on the reefs. Coral, mainly from the Pacific Ocean has long been used in jewellery, and demand rose sharply in the 1980s.|$|E

30|$|The first {{analysis}} parameter is the scalar field. It {{identifies the}} relationship between the energy system and the users of produced energy. It may refer to the territorial scale (the energy <b>produced</b> <b>is</b> intended for large-scale distribution), the urban scale (the energy <b>produced</b> <b>is</b> distributed in the neighborhood) or the housing body scale and/or the structure (the energy <b>produced</b> <b>is</b> used captively for individual buildings and/or the individual artifact itself).|$|R

5|$|Before {{the advent}} of agriculture, humans were hunter-gatherers. They foraged for edible fruit, nuts, stems, leaves, corms, and tubers, {{scavenged}} for dead animals and hunted living ones for food. Forest gardening in a tropical jungle clearing {{is thought to be}} the first example of agriculture; useful plant species were identified and encouraged to grow while undesirable species were removed. Plant breeding through the selection of strains with desirable traits such as large fruit and vigorous growth soon followed. While the first evidence for the domestication of grasses such as wheat and barley has been found in the Fertile Crescent in the Middle East, it is likely that various peoples around the world started growing crops in the period 10,000 BC to 7,000 BC. Subsistence agriculture continues to this day, with many rural farmers in Africa, Asia, South America, and elsewhere using their plots of land to produce enough food for their families, while any surplus <b>produce</b> <b>is</b> used for exchange for other goods.|$|E

25|$|The Eastern Orthodox Church the {{offering}} of first fruits {{takes the form}} of a thanksgiving and blessing. The <b>produce</b> <b>is</b> then consumed by the faithful rather than being given to the Church (though it may be donated as a free-will offering). The liturgical concept behind the blessing is the faithful offering back to God a token of that which he in his lovingkindness has provided, God blessing these firstfruits and returning them to the faithful for their benefit and blessing.|$|E

25|$|Another reason {{minimum wage}} may not affect {{employment}} in certain industries {{is that the}} demand for the product the employees <b>produce</b> <b>is</b> highly inelastic. For example, if management is forced to increase wages, management can pass on the increase in wage to consumers {{in the form of}} higher prices. Since demand for the product is highly inelastic, consumers continue to buy the product at the higher price and so the manager is not forced to lay off workers. Economist Paul Krugman argues this explanation neglects to explain why the firm was not charging this higher price absent the minimum wage.|$|E
