40|$|Although pseudomorphic mineral {{replacement}} {{reactions are}} common in all geological environments, and have long been considered important to many geological processes such as metamorphism, metasomatism, diagenesis, and chemical weathering, their mechanisms are still not well known. We present a combined textural and kinetic study of the replacement of pentlandite, (Fe,Ni) 9 S 8, by violarite (NiFe) 3 S 4, and describe the mechanisms and kinetic behavior of this reaction by considering {{the role of the}} fluid phase, the causes of coupling between pentlandite dissolution and violarite precipitation, the rate-limiting steps controlling the kinetic behavior, and the origin of the length scale of the features preserved during <b>pseudomorphism.</b> The experiments were conducted under mild hydrothermal conditions (80 – 210 °C, vapor saturated pressures). Reaction kinetics shows a complex behavior depending on various physical and chemical parameters including temperature, pH, concentrations of various reaction species, solid-weight-to-fluid-volume-ratio and specific surface area. The rate of replacement (i) increases with temperature from 80 to 125 °C, then decreases as temperature further increases to 210 °C, (ii) first increases then decreases with decreasing pH from pH 6 to 1, (iii) increases with increasing concentration of oxidants such as O 2 (aq), H 2 O 2, and KMnO 4, but decreases with increasing concentration of Ni 2 + and Fe 3 +, and with increasing solid-weight-to-fluid-volume ratio, (iv) increases linearly with the specific surface area. This kinetic behavior as well as the resulting textures revealed a coupled dissolution–reprecipitation reaction mechanism. Nanometer-scale pseudomorphic replacement, through which the crystallographic orientation of pentlandite is inherited by violarite, occurs only between 1 < pH < 6, and spatial coupling between dissolution and reprecipitation is controlled by the local solution chemistry as well as by epitaxial nucleation mediated by the pentlandite substrate. The kinetic results show that pentlandite dissolution is rate-limiting under mild acidic to neutral conditions (1 < pH < 6), while violarite precipitation is rate-limiting under strong acidic conditions (pH 1). The difference in rate-limiting steps influences the coupling mechanism and causes the different degrees of preservation (length scale of <b>pseudomorphism)</b> and different morphologies observed at high and low pHs: pentlandite dissolution being rate-limiting results in nanoscale coupling between dissolution and precipitation and thus nanoscale <b>pseudomorphism</b> (length scale < 20 nm), in which the replacement precisely preserves the morphology and internal details, resembling remarkably the natural pentlandite/violarite assemblages. In contrast, violarite precipitation being rate-limiting results in microscale <b>pseudomorphism</b> (length scale ∼ 10 μm) : the morphology of the pentlandite grains is only roughly preserved and internal details are not preserved. This case study illustrates some general principles of replacement reactions proceeding via the coupled dissolution–reprecipitation mechanism: (i) primary mineral dissolution needs to be rate-limiting compared to the secondary mineral precipitation in order to achieve a high degree pseudomorphic replacement; (ii) the effects of solution composition on reaction kinetics can be qualitatively rationalized by considering the rate-limiting step reaction...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} date any {{geological}} event, suitable mineral geochronometers that record that and only that event must {{be identified and}} analyzed. In the case of metasomatism, recrystallisation is a key process that controls both the petrology and the isotopic record of minerals. It can occur both {{in the form of}} complete neocrystallisation (e. g. in a vein) and in the form of <b>pseudomorphism,</b> whereby dissolution/reprecipitation at the submicroscopic scale plays a central role. Recrystallisation may be complete or not, raising the possibility that relicts of a pre-metasomatic assemblage may be preserved. Because recrystallisation is energetically less costly at almost any temperature than diffusion, and because radiogenic isotopes (except 4 He) never diffuse faster than major elements forming the mineral structure, there is a strong causal link between petrographic relicts and isotopic inheritance (as demonstrated for zircon, monazite, titanite, amphibole, K-feldspar, biotite, and muscovite). Metasomatic assemblages commonly contain such mixtures between relicts and newly formed phases, whose geochronology is slightly more complex than that of simple, ideal systems, but can be managed by techniques that have become routine in the last decade and which are described in this chapter. Because of its crucial role in controlling the isotope systematics, the petrogenesis of a mineral needs to be understood in extreme detail, especially using microchemical analyses and micro-imaging techniques, before mineral ages can be correctly interpreted.

40|$|Although pseudomorphic mineral {{replacement}} {{reactions are}} common in all geological environments and many industrial processes, {{few studies have been}} devoted to understanding the mechanisms and kinetics of these reactions. The subjects of this thesis are to understand the mechanisms and kinetics of pseudomorphic replacement reactions by detailed experimental studies on model systems, and to apply the principle of these reactions in the syntheses of novel materials. The mechanisms of pseudomorphic replacement reactions were revealed by a thorough kinetic and textural study of the replacement of pentlandite, (Fe,Ni) ₉S₈, by violarite (Ni,Fe) ₃S₄, under mild hydrothermal conditions (80 °C to 210 °C). Reaction kinetics shows a complex dependence on various physical and chemical parameters including temperature, sample texture of mineral assemblage, pH, and concentrations of various reaction species (e. g., oxidants, metal ions). Textural observations show a sharp phase boundary and a porous product. Both kinetic and textural results indicate a coupled dissolution–reprecipitation mechanism. The coupling between pentlandite dissolution and violarite precipitation is controlled by local solution chemistry as well as the epitaxial nucleation of violarite onto the pentlandite substrate. The latter was confirmed by electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) analysis that pentlandite and violarite share a common crystallographic orientation. The rate limiting step depends on solution chemistry and controls the degree and length scale of pseudomorphism: pentlandite dissolution being rate limiting at mild acidic to neutral conditions (1 < pH < 6) results in high degree <b>pseudomorphism</b> (length scale < 20 nm), of which violarite precisely preserves not only the overall morphology but also textural details (e. g., lamellae) of pentlandite; while violarite precipitation being rate limiting in strong acidic conditions (pH 1) the reactions produces low degree <b>pseudomorphism</b> (length scale ~ 10 μm), of which the overall morphology is only roughly preserved without preservation of textural details. The principle of pseudomorphic replacement reactions have been applied to the syntheses of two complex thiospinels, violarite, (Ni,Fe) ₃S₄, and linnaeite, Co₃S₄. Violarite is very difficult to prepare by the traditional dry synthesis route, which requires several months’ annealing and still only results in an impure product. By contrast, pure violarite was synthesized by hydrothermal pseudomorphic replacement within a few days, and the composition is tunable by simply changing temperature, the compositions of the solution and of the pentlandite precursor. Pseudomorphic replacement reactions have also been applied to the syntheses of zeolite monoliths composed of three-dimensional ordered arrays of nanocrystals with uniform size and crystallographic orientation. Such materials have potential applications but have never been prepared. This work demonstrates that pseudomorphic replacement reactions are suitable routes for this purpose by synthesizing monoliths of analcime (NaAlSi₂O₆. H₂O) as an illustration using natural leucite (KAlSi₂O₆) crystals as precursors. The leucite crystals have inherent three-dimensional hierarchical structure of uniformly sized lamellar twins arising from the cubic to tetragonal phase transition. Such uniform lamellar texture was precisely preserved during hydrothermal pseudomorphic replacement reactions in pH buffered NaCl solutions, resulting in three-dimensionally ordered arrays of cubic analcime nanocrystals. Moreover, these analcime nanocrystals have uniform size and crystallographic orientation, which is due to epitaxial nucleation and growth controlled by the leucite precursors. Pseudomorphic mineral replacement reactions make possible the syntheses of zeolites monoliths with very sophisticated shapes and could be used to synthesize other advanced functional materials.

At low temperatures, olivine serpentinization modifies the petrophysical and geochemical {{properties of the}} oceanic lithosphere. Under these conditions olivine generally fails to compositionally readjust via diffusion and re-equilibrates via dissolution-reprecipitation. Although plastic deformation and serpentinization are decoupled, we identified compositional readjustments expressed as striped zonings in partially serpentinized and deformed olivine grains from the Leka Ophiolite Complex (LOC), Norway. Combining focused ion beam sample preparation and (scanning) transmission electron microscopy reveals that every zone is immediately related to a subgrain boundary composed of edge dislocations. The zonings {{are a result of}} the Fe-Mg exchange potential between olivine and antigorite, where Fe enrichment or depletion is controlled by the silica activity imposed on the system by orthopyroxene and magnetite stability. Nanometer-sized serpentine precipitates along olivine dislocation walls and crystallographic relationships gained by electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) suggest that hydration was also initiated along these intracrystalline imperfections. The legacy of pre-existing microstructures in the LOC is exhibited by localized occurances of parallel but highly misorientated olivine grains seperated by plastically deformed diopside lamellae. Microtomography combined with EBSD suggest that these areas are a consequence of a hydration-dehydration sequence to result in a complex <b>pseudomorphism</b> of primary mantle orthopyroxene to olivine and the cryptic survival of the primary microstructure. Our observations provide new insights into the role of primary microstructures and crystal-plastic deformation on subsequent fluid-mediated reactions. 1 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Direct {{conversion}} Of MoO 3 to molybdenum carbides by temperature-programmed reaction (TPR) with a reacting {{gas mixture}} of CH 4 / 4 H(2) {{has been studied}} {{in the presence of}} a transition metal selected from Pt, Pd, Ni, Co, Cu, and pre-synthesized Mo 2 C loaded on MoO 3. Loading of the metals reduced the temperatures of MoO 3 reduction and increased the specific surface area of produced carbides. However, the obtained phase of molybdenum carbides differed depending on the employed transition metal; Pt, Pd, or Ni produced cubic alpha-MoC 1 -x, while Co, Cu, or pre-synthesized Mo 2 C formed hexagonal beta-Mo 2 C, which was the same phase as that produced from the direct transformation Of MoO 3 itself without any metal loading. The nature of transition metals loaded on MoO 3 also led to different TPR patterns for the transformation to molybdenum carbide, suggesting that different reaction routes were involved. Thus, MoO 3 loaded with Co, Cu, or Mo 2 C showed TPR patterns similar to that of MoO 3 itself, except for slightly lower temperatures for the initiation of the reduction. With these metals, the transformation Of MoO 3 to carbides followed a nontopotactic route involving the MoO 2 intermediate phase. By contrast, loading of Pt, Pd, or Ni to MoO 3 drove MoO 3 reduction into a topotactic transformation through a MoOxCy intermediate phase.

40|$|Many {{aspects of}} crystal {{morphology}} modeling are studied in this thesis. Most important of all, is {{the dependence of}} crystal growth on supersaturation [...] the driving force for crystallization [...] which not only influences the crystal morphology, but also polymorphism and nucleation. It is shown that an unusual type of epitaxial growth can take place beyond a threshold supersaturation in the crystallization of a model steroid. The same compound shows <b>pseudomorphism</b> upon crystallization from the vapor phase. Modeling {{studies show that the}} two structures are related polytypically. The experimental morphology of gibbsite could be explained through the analysis of effective edge energies of two-dimensional nuclei on the crystal surfaces. For this, the program MONTY is extremely useful. It uses the concept of the crystal graph, a description of the interactions between the growth units in the crystal. It allows Monte Carlo crystal growth simulations in any crystallographic direction. The analyses on three fat morphologies support the idea that not the attachment energy is the relevant parameter for the growth rate of a crystal surface, but rather the edge energy of two-dimensional nuclei on the surfaces. Needle formation is explained by the systematic absences of barriers for 2 D nucleation in all but a few crystallographic orientations. For paracetamol, growth simulations show that a supersaturation dependence can be reproduced quite convincingly using the experimentally determined growth mechanisms for the respective surfaces. Finally. a hypothesis is studied that the morphology of the (sub-) critical nucleus resulting from a certain polymorphic structure must determine the effective barrier of formation of that nucleus, therefore determining the probability of formation of that polymorph. A model is derived and tested on a series of well-known polymorphic structures. It is shown that, indeed, a small majority of the compounds studied produce crystal structures with relatively high levels of isotrop...|$|E
40|$|Ordered {{mesoporous}} silicas such as micelle-templated silicas (MTS) feature unique textural {{properties in}} addition to their high surface area (1000 m 2 /g) : narrow mesopore size distributions and controlled pore connectivity. These characteristics are highly relevant to chromatographic applications for resistance to mass transfer, which has never been studied in chromatography because of the absence of model materials such as MTS. Their synthesis is based on unique self-assembly processes between surfactants and silica. In order {{to take advantage of the}} perfectly adjustable texture of MTS in chromatographic applications, their particle morphology has to be tailored at the micrometer scale. We developed a synthesis strategy to control the particle morphology of MTS using the concept of pseudomorphic transformation. <b>Pseudomorphism</b> was recognized in the mineral world to gain a mineral that presents a morphology not related to its crystallographic symmetry group. Pseudomorphic transformations have been applied to amorphous spherical silica particles usually used in chromatography as stationary phases to produce MTS with the same morphology, using alkaline solution to dissolve progressively and locally silica and reprecipitate it around surfactant micelles into ordered MTS structures. Spherical beads of MTS with hexagonal and cubic symmetries have been synthesized and successfully used in HPLC in fast separation processes. MTS with a highly connected structure (cubic symmetry), uniform pores with a diameter larger than 6 nm in the form of particles of 5 m could compete with monolithic silica columns. Monolithic columns are receiving strong interest and represent a milestone in the area of fast separation. Their synthesis is a sol-gel process based on phase separation between silica and water, which is assisted by the presence of polymers. The control of the synthesis of monolithic silica has been systematically explored. Because of unresolved yet cladding problems to evaluate the resulting macromonoliths in HPLC, micromonoliths were synthesized into fused-silica capillaries and evaluated by nano-LC and CEC. Only CEC allows to gain high column efficiencies in fast separation processes. Capillary silica monolithic columns represent attractive alternatives for miniaturization processes (lab-on-a chip) using CEC...|$|E
40|$|Extensive {{compositional}} heterogeneity {{is displayed}} by Pb-Sb-Au tellurides from the type locality at S ǎ c ǎ rîmb. These phases are collectively considered as varieties of nagyágite {{in the absence}} of crystal chemical data confirming the presence of distinct, but topologically closely related compounds. Chemical heterogeneity is seen relative to ‘normal’ nagyágite, with close to the ideal composition Pb 3 [Pb 1. 8 (Sb 1. 1,As 0. 1) 1. 2]Σ 3 S 6 (AuTe 2), which is the primary and common type in the deposit. A modified formula, (Pb 3 S 3) [(Pb 2 −x) (Sb,As,Te b) 1 +x (S 3 −y Te y) ]Σ 6 (Au 1 −z−w Te 2 +z S w), accounts for the chemical variation observed. Values of x (0. 2 to 1. 15) express substitution of Pb by Sb+As for Me 2 in sulfosalt modules in the case of Au-depleted and low-Au nagyágite, and by Sb+As+Te b in high-As and low-Pb varieties (b = x+ 1 −(Sb+As) = 0. 24 to 0. 29). Excess Te compensates for Au deficiency in the telluride layer, with substitution by S also observed; empirical values of z and w are 0 to 0. 45 and 0 to 0. 32, respectively. Minor substitution of Te for S (y < 0. 17) is noted in all varieties except low-Au. These varieties are formed during replacement of the ‘normal’ type as seen in overprinting relationships in those veins reactivated during rotation of the duplex fault-system responsible for vein formation. Replacement is by coupled dissolution-reprecipitation reactions, as indicated by <b>pseudomorphism</b> of one nagyágite type by another in all cases. Variable rates of both molar-excess and -deficit reaction are invoked to explain the observed chemical and textural modifications. Low-Pb nagyágite is also present in zoned platelets where it grows over resorbed cores of ideal composition. Such platelets are instead interpreted as products of self-patterning in a residual precipitate. A marked depletion in the Au content of some nagyágite lamellae {{is considered to be a}} diffusion driven Te for Au substitution in the presence of Te-bearing fluid. Replacement of ‘normal’ nagyágite by other varieties can be linked to high fluid acidity, whereas replacement by galena-altaite symplectites relates to changes in the fTe 2 /fS 2 within a narrow domain defined by coexistence of these two minerals. Nagyágite is a mineral with modular crystal chemistry and is able to adjust to variable rates of fluid infiltration by subtle chemical substitutions. The behavior of nagyágite will map and assist coupling between dissolution and precipitation during such reactions. C. L. Ciobanu, N. J. Cook, A. Pring, G. Damian and N. Căprar...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{attempted}} to expand existing understanding of accessory mineralization evolution of rare metal-granite series at post-magmatic stage of their development and formation of associated hydrothermal deposits. Composition {{and distribution of}} rare elements of Verkhneurmiysk ore cluster have been examined from the position of mineralogy: the study focused on accessory and ore minerals Sn, W, Nb, Ta, Bi, Y, rare earth elements in rare metal Li-F granites and associated metasomatites. It has been discovered that accessory magmatic and hydrothermal mineral complexes share the same geochemical features, are formed under the leading role of abovementioned elements and consistently follow each other over time. It has been traced how mineral forms of accumulation of Sn, W, Nb, Ta, Y and rare earth elements evolve in the processes of magmatic crystallization and post-magmatic metasomatism in the time series: rare metal granites → zwitters → tourmalinites → chloritites. Mineral rocks of each stage were noted to inherit mineralogical and geochemical distinctions from the rocks of the previous stage. A significant number of minerals, forming {{in the course of}} two-three stages, have been discovered, as well as omnipresent magmagene-hydrothermal minerals. For a number of accessory minerals of rare metal granites post-magmatic generations have been identified. Special diversity among accessories of rare metal granites and zwitters was observed in tungsten, tin and bismuth minerals. Composition of Verkhneurmiysk ore cluster mineralization is in many aspects similar to the one of metasomatic accessory minerals of rare metal granites. Tungsten-tin deposits of Verkhneurmiysk ore cluster are polyformational and combine mineralogical features of cassiterite-quartz and cassiterite-silicate formations. Evolution of mineral forms of the key rare elements (Sn, W, Bi, Nb, Ta, rare earth elements) points to a genetic link between tungsten-tin mineralization of zwitter-tourmalinite formation and rare metal Li-F granites of the region. The evidence of that is a specific genetic category of accessory materials, formed as a result of <b>pseudomorphism</b> of protominerals, – transformational minerals or metasomatic accessory minerals. The list of metasomatic accessories includes exactly those minerals which are considered indicators of ore generation capacity of Far Eastern leucogranites: cassiterite, wolframite, scheelite, a number of sulphides. Similar qualitative composition of magmatic and post-magmatic minerals demonstrates metallogenic specialization of parent granite magma. Predicted mineragenic significance of research in the field of mineral forms evolution of rare elements accumulation in ore-bearing granites and metasomatites is associated with possibilities to assess metallogenic specialization of parent granite magma. Understanding of accessory paragenesis evolution should serve as a base for exploration geo-technologies in the Far East metallogenic province...|$|E
40|$|The Riverton Iron Formation is chert-siderite facies of Proterozoic Superior-Type Iron Formation {{within the}} Paint River Group, Marquette Range Supergroup, of the Upper Penninsula, Michigan. It is 90 to 250 m thick, {{underlain}} by the 150 to 450 m thick Dunn Creek Slate Formation, and overlain successively by the 15 to 150 m thick Hiawatha Greywacke Formation, the 30 to 60 m thick Stambaugh Formation of siderite-and magnetite-bearing slate, and the 1200 m thick Fortune Lakes Slate Formation. The Dunn, Hiawatha, Stambaugh, and Fortune Formations are variably pyritic and sideritic shale, chert, siltstone, and greywacke. The Paint River Group {{is in the}} greenschist facies of regional metamorphism and in tight, steeply northwest-plunging folds and open to tight, gently east-plunging folds. Granitoid intrusions which are syn- to post-deformation and metamorphism are ca. 1. 85 Ga, {{the age of the}} Penokean orogeny.;There are minor discordant quartz veins with chlorite, stilpnomelane, pyrite, and trace chalcopyrite in all formations of the Paint River Group. These veins are both parallel and discordant to faults and fold axes attributed to the Penokean orogeny. Veins are interpreted as syn- to post-orogenic. There are no significant concentrations of metals in these veins.;Chert-siderite facies of the Riverton Iron Formation has 20 to 30 % iron. However, locally iron ore bodies with more than 50 % iron are (i) predominantly hematite and goethite, (ii) in axes of plunging synclines with footwall aquicludes, (iii) undeformed, and (iv) of lower metamorphic grade than the regional greenschist facies.;Formation of iron ore is interpreted as a two stage process of (i) widespread <b>pseudomorphism</b> of siderite by hematite and goethite and (ii) dissolution of chert and replacement by hematite and goethite. Because quartz veins of Penokean age are pseudomorphed by hematite and goethite, the iron orebodies are younger. They most likely formed when the water table was lowered because of uplift of the Paint River Group on the south ridge and flank of the Keweenawan Rift at about 1. 1 Ga and, meteoric water was acidified by pyrite oxidation and ferrolysis in pyrite-beating slate and iron formation of the hanging wall. Hence they represent supergene oxidation of primary chert-siderite iron formation.;Primary iron formation and iron ores do not contain significant concentrations of metals other than iron because (i) the primary iron formation is essentially a chemogenic, ferriferous, siliceous precipitate from seawater, devoid of metals other than iron (ii) there were no hypogene metal concentrations superimposed on the iron formation during the Penokean orogeny, which caused only low grade metamorphism and minor to nil plutonism and hydrothermalism in the Paint River Group...|$|E
40|$|The {{rocks in}} the contact aureole of the Mooselookmeguntic pluton were {{multiply}} deformed and metamorphosed during the Acadian orogeny. The metamorphism occurred at low pressure and high temperature with isograds following the pluton contours. A maximum temperature of 600 °C at around 4 Kbrs has been determined from rocks from the lower sillimanite zone. The widespread assemblage Grt+St+And suggests that the pressure {{must have been in}} the 3 - 4 Kbr interval while the temperature varied with the pluton proximity. The sporadic appearance of cordierite porphyroblasts towards the SE indicates slight decompression and possibly the beginning of exhumation. Most porphyroblasts have been variably prograde or retrograde pseudomorphed. The nature of <b>pseudomorphism</b> occurred as a function of pluton proximity while the distribution of pseudomorphs was strictly controlled by the structural fabric. Pseudomorphs have formed only in rocks with steeply dipping foliation trending at high angle to the pluton. Measurement of the foliation inflexion/intersection axes (FIAs) in garnet and staurolite porphyroblasts has revealed that at least five successive periods of growth of these phases have occurred. A succession of 5 different FIA sets for garnet and staurolite porphyroblasts have been interpreted using samples that preserve changes in FIAs trend from core to rim and trend successively NNW-SSE, ESE-WNW, E-W, ENE-WSW and NESW. Staurolite cores with NW–SE trending FIAs are succeeded by N-S, E-W and ENE-WSW rims. N-S trending FIA cores and pre-FIAs are succeeded by NE-SW rims. E-W trending FIAs cores are succeeded by ENE-WSW medians/rims and NE-SW rims. ENE-WSW trending cores are succeeded by NE-SW trending rims. The inclusion trail pitches have been measured in 3 D from all staurolite porphyroblasts using vertically oriented thin sections. Most staurolite porphyroblasts overgrew steeply dipping foliations that have similar trends to the FIAs. Monazite dating of staurolite porphyroblasts from each FIA set revealed a continuous period of growth of this phase from 420 Ma to less than 350 Ma. Individual age peaks have been determined at 408 ± 10 Ma for FIA set 2, at 388. 0 ± 8. 8 Ma for FIA set 3, at 372. 1 ± 5. 5 Ma for FIA set 4 and at 352. 7 ± 4. 2 Ma for FIA set 5. Although, the age of FIA set 1 could not be measured it is assumed to have formed between 430 and 415 my.

40|$|The Boqueirão {{pegmatite}} {{is located}} in the Borborema Pegmatite Province in the state of Rio Grande do Norte (NE Brazil) hosted by Neoproterozoic taconglomerates of Equador Formation. The pegma tite occurs as a concentric body displaying characteristic units according their mineralogy. The border and wall zones are composed by quartz, microcline and muscovite often displaying skeletal and graphic textures with accessory tourmaline and garnet. The intermediate zone is divided in two distinct subzones and shows a complex mineralogy exhibiting a varied phosphate association, beryl, columbite -tantalite and zircon. The innermost zone is mainly constituted by a quartz core. In addition, typical replacement bodies of albite are recognized at {{the eastern part of the}} body. Lithiophilite triphylite represents the most abundant phosphate phase exhibiting exsolutions of sarcopside and replaced by sicklerite due to Lileaching alteration, best known as Quensel Mason sequence. The scarcity of heterosite -purpurite series is remarkable. Montebrasite and triplite are also primary phosphates observed. Subsequently,the presence of alluaudite and varulite occurrences suggests that Na-metasomatism affected the pegmatite. The whole ensemble is crosscut by an extensive alteration that resulted in secondary phosphate minerals. Electron microprobe data of triphylite-lithiophilite shows Mn/(Mn+Fe) ratios between 0. 21 - 0. 24 but also up to 0. 72 which seems to indicates that the earlier pegmatite magma could be slightly fractionated; consequently,ferrisicklerite shows Mn/(Mn+Fe) values between 0. 69 - 0. 77 in agreement with high evolution degree and suggesting that <b>pseudomorphism</b> may be produced by high rock/fluid ratios. Alluaudite and varulite also record Mn and Fe contents up to 0. 71 similar to precursor phosphates. Furthermor eight different secondary phosphates have been identified as replacement of primary phases either as pseudomorphs or crosscutting them. They form euhedral crystals of fine grain size, spherulites or extensive masses displaying vivid colours which are ea sily identifiable. Manrich secondary phases are hureaulite, eosphorite, whiteite, jahnsite and serrabrancaite while lipscombite, phosphosiderite and mitridatite correspond to Ferich secondary association. Supergenic late origin and entrance of Ca-K,Mgrich fluids from host rock may be invoked in order to explain their formation. They do not show any relationship with processes of pegmatite crystallization. Hf content of zircon from the intermediate zone has been analysed by electron microprobe as a pow erful indicator of pegmatite evolution degree together with Mn content of phosphates. Hf content obtained is low up to 5 % wt. of HfO which which points out to low fractionated pegmatite magma. Besides, the presence of ferromagnesian silicates forming the pegmat ite units such as Ferich tourmaline, garnet and green beryl is in agreement of that hypothesis. Therefore, Boqueirão corresponds to rare element pegmatite of beryl columbite phosphate subtype...|$|E
40|$|We {{examine the}} partial {{survival}} of high-temperature mantle microstructures throughout multi-stage hydration- and dehydration-mediated <b>pseudomorphism</b> at differing pressure-temperature-fluid conditions. Throughout the harzburgitic mantle {{section of the}} Leka Ophiolite Complex (Norway), finite domains of parallel olivine encompassed by mesh-textured olivine resembling 'perfectly cleaved' olivine grains were identified. Crystallographic orientation mapping, combined with micro-computed tomography, reveals that the parallel olivine grains are highly misoriented (up to 90 °) with no crystal-preferred orientation, despite remaining parallel in three dimensions. Parallel olivine grains exhibit free dislocations with low dislocation density, whereas within mesh-textured olivine dislocations are aligned into walls. MnO is enriched (up to 1 · 8 wt %) and NiO depleted (0 · 21 ± 0 · 24 wt %) within parallel olivine grains compared with mesh-textured olivine (0 · 29 ± 0 · 14 wt % MnO; 0 · 38 ± 0 · 19 wt % NiO). Clinopyroxene lamellae that are crystal-plastically deformed occur sandwiched in lizardite layers between every parallel olivine grain or fully enclosed within olivine. Al₂O₃ and Cr₂O₃ concentrations of clinopyroxene lamellae (2 · 09 ± 0 · 88 wt % Al₂O₃; 0 · 79 ± 0 · 27 wt % Cr₂O₃) overlap with those of primary clinopyroxene grains (2 · 43 ± 0 · 69 wt % Al₂O₃; 0 · 83 ± 0 · 36 wt % Cr₂O₃) and are distinctly {{different from those of}} secondary diopside found within the parallel olivine domains. Intragranular serpentine inclusions (XMg = 0 · 95 ± 0 · 01), displaying elevated Al₂O₃ (3 · 92 ± 4 · 10 wt %) and Cr₂O₃ (0 · 78 ± 0 · 82 wt %) concentrations, are exclusively found within parallel olivine grains. Lizardite (XMg = 0 · 92 ± 0 · 02) within the domains originates from hydration of parallel olivine and compositionally overlaps with mesh-texture lizardite. Antigorite (XMg = 0 · 95 ± 0 · 01) replaces both types of olivine grains. Whole-rock compositions indicate a harzburgitic composition; however, microstructural and chemical observations and the current absence of primary orthopyroxene suggest that the precursor silicate of every parallel olivine domain was a single orthopyroxene grain that was initially serpentinized and later dehydrated to result in the present microstructure. Although desilicification is necessary during the transformation of orthopyroxene to olivine via a bastite stage, calculations based on whole-rock compositions imply that the released SiO₂(aq) was mobile only over micrometer to centimeter scales, reacting with the surrounding olivine directly to form serpentine. Crosscutting relationships and serpentine compositions imply that dehydration occurred prior to the now evident lizardite- and antigorite-serpentinization. Comparison with the regional geological setting indicates that dehydration may have occurred transiently within the oceanic lithosphere prior to obduction. 26 page(s...|$|E
40|$|The {{history of}} chromatographic theory {{has always been}} driven to the {{development}} of smaller particles. The use of smaller more uniform particle diameters results in more effective separations and faster optimal mobile phase velocities, therefore producing lower plate heights; consequently the use of sub 2 micron silica particles has delivered {{a significant impact on the}} practice of high pressure liquid chromatography. The main issue with sub 2 micron silica particles however, is related to their manufacture. It is difficult to produce such highly specialised materials homogeneously and there are only a handful of methods in the literature. This dissertation outlines work that is intended to improve our technical knowledge of this subject by studying the synthesis (of both non porous and totally porous) spherical silica particles to drive improvements. Further investigations into surface functionalisation as well as column packing are also studied. Several experimental tools have been developed to drive improvements to the manufacture of such materials. For example, the experimental challenges necessitated the development and implementation of the following in this work; Full evaluation of the experimental and technical requirements of the Stöber reaction to produce good quality particles greater than one micron in diameter. 2.

Investigation of column packing’s via computer simulation. On the basis of this works experimental data, it is concluded that good quality non porous and totally porous spherical silica particles can be produced from the ethanol/water/ammonia hydrolysis system of the Stöber reaction up to two microns in diameter with a narrow particle size distribution. Key experimental procedures that are often overlooked in the literature have been highlighted to facilitate successful reactions. The resultant materials can be used for future column packing’s or as starting materials for the production of superficially porous materials. The use of microwave irradiation was shown to dramatically improve surface functionalisation reaction times whilst incorporating reduced solvent volumes and reduced energy expenditure. Reaction times of five minutes were shown to produce packing’s possessing the level of surface coverage associated with commercially produced phases (3 μmoles/m 2) which traditionally use disordered heating methods such as reflux with long reaction times. The use of microwave “superheating” or slightly longer reaction times of 20 minutes further increased the overall bonding density. Computer simulation of commercial packing’s showed the influence of large particles within the distribution on bed formation. Larger particles are pushed towards the top of the column chamber by the sedimentation of smaller particles. This effect is completely analogous to the phenomenon of “The Brazil nut effect”. More uniform packing’s would reduce the overall impact. This work improves our understanding of the complex nature of HPLC column phase synthesis as well as provides new tools for future research...|$|E
