40|$|Summary. [...] Investigations into {{porpoising}} stability, water resistance, and seaworthiness {{have been}} made on the hull design of the E 6 / 44. The original lines were unsatisfactory for seaworthiness and porpoising stability at overload and modifications to improve these qualities {{have been made}}. Results on the final lines indicate that porpoising stability should be adequate at all loads up to the design overload, and take-off time should be well within the specified Iimit. Seaworthiness tests show that the limiting condition for satisfactory operation at normal load is a 2 -ft sea. The hump ' spray is severe and due to likelihood of damage, full advantage of flaps may not be gained unless a <b>preselector</b> <b>control</b> be used. 1. I~troduction. [...] Tank tests were required to provide data for the design {{and development of the}} Saunders-Roe jet-propelled boat-seaplane fighter. The prototype hulls were to be conventional, developed from the firm's S. 37 lines and the shetland lines, with a straight Vee-step of included angle 120 deg, faired in elevation. Eventually a step faired in plan-form was to be considered. This report describes the development of the hull lines with the straight Vee-step, and includes the results of porpoising stability, resistance, and seaworthiness tests. 2. Description of Aircraft. [...] The E 6 / 44 is a single-seat high-wing boat-seaplane fighter designe...|$|E
