5|$|First officially {{described}} by Carl Linnaeus in his 1753 Species Plantarum, Hydnum repandum was sanctioned by Elias Fries in 1821. The species has been shuffled to several genera: Hypothele by Jean-Jacques Paulet in 1812; Dentinum by Samuel Frederick Gray in 1821; Tyrodon by Petter Karsten in 1881 Sarcodon by Lucien Quélet in 1886. After a 1977 nomenclatural <b>proposal</b> <b>by</b> mycologist Ronald H. Petersen was accepted, Hydnum repandum became the official type {{species of the}} genus Hydnum. Previously, supporting arguments for making H.repandum the type were made by Marinus Anton Donk (1958) and Petersen (1973), while Zdeněk Pouzar (1958) and Kenneth Harrison (1971) thought that H.imbricatum should be the type.|$|E

Afterwards, the Fascist government raised the national tricolour flag along with a Fascist black flag in public ceremonies.|$|E
5|$|In early 1960, Eisenhower {{indicated}} {{his support}} for a comprehensive test ban conditional on proper monitoring of underground tests. On 11 February 1960, Wadsworth announced a new US <b>proposal</b> <b>by</b> which only tests deemed verifiable by the Geneva System would be banned, including all atmospheric, underwater, and outer-space tests within detection range. Underground tests measuring more than 4.75 on the Richter scale would also be barred, subject to revision as research on detection continued. Adopting Macmillan's quota compromise, the US proposed each nuclear state be subject to roughly 20 on-site inspections per year (the precise figure based on the frequency of seismic events).|$|E

Another <b>proposal</b> <b>by</b> Waters in 1983 suggested highstands 700-900, 940-1210 and after 1250, the latter with some brief recessions to lower lake levels.

The <b>proposal</b> <b>by</b> Dutch journalist Anton Witkamp, a football match between the holders of the European Cup and Cup Winners' Cup, failed to receive UEFA's backing, given the recent Cup Winners' Cup winners Rangers had been banned from European competition. Witkamp nonetheless proceeded with his vision, a two-legged match played between Ajax and Rangers in January 1973. The competition was endorsed and recognised by UEFA a year later.|$|E
