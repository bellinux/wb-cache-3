Then by-and-by we can build good houses and have plenty to eat. This is right, for you have destroyed our game--and you will not let us go to the mountains to hunt. You must do something besides furnish us <b>ploughs</b> <b>in</b> a <b>land</b> where the rain does not come." ...|$|R

5000|$|The {{cartographer}} Samuel Lewis, in his 1849 {{edition of}} A Topographical Dictionary of Wales, recorded that [...] "the inhabitants have a tradition, {{that there were}} formerly a church and a considerable town at Tregeiriog; and <b>in</b> <b>ploughing</b> the <b>land,</b> quantities of large paving stones have been thrown up at different times, which {{seemed to have been}} placed in regular order: the name of a farm, Pen-yr-hôwl, the [...] "head of the street," [...] is also adduced in corroboration".|$|R
25|$|Before the {{outbreak}} of war, Henderson-Stewart sought {{to ensure that the}} system of National Service in the armed services worked smoothly; in November 1939, he criticised the operation of the scheme in calling up agricultural workers when the government was calling for farmers to <b>plough</b> more <b>land.</b> <b>In</b> the Norway Debate of May 1940, Henderson Stewart voted against Chamberlain. After Churchill took over as Prime Minister, Henderson-Stewart enlisted again in the Royal Artillery in which he served from September 1940 to June 1941.|$|R

Later, Singh and CPI General Secretary AB Bardhan were again arrested on the UP border when they were proceeding to Dadri. However, Singh and Babbar were later able to evade the police, reaching Dadri on 18 August 2006, and <b>ploughing</b> the <b>land</b> <b>in</b> solidarity with the farmers.|$|R
50|$|The royal manor of Winnianton, {{which was}} held by King William I {{at the time of}} the Domesday Book (1086), was also the head manor of the hundred of Kerrier and the largest estate in Cornwall. It was {{assessed}} as having fifteen hides before 1066. At the time of Domesday there was land for sixty <b>ploughs,</b> but <b>in</b> the lord's <b>land</b> there were two <b>ploughs</b> and <b>in</b> the <b>lands</b> held by villeins twenty-four ploughs. There were twenty-four villeins, forty-one freedmen, thirty-three smallholders and fourteen slaves. There was 6 acre, eight square leagues of pasture and half a square league of woodland. The livestock was fourteen unbroken mares, three cattle and one hundred and twenty-eight sheep (in total 145 beasts); its value was £12 annually. 11 of the hides were held by the Count of Mortain and there is more arable and pasture and 13 more persons are recorded: Rinsey, Trelowarren, Mawgan-in-Meneage and seventeen other lands are also recorded under Winnianton.|$|R
50|$|This glacial erratic, a {{piece of}} rock that differs from the size and type of rock native to {{the area in which}} it rests, was found by a farmer who was <b>ploughing</b> his <b>land</b> <b>in</b> 2013. The field in which it was {{discovered}} lies on a small hill near the district road K 253 between Ostermunzel and Dedensen. Upon discovering it, the owner of the field informed local authorities in accordance with the Lower Saxon natural protection law that discoveries of rocks that are more than 2 metres across (6½ ft) must be reported. The Hanover Region objected to its planned demolition.|$|R
60|$|Nehushta {{asked where}} these fields were, since she desired {{to speak with}} him at once. The man {{answered}} that if they walked towards the green trees that lined the banks of Jordan, which he pointed out to them, they could not fail to find Ithiel, as he was <b>ploughing</b> <b>in</b> the irrigated <b>land</b> with two white oxen, the only ones they had. Accordingly they set out again, having the Dead Sea on their right, and travelled for the half of a league through the thorn-scrub that grows in this desert. Passing the scrub they came to lands which were well cultivated and supplied with water from the Jordan by means of wheels and long poles with a jar at one end and a weight at the other, which a man could work, emptying the contents of the jar again and again into an irrigation ditch.|$|R
50|$|The more {{fixed capital}} is used per worker, the more {{productive}} the worker can be, {{other things being}} equal. For example, a worker who tills the soil only with a spade is normally less productive than a worker who uses a tractor-driven plough {{to do the same}} work, because with a tractor one can <b>plough</b> more <b>land</b> <b>in</b> less time, and thus produce more in less time, even if a tractor costs more than a spade. Obviously one would not normally use a tractor to plough a small garden, but in large-scale farming the income earned using a tractor by far outweighs the expense of using a tractor. It is not economical to use a spade for large-scale ploughing, unless the labour is extremely cheap, and the supply of labour is plentiful.|$|R
60|$|A beech {{wood with}} silver firs in it {{rolled down the}} face of the hill, and the maze of {{leafless}} twigs and dusky spires cut sharp against the soft blueness of the evening sky, though warm hues of russet and crimson still chequered the dusky green below. Beyond it, belts of thin white mist streaked the brown <b>plough</b> <b>land</b> <b>in</b> the hollow where Appleby could see the pale shining of a winding river. Across that in turn, meadow and coppice rolled away past the white walls of a village bowered in orchards, and faded into the creeping night beyond a dim church tower and the dusky outline of Northrop Hall. As they watched, its long row of windows twinkled into brilliancy, and the sound of running water came up with the faint astringent smell of withered leaves out of the hollow. Appleby drew in a deep breath, and his face grew a trifle grim.|$|R

40|$|A field {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} evaluate the impact of different management systems of grass-clover (various cutting and/or mulching combinations) and date of ploughing (autumn or spring) {{on the fate of}} nitrogen (N) and the yield of succeeding wheat. The 3 -cut system resulted in nitrate losses below the limit of the EC Nitrate Directive (91 / 676 /EEC), even with <b>ploughing</b> <b>in</b> autumn. When <b>ploughed</b> <b>in</b> spring, treatments with frequent cutting and/or mulching induced nitrate leaching below the critical value. In contrast, losses from swards mulched only once were considerably above the threshold value, independently of ploughing time. With swards mulched and <b>ploughed</b> <b>in</b> autumn, nitrate concentrations exceed the EC-limit. The management of grass-clover swards did not affect the yield of wheat, whereas <b>ploughing</b> <b>in</b> autumn increased the yield. It is concluded, that appropriate grass-clover management and date of ploughing can reduce N-leaching, even in stockless farms...|$|R

25|$|The Romans {{achieved}} the heavy wheeled mouldboard <b>plough</b> <b>in</b> the late 3rd and 4th century AD, when archaeological evidence appears, inter alia, in Roman Britain. The first indisputable appearance after the Roman period is from 643, in a northern Italian document. Old words {{connected with the}} heavy plough and its use appear in Slavic, suggesting possible early use in this region. The general adoption of the carruca heavy <b>plough</b> <b>in</b> Europe appears to have accompanied {{the adoption of the}} three-field system in the later eighth and early ninth centuries, leading to an improvement of the agricultural productivity per unit of <b>land</b> <b>in</b> northern Europe. This was accompanied by larger fields as well, known variously as carucates, ploughlands, and ploughgates.|$|R
40|$|Ammonia (NH 3) is emitted {{mainly from}} {{agricultural}} practices, with NH 3 concentrations decreasing rapidly away from sources. As a consequence {{there is a}} high spatial variability in nitrogen deposition and its consequent ecological effects in agricultural landscapes that is in addition to differences in sensitivity between habitat types. This variability points to the potential to include spatial planning measures as part of strategies to protect sensitive vegetation from ammonia deposition. National abatement policies typically include uniform recommendations for technical abatement measures, such as <b>ploughing</b> <b>in</b> manures after <b>land</b> spreading. <b>In</b> this study, the complementary potential of spatial planning to reduce effects on target locations is analysed through model scenarios for an example landscape in central England. Scenarios included defining buffer zones of low-emission agriculture and establishing tree belts surrounding either emission sources or priority areas for the protection of semi-natural habitats. The analysis showed that tree belts can reduce deposition to sensitive areas, with trees surrounding the sensitive habitats being more effective than trees around the sources. Low emission buffer zones around sink areas also result in useful reductions in N deposition. Smaller nature reserve sites benefit to a greater degree from such spatial planning measures, as large reserves can provide their own buffer zone to some degree. Similarly, relocating point sources or using planning policies to ensure the location of large NH 3 point sources are at least 2 – 3 km from the sensitive habitats results in substantial reductions in N deposition...|$|R
