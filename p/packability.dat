40|$|Direct {{tableting}} {{has been}} renewed as a preferable process by simply mixing and compressing powder {{to save time}} and cost in comparison with granule tableting. Direct compression tableting as a technique has been successfully applied to numerous drugs on the industrial scale, although {{the success of any}} procedure, and resulting mechanical properties of tablets, is strongly affected by the quality of the crystals used. Good flowability, <b>packability</b> and compactability are prerequisite for drug to be prepared by direct tableting. When the mechanical properties of the drug particles are inadequate a primary granulation is necessary. The use of spherical crystallization as a technique appears to be an efficient alternative for obtaining suitable particles for direct tableting. Spherical crystallization is a particle design technique, by which crystallization and agglomeration can be carried out simultaneously in one step and which has been successfully utilized for improvement the micromeritic properties of crystalline drugs. In this review, we will discuss how the micromeritic properties of the particles such as flowability, <b>packability</b> and compactability can be improved by spherical crystallization technique...|$|E

40|$|The aim {{of present}} study was to prepare and {{characterize}} the recrystallized agglomerates of water insoluble non steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, indomethacin (IM) with hydrophilic polymers like polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP),hydroxyl ethyl cellulose (HEC) and hydroxyl propyl methyl cellulose (HPMC) by using emulsion solvent diffusion (ESD) technique for enhancing the solubility, dissolution rate,flowability,wettability and <b>Packability</b> of IM. The ESD technique employed three test solvents: first substance dissolution mediumgood solvent (methanol); second partial dissolution medium for the substance-bridging liquid (dichloromethane) and third poor solvent for drug substance (distilled water).

Selected solvent for the process includes the best solvent (ethyl alcohol), non-solvent (distilled water) and bridging liquid (chloroform) according to their solubility in different organic solvent. The different enteric coating polymers like cellulose acetate phthalate (CAP), Eudragit S 100 and Eudragit L 100 {{were used in the}} crystallization system. The impact of these enteric coating polymers in drug: polymer ratio 1 : 0. 25 and 1 : 0. 5 on the release of erythromycin in 0. 1 N HCl were studied.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{involves}} preparation {{and evaluation of}} floating microballoons of norfloxacin for improving the bioavailability by prolongation of gastric residence time. Norfloxacin, a sparingly water soluble drug, was selected and microballoons were prepared by emulsion solvent diffusion method using Eudragit L- 100 and Eudragit RS- 100 in ethyl alcohol and dichloromethane organic solvent system. The formation of a sphere and hollow within the sphere was confirmed through SEM studies. The percentage of drug entrapment and recovery {{was found to be}} 75 - 80 %.

40|$|A {{sustained}} release system for ketoprofen {{designed to increase}} its residence time in the stomach without contact with the mucosa was achieved through the preparation of floating microparticles by the emulsion-solvent diffusion technique. Four different ratios of Eudragit S 100 (ES) with Eudragit RL (ERL) were used to form the floating microparticles. The drug retained in the floating microparticles decreased with increase in ERL content. All floating microparticle formulations showed good flow properties and <b>packability.</b> Scanning electron microscopy and particle size analysis revealed differences between the formulations as to their appearance and size distribution. X-ray and DSC examination showed the amorphous nature of the drug. Release rates were generally low in 0. 1 N HCl especially in presence of high content of ES while in phosphate buffer pH 6. 8, high amounts of ES tended to give a higher release rate. Floating ability in 0. 1 N HCl, 0. 1 N HCl containing 0. 02 % Tween 20 and simulated gastric fluid without pepsin was also tested.

40|$|ABSTARCT:Emulsion Solovent Diffusion (EDS) {{technique}} combines crystallization and agglomeration {{directly to}} generate spherical agglomerates with improved micromeretic properties, thus obviating {{need for further}} processing by granulation and agglomeration. The present study was focused on spherical crystallization of an antifungal drug Gresiofulvine (GRV) using above mentioned ESD technique in which distilled water as an external phase and the internal phase consisted of dichloromethane which acts as good solvent as well as bridging liquid for recrystallization and agglomeration process. Apart from being poorly water-soluble, GRV exhibits poor flow and compressibility owing to its irregular shaped crystal habit and electrostatic charge. The spherical agglomeration {{was carried out in}} the presence of different polymers (hydroxyl propyl cellulose (HPC), Eudragit-RLPO) and stabilizers (Beta cyclodextrin, poloxomer-F 68 and Polyethylene glycol. The pure GRV and the prepared agglomerates were characterized in terms of production yield, drug content, solubility, in-vitro release profile, flowability,density,packability, thermal behavior (differential scanning calorimetry-DSC), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transforms infra red spectroscopy (FTIR).

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to develop a novel crystallo-co-agglomeration (CCA) method for ketoprofen to obtain its directly compressible spherical agglomerates with improved flowability and compressibility. Methodology: Dichloromethane-water system containing polyethylene glycol (PEG) 6000, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), and hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC) 100 Centi Poise was used as the crystallization system. Ketoprofen was crystallized from dichloromethane and agglomerated with talc. Experimental parameters (concentration of PEG, PVA, and HPMC; effect of temperature; and agitation speed) were optimized. The agglomerates were evaluated for micrometric properties, mechanical properties, moisture content, compressibility, <b>packability,</b> and drug-release properties. The agglomerates were characterized by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), powder x-ray diffraction (PXRD), infrared (IR) spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Main Findings: Remarkable improvement in micromeritic properties (angle of repose &# 60; 22 &#x 00 B 0;, percentage compressibility &# 60; 10, and Hausner ratio near to 1) and compactibility (mean yield pressure 55 - 93 MPa) enabled direct compression without any defect. Results of friability showed higher surface strength of agglomerates containing higher amount of talc. DSC, PXRD, and IR results showed no change in the crystalline form of ketoprofen. Dissolution study of batches KA, KB, KC, and KD(composition given in [Table 1]) showed 90 &#x 0025; drug release in 120, 180, 240, and 420 min respectively. Principal Conclusions: Crystallo-co-agglomeration process can be considered as a suitable alternative to conventional granulation process to obtain agglomerates of ketoprofen with improved micromeritic and compressibility parameters. The CCA technique can be used for the design of sustained-release ketoprofen talc agglomerates containing lower amounts of polymers...|$|E
40|$|Microparticles of {{naproxen}} with Eudragit L 100 and Aerosil {{were prepared}} by the emulsion solvent diffusion method {{in order to avoid}} local gastrointestinal irritation, one of the major side effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs after oral ingestion. The process of preparation involved the use of ethanol as good solvent, dichloromethane as a bridging liquid, water as poor solvent, Aerosil as anti-adhesion agent, and sodium dodecyl sulfate to aid in the dispersion of the drug and excipients into the poor solvent. The obtained microparticles were evaluated for micromeritic properties, yield, encapsulation efficiency, drug physical state, and drug release properties. The influence of formulation factors and preparation condition (polymer/naproxen ratio, Aerosil/polymer ratio, and the initial difference of temperature between the solvent and nonsolvent) on the properties of the microparticles were also examined. The resultant microparticles were finely spherical and uniform with high incorporation efficiency (> 79 %) and yield (> 71 %). The incorporation efficiency was enhanced with increasing the ratio of excipients to drug and the initial difference of temperature between the solvent and nonsolvent. The mean diameter of the microparticles was influenced by all of the manufacturing parameters. Studies carried out to characterize the micromeritic properties of formulations, such as flowability and <b>packability,</b> showed that microparticles were suitable for further pharmaceutical manipulation (e. g., capsule filling). Drug release studies of the microparticles confirmed the gastroresistance, and mathematical studies showed that the drug released followed a Hixon and Crowell kinetic. These microparticles represent a simple method for the preparation of drug-loaded enteric microparticles with desired micromeritic properties and gastroresistance release...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{aimed to}} evaluate the differences between backpacks designed for travel and backpacks designed for recreation. A feature analysis was conducted by analyzing the top fifteen best-selling travel and recreational backpacks {{in order to identify}} the representative features for each type of bag. Following the feature analysis, four archetypal bags were selected (two of each type) to conduct an experiment to assess the load-carrying design and usability of the backpacks. A primary usability feature targeted with this study was <b>packability</b> – defined {{for the purpose of this}} research as the ease of packing quickly and efficiently. An experiment was conducted where participants were assigned to a backpack. Participants were required to pack items into the backpack and walk on a treadmill with the backpack on at a slow pace for 30 minutes. Following the treadmill task, participants were asked to find three items packed into the bag. Time to pack the bag and time to find the items were both measured. Discomfort surveys and force plate data were collected before and after walking on the treadmill to assess the load-carrying design of the backpack as it relates to comfort/discomfort of the user and heart rate data was collected throughout the experiment. The results of this study indicate that recreational backpacks require additional exertion when compared to travel backpacks when walking at a slow pace for 30 minutes across even terrain as measured by a change in heart rate. The results also indicate a trend that travel backpacks require less time to pack, require less time to find items in the bag, and result in increased postural stability when compared to recreational backpacks...|$|E
