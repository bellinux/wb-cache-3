5|$|As {{with the}} other Black Paintings, Goya began with a black {{background}} which he painted over with lighter pigments, then with broad, heavy brushstrokes of grey, blue and brown. The darker areas were achieved by leaving the black under-paint exposed; this is most obvious in {{the figure of the}} Devil. Like the other works in the series, Witches' Sabbath is worked up through heavy, slashing brushstrokes. The plaster was underlaid with thick carbon black before the paint was applied in hues of white lead, Prussian blue, vermilion of mercury, and crystals of <b>powdered</b> <b>glass,</b> orpiment and iron oxides. He likely worked with mixed materials. Technical analysis indicates that most of the Black Paintings begun with preparatory drawings. Witches' Sabbath is the exception; the final composition seems to have been painted directly onto the wall.|$|E

50|$|According to Peter Francis, Jr., {{the making}} of <b>powder</b> <b>glass</b> beads in West Africa may date back a few hundred years, and to {{possibly}} 1200 CE in Mauritania. Maure <b>powder</b> <b>glass</b> beads are believed to copy older, Islamic beads, of the type made in Fustat and elsewhere.

5000|$|Krobo <b>powder</b> <b>glass</b> beads {{are made}} in {{vertical}} molds fashioned out of a special, locally dug clay. Most molds {{have a number of}} depressions, designed to hold one bead each, and each of these depressions, in turn, has a small central depression to hold the stem of a cassava leaf. The mold is filled with finely ground glass that can be built up in layers in order to form sequences and patterns of different shapes and colours. The technique could be described as being somewhat similar to creating a sand [...] "painting" [...] or to filling a bottle with different-coloured sands and is called the [...] "vertical-mold dry <b>powder</b> <b>glass</b> technique". When cassava leaf stems are used, these will burn away during firing and leave the bead perforation. Certain <b>powder</b> <b>glass</b> bead variants, however, receive their perforations after firing, by piercing the still hot and pliable glass with a hand-made, pointed metal tool. Firing takes place in clay kilns until the glass fuses.|$|R
2500|$|Cloisonnism is a {{style of}} Post-impressionist {{painting}} with bold and flat forms separated by dark contours. The term was coined by critic Edouard Dujardin on occasion of the Salon des Indépendants, in March 1888. Artists Émile Bernard, Louis Anquetin, Paul Gauguin, Paul Sérusier, and others started painting in this style in the late 19th century. The name evokes the technique of cloisonné, where wires (cloisons or [...] "compartments") are soldered {{to the body of}} the piece, filled with <b>powdered</b> <b>glass,</b> and then fired. Many of the same painters also described their works as Synthetism a closely related movement.|$|E

50|$|Another West African people {{known to}} produce <b>powder</b> <b>glass</b> beads are the Yoruba from Nigeria.

Finely crushed glass is moistened with water and shaped by hand. The perforations are made before the beads are fired, using a pointed tool. So-called Ateyun beads were made in different shapes but always in red, to imitate real Mediterranean coral. Genuine coral was rare, but very much sought after and highly valued by the Yoruba people. Yoruba bead makers made their own imitations at more affordable prices.|$|R

6000|$|... "And here {{is another}} fact you will know to be true. If a sheet of glass is smashed, Kemp, and beaten into a powder, it becomes much more visible while {{it is in the}} air; it becomes at last an opaque white powder. This is because the {{powdering}} multiplies the surfaces of the glass at which refraction and reflection occur. In the sheet of glass there are only two surfaces; in the powder the light is reflected or refracted by each grain it passes through, and very little gets right through the powder. But if the white <b>powdered</b> <b>glass</b> is put into water, it forthwith vanishes. The <b>powdered</b> <b>glass</b> and water have much the same refractive index; that is, the light undergoes very little refraction or reflection in passing from one to the other.|$|E

30|$|The {{effects of}} {{different}} contents and particle sizes of waste <b>glass</b> <b>powder</b> on alkali–silica reaction (ASR) expansion of cementitious composite bar were investigated in this study. Waste <b>glass</b> <b>powder</b> with particle size less than 300  μm exhibits an excellent mitigation effect on ASR expansion. With larger content and smaller particle size, the mitigation effect of waste <b>glass</b> <b>powder</b> on ASR expansion gradually increases. The mitigation effect of waste <b>glass</b> <b>powder</b> with particle size ranging from 38 to 53  μm and 20 % by weight of cement seems relatively {{better than that}} of fly ash. When the waste <b>glass</b> <b>powder</b> content reaches 30 %, the mitigation effect is still effective and almost {{the same as that}} of fly ash. However, the waste <b>glass</b> <b>powder</b> with particle size larger than 300  μm presents negative mitigation effect on ASR expansion when the replacement rate is larger than 30 %. On the other hand, the waste <b>glass</b> <b>powder</b> and calcium hydroxide (CH) further react, and produce more calcium–silicate–hydrate gels, which apparently reduce the amount of CH. Moreover, the increasing content of waste <b>glass</b> <b>powder</b> results in a lower pH value in the pore solution of cementitious composite.|$|R

50|$|<b>Powder</b> <b>glass</b> beads are {{a type of}} {{necklace}} ornamentation. The earliest such beads {{were discovered}} during archaeological excavations at Mapungubwe in South Africa, and dated to between 970-1000 CE. Manufacturing of the <b>powder</b> <b>glass</b> beads is now concentrated in West Africa, particularly in the Ghana area. The origins of beadmaking in Ghana are unknown, but {{the great majority of}} <b>powder</b> <b>glass</b> beads produced today is made by Ashanti and Krobo craftsmen and women. Krobo bead making has been documented to date from as early as the 1920s but despite limited archaeological evidence, it is believed that Ghanaian <b>powder</b> <b>glass</b> bead making dates further back. Bead making in Ghana was first documented by John Barbot in 1746. Beads still play important roles in Krobo society, be it in rituals of birth, coming of age, marriage, or death.Powder glass beads are made from finely ground glass, the main source being broken and unusable bottles and a great variety of other scrap glasses. Special glasses such as old cobalt medicine bottles, cold cream jars, and many other types of glasses from plates, ashtrays, window panes - to name only a few - are occasionally bought new, just for the purpose. Pulverized or merely fragmented, and made into beads, these glasses yield particularly bright colours and shiny surfaces. Modern ceramic colourants, finely ground broken beads, or shards of different coloured glasses from various sources can be added to create a great variety of styles, designs and decorative patterns in many different colours. In addition, glass bead fragments of varying sizes, which have traditionally been used for the manufacture {{as well as for the}} decoration of specific types of beads, can now be found in interesting new combinations, and during the past few years in particular, bead makers have taken this tradition yet another step forward by using entire, i.e. whole small beads for making their colourful bead creations.|$|R
