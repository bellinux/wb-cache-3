50|$|Polygonally {{turned parts}} may have several points, teeth, {{or other forms}} at the ends or along their circumference. The {{technique}} requires synchronisation of {{the movement of the}} polygonal turning mill and the part being machined. Polygonal turning allows rapid production and clean machining of advanced geometries. The <b>polygon</b> <b>turning</b> unit has a multitude of inserts, and is synchronized so that when an insert cuts the turning bar stock, it cuts the bar at the same radial position each time the workpiece rotates. This enables geometries such as hexes, squares and flats to be machined at faster speeds than by milling.|$|E

In contrast to other approaches, this is done with respect to two construction parameters representing a base angle and an apex perpendicular subdivision ratio. Furthermore, a combined transformation leading to circulant Hermitian matrices is proposed, which eliminates the rotational effect of the basic transformation. A finite set of characteristic parameter subdomains is derived for which the sequence converges to specific eigenpolygons. Otherwise, limit <b>polygons</b> <b>turn</b> out to be linear combinations of up to three eigenpolygons.

Detailed mapping in north-central Arabia Terra combined with superposition relations and crater counts indicate that, in that region at least, this northerly slope must have been formed no later than Late Hesperian, with the most likely time of formation being Late Hesperian. Current research in Utopia Planitia intended as a test of extant models for the formation of giant <b>polygons</b> has <b>turned</b> up good evidence for a Late Hesperian age for the northerly tilt in this region as well, as will be discussed...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method of}} calculating the pressure at any point emerging from a plane piston of polygonal shape in an infinite baffle. This is achieved by calculation of the impulse response as a time-stepped function, and considering the effect of each edge of the <b>polygon</b> in <b>turn.</b> The pressure is found from the convolution of this function with the time derivative of the piston velocity multiplied by {{the density of the}} propagation medium. Calculated pressure fields are shown for both a series of sources shaped as regular polygons, and for a source with an irregular shape. It is shown that the approach could be useful for the calculation of radiated fields from sources of arbitrary shape. (C) 2004 Acoustical Society of America...|$|R

5|$|A {{subdivision}} rule takes a tiling of {{the plane}} by <b>polygons</b> and <b>turns</b> it into a new tiling by subdividing each polygon into smaller polygons. It is finite if there are only finitely many ways that every polygon can subdivide. Each way of subdividing a tile is called a tile type. Each tile type is represented by a label (usually a letter). Every tile type subdivides into smaller tile types. Each edge also gets subdivided according to finitely many edge types. Finite subdivision rules can only subdivide tilings that {{are made up of}} polygons labelled by tile types. Such tilings are called subdivision complexes for the subdivision rule. Given any subdivision complex for a subdivision rule, we can subdivide {{it over and over again}} to get a sequence of tilings.|$|R
50|$|Most {{implementations}} of the {{ray casting}} algorithm consecutively check intersections of a ray with {{all sides of}} the <b>polygon</b> in <b>turn.</b> In this case the following problem must be addressed. If the ray passes exactly through a vertex of a polygon, then it will intersect 2 segments at their endpoints. While it is OK for the case of the topmost vertex in the example or the vertex between crossing 4 and 5, the case of the rightmost vertex (in the example) requires that we count one intersection for the algorithm to work correctly. A similar problem arises with horizontal segments that happen to fall on the ray. The issue is solved as follows: If the intersection point is a vertex of a tested polygon side, then the intersection counts only if the second vertex of the side lies below the ray. This is effectively equivalent to considering vertices on the ray as lying slightly above the ray.|$|R
40|$|Counting {{the number}} of lattice points of lattice polyhedra in a Euclidean space is a {{challenging}} problem in mathematics for long time. In 2 -dimensional case, Pick’s Theorem {{is the most important}} and useful result relating the counting of lattice points of a lattice polygon with its area. An equivalent version of Pick’s Theorem says that {{the number of}} lattice points of a dilatation of a lattice polygon by a positive integer n is a quadratic polynomial of n. known as the Ehrhart polynomial of the lattice polygon. The coefficients of this quadratic polynomial can be considered as set function defined on the class of lattice <b>polygons.</b> It <b>turns</b> out that these set functions are finitely additive measures (known as valuations), invariant under unimodular transformations and translations.. In this thesis we study the vector space of invariant valuations on the class of lattice polygons of Euclidean plane. Our purpose is to classify such vector space by specifying a concrete basis. We proved that the coefficient valuations form a basis of the vector space of invariant valuations on lattice polygons...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problems associated}} with the integration of data between incongruent boundary systems. Currently, the majority of spatial boundaries are designed in an uncoordinated manner with individual organisations generating individual boundaries to meet individual needs. As a result, current technologies for analysing geospatial information, such as geographic information systems (GISs), are not reaching their full potential. In response to the problem of uncoordinated boundaries, the authors present an algorithm for the hierarchical structuring of administrative boundaries. This algorithm applies hierarchical spatial reasoning (HSR) theory to the automated structuring of <b>polygons.</b> In <b>turn,</b> these structured boundary systems facilitate accurate data integration and analysis whilst meeting the spatial requirements of selected agencies. The algorithm is presented in two parts. The first part outlines previous research undertaken by the authors into the delineation of administrative boundaries in metropolitan regions. The second part outlines the distinctly different constraints required for administrative-boundary design in rural areas. The formalisation of the algorithm has taken place in a GIS environment utilising Avenue, an object-orientated programming language that operates under ArcView, the desktop software developed and distributed by ESRI...|$|R
40|$|The {{display of}} shaded polygons by line, cross-hatch, and dot {{patterns}} on vector devices {{is a task}} frequently used in computer graphics and computer cartography. In applications such as the production of shaded maps <b>polygon</b> shading <b>turns</b> out to be critical with respect to time requirements, {{and the development of}} efficient algorithms is of importance. Given an arbitrary polygon in the plane without self-crossing edges (simply-connected polygon), the task at hand is to shade this polygon with one or two sets of parallel lines where for each set a shading angle and a line distance are given. The basic concept of this new algorithm is to decompose the polygon into a set of mutually exclusive trapezoids (in special cases triangles) where the parallel edges of the trioxides are parallel to the desired shading lines. These trapezoids and triangles are then shaded in a fast procedure. In its present form the algorithm handles regions with up to 300 islands. Possible extensions include the construction of dash and cross patterns...|$|R
40|$|We explore several {{families}} of flip-graphs, all related to polygons or punctured polygons. In particular, {{we consider the}} topological flip-graphs of once-punctured <b>polygons</b> which, in <b>turn,</b> contain all possible geometric flip-graphs of polygons with a marked point as embedded sub-graphs. Our main {{focus is on the}} geometric properties of these graphs and how they relate to one another. In particular, we show that the embeddings between them are strongly convex (or, said otherwise, totally geodesic). We also find bounds on the diameters of these graphs, sometimes using the strongly convex embeddings. Finally, we show how these graphs relate to different polytopes, namely type D associahedra and a family of secondary polytopes which we call pointihedra. Comment: 24 pages, 6 figure...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, it {{is shown}} how a single stripe and a stripe phase grow from {{individual}} holes in low doping regime. In an effective low-energy {{description of the}} t-J model, i. e., the phase string model, a hole doped into the spin ordered phase will induce a dipolar distortion in the background [Phys. Rev. B 67, 115103 (2003) ]. We analyze the hole-dipole configurations with lowest energy under a dipole-dipole interaction and show that these holes tend to arrange themselves into a regular polygon. Such a stable <b>polygon</b> configuration will <b>turn</b> into a stripe as the number hole-dipoles becomes thermodynamically large and eventually a uniform stripe state can be formed, which constitutes an energetically competitive phase at low doping. We also briefly discuss the effect of Zn impurities on individual hole-dipoles and stripes. Comment: 15 pages, 11 figure...|$|R

5000|$|The {{classification}} up to homeomorphism and diffeomorphism of compact Riemann surfaces can {{be accomplished}} using the fundamental polygon. Indeed as Poincaré observed convex fundamental polygons for compact Riemann surfaces H/ Γ can be constructed by adapting the method Dirchlet from the Euclidean space to hyperbolic space. Then following Nevanlinna and Jost, the fundamental domain can be modified in steps to yield a non-convex polygon with vertices lying in a single orbit of Γ and piecewise geodesic sides. The pairing relation on the sides is also modified {{in each of these}} steps. Each step involves cutting the polygon by a diagonal geodesic segment in the interior of the polygon and reassembling the polygon using one of the Möbius transformations involved in the pairing. No two paired sides can have a common vertex in the final pairing relation, which satisfies similar properties to the original relation. This <b>polygon</b> can in <b>turn</b> be successively modified by reassembling the polygon after cutting it by a diagonal piecewise geodesic segment in its interior. The final polygon has 4g equivalent vertices, with sides that are piecewise geodesic. The sides are labelled by the group elements which give the Möbius transformation to the paired side.
