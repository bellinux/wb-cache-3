5|$|In {{the early}} 18th century, Bath {{acquired}} its first purpose-built theatre, the Old Orchard Street Theatre. It was rebuilt as the Theatre Royal, {{along with the}} Grand <b>Pump</b> <b>Room</b> attached to the Roman Baths and assembly rooms. Master of ceremonies Beau Nash, {{who presided over the}} city's social life from 1705 until his death in 1761, drew up a code of behaviour for public entertainments. Bath had become perhaps the most fashionable of the rapidly developing British spa towns, attracting many notable visitors such as the wealthy London bookseller Andrew Millar and his wife, who both made long visits.|$|E
5|$|Bath Abbey {{was founded}} in the 7th century and became a {{religious}} centre; the building was rebuilt in the 12th and 16th centuries. In the 17th century, claims were made for the curative properties {{of water from the}} springs, and Bath became popular as a spa town in the Georgian era. Georgian architecture, crafted from Bath stone, includes the Royal Crescent, Circus, <b>Pump</b> <b>Room</b> and Assembly Rooms where Beau Nash presided over the city's social life from 1705 until his death in 1761. Many of the streets and squares were laid out by John Wood, the Elder, and in the 18th century the city became fashionable and the population grew. Jane Austen lived in Bath in the early 19th century. Further building was undertaken in the 19th century and following the Bath Blitz in World War II.|$|E
5|$|The baths {{have been}} {{modified}} on several occasions, including the 12th century, when John of Tours built a curative bath over the King's Spring reservoir, and the 16th century, {{when the city}} corporation built a new bath (Queen's Bath) {{to the south of}} the spring. The spring is now housed in 18th-century buildings, designed by architects John Wood, the Elder and John Wood, the Younger, father and son. Visitors drank the waters in the Grand <b>Pump</b> <b>Room,</b> a neo-classical salon which remains in use, both for taking the waters and for social functions. Victorian expansion of the baths complex followed the neo-classical tradition established by the Woods. In 1810 the hot springs failed and William Smith opened up the Hot Bath Spring to the bottom, where he found that the spring had not failed but had flowed into a new channel. Smith restored the water to its original course and the baths filled in less time than before.|$|E

5|$|The Baths {{were built}} around hot springs, {{the only ones}} {{naturally}} occurring in the United Kingdom. Archaeological {{evidence suggests that the}} main spring in its natural state was treated as a shrine by the Celts. During the early Roman occupation of Britain, in the 60s or 70s AD, engineers drove oak piles into the mud to provide a stable foundation and surrounded the spring with an irregular stone chamber lined with lead. These still survive. At this early stage the spring was an open pool {{in the corner of the}} temple precinct. It fed a bathing complex on its south side within a barrel-vaulted building. The complex was gradually built up over the next 300years. All the stonework above the level of the baths is from more recent periods including the 12th century, when John of Tours built a curative bath over the King's Spring reservoir, and the 16th century, when the city corporation built a new bath (Queen's Bath) to the south of the spring. The spring is now housed in 18th-century buildings designed by architects John Wood, the Elder and John Wood, the Younger; visitor access is via an 1897 concert hall by J M Brydon, which is an eastward continuation of the Grand <b>Pump</b> <b>Room</b> with a glass-domed centre and single-storey radiused corner.|$|E
5|$|The baths were {{originally}} built in approximately 1815, {{by a local}} builder called Newton, from John Pinch the elder's design, on the Duke of Cleveland's land, giving the site its name. They were intended as public pleasure baths, and {{are believed to be}} the oldest surviving outdoor swimming baths in England. The area of Bath to the north and east of the River Avon was undergoing development {{at the end of the}} 18th century and the beginning of the 19th, after the opening of Pulteney Bridge on land around Bathwick which had been owned by William Pulteney, 1st Earl of Bath. William Johnstone had inherited the land and planned to create a new town. It was foreseen that, along with the access provided by Pulteney Bridge and Great Pulteney Street, the eastern side of the Avon would become popular with speculators and developers, as Bath had become perhaps the most fashionable of the rapidly developing British spa towns, attracting many notable visitors. In the 18th century, Bath acquired its first purpose-built theatre, the Old Orchard Street Theatre. It was rebuilt as the Theatre Royal, along with the Grand <b>Pump</b> <b>Room</b> attached to the Roman Baths and assembly rooms. Master of ceremonies Beau Nash, who presided over the city's social life from 1705 until his death in 1761, drew up a code of behaviour for public entertainments. After 1789, the financial climate did not encourage further building, as the Panic of 1797, related to a period of deflation between 1793 and 1800, was followed by the Napoleonic Wars, which saw the Depression of 1807. These limited the proposed development of new housing in the area for some years. The Bathwick Water Act of 1801 had prohibited nude bathing in the river and meant that many local subscribers were willing to put money into the construction of the baths.|$|E

25|$|In 1913, the Public Service Commission {{planned to}} connect the Flushing line to the 42nd Street shuttle, {{just west of the}} Grand Central station. Some ramp work was built for this purpose, then {{converted}} to a passenger walkway that has been in use since 1916. In addition, there are two remaining sections of the old trolley loop that remain intact and are accessible to MTA personnel via the southbound track approximately 200 feet beyond the station. The third is between the tracks and is a <b>pump</b> <b>room.</b> Parts of the loop are being converted into CBTC circuit breaker rooms.|$|E
50|$|The Water Sports Centre {{was built}} in the 1980s, with an Outdoor Swimming Pool of 6 lanes (50 m x 14 m), a spectators stand capable of holding 1000 spectators, a Boys' Changing Room, a Girls' Changing Room, a Control <b>Room,</b> and a <b>Pumping</b> <b>Room.</b> Changing Rooms are modernized, as well as adding cover to {{sections}} without roof on the spectators stand, in 2011.|$|R

The concrete {{that was used to}} fill the brass figures has been removed. A steel structure has been built inside the figures so as to support the weight of the plate, and each figure will be covered in microcrystalline wax for protection and painted in azurite blue as was their original colour in 1959. The massive base of the fountain are being restored by the De Feo Restauri of Rome, a specialized company in restoration of monuments. A new plant room has been constructed, which is connected to the new <b>pump</b> <b>room</b> through a tunnel. Restoration works of the massive base of the fountain and its basins, as the electrical and mechanical installations, are expected to be ready {{by the end of the}} year.|$|E
25|$|The {{function}} of the Royal Pump Rooms changed several times over the following years. While retaining its assembly rooms and medical facilities, around 1863 it was extended to include a Turkish bath and swimming pool, in 1875 the Royal <b>Pump</b> <b>Room</b> Gardens were opened to the public, and in 1890 a further swimming pool was added. The economy of Leamington decreased {{towards the end of}} the 19th century following the decline in popularity of spa towns, and it became a popular place of residence for retired people and for members of the middle class who relocated from Coventry and Birmingham, and wealthy residents led to the development of Leamington as a popular place for shopping. In 1997, the owners of the building, the district council, closed the facility for redevelopment, reopening it in 1999 as a culture centre. It now contains Leamington Spa Art Gallery & Museum, a library, a tourist information centre, refurbished assembly rooms and a cafe. Spa water can still be sampled outside the building.|$|E
25|$|At 11:30 PM on {{the evening}} of Saturday June 8, 1990, an {{explosion}} in the cargo room of the Norwegian oil tanker the Mega Borg “ruptured the bulkhead between the <b>pump</b> <b>room</b> and the engine room”, causing the ship to catch fire and begin to leak oil. The 853-foot-long, 15-year-old vessel was about 50 {{miles off the coast of}} Galveston, Texas when the explosion occurred. The weather at the time was calm and the tanker had easily passed Coast Guard safety inspections in April earlier that year. While the direct cause of the engine room explosion remains unknown, the initial blast occurred during a lightening process in which the Mega Borg was transferring oil onto a smaller Italian tanker, the Fraqmura, in order to then transport the oil to Houston. This transfer was necessary, as the Mega Borg was too large to dock at the Texas port. Three million gallons of the total 38 million gallons of light Angolan Palanca crude oil on board the tanker were able to be transferred to the Fraqmura before the blast.|$|E
