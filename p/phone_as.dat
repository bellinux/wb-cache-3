5|$|Another gift {{in demand}} was the streamlined, oval-shaped Princess {{telephone}} {{introduced in the}} early 1960s. The phone came {{in a variety of}} colors, including pink, turquoise, and cream. When one of Mattel's Barbie doll outfits included a Princess <b>phone</b> <b>as</b> an accessory, a fashion trend was born. By 1963, many Baby Boomers had reached driver's license age and, for the first time, middle-class families splurged on cars for their offspring.|$|E
5|$|The first {{recordings}} {{were made}} during the European leg of Garbage's Version 2.0 world tour. After listening to the orchestral demo, the band worked on the key and tempo. Garbage used a portable studio {{from a number of}} European cities to record material for Arnold, keeping in touch by <b>phone</b> <b>as</b> he produced the song's string arrangement in London. Since the strings carried the structure of the song, they had to be finalised and recorded before Manson could sing her parts. Arnold recorded the strings with a 60-piece orchestra in one day at London's Metropolis Studios.|$|E

He {{goes to a}} health food store called Swapper Jack's, where Paula is giving away autographs, to have Paula sign it.

At the signing, Homer tells Paula that Marge is a big fan of hers. Paula decides that she will call Marge live during her upcoming show to wish her a happy birthday. Meanwhile, Bart gets his mother a rabbit for her birthday. The rabbit chews through the phone lines in the Simpsons' home, causing Marge to miss Paula's call. Paula becomes furious at Marge for not answering the <b>phone</b> <b>as</b> she embarrassed herself on her show. Homer punishes Bart by locking him up in the rabbit's cage.|$|E
5|$|Warshaw {{used those}} days {{to design the}} {{structure}} of the game and segmented the concept into four ideas: world, objective, path to achieve the objective, and obstacles. He envisioned a three-dimensional cube world as the setting and adapted part of the film's plot, E.T. phoning home, as the goal. Warshaw then conceived that E.T. would need to assemble a special phone to call his ship and arrive at a special landing site to achieve this goal. He considered obstacles as an element that would determine the success of a game, and experienced difficulties when taking into account the time constraints and technical limitations of the console. Inspired by the movie, adults were implemented as antagonists that would chase the alien. Feeling more adversity was needed, Warshaw included a time limit for players to accomplish the goal. Pits were devised as an element to hide the pieces of the <b>phone</b> <b>as</b> well as expand the game's world.|$|E

25|$|An amateur {{photographer}} is one {{who practices}} photography as a hobby/passion and not necessarily for profit. The quality of some amateur work is {{comparable to that of}} many professionals and may be highly specialized or eclectic in choice of subjects. Amateur photography is often pre-eminent in photographic subjects which have little prospect of commercial use or reward. Amateur photography grew during the late 19th century due to the popularization of the hand-held camera. Nowadays it has spread widely through social media and is carried out throughout different platforms and equipment, switching to the use of cell <b>phone</b> <b>as</b> a key tool for making photography more accessible to everyone.|$|E
25|$|In February 2011, Nokia CEO Stephen Elop and Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer jointly {{announced}} a major business {{partnership between the}} two companies, which would see Nokia adopt Windows <b>Phone</b> <b>as</b> the primary platform for its future smartphones, replacing both Symbian and MeeGo. The deal also included the use of Bing as the search engine on Nokia devices, and the integration of Nokia Maps into Microsoft's own mapping services. Nokia {{announced that it would}} still release one device running the MeeGo platform in 2011, but that it would devote fewer resources to future development of the platform, and would phase out Symbian entirely. Aligning with Microsoft had been considered a possibility by analysts, due to Elop's prior employment with the company.|$|E
25|$|Invisible {{hearing aid}} types use venting and their deep {{placement}} {{in the ear}} canal to give a more natural experience of hearing. Unlike other hearing aid types, with the IIC aid {{the majority of the}} ear is not blocked (occluded) by a large plastic shell. This means that sound can be collected more naturally by the shape of the ear, and can travel down into the ear canal as it would with unassisted hearing. Depending on their size, some models allow the wearer to use a mobile <b>phone</b> <b>as</b> a remote control to alter memory and volume settings, instead of taking the IIC out to do this. IIC types are most suitable for users up to middle age, but are not suitable for more elderly people.|$|E

25|$|The Cryptophon {{is built}} on the {{foundation}} of an 8051 compatible microprocessor which controls the whole system and peripherals (e.g. ISDN controller, keypad and display). For the cryptography, Floricic used cheap DSPs from Texas Instruments which he scrapped out of old computer modems, but which could also be bought at affordable prices. As this type of DSP is not powerful enough for the cryptography algorithm chosen, Floricic used two of them for the Cryptophon – one for sending and one for receiving. He planned to extend the phone so {{it would also be}} possible to encrypt data-connections. Floricic developed both the operating software of the <b>phone</b> <b>as</b> well as the cryptography implementation in the DSPs. He found a new way to implement IDEA to save significant processing time.|$|E
25|$|For {{the first}} time Big Brother Australia {{featured}} a telephone in the house.

On Day 52 Joel {{received a call from}} Big Brother advising that he would be away from the house and would communicate via the phone to Joel at various times. On Day 58 Andrew picked up the <b>phone</b> <b>as</b> a joke, and was penalised by being sent to the Punishment Room to polish boots.

25|$|In October 2013, an Oklahoma {{crime lab}} began re-examining {{fingerprints}} taken from scenes of unsolved murders. In February 2014, Creek's case was reopened; examiners in an Oklahoma crime lab {{were able to}} match a thumbprint on the garbage bag concealing the body to James Paul Eaton, a 36-year-old divorced man. Eaton was nineteen {{at the time of}} the murder and lived in Palatine, Illinois, the same town as Creek. One of the men seen with Amber in early February 1997 bore a strong resemblance to Eaton. Eaton's fingerprints were not on record {{at the time of the}} murder, recorded only in 2000 after his arrest for possession of drug paraphernalia. Investigators located the suspect in Chicago, and on March 22 collected discarded cigarette butts to match his DNA to that found at the crime scene. Eaton was subsequently arrested in early April and is currently incarcerated in Racine, Wisconsin. Authorities also looked though his computer, Facebook profile and <b>phone,</b> <b>as</b> well as searching his residence for possible souvenirs from the scene, as some of Amber's belongings had been suspected to have been taken by her killer.|$|E
