40|$|Today, {{intricate}} {{problems of}} surface treatment {{can be solved}} through precision cladding using advanced laser technology. Metallic and carbidic coatings have been produced with high power lasers for years, and current investigations show that laser cladding is also a promising technique {{for the production of}} dense and precisely localized ceramic layers. In the present work, powders based on Al 2 O 3 /TiO 2 were used to clad aluminium light alloys. The compact layers are up to 1 mm thick and show a non-porous cast structure as well as a homogeneous network of vertical cracks. The high adhesive strength is due to several chemical and mechanical bonding mechanisms and may exceed that of plasma-sprayed coatings. Compared to thermal spray techniques, the material deposition is strictly focused onto small functional areas of the workpiece. Thus, being a precision technique, laser cladding is not recommended for large-area coatings. Examples of applications are filigree <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>pump</b> casings...|$|E

As overall vibration respons-es contain high level of broadband noises due to cavities and turbulences, noise reduction is critical to develop reliable and effective features. However, considering the modulation effect between rotating shaft and blade passing components, a modulation signal bispectrum (MSB) method is employed to extract these deterministic characteristics of modulations, which is different from previous researches in that broadband random sources are often used. Experi-mental results show that the diagnostic features developed by MSB allow impellers with inlet vane damages and exit vane faults to be identified under different operating conditions...|$|R
