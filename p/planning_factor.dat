40|$|This study aims {{to measure}} the psychometric {{properties}} of the Das-Naglieri Cognitive Assessment System (D-N CAS) and to determine its clinical utility in a Chinese context. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted to examine the construct validity of the Chinese version of the D-N CAS among a group of 567, normally developed children. Test-retest reliability was examined in a random. subsample of 30 children at a five-week interval. The clinical discrimination of the D-N CAS was also examined by comparing children with and without ADHD (18 children in each group) and by comparing children with and without Chinese reading disabilities (18 children in each group). The current Chinese sample demonstrated a four-factor solution for cognitive performance among children with normal development: Planning, Attention, Simultaneous processing and Successive processing. (chi(2) (48) = 91. 90, p =. 000; chi(2) /df = 1. 92, RMSEA =. 050, GFI =. 966, CFI =. 954). Moreover, all subtests of the battery demonstrated acceptable test-retest reliability (r =. 72 -. 90, p <. 01) at a five-week interval among the subjects of the small subsample. Children with ADHD performed significantly worse than normal children on the Attention factor (p <. 001) and the <b>Planning</b> <b>factor</b> (p <. 05) of the D-N CAS, and children with Chinese reading disabilities performed significantly worse than normal children on the Simultaneous processing factor (p <. 01), the Successive processing factor (p <. 001) and the <b>Planning</b> <b>factor</b> (p <. 05) of the D-N CAS. These findings suggested that the current four-factor structure of the D-N CAS was similar to the original factor structure of the test. The latent factor of the D-N CAS was fairly stable across the cultures. Moreover, the D-N CAS can distinguish between children with ADHD or Chinese reading disabilities and normally developed children. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

This makes Critical infrastructures increasingly important as a <b>planning</b> <b>factor</b> in case of emergencies. For that reason, we studied a number of emergencies and a small set of local emergency plans from the perspective of how first responder currently take critical infrastructures into account. Our initial analysis indicates that civil emergency plans lack consideration for critical infrastructures.

Therefore, we recommend that emergency preparedness plans, training, situational awareness, and the decision-cycle of first responders and emergency management need {{to pay more attention to}} critical infrastructures. This decreases the risk that emergencies are worsened due to second-order effects of failing infrastructure, that emergency operations themselves are hampered, and that more casualties occu...|$|E

40|$|The use of {{national}} freight data {{at the local}} level is challenging due to the high level of aggregation and because freight data is proprietary. Many national freight databases aggregate information to the individual states or major communities. Most methods of utilizing freight data depend on applying proxy factors to allocate the freight to the system. The planning factors used in freight system analysis must be capable of describing the freight generation and attraction characteristics of the region. The use of employment as a <b>planning</b> <b>factor</b> has come under scrutiny mainly due to the inability of the factor to accurately estimate the effect of productivity improvements made by a company to increase production without increasing employment. This research has shown that local economic data from many different sources can successfully be used to allocate freight volume into smaller zones from the future freight traffic volumes provided by highly aggregated national databases. The output of this effort is used as input to the modeling of freight, and the integration of that freight into existing transportation planning and modeling activities {{at the state and local}} level. This has been accomplished in Alabama at the statewide and metropolitan planning organization level, resulting in validated transportation models that integrate freight into the planning activity.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{construct}} of 2 ̆ 2 behavioral planning 2 ̆ 2 and presents a theory in which behavioral planning {{is an important}} cognitive antecedent to many health behaviors, particularly for those {{that have to be}} maintained over time. Behavioral planning is the cognitive elaboration of internal and external resources and constraints in the representation of action sequences. ^ It is suggested that behavioral planning can vary in depth, duration, and frequency, and that this variation helps determine which beliefs become salient in the cognitive representations of behaviors. The relationships between behavioral planning and several of the cognitive constructs widely used in health communications [...] intention and self-efficacy [...] are described in detail. ^ Two measures of behavioral planning and physical activity were included in a large-scale survey of the U. S. population. These items were normally distributed and stemmed from a single underlying factor. Analysis of the survey results indicated that this behavioral <b>planning</b> <b>factor</b> was related to measures of self-efficacy, intention, and self-reported behavior. These results lent support to the theory. ^ A controlled experiment with random assignment to condition was conducted to test the causal directions of these relationships. It was hypothesized that behavioral planning would positively affect these variables. The effects of a manipulation of the depth and duration of behavioral planning were compared to both a control condition and a comparison condition. In the latter, subjects were asked to think about the benefits of physical activity. The manipulations and instruments were delivered over the Internet using the World Wide Web. ^ The results of the experiment did not confirm the hypotheses. Instead, there was some evidence for a counterproductive interaction effect between stage of change and behavioral planning. Among those subjects who were exercising somewhat regularly, the manipulation of behavioral planning had a negative effect on their moderate physical activity and no effect on their vigorous physical activity. ^ There were several other statistically significant but unexpected findings. Speculating, there may be important differences between the frequency of behavioral planning and the depth and duration of planning. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{topic of}} this bachelor’s thesis is The Framing of Russia-Georgia War in Eesti Päevaleht and Helsingin Sanomat. The {{research}} was conducted between 7 August 2008 and 15 August 2008. In {{the course of the}} process altogether 45 articles from the print newspaper edition were analyzed – 24 from Eesti Päevaleht and 21 from Helsingin Sanomat. Using the framing approach as the research method, the aim was to investigate public opinion of the Russia- Georgia War in Estonian and Finnish media. Regarding the framing definition, the author of this research followed Robert Entman. According to him, frames have four main functions: problem definition, causal interpretation, moral evaluation and treatment recommendation. Based on this, the analyze of the articles was carried out. Comparing the framing in Eesti Päevaleht and Helsingin Sanomat showed that the main difference is in moral evaluation. In the Estonian newspaper, more emphasis was put on bringing forth the offender and victim whereas in the Finnish newspaper the conflict was put into a wider context. This shows that the Eesti Päevaleht frames were more critical and emotional. Regarding the functions of causal interpretation and treatment recommendation, Estonian and Finnish media frames were similar. Although, {{it can be said that}} some of the Eesti Päevaleht recommendations were more radical than the Finnish ones. The author of this thesis also put forth a wider research question: do different attitudes towards collective memory and security policy show in the media? Since Russia is the biggest factor in Estonian and Finnish collective memory and security policy planning, the conflict in Georgia put forth many questions about history and security. That also influenced the framing of the conflict. The war was framed more professionally by the Finnish journalists, politicians and specialists because they are not influenced by collective memory. Finnish citizens, Estonian journalists and specialists had a more national frame because they tend to hold on to the past. Security policy issues were discussed in both newspapers because of the fact that Russia is the biggest security policy <b>planning</b> <b>factor</b> in Estonia and Finland. In conclusion, the given results of this research show that the framing of the Russia-Georgia war in Eesti Päevaleht and Helsingin Sanomat differed.

Qualitative methods such as observation, questionnaires and individual and focused groups interviews are utilized to gather primary data and a mixture of documents, aerial photos, maps, reports, charts which are regarded as the secondary data collection method are used in this study with an aim of adequately analyzing the Cultural Heritage Tourism and its significance in social, economic values and planning factors. Quantitative method is also used to quantify the data in numbers and to measure the Cultural Heritage Tourism’s impacts in economic ways. The research process unveiled the results of an adequate assessment about the potentials of Cultural Heritage Tourism and how it contributes to the process of socioeconomic development and spatial planning management. A comparative analysis between the two study areas of Thua Thien Hue and Quang Nam is done to measure the potential impacts of Cultural Heritage Tourism in promoting the identity and branding of the localities. In another aspect, it reflects a better insight of socio-economic factor through several important indicators such as employment creation, income generation, tax, GDP and revenues. More important, the Cultural Heritage Tourism development also essentially brings in the rehabilitation of traditional cultural values such as historical relics, monument, and old urban centres.
