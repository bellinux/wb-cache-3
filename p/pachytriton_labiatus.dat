50|$|The spotted paddle-tail newt (Pachytriton brevipes) is an {{amphibian}} {{native to}} southeastern China; {{it was named}} in 1876. A {{member of the family}} Salamandridae, it is closely related to the spotless paddle-tail newt (<b>Pachytriton</b> <b>labiatus).</b> The spotted paddle-tail newt lives in streams and is characterized by its long, paddle-shaped tail used for propulsion.|$|E
40|$|Variation in {{relation}} to age and sex in a population of <b>Pachytriton</b> <b>labiatus</b> from Mt. Huangshan, Anhui Province, China was examined. There appeared to be distinct morphological variation among age/sex groups. We suggest that some of this variation is associated with ecology and behavior. Examination of the newt species from the type locality and nearby localities of Pachytriton granulosus (=Pingia granulosa), a taxonomically problematic species, revealed that this taxon was almost indistinguishable from juvenile P. labiatus. We therefore conclude that P. granulosus is a junior synonym of P. labiatus...|$|E
40|$|Examination of the lectotype and paralectotypes of <b>Pachytriton</b> <b>labiatus</b> (Unterstein, 1930) from {{southern}} China {{revealed that the}} specimens do not represent a member of Pachytriton, but are identical with a newt of another genus, Paramesotriton ermizhaoi Wu et al., 2009 also described {{from southern}} China. We suggest that Pac. labiatus should be transferred to Paramesotriton as a senior synonym of Par. ermizhaoi. We compared the morphology of the northeastern and southwestern groups of newts previously called Pac. "labiatus" with special reference to age and sexual variations. As a result, we confirmed that the two groups are differentiated sufficiently {{to be treated as}} different species. In this report, we revive the name Pac. granulosus Chang, 1933 to refer to the northeastern group of Pac. "labiatus, " and at the same time, describe a new species representing the southwestern group...|$|E

Homoplastic {{evolution}} of external colouration in Asian stout newts (Pachytriton) inferred from molecular phylogeny. -Zoologica Scripta, 39, 9 - 22. The Asian stout newts {{of the genus}} Pachytriton (Salamandridae) inhabit montane streams in south-eastern China. Despite their abundance in the pet trade, the phylogeny and systematics of this genus are poorly understood. Colouration {{is often used to}} delimit species under the assumption that consistent chromatic differences characterize independent evolutionary lineages. We present the first phylogenetic study of Pachytriton that incorporates 2. 35 kb of mitochondrial DNA (ND 2, cytb) and 1. 2 kb of nuclear sequence data (RAG- 1) along with morphometric characters to infer evolutionary relationships and patterns of colour evolution among the three described species: Pachytriton brevipes, <b>Pachytriton</b> <b>labiatus</b> and Pachytriton archospotus. Our results support the monophyly of Pachytriton and recover P. archospotus as the sister taxon to P. brevipes. Monophyly of P. labiatus is significantly rejected: south-western populations are sister to the group of P. brevipes plus P. archospotus, whereas north-eastern populations nest with P. brevipes. The two geographic units are further separated by multivariate morphological analyses. South-western P. labiatus is the type species; misidentification of north-eastern populations as P. labiatus results from their similar colouration. An unspotted, dark brown dorsum is the likely ancestral state for the genus, whereas black-spotted colouration characterized the common ancestor of P. brevipes, P. archospotus, and north-eastern P. labiatus and was secondarily lost in the latter group. Homoplastic evolution and intraspecific variation render colour pattern in Pachytriton an unreliable character for delimiting species boundaries. North-eastern populations of P. labiatus are declining as the result of human collection and habitat destruction and are in urgent need of conservation protection.
