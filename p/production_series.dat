5|$|By February 1945 the {{seventeen}} aircraft of {{the second}} increment were themselves in need of upgrades, particularly those of the 216th Army Air Force Base Unit. Four of the planes assigned to the 393d Bombardment Squadron (now part of the 509th Composite Group) were transferred to the 216th to meet an increase in its testing tempo. Rather than attempt to modify the existing aircraft a few at a time, {{a decision was made}} to start a new <b>production</b> <b>series.</b> The first five of this third increment, known as Project 98228-S, also went to the test unit. The order totaled an additional 28 aircraft, with delivery of 15 designated combat models for the 393d beginning in April. The final eight were not delivered until after the two atomic bomb missions in August. Two were given to the 216th while the remaining six were assigned to the 509th at Wendover as replacements for any bombers lost while operating from Tinian. Ironically, no bombers were lost during operations from Tinian, but five of these six were lost in crashes over the next few years.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, two less {{powerful}} T single-car units were built, {{designed to be}} prototypes used on the Oslo Tramway. After a one-year trial, they were put into scheduled traffic to the Kolsås Line, where they remained in regular service until 1983. The <b>production</b> <b>series</b> is somewhat different in design and performance. T1000 is both {{used to refer to}} the class as a whole, or the first 162 cars, that are only equipped with third-rail shoes. They have four slight variations, which have been given the designations T1–T4. The T1300 is a series of 33 new and sixteen rebuilt T4 trains equipped with pantographs which previously allowed them operate on {{the western part of the}} network, prior to it being upgraded to third-rail metro standards. The newer units were designated T5 and T6, while the rebuilt units were designated T7 and T8.|$|E

25|$|The first {{squadron}} of 20 F-35 jets {{from the first}} <b>production</b> <b>series</b> would only include a few Israeli-made systems. The United States, meanwhile, has agreed that if Israel buys more F-35 squadrons from later <b>production</b> <b>series,</b> the installation of more Israeli-made systems will be allowed. To sweeten the deal, Lockheed Martin said it would buy parts and systems for the F-35 from Israeli companies {{at a cost of}} $4 billion. The aircraft will be designated F-35I, as there will be unique Israeli features installed in them.|$|E
25|$|Prior to {{production}} of the Series 1, significant costs were incurred in testing and certification required to conform to 1999 Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. Once completed, a total of 249 <b>production</b> <b>Series</b> 1 cars were constructed by Shelby American, Inc. as year 1999 models.|$|E
25|$|The NPZ {{color scheme}} {{mentioned}} above is generally common today. The second <b>production</b> <b>series</b> (560 100 - 560 141) has the blue window strip extended {{all the way}} to the driver's compartment. In addition, numerous examples have logos of the various Swiss S-Bahn systems (Zürich, Basel, Bern, Ostwind, Réseau Express Vaudois, etc.) applied to the side of the locomotive near the driver's compartment.|$|E

25|$|In 1940, {{after the}} Red Army {{accepted}} for service the 61-K 37mm anti-aircraft gun, the VVS leadership decided to equip some fighters {{and a part}} of the upcoming <b>production</b> <b>series</b> of the Ilyushin Il-2 ground attack aircraft with a 37mm autocannon capable of firing the same shell. Shpitalniy designed a gun that was gas operated and magazine fed, which however used a less powerful cartridge than the 61-K gun.|$|E
25|$|For {{services}} on the Seehas line (the area near Konstanz, Germany), the Mittelthurgaubahn (MThB) in 1993 took four NPZ trainsets off the SBB's production line. These 4 trainsets {{came from the}} first <b>production</b> <b>series,</b> and were delivered to the MThB in 1994 numbered as RBDe 566 631-634. These 4 trainsets {{would have been the}} ninth to twelfth for the SBB, which subsequently increased its total order by four.|$|E
25|$|Twenty {{locomotives}} {{were delivered}} in 1996, {{largely based on}} MaK's previous <b>production</b> <b>series,</b> the Dutch NS Class 6400 and German DE 1002, although receiving some upgrades to the specifications. NSB took delivery of the class to replace the aging Di 3, and the units have been used on freight trains on un-electrified lines, including the Nordland Line and the Røros Line. They were transferred to CargoNet in 2002, when NSB's cargo division was demerged. Ten units were sold to GB Railfreight in 2011 and are used at the Teesside Steelworks in Redcar, United Kingdom.|$|E

25|$|After delays to the {{planning}} because of wartime conditions, work proceeded quickly at Toulouse, Marseilles and Paris, where various components were being built and tested. The Armagnac was designed {{from the outset}} in a Cook-Craigie production line prior to the first prototype which flew on 2 April 1949 with Sud-Est Chief Pilot Pierre Nadot at the controls but was lost on 30 January 1950 while still undergoing tests. The first <b>production</b> <b>series</b> aircraft F-BAVD flew on 30 December 1950. Examples of the S.E.2010 were demonstrated at the 1951 and 1953 Paris Grand Palais.|$|E
25|$|The P 16 was {{developed}} in 1924 by Citroën from the earlier Citroën-Kégresse Modèle 1923, one of the models applying the Kégresse track. It was very similar in conception but had an enlarged armoured hull, built by Schneider, and a stronger 60hp Panhard engine. In June 1925 an order was obtained for a pre-series of four vehicles. In October that year a first <b>production</b> <b>series</b> of ten is ordered. Citroën found itself unable to produce the vehicles and the order was delegated to Schneider. Citroën would supply the chassis, Kégresse the suspension and Schneider, responsible for the final assembly, the armour plates.|$|E
25|$|The aircraft, {{previously}} Air Force Serial Number 56-0538, {{was one of}} {{the original}} C-130A <b>production</b> <b>series</b> and had been built by Lockheed and delivered to the USAF in 1957. It was retired from military service in 1986. In May 1988, the aircraft was acquired by the U.S. Forest Service from the General Services Administration, and in August 1988 the Forest Service sold the plane to Hemet Valley Flying Service along with five others it had acquired, for conversion to an airtanker. Hemet then sold the C-130 to Hawkins & Powers. At the time of the crash, the airframe had logged 21,863 flight hours.|$|E

25|$|The Ba.88 had all {{the design}} {{specifications}} {{to be a very}} effective heavy fighter-bomber. It had a slim, streamlined shape (noted by all aviation observers), a rugged structure, heavy firepower, long range and high speed, with the same horsepower of medium bombers such as the Br.20 (but at 9tonnes/10tons vs. 5tonnes/6tons). Despite its promising beginning, the addition of military equipment in the <b>production</b> <b>series</b> aircraft resulted in high wing loading and detrimental aerodynamic effects with a corresponding loss of performance, below any reasonable level. The contract was subsequently canceled, but production was later resumed, mostly for political reasons to avoid closing production lines of Breda and its satellite company IMAM.|$|E
25|$|Like the DT, the DWC {{could be}} fitted with either floats or a {{conventional}} landing gear for water or ground landings. Two different radiators were available, with a larger version for tropical climes. After the prototype was delivered in November 1923, upon the successful completion of tests on 19 November, the Army commissioned Douglas to build four <b>production</b> <b>series</b> aircraft. Due to the demanding expedition ahead, spare parts, including 15 extra Liberty engines, 14 extra sets of pontoons, and enough replacement airframe parts for two more aircraft were specified and sent to way points along the route. The last aircraft was delivered on 11 March 1924.|$|E
25|$|The E-34 had a {{rectangular}} cross-section fuselage formed from steel tubing with internal wire bracing. Its cockpits were open. The undercarriage used {{a pair of}} internally sprung mainwheels with balloon tyres and a tailskid. A split axle was mounted on a short V-strut below the fuselage. On the prototype, the undercarriage main legs were short, mounted on the lower fuselage longerons and assisted by short forward struts. The second prototype and production aircraft had longer legs fixed to the upper longerons. The prototype and <b>production</b> <b>series</b> aircraft were powered, as {{the rules of the}} competition required, by a 105hp (78kW) Walter Junior four-cylinder inverted inline engine, although the second prototype was fitted with the more powerful 130hp (97kW) de Havilland Gipsy Major of the same configuration.|$|E

25|$|The project PZL.50 (or PZL P.50) {{and named}} Jastrząb (Hawk), started in late 1936. The design was {{accepted}} by the Air Force Command in 1937 and two prototypes were ordered. In June 1938, 300 Mercury VIII engines were also ordered for the PZL, {{the first to be}} delivered in June 1939. The engine for the prototype was imported from Great Britain and fitted in September 1938. The prototype was almost ready by October, but its completion was delayed by the lack of a retractable landing gear, delivered by the British Dowty firm. Due to the delay, the Polish aviation authorities missed the chance of starting flying tests with some temporary fixed landing gear, since Polish industry had not yet produced suitable retractable gears. Avia-manufactured undercarriage units were specified for the <b>production</b> <b>series.</b>|$|E
25|$|As the DB 601 E {{was not yet}} {{available}} in numbers, the pre-production F-0 (the only F variant to have a rectangular supercharger intake) and the first <b>production</b> <b>series</b> F-1/F-2 received the 1,175PS (1,159hp, 864kW) DB 601N engine driving a VDM 9-11207 propeller. The F-0/F-1 and F-2 only differed in their armament; the F-1 being fitted with one 20mm MG FF/M Motorkanone firing through the propeller hub, with 60 rounds. The F-1 first saw action in the Battle of Britain in October 1940 with JG 51. The most experienced fighter aces, like Werner Mölders, were {{the first ones to}} fly the Bf 109 F-1s in combat in October 1940. A total of 208 F-1s were built between August 1940 and February 1941 by Messerschmitt Regensburg and the Wiener Neustädter Flugzeugwerke (WNF).|$|E
25|$|Series 4 {{marked a}} {{departure}} from the usual airing of the series. Typically, the BBC would air the episode in the UK and then 6 to 9 months later they would air in the US on AMC. However, due to the additional funding that AMC provided for the <b>production,</b> <b>Series</b> 4 debuted in the US on 18 April 2007, prior to airing in the UK. As a result of AMC's increased involvement, the first and final episodes of series 4 were filmed on location in Los Angeles and Las Vegas. The series has also been shown in other countries such as New Zealand, Australia (both on ABC1 and Foxtel's UKTV), Germany on RTL Crime, Japan, Sweden on SVT, Italy on La7 and Finland on MTV3. Series two has also aired in the MENA region on Dubai One, an English language channel. Virgin Media TV bought the rights to broadcast Hustle on its flagship channel Virgin 1.|$|E
