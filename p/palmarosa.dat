50|$|<b>Palmarosa</b> is wildly {{grown in}} {{wetlands}} in provinces of India, including Nepal. The <b>Palmarosa</b> oil is {{extracted from the}} stem of the grass by distillation of dried leaves. Once the stems and leaves have been distilled {{for two to three}} hours, to separate the oil from the palmarose, then the leftover distilled grass is turned into organic matter and becomes manure or is composted.|$|E
50|$|The most {{efficient}} way to grow <b>palmarosa</b> is in a nursery with lots of irrigation and soil pH of 7-8. Two or three days before planting, it is best to overwhelm the soil with water to increase soil moisture above 60% when planting the seeds. This moisture increases the germination of the seed and increases weed control in the nursery beds as well. It is also recommended to flood the soil once a month to maintain a high moisture level in the soil. Irrigation in a nursery is most important for the first 40 days. <b>Palmarosa</b> grass grows well in sandy texture soil with low nitrogen, sufficient phosphorus and potassium. Weeds are a problem and keeping them out of the nursery beds will increase the yield. Manual weeding must be done often and involves a well-trained eye to uncover the weeds. Also, <b>palmarosa</b> is often intercropped to help suppress the weeds, thus increasing yields and the land efficiency. Mostly farmers intercrop with pigeon pea, also millet and sorghum work well with row or strip intercropping because <b>palmarosa</b> can be harvested three to four times a year.|$|E

40|$|Inhibitors {{are known}} for their {{specificity}} of action. 1 A substance, which effectively protects a given metal under certain conditions, may cease to be effective under other conditions or with other metals. The extracts of some common plants and by-products (peels, seeds, fruit shells, leaves, etc.) contain different organic compounds (e. g., amino acids, tannin, alkaloids, and most of their constituents), which are known to have inhibitive action. 2 - 6 It is therefore expected that the essential oils extracted from plants would exhibit inhibitive action. Vapor corrosion inhibitors (VCIs) are chemicals that are used to protect metallic items from atmospheric corrosion during manufacture, storage, and transportation. Initially, camphor was used to protect military equipment and machinery parts. 6 In later years, the development of organic compounds as VCIs for metals 7 - 10 has been important. Our previous work 11 - 12 revealed that the extracts of bark oils and amine-azole-nitro compounds are quite effective in reducing the corrosion of mild steel in marine and industrial environments. Jasminum grandiflorum (JG), Jasminum auriculatum (JA), Oleum <b>palmarosae</b> (OP), Ocimum basilicum (OB), and Vetiveria zizanioides (VZ) oils were used in this work...|$|R

5000|$|It takes a {{large amount}} of rose petals to distill a small amount of {{essential}} oil. Depending on extraction method and plant species, the typical yield can be approximately 1:3,000. To mitigate the cost, some dishonest dealers will dilute rose oil with geranium (Pelargonium graveolens) or <b>palmarosa</b> (Cymbopogon martinii) essential oils, both of which are rich in geraniol, the main constituent of rose oil. Some of these [...] "rose oils" [...] are up to 90% geranium or <b>palmarosa</b> to 10% rose. This is referred to as extending the rose fragrance. This may be done to compensate for chemotype, e.g. Bulgarian distilled rose oil is naturally low in phenylethanol, and Ukrainian or Russian rose oil is naturally high in phenylethanol. Pure rose oil should not be used directly on the skin, as it can cause allergic reactions such as red skin and spots.|$|E
50|$|Cymbopogon martinii is {{a species}} of grass in the genus Cymbopogon (lemongrasses) native to India and Indochina, but widely {{cultivated}} in many places for its aromatic oil.

50|$|The {{essential}} oil of this plant, which contains the chemical compound geraniol, is valued for its scent {{and for a}} number of traditional medicinal and household uses. <b>Palmarosa</b> oil {{has been shown to be}} an effective insect repellent when applied to stored grain and beans, an antihelmintic against nematodes, and an antifungal and mosquito repellent.|$|E

ACH (Cecil) Palmer and his wife, Lorna Barron, appear to have settled at <b>Palmarosa</b> {{within a year or}} so of their marriage in August 1902, and in 1913 title to the property was transferred to Mr Palmer. The Palmers were well known in Brisbane society for their race-day verandah parties at <b>Palmarosa,</b> overlooking the Albion Park Raceway, with [...] "bookies" [...] said to have visited the house to take bets.

During the Second World War, <b>Palmarosa</b> was occupied by United States military personnel from 1942 to [...]The house remained in the Palmer family until title passed in 1945 to Charles Robinson, then to Charles Lawrence Hayles in 1946. In 1951 the residence was converted to a boarding house - several of its residents later became prominent, including Sir William Knox and several judges - and Hayles subdivided the property in 1954. Title to the house block was transferred a number of times in the 1950s, and in the late 1950s or early 1960s the place was converted to a private convalescence hospital. By September 1963 the verandahs had been removed and additional toilets installed for hospital use. Also by this date, the name Palma Rosa was being spelt as two words.|$|E

50|$|Geraniol is a monoterpenoid and an alcohol. It is {{the primary}} part of rose oil, <b>palmarosa</b> oil, and {{citronella}} oil (Java type). It also occurs in small quantities in geranium, lemon, and many other essential oils. It appears as a clear to pale-yellow oil that is insoluble in water, but soluble in most common organic solvents. It has a rose-like scent and is commonly used in perfumes. It is used in flavors such as peach, raspberry, grapefruit, red apple, plum, lime, orange, lemon, watermelon, pineapple, and blueberry.|$|E
5000|$|This grass grows fairly tall, {{ranging from}} [...] in height with a pale green color {{and a strong}} thin stem.
