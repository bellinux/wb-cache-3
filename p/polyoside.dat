40|$|Vaccination against {{cerebrospinal}} meningitis (CSM) has regained interest {{with the use}} of capsular polysaccharides (or polyosides) of the meningococcus as specific immunizing agents. These compounds proved to be effective in the USA against meningitis caused by Neisseria meningitidis serotype C. This study considers whether the polysaccharides of the serotype A meningococcus, which is prevalent in the African CSM belt, could be protective in epidemic conditions. Taking advantage of the usual seasonal peak of CSM cases, controlled field trials were undertaken in the Sudan early in 1973. 21 640 persons were vaccinated, half of them with a meningococcal <b>polyoside</b> A vaccine and the other half with tetanus toxoid as a placebo. In the former group there were no cases of meningitis, whereas in the latter 10 cases were reported, of which 7 were confirmed by laboratory tests. These studies indicate that the meningococcal <b>polyoside</b> A vaccine is efficient in epidemic conditions and could be used to control outbreaks of meningococcal meningitis...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThree basic proline-rich salivary {{proteins}} {{have been}} produced through the recombinant route. IB 5 is a small basic proline-rich protein that {{is involved in the}} binding of plant tannins in the oral cavity. II- 1 is a larger protein with a closely related backbone; it is glycosylated, and it is also able to bind plant tannins. II- 1 ng has the same polypeptidic backbone as II- 1, but it is not glycosylated. Small angle x-ray scattering experiments on dilute solutions of these proteins confirm that they are intrinsically disordered. IB 5 and II- 1 ng can be described through a chain model including a persistence length and cross section. The measured radii of gyration (Rg = 27. 9 and 41. 0 ± 1 Å respectively) and largest distances (rmax = 110 and 155 ± 10 Å respectively) show that their average conformations are rather extended. The length of the statistical segment (twice the persistence length) is b = 30 Å, which is larger than the usual value (18 Å − 20 Å) for unstructured polypeptide chains. These characteristics are presumably related to the presence of polyproline helices within the polypeptidic backbones. For both proteins, the radius of gyration of the chain cross-section is Rc = 2. 7 ± 0. 2 Å. The glycosylated protein II- 1 has similar conformations but the presence of large <b>polyoside</b> sidegroups yields the structure of a branched macromolecule with the same hydrophobic backbone and hydrophilic branches. It is proposed that the unusually extended conformations of these proteins in solution facilitate the capture of plant tannins in the oral cavity...|$|E
40|$|The {{cardiovascular}} dysfunctions {{associated with}} septic shock induced by gram-negative or gram-positive bacteria (gram-positive or gram-negative septic shock) are comparable. In gram-negative septic shock, lipo-polysaccharide (LPS) induces nitric oxide (NO) synthase, which {{contributes to the}} vascular hypotension and hyporeactivity to vasoconstrictors. The role of NO in gram-positive septic shock {{and the nature of}} the bacterial wall components responsible for the vascular effects of gram-positive bacteria are not well known. This study investigated the vascular effects of cell wall serotype <b>polyosides,</b> rhamnose glucose polymers (RGPs), from Streptococcus mutans, in comparison with lipoteichoic acid (LTA) from Staphylococcus aureus, on the induction of NO synthase activity in the rat aorta. We show that 10 mg of both RGPs and LTA per ml induced hyporeactivity to noradrenaline, L-arginine-induced relaxation, increases of 2. 2 - and 7. 8 -fold, respectively, of cyclic GMP production, and increases of 7 - and 12 -fold in nitrite release. All of these effects appeared after several hours of incubation and were inhibited by Nv-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), an inhibitor of NO synthase. Electron paramagnetic resonance spin trapping experiments demonstrated directly that RGPs and LTA induced NO overproduction (four- to eightfold, respectively) in rat aortic rings; this production was inhibited by L-NAME and prevented by dexamethasone. These results demonstrate directly the induction of NO production in vascular tissue by LTA and show that another, chemically different component of gram-positiv...|$|R
