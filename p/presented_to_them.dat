5|$|Warren {{convened a}} meeting of the justices, and <b>presented</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> the simple {{argument}} that the only reason to sustain segregation was an honest belief in the inferiority of Negroes. Warren further submitted that the Court must overrule Plessy to maintain its legitimacy as an institution of liberty, and it must do so unanimously to avoid massive Southern resistance. He began to build a unanimous opinion.|$|E

25|$|McCaughey {{was married}} and had three {{children}} with his wife Angela. After McCaughey's arrest in 1978, his wife divorced him. In 1980, after the Cullybackey branch of the Apprentice Boys unfurled a banner <b>presented</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> by McCaughey, his former wife voiced her opposition and announced her intention to change her name and those of her children by deed poll.|$|E
25|$|Early in his life, Luther {{had argued}} that the Jews had been {{prevented}} from converting to Christianity by the proclamation of what he believed to be an impure gospel by the Catholic Church, and he believed they would respond favorably to the evangelical message if it were <b>presented</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> gently. He expressed concern for the poor conditions {{in which they were}} forced to live, and insisted that anyone denying that Jesus was born a Jew was committing heresy.|$|E

50|$|Many commedia erudita plays {{appealed to}} the baser {{instincts}} of the human beings watching them. Scripts were full of indecent remarks and behavior that was improper. Writers aimed to keep the attention of audience members by <b>presenting</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> sinful living.|$|R

25|$|Several {{medium and}} heavy {{elements}} like calcium, titanium, chromium, manganese, iron, cobalt, copper and zinc {{have been reported}} as detected by several researchers, like Tadahiko Mizuno or George Miley. The report presented to the United States Department of Energy (DOE) in 2004 indicated that deuterium-loaded foils {{could be used to}} detect fusion reaction products and, although the reviewers found the evidence <b>presented</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> as inconclusive, they indicated that those experiments did not use state-of-the-art techniques.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of drug-induced amnesia, it may be {{short-lived}} and patients can recover from it. In the other case, which has been studied extensively since the early 1970s, patients often have permanent damage, although some recovery is possible, depending {{on the nature of}} the pathophysiology. Usually, some capacity for learning remains, although it may be very elementary. In cases of pure anterograde amnesia, patients have recollections of events prior to the injury, but cannot recall day-to-day information or new facts <b>presented</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> after the injury occurred.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} Church, bishops were customarily {{elected by the}} clergy {{and the people of}} the diocese. While this simple method worked well in a small {{community}} of Christians unified by persecution, as the congregation grew in size, the acclamation of a new bishop was fraught with division, and rival claimants and a certain class hostility between patrician and plebeian candidates unsettled some episcopal elections. At the same time, 4th-century emperors expected each new pope-elect to be <b>presented</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> for approval, which sometimes led to state domination of the Church's internal affairs.|$|E

25|$|The {{situation}} with bumblebees (Bombus) is rather different. They too are unpalatable, {{in the sense}} of being difficult to eat: their body is covered with setae (like carpet pile) and is armoured; they are sometimes described as being 'non-food'. Mostler in 1935 carried out tests of their palatability: with the exception of specialist bee-eaters, adults of 19 species of birds ate only 2% of 646 bumblebees <b>presented</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> After various trials, Mostler attributed their avoidance mainly to mechanical difficulties in handling: one young bird took 18 minutes to subdue, kill and eat a bumblebee.|$|E
25|$|Early {{archaeology}} {{was largely}} {{an attempt to}} uncover spectacular artifacts and features, or to explore vast and mysterious abandoned cities. Early archaeology was mostly done by upper class, scholarly men. This generalization {{laid the foundation for}} the modern popular view of archaeology and archaeologists. This generalization has been with western culture for a long time. Another popular thought that dates back to this era is that archaeology is monetarily lucrative. A large majority of the general public is under the impression that excavations are undertaken for money and not historical data. It is easy for the general public to hold this notion for that is what is <b>presented</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> through general media, and has been for many decades.|$|E
25|$|Traveling by land, {{the royal}} party left for Spain on 28 September 1829. On their way, they visited Pope Pius VIII in Rome. In Grenoble, they met the Duchess of Berry, {{happy to see}} her parents after {{thirteen}} years. Once in Spain, the marriage was celebrated on 25 January 1830. On the way back, they were reunited once again with the Duchess of Berry who <b>presented</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> to her infant son, the Duke of Bordeaux, at Chambord. Maria Isabella and her husband went to Paris, where they were entertained by King Charles X. In June, the King and Queen left for Genoa reaching Naples on July 30. After their return, the king’s health deteriorated rapidly. He died on November 8, 1830.|$|E

25|$|In 2007, {{officials}} of Rockford, Illinois honored Cheap Trick by reproducing the Rockford album cover art on that year's city vehicle sticker. On June 19, 2007, the Illinois Senate passed Senate Resolution 255, which designated April 1 of every year as Cheap Trick Day in the State of Illinois. In August of that year, Cheap Trick honored the 40th anniversary of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band by playing the album {{in its entirety}} with the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra, conducted by Edwin Outwater, along with guest vocalists including Joan Osborne and Aimee Mann. Geoff Emerick, who engineered all the sound effects on Sgt. Pepper, engineered the same sounds for the two live concerts. The Chicago chapter of the National Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences honored Cheap Trick at the 2007 Recording Academy Honors event in Chicago on October 11, 2007. Nielsen and Carlos were present to receive the award, which was <b>presented</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> by Steve Albini.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternative}} framework {{has more}} recently been {{put forward by}} Wilken and Ma (2004) who suggest that apparent capacity limitations in VSTM are caused by a monotonic decline {{in the quality of}} the internal representations stored (i.e., monotonic increase in noise) as a function of set-size. In this conception capacity limitations in memory are not caused by a limit on the number of things that can be encoded, but by a decline in the quality of the representation of each thing as more things are added to memory. In their 2004 experiments, they varied color, spatial frequency, and orientation of objects stored in VSTM using a signal detection theory approach (see also the closely related work by Palmer, 1990). The participants were asked to report differences between the visual stimuli <b>presented</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> in consecutive order. The investigators found that different stimuli were encoded independently and in parallel, and that the major factor limiting report performance was neuronal noise (which is a function of visual set-size).|$|E
25|$|Investigating Team 6822, {{part of the}} U.S. War Crimes Program {{to create}} legal {{standards}} and judicial systems to prosecute Nazi crimes, quickly began to identify the perpetrators. By May 25, 1945 the investigations were complete and a report was sent to General Simpson, Supreme Commander of United States 9th Army. Many of the suspects were quickly captured and interned. Recorded testimony and photographic evidence {{formed the basis of}} the indictments. The process became complicated after the withdrawal of American forces from Thuringia on July 1, 1945, when the Mittelbau-Dora complex wound up in the Soviet occupation zone. On September 3, 1946 an exchange of detainees and evidence failed, as no Soviet military representatives appeared at a previously agreed meeting point on the frontier. Corresponding demands to the Soviet military administration remained mostly unanswered. Why Soviet authorities did not cooperate on Dora was unclear, since evidence <b>presented</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> on the Gardelegen Massacre resulted in the transfer of 22 suspects. The notebook of an American investigator indicates the possibility that due to unclear responsibilities among the Soviet investigators and their managers, they could not make a decision. Those Mittelbau-Dora suspects and evidence that were in U.S. custody were finally incorporated into the framework of the Dachau Trials.|$|E

25|$|September: Aldershot {{continued}} their early unbeaten {{run with a}} third consecutive 1–1 draw at home to Northampton, though the Shots needed a Ben Harding volley in the 5th minute of injury time to salvage a point. The next game - away to promotion-chasing Port Vale - promised {{to be a tough}} test, and this was proved right as the club suffered its first loss of the season, Gary Roberts scoring the only goal of the game. On 16 September the management brought in winger Marlon Jackson on loan from Bristol City, a player who assistant manager Gary Owers believed would help the team in the attacking third. Wycombe were the next visitors to the Recreation Ground, which meant a return for former Shots' boss Gary Waddock, who led the club to the Football Conference championship in the 2007–08 season. The match {{failed to live up to}} expectations, ending in a dull goalless draw. This fifth low-scoring draw of the season encouraged fears that the side were not good enough up front, and were not converting the few chances being <b>presented</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> The squad responded by taking a 2–0 lead away to Stockport in their next game, only to throw it away in the final minutes to draw yet again. A win did come before the end of the month, however, Morgan again netting in the final ten minutes to snatch all three points away to Torquay.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{troublesome}} 1980 {{season with}} suspension from {{the league and}} {{a victory for the}} Mapua Cardinals, the Letran Knights started the 1982 season under the tutelage of new coach Coach Larry Albano which featured a very exciting player named Samboy Lim. Samboy Lim is a graduate of San Beda High School and also played for the San Beda Red Cubs (the Juniors Basketball team of San Beda). After sweeping the first round, the Knights continued to pile up victories in the second round and was two wins ahead of #2 ranked San Sebastian. The Knights were unofficially crowned champions but they still had to play Trinity College in a no-bearing game to officially finish their NCAA campaign. The Knights lost that game 102-89 but it didn't matter as the school's 7th trophy was still <b>presented</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> In 1983, the heavily favored Samboy Lim and the Knights advanced to the championship round where they will meet Nani Demegillo and the San Sebastian Stags for the title. The championship game was decided on a best-of-3 series and both teams split the first two games but in Game 3 the Knights played inspired basketball due to Samboy Lim's heroic deed of choosing to play instead of resting in the hospital (he suffered an asthma attack in Game 2 and has to be sent in the hospital that night) and captured their 2nd straight championship. Romy Ang was named MVP of the season but Samboy Lim's heroics left an indelible impression to the hearts of those who witnessed it. With San Beda taking a leave of absence in 1984, the NCAA kicked off the season with only 5 schools participating but it didn't distract the Knights as they secured a date with history as the become the first school to finish the season undefeated and champions. Samboy Lim was named MVP of the season and RP Team patron Danding Cojuangco gave him a spot on the National Team roster.|$|E
