Soldiers were a normal <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>everyday</b> <b>life,</b> {{much more so}} than in modern Western societies. While it is difficult to draw a distinction between Roman and Byzantine soldiers from an organizational aspect, it is easier to do so in terms of their social profile. The military handbooks known as the Taktika continued a Hellenistic and Roman tradition, and contain a wealth of information about the appearance, customs, habits, and life of the soldiers.|$|E
5|$|The CNSA {{became a}} major <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>everyday</b> <b>life</b> and culture in {{occupied}} Belgium. The organization fulfilled much of the day-to-day running of a welfare system and generally prevented famine, although food and material shortages were extremely common throughout the occupation. At its height, the CNSA had more than 125,000 agents and distributors across the country. Historians have described the CNSA itself, with its central committee and local networks across the country, as paralleling {{the actions of the}} official Belgian government in peacetime. In the eyes of contemporaries, the CNSA became a symbol of national unity and of passive resistance.|$|E

The case study of Station north is an immediately relevant project meant to improve the city as a whole by attracting capital investment.

25|$|The {{traditional}} costumes of Denmark, though varying from {{region to}} region, date back roughly {{to the period}} between 1750 and 1900 when clothes were often home-made from yarn spun from wool or flax. In rural communities, the fabrication of garments for both family members and servants was an important <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>everyday</b> <b>life.</b> The artist Frederik Christian Lund, who had travelled across Denmark as {{a soldier in the}} First Schleswig War, took an interest in sketching people in local costumes {{in various parts of the}} country.

Among the most important Hindu festivals are Diwali, Holi and Vijayadashami, Mahashivaratri, Ram Navmi, Basant Panchami, Sri Krishna Janamastmi and Raksha Bandhan, which are also observed by Jains and Sikhs. Eid al-Milad, Eid ul-Fitr, Bakr-Id and Moharram are Muslim religious festivals.

This was spearheaded by the Englewood Business Men's Association and its director, Richard Drew. Mr. Drew died in 1978, and with his passing the Association lost its community focus. The Center subsequently lost its major anchor tenants, including Sears Roebuck, and became a collection of smaller merchants.|$|E

Regular route traffic from Helsinki to Stockholm, Tallinn, and St. Petersburg began as far back as 1837. Over 300 cruise ships and 360,000 cruise passengers visit Helsinki annually. There are international cruise ship docks in South Harbour, Katajanokka, West Harbour, and Hernesaari. Helsinki is the second busiest passenger port in Europe with approximately 11 million passengers in 2013. Ferry connections to Tallinn, Mariehamn, and Stockholm are serviced by various companies. Finnlines passenger-freight ferries to Gdynia, Poland; Travemünde, Germany; and Rostock, Germany are also available.

[...] Modern Barbadian tea meetings, tuk bands, the Landship tradition and many folk songs come from slaves parodying the practices of white authorities. British-Barbadians used music for cultural and intellectual enrichment and to feel a sense of kinship and connection with the British Isles through the maintenance of British musical forms. Plantation houses featured music as entertainment at balls, dances and other gatherings. For Afro-Barbadians, drum, vocal and dance music was an integral <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>everyday</b> <b>life,</b> and songs and performance practices were created for normal, everyday events, as well as special celebrations like Whitsuntide, Christmas, Easter, Landship and Crop Over.
