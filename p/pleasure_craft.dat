5|$|The canal carried {{commercial}} {{freight traffic}} until 1975; the last regular cargo was grain from Liverpool to Manchester for BOCM. It is now used mainly by <b>pleasure</b> <b>craft</b> and hosts two rowing clubs– Trafford Rowing Club and Manchester University Boat Club.|$|E
5|$|Presque Isle {{protects the}} natural Presque Isle Bay, which creates {{a deep and}} wide harbor {{for the city of}} Erie. The bay is often filled with <b>pleasure</b> <b>craft</b> as well as cargo ships {{from all over the world}} that use the Great Lakes {{shipping}} port. Erie became an international port after the opening of the Saint Lawrence Seaway in 1959.|$|E
5|$|The pier's {{secondary}} role {{was as a}} public pier, where <b>pleasure</b> <b>craft</b> were allowed to dock. Tour boats offering {{a view of the}} Kowloon side of the harbour used the pier for passenger boarding. Up to 1978, it was the finishing line for the annual cross-harbour swimming race. As the ceremonies declined, the pier's secondary purpose became the main one: people met and strolled in the area, and others fished.|$|E

50|$|The {{middling}} section between Oeversee and Langstedt and Treia {{developed to}} be a popular canoe district, the lower section {{can be used}} by <b>pleasure</b> <b>crafts</b> as well. In Schwabstedt, there is a public swimming site in the river.|$|R
5|$|Between 1761 and 1790, 14-15 turumas were built, {{including}} Amphion, {{a modified}} version used by King Gustav III as both a <b>pleasure</b> <b>craft</b> and command ship. The turuma was among the heaviest in the arsenal of the archipelago fleet {{and a number of}} them served in the Russo-Swedish War of 1788–90. It had three masts, two decks and was equipped with 16–22 pairs of oars along with a crew of about 220–260. Its length was 35–39m, width 9m and the draft 3,3m. The armament consisted of 24–28 heavy guns with up to 24 swivel guns for close-quarter combat.|$|E
5|$|Iden Lock {{connected}} the Royal Military Canal to the river. The last commercial barge to pass from the Rother through Iden lock onto the canal was the Vulture, carrying 27 tons of shingle on 15 December 1909. After that, the lock {{was replaced by}} a sluice, severing the navigable connection. The river was used by <b>pleasure</b> <b>craft</b> in Edwardian times, when regular boat trips from Scots Float Sluice, then called Star Lock, to Bodiam Castle were offered. The lower river is currently used for moorings, and the Bodiam Ferry Company operate a trip boat from Newenden Bridge to Bodiam Castle.|$|E
5|$|The tug Atlantic Elm {{lost its}} tow to the {{unmanned}} barge Portland Star on October19. The barge was carrying over 18,000 tonnes of cement and diesel fuel {{and was later}} reported to have sunk in the Fortune Bay. Damage was reported to numerous <b>pleasure</b> <b>craft</b> around the bay due to the waves; two sailboats were toppled. Also, ferry service between Newfoundland and Nova Scotia was disrupted. Several offshore buoys and ships reported high winds and low barometric pressure, as well as waves of up to 16.9m (55ft).|$|E
5000|$|Dart Venturer Originally {{built as}} Plymouth Venturer for Plymouth Boat Cruises in 1982, this 300 {{passenger}} vessel ran for them until 2002, {{when it was}} [...] "swapped" [...] with Dart <b>Pleasure</b> <b>Craft's</b> smaller Plymouth Belle. Used {{on all of the}} services.|$|R
50|$|As well as barges, Cooks yard {{built the}} {{steamboat}} Annie for Charrington the brewer. The Annie {{was used for}} taking passengers to Osea Island, {{and it was the}} first of a succession of <b>pleasure</b> <b>crafts</b> that set off from the beach at Maldon promenade.|$|R
50|$|River traffic has {{the right}} of way, and the swing bridge must even open for privately owned <b>pleasure</b> <b>crafts</b> or face fines from the Coast Guard, though it is speculated that the {{railroad}} would often take the fines over the cost of stopping a train.|$|R
5|$|Vessels at sea {{do not use}} the {{national}} flag as an ensign. Merchant vessels and <b>pleasure</b> <b>craft</b> fly a civil ensign of red charged in white with {{a variant of the}} crescent and stars emblem in the centre. Non-military government vessels such as coast guard ships fly a state ensign of blue with {{the national}} flag in the canton, charged with an eight-pointed red and white compass rose in the lower fly. Naval warships fly a naval ensign similar to the state ensign, but in white with a red compass rose emblem.|$|E
5|$|A {{wide variety}} of small vessels {{from all over the}} south of England were pressed into service to aid in the Dunkirk evacuation. They {{included}} speedboats, Thames vessels, car ferries, <b>pleasure</b> <b>craft,</b> and many other types of small craft. The most useful proved to be the motor lifeboats, which had a reasonably good capacity and speed. Some boats were requisitioned without the owner's knowledge or consent. Agents of the Ministry of Shipping, accompanied by a naval officer, scoured the Thames for likely looking vessels, had them checked for seaworthiness, and took them downriver to Sheerness, where naval crews were to be placed aboard. Due to shortages of personnel, many small craft crossed the Channel with civilian crews.|$|E
5|$|Damage {{was also}} {{reported}} in Prince Edward Island {{as a result}} of the storm, particularly around Charlottetown, where its waterfront sustained heavy wave damage to <b>pleasure</b> <b>craft</b> and sea walls, as well as significant damage to the older urban forest in that city's downtown core. Extensive tree damage was also reported across the island, as well as structural damage to weaker buildings, such as barns and silos. The hurricane left portions of the island without power. The narrow path meant that damage was quite localized; little damage was reported in New Brunswick or western Prince Edward Island. Voting in the PEI general election on September29 was also disrupted, though more than 80% of voters made it to polling stations.|$|E

5000|$|Narita {{developed}} the world's {{first use of}} the catamaran-like design for large commercial ferries—the [...] "small waterplane area twin hull" [...] or SWATH configuration. The demonstrated stability and seaworthiness of these ferries led to {{the increased use of}} a similar vessel design in contexts, including naval ships, oceanographic survey ships, <b>pleasure</b> <b>crafts</b> and sightseeing boats.|$|R
5|$|Significant change {{occurred}} when the Manchester Ship Canal was opened in 1894. The tidal section of the river below Frodsham now flowed into the ship canal, rather than the River Mersey, and the exit lock from Weston Docks also joined the canal rather than the estuary. A new ship lock was constructed at Weston Marsh, which provided a more convenient route to the ship canal than the alternative route through Weston Point docks. The Weston Canal has been little used since. Although {{it is possible for}} <b>pleasure</b> <b>craft</b> to reach the Weaver from the Ship Canal, it is a commercial waterway, and most leisure users are dissuaded from doing so by the amount of paperwork and the requirements of the operating company.|$|E
5|$|Below Spalding, {{there were}} no {{restrictions}} on headroom, which allowed small coasters to reach the town. The bridge at Fosdyke was a swing bridge, {{to comply with the}} provisions of the Fosdyke Bridge Act of 1870. The demise of such traffic allowed it {{to be replaced by a}} fixed bridge with headroom of , but the powers of the original act had to be rescinded, and the Port of Fosdyke Act was obtained in 1987 to allow this to happen. The redundant wharfs at Fosdyke have been developed to provide moorings for yachts and other <b>pleasure</b> <b>craft.</b> The lock at Fulney has three sets of gates, two pointing towards the sea, and a third between them which points upriver. The lock can thus only be used when the level below it is higher than the level above it, and as the tide falls, the intermediate gate closes to prevent its use.|$|E
5|$|Between 1848 and 1905, {{traffic on}} Beverley Beck more than trebled, from 33,498 tons to 101,540 tons. Coal and other {{minerals}} accounted for around {{one quarter of}} the traffic in 1905, while goods carried in 1906 included fertiliser, burnt ore, flour and scrap metal. Commercial traffic continued into the 1970s, when tolls of £2,365 were collected on 28,169 tons of cargo. Traffic on the Driffield Navigation was relatively steady between 1871 and 1905, falling slightly from 35,654 to 32,666 tons. Goods carried included coal, linseed, cottonseed, wheat, flour and artificial manures. In 1922, £7 of income was received from <b>pleasure</b> <b>craft</b> using the navigation. Traffic declined during the 1930s, with commercial traffic finally ceasing in 1944. The Leven Canal carried 4,242 tons in 1888 and 4,546 in 1905, but then succumbed to road competition, and closed in 1935.|$|E
50|$|He {{exhibited}} {{his works}} from 1898 in Bergen. He {{exhibited at the}} Exposition Universelle (1900). Several of his paintings were executed in large dimensions. In 1909, Aagaard was in Trondheim, where he painted a large painting from the harbor featuring <b>pleasure</b> <b>crafts.</b> His work is on public display at the Bergen Maritime Museum, Nordmøre Museum, and Trondhiem Maritime Museum among other locations.|$|R

50|$|The Cal-Sag Channel serves barge {{traffic in}} what was an active zone of heavy {{industry}} in the far southern neighborhoods {{of the city of}} Chicago and adjacent suburbs. As of 2006 it was also used more as a conduit for wastewater from southern Cook County, including the Chicago-area Deep Tunnel Project, into the Illinois Waterway. It is also used by <b>pleasure</b> <b>crafts</b> in the summer time.|$|R
5|$|The {{lift bridge}} {{is the last}} of several {{previous}} crossings over the waterway. A wooden swing bridge was built in 1875. A newer, iron swing bridge was built in 1897; this structure was partially destroyed in 1905 when it was struck by a ship. This second crossing was rebuilt in 1906 and remained in service until the lift bridge was opened in December 1959. The current bridge was last used for railroad traffic in the summer of 1982, after the Soo Line rail lines north of Houghton were abandoned starting in 1976. The middle section is left in an intermediate position for the warmer nine months of the year so that vehicle traffic can use the lower deck of the lift span and <b>pleasure</b> <b>craft</b> can pass under the bridge. In the winter, the lift span is lowered so snowmobiles and skiers can use the lower deck while cars and trucks use the upper deck.|$|E
5|$|Fifteen {{or twenty}} barges were still using {{the river in}} the 1880s, {{although}} the upper reaches were no longer accessible. Arundel docks silted up between 1875 and 1896. In 1898, the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway, who by this time were {{the owners of the}} railway from Horsham to Littlehampton, drilled down into the tunnel where the main line and the branch to Midhurst crossed its course, and poured tons of chalk into the tunnel to stabilise it. A trade in chalk and lime extracted from Amberley chalk pits continued into the early twentieth century. Some ships were towed to Arundel by paddle tugs, and imports of salt, timber and coal for the gasworks continued. Arundel was visited by its last steamer in 1914, and the last sailing vessel to reach the port did so three years later. Passage of larger craft upstream was hindered by the construction of a swing bridge at Littlehampton in 1908, and prevented by a fixed railway bridge at Ford built in 1938. As freight traffic disappeared from the river, Edward Slaughter, who later became part of the company of Buller and Slaughter, was hiring <b>pleasure</b> <b>craft</b> by 1903, and the company was still doing so in the 1990s.|$|E
25|$|In 1798 the {{construction}} of the Grand Junction Canal reached Hemel Hempstead. Now part of the Grand Union Canal, it is a popular route for narrowboat <b>pleasure</b> <b>craft</b> and is maintained by the Canal & River Trust.|$|E
50|$|It was {{typically}} about 80 ft long {{with a maximum}} beam width of around 10 ft. It was modified from the penteconter, a ship that had only one set of oars on each side, the bireme having two sets of oars on each side. The bireme was twice the triaconter's length and height, and thus employed 120 rowers. Biremes were galleys, galleasses, dromons, and small <b>pleasure</b> <b>crafts</b> pamphyles.|$|R

The maritime service is intended for <b>pleasure</b> <b>crafts,</b> fishing and coastal ships, ferries and smaller commercial cargo carriers, operating mainly in the North and Baltic Seas, and the northern Mediterranean. and provides the same always-on high-speed Internet connection for web browsing, VoIP telephone, email, etc.|$|R
50|$|Galveston Bay {{supports}} a significant recreation and tourism industry, especially {{as a result}} of its proximity to major population centers. Over 40% of Greater Houston residents participate annually in hiking and swimming along the bay, while 20% go fishing and 15% go boating. The five counties surrounding the bay are home to 88,000 registered <b>pleasure</b> <b>crafts.</b> Fishing expenditures (such as the purchase of fishing bait or lodging) along Galveston Bay and Sabine Lake generate approximately $650 million annually. The recreational fishing industry supports over 3,000 jobs in the bay area.|$|R
25|$|On September 14, 2000, Spirit of Vancouver Island {{collided}} with the 9.72 m (about 32ft) Star Ruby while attempting to overtake the vessel in a narrow channel. The collision occurred approximately 1km (about ½mi) from the Swartz Bay Terminal, where the ferry had departed from. Spirit of Vancouver Island struck Star Ruby on its port side, causing the <b>pleasure</b> <b>craft</b> to flip over and eventually right itself, though swamped and heavily damaged. According to the accident report, the <b>pleasure</b> <b>craft</b> ignored all warning blasts from the approaching ferry and then made a sharp turn towards the ferry just prior to impact. Two passengers aboard Star Ruby later {{died as a result}} of injuries sustained by the collision.|$|E
25|$|After {{delivery}} in 1960, Point Glover {{was assigned a}} homeport of Fort Hancock, New Jersey, where she served as a law enforcement and search and rescue patrol boat. On 6 May 1962, she towed a disabled <b>pleasure</b> <b>craft</b> near Sandy Hook, New Jersey.|$|E

50|$|Off {{the coast}} of Lau are three islands, known as the Laus Holmar (the Lau Islets). Despite their name, they belong to the {{neighboring}} Alskog socken and not to Lau. Their names are Skarpholmen, Gräsholmen and Storholmen. The two first ones are owned by the Swedish government, and have been designated as bird reserves. The last one, Storholmen, is divided into allotments belonging to farms in Lau and Alskog. It is mainly used for grazing sheep. The lighthouse on Storholmen is called Storholms-Annika. When the Swedish Maritime Administration wanted to decommission it, the lighthouse was bought by the Lau Heritage Society since it was deemed vital for local <b>pleasure</b> <b>crafts</b> and fishermen.
