Detection of tumor cells in bone marrow disseminated tumor cells (DTC) and in peripheral blood circulating tumor cells (CTC) in nonmetastatic situation is of high prognostic significance. Compared to breast, colon and prostate cancers, the studies on CTC and DTC in head and neck cancers are sparse. The objective of our study was to detect DTC in drains after neck dissection. Fourteen patients undergoing surgery for stages III and IV head and neck cancers were enrolled in this study-twelve presenting with squamous cell carcinoma and two with adenocarcinoma. Redon drain analysis was performed by the Cellsearch method using immunomagnetic and fluorescence approaches. A positivity threshold value was set at 2 DTC/ 7. 5 ml of the sample. Tumor cells were detected in drains of 69 % of patients {{a few days after}} surgery. The range of quantification was 3 - 2, 094 DTC/ 5 ml and we showed morphological differences between the two types of carcinoma cells.

He then stood by his testimony when giving interviews. A settlement was reached in February 2006 before the three-person arbitration panel made a ruling. As part of the settlement, SCA Promotions paid Armstrong and Tailwind Sports $7.5 million, to cover the $5-million bonus plus interest and lawyers' fees. In a statement, Armstrong said, [...] "It's over. We won. They lost. I was yet again completely vindicated." [...] Armstrong's statement also suggested that Betsy Andreu may have been confused by possible mention of his <b>post-operative</b> <b>treatment</b> which included steroids and EPO that are routinely taken to counteract wasting and red-blood-cell destroying effects of intensive chemotherapy.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Biliary tract cancer {{presents}} a poor prognosis. AIMS: The {{objective of this}} study is to find clinical-laboratory parameters like prognostic factors to select patients who can benefit from surgery and <b>post-operative</b> <b>treatments.</b> METHODS: Between 2005 and 2010, 41 patients underwent radical surgery at our Institution. A novel score was retrospectively calculated assigning a grade to the clinical-laboratory findings at diagnosis. 0 and 1 point were respectively assigned to the normal or abnormal parameter. Two groups were identified: SCORE 0 and SCORE 1. RESULTS: Patients with cholangiocarcinoma or Klatskin tumours or asymptomatic at diagnosis presented a significantly better overall survival (OS) than patients with different primary sites or who presented pain, jaundice or cholangitis. At univariate analysis, high levels of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase and CA 19 - 9 before surgery, hyperbilirubinemia before and after surgery had a negative correlation with OS. A worse OS was observed in patients with a higher score (median OS in the "score 0 " group= 30. 79 months vs. median OS in the "score 1 "= 17. 98 months).

The development of innovative systems and elaboration processes is an upcoming issue for ocular drug delivery. One challenging issue is the elaboration of drug loaded intraocular lenses (IOLs) to combine cataract surgery and <b>post-operative</b> <b>treatments</b> in a single procedure. In this work, we are studying the elaboration of such systems while using a green process using supercritical fluids for impregnating ophthalmic drugs on commercial IOLs. More particularly, rigid commercial intraocular lenses made from Poly (Methyl MethAcrylate) (PMMA), used in cataract surgery, are loaded with dexamethasone 21 - phosphate disodium salt (DXP, an anti-inflammatory drug) and ciprofloxacin (CIP, an antibiotic) in order to prevent short- and mid-term postoperative complications. Supercritical impregnations were carried out in a batch mode and impregnation yields were determined through drug release kinetic studies in a solution simulating the aqueous humor. Before performing an experimental design, preliminary impregnation assays were conducted in order to delimit the operating domain. Transparent IOLs presenting an effective impregnation were obtained. The highest impregnation yields for DXP and CIP in PMMA IOLs were 18. 3 and 2. 8 μgdrug/mgIOL respectively. Despite the low solubility of each drug in the fluid phase, homogeneous and in-depth impregnations were successfully obtained with a prolonged drug delivery (about 40 days) for most impregnation experiments...|$|R

Notorious throughout the world, the quintessential leech family Hirudinidae has been taken for granted to be monophyletic, as has the non-bloodfeeding family Haemopidae. Results This study is the first to evaluate molecular evidence from hirudinid and haemopid leeches in a manner that encompasses the global scope of their taxonomic distributions. We evaluated the presumed monophyly of the Hirudinidae and assessed previous well-accepted classification schemes. The Hirudinidae were found not to be monophyletic, falling instead into two distinct and unrelated clades. Members of the non-bloodfeeding family Haemopidae were scattered throughout the tree and among traditional hirudinid genera. A combination of nuclear 18 S rDNA and 28 S rDNA with mitochondrial 12 S rDNA and cytochrome c oxidase I were analyzed with Parsimony and with Bayesian methods. Conclusion The family Hirudinidae must be refined to include only the clade containing Hirudo medicinalis (European medicinal leech) and related leeches irrespective of bloodfeeding behavior. A second clade containing Macrobdella decora (North American medicinal leech) and its relatives may yet be recognized in Semiscolecidae in order to avoid paraphyly. The African distribution of species from each of the divergent hirudinid clades suggests that a deep divergence took place {{in the history of the}} medicinal leeches hundreds of millions of years ago. </p...|$|R
