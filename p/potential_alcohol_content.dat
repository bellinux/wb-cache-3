40|$|During malolactic {{fermentation}} (MLF), {{lactic acid}} bacteria influence wine aroma and flavour by the production of volatile metabolites and the modification of aroma compounds derived from grapes and yeasts. The present study investigated the impact of different MLF inoculation strategies with two different Oenococcus oeni strains on cool climate Riesling wines and the volatile wine aroma profile. Four different timings were chosen for inoculation with bacteria to conduct MLF in a Riesling must/wine with a high acidity (pH 2. 9 - 3. 1). Treatments with simultaneous inoculation showed a reduced total fermentation time (alcoholic and malolactic) compared to the sequential inoculations. No negative impact of simultaneous alcoholic and malolactic fermentation on fermentation success and on the final wine volatile aroma composition was observed. Compared to sequential inoculation, wines with co-inoculation tended to have higher concentrations of ethyl and acetate esters, including acetic acid phenylethylester, acetic acid 3 -methylbutylester, butyric acid ethylester, lactic acid ethylester and succinic acid diethylester.

50|$|Once {{fermentation}} {{has been}} completed, {{at a minimum}} alcohol level of 10% (which is often exceeded), the alcoholic strength of Commandaria may be increased {{by the addition of}} pure 95% grape alcohol or a wine distillate of at least 70% alcohol. However, after this addition, the wine's actual <b>alcohol</b> <b>content</b> may not exceed 20%, while its total <b>potential</b> <b>alcohol</b> (including its sugar content) must be at least 22.5%. Thus, Commandaria may be a fortified wine, but fortification is not mandatory.|$|R
50|$|Muscat de Rivesaltes is an Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée (AOC) for {{fortified}} wines (of {{the type}} vin doux naturel) {{made in the}} Roussillon wine region of France. They are similar to Rivesaltes AOC wines, except for the grape varieties used. The wines are white, and made from Muscat d'Alexandrie and Muscat à Petits Grains grapes, usually in equal quantities, although the appellation rules allow these varieties {{to be used in}} any proportion. The alcohol content must be at least 15 per cent by volume, the <b>potential</b> <b>alcohol</b> <b>content</b> at least 21.5 per cent, and the sugar content (fermentable sugars, glucose and fructose) of the finished wine at least 100 grams per liter.|$|E
5000|$|The Château-Chalon AOC is {{dedicated}} {{exclusively to the}} production of vin jaune wine. There are other appellations within Jura that are permitted to produce AOC vin jaune, most notably the Côtes du Jura AOC, but Château-Chalon has specific regulations that are unique to this AOC. To begin with, the grapes must be harvested at brix levels that allow for a <b>potential</b> <b>alcohol</b> <b>content</b> of at least 12% in the finished wine; other regions will allow a minimum of 11.5%. While the grapes are harvested late, they are never botrytized, unlike other well known late harvest French wines such as Sauternes. After fermentation the wine must be stored for at least six years and three months prior to bottling. The majority of time is spent in wood casks that are only partially filled, allowing for a film of yeast, known as the voile or [...] "veil", to develop across the surface. This voile yeast is similar to the benevolent flor yeast that is used in sherry production, and vin jaune shares some similarities in styles to sherry, though vin jaune is not fortified.|$|E
50|$|On its own, Gros Manseng has the {{potential}} to produce intensely flavored wines with high acidity, apricot and quince fruit along with spicy and floral notes. The time of harvest will play a large role in the type of wine that the grape will produce. When it is picked at a potential alcohol level of 11.5-12%, the resulting wine will have more characteristics of fresh fruit and flowers. If picked later at a <b>potential</b> <b>alcohol</b> <b>content</b> of 12.5-13.5, the flavors will be much more intense and powerful. Despite its thick skin, the grape does need gentle handling in the winemaking process. Unlike many wine grapes, the juice of the Gros Manseng is grey in color which means that it is already prone to produce deeply, golden colored wines with minimal skin contact. If the grapes are pressed too roughly or the grapes are left in extended contact with the skins, the resulting wine will be very coarse with excessive levels of tannins and polyphenols. Some winemakers are experimenting with making botrytized wine aged in oak that have drawn favorable comparisons to similarly made wine from Sémillon. That style wine is prized for its food matching ability, particularly with foie gras.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The wine {{quality was}} {{determined}} for partially-defoliated grapevines grown in Villa de Leyva, Colombia at {{an elevation of}} 2, 143 masl. The experimental design was totally randomized, with two treatments (50 % defoliation and 0 % defoliation) and three repetitions per treatment. The planting material consisted of five-year-old vines of Vitis vinifera cv. Chardonnay, trained to trellises, with a spacing of 2. 1 m x 1 m. Every fifteen days, the plants in the defoliation treatment underwent the removal of half of the newly-emerged leaves. Before undertaking the micro-vinification process, the total soluble solids (TSS) were measured in the grape must, and after a fermentation of 100 days, wine quality parameters were measured, namely: residual sugars (TSS of the wine), pH, total titratable acid (TTA), and <b>potential</b> <b>alcohol</b> <b>content</b> of the wine.

40|$|Grapevines Vitis vinifera L. ‘Shiraz’ {{were exposed}} to {{hydrogen}} fluoride in open-top chambers for 189 days at mean atmospheric fluoride concentrations of 0 · 27, 0 · 17 or 0 · 07 μgHFm− 3. Grapevines growing under ambient conditions outside the chambers {{were exposed to}} a mean atmospheric fluoride concentration of 0 · 08 μgHFm− 3. The maximum leaf fluoride concentrations associated with these treatments were 62, 27, 9 and 15 μFg− 1, respectively. Foliar necrosis was first observed on grapevines exposed to 0 · 27 and 0 · 17 μgHFm− 3 after 83 and 99 days, respectively. Exposure to fluoride increased the fluoride content of berries and peduncles, and reduced leaf chlorophyll a and total chlorophyll concentration at both mid-season and harvest. Exposure to 0 · 17 μgHFm− 3 was associated with higher total acid content of grapes than other treatments. Fluoride had no significant effect on bunch weight, number of bunches, grape yield, grape water or <b>potential</b> <b>alcohol</b> <b>content,</b> leaf chlorophyll b or leaf protein concentration. The high accumulation of fluoride in peduncles, but low fluoride accumulation in berries, suggests that the peduncle acts to block the translocation of fluoride from sites of uptake to the fruit...|$|E

Has the <b>alcohol</b> <b>content</b> of wine risen—and if so, by how much, where, and when?

In this paper we explore these questions using international evidence, combining time-series data on the <b>alcohol</b> <b>content</b> of wine from a large number of countries that experienced different patterns of climate change and influences of policy and demand shifts.
