40|$|AIM: An ileorectal bypass {{performed}} entirely {{through a}} transanal route {{has recently been}} described in an animal model. The present study aimed study aimed to demonstrate its technical feasibility in four human cadavers. METHOD: A transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM) device and endoscopic instruments were used The principal steps of the procedure included insertion of the TEM device, rectostomy above the peritoneal reflection, peritoneoscopy using a standard gastroscopy, delivery of the small bowel through the <b>proctostomy</b> to perform an anastomosis.; RESULTS: The procedure was successfully completed using transanal access in all cases. The mean procedural time was 90 minutes. The bypass was patent and the anastomosis between the intraperitoneal rectum and the terminal ileum was leak-proof. CONCLUSION: Transanal leoproctostomy is technically feasible in human cadavers. The procedure may become an alternative in selected patients, to stoma for formation for patients with colonic obstruction...|$|E
40|$|We {{report a}} {{clinical}} case of {{carcinoma of the}} rectum. A 45 -year-old patient had undergone resection of the rectum and <b>proctostomy</b> 22 months ago. Carcinoma caused metastasis to the corpora cavernosa of the penis in this patient, and caused local recurrence of the carcinoma of the rectum, pulmonary metastasis and malignant priapism. A statistical analysis of 62 cases of secondary tumor of the penis in Japan was also made. The present clinical case was the 62 nd case of secondary tumor of the penis in Japan, and the 4 th case of secondary penile tumor from the rectum. The primary foci of the secondary tumor of the penis are mostly in the urinary bladder and the prostate, followed by the rectum, kidney, {{pelvis of the kidney}} and the ureter. Primary sites in the urogenital organs were found in 82. 3 % and in the neighboring organs in 85. 2 %. As the route of metastasis of the secondary tumor of the penis, arterial blood, retrovenous, retro-lymph and direct infiltrating metastasis may be possible. Secondary tumor of the penis is mostly found in aged persons, and the major symptoms may be penile nodule and mass, malignant priapism, penile pain and tenderness, and difficulty in urination and retention of urine. Regardless of the length to metastasis and difference in the treatment of the metastatic focus, the secondary tumor of the penis is poor in prognosis, and survival period may be up to 7 months. From the findings of post-mortem examination, secondary tumor of the penis should be regarded as a secondary sign due to recurrence of the primary tumor or presence of metastasis in other organs, and careless surgical operation should be avoided...|$|E
