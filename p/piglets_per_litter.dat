40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} the effects of type of artificial-insemination catheter on litter size and farrowing rate and to evaluate the economic differences between the two catheters {{on the basis of the}} differences observed in reproductive performance. Materials and methods: Three hundred eighty-nine sows were allotted into two experimental groups by parity, body condition score, and breed-of-sire influence. Sow matings were performed using a disposable foam-tipped intrauterine catheter (IU, n = 193) or a cervical catheter (IC, n = 196). Total number of <b>piglets</b> born <b>per</b> <b>litter</b> was recorded, and farrowing rates were calculated after all sows had farrowed or returned to estrus. Results: Farrowing rates were 67. 8 % and 66. 3 %, while total numbers of piglets born (mean ± SE) were 9. 39 ± 0. 55 and 9. 74 ± 0. 53 <b>per</b> <b>litter</b> for the IU and IC groups, respectively. Numbers of piglets born alive were 8. 97 ± 0. 54 and 9. 29 ± 0. 52 <b>per</b> <b>litter</b> for the IU and IC groups, respectively.

40|$|The {{survival}} rates of pigs subjected to different farrowing management protocols were compared. 60 litters of YorkxLandrace piglets were either unattended at farrowing or were dried, had {{the umbilical cord}} tied, had oral and nasal cavities suctioned to clear mucus, received oxygen and received bovine colostrum, all within 2 min of delivery. Mortality rates and their causes, weight gains, and haematocrit levels were recorded for the first 3 weeks of life. Total preweaning mortality was 18. 2 and 10. 1 % for the control and attended groups, respectively. The main impact of the treatment was {{the reduction of the}} animals that otherwise would have been classified as stillbirths. The stillbirth rate decreased from 6. 8 to 1. 6 % while the mortality rate during the first day decreased from 5. 2 % in the unattended litters to 2. 2 % in the attended litters, respectively. At weaning the weights of the attended piglets were higher than those of the unattended animals and overall weight gains were higher in the attended litters when compared with those of the control litters (3. 99 +or- 0. 08 and 3. 68 +or- 0. 06 kg, respectively). It is suggested that the reduction in mortality of 44 % (equivalent to about one <b>piglet</b> <b>per</b> <b>litter),</b> plus the benefit of enhanced performance in the attended group, could justify the implementation of a farrowing protocol which involves adding the extra labour at farrowing time, especially if several sows are attended by the same attendant. ...|$|R

From May to June 2001, 6 farrowing paddocks were naturally contaminated with A. suum using experimentally infected seeder pigs. Early July, 1 sow farrowed on each paddock. One <b>piglet</b> <b>per</b> <b>litter</b> was slaughtered every second week starting at week 3 post-partum (p. p.) for registration of liver white spots and recovery of A. suum from the lungs {{and the small}} intestine. The last pigs were slaughtered at week 19 p. p. Faeces was examined for parasite eggs and blood was analysed for A. suum-specific antibodies. Weaning took place at week 7 p. p. by removing the sow. Paddock infection levels were estimated by regular examination of soil samples and in late June and late November using parasite na tracer pigs. Paddock contamination was high but eggs developed slowly resulting in a low initial transmission to the experimental pigs. By week 5 p. p. transmission had increased and the numbers of infective eggs in the soil increased during the study. The results indicate a continuous uptake of infective eggs, but visceral larval migration was reduced with time, {{probably due to the}} development of a pre-hepatic barrier. Nevertheless, a rather large population of adult worms remained in the pigs throughout the study, and it may primarily have been eggs ingested in the early infection phase that gave rise to the patent infections.

Long-term consequences on gut adaptation to a high fat diet wereexamined in growing offspring. Sows were given amoxicillin (AMX; 40 mg/kg/d) per os (n= 11 AMX) ornot (n= 12 CTL) from 10 d before to 21 d after parturition. One <b>piglet</b> <b>per</b> <b>litter</b> was sacrificed at post-natalday (PND) 14, 21 and after weaning at PND 42. The remaining ones were given either a low fat (LF) or ahigh fat (HF) diet (to enhance LPS epithelial passage) from PND 140 to 169. At PND 14, ileal permeabilitywas greater in AMX than CTL piglets (P< 0. 05). At PND 21, no increase in proliferation of lamina propriamononuclear cells (LPMCs) in response to LPS was noticed, demonstrating LPMC tolerance in bothgroups. Analysis of laser-captured enterocyte transcriptome indicated specific changes in immune responsepathways. Especially differential expression of BFIFB 1, HPSE and FSTL 4 genes demonstrated stimulationof proinflammatory activity, corroborating the increased TNFα secretion in response to LPS observed inLPMCs of AMX piglets. At PND 42 gene analysis suggested a repression of the immune response towardsweaning-induced stress in AMX piglets. At PND 169, HF diet increased ileal permeability in CTL offspringonly. By contrast, ileal explant sensitivity to LPS was altered in HF pigs, especially in AMX-HF pigs. Manipulating maternal microbiota modified offspring ileal barrier and immune response to LPS during theneonatal period.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{two studies}} {{that form the}} basis of the Samoan Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries’ (MAF) recent efforts to enhance its animal disease surveillance capacity. The first study investigated a method of enhancing the surveillance value of veterinary case data collected by the MAF’s Animal Health Service, which provides the only veterinary service for livestock in the country, through temporal analysis of cases and syndromes by species. Threshold levels generated from 3 -monthly moving averages combined over 3 years of veterinary case data were used to identify unusually high numbers of cases and the cause of these unusual events were investigated. Further, the analysis of data in the system identified gaps in the coverage of the Animal Health Service which helped identify alternative methods for conducting surveillance in these areas using the Crops Division advisory officers. The objective of the second study was to identify if the veterinary case data collected by the Animal Health Service represented pig health problems in the general population. Reproduction and mortality patterns were compared on a group of 10 holdings that were regularly attended by the veterinary staff and 13 holdings that did not utilise the Animal Health Service. The performance of these holdings, measured in liveborn <b>piglets</b> <b>per</b> sow year and pre-weaning and post-weaning mortality were compared given their status as client or non-client of the service and their exposure to various management factors like confinement, protein supplementation, frequency of feeding, management time per sow per day, the use of improved or exotic breeds, the extent of commercial activity and, in the case of piglets their season of birth (rainy or dry season). The mean number of sows per herd was 6, producing a mean litter size of 6. 1 piglets with a mean interfarrowing interval of 235 days. The median pre-weaning mortality <b>per</b> <b>litter</b> was 0 and a median of 1 <b>piglet</b> <b>per</b> <b>litter</b> was used for productive purposes (consumed, gifted or sold) at a median age of 153 days. It was found that the greatest influence on productivity in these holdings was nutrition. Sow productivity (in terms of liveborn <b>piglets</b> <b>per</b> sow year and pre-weaning survival) was best in the non-client, free range herds that did not provide protein supplementation (but whose feeding was unrestricted due to their freedom to roam and scavenge) and worst in client and non-client herds that were confined and not given protein supplementation (due to restricted and underfeeding). The mortality of pigs postweaning was significantly higher if they were free roaming, due to their loss to predation, theft and being hit by car. The study showed that the health status of pigs was better on holdings that did not use the Animal Health Service compared with those that did...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} 2 oxytocin products administered to sows {{at the onset of}} fetal expulsion on the integrity of umbilical cords, meconium staining, and piglet mortality. ANIMALS: 2099 neonatal pigs. PROCEDURE: 180 parturient sows were randomly assigned to 3 stratified groups of 60 sows each. Two groups of sows were injected IM at the onset of fetal expulsion with 1 of 2 oxytocin commercial products (20, 40, or 50 U for sows weighing 120 to 150 kg, 151 to 250 kg, or > or = 251 kg, respectively). Control sows were treated IM with saline (0. 9 % NaCI) solution. Farrowing time, expulsion intervals, and numbers of stillborn and liveborn piglets were recorded for each sow. Piglets were evaluated for inspiratory effort, heart rates, and degree of meconium staining of skin (nonstained, and moderately or severely stained). Umbilical cords were classified as normal in appearance, edematous, congested, hemorrhagic, or ruptured. RESULTS: Oxytocin-treated sows had a significant decrease in farrowing time and expulsion intervals and also had a significantly higher number of stillborn <b>piglets</b> <b>per</b> <b>litter,</b> compared with control sows. The number of <b>piglets</b> <b>per</b> <b>litter</b> with ruptured and hemorrhagic umbilical cords was significantly greater in oxytocin-treated sows, compared with control sows. In near-death stillborn piglets, oxytocin treatment significantly decreased inspiratory efforts at birth and increased the rate and severity of meconium staining, compared with saline treatment. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Oxytocin given to sows at the onset of fetal expulsion significantly increases the rate of fetal distress, anoxia, and intrapartum death in piglets...|$|E
40|$|Scientists In the UK have {{launched}} a research programme to discover why the Chinese Meishan pig is so prolific; it produces {{an average of}} 14 to 16 <b>piglets</b> <b>per</b> <b>litter</b> compared to 10 to 12 in western breeds. The Meishan pig comes from the Shanghai area {{and is one of}} more than 70 breed types found in China. Despite the excellent breeding characteristics of the Meishan, its growth is slow and it carries excessive carcass fat making it of little direct interest to European pig producers. The aim of the four-year government and industry-sponsored research programme is to determine the genetic and physiological mechanisms that allow the pigs to achieve their higher than average litter sizes. If successful, it is hoped that this information can be used to improve European breeds. At the same time, the scientists feel that the project may shed some light on certain human reproductive problems. So far, 32 Meishan pigs of the Taihu type have been imported into the UK for the project, which forms part of a bilateral research programme between the UK and the People's Republic of China.

Piglets raised on organic farms had 20 % lower growth rate during lactation than piglets raised on conventional farms, but the difference was not statistically significant (P= 0. 15). Growth rate of piglets sampled from 14 farms for monitoring in the first rearing period (until average weight of 36 kg), fed either conventional or organic feed mixture, was not significantly different (391 vs. 361 g/day, respectively; P = 0. 60) ...|$|R

40|$|Summary: We {{analyzed}} {{data collected}} in the National Swine Survey to find the management variables that may affect preweaning piglet mortality.

These reproductive traits of sows were studied: number of all, live born and weaned piglets, loses from live born piglets till weaning. These influences with an impact on reproductive characters were monitored: order of litter, number of piglets in a litter, birth weight of piglets, influences of sex and litter order on birth weight of piglets. An average number of all born <b>piglets</b> <b>per</b> sow and <b>litter</b> it was 13. 25 piglets. From this an average number of live born piglets it was 12. 48 <b>piglets</b> <b>per</b> sow and <b>litter</b> and from each litter there was 11. 40 of weaned piglets. The highest number of live born piglets was reached in sows on the fourth litter – 14. 50 piglets. On eighth and nineth litter fertility decreased to 11. 60 and 11. 00 piglets. Statistical conclusive difference (P ≤ 0. 05) was found between fourth (14. 50) and nineth (11. 00) litter. Among birth weight in both sexes a statistical conclusive difference (P ≤ 0. 05) was found. Higher birth weight (1. 46 kg) was found in boars in comparison with gilts (1. 40 kg).

40|$|Somatic cell nuclear {{transfer}} {{was used to}} produce live piglets from cultured fetal fibroblast cells. This was achieved by exposing donor cell nuclei to oocyte cytoplasm for approximately 3 h before activation by chemical means. Initially, an experiment was performed to optimize a cell fusion system that prevented concurrent activation {{in the majority of}} recipient cytoplasts. Cultured fibroblast cells were fused in medium with or without calcium into enucleated oocytes flushed from superovulated gilts. Cybrids fused in the presence of calcium cleaved at a significantly (P, 0. 05) greater rate (69 %, 37 out of 54) after 2 days of culture compared with those fused without calcium (10 %, 7 out of 73), suggesting that calcium-free conditions are needed to avoid activation in the majority of recipient cytoplasts during fusion. In the second experiment, cybrids fused in calcium- free medium were activated approximately 3 h later with ionomycin, followed by incubation in 6 -dimethylaminopurine to determine development in vitro. Following 2 days of culture, cleavage rates of chemically activated and unactivated cybrids (fusion without activation control) were 93 % (100 out of 108) and 7 % (2 out of 27), respectively. After an additional 5 days of culture, activated cloned embryos formed blastocysts at a rate of 23 % (25 out of 108) with an average inner cell mass and trophectoderm cell number of 10 (range, 3 to 38) and 31 (range, 16 to 58), respectively. In the third experiment, activated {{nuclear transfer}} embryos were transferred to the uteri of synchronized recipients after 3 days of culture to assess their development in vivo. Of 10 recipients receiving an average of 80 cleaved embryos (range, 40 to 107), 5 became pregnant (50 %) as determined by ultrasound between Day 25 and Day 35 of gestation. Of the five pregnant recipients, two subsequently farrowed one <b>piglet</b> <b>per</b> <b>litter</b> originating from two different cell culture lines. In this study, efficient reprogramming of porcine donor nuclei by fusing cells in the absence of calcium followed by chemical activation of recipient cytoplasts was reflected in high rates of development to blastocyst and pregnancy initiation leading to full term development.
