40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} a practical evaluation method for <b>package</b> <b>and</b> PCB effects on RFICs in W-CDMA applications. The <b>package</b> <b>and</b> PCB interconnects are characterized rigorously by establishing their equivalent circuits {{with the help}} of the 3 -D EM-simulation tool. For demonstration, two 1. 9 GHz RFICs were fabricated by a GaAs HBT foundry process, and then housed in the leadless <b>packages,</b> <b>and</b> finally surface-mounted onto PCBs for testing. With the established equivalent circuits, the <b>package</b> <b>and</b> PCB effects can be included in the RFIC simulation in the design stage. The simulated results agree quite well with the final measured results. Key Words —Interconnect effects, package effects, RFICs. I...|$|R

5|$|After the First World War, {{many new}} food {{products}} became available to the typical household, with branded foods advertised for their convenience. Kitchen servants with time to make custards and puddings were replaced with instant foods in jars, or powders that the housewife could quickly mix. American-style dry cereals began to challenge the porridge and bacon and eggs of the middle classes, and the bread and margarine of the poor. While wartime shipping shortages had sharply narrowed choice, the 1920s saw many new kinds of fruit imported from around the world, along with better quality, <b>packaging,</b> <b>and</b> hygiene, aided by refrigerators and refrigerated ships.|$|E
5|$|Amino acids {{are under}} {{development}} as {{components of a}} range of biodegradable polymers. These materials have applications as environmentally friendly <b>packaging</b> <b>and</b> in medicine in drug delivery and the construction of prosthetic implants. These polymers include polypeptides, polyamides, polyesters, polysulfides, and polyurethanes with amino acids either forming part of their main chains or bonded as side chains. These modifications alter the physical properties and reactivities of the polymers. An interesting example of such materials is polyaspartate, a water-soluble biodegradable polymer that may have applications in disposable diapers and agriculture. Due to its solubility and ability to chelate metal ions, polyaspartate is also being used as a biodegradeable anti-scaling agent and a corrosion inhibitor. In addition, the aromatic amino acid tyrosine is being developed as a possible replacement for toxic phenols such as bisphenol A in the manufacture of polycarbonates.|$|E

40|$|A Taylor series {{analysis}} is conducted {{to study the}} effects of the <b>package</b> <b>and</b> printed circuit board (PCB) on the intermodulation nulling of an RF common-emitter amplifier. The equivalent parasitic element of the <b>package</b> <b>and</b> PCB interconnects is extracted from the impedance and admittance parameters, which are obtained using a three-dimensional (3 -D) electromagnetic simulation tool. The theoretical analysis reveals that the effects of the <b>package</b> <b>and</b> PCB on the intermodulation nulling of common-emitter amplifiers is to shift the intermodulation notch; that the third-order intermodulation (IM 3) products under an original bias condition cannot be suppressed and that the linearity of common-emitter amplifiers is thereby degraded.
