5|$|A base such as spermine {{has a few}} {{different}} {{sites where}} <b>protonation</b> can occur. In this example the first proton can go on the terminal –NH2 group, or either of the internal –NH– groups. The pKa values for dissociation of spermine protonated at one or other of the sites are examples of micro-constants. They cannot be determined directly by means of pH, absorbance, fluorescence or NMR measurements. Nevertheless, the site of <b>protonation</b> {{is very important for}} biological function, so mathematical methods have been developed for the determination of micro-constants.C NMR Data Processed by the New Computer Program HypNMR2000. <b>Protonation</b> Sequence in Polyamines.|$|E
5|$|<b>Protonation</b> of the enolate is {{sometimes}} not stereoselective, meaning that products can be formed as mixtures of epimers.|$|E
5|$|Proton sponge, 1,8-bis(dimethylamino)naphthalene, has a pKa {{value of}} 12.1. It {{is one of}} the strongest amine bases known. The high {{basicity}} is attributed to the relief of strain upon <b>protonation</b> and strong internal hydrogen bonding.|$|E
5|$|The {{equilibrium}} constant Kb for a base is usually {{defined as the}} association constant for <b>protonation</b> of the base, B, to form the conjugate acid, HB+.|$|E
5|$|Diaminocarbenes do {{not truly}} dimerise, but rather form the dimer by {{reaction}} via formamidinium salts, a protonated precursor species. Accordingly, this reaction can be acid catalysed. This reaction occurs because unlike imidazolium based carbenes, {{there is no}} loss of aromaticity in <b>protonation</b> of the carbene.|$|E
5|$|The {{classical}} {{version of}} the Nazarov cyclization suffers from several drawbacks which modern variants attempt to circumvent. The first two are not evident from the mechanism alone, but are indicative of the barriers to cyclization; the last three stem from selectivity issues relating to elimination and <b>protonation</b> of the intermediate.|$|E
5|$|In decavanadate, each V(V) {{center is}} {{surrounded}} by six oxide ligands. Vanadic acid, H3VO4 exists only at very low concentrations because <b>protonation</b> of the tetrahedral species − results in the preferential formation of the octahedral + species. In strongly acidic solutions, pH<2. + is the predominant species, while the oxide V2O5 precipitates from solution at high concentrations. The oxide is formally the inorganic anhydride of vanadic acid. The structures of many vanadate compounds have been determined by X-ray crystallography.|$|E
25|$|With {{electron}} withdrawing groups {{there are}} {{examples in the}} literature demonstrating {{the nature of the}} carbanion just before final <b>protonation,</b> revealing that the initial radical-anion <b>protonation</b> occurs para to the withdrawing substituent.|$|E
25|$|The {{uncertainty}} in the chemical literature is now only of historical significance. Indeed, some further computational results have been reported, which vary from suggesting a preference for meta radical-anion <b>protonation</b> to suggesting a mixture of ortho and meta <b>protonation.</b>|$|E
25|$|Where {{the radical}} anion is {{initially}} protonated determines {{the structure of}} the product. With an electron donor such as methoxy (MeO) or with an alkyl group, <b>protonation</b> has been thought by some investigators as being ortho (i.e. adjacent or 1,2) to the substituent. Other investigators have thought the <b>protonation</b> is meta (1,3) to the substituent. Arthur Birch favored meta <b>protonation.</b> With electron withdrawing substituents, <b>protonation</b> has been thought to occur {{at the site of the}} substituent (ipso), or para (1,4). Again, there has been varied opinion. A. J. Birch's empirical rules say that for the donor substituents the final product has the maximum number of substituents on the final double bonds. For electron withdrawing groups the double bonds of the product avoid the substituents. The placement preference of groups in the mechanism and in the final product is termed regioselectivity.|$|E
25|$|Then in 1990 and 1993 {{a method}} was finally devised to {{experimentally}} assess whether the anisole and toluene radical anion protonated ortho or meta. The esoteric method {{began with the}} premise that the isotope selectivity in <b>protonation</b> in a protium–deuterium medium would be greater for the radical anion, of the first <b>protonation</b> step, than for the carbanion of the penultimate step. The reasoning was that carbanions are much more basic than the corresponding radical anions and thus will react more exothermically and less selectively in <b>protonation.</b> Experimentally it was determined that less deuterium at the ortho site than meta resulted (1:7) for a variety of methoxylated aromatics. This is a consequence of the greater selectivity of the radical anion <b>protonation.</b> Computations (e.g. ROHF/6-31g) of the electron densities concurred with the experimental observations. Also, it was ascertained that frontier orbital densities did not, and these had been used in some previous reports.|$|E
25|$|N-3 <b>protonation</b> of adenine by Arg180 allows {{deprotonation}} of {{a nearby}} water molecule.|$|E
25|$|Double <b>protonation</b> {{gives the}} azaniumylazanium (hydrazinediium) dication (H3NNH32+), of which various salts are known.|$|E
25|$|The {{remaining}} {{item for}} discussion {{is the final}} <b>protonation</b> of the cyclohexadienyl anion. In 1961 {{it was found that}} simple Hückel computations were unable to distinguish between the different <b>protonation</b> sites. However, when the computations were modified with somewhat more realistic assumptions, the Hückel computations revealed the center carbon to the preferred. The more modern 1990 and 1993 computations were in agreement.|$|E
25|$|The {{treatment}} of the β-hydroxysilane 1 with acid results in <b>protonation</b> and an anti elimination to form the desired alkene.|$|E
25|$|However, textbooks, {{publishing}} on {{the mechanism}} of the Birch Reduction, have noted that ortho <b>protonation</b> of the initial radical anion is preferred.|$|E
25|$|Strong light {{causes the}} {{reduction}} of the plastoquinone pool, which leads to <b>protonation</b> and double reduction (and double <b>protonation)</b> of the QA electron acceptor of Photosystem II. The protonated and double-reduced forms of QA do not function in electron transport. Furthermore, charge recombination reactions in inhibited Photosystem II are expected to lead to the triplet state of the primary donor (P680) more probably than same reactions in active PSII. Triplet P680 may react with oxygen to produce harmful singlet oxygen.|$|E
25|$|Unlike most amines, indole is not basic: {{just like}} pyrrole, the {{aromatic}} {{character of the}} ring means that the {{lone pair of electrons}} on the nitrogen atom is not available for <b>protonation.</b> Strong acids such as hydrochloric acid can, however, protonate indole. Indole is primarily protonated at the C3, rather than N1, owing to the enamine-like reactivity of the portion of the molecule located outside of the benzene ring. The protonated form has an pKa of −3.6. The sensitivity of many indolic compounds (e.g., tryptamines) under acidic conditions is caused by this <b>protonation.</b>|$|E
25|$|Subsequently, in 1992 and 1996 Birch {{published}} twice still {{suggesting that}} meta <b>protonation</b> was preferred. This was {{a reversal of}} his earlier views as published with Leo Radom.|$|E
25|$|In {{the reduced}} form of plastocyanin, His-87 will become protonated with a pKa of 4.4. <b>Protonation</b> {{prevents}} it {{acting as a}} ligand and the copper site geometry becomes trigonal planar.|$|E
25|$|The <b>protonation</b> steps {{between the}} arsenate and arsenic acid {{are similar to}} those between {{phosphate}} and phosphoric acid. Unlike phosphorous acid, arsenous acid is genuinely tribasic, with the formula As(OH)3.|$|E
25|$|Burnham in 1969 {{concluded}} that <b>protonation</b> {{is unlikely to}} occur predominantly at the ortho position and the reaction most probably occurs at the meta position but may occur at both sites at similar rates.|$|E
25|$|This dianion results {{independent}} of whether alcohol {{is used in}} the reduction or not. Thus the initial <b>protonation</b> by tert-butyl alcohol or ammonia is para rather than ipso as seen in the step from B to C.|$|E
25|$|The {{first step}} in this {{reaction}} is <b>protonation</b> of the quinoline nitrogen atom by the phosphoric acid forming a transient chiral iminium ion. It is noted that with most traditional metal based catalysts, hydrogenation of aromatic or heteroaromatic substrates tend to fail.|$|E
25|$|The {{reaction}} mechanism provides {{the details of}} molecular change as a reaction proceeds. In the case of donating groups, A. J. Birch's preference for meta <b>protonation</b> of the radical anion was based on qualitative reasoning, but {{this has not been}} experimentally demonstrated.|$|E
25|$|There {{are known}} {{precedents}} for central anion <b>protonation.</b> Thus conjugated enolates as C=C-C=C-O- {{have been known}} for some time as kinetically protonating {{in the center of the}} enolate system to afford the β,γ-unsaturated carbonyl compound under conditions where the anion, and not the enol, is the species protonated.|$|E
25|$|This {{causes the}} <b>protonation</b> of water, or the {{creation}} of the hydronium (H3O+) ion. Thus, in modern times, the symbol H+ is interpreted as a shorthand for H3O+, because it is now known that a bare proton does not exist as a free species in aqueous solution.|$|E
25|$|Guanidinium and amidinium ions are {{structural}} {{relatives of}} ureas and thioureas and can catalyze similar reactions but, {{by virtue of}} their positive charge, are stronger donors and much more acidic. The mechanism of guanidinium and amidinium catalysis is thought to often involve partial <b>protonation</b> of substrate.|$|E
25|$|In 1990 and 1993 an esoteric {{test was}} devised {{which showed that}} ortho <b>protonation</b> of the radical anion was {{preferred}} over meta (seven to one). This was accompanied by more modern computation which concurred. Both experiment and computations were {{in agreement with the}} early 1961 computations.|$|E
25|$|In 1961 {{a simple}} {{computation}} {{of the electron}} densities of the radical anion revealed {{that it was the}} ortho site which was most negative and thus most likely to protonate. Additionally, the second <b>protonation</b> was determined computationally to occur {{in the center of the}} cyclohexadienyl anion to give an unconjugated product.|$|E
25|$|Cyclopropenylidene is {{generally}} destroyed by reactions between ions and neutral molecules. Of these, <b>protonation</b> reactions {{are the most}} common. Any species of the type HX+ can react to convert the c-C3H2 back to c-C3H3+. Due to rate constant and concentration considerations, the most important reactants {{for the destruction of}} c-C3H2 are HCO+, H3+, and H3O+.|$|E
25|$|Nitro {{compounds}} may {{be reduced}} to either the hydroxylamine or amine oxidation level with samarium iodide, depending on the conditions employed. Electron transfer, followed by proton transfer and elimination generates an intermediate nitroso compound, which undergoes two more rounds of electron transfer and <b>protonation</b> to afford the hydroxylamine. Further reduction of the hydroxylamine leads to the amine.|$|E
25|$|In 1980 {{publications}} Birch {{collaborated with}} Leo Radom {{in a study}} that concluded that electron densities at the ortho and meta positions to be close with a slight ortho preference, but with mixtures of ortho and meta <b>protonation</b> occurring. RHF/sto-3g and UHF/sto-3g computations were used to conclude that both ortho and meta substitutions would occur with a slight preference for ortho.|$|E
25|$|The {{resulting}} ubiquinol localized to {{the membrane}} domain interacts with negatively charged residues in the membrane arm, stabilizing conformational changes. An antiporter mechanism (Na+/H+ swap) {{has been proposed}} using evidence of conserved Asp residues in the membrane arm. The presence of Lys, Glu, and His residues enable for proton gating (a <b>protonation</b> followed by deprotonation event across the membrane) driven by the pKa of the residues.|$|E
25|$|Pyridine is {{miscible}} {{with water}} and virtually all organic solvents. It is weakly basic, and with hydrochloric acid it forms a crystalline hydrochloride salt that melts at 145–147°C. Most chemical properties of pyridine are typical of a heteroaromatic compound. In organic reactions, pyridine behaves both as a tertiary amine, undergoing <b>protonation,</b> alkylation, acylation, and N-oxidation at the nitrogen atom, and as an aromatic compound, undergoing nucleophilic substitutions.|$|E
25|$|A decarboxylase with {{cofactor}} {{pyridoxal phosphate}} (PLP) removes CO2 from 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan to produce 5-hydroxytryptamine. PLP forms an imine with the amino acid derivative. The amine on the pyridine is protonated and {{acts as an}} electron sink, enabling {{the breaking of the}} C-C bond and releasing CO2. <b>Protonation</b> of the amine from tryptophan restores the aromaticity of the pyridine ring and then imine is hydrolyzed to produce 5-hydroxytryptamine and PLP.|$|E
