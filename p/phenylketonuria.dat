25|$|<b>Phenylketonuria.</b> Because <b>phenylketonuria</b> was {{the first}} genetic {{disorder}} for which mass post-natal genetic screening was available, {{beginning in the early}} 1960s, atypical cases were detected almost immediately. Molecular analysis of the genome was not yet possible, but protein sequencing revealed cases caused by compound heterozygosity. As molecular genomic techniques became available in the 1980s and 1990s, it became possible to explain a range of disorders in heterozygotes carrying one copy of one of the classic mutations for <b>phenylketonuria.</b>|$|E
25|$|Several {{metabolic}} defects, such as <b>phenylketonuria,</b> {{are associated}} with autistic symptoms.|$|E
25|$|Metabolic food {{reactions}} {{are due to}} inborn or acquired errors of metabolism of nutrients, such as in diabetes mellitus, lactase deficiency, <b>phenylketonuria</b> and favism.|$|E
25|$|L-Phenylalanine also {{inhibits}} neurotransmitter release at glutamatergic synapses in hippocampus and cortex with IC50 of 980 µM, a brain concentration seen {{in classical}} <b>phenylketonuria,</b> whereas D-phenylalanine has a significantly smaller effect.|$|E
25|$|Toxic {{levels of}} {{phenylalanine}} accumulate in {{the brains of}} patients with <b>Phenylketonuria</b> leading to severe brain damage and mental retardation. To prevent brain damage, these individuals can restrict dietary phenylalanine intake by avoiding protein and supplementing their diet with essential amino acids.|$|E
25|$|<b>Phenylketonuria</b> affects {{about one}} in 12,000 babies. Males and females are {{affected}} equally. The disease was discovered in 1934 by Ivar Asbjørn Følling with the importance of diet determined in 1953. Gene therapy, while promising, requires {{a great deal more}} study as of 2014.|$|E
25|$|Potential {{health risks}} have been {{examined}} and dismissed by numerous scientific research projects. With {{the exception of the}} risk to those with <b>phenylketonuria,</b> aspartame {{is considered to be a}} safe food additive by governments worldwide and major health and food safety organizations.|$|E
25|$|<b>Phenylketonuria</b> {{can exist}} in mice, {{which have been}} {{extensively}} used in experiments into finding an effective treatment for it. The macaque monkey's genome was recently sequenced, and the gene encoding phenylalanine hydroxylase {{was found to have}} a sequence that, in humans, would be considered a PKU mutation.|$|E
25|$|Surprisingly, some normal gene {{sequences}} {{in healthy}} macaques and chimpanzees cause profound disease in humans. For example, the normal sequence of phenylalanine hydroxylase in macaques and chimpanzees is the mutated sequence responsible for <b>phenylketonuria</b> in humans. So, humans {{must have been}} under evolutionary pressure to adopt a different mechanism.|$|E
25|$|For example, {{most states}} in the USA require newborns to be {{screened}} for <b>phenylketonuria</b> and hypothyroidism, among other congenital disorders. Although they display {{a high rate of}} false positives, the screening tests are considered valuable because they greatly increase the likelihood of detecting these disorders at a far earlier stage.|$|E
25|$|Classic PKU {{dramatically}} affects myelination {{and white}} matter tracts in untreated infants; {{this may be}} one major cause of neurological disorders associated with <b>phenylketonuria.</b> Differences in white matter development are observable with magnetic resonance imaging. Abnormalities in gray matter can also be detected, particularly in the motor and pre-motor cortex, thalamus and the hippocampus.|$|E
25|$|<b>Phenylketonuria</b> was {{discovered}} by the Norwegian physician Ivar Asbjørn Følling in 1934 when he noticed hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA) was associated with intellectual disability. In Norway, this disorder is known as Følling's disease, named after its discoverer. Følling {{was one of the}} first physicians to apply detailed chemical analysis to the study of disease.|$|E
25|$|Metabolic {{disorders}} {{in either the}} mother or the child can cause neurodevelopmental disorders. Two examples are diabetes mellitus (a multifactorial disorder) and <b>phenylketonuria</b> (an inborn error of metabolism). Many such inherited diseases may directly affect the child's metabolism and neural development but less commonly they can indirectly affect the child during gestation. (See also teratology).|$|E
25|$|<b>Phenylketonuria,</b> {{also known}} as PKU, can induce neurodevelopmental {{problems}} and children with PKU require a strict diet to prevent mental retardation and other disorders. In the maternal form of PKU, excessive maternal phenylalanine can be absorbed by the fetus even if the fetus has not inherited the disease. This can produce mental retardation and other disorders.|$|E
25|$|<b>Phenylketonuria</b> (PKU) is an {{inborn error}} of {{metabolism}} {{that results in}} decreased metabolism of the amino acid phenylalanine. Untreated PKU can lead to intellectual disability, seizures, behavioral problems, and mental disorders. It may also result in a musty smell and lighter skin. Babies born to mothers who have poorly treated PKU may have heart problems, a small head, and low birth weight.|$|E
25|$|A {{panel of}} experts {{set up by the}} European Food Safety Authority {{concluded}} in 2013 that aspartame is safe for human consumption at current levels of exposure. As of 2017 evidence does not support a long-term benefit for weight loss or in diabetes. Because its breakdown products include phenylalanine, people with the genetic condition <b>phenylketonuria</b> (PKU) must be aware of this as an additional source.|$|E
25|$|For {{people who}} do not have <b>phenylketonuria,</b> the U.S. Institute of Medicine set {{recommended}} at least 33mg/kg body weight/day phenylalanine plus tyrosine for adults 19 years and older. For people with PKU, a recommendation for children up to age 10 years is 200 to 500mg/d; for older children and adults 220 to 1200mg/day. Where in the range depends on body weight and age, and on monitoring blood concentration.|$|E
25|$|The {{screening}} process, however, {{is characterized}} by a high false positive rate. In one study, CAH screening had the lowest positive predictive value (111 true-positive cases among 20,647 abnormal screening results in a 2-year period, or 0.53%, compared with 6.36% for biotinidase deficiency, 1.84% for congenital hypo-thyroidism, 0.56% for classic galactosemia, and 2.9% for <b>phenylketonuria).</b> According to this estimate, 200 unaffected newborns required clinical and laboratory follow-up for every true case of CAH.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of {{population}} growth in African-Caribbean regions of overseas France and immigration from North and sub-Saharan Africa to mainland France, sickle-cell disease {{has become a major}} health problem in France. SCD has become the most common genetic disease in the country, with an overall birth prevalence of 1/2,415 in Metropolitan France, ahead of <b>phenylketonuria</b> (1/10,862), congenital hypothyroidism (1/3,132), congenital adrenal hyperplasia (1/19,008) and cystic fibrosis (1/5,014) for the same reference period.|$|E
25|$|For {{women with}} <b>phenylketonuria,</b> it is {{important}} for the health of their children to maintain low Phe levels before and during pregnancy. Though the developing fetus may only be a carrier of the PKU gene, the intrauterine environment can have very high levels of phenylalanine, which can cross the placenta. The child may develop congenital heart disease, growth retardation, microcephaly and intellectual disability as a result. PKU-affected women themselves are not at risk of additional complications during pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|In 1934 at Rikshospitalet, Følling saw a {{young woman}} named Borgny Egeland. She had two children, Liv and Dag, who had been normal at birth but {{subsequently}} developed intellectual disability. When Dag was about a year old, the mother noticed a strong smell to his urine. Følling obtained urine samples from the children and, after many tests, {{he found that the}} substance causing the odor in the urine was phenylpyruvic acid. The children, he concluded, had excess phenylpyruvic acid in the urine, the condition which came to be called <b>phenylketonuria</b> (PKU).|$|E
25|$|<b>Phenylketonuria</b> is {{a genetic}} {{disorder}} inherited from a person's parents. It {{is due to}} mutations in the PAH gene which results in low levels of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. This results in the buildup of dietary phenylalanine to potentially toxic levels. It is autosomal recessive meaning that both copies of the gene must be mutated for the condition to develop. There are two main types, classic PKU and variant PKU, depending on if any enzyme function remains. Those with one copy of a mutated gene typically do not have symptoms. Many countries have newborn screening programs for the disease.|$|E
25|$|From 1920 to 1933, the Bucks {{made their}} home in Nanjing, {{on the campus of}} the University of Nanking, where they both had {{teaching}} positions. She taught English literature at the private, church-run University of Nanking, Ginling College and at the National Central University. In 1920, the Bucks had a daughter, Carol, afflicted with <b>phenylketonuria.</b> In 1921, Buck's mother died of a tropical disease, sprue, and shortly afterward her father moved in. In 1924, they left China for John Buck's year of sabbatical and returned to the United States for a short time, during which Pearl Buck earned her master's degree from Cornell University. In 1925, the Bucks adopted Janice (later surnamed Walsh). That autumn, they returned to China.|$|E
25|$|Phenylalanine {{is one of}} the {{essential}} amino acids and is required for normal growth and maintenance of life. Concerns about the safety of phenylalanine from aspartame for those without <b>phenylketonuria</b> center largely on hypothetical changes in neurotransmitter levels as well as ratios of neurotransmitters {{to each other in the}} blood and brain that could lead to neurological symptoms. Reviews of the literature have found no consistent findings to support such concerns, and while high doses of aspartame consumption may have some biochemical effects, these effects are not seen in toxicity studies to suggest aspartame can adversely affect neuronal function. Like methanol, common foods in the typical diet, such as milk, meat, and fruits, will lead to ingestion of significantly higher amounts of phenylalanine than would be expected from aspartame consumption.|$|E
25|$|Newborn {{screening}}: Newborn screening is used {{just after}} birth to identify genetic disorders {{that can be}} treated early in life. A blood sample is collected with a heel prick from the newborn 24–48 hours after birth {{and sent to the}} lab for analysis. In the United States, newborn screening procedure varies state by state, but all states by law test for at least 21 disorders. If abnormal results are obtained, it does not necessarily mean the child has the disorder. Diagnostic tests must follow the initial screening to confirm the disease. The routine testing of infants for certain disorders is the most widespread use of genetic testing—millions of babies are tested each year in the United States. All states currently test infants for <b>phenylketonuria</b> (a genetic disorder that causes mental illness if left untreated) and congenital hypothyroidism (a disorder of the thyroid gland). People with PKU do not have an enzyme needed to process the amino acid phenylalanine, which is responsible for normal growth in kids and normal protein use throughout their lifetime. If there is a buildup of too much phenylalanine, brain tissue can be damaged, causing developmental delay. Newborn screening can detect the presence of PKU, allowing kids to get put on a special diet right away to avoid the effects of the disorder.|$|E
500|$|One {{example of}} enzyme {{deficiency}} {{is the most}} common type of <b>phenylketonuria.</b> Many different single amino acid mutations in the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase, which catalyzes the first step in the degradation of phenylalanine, result in build-up of phenylalanine and related products. Some mutations are in the active site, directly disrupting binding and catalysis, but many are far from the active site and reduce activity by destabilising the protein structure, or affecting correct oligomerisation. This can lead to intellectual disability if the disease is untreated. Another example is pseudocholinesterase deficiency, in which the body's ability to break down choline ester drugs is impaired.|$|E

2500|$|Metabolic (or biochemical) {{genetics}} {{involves the}} diagnosis and management of inborn errors of metabolism in which patients have enzymatic deficiencies that perturb biochemical pathways involved in metabolism of carbohydrates, amino acids, and lipids. [...] Examples of metabolic disorders include galactosemia, glycogen storage disease, lysosomal storage disorders, metabolic acidosis, peroxisomal disorders, <b>phenylketonuria,</b> and urea cycle disorders.|$|E
2500|$|In the brain, L-phenylalanine is a {{competitive}} antagonist at the glycine binding site of NMDA receptor [...] {{and at the}} glutamate binding site of AMPA receptor. [...] At the glycine binding site of NMDA receptor L-phenylalanine has an apparent equilibrium dissociation constant (KB) of 573 µM estimated by Schild regression which is considerably lower than brain L-phenylalanine concentration observed in untreated human <b>phenylketonuria.</b>|$|E
2500|$|High {{levels of}} the {{naturally}} occurring essential amino acid phenylalanine are a health hazard to those born with <b>phenylketonuria</b> (PKU), a rare inherited disease that prevents phenylalanine from being properly metabolized. Since individuals with PKU must consider aspartame as an additional source of phenylalanine, foods containing aspartame sold in the United States must state [...] "Phenylketonurics: Contains Phenylalanine" [...] on their product labels.|$|E
2500|$|The genetic {{disorder}} <b>phenylketonuria</b> (PKU) is {{the inability to}} metabolize phenylalanine {{because of a lack}} of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. Individuals with this disorder are known as [...] "phenylketonurics" [...] and must regulate their intake of phenylalanine. Phenylketonurics often use blood tests to monitor the amount of phenylalanine in their blood. [...] Lab results may report phenylalanine levels using either mg/dL and μmol/L. One mg/dL of phenylalanine is approximately equivalent to 60 μmol/L.|$|E
2500|$|Newborn {{screening}} {{originated with}} an amino acid disorder, <b>phenylketonuria</b> (PKU), {{which can be}} easily treated by dietary modifications, but causes severe mental retardation if not identified and treated early. [...] Robert Guthrie introduced the newborn screening test for PKU in the early 1960s. [...] With the knowledge that PKU could be detected before symptoms were evident, and treatment initiated, screening was quickly adopted around the world. [...] Austria started screening for PKU in 1966 and England in 1968.|$|E

[...] In the US, the newborn screen incorporates biochemical tests to screen for treatable conditions such as galactosemia and <b>phenylketonuria</b> (PKU). [...] Patients suspected to have a metabolic condition might undergo the following tests: ...|$|E
