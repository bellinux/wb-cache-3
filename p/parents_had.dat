30|$|More {{importantly}} from {{a political}} perspective, tuition fees did not affect students with lower education backgrounds. We found overall no effects for students whose <b>parents</b> <b>have</b> no tertiary education. While the effects for women whose <b>parents</b> <b>have</b> and have no tertiary education are very similar, tuition fees decreased expenditure for male students whose <b>parents</b> <b>have</b> tertiary education but not for men whose <b>parents</b> <b>have</b> no tertiary education. Concerning the parents’ position in the job, we found more negative effects of tuition fees on expenditure for students whose <b>parents</b> <b>have</b> low position in the job, which {{is driven by the}} effect on women.|$|R

5|$|After Busch {{had spent}} six months with his uncle Kleine at Lüthorst, he {{expressed}} an aim to continue study in Munich. This request caused a rift with his father who, however, eventually funded this move; - see for comparison Busch's illustrated story of Painter Klecksel. Busch's expectations of the Munich Academy of Fine Arts were not met. His life became aimless; there were occasional return visits to Lüthorst, but contact with his <b>parents</b> <b>had</b> been broken off. In 1857 and 1858, as his position seemed to be without prospects, he contemplated emigration to Brazil to keep bees.|$|E
5|$|Allen {{was born}} on 31 July 1902 in Bellevue Hill, Sydney, Australia, the second of three {{children}} to Walter Allen, a lawyer, and his wife Marguerite (Pearl), née Lamb, {{the daughter of a}} Queensland Minister of Lands.

Both of Allen's <b>parents</b> <b>had</b> roots in England as well as Australia. In 1909, when Allen was six years old, his family moved to London—hoping that the children would benefit from an English education—where they initially lived in a flat before moving to various country villages. Finding that they enjoyed England, the family abandoned plans to return to Australia.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Several {{articles}} and {{studies have been}} done on extreme <b>parenting.</b> Many authors <b>have</b> found that, to some degree, extreme <b>parenting</b> <b>has</b> a negative effect on children. More and more children are coming from homes that <b>have</b> included extreme <b>parenting</b> styles. These children have grown up to be struggling adults when it comes to academics, peer-to-peer relationships, and employee to employer relationship. Extreme <b>parenting</b> <b>has</b> the potential to destroy the independence, problem-solving, and relationships of the next generation. One area that has been researched most is extreme parents and youth sports. Studies have shown that youth sports have taken on an entirely new meaning than those of the past. This paper will examine the different styles of extreme parenting, how extreme <b>parenting</b> <b>has</b> changed the coach/player/parent relationship, how extreme <b>parenting</b> <b>has</b> changed not only youth sports but other areas such as employment, college professor/student relationsh...|$|R

5|$|Amir's {{mother died}} in 1931, and his father the year after, meaning that his {{education}} {{could no longer be}} funded. After his AMS studies concluded, he wanted to continue to study at a law school in Batavia. As such, he wrote to his brother, Jakfar, who arranged for the remainder of his studies to be paid for by the Sultan. In 1932 Amir was able to return to Batavia and begin his legal studies, taking up a part-time job as a teacher. At first, his relationship with Sundari was continued through letters, though she soon continued her studies in Lembang, a city much closer than Surakarta; this allowed the two to meet furtively– when Sundari's <b>parents</b> <b>had</b> discovered their relationship, Amir and Sundari had been forbidden from meeting.|$|E
5|$|At 24, she won {{the role}} of the title {{character}} in UPN's drama Veronica Mars, which was launched in the fall of 2004. Created by Rob Thomas, the series starred Bell as the seventeen-year-old anti-establishment high school student/detective. Bell drew on the parallels between the character of Veronica and her own life, since Bell's <b>parents</b> <b>had</b> divorced and her best friend had also died. The series earned acclaim from television critics, as did Bell's performance. Some critics asserted that her performance was overlooked, and deserved consideration for an Emmy Award.|$|E
5|$|During {{the same}} year, the State of Texas {{announced}} it would provide $500,000 worth of grant funds to Gulfton-area agencies for crime prevention programs. The state targeted Gulfton because the zip code had 419 juvenile probation referrals, the highest for any zip code in Harris County. After the grant was established, GANO, the Shenandoah Civic Association, and GARC worked together to reduce juvenile crime. In 1995, Nelson Reyes, a counselor for immigrants from Mexico and El Salvador at the Gulfton Area Neighborhood Organization, said that local <b>parents</b> <b>had</b> positive attitudes about living in Gulfton as they made more money {{than they did in}} their home countries, but Gulfton-area children felt impacted by the area crime.|$|E

5|$|Fryderyk's father, Nicolas Chopin, was a Frenchman from Lorraine who had {{emigrated to}} Poland in 1787 {{at the age}} of sixteen. Nicolas tutored {{children}} of the Polish aristocracy, and in 1806 married Justyna Krzyżanowska, a poor relative of the Skarbeks, one of the families for whom he worked. Fryderyk was baptized on Easter Sunday, 23 April 1810, in the same church where his <b>parents</b> <b>had</b> married, in Brochów. His eighteen-year-old godfather, for whom he was named, was Fryderyk Skarbek, a pupil of Nicolas Chopin. Fryderyk was the couple's second child and only son; he had an elder sister, Ludwika (1807–55), and two younger sisters, Izabela (1811–81) and Emilia (1812–27). Nicolas was devoted to his adopted homeland, and insisted {{on the use of the}} Polish language in the household.|$|E
5|$|In April 1876 he {{returned}} to England to take unpaid work as a supply teacher in a small boarding school in Ramsgate. When the proprietor moved to Isleworth in Middlesex, Van Gogh went with him. The arrangement did not work out and he left to become a Methodist minister's assistant. His <b>parents</b> <b>had</b> meanwhile moved to Etten; in 1876 {{he returned}} home at Christmas {{for six months and}} took work at a bookshop in Dordrecht. He was unhappy in the position and spent his time doodling or translating passages from the Bible into English, French and German. He immersed himself in religion, and became increasingly pious and monastic. According to his flatmate of the time, Paulus van Görlitz, Van Gogh ate frugally, avoiding meat.|$|E

William Taft remained devoted to his wife throughout their almost 44 years of marriage. Nellie Taft pushed her husband much as his <b>parents</b> <b>had,</b> and she could be very frank with her criticisms.
