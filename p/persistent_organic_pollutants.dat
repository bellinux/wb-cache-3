5|$|When {{they live}} in {{polluted}} waters, bivalve molluscs {{have a tendency to}} accumulate substances such as heavy metals and <b>persistent</b> <b>organic</b> <b>pollutants</b> in their tissues. This is because they ingest the chemicals as they feed but their enzyme systems are not capable of metabolising them and as a result, the levels build up. This may be a health hazard for the molluscs themselves, and is one for humans who eat them. It also has certain advantages in that bivalves can be used in monitoring the presence and quantity of pollutants in their environment.|$|E
5|$|Some {{types of}} organochlorides, though not all, have {{significant}} toxicity to plants or animals, including humans. Dioxins, produced when organic matter is {{burned in the}} presence of chlorine, and some insecticides, such as DDT, are <b>persistent</b> <b>organic</b> <b>pollutants</b> which pose dangers when they are released into the environment. For example, DDT, which was widely used to control insects in the mid 20th century, also accumulates in food chains, and causes reproductive problems (e.g., eggshell thinning) in certain bird species. Due to the ready homolytic fission of the C–Cl bond to create chlorine radicals in the upper atmosphere, chlorofluorocarbons have been phased out due to the harm they do to the ozone layer.|$|E
5|$|Synthetic {{chemical}} {{production has}} escalated following the stimulus it received {{during the second}} World War. Chemical production includes everything from herbicides, pesticides and fertilizers to domestic chemicals and hazardous substances. Apart from the build-up of greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere, chemicals of particular concern include: heavy metals, nuclear waste, chlorofluorocarbons, <b>persistent</b> <b>organic</b> <b>pollutants</b> and all harmful chemicals capable of bioaccumulation. Although most synthetic chemicals are harmless {{there needs to be}} rigorous testing of new chemicals, in all countries, for adverse environmental and health effects. International legislation has been established to deal with the global distribution and management of dangerous goods. The effects of some chemical agents needed long-term measurements and a lot of legal battles to realize their danger to human health. The classification of the toxic carcinogenic agents is handle by the International Agency for Research on Cancer.|$|E
5000|$|Chlorobenzilate is a <b>persistent</b> <b>organic</b> <b>pollutant</b> and is {{very toxic}} to aquatic invertebrates.|$|R
2500|$|It is {{classified}} as a UNEP <b>Persistent</b> <b>Organic</b> <b>Pollutant</b> and WHO Toxicity Class, [...] "Ia, Extremely Hazardous".|$|R
50|$|Monocrotophos is an {{organophosphate}} insecticide. It is {{acutely toxic}} to birds and humans. Being also a <b>persistent</b> <b>organic</b> <b>pollutant,</b> {{it has been}} banned in the U.S. and many other countries.|$|R
5|$|All {{organisms are}} {{constantly}} exposed to compounds that they cannot use as foods {{and would be}} harmful if they accumulated in cells, as they have no metabolic function. These potentially damaging compounds are called xenobiotics. Xenobiotics such as synthetic drugs, natural poisons and antibiotics are detoxified {{by a set of}} xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes. In humans, these include cytochrome P450 oxidases, UDP-glucuronosyltransferases, and glutathione S-transferases. This system of enzymes acts in three stages to firstly oxidize the xenobiotic (phase I) and then conjugate water-soluble groups onto the molecule (phase II). The modified water-soluble xenobiotic can then be pumped out of cells and in multicellular organisms may be further metabolized before being excreted (phase III). In ecology, these reactions are particularly important in microbial biodegradation of pollutants and the bioremediation of contaminated land and oil spills. Many of these microbial reactions are shared with multicellular organisms, but due to the incredible diversity of types of microbes these organisms are able to deal with a far wider range of xenobiotics than multicellular organisms, and can degrade even <b>persistent</b> <b>organic</b> <b>pollutants</b> such as organochloride compounds.|$|E

50|$|Processing of PTFE in {{the past}} used to include Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) as an emulsifier; however, PFOA is a <b>persistent</b> <b>organic</b> <b>pollutant</b> and poses both {{environmental}} and health concerns, and is now being phased out of use in PTFE processing.|$|R
5000|$|... (Dichloro-Diphenyl-Trichloroethane) (DDT) was {{a widely}} used {{synthetic}} pesticide before its usage was banned in many countries, following many campaigns {{that it is}} harmful {{to the environment and}} wildlife.

5000|$|... 3M reformulated Scotchgard {{and since}} June 2003 has {{replaced}} PFOS with perfluorobutanesulfonic acid (PFBS). PFBS {{has a much}} shorter half-life in people than PFOS (a little over one month vs. 5.4 years). In May 2009, PFOS {{was determined to be}} a <b>persistent</b> <b>organic</b> <b>pollutant</b> (POP) by the Stockholm Convention.|$|R
25|$|Dioxins {{and other}} <b>persistent</b> <b>organic</b> <b>pollutants</b> (POPs) {{are subject to}} the Stockholm Convention. The treaty obliges signatories to take {{measures}} to eliminate where possible, and minimize where not possible to eliminate, all sources of dioxin.|$|E
25|$|There are 12 {{compounds}} {{in the list}} of <b>persistent</b> <b>organic</b> <b>pollutants.</b> Dioxins and furans are two of them and intentionally created by combustion of organics, like open burning of plastics. These compounds are also endocrine disruptors and can mutate the human genes.|$|E
25|$|Historically, wood-treating {{facilities}} have also release insecticides such as pentachlorophenol (PCP) and creosote into the environment, impacting the groundwater resources. PCP {{is a highly}} soluble and toxic obsolete pesticide recently listed in the Stockholm Convention on <b>Persistent</b> <b>Organic</b> <b>Pollutants.</b> PAHs and other semi-VOCs are the common contaminants associated with creosote.|$|E
2500|$|EDTA {{is in such}} {{widespread}} use that {{questions have been raised}} whether it is a <b>persistent</b> <b>organic</b> <b>pollutant.</b> While EDTA serves many positive functions in different industrial, pharmaceutical and other avenues, the longevity of EDTA can pose serious issues in the environment.

50|$|Chlorothalonil can be {{produced}} by the direct chlorination of isophthalonitrile or by dehydration of tetrachloroisophthaloyl amide with phosphoryl chloride. It is a white solid. It breaks down under basic conditions, but is stable in neutral and acidic media. Technical grade chlorothalonil contains traces of dioxins and hexachlorobenzene, a <b>persistent</b> <b>organic</b> <b>pollutant</b> banned under the Stockholm Convention.|$|R
5000|$|Isobenzan (telodrin) is {{a highly}} toxic {{organochloride}} insecticide. It was produced only in the period from 1958 to 1965 and its use has been since discontinued. [...] It is a <b>persistent</b> <b>organic</b> <b>pollutant</b> that can remain in soil for 2 to 7 years, and the biological half-life of isobenzan in human blood {{is estimated to be}} about 2.8 years.|$|R
25|$|A Bayesian {{emulator}} for <b>persistent</b> <b>organic</b> <b>pollutants</b> {{has been}} developed which can potentially be used to quantify the boundaries for chemical pollution. To date, critical exposure levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) above which mass mortality events of marine mammals are likely to occur, have been proposed as a chemical pollution planetary boundary.|$|E
25|$|<b>Persistent</b> <b>organic</b> <b>pollutants</b> (POPs) are organic {{compounds}} that {{are resistant to}} environmental degradation through chemical, biological, and photolytic processes. Because of this, they have been observed to persist in the environment, {{to be capable of}} long-range transport, bioaccumulate in human and animal tissue, biomagnify in food chains, and to have potentially significant impacts on human health and the environment.|$|E
25|$|In the 1960s, it was {{discovered}} that DDT was preventing many fish-eating birds from reproducing, which was a serious threat to biodiversity. Rachel Carson wrote the best-selling book Silent Spring about biological magnification. The agricultural use of DDT is now banned under the Stockholm Convention on <b>Persistent</b> <b>Organic</b> <b>Pollutants,</b> but it is still used in some developing nations to prevent malaria and other tropical diseases by spraying on interior walls to kill or repel mosquitoes.|$|E

50|$|In its reports EJF has {{expressed}} concern that, like DDT, endosulfan is persistent in the environment, {{where it is}} harmful to mammals, fish, bees, birds and other wildlife. Endosulfan use {{has led to the}} pollution and abandonment of agricultural land and it has been shown to bioaccumulate and travel long distances through air and water. In 2009 the Stockholm Convention's Scientific Committee acknowledged endosulfan as being a <b>persistent</b> <b>organic</b> <b>pollutant.</b>|$|R
50|$|Because of the {{strength}} of the carbon-fluorine bond, many synthetic fluorocarbons and fluorcarbon-based compounds are persistent in the environment. Fluorosurfactants, such as PFOS and PFOA, are persistent global contaminants. Fluorocarbon based CFCs and tetrafluoromethane have been reported in igneous and metamorphic rock. PFOS is a <b>persistent</b> <b>organic</b> <b>pollutant</b> and may be harming the health of wildlife; the potential health effects of PFOA to humans are under investigation by the C8 Science Panel.|$|R
25|$|Pesticide use {{raises a}} number of {{environmental}} concerns. Over 98% of sprayed insecticides and 95% of herbicides reach a destination other than their target species, including non-target species, air, water and soil. Pesticide drift occurs when pesticides suspended {{in the air as}} particles are carried by wind to other areas, potentially contaminating them. Pesticides are one of the causes of water pollution, and some pesticides are <b>persistent</b> <b>organic</b> <b>pollutants</b> and contribute to soil contamination.|$|E
25|$|Some {{species are}} capable of decomposing <b>persistent</b> <b>organic</b> <b>pollutants</b> (POPs) as well, such as organochlorides and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Species such as Suillus variegatus and Paxillus involutus were able to {{mineralize}} 2,4-dichlorophenol both in axenic culture and in an EcM association with Pinus sylvestris. The intact rhizosphere of Pinus taeda also exhibited the capacity to mineralize tetrachloroethylene under natural conditions. The EcM fungi Radiigera atrogleba and Hysterangium garneri were capable of decomposing up to 80% of a particular PCB when tested.|$|E
25|$|Water {{pollution}} is largely {{the product of}} poor urban wastewater management but solid waste and agriculture are also water polluters. In some cases, high salinity, pesticides and other pollutants are present in water close to agricultural, urban, and industrial areas. Downstream of metal mining, flows of effluents also show high levels of cadmium, chrome and other heavy metals – high levels of mercury {{have been found in}} the waters of Samana Bay and the presence of pesticides and <b>persistent</b> <b>organic</b> <b>pollutants</b> (such as DDT and PCBs) in estuary mollusks has also been reported.|$|E
50|$|DDT is an {{organochlorine}} insecticide {{that does not}} occur naturally. It is a <b>persistent</b> <b>organic</b> <b>pollutant</b> (POP) with a half life of 2-15 years. Concerns were raised about its use in the 1940s but the publication of Rachael Carson's book Silent Spring was the catalyst leading to DDT being banned. DDT was first banned in Hungary in 1968 then in Norway and Sweden in 1970, the US in 1972 and the United Kingdom in 1984.|$|R
5000|$|Heptachlor is <b>persistent</b> <b>organic</b> <b>pollutant</b> (POP). It has a half life of ~1.3-4.2 days (air),~0.03-0.11 years (water),~0.11-0.34 years (soil). One study {{described}} its half {{life to be}} 2 {{years and}} claimed that its residues {{could be found in}} soil 14 years after its initial application. Like other POPs, heptachlor is lipophilic and poorly soluble in water (0.056 mg/L at 25 °C), thus it tends to accumulate in the body fat of humans and animals.|$|R
50|$|Endrin is an {{organochloride}} {{with the}} chemical formula C12H8Cl6O that was first produced in 1950 by Shell and Velsicol Chemical Corporation. It was primarily {{used as an}} insecticide, {{as well as a}} rodenticide and piscicide. It is a colourless, odorless solid, although commercial samples are often off-white. Endrin was manufactured as an emulsifiable solution known commercially as Endrex. The compound became infamous as a <b>persistent</b> <b>organic</b> <b>pollutant</b> and for this reason it is banned in many countries.|$|R
25|$|In general, a {{pesticide}} is {{a chemical}} or biological agent (such as a virus, bacterium, antimicrobial, or disinfectant) that deters, incapacitates, kills, or otherwise discourages pests. Target pests can include insects, plant pathogens, weeds, molluscs, birds, mammals, fish, nematodes (roundworms), and microbes that destroy property, cause nuisance, or spread disease, or are disease vectors. Although pesticides have benefits, some also have drawbacks, such as potential toxicity to humans and other species. According to the Stockholm Convention on <b>Persistent</b> <b>Organic</b> <b>Pollutants,</b> 9 of the 12 most dangerous and persistent organic chemicals are organochlorine pesticides.|$|E
25|$|Degradation during service life, {{or after}} {{careless}} disposal, is a chemical change that drastically reduces the {{average molecular weight}} of the polyvinyl chloride polymer. Since the mechanical integrity of a plastic depends on its high average molecular weight, wear and tear inevitably weakens the material. Weathering degradation of plastics results in their surface embrittlement and microcracking, yielding microparticles that continue on in the environment. Also known as microplastics, these particles act like sponges and soak up <b>Persistent</b> <b>Organic</b> <b>Pollutants</b> (POPs) around them. Thus laden {{with high levels of}} POPs, the microparticles are often ingested by organisms in the biosphere.|$|E
25|$|PFOA {{is found}} in {{environmental}} and biological fluids as the anion perfluorooctanoate. PFOA is absorbed from ingestion and can penetrate skin. The oxygens on PFOA are responsible for how it binds proteins with fatty acid or hormone substrates such as serum albumin, liver fatty acid-binding protein, and the nuclear receptors PPARα and possibly CAR. In animals, PFOA is mainly present in the liver, blood, and kidneys. PFOA does not accumulate in fat tissue, unlike traditional organohalogen <b>persistent</b> <b>organic</b> <b>pollutants.</b> In humans, PFOA has an average elimination half-life of about 3 years. Because of this long half-life, PFOA {{has the potential to}} bioaccumulate.|$|E
40|$|<b>Persistent</b> <b>organic</b> <b>pollutant</b> (POP) {{biomonitoring}} {{in humans}} is challenging and generally carried out using blood, breast milk or adipose tissue, with concentrations normalised to the lipid {{content of the}} sample matrix. The goal of this cross-sectional pilot study was to evaluate the validity and feasibility of explanted silicone prostheses as a matrix for <b>persistent</b> <b>organic</b> <b>pollutant</b> biomonitoring in humans. We postulate that pollutant concentrations in silicone prostheses inserted in the body will equilibrate with that in the body over time and provide {{a measure of the}} overall body burden. This study included silicone prostheses from 22 female patients of the Colosseum clinic (Oslo, Norway) collected between September 2010 and April 2012. Absorption of chlorinated and brominated POPs into silicone prostheses during implantation was observed. Relative levels of the different contaminants measured in prostheses were in agreement with those from serum and breast milk analyses from the general Norwegian population. The comparison of serum and breast milk-based literature data with prosthesis concentrations transposed into lipid-normalised concentrations supports the validity of the prosthesis measurements. The median of relative percent differences between measurements with replicate silicone prostheses from 11 patients was below 30...|$|R
40|$|Dicofol {{was listed}} by International POPs Elimination Network (IPEN) as {{requiring}} immediate and urgent considera-tion and thus was {{considered as a}} new candidate by <b>Persistent</b> <b>Organic</b> <b>Pollutant</b> Review Committee (POPRC) as a possible <b>persistent</b> <b>organic</b> <b>pollutant</b> (POP). Dicofol is structurally similar to DDT. It is persistent in food and water, highly toxic to aquatic life and causes egg-shell thinning in some bird species. High concern, {{due to the lack}} of dicofol measurements in the Arctic, proving long range transport and bioaccumulation in wild life species, supports further impact assessment of this product. Under Stockholm Convention, substances identified as POPs are regulated with the objective to protect the environment and the human health. According to this objective, the search of environmental and healthy alternatives is helpful. This paper discusses the use of three groups of chemicals currently applied as alternatives to dicofol. An exhaustive review of the synthesis of dicofol, starting from DDT, and compared to possible substitutes is presented: 1) active principle with fluoralkenyl are proposed as an environmental and healthy alternative to dicofol, 2) inhibitor agents of mitochondrial electron transport as chlorfenapyr, hydramethylnon and pyridaben and 3) pesticides commonly applied in agricultural practices as oxythioquinox, fenbutatin-oxide and formetanate hydrochloride...|$|R
50|$|Human-made hazards {{while not}} {{immediately}} health-threatening {{may turn out}} detrimental to man's well-being eventually, because deterioration in the environment can produce secondary, unwanted negative effects on the human ecosphere. The effects of water pollution may not be immediately visible because of a sewage system that helps drain off toxic substances. If those substances {{turn out to be}} <b>persistent</b> (e.g. <b>persistent</b> <b>organic</b> <b>pollutant),</b> however, they will literally be fed back to their producers via the food chain: plankton -> edible fish -> humans. In that respect, a considerable number of environmental hazards listed below are man-made (anthropogenic) hazards.|$|R
