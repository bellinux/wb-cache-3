5|$|A {{central part}} of the {{non-discrimination}} <b>policy</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Mining Code of 7 August 1925. It is uncertain if the code is internationally binding, or if it can be amended unilaterally by Norway. Specifically, the commissioner issues licenses to search for minerals and state-owned and other owner's land and to register claims. To maintain a claim, the owner must work 1,500 man-hours per five years and pay an annual fee of 6,000 Norwegian krone. However, the Ministry of Trade and Industry may grant exceptions from the work obligation under specific conditions.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{economic}} theory behind congestion pricing, {{the objective of this}} <b>policy</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> use of the price mechanism to make users more aware of the costs that they impose upon one another when consuming during the peak demand, and that they should pay for the additional congestion they create, thus encouraging the redistribution of the demand in space or in time, or shifting it to the consumption of a substitute public good; for example, switching from private transport to public transport.|$|E
5|$|The other {{defining}} {{aspect of}} Turkey's foreign <b>policy</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> country's long-standing strategic {{alliance with the}} United States. The common threat posed by the Soviet Union during the Cold War led to Turkey's membership of NATO in 1952, ensuring close bilateral relations with Washington. Subsequently Turkey benefited from the United States' political, economic and diplomatic support, including in key {{issues such as the}} country's bid to join the European Union. In the post–Cold War environment, Turkey's geostrategic importance shifted towards its proximity to the Middle East, the Caucasus and the Balkans.|$|E

25|$|The ecophilosophy of Garrett Hardin is one {{perspective}} {{from which to}} analyze the reproductive rights of human beings. For the most part, Hardin argues that it is immoral to have large families, especially since they do a disservice to society by consuming an excessive amount of resources.

25|$|In {{the post}} Cold War era, a {{significant}} aspect of India's foreign <b>policy</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Look East Policy. During the cold war, India's relations with its South East Asian neighbours {{was not very}} strong. After {{the end of the}} cold war, the government of India particularly realised the importance of redressing this imbalance in India's foreign policy. Consequently, the Narsimha Rao government in the early nineties of the last century unveiled the look east policy. Initially it focused on renewing political and economic contacts with the countries of East and South-East Asia.|$|E

25|$|Drinking {{water and}} {{sanitation}} <b>policy</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> constitutional responsibility of provincial governments. Municipal utilities are accountable to both the provincial and local governments, {{but there is little}} regulation of their performance. This has changed to some extent in Punjab in 2006 when the provincial government, through its Housing, Urban Development and Public Health Engineering Department drew up a roadmap for reforming its water utilities. The roadmap aimed at making the five largest utilities, called the WASAs, more professional and accountable through the appointment of new managing directors from the private sector and through the signing of performance contracts between the provincial government and the utilities.|$|E
25|$|Agricultural <b>policy</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> set of {{government}} decisions and actions relating to domestic agriculture and imports of foreign agricultural products. Governments usually implement agricultural policies {{with the goal}} of achieving a specific outcome in the domestic agricultural product markets. Some overarching themes include risk management and adjustment (including policies related to climate change, food safety and natural disasters), economic stability (including policies related to taxes), natural resources and environmental sustainability (especially water policy), research and development, and market access for domestic commodities (including relations with global organizations and agreements with other countries). Agricultural policy can also touch on food quality, ensuring that the food supply is of a consistent and known quality, food security, ensuring that the food supply meets the population's needs, and conservation. Policy programs can range from financial programs, such as subsidies, to encouraging producers to enroll in voluntary quality assurance programs.|$|E

Although initially removing the ban introduced by the previous government, the Borisov Cabinet re-introduced it in 2012 with the aim {{to reduce the number of}} smokers from 40% of the population to about 15–20%.During its term, Borisov's first government also achieved the second-lowest debt burden in the European Union, and the third-lowest budget deficit in the European Union. Parliament also adopted changes in the organic budget law that mandate budget deficits below 2% of GDP in any one year. These changes were fashioned after a similar legal change in Germany and have the effect of curbing wasteful government spending. The strong fiscal <b>policy</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> main achievement of the GERB government.

500|$|The differing {{economic}} {{needs of}} OPEC member states often affect the internal debates behind OPEC production quotas. Poorer members have pushed for production cuts from fellow members, {{to increase the}} price of oil and thus their own revenues. These proposals conflict with Saudi Arabia's stated long-term strategy of being a partner with the world's economic powers to ensure a steady flow of oil that would support economic expansion. [...] Part of the basis for this <b>policy</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Saudi concern that overly expensive oil or unreliable supply will drive industrial nations to conserve energy and develop alternative fuels, curtailing the worldwide demand for oil and eventually leaving unneeded barrels in the ground. [...] To this point, Saudi Oil Minister Yamani famously remarked in 1973: [...] "The Stone Age didn't end because we ran out of stones." ...|$|E

One exception to this <b>policy</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Walt Disney movie Follow Me, Boys! with Fred McMurray portraying a Scoutmaster of a rural troop.
