50|$|Canadian {{philosophers}} in {{the postwar}} era have attempted, {{in a number of}} ways, to resolve these conflicts and to legitimize religious belief. A variety of approaches have been used. Some have stressed the similarities between religion and science, as have F.W. Waters (1967) and Alastair McKinnon (1970). Others, including Lionel Rubinoff, have emphasized the importance of placing our scientific view of the world in a larger human context. There have been attempts to resolve the conflict, through science, as seen in the writings of Charles De Koninck (1960), Thomas Goudge (1961), and A.H. Johnson (1962). Others have attempted to argue the rational nature of religious belief. Some, inspired by St. Thomas Aquinas, include Bernard Lonergan (1952), Louis-Marie Régis (1959), Joseph Owens (1968), Jean-Louis Allard (1979, 1982), and Lawrence Dewan, OP. More general approaches defending the reasonability of religion have been taken by Leslie Armour and William Sweet. Still others have attempted to address issues in the philosophy of religion by questioning underlying issues in metaphysics. Those following this approach within the analytic tradition include Kai Nielsen, Donald Evans (1963), Terence Penelhum (1970), Alistair M. Macleod (1973), and Jay Newman (1986). Phenomenology has also played a role, as seen in the work of Emil Fackenheim (1961), Benoit <b>Pruche</b> (1977-1980), René l'Ecuyer (1980), Jacques Croteau (1981), Cyril Welch (1982), Gary Madison (1988), Hendrik Hart (1990), Jean Grondin (1995), and Thomas De Koninck (1995).|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} we review the ecology and {{physiology}} of mountain hemlock (Tsuga mertensiana (Bong.) Carrière) {{in the context}} of a dendroclimatological analysis. To better understand the relationship between mountain hemlock growth and climate variability throughout its range we have analyzed chronologies from 10 coastal sites, lo-cated along a transect extending from northern California to southern Alaska. The chronologies exhibit significant large-scale cross-correlations, with two distinct growth regions implied: chronologies from the northern Cascades in California, to the Queen Charlotte Islands, British Columbia, are correlated with each other but are distinct from Alas-kan chronologies. While intervals of coherent reduced growth along the entire transect occur episodically throughout the record, intervals of coherent enhanced growth are less common. Response function analyses indicate that summer temperature is the most influential factor limiting growth throughout the study region, while winter precipitation is an additional limiting factor south of Alaska. Warm summer temperatures are associated with enhanced growth in the cur-rent year but with reduced growth in the following year. This response is believed to be a reflection of the energy re-quired to mature cones initiated in the preceding year. The association with winter precipitation may reflect the role of deep, persistent snowpacks in regulating the duration of the growing season.

Cedar seeds were sown on reference and local soils isolated from surrounding soil, on nonisolated local soil, and on forest floor with moss removed. Western hemlock, amabilis fir, and cedar seeded on forest floor acted as controls. Treatments were {{implemented in the}} HA interior and the HA–clearcut edge, with soil treatments also imple-mented in clearcuts. Germinants and very young seedlings of cedar have a low leaf area of needle-like primary foliage. Cedar development of secondary foliage (the scale foliage normally associated with this species) was correlated with greater vigour and growth. Secondary foliage developed in the rankings forest edge and clearcut> forest interior, and reference isolated soil> local isolated soil> nonisolated local soil. Seedling survival rankings were edge> interior, and amabilis fir> hemlock> cedar on soil and with moss removed> cedar on forest floor. Cedar and amabilis fir showed a smaller growth response to light than hemlock. The results indicate that cedar, normally considered a late successional species, needs disturbance for early seedling establishment and survival and thus has some characteristics of an early seral species.
