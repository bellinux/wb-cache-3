Although done and done a lot of research, analysis and review of <b>public</b> <b>administration,</b> there is lack of the systematized information about the <b>public</b> <b>administration</b> <b>reforms</b> in Lithuania and other European countries, which have been applied or the 2008 - 2012 crisis period.

The aim of research – to analyze public governance reforms in Lithuania in 2008 - 2012 and juxtapose assessments of public sector executives'. The main research method: COCOP study analysis. It was found that the <b>public</b> <b>administration</b> <b>reforms,</b> according to the respondents, were carried out from top to bottom, a lack of consistency, in part, a complex, were encouraged politicians, were encouraged crisis and the specific events, were carried out in a symbolic way, from that part of the trade unions, carried out in order to reduce costs and save, were not involved the society, partly successful, partly through plentiful. The investigation also revealed that there is a very weak link between NPM element – decentralization and NPM element – the formation of market conditions and/or the private sector in adapting the methods in the public sector and the successful assessments of public management. The study showed that there is no substantial and significant link between the other elements of the new public management and the successful evaluation of reforms...|$|R

40|$|This thesis explores how and to {{what extent}} the <b>public</b> <b>administration</b> <b>reforms</b> {{introduced}} in the 2000 s have affected the roles of governors and district governors in Turkey and to identify the intended and unintended consequences of the <b>public</b> <b>administration</b> <b>reforms</b> and their implications for roles of governors and district governors. This topic is important because in 2001, Turkey was hit by a large economic crisis which affected the country negatively. After that economic crisis, many <b>public</b> <b>administration</b> <b>reforms,</b> which were inspired by some of the ideas of the New Public Management, were introduced in the 2000 s in Turkey in order to ensure the effectiveness, efficiency, productivity, transparency, openness and accountability of the <b>public</b> <b>administration</b> and the delivery of public services by reconstructing how the <b>public</b> <b>administration</b> operates. The <b>public</b> <b>administration</b> <b>reforms</b> have changed the structure, roles, and responsibilities of both the central and local governments, as well as the traditional understanding of the public administrators. After these reforms were implemented, the main administrative structure of the provincial administrative system was shaken, with the roles, powers, responsibilities, and even the reason for the governors and district governors' existence being called into question. This research is done by conducting both a survey (with 304 out of the 1426 responding) and semi-structured elite interviews with 65 governors, deputy governors, and district governors. The major findings of the research are, firstly, that the classical traditional and historically important roles and powers of the governors and district governors have been eroded with local governments gaining power and roles at their expense. So, secondly, the mayors are now more prominent than the civil administrators. Three further effects on governors and district governors are found. One is that their roles have become increasingly politicised and the other is that they have had to shift their philosophy from the state-centric view to the citizen-centric one. And lastly, new roles have emerged...|$|R
40|$|The <b>public</b> <b>administration</b> <b>reforms</b> {{contained}} in the Public Service Act 1999 (Cth), Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 (Cth) and Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997 (Cth) apparently devolve ‘responsibility’ to Agency Heads, Chief Executives and Directors respectively. This article surveys these framework legal arrangements applying to the executive and then documents the formal involvement of Ministers to assess the notions of responsible government and ministerial responsibility. The article concludes that the real and practical advance of devolution in the <b>public</b> <b>administration</b> <b>reforms</b> has been {{to distinguish between the}} spheres of activities of Ministers and public servants. As a consequence, there is a more nuanced understanding of responsible government and ministerial responsibility. It is seen that the ‘responsibilities’ of Ministers are separated from those of Agency Heads/Chief Executives/Directors, albeit the Ministers remain the conduit between the executive and the Parliament...|$|R

40|$|Public {{management}} {{reforms are}} usually underpinned by arguments {{that they will}} make the <b>public</b> <b>administration</b> system more effective and efficient. In practice, however, {{it is very hard}} to determine whether a given reform will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the <b>public</b> <b>administration</b> system in the long run. Here, I shall examine how the concept of the soft budget constraint (SBC) introduced by János Kornai (Kornai 1979, 1986; Kornai, Maskin & Roland 2003) can be applied to this problem. In the following, I shall describe the Hungarian <b>public</b> <b>administration</b> <b>reforms</b> implemented by the Orbán government from 2010 onward and analyze its reforms, focusing on which measures harden and which ones soften the budget constraint of the actors of the Hungarian <b>public</b> <b>administration</b> system. In the literature of economics, there is some evidence-based knowledge on how to harden/soften the budget constraint, which improves/reduces the effectiveness and hence the efficiency of the given system. By using the concept of SBC, I also hope to shed some light on the rationale behind the Hungarian government’s introduction of such a contradictory reform package. Previously, the concept of SBC was utilized narrowly in public management studies, mostly in the field of fiscal federalism. My goal is to apply the concept to a broader area of public management studies. My conclusion is that the concept of SBC can significantly contribute to public management studies by deepening our knowledge on the reasons behind the success and failure of <b>public</b> <b>administration</b> <b>reforms...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{advent of}} new ICTs {{brought a lot}} of new {{assumptions}} about radical changes in our society. In the context of the arrival of a new society, <b>public</b> <b>administration</b> was supposed to witness (and to address or implement) changes at different levels, such as:• citizenship (citizens becoming participants in governance or even a shift to e-democracy);• the nature of public service jobs (in terms of skills, work processes and job design);• organizational changes (from a hierarchical to a more horizontal structure, to network or even virtual organizations); and • the entire government (from classic bureaucracy to New Public Management and to network and digital governance). Technological change cannot be judged outside the social, economic and political frameworks. The massive change in our society cannot be explained only by technological (especially ICT) factors. Excluding other factors may help us predict easier (but not more accurately) future evolutions but as a scientiﬁc effort it is a bad practice. Much of the assumptions about technological change came from hasty generalizations. The changing nature of some collective actions, jobs in certain areas of the economy or organizations were considered as optimal (and necessary) paths for the entire society (from individual to national levels). <b>Public</b> <b>administration</b> <b>reforms</b> are far from being a consequence of new technologies. Moreover <b>public</b> <b>administration</b> <b>reforms</b> do not embed ICTs and do not have a happy marriage with e-government...|$|R

The regime structure, {{especially with regard to}} public employment regulation, shows a high degree of institutional coherence with the co-ordination rules applying to the market economy. Probing deeper, we construct an index of politico-administrative regulation, which is compared to Hall and Gingerich’s (2009) index of market coordination.

40|$|This paper {{identifies}} the distinctive {{characteristics of the}} internal labour market of the <b>public</b> <b>administration.</b> It gives some examples of innovation in human resource management (particularly {{in the field of}} performance-related pay), and discusses whether and how these processes provide a solution to the problems of identity, efficiency and conflict that have affected the <b>public</b> <b>administration</b> on a broad front over the last decade. The main results of the analysis have revealed the weak institutionalisation of the <b>public</b> <b>administration.</b> The selection criteria by which the organisation determines the professional mix of occupational structure and creates a basis for performance behaviour and attitudes are very weak. Limited mobility and poor wage dynamics are the factors most strongly affecting the internal labour market. This, along with other factors discussed in the paper, makes it extremely difficult to enact private sector principles suitable to the <b>public</b> <b>administration</b> (regardless of the specific traits of the organisations concerned).

40|$|The {{relationship}} between development and governance {{is a central}} question in the pub-lic administration literature on developing countries. Yet, we still understand little about the gap between urban and rural governance in these nations. Our paper tackles this issue using the novel Vietnam Provincial Governance and <b>Public</b> <b>Administration</b> Performance Index (PAPI). PAPI is Vietnam’s largest nationwide survey, and it is con-siders six dimensions of local <b>public</b> <b>administration,</b> including participation, transpar-ency, accountability, corruption control, administrative procedures, and public service delivery. Using a small area estimation approach we present three new findings. First, urban citizens report better local governance and <b>public</b> <b>administration</b> than rural citi-zens do. Second, districts with better reported governance {{tend to have a}} smaller urban-rural <b>public</b> <b>administration</b> gap. Third, this gap follows a U-shaped pattern, decreasing initially and then increasing slightly as local living standards rise. These findings have implications for priorities in <b>public</b> <b>administration</b> <b>reforms...</b>|$|R

The institutionalisation of these meetings has helped reduce labour conflicts as much as possible, and to instil trust {{between the government and}} workers’ unions, both of which have shored up social stability which is a pre-requisite for the harmonious development of a nascent democracy.|$|E

40|$|Abstract in Undetermined Uzbekistan, after gaining {{independence}} from the Soviet Union in 1991, had publicly declared that it would adhere to democratic governance principles in designing and implementing its <b>public</b> <b>administration</b> policies. As a newly-independent state with democracy claims, Uzbekistan had tried to establish new democratic institutions with an effort to capture international community’s attention and attract foreign direct investment. For a brief period during the first stages of nation-building process there was a widespread assumption that Uzbekistan {{would be able to}} build democratic institutions and market-based economy through <b>reforming</b> its <b>public</b> <b>administration</b> system. Consequently, decentralization reforms had been launched in order to promote the efficiency of <b>public</b> <b>administration</b> at the local level. The main aim of these decentralization reforms was to abandon Soviet-style governance in which the <b>public</b> <b>administration</b> system was centrally-planned. Pre-Soviet institutions and popular traditions have been chosen as a basis for these <b>public</b> <b>administration</b> <b>reforms.</b> Accordingly, pre-Soviet Mahalla institutions (local community groups) presented themselves as feasible solutions. Prior to these reforms, mahallas heavily relied on social norms to enforce the cooperative behavior in the community. The adoption of the Mahalla Law in 1993 (revised in 1999) has strictly formalized the activities of mahallas, thereby indirectly incorporating them into the system of <b>public</b> <b>administration.</b> Mahallas are no longer local informal institutions, now they have become the government’s main agency responsible for implementing social welfare programs and maintaining social order and stability. In the light of growing economic, social and political challenges, mahallas have become the focal point of public policies where the law, social forces and informal economic structures come to interplay. This paper uses mahalla institutions as a case study to examine the nature and paradoxes of state-society relations in post-Soviet Uzbekistan. It is argued that <b>public</b> <b>administration</b> <b>reforms</b> since 1991 have transformed mahallas into the comprehensive system of social control, and therefore, mahallas can be places of democratic transformations or sites of authoritarianism in Uzbekistan...|$|R
