Tracks 1, 4 {{and the end}} {{of track}} 2 were {{recorded}} live at a Massacre concert at CBGB in New York City, April 1980, and were later altered and added to in Switzerland; track 6 is an unaltered improvised <b>piece</b> <b>from</b> the same concert.|$|E
5|$|Stylistically, many {{commentators}} have described The Oceanides as either an outright example of Impressionism or somehow derivative of that art movement. Others have countered that Sibelius's active {{development of the}} two subjects, his sparing use of scales favored by Impressionists, and his prioritization of action and structure over ephemeral, atmospheric background distinguish the <b>piece</b> <b>from</b> quintessential examples, such as Debussy's La mer.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pieces</b> <b>from</b> xiangqi {{are usually}} {{circular}} disks, labeled or engraved with a Chinese character identifying the <b>piece.</b> <b>Pieces</b> <b>from</b> shogi (Japanese chess) are usually wedge-shaped chips, with kanji characters identifying the piece.|$|R
25|$|In 1925, Ottorino Respighi orchestrated four <b>pieces</b> <b>from</b> Péchés de vieillesse as {{the suite}} Rossiniana (he had earlier used <b>pieces</b> <b>from</b> the same {{collection}} {{as the basis}} of his ballet La Boutique fantasque).|$|R

5|$|The Hungarian {{composer}} Béla Bartók {{explained in}} his diary that he was attempting to depict the desperate attempts to escape of a fly caught in a cobweb in his <b>piece</b> <b>From</b> the Diary of a Fly, for piano (Mikrokosmos Vol. 6/142).|$|E
5|$|A <b>piece</b> <b>from</b> Secret of Mana was {{performed}} by the Tokyo Symphony Orchestra for the third Orchestral Game Music Concert in 1993, while one from Seiken Densetsu 3 {{was performed}} for the fifth event in 1996. The same Secret of Mana track was also performed at the fifth Symphonic Game Music Concert in 2007 in Leipzig, Germany. Music from Secret of Mana made up one fourth of the music in the Symphonic Fantasies concerts in Cologne in September 2009 which were produced by the creators of the Symphonic Game Music Concert series and conducted by Arnie Roth.|$|E
5|$|After {{the nine}} Études-Tableaux, Op. 39, Rachmaninoff {{composed}} several minor works in 1917. The Oriental Sketch is a fast-paced piece littered with sixteenth note figures. The piece {{was not intended}} {{to be associated with the}} Orient; the title was given by the publisher. The Prelude in D minor, a dark piece with thick and fast moving chords that repeatedly descend into low register, is a manifestation of his unhappiness with the October Revolution. The manuscript survived and was first published in 1973. His penultimate piano composition (only his Corelli Variations came later) was a one-page piece entitled Fragments, a brief nostalgic <b>piece</b> <b>from</b> his final days in Moscow. It was first published in the magazine, The Etude, in 1919.|$|E
50|$|Four {{of the six}} <b>pieces</b> <b>from</b> Book V, Op. 54, were orchestrated {{under the}} title of Lyric Suite. Both Grieg and Anton Seidl {{had a hand in}} the orchestrations. Grieg also orchestrated two of the <b>pieces</b> <b>from</b> Book IX, Op. 68.|$|R

50|$|When Ricardo Lancaster-Jones y Verea's {{paternal}} grandfather died in 1922, {{he inherited}} an important collection of Mexican Colonial Art (<b>pieces</b> <b>from</b> the Viceroyalty of New Spain period), a collection which was increased through time with more <b>pieces</b> <b>from</b> the Colonial period {{as well as}} from Mexican 19th century. His art collection also included some selected <b>pieces</b> <b>from</b> 20th century's artists like Chucho Reyes (1880-1977), José Clemente Orozco (1883-1949) and Jorge González Camarena (1908-1980). He is mentioned among the most important art collectors in the State of Jalisco by Xavier Torres Ladrón de Guevara (1997).|$|R
5|$|In 1939, before Soviet forces {{attempted}} to invade Finland, the Party Secretary of Leningrad Andrei Zhdanov commissioned a celebratory <b>piece</b> <b>from</b> Shostakovich, entitled Suite on Finnish Themes {{to be performed}} as the marching bands of the Red Army would be parading through the Finnish capital Helsinki. The Winter War was a bitter experience for the Red Army, the parade never happened, and Shostakovich would never lay claim to the authorship of this work. It was not performed until 2001.|$|E
5|$|On March 16, 1824 Mr. Lowndes, the BFBS's {{secretary}} in Corfu, {{sent a letter}} to the society in which he mentioned that the sum paid to Meksi for his work was 6,000 piastras and that Archimandrite Grigor was paid 60 crowns. On September 5, 1824 the Saint Matthew's Gospel was published in Albanian. According to Lowndes' letters, the Albanian community of Missolonghi was extremely excited when mass was said with a <b>piece</b> <b>from</b> Saint Matthew, as since its translation they had been impatient to hear it in Albanian. In July 1827 the form in which the first 500copies of the New Testament were to be bound was decided in London. The entire edition amounted to 2,000copies.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the house}} passed to the National Trust in 1972, major works of {{restoration}} and re-creation have been undertaken {{and a number of}} pieces of Burges furniture, mostly not original to the house, are displayed. These include a bookcase from Buckingham Street and a chimney <b>piece</b> <b>from</b> the Hall at Worcester College, Oxford, where, in the 1960s, some decorative works by Burges were removed, although his redecoration of the college Chapel remains. The aim is, as far as possible, to reinstate the work of Burges and Crace.|$|E

5|$|The M3 Gun Motor Carriage (GMC) was a United States Army tank {{destroyer}} {{equipped with}} one 75mm gun and {{was produced by}} Autocar. After the fall of France, the U.S. Army {{decided to make a}} self-propelled artillery <b>piece</b> <b>from</b> the M1897A4 gun on the M3 chassis, which was designated the T12. After some improvement, it came into production as the M3 Gun Motor Carriage. However, the supply of M2A3 gun shields was insufficient for production needs, so a new gun shield was used. This was designated the M3A1 GMC.|$|E
5|$|The Madrasa al-Taybarsiyya, which {{contains}} {{the tomb of}} Amir Taybars, was built in 1309. Originally intended {{to function as a}} complementary mosque to al-Azhar it has since been integrated {{with the rest of the}} mosque. The Maliki and Shāfi‘ī madh'hab were studied in this madrasa, though it now is used to hold manuscripts from the library. The only surviving <b>piece</b> <b>from</b> the original is the qibla wall and its polychrome mihrab. Al-Maqrizi reported that the madrasa was used only for studying the Shāfi‘ī while the historian Ibn Duqmaq reported that one of the liwans in the madrasa was reserved for Shāfi‘ī teachings while the other was for Maliki teachings.|$|E
5|$|Lex {{tries to}} {{initiate}} an employee buyout, and convinces the employees to mortgage {{their homes to}} help provide the financial resources to complete the buyout. Lionel learns of Lex's plans and buys the Smallville Savings & Loan, so that he may immediately foreclose on all the property when Lex's employees miss their payments. Roger Nixon (Tom O'Brien) tests Clark's abilities by setting off a bomb in his truck, while he is inside. Nixon confronts Clark in the Talon coffee shop, but Lex intervenes on Clark's behalf. Nixon follows Clark home and overhears a conversation about Clark's ship being in the storm cellar, and that Lex has the missing <b>piece</b> <b>from</b> the ship. Nixon goes to the Luthor mansion and steals the octagonal key, and immediately returns to the storm cellar with a video camera.|$|E

50|$|The Alexandria National Museum {{contains}} around 1,800 {{artifacts that}} narrate the story of Alexandria and Egypt. Most of these <b>pieces</b> came <b>from</b> other Egyptian museums. The museum mainly focuses on three collections: Ancient Egyptian, Coptic, and the Muslim world. The museum also includes works from the Hellenistic period, including <b>pieces</b> <b>from</b> Heraklion and Canopus. Objects include canopic jars, Mashrabiya, and <b>pieces</b> <b>from</b> the rule of Nectanebo II. The city of Alexandria is {{also included in the}} collection, including objects from the 20th century. Objects include <b>pieces</b> <b>from</b> Caracalla's rule, figures of Medusa, Islamic clothing, a bust of Briniky, and pieces of ancient ruins. The museum recently exhibited a sculpture which is believed to be of Alexander the Great.|$|R
5|$|Sargent's break {{came when}} Sir Henry Wood visited De Montfort Hall, Leicester, early in 1921 with the Queen's Hall orchestra. As it was {{customary}} to commission a <b>piece</b> <b>from</b> a local composer, Wood invited Sargent {{to write a}} piece entitled Impression on a Windy Day. Sargent completed the work too late for Wood to {{have enough time to}} learn it, and so Wood called on Sargent to conduct the first performance himself. Wood recognised not only the worth of the piece but also Sargent's talent as a conductor and gave him the chance to make his debut conducting the work at Wood's annual season of promenade concerts, generally known as the Proms, in the Queen's Hall on 11 October of the same year.|$|E
5|$|Six medieval coins were recovered, the {{earliest}} {{of which was}} a silver penny of John from the early 13thcentury. Coins from later periods were a silver threepence from the reign of Elizabeth I and a silver penny from Charles I. Only low-denomination coins were found from the 18thcentury and later, including a 10-pfennig <b>piece</b> <b>from</b> Germany dated 1901. Two silver spoons were recovered, one of which was dated 1846 from the hallmark. Objects made from copper alloy were found, many of which were associated with personal adornment and dress including brooches, buckles, and buttons. Also found from this period was a small simple chape (scabbard tip), and part of a skimmer that had been used in the kitchen. Artefacts made from iron, other than nails, were again mainly items of personal adornment and dress. Other identifiable iron items from this period included keys, two possible rowel spurs (spurs with revolving pointed wheels), and about 12horseshoes.|$|E
5|$|The {{men of the}} Australian Light Horse Brigade and New Zealand Mounted Rifles {{who died}} between 1916 and 1918 in Egypt, Palestine and Syria are commemorated by the Desert Mounted Corps Memorial, or Light Horse Memorial, on Anzac Parade, in Canberra, Australia. The {{original}} version of this monument was in Port Said in Egypt, and was mostly destroyed during the 1956 Suez War. A <b>piece</b> <b>from</b> the original memorial, a shattered horse's head, was brought back to Australia and used {{as part of a}} new statue in the A is for Animals exhibition honoring animals who have served with the Australian military. The exhibition also contains the preserved head of Sandy, the only horse to return to Australia after the war.|$|E

5|$|The {{music of}} the {{original}} series was composed by Nobuo Uematsu, Kenji Ito, Ryuji Sasai, and Chihiro Fujioka. Ito went on to be the composer for the Romancing SaGa series, with each arranged album from the series arranged by a different artist off of Ito's work. Ito composed the soundtrack for {{the first game of}} the SaGa Frontier series, but was replaced by Masashi Hamauzu for the second game of the series and Unlimited SaGa. Music from the original soundtracks of the SaGa games has been arranged as sheet music for the piano and published by DOREMI Music Publishing, while tracks from Romancing SaGa Minstrel Song were played at the Press Start -Symphony of Games- 2006 concert and Extra: Hyper Game Music Event 2007 concert in Tokyo and a <b>piece</b> <b>from</b> SaGa Frontier 2 was played at the fifth Symphonic Game Music Concert, held in Leipzig, Germany on August 22, 2007.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} {{application of}} Apollonius' problem, as formulated by Isaac Newton, is hyperbolic trilateration, {{which seeks to}} determine a position from the differences in distances to at least three points. For example, a ship may seek to determine its position from the differences in arrival times of signals from three synchronized transmitters. Solutions to Apollonius' problem were used in World War I to determine the location of an artillery <b>piece</b> <b>from</b> the time a gunshot was heard at three different positions, and hyperbolic trilateration is the principle used by the Decca Navigator System and LORAN. Similarly, the location of an aircraft may be determined from the difference in arrival times of its transponder signal at four receiving stations. This multilateration problem {{is equivalent to the}} three-dimensional generalization of Apollonius' problem and applies to global positioning systems such as GPS. It is also used to determine the position of calling animals (such as birds and whales), although Apollonius' problem does not pertain if the speed of sound varies with direction (i.e., the transmission medium not isotropic).|$|E
5|$|The short <b>piece</b> <b>from</b> SR 36 {{north to}} Peanut {{was added to}} the state highway system in 1907 as part of the Peanut Road, which became Route 35 in 1917. Route 35 was {{extended}} north from Peanut to Route 20 (SR 299) near Douglas City in 1933, and simultaneously a new Route 82 was created, running from Route 3 (I-5) in the Yreka area southwest to Etna and east to Montague. The gap between Douglas City and Etna was filled in 1959 with an extension of Route 82 south to Route 20 near Weaverville; at the same time, the portion between Weaverville and Yreka {{was added to the}} California Freeway and Expressway System, which identifies the main routes of transportation in the state of California. The State Route 3 designation was applied to the Peanut-Montague roadway in the 1964 renumbering. The overlap with temporary I-5 (along the portion where SR 3 runs concurrently with Interstate 5 today) near Yreka was removed when the new I-5 bypass was built; the legislative definition was updated to reflect this in 1974, soon after the building of the bypass.|$|E
