The inhibition was greatest when <b>pyronine</b> was added 2 hr after infection and was less when the dye was added later. It also decreased when the dye was added shortly before infection. It could be reversed by removing <b>pyronine</b> from infected cells less than 2 hr after treatment. In {{the presence of}} the dye, synthesis of virus RNA was inhibited; the residual single-stranded RNA synthesized was not infectious and had abnormal sedimentation characteristics. Infectious double-stranded virus RNA was synthesized normally for 3 hr after infection and was inhibited later. Both virus and cellular protein synthesis were inhibited by <b>pyronine.</b> A possible explanation for these results could be the modification of the template activity of double-stranded virus RNA due to intercalation of <b>pyronine</b> between the base pairs...|$|E

Using the approach of acidic and basic neutralization, the subunits of protein shell in SZLF can be disassociated, and these subunits disassociated can be also recombined into another new complete ferritin again, which sets up a reasonable technology for constructing a nanometer <b>pyronine</b> G core-ferritin(NPGCF). Both UV-Vis spectrophotometry and fluorometry were used to study the construction pathways of NPGCF, giving quantificationally twelve <b>pyronine</b> G molecules that were directly trapped into its protein shell for constructing NPGCF by each apoSZLF molecule.

Covalently linked CD dimers provide many advantages over native CDs in complexation of guest species in terms of their stability, selectivity or flexibility. The studies underpinning this thesis are based on the β-cyclodextrin dimers, N,N’-bis((2 AS, 3 AS) - 3 A-deoxy-β-cyclodextrin- 3 A-yl) succinamide, 33 βCD₂suc, and N,N′-bis(6 A-deoxy-B-cyclodextrin- 6 A-yl) succinamide, 66 βCD₂suc, and the γ-cyclodextrin dimers, N,N′-bis((2 AS, 3 AS) - 3 A-deoxy-γ-cyclodextrin- 3 A-yl) succinamide, 33 γCD 2 suc, and N,N′’-bis(6 A-deoxy-γ-cyclodextrin- 6 A-yl) succinamide, 66 γCD 2 suc, in which the two βCD or γCD cavities are joined together through either the C₃A or C₆A carbons of altropyranose or glucopyranose units, respectively. Often in supramolecular systems, several competing equilibria exist, as exemplified by host–guest complexation and guest aggregation. The complexation of dimerising cationic <b>pyronines</b> B and Y, PB⁺ and PY⁺, by βCD and the βCD dimers, 33 βC₂suc and 66 βCD₂suc, has been studied by UV–vis, fluorescence and ¹H NMR spectroscopy. The complexation constants for the 1 : 1 host–guest complexes are reported as are the dimerisation constants for PB⁺ and PY⁺. The modes of complexation, dimerisation and fluorescence quenching are discussed in light of the structural differences and the 1 D and 2 D ¹H NMR spectroscopic data. The competitive equilibria between the dimerisation and host–guest complexation of hematoporphyrin, HP²⁻, by γCD and two newly synthesised γCD dimers, 33 γCD₂suc and 66 γCD₂suc, have been simultaneously quantified by UV–vis and fluorescence spectroscopy. The competing equilibrium constants, thermodynamic parameters and molecular modelling are reported and the nature of interaction between HP²⁻ and γCD and the γCD dimer hosts is discussed. The new 3 % randomly substituted 1 -naphthyl-sulfonamide poly(acrylate) s, PAA 1 NSen and PAA 1 NShn, have been prepared by 3 % random substitution of either N-(2 - aminoethyl) - 1 -naphthyl-sulfonamide or N-(6 -aminohexyl) - 1 -naphthyl-sulfonamide onto the poly(acrylate) backbone. The complexation of the 1 -naphthyl substituents by βCD and γCD and their succinamide–linked dimers, 33 βCD₂suc, 66 βCD₂suc, 33 γCD₂suc and 66 γCD₂suc, have been quantified by fluorescence spectroscopy. The competition between 1 -naphthyl substituent aggregation and host–guest complexation by the linked CD dimers and the 1 -naphthyl substituents in forming inter–polymer strand cross–links is examined in aqueous solution at the macroscopic level by rheology and at the molecular level by 2 D ¹H NOESY NMR and fluorescence spectroscopy.

40|$|Abstract. Utilization of a {{combined}} Alcian Blue and <b>Pyronine</b> Y histochemical method {{for the assessment}} of multiple parameters in the respiratory tract of various species is described. Acidic mucins were deep blue (sialylated mucins), red (sulfated mucins), or variably purple (mixture of sialylated/ sulfated mucins), and differential mucus production was readily detected in a murine respiratory syncytial virus vaccine model of pulmonary inflammation. Elastic fibers stained red in the walls of pulmonary arteries, connecting airways, alveolar septa, and subpleural interstitium. Mast cells had red to red-purple granular cytoplasmic staining. Nuclei were ubiquitously counterstained pale blue. Representative staining was detected in tissues from multiple species, including inbred mice, rats, ferrets, cats, dogs, sheep, and pigs. The fluorescent property of the stained tissues offers additional modalities with which to analyze tissue sections. This histochemical technique detects multiple critical parameters in routine paraffin sections of lung tissue, reduces the need for repeated serial sectioning and staining, and is cost-effective and simple to perform.

40|$|Supramolecular {{organization}} in nanochannels {{is governed by}} both {{the nature of the}} channels and the size, shape, and charge of the guests, and may also depend on the cosolvent in the host. Oxonine (Ox+) and <b>pyronine</b> (Py+) cationic dyes in zeolite L (ZL) could provide important insight on this issue, but their orientation in the composite materials is not understood yet. Theoretical modeling of Ox+/ZL and Py+/ZL composites indicates that the 70 – 80 ° orientation, deduced from optical microscopy data but incompatible with host–guest geometry contraints, is not stable and reveals two possible orientations for these dyes in ZL nanochannels: perpendicular or parallel to the channel axis. In the hydrated composite, corresponding to optical microscopy experiments conditions, perpendicular Ox+/Py+ is the favored orientation, suggesting a larger portion of perpendicularly oriented dye molecules and a smaller fraction aligned. Optical microscopy data might therefore be reinterpreted as the vector sum of components arising from a population of molecules with nonuniform orientation. The stability order is reversed at dry conditions, indicating that the organization of xanthene dyes in ZL channels is governed by water.

AdeJ belongs to the AcrB protein family (57 % identity with AcrB from Escherichia coli). mRNA analysis by Northern blotting and reverse transcription-PCR indicated that the genes were cotranscribed. Overexpression of the cloned adeIJK operon was toxic in both E. coli and Acinetobacter. The adeIJK genes were detected {{in all of the}} 60 strains of A. baumannii tested. The two latter observations suggest that the AdeIJK complex might contribute to intrinsic but not to acquired antibiotic resistance in Acinetobacter.

Determination of the antibiotic susceptibility of these strains and of BM 4652 and BM 4579, in which the adeIJK operon was provided in trans, indicated that the AdeIJK pump contributes to resistance to β-lactams, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, erythromycin, lincosamides, fluoroquinolones, fusidic acid, novobiocin, rifampin, trimethoprim, acridine, safranin, <b>pyronine,</b> and sodium dodecyl sulfate. The chemical structure of these molecules suggests that amphiphilic compounds are the preferred substrates. The AdeABC and AdeIJK efflux systems contributed in a more than additive fashion to tigecycline resistance...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} {{in order to obtain}} some clues as regards the appreciation of virus lesions developed in the liver of mice inoculated with ectromelia virus. The livers of infected mice were examined for their virus content and their histological and histochemical characters of lesions. Clinical symptoms were manifested 3 to 4 days after an inoculation of a larger amount of virus. The virus appeared in the liver for the first time, 12 hours after inoculation, then steadily increased in amount, with the virus titer reaching 3. 2 x 10 8 LD 50, in moribund mice in the final stages. The lesions in the liver of moribund mice were characteristic of the focal necrosis surrounded with the hypertrophic area of liver cells and accompanied with scanty cellular infiltrations. When routinely examined, almost no remarkable changes were observed in the liver cells during the incubation in spite of a steady increase of virus. Applications of some histochemical methods, however, led to the establishent of certain available information regarding the pathogenesis of virus lesions. The methylgreen-pyronine staining showed significant strengthening of <b>pyronine</b> staining in the cytoplasms and in the nucleoli of the liver cells in the incubation period. An acceleration of activity of alkaline-phosphatase also was observed by the Gomori method. From these histochemical findings it is suggested that the function of the liver cells might possibly be converted to a protein synthesis coupled with virus reproduction...|$|E

40|$|Problems statement: The {{level of}} uterine Secretory-IgA (S-IgA) {{and numbers of}} plasma cells was {{measured}} to observe the differences between two stages of estrous cycle (follicular and luteal phase) in the healthy cycling non pregnant ewes. Approach: Twelve ewes were {{used in this study}} and they were divided into two groups of 6 animals each according to the stages of estrous cycle. All ewes were subjected to estrous synchronization and allowed to undergo one natural estrous cycle after the removal of the sponge. All animals were then slaughtered {{at the end of the}} experiment. The uterine mucus was collected by flushing with a mixture of protease inhibitor cocktail in distilled water. For both stages, the level of uterine S-IgA was quantified by using ELISA and Methyl Green <b>Pyronine</b> staining was used to observe the plasma cell in the tissues of the uterine horn and oviduct of ewe's genital tract. Results: The results were analyzed by independent sample t-test and presented as meanï±SEM. This study showed the relationship of the estrous cycle stages to uterine S-IgA concentration (µg mL - 1) and populations of plasma cell in the healthy non-pregnant cycling ewes. The concentration (µg mL - 1) of S-IgA (0. 20 ± 0. 01) in the follicular phase was highly significant (p Conclusion: The main reason for the immunosuppression during the luteal phase did not fully justified, especially with the presence of potential acquired infection during coitus in the follicular phase and at the same time immune system should decrease accordingly to prevent newly attached fetus rejection by the mother immune system. &# 13; &# 13...|$|E
40|$|The {{organophosphate}} insecticide feneitrothion is {{a contact}} insecticide and selective acaricide. It {{is used as}} a fly, mosquito and cockroach, residual contact spray for farms and public health programs. The objectives of the present study were to evaluate the toxicity of fenitrothion on the female rate and the possible protective effects of ascorbic acid (vitamine C) and beta­carotene as antioxidant agents against the toxicity induced by fenitrothion. Sixty of adult female albino rats were randomly assigned to six equal groups including control group and groups treat­!"successive days. Ingestion of fenitrtothion caused a significant increase in ALT (alanine transferase), AST (aspartate transferase), and AP (alkaline phosphatase). It decreased signifiantly GL (glucose) level, AchE (acetyle cholinesterase) and GSH (glutathion reductase) activities, while, it had insignificant effects on TB (total bilirubine) and a slight decrease in TP (total protein). The histological study of female rat liver tissues by Hx & Eosin,P. A. S, and Methyl Green <b>Pyronine</b> revealed that, fenitrothion showed vascular and degenrative changes in the hepatic cells, Also, it caused a significant decrease in glycogen contents and depletion in of nucleic acids in hepatic cells. Treatments with ascorbic acid and beta­carotene plus fenitrothion hasn't been caused any significant changes in all parameters in serum of female rats.

40|$|A cytochemical and {{electron}} microscope {{study has been}} made of leaves of sugar beet infected with beet yellows virus. Inclusions of particles, which agree in size with beet yellows virus particles isolated by other investigators, have been localized in the ground cytoplasm, in the chloroplasts, and in the nuclei. These particles are circa 100 A in diameter and have an electron-transparent core of 30 to 40 A. Use of acridine orange, azure B, and <b>pyronine</b> Y has revealed that the cytoplasmic inclusion bodies, which consist wholly of the elongate particles, have a strong RNA reaction removable by RNase pretreatment. Particles observed in the chloroplasts {{may or may not be}} associated with lipid spheres. If they are, the particles are confined to the periphery of the spheres. In this position the particles are arranged tangentially and are further arranged parallel into groups which lie at various angles to one another. Within the groups the particles are regularly spaced in a three dimensional lattice. Particles located free in the stromal regions are often arranged regularly in curved rows which lie parallel to one another so that a three dimensional lattice is formed. The dispersed and compact forms of virus inclusions are described and related to the condition of the associated cytoplasm. The ground cytoplasm of cells associated with the sieve elements contains numerous ribosomes. A decrease in the number of ribosomes is concomitant with the increase in size of virus aggregations in a cell. Vesiculation of some component of the cytoplasm occurs during the period of virus replication. The vesicles are approximately 100 m/z in diameter and could be derived from the dictyosomes. At late 1 stages of infection these vesicles collapse and convoluted membranous material appears...|$|E
40|$|The {{morphological}} changes {{observed in}} dog kidney cultured cells infected with distemper virus (Hokkaido strain) were compared cytochemically {{with those of}} measlea virus (Edmonston strain). The results were as follows. 1) Twelve to fourteen after inoculation the CPE was first observed in dog kidney cells infected with distemper virus. The appearanoe of the CPE was seven to ten days later than that of measles virus. 2) The CPE of the distemper virus infected cells was the same multinucleated giant cells, cytoplasmic inclusion bodies, and intranuclear inolusion bodies as those observed in the measles virus infected cell. 3) Both the inclusion bodies in the distemper virus infected cells also showed Feuglen negative, red staining with methylgreen <b>pyronine,</b> RNase resistent, and the cytoplasmic inclusion bodies blue to bluish green, otherwise the intranuclear inclusion bodies unstainable with acridine orange. This indicates that as with measles virus infection the cytoplasmic inclusion bodies have RNA, acid mucopolysacchrides and basic proteins, the intranuclear inclusion bodies no nucleic acids. 4) In the tissue culture cells inoculated with distemper virus the intranuclear inclusion bodies appeared {{at the same time}} or a few days earlier than the cytoplasmic inclusion bodies when stained with Giemsa or acridine orange. 5) The red particles in the cytoplasma of the measles virus infected cells were not detected in the cells inoculated with distemper virus when stained with acridine orange. 6) With acridine orange staining there were no differences of largeness and brightness of the nuclei and nucleoli between the distemper virus infected cells and the control cells. Then it seemed seldom to be an increased metabolism of nucleic acids. 7) Summing up, the morphorogical changes in the tissue culture cells infected with measles virus and distemper virus were quite the same except for the appearance of the CPE after virus inoculation...|$|E
40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{the potential of}} human organotypic skin explant cultures (hOSECs) for screening skin irritants. Test chemicals were applied to the epidermis of the skin explants which were incubated for 4, 24 or 48 h in tissue culture medium. A decrease in epidermal RNA staining, visualised in frozen sections using a modified methyl-green <b>pyronine</b> (MGP) staining procedure, {{was used as a}} marker of irritancy. A decrease in epidermal RNA after a 4 -, 24 - or 48 -h exposure to a certain concentration of a test chemical equated to a MGP score of 3, 2 or 1, respectively. The MGP score was 0 if there was no keratinocyte cytotoxicity after a 48 -h exposure. A minimum of three donors were used per chemical and the average MGP score was used to classify the chemical as irritant or not. Chemicals with an average MGP score > or = 1. 5 were classified as irritants (R 38), at that concentration. Chemicals with a MGP score < 1. 5 were not classified (NC), at that concentration. The results obtained using human skin in vitro were compared with published data obtained using cultured porcine skin, the cutaneous Draize test (from this point referred to as the "rabbit skin irritation test") and volunteer studies. There was an excellent correlation between the classification of a chemical, as R 38 or NC, based on hOSEC and results of volunteer studies. The hOSEC model predicted perfectly the irritation hazard of the 22 chemicals for which volunteer data were available. The porcine OSEC correctly predicted the classification of 21 of 22 (95 %) chemicals and the rabbit skin irritation test correctly predicted the classification of 14 of 15 chemicals (93 %) for which data were available. In conclusion, MGP staining of human skin explant cultures can be used to predicted human skin irritancy in vivo. In addition, the data validate the use of porcine skin as an alternative to human skin for screening for dermal irritants in vitr...|$|E
40|$|This {{project was}} {{designed}} to define the prevalence and associated risk factors of ticks and tick-borne theileriosis and comparative efficacy of various over-the-counter acaricidal and anti-theilerial compounds at the small holder dairy farming system of district Toba Tek Singh (T. T. Singh), Punjab, Pakistan. Questionnaire based stratified random sampling {{was used for the}} screening of animals. Blood and tick samples were collected from 4608 animals for assessing the level of theilerial infections in both tick and host population during November 2010 to October 2012. The overall prevalence of ticks was recorded 52. 14 % (2403 / 4608) in cattle and buffaloes of study area. However, the abundance was found significantly higher in cattle as compared with buffaloes. Among the identified species of ticks, Hyalomma (H.) anatolicum (a.) anatolicum was found significantly predominant followed in order by Rhipicephalus (R.) microplus and R. sanguineus. The overall theilerial infection in the acini of tick salivary glands was recorded 20. 85 % (1126 / 5400). H. a. anatolicum (62. 56 %; 1126 / 1800) was the only infected tick specie in the study area. Methyl <b>pyronine</b> green (MPG) stain, female ticks, riverine area, infesting attitude and cattle specie were found having positive associationbwith theilerial infections in tick acini. The overall prevalence of bovine tropical theileriosis was found 49. 87 % (2298 / 4608) in cattle and buffaloes of the study area with higher prevalence in cattle. Theileria (T.) annulata was the only prevalent specie. Among various associated determinants of a) host, Friesian breed of cattle, Kundi breed of buffaloes, female sex, young age and cattle population b) microclimate, grazing system, tethering of animals, close housing, poor hygienic measures, mixed farming practices, un-cemented floor pattern, pond watering system, tehsil Kamalia and c) macroclimate, rainy season were found having positive correlation with the bovine tropical theileriosis. Hematological analysis showed statistically a significant decrease in mean haemoglobin concentration, packed cell volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, red blood cells count, white blood cells count, neutrophils (P< 0. 001), serum total bilirubin and active serum enzyme, while a significant increase was recorded in lymphocyte count (P< 0. 001), corpuscular volume, serum total protein and albumin.
