40|$|Aim: The study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the technique with maximum accuracy in production of bite mark overlay. Materials and Methods: Thirty subjects (10 males and 20 females; all aged 20 – 30 years) with complete set of natural upper and lower anterior teeth were selected for this study after obtaining approval from the Institutional Ethical Committee. The upper and lower alginate impressions were taken and die stone models were obtained from each impression; overlays were produced from the biting surfaces of six upper and six lower anterior teeth by hand tracing from study casts, hand tracing from wax impressions of the bite surface, radiopaque wax impression method, <b>and</b> <b>xerographic</b> method. These were compared with the original overlay produced digitally. Results: Xerographic method was the most accurate of the four techniques, with the highest reproducibility for bite mark analysis. The methods of wax impression were better for producing overlay of tooth away from the occlusal plane. Conclusions: Various techniques are used in bite mark analysis and the choice of technique depends largely on personal preference. No single technique {{has been shown to}} be better than the others and very little research has been carried out to compare different methods. This study evaluated the accuracy of direct comparisons between suspect's models and bite marks with indirect comparisons in the form of conventional traced overlays of suspects <b>and</b> found the <b>xerographic</b> technique to be the best...|$|R

The Compounds were tested as hole transporting materials in bilayer OLED's using Alq(3) as emitter: devices comprising phenyl substituted indolo[3, 2 -b]carbazole exhibited best overall performance with a turn-on voltage of similar to 5 V, maximum luminance efficiency of 3. 64 cd A(- 1) and maximum brightness of similar to 5700 cd m(- 2).

40|$|In extracting {{predictions}} from {{theories that}} describe a multiverse, {{we face the}} difficulty that we must assess probability distributions over possible observations, prescribed not just by an underlying theory, but by a theory together with a conditionalization scheme that allows for (anthropic) selection effects. This means we usually need to compare distributions {{that are consistent with}} a broad range of possible observations, with actual experimental data. One controversial means of making this comparison is by invoking the 'principle of mediocrity': that is, the principle that we are typical of the reference class implicit in the conjunction of the theory and the conditionalization scheme. In this paper, I quantitatively assess the principle of mediocrity in a range of cosmological settings, employing 'xerographic distributions' to impose a variety of assumptions regarding typicality. I find that for a fixed theory, the assumption that we are typical gives rise to higher likelihoods for our observations. If, however, one allows both the underlying theory and the assumption of typicality to vary, then the assumption of typicality does not always provide the highest likelihoods. Interpreted from a Bayesian perspective, these results support the claim that when one has the freedom to consider different combinations of theories <b>and</b> <b>xerographic</b> distributions (or different 'frameworks'), one should favor the framework that has the highest posterior probability; and then from this framework one can infer, in particular, how typical we are. In this way, the invocation of the principle of mediocrity is more questionable than has been recently claimed. Comment: 14 pages, 3 figure...|$|R

Our approaches involved local adjustment of electrostatics at the surfaces to control material flux. Templating of surface electrostatics was implemented differently for three broad concepts resulting in control over nanomaterial synthesis, deposition, and printing. These three general concepts are: (A) Tailored ZnO nanowire synthesis and integration {{out of the}} liquid phase (B) Arc discharge synthesis and continuous nanocluster deposition from the gas phase (C) Contact electrification <b>and</b> <b>xerographic</b> printing of nanoparticles from the gas phase Concept (A) : We report a method to fabricate and transfer crystalline ZnO with control over location, orientation, size, and shape. The process uses an oxygen plasma treatment in combination with a photoresist pattern on Magnesium-doped GaN substrates to define narrow nucleation regions and attachment points with 100 nanometer scale dimensions. Lateral epitaxial overgrowth follows nucleation to produce single crystalline ZnO which were fabricated into LEDs and photovoltaic cells. Concept (B) : We report a gas phase nanoparticle deposition system which shares characteristics with liquid phase electrodeposition. Clusters of charged nanoparticles selectively deposit onto electrically grounded surfaces. Similar to electroplating, the continued deposition of Au nanoparticles onto underlying resistive traces increased overall line conductivity. Alternatively, semiconducting ZnO and Ge nanomaterial sequentially deposited between interdigitated electrodes and served as addressable sensor active areas. Concept (C) : We report patterned transfer of charge between conformal material interfaces through a concept referred to as nanocontact electrification. Nanocontacts of different size and shape are formed between surface functionalized polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) stamps and other dielectric materials (PMMA, SiO 2). Forced delamination and cleavage of the interface yields a well defined charge pattern with a minimal feature size of 100 nm. The process produces charged surfaces and associated fields that exceed the breakdown strength of air leading to strong long range adhesive forces and force distance curves which are recorded over macroscopic distances. The process is applied to fabricate charge patterned surfaces for nanoxerography demonstrating 200 nm resolution nanoparticle prints and applied to thin film electronics where the patterned charges are used to shift the threshold voltages of underlying transistors by over 500 mV...|$|R
