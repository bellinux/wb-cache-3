40|$|Based on {{experiments}} on the 1 : 20 Hong Kong model diffuser, a numerical model for simulating seawater intrusion and <b>purging</b> process in an invertconnected outfall is developed. An {{extension of the}} theory of Guo and Sharp (1996), this is essentially a one dimensional unsteady flow model with locally 2 D techniques to account for stratification and density changes at riser-tunnel junctions. Numerical predictions of <b>purging</b> flow and times are in good agreement with measurements; key features of the <b>purging</b> sequence are also well-supported by the synoptic observed riser flows. Both experiments and calculations demonstrate that, unlike a soffit-connected outfall, the seawater {{at the bottom of the}} tunnel is initially <b>purged,</b> and the mixing between effluent and seawater is much stronger. The <b>purging</b> sequence in invert-connected situation is usually from seaward end to landward end for unsteady and quasi-steady purging; however for steady <b>purging</b> the sequence is from landward end to seaward end as in soffit-connected outfalls. The presence of an effluent layer at the top of the tunnel (due to e. g. pump shutdown) results in a persistent circulation in the system. The numerical model also shows that shortening the outfall tunnel length by an artificial bend has an effect on the <b>purging</b> sequence and time, but not the <b>purging</b> flow. Two-layer <b>purging</b> occurs in steady <b>purging</b> process and can help reduce <b>purging</b> discharge rate, especially with a large number of risers. Salt-assisted <b>purging</b> is effective only if the duration of the process is sufficiently long; however, the effluent volume required can be larger than that in the pure effluent <b>purging</b> process. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Inbreeding {{depression}} {{is a major}} force affecting the evolution and viability of small popu-lations in captive breeding and restoration programmes. Populations that experience small sizes may be less susceptible to future inbreeding depression {{because they have been}} <b>purged</b> of deleterious recessive alleles. We review issues related to <b>purging,</b> as they apply to the management of small populations, and discuss an experiment we conducted exam-ining <b>purging</b> in populations of mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis). <b>Purging</b> is an important process in many small populations, but the literature contains a diversity of responses to <b>purging</b> both within and among studies. With the exception that slow inbreeding results in more <b>purging</b> and less threat to population viability, there seem to be few consistent trends that aid in prediction of how a <b>purging</b> event will affect a population. In our exam-ination of <b>purging</b> on population viability in mosquitofish, single or multiple bottlenecks do not appear to have resulted in any <b>purging</b> of the influence of genetic load on population growth. Rather, serial bottlenecks resulted in a marked decline in population growth and an increase in extinction. Our results, taken together with those of reviewed studies, suggest that in small populations there is great uncertainty regarding the success of any single <b>purging</b> event in eliminating inbreeding depression, together with the high like-lihood that <b>purging</b> will depress population viability through the fixation of deleterious alleles. In management of captive breeding and restoration programmes, the common practice of avoiding inbreeding and small population sizes should be followed whenever possible...|$|R

40|$|SummaryBackgroundMyeloablative chemoradiotherapy and immunomagnetically <b>purged</b> {{autologous}} {{bone marrow}} transplantation {{has been shown to}} improve outcome for patients with high-risk neuroblastoma. Currently, peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) are infused after myeloablative therapy, but the effect of <b>purging</b> is unknown. We did a randomised study of tumour-selective PBSC <b>purging</b> in stem-cell transplantation for patients with high-risk neuroblastoma. MethodsBetween March 16, 2001, and Feb 24, 2006, children and young adults (< 30 years) with high-risk neuroblastoma were randomly assigned at diagnosis by a web-based system (in a 1 : 1 ratio) to receive either non-purged or immunomagnetically <b>purged</b> PBSC. Randomisation was done in blocks stratified by International Neuroblastoma Staging System stage, age, MYCN status, and International Neuroblastoma Pathology classification. Patients and treating physicians were not masked to treatment assignment. All patients were treated with six cycles of induction chemotherapy, myeloablative consolidation, and radiation therapy to the primary tumour site plus meta-iodobenzylguanidine avid metastases present before myeloablative therapy, followed by oral isotretinoin. PBSC collection was done after two induction cycles. For <b>purging,</b> PBSC were mixed with carbonyl iron and phagocytic cells removed with samarium cobalt magnets. Remaining cells were mixed with immunomagnetic beads prepared with five monoclonal antibodies targeting neuroblastoma cell surface antigens and attached cells were removed using samarium cobalt magnets. Patients underwent autologous stem-cell transplantation with PBSC as randomly assigned after six cycles of induction therapy. The primary endpoint was event-free survival and was analysed by intention-to-treat. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials. gov, number NCT 00004188. Findings 495 patients were enrolled, of whom 486 were randomly assigned to treatment: 243 patients to receive non-purged PBSC and 243 to received <b>purged</b> PBSC. PBSC were collected from 229 patients from the <b>purged</b> group and 236 patients from the non-purged group, and 180 patients from the <b>purged</b> group and 192 from the non-purged group received transplant. 5 -year event-free survival was 40 % (95 % CI 33 – 46) in the <b>purged</b> group versus 36 % (30 – 42) in the non-purged group (p= 0 · 77); 5 -year overall survival was 50 % (95 % CI 43 – 56) in the <b>purged</b> group compared with 51 % (44 – 57) in the non-purged group (p= 0 · 81). Toxic deaths occurred in 15 patients during induction (eight in the <b>purged</b> group and seven in the non-purged group) and 12 during consolidation (eight in the <b>purged</b> group and four in the non-purged group). The most common adverse event reported was grade 3 or worse stomatitis during both induction (87 of 242 patients in the <b>purged</b> group and 93 of 243 patients in the non-purged group) and consolidation (131 of 177 in the <b>purged</b> group vs 145 of 191 in the non-purged group). Serious adverse events during induction were grade 3 or higher decreased cardiac function (four of 242 in the <b>purged</b> group and five of 243 in the non-purged group) and elevated creatinine (five of 242 in the <b>purged</b> group and six of 243 non-purged group) and during consolidation were sinusoidal obstructive syndrome (12 of 177 in the <b>purged</b> group and 17 of 191 in the non-purged group), acute vascular leak (11 of 177 in the <b>purged</b> group and nine of 191 in the non-purged group), and decreased cardiac function (one of 177 in the <b>purged</b> group and four of 191 in the non-purged group). InterpretationImmunomagnetic <b>purging</b> of PBSC for autologous stem-cell transplantation did not improve outcome, perhaps because of incomplete <b>purging</b> or residual tumour in patients. Non-purged PBSC are acceptable for support of myeloablative therapy of high-risk neuroblastoma. FundingNational Cancer Institute and Alex's Lemonade Stand Foundation...|$|R

5|$|During Stalin's Great <b>Purge</b> in the late-1930s, {{which had}} not ended {{by the time of}} the German {{invasion}} on 22 June 1941, much of the officer corps of the Red Army was decimated and their replacements, appointed by Stalin for political reasons, often lacked military competence. Of the five Marshals of the Soviet Union appointed in 1935, only Kliment Voroshilov and Semyon Budyonny survived Stalin's <b>purge.</b> Tukachevsky was killed in 1937. Fifteen of 16 army commanders, 50 of the 57 corps commanders, 154 of the 186 divisional commanders, and 401 of 456 colonels were killed, and many other officers were dismissed. In total, about 30,000 Red Army personnel were executed. Stalin further underscored his control by reasserting the role of political commissars at the divisional level and below to oversee the political loyalty of the army to the regime. The commissars held a position equal to that of the commander of the unit they were overseeing. But in spite of efforts to ensure the political subservience of the armed forces, in the wake of Red Army's poor performance in Poland and in the Winter War, about 80 percent of the officers dismissed during the Great <b>Purge</b> were reinstated by 1941. Also, between January 1939 and May 1941, 161 new divisions were activated. Therefore, although about 75 percent of all the officers had been in their position for less than one year at the start of the German invasion of 1941, many of the short tenures can be attributed not only to the <b>purge,</b> but also to the rapid increase in creation of military units.|$|E
