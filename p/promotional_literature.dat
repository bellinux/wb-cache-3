50|$|The new {{residents}} quickly found that life in Mosida {{did not live}} up to the <b>promotional</b> <b>literature's</b> glowing descriptions. The fruit trees began to die; it transpired that the soil was too salty and mineralized for them. Other crops such as wheat and peanuts did better, but swarms of grasshoppers damaged the surviving crops, especially the alfalfa. Transportation to and from the isolated site was a challenge, and became even harder when the Mosida boat was destroyed in a fire on April 17, 1913. The pumping and irrigation operations also proved more expensive than planned, despite a second pumping plant installed in 1914. The lake level fluctuated widely from year to year, dropping so low in 1915 that the water could no longer be pumped. Individual landowners and the company itself found themselves increasingly in debt, and in 1915 the Mosida Fruit Lands Company was placed under court-ordered receivership. Creditors tried to keep the project going for a few more years, but by 1917 most people had left. The population dropped to 67 by 1920, and with no more water or power available Mosida died. The last resident stayed until 1924.|$|R

40|$|Objectives: Evaluation and {{comparison}} of ethical standards of published drug <b>promotional</b> <b>literatures</b> (DPLs) between different Indian and non-Indian scientific medical journals regarding compliance to the World Health Organization (WHO) and International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations (IFPMAs) guidelines. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional, observational study {{was carried out}} at pharmacology department. DPLs published in Indian and non-Indian scientific medical journals available at central library of medical college {{during the period of}} 6 months were collected according to selection criteria. DPLs were evaluated and compared for compliance to ethical standards of drug promotion laid by the WHO and IFPMA. Data were analyzed using Fisher's exact test. Results: Out of total 178 DPLs, 103 DPLs were from Indian journals and 75 DPLs were from non-Indian journals. When compared regarding compliance to all the 11 ethical criteria of WHO, no significant difference was found between DPLs published in Indian and non-Indian journals. However, DPLs from indian journals contained significantly less information regarding dosage regimen (P = 0. 0096), adverse drug reactions (P = 0. 0028), warnings (P = 0. 0104) and major drug interactions (P < 0. 0001) as compared to non-Indian journals. Compliance to all the five IFPMA criteria was significantly higher in DPLs of non-Indian journals (88 %) than Indian journals (39 %) (P < 0. 0001). Conclusion: Noncompliance to ethical standards of WHO and IFPMA guidelines is more common in DPLs of Indian journals as compared to non-Indian journals. Thus strict implementation of regulatory measures regarding DPLs published in Indian medical journals is recommended...|$|R

500|$|The NWOBHM– {{comprising}} bands {{with very}} different influences and styles– was promoted as both a movement and a distinct music genre only in its formative years during the mid-to-late 1970s. Especially in those early years, what characterised the flood of new music was its raw sound, {{due in large part}} to low-budget productions, but also to the amateurish talents of many young bands. Those young musicians were also linked by a shared inspiration from the works of the aforementioned successful heavy rock bands of the late 1960s and 1970s, and kept a sort of continuity with the earlier acts, whose music had temporarily gone out of fashion, but was still thriving underground. However, the media of the 1980s and the <b>promotional</b> <b>literature</b> of record labels typically placed rock music that employed loud guitars, but was not classifiable as [...] "punk" [...] under the blanket term [...] "heavy metal", subsuming the entire spectrum of NWOBHM bands within a single music genre.|$|E

40|$|We {{perform a}} {{meta-analysis}} to formulate generalizations {{on the effectiveness}} of pharmaceutical <b>promotional</b> instruments. A <b>literature</b> search on this topic yields 58 usable (published and unpublished) sources documenting 781 effects. We investigate different direct-to-physician (DTP) and direct-to-consumer (DTC) instruments and study whether and how moderator variables influence promotional effectiveness. Pharmaceutical promotional elasticities are modest in size and differ among marketing instruments. In general, DTP elasticities are higher than DTC elasticities, but the relative effectiveness of DTP instruments depends on the disease category. Higher elasticities appear in studies that include price as an independent variable in the models. Studies that account for endogeneity find lower elasticities. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V.

500|$|Despite {{receiving}} top-billing in {{the opening}} credits, Gable—along with Leigh, Howard, and de Havilland who receive second, third and fourth billing respectively—has a relatively low placing in the cast list, due to its unusual structure. Rather than ordered by conventional billing, the cast is broken down into three sections: the Tara plantation, Twelve Oaks, and Atlanta. The cast's names are ordered according to the social rank of the characters; therefore Thomas Mitchell, who plays Gerald O'Hara, leads the cast list {{as the head of}} the O'Hara family, while Barbara O'Neil as his wife receives the second credit and Vivien Leigh as the eldest daughter the third credit, despite having the most screen time.

500|$|The Fabulous Kangaroos are {{considered}} {{by many in the}} wrestling world {{as one of the best}} tag-teams in the history of wrestling. In fact, many people in the past held the mistaken belief that The Fabulous Kangaroos invented tag team wrestling, which was not true since tag team wrestling had been seen as early as 1936. The reason for this belief lies in the fact that The Kangaroos were one of the first teams to popularize tag team wrestling, and because tag teaming was often referred to as [...] "Australian rules" [...] or [...] "Australian tag team". The Kangaroos themselves were not slow to play off this belief, often claiming (kayfabe) that they were such a well coordinated tag team because [...] "Amateur team wrestling was very popular in Australia". The term [...] "Australian rules" [...] had been coined long before 1957 debut of The Kangaroos.

40|$|ABSTRACT This article {{addresses}} the cultural {{significance of the}} Australian Early Development Index (AEDI) and discusses changes that the discourse of this instrument makes {{to the way in}} which the child is conceptualised. It analyses the technological function of the AEDI to examine how it makes the child a universal resource for human capital. The article examines messages in <b>promotional</b> and research <b>literature</b> surrounding the AEDI that represent it as a reliable statistical instrument which will promote social justice and equity for young children and their families. The scholarly discourse has so far failed to address the broader context of neo-liberal economic and social reform from which the AEDI – and its Canadian predecessor, the Early Development Instrument (EDI) – initially emerged. The article therefore interrogates the EDI and the AEDI as mechanisms for refining and expanding markets in the management and regulation of children from disadvantaged backgrounds and their accompanying vulnerability. These market expansions draw upon econometric theoretical sources, leading to conceptual changes relating to understandings of children and new concepts and practices for the early childhood education sector. Discourses surrounding the use of the AEDI are informed, in part, by perceptions about the breakdown of the family and the impact this will have for long-term sources of social and economic cohesion. The article examines the symbolism entailed by the ways in which the literature surrounding the AEDI and EDI addresses moral and civil sources of authority in modern Western civilisation...|$|R

40|$|The authors present general {{review of}} the {{literature}} and the results of an empirical research on the subject. A cross-sectional questionnaire-based survey was conducted, being answered by 350 respondents: mix of graduate and post graduate doctors of private and public hospitals of Karachi City, and pharmaceutical personnel (mix of sales and marketing) of national and multinational pharmaceutical companies operating in Pakistan. To test hypothesis, structural equation modelling (SEM) was employed using AMOS 7 software package. As data are normally distributed, maximum likelihood method of estimation was used. Factorial ANOVA also enables us to examine the interaction effect between the factors. The results from factorial ANOVA test all the hypotheses of model, and results were declared significant at p < 0. 05. Findings are interesting as they establish association between variables (scientific <b>literatures,</b> <b>promotional</b> material, regular follow up, CMEs & conferences, personalized activities) and prescription behavior of doctors mediated by strong phenomenon of medical representative PR and brand image of a company/product in changing the prescription behavior of doctors. Based on the results of this study, the pharmaceutical companies can device better marketing strategies keeping in view of these mediating effects. The article presents only two mediating and five marketing factors, whereas, more marketing and mediating variables can be added and tested, so, in future this gape can be overcome by other researchers. Moreover, a larger sample size could be applied and the scope of study can be enhanced...|$|R
40|$|As Alderman (2010 : 90) has {{recently}} written, the potential struggle {{to determine what}} conception of the past will prevail constitutes the politics of memory. This paper aims to investigate the politics of memory at play in determining how Dublin’s colonial heritage is constructed and represented to tourists. Dublin’s profile as a tourism destination has grown recently. It attracted 5. 4 million visitors in 2009 (Fáilte Ireland 2010). Culture and heritage underpin both its touristic appeal and the city’s official efforts to represent itself as a destination. Much of Dublin’s most iconic built heritage is strongly associated with its development as a colonial capital. Many decades after independence, contemporary Ireland is a vastly changed place. Yet the process of dealing with colonial heritage in tourism contexts is not unproblematic. This paper begins to unravel both the construction and {{the representation of the}} city as a tourism destination to investigate how the city is remembering/forgetting its colonial heritage. Its approach is interpretivist, and methodologically, its efforts focus on one hugely important site: Dublin Castle, the seat of English administration in Ireland for 700 years. Centrally located in a prime tourist area to the south of the city centre Dublin Castle is the 6 th most visited fee-paying attraction in the state (Fáilte Ireland 2010). Data are gathered through: In-depth interviewing with key personnel involved in the multiple sites operating as distinct tourist ventures within the Castle Discourse analysis of the Castle’s <b>promotional</b> and informational <b>literature</b> Analysis of the tour guiding narratives offered to tourists.

Currently, business and communities knowledge very little about what the FET/Technical College is offering and its importance to the society as whole. Therefore there is a great need to market the technical sector so that the community is knowledgeable about the FET/Technical Colleges. The research conducted focuses on which promotional strategies are effective in marketing the FET Colleges. In order to make technical college students marketable it is necessary to market the institutions effectively so that all the stakeholders can be aware of what technical colleges can offer. Because of high competition in this industry, it is of vital importance not to be out-marketed by competitors by keeping abreast of new trends in promotional strategies. In order to obtain more relevant information about <b>promotional</b> strategies a <b>literature</b> study was conducted to develop a questionnaire to survey the importance of promotional strategies and determine which promotional strategies are being used by the FET Colleges.
