Sindhupalchok, Kavre and Nuwakot were the three districts selected for the maize CBSP groups under the respective Agriculture Development Offices identified by CDD for the present study. Altogether 2 x 6 x 3 samples for the study were collected. Seed damage as broken seeds, damages on embryo, seed quality assessments like seed moisture content, <b>pure</b> seed <b>percentage,</b> seed vigor measured by root and shoot length, seed germination, and embryo damages were carried in seed testing laboratory in Seed Science & Technology Division (SSTD) Khumaltar following the ISTA Rules, 2007. For the embryo damage test, tetrazolium salt test (TZ) was conducted following the procedures prescribed for maize seed in ISTA Rules, 2007. All the samples possessed of 99 % of pure seed. It ranged from 99. 51 % in Nuwakot to 99. 96 % in Kavre for samples using corn sheller. They were found within the standards for pure seed and were of acceptable range. The corn sheller was found as efficient as that of hand shelling. There was not found the effect on the quality of seed that they were within the standard values. The germination percentage decreased from initial 96 to 85 (Kavre); 94 to 87 (Sindhupalchwok) and 91 to 83 (Nuwakot). This study concludes that the corn sheller techniques offer Wooden corn sheller is a simple but traditional device made locally for shelling the maize kernels and distributed to Community based seed production (CBSP) farmers contribute to minimizing the impacts of hand sheller on agricultural systems...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSome gynodioecious species present {{not only}} {{hermaphrodite}} and female individuals but also gynomonoecious individuals that produce both female and perfect flowers. In {{a study of}} natural populations of Silene italica, we found that gynomonoecious individuals were common in all populations (from 13 to 39 %) and that their frequency was independent of the frequency of females. No relationship {{was found between the}} number of flowers a plant produced and its sex. The majority of gynomonoecious individuals showed a low proportion of female flowers but all proportions were found. Female flowers of these individuals were well-developed flowers that set fruit as often as female flowers on <b>pure</b> females. The <b>percentage</b> fruit set was characteristic of the type of flowers (around 56 % for perfect flowers and 76 % for female flowers) whatever the sex of the individual plant. The determination of sex is not known but data indicate that environmental conditions could be responsible for a shift between the hermaphrodite and the gynomonoecious states rather than between the female and the gynomonoecious states...|$|R
40|$|We have synthesized, in this work, {{zero valent}} iron (ZVI) {{nanoparticles}} {{to improve the}} efficiency of degradation of phenolphthalein catalyzed by ozone in aqueous solution. The Fe nanoparticles were obtained using the pulsed plasma in liquid (PPL) method with water as the liquid medium. Such nanoparticles have a mean size of 12 [*]nm and are composed of ~ 80 % Fe 0, while the rest are a mixture of Fe+ 2 and Fe+ 3 oxides. The degradation of phenolphthalein was carried on a glass reactor injecting a constant amount of ozone and introducing different concentrations of Fe nanoparticles to the system. When using <b>pure</b> ozone, the <b>percentage</b> of degradation of phenolphthalein measured by colorimetry after one hour of reaction was 84 %. However, when Fe nanoparticles are used, such percentage can {{be as high as}} 98 % in 50 minutes of reaction. Furthermore, the degradation rate constant was 0. 0334 [*]min− 1 with only ozone and it can be as high as 0. 0733 [*]min− 1 with Fe nanoparticles. Finally, the total mineralization of phenolphthalein was obtained by total organic carbon (TOC) determinations.

40|$|Nitrogen {{has been}} {{considered}} as an important nutrient in the terrestrial system. In the seed production of ryegrasses, {{one of the most}} popular pastures used in New Zealand and other temperate-zone areas, the application of nitrogen is responsible for improving seed yield and seed quality. Novel fungal endophytes are also now commonly used in perennial ryegrass pasture systems. The effect of different forms of nitrogen on seed quality and endophyte infection frequency and alkaloid concentration including spikelet/floret positional effects is also of interest to researchers. This study was designed to determine the effects of three nitrogen forms and potassium treatments (six in total) on the seed quality (purity, thousand seed weight (TSW), and germination) and AR 37 endophyte presence in the offspring seedlings of the perennial ryegrass cv. Halo at three spikelet positions (top, middle and bottom). Also the effect of two nitrogen forms (nitrate and ammonium) at different floret positions was investigated. The two nitrogen forms (urea and nitrate) with potassium had a poorer seed quality compared with the control and all nitrogen treatments applied without potassium. Nitrogen application (any form by itself) did not affect TSW of ‘Halo’, but a reduction was found under urea or nitrate with potassium. Also, seed germination percentages were not affected by nitrogen type when compared with the control, but urea with potassium gave a lower germination than the three nitrogen forms alone; and nitrate with potassium was lower than just the urea treatment. In the purity test, urea applied alone had a higher <b>pure</b> seed <b>percentage</b> than the control and the other nitrogen forms applied alone, but, again, the nitrogen with potassium application had the poorest performance in the test. On the other hand, none of these seed quality parameters differed among the three spikelet positions (top, middle and bottom). Both nitrogen and potassium application and different spikelet positions did not affect endophyte content in the offspring seedlings of ‘Halo’. In the minor experiment, where seven floret positions and only two nitrogen forms (ammonium (NH 4 +) and nitrate (NO 3 -)) were compared, the individual seed weights of Halo in florets 3, 4, and 7 under nitrate application were higher than that under ammonium. The seed weight in floret 7 wasthe only position lower than floret 1 and 2 when ammonium was applied. The germination percentages were not affected by the two nitrogen forms, nor were different floret positions. Further, nitrogen application also did not alter empty seed percentages (in frequency), but the basal florets produced less empty seeds. Differences in endophyte content between ammonium and nitrate applications were found only in floret position 1 where nitrate reduced endophyte. Also amongst florets under nitrate there was higher endophyte content in floret positions 2, 4 and 7...|$|R
40|$|The {{interest}} in hemp (Canapa Sativa L.) {{in the last}} decade is greatly increased for its multiplicity of uses: food; textile industry; cosmetics and biochemical. In addition, hemp seed oil is a great source of high quality nutrients and has multi-purpose natural remedies and It could be used as edible oil containing about 80 % of essential fatty acids (excellent ratio of omega- 6 to omega- 3). The aim of this study was the optimization of hemp seeds oil mechanical extraction parameters {{in order to have a}} higher oil yield. The hemp variety was Futura 75, cultivated in Castelvolturno (CE), Southern Italy. Harvest has been carried out in September 2016 with a mechanical harvester. The test has been carried out using a mechanical screw press, powered by 2. 2 kW electric motor, using an 8 mm nozzle. The variable parameters were: temperature of extraction (50 °C and 70 °C), measured with a temperature sensor placed on press head; two rotational screw speeds (22 rpm and 32 rpm) and seeds pre-treatment (heated at 50 °C for 1 h in a laboratory oven and not heated). The processed samples weighted 1000 g each. After the extraction, oil was centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 20 minutes with an laboratory centrifuge to determine the yield of <b>pure</b> oil as <b>percentage</b> of extracted oil (g) on the total oil extractable basis. During the tests, the performances of the press has been monitored: initial and final extraction temperatures have been recorded with a RTD (Pt 100) temperature sensor; extraction time has been recorded with a laboratory stopwatch. Results show that the combination of high extraction temperature and slow rotational screw speed has a positive effect on oil yield as well as seeds pre-treatment. Further studies are scheduled in order to evaluate the effect of extraction parameters on oil quality in terms of acidity, sensory profile, volatile compounds and fatty acids composition...|$|R
40|$|O objetivo deste experimento foi avaliar os componentes da produção de sementes, a produtividade de sementes aparentes e puras e a qualidade de sementes do capim-mombaça (Panicum maximum, Jacq. cv. Mombaça), adubado com quatro doses de nitrogênio (0, 50, 100 e 150 kg ha- 1). O delineamento {{experimental}} foi em blocos ao acaso, com quatro repetições. As variáveis analisadas foram os números de perfilhos vegetativos e com panículas, números de sementes por panícula e por área, índice de colheita, massa de mil sementes puras e a germinação de sementes. Houve efeito linear da dose de nitrogênio sobre o número de perfilhos com panículas, nos números de sementes aparentes e puras por panícula e por área, nas produtividades de sementes aparentes, puras e puras viáveis e sobre o índice de colheita. Na maior dose de N aplicada, a produtividade de sementes aparentes foi de 73 kg ha- 1 e de sementes puras igual a 34 kg ha- 1. Correlações significativas foram obtidas entre produtividade de sementes aparentes e puras, com a massa de perfilho com panícula, número de perfilhos com panícula, número de sementes aparentes e puras, por panícula e por área, com a matéria seca ha- 1 e com o índice de colheita. A massa de mil sementes puras e a germinação de sementes não foi influenciada pela adubação nitrogenada. The {{objective of}} this experiment was to evaluate the influence of nitrogen doses on seed production {{and quality of the}} Mombaça grass (Panicum maximum, Jacq. cv. Mombaça). The nitrogen doses were 0, 50, 100 and 150 kg ha- 1, in a completely randomized block design with four replications. The variables evaluated were the number of vegetative and fertile tillers, the number of apparent and pure seeds per panicle and area, the harvesting index, the weight of one thousand pure seeds, and the percentage of seed germination. Linear effects were observed with the nitrogen doses on the number of fertile tillers, number of apparent and pure seeds per panicle and area, harvest index, apparent and pure seed yields, and the viability of the pure seeds. At the highest dose of N applied, the apparent seed yield was 72. 6 kg ha- 1 and pure seed yield was 34. 3 kg ha- 1. Apparent and pure seed yields were highly correlated to the number of fertile tillers and their individual mass, number of apparent and pure seeds per panicle and area, dry matter ha- 1 and harvest index.
