25|$|The {{share is}} {{the cutting edge}} of the {{moldboard}} plow. The share makes the horizontal cut that separates the furrow slice from the soil below and when it is worn it is important to fit a new one. Conventional shares have points that are shaped. This shape, which was developed through years of field experience, penetrates ordinary soil efficiently and stands rough use. The share is shaped so that it pulls itself into the ground. As the share wears away, it becomes blunt and the plough will require more power to pull it through the soil. A <b>plough</b> <b>body</b> with a worn share will not have enough 'suck' to ensure that it penetrates the ground to its full working depth. The tip of the share is pointed downward, causing the plow to run into the ground. This is called “suction or down suck”; it literally sucks the plow into the ground, to a regulated depth. The clearance, also usually referred to as “suction or down suck”, varies with different makes and types of plows (the related clearance at the side is called “land suck”). Its configuration is related to soil type, particularly in the down suction, or concavity, of its lower surface. Generally, three degrees of clearance or down suction are recognized: regular for light soil, deep for ordinary dry soil, and double-deep for clay and gravelly soils. In addition, the share has horizontal suction, which is related to the amount its point is bent out of line with the landside. Down suction causes the plow to penetrate to proper depth when pulled forward, while horizontal suction causes the plow to create the desired width of furrow. The share is a plane part with trapezoidal shape. It cuts the soil horizontally and lifts it. Common types are regular, winged-plane, bar-point, and share with mounted or welded point. The regular share conserves a good cut but is recommended on stone-free soils. The winged-plane share is used on heavy soil with a moderate amount of stones. The bar-point share can be used in extreme conditions (hard and stony soils). The use of the share with mounted point is somewhere between the last two types. Manufacturers have designed shares of various shapes (trapezium, diamond, etc.) with bolted point and wings, often separately renewable. Sometimes the share cutting edge is placed well in advance of the moldboard to reduce the pulverizing action of the soil.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{comprises}} tribological {{studies of}} extremely well-defined surfaces of different designs. Both low-friction and high-friction surfaces were manufactured and experimentally evaluated. In the low-friction studies, lithography and anisotropic etching of silicon {{was first used}} as a texturing technique. The textured surfaces were subsequently PVD coated with TiN or DLC to achieve tribologically relevant interfaces. The results showed that under starved lubricated conditions, fine surface textures lowered the coefficient of friction and the wear rate. It was shown that also {{the orientation of the}} texture is of major importance for the lubricating function. Further, a novel embossing technique was developed, permitting texturing of steel and other materials. A micro mechanically designed diamond tool was used to emboss steel surfaces. The roller/piston contact from a hydraulic motor was simulated and introduction of an embossed texture on the piston decreased the level and the fluctuation of the friction. The effect of the texture was here similar to the effect of an additional polish step. However, in general it is not an easy task to substantially improve a boundary lubricated contact by introducing a texture. Studies of high friction surfaces were performed on micro mechanically designed diamond surfaces equipped with sharp pyramids or ridges. Just as theory predicts, the coefficient of friction was dependent on the shape of the <b>ploughing</b> <b>bodies,</b> but not on the counter material or the load. The tested surfaces resulted in static coefficients of friction between 1. 1 and 1. 6, depending on surface design and orientation. These are extremely high values, and therefore very interesting for practical applications requiring a high static friction. Conclusively, the present thesis shows {{that it is possible to}} design and produce surfaces both for improved lubrication in sliding contact and for substantially improved high friction performance in static contacts...|$|R
50|$|Sonnet 2 is also {{a working}} of the {{standard}} ‘siege’ conceit found in many sonnets. Forty winters will “digge deep trenches;” trenches were dug during sieges. Trenches are formed also when a field is ploughed, and metaphorically are wrinkles etched in a brow. The image was traditional from classical times, from Virgil (‘he ploughs the brow with furrows’) and Ovid (‘furrows which may <b>plough</b> your <b>body</b> will come already’) to Shakespeare’s contemporary, Drayton, “The time-plow’d furrowes in thy fairest field.” The primary meaning of “field” is a battlefield where a siege might occur, but it retains its agricultural or husbandry sense, taken up later in “weed,” and {{is also a}}n heraldic term for the surface of an escutcheon or shield, on which a “charge” is imposed. The colours of a servant’s “liuery” were those of an armorial shield’s field and principal charge, so the royal liuery is scarlet trimmed with gold.|$|R

On September 26, 1915, French military authorities declared that Jules had probably been killed in the battle.

However, it was a different person — Jules Paul Ricœur (1887–1918) — who held that position. Paul's father's death occurred when Paul was only two years old. Subsequently, Paul was raised in Rennes, France by his paternal grandparents Louis Ricœur (1856–1932) and his wife Marie Sarradet (1856–1928), and by his father's sister Juliette [...] "Adèle" [...] Ricœur (December 20, 1892 - 1968), with a small stipend afforded to Paul as a war orphan.|$|R

5000|$|Efforts to {{ascertain}} the true rate of solar rotation had been continually baffled by what were called the ‘proper motions’ of the spots serving as indexes to it. Carrington showed that these were in reality due to a great ‘bodily drift’ of the photosphere, diminishing apparently from the equator to the poles (ib. xix. 81). There was, then, no single period ascertainable through observations of the solar surface. By equatorial spots the circuit {{was found to be}} performed in {{about two and a half}} days less than by spots at the (ordinarily) extreme north and south limits of 45°. The assumed ‘mean period’ of 25.38 solar days applied, in fact, only to two zones 14° from the equator; nearer to it the time of rotation was shorter, further from it longer, than the average. Carrington succeeded in representing the daily movement of a spot in any heliographical latitude l, by the empirical expression 865′ ± 165 [...] sin 7/4 (l - 1°). But he attempted no explanation of the phenomenon. It formed, however, the basis of Faye's theory (1865) of the sun as a gaseous <b>body</b> <b>ploughed</b> through by vertical currents, which finally superseded Herschel's idea of a flame-enveloped, but cool, dark, and even habitable globe.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{mechanisms}} {{that lead to}} pole tip recession (PTR) in laminated magnetic recording heads (also known as "sandwich heads"). These heads provide a platform for the utilisation of advanced soft magnetic thin films in practical recording heads suitable for high frequency helical scan tape recording systems. PTR results from a differential wear of the magnetic pole piece from the tape-bearing surface of the head. It results in a spacing loss of the playback or read signal of 54. 6 dB per recording wavelength separation of the poles from the tape. PTR depends on the material combination used in the head, on the tape type and the climate - temperature and relative humidity (r. h.). Five head materials were studied: two non-magnetic substrate materials- sintered multi granular CaTi 03 and composite CaTi 03 /ZrTi 04 /Ti 02 and three soft magnetic materials- amorphous CoNbZr, and nanocrystalline FeNbSiN and FeTaN. Single material dummy heads were constructed and their wear rates measured when cycling them in a Hi- 8 camcorder against commercially available metal particulate (MP) and metal evaporated (ME) tapes in three different climates: 25 °C/ 20 %r. h., 25 °C/ 80 %r. h. and 40 °C/ 80 %r. h. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) {{was used to examine}} changes the head surface chemistry. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to examine changes in head and tape surface topography. PTR versus cycling time of laminated heads of CaTi 03 /ZrTiO 4 /Ti 02 and FeTaN construction was measured using AFM. The principal wear mechanism observed for all head materials was microabrasion caused by the mating body - the tape surface. The variation in wear rate with climate and tape type was due to a variation in severity in this mechanism, except for tape cycling at 40 °C in which gross damage was observed to be occurring to the head surface. Two subsidiary wear mechanisms were found: third body scratching (all materials) and grain pullout (both ceramics and FeNbSiN). No chemical wear was observed, though tribochemical reactions were observed on the metal head surfaces. PTR was found to be caused by two mechanisms - the first differential microabrasion of the metal and substrate materials and which was characterised by a low (~ 10 nm) equilibrium value. The second was by deep <b>ploughing</b> by third <b>body</b> debris particles, thought mainly to be grain pullout particles. This level of PTR caused by this mechanism was often more severe, and of a non-equilibrium nature. It was observed more for ME tape, especially at 40 °C/ 80 %r. h. and 25 °c/ 20 %r. h. Two other phenomena on the laminated head pole piece were observed and commented upon: staining and ripple texturing...|$|R

40|$|Summary. The main {{parameters}} of a <b>plough</b> <b>body</b> that determine the ploughing efficiency are the initial and final soil strip lifting angles on the share-mouldboard surface, the angles of its horizon-tal generatrix, the radius of this {{surface and the}} working width of the body.

40|$|The {{specific}} {{resistance of the}} <b>plough</b> <b>body</b> (a quotient of its working resistance and furrow cross section) depends on three factors: soil conditions, working speed and <b>plough</b> <b>body</b> shape. The last dependence has not been previously defined ana-lytically. A novel method is being presented in this publication, which allows us to define and calculate the parameters of a <b>plough</b> <b>body</b> influencing its {{specific resistance}}, {{as well as the}} relationship between these parameters and specific resistance of different plough bodies. The proposed equation includes also soil conditions and working speed. The calculated parame-ters are based on the dimensions taken from drawing of a <b>plough</b> <b>body</b> working surface through the soil. The knowledge of such a relationship should be very useful in the design of new plough bodies and improvement of existing ones. The depend-ence between defined parameters and specific resistance has been calculated with statistical methods on the basis of field-and laboratory investigations of plough bodies with different working surface shapes. The scope of this investigation covers the cylindroidal, semihelicoidal and helicoidal plough bodies, their working speeds in the range of 0. 81 – 2. 5 m/s, and soil compactness measured with a cone penetrometer in the range of 1. 35 – 1. 93 MPa (in field investigations). The introduced relationship has been verified for another 10 ploughs during field investigations, conducted in different soil conditions, at different working speeds...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The main {{parameters}} of the <b>plough</b> <b>body</b> that determine the ploughing efficiency are the initial and the final soil slice lifting angles on the share-mouldboard surface, the angle of its horizontal generatrix, the radius of this surface and the working width of the body. Studies {{have been carried out}} to determine the share-mouldboard {{parameters of}} some contemporary plough bodies: the cultural (digger), semi-helicoidal and helicoidal types. For this purpose profilograms of its share-mouldboard surfaces are made and the values of the investigated parameters measured. The energetic, agronomic and economic characteristics of ploughs were estimated by their testing. As the result of investigations, it was discovered that the optimal values of the main {{parameters of the}} bottoms for contemporary ploughs are: the inclination angle of the share towards the furrow bottom – 28 … 32 ˚; the inclination angle of the horizontal generatrix towards the furrow wall on the initial part of the share-mouldboard surface – 34 … 38 ˚, on the top- not less than 48 ˚; the working width of the bottom – 45 … 50 cm. The conducted investigations show that only those ploughs generally meet the requirements mentioned above which have bodies with gently sloping semi-helicoidal or helicoidal share-mouldboard surfaces, such as the Kverneland <b>plough</b> <b>body</b> No. 8. The use of bodies having optimal parameters allows attaining good ploughing quality, reducing the draft resistance by 12 … 20 % and raising correspondingly the efficiency, saving fuel and financial resources for ploughing.

40|$|Abstract. Ploughing {{is one of}} {{the most}} power {{consuming}} and expensive processes in agricultural production. It is known that the draft resistance of ploughs, the energy requirement for ploughing, the quality of ploughing and expenses depend on the <b>plough</b> <b>body</b> design, which is determined by the share-mouldboard parameters and the parameters of its supporting surfaces, as well as on such soil properties as its hardness, density, friction and adhesion, values of which are depending on soil mechanical composition, structure and humidity. Studies are carried out to determine the impact of the soil humidity on the ploughing resistance of the main soil types: sandy soil, loam and clay soils. It was cleared up that humidity most of all impacts the soil hardness and cutting resistance which considerably dominates in the summary resistance of the <b>plough</b> <b>body.</b> Increase in the soil humidity leads to decrease in the ploughing resistance that is more remarkable on clay soils. The working speed of the plough influences also the ploughing resistance. The optimum humidity of sticky clay soils when ploughing at the speed 2 … 2. 5 m s- 1 is 18 … 22 %.

These correlations allow to determine the draft resistance of the plough depending on the parameters of its body, as well as to evaluate the impact of the physical and mechanical properties of soil, such as friction upon it. The greatest influence upon the draft resistance is exerted by soil hardness, density and slip resistance along the surfaces of the operating parts. The latter is also affected by soil adhesion, which particularly manifests itself in wet clay soils at lower temperatures. It has been clarified that the friction resistance constitutes 46 – 62 % of the total draft resistance of the <b>plough</b> <b>body.</b> The main ways of lowering the friction resistance and the total draft resistance of the plough are the introduction of a more rational design of its body having optimum parameters, decreasing the resistance of the share-mouldboard surface and the values of reactions of the supporting surfaces, as well as the application of antifriction materials and better modes of joining with tractors...|$|E

In the latest years investigations are carried out in directions: yield and weedy monitoring; monitoring of soil properties and its changes; ecological grain drying with microclimate monitoring and distance control; impact of the <b>plough</b> <b>body</b> parameters on the ploughing efficiency, criteria determination for efficiency estimation of agricultural machinery in field crop cultivation; impact of the soil humidity on the ploughing resistance. The use of computerised ventilated bins for drying and storing grain is purposeful in the organisational, {{as well as economical}} and ecological aspects. It facilitates the farmer to organise the harvesting process, to use favourable weather conditions to a full extent, to obtain a higher-quality product and sell it on more profitable terms. Minimum fuel consumption and costs can be achieved by aggregates completed with efficient up-to-date tractors and tillage machines that are suitable for local conditions and have optimal design and applications parameters, improving the tractor loading and aggregation patterns.
