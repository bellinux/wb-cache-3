25|$|In {{this part}} of the country, snake is named Bhujang, which is also the Sanskrit name for snake, in the Kutch region. The name is {{attributed}} to the city of Bhuj which is located below the hill named Bhujiya, after Bhujang, as it was the abode of snakes. On top of this hill there is a fort known as the Bhujia Fort where a temple has been built for the snake god and a second temple is {{at the foot of the}} hill known as Nani Devi. Bhujia Fort was the scene of a major battle between Deshalji I, the ruler of Kutch and Sher Buland Khan, Mughal Viceroy of Gujarat who had invaded Kutch. It was the early period of Deshalji's reign. When the army of Kutch was in a state of losing the battle, a group of Naga Bawas opened the gate of Bhujia Fort by a clever ploy of visiting Nag temple for worship and joined the fray against Sher Buland Khan's army. Eventually Deshalji I won the battle. Since that day Naga Bawa and their leader have a <b>pride</b> <b>of</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> the procession held on Nag Panchami day. Within the fort, at one corner, there is a small square tower dedicated to Bhujang Nag (snake god), who in folklore is said to have been the brother of Sheshnag. It is said Bhujang Nag came from Than of Kathiawar and freed Kutch from the oppression of demons known as daityas and rakshasas. The Snake Temple was also built at the time of the fortification of the hill during Deshalji I's reign and provided with a chhatri. Every year on Nag Panchami day a fair is held at the temple premises. In the Sindhi community Nag Panchami is celebrated in honour of Gogro.|$|E

500|$|Bharatadesa Vaibhava is {{a version}} of the earlier Poorvapurana by Jinasenacharya and {{reflects}} a different perspective than the Adipurana written by Adikavi Pampa c.941. Centred on the glorification of the enlightened Bharata, the son of the first Jain tirthankar Adinatha, Ratnakaravarni cleverly focuses on those aspects that the original by Pampa ignored. Ratnakaravarni goes into minute detail about prince Bharata who, according to the author, serves as the ideal balance between detachment (yoga) and attachment (bhoga). Though married to [...] "96,000 women", Bharata is depicted as one who at once could separate himself from worldly pleasures. Unlike Pampa, who focused on the conflict between the brothers Bahubali and Bharata, ending with Bahubali's asceticism and Bharata's humiliation, Ratnakaravarni's eulogy of Bharata leaves room only for Bahubali's evolution towards sainthood. Eventually, Bharata attains moksha (liberation from the cycle of death and rebirth) by burning himself in ascetic fire. The author showers encomium on Bharata in his various roles as monarch, husband, son, friend and devotee, a rare description of a [...] "perfect human being" [...] among Jain writings. Since details of the early life of Bharata as a young ruler did not exist in previous writings or in tradition, much of Ratnakaravarni's vivid description of that period was a product of his imagination. This work finds its <b>pride</b> <b>of</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> Kannada's epic poetry as the longest poem in the folk sangatya metre.|$|E

40|$|As can {{be gleaned}} {{even from a}} quick glance at the index of Merkelbach and West, the most {{important}} Byzantine sources transmitting fragments of Hesiod's "minor" works are John Tzetzes and Eustathius of Thessalonike. Both were active in the 12 th century under the Komnenian dynasty, in an age when Homer and the archaic epic <b>in</b> general enjoyed <b>pride</b> <b>of</b> <b>place</b> both <b>in</b> the school curriculum and in scholarly works. Our paper aims at singling out some significant instances of quotations from the Catalogue or other lost works in Eustathius' commentaries to the Iliad and Odyssey, and in Tzetzes' commentaries to Homer, Lycophron, etc. The stress will be laid not only on those few fragments that are known exclusively thanks to these authors, and to the plausibility that they derive from one lost ancient source or another (most notably frr. 211, 276 and 330 for Tzetzes and frr. 62, 164, 212 a, 221 and 223, as well as a line in fr. 204 for Eustathius: frr. 211 and 204 are known to us from papyri), but also on the different angle from which the fragmentary evidence about Hesiod's works is considered: while both scholars are clearly primarily interested in grammatical and erudite aspects, their bias differs in part. This is particularly evident when the same fragment is quoted by both authors (generally, it has to be assumed, from the same source {{as in the case of}} frr. 194 and 235), but much can be gleaned also from a more general consideration of the attitude towards titles and attributions in both authors (and from a more attentive perusal of their works in search of mentions that might have escaped the editors' notice) : while Eustathius seems more carefully adherent to his sources, Tzetzes' habitual creativity, and his perusal of ancient biographies, leads him to posit the existence of lost works, probably on the background of an overall consideration of Hesiodic poetic output...|$|R
40|$|Stein Ringen’s {{theory of}} {{democratic}} purpose cannot {{do the work}} expected of it. Ringen’s own criteria oscillate between being too vague to be useful (i. e. “freedom”) or, when specified more fully, conflicting, so that almost all democracies will seem to be potentially at cross-purposes with themselves rather than their purposes or sub-purposes being mutually reinforcing. This reflects a bigger and more theoretical problem. Disagreement about the purpose of democracy is built into democracy itself. The whole point of many (perhaps all) of our democratic institutions is to arrive at conditionally legitimate decisions in spite of such disagreement. So-called regime bias, i. e. the tendency to assess democracies according to the form and stability of their institutions rather than their results or their ability to serve certain purposes, does not in fact arise from bias. It arises on the contrary from a determination to avoid the bias inherent in giving some—inevitably partisan—ideals of what democracies should do <b>pride</b> <b>of</b> <b>place</b> over others <b>in</b> a scheme of measurement or evaluation. And even a regime-based definition of democracy must itself make simplifying assumptions that elide possible normative controversies over how the democratic game is best played. Vindicating one’s preferred set of democratic ideals against alternatives is a completely legitimate enterprise and lends richness to debates within and across democracies. But it is an inherently ideological and political enterprise, not a neutral or scholarly one...|$|R

Singapore's constitutional history was markedly different from that of other Commonwealth countries, and its Constitution does not contain express prohibitions against cruel and inhuman punishments as it is not modelled upon the European Convention on Human Rights. In addition, in 1966 the Wee Chong Jin Constitutional Commission specifically considered whether to include a constitutional provision against inhuman punishment.

40|$|ABSTRACT—This {{experiment}} {{examined the}} ability <b>of</b> <b>pride</b> {{to serve as}} an adaptive emotion within the context of social interaction. After an in vivo induction <b>of</b> <b>pride</b> or a neutral state, participants engaged in a group problem-solving task. In contrast to a conventional view that pride is often associated with negative interpersonal outcomes, results confirmed that proud individuals not only took on a dom-inant role within the group problem-solving task, but also were perceived as the most likeable interaction partners. These findings suggest that pride, when representing an appropriate response to actual performance (as opposed to overgeneralized hubris), constitutes a functional social emotion with important implications for leadership and the building of social capital. Views <b>of</b> <b>pride,</b> unlike the majority of emotions, demonstrate a Janus-faced quality both through time and across cultures, from, for example, Dante’s Divine Comedy to Shakespeare’s Troilus and Cressida (Lewis, 2000; Tracy & Robins, 2007 a, 2007 b). Unlike love, which is universally admired, or jealousy, which is universally reviled, pride has been alternately viewed as both virtue and vice, noble characteristic and deadly sin. The ques-tion <b>of</b> <b>pride’s</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> the emotion arsenal thus becomes an intriguing one. Does it engender greater stature or, as suggested by Emily Bronte ̈ in Wuthering Heights, lead to the breeding of sad sorrows? In considering this issue, many researchers have suggested that, although pride holds a somewhat negative connotation in American culture, 1 it may possess a dual nature and, given certain contingencies, can be beneficial (Fredrickson & Bran-igan, 2001; Tracy &Robins, 2007 a;Williams&DeSteno, 2008). The pivotal factor appears to be whether pride stems from objective successes (i. e., authentic, or beta, pride) or from a generalized overly positive assessment of self-worth (i. e. ...|$|R
