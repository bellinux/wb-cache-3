40|$|Screening is a {{well-known}} classification process in the minerals processing industry. The process involves separation of fine particles from coarse particles based on size and is applicable to both dry and fine screening. Fine screening is normally carried out wet. Until recently, fine <b>wet</b> <b>screening</b> had been limited to relatively low throughput applications. Developments {{in the recent past}} have seen the evolution of fine screening to high capacity applications. It has found application in operations such as closed circuits with a mill in place of hydrocyclones. However, even though developments are increasing, there has been a process model developmental lag. A fine <b>wet</b> <b>screen</b> model {{that can be used for}} unit simulation purposes to predict screen performance outcomes or integration into other models to simulate and predict process performance is necessary. Most existing screen models are for dry and coarse screening applications. This thesis is aimed at developing a fine <b>wet</b> <b>screen</b> process model for predicting <b>wet</b> <b>screening</b> performance in the 45 - 150 μm range.

40|$|WSU Vancouver Honors Thesis. Types and {{quantities}} of material evidence collected from archaeological sites are primary {{sources of information}} for archaeologists to base interpretations and provide evidence to answer posed research questions. Artifact collection rates depend on the collection and screening methods used. Screening methods that use smaller mesh screens tend to result in greater {{quantities of}} artifacts collected and greater quantities create increased opportunities for rare or underrepresented artifacts to be collected. This study used domestic materials, beads, ceramics and glass, collected during excavations in the Village area of the Fort Vancouver National Historic Site during the 2013 Public Archaeology Field School. The benefits of <b>wet</b> <b>screening</b> using 1 mm mesh screens were examined in comparison with dry screening assemblages collected using a nested ¼ in. mesh screen inside of a 1 / 8 in. mesh screen. Measures for artifact density supported the hypothesis that <b>wet</b> <b>screening</b> did produce greater densities of the domestic materials examined. However, multiple diversity indices {{did not support the}} hypothesis that <b>wet</b> <b>screening</b> samples would be more diverse than samples collected using dry screening. Overall, the evidence supports the use of small mesh screening methods when applicable to the proposed research question...|$|R

40|$|The {{treatment}} of coarse particles was approached from two perspectives. A techno-economic study had {{to reveal the}} potential of a Derrick 5 -deck Stack Sizer in a flotation circuit. This fine <b>wet</b> <b>screening</b> technology has a high capital expenditure. This is a disadvantage since investors try to suppress the capital costs in {{an early stage of}} the project. However, the increased separation efficiency reduces circulating loads and thus operating costs. Cashflows for a time period longer than a year showed potential. The second perspective was a literature review followed by practical work. It had to reveal and prove the behaviour of coarse particles in laboratory batch flotation tests. Flotation experiments with fixed parameters and operating at low froth bed thickness were conducted. Different particle size distributions of a porphyry copper ore were tested. Different behaviour for different particle size fractions was observed. Mineral liberation data indicated the availability of liberated, binary and ternary chalcopyrite in the concentrate. The liberation of chalcopyrite indicates the optimum aperture size for fine <b>wet</b> <b>screens.</b> Low froth bed thickness increased the recovery of fines caused by entrainment.

50|$|Screening can {{be carried}} out in dry or <b>wet</b> basis. <b>Wet</b> <b>screening</b> often {{requires}} post treatment, drying as a preparation for the downstream process. In most cases, drying is often used in the final stage of the process, however this can be varied due to the need of the process.

50|$|It is {{an improvised}} {{technique}} {{to the other}} screening techniques in which product on the screen is moved from the centre by radial inclination while the tangential inclination leads to circular motion of the product. Thus tumbler screening provides 99% screening efficiency with gentle screening of delicate particles to prevent particle destruction. The complicated circular three dimensional screening action is adjustable to accommodate different material characteristics and is mainly independent of the material load, improving the separation process. This technique is usually performed after crushing/milling.

The literature studyincluded {{an overview of the}} composition and variations of MSWI bottom ash, the factorsinfluencing the bottom ash quality and the usual processing practices. In the experimental part a bottom ash sample was first characterized. Characterization wasimportant with regard to the mechanical processing of bottom ash, because it gave a goodoverview of bulk properties and the distribution of mechanically separable metals indifferent particle size classes. The experimental process flowsheet designed was based onthe literature study and the bottom ash characterization. The process developed included <b>wet</b> <b>screening</b> of the bottom ash into three particle sizeclasses: + 6. 25 mm (Coarse), 0. 18 - 6. 25 mm (Medium) and sludge of 0 - 0. 18 mm (Fines). <b>Wet</b> <b>screening</b> proved an efficient way for washing the small fraction to the underflow. The Fines product was 32 w-% of the total dry output. It was delivered for treatebility teststo Salvor Oy. The Coarse and Medium products were processed with magnetic and eddy currentseparators and the performance of the processes were assessed. The Coarse and Mediummagnetic products were both 7 w-% of total dry output. Recovery of iron from bottom ashwas possible with good recovery. From the Coarse fraction 87 % of iron was recovered ata grade of 25 % and from the Medium fraction 71 % of iron was recovered at a grade of 20 %. In addition, magnetic separation step remover environmentally harmful elementsfrom bottom ash, such as Sn, Ni, Zn and Cu, possibly improving bottom ash’senvironmental quality at the same time. The amount of coarse nonmagnetic metal productwas 3 w-% of total dry output. For particles larger than 6. 25 mm also the recovery ofnonferrous metals is possible by traditional eddy current separation. The recovery wasgood (85 % for grey nonmagnetic metals and 90 % for red nonferrous metals) with metalgrade of around 55 %. The tested nonferrous metals separation steps, eddy currentseparator and pneumatic shaking table for Medium fraction did not work. The results showed that for many environmentally harmful elements the concentration inFines higher than for the produced Granulate products.

40|$|Mineral {{processing}} is {{the process}} that involves liberation and beneficiation of valuable constituents of an ore. Several physical beneficiation processes exist and one such process is classification. Screens are classification devices sometimes used in the classification stage of closed grinding circuits to separate mill product into different size classes. Poor classification of particles results in reduced throughput, high power consumption and over - grinding. Most {{of the research on}} screening has been done in scalping applications or classification at relatively large cut sizes. There is limited work done on screening at feed sizes of minus 150 μm and there are no robust models for <b>wet</b> fine <b>screening</b> application for use in circuit simulation studies. The effect of feed flow rate, solids concentration and aperture size on <b>wet</b> fine <b>screening</b> performance was evaluated in this study. The range of values of the factors investigated were the feed rate (9, 13, 19, 25, 30 and 35 t/h), screen aperture size (45, 75, 106 and 150 μm) and solids content (30, 40, 50 and 60 %). A pilot Derrick screen plant at Mintek in Johannesburg was used for the experiments on a UG 2 and chromite ore blend. Screen undersize and oversize samples were collected for particle size distribution analysis and mass balance calculations. The samples collected were filtered, de - lumped and split down to masses ranging between 200 and 300 grams for <b>wet</b> <b>screening</b> using the Malvern MasterSizer particle analyser. The results were used to analyse the effect of the investigated factors on the <b>wet</b> fine <b>screening</b> performance. These results were used to develop a <b>wet</b> fine <b>screening</b> model. Results indicate that increased feed flow rate and solids concentration lead to finer cut sizes, reduced sharpness of separation and higher water recoveries to the oversize. An increase in aperture size increased the sharpness of separation and decreased the water recoveries to the oversize. The solids concentration appeared to have a higher effect on cut size than the feed flow rate. The highest cut size and sharpness of separation and lowest water recovery to oversize were attained at the lowest feed rate. The lowest solids concentration produced the best performance with regards to all partition curve properties. The cut size approached the aperture size at the lowest throughput and solids concentration for all aperture sizes. All the efficiency curves exhibited fish hooks at fine particle sizes with the fish hooks becoming more pronounced at higher feed flow rates and solids concentration and smaller aperture sizes. A <b>wet</b> fine <b>screen</b> model that includes multi component ores as well as changes in operating conditions was developed using the 2 - parameter Whiten screen model as a basis. The dimensional analysis approach was applied in developing the sub - models that relate the operating and design parameters to the Whiten model parameters. The dimensional analysis approach was further applied to develop the model that describes the fish hook effect for subsequent incorporation into the overall modified fine screen model. Generally, the modified model is capable of predicting the performance of the <b>wet</b> fine <b>screen</b> reasonably well with minor errors and accommodates for the data that exhibits the fish hook. The model also reduces the fitting process required in the original Whiten model...|$|R

Vitellogenesis occurs concurrently with gestation, with the females having both term fetuses and mature ova simultaneously. It is likely that the females have a bi-annual reproductive cycle where each female is capable of producing two broods annually. The ovulation period in the spring/summer reproductive cycle ranged from January to April (peaks in late February/early March) and parturition occurred between June to September (peaks in late July/early August). The autumn/winter reproductive cycle overlaps with the spring/summer cycle, with ovulation ranging between August to September and parturition from November to January.

40|$|JAK 2 is {{a member}} of the JAK family of protein {{tyrosine}} kinases (PTK). JAK 2 is an important intracellular mediator of cytokine signaling and its mutants are involved in haematological cancers and other chronic diseases. The specificity of inhibitors targeting the JAK 2 PTK domain, particularly over other JAK kinases, is a critical design element of clinically relevant drugs. Due to the considerable structural similarity amongst the over 500 kinases in the human genome, designing a highly specific inhibitor of just one kinase is a nontrivial task. We have performed molecular docking studies of a high-affinity pan-JAK inhibitor (tetracyclic pyridone 2 -tert-butyl- 9 -fluoro- 3, 6 -dihydro- 7 H-benz[h]-imidaz[4, 5 -f]isoquinoline- 7 -one) into a JAK 2 PTK structure using our in-house software ChemaPhore™. Lacking an X-ray structure, the studies were based initially on a homology model of JAK 2. In order to improve the specificity and potency of the inhibitors, a series of modifications to the pan-JAK inhibitor were suggested and the new compounds were then synthesized and biologically tested. The results of the structure-activity relationship (SAR) obtained from <b>wet</b> <b>screening</b> are consistent with the proposed binding mode of the pan-JAK inhibitor.

Having assumed that a water-cement ratio could be estimated from the mortar ingredient by a <b>wet</b> <b>screening,</b> fresh mortar of the water-cement ratio from 45 % to 65 % was poured to a cylindrical form. The distance between these transducers was 50 mm. The wave velocity and the frequency spectrum in the transmission wave were measured from 5 minutes to 150 minutes after mixing water and cement. These characteristics were measured for the estimation using two wide-band ultrasonic transducers, which were set on the top surface of the fresh concrete and the bottom surface of the form. As the result of that, it was confirmed that ultrasonic wave velocity in the fresh mortar depended on the water-cement ratio and changed with the age of the mortar. From a spectrum analyzing, {{it was found that the}} center frequency of the detected ultrasonic wave just after remixing had a correlation with the water-cement ratio, and it was demonstrated by experiments that this analyzing enabled the estimation of water-cement ratio even if the age of concrete was unknown...|$|R
