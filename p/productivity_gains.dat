30|$|The {{interpretation}} of (9) is quite simple. The marginal quality of local deflation (thus, the proportionality) {{is equal to}} the <b>gain</b> in <b>productivity</b> z defined in (1). Moreover, from a measurement perspective, this <b>productivity</b> <b>gain</b> must be equal to the quality-adjusted <b>productivity</b> <b>gain</b> that reflects the same local innovation. Considering the previous car paint example, with quality gain λ= 1.61 / 1 and local deflation ρ= 1, 300 / 974, (9) can be used to derive the correct quality-adjusted <b>productivity</b> <b>gain,</b> i.e., z=(1.61 / 1)/(1, 300 / 974)= 1.27.|$|R

3000|$|We {{may then}} {{consider}} the industry’s productivity using the per-yen standardized output (measured {{by the number}} of Rabbits). Suppose that we observe a very attractive car (quality level of 1.2) called Weasel, which costs 1169 Kyens. Because the ex-post standardized price of a car is 1169 / 1.2 = 974 Kyens, Weasel is Rabbit-proportionate. The <b>productivity</b> <b>gain</b> can be calculated by the ratio of reciprocals of the standardized prices for two periods, i.e., (1 / 974)/(1 / 1130)= 1.160. However, because the standardized price of a car is reduced to the standardized unit cost, we know that there have been no innovations within the car industry. A relevant measure of innovation should not change in this case. When assessing the <b>productivity</b> <b>gain</b> for only the car industry, we should eliminate any contribution from the factor inputs. In this regard, we should only consider the per-yen output change between the standardized unit cost and the standardized price, which is (1 / 974)/(1 / 974)= 1.000. We distinguish the <b>productivity</b> <b>gain</b> that reflects the local innovation of an industry (in this case, the car industry) from the ordinary <b>productivity</b> <b>gain</b> estimated via the standardized price change of the output.|$|R

25|$|On the communes, {{a number}} of radical and {{controversial}} agricultural innovations were promoted {{at the behest of}} Mao. Many of these were based on the ideas of now discredited Soviet agronomist Trofim Lysenko and his followers. The policies included close cropping, whereby seeds were sown far more densely than normal on the incorrect assumption that seeds of the same class would not compete with each other. Deep plowing (up to 2m deep) was encouraged on the mistaken belief that this would yield plants with extra large root systems. Moderately productive land was left unplanted with the belief that concentrating manure and effort on the most fertile land would lead to large per-acre <b>productivity</b> <b>gains.</b> Altogether, these untested innovations generally led to decreases in grain production rather than increases.|$|E
25|$|He {{believed}} that <b>productivity</b> <b>gains</b> that obviated certain jobs would nevertheless stimulate the larger economy and thus grow new jobs elsewhere, whether {{within the same}} corporation or in others.

Meanwhile, he believed that smart managers had an incentive to do right by their workers, because doing so would maximize their own profits. Ford did acknowledge, however, that many managers were basically too bad at managing to understand this fact. But Ford believed that eventually, if good managers such as he could fend off the attacks of misguided people from both left and right (i.e., both socialists and bad-manager reactionaries), the good managers would create a socio-economic system wherein neither bad management nor bad unions could find enough support to continue existing.|$|E

25|$|This {{reflects}} {{the idea that}} workers {{have a vested interest}} in their own well-being, and do not benefit from working above the defined rate of work when it will not increase their remuneration. He therefore proposed that the work practice that had been developed in most work environments was crafted, intentionally or unintentionally, to be very inefficient in its execution. He posited that time and motion studies combined with rational analysis and synthesis could uncover one best method for performing any particular task, and that prevailing methods were seldom equal to these best methods. Crucially, Taylor himself prominently acknowledged that if each employee's compensation was linked to their output, their productivity would go up. Thus his compensation plans usually included piece rates. In contrast, some later adopters of time and motion studies ignored this aspect and tried to get large <b>productivity</b> <b>gains</b> while passing little or no compensation gains to the workforce, which contributed to resentment against the system.|$|E

30|$|Alternatively, {{suppose that}} there is some local {{innovation}} in the car industry, and a new car called Sable enters the market (Table 1 c). A Sable costs 1300 Kyens, and its quality (MRS with respect to a Rabbit) is 1.65. The standardized price of a car is now 1300 / 1.65 = 788 Kyens per Rabbit, and Rabbit and Fox must both exit the market. Only the Sable-proportional cars can exist in the ex-post market. The <b>productivity</b> <b>gain</b> is then (1 / 788)/(1 / 1300)= 1.434 with respect to the benchmark, but obviously this number is inclusive of the contribution of the new paint, Sirius. The relevant <b>productivity</b> <b>gain</b> is (1 / 788)/(1 / 974)= 1.237, which should reflect the innovation from the Rabbit-proportional to Sable-proportional cars. We call this measure of the local innovation the quality-adjusted <b>productivity</b> <b>gain,</b> because we use standardized figures for both the input and output sides of production. Furthermore, note that this measure should reflect the outcome of the R&D in the car industry. This is how we estimate quality-adjusted productivities for different industries in this study.|$|R

2500|$|Interest in APL has {{declined}} {{from a peak}} in the mid-1980s.

Another important reason for the decline is the lack of [...] low cost, standardized and robust, compiled APL executables - usable across multiple computer hardware and OS platforms. There are several APL version permutations across various APL implementations, particularly differences between IBM's APL2 and APL2000's APL+ versions.

Much of it is implicit and ambiguous, acquired largely by functional, context-specific experience.
