5|$|Another, short {{wall was}} added in later times, <b>probably</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> reign of Theophilos, {{stretching}} from the junction {{of the land and}} sea walls to the sea itself, and pierced by the so-called Wooden Gate (Ξυλίνη πύλη, Xylinē pylē, or Ξυλόπορτα, Xyloporta). Both this wall and the gate were demolished in 1868.|$|E
5|$|It was <b>probably</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{aftermath}} of his victory (if not before) that the Thessalians appointed Philip archon of Thessaly. This was {{an appointment for}} life, and gave Philip control over all the revenues of the Thessalian Confederation, and furthermore made Philip leader of the united Thessalian army.|$|E
5|$|The Kena is {{the oldest}} of the verse Upanisads {{followed}} by probably the Katha, Isa, Svetasvatara, and Mundaka. All these Upanisads were composed <b>probably</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> last few centuries BCE.|$|E
50|$|The {{church has}} two bells, both quite small. The treble bell is very ancient and was <b>probably</b> cast <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 14th century. The tenor bell {{is not so}} old and was <b>probably</b> recast <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 17th century.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} known religious {{building on}} <b>the</b> site was <b>in</b> 1020 with {{a reference to}} a small rectangular chapel; however, a building <b>probably</b> existed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 8th century. The current building, <b>probably</b> started <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 13th century was completed in its current format by 1466.|$|R

5|$|The {{town was}} later given {{defensive}} walls, <b>probably</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 3rd century. After {{the failure of}} Roman authority {{in the first decade}} of the 5th century, the baths fell into disrepair and were eventually lost as a result of rising water levels and silting.|$|E
5|$|A {{circular}} keep was constructed, <b>probably</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late-12th century, on the castle's motte, {{along with}} two stone gatehouses and towers along the walls. The wooden buildings in the bailey were rebuilt in stone and the construction work spread up onto the inside edges of the ramparts. Some of these houses may have belonged {{to the members of}} the castle-guard, feudal knights who were granted local estates in return for helping to defend the castle.|$|E
5|$|A new keep was built, <b>probably</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 13th century. This {{took the}} form of a {{polygonal}} shell keep, with fourteen triangular buttresses supporting six foot (1.8 m) thick walls. The inner bailey was strengthened with new stone walls, 20 to 30 feet (6 to 9 m) tall on top of the earlier earth banks, the walls and keep being built of flint and rubble. The castle was manned during this period by a castle-guard system, in which lands were given out to local lords in return for their providing knights and soldiers to serve at the castle.|$|E

5|$|Administrative systems fell {{within the}} hundreds. The Bath Hundred had various names {{including}} the Hundred of LeBuri. The Bath Foreign Hundred or Forinsecum covered the area {{outside the city}} and was later combined into the Bath Forum Hundred. Wealthy merchants had no status within the hundred courts and formed guilds to gain influence. They built the first guildhall <b>probably</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 13th century. Around 1200 the first mayor was appointed.|$|E
5|$|After {{the defeat}} of the Hyksos and the reunification of Egypt under Ahmose I, the Theban rulers began to {{construct}} elaborate tombs that reflected their newfound power. The tombs of Ahmose and his son Amenhotep I (their exact location remains unknown) were <b>probably</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Seventeenth Dynasty necropolis of Dra' Abu el-Naga'. The first royal tombs in the valley were those of Amenhotep I (although this identification is also disputed), and Thutmose I, whose advisor, Ineni, notes in his tomb that he advised the king to place his tomb in the desolate valley (the identity of this actual tomb is unclear, but it is probably KV20 or KV38).|$|E
5|$|An oak made pulpit {{stands in}} front of the choir facing the nave. It {{originated}} in the north of France, <b>probably</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mid-1500s. Its French Renaissance style suggests that it was made during the reign of Henry II. The lectern is also oak and dates from the 1600s. It had been used in a church near Avranches, France, for 200 years. A private individual purchased it shortly before the confiscation of church property during the French Revolution. It changed hands several times before Hibben obtained it for the chapel.|$|E

5|$|During ancient times, Gibraltar was {{regarded}} by {{the peoples of}} the Mediterranean as a place of religious and symbolic importance. The Phoenicians were present for several centuries, apparently using Gorham's Cave as a shrine to the genius loci of the place, as did the Carthaginians and Romans after them. Excavations in the cave have shown that pottery, jewellery and Egyptian scarabs were left as offerings to the gods, <b>probably</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hope of securing safe passage through the dangerous waters of the Strait of Gibraltar.|$|E
5|$|Essai remains Cantillon's only {{surviving}} {{contribution to}} economics. It was written around 1730 and circulated widely in manuscript form, {{but was not}} published until 1755. His work was translated into Spanish by Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos, <b>probably</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late 1770s, and considered essential reading for political economy. Despite having much influence on the early development of the physiocrat and classical schools of thought, Essai was largely forgotten until its rediscovery by Jevons in the late 19th century. Cantillon was influenced by his experiences as a banker, and especially by the speculative bubble of John Law's Mississippi Company. He was also heavily influenced by prior economists, especially William Petty.|$|E
5|$|Gale {{was educated}} at St Paul's School in London, {{where his father}} was in charge from 1672 to 1697. He {{then went on to}} attend Trinity College, Cambridge, {{starting}} in 1691, earning his Bachelor of Arts in 1695 and a Master of Arts in 1698. He then became a reader at the Bodleian Library at Oxford University on 6 March 1699. Soon after this, <b>probably</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> later part of 1699, he went with Charles Montagu, then the Earl of Manchester, on a diplomatic mission to France. His father died in 1702, and Gale retired to his newly inherited estates at Scruton, Yorkshire.|$|E

5|$|In 1095, at the Council of Piacenza, Byzantine Emperor Alexios I Komnenos {{requested}} {{military aid}} from Pope Urban II, <b>probably</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{form of a}} small body of mercenary reinforcements he could direct and control. Alexios had restored the Empire's finances and authority, but he still faced a number of foreign enemies, particularly the migrating Turks who had colonised the sparsely populated areas of Anatolia. At the Council of Clermont later that year, Urban raised the issue again and preached for a Crusade. Many historians consider that Urban also hoped that aiding the Eastern Church would lead to its reunion with the Western under his leadership.|$|E
5|$|In the 1st century, {{the vast}} {{majority}} of auxiliary common soldiers were recruited from the Roman peregrine (second-class citizens). In the Julio-Claudian era, conscription of peregrini seems to have been practiced alongside voluntary recruitment, <b>probably</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of a fixed proportion of men reaching military age in each tribe being drafted. From the Flavian era onwards, the auxilia were an all-volunteer force. Although recruits as young as 14 are recorded, the majority of recruits (66%) were from the 18–23 age group.|$|E
5|$|In {{visible and}} {{near-infrared}} light, the rings have a reddish color, except the halo ring, which is neutral or blue in color. The {{size of the}} dust in the rings varies, but the cross-sectional area is greatest for nonspherical particles of radius about 15 μm in all rings except the halo. The halo ring is probably dominated by submicrometre dust. The total mass of the ring system (including unresolved parent bodies) is poorly known, but is <b>probably</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> range of 1011to 1016kg. The age of the ring system is not known, but it may have existed since the formation of Jupiter.|$|E

5|$|Only then, in April 879, did Ibn Tulun {{return to}} Egypt. Abbas fled west with his supporters, and from Barqa {{tried to take}} over Ifriqiya. Defeated by the Ifriqiyans (<b>probably</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> winter of 880–881), he retreated back east to Alexandria, where he was finally confronted and {{captured}} by Ibn Tulun's forces. After being publicly paraded seated on a mule, Ibn Tulun ordered his son to execute or mutilate his companions, who had driven him to rebel. Ibn Tulun reportedly secretly hoped that his son would refuse to do such a dishonourable act, but he agreed. Weeping, Ibn Tulun had Abbas whipped and imprisoned. He then named his second son, Khumarawayh, as his heir-apparent.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} two centuries, the castle was {{involved}} in many conflicts. It was attacked and burnt, <b>probably</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Welsh uprising of 1151, and was captured {{by the forces of}} Llywelyn the Great in 1215. John de Braose acquired the castle in 1220 and repaired it, constructing a stone curtain wall to replace the older defences. Attacked again in 1251, the castle was reinforced with a stone tower {{in the second half of}} the 13th century. It declined in importance during the late-medieval period, and by the 19th century, the castle was ruinous and overgrown with ivy.|$|E
5|$|Ranulf Flambard (c. 1060– 5 September 1128) was {{a medieval}} Norman Bishop of Durham and an {{influential}} government minister of King William Rufus of England. Ranulf {{was the son}} of a priest of Bayeux, Normandy, and his nickname Flambard means incendiary or torch-bearer, and may have referred to his personality. He started his career under King William I of England, <b>probably</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> compilation of the Domesday Book, as well as being the keeper of the king's seal. On the death of William I, Ranulf chose to serve the new king of England, William Rufus.|$|E
