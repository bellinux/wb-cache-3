5|$|According to Plutarch, an army under Parmenion {{defeated}} the Illyrian king Grabos in 356 BC, {{shortly after the}} conclusion of the siege of Potidea. Grabos then became a subject ally of Macedon. The following year, Philip seems to have defeated Ketriporis, and reduced him to the status of a subject ally, although information for this campaign is very limited. He is also presumed to have {{defeated the}} Paionians at some point during this period, although there is no explicit record of this.

5|$|After the Treaties of Tilsit of July 1807 Metternich {{saw that}} Austria's {{position}} in Europe {{was much more}} vulnerable but believed the accord between Russia and France would not last. In the meantime he found the new French Foreign Minister, Jean-Baptiste Champagny unaccommodating and struggled to negotiate a satisfactory settlement {{over the future of}} several French forts on the River Inn. Over the following months the reach of Austrian policy, and Metternich's own reputation, increased. Metternich pushed for a Russo-Austrian alliance, though Tsar Alexander was too <b>preoccupied</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> three other wars he was engaged in to commit. Over time, Metternich came to see an eventual war with France as inevitable.|$|E

Gomułka's regime reasserted itself and was saved by a combination of international and domestic factors, including the Moczar faction's inability to take over the party and state apparatus.

5|$|In 1001, Edward's relics (for he was {{considered}} a saint, although never canonized) were translated to a more prominent place within the nunnery at Shaftesbury.

King Æthelred, <b>preoccupied</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> threat of a Danish invasion, did not attend in person, but he issued a charter to the Shaftesbury nuns late in 1001 granting them lands at Bradford on Avon, which is thought to be related.

5|$|In 1906, {{after making}} 24 {{memorial}} tablets for the project, William De Morgan abandoned the ceramics business {{to become a}} novelist, and the only ceramics firm able to manufacture appropriate further tiles was Royal Doulton. Dissatisfied with Royal Doulton's designs, and <b>preoccupied</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> management of the Watts Gallery and Watts Mortuary Chapel in Compton, Surrey, Mary Watts lost interest in the project. Work to complete it was sporadic and ceased altogether in 1931 with only 53 of the planned 120 tiles in place.

5|$|The fall of Melitene profoundly {{shocked the}} Muslim world: {{for the first}} time, a major Muslim city had fallen and been {{incorporated}} into the Byzantine Empire. Kourkouas followed this success by subduing parts of the district of Samosata in 936 and razing {{the city to the}} ground. Until 938, the East remained relatively calm. Historians suggest that the Byzantines were likely <b>preoccupied</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> full pacification of Melitene, and the Arab emirates, deprived of any potential support from the Caliphate, were reluctant to provoke them.|$|E
5|$|While Athens was <b>preoccupied</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Social War (357–355 BC), PhilipII retook Amphipolis {{from them}} in 357BC and the {{following}} year recaptured Pydna and Potidaea, the latter of which he {{handed over to the}} Chalcidian League as promised in a treaty. In 356BC, he took Crenides, refounding it as Philippi, while his general Parmenion defeated the Illyrian king Grabos of the Grabaei. During the 355–354BC siege of Methone, PhilipII lost his right eye to an arrow wound, but managed to capture the city and treated the inhabitants cordially, unlike the Potidaeans, who had been enslaved.|$|E
5|$|After the Soviet–Lithuanian Peace Treaty was {{ratified}} in 1920, the Russian SFSR recognized Lithuanian {{claims to}} the Vilnius Region and continued to support them. In its responses to the 1938 ultimatum, the Soviet Union expressed concerns over Lithuania's independence and threatened to abrogate the Soviet–Polish Non-Aggression Pact of 1932. It made it clear, though, {{that it did not}} wish to be drawn into an armed conflict. This stance has been attributed to the growth of a threat from Japan; armed assistance to Lithuania would have required the Red Army to invade either Poland or Latvia and could have resulted in a war on two fronts. The Soviets urged France, a major ally of Poland at the time, to de-escalate the conflict and encourage a more moderate version of the ultimatum. France and the United Kingdom, <b>preoccupied</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Anschluss, pressured Lithuania to normalize the relationship with Poland as soon as possible.

5|$|During World War II, Kuala Lumpur was {{captured}} by the Imperial Japanese Army on 11 January 1942. Despite suffering little damage {{during the course of}} the battle, the wartime occupation of the city resulted in significant loss of lives; at least 5,000 Chinese were killed in Kuala Lumpur in just a few weeks of the occupation by Japanese forces, and thousands of Indians were sent as forced labour to work on the Burma Railway where a large number died. They occupied the city until 15 August 1945, when the commander in chief of the Japanese Seventh Area Army in Singapore and Malaysia, Seishirō Itagaki, surrendered to the British administration following the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Kuala Lumpur grew through the war, and continued after the war during the Malayan Emergency, during which Malaya was <b>preoccupied</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> communist insurgency and New Villages were established on the outskirts of the city in an attempt to control community contacts with the insurgents.|$|E
5|$|Heian {{culture and}} court life reached a peak {{early in the}} 11th century. The {{population}} of Kyoto grew to around 100,000 as the nobility became increasingly isolated at the Heian Palace in government posts and court service. Courtiers became overly refined with little to do, insulated from reality, <b>preoccupied</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> minutiae of court life, turning to artistic endeavors. Emotions were commonly expressed through the artistic use of textiles, fragrances, calligraphy, colored paper, poetry, and layering of clothing in pleasing color combinations—according to mood and season. Those who showed an inability to follow conventional aesthetics quickly lost popularity, particularly at court. Popular pastimes for Heian noblewomen—who adhered to rigid fashions of floor-length hair, whitened skin and blackened teeth—included having love affairs, writing poetry and keeping diaries. The literature that Heian court women wrote is recognized {{as some of the}} earliest and among the best literature written in the Japanese canon.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 870s, {{a major change}} {{took place in the}} Abbasid government, as the Abbasid prince al-Muwaffaq emerged as the de facto regent of the empire, sidelining his brother, Caliph al-Mu'tamid (r. 870–892). Officially, al-Muwaffaq {{controlled}} the eastern half of the Caliphate, while al-Mu'tamid's son and first heir al-Mufawwad controlled the western, with the aid of the Turkish general Musa ibn Bugha. In reality al-Muwaffaq held the actual reins of power. Al-Muwaffaq however was <b>preoccupied</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> more immediate threats to the Abbasid government presented by the rise of the Saffarids in the east and by the Zanj Rebellion in Iraq itself, as well as with keeping in check the Turkish troops and managing the internal tensions of the caliphal government. This gave Ibn Tulun the necessary space to consolidate his own position in Egypt. Ibn Tulun kept himself out of the Zanj conflict, and even refused to recognize al-Mufawwad as his suzerain, who in turn did not confirm him in his position.|$|E
