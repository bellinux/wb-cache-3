5|$|Operation Infinite Reach was the codename for American {{cruise missile}} strikes on al-Qaeda bases in Khost, Afghanistan, and the Al-Shifa {{pharmaceutical}} factory in Khartoum, Sudan, on August 20, 1998. The attacks, {{launched by the}} U.S. Navy, were ordered by President Bill Clinton in retaliation for al-Qaeda's August 7 bombings of American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, which killed 224 people (including 12 Americans) and injured over 4,000 others. Operation Infinite Reach {{was the first time}} the United States acknowledged a <b>preemptive</b> <b>strike</b> against a violent non-state actor.|$|E
5|$|In November 1941 the IJN's Combined Fleet, under Isoroku Yamamoto, {{prepared}} {{to participate in}} Japan's initiation of a formal war with the United States by conducting a <b>preemptive</b> <b>strike</b> against the United States Navy's Pacific Fleet base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. On 17 November Kaga, {{under the command of}} Captain Jisaku Okada, loaded 100 torpedoes at Saeki Bay, Hiroshima; these torpedoes were specially designed for use in the shallow waters of the Pearl Harbor anchorage. On 19 November, Kaga {{and the rest of the}} Combined Fleet's mobile strike force (Kido Butai), under Chuichi Nagumo and including six fleet carriers from the First, Second, and Fifth Carrier Divisions, assembled in Hitokappu Bay at Etorofu Island. The fleet departed Etorofu on 26 November and followed a course across the north-central Pacific to avoid commercial shipping lanes.|$|E
5|$|As winter broke on 1 March 1799, General Jean Baptiste Jourdan and his 25,000-man Army of the Danube {{crossed the}} Rhine at Kehl. The Army of the Danube met little {{resistance}} as it advanced through the Black Forest and eventually took a flanking {{position on the}} north shore of Lake Constance. Instructed to block the Austrians from access to the Swiss alpine passes, Jourdan planned to isolate the armies of the Coalition in Germany from allies in northern Italy, and prevent them from assisting one another. His was a <b>preemptive</b> <b>strike.</b> By crossing the Rhine in early March, Jourdan acted before Archduke Charles' army could be reinforced by Austria's Russian allies, who had agreed to send 60,000 seasoned soldiers and their more-seasoned commander, Generalissimo Alexander Suvorov. Furthermore, if the French held the interior passes in Switzerland, they could not only prevent the Austrians from transferring troops between northern Italy and southwestern Germany, but could use the routes to move their own forces between the two theaters.|$|E

5|$|Immediately {{after the}} attack on Pearl Harbor, the Japanese {{operations}} to invade the Philippines began. Forty-three planes bombed Tuguegarao and Baguio in the first <b>preemptive</b> <b>strike</b> in Luzon. The Japanese forces then quickly conducted a landing at Batan Island, and by December 17, General Masaharu Homma gave his estimate that {{the main component of}} the United States Air Force in the archipelago was destroyed. By January 2, Manila was under Japanese control and by January 9, Homma had cornered the remaining forces in Bataan. By April 9, the remaining of the combined Filipino-American force was forced to retire from Bataan to Corregidor. Meanwhile, Japanese invasions of Cebu (April 19) and Panay (April 20) were successful. By May 7, after the last of the Japanese attacks on Corregidor, General Jonathan M. Wainwright announced through a radio broadcast in Manila the surrender of the Philippines. Following Wainwright was General William F. Sharp, who surrendered Visayas and Mindanao on May 10.|$|E
5|$|During {{the night}} of October 5/6, Zvi Zamir went to Europe to meet {{personally}} with Ashraf Marwan, an Egyptian double agent. Marwan informed Zamir that a joint Egyptian-Syrian attack was imminent. Combined with other warnings and incidents, Marwan's warning finally convinced Zvi Zamir of the imminence of war. Eli Zeira, the director of Aman, sent a definite warning of war to the Israeli leadership at 04:30 on October 6. Aman erred when it concluded the Arabs were to attack at 18:00, an estimation in fact four hours late. Israel's Prime Minister Golda Meir met with Defence Minister Moshe Dayan and General David Elazar at 08:05 for over an hour. Meir asked both men to present their views, which were conflicting: Dayan continued to believe war was not a certainty, while Elazar believed otherwise, arguing for a preemptive air strike against Syria. Dayan also proposed a partial mobilization of reserves, while Elazar favored a mobilization of the entire Air Force, and four armored divisions, totaling around 100,000–120,000 troops. Meir concluded the meeting by stating that no <b>preemptive</b> <b>strike</b> would be launched, {{in order to ensure}} the backing of the United States, but she sided with Elazar on the issue of mobilization, and orders were issued to reservists to mobilize.|$|E
5|$|Jordan {{signed a}} {{military}} pact with Egypt just before Israel launched a <b>preemptive</b> <b>strike</b> on Egypt {{to begin the}} Six-Day War in June 1967, where Jordan and Syria joined the war. The Arab states were defeated and Jordan {{lost control of the}} West Bank to Israel. The War of Attrition with Israel followed, which included the 1968 Battle of Karameh where the combined forces of the Jordanian Armed Forces and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) repelled an Israeli attack on the Karameh camp on the Jordanian border with the West Bank. Despite the fact that the Palestinians had limited involvement against the Israeli forces, the events at Karameh gained wide recognition and acclaim in the Arab world. As a result, the time period following the battle witnessed an upsurge of support for Palestinian paramilitary elements (the fedayeen) within Jordan from other Arab countries. The fedayeen activities soon became a threat to Jordan's rule of law. In September 1970, the Jordanian army targeted the fedayeen and the resultant fighting led to the expulsion of Palestinian fighters from various PLO groups into Lebanon, in a civil war that became known as Black September.|$|E
25|$|The war {{had three}} {{distinct}} phases. In the first phase, the Boers mounted <b>preemptive</b> <b>strikes</b> into British-held territory in Natal and the Cape Colony, besieging the British garrisons of Ladysmith, Mafeking and Kimberley. The Boers then won {{a series of}} tactical victories at Colenso, Magersfontein and Spionkop.|$|R
50|$|The {{current state}} of affairs {{is that there are}} 4 major feuding powers: England, Finland, Germany, and Japan.

50|$|Similarly {{there have}} been debates in Germany whether the legacy of World War II implies that Germany's {{military}} should be confined to purely defensive measure like peacekeeping or, contrary to this, this legacy can be a justification of an active enforcement of human rights which also might involve <b>preemptive</b> <b>strikes.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Arrow program {{encountered}} {{opposition from}} the IAF, whose traditional doctrine of deterrence and use of <b>preemptive</b> <b>strikes</b> stand in sharp contrast {{with the nature of}} the missile.

40|$|This {{working paper}} {{deals with a}} highly topical issue in public {{international}} law: the legality of a <b>preemptive</b> military <b>strike</b> against Iran’s nuclear facilities. It analyses whether such a strike would violate the {{prohibition on the use}} of force, focussing in particular on the controversial issue of whether so-called ‘surgical strikes’ are covered by this prohibition. It then examines possible justifications, such as authorisation by the Security Council and self-defence. Finally, it critically evaluates alternative approaches to extend the right of self-defence, such as the Bush doctrine of <b>preemptive</b> <b>strikes,</b> that might legitimise such action. 19 / 09 / 2008 : Full text remove...|$|R

50|$|The {{recommendations}} of the report were that Israel should do anything possible to prevent an anti-Israeli coalition from being formed, and from that coalition gaining control of WMDs. It suggested Israel should retain the option of carrying out <b>preemptive</b> <b>strikes,</b> describing them as 'anticipatory self-defense'. The strikes would {{be a combination of}} air strikes and selective covert operations by ground forces at certain critical (and publicly unnamed) locations.|$|R
25|$|From 5 to 7 December, the IDF {{conducted}} Operation Assaf to {{take control}} of the Western Negev. The main assaults were spearheaded by mechanized forces, while Golani Brigade infantry covered the rear. An Egyptian counterattack was repulsed. The Egyptians planned another counterattack, but it failed after Israeli aerial reconnaissance revealed Egyptian preparations, and the Israelis launched a <b>preemptive</b> <b>strike.</b> About 100 Egyptians were killed, and 5 tanks were destroyed, with the Israelis losing 5 killed and 30 wounded.|$|E
25|$|In November 1976, Colonel Breytenbach issued {{his second}} {{deployment}} order aimed at preventing further PLAN infiltration into South West Africa. Breytenbach recognised that PLAN held the initiative, and {{he intended to}} wrest it from them with an aggressive <b>preemptive</b> <b>strike</b> strategy. Several 32 Battalion platoons, alternatively answering to the SADF command in Ovamboland or special forces headquarters, were to sweep the Yati Strip and surrounding region for PLAN camps. The minimal deployment period allocated for this operation was three months.|$|E

25|$|The Saxon and Austrian armies were {{unprepared}} for Frederick's <b>preemptive</b> <b>strike,</b> and their forces were scattered; Prussians occupied Dresden {{with little or}} no resistance from the Saxons.

The Prussians then fully occupied Saxony; after the Siege of Pirna ended later in October, the Saxon army surrendered and was forcibly incorporated into the Prussian army. Britain had been surprised by the sudden Prussian offensive but now began shipping supplies and subsidies to its new ally.|$|E
