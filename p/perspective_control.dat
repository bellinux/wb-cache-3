Further investigation suggests that important determinants of foreign business costs include factors relating to legal structure, property rights, and business regulation. ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this short paper is to {{introduce}} the special issue and outline its major themes. Design/methodology/approach – The control-resistance literatures are described, and the necessity for field-led empirical accounts is amplified, as a precursor to introducing the contributions to this special issue. Findings – Forms of control co-mingle and the old imprints the new. Theories of control, resistance, agency and consent can most usefully be expanded by engaging with empirical accounts, resisting duality, and embracing multidimensionality. Originality/value – This paper offers {{a review of the}} state of debate about control and resistance within organisation studies, and calls for field-informed accounts and fresh <b>perspectives.</b> <b>Control,</b> Employee behaviour, Management techniques, Research...|$|R

Drawing on human resource management and industrial relations literature, we test hypotheses concerning the relationship between direct and union voice arrangements and job satisfaction. This relationship represents a gap in the literature, which is important from both theoretical and practical <b>perspectives.</b> <b>Controlling</b> for a range of personal, job, and workplace characteristics, regression analyses suggest that although evidence of voice complementarity exists, direct voice appears to be the central voice arrangement underpinning employees’ job satisfaction.

30|$|In summary, we have {{described}} the quite complex mesoscale structure of Ge(001) substrates cleaned by sputtering/annealing treatments, indentifying the sputtering-induced defects and distinguishing them from polishing-induced intrinsic defects. By positively exploiting the polishing-induced defects of standard-quality commercial Ge(001) wafers, micrometer-length Ge wires can be grown without introducing any metal catalyst. The shape of the wires can be tailored by the epitaxial strain induced by subsequent Si deposition, determining a progressive transformation of the wires in SiGe faceted quantum dots. We remark that the spatial distribution of the wires (i.e., direction, spatial ordering, etc.), and therefore of the dots formed by Si overgrowth, are dictated by {{the characteristics of the}} polishing-induced trenches. As a future <b>perspective,</b> <b>controlling</b> the polishing feature will therefore enhance the spatial ordering of nanostructures.|$|R
