40|$|The Naboro {{landfill}} in Suva, {{the capital}} city of Fiji Islands, is a sanitary engineered landfill, consisting of a compacted clay <b>protective</b> <b>liner</b> and leachate collection system. The waste is selectively placed, compacted and then covered with soil. The landfill was commisioned in 2005 and is currently receiving an average of 70, 000 tonnes of waste annually. The municipal solid waste deposited in the landfill undergoes anaerobic decomposition and the methane gas generated escapes into the atmosphere, adding to the national greenhouse gas inventory. Currently there are no methane recovery and biogas utilisation technology in place or methane flaring at the Naboro landfill site. A feasibility study was carried out recently and based on the model output and field experiments, it was noted that methane recovery and utilisation could be a viable option although there could be some challenges associated with it.

40|$|High {{energy is}} {{involved}} when a rider impacts a road surface in a crash. Rider speed, {{height of fall}} and road surface morphology all contribute {{to the level of}} initial impact energy. Impact can cause fabrics and seams of protective garments to burst rendering their protective value void. The Cambridge abrasion tester tests protective clothing with a fall height of 50 mm and abrasive belt speed of 28 km/hr, far below what can happen in a “high side” motorcycle crash at 100 km/hr. This work addresses the mechanics of what occurs in the first few microseconds of an impact and provides insight into the effect that speed has on fabric burst. This work used a Cambridge impact abrasion test to evaluate two different protective motorcycle clothing fabrics (a denim and brushed fleecy fabric over a p-aramid <b>protective</b> <b>liner).</b> It measured their abrasion resistance at an abrasion speed of 28 km/hr and standard impact height. It used a high speed camera to measure the impact displacement of the test head. Fabrics with high stretch were more prone to burst failure on initial impact. Fabric burst is caused by a high speed tensile stress between the fabric coupled with the abrasion surface and the inertia of the body dragging against it. Stretch fabrics are pushed into the abrasion surface for a longer period by the body before the tensile stress occurs so the coupling force is higher. If the transition to abrasion occurs early in the impact then a fabric is less likely to burst...|$|E

40|$|A {{straightforward}} and very cost effective method is proposed to prototype electrodes using pressure sensitive adhesives (PSA) {{and a simple}} cutting technique. Two cutting methods, namely blade cutting and CO 2 laser ablation, are compared and their respective merits are discussed. The proposed method consists of turning the <b>protective</b> <b>liner</b> on the adhesive into a stencil to apply screen-printing pastes. After the electrodes have been printed, the liner is removed and the PSA {{can be used as}} a backing material for standard lateral flow membranes. We present the fabrication of band electrodes down to 250 μm wide, and their characterization using microscopy techniques and cyclic voltammetry. The prototyping approach presented here facilitates the development of new electrochemical devices even if very limited fabrication resources are available. Here we demonstrate the fabrication of a simple lateral-flow device capable of determining glucose in blood. The prototyping approach presented here is highly suitable for the development of novel electroanalytical tools.

40|$|Traditional liner systems {{consisting}} of a geosynthetic membrane underlying a waste disposal facility coupled with a leachate collection system have been proposed {{as a means of}} containing releases of low-level radioactive waste {{within the confines of the}} disposal facility and thereby eliminating migration of radionuclides into the vadose zone and groundwater. However, this type of hydraulic containment liner system is only effective as long as the leachate collection system remains functional or an overlying cover limits the total infiltration to the volumetric pore space of the disposal system. If either the leachate collection system fails, or the overlying cover becomes less effective during the 1, 000 ’s of years of facility lifetime, the liner may fill with water and release contaminated water in a preferential or focused manner. If the height of the liner extends above the waste, the waste will become submerged which could increase the release rate and concentration of the leachate. If the liner extends near land surface, there is the potential for contamination reaching land surface creating a direct exposure pathway. Alternative <b>protective</b> <b>liner</b> systems can be engineered that eliminate radionuclide releases to the vadose zone during operations and minimizing long term migration of radionuclides from the disposal facility into the vadose zone and aquifer. Non-traditional systems include waste containerization in steel or composite materials. This type of system would promote drainage of clean infiltrating water through the facility without contacting the waste. Other alternatives include geochemical barriers designed to transmit water while adsorbing radionuclides beneath the facility. Facility performance for a hypothetical disposal facility has been compared for the hydraulic and steel containerization liner alternatives. Results were compared in terms of meeting the DOE Order 435. 1 low-level waste performance objective of 25 mrem/yr all-pathways dose during the 1) institutional control period (0 - 100 years), compliance period (0 - 1000 years) and post-compliance period (> 1000 years). Evaluation of the all pathway dose included the dose from ingestion and irrigation of contaminated groundwater extracted from a well 100 meters downgradient, in addition to the dose received from direct contact of radionuclides deposited near the surface resulting from facility overflow. Depending on the disposal facility radionuclide inventory, facility design, cover performance, and the location and environment where the facility is situated, the dose from exposure via direct contact of near surface deposited radionuclides can be much greater than the dose received via transport to the groundwater and subsequent ingestion...|$|E
40|$|Advances in the {{development}} of new materials continue {{to be made in the}} Geothermal Materials Project. Many successes have already been accrued and the results used commercially. In FY 1991, work was focused on reducing well drilling, fluid transport and energy conversion costs. Specific activities performed included lightweight CO{sub 2 }-resistant well cements, thermally conductive and scale resistant <b>protective</b> <b>liner</b> systems, chemical systems for lost circulation control, corrosion mitigation in process components at The Geysers, and elastomer-metal bonding systems. Efforts to transfer the technologies developed in these efforts to other energy-related sectors of the economy continued and considerable success was achieved. Laboratory testing of BNL-developed phosphate modified calcium aluminate cements confirmed their hydrolytic stability in 300 C brine and their resistance to chemical attack by CO{sub 2 }. Specimens were found to be > 20 times more resistant to carbonation than Class H cement and twice as resistant as unmodified calcium aluminate cements. Testing of thermally conductive polymer cements as potential corrosion resistant liner materials for use in heat exchanger applications was continued. Field test were conducted in flowing hypersaline brine and the results indicated scale deposition rates lower than those on a high alloy steel. Additional tests for bottoming cycle heat exchange use are planned for FY 1992. Progress was also made with chemical systems for lost circulation control. If materials placement is to be performed by pumping through an open drillpipe or through a drillable straddle packer, a bentonite-ammonium polyphosphate-borax-magnesium oxide formulation, containing fibers or particulates when large fissures are encountered, can be used. This system was ready for demonstration in FY 1991, but a suitable test site did not become available. Optimization of this and three other formulations for use with other Sandia National Laboratories developed placement technology is being continued. Work to develop high temperature hydrolytically stable chemical coupling systems needed to bond elastomers to metal reinforcement commenced. Until these become available, it will not be possible to produce many important tools needed to reduce well-drilling costs. To date very promising results have been achieved using high melting point (> 280 {sup o}) polyaromatic type adhesives. Compared to the best commercially available coupling systems which will undergo complete disbondment from stainless steel upon exposure for 1 day to brine at 200 C, copolymers made from the polyaromatic materials show no disbondment or loss of bond strength after 5 weeks. Additional work is required to improve the magnitude of the bond and to improve the thixotropic behavior of the adhesives in the liquid state. Cost-shared efforts with operators at the Geysers to evaluate the use of polymer concrete and polymeric liners to mitigate corrosion were continued. Small lined casing sections and full size collection piping tees are being tested. The results to date have been promising and larger-scale tests are planned...|$|E

40|$|Rotational {{acceleration}} {{experienced by}} the head during oblique impacts is known to cause traumatic brain injuries. It is hypothesized that shear properties of a foam layer, used for head protection (e. g., <b>protective</b> helmet <b>liners,</b> headliners in cars) {{can be related to}} the extent of rotational acceleration transmitted to the head. Furthermore, it is hypothesized that by introducing anisotropy in a foam layer, rotational acceleration can be mitigated. In this study, an anisotropic composite foam concept is proposed to mitigate head rotational acceleration, hence reducing the risk of traumatic brain injuries. The composite foam concept introduces anisotropy in a foam at the "macro level", combining different densities of foam in layered and quasi-fiber/matrix configurations. The performance of expanded polystyrene (EPS) composite foams in quasi-static compression and combined shear-compression loading and also linear and oblique impact experiments, has been compared with the performance of single layer EPS foam of similar thickness and density. The results of oblique head impact have been analyzed by global head injury criteria such as HIC, HICrot, and HIP. The composite foam concept demonstrates a great potential to be utilized in applications such as protective helmets due to the significant mitigation of brain injury risk. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Finding rugged and farm-proven {{sampling}} methods for odor measurement and mitigation of emissions {{continues to be}} a challenge. The objective was to develop a new method to quantify odorous volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in air. The main goal was to transform a fragile lab-based technology into a sampler that can be deployed {{for longer periods of time}} in remote locations. The developed method uses improved solid-phase microextraction (SPME) for combined on-site air sampling and sampling preparation. No power source is needed, and the technique is solvent-less. SPME fiber is exposed inside a <b>protective</b> glass <b>liner.</b> Thus, extraction of odorants is controlled by diffusion. Gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry is used for sample analysis in the laboratory. Acetic acid was chosen as a model compound to prove the concept. In the new method, extraction of acetic acid had a linear relationship with extraction time (R 23 ̆c 0. 99). The Car/PDMS 85 ÃÂÃÂµm fiber was shown to have better sensitivity for acetic acid. The effects of glass liner condition and diffusion path length on mass extraction were studied. The new method was evaluated under field conditions by comparing it to the standard method (sorbent tubes) in four different locations.

40|$|Sirri Island {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} islands in Iran where contains massive amounts of crude oil reservoirs and is a crude oil exporting and storage spot. Petroleum sludge wastes produced by the refineries are deposited in outdoor 2 -ha open pits. 30 sludge samples from different depot locations were conducted in 3 -time intervals and mixed with each other to form one homogenized sample. The sample was treated by solvent extraction method using methyl ethyl ketone as an efficient polar solvent in order to recover the valuable hydrocarbon and oil. About 99. 8 % of the oil was recovered and determined to reach almost the same quality as the exportable crude oil of Sirri Island. The sediments were also tested for size distribution range and titled as fine-grained soil. Toxicity characteristics leaching procedure test was conducted on the residuals to determine whether the waste is categorized as toxic and hazardous. The industrial waste evaluation model used in the current work suggested different leachate concentrations (10 %, 30 %, 50 %, 70 % and 90 % of total leachate) based on toxicity characteristics leaching procedure for different probable leaching scenarios. The surface and subsurface regional conditions such as depth to underground water table, climate condition, subsurface pH, soil texture and material were defined to the model as well. Then, the model simulated 10000 possible runs considering the leaching procedure, contaminant concentrations, maximum contaminant limits and surface and sub-surface conditions.
