50|$|Purebreds, {{also called}} purebreeds, are {{cultivated}} varieties or cultivars {{of an animal}} species, achieved {{through the process of}} selective breeding. When the lineage of a <b>purebred</b> <b>animal</b> is recorded, that animal is said to be pedigreed.|$|E
5000|$|The term {{purebred}} is occasionally {{confused with}} the proper noun Thoroughbred, which refers exclusively to a specific breed of horse, {{one of the first}} breeds for which a written national stud book was created since the 18th century. Thus a <b>purebred</b> <b>animal</b> should never be called a [...] "thoroughbred" [...] unless the animal actually is a registered Thoroughbred horse.|$|E
50|$|Recognizing {{the high}} demand for <b>purebred</b> <b>animals,</b> some {{people choose to}} engage in {{backyard}} breeding or operate puppy mills. This practice, where operators breed <b>purebred</b> <b>animals</b> for profit, is often without concern for the health or welfare of the animals involved. These animals may be sold through pet stores or directly from the breeders themselves.|$|R

50|$|One {{contributing}} factor in domestic animal homelessness is the cultural preference for young, <b>purebred</b> <b>animals.</b> Many people who prefer <b>purebred</b> <b>animals</b> choose to purchase them, often at significant cost, from breeders. One reason some owners choose {{to purchase a}} pet through a breeder or store is because people know what size and characteristics the animal will eventually have. This is not often possible with puppies acquired at a shelter. It should be noted, however, that approximately 25% of the dogs who enter <b>animal</b> shelters are <b>purebred.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{agriculture}} {{and in the}} hobby of animal fancy, a breeder is an individual animal used for selective breeding. Usually a breeder is a <b>purebred</b> <b>animal</b> bred {{with the intent of}} producing purebred or even show-quality animals. However, in some cases, a breeding animal is crossbred with another breed or a mixed breed with the intent of combining aspects of two or more different breeds.|$|E
50|$|CLASS A is for {{a typical}} {{representative}} of the Holstein or Friesian breed, as to type, size and constitution, with no obvious signs of crossbreeding, or be proved from its breeding records to contain between 50% and 74.9% Holstein genes or Friesian genes. If the breeding records show that one parent is of a breed other than Holstein-Friesian, Holstein, or Friesian, then such parent must be a <b>purebred</b> <b>animal</b> fully registered in a herd book of a dairy breed society recognised by the Society.|$|E
50|$|If the {{breeding}} {{is for a}} <b>purebred</b> <b>animal</b> {{that will be used}} for exhibition or future breeding (pets or livestock), the animal must be registered and conform to the criteria laid out for that breed in a breed standard kept by a central authority, such as a kennel club for dogs. In addition, the breed club, kennel club, or other governing authority may have other restrictions on the type of animal {{that can be used for}} breeding to produce offspring that can be registered.|$|E
40|$|International audienceAbstractBackgroundGenotype {{imputation}} {{is commonly}} used as an initial step in genomic selection since the accuracy of genomic selection does not decline if accurately imputed genotypes are used instead of actual genotypes but for a lower cost. Performance of imputation has rarely been investigated in crossbred animals and, in particular, in pigs. The extent and pattern of linkage disequilibrium differ in crossbred versus <b>purebred</b> <b>animals,</b> which may impact the performance of imputation. In this study, first we compared different scenarios of imputation from 5  K to 8  K single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genotyped Danish Landrace and Yorkshire and crossbred Landrace-Yorkshire datasets and, second, we compared imputation from 8  K to 60  K SNPs in genotyped purebred and simulated crossbred datasets. All imputations were done using software Beagle version 3. 3. 2. Then, we investigated the reasons that could explain the differences observed. ResultsGenotype imputation performs as well in crossbred <b>animals</b> as in <b>purebred</b> <b>animals</b> when both parental breeds {{are included in the}} reference population. When the size of the reference population is very large, {{it is not necessary to}} use a reference population that combines the two breeds to impute the genotypes of <b>purebred</b> <b>animals</b> because a within-breed reference population can provide a very high level of imputation accuracy (correct rate[*]≥[*] 0. 99, correlation[*]≥[*] 0. 95). However, to ensure that similar imputation accuracies are obtained for crossbred animals, a reference population that combines both parental <b>purebred</b> <b>animals</b> is required. Imputation accuracies are higher when a larger proportion of haplotypes are shared between the reference population and the validation (imputed) populations. ConclusionsThe results from both real data and pedigree-based simulated data demonstrate that genotype imputation from low-density panels to medium-density panels is highly accurate in both purebred and crossbred pigs. In crossbred pigs, combining the parental <b>purebred</b> <b>animals</b> in the reference population is necessary to obtain high imputation accuracy...|$|R

5|$|In 1967, the British Whippet Racing Association was {{established}} to bring around reform and consistency in race rules and procedures for races involving non-purebred Whippets. A year later, viewing the non-purebred dogs as a threat, the Whippet Club Racing Association {{was established}} exclusively for <b>purebred</b> <b>animals.</b>|$|R
50|$|Because pure-breeding {{creates a}} limited gene pool, <b>purebred</b> <b>animal</b> breeds are also {{susceptible}} {{to a wide}} range of congenital health problems. This problem is especially prevalent in competitive dog breeding and dog show circles due to the singular emphasis on aesthetics rather than health or function. Such problems also occur within certain segments of the horse industry for similar reasons. The problem is further compounded when breeders practice inbreeding. The opposite effect to that of the restricted gene pool caused by pure-breeding is known as hybrid vigor, which generally results in healthier animals.|$|E
5000|$|Breeders of {{designer}} crossbreds borrow the technical language from hybrid plant breeding: A first generation, 50-50 crossbred is an F1 cross. Subsequent generations {{may see a}} <b>purebred</b> <b>animal</b> crossed back on a crossbred, creating a 75/25 cross, or a BC1 or F1b [...] "backcross."

[...] A F2 cross bred to an F2 cross creates a F3 cross. Similarly, a F2 animal bred to an F1 animal creates a F2b backcross. F3 crosses and greater are called [...] "multi-generational" [...] crosses.

50|$|In some {{agricultural}} breeds, {{an otherwise}} closed registry includes a grading up route for {{the incorporation of}} cross-bred animals.

500|$|The Thoroughbred is a {{distinct}} breed of horse, although people sometimes refer to a purebred horse of any breed as a thoroughbred. The term for any horse or other animal derived from a single breed line is purebred. [...] While the term probably came into general use because the English Thoroughbred's General Stud Book {{was one of the}} first breed registries created, in modern usage horse breeders consider it incorrect to refer to any animal as a thoroughbred except for horses belonging to the Thoroughbred breed. [...] Nonetheless, breeders of other species of <b>purebred</b> <b>animals</b> may use the two terms interchangeably, though thoroughbred is less often used for describing <b>purebred</b> <b>animals</b> of other species. [...] The term is a proper noun referring to this specific breed, though often not capitalized, especially in non-specialist publications, and outside the US. For example, the Australian Stud Book, The New York Times, and the BBC do not capitalize the word.|$|R

40|$|Variance {{components}} were estimated for gestation length fitting the additive direct effect of calf, maternal genetic effect and sire effect as random effects. The statistical models also included the fixed effects of contemporary group, {{that included the}} date of breeding (AI), date of birth, and sex of calf, and the covariate age of dam at calving (linear and quadratic). Two different models were used, model 1 considering GL as a trait of the calf, and model 2 considering GL as a trait of the dam. The means of gestation length for the <b>purebred</b> <b>animals</b> were 294. 55 days (males) and 293. 34 days (females), while for the crossbred animals they were 292. 49 days (males) and 292. 55 days (females). Variance components for the <b>purebred</b> <b>animals,</b> fitting model 1, were 14. 47, 72. 78 and 57. 31, for the additive genetic (sigma 2 a), total phenotypic (sigma 2 p) and residual (sigma 2 e) effects, respectively, with a heritability estimate of 0. 21. For the crossbred animals, variance components for sigma 2 a, sigma 2 p, sigma 2 e were 90. 40, 127. 35 and 36. 95, respectively, with a heritability of 0. 71. Fitting model 2, the estimated variance components for the <b>purebred</b> <b>animals</b> were 12. 78, 5. 01, 74. 84 and 57. 05 for sigma 2 a, sire of calf (sigma ²asire), sigma 2 p, and sigma 2 e, respectively. The sire effect accounted for 0. 07 (c²) of the phenotypic variance and the coefficient of repeatability was 0. 17. For the crossbred animals, the variance {{components were}} 22. 11 (sigma 2 a), 22. 97 (sigma ²asire), 127. 70 (sigma 2 p) and 82. 61 (sigma 2 e), while c² was 0. 18 and repeatability was 0. 17. Therefore, regarding selection of beef cattle, it is suggested to use the heritability estimate obtained by model 1, where GL is considered as a trait of the calf...|$|R

The first importations into Australia were of milking cows carried on sailing ships. Several large importations occurred in the late 19th and early 20th centuries but the breed then lost its identity through crossbreeding. Importations from Britain took place in 1969, and the first <b>purebred</b> <b>animals</b> were imported from New Zealand in 1971. The breed occurs in most states of Australia.|$|R
50|$|A breed {{show is a}} broad {{term for}} {{exhibitions}} designed to showcase a single animal breed. In most cases, only <b>purebred</b> <b>animals</b> recorded with a breed registry are eligible to enter and compete.

50|$|Selective {{breeding}} (also called artificial selection) is {{the process}} by which humans use animal breeding and plant breeding to selectively develop particular phenotypic traits (characteristics) by choosing which typically animal or plant males and females will sexually reproduce and have offspring together. Domesticated animals are known as breeds, normally bred by a professional breeder, while domesticated plants are known as varieties, cultigens, or cultivars. Two <b>purebred</b> <b>animals</b> of different breeds produce a crossbreed, and crossbred plants are called hybrids. Flowers, vegetables and fruit-trees may be bred by amateurs and commercial or non-commercial professionals: major crops are usually the provenance of the professionals.|$|R
5000|$|Breeding {{stock is}} a group of animals used for the purpose of planned breeding. When {{individuals}} are looking to breed animals, they look for certain valuable traits in <b>purebred</b> <b>animals,</b> or may intend to use some type of crossbreeding to produce a new type of stock with different, and presumably superior abilities in a given area of endeavor. For example, when breeding swine the [...] "breeding stock should be sound, fast growing, muscular, lean, and reproductively efficient." [...] The [...] "subjective selection of breeding stock" [...] in horses has led to many horse breeds with particular performance traits.|$|R
5000|$|Sometimes {{the word}} {{purebred}} is used synonymously with pedigreed, but purebred {{refers to the}} animal having a known ancestry, and pedigree refers to the written record of breeding. Not all <b>purebred</b> <b>animals</b> have their lineage in written form. For example, until the 20th century, the Bedouin people of the Arabian peninsula only recorded the ancestry of their Arabian horses via an oral tradition, supported by the swearing of religiously based oaths as to the asil or [...] "pure" [...] breeding of the animal. Conversely, some animals may have a recorded pedigree or even a registry, but not be considered [...] "purebred". Today the modern Anglo-Arabian horse, a cross of Thoroughbred and Arabian bloodlines, is considered such a case.|$|R
5|$|The Directive also prescribes how herd {{books are}} managed, and, of {{particular}} {{relevance to the}} French Limousin Herd Book, requires that EU member countries do not oppose the entry in their herd books of <b>purebred</b> breeding <b>animals</b> of the same breed from other member countries.|$|R
50|$|Additionally, {{individuals}} seeking <b>purebred</b> <b>animals</b> may {{not realize}} that a homeless animal adopted from a shelter can have many advantages: often the shelter will have performed all necessary veterinary procedures, such as spaying or neutering, vaccination, deworming, microchipping, etc. Also, the personality of a kitten or puppy is not always an indicator of how the animal will behave in adulthood. Many shelter animals have reached adulthood and their personalities are apparent, allowing the would-be caregiver to select an animal with a personality that suits them. However, disease issues should be considered with shelter animals. Some shelter animals are transported to Northern states {{where there is no}} overpopulation problem. Such animals may be incubating disease or have parasites. Animals without a documented history may also have behavioral issues.|$|R
50|$|The Kisber Felver is a {{relatively}} young breed, developed over the past hundred years, and they display good conformation, athletic ability, movement, and a lively temperament. Like many other horse breeds, the Kisber Felver was endangered during the World War I and World War II. In 1945, {{more than half of}} the breeding stock were taken as war spoils. 150 Kisber Felver horses were imported for the US Remount, but were sold at public auction in 1947 when the remount disbanded. Unlike other European imports such as the Lipizzaner, the imported Kisber Felvers were widely crossbred, reducing the count of <b>purebred</b> <b>animals.</b> In 1961, the Dalmand Stud took hold of the remaining purebred Kisber Felvers. The stud has continued the breeding to the day.|$|R
5000|$|There are {{disadvantages}} {{to creating}} designer crossbreds, notably the potential that the cross {{will be of}} inferior quality or {{that it will not}} produce as consistent a result as would breeding <b>purebred</b> <b>animals.</b> For example, the poodle is a frequent breed used in creation of designer crossbreds, due to its nonshedding coat, but that trait does not always breed true when {{it is part of a}} designer cross. [...] Also, because breeders of crossbred animals may be less careful about genetic testing and weeding out undesirable traits, certain deleterious dominant genes may still be passed on to a crossbred offspring. In an F2 cross, recessive genetic traits may also return if the parent animals were both carriers of an undesired trait.|$|R
