40|$|FUNDAMENTOS: Desde o início da epidemia da Aids as dermatoses têm sido freqüentemente descritas em pacientes com essa doença, com relatos de casos atípicos e estudos de séries de pacientes adultos; no entanto, há poucas publicações sobre alterações cutâneas em pacientes pediátricos com Aids. OBJETIVOS: Estudo prospectivo para avaliar a presença de dermatoses em 40 pacientes pediátricos com Aids. MÉTODOS: Quarenta pacientes, com idade {{inferior}} a 13 anos e portadores de Aids, foram estudados por um período de seis meses para avaliação de: número de alterações dermatológicas; suas características clínicas; distribuição conforme as categorias clínico-imunológicas e o valor da carga viral. RESULTADOS: A prevalência de dermatoses foi de 82, 4 %, na primeira consulta, e, no acompanhamento longitudinal, 92, 5 % dos pacientes tiveram alterações dermatológicas, com proporção de cinco diagnósticos por doente. As crianças com classificação clínico-imunológica grave e carga viral acima de 100. 000 cópias/ml apresentaram maior número de alterações dermatológicas quando comparadas àquelas das categorias clínico-imunológicas leves. A proporção de diagnósticos por paciente na categoria clínica C foi de 6, 8 e na A de 3, 6; na categoria imunológica grave, de sete, e na leve de 3, 7; e na carga viral > 100. 000 de 7, 3, e na BACKGROUND: Ever {{since the}} beginning of the Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (Aids) epidemic, a number of dermatoses have been frequently described in patients with this disease. In the literature, case reports and studies in series of adult patients with atypical lesions are frequent found. By contrast, there are few reports on cutaneous alterations in <b>pediatric</b> patients with <b>Aids.</b> OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the following prospective survey is to evaluate the presence of dermatoses in 40 <b>pediatric</b> patients with <b>Aids.</b> METHOD: Forty patients diagnosed with Aids and less than 13 years of age were seen for six months. The following features were evaluated: number of dermatoses, clinical characteristics, distribution in accordance with the clinical-immunological categories in relation to CD 4 T-lymphocyte and viral load values. RESULTS: The prevalence of dermatoses in the first evaluation was 82. 4 %. In a longitudinal follow-up, 92. 5 % of the patients developed some kind of skin problem. Children belonging to the worst clinical-immunological category, with a viral load higher than 100, 000 copies/ml showed a higher number of dermatoses when compared to the mildest categories. The number of dermatologic alterations per patient was 6. 8 in clinical category C and 3. 6 in A. In the immunological severe category, it was 7. 0, while in the mild one, it was 3. 7. For viral load > 100, 000, the number was 7. 3, and for < 100, 000, it was 4, 2 (all with statistical significance). CONCLUSION: Dermatological alterations were frequent and directly related to advanced stages of <b>Aids</b> in <b>pediatric</b> patients.

40|$|Background: Integrated signal {{processing}} (ISP) uses a coordinated and concerted approach to {{signal processing}} so that both wearer and environmental information, {{along with the}} intermediate results of each processing unit, are shared among other signal processing units. Aim: The aim of this work was to evaluate the benefits of ISP, if any, in <b>pediatric</b> hearing <b>aid</b> (HA) users. Methods: This study was conducted on 16 Egyptian children with bilateral moderate to severe sensorineural hearing loss. Children’s performance was assessed using their own digital HAs and using newly-fitted ISP HAs. Evaluation was repeated at 1 and 6 -month post-ISP HA fitting. Evaluation included aided sound field threshold estimation and speech recognition in noise tests. Parents were asked to fill the WILSI self-assessment-questionnaire. Results and conclusions: Significant improvement in aided sound field threshold levels and speech recognition in noise tests was recorded using ISP HAs over time. As regards consonant manner, glides and stop consonants showed the highest improvement. Though voiced and voiceless consonants were equally transmitted through digital HAs, voiced consonants were easier to perceive using ISP HAs. Middle and back consonants were easier to perceive compared to front consonants using both HAs. Application of WILSI self assessment questionnaire revealed that parents reported better performance in different listening situations. In conclusion, {{results of the present}} study support the use of ISP HAs in children with moderate to severe hearing loss due to the significant improvement recorded in both subjective and objective measures...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Unintentional injury {{remains the}} leading cause of {{morbidity}} and mortality among children worldwide. The aims of this study were to assess a baseline level of first aid knowledge and overall attitudes regarding first aid among staff members in Shanghai preschools. Methods A cross-sectional study was carried out among the staff members at selected preschools. A stratified random sampling method was first used to identify suitable subjects. Data were obtained using a multiple-choice questionnaire. A standardized collection of demographics was performed and participants were given the aforementioned questionnaire to indicate knowledge of and attitudes toward first aid. Results 1067 subjects completed the questionnaire. None of the surveyed employees answered all questions correctly; only 39 individuals (3. 7 %) achieved passing scores. The relative number of correct answers to specific questions ranged from 16. 5 % to 90. 2 %. In particular, subjects lacked knowledge regarding first aid for convulsive seizures (only 16. 5 % answered correctly), chemical injuries to the eye (23 %), inhaled poison (27. 6 %), and choking and coughing (30. 1 %). A multiple linear regression analysis showed scores were significantly higher among staff members with more education, those who had received first aid training before or were already healthcare providers, younger employees, and staff members from rural districts. Most employees agreed that giving first aid was helpful; the vast majority felt that it was important and useful for them to learn <b>pediatric</b> first <b>aid.</b> Conclusions The level of first-aid knowledge among preschool staffs in Shanghai was low.

50|$|In England, {{childcare}} is inspected {{and regulated}} by OFSTED (previously this was administered by Local Authority Social Services). Care {{for children under}} five is split into Childcare on Domestic Premises which is Childminding and Daycare. In the UK being a ‘Childminder’ is a protected title and can only be used by registered professionals. Registered Childminders are trained, insured and qualified in <b>Pediatric</b> First <b>Aid.</b> They comply/administer/work with The Early Years Foundation Stage EYFS and have the same responsibilities for education as nurseries and reception classes. They generally work from their own homes and are always self-employed setting their own terms and conditions. The basic numbers of children that childminders can care for is 6 children under 8 years of age; of these children, 3 may be under 5 and of these 1 may be under 1. These numbers include the childminders own children (although the childminder’s children will not {{be included in the}} childminding ‘Certificate’). Some childminders work with either childminding assistants or with co-childminders, which often increases the number of children that can be cared for and individual childminders can request a ‘variation’ which may increase the children that they care for particularly for ‘continuity of care’ or for twins. There is a professional body - the Professional Association for Childcare & Early Years (formerly the National Childminding Association), which “Promotes and supports quality child-minding expertise” and provides information for Childminders and parents. London has greater pressures on childcare provision than other English regions. A recent study by London’s Poverty Profile found the level of childcare provision in London is lower than the England average. In London, there are 4.4 children aged under 8 per childcare place, compared to the England average of 3.9.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. There is a {{high demand}} for patient {{specific}} cardiovascular therapeutics, especially in pediatric cardiology which is confronted with complex and rather unique congenital diseases. Current predictors for disease severity and treatment selection have been proven to be suboptimal creating profound burden of premature morbidity and mortality. Over the past decade, the influence of blood hemodynamics has become increasingly acknowledged, especially {{in the context of}} congenital diseases of the aortic arch. MRI-based 2 D and 3 D flow measurements are nowadays possible, although restricted by cumbersome acquisition protocols and limited acquisition resolution. Computational fluid dynamics offers a valuable alternative that also enables treatment outcome prediction. However, the current methods rely on a sequence of complicated manual steps that lack the scalability required within clinical settings. We propose a computation framework for large-scale hemodynamics simulations in <b>pediatric</b> cardiology to <b>aid</b> diagnostic and therapy decision making in patients affected by congenital disease of the aortic valve and the aorta. Our method provides a deterministic and streamlined processing pipeline to perform computational fluid dynamics simulations based on patient-specific boundary conditions. Thus, blood flow simulations are performed using an embedded boundary method within a level-set formulation with boundary conditions provided by patient-specific anatomical and hemodynamical models. The capabilities of our framework are demonstrated by performing blood flow analysis on patients selected from a FDA sponsored multi-center clinical trial. ...|$|R
40|$|Objective:The {{principles}} of evidence-based practice (EBP) are a mandated {{component of the}} pediatric residency curriculum; however, a pediatrics-based assessment tool validated with pediatric residents does not exist. Methods: We designed an assessment instrument composed of items in 4 categories: 1) demographics; 2) comfort level; 3) self-reported practice of EBP; and 4) EBP knowledge. This last section required participants to identify best evidence and most appropriate study design by using pediatric-based scenarios, develop searchable questions, and use existing published research to address diagnostic and treatment issues. Four groups completed the instrument: preclinical medical students (MS- 2), incoming pediatric interns (PGY- 1), incoming second- and third-year pediatric residents (PGY 2 - 3), and expert tutors (expert). We determined internal consistency, interrater reliability, content validity, item difficulty, and construct validity. Results: Fifty-six subjects completed tests (MS- 2, n = 13; PGY- 1, n = 13; PGY 2 - 3, n = 22; expert, n = 8). Internal reliability was good, with Cronbach's alpha =. 80. Interrater reliability was high (kappa = 0. 94). Items were free of floor or ceiling effects. Comfort level and self-reported practice of EBP increased with expertise level and prior EBP experience (P <. 01). Scores on the knowledge section (out of 50 +/- SD) rose with training level (MS- 2 : 14. 8 +/- 5. 7; PGY- 1 : 22. 2 +/- 3. 4; PGY 2 - 3 : 31. 7 +/- 6. 1; experts: 43 +/- 4. 0; P <. 01).
