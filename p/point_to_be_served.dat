40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a methodology to obtain optimal routes {{for the collection}} of urban waste. The problem is characterized as arcs coverage and for its development a combination of techniques in the Operational Research area was used. Firstly, the Teitz and Bart heuristic <b>was</b> used <b>to</b> obtain p-medians; from the definition of latter were defined groups (clusters) of demand points by designating these to the medians, {{by means of the}} Gillett and Johnson algorithm, adapted. Finally, from the definition of the groups of points, the Chinese Postman Algorithm was used, resulting in the routing (sequencing the demand <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>served)</b> in each of the service groups. The results obtained are presented for a case study of the city of Joinville, State of Santa Catarina...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In {{directional}} sensor networks, sensors can steer {{around to}} serve multiple target points. Most previous works assume {{there are always}} enough deployed sensors so that all target points can <b>be</b> <b>served</b> simultaneously. However, this assumption may not hold when the mission requirement changes or when more target <b>points</b> need <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>served.</b> Since it <b>is</b> not always practical to deploy new sensors, we propose to reconfigure the network by letting existing sensors steer and serve the targets periodically. As a result, targets may not <b>be</b> <b>served</b> continuously, and the service delay affects the quality of service. One important problem <b>is</b> how <b>to</b> choose the optimal set of targets to serve by each sensor such that the maximum service delay is minimized. We first show that this problem is NP-complete, and then we propose a centralized protocol whose performance is bounded by a logarithm factor of the optimal solution. We also propose a distributed protocol which achieves the same performance as the centralized protocol. Finally, we extend the optimization model and the protocols by considering the rotation delay, which is critical for some applications but ignored by previous work. I...|$|R
40|$|It has <b>been</b> {{proposed}} <b>to</b> {{install a}} symmetrical array of photodetectors about {{the center of}} the mask of a coronagraph of the type used to search for planets orbiting remote stars. The purpose of this installation <b>is</b> <b>to</b> utilize the light from a star under observation as a guide in pointing the telescope. Simple arithmetic processing of the outputs of the photodetectors would provide indications of the lateral position of {{the center of the}} mask relative {{to the center of the}} image of the star. These indications could serve as pointing-control feedback signals for adjusting the telescope aim to center the image of the star on the mask. The widths of central mask areas available for placement of photodetectors differ among coronagraph designs, typically ranging upward from about 100 m. Arrays of photodetectors can readily be placed within areas in this size range. The number of detectors in an array could be as small as 4 or as large as 64. The upper limit on the number of detectors would <b>be</b> determined according <b>to</b> the extent of the occulting pattern and the number of functionalities, in addition <b>to</b> <b>pointing</b> control, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>served</b> by the array...|$|R

Requests arrive {{one by one and}} need <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>served</b> instantly by at least one of two servers. We consider the general model where the cost function of the two servers may be different. Formally, each server moves in its own metric space and a request consists of one point in each metric space. It <b>is</b> <b>served</b> by moving one of the two servers <b>to</b> its request <b>point.</b> Requests have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>served</b> without knowledge of future requests. The objective <b>is</b> <b>to</b> minimize the total traveled distance. The special case where both servers move on the real line is known as the CNN problem. We show that the generalized work function algorithm, WFAλ, is constant competitive for the generalized 2 -server problem. Further, we give an outline for a possible extension to k 2 servers and discuss the applicability of our techniques and of the work function algorithm in general. We conclude with a discussion on several open problems in online optimization...|$|R

40|$|Let A be a nonempty finite {{subset of}} R^ 2 {{representing}} the geographical coordinates {{of a set}} of demand <b>points</b> (towns, [...] .), <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>served</b> by a facility, whose location within a given region S is sought.

In practice, it may be the case, however, that the demand vector w is not known, and only an estimator {hat w} can be provided. Moreover the errors in sich estimation process may be non-negligible. We propose a new model for this situation: select a threshold valus B 0 representing the highest admissible transportation cost. Define the robustness p of a location x as the minimum increase in demand needed to become inadmissible, i. e. p(x) = min{||w^*-{hat w}|| : TC(w^*,x) B, w^* = 0 } and solve then the optimization problem max_{x in S} p(x) to get the most robust location...|$|R

Operations might again be conducted in Iraq and Iran and official history volumes were produced against the objections of the Foreign Office. Military histories concentrated on the doings of national contingents, rarely referring to those of allied and opposing armies; comparative analysis is absent and national bias, due to ulterior motives like the temptation to myth make, can also be found. The Australian Official History of Australia in the War of 1914–1918 edited by Charles Bean contains exaggerations {{of the significance of}} the Australian contribution, the prowess of Australian soldiers and disparagements of soldiers from Britain and its allies.|$|R
25|$|In 1919, the hotelier Alexander Seiler {{applied for}} a {{concession}} for a metre gauge tramway from Visp to Brig, which, if built, would serve {{to open up the}} small settlements between the two towns. That project was terminated after the SBB stated that it would insert two halting points into its standard gauge line. As the SBB did not follow up this announcement, the concession application was resubmitted in 1925. Shortly afterwards, a committee comprising the VZ, the FO and the Lonza Group works at Visp took over the project. Under the leadership of the VZ, it was transformed into a connecting narrow gauge railway running parallel to the SBB line, was no longer equipped with any halting <b>points,</b> and <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>serve</b> only to link the VZ and the FO. In 1928, the committee presented a correspondingly modified concession application, which was approved on 28 September 1928, subject to a condition that one intermediate halting point be included. Following the completion of that project as approved, continuous operations from Brig <b>to</b> Zermatt <b>were</b> finally able <b>to</b> begin on 5 June 1930. Curiously, the opening of the new link did not lead directly to a name change for the Visp-Zermatt-Bahn. Only on 1 June 1962 was the name changed to Compagnie du Chemin de Fer de Brigue-Viège-Zermatt (Brig-Visp-Zermatt-Bahn).|$|R
5000|$|The modern form of {{official}} history {{began in the}} mid-nineteenth century in reports written as military guides for later officers. The histories were detailed descriptions of events, not easy reading for a lay audience and left judgements to the discretion of a mainly professional readership. After the First World War, the New Zealand government decided that after a total war, its official histories should be written for a public who had fought in the war or supported the war effort. After the Second World War, the low academic standard of military education, especially in historical analysis, led to a view that professionally-trained historians should write official histories, applying their academic training to explain why as well as describe what. Since many of the academics had participated in the war, they could <b>be</b> expected <b>to</b> have experience of military service and knowledge of the war inform their writing. The contemporary view is that official history should incorporate the three points of view, containing the detailed description needed for works of military instruction but also <b>to</b> <b>be</b> suitable for a general readership and to show how participants tried to solve problems, drawing lessons from their successes and failures. None of the <b>points</b> of view <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>served</b> by the production {{of official}} history <b>is</b> immune <b>to</b> error, because work by a military historian might be fraudulent for personal or political reasons, distorting the record.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{computational}} {{model for the}} allocation of fleeting peer tutors {{in a community of}} learners: a student’s call for support is evaluated by the model in order to allocate the most appropriate peer tutor. Various authors have suggested peer tutoring as a favourable approach for confining the ever-growing workloads of teachers and tutors in online learning environments. The model’s starting <b>point</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>serve</b> two conflicting requirements: 1) the allocated peers should have sufficient knowledge to guarantee high quality support and 2) tutoring workload of peers should be fairly distributed over the student population. While the first criterion <b>is</b> likely <b>to</b> saddle a small number of very bright students with all the tutoring workload, the unconditional pursuit of a uniform workload distribution over the students <b>is</b> likely <b>to</b> allocate incompetent tutors.

The current study demonstrates the feasibility of the self-allocating peer tutoring mechanism. The proposed model is sufficiently stable within a wide range of conditions. By introducing an overload tolerance parameter which stretches the fair workload distribution criteria, substantial improvements of the allocation success rate are effected. It is demonstrated that the allocation algorithm works best at large population sizes. The results show that the type of curriculum (collective route or individualised routes) has only little influence on the allocation mechanism...|$|R
