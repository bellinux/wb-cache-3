The biggest changes in the CMYK color system was determined in the Yellow color, while in the tested PANTONE color system – in the blue (P 290) color.

5000|$|The {{design of}} the flag was {{originally}} conceived by NASA planetary scientist Pascal Lee during the 1998 Haughton-Mars Project arctic expedition to Devon Island, Canada. In addition to symbolizing liberty as a tricolour flag, the design evokes {{a vision of the}} [...] "future history" [...] of Mars in which the planet is transformed from red, to green, and then blue like the Earth. The red bar, which lies closest to the mast, symbolizes Mars as it is today. The green and blue symbolize stages in the possible terraforming of Mars, should humanity ever have the ability and will to undertake such a task; the ethics of terraforming remaining a matter of debate. Kim Stanley Robinson's popular science-fiction trilogy Red Mars, Green Mars, and Blue Mars also provided inspiration for the flag. Beyond any human-induced terraforming, the color sequence also depicts the environmental change Mars might experience on astronomical timescales as the Sun evolves into a red giant and Mars becomes warmer.

40|$|Managing {{semantic}} heterogeneity is {{a complex}} task. One solution involves matching like terms to each other. We view Match as an operator that takes two graph-like structures (e. g., concept hierarchies or ontologies) and returns a mapping between the nodes of the graphs that correspond semantically to each other. State of the art <b>matching</b> <b>systems</b> (e. g., COMA, Cupid) perform well for many real world applications. However, <b>matching</b> <b>systems</b> may produce mappings {{that may not be}} intuitively obvious to human users. Moreover, there are cases where <b>matching</b> <b>systems</b> do not produce a useful mapping. In order for users to trust the mappings (and thus use them), they need to understand them. Also, if a system does not provide a mapping or provides a partial mapping, users need to understand answers so that they can understand either why a mapping was not produced or why only a partial answer was produced. In this paper we describe how <b>matching</b> <b>systems</b> can explain their answers using the Inference Web (IW) infrastructure. There, S-Match, a semantic <b>matching</b> <b>system,</b> produces proofs for mappings it has discovered...|$|R
