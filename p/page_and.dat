40|$|User Equipment (UE) <b>paging</b> <b>and</b> {{location}} tracking {{are influenced by}} the underling state handling model. There are recent proposals to introduce a new RRC state called RRC Inactive as a main state for inactive UEs in 5 th Generation (5 G) cellular systems. One of the characteristics of the new state is that the interface between the Radio Access Network (RAN) and Core Network (CN) is kept. Considering this characteristic, there are proposals for a RAN controlled <b>paging</b> <b>and</b> {{location tracking}} schemes for RRC Inactive UEs. In this paper, we show that this approach is not always beneficial, especially for high mobility UEs. Instead, we propose a hybrid <b>paging</b> <b>and</b> location tracking scheme where both RAN and CN are involved in the <b>paging</b> <b>and</b> location tracking of RRC Inactive UEs. This is done transparently to the UE. We further propose a hierarchical <b>paging</b> <b>and</b> location tracking scheme to reduce the signaling overhead from <b>paging</b> <b>and</b> location tracking updates. The scheme is applicable to both RAN based <b>and</b> CN based <b>paging</b> <b>and</b> location tracking schemes...|$|R

5|$|The {{material}} {{on the first two}} albums was largely constructed out of extended jams of blues standards and folk songs. This method led to the mixing of musical and lyrical elements of different songs and versions, as well as improvised passages, to create new material, but would lead to later accusations of plagiarism and legal disputes over copyright. Usually the music was developed first, sometimes with improvised lyrics that might then be rewritten for {{the final version of the}} song. From the visit to Bron-Yr-Aur in 1970, the songwriting partnership between <b>Page</b> <b>and</b> Plant became predominant, with Page supplying the music, largely via his acoustic guitar, and Plant emerging as the band's chief lyricist. Jones and Bonham then added to the material, in rehearsal or in the studio, as a song was developed. In the later stages of the band's career, Page took a back seat in composition and Jones became increasingly important in producing music, often composed on the keyboard. Plant would then add lyrics before <b>Page</b> <b>and</b> Bonham developed their parts.|$|E
