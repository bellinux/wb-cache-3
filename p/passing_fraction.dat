40|$|Separate {{phases of}} metal {{partitioning}} behaviour in freshwater lakes that receive {{varying degrees of}} atmospheric contamination and have low concentrations of suspended solids were investigated to determine {{the applicability of the}} distribution coefficient, KD. Concentrations of Pb, Ni, Co, Cu, Cd, Cr, Hg and Mn were determined using a combination of filtration methods, bulk sample collection and digestion and Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS). Phytoplankton biomass, suspended solids concentrations and the organic content of the sediment were also analysed. By distinguishing between the phytoplankton and (inorganic) lake sediment, transient variations in KD were observed. Suspended solids concentrations over the 6 -month sampling campaign showed no correlation with the KD (n = 15 for each metal, p > 0. 05) for Mn (r 2 = 0. 0063), Cu (r 2 = 0. 0002, Cr (r 2 = 0. 021), Ni (r 2 = 0. 0023), Cd (r 2 = 0. 00001), Co (r 2 = 0. 096), Hg (r 2 = 0. 116) or Pb (r 2 = 0. 164). The results implied that colloidal matter had less opportunity to increase the dissolved (filter <b>passing)</b> <b>fraction,</b> which inhibited the spurious lowering of KD. The findings conform to the increasingly documented theory that the use of KD in modelling may mask true information on metal partitioning behaviour. The root mean square error of prediction between the directly measured total metal concentrations and those modelled based on the separate phase fractions were ± 3. 40, 0. 06, 0. 02, 0. 03, 0. 44, 484. 31, 80. 97 and 0. 1 μg/L for Pb, Cd, Mn, Cu, Hg, Ni, Cr and Co respectively. The magnitude of error suggests that the separate phase models for Mn and Cu can be used in distribution or partitioning models for these metals in lake water...|$|E

The lymphoproliferative activities were separated into two fractions by DEAE-Sepharose CL- 6 B chromatography: {{one is in}} the <b>fraction</b> <b>passed</b> through the column {{and the other in}} the fraction eluated from the column with a low concentration of NaCl. The eluated fraction induced the proliferation of interleukin- 1 (IL- 1) -dependent D 10 N 4 M cells. This activity was abrogated by an anti-IL- 1 alpha antibody, but not an anti-IL- 1 beta antibody. Expression of IL- 1 alpha mRNA was also detected in 871207 B cells. The thymocyte proliferative activity found in the <b>fraction</b> <b>passed</b> through the DEAE-Sepharose column was further separated into three fractions by heparin-Sepharose column chromatography: (1) the <b>fraction</b> <b>passed</b> through the column, (2) the fraction weakly bound to the column, and (3) the fraction firmly bound to the heparin column.

40|$|A spreadsheet-based {{stochastic}} model {{was developed to}} track fruit numbers and fruit value for 1, 000 individual items grown in a farmer's field, sorted at a packinghouse with and without advanced inspection technology, distributed with and without repack, and sold at a retail store. The quantities generated at each step are value per unit volume in the production field and the respective price multipliers and <b>passing</b> <b>fractions</b> at the packinghouse, distribution center, and retail store. Values of these coefficients were set to reflect experience with the onion industry. It was assumed that about 30 % (with repackaging) to 40 % (without repackaging) of the fruit leaving the farmer's field would reach the consumer. The initial price per unit volume and pricing multipliers were configured to give representative prices at the production field and representative price per unit fruit at steps through the system to the consumer. The pass-through percentage was decreased an extra 10 % to 15 % with technology and up to 20 % with repack, with corresponding increases in subsequent steps to maintain the 25 % to 25 % total pass-through. Repacking and technology addition in the packinghouse tended to result in increased value at the retail level. Placing technology in the packinghouse {{did not result in}} increased value for the packinghouse. Vertical integration that included the packinghouse would be required to make it profitable to add sorting technology that increases quality by removing defective items. Both technology addition and repackaging reduce the total number of fruits reaching the consumer. The model suggests that the notion of early removal of fruits with latent damage to avoid increased distribution costs does not really benefit the consumer for the conditions modeled. Additional considerations such as food security are required for one to expect additional equipment adoption under current scenarios. Agribusiness,...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A {{significant}} change in microstructure occurs during the application of severe plastic deformation (SPD) such as by equal-channel angular pressing (ECAP). In this study, intense plastic strain was imposed on an Al- 10. 8 wt%Ag alloy by the ECAP process. The amount of strain was controlled by the numbers of passes. After 1 pass of ECAP, shear bands became visible within the matrix. With increasing numbers of ECAP <b>passes,</b> the <b>fraction</b> of shear bands was increased. In this study, the change in microstructures was examined by three-dimensional electron tomography (3 D-ET) in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) or {{scanning transmission electron microscopy}} (STEM). With this 3 D-ET method, it was possible to conduct a precise analysis of the sizes, widths and distributions of the shear bands produced by the ECAP process. It is demonstrated that the 3 D-ET method is promising to understand mechanisms of microstructural refinement using the ECAP process. Plastic deformation is an effective method to alter the microstructures and to improve mechanical properties. Equal-channel angular pressing (ECAP) is a simple process to introduce large plastic strains [1] and to produce submicron-grained structure, which requires a block wit...|$|R

40|$|The {{application}} of magnesium alloys is greatly limited {{because of their}} relatively low strength and ductility. An effective way to improve the mechanical properties of magnesium alloy is to refine the grains. As the race for better materials performance is never ending, attempts to develop viable techniques for microstructure refinement continue.

In this work, an AZ 31 wrought magnesium alloy was processed by employing multipass accumulative back extrusion process.
