500|$|The Potato Sack is {{the name}} of an {{alternate}} reality game (ARG) created by the Valve Corporation and the developers of thirteen independent video games to promote the release of Valve's title, Portal 2, in April 2011. [...] Valve president Gabe Newell envisioned the game as a [...] "Cross Game Design Event" [...] in December 2010, and allowed the developers a free rein to design the game using Valve's Portal intellectual property. The game, requiring players to find and solve a number of puzzles hidden within updates of the thirteen games, ultimately led to the opportunity for players to release Portal 2 about 10 hours earlier than its planned release by playing games under the pretense of powering up GLaDOS, the sentient computer antagonist from the Portal series. The ARG's theme of potatoes is based on plot elements within Portal 2, specifically that for part of the game, GLaDOS's <b>personality</b> <b>module</b> is run off a potato battery.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} a one person game called Indian policeman's dilemma (IPD). It {{represents}} the internal conflict between emotion and profession of a typical Indian police officer. We have 'split' the game to be played independently by different <b>personality</b> <b>modules</b> of the same player. Each module then appears as an independent individual player of the game. None of the players knows the exact payoff values {{of any of the}} others. Only greater than or less than type of inequalities among the payoff values across the players are to be inferred probabilistically. There are two Nash equilibrium (NE) points in this game signifying two completely opposing behavior by the policeman involved. With the help of the probabilistic inequalities probable propensities of the different behaviors have been determined. The model underscores the need for new surveys and data generation. A design of one such survey to measure professionalism of the police personnel has been outlined...|$|R
40|$|The {{computer}} game industry has grown immensely {{in the last}} decade and artificial intelligence is an increasing part of game development. Personality in agents has been studied, but is not widely implemented in {{computer game}}s. We developed the <b>Personality</b> <b>Module,</b> a component adding personality to agents, and implemented it in StateCraft, a software version of the board-game Diplomacy. This was evaluated both through simulations in all-agent games and through human testing. The results show that agent personality in a turn-based strategy game like StateCraft both affects the agents' performance and the gameplay experience...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} an {{integrated}} method of linking personality and emotion with the response generation and expression synthesis of Virtual Humans. The characters are {{powered by a}} dialogue system that consists of a large set of basic interactions between user and computer. These interactions are encoded in finite state machines. Transitions are linked with conditions and actions that can be connected with external modules. One of these modules is a <b>personality</b> <b>module.</b> In this way, responses of the virtual human depend not only on input given by a user, but also on its personality and emotional state. The dialogue system is connected to a 3 D face that performs the speech and facial animation, together with facial expressions that reflect the personality specification...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe can't overemphasize the {{importance}} of robot's emotional expressions as robots step into human's daily lives. So, the believable and socially acceptable emotional expressions of robots are essential. For such human-like emotional expression, we have proposed an emotion generation model considering personality, mood and history of robot's emotion. The <b>personality</b> <b>module</b> {{is based on the}} Big Five Model (OCEAN Model, Five Factor Model); the mood module has one dimension such as good or bad, and the emotion module uses the six basic emotions as defined by Ekman. Unlike most of the previous studies, the proposed emotion generation model was integrated with the Linear Dynamic Affect Expression Model (LDAEM), which is an emotional expression model that can make facial expressions similar to those of humans. So, both the emotional state and expression of robots can be changed dynamically...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{our research}} on applying our dependability assessment method to an OGSA compliant middleware product. Our initial {{proof of concept}} experiment was implemented using a stateless Tomcat web server and Apache SOAP. This research adapts and enhances our existing fault injection software (OGSA-FIT) from the stateless environment of a standard web service to the stateful environment of an OGSA Toolkit (Globus). We compare our initial proof of concept experiment to our new target system based on the Globus Toolkit. The Globus Toolkit is implemented around an Apache Tomcat server using the Axis SOAP library as well as OGSA interfaces and libraries. We address issues arising from latencies introduced into the system by OGSA-FIT. We introduce a model for calculating this latency and introduce new mechanisms into the software to reduce this. We also present results from our initial experiments, which showed a problem with an alpha version of the Globus Toolkit. We detail future research including plans to enhance our user GUI to provide semi-automatic test campaign generation. Also since our OGSA-FIT software is intended to support both OGSA based middleware as well as standard SOAP based web-service environments we outline our research into providing interchangeable <b>personality</b> <b>modules...</b>|$|R
40|$|There {{are many}} {{scheduling}} programs available, {{but very few}} with context. If the program could know {{just a little bit}} about the user’s personality, it could help a great deal to optimize and improve the user’s habits. We added a Myers Briggs <b>personality</b> type indicator <b>module</b> to a scheduling program to help the program learn more about the user. With more contextual information about the user, the program is able to schedule more effectively by helping two diverse personalities, the judger and the perceiver, become more like each other. Thus, by adding just a tiny bit of context to a normal, simple scheduling program, a user can adjust his / her habits to become more successful in life...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{examine the}} history of {{psychiatric}} disorders in the {{parents of children with}} selective mutism (SM) compared to parents of children in a control group. Method: Seventy parent dyads (n = 140) of children with SM and 31 parent dyads (n = 62) of children without SM were interviewed with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID-IV & SCID-II) anxiety disorders, mood disorders, avoidant personality disorder (AVPD), and schizoid <b>personality</b> disorder <b>modules</b> via telephone. Interviewers were blind to proband status. The NEO Personality Inventory (NEO-PI-R) was also administered as an assessment of personality traits. Results: Generalized social anxiety disorder (GSAD) was present in 37 % of SM parents, compared with 14. 1 % of control parents (X 2 = 10. 98, p <. 001; Odd Ratio = 3. 58). AVPD was present in 17. 5 % of the SM parents and in 4. 7 % of control parents (X 2 = 6. 18, p <. 05; OR = 4. 32). The proportion of parents with other psychiatric disorders was not different between groups. SM parents had higher Neuroticism (N) and Openness (O) scores on the NEO-PI-R than control parents. Conclusions: These results support earlier uncontrolled findings of a stron...|$|R
40|$|The UltraNet is a {{high speed}} network capable of rates up to one gigabit per second. It is a hub based network with four optical fiber links {{connecting}} each hub. Each link can carry up to 256 megabits of data, and the hub backplane is capable of one gigabit aggregate throughput. Host connections to the hub may be fiber, coax, or channel based. Bus based machines have adapter boards that connect to transceivers in the hub, while channel based machines use a <b>personality</b> <b>module</b> in the hub. One way that the UltraNet achieves its high transfer rates is by off-loading the protocol processing from the hosts to special purpose protocol engines in the UltraNet hubs. In addition, every hub has a PC connected to it by StarLAN for network management purposes. Although there is hub resident and PC resident UltraNet software, this document treats only the host resident UltraNet software...|$|E

40|$|The {{majority}} {{of parents in}} the United States engage in 2 ̆ 2 good enough 2 ̆ 2 parenting, which allows children to develop into functional and well-adjusted adults. However, as the Juvenile court system knows well, some parent 2 ̆ 7 s do not engage in 2 ̆ 2 good enough 2 ̆ 2 parenting; some parents are very abusive or neglectful in their parenting styles. In 2012, and estimated 686, 000 children were victims of child maltreatment. Can child abuse be prevented? Yes, it can. There is {{a strong correlation between}} an individual 2 ̆ 7 s personality make up and the way they parent.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel learning framework to pro-vide computer game agents {{the ability to}} adapt to the player as well as other game agents. Our technique gen-erally involves a <b>personality</b> adaptation <b>module</b> encap-sulated in a reinforcement learning framework. Unlike previous work in which adaptation normally involves a decision process on every single action the agent takes, we introduce a two-level process whereby adaptation only takes place on an abstracted actions set which we coin as agent personality. With the personality de-fined, each agent will then take actions according to the restrictions imposed in its personality. In doing so, adaptation takes place in appropriately defined intervals in the game, without disrupting or slowing down the game constantly with intensive decision-making com-putations, hence improving enjoyment for the player. Moreover, by decoupling adaptation from action selec-tion, we have a modular adaptive system that can be used with existing action planning methods. With an actual typical game scenario that we have created, it is shown that a team of agents using our framework to adapt towards the player are able to perform better than a team with scripted behavior. Consequently, we also show the team performs even better when adapted to-wards each other...|$|R

The findings would not only help in identifying future recidivistic criminals but can also be used for legal, judicial, interventional and corrective purposes...|$|R
40|$|Engagement {{is crucial}} to {{designing}} intelligent systems that can adapt to the characteristics of their users. This paper focuses on the automatic analysis and classification of engagement based on humans' and robot's personality profiles in a triadic human-human-robot interaction setting. More explicitly, we present a study that involves two participants interacting with a humanoid robot, and investigate how participants' personalities can be used together with the robot's personality to predict the engagement state of each participant. The fully automatic system is first trained to predict the Big Five personality traits of each participant by extracting individual and interpersonal features from their nonverbal behavioural cues. Second, {{the output of the}} personality prediction system is used as an input to the engagement classification system. Third, we focus on the concept of 'group engagement', which we define as the collective engagement of the participants with the robot, and analyze the impact of similar and dissimilar personalities on the engagement classification. Our experimental results show that: 1) using the automatically predicted personality labels for engagement classification yields an F-measure on par with using the manually annotated personality labels, demonstrating the effectiveness of the automatic <b>personality</b> prediction <b>module</b> proposed; 2) using the individual and interpersonal features without utilizing personality information is not sufficient for engagement classification, instead incorporating the participants and robots personalities with individual/interpersonal features increases engagement classification performance; and 3) the best classi fication performance is achieved when the participants and the robot are extroverted, while the worst results are obtained when all are introverted...|$|R
5000|$|The player-character Chell is {{introduced}} to Wheatley when he revives {{her from her}} cryonic hibernation, with the intent on helping her escape the deteriorating Aperture Science facility. Wheatley then helps Chell get the blue portal gun. Wheatley leads Chell to the chamber containing the remains of GLaDOS, and accidentally reactivates GLaDOS while trying to engineer their escape. Chell is separated from Wheatley by GLaDOS and forced to perform more tests. Wheatley manages to rediscover Chell and helps her escape to maintenance areas behind the testing chambers out of GLaDOS' reach. He guides her to destroy GLaDOS' neurotoxin supply and sabotage the turret manufacturing line before returning to GLaDOS. Without these hazards to stop her, Chell follows his instructions to transfer his core into that of GLaDOS. With the threat of GLaDOS quenched, Wheatley prepares to send Chell to the surface, but he becomes power-hungry due to GLaDOS' core programming; he places GLaDOS' <b>personality</b> into a <b>module</b> powered by a potato battery and sends her and Chell {{into the depths of}} Aperture Science. As Chell and GLaDOS fall, GLaDOS reveals that Wheatley was actually meant to be a [...] "tumor", with the purpose of generating an endless stream of bad ideas in order to control her.|$|R
