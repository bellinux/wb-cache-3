5|$|Cory Shankman et al. {{examined}} {{the consequences of}} a distant massive <b>perturber</b> on the TNOs used to infer the planet's existence. They simulated clones (objects with similar orbits) of 15 objects with semi-major axis > 150 AU and perihelion > 30 AU under the influence of a 10 Earth-massed Planet Nine in Batygin and Brown's best fit orbit. While longitude of perihelion alignment of the objects with semi-major axis > 250 AU was observed in their simulations, the alignment of the arguments of perihelion was not. The simulations also revealed an increase in the inclinations of many objects, thereby predicting a larger reservoir of high-inclination TNOs. These objects should have been detected in existing surveys but are still unseen so far—suggesting there is a currently missing or unseen signature of Planet Nine. A previously published paper concluded that current observations are insufficient to identify this signature, however. The perihelia of many of the objects also rose and fell smoothly, inconsistent with the current absence of extreme TNOs with perihelia between 50 AU and 70 AU. Their perihelia also reached values where the objects would not be observed and, after declining, fell low enough for the objects to enter planet-crossing orbits leading to their ejection from the Solar System. These factors would require a population of Sednas significantly larger than current estimates, and inconsistent with current models of the early Solar System, to explain current observations. Based on these challenges Shankman et al. concluded that the existence of Planet Nine is unlikely and that the currently observed alignment of the existing TNOs is a temporary phenomenon that will disappear as more objects are detected.|$|E
25|$|The debris disk around ζ2 shows a double-lobe {{feature that}} is {{asymmetric}} in both position {{relative to the}} host star and in brightness. This feature can be explained if the disk is elliptical in shape, with an eccentricity of greater than or approximately equal to 0.3, and is seen close to edge on. Alternatively, {{it may be the}} result of clumping within the disk. In either case, it suggests that something is reshaping the disk; possibly an undetected Jupiter-like planet orbiting outside the disk or a brown dwarf within 20AU. It is unlikely that ζ1 is shaping the disk, due to the wide separation of the two stars. Simulations of the disk shape indicate that an outer perturbing planet can have a mass no greater than twice that of Jupiter and is orbiting with a periastron around 150−250AU from the star, while an inner <b>perturber</b> must have at least 10% of Jupiter's mass.|$|E

It's not that I haven't--hadn't--reserves and reactions, {{but that the}} great source of interest never failed: which great source was simply H. G. W. himself. You, really, come beautifully out of your adventure, {{come out of it}} immensely augmented and extended, like a belligerent who has annexed half-a-kingdom, with drums and trumpets and banners all sounding and flying. And this is because the thing, in our deadly day, is such a charming exhibition of complete freedom of mind. That's what I enjoyed in it--your intellectual disencumberedness; very interesting to behold as the direct fruit of training and observation. A gallant show altogether--and a gallant temper and a gallant tone. For the rest, you will be tired of hearing that, for vaticination, you, to excess, simplify. Besides, the phrophet (see how I recklessly spell him, to do him the greater honour!) must--I can't imagine a subtilizing prophet. At any rate I don't make you a reproach of simplifying, for if you hadn't I shouldn't have been able to understand you. But on the other hand I think your reader asks himself too much [...] "Where is life in all this, life as I feel it and know it?" [...] Subject of your speculations as it is, it is nevertheless too much left out. That comes partly from your fortunate youth--it's a more limited mystery for you than for the Methuselah who now addresses you. There's less of it with you to provide for, and it's less a <b>perturber</b> of your reckoning. There are for instance more kinds of people, I think, in the world--more irreducible kinds--than your categories meet. However, your categories do you, none the less, great honour, the greatest, worked out as they are; and I quite agree that, as before hinted, if one wants more life, there is Mr. Lewisham himself, of Spade House, exhaling it from every pore and in the centre of the picture. That is the great thing: he makes, Mr. Lewisham does, your heroic red-covered romance. It had to have a hero--and it has an irresistible one. Such is my criticism. I can't go further. I can't take you up in detail. I am under the charm. My world is, somehow, other; but I can't produce it. Besides, I don't want to. You can, and do, produce yours--so you've a right to talk. Finally, moreover, your book is full of truth and wit and sanity--that's where I mean you come out so well. I go to London next week for three months; but on my return, in May, I should like well to see you. What a season you must have had, with philosophy, poetry and the banker! I had a saddish letter from Gissing--but rumours of better things for him (I mean reviving powers) have come to me, I don't quite know how, since.

40|$|The {{configuration}} {{of a central}} massive object interacting gravitationally with much lighter objects around it (so called near Keplerian system) appears on many astrophysical scales. At the largest scales massive black holes (MBHs; thought to exist in {{most if not all}} galactic nuclei,) and the stellar systems around them, exemplify such systems. Close interactions of stars with MBHs lead in many cases to catastrophic outcomes; a star or a binary star could be disrupted following a close encounter with the MBH; a compact object, such as a stellar black hole, neutron stars or a white dwarf may inspiral to the MBH, through gravitational wave (GW) emission. In this Thesis the dynamics of stars and their close interactions near MBHs are studied. We explore several directions including the effects of massive <b>perturbers</b> such as giant molecular clouds on the dynamics of stars near MBHs; the close interaction of stars and binary stars with MBHs and their rates; and the origin and dynamical evolution of hypervelocity stars ejected by MBHs. We show that massive <b>perturbers</b> can accelerate relaxation processes in Galactic nuclei by orders of magnitude. Scattering of stars by such <b>perturbers</b> can explain the origin of the young stars observed very close to the MBH in the Galactic center, as well as the origin of hypervelocity stars observed in the Galactic halo. Massive <b>perturbers</b> could also have {{a major role in the}} coalescence of binary MBHs and induce their merger in short times, leading to their inspiral through GW emission, likely to be observable with future space programs. We also obtained strong constraints on the origin of hypervelocity stars, and found a novel method to use them as probes of the Galactic potential at large scales...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} {{statistical}} properties of magnification perturbations by substructures in strong lensed systems using linear perturbation theory and an analytical substructure model including tidal truncation and a continuous substructure mass spectrum. We demonstrate that magnification perturbations {{are dominated by}} <b>perturbers</b> found within a tidal radius of an image, and that sizable magnification perturbations may arise from small, coherent contributions from several substructures within the lens halo. We find that the root-mean-square (rms) fluctuation of the magnification perturbation is {approx} 10 % to {approx} 20 % and both the average and rms perturbations {{are sensitive to the}} mass spectrum and density profile of the <b>perturbers.</b> Interestingly,we find that relative to a smooth model of the same mass, the average magnification in clumpy models is lower (higher) than that in smooth models for positive (negative) parity images.

While it is possible for this discrepancy to be resolved via nonlinear <b>perturbers,</b> we argue that a more likely explanation is that the assumption that the best-fit lens model is a good proxy for the magnification in the absence of substructure is not correct.

Such tails are typically strongly curved. If a tail appears to be straight, it is probably being viewed edge-on. The stars and gas that comprise the tails will have been pulled from the easily distorted galactic discs (or other extremities) of one or both bodies, rather than the gravitationally bound galactic centres. Two very prominent examples of collisions producing tidal tails are the Mice Galaxies and the Antennae Galaxies.|$|E
