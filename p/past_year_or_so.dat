[...] Francine Cohen of the Daily Mirror commented on Becky's storylines stating: [...] "Becky’s plots have ranged from drug busts to drunken rampages, but the most poignant yet has been her recent pregnancy, miscarriage and subsequent infertility."

With the commercial success of punk and alternative rock bands in the early 1990s, All began considering offers from major labels. [...] "Major label talk started probably around '93 or '94", recalled guitarist Stephen Egerton. [...] "We maybe were just looking to sort of {{go to the next}} place, maybe. We had done this slow building up to where as many as a thousand people might be coming to see us in some places, which for us was a huge deal, so we thought we'd try to see if maybe we could get the records out to more people." [...] "In the <b>past</b> <b>year</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> we've seen bands like Green Day and Season to Risk turning up at the Walmart in Brookfield, Missouri", [...] remarked bassist Karl Alvarez. [...] "We really like the idea of getting our records in places where people go who aren't hip to the mom-and-pop record stores that traditionally carry the independents. People forget that punk rock was on the majors early on with bands like Iggy and the Ramones. The fact that the major labels ignored the real groundbreaking rock of the '80s gave everyone a real bad feeling about the majors, but as it stands now, they are starting to get a little hipper." ...|$|E

I came here to St. John's full of hope and confidence, gradually to lose both, gradually to realise that {{there was something wrong with}} me, that in spite of all my efforts I was unable to make any headway in the right direction. I became perplexed, dissatisfied--the results were so meagre, so out of proportion to the labour.
