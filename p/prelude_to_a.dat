5|$|On the February 16, 2007 {{episode of}} SmackDown! Moore {{suddenly}} switched brands, appearing in an in-ring brawl with other SmackDown! cruiserweights, {{which was a}} <b>prelude</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> Cruiserweight Open at No Way Out. Moore was eliminated from the Cruiserweight Open by the defending WWE Cruiserweight Champion Gregory Helms. Moore then {{established himself as a}} fan favorite by teaming with Scotty 2 Hotty and Jimmy Wang Yang to defeat Helms, Chavo Guerrero, and Daivari in a six-man tag team match.|$|E
5|$|The American {{command in}} Saigon and the {{politicians}} in Washington were opposed to a wet season Hmong offensive, supporting instead a holding action {{on the edge of}} the Plain of Jars as a <b>prelude</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> possible cease-fire. Washington also insisted that U.S. airpower be used to interdict PAVN supply lines, not as close air support for ground operations. Vang Pao took up the offensive anyway, but his forces could only occupy half of the Plain before his offensive sputtered out at the end of July.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of the two opposing armed forces, the Red and White Guards, imposed a state of dual power and multiple sovereignty on Finnish society, typically the <b>prelude</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> civil war. The decisive cleavage between the guards broke out during the General strike; the Reds executed several political opponents in southern Finland, and the first armed clashes between the Whites and Reds broke out. In total, 34 casualties were reported. Eventually, the political rivalries of 1917 led to a race for weapons and an escalation towards civil war.|$|E

5|$|American {{shipwreck}} hunter David Mearns {{first learned}} of the battle in 1996, and began to study it as a <b>prelude</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> search for the ships in 2001. Mearns, {{with the aid of}} other researchers, focused on primary sources (rediscovering several archive files and diaries in the process), and {{came to the conclusion that}} the German accounts were true, and that the ship would be found at the northern position. After attracting the interest of the RAN, Mearns entered into a partnership with HMAS Sydney Search, a not-for-profit company set up to administer and help fund an expedition to locate Sydney and Kormoran. State and Federal government grants totalling just under A$5 million, coupled with private and corporate donations, were used to fund a 45-day search from the end of February to early April 2008.|$|E
5|$|Between 2008 and 2010, Evancho entered talent competitions, {{sang the}} U.S. {{national}} anthem at a Pittsburgh Pirates baseball game, gave concerts with Tim Janis and David Foster, issued her first album, <b>Prelude</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> Dream, and attracted interest on YouTube. In 2010, {{at the age}} of ten, she gained wide notice with her 2nd-place finish in the fifth season of America's Got Talent. With the 2010 holiday release of her O Holy Night EP, Evancho became the best-selling debut artist of 2010, the youngest top-10 debut artist in U.S. history and the youngest solo artist ever to go platinum in the U.S. She performed at the 2010 National Christmas Tree lighting in Washington, D.C. In 2011, her first full-length album, Dream With Me, produced by Foster, debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 chart, and she became the youngest top-5 debut artist in UK history. Billboard ranked Evancho the top Classical Albums Artist for 2011. Later that year, Evancho released a full-length holiday album, Heavenly Christmas, and became the youngest person ever to give a solo concert at Lincoln Center in New York City as part of her Dream With Me Tour.|$|E
5|$|The Protestant James I, {{who became}} King of England in 1603, was less {{tolerant}} of Catholicism than his followers had hoped. Catesby therefore planned {{to kill him}} by blowing up the House of Lords with gunpowder during the State Opening of Parliament, the <b>prelude</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> popular revolt during which a Catholic monarch would be restored to the English throne. Early in 1604 he began to recruit other Catholics to his cause, including Thomas Wintour, John Wright, Thomas Percy, and Guy Fawkes. Described latterly as a charismatic and influential man, {{as well as a}} religious zealot, over the following months he helped to bring a further eight conspirators into the plot, whose naissance was planned for 5November 1605. A letter sent anonymously to William Parker, 4th Baron Monteagle, alerted the authorities, and {{on the eve of the}} planned explosion, during a search of Parliament, Fawkes was found guarding the barrels of gunpowder. News of his arrest caused the other plotters to flee London, warning Catesby along their way.|$|E

25|$|NGC 6745 is an {{irregular}} spiral galaxy in Lyra {{that is at}} a distance of 208 million light-years.

He believed that victory would prove to Kitchener that British efforts should be concentrated on the Western Front, {{and that it would be}} merely a <b>prelude</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> much larger Battle of Lille. French moved to a forward headquarters at Hazebrouck during the battle.|$|E
25|$|The {{decision}} {{to proceed with}} separate elections was unpopular among many Koreans, who rightly {{saw it as a}} <b>prelude</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> permanent division of the country. General strikes in protest against the decision began in February 1948. In April, Jeju islanders rose up against the looming division of the country. South Korean troops were sent to repress the rebellion. Tens of thousands of islanders were killed and by one estimate, 70% of the villages were burned by the South Korean troops. The uprising flared up again with the outbreak of the Korean War.|$|E
25|$|According {{to those}} who posit the {{continued}} existence of a Romanized Dacian population after the Roman withdrawal, Aurelian's decision to abandon the province was solely a military decision with respect to moving the legions and auxiliary units to protect the Danubian frontier. The civilian population of Roman Dacia did not treat this as a <b>prelude</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> coming disaster; there was no mass emigration from the province, no evidence of a sudden withdrawal of the civilian population, and no widespread damage to property {{in the aftermath of the}} military withdrawal.|$|E

25|$|Most sources put {{the start}} of the war at 27 May, while the British consul {{considered}} 29 May the actual start of full-fledged conflict. The first major outbreak of violence occurred when a 250-strong Maronite militia from Keserwan led by Taniyus Shahin went to collect the silk harvest from Naccache, but instead of returning to Keserwan, proceeded to Baabda in the al-Sahil district near Beirut. The local Druze leadership considered the Maronite mobilization at Baabda to be a provocation to the Druze in the mixed Metn district, while the Maronites saw the garrisoning of Ottoman troops under Khurshid Pasha near Naccache on 26 May as a <b>prelude</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> Druze assault. The Ottoman garrison established itself at Hazmiyeh with the support of the European consuls in order to bring order to Mount Lebanon. However, the Maronites considered it a threat since they viewed the Ottomans as allies of the Druze.|$|E
