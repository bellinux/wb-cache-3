40|$|Common control {{strategies}} used {{to regulate the}} flow of liquid through flat-plate solar collectors are discussed and evaluated using a dynamic collector model. Performance of all strategies is compared using different set points, flow rates, insolation levels and patterns (clear and cloudy days), and ambient temperature conditions. The unique characteristic of the dynamic collector model is that it includes effects of collector capacitance. In general, capacitance has a minimal effect on long term collector performance; however, short term temperature response and the energy =storage capability of collector capacitance are shown to play significant roles in comparing on/off and <b>proportional</b> <b>controllers.</b> Inclusion of these effects has produced considerably more realistic simulations than any generated by steady-state models. Simulations indicate relative {{advantages and disadvantages of}} both types of controllers, conditions under which each performs better, and the importance of pump cycling and controller set points on total energy collection. Results show that the turn-on set point is not always a critical factor in energy collection since collectors store energy while they warm up and during cycling; and, that <b>proportional</b> flow <b>controllers</b> provide improved energy collection only during periods of interrupted or very low insolation when the maximum possible energy collection is rela= tively low. Although <b>proportional</b> <b>controllers</b> initiate flow ·at lower insolation levels than on/off <b>controllers,</b> <b>proportional</b> <b>controllers</b> produce lower flow rates and higher average collector temperatures resulting in slightly lower instantaneous collection efficiencies...|$|R

40|$|Dynamic {{properties}} of robotic manipulators, including inertia, damping, and friction, limit the transparency of a haptic-feedback teleoperator. In this paper, we de-velop a position-exchange controller to provide haptic-feedback for a surgical teleoperator. The <b>controller</b> con-sists of <b>proportional</b> <b>controllers</b> and model-based feed-forward terms that cancel the dynamic {{properties of}} the manipulators. We show that the teleoperator transmits the impedance of a soft environment to the operator when the gains of the <b>proportional</b> <b>controllers</b> are very high and dynamic terms of the manipulators are can-celed. However, the high gains and complete cancel-lation of the dynamic terms of the manipulators can make the teleoperator unstable. We use Llewellyn’s cri-teria for absolute stability to limit the controller para-meters to values that keep the teleoperator stable during interactions with any passive user and environment. Experimental results using a custom version of the da Vinci Surgical System show that 70 % of the inertia of the slave manipulators during low-frequency motion and almost all static friction of the manipulators dur-ing sliding motion can be canceled. ...|$|R

At the setpoint the controller will be applying 50% power as required, but stray stored heat within the heater sub-system and in {{the walls of the}} furnace will keep the measured temperature rising beyond what is required. At 10° above SP, we reach the top of the proportional band (PB) and no power is applied, but the temperature may continue to rise even further before beginning to fall back.

New York: John Wiley) {{presents}} a novel method {{for the analysis}} of dynamical systems based on matrices of the coefficients of the systems transfer function and its ‘inners’. Here, we exploit his procedure for an analysis of a supply chain replenishment or ordering decision known as the order-up-to policy. We study the discrete-time case and generalize the classical order-up-to policy by the addition of two independent <b>proportional</b> <b>controllers</b> in the policy's feedback loops. The addition of the <b>proportional</b> <b>controllers</b> is well known to allow the order-up-to policy to eliminate the bullwhip problem and we quantify this herein using Jury's inners approach. However, care has to be taken with the use of independent controllers as they can introduce stability problems. This is because the roots of the characteristic equation become complex, and they may even move out of the unit circle in the z-plane. We identify the conditions of stability using Jury's inners approach. We also investigate further the root distribution in the characteristic equation to identify the conditions under which the order-up-to policy is aperiodic. An aperiodic system has {{only a limited number of}} maxima and minima in its dynamic response. Thus, aperiodicity is an important characteristic of a supply chain replenishment policy as it will not induce rogue seasonality...|$|R

However, the existence of switching nonlinearity and control delay can cause serious stability problem to the DAB converters. Thus, this paper, studies the stability of a digitally controlled DAB converter with an output voltage closed loop controller. Firstly, to accurately study the stability in a DAB converter, a discrete-time model established in a whole switching period is obtained. The model considers the output capacitor ESR, the digital control delay, and sample-and-hold process. By using this model, the stabilities of the DAB converter versus the <b>proportional</b> <b>controller</b> parameter and the output capacitor ESR are analyzed and the critical values are predicted accurately. Moreover, the stability boundary of the <b>proportional</b> <b>controller</b> parameter and the output capacitor ESR is also obtained.
