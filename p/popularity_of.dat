40|$|Recently, microblogging {{is widely}} studied by the {{researchers}} {{in the domain of}} the online social network (OSN). How to evaluate the <b>popularities</b> <b>of</b> microblogging users is an important research field, which can be applied to commercial advertising, user behavior analysis and information dissemination, and so forth. Previous studies on the evaluation methods cannot effectively solve and accurately evaluate the <b>popularities</b> <b>of</b> the microbloggers. In this paper, we proposed an electromagnetic field theory based model to analyze the <b>popularities</b> <b>of</b> microbloggers. The concept of the source in microblogging field is first put forward, which is based on the concept of source in the electromagnetic field; then, one’s microblogging flux is calculated according to his/her behaviors (send or receive feedbacks) on the microblogging platform; finally, we used three methods to calculate one’s microblogging flux density, which can represent one’s popularity on the microblogging platform. In the experimental work, we evaluated our model using real microblogging data and selected the best one from the three popularity measure methods. We also compared our model with the classic PageRank algorithm; and the results show that our model is more effective and accurate to evaluate the <b>popularities</b> <b>of</b> the microbloggers...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. How many listens will {{an artist}} receive on a online radio? How about plays on a YouTube video? How {{many of these}} visits are new or {{returning}} users? Modeling and mining <b>popularity</b> dynamics <b>of</b> social activity has important im-plications for researchers, content creators and providers. We here investigate the effect of revisits (successive visits from a single user) on content popularity. Using four datasets of social activity, with up to tens of millions media objects (e. g., YouTube videos, Twitter hashtags or LastFM artists), we show the effect of revisits in the <b>popularity</b> evolution <b>of</b> such objects. Secondly, we propose the PHOENIX-R model which captures the <b>popularity</b> dynamics <b>of</b> individual ob-jects. PHOENIX-R has the desired properties of being: (1) parsimonious, being based on the minimum description length principle, and achieving lower root mean squared error than state-of-the-art baselines; (2) applicable, the model is effective for predicting future <b>popularity</b> values <b>of</b> objects. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a framework for}} studying the <b>popularity</b> dynamics <b>of</b> user-generated videos, presents a characterization <b>of</b> the <b>popularity</b> dynamics, and proposes a model that captures the key properties of these dynamics. We illustrate the biases that may be introduced in the analysis for some choices of the sampling technique used for collecting data; however, sampling from recently-uploaded videos provides a dataset that is seemingly unbiased. Using a dataset that tracks the views {{to a sample of}} recently-uploaded YouTube videos over the first eight months of their lifetime, we study the popularity dynamics. We find that the relative <b>popularities</b> <b>of</b> the videos within our dataset are highly non-stationary, owing primarily to large differences in the required time since upload until peak popularity is finally achieved, and secondly to popularity oscillation. We propose a model that can accurately capture the <b>popularity</b> dynamics <b>of</b> collections of recently-uploaded videos as they age, including key measures such as hot set churn statistics, and the evolution of the viewing rate and total views distributions over time. ...|$|R
