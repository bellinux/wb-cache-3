5000|$|The bench {{front seat}} was trimmed in PVC, and the {{handbrake}} was operated by an umbrella-style <b>pull</b> <b>lever</b> under the facia (dash). The windscreen wipers used the antiquated vacuum system, {{but it came}} from a vacuum pump linked to the camshaft-driven fuel pump instead of the induction manifold as on Ford's earlier applications of this arrangement. Clearly keen to keep things positive, a 1950 road test by the British Autocar magazine reported that the wipers were [...] "free from the disadvantage of early suction-driven wipers that dried up at wide throttle opening ... and spared the battery". [...] The initial dashboard was a flat, symmetrical panel with interchangeable instrument cluster and glovebox, but from September 1952, a redesigned asymmetrical dashboard was fitted, and the instruments, consisting of speedometer, ammeter, and fuel gauge, were positioned in a housing above the steering column, with a full-width parcel shelf on which an optional radio could be placed.|$|E
50|$|In {{behavioral}} psychology, reinforcement is {{a consequence}} that will strengthen an organism's future behavior whenever that behavior is preceded by a specific antecedent stimulus. This strengthening effect may be measured as a higher frequency of behavior (e.g., <b>pulling</b> a <b>lever</b> more frequently), longer duration (e.g., <b>pulling</b> a <b>lever</b> {{for longer periods of}} time), greater magnitude (e.g., <b>pulling</b> a <b>lever</b> with greater force), or shorter latency (e.g., <b>pulling</b> a <b>lever</b> more quickly following the antecedent stimulus).|$|R

50|$|The {{controls}} in the Model AA are entirely mechanical, except {{the windshield wipers}} in later models. The brakes are mechanical and the truck has four oversized drum brakes to stop the vehicle. The mechanical system is a <b>pull</b> <b>lever</b> system that applies the force from the pedal to a pivot that pulls the brake rods that expand the brakes in the drums. The brake light is activated when the brake pedal is pushed. The brakes are proportioned more toward the rear drums. The parking brake is a chrome lever {{on the floor with}} a release button on the top. The windshield wipers started as hand operated and later models were powered by vacuum diverted from the intake manifold. The horn button is mounted {{in the middle of the}} steering wheel assembly. Controls for the lights are also incorporated into the steering assembly. The switch was a three-stop switch for parking lights, headlights and high-beams. The tail-light lens colors on the AA underwent several changes during the production run. Two levers are mounted on the steering column to adjust the engine. The left lever controls the manual advance of the timing. Adjusting the timing of the engine changes the time that a spark will occur in the combustion chamber and those changes affect the performance of the engine. The right lever is a manual control for the throttle. The throttle can be adjusted to ease the shifting of the transmission and the idling speed of the engine. Underneath the dash on the right side is the choke rod. The choke can adjust the flow of fuel from the carburetor into the engine. Turning the knob on the choke rod clockwise closes the fuel flow, leaning out the engine; turning the knob counterclockwise opens the fuel flow to the engine.|$|E
40|$|Fire alarm {{extension}} apparatuses (30, 100) permit actuation of a {{fire alarm}} pull switch (11, 21) by persons with a handicap by lowering the position at which the fire alarm pull switch (11, 21) can be actuated. The fire alarm extension apparatuses (30, 100) each comprise a clip (33, 133) for attachment to a <b>pull</b> <b>lever</b> (14, 24) of the fire alarm pull switches (11, 21). An elongated member (32, 132) {{is attached to the}} clip (33, 133) for permitting movement of the clip (33, 133) and the <b>pull</b> <b>lever</b> (14, 24) while at a position remote from the <b>pull</b> <b>lever</b> (14, 24) in a direction to permit actuation of the fire alarm pull switch (11, 21). In a first embodiment (30), the elongated member (33) is a flat rigid shaft which is mounted to a wall (31) via a mounting block (36) and is guided by dual parallel rails (37 a, 37 b) situated on the mounting block (36). Further, the lever (14, 24) is engaged by a C-shaped clip (33), and the shaft (32) has a T-shaped handle (34). In a second embodiment (100), the elongated member (132) is a coated wire which permits pivotal movement of the lever (14, 24) as well as the cover (12, 22) without mechanical stress to the apparatus (100). Further, the second embodiment has a frictional mechanism (151 b) for inhibiting movement of the cord (132) for preventing inadvertent actuation of the switch (11, 21) and a mechanism (152, 153) for ensuring that a slanted-L-shaped handle (134) remains in a desirable posture for easy grasping by a person.

40|$|A {{number of}} jurisdictions have {{been experimenting with}} new problem-oriented {{policing}} frameworks to understand and respond to gun violence among gang-involved offenders. These interventions {{are based on the}} "pulling levers" deterrence strategy that focuses criminal justice and social service attention on a small number of chronically offending gang members responsible for the bulk of urban gun violence problems. Unfortunately, there is relatively little rigorous evaluation evidence on the effectiveness of these approaches to violence prevention. In Stockton, California, an interagency task force implemented a <b>pulling</b> <b>levers</b> strategy to prevent gun homicide among gang-involved offenders. A U. S. Department of Justice-sponsored impact evaluation suggests that the <b>pulling</b> <b>levers</b> strategy was associated with a statistically significant decrease in the monthly number of gun homicide incidents in Stockton. A comparative analysis of gun homicide trends in Stockton relative to other midsize California cities also supports a unique program effect associated with the <b>pulling</b> <b>levers</b> intervention. ...|$|R
40|$|Problem-oriented {{policing}} {{strategies have}} {{been regarded as}} promising approaches for disrupting open-air drug markets in vulnerable communities. <b>Pulling</b> <b>levers</b> deterrence interventions, which {{are consistent with the}} problem-oriented framework, have shown potential as an effective mechanism for reducing and preventing youth, gun, and gang violence. This study examines the effect of a strategic, <b>pulling</b> <b>levers</b> intervention that was implemented by law enforcement officials in Rockford, Illinois, to address drug markets in a high crime neighborhood. The initiative builds on a similar effort developed in High Point, North Carolina, and represents an extension of <b>pulling</b> <b>levers</b> that was originally developed in Boston. The impact evaluation uses a mixed method of quantitative hierarchical growth curve models and qualitative interviews with residents. Study findings suggest that the Rockford strategy was associated with a statistically significant and substantive reduction in crime, drug, and nuisance offenses in the target neighborhood. Results from this examination have implications for both research and public policy...|$|R

40|$|The adapted {{recumbent}} {{project was}} to redesign a disabled veteran’s recumbent bicycle. The main areas of concern were the crank pedal, chain tension, braking and steering system, and ergonomics. Since the customer is an avid biker, this bike will be used often, so the design {{is based on the}} ease of repair and replacement. The crank system was redesigned to a lightweight, adjustable part with chain clearance and high strength. The chain tension was improved by replacing the existing single idler wheel/chain tube system with a dual idler wheel system. The dual idler has a titanium sprocket in one of the wheels and a smooth low friction surface for the other wheel. A rear mechanical disc brake was added with a locking brake lever. The locking brake was added {{to make it easier for}} the user to get in and out of the seat. A weld was made on the rear seat stay in order to place a bracket for the rear brake calipers. The front hydraulic brakes were replaced with two mechanical disc brakes with mechanical lines routed to a single dual <b>pull</b> <b>lever.</b> Additional custom seat padding was made specifically for this recumbent tricycle. Using closed cell foam in a nylon cover with sewn on straps, the new seat simply attaches to the existing seat for increased comfort. Total cost for the entire project was $ 1489. 86. A cost breakdown for each specific system is provided in the report. Testing for all implemented systems was conducted and verified using the design specifications as stated in the report. All systems have passed specified design criteria...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to gain some}} knowledge of Flying-fox (Megachiroptera: Pteropodidae) learning ability, using 10 Spectacled Flying-foxes Pteropus conspicillatus in a freeoperant conditioning paradigm. The subjects were trained to <b>pull</b> <b>levers</b> for a juice reward in the controlled environment of a modified Skinner box. All sessions were monitored and recorded on video. During {{the course of the}} experiment a difference was found in the learning behaviour between the three hand-raised and the seven wild-raised subjects. The three hand-raised Flyingfoxes learned the task in the seventh, ninth or fourteenth 10 -minute session whereas the wildraised animals did not learn to <b>pull</b> the <b>levers.</b> When returned to the experimental chamber more than three years later two of the hand-reared subjects immediately <b>pulled</b> the <b>levers</b> to receive juice.
