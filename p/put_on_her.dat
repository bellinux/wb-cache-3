5|$|The Flapper awoke {{from her}} {{lethargy}} of sub-deb-ism, bobbed her hair, <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> choicest pair of earrings {{and a great}} deal of audacity and rouge and went into the battle. She flirted because it was fun to flirt and wore a one-piece bathing suit because she had a good figure... she was conscious that the things she did were the things she had always wanted to do. Mothers disapproved of their sons taking the Flapper to dances, to teas, to swim and most of all to heart.|$|E
25|$|She {{finds out}} that Zachariah is {{actually}} alive and {{has been living in}} the jail of the Seahawk with the help of another sailor, Keetch, who supplies him with food. With Zachariah's help, she escapes the prison and plans to steal the captain's guns and usurp his title. Instead, she finds the captain waiting for her. The Captain says that he has been waiting for her all along. Keetch had told him everything. Jaggery reveals that he himself had killed Hollybrass, but claims that he had been threatened and {{had no choice but to}} murder him. Not wanting to lose his title, he blames the death on Charlotte. He tells her she has three choices. She can 1) take the muskets and disrespect her family and herself by killing Captain Jaggery, 2) <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> proper clothing and wait at the docks like a proper lady, forgetting all about the fights, and begging him for mercy in front of the crew, or 3) consent to be hanged. She refuses to take any of the choices, and flees the cabin. Jaggery attempts to kill her in front of the crew, but falls off the ship's bowsprit to his death while chasing Charlotte, despite Charlotte's awkward attempt to save him. Zachariah tells the crew that a new captain must be named, and that it should be Charlotte, because she has done what they could not. She is elected by the crew, but serves primarily as a figurehead due to her lack of experience. Zachariah openly exercises the powers of the captain, after she insists on it. They land in Providence, Rhode Island, 12 hours later.|$|E

[...] McGurk writes that [...] "It's as though she <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> psychoanalytically oriented, professional hat and ran a tape that was far from being effective." [...] A review in Publishers Weekly states that Fenwick's [...] "inbred detachment may have kept her from the full impact of the 'experience' the training was meant to be (and is for many)". [...] Even so, the review notes that Fenwick [...] "scores heavily" [...] in the section where she questions the nature of the est training and Erhard's background; it recommends that Getting It be read alongside Luke Rhinehart's The Book of est.|$|E

500|$|The {{process of}} {{creating}} the song began in the recording studio one morning at around 4:00a.m., when Timbaland recommended that Furtado should go home because she was tired. Furtado, who had heard that the band U2 (a band she says she deeply admires) wrote many of their songs in the studio control room, said [...] "Really? I'll show you", <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> hoodie and began to [...] "jam". Nate Hills and Timbaland soon joined her, writing and producing as they went, and according to Furtado, this process intensified as she sang. The team used four microphones in the live room and moved them around during recording, about which Furtado said, [...] "...when you listen to it—there's a lot of dimension. It kind of sounds like [...] in another country". Afterwards, they picked the best vocals and [...] "perfected" [...] them, before inserting [...] "reverbs and weird alien sounds" [...] onto them.

500|$|Dan Casey at Nerdist {{found the}} adage [...] "third {{time is the}} charm" [...] {{to apply to the}} episode, feeling that [...] "Rather than {{trying to figure out where}} it fits within Marvel’s grander {{on-screen}} universe, S.H.I.E.L.D. is focusing its energy on developing the eponymous agents and giving us more backstory", and though he felt that [...] "The show still needs to figure out its balance of seriousness and humor", he concluded that the [...] "show just keeps getting better." [...] James Hunt at Den of Geek felt that [...] "There's a distinct feeling of treading water", finding the episodic plot to be [...] "fairly by-the-numbers for a show that's supposed to be about the fantastic", and he was disappointed in [...] "Graviton's non-appearance appearance", referring to the lack of Hall's comics' alter-ego. Marc Bernardin of The Hollywood Reporter praised the episode's opening sequence, but criticized the character Skye and the focus the episode <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> rather than Coulson. He also spoke unfavorably of Quinn, noting that Hall would likely return as a villain himself in the future, but [...] "until then, S.H.I.E.L.D. needs to up its adversarial game". Jim Steranko, known for his work on Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D., felt [...] "the plot’s twists and turns clicked, even though it’s kind of embarrassing when the commercials are more engrossing than the show." ...|$|E
500|$|On the February 9, 2011, {{episode of}} The Ellen DeGeneres Show, singers Justin Bieber and James Blunt {{performed}} their own {{rendition of the}} song along with DeGeneres, improvising the music, while singing the chorus. During the show, Gaga confirmed via telephone, that she would perform [...] "Born This Way" [...] on February 13, 2011, at the 53rd Grammy Awards. Gaga arrived at the ceremony in a giant incubating vessel that was carried onto the red carpet by numerous fashion models. She later emerged from another bigger egg on stage, dressed in a high ponytail, gold bra top and long skirt, with black and gold makeup and pointed shoulders and horns protruding from her face. The [...] "Born This Way" [...] performance was introduced by Ricky Martin. In the first few seconds after performing the intro of the song, Gaga emerged from the egg, and after the first chorus, she whipped {{her hair in a}} manner similar to singer Willow Smith. Before the [...] "No matter gay, straight or bi" [...] line of the song, an organ emerged from the stage floor. Gaga played the music on the organ, which was surrounded by mannequin heads submerged in gel, before belting out the rest of the bridge as her dancers surrounded her. Before leaving the stage, Gaga <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> trench and hat as the song faded out and Gaga and her dancers ended the performance with their hands put up in paws.|$|E

500|$|The album {{opens with}} [...] "Roar", a midtempo synth-driven power pop track. Musically, it {{contains}} elements of arena rock and glam rock, while lyrically {{it is an}} empowerment anthem. Comparisons were established between [...] "Roar" [...] and [...] "Brave" [...] by Sara Bareilles. [...] "Legendary Lovers", a bhangra-based song, deals {{with the ideas of}} karma and infinity. [...] "Birthday" [...] was described by Perry as her own attempt at [...] "writing something Mariah Carey would have <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> first record". Musically, it is a [...] "fluffy" [...] pop song that is primarily styled in the genre of disco. [...] "Walking on Air", the album's second promotional single, is an early 1990s-inspired deep house-Eurodance-disco song, inspired heavily by CeCe Peniston and Crystal Waters. It was produced by Klas Åhlund and Max Martin. [...] "Unconditionally", Perry's personal favorite song on the album and second official single, is a [...] "soaring" [...] power ballad with an [...] "epic chorus". Jason Lipshutz from Billboard noted that the song includes a [...] "woodblock percussion" [...] as well as [...] "a dramatic bass line" [...] and deemed it the album's [...] "most mature offering". Furthermore, he called it [...] "an ode to love that looks past all flaws" [...] and stated that the song acts as a [...] "compellingly grounded predicate" [...] to the title track from Teenage Dream. Perry herself described the song as a song about unconditional love that could come in all forms, including those from relationships, from parent-to-child, and from sibling-to-sibling.|$|E

At the funeral Marcela appears, vindicating herself from the bitter verses written about her by Grisóstomo, and claiming her own autonomy and freedom from expectations <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> by pastoral clichés.

The Galicians hit Rocinante with clubs to dissuade him, whereupon Don Quixote tries to defend Rocinante. The Galicians beat Don Quixote and Sancho, leaving them in great pain.|$|E

She had not <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> seatbelt because she was planning a parachute jump {{for the next day}} and wanted to look over the cockpit sill to examine the terrain. About ten minutes into the flight the plane unexpectedly went into a dive and then a spin. Coleman was thrown from the plane at [...] and died instantly when she hit the ground. William Wills was unable to regain control of the plane and it plummeted to the ground. Wills died upon impact and the plane exploded and burst into flames. Although the wreckage of the plane was badly burned, it was later discovered that a wrench used to service the engine had jammed the controls. Coleman was 34 years old.|$|E
