In order to validate the advanced NDT equipments like Radar and <b>Pulse</b> <b>Echo,</b> a unique large scale reinforced concrete specimen was cast at SERC, Chennai, with columns and beams of different sizes, cross section having different percentages of reinforcement. The defects such as honeycombs, cracks, delamination, presence of conduits, ducts, etc. were also incorporated while casting the large scale reinforced cement concrete specimen. In the present study, the top and bottom slabs were investigated by dividing into grid lines of 50 x 50 mm in both the direction using radar and <b>pulse</b> <b>echo</b> techniques.

40|$|<b>Pulse</b> <b>echo</b> signals {{measured}} in ultrasonic NDT include {{the effect of}} the measuring systems, the propagation paths taken by the ultrasonic waves, and are corrupted by additive noise. For instance, the ultrasonic signals for a particular reflector recorded under the same conditions, but using different transducers can be quiet different. This leads to the difficulty of comparing and analyzing signals particularly in automated defect identification systems employing different transducers. Generally, it is assumed that the measured <b>pulse</b> <b>echo</b> is obtained by linearly convolving the defect impulse response with the measured system response. Deconvolution operation therefore, seeks to undo {{the effect of the}} convolution and extract the defect impulse response which is an essential step for the identification and characterization of defects. Conventional deconvolution techniques such as least square, Wiener filter, and minimum variance deconvolution [1] are based on a priori knowledge of second-order statistics (SOS) of the noise and the input signal. In practice however, ultrasonic <b>pulse</b> <b>echo</b> signals are found to be non-minimum phase systems and the acoustic noise due to scattering from the grains inside the propagation medium does not have a readily known statistic [2]. SOS-based deconvolution techniques, being phase-blind cannot therefore, accurately estimate the defect impulse response...|$|R

40|$|The {{porosity}} {{content in}} composite material {{is known to}} influence {{the strength of the}} material. It is therefore of interest to monitor the porosity contents during manufacturing. Since attenuation and porosity are related, traditional porosity determination in composites is performed as attenuation measurements using ultrasonic tone burst through-transmission. In this paper we propose a multivariable regression approach for estimating ultrasound attenuation in composite materials by means of pulse-echo measurements, thus overcoming the problems with limited access that is the main drawback of through-transmission testing. The result from the work shows that we can obtain good approximations of the attenuation values using <b>pulse</b> <b>echo</b> ultrasound. This indicates that {{it will be possible to}} replace the through-transmission technique by a <b>pulse</b> <b>echo</b> technique.

40|$|Thesis (MTech (Electrical Engineering)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2009 In acoustics, <b>pulse</b> <b>echo</b> {{methods are}} well known {{as a means of}} {{measuring}} time of Hight. Traditional techniques for generating acoustic waves in solid ferromagnetic waveguides include piezoelectric, capacitive and magnetostriction. Piezoelectric and capacitive techniques are preferred due to the inefficiency of magnetostriction caused by electro-mechanical coupling losses and the fact that most ferromagnetic materials show low levels of magnetostriction. The aim {{of this study was to}} optimise the magnetostrictive effects for sensing applications based on a ferromagnetic waveguide using the <b>pulse</b> <b>echo</b> method. The results obtained were implemented in the design of an acoustic thermometer. Two configurations for signal generation and recovery were examined, the use of a single wound copper coil acting as a transceiver coil, and the use of separate transmit and receive coils. Results obtained using the latter configuration indicated better signal to noise ratio's and provided the flexibility to manipulate the point of signal recovery. The <b>pulse</b> <b>echo</b> method was implemented and optimised. An acoustic thermometer based on an existing design was developed by inducing a partial reflection from a set position in the waveguide, defining a sensing probe. Awareness of the elastic properties of the waveguide material enabled the guaging of its temperature by measuring the acoustic pulse velocity in the probe. The accuracy of the instrument was increased through signal conditioning, examined together with cross correlation and an increased sampling frequency. Systematic errors were resolved through calibration, giving the instrument an overall accuracy of ±O. 56 "C for the range of temperatures between 2 O"C and 400 "C...|$|R
