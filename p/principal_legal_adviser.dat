Donoghue began her career with the State Department in 1984 as an attorney for the Office of Inter-American Affairs and held a variety of positions before becoming the <b>principal</b> deputy <b>legal</b> <b>adviser</b> in 2007. This included serving as assistant <b>legal</b> <b>adviser</b> for oceans, environment and science; director of the Office of Diplomatic Law and Litigation; assistant <b>legal</b> <b>adviser</b> for African affairs; and assistant <b>legal</b> <b>adviser</b> for economic and business affairs. She also has held several positions outside of the State Department, including deputy general counsel for the U. S.
