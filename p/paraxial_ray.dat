40|$|We {{study the}} {{propagation}} of <b>rays,</b> <b>paraxial</b> <b>rays,</b> and Gaussian beams in a medium where slowness differs only slightly {{from that of a}} reference medium. Ray theory is developed using a Hamiltonian formalism that is independent of the coordinate system under consideration. Let us consider a ray in the unperturbed medium. The perturbation in slowness produces a change of the trajectory of this ray which may be calculated by means of canonical perturbation theory. We define <b>paraxial</b> <b>rays</b> as those rays that propagate in perturbed medium {{in the vicinity of the}} perturbed ray. The ray tracing equation for <b>paraxial</b> <b>rays</b> may be obtained by a linearization of the canonical ray equations. The linearized equations are then solved by a propagator method. With the help of the propagator we form beams, i. e. families of <b>paraxial</b> <b>rays</b> that depend on a single beam parameter. The results are very general and may be applied to a number of kinematic and dynamic ray tracing problems, like two-point ray tracing, Gaussian beams, wave front interpolation, etc. The perturbation methods are applied to the study of a few simple problems in which the unperturbed medium is homogeneous. First, we consider a two-dimensional spherical inclusion with a Gaussian slowness perturbation profile. Second, transmission and reflection problems are examined. We compare results for amplitude and travel time computed by exact and perturbed ray theory. The agreement is excellent and may be improved using an iterative procedure by which we change the reference unperturbed ray whenever the perturbation becomes large. Finally, we apply our technique to a three-dimensional problem: we calculate the amplitude perturbation and ray deflection produced by the velocity structure under the Mont Dore volcano (central France). Again a comparison shows excellent agreement between exact and perturbed ray theory...|$|R

30|$|We have {{considered}} super-Gaussian beam profile having maximum intensity on the axis and minimum intensity {{away from the}} axis. As the laser beam propagates in the gas to form the plasma, the plasma density should stay maximum on the axis which should result in minimum refractive index on the axis. Since the phase velocity of the lasers depends inversely on the refractive index, the phase velocity becomes maximum on the axis and falls down sharply on the edges. This {{would lead to a}} diverging wavefront, causing the laser beam to defocus. Kumar and Tripathi [6] observed the self-defocusing of Gaussian laser pulse based on the <b>paraxial</b> <b>ray</b> theory in tunnel ionized helium plasma. Liu and Tripathi [7] also observed the self-defocusing of Gaussian beam based on the <b>paraxial</b> <b>ray</b> theory in tunnel ionized neon plasma. However, we point out that the use of this theory in the case of super-Gaussian lasers beams provides an unphysical result of self-focusing of these beams.

Development measures to protect the image plane from stray light and harmful flows with minimal vignetting and screening {{is one of the most}} perspective ways for improving the image quality objectives. The only method to eliminate or even reduce these non-constructive rays is to set glare stops. The aim of the work was an improving method for constructing a glare stop to protect the image plane and the creation of a calculation algorithm of glare stop for protecting the image plane based on two-mirror extra-focal objectives. The study was conducted in two stages. In the course of the first stage, the positions of screening and intermediate image plane were obtained, as well as the central screening coefficient.
