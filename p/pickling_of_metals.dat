30|$|Mild steel {{has been}} {{extensively}} used in several applications including constructions of tanks, petroleum refineries equipment and flow lines as well as transmission pipelines due to its ease of fabrication and low cost [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. However, it is vastly exposed to corrosion and deterioration especially in acidic media. In metallurgical industry, hydrochloric acid is widely applied in various processes such as <b>pickling</b> and descaling <b>of</b> <b>metals,</b> chemical or electrochemical processes in oil refinery as well as deactivation of equipment in atomic power establishments’. Various corrosion controlling methods were used to protect metals such as protective coatings, cathodic protection {{and the use of}} corrosion inhibitors [7]. Among these methods, the latter {{is one of the most}} practical methods especially in acidic media. Such inhibitors can significantly decrease the corrosion rate when added to a corrosive environment in small concentrations [8, 9, 10].|$|R
30|$|The {{corrosion}} <b>of</b> <b>metals,</b> including mild steel, is {{a serious}} problem in many industries, especially during processes such as the <b>pickling</b> <b>of</b> steel, acid washing and etching [1, 2]. Corrosion inhibitors are chemical compounds that in small quantities can use in these processes to control the metal dissolutions. Most popular inhibitors are organic compound containing N, S, and O atoms. Organic compounds containing functional electronegative groups and π electrons in triple or conjugated double bonds are usually good inhibitors. The study of corrosion process and their inhibition by organic compounds is a very active field of research [3, 4, 5].|$|R

40|$|<b>Pickling</b> <b>of</b> {{oxidised}} 304 {{stainless steel}} in single or multiple electrolytes was investigated based on weight loss and corrosion potential measurements. A smooth surface finish was obtained after an extended pickling in HCl, but some external oxide scales remained. On pickling in HF, the external oxide scales were fully removed, but internal oxide scales remained, and intergranular corrosion took place. Multi-step pickling in successive HCl and HF electrolytes allowed achieving a smooth surface finish free of any oxide scales. The sequence and duration <b>of</b> <b>pickling</b> steps in such multi-step pickling greatly influenced the final surface finish. Corrosion potential of oxidised stainless steel in both electrolytes could differ, and that difference leaded to a uniform <b>pickling</b> <b>of</b> stainless steel in HCl and a localised pickling in HF.

30|$|Corrosion is {{the process}} whereby metals and alloys lose their useful {{properties}} {{as a result of}} a reaction with the surrounding environment. The definition of corrosion is not limited to metals and alloys, but the term, corrosion, can be extended to include ceramics and other nonmetallic materials. Corrosion leads to major problems in most industrial fields [1]. In the recent years, corrosion becomes one of the most challenging topics for scientists and the engineering society. From the standpoint of the importance <b>of</b> <b>metals</b> in industry, carbon steel is considered to be the <b>metal</b> <b>of</b> choice due to its distinctive characteristics, besides the wide application aspects. In several industrial processes such as acid cleaning, acid well acidizing, and acid pickling, rust and contaminated scales were generally removed using acid solutions. Moreover, hydrochloric acid can be produced as a byproduct of crude oil desalting process and some oil refinery treatments [2]. Hydrochloric and sulphuric acids are the most widely used mineral acids in the <b>pickling</b> processes <b>of</b> <b>metals</b> [3]. It is generally known that the spontaneous dissolution of iron in acid solution produces Fe 2 + ions, which corresponds to the anodic reaction, accompanied by discharging of electrons by hydrogen evolution at cathodic sites on the <b>metal</b> surface. Because <b>of</b> the general destructive attack of acid solutions, the use of inhibitors to control the aggressiveness of acid environment was found to have widespread applications in many industries [4]. The feasibility of protection methods depend mainly on the conditions and surrounding environment that materials, particularly metals, experienced during service conditions. The use of corrosion inhibitor to minimize corrosion rate in closed service system is well-established and generally accepted [5, 6, 7, 8]. In literature, several organic compounds have been reported as potential corrosion inhibitor for different metals, but on the other hand, ecological and healthy problems have been arisen because of using such synthetic compounds. In recent years, considerable amount of effort devoted to find low cost and efficient corrosion inhibitors from natural resources such as plant extracts that can be used as promising alternative sources for corrosion inhibitors [9, 10, 11, 12]. Several studies reports the use of plant extracts as potential agents to reduce corrosion in various industrial solutions [13, 14, 15]. Inhibitors extracted from plants are renewable resources, readily available, acceptable and friendly for human and environment [11]. To our knowledge, there seems no results have been reported in the literature for using Tilia cordata as corrosion inhibitor. The present work provide an investigation on using an aqueous extract, simply prepared from the leaves of Tilia cordata, as a green corrosion inhibitor to control the corrosion behavior of carbon steel in hydrochloric acid solutions.|$|R

30|$|Acid {{solutions}} generally {{used for}} the removal of rust and scale in industrial processes and the deterioration <b>of</b> <b>metal</b> due to these processes are very significant. Inhibitors are used in these processes to control metal dissolution. Hydrochloric acid is widely used in the <b>pickling</b> <b>of</b> steel and different steel-based alloys[1, 2]. One way of protecting steel from corrosion is to use corrosion inhibitors. Organic compounds containing heteroatoms are commonly used to reduce the corrosion attack on steel in acidic media[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]. The recent trend is towards environmentally friendly inhibitors. Most of the natural products are non-toxic, biodegradable, and readily available in plenty. These advantages have incited us to draw a large part of our laboratory program to examine natural substances as corrosion inhibitors such as fennel oil[17], prickly pear seed oil[18], argan extract[18, 19, 20, 21], argan oil[19, 22], rosemary oil[23, 24, 25], Thymus oil[26, 27], pennyroyal mint oil[28], lavender oil[29], jojoba oil[30], and Artemisia[31, 32, 33].|$|R
