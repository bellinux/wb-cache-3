40|$|The <b>property</b> <b>tax</b> {{is almost}} everyone’s {{choice for the}} {{principal}} local government tax revenue source in developing countries. The focus of public policy on this tax, and the interest it has drawn from public finance scholars and practitioners are evidence of its importance. Moreover, both external donors and national governments have invested significant money in strengthening its administration. Despite all of the good work {{that has been done}} in designing more efficient <b>property</b> <b>tax</b> structures and administrations however, <b>property</b> <b>tax</b> revenues account for {{less than one percent of}} GDP and less than 4 percent of all tax revenues in developing countries. In terms of revenue mobilization in developing countries, the <b>property</b> <b>tax</b> is an afterthought. But the interest continues. In this paper we propose a different paradigm for <b>property</b> <b>tax</b> reform in developing countries.

We find that replacing the <b>property</b> <b>tax</b> with a sales or income tax has a relatively small effect on aggregate economic variables. Aggregate output in the state decreases by 2 to 3 percent. Larger effects are apparent when analyzing household groups and industry sectors. Replacing the <b>property</b> <b>tax</b> with a sales or income tax decreases household income by over three percent with the income tax being most regressive.

5|$|The {{financing}} plan involved {{public and private}} funding. At the time, the city planned to pay $75million for the acquisition {{of the land and}} construction of the stadium project. However, a 2017 audit revealed that it had actually paid $91million after accounting for additional costs associated with the expedited schedule and infrastructure work around the project site. The stadium is owned by the city and is leased to the team for 30years, until 2045. The Sounds ownership group spent $50million on a new, mixed-use and retail development next to the facility. The construction of two apartment buildings with retail space beyond the left field wall is scheduled to be completed in early 2018. North of the site, Embrey Development Corp. built a privately funded apartment complex called The Carillon. The city's original $75million planned expenditure resulted in taking on $4.3million in annual debt, paid for by five city revenue streams: an annual $700,000 Sounds' lease payment, $650,000 in stadium-generated sales tax revenue, $750,000 in <b>property</b> <b>taxes</b> from the Sounds development, $675,000 in <b>property</b> <b>taxes</b> from the Embrey development, and $520,000 in tax increment financing.
