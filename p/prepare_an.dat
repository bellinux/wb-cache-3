Taking advantage of the weakened White Tower defenses following the Seanchan raid, the rebels <b>prepare</b> <b>an</b> immediate attack. Just before the attack is mounted, the Tower Aes Sedai announce that Elaida was captured in the Seanchan raid, {{and that they would}} have Egwene as their leader, the Amyrlin Seat. The rebels return and they begin rebuilding the Tower.|$|E
5|$|Gambira faced a {{total of}} sixteen charges {{for his role in}} the protests, {{including}} membership in an unlawful association and illegal movement across borders. In October 2008, Gambira's lawyer, Aung Thein, resigned from his case, saying that the military government would not allow him the materials to <b>prepare</b> <b>an</b> adequate defence. On one occasion, Gambira refused to appear in court himself, stating that the trial of a forcibly disrobed monk was disrespectful to Buddhism.|$|E
5|$|The {{case was}} {{automatically}} {{appealed to the}} Utah Supreme Court, which upheld Taylor's conviction and sentence in October 1991. Taylor's execution was initially scheduled for January 15, 1992. The date was rescheduled to June 24 when Taylor's attorney Martin Gravis requested {{to withdraw from the}} case. On June 17, Judge Roth granted a stay of execution after Taylor's new defense attorney Ron Yengich requested more time to <b>prepare</b> <b>an</b> appeal. At issue was a new 1992 law in Utah that established the sentence of life imprisonment without parole.|$|E

5|$|The prime {{motivation}} behind Magnús' {{cooperation with}} Ælfgar is uncertain. One {{possibility is that}} he was attempting to establish Norwegian authority in the west as a means to <b>prepare</b> <b>an</b> invasion of England. In so doing, Magnús may have backed the cause of a local faction that opposed Echmarcach. Certainly, the thirteenthfourteenth-century Chronicle of Mann records that Ímar's apparent son, Gofraid Crobán (died 1095)a future ruler of Dublin and the Islesbacked the Norwegian invasion of England led by Magnús' father in 1066.|$|E
5|$|After the conflict, the Pakistani {{government}} {{decided on a}} policy of silence regarding the rapes. They set up the Hamoodur Rahman Commission, a judicial commission to <b>prepare</b> <b>an</b> account of {{the circumstances surrounding the}} atrocities of the 1971 war and Pakistan's surrender. The commission was highly critical of the army. The chiefs of staff of the army and the Pakistan Air Force were removed from their positions for attempting to interfere with the commission. The Commission based its reports on interviews with politicians, officers and senior commanders. The final reports were submitted in July 1972, but all were subsequently destroyed except for one held by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the Pakistani president. The findings were never made public.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{initially}} agreed to these demands, on January 17, 1868, Yoshinobu {{declared that he}} would not be bound by the Restoration proclamation and called for its rescission. On January 24, he decided to <b>prepare</b> <b>an</b> attack on Kyoto, occupied by Satsuma and Chōshū forces. This decision was prompted by his learning of a series of arsons in Edo, starting with the burning of the outerworks of Edo Castle, the main Tokugawa residence. This was blamed on Satsuma rōnin, who on that day attacked a government office. The next day shogunate forces responded by attacking the Edo residence of the daimyō of Satsuma, where many opponents of the shogunate, under Takamori's direction, had been hiding and creating trouble. The palace was burned down, and many opponents killed or later executed.|$|E

5|$|By 1August 1944, the British {{had made}} {{significant}} gains on the Vire and Orne Rivers during Operation Bluecoat, while the Americans had achieved a complete {{breakthrough in the}} west. On 4August, Simonds and General Harry Crerar—newly appointed commander of the First Canadian Army—were given the order to <b>prepare</b> <b>an</b> advance on Falaise. Three days later, with heavy bomber support, Operation Totalize began, marking the first use of Kangaroo Armoured Personnel Carriers. While the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division attacked east of the Caen–Falaise Road, 2nd Division attacked to the west. By noon Verrières Ridge had finally fallen, and Canadian and Polish armour was preparing to exploit south towards Falaise. However, strong resistance by the 12th SS Panzer Division and the 272nd Volksgrenadier Division halted the advance. Although 12km (7.5mi) of ground had been gained, Canadian forces had failed to reach Falaise itself.|$|E
5|$|The raid was {{the third}} of series of actions {{intended}} to eliminate the threat posed to British trade routes by the Dutch squadron: at the Action of 26 July 1806 and the Action of 18 October 1806, British frigates sent on reconnaissance missions to the region succeeded in attacking and capturing two Dutch frigates {{and a number of}} other vessels. The raid reduced the effectiveness of Batavia as a Dutch base, but the continued presence of the main Dutch squadron at Griessie concerned Pellew and he led a second operation the following year to complete his defeat of the Dutch. Three years later, with the French driven out of the western Indian Ocean, British forces in the region were strong enough to <b>prepare</b> <b>an</b> expeditionary force against the Dutch East Indies, which effectively ended the war in the east.|$|E
5|$|They {{considered}} {{creating an}} Allied plan {{to counter the}} danger, but Whiteley {{said that he would}} have to consult with the British command before this could be approved. Colonel G. S. Eyster from G-3 was then ordered to <b>prepare</b> <b>an</b> American plan, under the codename Operation Peppermint. Further briefings were given to Admiral Harold Stark, and Lieutenant Generals Carl Spaatz and John C. H. Lee, and Eisenhower also wrote to Lieutenant General Hastings Ismay, the Chief of Staff of the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Winston Churchill to inform the British Chiefs of Staff, but no British or American commanders actually participating in Operation Overlord were informed. The British subsequently adopted a similar plan to Operation Peppermint, and SHAEF assumed responsibility for coordinating the British and American efforts. Scientific assistance was provided by the Cavendish Laboratory.|$|E

5|$|Fishermen of the Canary Islands had {{to return}} to and remain in port for several days while {{weathering}} the storm, and this disruption was blamed for a 10–15% reduction of the islands' tuna catch. Tropical Storm Delta also had some further-reaching effects. The political opposition Popular Party challenged that the impact of Tropical Storm Delta proved the need for the island to <b>prepare</b> <b>an</b> emergency plan to deal with natural and man-made disasters. Only five of the island's many municipalities had an emergency plan, and there was no coordination across the entire island chain. Delta also served to highlight the islands' aging power grid, prompting the regional director general of industry and energy to consider building another power plant on the archipelago. The storm sparked a vigorous debate on the island about the effects of global climate change, how they will affect the islands, and how these effects can be avoided.|$|E
5|$|In 1566 the Burgundian Netherlands, Charles V of Habsburg's {{original}} realm, {{which had}} passed {{to his son}} Philip II of Spain on his abdication in 1556, were in disarray due to religious tensions between Protestants and Catholics and the nobility and cities' unwillingnes of funding Philip's wars and ceding its powers to the Royal administration. In 1567 Philip sent an army to the Netherlands under Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, Duke of Alba, to restore his authority, but Alba's persecution of the religious and political dissenters led William of Orange, {{the leader of the}} nobility, to exile into Germany and <b>prepare</b> <b>an</b> invasion of the Netherlands to expel Alba. Orange invaded the Netherlands twice, in 1568 and 1572, but in both occasions Alba defeated him. The second time, however, the revolt spread into the provinces of Holland and Zealand, and Alba was unable of quelling it. In 1576, the lack of an authority due to the death of Alba's successor Luis de Requesens, together with a Spanish general bankruptcy, led the Spanish mutinuous soldiers to sack several towns, including Antwerp. In reaction, the loyal and rebel provinces united to expel the foreign troops under the Pacification of Ghent.|$|E
5|$|While Rowley and Hamelin had sparred in the Indian Ocean, Corbet {{had made}} the lengthy journey back to Britain. During his time in command of Nereide, Corbet had already {{developed}} {{a reputation as a}} strict disciplinarian, regularly beating his men for the slightest infractions, {{to the extent that he}} had provoked a brief mutiny on Nereide in 1808. His reputation spread before him, and when he switched commands with Captain Richard Raggett of HMS Africaine, he was met with a storm of protest from Africaines crew. Although none of the men aboard Africaine had served with Corbet before, his preference for brutal punishment was well known in the Navy and the crew sent a letter to the Admiralty insisting that they would not serve under him. Concerned at what they considered to be mutiny, the Admiralty sent three popular officers to Africaine with the message that if the protest was quietly dropped there would be no courts-martial for mutiny but if not, the entire crew would be liable to attack. To emphasise the threat, the frigate HMS Menelaus was brought alongside with her gunports open and her cannon ready to fire. Chastened, the crew of Africaine allowed Corbet aboard and the frigate sailed for the Indian Ocean a few days later, carrying instructions for the authorities at Madras to <b>prepare</b> <b>an</b> expeditionary force to invade Isle de France.|$|E

5|$|The {{experience}} held {{a number}} of lessons for the Australians, not least {{of all was the}} need for tanks. Although the APCs had been used to support the infantry during the operation, they lacked the firepower and armour to be an effective substitute for tanks which would likely have found the terrain and vegetation no obstacle and may have proven decisive. Meanwhile, the futility and waste of frontal tactics and massed bayonet charges against automatic weapons had once again been demonstrated. Yet such lessons still had not been fully grasped by Australian Army training doctrine, and under pressure from Townsend to press on with the attack Mackay had given the order to fix bayonets and charge due to the proximity of his forward platoons to the Viet Cong. Despite having long since ceased to be a decisive weapon of warfare, when ordered the Australians had unhesitatingly charged towards the Viet Cong machine-guns in the certainty of suffering casualties. As a result of their bravery 5 Platoon {{became one of the most}} highly decorated Australian platoons of the war. Yet aggression alone could not overcome concentrated firepower, and many survivors were later bitter about the order and losses suffered in these attempts. Another lesson identified included the need to thoroughly <b>prepare</b> <b>an</b> unsecure landing zone by fire prior to insertion. Likewise, during the initial contact A Company had been unable to call in artillery, and the need for a dedicated command and control helicopter to co-ordinate indirect fire during an airmobile assault was also evident.|$|E
