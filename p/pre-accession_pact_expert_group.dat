40|$|In every {{political}} system {{there is an}} inbuilt tension between how a government {{is supposed to be}} organized and operate and how it really functions. The official version of how a government is organized is always complemented and sometimes even contradicted by an informal version. How the informal structure or the shadow world of government is formatted, and by whom, is of crucial importance for how power and influence is distributed in a {{political system}}. This study has carried out an analysis of one part of the informal structure of the EU and its relationship with the formal structure. Thus the focus of the study has been on <b>expert</b> <b>groups</b> and their primary instigator-the Commission. In this framework three questions have been raised. Firstly, taking into account the Commission's tight to set up <b>expert</b> <b>groups,</b> to what extent is this tool used and what type of <b>expert</b> <b>groups</b> ere set up? Secondly, by what means does the Commission-in organizational terms-control the work of the <b>expert</b> <b>groups?</b> Thirdly, why ere <b>expert</b> <b>groups</b> set up and in what way can <b>expert</b> <b>groups</b> be used to model the decision-making structure of the EU...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{answers the}} {{following}} question: Do the uncertainty and salience of issues {{determine whether the}} European Commission will use an <b>expert</b> <b>group</b> to assist with policy formulation? Using rationalist theory, three hypotheses test whether transversality, the importance of standard-setting and the salience of a policy proposal determine whether a Commission DG will ask an <b>expert</b> <b>group</b> to assist in preparing that same proposal. Data was retrieved from official docu-ments via EUR-Lex. A binary logistic regression analysis has been conducted on a sample of 260 proposals that were drafted by DG Climate Action, DG Communications Networks, Content & Technology, DG Environment and DG Internal Market and Services. All proposals were adopted between 2010 and 2013. The empirical analysis shows that <b>expert</b> <b>group</b> involvement in policy formulation is neither negligible nor ubiquitous in terms of frequency as <b>expert</b> <b>groups</b> as-sisted in preparing 33. 5 % of the proposals. DGs {{were significantly more likely}} to consult an <b>expert</b> <b>group</b> when the pro-posal under preparation was more transversal in nature and/or when that proposal treated standard-setting more pro-nouncedly. In contrast, the salience of a proposal was shown to be insignificantly related to the presence of an <b>expert</b> <b>group</b> during policy formulation...|$|R
