50|$|The {{phenomenon}} that conspecifics are attacked and eaten after, during {{and sometimes even}} before copulation is called sexual cannibalism. Many examples are known in various groups of invertebrates including the mantids. There are some speculations {{about the benefits of}} this behavior but its causes are not fully understood yet.For quite some time the belief that sexual cannibalism in M. religiosa only occurred in captivity was wide spread. It was believed that it was an artefact of improper animal keeping (too little food or space). In 1992 however, the cannibalizing behavior of female M. religiosa was observed in a field study. Lawrence compared the percentage of cannibalism in natural and manipulated (males and females were put close together in field) pairings and found rates of 31% and 24%. This proves that sexual cannibalism in this <b>praying</b> <b>mantid</b> is not caused by laboratory conditions. They can however intensify the phenomenon: females that were starved for more than three days were more likely to attack males, even before copulation. While the cannibalization before the copulation is still puzzling to scientist, there are some theories about the benefits of sexual cannibalism in general:Eating her mate provides the female with a lot of nutrients she doesn’t have to hunt for. She has a prey item available that is bigger than the prey {{she would be able to}} catch in the manner she usually hunts. The meal also takes place during or shortly after she was fertilized giving her more resources for the faster production of a large ootheca with large eggs, increasing the chance of her offspring to survive. Males have also been known to be more attracted to heavier, well-nourished females for this reason.|$|E

Here I report the first study of spermatophore feeding in a <b>praying</b> <b>mantid.</b> While studies of <b>praying</b> <b>mantid</b> mating behaviour have largely focused on sexual cannibalism, this behaviour is not known in the genus Ciulfina. The general patterns of mating behaviour and spermatophore feeding are described for four species: Ciulfina rentzi, Ciulfina klassi, Ciulfina biseriata and Ciulfina baldersoni. Copulation duration and postcopulatory spermatophore attachment duration were found to vary both inter- and intraspecifically. Ciulfina rentzi exhibited a considerably longer mean copulation duration and a considerably shorter mean postcopulatory spermatophore attachment duration than the other Ciulfina species. Smaller males copulated for longer durations in C. rentzi and C. klassi. For C. baldersoni, both copulation duration and postcopulatory spermatophore attachment duration increased with female mass.

40|$|The {{traditional}} view {{of sexual}} selection {{has been that}} of competing males and choosy females; however, more recently it has been recognized that males may exhibit mate choice when females vary in quality and when males suffer costs associated with mating. Sexually cannibalistic mating systems {{provide an opportunity to}} examine male mate choice further: the high costs potentially involved in the mating process for males, as well as variation in female quality, predict male mate choice. We used the <b>praying</b> <b>mantid</b> Pseudomantis albofimbriata to determine the effect of female body condition on male mate choice in a system with frequent precopulatory sexual cannibalism. Female body condition is positively correlated with fecundity and negatively correlated with the propensity to cannibalize, so we predicted males would strongly prefer females in good condition to maximize their reproductive potential. Results of our simultaneous choice tests showed that males use chemical and visual cues for mate location and assessment, and that they can use either of these sensory modalities to distinguish and choose between females differing in body condition, with a significant preference for good-condition females. However, surprisingly, males rarely rejected poor-condition females in the more ecologically relevant scenario of only one immediate potential mate and both sensory modes available to them, which may be explained by the strong scramble competition known for <b>praying</b> <b>mantid</b> systems. These results show that even when female quality varies and the cost of mating for males is substantial, male mate rejection does not always evolve. 8 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Habitat {{selection}} by mobile {{animals is}} {{strongly influenced by}} habitat characteristics that allow for effective predator avoidance, increased foraging efficiency and reproductive success. Often predator avoidance takes priority; this can be achieved through choosing habitats with high structural complexity. By contrast, the <b>praying</b> <b>mantid</b> Ciulfina inhabits structurally simple tree trunk habitats in woodlands and rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. Field observations and experiments revealed a strong preference for tree trunks with a smooth bark type and small circumference. Subsequent laboratory experiments supported these field results, and further indicated that the preference for such habitat structures {{may be associated with}} a faster running speed across the smooth textured bark and around trunks of a smaller circumference. Ciulfina run to escape predation and actively forage across the open tree trunk habitat. Thus selecting smooth trees with small circumference facilitates increased running speeds and thereby may increase foraging ability and predator avoidance. 7 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Estimating {{paternity}} patterns provides {{insights into}} the importance of competing evolutionary forces on mating systems. The number of sires contributing to a female's offspring is mostly influenced by her relative promiscuity. However, in a postcopulatory context, {{it will also be}} affected by sperm competition and cryptic female choice. Here, we describe the paternity patterns of two species of praying mantis from the genus Ciulfina, the agile <b>praying</b> <b>mantid.</b> This study is the first to describe patterns of paternity in the Mantodea. We found a variation in paternity in these two closely related species. Ciulfina rentzi exhibited single paternity, with a single male siring all offspring within a clutch. By contrast, Ciulfina klassi displayed multiple paternity, with the minimum number of fathers contributing to a clutch ranging from one to four. Differences in copulation duration and reproductive output between these two species may help to explain these paternity patterns. 6 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. <b>Praying</b> <b>mantids</b> (Mantoptera) are {{the most}} {{important}} hosts of horsehair worms (Nematomorpha) in tropical and subtropical regions worldwide. 82 reports of nematomorph-mantid relationships are reported, 11 of which are new to science. The majority of nematomorph species parasitizing mantids belongs to the genus Chor-dodes. The life cycle consists of a free-living stage in which copulation and early embryological and larval devel-opment take place and parasitic phases in an intermediate and a final host. The intermediate hosts, which are insects with aquatic larvae, serve as vectors between the aquatic and the terrestrial environment. Development can only be completed if the intermediate host is captured and eaten by the final host, <b>praying</b> <b>mantids.</b> Inside the host, the main development of the worms takes place, with a size increase from about 100 µm up to several centimeters. The factors influencing emergence from the hosts, which must be established close to water, remain not well understood...|$|R

40|$|The {{concept of}} an 'edge' habitat that is {{influenced}} by the biotic and abiotic characteristics of neighbouring habitats is a broadly applied principle in ecology. Ciulfina klassi Giglio-Tos (Mantodea: Liturgusidae) inhabit vertical tree trunk surfaces in a restricted patch of coastal Melaleuca woodlands in the world heritage listed Wet Tropics Region of far north Queensland, Australia. Preliminary observations suggested that abrupt forest edges may {{have a positive effect on}} population density in the praying mantis C. klassi. During field surveys over a two-year period, mantid densities were found to be higher at forest edges than forest interiors. Greater sapling recruitment at forest edges may contribute to this edge effect by providing dense patches of tree trunk habitats. The population characteristics of C. klassi are also described here in the context of our current understanding of <b>praying</b> <b>mantid</b> life histories.

40|$|Models of the {{evolution}} of sexual cannibalism argue that males may offset the cost of cannibalism if components of the male body are directly allocated to the eggs that they fertilize. We tested this idea in the <b>praying</b> <b>mantid</b> Tenodera sinensis. Males and females were fed differently radiolabelled crickets and allowed to mate. Half of the pairs progressed to sexual cannibalism and we prevented cannibalism in the other half. We assess the relative allocation of both male-derived somatic materials and ejaculate materials into the eggs and soma of the female. Our results show that male somatic investment contributes to production of offspring. The eggs and reproductive tissues of cannibalistic females contained significantly more male-derived amino acids than those of non-cannibalistic females, and there was {{an increase in the number}} of eggs produced subsequent to sexual cannibalism. Sexual cannibalism thus increases male material investment in offspring. We also show that males provide substantial investment via the ejaculate, with males passing about 25 % of their radiolabelled amino acids to females via the ejaculate even in the absence of cannibalism. 6 page(s...|$|E

40|$|The sensory systems {{employed}} by animals to locate potential mates are diverse. Among insects, chemical and acoustic signals {{are commonly used}} over long distances, with visual signals {{playing a role in}} close-range orientation and courtship. Within groups that exhibit a scramble competition mating system, selection on mate searching ability will be particularly strong. Clearly, aspects of the species ecology, such as habitat complexity and population density, will be crucial in the evolution of mate searching systems and sexual signals. Praying mantids exhibit both chemical and visual sexual signalling behaviour, and also vary in their ecology. This study employs scanning electron microscopy of antennal sensory morphology and behavioural assays to investigate the relative importance of chemical and visual signalling in two Australian <b>praying</b> <b>mantid</b> species: Pseudomantis albofimbriata and Ciulfina biseriata. As predicted, the high level of habitat complexity, low population density and strong male dispersal capability of P. albofimbriata corresponded to the use of airborne sex pheromones. Conversely, the open habitat, high population density, and poor dispersal of C. biseriata corresponded to a greater reliance on short-range visual cues for mate location. 7 page(s...|$|E
40|$|The rapid {{divergence}} of male genitalia is {{a widely}} observed evolutionary phenomenon. Although sexual selection is currently regarded as providing the most likely driving force behind genital diversification, the mechanisms responsible are still debated. Here, we investigate the relationship between male genital morphology and sperm transfer in the <b>praying</b> <b>mantid</b> Ciulfina klassi using geometric morphometrics. The shape of male genitalia in C. klassi influenced sperm transfer duration and the number and proportion of sperm transferred, suggesting that genital morphology is under sexual selection in this species. Genital size however was not correlated with any aspect of sperm transfer. Intriguingly, two of the major genital shape components correlated positively {{with the number of}} sperm transferred, but negatively with sperm transfer duration. Hence, males that most effectively transfer sperm to the female spermatheca do so in {{a relatively short period of}} time. A direct negative relationship was also found between sperm transfer duration and sperm transfer success. Overall, our study suggests that the variable genital shape of Ciulfina may have been selected for more efficient sperm transfer. 9 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Many {{animals have}} {{conspicuous}} body colour that may serve physiological, camouflage or communicative functions. This {{study investigated the}} influence of bright coloration in orb-web spiders on the response of predator and prey using Argiope keyserlingi, the St Andrew 2 ̆ 7 s Cross spider. This species has three conspicuous yellow bands on its dorsal abdominal surface. These bands could act as camouflage devise through disruptive colouration or attract prey to the web by exploiting colour preferences in the insect visual system. In the field, naturally yellow spiders captured more prey than spiders where the yellow bands were coloured over with black marker. Similarly, some prey (Harlequin beetles: Tectocoris diophthalamus) moved towards yellow spiders and away from blackened spiders in Y-choice tests. However, native bees (Trigona carbonaria) {{did not seem to}} discriminate naturally coloured spiders at a distance when approaching a spider on a web or an empty web. Similarly, <b>praying</b> <b>mantid</b> predators (Pseudomantis albofimbriata) preferred blackened spiders over yellow spiders in a Y-maze, but they showed no preference when offered an empty web and a web occupied by a naturally coloured spider. Thus our data suggest that the main function of the conspicuous yellow bands is crypsis, perhaps via disruptive colouration that obscures the outline of the spider...|$|E
50|$|Many insects {{have good}} {{ultrasonic}} hearing {{and most of}} these are nocturnal insects listening for echolocating bats. This includes many groups of moths, beetles, <b>praying</b> <b>mantids</b> and lacewings. Upon hearing a bat, some insects will make evasive manoeuvres to escape being caught. Ultrasonic frequencies trigger a reflex action in the noctuid moth that cause it to drop slightly in its flight to evade attack.

40|$|In {{unpalatable}} prey, long-wavelength colors such as red {{or yellow}} are often {{thought to be}} aposematic (warning) signals, due to their high conspicuousness. However, conspicuousness depends on the visual physiology of the receivers. Tectocoris diophthalmus is a shieldback stinkbug with highly variable coloration; individuals may be all orange or have blue-green iridescent patches of variable size. Prior research has demonstrated the defenses of T. diophthalmus can induce avoidance learning in birds but not <b>praying</b> <b>mantids,</b> and that geographic patterns in variation may relate to the local density of arthropod predators. In this study, we use visual modeling and behavioral assays to test how <b>praying</b> <b>mantids</b> Hierodula majuscula may impose directional selection pressure on the coloration of T. diophthalmus. Mantids have monochromatic vision with peak sensitivity in the “green” region of the spectrum. Using a receptor excitation model, we show that orange bugs are much less conspicuous than iridescent conspecifics and may be inconspicuous against their typical green leaf background. In behavioral assays, mantids detected iridescent bugs from a greater distance on average. In binary choice experiments, mantids showed no color preference at short range, but approached iridescent bugs significantly more often when the choice {{had to be made}} at a greater distance, and could not distinguish between orange bugs and unoccupied leaves at distance. Together, this evidence suggests that H. majuscula should impose strong directional selection against iridescent bugs in nature, and that orange coloration may be performing dual roles of crypsis to mantids but aposematic signaling to birds. 7 page(s...|$|R
40|$|While {{competing}} {{males and}} choosy females may be common in animal mating systems, male choice can evolve under certain conditions. Sexual cannibalism {{is such a}} condition {{because of the high}} mortality risk for males. In mantids, female body condition is associated with male mate preference, with fat females preferred, due to at least two reasons: females in poor nutritional condition are likely to attack and predate males, and fat females can potentially increase the number of offspring. Thus, the risk of cannibalism and female fecundity can influence male mating behavior. In this study, we attempted to separate these factors by using the <b>praying</b> <b>mantid</b> Tenodera angustipennis to examine whether male preference for fat female mantids was based on avoiding sexual cannibalism (cannibalism avoidance hypothesis) or preference for female fecundity (fecundity preference hypothesis). The feeding regimes were experimentally manipulated to discriminate between the effects of female fecundity and female hunger status on male and female mating behaviors. We found that recently starved females more frequently locomoted toward the male, and that male abdominal bending was less intensive and escape was sooner from recently starved females. These female and male behavioral responses to female hunger condition may reveal male avoidance of dangerous females in this mantid...|$|E
40|$|Several {{hypotheses}} {{have been}} proposed to explain the evolution of sexual cannibalism. The foraging strategy hypothesis states that sexual cannibalism may arise as an adaptive foraging strategy, providing females with the nutrients to increase future fecundity. Yet, very few {{studies have found that}} nourishment through cannibalism translates into increased fecundity. One explanation for this may be that most of these investigations have concentrated on sexually dimorphic spider species with tiny males that do not significantly increase female body mass on consumption. The current study focuses on the <b>praying</b> <b>mantid,</b> Pseudomantis albofimbriata, a moderately size dimorphic species with relatively large males. Cannibalistic females of such species {{may be more likely to}} gain nutritional benefits from male consumption, which translate into increased fecundity. Here, cannibalistic females substantially improved their body condition and subsequently produced heavier egg cases than their noncannibalistic counterparts. An additional prediction of the foraging strategy hypothesis is that sexual cannibalism will increase with decreasing female condition. We found that the prevalence of sexual cannibalism in this system was indeed affected by female body condition; females in poor condition were more likely to consume their potential mates than females in good condition. Additional analysis of the data refuted the relevance of each of the remaining hypotheses for this species, providing clear evidence for the foraging strategy hypothesis as an explanation for the maintenance of sexual cannibalism in this species. 6 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Although male polymorphisms occur {{widely in}} nature and have {{received}} considerable recent attention from studies of alternative mating strategies, male genital polymorphisms are less well known. Here, we describe a dimorphism in {{the orientation of the}} male genitalic complex of the <b>praying</b> <b>mantid</b> genus Ciulfina. Populations of Ciulfina species vary in the proportion of males with dextral (right-oriented) and sinistral (left-oriented) genitalia, ranging from directional asymmetry (single orientation only) to apparent antisymmetry (equal proportions of both orientations). The proportion of dextral males varied between species (C. baldersoni: 46 %; C. rentzi: 24 %; C. klassi: 100 %; C. biseriata: 83 %) and between populations. We used elliptic Fourier analysis to quantify shape and size variation between the genitalia of dextral and sinistral males and determined that the two forms were mirror images of one another in two species. We found that the level of mechanical reproductive isolation between heterospecific populations of opposite genital orientation was no greater than that between heterospecific populations with the same orientation or of mixed orientation. Genital orientation therefore did not influence premating isolation between these species, despite complete postmating isolation. The geographic proximity of populations to heterospecifics also showed no particular pattern with respect to genital orientation. These results suggest that reversible trait asymmetry in Ciulfina is not driven by reproductive isolation, and add to the growing evidence against the species isolation hypothesis for rapid genital evolution. 9 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Prey {{quality has}} {{previously}} been shown to affect the growth and reproduction of predatory arthropods, however relatively {{little is known about}} the specific nutrients responsible for these effects. We tested if the macronutrient content (i. e. lipid and protein) of live prey affected mate attraction, reproductive behavior, egg production and nutrient reserves of adult female <b>praying</b> <b>mantids,</b> Pseudomantis albofimbriata. Females on a high-protein diet produced more than twice as many eggs as females on a high-lipid diet despite being fed the same overall biomass of prey. Furthermore, the lipid and protein composition of eggs and the female body was directly related to the diet that females were fed (i. e. high lipid content on the high-lipid diet). Even more striking was the effect of diet treatment on the number of males attracted to females - only one male was attracted to females on the high-lipid treatment and 56 males were attracted to females on the high-protein treatment. Although it is not unexpected that females with more eggs would attract more males, the extreme nature of this difference is certainly surprising because previous studies have shown that females with only a couple of eggs can attract multiple males. Hence, our results suggest that female pheromone production may be affected by the quality/nutritional composition of eggs rather than simply the number of eggs. We found no significant difference in any of the other behaviours measured during mating trials, including the frequency of sexual cannibalism. The positive effects of prey protein content on mate attraction and egg production suggest that <b>praying</b> <b>mantids</b> might be expected to choose more protein-biased prey in nature or, if prey choice is limited, to have higher reproductive output or population growth in communities dominated by protein-rich prey. 7 page(s...|$|R
50|$|Further {{research}} is needed to examine the association between sexual cannibalism and size dimorphism in further depth, especially in different species. Although the larger of the sexes in species that exhibit sexual cannibalism are typically female, the extent of sexual size dimorphism is not constant across all species. To date, studies have been done on wolf spiders such as the Zyuzicosa species of the family Lycosidae, one case in which extreme sexual size dimorphism is observed with a female that is much larger than the male. This is also seen in the family Araneidae. Interestingly, this sexual size dimorphism is varied within species that participate in sexual cannibalism. For example, <b>Praying</b> <b>mantids</b> of the order Mantodea do not show the extreme sexual size dimorphism that wolf spiders do, although females are larger.|$|R
40|$|While {{copulation}} serves {{primarily to}} allow the transfer of male gametes, the duration of copulation often exceeds that required for successful sperm transfer.
