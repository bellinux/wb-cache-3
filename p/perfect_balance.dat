40|$|National audienceFor over a decade, MapReduce {{has become}} a {{prominent}} programming model to handle vast amounts of raw data in large scale systems. This model ensures scalability, reliability and availability aspects with reasonable query processing time. However these large scale systems still face some challenges: data skew, task imbalance, high disk I/O and redistribution costs can have disastrous effects on performance. In this paper, we introduce MRFA-Join algorithm: a new frequency adaptive algorithm based on MapReduce programming model and a randomised key redistribution approach for join processing of large-scale datasets. A cost analysis of this algorithm shows that our approach is insensitive to data skew and ensures <b>perfect</b> <b>balancing</b> properties during all stages of join computation.
