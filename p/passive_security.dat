I have sympathized with {{a people who}} {{themselves}} have had no sympathy with <b>passive</b> <b>security</b> and inaction. I have felt confidence in them, and have known, as it were, that their industry must enable them to succeed as a people while their freedom would insure to them success as a nation. With these convictions I went among them wishing to write of them good words--words which might be pleasant for them to read, while they might assist perhaps in producing a true impression of them here at home. But among my good words {{there are so many}} which are bitter, that I fear I shall have failed in my object as regards them. And it seems to me, as I read once more my own pages, that in saying evil things of my friends I have used language stronger than I intended; whereas I have omitted to express myself with emphasis when I have attempted to say good things. Why need I have told of the mud of Washington, or have exposed the nakedness of Cairo? Why did I speak with such eager enmity of those poor women in the New York cars, who never injured me, now that I think of it? Ladies of New York, as I write this, the words which were written among you are printed and cannot be expunged; but I tender to you my apologies from my home in England. And that Van Wyck Committee--might I not have left those contractors to be dealt with by their own Congress, seeing that that Congress committee was by no means inclined to spare them? I might have kept my pages free from gall, and have sent my sheets to the press unhurt by the conviction that I was hurting those who had dealt kindly by me! But what then? Was any people ever truly served by eulogy; or an honest cause furthered by undue praise? ...|$|E

50|$|The ETR 610 / RABe 503 (also {{known as}} the Cisalpino Due {{as it was the}} second class of tilting trains {{exploited}} by Cisalpino) primarily differs from the ETR 600 {{in the sense that the}} ETR 610 / RABe 503 supports the voltage and signalling systems used in Switzerland and Germany. This includes the need for much heavier on-board traction power transformers necessary as a result of the lower traction power frequency of 16.7 Hz used in Switzerland and Germany in comparison with those required for the 25 kV 50 Hz AC traction power supplies. The innovative features concern the interior and exterior design, now closer to the customers’ brand strategy and an improved comfort and services for passengers. Moreover, some important technical characteristics have been increased, such as the power of the traction unit and the level of redundancy of components and equipment, in order to improve reliability.

40|$|Abstract. Growing traffic volumes and the {{increasing}} complexity of attacks pose a constant scaling challenge for network intrusion prevention systems (NIPS). In this respect, offloading NIPS processing to compute clusters offers an im-mediately deployable alternative to expensive hardware upgrades. In practice, however, NIPS offloading is challenging on three fronts in contrast to <b>passive</b> network <b>security</b> functions: (1) NIPS offloading can impact other traffic engi-neering objectives; (2) NIPS offloading impacts user perceived latency; and (3) NIPS actively change traffic volumes by dropping unwanted traffic. To address these challenges, we present the SNIPS system. We design a formal optimization framework that captures tradeoffs across scalability, network load, and latency. We provide a practical implementation using recent advances in software-defined networking without requiring modifications to NIPS hardware. Our evaluations on realistic topologies show that SNIPS can reduce the maximum load by up to 10 × while only increasing the latency by 2 %. ...|$|R

40|$|Cyber warfare is {{asymmetric}} in {{the current}} paradigm, with attackers having the high ground over defenders. This asymmetry stems from the situation that attackers have the initiative, while defenders concentrate on passive fortifications. Defenders are constantly patching the newest hole in their defenses and creating taller and thicker walls, without placing guards on those walls to watch for the enemy and react to attacks. Current <b>passive</b> cyber <b>security</b> defenses such as intrusion detection, anti-virus, and hardened software are not sufficient to repel attackers. In fact, in conventional warfare this passivity would be entirely nonsensical, given the available active strategies, such as counterattacks and deception. Based on this observation, we have identified the technique of booby trapping software. This extends the arsenal of weaponry available to defenders with an active technique for directly reacting to attacks. Ultimately, we believe this approach will restore some of the much sought after equilibrium between attackers and defenders in the digital domain...|$|R

The detection modules {{of the system}} include active security modules and <b>passive</b> <b>security</b> modules. The control unit of all security modules (active security modules and <b>passive</b> <b>security</b> modules) is HOLTEK microchip. The paper focuses on the active security modules (mobile robots). Mobile robots are classified more and more teams according to the detection functions. Each team robot system includes many mobile robots to execute the same event detection. Each mobile robot has two variety interfaces, uses voice module to alarm users for event condition, and transmits the real-time event signals to the supervised computer and the other mobile robots via wireless RF interface. If the event occurs, the mobile robot can transmit the relation location (floor number) of the event to the supervised computer. The supervised computer decides {{the location of the}} event according the feedback signals from mobile robots, controls the other mobile robots moving to the event location, and recognizes the final decision output using Dempster-Shafter Evidence Theory. The belief value is over the threshold value and displays detection and decision output values on the monitor of the user interface.

40|$|Abstract. We {{revisit the}} context of leakage-tolerant {{interactive}} protocols as defined by Bitanski, Canetti and Halevi (TCC 2012). Our contributions can be summarized as follows: 1. For the purpose of secure message transmission, any encryption protocol with message space M and secret key space SK tolerating poly-logarithmic leakage on the secret state of the receiver must satisfy |SK | ≥ (1 − ɛ) |M|, for every 0 < ɛ ≤ 1, and if |SK | = |M|, then the scheme must use a fresh key pair to encrypt each message. 2. More generally, we show that any n party protocol tolerates leakage of ≈ poly(log κ) bits from one party {{at the end of}} the protocol execution, if and only if the protocol has <b>passive</b> adaptive <b>security</b> against an adaptive corruption of one party {{at the end of the}} protocol execution. This shows that as soon as a little leakage is tolerated, one needs full adaptive security. 3. In case more than one party can be corrupted, we get that leakage tolerance is equivalent to a weaker form of adaptivity, which we call semi-adaptivity. Roughly, a protocol has semi-adaptive security if there exist a simulator which can simulate the internal state of corrupted parties, however, such a state is not required to be indistinguishable from a real state, only that it would have lead to the simulated communication. All our results can be based on the solely assumption that collision-resistant function ensembles exist...|$|R
