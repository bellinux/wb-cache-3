5|$|Sleep-and-charge USB ports {{can be used}} to <b>charge</b> {{electronic}} <b>devices</b> {{even when}} the computer is switched off. Normally, when a computer is powered off the USB ports are powered down, preventing phones and other <b>devices</b> from <b>charging.</b> Sleep-and-charge USB ports remain powered even when the computer is off. On laptops, <b>charging</b> <b>devices</b> from the USB port when it is not being powered from AC drains the laptop battery faster; most laptops have a facility to stop charging if their own battery charge level gets too low.

50|$|The engines used exhaust pulse <b>pressure</b> <b>charging</b> and {{developed}} 1,200 horsepower (895 kW) at 625 rpm, though in 1981 they were down-rated to 875 hp@600rpm. There were no valves, and inlet and exhaust were via ports in the cylinder walls.|$|R
50|$|Basic <b>charging</b> <b>pressure</b> is {{fundamental}} for Automatic Performance Control (APC). Basic <b>charging</b> <b>pressure</b> is mechanically adjusted on the actuators pushrod between the actuator and the waste gate. At to low basic <b>charging</b> <b>pressure</b> the engine doesn’t revs up as expected when the throttle is opened quickly. At to high basic <b>charging</b> <b>pressure</b> a negative adaptation occurs and maximum <b>charging</b> <b>pressure</b> cannot be achieved. In addition {{there is a}} substantial risk of engine damage since the <b>charging</b> <b>pressure</b> can’t be lowered enough when regulating with attention to pre ignition/pinging. Basic <b>charging</b> <b>pressure</b> shall be 0,40 ±0,03 bar (5,80 ±0,43 PSI). After adjustment the push rod must have at least two turns (2 mm) pre tension when connecting to the waste gate lever. The purpose with that {{is to make sure that}} the waste gate is held close when not affected. On new turbo chargers the basic <b>charging</b> <b>pressure</b> tends to be near or spot on the upper tolerance when the pre tension is two turns. The pre tension may never be lesser than two turns (2 mm). When checking the basic <b>charging</b> <b>pressure</b> it shall be noted that the pressure decreases at high RPM and increases at low outside temperatures.|$|R
