40|$|While {{there is}} general {{agreement}} that <b>pleural</b> <b>plaques</b> are biomarkers of asbestos exposure, there is debate {{in the scientific community}} over whether <b>pleural</b> <b>plaques</b> cause lung function deficits. Many of the studies that addressed this issue were subject to certain limitations. In most studies, <b>pleural</b> <b>plaques</b> were diagnosed by ra-diography, which is less accurate than high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) and can lead to misdi-agnoses.

50|$|<b>Pleural</b> <b>plaques</b> are {{the most}} common manifestation of {{asbestos}} exposure, affecting up to 58% of asbestos-exposed workers. The prevalence among the general population exposed environmentally ranges from 0.53 to 8%. <b>Pleural</b> <b>plaques</b> are discrete circumscribed areas of hyaline fibrosis (patches of thickening) of the parietal pleura and rarely the visceral pleura that develop 20 to 40 years after first exposure. Over time, usually more than 30 years, they often become partly calcified. They consist of mature collagen fibers arranged in an open basket-weave pattern and are covered by flattened or cuboidal mesothelial cells. They have a white or pale yellow shaggy appearance and are typically distributed on the posterolateral chest wall, diaphragm, and mediastinal pleura. The number and size varies. <b>Pleural</b> <b>plaques</b> are typically asymptomatic, however, there is still some controversy on this topic. An association between <b>pleural</b> <b>plaques</b> and chest pain has been reported, but this has not been confirmed in more recent studies. Similarly, an association between <b>pleural</b> <b>plaques</b> and a restrictive impairment with diminished diffusing capacity on pulmonary function testing has been described. This has not been a consistent finding and it has been postulated that this might be related to undetected early fibrosis. The pathogenesis of <b>pleural</b> <b>plaques</b> remains uncertain. The most likely explanation is that asbestos fibres reach the parietal pleura by passage through lymphatic channels where they excite an inflammatory reaction. The chest X-ray is the usual tool for diagnosing <b>pleural</b> <b>plaques</b> but chest CT scan is more sensitive and specific in this regard. <b>Pleural</b> <b>plaques</b> are evidence of past asbestos exposure and indicate an increased risk for the future development of other asbestos-related diseases. <b>Pleural</b> <b>plaques</b> in themselves are not pre-malignant. Individuals with <b>pleural</b> <b>plaques</b> are usually not compensated in most compensation systems.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] To assess airflow {{limitation}} in workers exposed long term to metal dust, {{the prevalence of}} <b>pleural</b> <b>plaques</b> in those workers exposed {{in the past to}} asbestos, the influence of <b>pleural</b> <b>plaques</b> on lung function, and the possible association with airway disease caused by asbestos. METHODS [...] A cross sectional and longitudinal (seven year) survey of 494 long term (mean (SEM) 21 (1) years) workers in a copper refinery was carried out from medical questionnaires, chest radiographs, and forced spirometry. RESULTS [...] The prevalence of lifetime non-smokers was 19 %, current smokers 39 %, and ex-smokers 42 %. The prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD) (forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) 0. 05). In the smokers and ex-smokers with COPD, the loss of FEV 1 was 53 (10) (P < 0. 02). The prevalence of <b>pleural</b> <b>plaques</b> was 11 % (P < 0. 0001); <b>pleural</b> <b>plaques</b> were found in older workers with known exposure to asbestos. The <b>pleural</b> <b>plaques</b> were circumscribed and associated with a non-significant 196 ml reduction in forced vital capacity (FVC) and non-significant reduction of FVC over time. The <b>pleural</b> <b>plaques</b> were not associated with COPD or SAD. The cumulative smoking index obtained by a technician did not differ from that by a chest physician. CONCLUSIONS [...] Despite exposures to asbestos that produced <b>pleural</b> <b>plaques</b> and exposures to metal dusts and foundry fumes the long term workers of this plant did not have excessive prevalence of COPD or SAD. The data suggest that low level long term exposure to metal dusts, gases, and foundry fumes do not necessarily cause respiratory dysfunction, circumscribed <b>pleural</b> <b>plaques</b> with low grades of width and extent do not reduce FVC significantly, and exposure to asbestos dust that produced <b>pleural</b> <b>plaques</b> does not necessarily produce airway dysfunction...|$|R
50|$|Previously it was {{possible}} to claim compensation for <b>pleural</b> <b>plaques</b> caused by negligent exposure to asbestos, on the grounds that although it is in itself asymptomatic, it is linked to development of diffuse pleural thickening, which causes lung impairment. It has been highly contentious, however, as to the probability of <b>pleural</b> <b>plaques</b> developing into <b>pleural</b> thickening or other asbestos-related illnesses. On October 17, 2007 this point was clarified by the Law Lords' ruling that workers who have <b>pleural</b> <b>plaques</b> as a result of asbestos exposure will {{no longer be able to}} seek compensation as it does not in itself constitute a disease. This ruling was, however, superseded, so far as sufferers of <b>pleural</b> <b>plaques</b> in Scotland are concerned, by the passing of the Damages (Asbestos-related Conditions)(Scotland) Act 2009, which provides that in Scots law <b>pleural</b> <b>plaques</b> are to be considered an actionable type of personal injury.|$|R

40|$|Context: US EPA {{proposed}} a Reference Concentration for Libby amphibole asbestos {{based on the}} premise that <b>pleural</b> <b>plaques</b> are adverse and cause lung function deficits. Objective: We conducted a systematic review to evaluate whether there is an association between <b>pleural</b> <b>plaques</b> and lung function and ascertain whether results were dependent on the method used to identify plaques. Methods: Using the PubMed database, we identified studies that evaluated <b>pleural</b> <b>plaques</b> and lung function. We assessed each study for quality, then integrated evidence and assessed associations based on the Bradford Hill guidelines. We also compared the results of HRCT studies to those of X-ray studies. Results: We identified 16 HRCT and 36 X-ray studies. We rated six HRCT and 16 X-ray studies as higher quality based on a risk-of-bias analysis. Half of the higher quality studies reported small but statistically significant mean lung function decrements associated with plaques. None of the differences were clinically significant. Many studies had limitations, such as inappropriate controls and/or insufficient adjustment for confounders. There was little consistency in the direction of effect for the most commonly reported measurements. X-ray results were more variable than HRCT results. <b>Pleural</b> <b>plaques</b> were not associated with changes in lung function over time in longitudinal studies. Conclusion: The weight of evidence indicates that <b>pleural</b> <b>plaques</b> do not impact lung function.

40|$|CONTEXT: Occupational and {{environmental}} exposures to asbestos remain {{a public health}} problem even in developed countries. Because of the long latency in asbestos-related pathology, past asbestos exposure continues to contribute to incident disease. Asbestos most commonly produces pulmonary pathology, with asbestos-related pleural disease as the most common manifestation. Although the pleurae and pericardium share certain histologic characteristics, asbestos-related pericarditis is rarely reported. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a 59 -year-old man who worked around boilers for almost 30 years and was eventually determined to have calcific, constrictive pericarditis. He initially presented with an infectious exacerbation of chronic bronchitis. Chest radiographs demonstrated pleural and pericardial calcifications. Further evaluation with cardiac catheterization showed a hemodynamic picture consistent with constrictive pericarditis. A high-resolution computerized tomography scan of the chest demonstrated dense calcification in the pericardium, right pleural thickening and nodularity, right <b>pleural</b> <b>plaque</b> without calcification, and density in the right middle lobe. Pulmonary function testing showed mild obstruction and borderline low diffusing capacity. DISCUSSION: Based on the patient’s occupational history, the presence of pleural pathology consisten...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} by computed tomography (CT) whether asbestosis, diffuse pleural thickening and/or <b>pleural</b> <b>plaques</b> are statistically associated. We also tried to find criteria to differentiate between diffuse and circumscribed pleural thickening. From 231 exposed workers, only those subjects whose radiograph showed neither bilateral calcified <b>pleural</b> <b>plaques</b> nor small pulmonary opacities higher than 1 / 1 grade according to the 1980 International Labour Office (ILO) Classification were considered. Scans were assessed for the presence of subpleural curvilinear lines, septal and intralobular lines, parenchymal bands, honeycombing, rounded atelectasis, <b>pleural</b> <b>plaques</b> and diffuse <b>pleural</b> thickening. CT scans revealed pleural and/or lung abnormalities in 99 workers. <b>Pleural</b> <b>plaques</b> were unilateral in one-third of cases with <b>plaques.</b> Diffuse <b>pleural</b> thickening, parenchymal bands and rounded atelectasis were unilateral in, respectively, 62 and 69 and 75 % of cases with the abnormality. Septal and intralobular lines, and honeycombing were always bilateral. CT signs could be grouped into three patterns: 1) septal and intralobular lines, and honeycombing corresponding to pulmonary fibrosis; 2) <b>pleural</b> <b>plaques</b> corresponding to parietal pleural fibrosis; and 3) diffuse pleural thickening, rounded atelectasis and parenchymal bands corresponding to visceral pleural fibrosis. In these workers with a normal or near-normal radiograph, three groups of subjects with different responses were distinguished.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{describe}} {{the characteristics of}} reversible focal pleural thickenings (PTs) mimicking real plaques, that firstly suggest asbestos exposure or pleural metastasis; to propose an imaging strategy and propose an explanation for their mechanism of formation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective review of data from 19 patients with PTs fitting the description of pleural plaques at chest computed tomography (CT) and presenting modifications (clearance or appearance) {{of at least one}} PT at an additional chest examination in prone position. RESULTS: A total of 152 PTs were recorded on the first chest CT examinations with a range of two to 19 pleural opacities per patient. All PTs had a posterior distribution in the lower lobes. On the additional acquisitions, 144 PTs disappeared. Seventeen patients presented complete regression of PTs and two patients presented persistence of eight PTs. CONCLUSION: Additional low dose acquisition in prone position should be performed in all patients presenting with focal PT in a dependent and basal location. This may allow to exclude a <b>pleural</b> <b>plaque</b> in case of asbestos exposure but also a pleural metastasis in oncologic patients. These reversible dependent PTs could be related to physiological focal accumulation of lymphatic fluid in subpleural area...|$|E
40|$|Malignant {{mesothelioma}} is {{a highly}} aggressive tumor of the serous membranes, which in humans results from exposure to asbestos and asbestiform fibers. Although occupational malignant mesothelioma {{is still the most}} common form of this lesion, naturally contaminated soil can play an important role in the development of environmental malignant mesothelioma in some parts of the world. Fifty cases of malignant mesothelioma (MM) from southern Turkey with no occupational history of asbestos exposure were reviewed regarding pathologic and clinical features. A case of hyaline fibrous plaque of the pleura was also included in this series. Histologically the cases were classified as epithelial (36 cases); sarcomatous (7 cases); and biphasic (7 cases). One of the sarcomatous cases was desmoplastic. Ultrastructural examination of the tumor tissue in three cases revealed long-surface microvilli in epithelial cells. Intersititial cells of the lung in one case showed electron-dense asbestos fibers in the cytoplasm. Mineralogical analyses of the lung tissue in three cases of MM and the case of <b>pleural</b> <b>plaque</b> showed high amounts of asbestos fibers most consistent with tremolite and actinolite.

40|$|Malignant {{mesothelioma}} {{is caused}} by exposure to asbestos, which {{is known to have}} carcinogenic effects. However, the development of mesothelioma takes a long period and results from a low or intermediate dose of exposure. These findings have motivated us to investigate the immunological effects of asbestos exposure and analyze immune functions of patients with mesothelioma and <b>pleural</b> <b>plaque,</b> a sign of exposure to asbestos. Here, we review our knowledge concerning natural killer (NK) cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). NK cells showed impaired cytotoxicity with altered expression of activating receptors upon exposure to asbestos, while induction of granzyme+ cells in CD 8 + lymphocytes was suppressed by asbestos exposure. It is interesting that a decrease in NKp 46, a representative activating receptor, is common between NK cells in PBMC culture with asbestos and those of mesothelioma patients. Moreover, it was observed that CD 8 + lymphocytes may be stimulated by some kind of “nonself” cells in plaque-positive individuals and in mesothelioma patients, whereas CTL in mesothelioma is impaired by poststimulation maintenance of cytotoxicity.

40|$|Asbestos causes lung {{fibrosis}} known as asbestosis {{as well as}} cancers such as malignant mesothelioma and lung cancer. Asbestos is a mineral silicate containing iron, magnesium, and calcium with a core of SiO 2. The immunological effect of silica, SiO 2, involves the dysregulation of autoimmunity because of the complications of autoimmune diseases found in silicosis. Asbestos can therefore cause alteration of immunocompetent cells {{to result in a}} decline of tumor immunity. Additionally, due to its physical characteristics, asbestos fibers remain in the lung, regional lymph nodes, and the pleural cavity, particularly at the opening sites of lymphatic vessels. Asbestos can induce chronic inflammation in these areas due to the production of reactive oxygen/nitrogen species. As a consequence, immunocompetent cells can have their cellular and molecular features altered by chronic and recurrent encounters with asbestos fibers, and there may be modification by the surrounding inflammation, all of which eventually lead to decreased tumor immunity. In this paper, the brief results of our investigation regarding reduction of tumor immunity of immunocompetent cells exposed to asbestos in vitro are discussed, as are our findings concerned with an investigation of chronic inflammation and analyses of peripheral blood samples derived from patients with <b>pleural</b> <b>plaque</b> and mesothelioma that have been exposed to asbestos...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{describe}} the radiological features of pleural, parenchymal and mediastinal damage due to occupational inhalation of pumice. In total, 31 workers were evaluated for annual follow-up. Spiral computed tomography (CT) was obtained in the three patients with evident parenchymal abnormalities at chest radiograph. High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) was performed in the remaining 28 subjects with no radiographical evidence of pleuro-pulmonary damage or evidence of pleural plaques, in order to exclude parenchymal involvement. Pumice samples were analysed by radiograph diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. Spiral CT showed parahilar conglomerate masses containing fine reticular calcifications in three of 31 (9. 7 %) patients. HRCT showed several bilateral pleural plaques, without any parenchymal lesion in eight of 28 (28. 6 %) cases. Statistical analysis indicated correlation between CT findings and pulmonary function, as well as exposure to pumice. The analysis of pumice excluded the presence of asbestos. The findings from this study suggest that <b>pleural</b> <b>plaque</b> may be the only sign of disease in patients with a history of pumice inhalation. However, conglomerate para-hilar masses are probably due to exposure to massive amounts of heated pumice, and seem to have different pathogenesis and histopathological characteristics to silicosis...|$|E
