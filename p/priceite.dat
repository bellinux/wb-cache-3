40|$|<b>Priceite</b> is a {{calcium borate}} mineral and occurs as white {{crystals}} in the monoclinic pyramidal crystal system. We {{have used a}} combination of Raman spectroscopy with complimentary infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy with Energy-dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) to study the mineral <b>priceite.</b> Chemical analysis shows a pure phase consisting of B and Ca only. Raman bands at 956, 974, 991, and 1019 cm− 1 are assigned to the BO stretching vibration of the B 10 O 19 units. Raman bands at 1071, 1100, 1127, 1169, and 1211 cm− 1 are attributed to the BOH in-plane bending modes. The intense infrared band at 805 cm− 1 is assigned to the trigonal borate stretching modes. The Raman band at 674 cm− 1 together with bands at 689, 697, 736, and 602 cm− 1 are assigned to the trigonal and tetrahedral borate bending modes. Raman spectroscopy in the hydroxyl stretching region shows a series of bands with intense Raman band at 3555 cm− 1 with a distinct shoulder at 3568 cm− 1. Other bands in this spectral region are found at 3221, 3385, 3404, 3496, and 3510 cm− 1. All of these bands are assigned to water stretching vibrations. The observation of multiple bands supports the concept of water being in different molecular environments {{in the structure of}} <b>priceite.</b> The molecular structure of a natural <b>priceite</b> has been assessed using vibrational spectroscopy...|$|E

Our refinements allow determination of the positions of boron and hydrogen atoms in these minerals, which was not possible in previous powder XRD studies. In particular, the isolated [BO 2 (OH) ] groups in sibirskite and parasibirskite are characterized by a long B-OH bond and two short B-O bonds, different from the [BO 3] and [B(OH 3) ] groups in nesoborates. Periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations for sibirskite and parasibirskite support those results of structure refinements and suggest that parasibirskite undergoes a displacive phase-transition involving hydrogen ordering below 173 K. Sibirskite and parasibirskite left in their parental solutions at ambient conditions decompose to form calcite...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Turkey has {{the largest}} borate {{reserves}} {{in the world and}} Argentina is in third place. Both countries have calcium and sodium borate deposits where colemanite, ulexite and borax are the principal minerals. We present here a comparison of the main borate deposits interlayered in continental Miocene volcaniclastic rocks of the Anatolian plateau (Turkey) and those of the Puna high plateau (Argentina). The main borate deposits of Turkey are at Emet, Bigadiç, Kestelek and K›rka. Emet is {{in the western part of}} the Kütahya province. In Emet, a sedimentary lacustrine sequence rich in tuffaceous materials hosts the colemanite section. There are limestones and marl layers at the base and top of the borate section. Arsenic minerals (realgar and orpiment) are very abundant and spatially related to the borates, indicating a common genetic origin. The principal borate mineral is colemanite with minor ulexite, hydroboracite, meyerhofferite, and rarer species such as veatchite-A, tunellite, teruggite and cahnite. Colemanite occurs as nodules of different sizes, agglomerated in thick beds. Bigadiç has borates interbedded with tuffs, clay and limestone layers. The borate minerals are formed in two distinct zones, lower and upper, separated by thick tuff beds. Colemanite and ulexite predominate in both borate zones. Other borates include howlite, probertite and hydroboracite in the lower zone, and inyoite, meyerhofferite, pandermite (<b>priceite),</b> terschite, hydroboracite, howlite, tunellite and rivadavite in the upper borate zone...|$|E
