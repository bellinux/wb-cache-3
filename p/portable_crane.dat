5000|$|During his career, McCandless {{made several}} inventions. One {{of them was}} the [...] "Jeheemy", an {{apparatus}} used to salvage landing craft swamped and stranded on invasion beachheads. It consisted of <b>portable</b> <b>crane</b> hauled along the beach by a tractor. [...] McCandless also patented several other inventions, including a camera and other photographic equipment, a projection system, and a portable lamp.|$|E
50|$|The deck {{equipment}} features three winches, two fixed cranes, a <b>portable</b> <b>crane,</b> a hydrographic {{boom and}} an A-frame. This equipment gives the Ronald H. Brown a lifting capacity {{of up to}} 42000 lb as well as up to 10000 m of cable that can pull up to 8100 lb. One of the winches is specifically for use with specialty cables such as optical fiber cables or coaxial EM Cable.|$|E
5000|$|On 28 August 2006, due to {{the late}} {{completion}} of bridge preparation works on the Belgrave and Lilydale railway line, the line was closed for the morning with inadequate warning to commuters of {{the closure of the}} line between Blackburn and Ringwood stations causing chaos at Ringwood where lengthy queues formed for the replacement buses. Passengers at Heatherdale, Mitcham and Nunawading stations were stranded because of the mess where the delay was caused by the <b>portable</b> <b>crane</b> [...] "Snow White" [...] being unable to operate near the rail line where bridge supports are being constructed. The ground was too soft for the crane and gravel had to be ordered in causing the delay. Theiss John Holland were required to pay penalties to Connex Melbourne while commuters were not reimbursed. It {{is interesting to note that}} some of the more willing commuters set about the one-hour walk to Blackburn. Those individuals managed to arrive well before other commuters that had been caught in the confusion at Ringwood, by an hour or more.|$|E
50|$|<b>Portable</b> gantry <b>crane</b> systems, such as {{rubber tyred}} gantry cranes, are {{in high demand}} in {{terminals}} and ports restricted in size and reliant on maximizing vertical space and not needing to haul containers long distances. This {{is due to the}} relatively slow speed yet high reach of rubber tyred gantry cranes when compared to other forms of container terminal equipment.|$|R
40|$|Cranes {{are widely}} used in transportation, {{construction}} and manufacturing. Suspended payloads in crane system are caused to swing due to actuator movement, external disturbance such as wind flows, and motion of the crane base {{in the case of}} <b>portable</b> <b>cranes.</b> Recently, offshore cranes have become a new trend in stevedoring and in offshore construction as they can help to avoid port congestion and also to exploit ocean engineering applications. For crane operations, it is important to satisfy rigorous requirements in terms of safety, accuracy and efficiency. One of the main challenges in crane operations has been identified as the sway motion control, which is subject to underactuation of crane drive systems and external disturbances. Particularly in offshore cranes, the harsh conditions can produce exogenous disturbances during the load transfer at various scenarios of offshore crane operations in practice. Therefore, it is interesting as to how to design robust controllers to guarantee high performance in the face of disturbances and parameter variations in offshore cranes...|$|R
40|$|Input shaping is {{effective}} at eliminating vibration in {{many types of}} flexible systems. This paper discusses how input shaping is affected by actuators with unequal acceleration and deceleration dynamics. It is shown that traditional Unity Magnitude Zero Vibration (UMZV) shapers have degraded performance when used with such actuators. A new type of UMZV shaped input command is developed {{to compensate for the}} nonlinearity. Experiments on a <b>portable</b> bridge <b>crane</b> demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach...|$|R
40|$|Truck loading {{operation}} {{is an important}} task during timber production operations in forestry. In Turkey, approximately 50 million timbers/logs are being produced per year, and then they are loaded into the logging trucks. The timber/logs are transported over the forest roads {{with an average of}} one million roundtrips. However, the traditional loading methods using manpower are mostly performed while some part is done by using loading machines which can be very costly and risky. This study aims developing a combined loading system in which heavy logs are loaded into logging trucks by pulling them by a log-line powered by a <b>portable</b> <b>crane</b> within the chute system. The slope of the log-line from ground to logging truck varied between 1 % and 25 %. Within the each work cycle of {{loading operation}}, only one log was loaded by pulling with <b>portable</b> <b>crane.</b> The average loading time was found as 161. 8 seconds per cycle, in which 67 % of the time was spent on pulling the log into the logging truck. The results indicated that the average pulling speed with crane power was 840. 4 m/hr and productivity was calculated as 4. 94 m 3 /hr. The result on system speed and productivity indicated close relations with results from previous studies. The hydraulic grapple loader or cranes are widely used and common loading machines, but they cannot be efficiently used in forestry operations, especially ones having a low timber productivity rate or having low economic value timber. In these conditions, loading methods that are cost efficient and do not require higher production rate should be employed. Therefore, a combined loading system introduced in this study can be a feasible solution for loading operations in those cases. Furthermore, it is believed that this loading system integrated with a <b>portable</b> <b>crane</b> can be cost efficient and time saving solution, as well as ergonomic and safe method in the field...|$|E
50|$|Cranes {{are used}} to {{transport}} loads over variable (horizontal and vertical) paths within a restricted area and when there is insufficient (or intermittent) flow volume such {{that the use of}} a conveyor cannot be justified. Cranes provide more flexibility in movement than conveyors because the loads handled can be more varied with respect to their shape and weight. Cranes provide less flexibility in movement than industrial trucks because they only can operate within a restricted area, though some can operate on a <b>portable</b> base. Most <b>cranes</b> utilize trolley-and-tracks for horizontal movement and hoists for vertical movement, although manipulators can be used if precise positioning of the load is required. The most common cranes include the jib, bridge, gantry, and stacker cranes.|$|R
40|$|The rapid {{movement}} of machines is a challenging control problem because it {{often results in}} high levels of vibration. As a result, flexible machines are typically moved relatively slowly to avoid such vibration. Therefore, motion-induced vibration limits the operational speed of the system. Input shaping is one method that eliminates motion-induced vibrations by intelligently designing the reference command such that system vibration is cancelled. It has been successfully implemented {{on a number of}} systems, including bridge and tower cranes. The implementation of input shaping on cranes provides a substantial increase in the operational efficiency. Unfortunately, most cranes, once erected, have limited or no base mobility. This limits their workspace. The addition of base mobility could help extend the operational effectiveness of cranes and may also expand crane functionality. Mobile cranes may also be better suited for use in harsh and/or distant environments. Teleoperation of oscillatory systems, such as cranes, then becomes another avenue for advancement of crane functionality. Base mobility in cranes presents both additional control challenges and operational opportunities. A crane with base mobility is redundantly actuated (overactuated), such that multiple combinations of actuators can be used to move a payload from one location to another. This opens the possibility for the selection of a combination of actuation that provides both rapid motion and limited system vibration. The extension of input shaping into this operational domain will provide a method to maximize effective actuation combinations. Toward addressing these issues, new multi-input shaping methods were developed and applied to a mobile, <b>portable</b> tower <b>crane.</b> During this development, a firm understanding of robust input shaping techniques and the compromises inherent to input shaper design was formed. In addition, input shaping was compared to other command generation techniques, namely lowpass and notch filtering, and proven to be superior for vibration reduction in mechanical systems. Another, new class of input shapers was also introduced that limit the input shaper induced overshoot in human operated systems. Finally, a series of crane operator studies investigated the application of input shaping techniques to teleoperated cranes. These studies suggested that input shaping is able to dramatically improve remote crane operator performance. Ph. D.
