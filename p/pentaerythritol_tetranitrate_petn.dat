40|$|<b>Pentaerythritol</b> <b>tetranitrate</b> reductase (<b>PETN</b> reductase) degrades high {{explosive}} molecules including nitrate esters, nitroaromatics and cyclic triazine compounds. The enzyme also binds {{a variety of}} cyclic enones, including steroids; some steroids act as substrates whilst others are inhibitors. Understanding the basis of reactivity with cyclic enones requires structural information for the enzyme and key complexes formed with steroid substrates and inhibitors. The crystal structure of oxidised and reduced PETN reductase at 1. 5 A resolution establishes a close structural similarity to the beta/alpha-barrel flavoenzyme, old yellow enzyme. In complexes of oxidised PETN reductase with progesterone (an inhibitor), 1, 4 -androstadiene- 3, 17 -dione and prednisone (both substrates) the steroids are stacked over the si-face of the flavin in an orientation different from that reported for old yellow enzyme. The specifically reducible 1, 2 unsaturated bonds in 1, 4 -androstadiene- 3, 17 -dione and prednisone are not optimally aligned with the flavin N 5 in oxidised enzyme complexes. These structures suggest either relative "flipping" or shifting of the steroid {{with respect to the}} flavin when bound in different redox forms of the enzyme. Deuterium transfer from nicotinamide coenzyme to 1, 4 -androstadiene- 3, 17 -dione via the enzyme bound FMN indicates 1 alpha addition at the steroid C 2 atom. These studies rule out lateral motion of the steroid and indicate that the steroid orientation is "flipped" in different redox states of the enzyme. 1400...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The {{organic nitrate}} <b>pentaerythritol</b> <b>tetranitrate</b> is devoid of nitrate tolerance, {{which has been}} {{attributed}} to the induction of the antioxidant enzyme heme oxygenase (HO) - 1. With the present study, we tested whether chronic treatment with <b>pentaerythritol</b> <b>tetranitrate</b> can improve angiotensin II–induced vascular oxidative stress and dysfunction. In contrast to isosorbide- 5 mononitrate (75 mg/kg per day for 7 days), treatment with <b>pentaerythritol</b> <b>tetranitrate</b> (15 mg/kg per day for 7 days) improved the impaired endothelial and smooth muscle function and normalized vascular and cardiac reactive oxygen species production (mitochondria, NADPH oxidase activity, and uncoupled endothelial NO synthase), as assessed by dihydroethidine staining, lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence, and quantification of dihydroethidine oxidation products in angiotensin II (1 mg/kg per day for 7 days) –treated rats. The antioxidant features of <b>pentaerythritol</b> <b>tetranitrate</b> were recapitulated in spontaneously hypertensive rats. In addition to an increase in HO- 1 protein expression, <b>pentaerythritol</b> <b>tetranitrate</b> but not isosorbide- 5 mononitrate normalized vascular reactive oxygen species formation and augmented aortic protein levels of the tetrahydrobiopterin-synthesizing enzymes GTP-cyclohydrolase I and dihydrofolate reductase in angiotensin II–treated rats, thereby preventing endothelial NO synthase uncoupling. Haploinsufficiency of HO- 1 completely abolished the beneficial effects of <b>pentaerythritol</b> <b>tetranitrate</b> in angiotensin II–treated mice, whereas HO- 1 induction by hemin (25 mg/kg) mimicked the effect of <b>pentaerythritol</b> <b>tetranitrate.</b> Improvement of vascular function in this particular model of arterial hypertension by pentaerythrito...|$|R

Many enzymes exhibit tight specificity for particular substrates despite a close structural relationship to other nonreactive compounds. This tight specificity is especially remarkable and important biologically for the coenzymes NADH and NADPH. In the present study, we examined the preference of <b>pentaerythritol</b> <b>tetranitrate</b> reductase, an ‘old yellow enzyme’ family member, for the coenzymes NADPH over NADH. Using structural and mutagenesis studies, we have previously established that the coenzyme nicotinamide group is the key binding determinant in old yellow enzymes [Khan H et al.

We have now performed detailed transient-state studies using NAD(P) H and the nonreactive analogues 1, 4, 5, 6 -tetrahydroNAD(P) H [NAD(P) H 4], leading us to uncover an additional binding step in the reductive half-reaction of <b>pentaerythritol</b> <b>tetranitrate</b> reductase. We suggest that this initial binding step may primarily reflect binding of the adenine ribophosphate portion of the coenzyme, and that the second step reflects a rearrangement of the nicotinamide. Bipartite recognition, in which the adenine ribophosphate moiety localizes the coenzyme in the active site region, enables subsequent and localized searches of configurational space by the nicotinamide moiety to form the catalytically relevant charge-transfer complex.
