40|$|Due to {{its highly}} autonomy, the strapdown {{inertial}} navigation system (SINS) is widely used in unmanned underwater vehicles (UUV) navigation. Initial alignment is crucial because the initial alignment results {{will be used as}} the initial SINS value, which might affect the subsequent SINS results. Due to the rapid convergence of Earth meridians, there is a calculation overflow in conventional initial alignment algorithms, making conventional initial algorithms are invalid for <b>polar</b> UUV <b>navigation.</b> To overcome these problems, a polar initial alignment algorithm for UUV is proposed in this paper, which consists of coarse and fine alignment algorithms. Based on the principle of the conical slow drift of gravity, the coarse alignment algorithm is derived under the grid frame. By choosing the velocity and attitude as the measurement, the fine alignment with the Kalman filter (KF) is derived under the grid frame. Simulation and experiment are realized among polar, conventional and transversal initial alignment algorithms for <b>polar</b> UUV <b>navigation.</b> Results demonstrate that the proposed polar initial alignment algorithm can complete the initial alignment of UUV in the polar region rapidly and accurately...|$|R
40|$|To {{solve the}} {{unavailability}} {{of a traditional}} strapdown inertial navigation system (SINS) for unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) in the polar region, a <b>polar</b> grid <b>navigation</b> algorithm for UUVs is proposed in this paper.

The rapid convergence of Earth meridians and the serious polar environment make it difficult to establish the true heading of the UUV at a particular instant. Traditional SINS and traditional representation of position are not suitable in the polar region. Due to the restrictions of the complex underwater conditions in the polar region, a SINS based on the grid frame {{with the assistance of the}} OCTANS and the Doppler velocity log (DVL) is chosen for a UUV navigating in the polar region. Data fusion of the integrated navigation system is realized by a modified fuzzy adaptive Kalman filter (MFAKF). By neglecting the negative terms, and using T-S fuzzy logic in the adaptive regulation of the noise covariance, the proposed filter algorithm can improve navigation accuracy.

40|$|Abstract. The user {{interface}} for text messaging via SMS has changed little since {{the technology was}} introduced on cell phones. Authoring text with a phone keypad is tedious and error-prone. Furthermore, the cell phone intrudes into other activities while hands hold it for authoring. In this paper we suggest a future alternative {{user interface}} for SMS messages based on a round wristwatch device. Two button-wheels are used to access a round hi-res color display. Text input is done with a round soft keyboard that maps intuitively to the buttonwheels using the angular and radial movements of polar coordinates. Furthermore, a wristwatch device has an aesthetics that is less intrusive than a cell phone. Since the device is always deployed, authoring is easily interrupted to use the hands for other tasks. Informal user evaluation of a prototype implementation suggests that this novel round design provides an improved user experience for authoring SMS compared to cell phones.

We have then developed a new tomographic approach inspired on the physics of the hydrogen atom, which has been compared to previous successful but somewhat awkward methods (using a voxel representation) and employed to retrieve the Electronic Density field from the simulated TEC data. These tomographic inversion results using simulated data demonstrate the significant impact of GNSS-R and GNSS-NO data: 3 D ionospheric Electron Density fields are retrieved over the oceans quite accurately, even as, in the spirit of this initial study, the simulation and inversion approaches avoided intensive computation and sophisticated algorithmic elements (spatio-temporal smoothing).

More recently, active microwave imaging sensors (radars) have been developed to extend our capability to study the Earth surface processes. Imaging radars, flown on Seasat (1978) and the Shuttle (1981, 1984), acquired synoptic images of a variety of geologic, biologic, and oceanographic features and provided new insight in some of the land and ocean processes. Subsurface synoptic imaging was achieved for the first time in some of the arid regions of the world. Soil moisture distribution after a rainstorm was clearly delineated, opening the possibility of its monitoring on a global basis. Polar ice distribution and dynamics over large areas in the Beaufort Sea were monitored over a three-month period, thus allowing the possibility of operational observation of ice dynamics in support of <b>polar</b> <b>navigation.</b> The successful development and flight of these spaceborne imaging radars was the result of major technological developments in the 1970 s. They used some of the largest spaceborne lightweight planar array antennas (2 X 10 m) with printed radiating elements. The transmitters were fully solid state and generated a 1 kw peak power signal at L-band (1. 2 Ghz). The processing of the received data to generate the high-resolution (25 to 40 m) imagery was done using both optical and digital processors. More advanced imaging radar systems are under development. Multispectral, multipolarization imaging radar systems are under development for flight in the late 1980 s, thus extending our capability of detailed studies of the Earth surface processes and the nature of its cover. Extremely fast SAR digital processors are under development using the most advanced integrated circuits and allowing real-time processing of the data. This corresponds to a computational capability of 6 X 10 ^ 9 operations/s.
