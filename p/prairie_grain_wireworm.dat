40|$|Quantifying {{the spatial}} {{distribution}} of snow is crucial to predict and assess its water resource potential and understand land–atmosphere interactions. High-resolution remote sensing of snow depth has been limited to terrestrial and airborne laser scanning and more recently with application of structure from motion (SfM) techniques to airborne (manned and unmanned) imagery. In this study, photography from a small unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) was used to generate digital surface models (DSMs) and orthomosaics for snow cover at a cultivated agricultural Canadian prairie and a sparsely vegetated Rocky Mountain alpine ridgetop site using SfM. The accuracy and repeatability of this method to quantify snow depth, changes in depth and its spatial variability was assessed for different terrain types over time. Root mean square errors in snow depth estimation from differencing snow-covered and non-snow-covered DSMs were 8. 8  cm for a short <b>prairie</b> <b>grain</b> stubble surface, 13. 7  cm for a tall <b>prairie</b> <b>grain</b> stubble surface and 8. 5  cm for an alpine mountain surface. This technique provided useful information on maximum snow accumulation and snow-covered area depletion at all sites, while temporal changes in snow depth could also be quantified at the alpine site due to the deeper snowpack and consequent higher signal-to-noise ratio. The application of SfM to UAV photographs returns meaningful information in areas with mean snow depth [*]>[*]  30  cm, but the direct observation of snow depth depletion of shallow snowpacks with this method is not feasible. Accuracy varied with surface characteristics, sunlight and wind speed during the flight, with the most consistent performance found for wind speeds [*]<  10  m s − 1, clear skies, high sun angles and surfaces with negligible vegetation cover...|$|R

50|$|In 1946 Gibbings {{was elected}} as a {{delegate}} to the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool; within six years {{he was on the}} board of directors and three years after that made vice-president. In 1960 he became the Pool's first Saskatchewan-born president and served as such until 1969. In that capacity Gibbings hired its first general manager and reinforced the management team by hiring employees who had been trained in accounting and other management skills. The Farm Service Division, which dealt with production supplies and services, was also added and agrologists were hired to work directly with farmers — at that time an innovation in the grain elevator business. During his Presidency Gibbings worked hard to knit the four <b>prairie</b> <b>grain</b> elevator Co-operatives into one; it was his view that the Alberta Wheat Pool, Saskatchewan Wheat Pool, Manitoba Wheat Pool and the United Grain Growers should amalgamate to better serve prairie farmers. He did not succeed in this endeavour, but there is evidence of some collaboration: all four organizations became members of X-CAN Grain Limited, a company established to market grains not covered under the Canadian Wheat Board. Furthermore, the Pools joined with Federated Co-operatives in the manufacture and supply of fertilizers and agricultural chemicals.|$|R

40|$|In Canada, {{freight rates}} on exports of grains and {{oilseeds}} from the prairie region have been regulated since 1897. Until the 1960 s, {{the stability and}} assurance of these rates contributed to development of the prairie-based grains economy. However, in recent years, these regulated rates have become a significant subsidy for prairie farmers due to inflated costs of transportation. As a result, the issue of regulated freight rates for <b>prairie</b> <b>grains</b> and oilseeds has {{become a matter of}} intense debate, since they have the effect of raising the on-farm price of export grains. Crities of the regulated freight rates claim that they have actually inhibited diversification of economic activities in the prairie region because they increase the price of feed grain, a key input for the livestock industry. In this analysis, two quantitative models were used to estimate the farm and secondary level impacts of changing from subsidized to full compensatory rates for various grains. The analysis showed that loss of the subsidy would result in much reduced levels of farm income and consequent loss of secondary economic activities unless the subsidy was provided in some other form. Indexes of diversification were not significantly affected by changes in the freight rate structure. Thus, the hypothesis that statutory grain freight rates are the primary factor responsible for lack of diversification in the prairie economy is not supported. There exists a need for identifying factors that may impede the process of diversification of the regional economies. ...|$|R
40|$|The Canadian <b>Prairie</b> <b>grain</b> {{collection}} system requires modernization. Centralization rather than replacement is being proposed {{as the answer}} to the demand for efficiency. The concern that motivated the study was for grain producers whose stake in the system has not been fully incorporated in analysis to date. Will centralization prove more efficient when the grain producer's stake is fully considered? The system of grain collection defined in the study consists of 1) farm storage, 2) trucking, 3) roads, 4) country elevators and 5) railways. A cost minimization approach was adopted to analyze the problem which is incomplete but manageable and important. A transportation - location model was used in the analysis. The model is rooted in a technique developed by Stollsteimer (1963) and incorporates a modification by Warrack and Fletcher (1970) to provide a sub-optimal solution for large problems. Modifications and additions were made to the Stollsteimer model in order to incorporate characteristics of the present system and also to deal with a range of decision variables (policy). A computer program was constructed to aid in analysis of ten separate cases for an area of Saskatchewan. The ten cases represent a range of "what if" situations. The results indicated that the savings from centralization in the study area are modest. The efficient number of grain delivery points varies widely and depends on a number of decisions not yet taken and a number of questions not yet confronted...|$|R

5|$|Grasshoppers eat large {{quantities}} of foliage both as adults and during their development, and can be serious pests of arid land and <b>prairies.</b> Pasture, <b>grain,</b> forage, vegetable and other crops can be affected. Grasshoppers often bask in the sun, and thrive in warm sunny conditions, so drought stimulates an increase in grasshopper populations. A single season of drought is not normally sufficient to stimulate a massive population increase, but several successive dry seasons can do so, especially if the intervening winters are mild so {{that large numbers of}} nymphs survive. Although sunny weather stimulates growth, there needs to be an adequate food supply for the increasing grasshopper population. This means that although precipitation is needed to stimulate plant growth, prolonged periods of cloudy weather will slow nymphal development.|$|R
