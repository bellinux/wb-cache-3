25|$|Industrialists soon {{brought the}} nascent field of {{psychology}} {{to bear on}} the study of scientific management techniques for improving workplace efficiency. This field was at first called economic psychology or business psychology; later, industrial psychology, employment psychology, or <b>psychotechnology.</b> An important early study examined workers at Western Electric's Hawthorne plant in Cicero, Illinois from 1924–1932. With funding from the Laura Spelman Rockefeller Fund and guidance from Australian psychologist Elton Mayo, Western Electric experimented on thousands of factory workers to assess their responses to illumination, breaks, food, and wages. The researchers came to focus on workers' responses to observation itself, and the term Hawthorne effect is now used to describe the fact that people work harder when they think they're being watched.|$|E

5000|$|Smirnov {{has been}} {{characterized}} in the media as a Rasputin-like character with [...] "almost mystical powers of persuasion". According to his wife Rusalkina, the Soviet military enlisted Smirnov's <b>psychotechnology</b> in the 1980s to combat the Mujahideen and treat post-traumatic stress syndrome in Russian soldiers {{during the war in}} Afghanistan. Smirnov's background included military research, and the care of drug addiction and mental illness. He founded the <b>Psychotechnology</b> Research Institute at the Peoples' Friendship University of Russia to work on ideas like [...] "psychocorrection", a term he used to denote the use of subliminal messages to alter a subject's will, or even modify a person's personality without their knowledge.|$|E

The {{purpose of this study was}} to consider what contributions the research, theory and practice of state-of-consciousness (SOC) <b>psychotechnologies</b> could make to the field of instructional technology. Many extraordinary claims have been made regarding SOC <b>psychotechnologies,</b> suggesting that they can profoundly affect human capabilities. The intent was not to evaluate their effectiveness as performance technologies, but rather to consider what differing theoretical perspectives, instructional techniques and applications they can provide. This review of the literature revealed that SOC <b>psychotechnologies</b> are dramatically different tools, both in conceptualization and utilization. The literature regarding consciousness, sensory restriction and the body/mind connection helped to elucidate differences between SOC <b>psychotechnologies</b> and traditional instructional technologies. Differences were also evident in this examination of selected research and writings regarding biofeedback, meditation and hypnosis. Substantially different goals, techniques and cognitive/behavioral effects were all identified and detailed. These techniques as well as other new ones have generated an extensive array of instructional innovations utilizing SOC <b>psychotechnologies.</b> It was apparent that these innovations were developing within the learner cognitive/behavioral abilities that, for the most part, are overlooked by current instructional design theory and practice. Seven cognitive/behavioral abilities which are identified in this study include: body/mind self-regulation, brainwave entrainment, self-normalization through unstressing, sleep learning, the use of internal visualizations as behavioral prompts, sensory management and cognitive restructuring. Foremost among the contributions that SOC <b>psychotechnologies</b> can make are the changed perspectives they provide regarding how we best learn. While instructional technologists endorse the view that behavior can be managed by selecting the appropriate stimulus, SOC psychotechnologists suggest that behavior can also be controlled by altering a learner's state of consciousness. They suggest that the restriction of sensory cues can affect learning as much as the addition of sensory cues; moreover, some defined learning as more than a mental event and proposed that it was body/mind experience which could be affected by psychophysiological interventions, e. g., body movement, music, and monotonous stimulation, to name a few...|$|R

40|$|The {{study of}} {{personal}} qualities’ {{development and the}} peculiarities of value-motivational aspects in groups with various manifestation levels of these qualities are of particular interest for contemporary researchers {{as well as for}} practicing psychologists who develop <b>psychotechnologies</b> aimed at personal value-motivational sphere management. This article suggests new approaches for analyzing and studying value-motivational aspects of personal activity, predetermining innovation activity. It also provides an analysis of a comparative empirical study that evolves value-motivational characteristics in students with various innovativeness levels. The author submits a detailed theoretical analysis of innovation behavior based on manifestations of personal value-motivational activity. Resulting from the given theoretical analysis, a suggestion is made that the manifestation and development of personal potential is determined by values and motives. Personal innovation potential is regarded as an effective combination of various activity forms, and innovativeness is a personal quality that is manifested by a form of effective activity. Currently, psychologists are highly interested in evolving value-motivational structure of personal innovativeness. The given article discusses the results of an empirical study aimed at revealing value- motivational peculiarities of students in groups with various levels of innovativeness manifestations. Indicative peculiarities of value-motivational characteristics are revealed in groups with low, middle and high levels of innovative qualities. Furthermore, gender differences in innovativeness manifestation and value-motivational characteristics of this quality in young men and women are thoroughly described. New data concerning the personal and gender specifics of the value-motivational sphere and innovativeness manifestation in young adults are presented using a thoroughly described research strategy as well as results substantiation...|$|R
5000|$|It {{has been}} argued by several {{researchers}} that literacy {{is a form of}} <b>psychotechnology.</b> [...] According to David Olson, for example, using written language opened three distinct avenues of human development: the emergence of explicit, autonomous prose; the ability to distinguish data from interpretation; and the growth of meta-language. All of these avenues are considered essential for systematic thought, as exemplified in the exponential growth of human culture following the advent of literacy.|$|E

50|$|In 1928 he was {{appointed}} lecturer in <b>psychotechnology</b> at the Catholic college {{of higher education in}} Tilburg (now the University of Tilburg) and in 1933 professor of business economics and <b>psychotechnology</b> at the same institution. During the pre-war mobilisation of the Netherlands (1939-1940) De Quay became a lieutenant in the reserve. In July 1940 he formed the Triumvirate of the controversial nationalist Dutch Union with Louis Einthoven and Hans Linthorst Homan. This Union was controversial because its leaders suggested partial collaboration with the German occupiers. In August 1940 De Quay started secret meetings with the fascistic Nationaal Front in oder to fuse the two organisations. During these talks De Quay called himself a fascist, the Union a fascistic organisation and said that he rejected democracy. In May and June of the same year he was government commissioner for labour at the Ministry of Social Affairs. In this position he encouraged the Dutch population to seek employment in Germany. From July 1942 to June 1943 he was interned in Haaren, after which he went into hiding from the occupation authorities. This lasted until June 1943, when he went into hiding. Following the liberation of the area south of the rivers in late 1944, he became chairman of the Board of Commissioners for Agriculture, Industry, Trade and Commerce set up to restore the national economy.|$|E

40|$|In our society, to-day human safety {{problems}} in prevention of public threats are increasingly gaining {{more and more}} attention. In the century of modern technologies, however paradoxical it could be, potential of safety in the society does not increase, while the level of threat increases, and the types, forms and negative consequences of threats expand. In the abuse of individuals, crime committing including, new innovative technologies are introduced, which are still not sufficiently recognized and studied. The aim of the author is to turn the attention {{to one of the}} possible new approaches in work of law enforcement authorities – psycho- and neurotechnologies and the topicality of the theme. The author points to the aspects of psychotechnological cognition and specific aspects of abuse, development outlines of neurolaw, as well as implementation practice of <b>psychotechnology</b> study courses and the possibilities in lawyers’ professional education, not claiming to have a comprehensive and deep presentation of the topic. Psycho- and neurotechnology use in law enforcement authority work is comparatively new.

40|$|Techniques {{for using}} {{multiple}} regression (MR) {{as a general}} variance-accounting procedure of great flexibility, power, and fidelity to research aims in both manipula-tive and observational psychological research are presented. As a prelude, the identity of MR and fixed-model analysis of variance/covariance (AV/ACV) is sketched. This requires an exposition of means of expressing nominal scale (qualita-tive) data as independent variables in MR. Attention is given to methods for handling interactions, curvilinearity, missing data, and covariates, for either un-correlated or correlated independent variables in MR. Finally, the relative roles of AV/ACV and MR in data analysis are described, and the practical advantages of the latter are set forth. If you should say to a mathematical statistician that you have discovered that linear multiple regression analysis and the analysis of variance (and covariance) are identical systems, he would mutter something like, "Of course—general linear model, " and you might have trouble maintaining his atten-tion. If you should say this to a typical psy-chologist, you would be met with incredulity, or worse. Yet it is true, and in its truth lie possibilities for more relevant and therefore more powerful exploitation of research data. That psychologists would find strange the claimed equivalence of multiple regression (MR) and the fixed-model analysis of variance (AV) and covariance (ACV) is readily under-standable. The textbooks in "psychological" statistics treat these matters quite separately, with wholly different algorithms, nomencla-ture, output, and examples. MR is generally illustrated by examples drawn from the <b>psychotechnology</b> of educa-tional or personnel selection, usually the pre-diction of some criterion (e. g., freshman grade point average) from predictors (e. g., verba...|$|E
