5|$|Clashes in {{the capital}} between Habré's FAN and pro-Libyan groups became {{progressively}} more serious. On 22 March 1980, a minor incident, as in 1979, triggered the second battle of N'Djamena. In ten days, the clashes between the FAN and Goukouni's FAP, which both had 1,000–1,500 troops in the city, caused thousands of casualties and the flight of about half the capital's population. The few remaining French troops, who left on 4 May, proclaimed themselves neutral, as did the Zairean <b>peace</b> <b>force.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{fighting}} with Libya, the imposition by Nigeria {{of an economic}} boycott, and international pressure led to a new international peace conference in Lagos in August, to which all eleven factions present in Chad participated. A new accord was signed on 21 August, under which a new GUNT was to be formed, open to all factions. The French troops were to leave Chad and {{be replaced by a}} multinational African <b>peace</b> <b>force.</b> The new GUNT took office in November, with Goukouni President, Kamougué Vice-President, Habré Defence Minister and Acyl Foreign Minister. Despite the presence of Habré, the new composition of the GUNT had enough pro-Libyans to satisfy Gaddafi.|$|E

It {{is equipped with a}} substantial number of US-made M48 Patton main battle tanks and artillery weapons. The Turkish Air Force, Turkish Navy and Turkish Coast Guard also have a presence in Northern Cyprus. Although formally part of Turkish 4th Army, headquartered in İzmir, the sensitivities of the Cyprus situation means that the commander of the Cyprus Turkish <b>Peace</b> <b>Force</b> also reports directly to the Turkish General Staff in Ankara. The Cyprus Turkish <b>Peace</b> <b>Force</b> is deployed principally along the Green Line and in locations where hostile amphibious landings might take place.|$|E

25|$|The Settlement Plan was an {{agreement}} between the ethnically Saharawi Polisario Front and Morocco on the organization of a referendum, which would constitute an expression of self-determination {{for the people of}} Western Sahara, leading either to full independence, or integration with the kingdom of Morocco.

25|$|On 5 May, the OAS Peace Committee {{arrived in}} Santo Domingo, a second {{definite}} cease fire agreement was then signed ending the main {{phase of the}} civil war. Under the Act of Santo Domingo, OAS was tasked with overseeing {{the implementation of the}} peace deal as well as distributing food and medication through the capital. The treaties failed to fully prevent violations such as small scale firefights and sniper fire. A day later OAS members established the Inter-American <b>Peace</b> <b>Force</b> (IAPF) with the goal of serving as a peacekeeping formation in the Dominican Republic. IAPF consisted of 1,748 Brazilian, Paraguayan, Nicaraguan, Costa Rican, Salvadoran and Honduran troops and was headed by Brazilian general Hugo Panasco Alvim, with US Army General, Bruce Palmer, serving as his deputy commander.|$|E
25|$|International {{cooperation}} {{is an important}} theme for the party. This includes development cooperation with underdeveloped countries. GreenLeft wants to increase spending on development aid to 0.8% of the gross national product. It wants to open the European markets to goods from Third World countries, under conditions of fair trade. In order to ensure free and fair trade, it wants to increase and democratise international economic organisations such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. The party also favours greater international control over financial markets. GreenLeft favours European integration, but is critical about the current policies of the European Commission. It favoured the European Constitution, but after it was voted down in the 2005 referendum, GreenLeft advocated a new treaty which emphasised democracy and subsidiarity. The party is critical about the war against terrorism. It wants to strengthen the peacekeeping powers of the United Nations and reform the Dutch armed forces into a <b>peace</b> <b>force,</b> with the functions of NATO to {{be taken over by}} the European Union and the United Nations.|$|E

500|$|Several {{days before}} the summit, NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer {{described}} Afghanistan as [...] "priority number one". During the summit, NATO members officially agreed that the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) would take on command of four additional Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) (one in Mazar-e-Sharif, Meymana, Feyzabad and Baghlan), falling short of the initial target of five. Until then ISAF only provided security in around the capital city Kabul and commanded one PRT in Kunduz. The 26 members agreed to contribute between them an additional 600 troops (23.08 per country) and three helicopters to the Afghan mission. The three helicopters came from Turkey, and had gone back within three months. NATO also vowed to beef up its Afghanistan <b>peace</b> <b>force</b> from 6,500 to 10,000 {{to help make the}} Afghan presidential election, 2004 secure, but no actual agreement for that many additional troops was made.|$|E

UNPF-HQ controlled UNCRO, the United Nations Preventive Deployment Force (UNPREDEP) in the Republic of Macedonia, and UNPROFORwhich {{was confined to}} Bosnia and Herzegovina from late March. The UNPF-HQ commander was French Lieutenant General Bernard Janvier. In July, South Korean diplomat Byung Suk Min was appointed as head of UNCRO, with Major General Eid Kamal Al-Rodan of the Royal Jordanian Army as the mission's military commander. Before Al-Rodan, the post was held by Canadian Lieutenant General Raymond Crabbe. UNCRO was initially deployed to the same parts of Croatia as UNPROFOR, however contemporary UNSC documents no longer referred to them as UNPAs—applying the designations of Sector East, West, North, and South, or [...] "areas {{under the control of}} the local Serb authorities" [...] instead. One group of sources refers to the areas of UNCRO deployment as UNPAs, another reflects the UNSC practice and omits the acronym, while others refer to the areas as [...] "former UNPAs".|$|E

[...] In order to convince al-Badr to come the conference, Noman announced that he personally would head the republican delegation at Khamir, and that Sallal would stay in San'a. Al-Badr and his ranking chiefs did not attend the conference, but a handful of pro-royalist sheiks were present. The conference named a committee of five tribal and four religious leaders who were charged with seeking out the [...] "beguiled brothers", al-Badr and his friends. Noman's effort, including a private promise to reach a withdrawal of Egyptian troops, was backed by Nasser. Radio Cairo hailed the Khamir conference as the [...] "dawn of a new era." [...] Sallal called the talks [...] "a complete success", while al-Badr stated that [...] "It is essential that the conflict which has devastated our beloved country be brought to an end by peaceful negotiations between the Yemeni people themselves." [...] However, by early June, when Noman said that Egypt's 50,000 troops would have {{to be replaced by a}} joint royalist-republican [...] <b>peace</b> <b>force,</b> the Nasserites lost interest in the deal. After Noman flew to Cairo to protest directly to Nasser, Sallal threw seven civilian [...] Cabinet ministers into jail. Noman resigned, saying [...] "It is obvious that Sallal and his cronies are more interested in war than [...] peace". Sallal soon named a new Cabinet to replace Noman's, with 13 military men and two civilians.|$|E
