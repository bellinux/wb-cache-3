5|$|In {{many of the}} works, {{including}} the original series, Warhol drastically simplified the gold medallion that appears on Campbell's Soup cans by replacing the paired allegorical figures with a flat yellow disk. In most variations, the only hint of three-dimensionality came from the shading on the tin lid. Otherwise the image was flat. The works with torn labels are perceived as metaphors {{of life in the}} sense that even <b>packaged</b> <b>food</b> must meet its end. They are often described as expressionistic.|$|E
5|$|Once {{too large}} for Sanders to manage, Kentucky Fried Chicken grew to {{overwhelm}} John Y. Brown as well. In July 1971, Brown sold the company to the Connecticut-based Heublein, a <b>packaged</b> <b>food</b> and drinks corporation, for US$285 million (around US$1.6 billion in 2013). Brown personally gained around $35 million from the sale. Reuters opined that the takeover probably saved the company from disaster. Heublein planned to increase KFC's volume with its sales and marketing expertise.|$|E
5|$|Suspicious, Skinner {{learns that}} Linguini is Gusteau's illegitimate {{son and the}} {{rightful}} heir to the restaurant, which jeopardizes Skinner's control of the restaurant and the lucrative <b>packaged</b> <b>food</b> enterprise he formed using the restaurant's reputation after Gusteau's death. Remy discovers the evidence of Linguini's inheritance and, after eluding Skinner, gives it to Linguini, who deposes Skinner as owner. The restaurant continues to thrive, and Linguini and Colette develop a budding romance, leaving Remy feeling left out. Remy finds that his clan has come to Paris as well, and is taken to their new lair, but despite his father Django's attempts to rid his son of his admiration of humans, Remy leaves.|$|E

The first breakfast cereal, Granula was invented in the United States in 1863 by James Caleb Jackson, operator of the Jackson Sanitorium in Dansville, New York.

Dan Koeppel of Adweek believed that the chain had been suffering from corporate neglect, menu stagnation and mixed marketing messages; Nancy Giges of Advertising Age felt that the chain had been [...] "smartly revived" [...] by R.
