5|$|Since {{these first}} {{landmark}} GWA studies, {{there have been}} two general trends. One has been towards larger and larger sample sizes. At the end of 2011, the largest sample sizes were in the range of 200,000 individuals. The reason is the drive towards reliably detecting risk-SNPs that have smaller odds ratios and lower allele frequency. Another trend has been towards the use of more narrowly defined phenotypes, such as blood lipids, proinsulin or similar biomarkers. These are called intermediate phenotypes, and their analyses may be of value to functional research into biomarkers. A variation of GWAS uses <b>participants</b> <b>that</b> are first-degree relatives of people with a disease. This type of study has been named genome-wide association study by proxy (GWAX).|$|E
5|$|Although the {{exchange}} rate stability sustained by the Bretton Woods system facilitated expanding international trade, this early success masked its underlying design flaw, wherein there existed no mechanism for increasing the supply of international reserves to support continued growth in trade. The system began experiencing insurmountable market pressures and deteriorating cohesion among its key participants in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Central banks needed more U.S. dollars to hold as reserves, but were unable to expand their money supplies if doing so meant exceeding their dollar reserves and threatening their exchange rate pegs. To accommodate these needs, the Bretton Woods system depended on the United States to run dollar deficits. As a consequence, the dollar's value began exceeding its gold backing. During the early 1960s, investors could sell gold for a greater dollar exchange rate in London than in the United States, signaling to market <b>participants</b> <b>that</b> the dollar was overvalued. Belgian-American economist Robert Triffin defined this problem {{now known as the}} Triffin dilemma, in which a country's national economic interests conflict with its international objectives as the custodian of the world's reserve currency.|$|E

25|$|In 1980, a {{group of}} musicians and music merchants met to {{standardize}} an interface that new instruments could use to communicate control instructions with other instruments and computers. This standard was dubbed Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) and resulted from a collaboration between leading manufacturers, initially Sequential Circuits, Oberheim, Roland—and later, other <b>participants</b> <b>that</b> included Yamaha, Korg, and Kawai. A paper was authored by Dave Smith of Sequential Circuits and proposed to the Audio Engineering Society in 1981. Then, in August 1983, the MIDI Specification 1.0 was finalized.|$|E

Troupes may consist of both genders and are not separated into age divisions. The largest general gymnastics exhibition is the quadrennial World Gymnaestrada which was first held in 1939. In 1984 Gymnastics for All was officially recognized first as a Sport Program by the FIG (International Gymnastic Federation), and subsequently by national gymnastic federations worldwide with <b>participants</b> <b>that</b> now number 30 million.|$|E
25|$|Secret sharing (also called secret splitting) {{consists}} of methods for distributing a secret amongst {{a group of}} participants, each of whom is allocated {{a share of the}} secret. The secret can be reconstructed only when a sufficient number of shares, of possibly different types, are combined together; individual shares are of no use on their own. A secret sharing scheme is perfect if every collection of <b>participants</b> <b>that</b> does not meet the criteria for obtaining the secret, has no additional knowledge of what the secret is than does an individual with no share.|$|E

25|$|It was {{believed}} {{by the first}} <b>participants</b> <b>that</b> considerable capital would be raised for establishment of an American cooperative association and {{that a number of}} other branch organizations would emerge throughout the New York region, inspired by the Albany group's activity and success. Neither of these expectations were realized, however, as it was only with great difficulty that a sum just under $7,000 was raised and no other local associations would immediately follow. Moreover, a majority of the phalanx's financing came from outside sources, as over time 61% of the association's stock would be held by outsiders, including 527 shares held by a sympathetic consortium of merchants from New York City.|$|E
25|$|Typically, several <b>participants</b> <b>that</b> are not {{permanent}} members of the G20 are extended invitations to participate in the summits. Each year, the Chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations; the Chair of the African Union; and a representative of the New Partnership for Africa's Development are invited in their capacities as leaders of their organisations and as heads of government of their home states. Additionally, the leaders of the Financial Stability Board, the International Labour Organization, the International Monetary Fund, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the United Nations, the World Bank Group and the World Trade Organization are invited and participate in pre-summit planning within the policy purview of their respective organisation. Spain is a permanent non-member invitee.|$|E

30|$|Overall, four <b>participants</b> {{mentioned}} <b>that</b> {{although a}} collaborative environment {{is useful to}} share ideas and findings, {{it is difficult to}} perform visual analysis simultaneously. For example, in the double and multiple workspace conditions (see Figure 8 B and 8 C), one <b>participant</b> pointed out <b>that</b> he felt like he was racing his partner to discover more findings. <b>Participants</b> suggested <b>that</b> they would also like to have an isolated workspace (such as a desktop environment) for solving analytical problems.

25|$|A {{rotator cuff}} tear {{can be caused}} by the {{weakening}} of the rotator cuff tendons. This weakening {{can be caused by}} age or how often the rotator cuff is used. Adults over the age of 60 are more susceptible to a rotator cuff tear. According to a study in the Journal of Orthopaedic Surgery and Traumatology the frequency of rotator cuff tears can increase with age. The study shows the <b>participants</b> <b>that</b> were the ages of 70–90 years old had a rate of rotator cuff tears that were 1 to 5. The participants who were 90+ years old the frequency of a rotator cuff tear jumped to 1 to 3. This study shows that with an increase in age there is also an increase in the probability of a rotator cuff tear.|$|E

Dr. Wagner Jr. and Astro Rey Jr. earned their passage to the finals by defeating Mocho Cota and Guerrero de la Muerte in the first round and the brother team of Atlantis and Atlantico in the second. Silver King and Shocker qualified for the finals by defeating Pierroth Jr. and Chicago Express and the team of Bestia Salvaje and Corazón Salvaje. In the finals Silver King and Shocker overcame Dr. Wagner Jr. and Astro Rey Jr. to win the 1995 Torneo Gran Alternativa. Over the subsequent years Shocker became one of the main event wrestlers of CMLL, winning various singles and tag team titles.|$|E
25|$|Motivation is {{a factor}} that {{encourages}} a person to perform and succeed at the task at hand. In an experiment done by Roebers, Moga and Schneider (2001), participants were placed in either forced report, free report or free report plus incentive groups. In each group, {{they found that the}} amount of correct information recalled did not differ, yet in the group where participants were given an incentive they had higher accuracy results. This means that presenting participants with an encouragement to provide correct information motivates them to be more precise. However, this is only true if the perception is that success is providing correct information. When it is believed that success is the completion of the task rather than the accuracy of that completion, the number of responses is higher, yet its accuracy is lowered. This shows that the results are dependent on how success is defined to the participant. In the referred experiment, the <b>participants</b> <b>that</b> were placed in the forced response group had the lowest overall accuracy; they had no motivation to provide accurate responses and were forced to respond even when they were unsure of the answer. Another study done by Hill RD, Storandt M, and Simeone C tested the impact of memory skills training and external reward on free recall of serial word lists. Effects similar to those reported in the previous study were seen in children—in contrast to older learners.|$|E
