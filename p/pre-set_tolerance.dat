40|$|The quasicontinuum (QC) {{method is}} a coarse-graining {{technique}} {{for reducing the}} complexity of atomistic simulations in a static and quasistatic setting. In this paper we give an a-posteriori error analysis for the quasicontinuum method in one dimension. We consider atomistic models with Lennard–Jones type finite-range interactions. We prove that, for a stable QC solution with a sufficiently small residual, which is computed in a discrete Sobolev-type norm, there exists an exact solution of the atomistic model problem for which an a-posteriori error estimate holds. We then derive practically computable bounds on the residual and on the inf-sup constants which measure {{the stability of the}} QC solution. Finally, we supplement the QC method with a proximal point optimization method with local error-control. We prove that the parameters can be adjusted so that at each step of the optimization algorithm there exists an exact solution to a related atomistic problem whose distance to the numerical solution is smaller than a <b>pre-set</b> <b>tolerance.</b> Key words and phrases: atomistic material models, quasicontinuum method, error analysis, adaptivity, stabilit...|$|E
40|$|The radiosity {{equation}} is examined, and {{is found to}} contain a previously unexploited symmetry. This symmetry is formalized, and a solution method previously unusable {{in the field of}} computer graphics (conjugate gradients) is shown to be superior to all methods currently in use. A detailed analysis of all solution techniques previously applied to the radiosity problem is conducted, and results presented;So-called 2 ̆ 2 hierarchical methods 2 ̆ 2 have reduced the operational complexity of the N-body problem from O(N[superscript] 2) to O(N log N) assuming a <b>pre-set</b> error <b>tolerance.</b> An algorithm following the same basic tenets has been applied to radiosity rendering by other researchers, and has reduced the operational complexity from O(N[superscript] 2) to (arguably) O(N);Shortcomings in the state-of-the-art hierarchical radiosity method are pointed out, and enhancements are offered. A consistent treatment of various types of error is found to be absent from present methods. Catastrophic error is possible in the visibility assessment between two polygons. A self-consistency check is possible during the solution process, but never exploited;Until now, supercomputer-class computers have not been used to solve radiosity problems at a production-quality level even though realistic image synthesis has always been a prodigious consumer of computer time. A state-of-the-art hierarchical radiosity code is implemented on an nCUBE- 2 parallel computer, and discussed in detail. The algorithm is found to have ample sources of parallelism, in both data- and operational modes. Its performance is analyzed in detail;The hierarchical method has only been applied to realistic image synthesis since 1991. Not surprisingly, many avenues of further research are open. Some are pointed out, and include: analytic determination of coupling factors, quantifying discretization error, incorporating specular light reflection modes into the hierarchical treatment, and exploring what other important physical problems might benefit from the hierarchical approach...|$|R
40|$|In the Netherlands, the EU-mandated {{nationwide}} {{monitoring programme}} and {{emergency response plan}} for radioactivity in food is implemented by RIKILT (the Dutch institute for food safety) {{by means of the}} National Monitoring Network for Radioactivity in Food (LMRV). The LMRV consists of 48 individual gamma spectrometers (Food Monitoring System, or FMS) that require little maintenance, are hosted at food processing companies and institutes throughout the Netherlands, and are operated by local personnel. From 2010 to 2013, approximately 900 samples of milk and 500 samples of other food categories were analysed on the FMSs annually, and another 1400 in the specialized radionuclide laboratories operated by RIKILT. The anthropogenic radionuclide cesium- 137 (137 Cs) was detected in 93 out of 11, 143 samples (0. 8 %), mostly in wild mushrooms, game and honey. Two samples of wild boar exceeded the limit of 600 Bq/kg. In case of a nuclear accident the FMSs are used to validate the radioactive deposition calculated by dispersion models by measuring radionuclides in grass samples. No deposition of artificial radionuclides was measured in the Netherlands after the Fukushima nuclear incident. The precision of the FMSs is within the <b>pre-set</b> <b>tolerance</b> limits of 80 - 120 % for 137 Cs, cobalt- 60 (60 Co) and iodine- 131 (131 I). For potassium- 40 (40 K) a systematic error of + 10 % was observed. The recalibration of the FMSs in 2012 resulted in a reduction of almost 40 % in the variation of the precision for 131 I (compared to 2010 and 2011). This article describes the network and the individual FMSs, the routine measurements of food and special measurements in case of radioactive contamination, and the performance of the network. </p...|$|E
