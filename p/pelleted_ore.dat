40|$|A {{large number}} of {{industries}} in this world are now producing iron, either by the root of directly or indirectly. India is now not only producing iron <b>ore</b> <b>pellets</b> but also exporting it to other countries. Use of iron <b>ore</b> <b>pellets</b> not only increase the productivity of the plant but also produce good quality iron. So {{it is essential to}} know about the various factors which affect the reducibility of the iron <b>ore</b> <b>pellet.</b> In our project we aim at studying the effect of size of iron <b>ore</b> <b>pellet</b> on its reduction kinetics {{and in the course of}} our experimentation we aim at arriving at particular pellet size that gives both increases in productivity and decrease coke rate. Pellets are approximately spherical lumps formed by agglomeration of the crushed iron ore fines in presence of moisture and binder, on subsequent induration at 1300 °C. In these times with the areas of iron ore use increasing, it is very important to use raw materials that not only increase the productivity of plant but also produce a better quality iron. Blast furnace raw materials have changed in character greatly in the last 2 or 3 decades. Formerly, they used to be raw iron ores, raw lime stone and coke. There are now being increasingly being replaced by pre fluxed sinter and pellets and liquid and gaseous fuels. Few examples of revolutionary changes brought to the present day iron making industries by use of pellets are Essar steel, TATA steel, Jindal Steel etc. Reduction of various sizes of iron <b>ore</b> <b>pellets</b> were carried out with non coking coal in a stainless steel reactor of size 10 * 5 cm. The stainless steel reactor was half filled with non coking coal powder of size - 72 # and the weighed oven dried pellet was placed centrally on this non coking coal powder bed and then the remaining portion of the reactor was filled with coal powder then it was covered with an air tight cover having a hole for escape of gases. The reactor was introduced into a muffle furnace and soaked there for 1 hour. The reactor was then cool inside the muffle furnace up to 1500 C and then taken out and cooled in air and weight loss was calculated by electronic balance and hence % of reduction was calculated as [(Weight loss in iron <b>ore</b> <b>pellet</b> X 100) / (Total initial O 2 present in iron <b>ore</b> <b>pellet</b> with iron) ] We can conclude that as we increase the size of iron <b>ore</b> <b>pellet,</b> this results in decrease in the reducibility of iron <b>ore</b> <b>pellets.</b> The most optimal size range for reducibility to be effective in industrial application is 10 mm to 20 mm...|$|R

In the present project work, the effect of addition of concentrated sugarcane juice binder on the physical properties of fired iron <b>ore</b> <b>pellets</b> was investigated. The crushing strength and drop number were found to be maximum at 2 % binder addition, followed by a decrease with further increase in binder concentration.

40|$|In general terms, {{sintering}} {{describes the}} bonding of particles {{into a more}} coherent structure, where joins form between packed particles, usually {{as a result of}} heating. Characterization of sintering is an important topic in the fields of metallurgy, steel, iron <b>ore</b> <b>pellets,</b> ceramics, and snow for understanding material properties and material strength. Characterization using image analysis has been applied in a number of these fields but is either semi-automatic, requiring human interaction in the analysis, or based on statistical sampling and stereology to characterize the sample. This paper presents a novel fully automatic image analysis algorithm to analyze and determine the degree of sintering based on analysis of the particle joins and structure. Quantitative image analysis of the sintering degree is demonstrated for samples of iron <b>ore</b> <b>pellets</b> but could be readily applied to other packed particle materials. Microscope images of polished cross-sections of iron <b>ore</b> <b>pellets</b> have been imaged in their entirety and automated analysis of hundreds of images has been performed. Joins between particles have been identified based on morphological image processing and features have been calculated based on the geometric properties and curvature of these joins. The features have been analyzed and determined to hold discriminative power by displaying properties consistent with sintering theory and results from traditional pellet diameter measurements on the heated samples, and a statistical evaluation using the Welch t-test.

40|$|Numerical {{simulation}} of the compaction of granular materials {{is an area}} of active research. One approach is to use deformable discrete elements of the individual particles using a 2 D finite element (FE) mesh, see e. g. [1] and [2]. In this work, the axial compression of iron <b>ore</b> <b>pellets</b> inside a steel cylinder is studied and the individual particles are discretized with a coarse FE mesh in 3 D. One possibility of this model is to study the stresses and strains inside the granular particles. Experiment and {{simulation of}} iron <b>ore</b> <b>pellets</b> in a confined compression test are done. The experiment consists of an upper and lower piston of thick circular steel plates surrounded by a 2 mm steel cylinder containing the iron <b>ore</b> <b>pellets.</b> The total mass of the iron <b>ore</b> <b>pellets</b> is 46. 0 kg. During a test, an axial load is applied on the lower piston to a certain level and then unloaded. Measured data are the force and displacement of the lower piston. In addition, strain gauges are measuring the circumferential strain {{in the middle of the}} steel membrane. Experimental compression tests between two plates of 18 randomly chosen iron <b>ore</b> <b>pellets</b> were done in order to characterize the load displacement behaviour of the individual pellets. FE models of the experimental tested pellets were carried out and simulated. Each pellet was discretized with an eight-node FE mesh. An elasto-plastic material model with linear hardening is used. The Young’s modulus, the plastic hardening modulus, and the yield stress of the material model were found by inverse modelling. Different material parameters were tested systematically in the FE model and compared with the experimental results until the same load displacement curve was obtained. A multi particle finite element model (MPFEM) was used to simulate the confined compression test. The iron <b>ore</b> <b>pellets</b> are represented in a quarter-model of the real experimental setup by 4756 discretized particles (7 - 16 mm) with a normal distribution measured from size distribution in the experiment. The contacts are modelled with the penalty stiffness method. The pistons are considered rigid in the simulation and the steel cylinder is modelled with thin elastic shell elements. The compression is simulated in two steps. In the first step, the iron <b>ore</b> <b>pellets</b> models are randomly sparse placed the cylinder and a gravity driven simulation is carried out where the pellets are arranged in the cylinder. In the second step, the compression is simulated by a prescribed displacement of the upper piston. Compared data from the experiment and simulation are; fill density, force-displacement curve and circumferential strain. A relation between the global stress state from the loading of the piston and the maximum stresses inside the individual iron <b>ore</b> <b>pellets</b> was carried out from the simulation.

The present project work has been undertaken to study reduction and swelling characteristics of hematite iron <b>ore</b> <b>pellets</b> made from iron ore fines under different conditions. The physical properties of fired iron <b>ore</b> <b>pellets</b> were studied. The compressive strength and drop number of fired pellets increased with the increase of firing temperature due to the enhancement in the extent of sintering and consolidation of iron ore fines. The main objectives of the present work have been to study the effects of (i) Firing temperature (ii) Reduction temperature and time (iii) Addition of concentrated sugarcane juice on the reduction and swelling behaviours of fired iron <b>ore</b> <b>pellets.</b> The results indicated a decrease in the extent of reduction with increase of firing temperature. The reduction rate of fired iron pellets were found to increase with rise of reduction temperature from (800 °C- 950 °C). The degree of reduction of fired pellet increased with increase of reduction time, the rate being faster in the initial 20 - 30 minutes followed by a decrease thereafter. Reduction at a temperature of 850 °C, in general, gave lowest degree of swelling in the reduced pellets. The highest degree of swelling at a reduction temperature of 850 °C appears to be due to fibrous growth of iron in the reduced pellets. Slightly lower values swelling in the fired iron <b>ore</b> <b>pellets</b> reduced at 900 °C and 950 °C appear to be due to sintering of iron particles in the pellets, as indicated by their SEM micrographs.
