Du Yu (222–285) a Chinese Jin Dynasty officer, believed that the land of hills would eventually be leveled into valleys and valleys would gradually rise to form hills. The Daoist alchemist Ge Hong (284–364) wrote of the legendary immortal Magu; in a written dialogue by Ge, Ma Gu described how what was once the Eastern Sea (i.e. East China Sea) had transformed into solid land where mulberry trees grew, and would one day be filled with mountains and dry, dusty lands. The later Persian Muslim scholar Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī (973–1048) hypothesized that India was once covered by the Indian Ocean while observing rock formations at the mouths of rivers.|$|E

500|$|Typically (see Fig.1, the {{well-known}} Michelson configuration) a single incoming beam of coherent light will be {{split into two}} identical beams by a beam splitter (a partially reflecting mirror). [...] Each of these beams travels a different route, called a path, and they are recombined before arriving at a detector. The path difference, {{the difference in the}} distance traveled by each beam, creates a phase difference between them. It is this introduced phase difference that creates the interference pattern between the initially identical waves. If a single beam has been split along two paths, then the phase difference is diagnostic of anything that changes the phase along the paths. This could be a <b>physical</b> <b>change</b> in the path length itself or a change in the refractive index along the path.|$|E

METHODS: 810 immigrants of three language sub-groups were recruited by purposive-sampling. Using self-reports, respondents answered questions regarding <b>Physical</b> Activity <b>Change</b> and Demography in Multicultural Lifestyle Change Questionnaire of English, French or Chinese version. Data were analyzed statistically in percentage, correlation, regression and factor analysis. RESULTS: Immigrants of different gender, language and category sub-groups exhibited different rates in <b>Physical</b> Activity <b>Change,</b> and different language sub-groups displayed different Physical Exercise Items rates after immigration, but no statistical difference between the rates. <b>Physical</b> Activity <b>Change</b> (<b>Physical</b> Activity Behavior <b>Change</b> + <b>Physical</b> Activity Belief <b>Change)</b> was negatively correlated with Gender, Category of Immigration, Employment Status and Primary Occupation. <b>Physical</b> Activity Behavior <b>Change</b> was negatively correlated with Age, Gender, Category of Immigration, Employment Status and Primary Occupation. Age, Gender, Category of Immigration and Employment Status significantly impacted <b>Physical</b> Activity <b>Change.</b> Mother Tongue, Age, Gender, Category of Immigration and Employment Status significantly impacted <b>Physical</b> Activity Behavior <b>Change.</b> Two factors (factor one: <b>physical</b> activity behavior <b>change</b> factor and factor two: <b>physical</b> activity belief <b>change</b> factor) influenced significantly <b>Physical</b> Activity <b>Change.</b> Factor one exposed more significant effect than factor two. CONCLUSIONS: Different immigrant sub-groups experienced different <b>Physical</b> Activity <b>Change</b> and three language sub-groups presented different physical activity patterns after immigration.
