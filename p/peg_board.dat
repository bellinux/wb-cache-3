40|$|We {{consider}} the one-person game of peg solitaire {{played on a}} computer. Two popular board shapes are the 33 -hole cross-shaped board, and the 15 -hole triangular board—we use them as examples throughout. The basic game begins from a full <b>board</b> with one <b>peg</b> missing and finishes at a board position with one peg. First, we discuss ways to solve the basic game on a computer. Then we {{consider the}} problem of quickly distinguishing boards positions that {{can be reduced to}} one <b>peg</b> (“winning” <b>board</b> positions) from those that cannot be solved to one <b>peg</b> (“losing” <b>board</b> positions). This enables a computer to alert the player if a jump under consideration leads to a dead end. On the 15 -hole triangular board, it is possible to identify all winning board positions (from any single vacancy start) by storing a key set of 437 board positions. For the “central game” on the 33 -hole cross-shaped board, we can identify all winning board positions by storing 839, 536 board positions...|$|R
5000|$|A {{replica of}} the {{original}} Nonsuch was commissioned by the HBC to celebrate their tercentenary in 1970. She was crafted using tools and materials familiar to the seventeenth century. She was crafted to be {{as close as possible}} to the original and featured many of the features ships of the time would have had such as [...] "hiding cabins" [...] (small bunks hidden within a cupboard). The vessel has <b>peg</b> <b>board</b> used for tracking position and speed, a charlie noble (a chimney with a mobile head). Like the original she was armed; the replica carries six 2-pounder muzzle-loading smoothbore guns. As with most ships of the era she was very ornate carrying many carvings that took months to complete. When completed, Nonsuch replica was placed on the MV Halifax City, owned by Charles Hills of Bristol, and carried to Canada. There Nonsuch sailed down the Atlantic coast of Canada and the United States. She also sailed through the Great Lakes and then was placed on a semi-trailer and taken to Seattle for a voyage down the Pacific coast. She was presented by the HBC to the citizens of Manitoba and placed on permanent display in 1973 in the Nonsuch Gallery at the Manitoba Museum in Winnipeg, Manitoba (then called the Manitoba Museum of Man and Nature). Built specifically for the ship, it is a 90-foot gallery giving the feel of a seventeenth-century scene to visitors and shows the ship at the English port of Deptford, just before embarking on her journey to Hudson Bay.|$|E
5000|$|The {{second part}} of the final {{challenge}} begins with the remaining four teams that made it to the super yacht swimming their way to [...] "Nightmare Island," [...] where each team has to retrieve a golden elephant by earning an idol at five separate checkpoints. At the first checkpoint, each team must remove 14 out of 15 spikes (with voodoo doll heads) on a large, triangular <b>peg</b> <b>board,</b> by jumping over each spike only once. After a team completes a checkpoint, that team must signal the completion of their checkpoint by pulling the pin on a smoke grenade and dropping it in a bucket. The second checkpoint is [...] "What's Mine Is Yours," [...] in which each team must cut through a chain-link fence with a pair of dykes, then solve a mathematical puzzle involving a Pythagorean theorem {{in order to determine the}} hypotenuse of a triangle. Each team then has to cut one of five colored ropes that corresponds to a correct answer. If a team makes an incorrect answer, all five ropes have to be cut before they are allowed to continue to the next checkpoint. At the third checkpoint [...] "Food Test," [...] each team must eat and drink a variety of disgusting foods and liquids from numbered receptacles, and in numerical order. A key is located at the bottom of the final jar, which will unlock a cabinet containing an idol. At the fourth checkpoint, [...] "Body Issues," [...] each team must move 20 body bags from one side of a course to another. After each body bag has been removed, a sign at the bottom of the pile will instruct each team to dig into the ground and retrieve a treasure chest that will contain the fourth idol. At the fifth and final checkpoint, [...] "Tunnel Vision," [...] each team must dig a tunnel that will lead underneath a cage consisting of bamboo poles, with the final idol located inside the cage. The first team of each gender to retrieve all five idols will then retrieve a golden elephant, then make their way toward a canoe on the shore of a beach, toward a yacht in the middle of the ocean, winning $125,000.|$|E
40|$|Objective. To {{estimate}} {{if there}} is a relationship between the results of tests of neurocognition and performance on a laparoscopic surgery simulator. Methods and Materials. Twenty participants with no prior laparoscopic experience had baseline cognitive tests administered (Trail Making Test, Part A and B (TMT-A and TMT-B), Grooved <b>Peg</b> <b>Board</b> Test, Symbol Digit Modalities Test, Symbol Digit Recall Test, and Stroop Interference Test), completed a demographic questionnaire, and then performed laparoscopy using a simulator. We correlated the results of cognitive tests with laparoscopic surgical performance. Results. One cognitive test sensitive to frontal lobe function, TMT-A, significantly correlated with laparoscopic surgical performance on the simulator (correlation coefficient of 0. 534 with P <. 05). However, the correlation between performance and other cognitive tests (TMT-B, Grooved <b>Peg</b> <b>Board</b> Test, Symbol Digit Modalities Test, Symbol Digit Recall Test, and Stroop Interference Test) was not statistically significant. Conclusion. Laparoscopic performance may be related to measures of frontal lobe function. Neurocognitive tests may predict motor skills abilities and performance on laparoscopic simulator...|$|E

There is no evidence that "soft" pegs confer any monetary discipline.
