5|$|Descartes {{argued that}} God's {{existence}} can be deduced from his nature, just as geometric ideas can be deduced {{from the nature}} of shapes—he used the deduction of the sizes of angles in a triangle as an example. He suggested {{that the concept of}} God is that of a supremely perfect being, holding all perfections. He seems to have assumed that existence is a predicate of a <b>perfection.</b> Thus, if the notion of God did not include existence, it would not be supremely perfect, as it would be lacking a <b>perfection.</b> Consequently, the notion of a supremely perfect God who does not exist, Descartes argues, is unintelligible. Therefore, according to his nature, God must exist.|$|E
5|$|Existence is a single, {{objective}} and simple reality, {{and there is}} no difference between its parts, unless in terms of <b>perfection</b> and imperfection, strength, and weakness… And the culmination of its <b>perfection,</b> where there is nothing more perfect, is its independence from any other thing. Nothing more perfect should be conceivable, as every imperfect thing belongs to another thing and needs to become perfect. And, as it has already been explicated, <b>perfection</b> is prior to imperfection, actuality to potency, and existence to non-existence. Also, it has been explained that the <b>perfection</b> of a thing is the thing itself, and not a thing in addition to it. Thus, either existence is independent of others or it is in need of others. The former is the Necessary, which is pure existence. Nothing is more perfect than Him. And in Him {{there is no room for}} non-existence or imperfection. The latter is other than Him, and is regarded as His acts and effects, and for other than Him there is no subsistence, unless through Him. For there is no imperfection in the reality of existence, and imperfection is added to existence only because of the quality of being caused, as it is impossible for an effect to be identical with its cause in terms of existence.|$|E

5|$|The {{symmetry}} {{on earth}} mirrors the symmetric <b>perfection</b> of heaven. The purpose {{of art at}} this time—in architecture, the visual arts, and music—was not to create something entirely new, but to reflect this divine <b>perfection,</b> {{and in this way}} to praise God. We find such a symmetric outline in many pieces by Johann Sebastian Bach,19 but only in a few cases is this outline as consequent as in the B Minor Mass. The parts Kyrie, Gloria and Credo are all designed with choral sections as the outer movements, framing an intimate center of theological significance.|$|E
5|$|A {{commission}} {{to create a}} portal for Paris' planned Museum of Decorative Arts was awarded to Rodin in 1880. Although the museum was never built, Rodin worked throughout his life on The Gates of Hell, a monumental sculptural group depicting scenes from Dante's Inferno in high relief. Often lacking a clear conception of his major works, Rodin compensated with hard work and a striving for <b>perfection.</b>|$|E

5|$|By the 11th century, the I Ching {{was being}} {{read as a}} work of {{intricate}} philosophy, as a jumping-off point for examining great metaphysical questions and ethical issues.

5|$|Orthogenesis was the {{hypothesis}} that life has an innate tendency to change, in a unilinear fashion, towards ever-greater <b>perfection.</b> It had a significant following in the 19th century, and its proponents included the Russian biologist Leo S. Berg and the American paleontologist Henry Fairfield Osborn. Orthogenesis was popular among some paleontologists, who believed that the fossil record showed a gradual and constant unidirectional change.|$|E

Early Dutch breeders told buyers they were the offspring of chickens and rabbits, while sideshows promoted them as having actual mammalian fur.|$|E
