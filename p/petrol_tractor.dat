5000|$|When the Fordson <b>petrol</b> <b>tractor</b> became widely {{available}} in the 1920s Hudsons adapted this unit to make a simple locomotive. The locomotive used a four-wheeled cast chassis to which a roller chain drive connected to the tractor axle. The tractor gearbox had three forward speeds but only one reverse gear, which clearly was a limitation for a locomotive that has to operate bi-directionally. Only {{a few of these}} machines were constructed but fortunately a [...] gauge, 1928 model is preserved at the Armley Mills Industrial Museum, Leeds. The oldest working Hudson Hunslet engine '1944', (built in 1939) has just been restored, complete with her original Ailsa Craig 20 hp engine, and is preserved at the Old Kiln Light Railway, Tilford, Surrey.|$|E
50|$|A small {{section of}} 2 ft gauge railway also ran around {{part of the}} site. This was {{operated}} by two Simplex <b>petrol</b> <b>tractors</b> and one small steam locomotive. Additionally, a short section of standard gauge track ran parallel to the Midland Line and ran underneath the line to access an area of land used for tipping.|$|R
50|$|All {{three of}} these Barlow locos still exist on the railway, their Fordson <b>tractor</b> <b>petrol</b> engines having been {{replaced}} by more modern economical diesels.|$|R
50|$|The {{steam engine}} was {{gradually}} phased {{out by the}} mid-1920s as the less expensive, lighter, and faster-starting internal combustion (kerosene, <b>petrol</b> or distillate) <b>tractors</b> fully emerged after World War I.|$|R
5000|$|However, at {{some point}} before Tank Engine Thomas Again was published, this was changed to the more formal name.Despite the size of Terence's face, his face did not have {{animated}} eyes, until The Great Discovery.Although not specifically defined {{by any of the}} Awdrys, Martin Clutterbuck has identified Terence's most likely prototype as a Caterpillar Model Seventy [...] - the largest, and last, design of <b>petrol</b> (gasoline)-powered <b>tractors</b> in Caterpillar's range [...] - [...] of about 1934-vintage.|$|R
50|$|Kates Bridge is a {{landmark}} settlement on the A15 road, {{in the parish}} of Thurlby. It is approximately 3 mi south from Bourne, Lincolnshire, England. Today, Kates Bridge consists of little more than three bridges, a <b>petrol</b> filling station, <b>tractor</b> dealership, five houses, and a farm.|$|R
50|$|In {{practice}} TVO {{had most}} of the properties of paraffin, including the need for heating to encourage vapourisation. As a result, the exhaust and inlet manifolds were adapted so that more heat from the former warmed the latter. Such a setup was called a vaporiser. To get the tractor to start from cold, a small second fuel tank was added that contained <b>petrol.</b> The <b>tractor</b> was started on the expensive petrol, then - once the engine was warm - the fuel supply switched over to TVO or paraffin. So long as the engine was working hard, as when ploughing or pulling a load, the TVO would burn well. Under light conditions, such as travelling unloaded on the highway, the engine was better on petrol.|$|R
