After the campaign Ruckelshaus helped Daniels secure an internship in the office of then-Indianapolis mayor Richard Lugar. Daniels worked on Lugar's re-election campaign in 1971, and later, in 1974, he worked on Lugar's first campaign for Senate via L. Keith Bulen's Campaign Communicators, Inc, a political consultancy where Daniels served as vice president. Daniels joined Lugar's mayoral staff in December, 1974. Within three years, he became Lugar's <b>principal</b> <b>assistant.</b> After Lugar was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1976, Daniels followed him to Washington, D.C. as his Chief of Staff.|$|E
5|$|In the New York store, Greene met Major Sylvanus Thayer, {{superintendent}} of the United States Military Academy, who recommended him to the Secretary of War for appointment to the academy. Greene entered West Point at age 18 and graduated second of 35 cadets {{in the class of}} 1823. Classmates of Greene's included future Union Adjutant General Lorenzo Thomas, Joseph K. Mansfield, David Hunter, Dennis Hart Mahan, and Albert Sidney Johnston. Top graduates of the academy generally chose the Engineers as their branch, but Greene decided on the artillery and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the 3rd U.S. Artillery Regiment. However, due to his excellent academic performance, he stayed at the academy until 1827 as an assistant professor of mathematics and as a <b>principal</b> <b>assistant</b> professor of engineering. One of the students he taught during this period was Cadet Robert E. Lee.|$|E

25|$|The {{iron ore}} at Bjørnevatn was {{originally}} discovered by {{assistant director of}} the Norwegian Geological Survey, Tellef Dahll, in 1868. It was at the time not commercially viable to mine. With the development of magnetic separation, merchant Christian Anker from Halden started acquiring deeds for the area. In 1903 he contacted the government and started negotiating an agreement to start operations. After several rounds of proposals he received permission and the contract was signed on 9 March 1905. Anker's <b>principal</b> <b>assistant,</b> Engineer Henrik Lund, arrived at Kirkenes in 1903 and started designing the plant. He was assisted by Hans Johan Bernhard Hansen from 1905.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the extent secondary <b>assistant</b> <b>principals</b> in large Texas high schools demonstrate behaviors consistent with what the literature describes as instructional leadership. Three hundred seventy <b>principals</b> and <b>assistant</b> <b>principals</b> of large Texas high schools participated in this study. The Principal Instructional Management Rating Scale (Hallinger, 1987) was used to quantify instructional leadership in 10 different job functions. The study found that (a) <b>assistant</b> <b>principals</b> perceive themselves as exhibiting instructional leadership behaviors at a high frequency, (b) <b>principals</b> perceive their <b>assistant</b> <b>principals</b> exhibiting instructional leadership behaviors at a high frequency, (c) the perceptions of the <b>principals</b> and <b>assistant</b> <b>principals</b> were similar, and (d) <b>principals</b> and <b>assistant</b> <b>principals</b> reported more engagement in instructional leadership responsibilities and felt more pressured over the last five years under the new accountability and rating requirements of No Child Left Behind and the state assessments.

500|$|The La Pérouse's {{expedition}} {{was last}} seen on 10 March 1788 as it left Botany Bay in New Holland, Australia. It had been observed by ships of the First Fleet of convicts from England {{under the command of}} Arthur Phillip who was just leaving for Port Jackson after deciding that Botany Bay was unsuitable for settlement. In 1791 France’s National Assembly decided to send out a search mission led by Bruni d’Entrecasteaux. With Thouin’s recommendation Delahaye, who was at this time <b>principal</b> <b>assistant</b> gardener at the botany school of the Jardin du Roi, was invited to join the expedition's team of [...] "savants" [...] (more than ten scientists, engineers and artists) as the expedition's gardener. Thouin described Delahaye as “ ... strong, vigorous and well-suited for voyages. Gentle, honest and of an exact probity. Active, hard-working and passionately loving his calling. Knowing by theory and by practice the processes of gardening and knowing very well the plants cultivated in the Jardin du Roi.” Delahaye's annual salary on the expedition, paid by the navy, was 1000 livres (24 livres were equivalent to the gold coin, the Louis d'or), and he was reimbursed 1,236 livres for equipment. As a lowly gardener he was not permitted accommodation with the savants or to dine with the officers. Throughout the expedition he worked with diligence and honesty, keeping meticulous horticultural notes in his journal. Thouin wanted Delahaye to improve his schooling on the expedition and recommended that Delahaye study Latin, try to translate the works of Linnaeus and to read and write in French. His reading included Pierre Bulliard’s Dictionairre Elementaire de Botanique (1783) and the works of Henri-Louis Duhamel du Monceau (1700–1782) who published works on forestry, naval architecture (especially relating to timber), agriculture, fruit tree cultivation, seed conservation and insect pests affecting seeds. Delahaye arrived in Brest, ready for the ship's departure, with four cases of garden seeds, one of fruit tree nuts, one containing gardening tools and another gardener’s clothing.|$|E

40|$|K- 12 cyber {{charter schools}} emerged 15 {{years ago as}} a public school option {{available}} for students and their families. The rapid growth of charter schools has encouraged innovation and adaptability and facilitated the emergence of new models of schooling; among these are cyber charter schools (Huerta, d 2 ̆ 7 Entremont, 2 ̆ 6 Gonzalez, 2006, p. 23). The challenge is no longer whether students and families have an option of school choice, but whether the quality of teaching and learning these schools of choice have to offer will redefine how public school is done. K- 12 cyber charter schools have the potential to be innovative and to redefine how schooling is approached, but simply providing students with computers and the Internet is no longer considered innovation, nor is having online classes; the quality of teaching, learning, and leadership matters. Ensuring quality teaching and learning is often the responsibility of the <b>principal</b> and the <b>assistant</b> <b>principal</b> as the instructional leaders. Now that instruction takes place remotely in a school without walls, {{what does this mean for}} instructional leadership? This mixed-methods study proposes to explore principals 2 ̆ 7 and <b>assistant</b> <b>principals</b> 2 ̆ 7 enactment in their roles as instructional leaders in a Pennsylvania K- 12 cyber charter school. ^ The research questions are: * How do <b>principals</b> and <b>assistant</b> <b>principals</b> enact instructional leadership in a K- 12 cyber charter school? 1. How are <b>principals</b> and <b>assistant</b> <b>principals</b> perceived to enact instructional leadership from the perception and belief of the CEO? 2. How do <b>principals</b> and <b>assistant</b> <b>principals</b> experience and describe their roles as instructional leaders in a K- 12 cyber charter school? 3. How are <b>principals</b> and <b>assistant</b> <b>principals</b> perceived to enact instructional leadership from the perceptions and beliefs of the teachers? 4. How do the Chief Executive Officer 2 ̆ 7 s and the teachers 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of and beliefs about the <b>principal</b> and <b>assistant</b> <b>principal</b> as instructional leaders compare to the principals 2 ̆ 7 experiences and descriptions of their enactment as instructional leaders?^ Participants consist of K- 12 cyber charter school <b>principals,</b> <b>assistant</b> <b>principals,</b> a Chief Executive Officer, and teachers. Qualitative analysis was conducted on data collected from interviews, open-ended survey questions, focus groups, school artifacts, end-of-the-day reflections, and discussion boards. Quantitative analysis was conducted on the teacher surveys. The findings suggest that <b>principals</b> and <b>assistant</b> <b>principals</b> as instructional leaders share both similarities and differences with their colleagues in a brick-and-mortar building as well as instructional leadership practices to improve student achievement. The implications for K- 12 cyber charter schools interested in instructional leadership in a K- 12 cyber charter school include having an instructional vision of quality instruction for both synchronous and asynchronous instruction and knowing that the virtual context will impact how <b>principals</b> and <b>assistant</b> <b>principals</b> lead. ...|$|R
