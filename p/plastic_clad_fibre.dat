40|$|Corrosion {{monitoring}} is {{an important}} aspect of increasing the safety and reliability of large structures such as aircraft, ships, submarines and bridges. In general, current non-destructive corrosion detection techniques are only able to detect local changes after significant damage has occurred. Moreover, corrosion often localises in areas that are inaccessible for inspection, especially in large structures. This implies a need for sensitive detection systems with multiple sensors in order to monitor the initial stages of corrosion over large areas. Thus, the development of a wide-area detection system for continuously monitoring structural changes, together with a capability for non-destructive evaluation and early warning, {{is an important}} task. The aim of the present research is to evaluate the feasibility of a distributed optical fibre sensor for detecting corrosion at arbitrary points of interest in a large structure. A detection method based on the estimation of water ingress into conventional optical fibre during the corrosion process was tested. This method was based on changes in the water peak absorption in a sensor made from conventional optical fibre. This did not give conclusive results. This method may be attractive for sensor designs based on hygroscopic glasses or fibres with small cladding thickness. In the method chosen for further development, the fluorescence from the complex Tris-(8 -hydroxyquinoline) aluminum (Alq 3) produced by the reaction of Al 3 + ions with the indicator 8 -HQ was detected. A theoretical model was developed to evaluate the evanescent field interaction mechanism and critical parameters of the detection system. This suggested that fluorescent emissions generated by the evanescent field and coupled back into guided modes could be detected by means of photon counting technology. Moreover, the location of the fluorescence could be resolved by measuring the time-offlight of the fluorescent emission returned from a short excitation pulse. Two constructions of the optical fibre sensor, based on etched D-shaped fibre and declad plastic-clad fibre, were examined as sensing elements for distributed measurements. Evaluation of the results in terms of practical considerations such as cost, additional development requirements and the risks to achieving the required results, led to the choice of a <b>plastic</b> <b>clad</b> <b>fibre</b> that could be easily declad as a sensing element for the detection system. A system based on pulsed excitation and time-gated photon counting was used to detect a localized source of fluorescence at an arbitrary position along the fibre length. Environments examined were the complex Alq 3 excited at 405 nm and the infrared dye IR- 125, excited at 780 nm. A model to characterize the response of the sensor to a Gaussian input pulse was developed and tested. Analysis of the Alq 3 fluorescence response confirmed the validity of the model and enabled the fluorescence lifetime to be determined. The decay rate was found to be proportional to concentration, which is indicative of collisional deactivation. The intrinsic lifetime obtained (18. 2 +/- 0. 9 ns) is in good agreement with published data. The minimum Alq 3 concentration that could be detected is 5 x 10 ^- 5 M (~ 20 ppm) over an exposed length of 0. 2 m, whereas the detection limit for IR- 125 is 2 x 10 ^- 6 M (~ 1. 2 ppm). The model allows the spatial resolution of the distributed sensing system to be improved in those cases where the fluorophore lifetime is longer than the resolution of the sensing system. The absorbance and fluorescence response of the multimode optical fibre evanescent wave sensor was analysed to investigate the influence of different conditions, such as environmental refractive index, excitation wavelength, and launching conditions. Theoretical models were developed to investigate and improve the efficiency of the optical fibre detection system. The potential for using the developed detection system in practical sensing applications was successfully demonstrated in a stimulated corrosion test...|$|E

In this thesis we investigate improving the laser {{performance of a}} thulium doped fluoride fibre (specifically ZBLAN) to generate laser output with wavelengths near 2 μm. Two approaches are demonstrated to investigate laser performance at 2 μm. One is 790 nm pumping in which the cross-relaxation mechanism is used for efficient operation by populating the upper laser level. Another is in-band pumping, where 1570 nm light is directly pumps the emitting laser level, reducing the quantum defect between the pump and lasing wavelengths, reducing the threshold and increasing {{the efficiency of the}} fibre laser. Tm:ZBLAN fibres fabricated in-house, we also characterized with the aim of processing towards the development of new classes of fibre laser. A Tm:ZBLAN double <b>clad</b> <b>fibre</b> laser operating at 1. 96 μm is demonstrated with a 1. 53 W maximum output power and slope efficiency of 45 % with respect to the launch pump power. Thereafter, the laser performance is analysed using cavity mirrors of various reflectivities. A laser with an operating wavelength of 1. 57 μm is demonstrated with 1 watt output power using an Er:Yb co-doped double <b>clad</b> <b>fibre.</b> The slope efficiency of this laser is measured to be 28. 3 % with respect to the diode pump power, with a measured beam quality (M²) of 1. 3. This 1. 57 μm in-band pump source is then used to pump the 2 μm Tm:ZBLAN fibre laser. In addition to the laser development, this thesis also analyses the pump absorption for different shaped double <b>clad</b> <b>fibres</b> numerically.

In all cases it is assumed the fibres will be suitable for high power applications. I describe the challenges of fabrication and refinements to existing techniques needed to produce and characterise the diverse fibres. Two jacketed air <b>clad</b> (JAC) <b>fibres</b> with square cores are developed. One is a passive delivery fibre that has capacity to capture a larger beam parameter product than other research and commercial fibres and was designed to deliver the output from a 1800 W diode source. The second jacketed air <b>clad</b> <b>fibre</b> has an inner core doped with Yb ions and a shaped pump core defined by a large NA air cladding. This gave reduced fibre length in an amplifier (compared to a conventional rare earth double <b>clad</b> <b>fibre)</b> providing an advantage {{with respect to the}} onset of non linear spectral broadening. Two all-solid photonic bandgap fibres (S-PBGF) for beam delivery from a fibre laser with a wavelength of 1070 nm and simultaneous rejection of stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) light at a wavelength of 1126 nm are presented. The fibres gave larger MFD near 1 µm with SRS suppression than other published results {{at the time of this}} work. A new type of leakage channel fibre, called the micro-clad leakage channel fibre (micro-clad LCF), is demonstrated for the first time. This fibre type is intended for both beam delivery and in future fibres with an inner core doped with rare earth ions, for beam generation. I present the fabrication and characterisation of an exemplar fibre with mode area of 1440 µm 2. A class of simple antiresonant hollow core fibres are investigated. Various single cladding layer fiber structures are examined. I show that the spacing between core and jacket glass and the shape of the support struts can be used to optimize confinement loss. I demonstrate the detrimental effect on confinement loss of thick nodes at the strut intersections and present a fabricated hexagram fibre that mitigates this effect in both straight and bent condition by presenting radially aligned nodes. This fibre has loss comparable to published results for a first generation, multi-cladding ring, Kagome fibre with negative core curvature and has tolerable bend loss for many practical applications...|$|R
