5|$|After the {{discovery}} of planetary mass companions around PSR B1257+12 in 1990 by Aleksander Wolszczan, data for PSR B1937+21 and other pulsars were analyzed {{for the presence of}} similar companions. By 1994, an upper limit of about one thousandth of the mass of Earth was determined for any companion of PSR B1937+21 within 2 astronomical units. In 1999, Aleksander Wolszczan reported variations in the times of arrival of pulses from PSR B1937+21, as well as previous analysis by Tokio Fukushima which suggested that these timing variations could be caused by a dwarf planet around the pulsar. The data were consistent with a companion having a mass similar to Ceres and located at 2.71 astronomical units from the pulsar, but data {{over a longer period of}} time are required in order to verify the proposed companion. More recent observations have not detected any regular <b>periodic</b> <b>signal</b> associated with this companion, but argue that the slight variations in pulse arrival times are consistent with an asteroid belt having a total mass less than 0.05 that of the Earth, but acknowledge that the detection of periodicity in pulse timing variations associated with individual asteroids is necessary to confirm the possible asteroid belt.|$|E
25|$|From {{a signal}} {{processing}} point of view, the Gibbs phenomenon is the step response of a low-pass filter, and the oscillations are called ringing or ringing artifacts. Truncating the Fourier transform of a signal {{on the real}} line, or the Fourier series of a <b>periodic</b> <b>signal</b> (equivalently, a signal on the circle) corresponds to filtering out the higher frequencies by an ideal (brick-wall) low-pass/high-cut filter. This can be represented as convolution of the original signal with the impulse response of the filter (also known as the kernel), which is the sinc function. Thus the Gibbs phenomenon {{can be seen as}} the result of convolving a Heaviside step function (if periodicity is not required) or a square wave (if periodic) with a sinc function: the oscillations in the sinc function cause the ripples in the output.|$|E
2500|$|A {{phase-locked loop}} or {{phase lock loop}} {{abbreviated}} as PLL is a control system that generates an output signal whose phase {{is related to the}} phase of an input signal.

40|$|The {{recovery}} of <b>periodic</b> <b>signals</b> from their noisy single channel mixtures has made wide {{use of the}} adaptive line enhancer (ALE). The ALE, however, is not designed for detection of two- (2 -D) or three-dimensional (3 -D) <b>periodic</b> <b>signals</b> such as tremor in an unconstrained hand motion. An ALE which can perform restoration of 3 -D <b>periodic</b> <b>signals</b> is therefore required for such purposes. These signals may not exhibit periodicity in a single dimension. To address and solve this problem a quaternion adaptive line enhancer (QALE) is introduced in this paper {{for the first time}} which exploits the quaternion least mean square (QLMS) algorithm for the detection of 3 -D (extendable to 4 -D) <b>periodic</b> <b>signals...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{problem of}} {{modeling}} <b>periodic</b> <b>signals</b> is considered. The approach taken here {{is motivated by}} the well known theoretical results {{on the existence of}} periodic orbits for Li'enard systems and previous results on modeling <b>periodic</b> <b>signals</b> by means of second order nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The approach makes use of the appropriate conditions imposed on the polynomials of a Li'enard system to guarantee the existence of a unique and stable limit cycle.

[...] The discrete-time Fourier transform is a periodic function, often defined in terms of a Fourier series. [...] The Z-transform, another example of application, reduces to a Fourier series for the important case |z|=1. [...] Fourier series are also central to the original proof of the Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem. [...] The study of Fourier series is a branch of Fourier analysis.|$|E
2500|$|Fourier {{transform}} {{mass spectrometry}} (FTMS), {{or more precisely}} Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance MS, measures mass by detecting the image current produced by ions cyclotroning {{in the presence of}} a magnetic field. Instead of measuring the deflection of ions with a detector such as an electron multiplier, the ions are injected into a Penning trap (a static electric/magnetic ion trap) where they effectively form part of a circuit. Detectors at fixed positions in space measure the electrical signal of ions which pass near them over time, producing a <b>periodic</b> <b>signal.</b> Since the frequency of an ion's cycling is determined by its mass-to-charge ratio, this can be deconvoluted by performing a Fourier transform on the signal. FTMS has the advantage of high sensitivity (since each ion is [...] "counted" [...] more than once) and much higher resolution and thus precision.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} new {{approach}} to filtering and reconstruction of <b>periodic</b> <b>signals.</b> The tool that proves to handle these tasks very efficiently is the discrete Zak transform. The discrete Zak transform can be viewed as the discrete Fourier transform performed on the signal blocks.

Combining these two, if we start with a time signal which is both discrete and periodic, we get a frequency spectrum which is both periodic and discrete. This is the usual context for a discrete Fourier transform.|$|E
