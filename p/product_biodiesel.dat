In classical catalytic hydrotreatment applications, there are particular catalysts designed and developed to operate for different feedstock types, i.e., with different characteristics and for different process targets, for example, maximizing diesel yield, maximizing gasoline yield, or for isomerization. As a result, there was significant effort towards assessing commercial catalysts (Bezergianni et al. 2012) that could potentially be utilized for such application. After a series of dedicated experiments, the best hydrotreating catalyst was selected based on its effectiveness in maximizing diesel yield (desired product) while maintaining its quality.

As a consequence, natural resources are diminishing and thereby become a global concern and the cause of rising price. The competition to create an alternative fuel underway as well as to reduce the cost, get high profitability and less pollution to human and environment.

40|$|Abstract only availableThe {{future of}} the {{biodiesel}} industry will rely on several critical issues. The major factors are {{the price of a}} barrel of crude oil versus the price of soybean oil, and the cost of turning both products into usable diesel fuel. While this relationship will be the primary focus of {{whether or not it is}} feasible to produce soybean-based biodiesel, there are many other variables that will affect the underlying economic incentives for this industry to grow. Over time, technology will improve and the cost of production will decrease. Unfortunately, creating the market at a time when the profitability is low is difficult, and this makes advances in technology slow in coming online. Government subsidies, at both the federal and state levels have played a role in jumpstarting the industry, but many wonder whether this funding is being used in the best way possible, and if so, how much should the government be willing to put in to the industry. Unfortunately, in some ways, the government programs on biofuels are working against each other, in the sense that promoting both ethanol and biodiesel causes a struggle over available land for corn and soybeans. This drives land prices higher which increases the cost of production for both crops, and eventually lowers the profit margin on producing either biofuel since the raw product prices continue to rise. In general, all biodiesel plants face the same costs of start-up and production, with regards to construction and soybean oil. The largest expense in production is the feedstock, soybean oil, which makes up nearly ninety percent of the final <b>product,</b> <b>biodiesel.</b> The other approximately ten percent of the biodiesel is a combination of methanol, or other alcohol, and a catalyst. Labor, electricity, maintenance, insurance, etc. make up the remaining costs of production. This leaves plants with few options for lowering their costs relative to other producers. The focus of this paper is to look at these other operating costs, find a range across the industry, and using FAPRI's 2007 U. S. Crops model, determine a best and worst case scenario looking at the future of this industry and how it will be influenced by these other operating costs. This project will help decide whether current government support for the biodiesel industry is sufficient for the sector to remain viable long-term. CAFNR On Campus Research Internshi...|$|E

The obtained results allowed for defining the weight of dehydrogenases in monitoring of the environment subjected to pressure from petroleum hydrocarbons. The studies were carried out under labo-ratory conditions for 180 days, and loamy sand was the soil formation used in the experiment. The petroleum products were used in the following amounts: 0, 2, 4, 8 and 16 g kg− 1 DM of soil. Indices of the influence of the petroleum product and the stimulating substance on the activity of dehydrogenases were calculated. It was proved that the petroleum products affect soil dehydro-genases in various ways. Biodiesel, diesel oil and fuel oil stimulate these enzymes, while petrol acts as an inhibitor. Among the substances tested regarding bio-stimulation of soils contaminated with petroleum prod-ucts, compost is definitely more useful than urea, and therefore, the former should be used for the remediation of such soils. Stimulation of dehydrogenases by com-post, both in contaminated and non-contaminated soils, proves that it may accelerate microbiological degrada-tion of petroleum-derived contaminants.

40|$|Biodiesel is {{produced}} through a chemical process called transesterification, {{which refers to}} a catalysed chemical reaction involving vegetable oil and alcohol to yield fatty acid alkyl esters (biodiesel) and glycerol as a by <b>product.</b> <b>Biodiesel</b> is petroleum substitution in which its quantity continually decreases due to increasing of demand. Plenty of plants {{could be used as}} raw material for biodiesel, for example is avocado (Persea gratissima) seed. This is a waste that being thrown out after the flesh is taken. Therefore, avocado has a higher economic value to be used for consumption. Avocado is not only as an edible commodity but also as feedstock for production of biodiesel. The purposes of this research are producing biodiesel from avocado seed oil (Persea gratissima) so it can be used for alternative fuel, studying the effect of molar ratio avocado seed oil to methanol and reaction temperature to yield the highest methyl ester content, and also studying the effect of washing method and comparing between the conventional method (using water) and dry washing method to reach the highest methyl ester content. Variables that are used in this research are molar ratio of methanol to avocado seed oil, reaction temperature, and washing method. Transesterification process runs for 60 minutes, with NaOH as base catalyst concentration is 1 % by weight. Avocado seed oil contains free fatty acid less than 2 %, so that transesterification process can be carried out with no addition step to convert free fatty acid content become esters. Crude biodiesel which is yielded from transesterification process still contains of impurities, such as traces of glycerine, unreacted methanol, rest of base catalyst, and soap stock. So it needs to be washed out. There are two washing methods, which are water washing and dry washing. The use of dry washing method is expected to be technically feasible with less complexity than the water washing method, thereby making it a competitive alternative to commercial biodiesel production. From this research, it can be concluded that the characteristic of biodiesel from avocado seed oil is acceptable for alternative fuel. The optimum condition is obtained at molar ratio of 1 : 6 (alcohol to oil) and temperature 60 C. Washing method with water is resulting methyl ester content of 82. 7119 %, while for dry washing method resulting methyl ester content of 84. 5678 %.

40|$|Cha, Daniel K. Managing large {{quantities}} of sludge generated from biological wastewater treatment poses both technical and economical challenges {{to the treatment of}} domestic and industrial wastewater. One approach that has been receiving considerable attention for decreasing sludge production is the cell lysis in the wasted sludge and returning the lysates back to aeration tank to promote the cryptic growth. Various cell disruption techniques, which include chemical, physical, mechanical and biological methods, have been successfully applied to achieve greater than 50 % reduction in excess sludge production. However, these techniques have not been successfully adopted in fullscale applications primarily due to additional costs associated with these energy intensive or high chemical-demanding processes. In this study, disintegration of waste sludge by in-situ transesterification was studied as a new lysis technique to promote the cryptic growth. It is hypothesized that disintegration of waste activated sludge (WAS) by in-situ transestrification may be a novel and cost-effective technique to overcome the economic limitations of current lysis methods in the lysis-cryptic growth strategy for sludge reduction. Transestrification disintegrates cell membranes by disrupting phospholipid bilayer structure of bacteria cell membrane. In addition to extracting fatty acids, transestrification simultaneously transforms them to methyl esters, thus allowing the recovery of high-value <b>product</b> (<b>biodiesel)</b> from sludge, which may off-set the additional operation and chemical costs typically associated with lysis-cryptic growth strategy. The objectives of this study were 1) to investigate the recovery of biodiesel and the bioavailability of residual by-products from transesterification of waste activated sludge, 2) to demonstrate and validate the feasibility of transesterification as a viable cell disintegration technique for lysis-cryptic growth strategy using a benchscale sequencing batch reactor (SBR), and 3) to develop the mathematical model for SBR system coupled with the transesterification process. In-situ transesterification was explored as a cost-effective method to solubilize waste activated sludge (WAS) and produce biodiesel. The most critical parameters were heating temperature for protein and H 2 SO 4 concentration for carbohydrate. All reaction parameters except for H 2 SO 4 concentration and water content gave the positive effect on the lipid conversion to biodiesel. Xylene-facilitated transesterification showed the higher production of biodiesel than hexane-facilitated reaction in all transesterification tests. Under the optimum transesterification condition, the soluble material contained 93 mg glucose/g TSS, 302 mg BSA/g TSS, 80 mg biodiesel/g TSS, 60 mg P/g TSS (489. 1 mg P/L) and the degree of COD solubilization was 47. 5 %. The composition of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) in xylene extract was similar with palm oil biodiesel. The physical properties (51. 1 cetane number and 5. 3 °C cold filter plugging point) of WAS biodiesel was comparable with vegetable oils. This study suggested that in-situ transesterification can efficiently solubilize waste sludge and simultaneously produce biodiesel having a satisfactory quality. Comparative study of WAS disintegration showed that solubilization of COD (49. 5 %) by transesterification and its product biodegradability (70 %) was comparable to thermal NaOH hydrolysis (35. 8 % COD solubilization and 40 % biodegradability). A laboratory-scale sequencing batch reactor (SBR) was operated with recycling transesterification-treated WAS back to the aeration basin, and 70 % recycling of solubilized biomass resulted in 48 % reduction of excess sludge generation. Quality of effluent from the test SBR was comparable (52. 1 mg/L of TSS and 43. 1 mg /L of SCOD) to that from the control SBR (40. 5 mg/L and 42. 5 mg/L) during 95 days of operation. This study demonstrated that transesterification can be a feasible technique for reducing excess sludge from activated sludge process while simultaneously producing valuable by-products (i. e. biodiesel). A mathematical model was developed for the activated sludge process coupled with the transesterification process. Biological and chemical reactions occurring in the model system were described by mass balance equations. The model was calibrated with the operation data of the laboratory-scale SBR. The key biokinetic model parameters (Y 0, YLys, YMeOH, b, and XA) for the model were determined from the biological oxygen demand (BOD) tests of solubilized lysate from batch transesterification. The developed model simulated the excess waste activated sludge (WAS) production, treated water quality, and biodiesel production under various operational scenarios. The production of both excess WAS and biodiesel significantly increased at the following operation conditions: < 12 hours hydraulic retention time (HRT), 50 % of return activated sludge (RAS) recycling. Increasing the transesterification efficiency had no significant effect on the yield of biodiesel in the model system. The simulation results of treated water quality was a satisfactory level between 7. 8 and 12. 4 mg COD/L under all scenarios except for poor operating case (19. 2 mg COD/L under 80 % methanol recovery and 70 % RAS recycling). This model may be useful for the design of activated sludge system coupled with transesterification process and the prediction of its system performance.

The reactive distillation column uses the process integration of reaction and separation in a single unit as a means of reacting fatty acids (vegetable oil) and methanol, whilst at the same time separating the <b>products</b> (<b>biodiesel,</b> glycerol, water) for a continuous process. Computer simulations were implemented to model a reactive distillation system for biodiesel production, and further investigation was explored in order to determine methods to optimise and process intensify the system. Parameters and specifications such as energy used, yield produced, temperatures, pressures, reactive distillation column size, reflux ratio, reboiler heat duty, methanol to oil feed ratios, size of reactive zones were investigated and manipulated for the purpose of process intensification. Computer simulation was completed using Honeywell’s UniSim as an optimisation tool. Biodiesel production using supercritical fluids was also analysed through a literature survey. All three methods were critically analysed in order to provide a review of the feasibility and realistic possibility of reactive distillation and supercritical fluid use, being applied industrially and as future biodiesel production techniques...|$|R

40|$|The {{production}} of fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) by direct in situ alkaline-catalyzed transesterification of the triglycerides (TG) in castor seeds will be examined. The Reaction was conducted through in situ trasesterification processes using methanol and in associated with basic catalyst; calcium oxide. The reaction was studied {{to obtain the}} conditions where the <b>product</b> of <b>biodiesel</b> start forming, then obtained the effect of catalyst seed ratio to production rate. 10 g of grinded castor seed was mixed with methanol; 1 : 5 seed methanol mole ratio, and calcium oxide; in different percentage. The mixture was mixed for 4 h under 60 oC. The effects of co-solvent; hexane, to the reaction is investigated as well. The <b>product</b> of <b>biodiesel</b> was quantified using GC, and characterized using GC & MC. Experimental {{results showed that the}} amount of castor oil was converted to biodiesel (FAME) started after mixing 4 h under 60 oC, but it was in low yield compared to the total oil presented in the seed, and the conversion which obtained via in situ transesterification is lower than conversion which obtained via conventional transesterification in the present of the same conditions. In another hand, the present percentage of the catalyst has an effect to the conversion, whereby the conversion increase as the catalyst weight catalyst increase till it reach an equivalent with alcohol then start to decrease. Furthermore, the effects observed for the co-solvent; hexane and petroleum ether, were as purification of the product and had no effects towards product yield or conversion. In conclusion, the yield that obtained of biodiesel production from castor oil via in situ process is lower than that obtained via conventional process...|$|R
30|$|In early research, {{methanol}} was {{the most}} common fuel used in fuel cells because of its high energy density and simple molecular structure. However, the main focus has shifted towards environmentally friendly materials. Methanol is therefore not applicable as a fuel because of its high toxicity [4]. Additionally, as the fuel supplied to the anode, methanol shows the limitations of inefficient oxidation, low open-circuit potential, and crossover from the anode to the cathode [5]. Therefore, to avoid the problems of methanol, glycerol has become a promising candidate for use in fuel cells. The abundance of glycerol, which is a major <b>product</b> of <b>biodiesel,</b> and its high energy density and low toxicity make this alcohol a good alternative for fuel cell applications [6].|$|R
