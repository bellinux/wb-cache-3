50|$|In the 1980s, the {{government}} played a simultaneous {{role as a}} legislator, regulator, and entrepreneur, particularly in the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>utilities</b> and in the exploitation of major natural resources, such as oil and coal. Colombia also used diverse trade-policy tools, such as tariffs and quotas, {{in order to promote}} import substitution, supplemented after 1967 by export promotion and economic diversification. To encourage exports, a competitive exchange rate became a centerpiece of macroeconomic policy, together with several export subsidies, including tax exemptions and subsidized credit. The initial export-promotion strategy did not include import liberalization as one of its components. A prominent feature of the export-promotion strategy was that the Bank of the Republic stood ready to vary the fixed but adjustable exchange rate to compensate for domestic inflation, {{in order to maintain the}} competitiveness of domestic producers. As a result, the exchange rate became indexed to the rate of inflation, and it did not take long for a vicious circle to develop, one in which inflation fed into the exchange rate and vice versa. Consequently, and notwithstanding a tradition of prudent fiscal policies, for a long period Colombia was characterized by a moderate, albeit stable, rate of inflation. Widespread indexation mechanisms, particularly for wages, public utilities, and mortgage-interest rates, blurred most income-redistribution effects generally associated with inflation.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{assesses the}} extent and {{relevance}} of the prevailing debate {{over the use of}} privatization schemes at a local level in Mexico, after decades of highly centralised and rigid political and economic decision-making. The aim is to examine the privatization debate by analysing events following the modifications made to Article 115 of the Mexican constitution in 1983, which marked the inception of a new set of policies regarding the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>utilities</b> at the local level. The theory of privatisation, as promoted by the Mexican Government, was {{for the first time on}} the political agenda, and debate spread rapidly. However, because research into privatisation has hitherto focused largely on economic explanations, this thesis will instead attempt to analyse the politics of the privatisation programme at a local level. Basically, it looks to explain and demonstrate that economic policies are subject to political scrutiny and demands. The process of moving the control of traditionally government services from federal to state and thus to local level seems to be an ongoing trend focused upon encouraging improved governance capabilities and increased social wealth. Far from achieving this, though, it has instead generated great controversy in the political arena concerning the implementation of public policies. Increasing concern regarding the size of governments in the Mexican municipalities, and thus their ability to cope with the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>utilities,</b> has prompted these authorities to pursue their objectives by means of privatisation programmes. Of such programmes, the vast majority have taken the form of concession schemes, and it is one such scheme, concerning water utilities in the city of Aguascalientes, that represents both the most controversial and, consequently, forms our case study...|$|E

The mushrooming urban population obliged local authorities to take on new responsibilities in the crucial fields of gas, electricity and water supply, sewage, waste removal and public transport (cf. von Saldern 1999 : 30 ff.; Püttner 1999 : 541).

40|$|Abstract: The paper {{focuses on}} private <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> <b>utilities</b> {{services}} located {{in poor countries}} with a special attention to capture and corruption issues. It confronts Auriol and Picard (2002) optimal policy regarding private sector involvement in public utilities with empirical evidences on water and electricity in SSA. Consistently with the theory participation of private unregulated firms to the supply of services {{for the middle class}} and the poor is fairly common in SSA. By contrast service to the rich is achieved by public utilities. Theory suggests that prices should be high so that the public firms make a profit. Yet piped water, {{and to a lesser extent}} electricity, are heavily subsidized. This signals a capture problem by the ruling elite. Since the ruling elite also designs and implements privatization programs, there is concern about the optimality of privatization programs. The paper analyzes the social cost of inefficient (corrupted) privatization. It is non-monotone in the opportunity cost of public fund. Because of the fiscal loss it represents, privatizing profit centres of public firms entails huge social costs in very poor countries. There are hence socially good privatizations and socially very bad ones. The good ones are hard to formalize in practice because they are not very lucrative for the private sector. By contrast the bad ones are easier to achieve. This explains that they certainly dominate...|$|E

The introduction of alternative, low-cost technologies represents means of supplying water such as through fog and rain catchment. In the state of Chiapas, in southern Mexico, research is under way on rain water collection for human consumption. This research can then be applied in communities in the states of Chiapas, Oaxaca, Guerrero, Veracruz, Puebla and throughout Baja California. In Chiapas, there are 19, 972 poor rural communities, 15, 712 of which have fewer than 100 inhabitants. The lack of a constant water supply is most severe in the highlands of Chiapas where the population is made up mainly of indigenous groups.

The article gives a strong indication of how communities of Mhondoro Ngezi Rural district can utilise the Indigenisation and Economic Empowerment Act and the Statutory Instrument 21 of 2010 (Community Share Ownership Trust) to empower themselves. The findings of the study indicated that the Indigenisation and Economic Empowerment Act and Statutory Instrument for Community Share Ownership Trust were the pro poor mining policies that ensured the harnessing of mineral resources for the empowerment of local indigenous communities. It was also found out that the Indigenisation and Economic Empowerment Act needed to be harmonised with the Rural District Councilsâ€™ Act, the Mines and Minerals Act, and the Communal Areas Management Act.

40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to provide a}} model {{for dealing with the}} problem of corruption in Nigeria. It uses an analytical approach to explore the Singapore model of dealing with acts of corruption to {{serve as a model for}} Nigeria. Corruption is inimical to socio-economic development of any country where it is practised on any scale. This explains why all nations make efforts to minimize or eradicate corruption in their economies. Nigeria has been ranked among the most corrupt nations of the World by many international anti-corruption agencies. If other nations take measures to eradicate corruption from their economies because of its negative consequences, Nigeria cannot be an exception. Corruption has led to gross misuse <b>of</b> <b>public</b> funds in Nigeria and has caused untold hardship to her citizens via non-payments of people’s benefits and lack <b>of</b> <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> basic <b>public</b> <b>utilities.</b> To deal with corruption in Nigeria, various anti-corruption agencies were set up but the problem remains. This paper therefore recommends the Singapore model as a method of dealing with corruption in Nigeria. This model holds each sectional head responsible for any act of corruption in his/her unit if established. The government was strong and determined to deal with the transgressors; there was political will to tame corruption and therefore there was government support to the anti-corruption agencies. If this model is adopted and faithfully implemented, corruption could be eradicated from Nigeria. In addition, constitutional amendments that would update and clearly define acts that constitute corrupt practices as these acts manifest in various forms are necessary to facilitate interpretatio...|$|R
40|$|Despite strong {{encouragement}} of many international financing and development agencies to stimulate private sector {{involvement in the}} {{water supply and sanitation}} sector, the overwhelming majority of water supply and sanitation services are still provided by public sector organizations in most middle- and low-income countries. In many low and middle-income countries, however, <b>public</b> water <b>utilities</b> are not providing adequate water supply and sanitation services to its consumers. The consequences <b>of</b> poor service <b>provision</b> in terms <b>of</b> health and financial costs to especially the low-income households are enormous. At the same time, the disappointing experiences with private sector involvement in the water supply and sanitation sector have lead to the acknowledgement that the overwhelming majority of people will continue to be serviced by <b>public</b> water <b>utilities</b> for many years to come. In response to the poor performance <b>of</b> many <b>public</b> water <b>utilities,</b> the implementation <b>of</b> New <b>Public</b> Management (NPM) reforms has been promoted heavily by international agencies and sector professionals. The New Public Management, which has its roots in Managerialism and Public Choice theory, originated in New Zealand and the United Kingdom in the early 1980 s. Since then, it {{has become something of a}} generic term to describe a market-oriented and output-based management model with an increased emphasis on user-orientation, most-commonly by ‘business’ style measures. Although the actual effectiveness of NPM reforms for developing countries has been questioned and empirical evidence for the impact <b>of</b> the New <b>Public</b> Management in the water supply and sanitation sector remains rather thin, a considerable number of authors contend that it is proving to have a significant impact on improving service <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> water <b>utilities.</b> The present study examines the potential of reforms associated with the New Public Management and contrasts these reforms with reforms associated with the bureaucratic model <b>of</b> <b>public</b> administration, the so-called Weberian reforms. The main research questions that underlie this thesis are: • Do urban <b>public</b> water <b>utilities</b> in low- and middle-income countries perform better because they adhere to the New Public Management? • Do poorly performing urban <b>public</b> water <b>utilities</b> adhere to the traditional ‘bureaucratic’ model <b>of</b> <b>public</b> management...|$|R
40|$|The {{production}} of China’s new urban spaces {{is an important}} articulation of China’s local state transformation and evolving state-society relations. Previous studies have utilized theories of the entrepreneurial state and corporatism to examine {{the role of the}} Chinese state and China’s state-society relations. The entrepreneurial characteristic and direct involvement in productive and profitable activities of the Chinese state are widely analyzed. And state corporatism helps explain how the Chinese Party-state deals with new social strata, such as private entrepreneurs, through state imposition, sponsorship and co-optation. In both fields, the organizational adaptation of the Communist Party of China (CPC) per se to the changing social stratification structure, industrial structure and urban spatial structure {{plays a key role in}} undertaking entrepreneurial local governance and imposing control over China’s new social spaces. This thesis is based on an in-depth case study of Ningbo’s state-led urban redevelopment from 2000 to 2011, the two representative projects of which are Tianyi Square and the Laowaitan. Ethnographic fieldwork and documentary research were conducted as the major methods of data collection. The two urban redevelopment projects were undertaken by the Ningbo Urban Construction Investment Holdings Co., Ltd. (NBUCI), a local state-owned enterprise group specifically committed to strategic urban development projects and <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> municipal <b>public</b> <b>utilities</b> designated by the Ningbo Municipal Government. The Ningbo government significantly facilitated the two projects through high-profile promotional campaigns in an entrepreneurial manner. These phenomena represent state entrepreneurship of Ningbo’s Party-state agencies in Ningbo’s urban redevelopment. In the governance of Tianyi Square and the Laowaitan, “territorialized Party-building” is undertaken in office buildings and business districts, and within private enterprises and new societal organizations. Organizational adaptation helps the CPC to consolidate its membership basis and expand its organizational control over the economic resources and talents in the non-state sector. The concept of “entrepreneurial Party-state” is thus proposed to highlight the “Party dimension” in China’s entrepreneurial urban governance. And in the context of inter-district competition, territoriality has become central to authoritarian corporatist state-business intermediations and policy concertation, which is committed to forging the identity and promoting the interests of certain urban territories, and the subtle power struggle between the NBUCI on behalf of the Ningbo municipal authority and the district-level authority governing the territory of the Laowaitan area. The concept of “territorial corporatism” is thus proposed to articulate the territorial dimension in China’s changing state-business relations in China’s entrepreneurial urban governance. This research provides new cases of state entrepreneurship, Party-state adaptation and state corporatism taking place in the domain of urban redevelopment and urban governance, which in turn lead to new theorization of the Chinese Party-state and China’s state-society relations at the local level in urban China. The directions for future research on Party-state adaptation and territorial corporatism in relation to urban governance in urban business districts are also identified, which necessitates comparative studies of more cases in different localities in urban China. published_or_final_versionSociologyDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
