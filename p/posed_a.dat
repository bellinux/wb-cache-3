5|$|At the low altitudes {{at which}} Mir orbited {{there is a}} variety of space debris, {{consisting}} of everything from entire spent rocket stages and defunct satellites, to explosion fragments, paint flakes, slag from solid rocket motors, coolant released by RORSAT nuclear powered satellites, small needles, and many other objects. These objects, in addition to natural micrometeoroids, <b>posed</b> <b>a</b> threat to the station as they could puncture pressurised modules and cause damage {{to other parts of}} the station, such as the solar arrays. Micrometeoroids also <b>posed</b> <b>a</b> risk to spacewalking cosmonauts, as such objects could puncture their spacesuits, causing them to depressurise. Meteor showers in particular <b>posed</b> <b>a</b> risk, and, during such storms, the crews slept in their Soyuz ferries to facilitate an emergency evacuation should Mir be damaged.|$|E
5|$|Lili <b>posed</b> <b>a</b> {{threat to}} Bermuda, and a {{hurricane}} warning {{as the storm}} approached, but only gusty winds and light rainfall was reported. As Lili continued westward, it had also <b>posed</b> <b>a</b> significant threat to the East Coast of the United States, since some of the computer models did not predict a northward curve. As a result, several hurricane watches and warnings were issued from Little River Inlet, South Carolina, to Cape Henlopen, Delaware. However, Lili later curved northward, and only caused minor coastal erosion in North Carolina and rainfall in Pennsylvania. Lili began impacting Atlantic Canada as it was transitioning an extratropical cyclone, and the storm reportedly caused strong winds in Nova Scotia and Newfoundland. No damage total or fatalities were reported.|$|E

40|$|Weisberg (2009) {{introduces}} a phenomenon he terms perceptual undermining. He {{argues that it}} <b>poses</b> <b>a</b> problem for Jeffrey conditionalization (Jeffrey 1983), and Bayesian epistemology in general. This is Weisberg’s paradox. Weisberg (2014) argues that perceptual undermining also <b>poses</b> <b>a</b> problem for ranking theory (Spohn 2012) and for Dempster-Shafer theory (Shafer 1976). In this note I argue that perceptual undermining does not <b>pose</b> <b>a</b> problem {{for any of these}} theories: for true conditionalizers Weisberg’s paradox is a false alarm...|$|R

Her distress signal had been picked up by only a single Allied merchant ship, which did not report it until she arrived at Fremantle on 17March.

5|$|However, {{with the}} {{increase}} in paved roads and the increasing size of cities, snow-paving fell out of favour, as the resultant slippery surfaces <b>posed</b> <b>a</b> danger to pedestrians and traffic. The earliest patents for snowplows date back to 1840, but there are no records of their actual use until 1862, when the city of Milwaukee began operating horse-drawn carts fitted with snowplows. The horse-drawn snowplow quickly spread to other cities, especially those in areas prone to heavy snowfall.|$|E

Several watches and warnings were issued for the islands between August26 and 27; however, due to the northward turn, Gustav did not directly impact the region. Only light rain and large swells were reported. Offshore, a ship encountered the storm and sustained hull damage.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, the United States <b>posed</b> <b>a</b> grain embargo upon the Soviet Union. This {{was an attempt}} by the U.S. utilize food power, however, it was not confirmed. The Soviets thus {{imported}} grain from different suppliers, leading to an increase in grain imports during that time period, only at a higher cost. Another unsuccessful embargo food power attempt was imposed by the UN Security Council in 1990 with Iraq.|$|E
5|$|Initially, Ma-on <b>posed</b> <b>a</b> slight {{threat to}} the Mariana Islands and {{prompted}} the issuance of tropical storm warnings. However, the system remained {{far away from the}} area and only produced scattered rainfall. In Japan, hundreds of people evacuated from mudslide-prone areas. Torrential rains produced by the storm, estimated at more than 1,200mm (48in), led to widespread and damaging floods. Five people perished as a result of Ma-on, and damage reached ¥3.9billion (2011JPY, $50million 2011USD).|$|E
