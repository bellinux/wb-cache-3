2500|$|Fred Trueman: Fred Trueman was {{an outspoken}} critic of Australian {{throwing}} actions; [...] "I believed Meckiff's action to be totally illegal and he should never have been allowed to play". Amazingly, Meckiff returned the compliment by describing Trueman as [...] "a Thrower" [...] in a book he wrote several years later. Trueman, whose classic side on bowling action was considered a model, was an unlikely candidate for such an accusation. Like all fast bowlers Trueman dragged his foot over the crease and was no balled for it, but found it annoying that Australian bowlers were not treated the same even though they had both feet over the return crease. Another problem was the long spikes he wore which made everybody talk about [...] "Freddie's big boots <b>ploughing</b> <b>up</b> the wicket for the benefit of Lock".|$|E
60|$|The measure which {{underlies}} {{all else}} is the <b>ploughing</b> <b>up</b> of permanent grass--the reconversion of land {{which was once}} arable, the addition to arable of land which has never been arable, so as to secure the only possible basis of success--the wheat basis.|$|E

6000|$|... "If so be {{we get in}} {{the path}} of one of these messengers," [...] I said, motioning toward a cannon ball which was <b>ploughing</b> <b>up</b> the earth not twenty yards away, [...] "then shall we find that we have been molested for all time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The Quartermaster tells me," [...] said Pathfinder innocently, [...] "that when a man's {{feelings}} {{have been}} harassed {{by so many}} losses, there is no wiser way to soothe them than by <b>ploughing</b> <b>up</b> the soil anew, {{in such a manner}} as to leave no traces of what have gone over it before." ...|$|E
6000|$|It was {{a strange}} weird sight, that busy glowing scene of {{disaster}} out upon the black ocean at midnight; and wonderful--unaccountable--did it appear {{in the eyes of}} the night-watch on board the [...] "Trident," [...] as that ship came over the sea, <b>ploughing</b> <b>up</b> the water before a steady breeze which had sprung up soon after the sun went down.|$|E

60|$|All {{the labour}} employed, however, {{is not of}} this class. For instance, the next man to whom I spoke, who was engaged in <b>ploughing</b> <b>up</b> old cabbage land {{with a pair of}} very useful four-year-olds, bred on the farm, was not a Colonist but an {{agricultural}} hand, paid at the rate of wages usual in the district. Another, who managed the tomato-houses, was a skilled professional tomato-grower from the Channel Islands. The experience of the managers of the Colony is {{that it is necessary to}} employ a certain number of expert agriculturalists on the place, in order that they may train the raw hands who come from London and elsewhere.|$|E
6000|$|The [...] "Ay, ay, sir!" [...] {{of the men}} was uttered with a heartiness {{that showed}} how powerfully this gleam of hope acted on their spirits; but a new damp was cast over them when, on gaining the open passage, they {{discovered}} that the bergs were not at rest, but were bearing down on the floe-ice with slow but awful momentum, and threatened to crush the ship between the two. Just then a low berg came driving up from the southward, dashing the spray over its sides, and with its fore-head <b>ploughing</b> <b>up</b> the smaller ice as if in scorn. A happy thought flashed across the captain's mind. [...] "Down the quarter boat," [...] he cried.|$|E
60|$|It {{was a time}} {{ignorant of}} the {{simplest}} comfort, but debauched with the vices of luxury; in which cities repressed the license of their people by laws regulating the length of women's gowns and the outlays at weddings and funerals. Every wild misdeed and filthy crime was committed, and punished by terrible penalties, or atoned for by fines. A fierce democracy reigned, banishing nobles, razing their palaces, and <b>ploughing</b> <b>up</b> the salt-sown sites; till at last, in the uttermost paroxysm of madness, it delivered itself up to lords to be defended from itself, and was crushed into the abjectest depths of slavery. Literature and architecture flourished, and the sister arts were born amid the struggles of human nature convulsed with every abominable passion.|$|E
5000|$|Pimperne, Dorset [...] "Troy-town" [...] (unique design, roughly triangular, with paths winding {{apparently}} at random; {{described by}} antiquary John Aubrey in 1686; <b>ploughed</b> <b>up</b> 1730) ...|$|R

60|$|For a {{time there}} were {{simultaneously}} two fairly effective Empires in the world capable of holding back the barbarians and even forcing forward the frontiers of the imperial peace. The thrust of the Han empire from north China into Mongolia was strong and continuous. The Chinese population welled up over the barrier of the Great Wall. Behind the imperial frontier guards came the Chinese farmer with horse and plough, <b>ploughing</b> <b>up</b> the grass lands and enclosing the winter pasture. The Hunnish peoples raided and murdered the settlers, but the Chinese punitive expeditions were too much for them. The nomads were faced with the choice of settling down to the plough and becoming Chinese tax-payers or shifting in search of fresh summer pastures. Some took the former course and were absorbed. Some drifted north-eastward and eastward over the mountain passes down into western Turkestan.|$|E
6000|$|And thrive {{and work}} they did, {{clearing}} more land, building their church, <b>ploughing</b> <b>up</b> their farm, drawing to them {{more and more}} heathen converts, more and more heathen school-children; and St. Boniface came to see them from time to time, whenever {{he could get a}} holiday, and spent happy days in prayer and study, with his pupil and friend. And ten years after, when St. Boniface was martyred at last by the Friesland heathens, and died, as he had lived, like an apostle of God, then all the folk of Maintz wanted to bring his corpse home to their town, because he had been Archbishop there. But he 'appeared in a dream to a certain deacon, and said: [...] "Why delay ye to take me home to Fulda, to my rest in the wilderness which God bath prepared for me?"' ...|$|E
6000|$|Muttering to himself--he {{was fond}} of muttering to himself, it felt companionable,--"coorious, very coorious, quite 'stroanary," [...] he crept stealthily {{to the edge of}} the mangroves, and there {{discovered}} that the sands were literally alive with myriads of minute crabs, which were actively engaged--it was supposed by those who ought to know best--in gathering their food. The moment the tide ebbed from any part of the sands, out came these crablets in swarms, and set to work, busy as bees, <b>ploughing</b> <b>up</b> the sand, and sifting it, apparently for food, until the whole flat was rendered rough by their incessant labours. Approaching cautiously, Disco observed that each crab, as he went along sidewise, gathered a round bit of moist sand at his mouth, which was quickly brushed away by one of his claws, and replaced by another, and another, as fast as they could be brushed aside.|$|E
50|$|Earlston Golf Club {{was founded}} in 1906. The Course was closed during the First World War and was <b>ploughed</b> <b>up</b> to plant crops for food in 1917 to aid the war effort.|$|R
5000|$|Staple Station. Fence {{boundary}} to west, 300 m, then rough grass trackbed 500 m before footpath to Staple. This was not <b>ploughed</b> <b>up</b> {{because it}} is {{on the wrong side of}} a farm boundary.|$|R
50|$|Near Trenale was the Iron Age fort of Trenale Bury {{which was}} <b>ploughed</b> <b>up</b> during the Second World War. The first Methodist meeting {{house in the}} parish of Tintagel was {{established}} at Trenale in 1807.|$|R
6000|$|The Indians {{during the}} first summer got to know Wilson, and liked him for his silence, his courage, his generosity; but the older men pondered upon the matter a great deal and watched with grave faces to see him <b>ploughing</b> <b>up</b> the sod for his garden. There was {{something}} strange in this solitary man thus deserting his kindred, coming here to live alone with his cattle; they could not understand it. What they said in those pathetic, dimly lighted lodges will never be known; but when winter came, and the new-comer did not drive his cattle back over the hills as they thought he would, then the old chieftains took long counsel upon it. Night after night they smoked upon it, and at last Drifting Crane said to two of his young men: [...] "Go ask this cattleman why he remains {{in the cold and}} snow with his cattle. Ask him why he does not drive his cattle home." ...|$|E
60|$|All {{our friends}} took their share and fought like {{men in the}} great field. All day long, whilst the women were praying ten miles away, {{the lines of the}} dauntless English {{infantry}} were receiving and repelling the furious charges of the French horsemen. Guns which were heard at Brussels were <b>ploughing</b> <b>up</b> their ranks, and comrades falling, and the resolute survivors closing in. Towards evening, the attack of the French, repeated and resisted so bravely, slackened in its fury. They had other foes besides the British to engage, or were preparing for a final onset. It came at last: the columns of the Imperial Guard marched up the hill of Saint Jean, at length and at once to sweep the English from the height which they had maintained all day, and spite of all: unscared by the thunder of the artillery, which hurled death from the English line--the dark rolling column pressed on and up the hill. It seemed almost to crest the eminence, when it began to wave and falter. Then it stopped, still facing the shot. Then at last the English troops rushed from the post from which no enemy had been able to dislodge them, and the Guard turned and fled.|$|E
6000|$|The house {{stood in}} a park of some two hundred acres, in which the ground was poor, indeed, but beautifully diversified by rising knolls and little ravines, which seemed to make the space almost unlimited. And then the pines which waved in the Newton woods sighed and moaned with a melody which, in the ears of their owner, was equalled by that of no other fir trees in the world. And the broom was yellower at Newton than elsewhere, and more plentiful; and the heather was sweeter;--and wild thyme on the grass more fragrant. So at least Mr. Newton was always ready to swear. And all this he could not leave behind him to his son;--but must die with the knowledge, {{that as soon as}} the breath was out of his body, it would become the {{property}} of a young man whom he hated! He might not cut down the pine woods, nor disturb those venerable single trees which were the glory of his park;--but there were moments in which he thought that he could take a delight in <b>ploughing</b> <b>up</b> the furze, and in stripping the hill-sides of the heather. Why should his estate be so beautiful for one who was nothing to him? Would it not be well that he should sell everything that was saleable in order that his own son might be the richer? ...|$|E
50|$|There are a Bronze Age matted burial mound height 2.5 m in 1.5 km to the West {{from the}} selo; and a Bronze Age <b>ploughed</b> <b>up</b> burial ground of three mounds in 3 km South-West from the selo.|$|R
50|$|A battle axe was <b>ploughed</b> <b>up</b> in 1864 {{on top of}} Montfode Braes (name NS 224 439) {{near the}} remains of several ancient forts. It is of grey stone, with a small boss on either side, and is 4.6 inches long.|$|R
50|$|In 1958 and 1959 {{there was}} almost no new land <b>ploughed</b> <b>up</b> in Virgin Land regions. The 1958 harvest was a {{particularly}} good one, reaching 58,385,000 tons of grain, only 8% below the record of 62,263,000 tons set in 1956.|$|R
6000|$|During {{most part}} of the voyage out to China Mr Hazlit's visage had {{presented}} a sea-green aspect, edged with yellow. The great Demon of the sea had seized upon and held him with unwonted avidity and perseverance. It appeared to regard him as fair game--as one whose life had been largely devoted to <b>ploughing</b> <b>up</b> its peculiar domain--or rather, inducing others to plough there--and who was therefore worthy of special attention. At all events, the wealthy merchant did not appear above-board until the lapse of two weeks after leaving his native land. At {{the end of that}} period something like the ghost of him crawled on deck one rather fine day, but a demoniac squall rudely sent him below, where he remained until those charming regions of the Equatorial calms were entered. Here a bad likeness--a sort of spoiled photograph--of him again made its appearance, and lay down helplessly on a mattress, or smiled with pathetic sarcasm when food was offered. But soon the calm regions were passed; the Cape of Storms was doubled, and the fierce [...] "south-easters" [...] of the Indian seas were encountered, during which period Mr Hazlit passed away, as {{one of the things that}} had been, from the memory of all on board, with the exception of Aileen, the captain, the bed-room steward, and a Christian pastor, who, with his amiable wife, had done much during the voyage for their fellow-passengers.|$|E
60|$|The great corral, {{where the}} animals are kept for {{slaughter}} to supply food to this beef-eating population, {{is one of the}} spectacles best worth seeing. The strength of the horse as compared to that of the bullock is quite astonishing: a man on horseback having thrown his lazo round the horns of a beast, can drag it anywhere he chooses. The animal <b>ploughing</b> <b>up</b> the ground with outstretched legs, in vain efforts to resist the force, generally dashes at full speed to one side; but the horse, immediately turning to receive the shock, stands so firmly that the bullock is almost thrown down, and it is surprising that their necks are not broken. The struggle is not, however, one of fair strength; the horse's girth being matched against the bullock's extended neck. In a similar manner a man can hold the wildest horse, if caught with the lazo, just behind the ears. When the bullock has been dragged to the spot where it is to be slaughtered, the matador with great caution cuts the hamstrings. Then is given the death bellow; a noise more expressive of fierce agony than any I know. I have often distinguished it from a long distance, and have always known that the struggle was then drawing to a close. The whole sight is horrible and revolting: the ground is almost made of bones; and the horses and riders are drenched with gore.|$|E
60|$|Austin {{could not}} quite see how he did it, for his motions were bewilderingly rapid, but he saw {{the wave of the}} gaudy cloak and heard its crisp rustle that was lost in the roar. Then the man was running round the ring for his life, and the bull thundering along with lowered head and a dart bristling in its neck, a yard or two behind him. He had no time to swing himself over the barricade, as hard pressed banderilleros now and then did, for the deadly horns were almost in the small of his back. It was a frantic test of speed, highly trained human agility and {{endurance}} against the strength of the beast, and there was dead silence while they went round the arena once, the man running desperately, with tense, set face, while Austin fancied he could hear his gasping breath through the roar of the hoofs. Then, with a splendid bound, he drew a yard ahead, and another man with a green cape hurled himself through the opening. Somehow he escaped destruction, and the bull slid onward with hoofs <b>ploughing</b> <b>up</b> the sand, and the gaudy silk fluttering about its head. There was a roar of plaudits that could have been heard miles away at sea, and while from tiers of benches the hats came sailing down, the bull, which shook the cape off, tore the coloured rags to fragments.|$|E
60|$|The shot {{following}} was {{the best}} they had yet placed. It struck into a battery on the west shore of the harbor entrance, <b>ploughed</b> <b>up</b> {{the foundation of a}} six-pound gun, and sent the piece flying high into the air.|$|R
25|$|The {{financial}} difficulty {{the ground}} faced {{was so great}} that during New Zealand's involvement in World War I in 1915 the main oval at Lancaster Park was <b>ploughed</b> <b>up</b> and was used as a potato field in an attempt to raise more revenue.|$|R
