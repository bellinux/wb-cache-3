25|$|In 1840, one of {{the mining}} {{companies}} reported that 300,000 bushels of coal were extracted from the -deep <b>Pump</b> <b>Shaft</b> alone, {{one of the}} more active mines, using the labor of approximately 150 men and 25 mules.

25|$|Polymerization {{also has}} been {{consequentially}} linked to catastrophic component failures such as injection <b>pump</b> <b>shaft</b> seizure and breakage, injector tip failure leading to various and/or combustion chamber components damaged. Most metallurgical problems such as corrosion and electrolysis are related to water based contamination or poor choices of plumbing (such as copper or Zinc) which can cause gelling- even with petroleum based fuels.|$|E

25|$|Golden Gate Mining and Town Complex is a heritage-listed mining camp at Normanton Road (Gulf Developmental Road), Croydon, Shire of Croydon, Queensland, Australia. It {{commenced}} in 1886. It is {{also known}} as Golden Gate Township, Croydon Consols <b>Pump</b> <b>Shaft,</b> Golden Gate No.10 North Mine, Golden Gate Cemetery, Croydon Consols Battery and Cyanide Plant, and Golden Gate Mine. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 14 August 2009.|$|E

25|$|The complex {{features}} extensive {{archaeological evidence}} relating {{to a wide}} range of gold mining and processing activities. The place contains the largest surviving assemblage of early boiler and steam engine power plant recorded in North Queensland. The cyanide plant is amongst the earliest and most intact recorded in North Queensland and the tailings bucket chain and stumps and supports for the vats are now rare remains. The site contains a very rare undertype semi-portable steam engine and winching unit and a 4.5m high vertical boiler which is the largest of this type recorded in North Queensland. The <b>pump</b> <b>shaft</b> contains the only surviving beam pump arm recorded in the Georgetown-Croydon district.|$|E
25|$|As well as {{a source}} of galena, the mine near Port Gorey {{returned}} both lead and silver. Discovered by chance during a rabbit hunt in 1836, industry around this mine led to the construction of a small gauge railway and the installation of steam pumps. The mine is believed to have had a length of 2,000 feet/600m and depth of 700 feet/200m. Close to the port there were four shafts leading to the galleries. Sark's Hope shaft was the westernmost, almost {{on the edge of the}} cliff. To the East was Le Pelley shaft, excavated down to 90fathoms below sea level, then the <b>Pump</b> <b>shaft</b> and the easternmost shaft, the Prince's shaft.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first flight}} was in Dayton, Ohio in 1918. The <b>pump</b> <b>shaft</b> {{on the engine}} was broken, but the plane was flown anyway. Although the flight was successful, the test pilot Jimmie Johnson commented that the {{aircraft}} was too dangerous to fly because of the poor visibility. Stout later called the visibility [...] "abominable". The test aircraft was put into storage. Soon afterward, Stout submitted British patent #149,708, with a Batwing aircraft with the corners squared off rather than the oval design of the prototype. The updated aircraft was never produced. Stout went on to focus on more conventional aircraft featuring the advancement of all-metal construction, but maintained that the airplane of the future would look like the batwing.|$|E

50|$|From about 1850 {{reserves}} in Bowling were becoming exhausted and some landholdings were sold off. This process was not straight forward as mining had rendered {{much of the}} surface too unstable for building development. Map 3 shows an area near the Parks which was so unstable it remained undeveloped {{until the very end}} of the 20th century and which still (2014) suffers from periodic shaft collapses. One of the most important land sales occurred in 1849 when Messrs Ripley and Son of the Bowling dye works purchased the freehold of the site, about 100 acres of land surrounding it (later expanded to 130 acres) and the <b>pumping</b> <b>shafts</b> of several former collieries. The <b>pumping</b> <b>shafts</b> provided a constant supply of high quality soft water to the dye works of 1.25million gallons per day with a surplus of about 0.6 million gallons per day which was distributed via Ripley's water works to domestic and other industrial consumers. At that date the Bradford Waterworks company (purchased by the Borough Council in 1854) could only provide a very intermittent supply of about 0.5 million gallons per day. In 1854, the dye works, like the ironworks built its own standard gauge internal private railway with a junction with the GNR near Hall Lane.|$|R
50|$|Mechanical seals; These {{are mostly}} used {{to close the}} inside of a pump from the outside world to prevent leakage. For that purpose, a {{mechanical}} seal is mounted on the <b>pump</b> <b>shaft.</b> As the <b>pump</b> <b>shaft</b> is turning, {{there has to be a}} sealing element consisting of a stationary and a rotating ring. To enforce sufficient pressure on the two rings one is fitted with a spring. This spring can also have the form of a diaphragm (welded) bellows.|$|E

Fluidsenter the pump through an intake screen and are lifted by the pump stages. Other parts include the radial bearings (bushings) distributed along the length of the shaft providing radial support to the <b>pump</b> <b>shaft.</b> An optional thrust bearing takes up part of the axial forces arising in the pump but most of those forces are absorbed by the protectorâ€™s thrust bearing.|$|E

50|$|By {{the end of}} March, a {{fifth of}} the town had been covered by lava flows, and {{increased}} pumping capacity was required. Thirty-two pumps, each with a capacity of up to 1000 litres per second (265 US gallons per second), were brought in from the United States. After these pumps began to cool the flow advancing towards the town, its movement slowed dramatically and soon stopped. Failure of <b>pump</b> <b>shafts</b> became a problem after a few weeks, probably because they were designed for pumping oil rather than water, and new and improved shafts had to be manufactured in ReykjavÃ­k and brought in.|$|R

50|$|In pump design, {{a spacer}} {{coupling}} is a cylindrical piece installed between the <b>pump</b> <b>shaft</b> coupling hub and motor shaft coupling hub.
