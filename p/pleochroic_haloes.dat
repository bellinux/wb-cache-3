40|$|In this {{preliminary}} work, {{the possibility of}} dating crystalline rocks by <b>pleochroic</b> <b>haloes</b> has been studied. Halo-microphotometry has been combined with measurement of the alpha-activity of the inclusions by the photographic method. Standard thin sections of well dated granites {{have been used for}} calibration purposes. The reciprocity law is shown to be valid within the limit of error. The resolving power of this method depends essentially on the age ratio. Tertiary and primary rocks are easily separated. © 1955 Birkhäuser Verlag. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E

40|$|A {{microscopic}} examination of thin sheets of {{certain kinds of}} mica, notably biotite, reveals the presence of small areas containing groups of concentric circles darker in colour than the surrounding mica. Usually a minute particle, more or less transparent, is observed at the centre of each circle. The circular marks are called <b>pleochroic</b> <b>haloes</b> and the particle at the centre is {{commonly referred to as}} the nucleus. Joly and Rutherford (1) were the first to show that the haloes are due to darkening of the mica by alpha particles emitted by radioactive material associated in some way with the nucleus. The first attempt to classify haloes according to their radioactive parent element was made by Joly (2 a). He was able to distinguish between uranium and thorium types but could not account for a few other varieties which he encountered. More recently, however, Henderson (3) has made a systematic study of the haloes in mica from many localities and has been able to account satisfactorily for their origins. At least six distinct types (3 d) have been recognized, each resulting from a different radioactive parent. These are shown diagramatically in Figure 1. From the measured radius of a given halo and a knowledge of the energies of the alpha particles emitted by different radioactive atoms, converted into their range in mica, identification of the halo with a particular radioactive element in the nucleus can be effected.

50|$|A related {{phenomenon}} is {{the formation of}} <b>pleochroic</b> <b>halos</b> surrounding minute zircon inclusions within a crystal of biotite or other mineral. The spherical halos are produced by alpha particle radiation from the included uranium- or thorium-bearing species. Such halos can also found surrounding monazite and other radioactive minerals.|$|R
25|$|Radioactivity {{is a rare}} property; {{minerals}} may {{be composed}} of radioactive elements. They could be a defining constituent, such as uranium in uraninite, autunite, and carnotite, or as trace impurities. In the latter case, the decay of a radioactive element damages the mineral crystal; the result, termed a radioactive <b>halo</b> or <b>pleochroic</b> <b>halo,</b> is observable by various techniques, such as thin-section petrography.|$|R
50|$|Allanite {{contains}} up to 20% {{rare earth}} elements and is a valuable source of them. The inclusion of thorium and other radioactive elements in allanite results in some interesting phenomena. Allanite often has a <b>pleochroic</b> <b>halo</b> of radiation damage in the minerals immediately adjacent. Also highly radioactive grains of allanite often have their structure disrupted or are metamict. The age of allanite grains {{that have not been}} destroyed by radiation can be determined using different techniques.|$|R
5000|$|Radiohalos or <b>pleochroic</b> <b>halos</b> are microscopic, spherical {{shells of}} {{discolouration}} within minerals such as biotite {{that occur in}} granite and other igneous rocks. The shells are zones of radiation damage caused by the inclusion of minute radioactive crystals within the host crystal structure. The inclusions are typically zircon, apatite, or titanite which can accommodate uranium or thorium within their crystal structures [...] One {{explanation is that the}} discolouration is caused by alpha particles emitted by the nuclei; the radius of the concentric shells are proportional to the particle's energy [...] The phenomenon of radiohalos has been known to geologists since {{the early part of the}} 20th century, but wider interest has been prompted by the claims of creationist Robert V. Gentry that radiohalos in biotite are evidence for a young earth [...]|$|R
5000|$|Titanite, {{which is}} named for its {{titanium}} content, occurs as translucent to transparent, reddish brown, gray, yellow, green, or red monoclinic crystals. These crystals are typically sphenoid in habit and are often twinned. Possessing a subadamantine tending to slightly resinous luster, titanite has a hardness of 5.5 and a weak cleavage. Its specific gravity varies between 3.52 and 3.54. Titanite's refractive index is 1.885-1.990 to 1.915-2.050 with a strong birefringence of 0.105 to 0.135 (biaxial positive) under the microscope {{this leads to a}} distinctive high relief which combined with the common yellow-brown colour and lozenge-shape cross-section makes the mineral easy to identify. Transparent specimens are noted for their strong trichroism, the three colours presented being dependent on body colour. Owing to the quenching effect of iron, sphene exhibits no fluorescence under ultraviolet light. Some titanite {{has been found to be}} metamict, in consequence of structural damage due to radioactive decomposition of the often significant thorium content. When viewed in thin section with a petrographic microscope, <b>pleochroic</b> <b>halos</b> can be observed in minerals surrounding a titanite crystal.|$|R
