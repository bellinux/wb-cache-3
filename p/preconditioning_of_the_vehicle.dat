40|$|A Euro 4 Light-Duty Diesel vehicle {{equipped}} with a diesel particulate filter (DPF) was circulated to 9 labs where repetitions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> current regulatory New European Drive Cycle (NEDC) were conducted. Regulated gaseous and improved (with cyclone, filter temperature 47 ± 5 °C, constant filter face velocity, high precision balance at all labs) particulate mass (PM) measurements were also conducted. A reference particle number (PN) measurement system measuring non-volatile particles was circulated along with <b>the</b> test <b>vehicle.</b> Labs also tested their own PN systems built {{to comply with the}} reference system¿s performance specifications. The mean PN emissions level <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> was below 1 x 1011 particles/km. The intra-lab variability (repeatability) was ~ 40 % and the inter-lab variation was ~ 25 %. The study showed that the new PN method has similar variability to other gaseous pollutants such as carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons and better than the PM (intra-lab variability ~ 55 % and inter-lab ~ 35 %). Even with the improved PM method <b>the</b> emissions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> were similar with the background level (~ 0. 4 mg/km) and the method was subject to volatile artifact. The PN method showed greater sensitivity than the PM method as it could distinguish the DPF fill state or different <b>preconditioning</b> states <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vehicle.</b> However, <b>the</b> PN emission level <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> estimated by <b>the</b> reference system were on average 15 % higher than any given lab¿s own system, indicating that the procedures and calibration designed for <b>the</b> standardization <b>of</b> performance should be precisely defined and followed.

40|$|BACKGROUND: We {{assess whether}} remote ischemic <b>preconditioning</b> (rIPC) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{recipient}} can modify ischemia-reperfusion (IR) {{injury in the}} donor heart following orthotopic heart transplantation from brain dead donors and to examine potential mechanisms of protection. METHODS: Sixteen pigs weighing from 26 to 34. 2 (mean 29. 2) kg, randomized to control group (n= 5), ischemic preconditioning (rIPC) group (n= 6), and to receive rIPC with prior glibenclamide administration (Glib + rIPC) group (n= 5) underwent orthotopic heart transplantation with <b>the</b> support <b>of</b> hypothermic (32 degrees C) cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). The hearts were harvested from donor animal rendered brain dead by balloon compression via a craniotomy. <b>Preconditioning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> recipients was induced by four 5 -min cycles of lower limb ischemia. Myocardial infarction (MI) was induced following heart transplantation by 30 min of left anterior descending (LAD) artery occlusion following by 2 hr <b>of</b> regional reperfusion. <b>The</b> extent <b>of</b> myocardial infarction was assessed by triphenyltetrazolium (TTC) staining. RESULTS: <b>Preconditioning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> recipient reduced <b>the</b> mass <b>of</b> MI (6. 75 +/- 6. 3 g in rIPC vs. 18. 1 +/- 5. 8 g in control, P= 0. 01), MI to area at risk (ARR) mass ratio by 57 % (15. 6 %+/- 15. 2 % vs. 36. 3 %+/- 13. 4 %, P= 0. 04). <b>The</b> protective effect <b>of</b> <b>preconditioning</b> was abolished by pretreatment with glibenclamide. CONCLUSIONS: Remote ischemic <b>preconditioning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> recipient, decreases ischemia-reperfusion injury in the brain dead donor heart following orthotopic heart transplantation via a Katp channel-dependent mechanism.
