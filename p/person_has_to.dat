5|$|Kohlberg {{established}} the Moral Judgement Interview in his original 1958 dissertation. During the roughly 45-minute tape recorded semi-structured interview, the interviewer uses moral dilemmas {{to determine which}} stage of moral reasoning a person uses. The dilemmas are fictional short stories that describe situations in which a <b>person</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> make a moral decision. The participant is asked a systemic series of open-ended questions, like what they think the right course of action is, as well as justifications as to why certain actions are right or wrong. The form and structure of these replies are scored and not the content; over a set of multiple moral dilemmas an overall score is derived.|$|E
25|$|The need to {{aggregate}} preferences occurs in many disciplines: in welfare economics, where one {{attempts to find}} an economic outcome which would be acceptable and stable; in decision theory, where a <b>person</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> make a rational choice based on several criteria; and most naturally in electoral systems, which are mechanisms for extracting a decision from a multitude of voters' preferences.|$|E
25|$|Article 9 of Indian Constitution {{says that}} a person who voluntarily acquires {{citizenship}} of any other country is no longer an Indian citizen. Also, according to The Passports Act, a <b>person</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> surrender his/her Indian passport and vote card and other Indian ID cards must not use after other country citizenship. It is a punishable offence if the person fails to surrender the passport.|$|E

2500|$|Guilt offerings ( [...] , asham) were {{required}} {{when a person}} was unwittingly remiss about any sacred thing. In such cases, the <b>person</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> sacrifice a ram and make restitution plus 20 percent to the priest. Similarly, guilt offerings {{were required}} when a person dealt deceitfully {{in the matter of}} a deposit or a pledge, through robbery, by fraud, or by finding something lost and lying about it. In such cases, the <b>person</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> sacrifice a ram and make restitution plus 20 percent to the victim.|$|R
25|$|In such cases, the <b>person</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> confess and {{sacrifice}} a female sheep or goat; {{or if the}} person could not afford a sheep, two turtledoves or two pigeons.|$|R
25|$|In {{order to}} be given refugee status a {{displaced}} <b>person</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> go through a Refugee Status Determination (RSD) process, which is conducted {{by the government of}} the country of asylum or the UNHCR, and based on international, regional or national law. RSD can be done on a case by case basis as well as for whole groups of people. Which of the two processes is used often depends {{on the size of the}} influx of displaced persons.|$|E
25|$|One {{substitute}} for a swift is to have someone else hold the hank. This has several disadvantages however, first a willing second <b>person</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> be found, and secondly unless the other person has {{had a lot of}} practice holding hanks, the yarn winds off a swift much better. Yarn tends to catch on the hands and wristwatches of the person holding the hank, and a swift has neither hand nor watch to catch the yarn.|$|E
25|$|The {{unemployment}} rate {{as reported by}} GUS is defined as percent of those without work out of the economically active population. To be counted as unemployed a <b>person</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> fulfill four criteria: 1) be between 17 and 74 years of age, 2) be out of work, 3) have actively sought unemployment {{in the past four}} weeks, and 4) were ready to take employment within a short period if offered. Additionally, the rate counts as unemployed those who have been hired for a job but have not yet started active work.|$|E

50|$|Access to {{materials}} from Special Storage was conditional on special permission: a <b>person</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> either <b>have</b> the corresponding {{level of security}} access or <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a written permission from the First Department from person's job.|$|R
25|$|It {{follows that}} if one has to choose between {{receiving}} $100 today and $100 in one year, the rational decision is to cash the $100 today. If the money is to be received in one year and assuming the savings account interest rate is 5%, the <b>person</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> be offered at least $105 in one year so that two options are equivalent (either receiving $100 today or receiving $105 in one year). This is because if you have cash of $100 today and deposit in your savings account, you will have $105 in one year.|$|E
25|$|To {{create this}} I–Thou {{relationship}} with God, a <b>person</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> {{be open to}} the idea of such a relationship, but not actively pursue it. The pursuit of such a relation creates qualities associated with It‑ness, and so would prevent an I‑You relation, limiting it to I‑It. Buber claims that if we are open to the I–Thou, God eventually comes to us in response to our welcome. Also, because the God Buber describes is completely devoid of qualities, this I–Thou relationship lasts as long as the individual wills it. When the individual finally returns to the I‑It way of relating, this acts as a barrier to deeper relationship and community.|$|E
25|$|However, as one {{rises above}} sea level {{the density of the}} air {{decreases}} exponentially (see Fig.14), halving approximately with every 5500m rise in altitude. Since the composition of the atmospheric air is almost constant below 80km, {{as a result of the}} continuous mixing effect of the weather, the concentration of oxygen in the air (mmols O2 per liter of ambient air) decreases at the same rate as the fall in air pressure with altitude. Therefore, in order to breathe in the same amount of oxygen per minute, the <b>person</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> inhale a proportionately greater volume of air per minute at altitude than at sea level. This is achieved by breathing deeper and faster (i.e. hyperpnea) than at sea level (see below).|$|E

In {{the late}} 80s, after living {{three years in}} South Korea, he {{relocated}} to Portugal in hopes of finding a new club, but eventual poor choices and several misfortunes ended up with him as a homeless <b>person</b> <b>having</b> <b>to</b> resort to street vending in Lisbon.|$|R

500|$|... "When You Believe" [...] is a {{song from}} the 1998 DreamWorks musical {{animated}} feature The Prince of Egypt. It was written and composed by Stephen Schwartz. A pop single version of [...] "When You Believe", with additional music and lyrics by writer-producer Babyface, was also recorded for the film by American singers Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey for the film's end credits and its soundtrack album. Additionally, the song was featured on Houston's fourth studio album, My Love Is Your Love and Carey's first compilation album, #1's. The original version of the song, featured in the narrative portion of the film, is performed by Sally Dworsky, Michelle Pfeiffer, and a children's choir. [...] "When You Believe" [...] {{is described as a}} big ballad, with meaningful and inspirational lyrics, describing the ability each <b>person</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> achieve miracles when they reach out to God and believe.|$|E

2500|$|The current North American English {{version of}} the MBTI Step I {{includes}} 93 forced-choice questions (there are 88 in the European English version). [...] "Forced-choice" [...] means that a <b>person</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> choose only one of two possible answers to each question. The choices are a mixture of word pairs and short statements. Choices are not literal opposites but chosen to reflect opposite preferences on the same dichotomy. Participants may skip questions if they feel {{they are unable to}} choose.|$|E
2500|$|Each insula was [...] square, {{with the}} land within it divided. As the city developed, each insula would {{eventually}} be filled with buildings of various shapes and sizes and crisscrossed with back roads and alleys. Most insulae {{were given to the}} first settlers of a Roman city, but each <b>person</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> pay to construct his own house.|$|R
50|$|Many ancient peoples {{recognized}} a religious right of asylum, protecting criminals (or those accused of crime) from legal action and from exile to some extent. This principle {{was adopted by}} the early Christian church, and various rules developed for what the <b>person</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do to qualify for protection and just how much protection it was.|$|R

2500|$|Felicity Hampel SC, {{president}} {{of civil liberties}} group Liberty Victoria, replied in response to Hulls, [...] "Neither imprisonment in itself nor parole in itself {{is going to stop}} everybody from committing offences. What's important to bear in mind is that a <b>person</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> be sentenced for the offence they've committed, and that might mean that somebody gets a sentence that is proportionate for the crime, but it doesn't cure them of the dangerousness or the characteristic that makes them continue to offend".|$|E
2500|$|In Syndicat Northcrest v. Amselem, the Supreme Court of Canada {{provided}} a two-pronged test {{to introduce a}} freedom of religion claim: first, a demonstration of practice or a belief having a nexus with religion. Second, the <b>person</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> be sincere in his/her belief. [...] The court also stated that the practice in question {{does not have to}} be mandatory to the religion, or observed by all who practice the religion. [...] What is important is that the practice has a nexus with religion (see para 44 of the judgment).|$|E
2500|$|The koseki {{simultaneously}} {{fills the}} function of birth certificates, death certificates, marriage licenses, and the census in other countries. It is based on family rather than each individual. For married couples, only one family name may appear on the koseki, which means that one <b>person</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> abandon {{his or her family}} name when he or she marries. Usually it is the woman. On December 15, 2015, the Nikkei Asian Review reported that Japan's Supreme Court upheld a legal provision forcing married couples to use the same surname. Plaintiffs had argued that the legal provision amounts to [...] "de facto discrimination against women." ...|$|E

Wilson is trying to suggest is that to be fully human, a <b>person</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> see that life has a heroic dimension... I think for the scientist, and for other people, it's a {{question}} of, [...] "Is the universe valuable? Is it sacred? Is it holy? Or is the human agenda all that matters?" [...] I just don't think we're that stupid to continue {{in a way that}} continues to destroy. I'm hopeful that the Epic of Evolution will be yet another strategy in our culture that will lead our consciousness out of a very tight, human-centered materialism." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Supreme Court has the Chief Justice, a Senior Puisne Judge and {{a number}} of Puisne Judges as {{prescribed}} by the Parliament of Mauritius. As of 2014, there were 17 Puisne judges. The Chief Justice is appointed by the President in consultation with the Prime Minister, the Senior Puisne Judge acting in accordance with the advice of Chief Justice and the Puisne Judges acting in accordance with the advice of the Judicial and Legal service Commission as listed in Section 77 of the Constitution.

He shall be removed from office by the President under the advice of removal [...] referred by the Judicial Committee deputed.|$|E
2500|$|Emperor Taizong {{feared that}} the {{remaining}} Song troops would launch a counter-offensive to reclaim the capital. Therefore, he set up in Bianjing a puppet government for the lands south of the Yellow River, called Chu (楚), and ordered all the assets and prisoners to be taken back to the Jin capital – Shangjing (in present-day Harbin). The captives marched to the Jin capital along with the assets. Over 14,000 people, including the Song imperial family, went on this journey. Their entourage [...] almost all the ministers and generals of the Northern Song dynasty [...] suffered from illness, dehydration and exhaustion, and many never made it. [...] Upon arrival, each person {{had to go through}} a Jurchen ritual where the <b>person</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> be naked and wearing only sheep skins. Empress Zhu committed suicide because she could not bear the humiliation. Men were sold into slavery in exchange for horses with a ratio of ten men for one horse. Women, especially former Song princesses, were kept {{in a part of the}} Jin palace called the laundry hall (浣衣院) as prostitutes or offered for public bidding. Some Song princesses became Jin princes' concubines. Someone bought an [...] "ex–royal" [...] for less than ten ounces of gold.|$|E
50|$|On 5 August 1991, as a {{response}} to public complaints about inflation, the Lithuanian government introduced the talonas, paid out as a supplement to the salaries in rubles. It was a quick and unforeseen reform pushed by the Prime Minister of Lithuania Gediminas Vagnorius. At first, it was very similar to ration coupons: every person received 20% of his/her salary in talonas up to a maximum of 200 talonas. In order to buy goods other than food, a <b>person</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> pay the price in rubles and again in talonas (for example, if a pair of shoes cost 50 rubles, a <b>person</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> pay 50 rubles and 50 talonas to buy them).|$|R
