40|$|An {{investigation}} was undertaken {{to evaluate the}} effectiveness Trichoderma harzianum based bio-fungicides multiplied on different substrates. The substrates was rice bran, wheat bran, grass <b>pea</b> <b>bran</b> and their combinations with mustard oilcake (MOC) were used to mass culture T. harzianum for the management of foot and root rot disease of tomato seedling caused by Fusarium oxysporum in seedbed. All combinations of carrier materials were found effective for preparing T. harzianum based bio-fungicides to promote germination, seedling growth and reducing pre-emergence and post-emergence mortality of tomato seedling under F. oxysporum inoculated seedbed soils. The shoot length, shoot weight, root length and root weight of tomato seedling were enhanced significantly by the application of different substrate materials of T. harzianum based bio-fungicides under F. oxysporum inoculated seedbed conditions. The individual (rice bran, wheat bran, grass <b>pea</b> <b>bran)</b> and combination of substrates (rice bran + wheat bran, rice bran + mustard oilcake, rice bran + wheat bran + MOC and wheat bran + grass <b>pea</b> <b>bran</b> + MOC) were equally suitable for mass culturing of effective T. harzianum bio-fungicides for the management of foot and root rot disease of tomato seedling in seedbed condition...|$|E
40|$|Variability {{in growth}} and {{sporulation}} of five isolates of Arthrobotrys dactyloides was studied on five agar, 6 bran and 5 grain media. Potato dextrose agar (PDA) supported maximum growth of isolate A, C and E, while growth of isolate B and D {{was significantly lower}} on this medium. On Czapek’s agar and yeast glucose agar media the differentiation in the isolates in relation to growth was poor than PDA. The other two media showed much poorer differentiation. On Czapek’s agar medium, sporulation was recorded in isolate B only, whereas other isolates showed rare sporulation. Among the bran media, <b>pea</b> <b>bran</b> agar medium supported maximum growth of all the isolates except isolate B. Gram and rice bran agar media were next best. However, the growth of isolate B on the gram bran agar medium {{was more or less}} equal as other isolates. On pigeon <b>pea</b> <b>bran</b> agar medium, isolate E failed to grow while other isolates recorded poor growth. On lentil bran agar medium, only isolate B and D recorded little growth, whereas other isolates failed to grow. All the isolates recorded good sporulation on bran agar media except pigeon pea and lentil bran agar media. The grain agar media supported moderate to very good growth of all the isolates. In general isolate B remained slow growing on these media except gram grain and sorghum grain agar media on which growth of this isolate was comparable to other isolates. Sporulation in general, was good on all the grain agar media. Among different substrates screened, barley grain and <b>pea</b> <b>bran</b> were found superior to others for mass culture of isolate A of A. dactyloides...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{effect of}} eight Trichoderma based {{substrates}} viz. rice bran, wheat bran, lentil bran, gram bran, black gram bran, mustard oil cake, grass <b>pea</b> <b>bran</b> and saw dust in mixing with peat {{soil and water}} {{were used in the}} formulation, these were evaluated for sporulations of Trichoderma harzianum and acting against Sclerotium rolfsii for the management of damping off of eggplant seedlings with control. The effect of the treatments varied significantly in terms of production of Trichoderma spore and reducing damping off and tip over increasing germination percentage, plant height, seedling vigor and fresh weight of eggplant seedlings in comparison to control. Among the treatments soil application with T 5 (Trichoderma + Black gram bran + Peat soil + Water), T 7 (Trichoderma + Grass <b>Pea</b> <b>bran</b> + Peat soil + Water) and T 4 (Trichoderma + Gram bran + Peat soil + Water) showed the promising effect in controlling pre-emergence damping off, post-emergence damping off, tip over and increasing germination percentage, plant height, vigor index and fresh weight of seedlings. The highest germination percentage (78. 00 %) was observed in treatment T 5 at 16 days after sowing (DAS). The lowest percentage (6. 33 %) post- emergence damping off was observed in T 5 in eggplant seedling at 16 DAS. The lowest pre- emergence damping off and tip over were observed in T 5 in eggplant (2. 33 % and 1. 33 %) ...|$|E

Chinkiang Vinegar, which originated {{in the city of}} Zhenjiang (Chinese: 镇江香醋; pinyin: Zhènjiāng xiāngcù) in the eastern coastal province of Jiangsu, is considered the best of the black rice vinegars. Normally black rice vinegar is made with black glutinous rice (also called [...] "sweet rice"), although millet or sorghum may be used instead. It is dark in colour, and has a deep, almost smoky flavour. In addition to Zhenjiang, it is also produced in Hong Kong.

Most of traditional methods for the removal and recovery of heavy metals ions from industrial wastewater are extremely expensive or inefficient, especially for {{a large amount of}} solution at relatively low concentrations. The aim of present study was testing of dietary fiber (DF) isolated from pea beans and wheat <b>bran.</b> <b>Pea</b> beans dietary fiber (PDF) and wheat bran dietary fiber (BDF) was treated as low-cost sorbent of heavy metal ions and basic dyes in different media in order to estimate the opportunity of this sorbent practical use.

40|$|Acrylic {{bone cement}} setting {{as the result}} of {{exothermic}} reaction of polymerization is accompanied by high temperature growth. This temperature shock may cause living tissue necrosis with subsequent implant loosening. Bioactivity lack of bone cements on the base of poly(methylmethacrylate) – methylmethacrylate also may be the reason of implant loosening. Developed bone cements on the base of poly(methylmethacrylate- 2 -ethylhexylmetharylate) – ethylmethacrylate-triethyleneglycol dimethacrylate as well as carboxylic groups containing cement on that base are the cements with less expressed temperature increase during polymerization. Isolated from pea beans and wheat bran dietary fibre was used as additive which was introduced into bone cement solid phase. The introduction of 20 % of additive influenced bone cements setting parameters: peak temperature decreased and setting time increased. The mechanical properties of formed cements were determined from four- point bending tests and uniaxial compression. Pea beans dietary fibre introduction did not worsen mechanical properties of bone cements, whereas enhancement was noticed in some results. The introduction of the same amount of wheat bran dietary fibre caused the decrease of ultimate stress of both bone cements in bending and in compression. This additive introduction caused the decrease of apparent density of carboxylic groups containing cement what might compensate polymerizing mixture shrinkage. The changes probably were caused by difference in morphology of isolated <b>pea</b> beans and <b>bran</b> dietary fibre what was established by scanning electron microscopy. The data show that bone cement modification with <b>pea</b> beans and <b>bran</b> dietary fibre is promising for bioactivity rise of non ionogenic bone cement and bioactivity increase of carboxylic groups containing cement. Bran dietary fibre additive introduction might be proper only in small amount (3 - 9 % in solid phase), also to diminish bone cement shrinkage...|$|R
5000|$|Wholegrain {{products}} {{can be identified}} by the ingredients list. [...] "Wheat flour" [...] (as opposed to [...] "wholegrain wheat flour" [...] or [...] "whole-wheat flour") as the first ingredient is not a clear indicator of the product's wholegrain content.

[...] Many breads are colored brown (often with molasses or caramel color) and {{made to look like}} wholegrain when they are not. In addition, some food manufacturers make foods with wholegrain ingredients, but, because wholegrain ingredients are not the dominant ingredient, they are not wholegrain products.

30|$|Dietary fibre {{has been}} {{recommended}} on an empirical {{basis for the}} management of chronic constipation. As is known, dietary fibres can promote the excretion of intestinal mucin by stimulating the capacity of mucosal protein synthesis (Derrien et al. 2010). Dietary fibre is broken down in the proximal colon and provides an energy yielding substrate for microbial fermentation. The result of this is to stimulate the growth of intestinal microbiota and contribute significantly to the stool dry weight. Besides, fibres could promote the excretion of bacterial fermentation products, such as SCFAs, which has the pro-motility effects (Jennings et al. 2009). Dietary fibre is also an important source of gas in the colon. Hydrogen, methane and carbon dioxide, which are principal end products of bacterial fermentation, can increase stool bulk and promote colonic transit (Lopez Roman et al. 2008). There is evidence indicates that dietary fibres (wheat <b>bran,</b> <b>pea</b> fibres) can modulate intestinal microbiota, including the stimulation of beneficial bacterial species and the suppression of pathogenic bacterial species (Chen et al. 2013).|$|R
40|$|AimsZ:To {{characterize}} fibre degradation, colonization and fermentation, and xylanase {{activity of}} two xylanolytic bacteria Bacteroides xylanisolvens XB 1 AT and Roseburia intestinalis XB 6 B 4 {{from the human}} colon. Methods and Results:The bacteria grew well on all the substrates chosen to represent dietary fibres: wheat and corn <b>bran,</b> <b>pea,</b> cabbage and leek fibres, and also on purified xylans. Roseburia intestinalis colonized the substrates more efficiently than Bact. xylanisolvens. For the two bacteria, 80 - 99 % of the total xylanase activity {{was associated with the}} cells whatever the substrate and time of growth. Optimal specific activities of cells were obtained on oat spelt xylan; they were higher than those previously measured for xylanolytic bacteria from the human gut. Roseburia intestinalis produced high molecular mass xylanases (100 - 70 kDa), while Bact. xylanisolvens produced lower molecular mass enzymes, including a cell-associated xylanase of 37 kDa. Conclusions:The two bacteria display very high xylanolytic activity on the different substrates. Differences were observed on substrate attachment and enzyme systems, suggesting that the two species occupy different niches within the gut microbiota. Significance and Impact of the Study:This study characterizes xylan degradation by two major species of the human intestine...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Aspergillus terreus NCFT 4269. 10 was imple-mented in {{solid-state}} (SSF) {{and liquid}} static surface fer-mentation (LSSF) for biosynthesis of pectinase. Amongst various substrates, like, mustard oil cake, neem oil cake, groundnut oil cake, black gram peels, green gram peels, chickling vetch peels/grass <b>pea</b> peels wheat <b>bran,</b> pearl millet residues, finger millet waste, broken rice, banana peels (BP), apple pomace (AP) and orange peels, banana peel (Musa paradisiaca L.; Family: Musaceae) was {{most suitable for}} pectinase biosynthesis (LSSF: 400 ± 21. 45 Uml- 1; SSF: 6500 ± 1116. 21 Ug- 1). Opti-mization of process parameters using one-variable-at-a-time method revealed that an initial medium pH of 5. 0 at 30 C and 96 h of incubation along with mannitol, urea, ammo-nium persulfate and isoleucine have positive influence on pectinase production. Further, K? (1 mM), Riboflavin (10 mg 100 ml- 1) and gibberellic acid (0. 025 %, w/v) supported in enhanced pectinase production. Banana peels and AP {{at a ratio of}} 9 : 1, moisture content of 90 % with 2 % inoculum size were suitable combinations for production of pectinase. Similarly, 96 h of soaking time with 0. 1 M phosphate buffer (pH 6. 5) is essential for pectinase recovery. Purification to electrophoretic homogeneity revealed 1. 42 fold purification with 8. 08 % yield and a molecular weight of 24. 6 kDa. Scaling up of various fermentation parameters and supplementing BP as the substrate for pectinase pro-duction with better recovery could make it promising for different industrial exploitation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the influence of solid state fermentation (SSF) and submerged fermentation (SmF) with bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances (BLIS) producing lactic acid bacteria (LAB) (Pediococcus acidilactici, Lactobacillus sakei and Pediococcus pentosaceus) on the content of alkylresorcinols (ARs) and lignans in plant products (barley <b>bran,</b> <b>pea</b> fiber, and lupine seeds). Lignans analysis was performed by HPLC-MS/MS, and alkylresorcinols content was evaluated by GC/MS. We found that with the experimentally tested LAB, under SSF conditions more organic acids were produced and in most cases a higher count of the LAB was found in SSF samples, compared to the SmF samples. The matairesinol content was increased by using fermentation (from 7. 9 to 35. 4 % in pea fiber, from 33. 2 to 81. 5 % in lupine seeds, and from 5. 9 to 74. 9 % in barley bran), and in most cases a higher content of matairesinol was found in the SSF samples. The content of secoisolariciresinol in the fermented samples was found to be higher, in comparison to the untreated samples. It was found that the total lignans content in the pea fiber had a strong correlation with the amylase activity (R= 0. 7908; P= 0. 0177). Our results suggested that the total ARs content in pea fiber, lupine seeds, and barley bran was 267 μg/g; 1757 μg/g, and 1488 μg/g, respectively, and by using the LAB fermentation, the ARs content was reduced by 40 to 73 %, by 10 to 77 %, and by 24 to 74 %, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Aim: This work {{intended}} to evaluate accuracy of niacin quantification in food matrices, by an RP-HPLC method, {{in order to}} validate it for four different food groups: legumes, grains, dairy products and fish. Material and methods: Analytical methodology The analytical method was a RP-HPLC with fluorometric detection, based on EN 15652 : 2009. Samples (1 to 10 g) were submitted to an acid hydrolysis with 0. 1 mol/l HCl for 30 min in an autoclave at 121 ºC. After filtration, 50 µl of the solutions, were injected and separated at 37 ºC on a HPLC system. The stationary phase was the Fortis C 18 5 µm (150 x 4, 6 mm) column and the mobile phase consisted of 0. 07 mol/l phosphate buffer, 0. 075 mol/l hydrogen peroxide and 5 x 10 - 6 mol/l copper sulphate, at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Excitation and emission wavelengths were 322 nm and 380 nm, respectively. Quantification was made with five external standards. Results were expressed in mg/ 100 g. Accuracy evaluation To evaluate precision, at least one matrix of each food group was chosen: roasted peanuts, canned green <b>peas,</b> wheat <b>bran,</b> powder milk and canned tuna. Method trueness was assessed by testing five different reference materials from FAPAS and NIST. Each of the FAPAS samples 2160, 2166, 2172, 2176 (Breakfast Cereals) were tested once {{over a period of}} 14 months and, NIST 1849 (Infant/Adult Formula) was tested twice in the same period. In the precision study, the five matrices were tested in triplicate in four different days. Repeatability and intermediate precision standard deviations (Sr and SPi) were calculated, for each matrix, trough ANOVA (p < 0. 05). Repeatability and Intermediate precision limits; r and Pi were calculated using the following formulas: r= 2. 8 *S_r and Pi= 2. 8 *S_Pi. Trueness was evaluated from the z-scores obtained. Results: The values of niacin concentration obtained were: peanuts – 13. 4 mg/ 100 g, green peas – 0. 59 mg/ 100 g, wheat bran – 18. 2 mg/ 100 g, powder milk – 0. 73 mg/ 100 g and tuna – 9. 5 mg/ 100 g. The Sr and SPi (mg/ 100 g) were respectively 0. 52 / 1. 25 (peanuts), 0. 02 / 0. 05 (green peas), 0. 23 / 0. 78 (wheat bran), 0. 02 / 0. 06 (powder milk) and 0. 24 / 0. 60 (tuna). The r and Pi values obtained ranged from 0. 05 to 1. 46 for r and 0. 14 to 3. 50 for Pi. All the │z-scores│ obtained for FAPAS samples were < 1 and, the │z-scores│ obtained for NIST reference material were both < 2. Conclusion: The repeatability data obtained in this study, for niacin in different food matrices were in accordance with the ones presented in the method standard EN 15652 : 2009. Trueness evaluation using breakfast cereals and formulas revealed a good method/laboratory performance. Accuracy evaluation, using representative matrices and niacin contents, showed the method suitable to its purpose and fit to be submitted to accreditation by an external entity...|$|R
