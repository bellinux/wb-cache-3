25|$|Although asado is eaten {{all over}} the country, its origin may {{be traced back to}} the Pampas. It entails {{manifold}} types of meat, which are generally eaten as follows: achuras (offal, or the cow's inner parts), morcilla (blood sausage), and sometimes also a provoleta (a piece of <b>provolone</b> <b>cheese</b> cooked on the grill with oregano) are eaten first. Then comes the choripán (a kind of spiced sausage made with pork or lamb and placed between two slices of bread), and lastly meat such as asado de tira, vacío (flank steak), lomo (tenderloin), colita de cuadril (rump), matambre (rolled stuffed steak cut into slices and served cold), entraña (innards); the list is never-ending. It is quite common to eat and enjoy a dish known as cabrito al asador (roast kid or goat) in the province of Córdoba.|$|E
2500|$|Several {{foods and}} dishes {{are unique to}} Rhode Island and some {{are hard to find}} outside of the state. Hot wieners are {{sometimes}} called gaggers, weinies, or New York System wieners, and they are smaller than a standard hot dog, served covered in a meat sauce, chopped onions, mustard, and celery salt. Famous to Rhode Island is Snail Salad, which is served at numerous restaurants throughout the state. The dish is normally prepared [...] "family style" [...] with over five pounds of snails mixed in with other ingredients commonly found in seafood dishes. Grinders are submarine sandwiches, with a popular version being the Italian grinder, which is made with cold cuts (usually ham, prosciutto, capicola, salami, and <b>Provolone</b> <b>cheese).</b> Linguiça or chouriço (a spicy Portuguese sausage) and peppers is also popular among the state's large Portuguese community, eaten with hearty bread (though this is also popular in other areas of New England).|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, <b>Provolone</b> <b>Cheeses</b> were radialized by 60 Co-γ of {{different}} doses, {{and they were}} stored. The impact of texture in the cheese after radialization was studied, the peculiar smell resulted from radialization were analyzed, the mechanisms and preventing methods were discussed. Main conclusions are as follows: Volatile flavors of <b>Provolone</b> <b>cheeses</b> {{of different}} radialization doses were detected by HS-SPME-GC-MS. The result showed that the variety and quantity of volatile flavors were changed obviously after radicalization: esters and phenols were reduced numerously; while aldehydes, ketones, aromatic hydrocarbons and alkyl olefin had increased significantly; Irradiation cause sulfur compounds such as sulfur alcohols and sulfur ketone...|$|R
5|$|An {{example of}} a {{processed}} pizza cheese is Provel, which uses Cheddar, Swiss, and <b>Provolone</b> <b>cheeses</b> as flavorants. Some analogue types are made with casein, a by-product of milk, and vegetable oil, rather than milk fat. Casein-based Mozzarella-like imitation processed cheeses prepared using rennet are also used as a Mozzarella substitute on frozen pizzas.|$|R
50|$|The {{best known}} {{processed}} cheese in the United States is marketed as American cheese by Kraft Foods, Borden, and other companies. It is orange, yellow, or off-white; mild, with a medium consistency; and melts easily. It is typically {{made from a}} blend of cheeses, most often Colby and cheddar. Another type of processed cheese created in the United States is Provel pasteurized processed pizza cheese, which uses cheddar, Swiss, and <b>provolone</b> <b>cheeses</b> as flavorants. Provel cheese is commonly used in St. Louis-style pizza. A third variety of processed pizza cheeses are mozzarella-like imitation processed cheeses, which are sometimes used in frozen pizzas.|$|R

50|$|St. Louis-style pizza often, but not always, {{includes}} a white processed cheese known as Provel. Provel is a trademark for three cheeses fused to form one (provolone, Swiss, and white Cheddar), {{used instead of}} (or, rarely, in addition to) the mozzarella or provolone common to other styles of pizza. Provel cheese {{was developed by the}} St. Louis firm Costa Grocery in the 1950s and is made in Wisconsin primarily for the St. Louis market. The cheese is not widely available outside the St. Louis area but can be made by combining Swiss, sharp cheddar and smoked <b>provolone</b> <b>cheeses.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Provel [...] {{is a white}} {{processed}} cheese particularly popular in St. Louis cuisine, that {{is a combination of}} cheddar, Swiss, and <b>provolone</b> <b>cheeses,</b> and tastes nothing like any of them. Provel has a low melting point, and therefore has a gooey and almost buttery texture at room temperature. It is the traditional topping for St. Louis-style pizza. It is also often used in the preparation of cheese soup and served on salads, chicken, and the Gerber sandwich. Some restaurants use Provel for their pasta dishes with white sauce instead of the customary fresh Italian cheese and cream.|$|R
40|$|Newly {{produced}} <b>Provolone</b> <b>cheeses</b> {{are traditionally}} coated with melted wax to prevent development of undesirable microorganisms. To establish whether wax could {{be replaced by}} other materials so as to simplify processing and reduce costs, a copolymer dispersion (Plasticoat) and a heat-shrinkable film (Cryovac) were used {{in place of the}} control wax. Effects on cheese ripening coeff. (ratio of water-soluble to total N), dynanometric properties (Texture Profile Analysis, penetration, recovery), consistency and moisture content were determined during 150 days of ripening. The Cryovac coating gave results comparable to those obtained with the wax coating, but the relatively high permeability of the Plasticoat facilitated moisture loss, thereby negatively influencing cheese proteolytic processes and rheological characteristics...|$|R

40|$|Lactobacillus helveticus is a homofermentative {{thermophilic}} {{lactic acid}} bacterium used extensively for manufacturing Swiss type and aged Italian cheese. In this study, the phenotypic and genotypic diversity of strains isolated from different natural dairy starter cultures used for Grana Padano, Parmigiano Reggiano, and <b>Provolone</b> <b>cheeses</b> was investigated by a classification tree technique. A data set was used that consists of 119 L. helveticus strains, each of which was studied for its physiological characters, as well as surface protein profiles and hybridization with a species-specific DNA probe. The methodology employed in this work allowed the strains to be grouped into terminal nodes without difficult and subjective interpretation. In particular, good discrimination was obtained between L. helveticus strains isolated, respectively, from Grana Padano and from Provolone natural whey starter cultures. The method used in this work allowed identification of the main characteristics that permit discrimination of biotypes. In order to understand what kind of genes could code for phenotypes of technological relevance, evidence that specific DNA sequences are present only in particular biotypes may be of great interest...|$|R
50|$|Antonio and {{his brother}} Giuseppe Mastellone founded Hermanos Mastellone in General Rodríguez, a pampas city west of Buenos Aires, in 1927. The company became a leading area {{provider}} for a rapidly growing market in mozzarella, <b>provolone</b> and ricotta <b>cheeses</b> for Argentina's large Italian community (of the 6 million Europeans who arrived in Argentina, over half were Italians).|$|R
40|$|To {{determine}} whether the development of surface mould on <b>Provolone</b> Valpadana <b>cheese</b> could be controlled by technological methods instead of normal environmentally unfriendly fumigation and chemical treatments, 2 series of tests were conducted. In the 1 st, cheeses were subjected to direct UV irradiation, and in the 2 nd the drying area was sanitized by UV rays. UV irradiation of the drying area proved as effective as fumigation; direct irradiation of the cheeses was as effective as chemical treatment, but proved difficult to effect uniformly, {{primarily because of the}} cord used to bind the sausage-shaped cheeses. Use of plastics coating (Plasticoat) in place of traditional paraffin wax led to a reduction in the cheeses' moisture content and affected the ripening process...|$|R
50|$|The Gerber is an {{open faced}} {{sandwich}} made in St. Louis, Missouri. The Gerber consists of a half section of Italian or French bread, spread with garlic butter and topped with ham, and Provel or <b>Provolone</b> <b>cheese,</b> seasoned with a sprinkling of paprika and then toasted.|$|E
50|$|The slow cooking of {{the onions}} is {{especially}} important for the sauce's flavor, and is facilitated by incremental additions of white wine, stock, or both. The sauce and accompanying pasta can be served with the meat from the sauce or separately, garnished with tomatoes, and topped with Parmesan or <b>provolone</b> <b>cheese.</b>|$|E
50|$|Variations exist, {{in which}} {{different}} cheeses and ingredients may be added. Some versions may also use oregano, olives and capers as ingredients, and some may omit {{the use of}} pizza sauce and substitute half of the mozzarella with <b>Provolone</b> <b>cheese</b> that is sliced or grated. Some versions may use pecorino cheese.|$|E

Additional ingredients, such as pepperoni, banana pepper, lettuce and mustard, may be added, and the sandwich is often cut in half {{to make it easier}} to handle. The flavors and texture of the sandwich are unified by the ingredients used to create a gastronomic equilibrium, with the fats and acids in the ingredients serving to counterbalance one another.|$|R
5000|$|Allentown {{is known}} for a {{slightly}} altered version of the Philly cheesesteak. The chipped beef, cheese, and roll are similar, but it is usually topped with a special [...] "steak sandwich sauce", which will be some form of tomato sauce, especially ketchup. It is often typical of Allentown cheesesteaks to feature American, <b>provolone</b> or mozzarella <b>cheese</b> instead of Cheeze Wiz, which is common in Philadelphia. Along with the sauce, onions come standard, and pickles and hot peppers are often added upon request. Zandy's Steak Shop, The Brass Rail, Stahely's and many others in Allentown {{have this kind of}} steak sandwich.|$|R

50|$|A steak bomb {{is a hot}} grinder {{sandwich}} {{consisting of}} shaved steak and melted <b>provolone</b> or mozzarella <b>cheese</b> with grilled onions, sautéed red and green bell peppers, mushrooms, and peppered shaved steak all on a grinder sandwich roll. It is {{a variation on the}} steak submarine sandwich, as is the cheese steak. It is most closely associated with the New England region of the United States, where steak sandwiches are made by quickly grilling shaved steak on a griddle and then adding either cheese, or grilling the steak together with peppers and onions or mushrooms. If all three are combined together it becomes a steak bomb. The addition of salami or other preserved meats or pickles is optional and exact recipes and proportions vary widely. Nearly every pizzeria and sub shop in New England has their own version of the various steak sandwiches and the steak bomb.|$|R
40|$|Lactic acid {{bacteria}} {{occurring in}} Provolone del Monaco, an artisanal pasta filata cheese produced in Campania (Italy) from raw cows’ milk and without starter addition, were investigated {{by a combination}} of conventional and molecular approaches. The microbial community was monitored during a cheese-making process giving rise to a premium quality product. Streptococcus thermophilus and Streptococcus macedonicus prevailed during cheese manufacture and survived along nine months of ripening, together with enterococci and lactobacilli of the casei group, especially Lactobacillus rhamnosus. Phenotypic and genetic identification of 308 isolates largely reflected the results obtained by 16 S rDNA sequencing analysis by polymerase chain reaction-denaturant gradient gel electrophoresis, with the significant exception of Lactobacillus fermentum and four Lactobacillus delbrueckii subspecies that were not detected by cultural methods. Each different analytical approach employed provided useful information.
