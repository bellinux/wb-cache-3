50|$|A {{threaded}} pipe has a screw thread at {{one or both}} ends for assembly. Steel pipe is often joined with threaded connections; tapered threads are cut into {{the end of the}} <b>pipe,</b> <b>sealant</b> is applied in the form of thread-sealing compound or thread seal tape (also known as PTFE or Teflon tape) and the pipe is threaded into a threaded fitting with a pipe wrench.|$|E
50|$|In 2015, Chemence Graphics {{created a}} {{proprietary}} plate for Smurfit Kappa Group, and expanded platemaking facilities to France and Germany. Also in 2015, {{the company began}} manufacturing Krylex, its own formulation based on RITE-LOK, which was purchased by 3M. In 2016, DVGW (Deutsche Vereinigung des Gas und Wasserfaches) accredited Chemence Ltd. for its anaerobic gas <b>pipe</b> <b>sealant</b> Krylex KS775. The DVGW accreditation approved the use of Chemence product Krylex KS775 for municipalities providing gas and water services across Europe.|$|E
50|$|The {{threaded}} pipes {{used in some}} plumbing installations for {{the delivery}} of fluids under pressure have a threaded section that is slightly conical. Examples are the NPT and BSP series. The seal provided by a threaded pipe joint is created when a tapered externally threaded end is tightened into an end with internal threads. Normally a good seal requires {{the application of a}} separate sealant in the joint, such as thread seal tape, or a liquid or paste <b>pipe</b> <b>sealant</b> such as pipe dope, however some threaded pipe joints do not require a separate sealant.|$|E
50|$|In 1986, Chemence Ltd. {{acquired}} {{the assets of}} Alembic Chemicals, a cyanoacrylate manufacturer in Dublin, Ireland. In 1988, the facility was moved to Corby (England), expanding product development and manufacturing to encompass anaerobic thread lockers (thread-locking fluid), retaining compounds, gasket makers and <b>pipe</b> <b>sealants,</b> UV curing products, and cyanoacrylate adhesives for consumer and industrial markets. Chemence Ltd. also manufactured a range of private label consumer adhesives for companies including Bostik, ASDA, TESCO, and B&Q.|$|R
50|$|Chemence (Inc., Ltd., Medical, Graphics) is a {{multinational}} conglomerate which manufactures products including cyanoacrylate adhesives, anaerobic adhesives, impregnation sealants, adhesive activators, epoxy resins, UV adhesives, photopolymer resins, custom printer ink cartridges, Gas <b>pipe</b> <b>sealants,</b> and soak off nail polishes. Chemence is a supplier of photopolymer and commercial printers to the flexographic {{industry in the}} U.S. and Europe, {{as well as the}} primary sealant supplier to British Gas, and a primary supplier of private-label adhesives to companies including Tesco, 3M, Bostik, and Bondo. The company's catalogue of patents includes processes, packaging devices, and chemical combinations.|$|R
50|$|Weld-On is a {{division}} of IPS Corporation, a manufacturer of solvent cements, primers, and cleaners for PVC, CPVC, and ABS plastic piping systems. Weld-On products are commonly used for joining plastic pipes and fittings. Weld-On also manufactures specialty products from repair adhesives for leaking <b>pipes,</b> <b>pipe</b> thread <b>sealants</b> / joint compounds, to test plugs for pipeline pressure testing. Their products are most commonly utilized in the irrigation, industrial, pool & spa, electrical conduit, and plumbing industries.|$|R
50|$|The {{threaded}} pipes {{used in some}} plumbing installations for {{the delivery}} of gases or liquids under pressure have a tapered thread that is slightly conical (in contrast to the parallel sided cylindrical section commonly found on bolts and leadscrews). The seal provided by a threaded pipe joint depends upon multiple factors: the labyrinth seal created by the threads; a positive seal between the threads created by thread deformation when they are tightened to the proper torque; and sometimes {{on the presence of}} a sealing coating, such as thread seal tape or a liquid or paste <b>pipe</b> <b>sealant</b> such as pipe dope. Tapered thread joints typically do not include a gasket.|$|E
30|$|Bisphenol-A (BPA) is an {{important}} manufacturing chemical that is intensively used in many consumer products, such as polycarbonate plastics, epoxy resins, medical instruments, baby toys, water <b>pipe,</b> dental <b>sealants,</b> food packaging liners, and coatings for tins (Huang et al. 2012; Makris et al. 2014). It has known that BPA annual production more than 4 million tons (Michalowicz 2014). Numerous studies established its occurrence in different ecological samples (Fu and Kawamura 2010; Rocha et al. 2013). Human BPA exposure sources including atmosphere, water, sewage, food, and dust (Michalowicz 2014). However, food is mainly the vital resource of common population contact to BPA (Vandenberg et al. 2007). BPA exposure was linked with sperm DNA damage increase {{and a decline in}} semen quality among men (Meeker et al. 2010). Moreover, it has been revealed that BPA was able to cause oxidative stress by forming reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Yi et al. 2011) that may cause genetic toxicity (Tiwari et al. 2012).|$|R
