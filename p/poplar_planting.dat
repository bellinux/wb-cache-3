40|$|Controlling {{competing}} vegetation {{during early}} growth {{is one of}} the most important practices for the successful establishment of poplar plantations. Today, most poplar plantations in temperate regions are established on abandoned marginal agricultural land where competing vegetation is usually present during the first years after planting. Thus, the objective of this study was to examine how the growth of two kinds of <b>poplar</b> <b>planting</b> materials, un-rooted cuttings and bare-rooted seedlings was influenced by different vegetation control and soil preparation practices. Across treatments, un-rooted cuttings grew more rapidly than the bare-rooted seedlings. Our results also show that mulching with a degradable carpet or permanent polyethylene plastic increased seedling growth to a similar extent and more strongly in the cases of no treatment (in control plots). In addition, the results suggest that soil preparation in the mulched area favored seedling growth, but this effect was restricted to the first year after planting. These findings indicate that optimal practices for establishing poplar plantations on former agricultural land include planting un-rooted cuttings in prepared soil and mulching...|$|E

New metabolites of CB 3, including 2 OH-CB 3 and 3 OH-CB 3, were confirmed in whole poplars (Populus deltoides × nigra, DN 34), a model {{plant in the}} application of phytoremediation. Furthermore, the concentrations and masses of 2 OH-CB 3 and 3 OH-CB 3 formed in various tissues of whole <b>poplar</b> <b>plants</b> and controls were measured. Results showed that 2 OH-CB 3 was the major product in these two OH-CB 3 s with chlorine and hydroxyl moieties in the same phenyl ring of CB 3. Masses of 2 OH-CB 3 and 3 OH-CB 3 in tissues of whole <b>poplar</b> <b>plants</b> were much higher than those in the hydroponic solution, strongly indicating that the <b>poplar</b> <b>plant</b> itself metabolizes CB 3 to both 2 OH-CB 3 and 3 OH-CB 3. The total yield of 2 OH-CB 3 and 3 OH-CB 3, with chlorine and hydroxyl in the same phenyl ring of CB 3, was less than that of three previously found OH-CB 3 s with chlorine and hydroxyl in the opposite phenyl rings of CB 3 (2 'OH-CB 3, 3 'OH-CB 3, and 4 'OH-CB 3). Finally, these two newly detected OH-CB 3 s from CB 3 in this work also suggests that the metabolic pathway was via epoxide intermediates. These five OH-CB 3 s clearly showed the complete metabolism profile from CB 3 to monohydroxylated CB 3.

40|$|Summary The mtl D gene {{encoding}} mannitol- 1 -phosphate dehydrogenase, which catalyzes the biosynthesis of mannitol from fructose, was cloned from Escherichia coli and trans-ferred to poplar (Populus tomentosa Carr.) through Agrobac-terium-mediated transformation. The transgenic {{plants were}} screened and selected on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium containing 30 – 50 mg l – 1 kanamycin and verified by polymer-ase chain reaction (PCR) and Southern blotting. Expression {{of the gene}} led to synthesis and accumulation of mannitol in the transgenic plants. Gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and capillary gas chromatography (GC) showed that transgenic plants accumulated much more mannitol in their tis-sues than the wild-type plants, whether cultured in vitro, or grown hydroponically or in the field. Increased salt tolerance of transgenic plants was observed both in vitro and in hydroponic culture. The transgenic buds rooted normally on MS medium containing 50 mM NaCl, whereas wild-type buds did not. In the 40 -day hydroponic ex-periments, transgenic <b>poplar</b> <b>plants</b> survived in a 75 -mM NaCl treatment, whereas the wild-type <b>poplar</b> <b>plants</b> tolerated only 25 mM NaCl. Under the same NaCl stress, stomatal conduc-tance, transpiration rates and photosynthetic rates were all higher in transgenic plants than in wild-type plants, whereas cellular relative conductivity was lower. We demonstrated that the mtlD gene was expressed in transgenic <b>poplar</b> <b>plants,</b> re-sulting {{either directly or indirectly}} in mannitol accumulation and improved salt tolerance. The constant mannitol concentra-tions in transgenic plants during the NaCl treatments indicated that mannitol accumulation caused by the mtlD gene was not a consequence of NaCl stress. Height growth was reduced by about 50 % in the transgenic plants compared with the wild-type plants in the absence of salt; however, relative growth rate was much less influenced by salt stress in transgenic plants than in wild-type plants. The stunted growth of the transgenic plants may in part explain their improved salt tolerance...|$|R

Both HRMAS NMR and IR enabled the differentiation of the metabolome of three different cultivars of beans deriving from either wild or transgenic genotype [49]. Moreover, the authors also reported an overexpression of quercetin and myricetin flavonoids in the transgenic beans. Roots and leaves of swingle citrumelo were investigated to prove the capability of a selected transgene to induce an overexpression of proline, an amino acid commonly associated with plant responses to certain environmental stress [50].

40|$|Graduation date: 1994 Hydrogen {{cyanamide}} (CY) induced earlier budbreak, more {{uniform and}} {{a higher percentage of}} budbreak in resting poplar (Populus alba x P. gradidentata, NC 5339) plants. However, it was phytotoxic to poplar when applied at 0. 5 M or higher concentrations. Percent budbreak increased and percent dieback decreased when <b>poplar</b> <b>plants</b> were treated with mixtures of CY and cysteine (Cys) compared to CY treatment alone. The levels of total glutathione and reduced glutathione (GSH) and activity of glutathione reductase (GR) decreased and amounts of oxidized glutathione (GSSG), ethylene and ethane and activity of glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase (G 6 PDH) increased with CY treatment in poplar. Mixing CY with Cys in vitro reduced the percentages of CY and Cys remaining in the mixtures over time. Hydrogen cyanamide was phytotoxic to bromegrass (Bromus inermis L.) cells in suspension cultures while cysteine reduced CY-induced phytotoxicity. In bromegrass cells, 2, 3, 5 -triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) reduction, cell regrowth and levels of total glutathione, GSH and GSSG, and activities of G 6 PDH and catalase, and contents of protein, malondialdehyde (MDA) and ethane decreased with CY treatment. Activities of GR, peroxidase were not affected and superoxide dismutase (SOD) increased slightly in 1 mM CY treatment for 24 hour incubation. These enzyme activities decreased in 5 mM CY treatment at the same incubation time. In ABA-treated bromegrass cells, TTC reduction and amounts of total glutathione, GSH, NADPH, protein, ethylene and activities of G 6 PDH, SOD, GR and catalase were higher or greater and amounts of GSSG and ethane were lower than those of -ABA control after freezing stress. Peroxidase activity and MDA content of -ABA control decreased with freezing treatment. Peroxidase activity of ABA-treated cells decreased at + 4 °C and did not change at - 9 °C. MDA content of ABA-treated cells was not affected by freezing treatment. These studies suggest that thiol containing compounds react directly with CY. The increased budbreak and reduced phytotoxicity of dormant <b>poplar</b> <b>plants</b> caused by mixing CY with SH containing compounds {{may be due to the}} reduction of CY concentration.

The <b>poplar</b> <b>plant</b> was grown in the clay standard under controlled laboratory conditions {{during a period of}} about three months. REEs were shown to fractionate in the clay mineral and plant materials with greater fractionation observed in plant materials. The REE data provide insight into the process of weathering of clay minerals such as a Ca-bearing smectite and provide insight into the degradation of and the composition of clay minerals in the plant environment. The degradation process is not followed by significant interlayer ion exchange effect on remaining clay minerals in the root environment. REEs were found to be transported into complex forms, potentially as REE-carboxylic anion pair complexes. The plant materials in this study were in general heavy REE (HREE) enriched relative to the source clay minerals due to the complexation effect. The REE anomalies observed in this study, in addition to the Ce and Eu anomalies, may be explained by the selective uptake by the plant by an enzyme effect rather than due to the influence of oxidation-reduction. The enzyme influence was more evident in the REE distribution when compared among the plant organs. These REE characteristics described for the plants may eventually be incorporated with data from numerous other studies and also used as a guide in the assessment of the contribution of plant materials to dissolved REE content in surface water and groundwater...|$|R

The key step in the pathway is the reduction of activated sulphate, adenosine 5 ′-phosphosulphate (APS), to sulphite catalysed by APS reductase (APR). In the present study, [35 S]sulphur flux from external sulphate into glutathione (GSH) and proteins was analysed to check whether APR controls the flux through the sulphate assimilation pathway in poplar roots under some stress conditions and in transgenic poplars. (i) O-Acetylserine (OAS) induced APR activity and the sulphur flux into GSH. (ii) The herbicide Acetochlor induced APR activity and results in a decline of GSH. Thereby the sulphur flux into GSH or protein remained unaffected. (iii) Cd treatment increased APR activity without any changes in sulphur flux but lowered sulphate uptake. Several transgenic <b>poplar</b> <b>plants</b> that were manipulated in sulphur metabolism were also analysed. (i) Transgenic <b>poplar</b> <b>plants</b> that overexpressed the γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase (γ-ECS) gene, the enzyme catalysing the key step in GSH formation, showed an increase in sulphur flux into GSH and sulphate uptake when γ-ECS was targeted to the cytosol, while no changes in sulphur flux were observed when γ-ECS was targeted to plastids. (ii) No effect on sulphur flux was observed when the sulphite oxidase (SO) gene from Arabidopsis thaliana, which catalyses the back reaction of APR, that is the reaction from sulphite to sulphate, was overexpressed. (iii) When Lemna minor APR was overexpressed in poplar, APR activity increased as expected, but no changes in sulphur flux were observed. For all of these experiments the flux control coefficient for APR was calculated. APR as a controlling step in sulphate assimilation seems obvious under OAS treatment, in γ-ECS and SO overexpressing poplars. A possible loss of control under certain conditions, that is Cd treatment, Acetochlor treatment, and in APR overexpressing poplar, is discussed...|$|R
30|$|Gold {{nanoparticles}} {{coated with}} polymers are stabilised and released slowly thereby reducing their toxicity and agglomeration. Furthermore, the uptake and incorporation of nanoparticles into the plant cells {{have been discussed}} by many researchers [5, 24, 56 – 58]. Penetration of gold nanoparticles into the protoplasts by endocytosis {{was found to be}} linked to different pathways [59]. Their penetration through lipid membranes bypassing endocytosis has also been reported. TEM images exhibited the presence of gold nanoparticle in the cytoplasm of root cells of Sesbania drummondii [18]. Rodriguez et al. [17] have hypothesised that gold nanoparticles in the solution are associated with the carboxylic acid moieties present in the cell wall and thus once the gold particles enter root cells, they are transported symplastically to the aerial parts of the plant. S. drummondii exhibits intracellular formation of nanomaterials perhaps because of metal ion reduction by secondary metabolites present in the cells. Recently, it has been demonstrated that tomato can uptake gold nanoparticles without altering its properties [60]. In an experiment, Zhai and coworkers [57] used <b>poplar</b> <b>plants</b> (Populus deltoides[*]×[*]nigra, DN- 34) to explore the vegetative uptake of gold nanoparticles and their subsequent translocation and transport into plant cells.

Redox process of converting Au 3 +→Au 0 was confirmed from a change in colour from yellow to pink in the hydroponic solution containing the stem of <b>poplar</b> <b>plant.</b> Nearly 90  % Au 3 + ions were reduced to Au 0 in 2  days. It is now believed that all metal nutrients in ionic form are slowly reduced to metallic form and transported to various parts of the plant. They have demonstrated that the Au 3 + ions were absorbed by the roots of poplar and reduced them to gold nanoparticles without dissolving in Au 3 + ions. Thereafter, the gold nanoparticles were observed in the cytoplasm and various organelles of the root and leaf cells. The aggregation of gold nanoparticles in the plasmodesmata might affect the transport of nutrients and other materials from companion cells, which may produce the toxic effect observed on <b>poplar</b> <b>plants.</b> In addition, authors also found the presence of gold nanoparticles inside the leaves and mainly existed in the xylem suggesting that gold nanoparticles also followed the transmission route of water and nutrients through the xylem to the leaves.|$|R
30|$|At each site, hybrid poplar {{riparian}} buffers where {{planted in}} spring 2003 at a density of 2222 stems per hectare {{on both sides}} of the streams for a total length of 90  m and a width of 4.5  m on each stream bank. Bare-root hybrid <b>poplar</b> <b>plants</b> were 1  year-old when they were planted. In the year of the study (2011), the buffers were in their 9 th growing season. No site preparation was done prior to planting and tending operations consisted in a single localised herbicide treatment (1  m 2 /tree) in June 2003. Information regarding hybrid poplar buffer management, aboveground biomass and volume growth, aboveground nutrient and C accumulation, and understory biomass and diversity can be found in previous studies (Fortier et al. 2010 a, 2010 b, 2011; 2012; 2013).|$|R
