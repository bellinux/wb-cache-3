40|$|To {{capture the}} {{asymmetrical}} shear behaviour of a bi-axial NCF with a <b>pillar</b> <b>stitch,</b> a non-orthogonal constitutive model {{was developed and}} implemented in finite element forming simulations. Preforming experiments indicate that the local distribution of defects is significantly different {{on both sides of}} each bi-axial ply, with two different defect mechanisms observed. Correlation with simulation results indicates that one defect type is caused by excessive shear, inducing out-of-plane wrinkling in regions of positive shear (macro-scale wrinkling). The other defect type is caused by fibre compression, inducing in-plane wrinkling in regions of negative shear (meso-scale wrinkling). Local distributions of shear angle and wrinkling strain were used to determine the wrinkling mode and to confirm the corresponding defect mechanism. Results indicate that simulations based on the advanced constitutive model can predict local shear angles within ± 5 °of experimental values and that predicted wrinkling positions and defect types correlate well with the experiments...|$|E
40|$|Effects {{of fabric}} {{structures}} on the tensile properties of warp-knitted fabrics used as concrete reinforcements Oleg Stolyarov 1, Till Quadflieg 2 and Thomas Gries 2 High-performance textiles are now {{widely used in}} civil engineering applications. This work explores {{the differences between the}} tensile properties of weft inlay warp-knitted fabrics of high-strength glass and carbon rovings as concrete reinforcements. In this study, 12 types of warp-knitted fabrics with different stitch patterns, including tricot, cord, and pillar stitches, were produced. The effect of the stitch type on the tensile properties of the fabrics was examined. The stitch type was found to significantly affect the tensile properties of the warp-knitted fabrics. The results showed that the tensile strength of fabrics with tricot and cord stitches is greater than that of fabrics with the <b>pillar</b> <b>stitch.</b> The increase in tensile strength was 14 % for fabrics made of glass roving and 21 % for fabrics made of carbon rovings. A similar gradation was observed for the Young’s modulus of the fabrics. The Young’s modulus was 11 % and 25 % higher for glass and carbon fabrics, respectively. The structural parameters of the warp-knitted fabrics, including the geometry of the stitch pattern and the yarn cross-sectional shape in a fabric that affect the tensile properties, were analyzed...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} and optimisation of automated fabric preforming processes {{is critical for}} the adoption of composite materials for low cost, high volume applications. This thesis presents {{the development of a}} numerical material model to simulate the forming of 2 D fabric plies into complex 3 D shapes. The material model has been used to evaluate the feasibility of using matched-tool forming and double diaphragm forming, to manufacture low cost fabric preforms suitable for liquid moulding processes. The research has focused on two main aspects: (I) fabric characterisation and modelling and (II) process simulation and optimisation. The forming behaviour of woven fabrics and non-crimp fabrics (NCF) has been investigated to understand the deformation mechanisms and the cause of defects, in order to seek feasible solutions for defect reduction. A non-orthogonal constitutive relation has been developed to capture the nonlinear material behaviour, which was implemented in an explicit finite element model and used to refine the forming process. Results from the material model indicate that <b>pillar</b> <b>stitched</b> NCFs are not as compliant as woven fabrics of the same areal mass. The likelihood of defects is therefore higher for the NCF and the shear behaviour is axisymmetric due to the influence of the stitch yarn. The NCF material exhibits two types of wrinkling during matched tool forming; out-of-plane wrinkling at the ply level (macro-scale wrinkling) induced by excessive shear, and in-plane wrinkling at the bundle level (meso-scale wrinkling) caused by fibre compression. Stitch rupture can also occur at high shear angles, which can lead to further localised wrinkling. Fabric bridging is the dominant defect in large curvature regions when using double diaphragm forming (DDF), and wrinkling was found to be generally lower than in matched-tool forming. The model has been used to successfully identify the cause of all of these defects in NCF preforms manufactured by DDF, and has been used to optimise preform geometry and process parameters to mitigate these problems. Darts were added to preforms to alleviate fabric bridging and improve surface conformity, using the tensile stress in the yarns to identify suitable positions and orientations, minimising the effect on the mechanical performance of the component. An optimisation methodology has been developed for placing local inter-ply stitches on multi-ply preforms, by coupling the FE analysis with a genetic algorithm. The stitches enable multiple plies to be joined together to aid robotic handling and the optimisation routine ensures that the placement of the stitches does not adversely affect the formability of the preform. Results indicate that whilst the inter-ply stitches affect the shear distribution at a global level, the formability of a multi-ply preform can be improved compared to the unstitched counterpart by optimising the pattern of through-thickness stitches. A two-step optimisation method was also developed to optimise the boundary conditions for a matched tool forming scenario. Spring-loaded clamps were used to provide in-plane tension in the fabric plies during forming, rather than using a blank holder to induce tension through friction, providing an opportunity to reduce preform size and therefore waste. The optimisation algorithm was used to determine the location and size of the clamps around the blank perimeter and the stiffness of the attached springs. It was shown that this method can effectively homogenise the global shear angle distribution, reducing the peak shear angle compared to using a segmented blank holder...|$|R
