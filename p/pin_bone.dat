On March 22, NJPW announced that Yoshitatsu would wrestle his NJPW return match on April 10 at Invasion Attack 2016, where he, Hiroshi Tanahashi and Michael Elgin defeated Bullet Club's The Elite (Kenny Omega and The Young Bucks (Matt Jackson and Nick Jackson)) to win the NEVER Openweight 6-Man Tag Team Championship. Afterwards, Yoshitatsu announced he was forming a new stable named [...] "Hunter Club" [...] to oppose Bullet Club. However, neither Elgin nor Tanahashi accepted Yoshitatsu's invitation to join the stable, which led to Captain New Japan stepping up as the first member of the new group. Yoshitatsu then debuted a new gimmick, where he began mimicking Triple H, which included him adopting the Pedigree as his finishing move. Yoshitatsu, Elgin and Tanahashi made their first successful title defense on April 23 against the Bullet Club trio of Bad Luck Fale, Kenny Omega and Yujiro Takahashi. On May 3 at Wrestling Dontaku 2016, they lost the title back to Omega and The Young Bucks. On September 12, Yoshitatsu, upset with Captain New Japan's poor performances, announced a twitter poll that would decide whether he would get to stay in Hunter Club. On September 25 at Destruction in Kobe, Yoshitatsu revealed the result of the poll and agreed to remove Captain New Japan from Hunter Club. This led to Captain attacking Yoshitatsu and aligning himself with Bullet Club. After starting a feud with Captain New Japan, now renamed [...] "Bone Soldier", Yoshitatsu announced on November 5 that he had recruited Billy Gunn as his new Hunter Club partner for the 2016 World Tag League. Yoshitatsu and Gunn finished the tournament on December 8 with a record of three wins and four losses, failing to advance from their block, though Yoshitatsu managed to <b>pin</b> <b>Bone</b> Soldier in their final round-robin match. In April 2017, Yoshitatsu joined the Taguchi Japan stable.|$|E
40|$|Post mortem {{storage is}} a {{necessary}} process for removal of pin bones without destruction of fillets, thereby avoiding volume and economic loss. However, the enzymes involved in loosening pin bones during storage have not been studied to a great extent. In this study, the activities and localization of MMPs in the connective tissue (CT) of pin bones dissected from fillet of salmon and cod were investigated. Interestingly, the enzyme activity profile in these two species was different during post mortem storage of fish fillets. Adding MMP inhibitor (GM 6001) and serine protease inhibitor (Pefabloc) revealed different effects in the two species, suggesting different regulations in salmon and cod. In situ zymography with the same inhibitors verified MMP and serine protease activity in CT close to <b>pin</b> <b>bone</b> at early post mortem (6 h) in salmon. However, MMP inhibition was not evident in cod in this area at that time point. Immunohistochemistry further revealed MMP 9 and MMP 13 were located more to the outer rim of CT, facing the <b>pin</b> <b>bone</b> and adipose tissue, while MMP 7 was more randomly distributed within CT in salmon. In contrast, all these three MMPs were randomly distributed in CT in cod. In summary, our study reveals different MMP enzyme profiles in salmon and cod in the <b>pin</b> <b>bone</b> area, influenced by serine proteases, and suggests that MMPs and serine proteases must be taken in consideration when studying the conditions for early <b>pin</b> <b>bone</b> removal...|$|E

The further development was requested from the Swedish consulting firm ATM AB. The request of automatic <b>pin</b> <b>bone</b> removers is high and {{has the potential to}} be a worldwide leading product. The goal with the thesis work is to further develop an existing prototype. In order to achieve the goal a pre-study of the prototype had to be made in order to define a customer demand specification. The thesis work is then continued by a function analysis which differs from a conservative one.  For each sub-function various sub solutions a made. The advantage of this method is that it results in various total solutions which after an evaluation one will be chosen for further development. To examine if the fully developed prototype achieved the given demands a test specification was made. The tests resulted in success, however later in the thesis it is recommended to perform tests on a real prototype to ensure that the given demands are fulfilled. These tests however are not a part of this thesis.

40|$|Pin bones {{represent}} {{a major problem}} for processing and quality of fish products. Development of methods of removal requires better knowledge of the pin bones’ attachment to the muscle and structures involved in the breakdown during loosening. In this study, pin bones from cod and salmon were dissected from fish fillets after slaughter or storage on ice for 5 days, and thereafter analysed with molecular methods, which revealed major differences between these species before and after storage. The connective tissue (CT) attaches the <b>pin</b> <b>bone</b> to the muscle in cod, while the pin bones in salmon are embedded in adipose tissue. Collagens, elastin, lectin-binding proteins and glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are all components of the attachment site, and this differ between salmon and cod, resulting in a CT in cod that is more resistant to enzymatic degradation compared to the CT in salmon. Structural differences are reflected in the composition of transcriptome. Microarray analysis comparing the attachment sites of the pin bones with a reference muscle sample showed limited differences in salmon. In cod, on the other hand, the variances were substantial, and the gene expression profiles suggested difference in myofibre structure, metabolism and cell processes between the <b>pin</b> <b>bone</b> attachment site and the reference muscle. Degradation of the connective tissue occurs closest to the pin bones and not in the neighbouring tissue, which was shown using light microscopy. This study shows that the attachment of the pin bones in cod and salmon is different; therefore, the development of methods for removal should be tailored to each individual species...|$|E

40|$|In {{the first}} section of the present paper, the authors were {{concerned}} with heritability estimates for body measurements, and genetic correlations among these traits in 600 daughter dam pairs sired by 20 different bulls, extracted from the recent files of Japanese Brown Cattle Society. In the second section, they were concerned with the heritability estimate for body weight and relations of body measurements to the body weight, using another data on 170 half sisters sired by 10 different bulls in the same breed. Heritability estimates for body measurements based on daughter dam relationships were 0. 42 for withers height, 0. 48 for hip height, 0. 40 for body length, 0. 39 for heart girth, 0. 30 for chest depth, 0. 25 for chest width, 0. 30 for rump length, 0. 39 for hip width, 0. 30 for thurl width, 0. 21 for <b>pin</b> <b>bone</b> width, and 0. 36 for fore shin circumference. While, higher and more variable estimates were obtained from half sib relationships. Considering the fact that there might be some uneven environmental conditions among half sister groups, the authors prefered the figures obtained from the daughter dam relationships as the more reliable estimates. Genetic correlations among body measurements, except of <b>pin</b> <b>bone</b> width, were fairly high. According to the facts, the authors suggested that there may be considerable difficulty to realize the current idea to enlarge body capacity with a restriction of height of withers or hip. Relatively low heritability of 0. 28 was estimated for body weight based on the half sib relationship. On the other hand, in partial correlations between body measurements and body weight, excluding the influence of withers height, the highest figure was obtained between heart girth and body weight. According to the fact, the authors suggested that the most reliable indicators in the body measurements to the selection for gain or weight may be the heart girth or traits related to chest size. 本報の第 1 部において著者らは,日本褐毛和牛登録協会発行の最近の登録簿から, 20 頭の種雄牛による 600 対の娘母牛群を抽出し,体尺測定値の遺伝率およびそれらの遺伝相関を評価した. 第 2 部においては, 10 頭の種雄牛による 170 頭の半姉妹牛群について,体重の遺伝率および体尺測定値と体重の関係について検討した. 娘母の関係から評価した体尺測定値の遺伝率は,体高 0. 42,十字部高 0. 48,体長 0. 40,胸囲 0. 39,胸深 0. 30,胸幅O. 25,尻長O. 30,腰角幅O. 39,寛幅 0. 30,坐骨幅 0. 21,管囲 0. 36 であつた. 一方半姉妹の関係から評価した遺伝率は,これらよりやや高く,さらに不斉一であつた. しかし半姉妹群の環境条件に多少とも斉一でない点があることを考慮して,著者らは娘母の関係から評価した数値を,信頼性が高いものとして採択した. 体尺測定値間の遺伝相関は,坐骨幅を例外とすれば,いずれもかなり高いことが認められた. この事実に墓ついて著者らは,体高を抑制して体積を増大しようとする現在の構想の突現には,かなりの困難が予想されることを示唆した,半姉妹の関係から評価された体重の遺伝率は比較的低く, 0. 28 であつた. 一方体高の影響を除いた体尺測定値と体重との偏相関では,胸囲と体重との間にもつとも高い数値が得られた. そこで著者らは,体重または増体量に関する選抜の指標としては,胸囲または胸部に関する測定値をとるのが妥当であることを示唆した...|$|E

The communality ranged from 0. 83 (hip bone distance) to 0. 45 (horn length) and unique factors ranged from 0. 16 to 0. 55 for all these 13 different biometric traits. Present study suggests that first principal component {{can be used in}} the evaluation and comparison of body conformation in buffaloes and thus provides an opportunity to distinguish between early and late maturing to adult, based on a small group of biometric traits to explain body conformation in adult buffaloes...|$|E
40|$|Generally {{regarded}} {{as little more}} than a mundane tool employed in daily life, the humble hairpin occasionally played a rather more prominent role in history than has perhaps been appreciated. As the most ancient implements associated with hair styling, simple <b>pins</b> of <b>bone</b> and ivory were commonly employed in Egypt by c. 4000 BC as a means of securing long hair in an upswept style (e. g. Petrie and Mace 1901, 21, 34). Although their occasional use by men undermines the assumption that hairpins are 'a relatively certain example of a “gendered” artefact' (Wilfong 1997, 67), the vast majority have been found in female burials. They can be made of bone and ivory, wood, steatite, glass, gold, silver and bronze, and two 12 cm long bronze examples were found within the hair of Princess Ahmosi c. 1550 BC (Fletcher 1995, 376, 441) while the hair of an anonymous woman at Gurob c. AD 110 had been secured in a bun with <b>pins</b> of <b>bone,</b> tortoiseshell and silver (Walker and Bierbrier 1997, 209) ...|$|R
5000|$|The Himalayan rabbit is {{well known}} for its {{markings}}, which are similar to the Himalayan cats'. They have dark ears, front feet (socks), hind feet (boots), a dark tail, and a dark spot on nose (egg). The markings change with age and environment. The colder weather may darken markings, enlarge markings, and also add markings around the eyes and genitals (vent smut). These markings are not a disqualification because it is not on the usable portion of the pelt. If the markings spread into the usable portion of the pelt, such as into the belly or on the <b>pin</b> <b>bones,</b> it is a disqualification. Warmer weather may lighten markings, shrink markings, and cause white hairs in markings (known as [...] "frosting"). In extreme warm weather, a Himalayan may even develop light or white toenails. Chocolate and lilac Himalayans usually have bigger markings than blacks and blues, {{and are more likely to}} develop disqualifying markings, known as [...] "smut". Himalayans may develop smut after just ten minutes of contact to cold objects.|$|R
