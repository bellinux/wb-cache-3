50|$|Originally {{designed}} to be greater than, or equal to, the construction and performance specifics of an inner container, the Performance Oriented Packaging Standards (POPS) of the US Department of Transportation requirement was that the Salvage Drum {{be at least a}} 'Z' (<b>Packing</b> <b>Group</b> III) solids container. Convinced that this was not an acceptable test for a Salvage Drum, on January 1, 1998, the 'T' Salvage Drum (1A2T) became the UN recommended salvage packaging for international shipments. The US-DOT, per 49 CFR 173.3, also recognizes the 'T' Salvage Drum for shipments within the US. Unlike the original 49 CFR Salvage Drum requirement, the 'T' Salvage Drum is most commonly an 85 US gallon capacity steel drum that, meets UN Model Regulations test requirement 6.1.5.1.11, which specifies that when filled with water, the drum can qualify for <b>Packing</b> <b>Group</b> II and be dropped 1.2 meters (4 feet) on its most critical orientation, and not leak. In addition, the drum must successfully pass a 30 kPa Leakproofness Test. Both tests are very severe for an open-head steel container. This testing illustrates the extreme capabilities of the 'T' Salvage Drum when used for the safe recovery of hazardous materials in transportation.|$|E

After re-tooling, the facility operates with approximately 1,200 people and processes over 9,000 pigs per day. This 800,000 square foot (74,000 m²) facility produces fresh and frozen pork products to domestic and export customers. Additionally, the Clinton plant specializes in producing further processed pork and other ready-to-eat products such as ham and bacon products.

40|$|Motivation: While protein {{secondary}} structure is well understood, representing the repetitive nature of tertiary packing in proteins remains difficult. We {{have developed a}} construct called the relative <b>packing</b> <b>group</b> (RPG) that applies the clique concept from graph theory as a natural basis for defining the packing motifs in proteins. An RPG {{is defined as a}} clique of residues, where every member contacts all others as determined by the Delaunay tessellation. Geometrically similar RPGs define a regular element of tertiary structure or tertiary motif (TerMo). This intuitive construct provides a simple approach to characterize general repetitive elements of tertiary structure...|$|E

40|$|An {{alternative}} core <b>packing</b> <b>group,</b> {{involving a}} set of five positions, has been introduced into human acidic FGF- 1. This alternative group was designed so as to constrain the primary structure within the core region to the same threefold symmetry present in the tertiary structure of the protein fold (the β-trefoil superfold). The alternative core is essentially indistinguishable from the WT core with regard to structure, stability, and folding kinetics. The {{results show that the}} β-trefoil superfold is compatible with a threefold symmetric constraint on the core region, as might be the case if the superfold arose as a result of gene duplication/fusion events. Furthermore, this new core arrangement can form the basis of a structural “building block” that can greatly simplify the de novo design of β-trefoil proteins by using symmetric structural complementarity. Remaining asymmetry within the core appears to be related to asymmetry in the tertiary structure associated with receptor and heparin binding functionality of the growth factor...|$|E
