50|$|In M v M a Hindu {{marriage}} was entered into between a minor and the defendant, a major. An {{agreement was reached}} between the defendant and the plaintiff, acting {{in his capacity as}} father and natural guardian of his minor daughter, that the marriage would subsequently be registered according to the laws of South Africa. After their Hindu marriage, the minor (a virgin), in anticipation of their civil marriage, allowed the defendant to have sex with her. The defendant subsequently repudiated his obligation to register the marriage, and the <b>plaintiff</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>damages</b> for seduction and breach of promise to marry.|$|R
50|$|The plaintiff, {{under an}} {{arrangement}} with the defendant, left his car at the latter's garage each day at a monthly charge. The defendant undertook to dust the car each day and polish it once a month. Inside the garage was a notice—"Cars garaged at owner's risk"—of which the plaintiff was aware. The car having {{been removed from the}} garage by a person employed by the defendant to look after the cars in the garage, and having been severely damaged in a collision with a building, the <b>plaintiff</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>damages</b> for breach of the defendant's obligation to keep the car safe in the garage.|$|R
50|$|Rei vindicatio is a {{legal action}} by which the {{plaintiff}} demands that the defendant return a thing that belongs to the plaintiff. It may only be used when plaintiff owns the thing, and the defendant is somehow impeding the plaintiff's possession of the thing. The plaintiff could also institute an actio furti (a personal action) to punish the defendant. If the thing could not be recovered, the <b>plaintiff</b> could <b>claim</b> <b>damages</b> from the defendant {{with the aid of}} the condictio furtiva (a personal action). With the aid of the actio legis Aquiliae (a personal action), the <b>plaintiff</b> could <b>claim</b> <b>damages</b> from the defendant. Rei vindicatio was derived from the ius civile, therefore was only available to Roman citizens.|$|R

40|$|Wei Fan v South Eastern Sydney Local Health District (No 2) 1 is a {{professional}} negligence decision given by Harrison AsJ on 31 August 2015. In this case, the <b>plaintiff</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>damages</b> for medical negligence {{on the basis of}} delayed diagnoses which caused him significant injuries. This case serves as {{a good example of the}} importance of credible lay and expert evidence, particularly where the facts include multiple hospitals and multiple admissions. This case also provides a reasonable example of the interplay between different mitigating defences including contributory negligence, failure to mitigate and volenti non fit injuria (voluntary assumption of risk). Ultimately, as the plaintiff’s evidence was not substantial or credible, the <b>plaintiff’s</b> <b>claim</b> failed. The court also went further and determined that (had the plaintiff been successful) there would have been a non-specific discount for contributory negligence...|$|R
40|$|Case note on Sheehy v Hobbs [2012]. It is well {{established}} that a landlord owes a tenant a duty of care to “take reasonable care to avoid foreseeable risk of injury to their prospective tenants and members of their household”. 1 What often arises {{is the question of}} how far the scope of that duty extends. In Sheehy v Hobbs [2012] QSC 333 the plaintiff was injured when she fell down a flight of internal stairs of the townhouse she leased from the defendants. The <b>plaintiff</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>damages</b> for a breach of duty owed to her in negligence, and also alleged breaches of the duties owed to her pursuant to s 103 of the Residential Tenancies Act 1994 (Qld) and her tenancy agreement...|$|R
5000|$|In {{ruling on}} summary {{judgment}} motions the Northern District Judge ruled that liability {{for an open}} source copyright violation nevertheless did not support <b>Plaintiff's</b> <b>claim</b> for <b>damages.</b> The Ruling rendered <b>Plaintiff's</b> <b>claim</b> pointless since the Plaintiff could not recover money damages. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the trial judge holding an open source copyright claim was enforceable and awarded damages. The case then settled on February 16, 2010. The case is noted for its contentiousness, the parties filing 405 motions and other pleadings with the trial court, and two appeals to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.|$|R
50|$|The {{companies}} {{entered into}} a series of contracts between them, which contained terms to the effect of fixing the prices of goods for traders, and the terms on which the goods could be retailed. It was alleged that all of this was done in restraint of, or with intent to restrain, trade and commerce among the States. The <b>plaintiffs</b> <b>claimed</b> that <b>damage</b> resulted from the contracts, arising in their inability to obtain tyres and other goods at wholesale prices and the ability to obtain them only at the prices established under the contracts.|$|R
5000|$|If the {{defendant}} chooses to file an answer within the time permitted, the answer must address {{each of the}} plaintiffs' allegations. The defendant has three choices to make, which include either admitting to the allegation, denying it, or pleading a lack of sufficient information to admit or deny the allegation. Some jurisdictions, like California, still authorize general denials {{of each and every}} allegation in the complaint. At the time {{the defendant}} files an answer, the defendant also raises all [...] "affirmative" [...] defenses. The defendant may also assert counterclaims for damages or equitable relief against the plaintiff. For example, in the case of [...] "compulsory counterclaims," [...] the defendant must assert some form of counterclaim or risk having the counterclaim barred in any subsequent proceeding. In the case of making a counterclaim, the defendant is making a motion directed towards the <b>plaintiff</b> <b>claiming</b> that he/she was injured in some way or would like to sue the plaintiff. The plaintiff in this example would then receive some amount of time to make a reply to this counterclaim. The defendant may also file a [...] "third party complaint", which is the defendant's privilege to join another party or parties in the action with the belief that those parties may be liable for {{some or all of the}} <b>plaintiff's</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>damages.</b> An answer from the defendant in response to the claims made against him/her, can also include additional facts or a so-called [...] "excuse" [...] for the plead. Filing an answer [...] "joins the cause" [...] and moves the case into the pre-trial phase.|$|R
5000|$|Cox also {{asserted}} {{that even if}} the plaintiffs weren't public figures, in order for the <b>plaintiffs</b> to <b>claim</b> <b>damages,</b> they must prove actual malice because she is a [...] "media" [...] outlet. Here, the court again held that Cox did not qualify as [...] "media". In its reasoning, the court cited her lack of a journalism degree, lack of affiliation with traditional media outlets, lack of adherence to journalistic standards such as fact-checking and fair coverage, and the absence of Cox writing any original material rather than assembling the works of others. As such, the plaintiffs could seek damages without any further evidence of actual malice.|$|R
40|$|The recent {{decision}} of Waller v James involved a <b>claim</b> by the <b>plaintiff</b> parents for damages for wrongful birth against the defendant doctor, Dr James, a gynaecologist with a practice in infertility and IVF procedures, {{who had been}} consulted by the plaintiffs. The second plaintiff, Mr Waller suffered an inherited anti-thrombin deficiency (ATD), a condition which results in a propensity for the blood to clot, at least in adults. Dr James subsequently recommended IVF treatment. The first plaintiff, Mrs Waller became pregnant after the first cycle of IVF treatment. Her son Keeden was born on 10 August 2000 with a genetic anti-thrombin deficiency. Keeden was released from hospital on 14 August 2000. However, he was {{brought back to the}} hospital the next day with cerebral thrombosis (CSVT). As a result of the thrombosis, he suffered permanent brain damage, cerebral palsy and related disabilities. The plaintiffs alleged that the defendant was in breach of contract and his common law duty of care to the plaintiffs in failing to inform them, or cause them to be informed, of the hereditary aspects of ATD. They further alleged that, had they been properly informed, they would not have proceeded to conceive a child using the male plaintiff’s sperm and therefore avoided the harm that had befallen them. The <b>plaintiffs</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>damages</b> to compensate them for their losses, including psychiatric and physical injuries and the costs of having, raising and caring for Keeden. The defendant was held to be not liable in negligence by Justice Hislop of the Supreme Court of New South Wales because a finding was made on medical causation which was adverse to the <b>plaintiffs</b> <b>claim...</b>|$|R
40|$|For {{almost five}} decades, the injury-in-fact {{requirement}} {{has been a}} mainstay of Article III standing doctrine. Critics have attacked the requirement as incoherent and unduly malleable. But the Supreme Court has continued to announce “injury in fact” as the bedrock of justiciability. In Spokeo v. Robins, the Supreme Court confronted a high profile and recurrent conflict regarding the standing of <b>plaintiffs</b> <b>claiming</b> statutory <b>damages.</b> It clarified some matters, but remanded the case for final resolution. This Essay derives from the cryptic language of Spokeo a six stage process (complete with flowchart) that represents the Court’s current equilibrium. We put each step {{in the context of}} standing precedent. We show that while Spokeo added some structure to the injury in fact doctrine, each stage of the analysis allows play in the joints that leaves future courts and litigants substantial room for maneuver...|$|R
5000|$|At {{the same}} time UK media {{reported}} that over 130 lawsuits relating to the spill had been filed against {{one or more of}} BP, Transocean, Cameron International Corporation, and Halliburton Energy Services, although it was considered likely by observers that these would be combined into one court as a multidistrict litigation. Because the spill had been largely lingering offshore, the <b>plaintiffs</b> who <b>claimed</b> <b>damages</b> at that time were mostly out-of-work fishermen and tourist resorts that were receiving cancellations. [...] BP and Transocean wanted the cases to be heard in Houston, seen as friendly to the oil business, but the plaintiffs requested the case be heard in Louisiana, Mississippi or Florida. Five New Orleans judges recused themselves from hearing oil spill cases because of stock ownership in companies involved or other conflicts of interest. [...] BP has retained law firm Kirkland & Ellis to defend most of the lawsuits arising from the oil spill.|$|R
50|$|Since {{the passage}} of the federal Americans with Disabilities Act, {{disability}} access violations count among the practices that run afoul of the Unruh act. Combined with the California Disabled Persons Acts, disability access plaintiffs are allowed to tack on state <b>claims</b> for money <b>damages</b> onto requests for injunctive relief in ADA lawsuits. The act allows <b>plaintiffs</b> to <b>claim</b> treble <b>damages</b> with a minimum of $4000 per access violation plus attorneys fees. In most states, plaintiffs are entitled to only injunctive relief, having the disability access issue fixed. As a result of the <b>damages</b> <b>claimed</b> under Unruh Act, California accounts for 42% of all ADA litigation nationwide. However, in California, damages may be reduced in certain cases to $2,000 or $1,000 if construction related accessibility violations are corrected within 30-60 days of being served with a complaint.|$|R

Nowadays, instead, it’s not like that anymore, in particular if the <b>plaintiff</b> <b>claims</b> a non-pecuniary <b>damage.</b> Also in this case negligence is based just on the breach of duty of care, whereas the Italian Corte di Cassazione has clarified that a violation of a constitutional human right is demanded to the application of art. 2059 c. c. When to come into consideration, however, is the protection of health, the practical results tend to coincide to the point of bringing out a convergence on the need for an objective approach towards this right.

5000|$|The {{defendant}} {{may also}} raise equitable defenses such as {{failure of consideration}} or unconscionability, which operate to diminish {{the value of the}} <b>plaintiff's</b> <b>claim.</b> This is referred to as [...] "common law recoupment". By statute, Virginia has established that such defenses can be raised in response to a contractual <b>damages</b> <b>claim,</b> and that the defendant may even recover damages in excess of the <b>plaintiff's</b> <b>claim.</b> Under the statute, however, the court lacks the power to order reform or rescission of the contract.|$|R

5000|$|Besides {{the factual}} {{issues that the}} jury was called on to adjudicate, there was a legal issue of what {{constituted}} [...] "seduction" [...] under the law. The basis of the claim was a two-hundred-year-old tort which allowed a man to sue anybody who impregnated his female servant. The basis for damages under such a claim was the servant's inability to perform her duties {{to the detriment of}} the employer. The tort was later broadened to allow the seductee's father to sue; only in statute in 1903 was the law amended to give standing to the woman herself. At issue was what damage, if any, she needed to show in order to have a cause of action. The defence argued that in all precedents there had been a pregnancy resulting, and that without one the <b>plaintiffs</b> could not <b>claim</b> <b>damages.</b> In response, MacLean emphasized the not entirely consensual nature of the alleged relationship. Brownlee himself responded that if the alleged relationship had been non-consensual, he should have been charged under the criminal law for rape, not sued for seduction; that the plaintiffs had not attempted to press criminal charges was evidence, he believed, of their bad faith and financial motivation.|$|R
40|$|A recent {{decision}} of the Queensland Court of Appeal involved an unusual statement of claim made {{on behalf of the}} developer of a proposed resort in Port Douglas. The decision is The Beach Club Port Douglas Pty Ltd v Page [2005] QCA 475. The issue The defendant had objected to a development application of the plaintiff developer and lodged an appeal in the Planning and Environment Court against the council decision granting a development permit. The main issue in the Planning and Environment Court was whether the site coverage of the proposed resort was excessive. In a separate action (the subject matter of the present appeal), the <b>plaintiff</b> developer <b>claimed</b> <b>damages</b> for ‘negligence’ alleging that the defendant had breached a duty of care not to appeal without properly or reasonably assessing whether the development qualified for a permit given that the resort qualified for the maximum allowable site coverage. It was alleged that the appeal lodged by the defendant in the Planning and Environment Court had no reasonable prospects of success and that any reasonable person properly advised would know, or ought reasonably to have known, that to be so. The defendant had been “put on notice” that the plaintiff would incur loss of 10, 000 for every day there was a delay in starting construction of the resort. The claim made by the developer required the court to consider those circumstances where a person may lawfully and deliberately cause economic harm to another. Was a duty of care owed by the defendant for negligent conduct of litigation that caused economic loss to the plaintiff?...|$|R
