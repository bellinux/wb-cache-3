The changes of technological parameters were analyzed using a proprietary, non-commercial support system for design bevel gears. The effect of the parameter changes were observed in the motion graph of the gear and <b>pinion</b> <b>mesh</b> with ratio 4 : 99.

50|$|In some {{transmission}} designs (Volvo 850 and V/S70 series, for example) {{there are}} actually two countershafts, both driving an output <b>pinion</b> <b>meshing</b> with the front-wheel-drive transaxle's ring gear. This allows the transmission designer to make the transmission narrower, since each countershaft need only be half {{as long as a}} traditional countershaft with four gears and two shifters.|$|R
50|$|The end of {{the piston}} rod is {{connected}} to a built-up crank at {{the centre of the}} crankshaft. The crankshaft has the valve return crank at one end and a flywheel at the other. Also at the flywheel end is a small <b>pinion</b> <b>meshing</b> with a larger gear wheel mounted on a bracket cast in with the engine frame, giving a slightly more than 2:1 speed reduction.

40|$|A {{method for}} {{generation}} of crowned pinion tooth surfaces using a {{surface of revolution}} is developed. The crowned <b>pinion</b> <b>meshes</b> with a regular involute gear and has a prescribed parabolic type of transmission errors when the gears operate in the aligned mode. When the gears are misaligned the transmission error remains parabolic with the maximum level still remaining very small (less than 0. 34 arc second for the numerical examples). Tooth Contact Analysis (TCA) is used to simulate the conditions of meshing, determine the transmission error, and the bearing contact...|$|R
50|$|The steam is fed {{directly}} {{to the back of}} the port face of the oscillating cylinder. The brass cylinder is a single acting oscillating cylinder type. The crank shaft is one of the few steel parts, with a brass disk crank at one end, and mazak flywheel in the centre. (The flywheel is the only painted part of the whole engine). At the other end of the crankshaft is a small <b>pinion</b> <b>meshing</b> with a larger gear wheel mounted on a short shaft in its own bracket, giving a 3:1 speed reduction. The second shaft has a small pulley attached. The simple brass brackets are fixed to the long thin aluminium base plate, which has a rubber foot at each corner.|$|R
25|$|Mounted in this carrier are {{one or more}} {{pairs of}} {{identical}} pinions, generally longer than their diameters, and typically smaller than the spur gears on the individual half-shafts. Each pinion pair rotates freely on pins supported by the carrier. Furthermore, the pinion pairs are displaced axially, such that they mesh only for the part of their length between the two spur gears, and rotate in opposite directions. The remaining length of a given <b>pinion</b> <b>meshes</b> with the nearer spur gear on its axle. Therefore, each pinion couples that spur gear to the other pinion, and in turn, the other spur gear, {{so that when the}} drive shaft rotates the carrier, its relationship to the gears for the individual wheel axles is the same as that in a bevel-gear differential.|$|R
50|$|All modern {{starters}} {{rely on the}} solenoid {{to engage}} the starter drive with the ring gear of the flywheel. When the solenoid is energized, it operates a plunger or lever which forces the <b>pinion</b> into <b>mesh</b> with the ring gear. The pinion incorporates a one way clutch {{so that when the}} engine starts and runs it will not attempt to drive the starter motor at excessive RPM.|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{fatigue tests}} were {{performed}} to determine the surface durability life of a face gear in mesh with a tapered spur involute pinion. Twenty-four sets of gears were tested at three load levels: 7200, 8185, and 9075 lb-in face gear torque, and 2190 to 3280 rpm face gear speed. The gears were carburized and ground, shot-peened and vibro-honed, and made from VIM-VAR Pyrowear 53 steel per AMS 6308. The tests produced 17 gear tooth spalling failures and 7 suspensions. For all the failed sets, spalling occurred {{on at least one}} tooth of all the pinions. In some cases, the spalling initiated a crack in the pinion teeth which progressed to tooth fracture. Also, spalling occurred on some face gear teeth. The AGMA endurance allowable stress for a tapered spur involute <b>pinion</b> in <b>mesh</b> with a face gear was determined to be 275 ksi for the material tested. For the application of a tapered spur involute <b>pinion</b> in <b>mesh</b> with a face gear, proper face gear shim controlled the desired gear tooth contact pattern while proper pinion shim was an effective way of adjusting backlash without severely affecting the contact pattern...|$|R
50|$|A {{rack railway}} (also {{rack-and-pinion}} railway, cog railway, or cogwheel railway) is a steep grade railway with a toothed rack rail, usually between the running rails. The trains are fitted {{with one or}} more cog wheels or <b>pinions</b> that <b>mesh</b> with this rack rail. This allows the trains to operate on steep grades above around 7 to 10%, which is the maximum for friction-based rail. Most rack railways are mountain railways, although a few are transit railways or tramways built to overcome a steep gradient in an urban environment.|$|R
40|$|In gearing {{smoothness}} in {{transmission of}} power depends {{mainly on the}} contact ratio. Contact ratio determines the load shared by the teeth in mesh {{and it will be}} lower when the contact ratio is higher. Therefore in high contact ratio gearing the load transfer from one tooth mesh to another takes place at a lower magnitude of load and the noise produced by this kind of a gearing will be lower. Profile modification in involute tooth gearing helps build properties to the gears in mesh that are uncommon to standard gears and further, it also helps in altering the tooth-sum of a gear pair operating between a specified centre distance and module. It is well known that highest contact ratio is obtained using standard gears is 1. 94 (when a <b>pinion</b> <b>meshes</b> with a rack). Using altered tooth-sum gearing it is possible to achieve contact ratios higher than two. Thus high contact ratio gearing helps bring down the contact stresses and improve durability of gears. This paper presents the methods of using altered Gear is the most widely used machine element whether it is for transmission of motion or for power. They are designed to meet various operating characteristics related to the type of tooth action or for strength requirements. More commonly as they are used for power transmission application i...|$|R
5000|$|In 1962, Chrysler {{introduced}} a starter incorporating a geartrain between the motor and the drive shaft. The motor shaft included integrally cut gear teeth forming a <b>pinion</b> that <b>meshes</b> {{with a larger}} adjacent driven gear to provide a gear reduction ratio of 3.75:1. This permitted {{the use of a}} higher-speed, lower-current, lighter and more compact motor assembly while increasing cranking torque. Variants of this starter design were used on most rear- and four-wheel-drive vehicles produced by Chrysler Corporation from 1962 through 1987. It makes a unique, distinct sound when cranking the engine, which led to it being nicknamed the [...] "Highland Park Hummingbird"—a reference to Chrysler's headquarters in Highland Park, Michigan.|$|R

40|$|In many aeroengines the {{accessory}} power offtake is achieved using a {{spiral bevel gear}} set running {{off one of the}} main shafts. The crown and bevel gears are housed in an internal gearbox and there is significant heat generation within this chamber, some of which is attributed to windage power loss (WPL) generated by the gear. Over the past few years the University of Nottingham Technology Centre (UTC) in Gas Turbine Transmissions has been researching spiral bevel gear windage power loss both computationally and experimentally using a purpose-built test rig at the UTC. In this study the test rig has been adapted such that chamber pressures up to 8 bar can be generated. Test data has been obtained that shows the effect on WPL of chamber pressure, advancing understanding of the relationship between data obtained at ambient and pressurised conditions. Three configurations have been studied: unshrouded gear, gear with 360 shroud and shrouded, crown and <b>pinion</b> <b>meshing</b> pair. Further, the effect of oil mist within the chamber on WPL has been studied. An oil mist generation system was developed for introducing a fine mist into the chamber and results are presented for varying mist flowrates. A mist measurement system was developed to sample mist mass fraction within the chamber and the data obtained is used to calculate an effective (oil/gas mixture) chamber density. Increasing chamber pressure increases Reynolds number, moving the system behavior further along the Moment coefficient-Reynolds number correlation. The Cm-Re correlation is similar in form to that for a shrouded cone, showing transitional behavior around Re= 2 x 106. Beyond transition Cm decreases with increasing Re. Introducing an oil spray has two effects: reduction in chamber temperature and increase in effective density of chamber fluid. Both effects can be accounted for by calculating Re and Cm based on mixture properties but it seems highly likely that the properties of the fluid under the shroud differ from those of the fluid in the external chamber. ...|$|R
50|$|A Spring Starter uses {{potential}} energy {{stored in a}} spring {{wound up with a}} crank to start an engine without a battery or alternator. Turning the crank moves the <b>pinion</b> into <b>mesh</b> with the engine’s ring gear, then winds up the spring. Pulling the release lever then applies the spring tension to the pinion, turning the ring gear to start the engine. The pinion automatically disengages from the flywheel after operation. Provision is also made to allow the engine to be slowly turned over by hand for engine maintenance. This is achieved by operating the trip lever just after the pinion has engaged with the flywheel. Subsequent turning of the winding handle during this operation will not load the starter. Spring starters can be found in engine-generators, hydraulic power packs, and on lifeboat engines, with the most common application being backup starting system on seagoing vessels.|$|R
40|$|Corresponding author Abstract: The {{operation}} of an automobile steering gear is intermittent with low angular velocities and frequent direction reversals. For a typical Rack and Pinion Steering (RPS) gear used in light vehicles, {{the span of}} movement of the rack is limited to approximately four rotations of the pinion. For this limited span of rack travel, the torque required to rotate the pinion is tested for satisfactory functioning of the steering gear. The torque variation due to engagement and disengagement of the <b>pinion</b> teeth, <b>mesh</b> friction variation, and spring force that keeps the gears in mesh, etc., are obtained from the virtual prototype developed in Automatic Dynamic Analysis of Mechanical Systems (ADAMS) software, where, the manufacturing errors are also incorporated. Comparisons of {{the results from the}} virtual prototype with those from laboratory tests validate the correctness of the proposed prototype in ADAMS. This prototype lends itself for the implementation of improvement concepts and performance testing...|$|R
40|$|In this work, a Geared Infinitely Variable Transmission (GIVT) {{which uses}} gears to {{transfer}} torque rather than frictional components is detailed. A comparison {{is made to}} existing continuously variable and infinitely variable transmission technology and a description of function in past and present GIVT designs is presented. The new GIVT features non-circular gearing and a scotch yoke mechanism to achieve zero speed fluctuation and avoid losses due to torque recirculation.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the {{modification of the}} existing motor screw jack by incorporating an electric motor in the screw {{in order to make}} load lifting easier. In this modified design, the power screw is rotated through its connecting gear with the pinion gear when electrical power flows through the cigarette lighter receptacle connected to the motor, plugged to the automobile 12 V battery source to generate power for the prime mover (motor), which transmits its rotating speed to the <b>pinion</b> gear <b>meshing</b> with the bigger gear connected to the power screw to be rotated with required speed reduction and increased torque to drive the power screw.

30|$|Eight mesh periods (see Figure  4) are {{analyzed}} in Table  2 because only the mesh stiffness of these eight mesh periods {{may be affected}} in our model during one revolution of the <b>pinion.</b> One <b>mesh</b> period is defined as an angular displacement of the pinion experiencing a double-tooth-pair meshing duration and a single-tooth-pair meshing duration. For double-tooth-pair meshing durations, 4, 6 and 8 mesh periods have mesh stiffness reduction caused by slight pitting, moderate pitting and severe pitting, respectively. The maximum averaged mesh stiffness reduction in a double-tooth-pair meshing duration is 1.57 %, 4.26 % and 19.02 % corresponding to slight pitting, moderate pitting and severe pitting, respectively. While for single-tooth-pair meshing durations, 3, 5 and 7 mesh periods experience mesh stiffness reduction corresponding to slight pitting, moderate pitting and severe pitting, respectively. The maximum averaged mesh stiffness reduction in a single-tooth-pair meshing duration is 11.61 %, 55.33 % and 55.83 % related to slight pitting, moderate pitting and severe pitting, respectively. For each mesh period, the stiffness reduction in the single-tooth-pair meshing duration is larger than that in the double-tooth-pair meshing duration for two reasons: (a) the pitting mostly appear around the pitch line and the pitch line lies on the single-tooth-pair meshing duration, and (b) the perfect gear has a smaller averaged mesh stiffness in the single-tooth-pair meshing duration than the double-tooth-pair meshing duration. In the following section, the pitting effect on the vibration properties of a spur gearbox will be investigated.|$|R

50|$|In 1812 the Middleton Railway {{became the}} first {{commercial}} railway to use steam locomotives successfully. John Blenkinsop, the colliery's viewer, or manager, had decided that an engine light enough not to break the cast iron track would not have sufficient adhesion, bearing in mind the heavy load of coal wagons and the steep track gradient. Accordingly, he relaid the track on one side with a toothed rail, which he patented in 1811 (the first rack railway), and approached Matthew Murray of Fenton, Murray and Wood, in Holbeck, to design a locomotive with a <b>pinion</b> which would <b>mesh</b> with it. Murray's design was based on Richard Trevithick's Catch me who can, adapted to use Blenkinsop's rack and pinion system, and probably was called Salamanca. This 1812 locomotive {{was the first to}} use two cylinders. These drove the pinions through cranks which were at right angles, so that the engine would start wherever it came to rest.|$|R
