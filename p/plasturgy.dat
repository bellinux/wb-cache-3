40|$|Wood polymer {{composites}} (WPC) have well proven their applicability {{in several}} {{fields of the}} <b>plasturgy</b> sector, due to their aesthetics and low maintenance costs. However, for <b>plasturgy</b> applications, the characterization of viscoelastic behavior and thermomechanical and thermophysical properties of WPC with the temperature and wood filler contents is essential. Therefore, the processability of polymer composites made up with different percentage of wood particles needs {{a better understanding of}} materials behaviors in accordance with temperature and wood particles contents. To this end, a numerical analysis of the viscoelastic, mechanical, and thermophysical properties of composite composed of high density polyethylene (HDPE) reinforced with soft wood particles is evaluated...|$|E
