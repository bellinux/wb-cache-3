40|$|During {{the years}} 1988 - 1992 an {{outbreak}} of the <b>pale</b> <b>tussock</b> <b>moth,</b> Calliteara pudibunda (L.), took place in northwest Italy (Pied-mont and Liguria) in different sites of beech and mixed broadleaf woods in the western Alps, from 700 to 1, 300 m of height. This outstanding outbreak (the first recorded below the 48 th parallel) was monitored during 1990 - 1993, checking pupal densities and rearing parasitoids. In pupae, ichneumonids reached a maximum parasitization rate of 34 % and tachinids accounted for up to 19 %, whereas in larvae a rather low parasitization rate was equally divided between Diptera (Tachinidae) and Hymenoptera (Ich-neumonidae, Braconidae, Eulophidae). Two cases of hyperparasitization were found of the ichneumonid Goedartia alboguttata (Gravenhorst) by Euceros kiushuensis Uchida in the beechwood of Calizzano in Liguria. Very few cases of oophagous parasitiza-tion by Trichogramma spp. could be detected. Insect, bird and mammal predators were rather ineffective {{on the number of}} larvae, pupae and adults of the <b>pale</b> <b>tussock</b> <b>moth.</b> Viral, microbial and fungal agents of larval and pupal mortality were determined. The end of the outbreak was caused by cytoplasmic and nuclear polyhedroses, at least in three of the four investigated areas. The pres-ence of the <b>pale</b> <b>tussock</b> <b>moth</b> in the following years was limited to few larvae seen sporadically in the forests and no pupae could be found...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1977 An {{outbreak}} of the Douglas-fir <b>tussock</b> <b>moth</b> caused severe defoliation in northeastern Oregon {{during the period from}} 1972 to 1974. Aerial application of DOT was used to control the outbreak in 1974. Much of the infected area has been logged to salvage the dead and damaged timber. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the economic impact of the Douglas-fir <b>tussock</b> <b>moth,</b> the control program and the salvage logging on private recreation businesses in the area of the <b>tussock</b> <b>moth</b> damage. Personal interviews and mailed questionnaires were used to obtain data from the operators of the businesses. Linear regression analysis was done using gross income data from before, during and after the <b>tussock</b> <b>moth</b> infestation to determine if there was a statistical relationship between changes in gross income and the presence of the <b>tussock</b> <b>moth.</b> Business trends in the area affected by the <b>tussock</b> <b>moth</b> were also compared with state park visitation and motel occupancy in all of Oregon. The operators of businesses were questioned about possible reasons for changes in business volume, changes in normal operations as a result of the <b>tussock</b> <b>moth</b> infestation, and visitors actions during the period. Although there was a decrease in business volume during the <b>tussock</b> <b>moth</b> problem there was no evidence to indicate the <b>tussock</b> <b>moth</b> had any appreciable effect on overall business volume or operations in the study area...|$|R
40|$|What is the Douglas-fir <b>tussock</b> <b>moth</b> virus? Wild {{populations of}} the Douglas-fir <b>tussock</b> <b>moth</b> have several naturally-occurring {{diseases}} that cause mortality to certain life stages of the insect {{during the course of}} an outbreak. The agents that cause these diseases are bacteria, fungi, and viruses, among others. Research during the 1960 's to mid- 1980 's, mostly by U. S. Forest Service scientists, determined that a nucleopolyhedrosis virus, or NPV for short, (family Baculoviridae; genus Baculovirus Subgroup A), caused considerable mortality of <b>tussock</b> <b>moth</b> larvae during the later stages of <b>tussock</b> <b>moth</b> outbreaks (3 rd and 4 th year of an outbreak), and was largely responsible for natural collapse of many of the <b>tussock</b> <b>moth</b> outbreaks that occurred in western North America. Scientists at the Pacific Northwest Research Station at Corvallis, Oregon began investigations with the <b>tussock</b> <b>moth</b> NPV during an accelerated research program to bring on line, new technologies to manage <b>tussock</b> <b>moth</b> populations after a Douglas-fir <b>tussock</b> <b>moth</b> outbreak that was occurring in large areas of eastern Washington, northeastern Oregon, and parts of Idaho during the period 1971 - 1974 was treated with DDT under special approval by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency. Laboratory and field research on virus efficacy agains...|$|R
