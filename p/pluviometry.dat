The charts and analysis show that during the last century, the north west of Algeria show an alternation of dry and humid periods. We have used several methods to study the non-stationarity and trend in the series of studied stations. The results show generally upward trend covering the Thirties and the Fifties. The <b>pluviometry</b> fall was observed during the beginning of the Forties and the middle of the Seventies. The reduction of <b>pluviometry</b> exceeds 36 % in the Mascara region and in the extreme west. On the other hand, the decrease of rainfall is about 20 % in the centre of Algeria.

40|$|SummaryDengue {{continues}} {{to be the most important}} viral vector-borne disease in the world, particularly in Asia and Latin America, and is significantly affected by climate variability. The influence of climate in an endemic region of Colombia, from 2010 to 2011, was assessed. Epidemiological surveillance data (weekly cases) were collected, and incidence rates were calculated. Poisson regression models were used to assess the influence of the macroclimatic variable ONI (Oscillation Niño Index) and the microclimatic variable <b>pluviometry</b> (mm of rain for Risaralda) on the dengue incidence rate, adjusting by year and week. During the study period, 13, 650 cases were reported. In 2010, the rates ranged from 8. 6 cases/ 100, 000 pop. up to a peak of 75. 3 cases/ 100, 000 pop. for a cumulative rate of 456. 2 cases/ 100, 000 pop. in that week. The climate variability in 2010 was higher (ONI 1. 6, El Niño to − 1. 5, La Niña) than in 2011 (ONI − 1. 4, La Niña to − 0. 2, Neutral). The mean <b>pluviometry</b> was 248. 45 mm (min 135. 9 –max 432. 84). During El Niño, cases were significantly higher (mean 433. 81) than during the climate neutral period (142. 48) and during the La Niña (52. 80) phases (ANOVA F= 66. 59; p< 0. 001). Regression models showed that the ONI (coefficient 0. 329; 95 %CI 0. 209 – 0. 450) and <b>pluviometry</b> (coefficient 0. 003; 95 %CI 0. 002 – 0. 004) were highly significant independent variables associated with dengue incidence rate, after adjusting by year and week (p< 0. 001, pseudo r 2 = 0. 6913). El Niño significantly affected the incidence of dengue in Risaralda. This association with climate change and variability should be considered in the elements influencing disease epidemiology. In addition, predictive models should be developed further with more available data from disease surveillance...|$|E

Then, we apply the model to source control regulations, assessing which type of regulation is more effective depending on relative positions in a catchment.

In this letter, we explore the application of multiscale/multifractal techniques in the design of new methods for the assessment and tracking of <b>pluviometry.</b> We first identify the main streamlines by a singularity analysis of the wavelet projections of the IR record. From the streamlines, we derive a proxy scalar image that represents the result of pure horizontal advection. From the comparison of original and proxy we localize the places at which horizontal advection fails, which we identify with convection places.

40|$|International audienceA {{geographic}} information system (GIS) was developed in Martinique, to perform soil zoning for {{the revival of the}} production of Coffea arabica var. typica. Pioneer in the cultivation of coffee in the Caribbean since 1720, today Martinique plays no role in the coffee industry. In addition, due to its rarity on the island, the edapho-climatic requirements of Coffea arabica had to be defined based on the world literature. The digital data (isohyets, isotherm, geomorphology) was obtained from Martinique’s institutions with expertise in the production of environmental data (IRD, IGN, Météo- France, DEAL Martinique, CTM) 1. These data have been processed with a SIG software: QGIS version 2. 8. 1. During the investigations, the rainfall represented a factor limiting any possibility of production of Coffea arabica var. typica in the future.

Eutrophication has long been considered {{the main cause of}} cyanobacteria outbreak and proliferation, whereas many studies emphasized the effect of abiotic parameters (mainly temperature and light) on cell growth rate or toxin production. In view of the growing concerns of global change consequences on public health parameters, this study attempts to enlighten climate influence on cyanobacteria at regional scale in Brittany (NW France). The results show that homogeneous cyanobacteria groups are associated with climatic domains related to temperature, global radiation and <b>pluviometry,</b> whereas microcystins (MCs) occurrences are only correlated to local cyanobacteria species composition. As the regional climatic gradient amplitude is similar to the projected climate evolution on a 30 -year timespan, a comparison between the present NW and SE situations was used to extrapolate the evolution of geographical cyanobacteria distribution in Brittany. Cyanobacteria composition should shift toward species associated with more frequent Microcystins occurrences along a NW/SE axis whereas lakes situated along a SW/NE axis should transition to species (mainly Nostocales) associated with lower MCs detection frequencies...|$|E

The region comprises two contrasting basins with different water sources, a glacier-fed basin and a precipitation-fed basin. Monitoring encompasses annual measures of physico-chemistry of the waters along with samples of macroinvertebrates in midsummer. Monitoring was initiated in 2001 when the area was annexed to the park. Preliminary results indicate the high sensitivity of alpine waters and biota to changes in climate. Results from the stream measures suggest a shift in physico-chemistry (warmer waters, decreases in nitrogen constituents) and zoobenthos (taxa and density decreases) over time that reflected the differences and changes in water source in each basin. Results from the pond monitoring showed the rapid response of these small water bodies to alterations in air temperature and <b>pluviometry.</b> The pond data also demonstrated a strong spatial heterogeneity between ponds in both physico-chemistry and macroinvertebrate composition.

The methodology used was LANDSAT 5 multitemporal images, TM sensor, for 1988, 1997 and 2008 years, with a SPRING (INPE 2010) classification according to vegetation presence, in addition to pluviometric data from 2003 to 2004 years showing low and high <b>pluviometry,</b> respectively. In the image classification a Bhattacharya classificator was used to distinguish the vegetation according to the composition of the surface material. It was evidenced an evolution in vegetation cover losses, based on the correlation between vegetation presence and anthropism. We can conclude that the use of remote sensing in upland forest analysis is also an important tool to study exception environments, as they show differentiated climatic features from semi-arid surroundings that make these environments susceptible to human exploration and occupation.

Gabon constitutes {{an important part of the}} range of western central African great ape subspecies (Pan troglodytes troglodytes and Gorilla gorilla gorilla), but has not been studied so far. In the present study, the diversity of Plasmodium species circulating in great apes in Gabon was analysed. Methods: The analysis of 1, 261 faecal samples from 791 chimpanzees and 470 gorillas collected from 24 sites all over Gabon was performed. Plasmodium infections were characterized by amplification and sequencing of a portion of the Plasmodium cytochrome b gene. Results: The analysis of the 1, 261 samples revealed that at least six Plasmodium species circulate in great apes in Gabon (Plasmodium praefalciparum, Plasmodium gorA (syn Plasmodium adleri), Plasmodium gorB (syn Plasmodium blacklocki) in gorillas and Plasmodium gaboni, P. reichenowi and Plasmodium billcollinsi in chimpanzees). No new phylogenetic lineages were discovered. The average infection rate was 21. 3 % for gorillas and 15. 4 % for chimpanzees.

Indeed, our result show that seeds of the four varieties have important oil content ranged between 35. 38 % (Rancho) and 28. 84 % (Cartamar). Characterization of these oils showed a low value of acidity index less than 0. 7 % for all the varieties but significant differences in their peroxide values ranged between 4. 5 meq O 2 /Kg (Cartamar) and 31. 21 mEqO 2 /Kg (Rancho) and high value of phenolic content between 143 ppm (Rancho) and 97 ppm (Sharda). Analysis of the fatty acids shows that linoleic acid is the main fatty acid ranged between 77. 94 % (Cartamar) and 79. 98 % (Sharda). Oils of those four varieties can be classified in the linoleic acid group. The analysis of triglycerides by HPLC shows 10 molecular species of TAG (LLL, LPL, LLO, PLO, LLS, POP, OOO, POO, SOO, PPL).

Although both wastes display high contents of carbonate minerals associated to the metal bearing phases, their composition is different, calcite for Bentaillou and siderite for Saint-Salvy allowing different minerals transformations and drainage mining water compositions. Due to different impoundment type, dumps for Bentaillou and a dam for Saint-Salvy, oxidation reactions are favoured in the former compared to the latter. Waste drainage waters generated in situ display lower pH, Eh and higher Fe and heavy metals in drainage waters from Saint-Salvy compared to those from Bentaillou. The leaching experiments lasted 62 days and 84 days for Bentaillou sample and Saint-Salvy sample respectively corresponding to an equivalent time of 288 and 183 years respectively calculated from <b>pluviometry</b> in situ. During the experiment, the amounts of elements released was higher for Saint-Salvy sample (0. 2 % of Zn, and Pb and 1, 4 % of Cd) than for the Bentaillou one (9. 7 % of Zn, and 0. 15 % of Pb and 46 % of Cd). The comparison of experimental leaching results with site data on waste drainage waters demonstrated the validity of laboratory results under oxidic conditions at Bentaillou while the duration experimentally estimated for total sulphide oxidation overestimates the time calculated from the sulfate flow in field drainage waters under reducing conditions at Saint-Salv...|$|E
40|$|In the City of Annaba, {{respiratory}} {{diseases are}} important causes of consultation and hospitalization. To {{contribute to the}} development of the research as for the biological and environmental pollution, it seemed to us essential to establish a pollen calendar of the city of Annaba. The objective of this study is to know the variability of its allergenic pollen component. The pollen calendar offers a preventive therapeutic utility because it supplies the critical dates of the pollination so allowing knowing the periods about high allergenic risks. For this study, we chose a gravimetric method, using the pollen sensor of Durham. The results we obtained have revealed the existence of pollen from trees or grasses, their monthly average as well as various pollen peaks where these are plentiful in the air of Annaba. The elaboration of the average pollen calendar allowed us to distinguish the seasons in the course of which the allergenic pollen component is plentiful in the air as well as its duration of appearance, periods in the course of which the allergenic symptoms are the most important. The knowledge of the pollen seasons is necessary. It allows us to prevent the appearance of the likely allergic symptoms when the pollen concentration of the air is intense. It is necessary to act as first aids to the public. Thanks to this knowledge the more precise planning of the rhythm of the desensitization of the allergic individuals is possible and easier. We determined the monthly behavior of main allergenic pollens, which we confronted with the weather conditions (<b>pluviometry,</b> temperature and humidity averages). The objective is to manage with this work to make forecasts of the appearance of the pollen rains when the weather conditions are similar. This revealed us that the weather conditions act on the presence of the pollen and its abundance in the air...|$|E
40|$|Speleothems {{are widely}} used to provide {{paleoclimate}} information. Indeed, inorganic proxies, notably 18 O, {{are the most common}} tools used to evaluate climate variations during past periods. However, recent studies currently develop the use of organic proxies due to the high potential information provided by organic matter such as vegetation cover variations, organic matter fluxes, landuse modifications, changes in precipitation and in the system hydrology. These proxies enable a paleoenvironmental reconstruction which can be coupled to paleoclimatic signal in order to better interpret inorganic proxies. The development of geochemical technics allows nowadays the analyses of elements ordinary used in sediments or soils cores studies. Indeed, numerous biomarkers as lipids have shown interesting results. However, these analyses generally require high amounts of material that implies a lower resolution. The fluorescence of organic matter represents a non-destructive proxy. Fluorescent lamina in speleothems have been widely used as a chronological tool or as a complementary information on paleoclimate. Fluorescent organic matter trapped in speleothems is mainly coming from soils. Modifications of the fluorescence signal represent modifications of organic matter fluxes, and so reflect soils dynamics above the cavity. Few studies used fluorescence as paleoenvironmental proxy to differentiate vegetation regimes or correlate with surface wetness and precipitation. Here, we used a fluorescence induced by laser excitation to obtain the organic matter fluorescence signal of two Holocene stalagmites of the Bauges massif, in the French western Prealps. These mountain environments are particularly sensitive to climatic changes and are marked by important modifications of environment as clearing, deforestation, or agricultural practices during this period. Two lasers with an excitation wavelength of 266 and 325 nm were used in order to record humic and proteic domains of fluorescence. The particularity of this analysis is the decomposition of the fluorescence signal in different fluorophores which enables the distinction between the different types of organic matter joining the system. Coupling data on organic matter quantity and quality provides precisions on organic matter fluxes and sources. They are influenced by <b>pluviometry,</b> soils saturation, soils type, vegetation cover themselves controlled by climatic forcing and anthropic impacts. These results were correlated with other organic and inorganic proxies as 13 C and trace elements signal to assess soil dynamics variations in mountain environment...|$|E

40|$|The {{proposed}} methodology {{is based}} on the developments of five significant points. These developments were necessary in order to give a balanced diagnosis. They represent however only one stage towards a better comprehension of the arising problem. The methodology is thus imagined to evolve with future scientific progress. These developments were made in the following fields : the positioning of the debris flow phenomenon among the other mass movements makes it possible to define it, in a univocal way, like "a lubricated granular flow, kinematically monophasic on a macroscopic scale" (chap. 2); the possibilities of connection between the <b>pluviometry</b> and the triggerring of debris flows were evaluated. This chapter analyses the difficulties of measurements of the rain in a mountainous area. These difficulties make possible to fix the degree of confidence to be given to the presented models (chap. 3); intuitively, there is a link between the debris flows and their catchment area. The relatively easy determination of the in situ characteristics (topography, geomorphology, geology) makes of this link a useful tool to estimate the danger. The presented works show the importance of surface, slope, geology, etc. to forecast which is the dominating phenomenon, volume, etc. (chap. 4); the release of the debris flows is primarily due to two mechanisms (erosion and fluidification of a sliding mass), which can appear according to several modalities. The knowledge of these mechanisms makes possible to delimit potential zones of release, on which the investigations will be concentrated (chap 5); to reflect field's observations, it is necessary to distinguish three families of debris flows. Each one has a proper constitutive's law. It is thus significant to distinguish between these families to be able to choose the appropriate propagation's model. Tools based on rheometrical tests are given to allow this choice (chap. 6). On the basis of this knowledge's body, it is possible to give a methodology {{in order to make a}} diagnosis of an alpine catchment area. This diagnosis is broken down into four stages. First of all the preliminary diagnosis aims to provide the minimum elements necessary for a coarse estimate of the danger. The three other stages can be made more or less in parallel and constitute the diagnosis itself. This diagnosis does not deal with propagation, but has to provide all the elements necessary to the models which will be used thereafter. Figure 7 - 5 summarizes this diagnosis...|$|E
40|$|Introduction In Chile three {{geographic}} zones can {{be distinguished}} from north to south. The north zone has a desert climate and extremely low rainfall, the central zone has dry summers and cold-rainy winters, characteristic of Mediterranean climate, and south zone with low temperatures and high <b>pluviometry.</b> This climatic variation has allowed the development of agriculture with a great diversity of species and cultivates. Chile has natural phytosanitary barriers with, the Pacific Ocean (West), the Andes Mountains (East), the Atacama desert (North) and the Antarctic continent (South). These natural barriers have prevented the introduction of important pest and diseases, allowing to Chile develop a fruit crop industry for exports to Asia, Europe and the USA Nevertheless, the international trade and tourism have increased in Chile, reducing the effectiveness of natural phytosanitary barriers. The target market of Chilean fresh fruits have demonstrated to be highly demanding therefore is essential to send quality fruit, considering required standards in each market. lmporting countries have strict regulation concerning pesticide residues on the fruits which are impeding the overuse of chemical control against pests and diseases. These regulations have increased the risk of rejection of the merchandise at the ports of entrance if current regulations are not fulfilled (Coscolla, 1993). The Chilean fresh fruit is a mature industry, which generates economic resources for the country, contributing with 42. 7 % of Gross Domestic Product (GDB) generated for agricultura! forestry sector. Also, Chile is considered a leader of South Hemisphere in terms of export of fresh fruit in counter season with about a 50 % of the out off season fresh fruit markets worldwide. This situation has been sustained in the time {{and there is a}} high probability to continue expanding to others countries. The main challenge for the fruit sector is to maintain competitiveness, it is vulnerable to the effect of adverse weather conditions, distance to destination countries, the exchange rate, and international economy, among others factors. Maintaining an optimum phytosanitary standard is essential to maintain and increase the participation of the Chilean fruit internationally. Therefore, the objective of this Master's Thesis was to characterize three phytopathogenic fungi, Pestalotiopsis spp. and Monilinia fructicola than are associated with post-harvest disease, and Phytophthora spp. affecting the Roble de Santiago (Nothofagus macrocarpa) which is an endemic tree species with potential as ornamental plant.

40|$|In the {{framework}} of the IDAF (IGAC/DEBITS/AFrica) international program, this study aims to study the chemical composition of precipitation and associated wet deposition at the rural site of Djougou in Benin, representative of a West and Central African wet savanna. Five hundred and thirty rainfall samples were collected at Djougou, Benin, from July 2005 to December 2009 to provide a unique database. The chemical composition of precipitation was analyzed for inorganic (Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, Na+, NH 4 +, K+, NO 3 -, Cl-, SO) and organic (HCOO-, CH 3 COO-, C 2 H 5 COO-, C 2 O 42 -) ions, using ion chromatography. The 530 collected rain events represent a total of 5706. 1 mm of rainfall compared to the measured <b>pluviometry</b> 6138. 9 mm, indicating that the collection efficiency is about 93 %. The order of total annual loading rates for soluble cations is NH 4 + > Ca 2 + > Mg 2 + > K+. For soluble anions the order of loading is carbonates > HCOO- > NO 3 - > CH 3 COO- > SO 42 - > Cl- > C 2 O 42 - > C 2 H 5 COO-. In the wet savanna of Djougou, 86 % of the measured pH values range between 4. 7 and 5. 7 with a median pH of 5. 19, corresponding to a VWM (Volume Weighed Mean) H+ concentration of 6. 46 mu eq. L- 1. This acidity results from a mixture of mineral and organic acids. The annual sea salt contribution was computed for K+, Mg 2 +, Ca 2 + and SO 42 - and represents 4. 2 % of K+, 41 % of Mg 2 +, 1. 3 % of Ca 2 +, and 7. 4 % of SO 42 -. These results show that K+, Ca 2 +, SO 42 -, and Mg 2 + were mainly of non-marine origin. The marine contribution is estimated at 9 %. The results of the chemical composition of rainwater of Djougou indicates that, except for the carbonates, ammonium has the highest VWM concentration (143 mu eq. L- 1) and nitrate concentration is 8. 2 mu eq. L- 1. The distribution of monthly VWM concentration for all ions is computed and shows the highest values during the dry season, comparing to the wet season. Identified nitrogenous compound sources (NOx and NH 3) are domestic animals, natural emissions from savanna soils, biomass burning and biofuel combustions. The second highest contribution is the calcium ion (133 mu eq. L- 1), characteristic of dust aerosols from terrigenous sources, Calcium contributes up to 46 % of the precipitation chemistry in Djougou. Finally, these results are compared to those obtained for other selected African sites representative of other main natural ecosystems: dry savanna and forest. The study of the African ecosystem transect indicates a pH gradient with more acidic pH in the forested ecosystem. Nitrogenous contribution to the chemical composition of rain in Lamto, wet savanna, (24 %) is equivalent to the one estimated in Djougou (24 %). The last contribution concerns organic acidity, which represents 7 % of total ionic content of precipitation at Djougou. The relative particulate contribution PC and the relative gaseous contribution GC are calculated using the mean chemical composition measured in Djougou for the studied period. The comparison with other African sites gives 40 % and 43 % PC in wet savannas of Lamto (Cote d'Ivoire) and Djougou (Benin) respectively, 20 % PC in the equatorial forest of Zoetele (Cameroon) and 80 % PC in dry savanna of Banizoumbou (Niger). The results shown here indicate the existence of a North-South gradients of organic, marine, terrigenous and nitrogenous contributions along the transect in West and Central Africa...|$|E

Countries with economies based on agriculture generate vast amounts of low or null value wastes which may even represent an environmental hazard. In our group, agricultural industrial wastes have been converted into value added liquid substances and materials with several aims: decreasing pollution, giving added value to wastes and working in a sustainable manner in which the wastes of an industry can be used as the raw materials of the same or others, as the “cradle to cradle” philosophy states [1]. Sub-products from the agricultural food industry are being employed as renewable low cost raw materials in the preparation of Ecomaterials, designed for use in a number of industrial processes of great interest. Given their origin, these materials may compete with conventional ones since with this process a sustainable cycle is closed, in which the residues of one industry are used as raw materials in the same or other industries [2]. With regards to the composition of the residues produced from agriculture, the pH of soil is of great importance, since plants can only absorb the minerals that are dissolved in water and pH is mandatory for the physical, chemical and biological properties of soil and the main cause of many agronomic questions related to nutrient assimilation [3 - 5]. Variations of pH modify the solubility of most elements necessary for the development of crops and also influence the microbian activity of soil, which will affect the transformation of elements that are liberated to the soil and can be assimilated to form crops or not [3]. For example at pH lower than 6 or higher than 8 bacterian activities are lowered, the oxidation of nitrogen to nitrate is reduced and the amount of nitrogen available for plant food is decreased. However Al, Fe and manganese are more soluble at low pHs, reaching even toxic concentrations. Potassium and sulphur are easily adsorbed at pH higher than 6, calcium and magnesium between 7 and 8. 5 and iron at pH lower than 6. For alkaline pH in soil, the availability of H 2 PO 4 -can be reduced through precipitation of phosphorous containing salts withcations such as calcium Ca 2 + or magnesium Mg 2 +. However when soils have acid pH other compounds with HPO 42 -and iron (Fe 2 +), aluminium (Al 3 +) and manganese (Mn 2 +) can form, with increased solubility. The main factors that influence soil pH are the mineral composition and how it meteorizes, the decomposition of organic matter, how nutrients are partitioned among the solution and aggregates and of course the pluviometryof the zone and atmospheric contamination. Lower pHs are found in places with high <b>pluviometry,</b> with high organic matter decomposition, young soils developed on acid substrates, and places with high atmospheric contamination (acid rain). Depending on the species, crops can benefit from calcareous soils with high calcium carbonate content such as alfalfa, but other plants prefer soils with acid pH such as potatoes, coffee or tobacco. It is clear that different seasons will produce plants with a varying composition depending on the atmospheric conditions and therefore the materials derived from them need to be characterised and analysed to determine their possible uses. Given its multidisciplinary approach, this work is being carried out through the collaboration among national (Institute of Materials Science of Madrid (ICMM, CSIC), Institute of Catalysis (ICP, CSIC), Centre of Molecular Biology Severo Ochoa (UAM-CSIC), Polytechnic University of Madrid (UPM), University at distance (UNED), University Complutense of Madrid (UPM) and international (University of Sheffield and University of Ghent) research groups, in addition to various industries interested in the transformation of their residues and or sub-products into “value added materials”, with whom various research projects have been and are being sponsored by the MICINN and CDTI.

40|$|Introductionin current {{situation}} when world is facing massive population, producing enough food and adequate income for {{people is a}} big challenge specifically for governors. This challenge gets even harder in recent decades, due to global population growth which was projected to increase to 7. 8 billion in 2025. Agriculture as the only industry that has ability to produce food is consuming 90 percent of fresh water globally. Despite of increasing for food demand, appropriate agricultural land and fresh water resources are restricted. To solve this problem, one is to increase water productivity which can be obtain by irrigation. Iran is not only exempted from this situation but also has more critical situation due to its dry climate and inappropriate precipitation distribution spatially and temporally, also uneven distribution of population which is concentrate in small area. The only reasonable solution by considering water resources limitation and also restricted crop area is changing crop pattern to reach maximum or at least same amount of income by using same or less amount of water. The {{purpose of this study}} is to assess financial water productivity and optimize farmer’s income by changing in each crop acreage at basin and sub-basin level with no extra groundwater withdrawals, also in order to repair the damages which has enforce to groundwater resources during last decades a scenario of using only 80 percent of renewable water were applied and crop area were optimize to provide maximum or same income for farmers. Materials and methodsThe Neyshabour basin is located in northeast of Iran, the total geographical area of basin is 73, 000 km 2 consisting of 41, 000 km 2 plain and the rest of basin is mountains. This Basin is a part of Kalshoor catchment that is located in southern part of Binaloud heights and northeast of KavirMarkazi. In this study whole Neyshabour basin were divided into 199 sub-basins based on pervious study. Based on official reports, agriculture consumes around 93. 5 percent of the groundwater withdrawals in Neyshabour basin and mostly in irrigation fields, surface water resources share in total water resource withdrawals is about 4. 2 percent, which means that groundwater is a primary source of fresh water for different purposes and surface water has a minor role in providing water supply services in the Neyshabour basin. To determine crop cultivation area, major crops divided into two groups. two winter crops (Wheat and Barley) and two summer crops (Maize and Tomato). To accomplish land classification by using supervised method, a training area is needed, so different farms for each crop were chosen by consulting with official agricultural organization expert and multiple point read on GPS for each crop. The maximum likelihood (MLC) method was selected for the land cover classification. To estimate the amount of precipitation at each 199 sub-basins, 13 station data for precipitation were collected, these stations are including 11 <b>pluviometry</b> stations, one climatology station and one synoptic station. Actual evapotranspiration (ETa) is needed to estimate actual yield (Ya). Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) technique were applied on Landsat 8 OLI images. To calculate actual ETa, the following steps in flowchart were modeled as tool in ArcGIS 10. 3 and a spreadsheet file. To estimate actual crop yield, the suggested procedure by FAO- 33 and FAO- 66 were followed. Financial productivity could be defined in differently according to interest. In this study several of these definition was used. These definitions are Income productivity (IP) and Profit productivity (PP). To optimize crop area, linear programing technique were used. Results and discussionaverage actual evapotranspiration result for each sub-basin are shown in context. In some sub-basins which there were no evapotranspiration are shown in white. And it happens in those sub-basins which assigned as desert in land classification. In figures 8 and 9 minimum amount of income and profit productivity for wheat and barley is negative, this number means in those area the value of precipitation is higher than value of evapotranspiration, so lower part of eq. 21 and 22 would be negative and in result water productivity would be negative. Since most of precipitation occurs during cold season of the year these numbers are expected. Two sub-basins of 43 and 82 has the value of negative, it means in these two sub-basins groundwater are recharging during the year 2014 - 2015. The maximum value of income and profit productivity belong to wheat and barley which are winter crops and mostly rain fed, so amount applied water would be so low and in result productivity increased. Among the summer crops maize has the most income and profit income which can be interpret due to their growing period and the crop types. Maize has around 110 days to reach to maturity and harvest, on the other hand tomato needs 145 days to harvest. Some plant is C 3 and some are C 4. C 4 plants produce more biomass than C 3 crops with same amount of water which leads to more productivity. The results showed that tomato should have the most changes in area reduction (0. 2) and maize should have no changes in both scenarios. Crop area should reduce to 66 percent of current cultivation area to maintain ground water level and only 6 percent reduction in cultivation area would result in 20 percent groundwater recharging. Conclusion to save groundwater resources or even retrieve the only water resource, cultivation area must reduce if the crop pattern will not change. In this study only four crops were studied. It seems best solution is to introduce alternative crop...|$|E
