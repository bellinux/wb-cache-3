25|$|From the mid-1930s onwards the ILP also {{attracted}} the attention of the Trotskyist movement with various Trotskyist groups working within it, such as the Marxist Group of which CLR James, Denzil Dean Harber and Ted Grant were members. This was in addition to the presence within the party of a group of members sympathetic to the CPGB, the Revolutionary Policy Committee, who eventually left to join that party. From the late 1930s, the party had the support of several key figures in the tiny <b>Pan-Africanist</b> <b>movement</b> in Britain, including George Padmore and Chris Braithwaite, as well as left-wing writers such as George Orwell, Reginald Reynolds and Ethel Mannin.|$|E
25|$|The {{efforts and}} fervor of the {{erstwhile}} Anti-colonial {{leader of the}} Dervish state of Somalia, who {{by the time of}} his death had reclaimed and united large swathes of the lands historically territorial to the Somali peoples, to this day inspires and mobilizes the autochthonous peoples of Somalia to form a consolidated bulwark against imperialism (namely that of Ethiopia) as captured in the struggles of the Islamic Courts Union, the Ogaden National Liberation Front, and the former Western Somali Liberation Front. Hassan has thus become more than just a token of pride for the various sectional groups in Somalia, but has also been seen by some as icon of Pan-Somalism, at times even distinguished as one of the great revolutionaries of the turn of the 20th century by notable Pan-Africanist movements, who led the Senussid resistance against the Italians. Hassan's reputation thus transcends the very borders he sought to liberate from foreign rule and domination, the very essence of the <b>Pan-Africanist</b> <b>movement.</b>|$|E
500|$|Simon Gikandi {{argued that}} Kenyatta, like {{a number of}} his contemporaries in the Pan-African movement, was an [...] "Afro-Victorian", someone whose {{identity}} had been shaped [...] "by the culture of colonialism and colonial institutions", especially those of the Victorian era. During the 1920s and 1930s, Kenyatta cultivate the image of a [...] "colonial gentleman"; in England, he displayed [...] "pleasant manners" [...] and a flexible attitude in adapting to urban situations dissimilar to the lands he had grown up in. A. R. Barlow, a member of the Church of Scotland Mission at Kikuyu, met with Kenyatta in Britain, later relating that he was impressed by how Kenyatta could [...] "mix on equal terms with Europeans and to hold his end up in spite of his handicaps, educationally and socially." [...] The South African Peter Abrahams met Kenyatta in London, noting that of all the black men involved in the city's <b>Pan-Africanist</b> <b>movement,</b> he was [...] "the most relaxed, sophisticated and 'westernized' of the lot of us". As President, Kenyatta often reminisced nostalgically about his time in England, referring to it as [...] "home" [...] on several occasions. His life has been described as being preoccupied with [...] "a search for the reconciliation of the Western modernity he embraced and an equally valued Kikuyuness he could not discard". Gikandi argued that Kenyatta's [...] "identification with Englishness was much more profound than both his friends and enemies have been willing to admit".|$|E

50|$|Malcolm X Liberation University (or MXLU) was an {{experimental}} educational institution {{inspired by the}} Black Power and <b>Pan-Africanist</b> <b>movements</b> and located in Durham and Greensboro, North Carolina. Howard Fuller (also known as Owusu Sadaukai), Bertie Howard, and several other African American activists in North Carolina founded the school {{in response to the}} 1969 Allen Building Takeover on Duke University's campus. It operated from October 25, 1969 to June 28, 1973. One of the main reasons the school closed was that political conflicts damaged the school's reputation, making it more difficult to acquire funding. Due to financial setbacks, the school operated for only three years.|$|R

50|$|A common {{critique}} of the Gold Coast ARPS was that its members sought to garner greater financial and political gain for the African bourgeoisie and elites, rather than for the common people. Part of this critique lay in a disjuncture between the espoused values of cultural nationalism by the Gold Coast ARPS that advocated a fight for the indigenous peoples given the connection that the Gold Coast ARPS had with the British colonial government. Specifically, many {{of the members of}} the Gold Coast ARPS had been educated abroad and were part of the elite class that would take over the rule of the Gold Coast should the British colonial rulers leave and thus hold similar power to that of the colonists over their indigenous brethren. Moreover, in the attempts by the Gold Coast ARPS to engage globally with other anti-imperialist and <b>pan-Africanist</b> <b>movements,</b> the Gold Coast ARPS required large sums of money to fund their trips, which they often acquired by charging tribal heads of local communities disproportionate fees to become members of the Gold Coast ARPS. These criticisms of the desires and motives of the Gold Coast ARPS are strengthened by the outcome of the Native Administration Ordinance of 1927, which allowed chiefs of indigenous Gold Coast groups to have direct interaction with the colonial rulers. It was at the same time as the implementation of this ordinance that the Gold Coast Gold Coast ARPS began to lose some of their power, as they could no longer use the Gold Coast indigenous chiefs as leverage from which to gain funds. Some also critique members of the Gold Coast ARPS because many did not return to their ancestral African roots, despite their constant praise of a need to return to traditional African roots as a way to fully realize the cultural nationalist policies that they supported.|$|R
5000|$|Diop and Obenga {{attempted}} to linguistically link Egypt and Africa, {{by arguing that}} the Ancient Egyptian language was related to Diop's native Wolof (Senegal). [...] Diop's work was well received by the political establishment in the post-colonial formative phase {{of the state of}} Senegal, and by the <b>Pan-Africanist</b> Négritude <b>movement,</b> but was rejected by mainstream scholarship. In drafting that section of the report of the UNESCO Symposium, Diop claimed that Diop and Obenga's linguistic reports had a large measure of agreement and were regarded as [...] "very constructive." [...] However, in the discussion thereof in the work Ancient Civilizations of Africa, Volume 2, the editor has inserted a footnote stating that these are merely Diop’s opinions and that they were not accepted by all the experts participating. In particular, Prof Abdelgadir M. Abdalla stated that “The linguistic examples given by Prof Diop were neither convincing nor conclusive.” ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{impact of}} the Gold Coast ARPS' {{interaction}} with global <b>pan-Africanist</b> and anti-imperialist <b>movements</b> rested {{on the ability of}} these interactions to not only bring the grievances of the Gold Coast natives to the global stage but also to help the Gold Coast ARPS gain leverage with which to lobby the colonial government in Gold Coast to recognize the legitimacy of their cultural nationalist and political aims. Another consequence of the Gold Coast ARPS' interaction with other global movements was the attainment of knowledge about how successful African domination of colonial rule could take place. An idea of particular interest to the Gold Coast ARPS was the creation of trade among [...] "all of us who are of African blood".|$|R

50|$|Présence Africaine is a pan-African {{quarterly}} cultural, political, {{and literary}} magazine, published in Paris, France, and founded by Alioune Diop in 1947. In 1949, Présence Africaine {{expanded to include}} a publishing house and a bookstore on the rue des Écoles in the Latin Quarter of Paris.

50|$|Neocolonialism {{was used}} to {{describe}} a type of foreign intervention in countries belonging to the <b>Pan-Africanist</b> <b>movement,</b> {{as well as the}} Bandung Conference (Asian-African Conference, 1955), which led to the Non-Aligned Movement (1961). Neocolonialism was formally defined by the All-African Peoples' Conference (AAPC) and published in the Resolution on Neo-colonialism. At both the Tunis conference (1960) and the Cairo conference (1961), AAPC described the actions of the French Community of independent states, organized by France, as neocolonial.|$|E
50|$|The {{national}} flag of Botswana {{consists of a}} light blue field cut horizontally in the centre by a black stripe with a thin white frame. Adopted in 1966 to replace the Union Jack, {{it has been the}} flag of the Republic of Botswana since the country gained independence that year. It {{is one of the few}} African flags that utilizes neither the colours of the <b>Pan-Africanist</b> <b>movement</b> nor the colours of the country's leading political party.|$|E
5000|$|Nationally, {{the flag}} was {{inspired}} by the MLSTP flag; it is almost identical to it except that the widths of the horizontal bands on the national flag are at a ratio of 2:3:2. On the other hand, the three bands on the flag of the political party are of equal width. On a continental level, the yellow, green and red represented the <b>Pan-Africanist</b> <b>movement.</b> [...] These colours are the same as the ones utilized in the flag of Ethiopia.|$|E
50|$|The flag of Saint Kitts and Nevis {{consists}} of a yellow-edged black band containing two white stars that divides diagonally from the lower hoist-side corner, with a green upper triangle and red lower triangle.

Although the flag utilises the colours of the <b>Pan-Africanist</b> <b>movement,</b> the symbolism behind them is interpreted differently.|$|E
50|$|Touré's primary {{allies in}} the region were presidents Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana and Modibo Keita of Mali.

As a leader of the <b>Pan-Africanist</b> <b>movement,</b> Toure {{consistently}} spoke out against colonial powers, and befriended African American activists such as Malcolm X and Stokely Carmichael, to whom he offered asylum. The latter took the two leaders' names, as Kwame Ture.|$|E
5000|$|The term [...] "United States of Africa" [...] was {{mentioned}} first by Marcus Garvey in his poem Hail, United States of Africa in 1924.

E. B. Du Bois, Patrice Lumumba, George Padmore, Jomo Kenyatta, Dudley Thompson, and Kwame Nkrumah. Later, Nkrumah and Haile Selassie took the idea forward to form the 37 nation Organisation of African Unity, the precursor of the African Union.|$|E
5000|$|The {{proportions}} of Gabon's flag are 3:4. [...] This uncommon flag ratio, which is enshrined by Gabonese law, {{is shared by}} the flags of only three other countries - Democratic Republic of the Congo (some sources state that the proportions are 2:3), Papua New Guinea and San Marino. [...] Furthermore, the country's flag does not utilize the green, yellow and red colours of the <b>Pan-Africanist</b> <b>movement,</b> in contrast to its neighbouring countries. Unlike other former French colonies in Africa, the flag consists of a horizontal tricolour, rather than a vertical one modelled after the flag of France.|$|E

The same year, he published Handbook of Revolutionary Warfare, addressing revolutionary warriors in Angola, Mozambique, South Africa, and Rhodesia and expanding his analysis to Southeast Asia and Latin America. His ideology became more overtly communist, and in 1969 he wrote, in Class Struggle in Africa, that Pan-African socialism would [...] "advance the triumph of the international socialist revolution, and the onward progress towards world communism, under which, every society is ordered on the principle of from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs." ...|$|E

Key issues handled during Harrop's tenure in Conakry were Soviet overflights and bases {{in the country and}} U.S. humanitarian aid in Guinea. In 1977, Harrop left Guinea and {{returned to}} the Bureau of African Affairs to become principle deputy to Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Richard M. Moose. At the Bureau of African Affairs, Harrop spent most time of issues relating to Zaire and the Horn of Africa (particularly the Ogaden War between Ethiopia and Somalia), while Moose handled most matters relating to southern Africa (South Africa, Rhodesia, Namibia, and Angola).|$|E
5000|$|Nkrumah {{discussed}} his political views in his numerous writings, especially in Africa Must Unite (1963) and in NeoColonialism (1965). These writings show {{the impact of}} his stay in Britain in the mid-1940s. The <b>pan-Africanist</b> <b>movement,</b> which had held one of its annual conferences, attended by Nkrumah, at Manchester in 1945, was influenced by socialist ideologies. The movement sought unity among people of African descent and also improvement {{in the lives of}} workers who, it was alleged, had been exploited by capitalist enterprises in Africa. Western countries with colonial histories were identified as the exploiters. According to the socialists, [...] "oppressed" [...] people ought to identify with the socialist countries and organizations that best represented their interests; however, all the dominant world powers in the immediate post-1945 period, except the Soviet Union and the United States, had colonial ties with Africa. Nkrumah asserted that even the United States, which had never colonized any part of Africa, was in an advantageous position to exploit independent Africa unless preventive efforts were taken.|$|E
5000|$|The Portuguese colonized {{the islands}} of São Tomé and Príncipe during the 16th century and {{incorporated}} them into their colonial empire. [...] Four centuries later, the Batepá massacre in 1953 stoked nationalistic sentiment and galvanized a struggle for independence.

[...] The Portuguese, however, refused to grant this and continued to fight on until the Carnation Revolution occurred in 1974. [...] The new government decided to withdraw from their remaining colonies, and negotiated on a roadmap for independence with the MLSTP, whom they had recognized as the [...] "sole representative" [...] of the islands. [...] Several submissions for a new flag were made, all of which utilized the colours of the <b>Pan-Africanist</b> <b>movement.</b> These were all turned down, and a new flag - reportedly designed by MLSTP leader and future president Manuel Pinto da Costa - was approved of. [...] It was adopted either on July 12, 1975 - the day the country became independent - or on November 5 of that same year. [...] The flag is almost identical to {{the flag of the}} MLSTP, and although they lost their [...] "monopoly of power" [...] in 1990, the flag remained unchanged.|$|E
