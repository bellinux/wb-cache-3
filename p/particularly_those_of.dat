5|$|Different {{crystalline}} {{forms of}} an element are called allotropes. Some allotropes, <b>particularly</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> elements located (in periodic table terms) alongside {{or near the}} notional dividing line between metals and nonmetals, exhibit more pronounced metallic, metalloidal or nonmetallic behaviour than others. The existence of such allotropes can complicate the classification of the elements involved.|$|E
5|$|Fearing the {{influence}} of French Revolutionary ideals, <b>particularly</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Trimmer emphasized orthodox Anglicanism and encouraged the perpetuation of the contemporary social and political order. Despite her conservatism, however, she agreed with Rousseau and other progressive educational reformers on many issues, such as the damaging effects of rote learning and the irrationalism of fairy tales.|$|E
5|$|Molecular {{biology is}} the study of biology at the {{molecular}} level. This field overlaps with other areas of biology, <b>particularly</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> genetics and biochemistry. Molecular biology is a study of the interactions of the various systems within a cell, including the interrelationships of DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis and how those interactions are regulated.|$|E

5|$|Another {{important}} {{sector in}} South Dakota's economy is tourism. Many travel {{to visit the}} national parks, state parks, and national monuments in the state, <b>particularly</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> the Black Hills region. South Dakota's location between national parks {{in the west and}} large cities to the east also contributes to the state's tourism and hospitality industry. In 2006, tourism provided an estimated 33,000 jobs in the state and contributed over two billion US$ to the economy of South Dakota.|$|E
5|$|British R {{continued}} to be played in the Northern Soul club scene, where early soul records, <b>particularly</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> Motown, were highly prized. There were also bands on the London pub rock circuit. Occasional R pub rock acts like Dr Feelgood managed to build a following through tireless touring. They topped the British charts with live album Stupidity (1976), but failed to make a significant impact in the US. With the rise of disco music, British soul music became popular in the mid-late 1970s.|$|E

5|$|His compositions, <b>particularly</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> {{his later}} period, are notable for their complex textures, rich harmonies and orchestration, and the {{elaborate}} use of leitmotifs—musical phrases associated with individual characters, places, ideas, or plot elements. His advances in musical language, such as extreme chromaticism and quickly shifting tonal centres, greatly influenced {{the development of}} classical music. His Tristan und Isolde is sometimes described as marking the start of modern music.|$|E
5|$|Like most Old World warblers, {{this small}} species is insectivorous, moving restlessly though foliage or briefly hovering. It has been {{recorded}} as taking insects, mainly flies, from more than 50 families, along with other small and medium-sized invertebrates. It will take the eggs and larvae of butterflies and moths, <b>particularly</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> the winter moth. The chiffchaff has been estimated to require about one-third of its weight in insects daily, and it feeds almost continuously in the autumn to put on extra fat as fuel for the long migration flight.|$|E

5|$|The hurricane's intense winds, waves, {{rains and}} storm surge were {{responsible}} for at least 45deaths across ten countries and caused estimated damages of US$1.66billion. First impacting the islands of the Lesser Antilles, Dean's path through the Caribbean devastated agricultural crops, <b>particularly</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> Martinique and Jamaica. Upon reaching Mexico, Hurricane Dean was a Category5 storm, but it missed major population centers and its exceptional Category5 strength landfall caused no deaths and less damage than in the Caribbean islands it passed as a Category2 storm.|$|E
5|$|Unlike animals, many plant cells, <b>particularly</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> the parenchyma, do not terminally differentiate, {{remaining}} totipotent {{with the}} ability to give rise to a new individual plant. Exceptions include highly lignified cells, the sclerenchyma and xylem which are dead at maturity, and the phloem sieve tubes which lack nuclei. While plants use many of the same epigenetic mechanisms as animals, such as chromatin remodelling, an alternative hypothesis is that plants set their gene expression patterns using positional information from the environment and surrounding cells to determine their developmental fate.|$|E
5|$|Globally, {{cervical}} {{cancer is the}} fourth commonest cancer amongst women, <b>particularly</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> lower socioeconomic status. Women in this group have reduced access to health care, high rates of child and forced marriage, parity, polygamy and exposure to STIs from multiple sexual contacts of male partners. All of these factors place them at higher risk. In developing countries, {{cervical cancer}} accounts for 12% of cancer cases amongst women and is the second leading cause of death, where about 85% of the global burden of over 500,000 cases and 250,000 deaths from this disease occurred in 2012. The highest incidence occurs in Eastern Africa, where with Middle Africa, cervical cancer is the commonest cancer in women. The case fatality rate of 52% is also higher in developing countries than in developed countries (43%), and the mortality rate varies by 18-fold between regions of the world.|$|E

5|$|North American red foxes, <b>particularly</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> {{northern}} Alaska, are {{the most}} valued for their fur, as they have guard hairs of a silky texture, which, after dressing, allow the wearer unrestricted mobility. Red foxes living in southern Alaska's coastal areas and the Aleutian Islands are an exception, as they have extremely coarse pelts that rarely exceed one-third {{of the price of}} their northern Alaskan cousins. Most European peltries have coarse-textured fur compared to North American varieties. The only exceptions are the Nordic and Far Eastern Russian peltries, but they are still inferior to North American peltries in terms of silkiness.|$|E
5|$|On 3 August, the RAN {{was placed}} under Admiralty control. Orders for RAN {{warships}} were prepared {{over the next}} few days: Australia was assigned to the concentration of British naval power on the China Station, but was allowed to seek out and destroy any armoured warships (<b>particularly</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> the German East Asia Squadron) in the Australian Station before doing so. Vice Admiral Maximilian von Spee, commander of the German squadron, was aware of Australias presence in the region and her superiority to his entire force; the German admiral's plan was to harass British shipping and colonies in the Pacific until the presence of Australia and the China Squadron forced his fleet to relocate to other seas.|$|E

5|$|The Tasmanian {{numbfish}} is {{a fairly}} inactive species that spends {{long periods of time}} buried motionless in sediment. It feeds primarily on polychaete worms (<b>particularly</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> the family Maldanidae) and crustaceans (including amphipods, decapods, and tanaids). Nematodes and sipunculids may also be consumed on rare occasions. Juvenile rays consume polychaetes and crustaceans in roughly equal proportions, while adults consume mostly polychaetes. This dietary shift may reflect increasing experience with age, as polychaetes are burrowing animals and thus more difficult to locate and capture than crustaceans. Like other members of its family, the Tasmanian numbfish can defend itself with a modest electric shock. Its predators include the broadnose sevengill shark (Notorynchus cepedianus). The tapeworm Anthobothrium hickmani is a parasite of this species.|$|E
5|$|The {{ring-tailed lemur}} is an {{opportunistic}} omnivore primarily eating fruits and leaves, <b>particularly</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> the tamarind tree (Tamarindus indica), known natively as kily.

The ring-tailed lemur eats from as many as three dozen different plant species, and its diet includes flowers, herbs, bark and sap. It has been observed eating decayed wood, earth, spider webs, insect cocoons, arthropods (spiders, caterpillars, cicadas and grasshoppers) and small vertebrates (birds and chameleons). During the dry season it becomes increasingly opportunistic.|$|E
