40|$|A summary is {{presented}} {{of the various}} types of electronic instrumentation used. Also discussed is automatic data handling equipment, as well as the nature of commandd and readout signals used on remote control critical assembly machines. Equipment is described for performing prompt neutron lifetime measurements, <b>pile</b> <b>oscillator</b> technique, and the power fluctuation experiment. (auth...|$|E
40|$|An {{attempt is}} made to {{ascertain}} the optimum working conditions of a <b>pile</b> <b>oscillator</b> and to compare this method with the danger coefficient technique {{from the point of}} view of minimum amount of resonance absorption which can be detected. The space-time behavior of the absorption properties of the sample is described by means of a delta -function and the reactor kinetic equations are obtained by using a single mode expansion of the flux. The results are applied to a bare reactor model equivalent to the fully reflected, parallelepiped BSR-I. (W. D. M. ...|$|E

5000|$|The group formed {{out of a}} {{traditional}} rock band called The Overland Stage Electric Band, working regularly in the East Village. Simeon was the singer, but began to incorporate a 1940s vintage audio oscillator into the show, which alienated the other band members {{to the extent that}} the group was eventually reduced to the duo of Simeon and Taylor, at which point they renamed themselves The Silver Apples, after the William Butler Yeats poem The Song of the Wandering Aengus. The arsenal of oscillators eventually grew (according to their first LP liner notes) to include [...] "nine audio <b>oscillators</b> <b>piled</b> on top of each other and eighty-six manual controls to control lead, rhythm and bass pulses with hands, feet and elbows". Simeon devised a system of telegraph keys and pedals to control tonality and chord changes, and reportedly never learned to play traditional piano-styled keyboards or synthesizers.|$|R
40|$|<b>Pile</b> <b>oscillator</b> {{techniques}} are powerful methods to measure small reactivity worth of isotopes {{of interest for}} nuclear data improvement. This kind of experiments has long been implemented in the Mineve experimental reactor, operated by CEA Cadarache. A hybrid technique, mixing reactivity worth estimation and measurement of small changes around test samples is presented here. It was made possible after the development of high sensitivity miniature fission chambers introduced next to the irradiation channel. A test campaign, called MAESTRO-SL, took place in 2015. Its objective {{was to assess the}} feasibility of the hybrid method and investigate the possibility to separate mixed neutron effects, such as fission/capture or scattering/capture. Experimental results are presented and discussed in this paper, which focus on comparing two measurements setups, one using a power control system (closed loop) and another one where the power is free to drift (open loop). First, it is demonstrated that open loop is equivalent to closed loop. Uncertainty management and methods reproducibility are discussed. Second, results show that measuring the flux depression around oscillated samples provides valuable information regarding partial neutron cross sections. The technique is found to be very sensitive to the capture cross section at the expense of scattering, making it very useful to measure small capture effects of highly scattering samples...|$|E
