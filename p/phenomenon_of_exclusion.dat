The result of the appearance of the excluded spaces is the lack of the right to the city for all its inhabitants. Foresaid lack deprives the participant of the possibility of observation and penetration the urban structure, which further deepens the sense of alienation.

I will do so by looking at them as they appear from three distinct perspectives. First, I will explore them as they appear in the act of representation; second, in the closure of meaning in social institutions; and third, I will attempt to describe the metapsychological dynamics of exclusion and violence from an intrapsychic perspective as they may unfold in an inter-subjective situation.

40|$|International audienceIn landscapes {{dominated}} by fluvial erosion, the landscape morphology {{is closely related}} to the hydrographic network system. In this paper, we investigate the hydrographic network reorganization caused by a headward piracy mechanism between two drainage basins in France, the Meuse and the Moselle. Several piracies occurred in the Meuse basin during the past one million years, and the basin's current characteristics are favorable to new piracies by the Moselle river network. This study evaluates the consequences over the next several million years of a relative lowering of the Moselle River (and thus of its basin) with respect to the Meuse River. The problem is addressed with a numerical modeling approach (landscape evolution model, hereafter LEM) that requires empirical determinations of parameters and threshold values. Classically, fitting of the parameters is based on analysis {{of the relationship between the}} slope and the drainage area and is conducted under the hypothesis of equilibrium. Application of this conventional approach to the capture issue yields incomplete results that have been consolidated by a parametric sensitivity analysis. The LEM equations give a six-dimensional parameter space that was explored with over 15, 000 simulations using the landscape evolution model GOLEM. The results demonstrate that stream piracies occur in only four locations in the studied reach near the city of Toul. The locations are mainly controlled by the local topography and are model-independent. Nevertheless, the chronology of the captures depends on two parameters: the river concavity (given by the fluvial advection equation) and the hillslope erosion factor. Thus, the simulations lead to three different scenarios that are explained by a <b>phenomenon</b> <b>of</b> <b>exclusion</b> or a string of events...|$|E

The issue of women’s inequality {{and lack of}} career progression in the public accounting industry remains a serious issue to be addressed. Despite being offered opportunities to study accounting at University level as never before, women are failing to strive for promotion and partnership in Indonesian accounting firms and government accounting departments to an alarming extent. In fact, in the Indonesian accounting profession, women work almost exclusively in secondary roles such as in routine compliance work, bookkeeping and clerking positions {{with only a few}} women obtaining the highest levels in the Indonesian accounting profession even though there are now a dramatically increased pool of women obtaining accounting degrees and joining the professional work force. The question of why this has happened is a critical one for the future of women in Indonesian professional accounting. This study uses ethnography because this is an appropriate method for the study of women’s daily life and helps us to make sense of our surroundings. Through telling the story of women who are involved in the public accounting profession in Indonesia, this study provides an illustration of the “glass ceiling” and makes visible new knowledge in relation to understanding women’s role in the profession which perhaps could not be identified by using more traditional mainstream accounting research methodology. This study found that women have different experiences of the profession than their male counterparts and this study seeks to allow the voices of these women to be heard in an attempt to demonstrate the lived experience of the <b>phenomenon</b> <b>of</b> <b>exclusion</b> and avoidance in the public accounting profession.

40|$|This chapter {{proposes a}} {{conceptual}} framework in which {{to reflect on the}} <b>phenomenon</b> <b>of</b> <b>exclusion</b> with particular reference to disability. As a reflective practitioner I want to open a dialogue where I can seek {{to make sense of the}} world where the history of disability is littered with discrimination and oppression that has hidden the humanity, individuality and ordinariness of people with disabilities. The term ‘disability’ appears to be a residual category, used to encapsulate a wide range of people who may or may not have anything in common in terms of their everyday experience of the world but who are lumped together because of who they are not. Everyday language is important because it reveals what is valued, what is defined as ‘normal’, who is categorised as ‘different’ and how ‘outsiders’ are positioned. What people with disabilities have in common is a label of ‘otherness’ which relies for its meaning on not being able-bodied or able-minded. At the same time ideologies of able bodied-ness and able minded-ness go largely unchallenged. The chapter argues that unless initiatives to promote inclusiveness are grounded in principles of equality and entitlement they do little to counter discrimination, oppression and injustice, and may in fact entrench them. In this chapter I want to explore whether the current dominant approaches to broadening access to education for people with disabilities are consolidating or dismantling existing exclusionary practices and attitudes. This is important because factors that alienate or disconnect people from each other result in silencing those who are excluded and impoverishing the community as a whole. I call the chapter ‘Circling the Wagons’– a regular defense strategy in the old cowboys’ movies and a fitting metaphor to evoke a number of themes I want to explore. The first of these is exclusion – keeping out one group and defending the interests of another. When countering exclusion it is important not only to look at ways of getting or improving access but also to look at what is being guarded, how it is guarded and why it is guarded. The second theme is that of stereotyping. ‘Circling the Wagons’ usually takes place among a cast of clearly defined heroes, villains and victims. Who occupies each role is dependent on who is telling the story. In tackling exclusion, knowing whose perspective is privileged is key to understanding the values and beliefs that inform decisions on how to promote inclusiveness. The third theme is that of insider/outsider. Those who attacked the wagons were interested in more than these specific wagons; they knew that these wagons represented a much bigger happening yet at the same time those in the wagons knew little of their adversaries or the land they traveled through, other than the myths and legends that left them in fear of their lives. ...|$|E
