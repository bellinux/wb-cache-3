The two dorsal fins are shaped like rounded lobes and are located {{very close to the}} caudal fin, which is of similar size with a nearly symmetrical, rounded margin. The tail is extremely short, such as that the caudal fin barely extends past the pelvic fin disc. The skin is entirely devoid of dermal denticles, and may be creased in areas. The dorsal coloration ranges from dark to reddish brown, to grayish, pinkish, or yellowish, and may be plain or sparsely patterned with irregular darker and lighter markings.

500|$|On August 24, 2009, Garrido {{visited the}} San Francisco {{office of the}} Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and left a four-page essay {{containing}} his ideas about religion and sexuality, suggesting that he had discovered a solution to problem behaviors like his past crimes. The essay described how he had cured his criminal sexual behaviors and how that information {{could be used to}} assist in curing other sexual predators by: [...] "controlling human impulses that drive humans to commit dysfunctional acts." [...] On the same day, he went to a University of California, Berkeley police office with Dugard's two daughters, seeking permission to hold a special event on campus as a part of his [...] "God's Desire" [...] program. He spoke with U.C. Berkeley special events manager Lisa Campbell. She perceived his behavior as [...] "erratic" [...] and that the girls were [...] "sullen and submissive." [...] She asked him to make an appointment for the next day, which he did, leaving his name in the process. Officer Ally Jacobs discovered, through a background check, that Garrido was a registered sex offender on federal parole for kidnapping and rape. When he and the girls returned for their appointment at 2:00p.m. the following day, August 25, Jacobs made a point of sitting in during the meeting. The girls appeared to Jacobs to be <b>pale,</b> <b>as</b> if having not been exposed to sunlight, and their behavior unusual. Since Garrido's several parole violations were a basis for an arrest, Jacobs phoned the parole office to relay her concerns, leaving a report of the meeting on voicemail.|$|E

2500|$|After she {{finished}} her autobiography Livsglede {{in the beginning of}} 2010, Margit Sandemos sister, Eva Underdal, told her she was actually raped a fourth time. [...] Margit had come home late one evening in the age of nine, <b>pale</b> <b>as</b> a sheet, with knees covered in scratches.

2500|$|The word pale derives {{ultimately}} {{from the}} Latin word , meaning stake, specifically a stake {{used to support}} a fence.

The term was used not only for the Pale in Ireland but also for various other English colonial settlements, notably English Calais.
