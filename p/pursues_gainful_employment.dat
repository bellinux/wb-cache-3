25|$|Andreas Hug {{was born}} in Zurich, Switzerland on September 7, 1964. His father, Arthur, was a Swiss of French descent and was in French Foreign Legionnaire. He died in Thailand under mysterious {{circumstances}} without ever seeing his son. Hug's mother, Madelaine Hug-Baumann, was German. She was forced to <b>pursue</b> <b>gainful</b> <b>employment.</b> Unable to care for Andy, she immediately put him up for adoption and he spent {{the first three years}} of his life in an orphanage until his care was taken over by his grandparents along with his brother, Charly, and sister, Fabienne. His grandmother, Fridy, and grandfather, Herrmann Baumann, a bricklayer, raised them in Wohlen in the Canton of Aargau.|$|R

40|$|In its {{guidelines}} for Member State's employment policies the European Union enumerates among its targets increased employment rates for women. Achieving this target has meanwhile become important {{also because of}} future demographic developments: in order to productively cope {{with the challenge of}} an ageing population, it is indispensable to build up, maintain and develop human resources. An underlying condition to achieving this end is to efficiently use the human capital provided by women. Already in the past decades, it was mainly women with children whose growing inclination to <b>pursue</b> a <b>gainful</b> <b>employment</b> made it possible to boost employment rates (among married women in their main working age, with children under 15, the labour force participation rate grew by 23 percentage points between 1981 and 1997). In contrast to this group, most other groups showed declining participation rates: among the young because of the trend towards longer education and training, among the old because of the increasing trend towards early retirement. Family obligations are of much greater importance for a woman's decision to enter the labour market than for men. The gender-specific segmentation of paid and unpaid work results in a framework that in turn leads to worse conditions faced by women in their <b>gainful</b> <b>employment</b> and to an inefficient allocation of resources. Women with children are particularly liable to accept "downward" job mobility or restricted career opportunities in order to reconcile their professional and family life. Women with children working at full-time jobs are more frequently employed in lower-qualified jobs and more rarely in higher-qualified jobs than childless women. Part-time jobs held by women with children are even more frequently of the lower-qualified type than full-time jobs. Against this background, the report analyses the issue of economic factors determining women's fertility decisions and the labour force behaviour of women with children, listing some mechanisms which contribute to the relatively low ranking of women in the labour market. The purpose of the report is to highlight theoretical and analytical factors, on which an intensified future empirical research on the subject should be based. It concentrates on issues which require more detailed analysis in order to provide an insight into the impact of different political approaches upon labour supply decisions of women and their fertility rate.

50|$|From a legal standpoint, <b>gainful</b> <b>employment</b> {{is defined}} as work that a person can pursue and perform for money or {{activities}} intended to provide an income to a person. Recently <b>gainful</b> <b>employment</b> has also been approached from the political perspective and applied to education reform. The <b>Gainful</b> <b>Employment</b> Rule {{is an example of}} a policy regarding <b>gainful</b> <b>employment</b> that has educational applications. According to the U.S. Department of Education, the <b>Gainful</b> <b>Employment</b> Rule “requires schools to provide their students with an education adequate enough for them to pay their college loans back” so that they will be gainfully employed after they graduate from college. In October 2010, the Barack Obama administration designed a set of rules to provide aid for educational institutions. They expect this funding to protect students from inappropriate recruiting practices and increase information about the quality and effectiveness of college and training programs.|$|R

5000|$|A highly {{controversial}} topic is the <b>Gainful</b> <b>Employment</b> Rule {{proposed by the}} Obama administration in 2010. According to the administration, {{the main purpose of}} the rule is to create career colleges and training programs that better prepare students for <b>gainful</b> <b>employment.</b> In order to determine if programs prepare students for <b>gainful</b> <b>employment,</b> the U.S. Department of Education intends to measure the relationship between the debt students incur and their incomes after completing the program as well as the rate in which program enrollees repay their loans. If a program graduates a large share of students with high debt-to-income ratios, the program may be ineligible to participate in federal student funding. Opponents argue against the <b>Gainful</b> <b>Employment</b> Rule because it proposes to eliminate or limit “financial aid to students if their projected earnings after graduation do not meet a certain debt-to-income ratio.” ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Gainful</b> <b>employment,</b> when {{approached}} from a psychological perspective {{has been shown}} to have relevant clinical and real world applications.

In a study assessing perceived quality of life in individuals with traumatic brain injury, findings indicated that the level of engagement in work activities was significantly related to perceived quality of life, suggesting that <b>gainful</b> <b>employment</b> leads to more favorable appraisals of quality of life. Similar findings argue that <b>gainful</b> <b>employment</b> may function to provide a buffer against depression and anxiety in individuals with traumatic brain injury.|$|R

50|$|<b>Gainful</b> <b>employment</b> is {{most often}} {{approached}} from a psychological standpoint with business, real world, and clinical applications. Specifically, the Strengths-Based Practice is a psychological approach to <b>gainful</b> <b>employment</b> that has business applications for the employed and people in management positions. In management in particular, managers who focus on employee strengths, communicate company goals, and give constructive feedback to employees promote <b>gainful</b> <b>employment.</b> One {{example of this is}} the Clifton Strengths Finder, from the book Now, Discover Your Strengths which employs positive psychology principles to build on the strengths that employees already have, as opposed to changing their weaknesses and deficiencies. According to a study done by Clifton and Harter, the strengths-based approach to <b>gainful</b> <b>employment</b> results in three major steps 1) the identification of talents, 2) the integration of talents into the employee’s image and workplace, and 3) tactual behavior change in which the employee begins to view his or her success {{as a result of his}} or her unique talents.|$|R

These programs, which are offered by public and private not-for-profit institutions, postsecondary vocational institutions, and by for-profit proprietary institutions, should prepare students for <b>gainful</b> <b>employment.</b> For decades, the U.S. Department of Education (ED) had not established regulations that explicitly outlined what it means for a program to be properly preparing students for <b>gainful</b> <b>employment.</b> As pressing concerns about the quality of programs at for- profit institutions began to arise, the concerns about the level of student loan debt assumed by students did as well.

50|$|The {{regulations}} {{mandated by}} the ED were to help regulate the for-profit sector and to combat the issue of <b>gainful</b> <b>employment.</b> However, the Association of Private Sector Colleges and Universities, which endorses for -profits, challenged these regulations in court.

The court sustained that the ED {{had the authority to}} regulate <b>gainful</b> <b>employment,</b> yet it cited the ED had not provided rationale metrics or measures in the debt measures. At present, only the disclosure requirements of providing prospective students with placements rates, on time graduation rates and other similar information remain. On March 19, 2013 the judge ruled again in response to the ED's motion to reinstate the reporting requirements in order that it could implement the disclosure requirements of <b>Gainful</b> <b>Employment.</b> The judged denied the motion of the ED on the basis that the reporting requirements would violate the federal ban on the student unit record system.
