40|$|SUMMARY. The {{location}} and some characteristics of nine veins containing nigerite are reported. These veins {{are part of}} the province of tin-tantalum veins of central Amap~i. They are intrusive in andalusite schist and commonly consist of pegmatite in the centre and of quartz-mica rock at the margins. The nigerite can occur in the pegmatite {{as well as in the}} quartz-mica rock; its presence in a sample of quartz-sillimanite rock is also mentioned. In both pegmatite and quartz-mica rock, the common associated translucent heavy minerals are cassiterite, tourmaline, chrysoberyl, and occasionally andatusite, sillimanite, and garnet. Associated minerals in the quartz-sillimanite rock are cassiterite and chrysoberyl. Nigerite and cassiterite commonly occur together but are not found in the presence of gahnite. A possible xplanation for this is given. The nigerite of Amap~i occurs as thin hexagonal plates, transparent and golden brown, amber-yellow or colourless, with diameters from microscopic up to a few millimetres. The sizes and the optical sign of this nigerite are the same as those of Nigeria and of Siberia, whereas Portuguese nigerite occurs in very fine grains and is mostly optically negative. The existence of alluvial nigerite is reported. IN 1968, during a <b>prospecting</b> <b>programme</b> for cassiterite in the central part of Amap~i Territory, Brazil, samples of vein material were panned and later concentrated i...|$|E

40|$|The {{characteristics}} of hydrocarbon resource base {{qualitative and quantitative}} degrade {{are reflected in the}} increase of the share of small and medium−sized deposits, as well as hard−to−recover reserves. This makes the need to update the approaches to the implementation of the geological <b>prospecting</b> <b>programmes.</b> The geological exploration performance differs in oil−producing regions of the Russian Federation due to a number of various factors. The subject matter of the study is the assessment of the strength of these factors in various working, geological, infrastructure and economic conditions to determine the effectiveness of the existing economic model of the recovery of hydrocarbon resource base, as well as to develop the author’s suggestions. The hypothesis of the study proposes to change the economic, as well as financial and tax mechanisms of government regulation of the geological exploration, carried out by small oil producing companies on license areas with one or several fields in order to stimulate the development of hydrocarbon resource base. The method of the study is the correlation analysis of the impact of various factors on geological exploration on mineral resource base recovery. It is carried out utilizing K. Mohn model and the statistical data of three subjects of the Russian Federation (the Republic of Tatarstan, Khanty−Mansiysk Autonomous District and Tomsk region). The results of the study can be applied in the tax and financial legislation, {{as well as in the}} management of oil and gas industry in the field of geological exploration. On the basis of the conducted analysis and international experience, the author suggests to introduce reasonable tax incentives and the mechanism of public private partnership in the realization of geological <b>prospecting</b> <b>programmes</b> with the aim to support small oil producing companies at the initial stage of the development of a field...|$|R

40|$|International audienceRecent German {{labour market}} reforms {{introduced}} {{a large scale}} workfare programme called One-Euro-Jobs to activate welfare recipients and improve their employment <b>prospects.</b> In <b>programme</b> design leeway is left to regional actors. Using administrative data and Propensity Score Matching, this article investigates the association between programme design and effectiveness, so as to provide insight on how to increase programme effectiveness. First, effects {{of different types of}} One-Euro-Jobs according to planned duration and weekly working hours compared to 'waiting' are estimated. Second, programme types are compared directly to disentangle selection and programme effects. As expected lock-in effects are larger for participations with a longer planned duration, but not for those with longer weekly working hours. One-Euro-Jobs do not generally increase the employment prospects for East German men beyond 2 years after programme start and longer and more intensive participations even decrease employment prospects. In West Germany, One-Euro-Jobs generally increase the employment chances and longer participations lead to slightly greater employment opportunities roughly 2 years after programme start. The initial advantages of short participations decrease over time. Following these results, a reallocation of participants might improve programme effectiveness...|$|R

40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version {{is available from the}} publisher via the DOI in this record. During the European debt crisis, numerous states launched austerity programmes. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) evaluates and forecasts the likelihood of member states’ success in implementing these programmes. Although IMF evaluations influence country risk perceptions on capital markets, little is known about their reasoning. This article uses fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to explore on what grounds the IMF evaluated the success <b>prospects</b> of austerity <b>programmes</b> during the European debt crisis. Results reveal that IMF evaluations are heavily influenced by the programme's implementation credibility. They require a tractable policy problem, a country's institutional capacity to structure implementation, and favour expenditure reduction over revenue measures. By acting as a strict guide on the road to fiscal adjustment, the IMF indirectly influences member states’ scope of policy making through its surveillance activities. Extensive austerity programmes that need to be implemented swiftly are evaluated negatively if the country is not involved in an IMF programme...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the main}} {{instruments}} which was introduced with the 'Hartz-Reforms' was a start-up subsidy called Me Inc. ('Ich-AG'). This instrument was introduced {{in addition to the}} Bridging Allowance (") which had already been implemented in the 1980 s. Between 2003 and 2006 more than one million formerly unemployed were supported to set up their own business with these two schemes. Previous studies showed that both programmes rather complemented each other by attracting different target groups to start up their own business. Short- and medium-term <b>prospects</b> of both <b>programmes</b> were already evaluated positively within the evaluation of the 'Hartz-Reforms'; whereas long-term evidence could not be drawn due to the limited observation window. This study closes this research gap and provides evidence on the success of subsidized start-ups five years after foundation. It turns out that about 50 to 60 percent of former Me Inc. founders and 53 to 67 percent of Bridging Allowance participants are still full-/part-time self-employed at this time. With respect to labour market integration both schemes can be considered as effective: Throughout, we find higher employment rates for participants in comparison to other non-subsidized unemployed individuals; participants additionally achieve higher incomes. The induced employment effects are relatively high for the Bridging Allowance scheme; for each 100, 000 supported start-ups 80, 000 additional full-time equivalents have been created...|$|R
40|$|The Olympic Games is {{recognised}} worldwide as {{the largest}} sports mega-event - certainly, the event attracting the largest amount of media coverage globally. As well as a sports event, the Olympics are a cultural phenomenon, with a history spanning more than 100 years and supported by a global network of organisations with an educational and intercultural remit that defines itself as a Movement and aspires to promote Olympism as a 'philosophy of life', headed by the International Olympic Committee. What is less known is that the Games also incorporate 100 years of Olympic cultural and arts programming and that such experience is playing a growing role defining or contributing to respective host cities' cultural policies.

40|$|In 2008, the WHO {{facilitated}} the {{primary health care}} (PHC) revitalisation agenda. The purpose was to strengthen African health systems {{in order to address}} communicable and non-communicable diseases. Our aim was to assess the position of civil society-led community home based care programmes (CHBC), which serve the needs of patients with HIV, within this agenda. We examined how their roles and place in health systems evolved, and the <b>prospects</b> for these <b>programmes</b> in national policies and strategies to revitalise PHC, as new health care demands arise. Methods: The study was conducted in Ethiopia, Malawi, South Africa and Zambia and used an historical, comparative research design. We used purposive sampling in the selection of countries and case studies of CHBC programmes. Qualitative methods included semi-structured interviews, focus group discussions, service observation and community mapping exercises. Quantitative methods included questionnaire surveys. Results: The capacity of PHC services increased rapidly in the mid-to-late 2000 s via CHBC programme facilitation of community mobilisation and participation in primary care services and the exceptional investments for HIV/AIDS. CHBC programmes diversified their services in response to the changing health and social care needs of patients on lifelong anti-retroviral therapy and there is a general trend to extend service delivery beyond HIV-infected patients. We observed similarities in the way the governments of South Africa, Malawi and Zambia are integrating CHBC programmes into PHC by making PHC facilities the focal point for management and state-paid community health workers responsible for the supervision of community-based activities. Contextual differences were found between Ethiopia, South Africa, Malawi and Zambia, whereby the policy direction of the latter two countries is to have in place structures and mechanisms that actively connect health and social welfare interventions from governmental and non-governmental actors. Conclusions: Countries may differ in the means to integrate and co-ordinate government and civil society agencies but the net result is expanded PHC capacity. In a context of changing health care demands, CHBC programmes are a vital mechanism for the delivery of primary health and social welfare services...|$|R
40|$|BIM Technologies and Process are {{steadily}} increasing {{in the design}} and construction industry. The amount of undergraduate courses delivering BIM based applied and theory courses is also on the rise. These students will be entering a job market where their skillsets in digital modelling and collaborative practice will be in demand. However, existing AEC (architectural, engineering, construction) professionals are recognising the changes happening in the industry. Each domain is influenced and challenged by BIM. The traditional process and workflows will change as BIM adoption grows. Tobin [1] states the long-term impact of any innovation is often not understood when it initially emerges, a fundamental transformation of design services also occurs as BIM models proved increasingly valuable for numerous uses beyond the mere drawings they made possible. AEC professionals are seeking out training and education courses to upskill. Perhaps the greatest challenge faced by professionals seeking to move their work to BIM is the conceptual move away from pushing data out to the stakeholders in a traditional detached procurement process in favour of bringing the stakeholders to the data in a collaborative process. Collaboration is not something that comes easy in a design and construction industry that has its roots in a division of intellectual effort over technical know-how going back over 500 years. For PG (post graduate) students who have been taught in domain based silos then professionally educated within demarcation boundaries of one’s discipline based on a hierarchical system of design responsibility, the idea of setting this to one side so that you open yourself to a collaborative process is a daunting <b>prospect.</b> Specialist education <b>programmes</b> must be developed to teach such professionals how to collaborate. Bruffee [2] states the collaborative learning gives students practice in working together when the stakes are relatively low, so they can work effectively together later when the stakes are high. AEC professionals can take full advantage of the technologies and the integrated collaborative process it promotes. This paper will report findings on a case study of post graduate multidisciplinary collaborative learning module in the School of Multidisciplinary Technology’s CPD BIM programme in the Dublin Institute of Technology...|$|R
40|$|Master's thesis in Biological chemistryThis {{master project}} {{is a part of}} the Strategic Institute <b>programme,</b> <b>ProSpect,</b> granted by the Norwegian Research Council (NFR). In order to develop safe {{minimally}} processed seafood and to increase quality and shelf-life, the project ProSpect combined principles from aseptic packaging with surface pasteurisation with steam. This master project had special focus on thermal steam pasteurisation of fish products. A special designed “BugDeath” test rig has been purchased for the experiments. Listeria monocytogenes was selected as target organism for the pasteurisation. To avoid the extra precautions associated with working with pathogenic bacteria, specific strains of Listeria innocua were selected as surrogate organisms for L. monocytogenes. L. innocua is a non-pathogenic organism, but more heat tolerant than L. monocytogenes. The objective of the current study was to determine inactivation kinetics of different L. innocua strains (ATCC 33090 from American Type Culture Collection and CCUG 35613 from the Culture Collection, University of Gothenburg) by using two different experimental designs: 1) using classical heat treatment in capillary tubes, 2) using steam on fish product surfaces. Another objective of this study was to investigate and to compare differences in inactivation kinetic in capillary tubes and on fish surface. In the fist experimental design with heat treatment in capillary tubes two strains of L. innocua (ATCC 33090 and CCUG 35613) were used. Both strains were cultivated and heat treated in the tryptone soya broth with yeast extract (TSBYE). In the second experimental design with steam pasteurisation on fish product surfaces L. innocua ATCC 33090 was used. This strain was cultivated in the TSBYE and heat treated on surimi “model-product”. In both designs L. innocua strains after heat treatment were regenerated on the tryptone soya agar with yeast extract (TSAYE). The D-values were used to determine inactivation kinetics and describe the heat resistance of the microorganisms. The calculations of heat resistance for treatment in capillary tubes were based on the linear first-order kinetics. The D-values were calculated for temperatures 59, 59. 5, 60 ° C. D-values for L. innocua ATCC 33090 were D 59 = 2. 62 minutes, D 59. 5 = 2. 1 minutes, D 60 = 1. 58 minutes and for L. innocua CCUG 35613 were D 59 = 2. 54 minutes, D 59. 5 = 1. 91 minutes, D 60 = 1. 50 minutes. The inactivation of L. innocua in steam surface pasteurisation of fish products did not follow log-linear kinetics. Bacterial numbers of L. innocua ATCC 33090 declined rapidly during the first 15 s of steam treatment in “BugDeath” rig. This initial rate of decline slowed during the next 45 s. However, after 60 s of steam treatment bacterial numbers declined very slowly, so that bacterial numbers were still present after steam treatment for 4 min. In this experiment steam treatment of samples for 60 s gave total 3 - 4 log CFU reduction, but after 60 s had not considerable reduction of bacterial numbers and most likely had an undesirable effect for quality of the product...|$|R
40|$|The red {{squirrel}} (Sciurus vulgaris) {{has suffered a}} 20 % decline in its range in Ireland since {{the introduction of the}} grey squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis) mainly through competition. Translocation (the intentional movement of a living organism from one area to another) of {{red squirrel}}s was conducted in Derryclare wood, Connemara between July and October 2005. This project has investigated the fate of this red squirrel population through post-release monitoring techniques. A second translocation to Belleek Forest Park, Co Mayo was also conducted and the establishment and subsequent well-being of this population was also investigated. The second translocation of red squirrels to Belleek was conducted in a three phase programme in 2007 and 2008. Fifteen individuals were translocated in what was designed as a soft release procedure, although there were some problems of squirrels escaping from the enclosure during the second and third phase of the translocation. A fourth phase of translocation was deemed unnecessary as the population began to breed and recruit new individuals. Initial success was recorded using short-term monitoring. Settlement patterns investigated by radio telemetry displayed a priority for locating food initially after release; individuals tracked were found to include the release enclosure and supplementary feeders within home ranges. Not all squirrels established core areas initially using their home range uniformly. However, during a second tracking session, conducted 18 months later, a pattern more in keeping with that of established squirrel populations was shown; individuals were utilising other areas of the wood including parts without supplementary feeders and all had preferred core areas within their home range. Post-release monitoring in Derryclare was mainly conducted through live trapping, between June 2008 and March 2011. It was found that the population had dispersed further into the woodland since work had finished there in 2007 and were utilising new areas. Six of the originally translocated stock were captured near to or within the Nature Reserve in which the release enclosures had been based. Both red squirrel populations at Belleek Forest Park and Derryclare wood were monitored to investigate establishment of each population and their demographics in the medium-term. Comparison between the populations in each wood showed that spread of the red squirrels was influenced by difference in habitat type. The red squirrel population at Belleek were found to have inhabited all available habitat and then increased in density, whereas, the population at Derryclare were found to have spread through the woodland as their density increased. Recruitment of individuals was high at both sites, these new squirrels were the progeny of translocated stock as both areas were isolated from the possible immigration of other red squirrels. Over the course of the study both populations showed an increase in abundance year on year. Habitat quality was also monitored at both sites. The future success of both translocations was considered and the potential threats to the populations analysed, in order to investigate the long-term prospects of both populations. At Derryclare wood, the potential impact of habitat loss was investigated. This was achieved by examining the changing squirrel carrying capacity of the woodland due to planned clear-felling procedures. It was found that if felling was conducted as planned by land-owners, then a sufficient sustainable habitat would be available for the red squirrel population in the future. However, in April 2011, 150 hectares of forest were impacted by a forest fire. The actual detrimental effects of the fire were investigated; it was found that as the fire remained on the ground, mature trees were only scorched at their base which did not affect their survival. A small area of immature trees did suffer fatally from the fire but not enough was damaged to impact upon the sustainability of the red squirrel population. At Belleek Forest Park, the potential infiltration of grey squirrels to the area was investigated. A distribution survey of red and grey squirrels in the region separating Belleek from known grey squirrel inhabited areas of the northwest of Ireland was undertaken. It was found that the red squirrel was widespread throughout the area surveyed. Only five reports of grey squirrels were received by the survey, each report was more than a year old and in each case only one squirrel had been witnessed. Although the authenticity of these grey squirrel sightings was questioned, the potential invasion of greys from these possible nearest sources of grey squirrels to Belleek was analysed. This was achieved by using a GIS based model Least Cost Pathway (LCP) from the source location to Belleek Forest Park. The LCPs were examined to determine whether such routes were viable. It was found that there was potential for grey squirrels to reach Belleek from these locations, but that the grey squirrel would have to establish itself in habitat along the way. LCP analysis also provided the potential locations of sentry posts (areas which can be observed to detect grey squirrel presence and progress towards Belleek) to use in on-going monitoring and where necessary control programmes, that will protect the area from the invasion of the grey squirrel. Overall, the project found that translocation is a feasible option for conserving the red squirrel in Ireland. It found that red squirrels can establish themselves in uninhabited woodland successfully. A recommendation from the study suggests that long-term <b>prospects</b> and monitoring <b>programmes</b> in target sites must be incorporated into feasibility plans in the preliminary stages of translocation. This includes investigation into forest sustainability and where possible models such as the LCP to assess the sites isolation from grey squirrels...|$|R
