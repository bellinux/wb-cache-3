50|$|An {{asset swap}} is the swap of a fixed investment, like a bond that will yield {{guaranteed}} coupon payments, for a floating investment, i.e. an index. It {{has a similar}} structure to a <b>plain</b> <b>vanilla</b> <b>swap,</b> but the underlying of the swap contract is different.|$|E
40|$|In {{an attempt}} to manage the risk of {{mismatch}} between the actual claims and the anticipated claim amounts in motor insurance pool, we introduce a few new concepts of motor loss rate-linked securities such as motor loss rate options and motor loss rate swaps. These hybrid derivatives can transfer the motor insurance loss rate risks to the capital markets. For the valuation of the motor loss rate-linked securities, we assume that motor insurance aggregate claims follow a compound Poisson distribution. An Esscher transform is chosen for a risk adjusted measure change. Using the Fourier transform of the risk neutral distribution of increment of loss process and its inversion, we derive integral expressions {{of the price of}} a ratchet option and a fixed-for-floating <b>plain</b> <b>vanilla</b> <b>swap</b> on the motor loss rate. As illustrations, some numerical examples are given under a few specified assumptions on the distribution of the discounted losses and the parameters...|$|E
40|$|Once upon a {{time there}} was a {{classical}} financial world in which all the Libors were equal. Standard textbooks taught that simple relations held, such that, for example, a 6 months Libor Deposit was replicable with a 3 months Libor Deposits plus a 3 x 6 months Forward Rate Agreement (FRA), and that Libor was a good proxy of the risk free rate required as basic building block of no-arbitrage pricing theory. Nowadays, in the modern financial world after the credit crunch, some Libors are more equal than others, depending on their rate tenor, and classical formulas are history. Banks are not anymore “too big to fail”, Libors are fixed by panels of risky banks, and they are risky rates themselves. These simple empirical facts carry very important consequences in derivative’s trading and risk management, such as, for example, basis risk, collateralization and regulatory pressure in favour of Central Counterparties. Something that should be carefully considered by anyone managing even a single <b>plain</b> <b>vanilla</b> <b>Swap.</b> In this qualitative note we review the problem trying to shed some light on this modern animal farm, recurring to an analogy with quantum physics, the Zeeman effect. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{document}} presents several Credit Risk tools {{which have}} been developed for the Credit Derivatives Risk Management. The models used in this context are suitable for the pricing, sensitivity/scenario analysis and the derivation of risk measures for <b>plain</b> <b>vanilla</b> credit default <b>swaps</b> (CDS), standardized and bespoke collateralized debt obligations (CDO) and, in general, for any credit risk exposed A/L portfolio.|$|R
40|$|The {{outstanding}} face {{amount of}} <b>plain</b> <b>vanilla</b> interest rate <b>swaps</b> exceeds two trillion dollars.

This characterization is not consistent with standardized swap contracts and the treatment of swaps in bankruptcy. This paper provides an alternative perspective on swaps.

40|$|In this research, we {{investigate}} {{the impact of}} stochastic volatility and interest rates on counterparty credit risk (CCR) for FX derivatives. To achieve this we analyse two real-life {{cases in which the}} market conditions are different, namely during the 2008 credit crisis where risks are high and a period after the crisis in 2014, where volatility levels are low. The Heston model is extended by adding two Hull–White components which are calibrated to fit the EURUSD volatility surfaces. We then present future exposure profiles and credit value adjustments (CVAs) for <b>plain</b> <b>vanilla</b> cross-currency <b>swaps</b> (CCYS), barrier and American options and compare the different results when Heston-Hull–White-Hull–White or Black–Scholes dynamics are assumed. It is observed that the stochastic volatility has a significant impact on all the derivatives. For CCYS, some of the impact can be reduced by allowing for time-dependent variance. We further confirmed that Barrier options exposure and CVA is highly sensitive to volatility dynamics and that American options’ risk dynamics are significantly affected by the uncertainty in the interest rates...|$|R
40|$|This project {{analyzes}} the spread arising from trading in two portfolios {{based on the}} European debt and interbank lending markets. The analysis uses data on sovereign credit default swap spreads, zero-coupon bond yields, European Interbank Offered Rate (EURIBOR) and Euro-denominated <b>plain</b> <b>vanilla</b> interest rate <b>swaps.</b> I focus on the countries that are most embroiled in the European debt crisis: Portugal, Italy, Greece and Spain. The first portfolio I study contains a long position in a 5 -year sovereign bond and long position in a sovereign credit default swap that expires in 5 -years. The second portfolio consists of rolling over 6 -month EURIBOR deposits and selling a 5 -year fixed-for-floating interest rate swap. The portfolios are theoretically equivalent in terms of cash flow, and the spread between these investment strategies {{can be viewed as}} the implied default risk involved in trading in the interbank market. The spread between the return earned from Portfolio 1 and Portfolio 2 is the implied cost of insuring a EURIBOR bank deposit...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{empirical}} performance of ve di erent models for barrier op- tion valuation is investigated: the Black-Scholes model, the constant elasticity of variance model, the Heston stochastic volatility model, the Merton jump-di usion model, and the in nite activity Variance Gamma model. We use time-series {{data from the}} USD/EUR exchange rate market: standard put and call (<b>plain</b> <b>vanilla)</b> option prices and {{a unique set of}} observed market values of barrier options. The models are calibrated to <b>plain</b> <b>vanilla</b> option prices, and prediction errors at dif- ferent horizons for <b>plain</b> <b>vanilla</b> and barrier option values are investigated. For <b>plain</b> <b>vanilla</b> options, the Heston and Merton models have similar and superior performance for prediction horizons up to one week.

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} static super-replicating strategies for European-type call options {{written on a}} weighted sum of asset prices. This class of exotic options includes Asian options and basket options among others. We assume that there exists a market where the <b>plain</b> <b>vanilla</b> options on the different assets are traded and hence their prices {{can be observed in}} the market. Both the infinite market case (where prices of the <b>plain</b> <b>vanilla</b> options are available for all strikes) and the finite market case (where only a finite number of <b>plain</b> <b>vanilla</b> option prices are observed) are considered. We prove that the finite market case converges to the infinite market case when the number of observed <b>plain</b> <b>vanilla</b> option prices tends to infinity. We show how to construct a portfolio consisting of the <b>plain</b> <b>vanilla</b> options on the different assets, whose pay-off super-replicates the pay-off of the exotic option. As a consequence, the price of the super-replicating portfolio is an upper bound for the price of the exotic option. The super-hedging strategy is model-free {{in the sense that it}} is expressed in terms of the observed option prices on the individual assets, which can be e. g.  dividend paying stocks with no explicit dividend process known. This paper is a generalization of the work of Simon et al. [Simon, S. Goovaerts, M. Dhaene, J. 2000. An easy computable upper bound for the price of an arithmetic Asian option. Insurance Math. Econom. 26 (2 - 3), 175 - 184] who considered this problem for Asian options in the infinite market case. Laurence and Wang [Laurence, P. Wang, T. H. 2004. What's a basket worth? Risk Mag. 17, 73 - 77] and Hobson et al. [Hobson, D. Laurence, P. Wang, T. H. 2005. Static-arbitrage upper bounds for the prices of basket options. Quant.  Fin. 5 (4), 329 - 342] considered this problem for basket options, in the infinite as well as in the finite market case. As opposed to Hobson et al. [Hobson, D. Laurence, P. Wang, T. H. 2005. Static-arbitrage upper bounds for the prices of basket options. Quant. Fin. 5 (4), 329 - 342] who use Lagrange optimization techniques, the proofs in this paper are based on the theory of integral stochastic orders and on the theory of comonotonic risks. © 2008 Elsevier B.
