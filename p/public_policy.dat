To evaluate the implementation of social media of the Hong Kong Government, including how the social media encourages public engagement in <b>public</b> <b>policies,</b> how and why the government employs the views collected from social media platforms in making <b>public</b> <b>policies,</b> framework of <b>Public</b> Involvement Spectrum in Local Governance put forward by the International Association for Public Participation (IAP 2), its adapted form developed by Lukensmeyer and Torres and case studies methodology will be applied in this dissertation. This dissertation sought to understand more on the implementation of social media by the Hong Kong Government and what strategy should be applied by the government in e-engagement. This study suggested that the Hong Kong Government tend to use social media to inform, involve and collect views from the public rather than empowering the public in making <b>public</b> <b>policies.</b> And the Hong Kong Government has successfully increased public awareness of certain <b>public</b> <b>policies</b> or issues through social media platform but the acceptance on certain policies or the support rating for the Government may not be benefited from the use of social media. Based on the analysis and observations from this study, it provides a useful and practical roadmap for future study and development of social media in e-engagement. published_or_final_versionPolitics and Public AdministrationMasterMaster of Public Administratio...|$|R
