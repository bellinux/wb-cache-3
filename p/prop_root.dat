5000|$|The Great Banyan tree is over 250 years old, and its date {{of birth}} is doubtful. {{there is no clear}} history of the tree as to the time of {{planting}} etc. but it is mentioned in many travel books of the nineteenth century as a very spectacular element. It survived two great cyclones in 1864 and 1867, when some of its main branches were broken. With its large number of aerial roots, which grow from the branches and run vertically to the ground and looks like it has so many trunks, The Great Banyan looks more like a forest than an individual tree. The tree survives without its main trunk, which decayed and had to be removed in 1925. A monument has been erected to the dead trunk, but is hardly accessible to visitors, who only have access to the perimeter of the tree. The area occupied by the tree is about [...] square metres (about 1.89 hectares or 4.67 acres). The present crown of the tree has a circumference of 486 m. and the highest branch rises to 24.5 m; it has at present 3772 aerial roots reaching down to the ground as a <b>prop</b> <b>root.</b> It's height is almost equivalent to Gate way of India.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{estimates}} of fish density among the prop {{roots of the}} red mangrove,Rhizophora mangle, have varied widely, and assessment techniques used are often detrimental to the habitat. This study outlines a method for assessing estuarine fish densities among prop roots of overwash forests that greatly reduces the detrimental environmental effects of sampling in this habitat. Minnow seines were used to surround small overwash forests at high tide, such that fish were trapped in the nets as water receded. More fish species {{were present in the}} open water areas adjacent to mangrove stands than among the prop roots. Densities and distribution patterns of roots and hydrophysical characteristics measured at the overwash forests were not correlated with the density of fish inhabiting those sites. Fish density was correlated positively with species richness among small mangrove overwash forests. Similarity in species composition of fish assemblages was higher between <b>prop</b> <b>root</b> and open-water habitats sampled in this study than similar estuarine habitats examined previously. Estimates of fish density varied greatly between samples, however, suggesting high variability in habitat use among fish species inhabiting red mangrove overwash forests...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} temporal changes in mangrove root fouling species settled on artificial substrates in the mangrove zone of the Port Royal lagoons and to determine the effect of stress as part of a larger project to determine appropriate indicators of eutrophication in mangrove lagoons. Five Perspex© panels were suspended in the <b>prop</b> <b>root</b> zone at five contrasting stations within the Port Royal mangroves and the fouling organisms were monitored fortnightly using underwater digital photography. Nine taxonomic categories of epibionts were recorded of which the most prevalent group was the ascidians. Barnacles and hydroids were initially found to have established on the artificial substrates at all stations but were quickly replaced by ascidians and bryozoans at most. Species composition was similar between all stations by the end of the study, however, the dominant taxa were different. Sheltered lagoons like Fort Rocky lagoon (north and south) had a clear dominance of non-shelled species (ascidians and polychaetes) by the end of the study, while molluscs- bivalves and barnacles dominated Hurricane Refuge lagoon. This station, deemed to be experiencing greatest stress due to exposure to the eutrophic Kingston Harbour, also had the greatest proportion of shelled taxa represented in the epibiont biomass at the end of the study. Differences in biomass and species composition of root fouling species can therefore be used to indicate water quality in the mangrove lagoons...|$|E
40|$|Coastal salt {{marshes and}} {{mangroves}} are both intertidal habitats that, relative to unvegetated habitat, provide increased food, shelter and a nursery function to fish. Patch structural complexity and connectivity can influence assemblage structure across multiple spatial scales, {{and should be}} taken into account when assessing the effectiveness of marine reserves. We tested the hypothesis that fish assemblage density and species richness of the 2 habitats would be strongly associated with similar patch complexity-, connectivity- and physically-based variables (37 variables assessed) in a replicated investigation of 10 Indonesian mangrove and 9 European salt marsh habitats. Salt marsh and mangrove fish assemblage density and species richness (4. 95 and 111. 5 ind. 100 m - 2; 13 and 64 species for salt marshes and mangroves, respectively) showed significant variation between patches, and were influenced by different spatial variables. Patch shape (increased circularity) was the most highly influential variable in both habitats associated with enhanced fish species richness and density. <b>Prop</b> <b>root</b> density and number of mangrove patches within 1 km radial extent were strongly positively correlated with mangrove fish species richness, and patch isolation was negatively correlated with density. Salt marsh fish assemblage structure was negatively correlated with intertidal mudflat extent, patch seaward edge length and patch depth. The role of habitat mosaics was less important in structuring salt marsh fish than mangrove fish assemblages. Different spatial factors must be integrated when considering the role of coastal fringing habitats as fish nursery sites, and to maximize their conservation value, salt marsh and mangrove habitats may require different management approaches. © Inter-Research 2012...|$|E

The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency's (JAXA) Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) L-band Phased Array Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR), launched successfully in January 2006, will provide new data sets for coastal ecosystems mapping and change monitoring at local to global scales. 2. To evaluate L-band capability for mangrove applications, data {{acquired by the}} NASA airborne SAR (AIRSAR) and Japanese Earth Resources Satellite (JERS- 1 SAR) over sites in Australia, French Guiana and Malaysia were used to demonstrate benefits for mapping extent and zones, retrieving biomass and structural attributes (e. g. height), and detecting change. 3. The research indicates that mapping is most effective where mangroves border non-forested areas and where differences in structure, {{as a function of}} species, growth stage and biomass distributions, occur between zones. 4. Using L-band SAR, biomass can be retrieved up to ? 100 ? 140 Mg ha? 1, although retrieval is complicated by a noticeable decrease in L-band backscattering coefficient within higher (?> 200 Mg ha? 1) biomass stands, particularly those with extensive <b>prop</b> <b>root</b> systems. 5.

40|$|Abstract. The use of {{mangrove}} <b>prop</b> <b>roots</b> {{and associated}} coralline habitats by Caribbean spiny lobsters was investigated near {{two types of}} mangrove islands in Belize. Spiny lobsters sheltered among mangrove <b>prop</b> <b>roots,</b> in undercut peat banks and under corals near islands, and they ranged in size from newly recruited juveniles to subadults. Lobsters prefened to shelter under large stony corals, but their use of mangrove <b>prop</b> <b>roots</b> nd undercut peat banks increased when the density of corals was low. Den residence time and distance moved within a site were similar at islands isolated by deep water channels and islands separated by shallow seagrass beds, but {{as a consequence of}} high immigration rates, population sizes were highest near shallow islands. Predation on newly settled juveniles was greater in seagrass and coral crevices than in mangrove <b>prop</b> <b>roots,</b> whereas the survival of largerjuveniles was higher in mangroves and coral patch reefs than in seagrass. These results suggest that mangrove habitats may function as a nursery for juvenile spiny lobsters but that the use of this habitat depends on shelter characteristics and the isolation of islands...|$|R

40|$|For {{sustainable}} management of mangrove ecosystems, {{there is a}} pressing need to increase our knowledge of fish and invertebrates associated with this system. This study sampled microhabitats (89 â€“ 258  m 2) inside the mangrove forest at Pagbilao, the Philippines, on two consecutive spring tides using stake nets. Distribution patterns of shrimps and fish were compared among four microhabitats that differed in dominant mangrove species (Avicennia marina, A. officinalis or Rhizophora apiculata), structural complexity of the root system, and proximity to open water habitat. A 5 to 6 -year-old replanted Rhizophora microhabitat was also sampled to study faunal recolonization following replantation. The mean (Â±SE) density of the shrimp community was 1 Â· 5 Â± 0 Â· 2 shrimps m âˆ’ 2, dominated by Palaemonidae, followed by Acetes sp., Penaeus merguiensis and Metapenaeus ensis. The highest shrimp density was observed in the replanted Rhizophora habitat, which also had the highest structural complexity.

40|$|Here I {{provide the}} first report on Geukensia granosissima {{patterns}} of abundance along a tidal gradient within a mixed mangrove stand located in Tampa Bay, Florida, USA. Specifically, I examined 1) the relationship between G. granosissima size and density with mangrove root type (e. g. <b>prop</b> <b>root,</b> pneumatophore), and of density within the intertidal zones; and 2) the possible role of predation in shaping the lower zonation patterns displayed. Transect surveys located along the lower and upper population limit boundaries were conducted every two months over a ten-month period. Variables measured include size distribution, density of mussels, above ground mangrove prop and pneumatophore roots. To evaluate potential predator influence on mussel distribution, predator exclusion experiments were conducted in March and June 2016, using mock pneumatophore platforms at both high and low tidal elevations. Surveys indicated that over all dates mean mussel densities and percent cover were higher along the lower limit tidal elevation [mean (± SD) = 1280. 3 ± 665. 9 m- 2 and 20. 6 ± 3. 78 % respectively], versus that in the higher limit tidal elevation [102. 4 ± 50. 7 m- 2 and 0. 52 ± 0. 17 %]. Survivorship of mussels in the predator exclusion platforms placed at higher position within lower edge of the mussel tidal distribution was approximately 100 % on both experimental dates. During March 2016, mussel survivorship was lower when predators had access to mussels with the greatest loss of mussels in the lower (26 % survivorship) vs. higher (66. 5 %) tidal elevations after 48 h. Similarly, when predators had access to mussels in June experiments, after just 24 h mussel loss was greater at lower (1 % survivorship) vs. higher (80 % survivorship) tidal elevations, possibly reflecting differences in predator densities, identities, and/or functional responses. Overall trends in the patterns of distribution of this population of G. granosissima suggest that the lower tidal boundary of the mussel is shaped by predation but that predation plays a lesser role in the high tidal areas...|$|E

40|$|Recognised as 'Essential Fish Habitat', red {{mangrove}} (Rhizophora mangle) has received much attention {{in recent years}} to assess its nursery function. Research suggests that mangrove habitat contributes significantly to coral reef fish populations. Not all mangrove is utilised to its full capacity by juvenile fish, and it may be that, in terms of fisheries sustainability and enhancement, the use of management resources for mangrove habitat protection could be more judiciously targeted on the basis of preferred habitat use. In order to establish the factors influencing fish distribution in Rhizophora mangle, fish populations were studied in a Bahamian tidal lagoon. Biotopic, hydrophysical, structural and biological influences were investigated in natural {{red mangrove}} habitat, and by experimental manipulation of artificial mangrove units (AMUs). Reef fish were distributed unevenly over various spatial scales, indicating preferences in some species for particular lagoon biotopes, and various physical and biological characteristics inmangrove <b>prop</b> <b>root</b> habitat. With the exception of tidal flow, other physical attributes such as salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen and water depth had limited influence on fish distribution. In natural mangrove habitat the degree of shade appeared {{to be the most important}} factor in attracting fish to mangrove habitat followed by habitat complexity and epiphytic algae biomass. Variations in preference for these attributes between species and size classes suggested that no single attribute was exclusively responsible for a particular locational preference. Experimental manipulations of AMUs indicated a preference for greater shade and root density up to a certain level after which no preference was shown. Preferences varied between species and size classes and also with increased vulnerability to predation. Red mangrove trees perform a number of important functions on tropical and sub-tropical coastlines. They stabilise and protect: the coastline against erosion. supply nutrients to other coastal habitats, and provide habitat for many avian and terrestrial species.
