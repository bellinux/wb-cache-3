2500|$|Microalgae {{production}} {{also includes}} {{the ability to use}} saline waste or waste [...] streams as an energy source. [...] This opens a new strategy to produce biofuel in conjunction with waste water treatment, while being able to produce clean water as a byproduct. [...] When used in a microalgal bioreactor, harvested microalgae will capture significant quantities of organic compounds as well as heavy metal contaminants absorbed from wastewater streams that would otherwise be directly discharged into surface and ground-water. [...] Moreover, this process also allows the recovery of phosphorus from waste, which is an essential but scarce element in nature – the reserves of which are estimated to have depleted in the last 50 years. [...] Another possibility is the use of algae production systems to clean up non-point source pollution, in a system known as an algal turf scrubber (ATS). [...] This has been demonstrated to reduce nitrogen and phosphorus levels in rivers and other large bodies of water affected by eutrophication, and systems are being built that will be capable of processing up to 110 million liters of water per day.

The main pollutants are DO-consumption organic pollutants such as ammonia nitrogen and phosphorus.

Olive Mill Waste Water is the principle <b>point</b> <b>source</b> water <b>pollution</b> in different territories across the Mediterranean. OMWW is a secondary product produced during the production of Olive Oil. Due to the lack of consistent method to evaluate <b>point</b> <b>source</b> of <b>pollution</b> generated by OMWW on a river basin scale, the current research relies on a quantifiable approach to assess OMWW as <b>point</b> <b>source</b> water <b>pollution</b> on sub-catchment level. Current methodology utilizes Geographic Information System (GIS) modelling to classify within a watershed individual sub-catchment risk of water pollution occurring from olive mill waste discharges. The research presents the proposed criteria and calculations required to estimate sub-catchment risk significance and comments on the methods potential for wider application. This research combines elements from risk assessment frameworks Multi Criteria Analysis (MCA) and GIS. MCA helped in aggregating different aspects and elements associated with this environmental problem, while GIS modelling tools helped in obtaining many criterion values and providing insight into how different objects interact in the nature and how these interactions influence risk at the watershed level.

40|$|This {{study has}} {{attempted}} to model and quantify the impacts of Beneficial Management Practices (BMP) like buffer strips on the phosphorus concentration and loading in the Buck Creek Watershed of Central Indiana. The GIS based modeling was done using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) developed by the U. S. Department of Agriculture-Agricultural Research Services (USDA-ARS). The results from the EPA funded two year (2002 - 2004) Upper White River Watershed Project (UWRWP) for the Buck Creek Watershed were used as the measured base data for the modeling evaluation. These measured data were compared against the data generated out of the model simulation based on two different scenarios which took into consideration the combinations of land use, agricultural management practices, <b>point</b> <b>source</b> <b>pollutions</b> and BMPs. Scenario- 1 simulated all the aspects of land use intensity, moderate agricultural management practices and moderate <b>point</b> <b>source</b> <b>pollutions</b> {{taking place in the}} Buck Creek watershed. While running the model in scenario- 1, there was a noticeable increase in the phosphorus loading to the sub-watersheds ranging from 10 % in the lowland sub-watershed of BC- 4 to 39 % in the highland sub-watershed of BC- 7. In scenario- 2, BMPs were implemented in the model which added 100 acres of vegetated buffer strips uniformly in all sub-watersheds and 3 acres of grassed buffers along the streams except BC- 3. On re-running the model in scenario- 2, there was a drastic decline in the phosphorus loading to the stream. It has been noted that there was at least 15 % reduction in the loading of phosphorus to the stream where buffer strips were implemented. The present GIS modeling study helped to quantify the changes in the loading of sediments and nutrients which are induced by any parametric changes in the watershed including soil, slope, land use, agricultural management practices and BMPs.
