50|$|In the UK, the DPM Smock, Parachutist's {{began to}} replace the Denison smock (beginning in 1977), {{to the chagrin of}} most of their owners, and all the Denisons had {{disappeared}} before the Falklands War of 1982. The new DPM replacement was not constructed of the Denison’s heavyweight twill, but was instead made from the same cotton material as the ’68-Pattern combat jacket. However, it was cut like the Denison smock, with smaller Newey <b>press-stud</b> (snap) fastened (but now bellowed) pockets, a full length zip without buttons down the front, the traditional olive green knitted wool cuffs, and a 'crotch flap' {{on the outside of the}} back.|$|E
50|$|For users {{determined}} {{to continue to}} get use out of their units, there are ways of keeping them working. Detailed plans on making Zeo-compatible replacement headband sensors were published and widely reported. Users had reported before the company closed that disposable adhesive gel ECG electrodes with offset <b>press-stud</b> connections worked successfully, better than the Zeo headband. Software and procedures were made available to store sleep data without the encryption used by Zeo, and to display historical sleep data, a service previously available only by uploading data to the MyZeo Web site. Some software which had been available from Zeo to developers, while no longer available from the discontinued Zeo Web site or the Wayback machine, was circulated; for example a data decoder library. During the company's existence ZeoScope software using the decoder library, which allowed the Zeo {{to be used as}} a biofeedback device with EEG display and functionality related to lucid dreaming, had been written by an independent developer and distributed without charge under the Apache licence; it did not use facilities of the Zeo Web site, and continued to work after the company closed.|$|E

30|$|The {{resistance}} of the clinched joints decreases over time due to ageing in salt spray environment. The trends, at first, show a linear increase of the load. In this phase, the joint resistance is due both to the friction resistance, resulting from the contact pressure between the aluminium and steel sheets induced by forced mechanical joining. In this linear region, the maximum slope of the load/displacement curve is reached. After this phase, the activation of damage mechanisms of the joint occurs. In particular, the samples, at low ageing time, lose gradually their stiffness. This {{is due to a}} bending effect {{at the edge of the}} sheets in the overlapping area. After that, the maximum load value is reached, and the mechanical stability of the joints is critically prejudiced. Then, the slope of the load/displacement curve becomes negative with a gradual reduction of load, thus confirming that the mechanical interlocking is compromised. The joints subsequently open as a <b>press-stud,</b> such rupture occurs in the most of the clinched joints (Varis 2006). The ageing treatment reduces significantly the performances of the joint giving rise premature failure mechanisms induced by localized corrosion phenomena. At long ageing times, where the joint presents an advanced state of degradation, breakages in the neck of the joint both on the aluminium side and on the steel one could occur.|$|E
