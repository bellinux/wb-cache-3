40|$|Total {{catches of}} {{fish from the}} wild reached a plateau in the early 1990 s. Capture fishery {{production}} for both food and non-food utilization has levelled off. There is need for aquaculture expansion and improved output. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the most productive facility for production of Heterobranchus bidorsalis. H. bidorsalis is the most important species from the genus Heterobranchus. It is endemic to Africa. Seven hundred H. bidorsalis fingerlings were acclimatized for 7 days, 200 fingerlings were randomly selected and stocked in: Earthen ponds, Concrete <b>tanks,</b> and <b>Plastic</b> <b>tanks</b> labelled as T 1, T 2 and T 3 respectively. Each treatment had two replicates, 100 fingerlings in each. The culture facilities were constructed to have water volume which was not significantly different. The earthen ponds, concrete and <b>plastic</b> <b>tanks</b> water volume was maintained at 2, 320 litres, 2, 304 litres, and 2, 331 litres respectively. Fingerlings were fed with 2 mm Coppens of 45 % crude protein at 5 % biomass. Feeding was carried out at 9 : 00 and 16 : 00 hours for 56 days. All treatments were given equal care. Final Standard Length, Final Total Length, Total Length Gain, Final weight Gain and Weight Gain recorded were: 13. 04 ± 0. 57, 13. 44 ± 0. 75, 32 ± 0. 96, 4. 45 ± 1. 34, 30. 36 ± 1. 13 and 23. 34 ± 2. 4 respectively. Growth was significantly higher in T 1. In concrete and <b>plastic</b> <b>tanks,</b> observed growth parameters recorded had the following values: 11. 75 ± 0. 82 and 11. 21 ± 0. 83, 12. 31 ± 0. 85 and 11. 95 ± 0. 89, 3. 2 ± 0. 96 and 2. 84 ± 0. 85, 22. 24 ± 2. 78 and 21. 24 ± 5. 84, and 14. 85 ± 1. 7 and 14. 99 ± 1. 02 for Final Standard Length, Final Total Length, Total Length Gain, Final Weight and Weight Gain respectively. There was no significance difference in growth between T 2 and T 3. The study did not discourage the use of concrete <b>tanks</b> and <b>plastic</b> <b>tanks</b> for H. bidorsalis culture, but considered earthen ponds as most ideal culture facility for yields optimization in H. bidorsalis...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This study {{investigated}} the number of Aedes larvae, the key breeding sites of Aedes sp., {{and the relationship between}} climatic factors and the incidence of DHF in Samui Islands. We conducted our questionnaire and larval surveys from randomly selected 105 households in Samui Islands in July-September 2006. Pearson’s correlation coefficient was used to explore the primary association between the DHF incidence and all climatic factors. Multiple stepwise regression technique was then used to fit the statistical model. The results showed that the positive indoor containers were small jars, cement <b>tanks,</b> and <b>plastic</b> <b>tanks.</b> The positive outdoor containers were small jars, cement <b>tanks,</b> <b>plastic</b> <b>tanks,</b> used cans, tires, plastic bottles, discarded objects, pot saucers, plant pots, and areca husks. All Ae. albopictus larval indices (i. e., CI, HI, and BI) were higher than Ae. aegypti larval indices in this area. These larval indices were higher than WHO standard. This indicated a high risk of DHF transmission at Samui Islands. The multiple stepwise regression model was y = – 288. 80 + 11. 024 xmean temp. The mean temperature was positively associated with the DHF incidence in this area. Keywords—Dengue vectors, Aedes aegypti, Aedes albopictus...|$|R
