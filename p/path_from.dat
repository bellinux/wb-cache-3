5|$|From Thirlspot two routes lead up Helvellyn. The old pony route took a {{very safe}} and steady route {{for the benefit of}} early visitors, who took horses and a guide from the inn.

Its remnants later affected Alaska.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — We propose {{and analyze}} a new finger {{replacement}} technique that is applicable for RAKE receivers {{in the soft}} handover (SHO) region. More specifically, the receiver uses in the SHO region by default the strongest <b>paths</b> <b>from</b> the serving base station (BS) and only when the combined signal-to-noise ratio falls below a certain pre-determined threshold, the receiver uses more resolvable <b>paths</b> <b>from</b> the target BS to improve the performance. Instead of changing the configuration for all fingers, the receiver just compares {{the sum of the}} weakest paths out of the currently connected <b>paths</b> <b>from</b> the serving BS with the sum of the strongest <b>paths</b> <b>from</b> the target BS and selects the better group. Using accurate statistical analysis, we investigate in this letter the tradeoff between error performance, average number of required path comparisons, and SHO overhead offered by this newly proposed scheme.

Across the Philippines, 90 people {{were killed by the}} typhoon and an estimated 120,000 people were left homeless. Though a weaker storm when it struck China, damage was more severe due to extensive flooding. Several coastal cities were completely inundated. Throughout the country, at least 200 people died and losses reached 1.2billion yuan ($319million USD). Additionally, 14 people drowned offshore and 2 others died in Hong Kong.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Storm Allison {{was a major}} flood {{disaster}} {{throughout its}} <b>path</b> <b>from</b> Texas to the Mid-Atlantic. The worst of the flooding occurred in Houston, Texas, where over 35inches (890mm) of rain fell. Allison caused over $9billion in damage (2001USD, $12billion 2014USD), making it the costliest tropical storm on record in the United States. The storm also killed 41people directly, including 27 who drowned. This ties Allison with a tropical storm in 1917 as the second-deadliest tropical storm to affect the US; only surpassed by the 1925 Florida tropical storm which killed 73people.|$|E

5|$|A {{factor that}} {{influences}} the directional stability of a bike is wheelbase, the horizontal {{distance between the}} ground contact points of {{the front and rear}} wheels. For a given displacement of the front wheel, due to some disturbance, the angle of the resulting <b>path</b> <b>from</b> the original is inversely proportional to wheelbase. Also, the radius of curvature for a given steer angle and lean angle is proportional to the wheelbase. Finally, the wheelbase increases when the bike is leaned and steered. In the extreme, when the lean angle is 90°, and the bike is steered in the direction of that lean, the wheelbase is increased by the radius of the front and rear wheels.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{hurricane}} remained near the coastline, Hurricane David failed to cause extreme damage in Florida. The storm's winds shattered windows in stores near {{the coast and}} caused property damage, including blowing {{the frame of the}} Palm Beach Jai Alai fronton and downing the 186-foot (57-m) WJNO AM radio tower in West Palm Beach into the Intracoastal Waterway. A few roofs were torn off, and numerous buildings were flooded from over six inches (150 mm) of rainfall. A 450-foot (140-m) crane was even snapped in two at the St. Lucie Nuclear Power Plant. The hurricane spawned over 10 tornadoes while passing over the state, though none caused deaths or injuries. Total damages in Florida amounted to $95 million ($270 million in 2005 USD), of which $30 million occurred in Palm Beach County, mostly from crop damage. Two journalists with TODAY newspaper from Brevard County followed {{the hurricane}} <b>path</b> <b>from</b> South Florida to Cocoa, FL and experienced extremely high winds as they reported on the hurricane.|$|E
5|$|Much {{of what is}} now MD291 was {{constructed}} as two different highways. MD291 proper ran from MD290 near Chesterville through Millington to the Delaware state line. MD447 connected US213 in Chestertown and MD290 in Chesterville, using MD291's current corridor from Chestertown to Morgnec and a more northerly <b>path</b> <b>from</b> Morgnec to Chesterville. MD291 {{was constructed}} as a concrete road from Millington to the Delaware state line in 1929 and 1930; the portion of River Road on which MD290 runs concurrently with MD291 was paved in concrete in the same time span. The concrete highway was extended west from Millington to Mills Branch in two sections, the eastern part completed in 1933 and the western segment built in 1934 and 1935. Kent County included the portion of River Road between MD290 and Mills Branch as its top priority in the post-war construction program; that segment was surfaced and brought into the state highway system as an extension of MD291 in 1946.|$|E
