5|$|A police {{investigation}} was initiated in October 1971 to uncover any criminal action {{taken by the}} company.

The {{police investigation}} quickly established that there were shortcomings in Trans Polar's bookkeeping {{and that there were}} several violations of aviation regulations. However, they police had difficulty establishing who was responsible in the company. As Tjøntveit was no longer a Norwegian citizen, he was prohibited from holding management and board positions in the airline. Still, it was obvious that he had been calling the shots. Because NOA could not obtain Scandinavian operating permits, it moved its operations to Bangladesh—hindering the <b>police</b> <b>from</b> interviewing Tjøntveit and other central managers in Trans Polar who had joined the new airline. The police also stated that the investigation took too long because they had too few investigators with expertise in financial crime.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in February 2011, Bahrain saw {{sustained}} pro-democracy protests, centered at Pearl Roundabout in {{the capital}} of Manama, as part of the wider Arab Spring. Authorities responded with a night raid on 17 February (later known as Bloody Thursday), which left four protesters dead and more than 300 injured. Protests continued for a month reaching over 100,000 participants in a nation of about 500,000 citizens, until more than a thousand troops and <b>police</b> <b>from</b> the Gulf Cooperation Council arrived at the request of government and a three-month state of emergency was declared.

5|$|By July 1923, The Advertiser {{newspaper}} was reporting that Leane's approach over his {{three years at}} the helm had made {{a significant difference in}} the administration of the South Australia Police, explaining that Leane had dispensed with seniority as the basis for promotion, by substituting merit and efficiency, as well as selecting candidates who displayed qualities of sympathy and tact in dealing with the public.

5|$|During Pryer's {{tenure of}} being the first {{resident}} of Sandakan, one of his first tasks was to establish law and order.

5|$|In {{ex parte}} Hosenball, Lord Denning {{referred}} to Lord Reid's comments in R. v.

5|$|Many popular novels were {{published}} about the mounted <b>police</b> <b>from</b> 1885 onwards, {{and in the}} 20th century over 250 films were made, along with radio and television portrayals.

Historians, working from initially limited public records and chronicles, wrote similarly eulogistic accounts of the mounted police, but as new archives became available in the 1970s, more critical and analytic accounts of the force were produced. The force heavily influenced public perceptions of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, which used the North-West Mounted Police's image and history {{to help make the}} modern police a popular Canadian national symbol.|$|E
