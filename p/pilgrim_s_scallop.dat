During the past decade, the {{market share of}} imported scallops has increased drastically. The scallop fishery in the U. S. is now facing potential competitions from imports. Continuing efforts to provide information {{on the effect of}} increasing imports on the U. <b>S.</b> <b>scallop</b> market is warranted. In addition, the impacts of supply increases on domestic scallop prices, either through wild stock enhancement programs or aquaculture operations, merit further investigation. An Annington model is developed in this study to assess the demand for scallops in the United States. Time series data for 1980 - 1998 are used in the estimation of the model. Results indicate that the demand for U. <b>S.</b> domestic <b>scallops</b> is less elastic in the short run than in the long run.

Poseban je naglasak stavljen na prikaz mogućnosti kontroliranog uzgoja školjkaša u bočatim vodama ušća. U ušću rijeke Krke utvrđeno je 56 svojti iz 27 porodica. Najrasprostranjenije su ove svojte: dagnja (Mytilus galloprovincialis), kamenica (Ostrea edulis), a česte su: jestiva srčanka (Cerastoderma glaucum), prnjavica (Venus verrucosa), kućica (Tapes decussatus), kunjka (Arca noae), mala kapica (Chlamys varia) i jakovska kapica (Pecten jacobaeus). Izlov prirodnih populacija školjkaša za prehranu tradicionalna je djelatnost i procjenjuje se na 100 tona u godini. Istraživanja mogućnosti kontroliranog uzgoja dagnje, kamenice, male kapice i jakovske kapice rezultirala su razvojem tehnologija konroliranog uzgoja dagnje i kamenice 1983., a jakovske kapice i male kapice godine 1989. Danas je proizvodnja organizirana na 25 lokaliteta, ukupne površine 87. 142 m 2, s mogućnošću proizvodnje oko 1. 500 tona dagnji i deset tisuća kamenica, a mogla bi se povećati iznad 10. 000 tona. Krka River {{spring is}} {{at the foot of}} Dinara mountain, {{starting}} from a 22 m high Topoljski waterfall. Its length is 72. 5 km, and total slope 242 m. The length of freshwater waterway is 49 km and brackish waterway, i. e. flooded river mouth, 23. 5 km long. Impact of seawater and depth of surface fresh water greatly vary depending on the river waterlevel, local precipitation, tides and wind directions. Owing to the extensive primary production in the river mouth shellfish are abundantly present with 56 species. The most abundant are Mediterranean mussel (Mytilus galloprouincialis) and flat oyster (Ostrea edulis), and partly common cockle (Cerastoderma glaucum), Venus shell (Venus verucosa), calico clam (Tapes decussates), Noah 2 ̆ 7 s arc (Arca noae), variegated scallop (Chlamis uaria) and Pilgrim 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>scallop</b> (Pecten jacobaeus). Owing to very productive processes in the ecosystem of river mouth, fishing in the area is traditionally practice. The knowledge about natural populations of Mediterranean mussel fished out in quantities larger than 100 t/y have initiated the research on since 1979 shellfish in this area. Investigations on possibilities of commercial farming of Mediterranean mussel, flat oyster, variegated scallop and Pilgrim 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>scallop</b> (Pecten jacobaeus) resulted in defining the technological procedure for commercial farming of Mediterranean mussel and flat oyster (1983), and variegated scallop and Pilgrim 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>scallop</b> (1989).

30|$|In 2005, {{work from}} Pan and colleagues {{provided}} the critical {{link between the}} Hippo cascade and gene expression. Using a yeast two-hybrid approach with Warts as bait, {{they were able to}} identify the transcription co-activator Yorkie (Yki) as a downstream target of Hippo signaling [12]. Subsequent work demonstrated that Yorkie is a direct substrate of Warts and that Yorkie promotes cell proliferation and growth. Importantly, inactivation of Yorkie was sufficient to prevent the overgrowth phenotype observed in Hippo pathway mutants, indicating that Yorkie is the major downstream effector of the pathway [12],[13]. Yorkie itself lacks the ability to bind DNA directly and therefore influences gene expression through its interaction with the transcription factor <b>Scalloped</b> (<b>Sd)</b> [14]-[17]. <b>Scalloped</b> was demonstrated to mediate Yorkie-triggered overgrowth; however, overexpression of Scalloped alone did not elicit overgrowth, suggesting that Yorkie regulation is the critical factor for determining gene expression downstream of Hippo signaling [14].|$|R

40|$|The primary {{objective}} of this Master s thesis was to study if organic waste particles released from cage fish farms could be assimilated by the great scallop (P. maximus) through a laboratory trial and a field trial. In the laboratory experiment, scallops were co-fed salmon feed or salmon feces with algae at two different concentrations for 25 days. In the field study, scallops were installed in the sea for 3 months at four experimental stations close to a fish farm at the coast of western Norway (Florø). The laboratory trial showed that phytoplankton {{was the most important}} part of the <b>scallop</b> <b>s</b> diet, resulting in better growth and condition. Scallops co-fed salmon feed or feces showed higher concentrations of 18 : 1 (n- 9) in the digestive gland tissues compared to scallops fed algae alone. This suggested that scallops have utilized salmon feed and feces, due to the high amounts of 18 : 1 (n- 9) in the supplemented feed. The scallops in the laboratory trial were found to incorporate phytoplankton over salmon feed and feces as long as algae were present in high amount. Less selectivity was observed when phytoplankton concentration was low. The field study showed that the fatty acid signature in scallop digestive gland tissues, and to some degree gonad tissues, had high fractions of specific fatty acids found in high concentrations in diatoms (16 : 0, 16 : 1 n- 7, EPA) and dinoflagellates (16 : 0, 18 : 4 n- 3, EPA, DHA). This suggested that phytoplankton was an important part of the <b>scallop</b> <b>s</b> diet. <b>Scallops</b> cultivated under the influence of waste particles from the fish farm incorporated a higher fraction of 18 : 1 (n- 9) compared to the Reference stations.

40|$|SummaryThe Hippo (Hpo) kinase cascade restricts {{tissue growth}} by inactivating the {{transcriptional}} coactivator Yorkie (Yki), which regulates {{the expression of}} target genes such as the cell death inhibitor diap 1 by unknown mechanisms. Here we identify the TEAD/TEF family protein <b>Scalloped</b> (<b>Sd)</b> as a DNA-binding transcription factor that partners with Yki to mediate the transcriptional output of the Hpo growth-regulatory pathway. The diap 1 (th) locus harbors a minimal Sd-binding Hpo Responsive Element (HRE) that mediates transcriptional regulation by the Hpo pathway. Sd binds directly to Yki, and a Yki missense mutation that abrogates Sd-Yki binding also inactivates Yki function in vivo. We further demonstrate that sd is required for yki-induced tissue overgrowth and target gene expression, and that sd activity is conserved in its mammalian homolog.

30|$|The context {{specificity}} of Ey-dependent growth {{suggests that there}} are different signaling pathways in the different disc regions that modulate the effect of Ey overexpression on tissue growth. <b>Scalloped</b> (<b>Sd),</b> a component of the Hippo signaling pathway, is highly expressed in the pouch of the wing disc and very weakly expressed in the notum region (Campbell et al., 1992). To determine whether Sd may contribute to the context-dependent growth of Ey in wing disc, we examined the effect of expressing Sd with Ey. Coexpression of Sd with Ey significantly inhibited the ability of Ey to promote cell growth in the notum region (Fig.  1 E). In addition, coexpression of Sd with Ey can also inhibit cell growth in the pouch and hinge regions as shown by decreased clone size (Fig.  1 E). Therefore Sd can antagonize the ability of Ey to promote cell growth and the high level of Sd in the wing pouch region potentially contributes to the inability of Ey to promote growth in the pouch.|$|R

During larval stages, {{a dramatic increase in}} size and cell number of Drosophila wing imaginal discs is controlled by the action of several signaling pathways. Complex cross-talk between these pathways also pattern these discs to specify different regions with different fates and growth potentials. We show that the Notch signaling pathway is both required and sufficient to inhibit the activity of Yorkie (Yki), the Salvador/Warts/Hippo (SWH) pathway terminal transcription activator, but only in the central regions of the wing disc, where the TEAD factor and Yki partner <b>Scalloped</b> (<b>Sd)</b> is expressed. We show that this cross-talk between the Notch and SWH pathways is mediated, at least in part, by the Notch target and Sd partner Vestigial (Vg). We propose that, by altering the ratios between Yki, Sd and Vg, Notch pathway activation restricts the effects of Yki mediated transcription, therefore contributing to define a zone of low proliferation in the central wing discs...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe Hippo {{signaling}} pathway restricts organ size by inactivating the Yorkie (Yki) /Yes-associated protein (YAP) family proteins. The oncogenic Yki/YAP transcriptional coactivator family promotes tissue growth by activating target gene transcription, but {{the regulation of}} Yki/YAP activation remains elusive. In mammalian cells, we identified Brg 1, a major subunit of chromatin-remodeling SWI/SNF family proteins, which interacts with YAP. This finding led us to investigate the in vivo functional interaction of Yki and Brahma (Brm), the Drosophila homolog of Brg 1. We found that Brm functions at the downstream of Hippo pathway and interacts with Yki and <b>Scalloped</b> (<b>Sd)</b> to promotes Yki-dependent transcription and tissue growth. Furthermore, we demonstrated that Brm {{is required for the}} Crumbs (Crb) dysregulation-induced Yki activation. Interestingly, we also found that crb is a downstream target of Yki–Brm complex. Brm physically binds to the promoter of crb and regulates its transcription through Yki. Together, we showed that Brm functions as a critical regulator of Hippo signaling during tissue growth and {{plays an important role in}} the feedback loop between Crb and Yki...|$|R
