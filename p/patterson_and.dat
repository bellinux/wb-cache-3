The rest of NY39 became part of NY52 from East Fishkill to the western fringe of <b>Patterson,</b> <b>and</b> NY311 {{for the rest of}} the routing. In 1934, US202 was designated by AASHO. In order to avoid a numbering conflict, NY202 was renumbered to NY376.|$|E

5|$|The West Indies won {{the first}} two Tests {{in a similar manner}} with England {{struggling}} with the bowling of Patrick <b>Patterson</b> <b>and</b> Marshall.
