5|$|Following {{the quake}} {{a program of}} {{rebuilding}} was rapidly put into action, but before it began in earnest some important decisions would permanently differentiate many Sicilian cities and towns from other European urban developments. The Viceroy, the Duke of Camastra, aware of new trends in town planning, decreed that rather than rebuilding in the medieval plan of cramped narrow streets, the new rebuilding would offer piazze and wider main streets, often on a rational grid system. The whole plan was often to take a geometric shape such as a <b>perfect</b> <b>square</b> or a hexagon, typical of Renaissance and Baroque town planning. The city of Grammichele represents an example of these new cities rebuilted with a hexagonal plan.|$|E

40|$|Introduction A <b>perfect</b> <b>squared</b> {{square of}} order n is a square {{dissected}} into {{a finite number}} n of squares no {{two of which are}} of equal size. It is called compound if it contains a subset of component squares, more than one and less than all, arranged in a rectangle or a square. If it does not contain such subset it is called simple. The very first Simple <b>Perfect</b> <b>Squared</b> Square of this Catalogue was discovered by computer in March, 1978, by Duijvestijn. It has the lowest possible order, n = 21, and it {{is the only one of}} that order. In July of the same year, Duijvestijn found two simple <b>perfect</b> <b>squared</b> squares of order 22. After communicating these to P. J. Federico of Washington, D. C., U. S. A., who informed T. H. Willcocks of Bristol, U. K., the latter found a third simple <b>perfect</b> <b>squared</b> square of order 22 about August 1978. After Duijvestijn's proof in 1962 that there were no simple <b>perfect</b> <b>squared</b> squares of order less than 21, another computer attack, by J. C. Wilson of Waterloo, Canada, in his thesis of 1967, resulted in twenty-nine low-order simple <b>perfect</b> <b>squared</b> squares, five of order 25 and twenty-four of order 26. By certain transformation techniques, Federico and Willcocks were able to add three simple <b>perfect</b> <b>squared</b> squares of order 25 to the stock, not to mention their four and seven of orders 26 and 27, respectively. Then, in 1990, Duijvestijn decided to start all over again when computer power had tremendously grown compared to that of the sixties. He first found eight simple <b>perfect</b> <b>squared</b> squares of order 22, including his earlier two. Secondly, he found twelve of order 23 and twenty-six of order 24, making the total number of simple <b>perfect</b> <b>squared</b> squares of order less than 25 equal to forty-seven. From the order- 22 results sent to J. D. Skinner, 11, of Lincoln, Nebraska, U. S. A., two simple <b>perfect</b> <b>squared</b> squares of order 23 were derived by Skinner even before these were detected in the output of Duijvestijn's computer(s). The same happened, when Bouwkamp found two simple <b>perfect</b> <b>squared</b> squares of order 24 from Duijvestijn's order- 23 results even before the order- 23 run was completed. In 1991 Duijvestijn started with order 25 and at the end of March, 1992, the unexpectedly large number of 160 simple <b>perfect</b> <b>squared</b> squares of order 25 were there, of which only very few had been discovered before by transform techniques by Federico, Willcocks, Skinner, and Bouwkamp. The Catalogue contains 207 simple <b>perfect</b> <b>squared</b> squares of which 182 were found by Duijvestijn, 13 by Bouwkamp, 5 by Wilson, 3 by Federico, 3 by Skinner, and 1 by Willcocks for the first time. Our thanks are due to F. H. Simons of the Department for providing us with the originals of the pages that follow. This Catalogue is rather an Album of Squared Squares, the creation of which was hoped for by Federico after we had demonstrated automatic drawing by computer and plotter of the squared squares just found by Wilson...|$|R
50|$|Duijvestijn {{also found}} 2 simple <b>perfect</b> <b>squared</b> squares of sides 110 but each {{comprising}} 22 squares. T.H. Willcocks found another. In 1999, I. Gambini proved that these 3 are the smallest <b>perfect</b> <b>squared</b> squares {{in terms of}} side length.|$|R

25|$|The third volume {{includes}} {{the solution of}} several dynamical problems {{by means of the}} calculus of variations; some papers on the integral calculus; a solution of Fermat's problem mentioned above: given an integer n which is not a <b>perfect</b> <b>square,</b> to find a number x such that x2n+1 is a perfect square; and the general differential equations of motion for three bodies moving under their mutual attractions.|$|E
25|$|The naive {{approach}} to finding a congruence of squares is {{to pick a}} random number, square it, and hope the least non-negative remainder modulo n is a <b>perfect</b> <b>square</b> (in the integers). For example, 802 mod 5959 is 441, which is 212. This approach finds a congruence of squares only rarely for large n, but when it does find one, more often than not, the congruence is nontrivial and the factorization is complete. This is roughly the basis of Fermat's factorization method.|$|E

In 2010 low-order {{compound}} <b>perfect</b> <b>squared</b> squares (CPSSs) were completely enumerated. Up to symmetries of the square and its squared subrectangles there are 208 low-order CPSSs in orders 24 to 28. In 2012 the CPSSs of order 29 were completely enumerated, giving a total of 620 CPSSs up to order 29. Comment: 44 pages, 10 figures.

25|$|The {{second of}} these is valid in the cut complex plane. There are two cuts, from i to the point at infinity, going down the {{imaginary}} axis, and from i to the point at infinity, going up the same axis. It works best for real numbers running from −1 to 1. The partial denominators are the odd natural numbers, and the partial numerators (after the first) are just (nz)2, with each <b>perfect</b> <b>square</b> appearing once. The first was developed by Leonhard Euler; the second by Carl Friedrich Gauss utilizing the Gaussian hypergeometric series.|$|E
25|$|A spherical {{fullerene}} of n carbon atoms has n pi-bonding electrons, free to delocalize. These {{should try}} to delocalize over the whole molecule. The quantum mechanics of such an arrangement should be like one shell only of the well-known quantum mechanical structure of a single atom, with a stable filled shell for n = 2, 8, 18, 32, 50, 72, 98, 128, etc.; i.e. twice a <b>perfect</b> <b>square</b> number; but this series does not include 60. This 2(N+1)2 rule (with N integer) for spherical aromaticity is the three-dimensional analogue of Hückel's rule. The 10+ cation would satisfy this rule, and should be aromatic. This {{has been shown to}} be the case using quantum chemical modelling, which showed the existence of strong diamagnetic sphere currents in the cation.|$|E
25|$|The first {{priority}} when beginning a settlement was {{the location and}} construction of the church (iglesia).

Once the spot for the church was selected, its position would be marked and the remainder of the mission complex would be laid out. The priests' quarters, refectory, convento, workshops, kitchens, soldiers' and servants' living quarters, storerooms, and other ancillary chambers were usually grouped around a walled, open court or patio (often {{in the form of a}} quadrangle) inside which religious celebrations and other festive events often took place. The cuadrángulo was rarely a <b>perfect</b> <b>square</b> because the Fathers had no surveying instruments at their disposal and simply measured off all dimensions by foot. In the event of an attack by hostile forces the mission's inhabitants could take refuge within the quadrangle.|$|E

25|$|To {{accommodate}} {{the needs of}} the congregation, Wright divided the community space from the temple space through a low, middle loggia that could be approached from either side. This was an efficient use of space and kept down on noise between the two main gathering areas: those coming for religious services would be separated via the loggia from those coming for community events. The plan of the design looks back to the bipartite design of his own studio built several blocks away in 1898: with two portions of the building similar in composition and separated by a lower passageway, and one section being larger than the other. The Guggenheim Museum in New York City is another bipartite design. Also for the Temple's architecture, Wright borrowed several attributes from his previous creation, the Larkin Administration Building. Key features derived were use of stained glass windows as well as geometric figure. But, unlike the Larkin Building, the Temple's plan produced a <b>perfect</b> <b>square,</b> as opposed to the double-square rectangle of the Larkin.|$|E

Some fanciful accounts regarding the construction of the missions claimed that underground tunnels were incorporated in the design, to be used as a means of emergency egress in the event of attack; however, no historical evidence (written or physical) has ever been uncovered to support these assertions.|$|E

Three of them (north, east and west) {{are on the}} Swiss {{side of the border}} and watershed (Mattertal valley) and one of them (south) is on the Italian side of the border (Valtournenche valley). The north face overlooks the Ober Gabelhorn (7km away) across the Zmutt Glacier and valley (above Zermatt), the east face overlooks the Gorner Glacier system between the Gornergrat and Monte Rosa (respectively 10 and 17km away) across the Theodul Pass, the west face overlooks the upper basin of the Zmutt Glacier between the Dent Blanche and the Dent d'Hérens (respectively 7 and 4km away) and the south face fronts the resort town of Breuil-Cervinia and overlooks {{a good portion of the}} Valtournenche. The Matterhorn does not form a <b>perfect</b> <b>square</b> pyramid, as the north and south faces are wider than the west and east faces. Moreover, the latter faces do not actually meet on the summit but are connected by a 100-metre-long horizontal west–east ridge between the north and south faces.|$|E

500|$|During the 16th and 17th centuries, {{the first}} plants were being {{imported}} to these major Western European gardens from Eastern Europe and nearby Asia (which provided many bulbs), and these {{found a place}} in the new gardens, where they could be conveniently studied by the plant experts of the day. For example, Asian introductions were described by Carolus Clusius (1526–1609), who was director, in turn, of the Botanical Garden of the University of Vienna and Hortus Botanicus Leiden. Many plants were being collected from the Near East, especially bulbous plants from Turkey. Clusius laid the foundations of Dutch tulip breeding and the bulb industry, and he helped create one of the earliest formal botanical gardens of Europe at Leyden where his detailed planting lists have made it possible to recreate this garden near its original site. The [...] of Leyden in 1601 was a <b>perfect</b> <b>square</b> divided into quarters for the four continents, but by 1720, though, it was a rambling system of beds, struggling to contain the novelties rushing in, and it became better known as the [...] His Exoticorum libri decem (1605) is an important survey of exotic plants and animals that is still consulted today. The inclusion of new plant introductions in botanic gardens meant their scientific role was now widening, as botany gradually asserted its independence from medicine.|$|E
