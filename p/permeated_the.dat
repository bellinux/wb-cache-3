5|$|Bleed Like Me is {{the fourth}} studio album by American-Scottish {{alternative}} rock band Garbage. It was released on April 11, 2005 by A Records and Warner Bros. Records. The group chose a straight rock sound reminiscent of Garbage's live performances instead of the electronica that <b>permeated</b> <b>the</b> previous album, Beautiful Garbage (2001).|$|E
5|$|In time, the {{ineffectiveness}} of the CIP {{began to}} concern the Eisenhower administration, who {{were worried about}} the lack of industrialization. The corruption that <b>permeated</b> <b>the</b> initiative remained a problem. The rural peasants of Vietnam, who comprised more than 80% of the population, were unaffected by the aid package except for the resentment that it instilled in them when they observed the relative affluence of their city counterparts compared to their own impoverished state. However, the program was credited with transforming the textile industry, as 25,000 sewing machines were imported {{in the first year of}} its operation.|$|E
5|$|The Duck End {{was one of}} {{the poorer}} districts of Aylesbury. Until the end of the 19thcentury it had no sewers or refuse collections. The area had a number of open ditches filled with {{stagnant}} water, and outbreaks of malaria and cholera were common. The cottages had inadequate ventilation and lighting, and no running water. Faeces from the duck ponds <b>permeated</b> <b>the</b> local soil and seeped into the cottages through cracks in the floors.|$|E

5|$|The {{homecoming}} celebration {{went on for}} days. Officials and {{the general}} population of the island crowded the shoreline to cheer their returning monarch. Speeches were made in both English and Hawaiian, and some people stood on rooftops for a glimpse. Floral arrangements <b>permeated</b> <b>the</b> city, welcome-home signs were displayed, and music was everywhere. Along his route to Iolani Palace, the procession passed beneath numerous festooned arches erected for his homecoming. A daytime parade was held in his honor. The palace was opened for the public to personally greet the King. The Honolulu Fire Department and the Poola Association began an evening torchlight parade at a bell tower brightly lit with Chinese lanterns, and proceeded through the streets of downtown Honolulu to the palace.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, Brooks dead-heated with Stockwell in the 100m {{freestyle}} at the Australian Championships, clocking {{a time of}} 51.12s. He then {{combined with}} Tom Stachewicz, Paul Lee and Barry Armstrong, as Western Australia won the 4100m freestyle relay for the first time. Brooks maintained his form and despite not defending his Australian 100m title, was selected for the 1986 Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh, where he came second to Fasala in the 100m freestyle {{in a time of}} 51.01s. He claimed gold in the 4100m freestyle relay along with Fasala, Stockwell and Matthew Renshaw, anchoring the quartet in setting a Commonwealth Games record. On the return flight, he consumed 46 cans of beer and was banned for six months after he talked about the incident during a television interview. In his memoirs, Talbot, a non-drinker, cited Brooks and his Mean Machine teammates as being one of the biggest proponents of a hard-drinking culture that had <b>permeated</b> <b>the</b> Australian swimming scene at the time. In particular, he singled out Brooks as being a focal point of disruptive activity during his time at the Australian Institute of Sport. Talbot sees alcohol as the main reason behind the collapse of Australia's standing in the swimming world in the 1970s and the subsequent prolonged period of international uncompetitiveness in the 1980s.|$|E

25|$|For centuries Delhi {{had been}} {{the capital of the}} Mughal Empire and of {{previous}} Turkic Muslim rulers of North India. The series of Islamic rulers keeping Delhi as a stronghold of their empires left a vast array of Islamic architecture in Delhi and a strong Islamic culture <b>permeated</b> <b>the</b> city. The 1941 Census listed Delhi's population as being 33.22% Muslim.|$|E
25|$|This {{passage from}} the Memoirs of a Cavalier, {{ascribed}} to Daniel Defoe, though not contemporary evidence, is an admirable summary {{of the character of}} the Civil War.

25|$|Worthy of mention are the Garrano (or Minho horse), a {{breed of}} small equine species who were {{ancestors}} of the Galician pony and Andalusian horse, which mostly live in the wild, but are a gentle breed with no significant fear of humans. For a long time these horses <b>permeated</b> <b>the</b> farms of Vilarinho das Furnas (before it was inundated with the dam's construction), but later began to freely move between the Portuguese-Spanish border after 1979.|$|E
25|$|Philhellenism made {{a notable}} {{contribution}} to romanticism, enabling {{the younger generation}} of artistic and literary intellectuals to expand the classical repertoire by treating modern Greek history {{as an extension of}} ancient history; the idea of a regeneration of the spirit of ancient Greece <b>permeated</b> <b>the</b> rhetoric of the Greek cause's supporters. Classicists and romantics of that period envisioned the casting out of the Turks as the prelude to the revival of the Golden Age.|$|E
25|$|The {{phenomenon}} of intensive warfare, based on mass formations of infantry {{rather than the}} traditional chariots, was one major trend {{which led to the}} creation of strong central bureaucracies in each of the major states. At the same time, the process of secondary feudalism which <b>permeated</b> <b>the</b> Spring and Autumn period, and led to such events as the partition of Jin and the usurpation of Qi by the Tian clan, was eventually reversed by the same process of bureaucratisation.|$|E

25|$|The {{economic}} downturn of the 1970s {{led to some}} extremely difficult times for the city. The Bronx, in particular, was plagued by arson, and an atmosphere of lawlessness <b>permeated</b> <b>the</b> city. Frank Serpico wrote about corruption he encountered in his time {{as a police officer}} in this era in a book, which was later turned into a movie and television series. In addition, the city's financial crisis led to a hiring freeze on all city departments, including the NYPD, from 1976 to 1980.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, leaking {{aviation}} gasoline accumulating {{in the forward}} elevator pit began vaporising and soon <b>permeated</b> <b>the</b> upper and lower hangar decks. The danger this posed to the ship was readily apparent to the damage control crews but, whether through inadequate training, lack of practice (only three months had passed since the ship's commissioning) or general incompetence, their response to it proved fatally ineffectual. Efforts to pump out the damaged elevator well were bungled and no one thought to try to cover the increasingly lethal mixture with foam from the hangar's fire suppression system.|$|E

25|$|Overall, Huguenot {{presence}} was heavily {{concentrated in the}} western and southern portions of the French kingdom, as nobles there secured practise of the new faith. That included Languedoc-Roussillon, Gascony and even stretched into the Dauphiné. They lived on the Atlantic coast in La Rochelle, and spread across provinces of Normandy and Poitou. In the south, towns like Castres, Montauban, Montpellier and Nimes were Huguenot strongholds. In addition, a dense network of Protestant villages <b>permeated</b> <b>the</b> rural mountainous region of the Cevennes. It {{continues to be the}} backbone of French Protestantism. Roughly 80% of all Huguenots lived in the western and southern areas.|$|E
25|$|Bedřich Smetana, another Czech, wrote a piano trio {{and string}} quartet, {{both of which}} {{incorporate}} native Czech rhythms and melodies. In Russia, Russian folk music <b>permeated</b> <b>the</b> works of the late 19th-century composers. Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky uses a typical Russian folk dance in the final movement of his string sextet, Souvenir de Florence, Op. 70. Alexander Borodin's second string quartet contains references to folk music, and the slow Nocturne movement of that quartet recalls Middle Eastern modes that were current in the Muslim sections of southern Russia. Edvard Grieg used the musical style of his native Norway in his string quartet in G minor, Op. 27.|$|E
25|$|In the {{two decades}} that {{followed}} {{after the end of}} the first controversy, the social and cultural processes which led to the establishment of the Israelite Temple ripened and intensified, engulfing most of German Jews. An entire generation went to modern schools; levels of personal observance, which were steadily declining for many years, now reached a critical turning point. In the 1840s, the majority could be classified a non-Orthodox. The last traditional yeshiva, that of Fürth, closed in 1828. Higher education became mandatory for rabbis both by government decree and popular demand. Young university graduates slowly replaced the old religious leadership. Reform tendencies, limited to the upper crust of acculturated laymen twenty years earlier, now <b>permeated</b> <b>the</b> rabbinate itself.|$|E

40|$|This {{book review}} looks at Ethics in Qualitative Research, which {{outlines}} {{the tensions between}} the often linear and mechanistic approaches of university ethics committees. It also examines the 'fluidity and inductive uncertainty' that pervade qualitative research where ethical dilemmas and concerns <b>permeate</b> <b>the</b> research process. The reviewer found that the book is intellectually challenging and most appropriate for an academic or doctoral audience, although the principles and challenges raised are relevant to all qualitative researchers. Ultimately, the book shows that ethics should <b>permeate</b> <b>the</b> entire research process and not simply be a tick-box exercise...|$|R
