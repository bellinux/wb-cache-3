25|$|Sometimes formal sex {{education}} is taught {{as a full}} course {{as part of the}} curriculum in junior high school or high school. Other times it is only one unit within a more broad biology, health, home economics, or <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> <b>class.</b> Some schools offer no {{sex education}}, since it remains a controversial issue in several countries, particularly the United States (especially with regard to the age at which children should start receiving such education, the amount of detail that is revealed, including LGBT sex education, and topics dealing with human sexual behavior, e.g. safe sex practices, masturbation, premarital sex, and sexual ethics).|$|E

2500|$|The pensionandos were a {{group of}} {{students}} sent to the U.S. for the purpose of gaining an education from an American university, with the hopes that these students can go back home to contribute to Filipino society. Starting in 1901, the pensionado program allowed for Filipino students to gain an education from an American university; unlike the “Manong” generation, there were a significant amount of Filipina women in the program. The Philippines was under U.S. colonial rule during the time the pensionado program was first put into place. American teachers in the Philippines encouraged Filipino students back home to adopt American styles of fashion and clothing and leave behind traditional Filipino garments. In the 1920’s, the camisa (blouse) and the saya (skirt) were used in conjunction to form {{what is known as the}} terno. The terno is alternatively referred to as the Maria Clara gown. The inspiration for the terno came about due to American evening gowns more utilitarian, with diminished skirts and sleeves. The terno was commonly worn among Filipina students as a replacement to the camisa. The perception was that traditional Filipino clothing such as the camisa were cumbersome and inconvenient for daily use. Because of this, American clothing became the standard for everyday wear in Filipino society. <b>Physical</b> <b>education</b> <b>class</b> in the Filipino curriculum was pivotal for this change. It allowed specifically for women to dress in non-traditional Filipino clothing and in athletic wear that was fashionable in the United States.|$|E
40|$|Purpose. The aim of our {{investigation}} was to establish {{the efficiency of the}} integrated <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> <b>classes</b> for schoolchildren with minor deviations in health. Methods. Sociological (questionnaire), biomedical, pedagogical (testing), psycho-diagnostic, and mathematical statistics. Pupils (N = 1417) of secondary school (both sexes, 5 th− 9 th forms, i. e. aged 10 − 15) were examined. Results. The characteristics of physical and mental development in the process of integrated <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> proved to be significantly better for different sex and age groups. Analysis of physical fitness characteristics shows that integrated <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> <b>classes</b> {{turned out to be more}} effective for schoolchildren with minor health deviations than for apparently healthy students. Integrated <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> <b>classes</b> are more effective for students’ dexterity than for their power endurance. Integrated <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> <b>classes</b> are more effective for female students than for male ones; for schoolchildren with minor health deviations in older age groups (7 th− 9 th forms) than for younger schoolchildren. Those schoolchildren who attended integrated <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> <b>classes</b> expressed significantly better attitudes to <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> than their peers who studied in a segregated environment. Conclusions. Integrated <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> <b>classes</b> are a more progressive and effective form of <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> in terms of their beneficial effect upon the physical and mental development of secondary school children with minor health distortions...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{analyze the}} {{association}} between physical activity, participation in <b>Physical</b> <b>Education</b> <b>classes,</b> and indicators of social isolation among adolescents. MethodsThis was an epidemiological study based on secondary analysis of data from {{a representative sample of}} students (14 – 19 years) from public high schools (n= 4, 207). Data were collected through the questionnaire Global School-based Student Health Survey. The independent variables were the level of physical activity and enrollment in <b>Physical</b> <b>Education</b> <b>classes,</b> while the dependent variables were two indicators of social isolation (feeling of loneliness and having few friends). Descriptive and inferential procedures were used in the statistical analysis. ResultsMost of the adolescents were classified as insufficiently active (65. 1 %) and reported not attending <b>Physical</b> <b>Education</b> <b>classes</b> (64. 9 %). Approximately two in each ten participants reported feeling of loneliness (15. 8 %) and, in addition, about one in each five adolescents reported have only one friend (19. 5 %). In the bivariate analysis, a significantly lower proportion of individuals reporting social isolation was observed among adolescents who referred higher enrollment in <b>Physical</b> <b>Education</b> <b>classes.</b> After adjustment for confounding variables, binary logistic regression showed that attending <b>Physical</b> <b>Education</b> <b>classes</b> was identified as a protective factor in relation to the indicator of social isolation ‘having few friends,’ but only for girls. ConclusionsIt was concluded that participation in <b>Physical</b> <b>Education</b> <b>classes</b> is associated with reduced social isolation among female adolescents...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{evaluated}} a health-related <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> {{program for}} fourth- and fifth-grade students {{designed to increase}} physical activity during <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> <b>classes</b> and outside of school. METHODS: Seven schools were assigned to three conditions in a quasi-experimental design. Health-related <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> was taught by <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> specialists or trained classroom teachers. Students from these classes were compared with those in control classes. Analyses were conducted on 955 students with complete data. RESULTS: Students spent more minutes per week being physically active in specialist-led (40 min) and teacher-led (33 min) <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> <b>classes</b> than in control classes (18 min; P <. 001). After 2 years, girls in the specialist-led condition were superior to girls {{in the control condition}} on abdominal strength and endurance (P <. 001) and cardiorespiratory endurance (P <. 001). There were no effects on physical activity outside of school. CONCLUSIONS: A health-related <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> curriculum can provide students with substantially more physical activity during <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> <b>classes.</b> Improved <b>physical</b> <b>education</b> <b>classes</b> can potentially benefit 97 % of elementary school students...|$|R
