40|$|Abstract — The {{communication}} from a cooperative sensor network to a mobile access point is considered in this paper. Sensors {{are assumed to}} be informed with a global message, and some nodes are misinformed with random messages. Three system configurations are discussed based on whether a <b>polling</b> <b>channel</b> is implemented and whether an energy limit is imposed on individual sensors. The capacity of these system configurations are derived. It is shown that if a <b>polling</b> <b>channel</b> is implemented and there is no energy constraint on individual nodes, there is no rate loss with the presence of sensor errors. If there is no <b>polling</b> <b>channel</b> implemented and there is no energy constraint on individual nodes, the rate loss is proportional to the probability that a node is misinformed...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} {{the role of}} noisy {{feedback}} in compound Gaussian multiple access channels, where both the set of active users and their respective channels are unknown a priori. The system is modeled as a special form of two-way network, where transmitters and receivers can {{interact with each other}} to improve the overall communication efficiency, but the information flow is not bi-directional. We first characterize the compound channel capacity when there is no feedback in the system, which turns out to be simply an intersection of several capacity regions. Next, we analyze a <b>polling,</b> <b>channel</b> estimation and feedback protocol, which achieves a rate region to within log(K) bits/use of a K-user system with perfect feedback. ...|$|R

30|$|The {{standard}} defines {{two main}} request/grant mechanisms: unicast polling and contention-based polling. The unicast polling is the {{mechanism by which}} the BS allocates bandwidth to each SS to send its BW-REQ messages. The BS performs the polling periodically. After this, the SSs can send its BW-REQ messages as a standalone message {{in response to a}} poll from the BS or it can be piggybacked in data packets. The contention-based polling allows the SSs to send their bandwidth requests to the BS without being polled. The SSs send BW-REQ messages during the contention period. If multiple request messages are transmitted at the same time, collisions may be occurred. There are other mechanisms that the SSs can use to request uplink bandwidth such as multicast <b>polling,</b> <b>channel</b> quality indicator channel, etc. Depending on the QoS and traffic parameters associated with a service, {{one or more of these}} mechanisms may be used by the SSs [11]. A comparison of these mechanisms is presented in [6].|$|R

5000|$|On {{the other}} hand, American music {{journalist}} Jim DeRogatis felt The Stone Roses had been highly overrated by critics, {{pointing to a}} [...] "lame retread disco beat" [...] and [...] "oh-so-dated" [...] guitars, while Neil Kulkarni of The Quietus said its first three songs were enjoyable but preceded a [...] "right barrel-load of shite afterwards". In an article on overhyped records for The Guardian, Peter Robinson said that The Stone Roses is [...] "an average rock album - lyrically pedestrian and with a sonic policy swerving from the play-safe to the over-indulgent". Junkee Media writer Darren Levin contended that the record features only six [...] "actual songs", which are [...] "surrounded by drivel... and noodly go-nowhere grooves". Fiona Sturges of The Independent criticised the band's songwriting as well as Brown's [...] "tuneless" [...] vocals, and objected to the editors of NME voting The Stone Roses the best British album of all time. After the record was voted the second-best ever in a UK public <b>poll,</b> <b>Channel</b> 4 broadcast a presentation of the results in which three of the presenters—musician Bob Geldof, critic Paul Gambaccini, and artist Justine Frischmann—were critical of the album's inclusion in the top 100 and attributed it to the generation of listeners who voted rather than the record's quality.|$|R

40|$|Enhanced General Packet Radio Services {{is one of}} the {{proposals}} submitted to the IMT- 2000 initiative of the ITU for third-generation wireless services. EGPRS is also the evolutionary path chosen by the Universal Wireless Communications Consortium, leading toward the convergence of GSM and IS- 136 standards for their next-generation wireless systems. In this article we discuss the feasibility of supporting integrated services, such as packet voice, Web browsing, and best-effort data, using EGPRS. We first describe the relevant capabilities offered by the currently proposed standard, and then outline additional capabilities at the radio link control/medium access control layer that are necessary to support integrated services in a spectrally efficient manner. In summary, these needed capabilities are: fast uplink access during an ongoing session; fast resource assignment for both uplink and downlink; and the ability to differentiate services at the base station subsystem. To realize these capabilities, we propose enhancements to the RLC/MAC layer. These enhancements include a new set of packet control channels (namely, a fast packet access channel in the uplink, and a fast packet access grant channel and a fast packet <b>polling</b> <b>channel</b> in the downlink); uplink access protocols that utilize these control channels; and a modified fast uplink access channel structure. These changes would enable EGPRS to offer a wide range of services through a single packet-based network. Similar ideas are also applicable to other third-generation systems...|$|R
