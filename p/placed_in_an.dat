5|$|The {{damage to}} {{specimens}} is unfortunately not reversible; however, the decay can be arrested by washing or soaking the specimens in water, {{followed by a}} very thorough drying. The specimens must then be <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> environment that consists of only archival materials, in a completely archival setting.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} step, the crystal is <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> intense beam of X-rays, usually {{of a single}} {{wavelength}} (monochromatic X-rays), producing the regular pattern of reflections. As the crystal is gradually rotated, previous reflections disappear and new ones appear; the intensity of every spot is recorded at every orientation of the crystal. Multiple data sets {{may have to be}} collected, with each set covering slightly more than half a full rotation of the crystal and typically containing tens of thousands of reflections.|$|E
5|$|In {{two-dimensional}} articulography, transmitter coils are <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> {{equilateral triangle}} along the midsagittal plane at the forehead, chin, and neck. Because of the geometric {{orientation of the}} transmitter coils, accurate readings are able to be taken {{as long as the}} sensor coils placed on the tongue stay within about a centimeter of the midsagittal plane and are not angled at more than 30 degrees.|$|E
50|$|Items {{from this}} period were also noted for their careful and elegant packaging. Before boxing, each Steuben piece was <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> silver-gray flannel bag (stitched with the Steuben name), and then <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{presentation}} box.|$|R

5|$|There {{were two}} main design {{alternatives}} to the broadside. In one design, the guns were <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> armored casemate amidships: this arrangement was called the 'box-battery' or 'centre-battery'. In the other, the guns could be placed on a rotating platform {{to give them a}} broad field of fire; when fully armored, this arrangement was called a turret and when partially armored or unarmored, a barbette.|$|E

5|$|Very pure lead can be {{obtained}} by processing smelted lead electrolytically using the Betts process. Anodes of impure lead and cathodes of pure lead are <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> electrolyte of lead fluorosilicate (PbSiF6). Once electrical potential is applied, impure lead at the anode dissolves and plates onto the cathode, leaving the majority of the impurities in solution.|$|E
5|$|Weber has a brother, Brandon, who is {{two years}} younger than him and grew up playing hockey with Shea's former Predators {{teammate}} Cody Franson. When Weber was 14, his mother was diagnosed with brain cancer, which surgery mostly removed. She later began suffering from similar symptoms, however, and in early 2010 {{had a series of}} seizures. Weber's mother was <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> induced coma, and died on August 11, 2010.|$|E
5|$|At the gallows, Beauchamp {{assured the}} {{assembled}} clergy {{that he had}} a salvation experience on July 6. Too weak to stand, he was held upright by two men while the noose was tied around his neck. At Beauchamp's request, the Twenty-Second Regiment musicians played Bonaparte's Retreat from Moscow while 5,000 spectators watched his execution. It was the first legal hanging in Kentucky's history. Beauchamp's father requested the bodies of his son and daughter-in-law for burial. The two bodies were <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> embrace in a single coffin, as they had requested. They were buried in Maple Grove Cemetery in Bloomfield, Kentucky. The couple's tombstone was engraved with a poem written by Anna Beauchamp.|$|E

5|$|Auschwitz II Birkenau was liberated by the Red Army {{at around}} 3:30 p.m. on 27 January 1945, {{and the main}} camp (Auschwitz I) two hours later. Military trucks loaded with bread arrived the next day. Volunteers began to offer first aid and improvised {{assistance}} the following week. In early February, the Polish Red Cross hospital opened in blocks 14, 21, and 22 at Auschwitz I, headed by Dr. Józef Bellert and staffed by 30 volunteer doctors and nurses from Kraków, along with around 90 former inmates. The critically injured patients – estimated at several thousands – were relocated from Birkenau and Monowitz to the main camp. Some orphaned children were immediately adopted by Oświęcim residents, while others were transferred to Kraków, where {{a number of them}} were adopted by Polish families. Others were <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> orphanage at Harbutowice.|$|E
5|$|For Thanksgiving 1988, {{his family}} spent the holiday with him, {{although}} he had developed neuropathy and was increasingly bed-ridden and reliant on morphine; he died in his bed on December 16, 1988 {{at the age of}} 41. Sylvester had planned his own funeral, insisting that he be dressed in a red kimono and <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> open-top coffin for the mourners to see, with his friend Yvette Flunder doing his corpse's makeup. He wanted Tracy to sing at his funeral, accompanied by choirs and many flowers. The whole affair took place in his church, the Love Center, with a sermon being provided by Reverend Walter Hawkins. The event was packed, with standing room only, and the coffin was subsequently taken and buried at his family's plot in Inglewood Park Cemetery. An album titled Immortal was posthumously released; it contained Sylvester's final studio recordings, and was compiled by Marty Blecman.|$|E
5|$|In April 2006, MNM were <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> angle {{in which}} they found {{themselves}} in a losing streak against the team of Paul London and Brian Kendrick. In non-title tag team matches, singles matches, and even a six-man tag match, London and Kendrick defeated the duo every time. At the Judgment Day pay-per-view in May 2006, MNM lost the tag team championship to London and Kendrick. After the match, Nitro and Mercury started brawling, disbanding the group. Later that night, Melina lost a singles match against Jillian Hall and after slapping General Manager Theodore Long in anger, she and Nitro were fired from the SmackDown! brand in storyline. Off-screen, Nitro and Mercury did not get along, and WWE management decided to split the tag team and send Nitro and Melina to the Raw brand. In addition, Mercury was about to begin serving a suspension for violating the WWE Wellness program.|$|E

They don't take <b>place</b> <b>in</b> normal reality.|$|R
5|$|Minton {{was pleased}} with Roosevelt's bill and quickly became its leading {{supporter}} in the Senate. The measure was <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> omnibus bill designed to reform judicial salaries and districting, among many other measures. Republicans quickly discovered the court-packing provision and targeted the bill. Democrats had overwhelming super-majorities in Congress, and passage of the bill at first seemed assured. Minton's support of the bill helped him earn the position of Senate majority whip, allowing him to more effectively push for its passage. Minton delivered six radio addresses {{on behalf of his}} party in support of the bill, but public opinion could not be swayed in the Democrats' favor.|$|E
5|$|Rapists of virgins and {{children}} are also attested to have been buried alive, with a stake driven through them. In one such judicial tradition, the rapist was to be <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> open grave, and the rape victim was ordered to make the three first strokes on the stake herself; the executioners then finishing the impalement procedure. Serving {{as an example of}} the fate of a child molester, in August 1465 in Zurich, Switzerland, Ulrich Moser was condemned to be impaled, for having sexually violated six girls between the ages four and nine. His clothes were taken off, and he was placed on his back. His arms and legs were stretched out, each secured to a pole. Then a stake was driven through his navel down into the ground. Thereafter, people left him to die.|$|E
5|$|The Dixie Mission had {{consequences}} for individuals, {{and for the}} nation. Many participants were accused of being communists, such as John Davies and John Service. Both were subjected to multiple Congressional investigations that consistently found {{that they were not}} Communist Party members, agents of foreign powers, or disloyal to the United States. This did not spare Service from termination at the State Department. He appealed this decision and ultimately the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in his favor. Davies was exiled from China, his field of expertise, by Hurley. Then he was hounded from a position in Russia to an inconsequential post in South America. Davies resigned that position and began manufacturing furniture. Hurley accused Colonel David Barrett of sabotaging his diplomacy with the KMT and the CPC. He succeeded in preventing Barrett from promotion to brigadier general, even though Barrett's promotion was endorsed by the theater commander, General Albert C. Wedemeyer. Barrett was retained in the China Theater, but <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> inferior position.|$|E
