5|$|In 2009 a {{woman was}} found by a Police Community Support Officer (PCSO) acting suspiciously. When {{approached}} she produced a gun and <b>pointed</b> <b>it</b> at a passing young child. Unarmed PCSO George McNaught of the Metropolitan Police wrestled the gun out of the woman's hands before overpowering and detaining her. The woman was arrested and PCSO McNaught was awarded the commendation of the High Sheriff of Greater London for his brave actions. He is the first PCSO to receive the award.|$|E
5|$|After the shooting, Saldívar {{entered her}} red 1994 GMC pickup truck {{and tried to}} leave the motel parking lot. Motel {{employee}} Rosario Garza saw Saldívar leave her room with a wrapped towel. It was later {{thought she was going}} to Q-Productions to shoot Quintanilla, Jr. and others who were waiting for Selena. However, she was spotted by a responding police officer in a vehicle. The officer left his vehicle, drew his gun, and ordered Saldívar out of the truck. Saldívar did not comply; she backed up and parked adjacent to two cars. Her truck was then blocked in by the police vehicle. Saldívar picked up the pistol, <b>pointed</b> <b>it</b> at her right temple, and threatened to commit suicide. A SWAT team and the FBI Crisis Negotiation Unit were brought in. Musicologist Himilce Novas later said the event was reminiscent of O.J. Simpson's planned suicide 10 months earlier.|$|E
5|$|After the {{standoff}} entered its fourth hour, Valencia {{succeeded in getting}} Saldívar to confess that she had intended to shoot herself. Saldívar said when she placed the gun to her own head, Selena {{tried to tell her}} not to kill herself. When Selena opened the door to leave, Saldívar said she told her to close it. She also said the gun went off when Selena left. During the sixth hour, Saldívar agreed to give herself up, but when she saw a police officer pointing a rifle at her, she panicked, ran back to her truck, picked up the revolver, and <b>pointed</b> <b>it</b> at her head again. Saldívar surrendered after more than nine hours. By then, hundreds of Selena's fans had gathered at the scene; many wept as police took Saldívar away. A press conference was called within hours of Selena's murder; Saldívar had not yet been named in media reports. Assistant Police Chief Ken Bung and Quintanilla, Jr. told the press the possible motive was Selena's intention to terminate Saldívar's employment.|$|E

5|$|The {{military}} {{leaders at the}} fort had been given written information from the Indian Agent regarding the killings during the raid. Plans were made to arrest the Indians involved. D Troop was hidden on foot behind the main office building. Carpenter had mounted troopers waiting nearby. Sherman and Grierson sat on the porch, reviewing the situation {{and waiting for the}} Indians to arrive. When the Indians came, they blatantly boasted of what they had done. After Sherman told the Indians they were under arrest, a signal was given and the dismounted troopers came forward with carbines and pistols in hand. Lone Wolf, supporting the Kiowa Chiefs, pulled a rifle out from under his blanket serape and <b>pointed</b> <b>it</b> at Sherman. Sherman, ready for any problem, quickly disarmed him before the trigger could be pulled. Big Tree made an attempt to escape but was quickly subdued by Carpenter's mounted troopers. Sherman decided that these men were criminals to be tried in a civil court and Carpenter was told to get it done.|$|E

Reid tried to shoot again as Smith jerked his rifle from Reid’s desperate grasp and quickly moved it in the direction of Reid.|$|E

During a playoff series, Luque wanted McDuffie to start on two days' rest, but McDuffie refused saying his arm was sore. Once the enraged manager returned {{to the locker room}} from his adjacent office waving a loaded pistol and <b>pointed</b> <b>it</b> at the pitcher, McDuffie quickly changed his mind, went out and fired a two-hitter game.|$|E

500|$|Many reviews were {{critical}} of the film's resemblance to The Fly. British magazine Time Out later [...] <b>pointed</b> <b>it</b> out, as did TV Guide. Audiences also noted that it {{was similar to the}} 1959 science fiction film 4D Man. In a 2000 interview with Video Watchdog, Richard Gordon stated [...] "we weren't really influenced by The Fly" [...] and wrote in the 2006 book Interviews with B Science Fiction and Horror Movie Makers that [...] "Projected Man does have a very strong similarity to The Fly, but it came to us as a finished screenplay and seemed to be a perfectly logical film to make." ...|$|E
500|$|... "On a Night Like This" [...] {{received}} generally favourable {{reviews from}} most music critics. Writing for Stylus Magazine, Mark Edwards {{said that the}} recording {{was one of the}} singer's songs from Ultimate Kylie that [...] "cemented her comeback". He referred it to as an [...] "aforementioned mega-song". Similarly, Jason Shawahn from About.com noted it as [...] "a blessing for domestic music consumers". AllMusic's Chris True favored [...] "On a Night Like This" [...] as one of the better cuts on the parent album, and selected the track as some of Minogue's best work. Nick Levine from Digital Spy called it a [...] "catchy" [...] number, and <b>pointed</b> <b>it</b> out as a highlight from the record. While likening the recording to the track [...] "Groovejet" [...] by Spiller and Sophie Ellis-Bextor, a reviewer from British tabloid NME felt the comparison [...] "works because it doesn't revolve awkwardly round a random disco beat".|$|E
500|$|According to {{director}} Joshua Logan, {{a friend}} of both theatre men, he and Leland Hayward mentioned Michener's best-selling book to Rodgers as a possible basis for the duo's next play, but the composer took no action. [...] Logan recalled that he then <b>pointed</b> <b>it</b> out to Hammerstein, who read Michener's book and spoke to Rodgers; the two agreed to do the project {{so long as they}} had majority control, to which Hayward grudgingly agreed. Michener, in his 1992 memoirs, however, wrote that the stories were first pitched as a movie concept to MGM by Kenneth MacKenna, head of the studio's literary department. [...] MacKenna's half brother was Jo Mielziner, who had designed the sets for Carousel and Allegro. [...] Michener states that Mielziner learned of the work from MacKenna and brought it to the attention of Hammerstein and Rodgers, pledging to create the sets if they took on the project.|$|E

One crown witness had said that on another occasion she saw Elvira Barney firing the gun while holding it in her left hand; when he called his client Hastings had the gun placed in front of her. After a pause he shouted at her to pick up the gun and she spontaneously picked it up in her right hand. The Judge (Mr Justice Humphreys) described Hastings' final address as [...] "certainly one of the finest speeches I have ever heard at the Bar" [...] and Elvira Barney was found not guilty both of murder and manslaughter.|$|E
500|$|Throughout his career, Thome's {{strength}} was power hitting. In six different seasons, he hit more than 40 home runs, and in 2003, {{he led the}} National League in home runs with 47. His career on-base plus slugging (OPS) of [...]956 is 19th all time. In 2011, he became the eighth MLB player to hit 600 home runs. As of 2017 Thome is the career leader in walk-off home runs with 13. One of Thome's trademarks was his unique batting stance, in which he held the bat out {{with his right hand}} and <b>pointed</b> <b>it</b> at right field before the pitcher threw, something he first saw in The Natural. Thome was known for his consistently positive attitude and [...] "gregarious" [...] personality. An active philanthropist during his playing career, he was honored with two Marvin Miller Man of the Year Awards and a Lou Gehrig Memorial Award for his community involvement.|$|E
500|$|Prussian {{activities}} {{began at}} 2:00 am on 12 August. Troops were roused and, within the hour, they set off.

[...] Finck's infantry and cavalry demonstrated {{in front of the}} five Russian regiments as a diversion, while the remainder of Frederick's army continued in a [...] semi-circle around the eastern flank of the Russian line, to approach from the village from the southeast.

500|$|The final {{song on the}} record, [...] "Whipping Post," [...] {{was written}} shortly after Allman {{returned}} to Jacksonville. The song came to him shortly before bed, but {{he was unable to}} acquire a pencil and paper to write down his ideas, as there was a child asleep in the room and he could not turn on the lights. Turning to his next best alternative, he struck two kitchen matches (one for light and one, later blown out, as a charcoal writing utensil) and wrote down his lyrics on a bedside ironing board. [...] "Whipping Post" [...] was similar in composition to [...] "Dreams" [...] in its first incarnation, with Oakley later creating the heavy bassline that starts off the track. Duane and Betts take quick solos before the track builds to an [...] "anguished climax," [...] leading to Gregg Allman's solo voice, singing the song's refrain: [...] "Good Lord, I feel like I'm dyin'." [...] Allman had no idea the intro was written in 11/4 time — [...] "I just saw it as three sets of three, and then two to jump on the next three sets with" [...] — until his brother <b>pointed</b> <b>it</b> out for him. [...] "My brother told me — I guess the day I wrote it — he said, 'That's good, man. I didn’t know you understood 11/4.' Of course I said something intelligent like, 'What's 11/4?' Duane just said, 'Okay, dumbass, I'll try to draw it up on paper for you.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Stanton wanted WALL-E to be {{a box and}} EVE to be like an egg. WALL-E's {{eyes were}} {{inspired}} {{by a pair of}} binoculars Stanton was given when watching the Oakland Athletics play against the Boston Red Sox. He [...] "missed the entire inning" [...] because he was distracted by them. The director was reminded of Buster Keaton and decided the robot would not need a nose or mouth. Stanton added a zoom lens to make WALL-E more sympathetic. Ralph Eggleston noted this feature gave the animators more to work with and gave the robot a childlike quality. Pixar's studies of trash compactors during their visits to recycling stations inspired his body. His tank treads were inspired by a wheelchair someone had developed that used treads instead of wheels. The animators wanted him to have elbows, but realized this was unrealistic because he is only designed to pull garbage into his body. His arms also looked flimsy when they did a test of him waving. Animation director Angus MacLane suggested they attach his arms to a track on the sides of his body to move them around, based on the inkjet printers his father designed. This arm design contributed to creating the character's posture, so if they wanted him to be nervous, they would lower them. Stanton was unaware of the similarities between WALL-E and Johnny 5 from Short Circuit until others <b>pointed</b> <b>it</b> out to him.|$|E
500|$|At {{the motel}} room, Selena and Saldívar began arguing. Motel guests complained about loud noises coming from Saldívar's room. They said they heard two women arguing about {{business}} matters. Selena told Saldívar {{she could no}} longer be trusted, and demanded Saldívar return her financial papers. Selena then dumped Saldívar's satchel containing bank statements onto the bed and saw the gun. At 11:48a.m. (CST), Saldívar <b>pointed</b> <b>it</b> at Selena. As Selena tried to flee, Saldívar shot her once on the lower right shoulder, severing an artery and causing a massive loss of blood. Trinidad Espinoza, the hotel's maintenance man, reported hearing a [...] "loud bang", which he likened to a car engine misfiring. Selena was critically wounded; she ran towards the lobby, leaving a trail of blood [...] long. She was seen clutching her chest screaming, [...] "Help me! Help me! I've been shot!"; Saldívar was still chasing after her, pointing the gun at her, and calling her a [...] "bitch". According to Carlos Morales, who was waiting outside the motel, he heard screaming and saw Selena running towards him. She grabbed Morales and screamed, [...] "they'll shoot me again". Selena collapsed on the floor at 11:49a.m. (CST) as hotel general manager Barbara Schultz telephoned the emergency services. The singer identified Saldívar as her assailant and gave the number of the room where she had been shot. Shawna Vela and hotel sales manager Ruben DeLeon tried to stop the flow of blood. Selena's condition began to deteriorate rapidly as motel staff attended to her. Selena screamed at the staff, telling them, [...] "lock the door, she'll shoot me again". DeLeon tried to talk to Selena but noticed she was beginning to lose consciousness; he said she was moaning and moving less often. DeLeon noticed Selena's eyes had rolled back and that she went limp.|$|E
