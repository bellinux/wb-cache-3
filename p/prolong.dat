40|$|Background. Neonatal {{jaundice}} {{is one of}} {{the urgent}} problems in neonatology. There is a tendency to increase the incidence of <b>prolonged</b> jaundice. The aim of our study was to explore the features of history, anthropometric data and some liver functions in children with <b>prolonged</b> jaundice. Materials and methods. The study involved 111 children with <b>prolonged</b> jaundice aged from 3 weeks to 3 months. In all children with <b>prolonged</b> jaundice, we have examined complete blood count, urinalysis, blood chemistry (determination of total bilirubin and fractions, total protein, albumin, glucose) and used instrumental methods of examination — ultrasound of the abdominal cavity and cranial ultrasonography, electrocardiography. Most children with <b>prolonged</b> jaundice were breastfed and were term infants. Results. Indicators of physical development at birth (body weight, body length, head circumference, chest circumference) in children with <b>prolonged</b> jaundice and in healthy children had not statistically significant differences. Neonatal jaundice was <b>prolonged</b> in children, who were born from the first pregnancy, — 60 children (54. 1 %). A high level of total and indirect bilirubin was accompanied by a low level of albumin in the blood serum of children with <b>prolonged</b> jaundice.

5|$|Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) {{have been}} known to <b>prolong</b> and enhance the effects of psilocybin. Alcohol {{consumption}} may enhance the effects of psilocybin, because acetaldehyde, one of the primary breakdown metabolites of consumed alcohol, reacts with biogenic amines present in the body to produce MAOIs related to tetrahydroisoquinoline and β-carboline. Tobacco smokers may also experience more powerful effects with psilocybin, because tobacco smoke exposure decreases the activity of MAO in the brain and peripheral organs.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Recent studies {{investigating}} early graft function (EGF) {{after living}} donor kidney transplantation (LDKT) identified <b>prolonged</b> warm ischemia time (WIT) as {{a risk factor}} for the occurrence of poor EGF. The latter is associated with long-term graft loss; therefore the question arises whether <b>prolonged</b> WIT affects long-term outcomes in LDKT. METHODS: Data were collected on 472 consecutive adult LDKTs. Patients were divided according to the total WIT into 3 groups with short (45 minutes) WIT. RESULTS: Of all patients, 193 (40. 9 %) experienced short, 249 (52. 8 %) intermediate, and 30 (6. 4 %) <b>prolonged</b> WIT. <b>Prolonged</b> WIT was a significant risk factor for the occurrence of poor EGF with an adjusted odds ratio of 4. 252 (95 % confidence interval [CI), 1. 914 - 9. 447). Long-term graft survival was impaired in patients with <b>prolonged</b> WIT, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 3. 163 (95 % CI, 1. 202 - 8. 321). Multivariate analysis revealed determinants of <b>prolonged</b> WIT, including laparoscopic procurement, recipient overweight, right donor kidney, and multiple renal arteries. CONCLUSION: <b>Prolonged</b> WIT impairs long-term graft survival in LDKT. This finding underlines the need to develop strategies to avoid the occurrence of <b>prolonged</b> WIT in LDKT...|$|R
