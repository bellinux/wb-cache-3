60|$|I {{read all}} the {{newspapers}} I could get within a week after this event, and I do not remember in them a single expression of sympathy for these men. I have since seen one noble statement, in a Boston paper, not editorial. Some voluminous sheets decided not to print the full report of Brown's words {{to the exclusion of}} other matter. It was as if a publisher should reject the manuscript of the New Testament, and print Wilson's last speech. The same journal which contained this <b>pregnant</b> <b>news,</b> was chiefly filled, in parallel columns, with the reports of the political conventions that were being held. But the descent to them was too steep. They should have been spared this contrast,--been printed in an extra, at least. To turn from the voices and deeds of earnest men to the cackling of political conventions! Office-seekers and speech-makers, who do not so much as lay an honest egg, but wear their breasts bare upon an egg of chalk! Their great game is the game of straws, or rather that universal aboriginal game of the platter, at which the Indians cried hub, bub! Exclude the reports of religious and political conventions, and publish the words of a living man.|$|E

60|$|At {{last she}} rose and {{went out into the}} open to inquire if no {{messenger}} had yet arrived, for all that she knew there was not yet time for any messenger to have reached the chateau. She mounted the winding staircase of stone that led to the ramparts, and there alone, in the November sunshine, she paced to and fro for hours, waiting for news, straining her eyes to gaze up the valley of the Isere, watching for the horseman that must come that way. Then, as time sped on and the sun approached its setting and still no one came, she bethought her that if harm had befallen Marius, none would ride that night to Condillac. This very delay seemed <b>pregnant</b> with <b>news</b> of disaster. And then she shook off her fears and tried to comfort herself. There was not yet time. Besides, what had she to fear for Marius? He was strong and quick, and Fortunio was by his side. A man was surely dead by now at La Rochette; but that man could not be Marius.|$|R

50|$|Although they vow {{to forget}} about the {{incident}} and continue on with their lives, Xin Yi soon finds out that she is <b>pregnant</b> and the <b>news</b> soon reaches to Cun Xi. Initially, they decide to have an abortion, but Cun Xi changes his mind at the last minute and offers to financially support Xin Yi until the birth, but her family rejects this and thinks abortion is best. Cun Xi's grandmother, Granny Ji, however, is ecstatic over having a great-grandchild and forces the two to get married. Cun Xi, upset that he has been trapped into this situation, forces Xin Yi to agree to divorce after the birth, and in exchange for her silence about the marriage, she will relinquish the baby to him. She, however, refuses to accept any money he offers her for the pregnancy, which makes him question her motive for agreeing to the marriage.

He later becomes her confidant and a source of support in the face of Cun Xi's mistreatment.

40|$|Adopting {{a social}} constructionist {{perspective}} this research asks how are babies made? This question destabilises the local reproductive context asking how foetuses {{and their mothers}} have come to matter. I have analysed "everyday" texts broadly circulated in this context addressing matters related to pregnancy. These include health education posters intended to communicate health information to <b>pregnant</b> women, and <b>news</b> media articles from daily newspapers throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. Using a discourse analytic method, I have identified a strong discursive practice of subjectifying foetuses as entities separate from pregnant women with distinct identities: foetal persons. While foetal subjects take various forms, the dominant construction is the "unborn baby," a vulnerable infant who must be protected from harm and emerges as the central subject of pregnancy. The construction of pregnant subjects in these texts relates {{to the construction of}} foetal subjects. Pregnant women (and potentially pregnant women) arc reduced to their bodies' reproductive role as "maternal environments," ones which pose risks to the foetus. However, they are also constructed as maternal subjects. As "mothers," pregnant women are individually responsible for ensuring the health and wellbeing of foetuses. The "good mother" will of course do anything she can for her "child" by self-regulating her potentially harmful behaviour. The "acquiescent mother" acquiesces to biomedical interventions on behalf of the foetus. Pregnant subjects who do not self-regulate their behaviour and acquiesce to biomedical interventions are "bad" maternal subjects who harm their "children. " The discourses of biomedicine (and biomedical sciences) and public health, particularly those of risk, emerge as dominant in constructing and naturalising of these reproductive subjects. I consider the implications of these subjects for social practices around reproduction, and for midwifery practice...|$|R
5000|$|The series {{begins when}} Dona Hilda Santana (Catherine Siachoque), who is <b>pregnant,</b> {{receives}} the <b>news</b> {{of the death}} of her daughter Catalina [...] "La Grande" [...] (Carmen Villalobos), sending her into premature labor with her second daughter, Catalina [...] "La Pequeña" [...] (Carolina Gaitán). When Catalina (Carolina Gaitán) is born, her father Albeiro Marín (Fabián Ríos) and mother Hilda Santana fear she will share her late older sister's fate, as many of the young women in their neighborhood have historically become involved with prostitution and organized crime. In order to protect their daughter, Albeiro and Hilda paint a yellow boundary line outside of their home, forbidding Catalina from crossing it. Catalina then {{falls in love with a}} boy named Hernán Darío (Juan Pablo Urrego). After witnessing an attack upon Hernán Darío by Yésica Beltrán's (Majida Issa) bodyguards, Catalina crosses the yellow line to defend Dario from them. Hilda and Albeiro intervene to defend their daughter and are apprehended by the bodyguards. Yésica, resentful of Hilda, Albeiro, and Catalina, then orders her men to plant jewelry in Hilda's house in order to incriminate them of a crime they didn't commit. The police, by Yésica's orders, arrest Hernán Darío, Catalina, Dona Hilda, and Albeiro, incarcerating them in different prisons. Catalina is sent to a prison institution, where she is beaten by the fellow inmates and guards and nearly drowned. Hernán Darío is beaten and humiliated as well until Yésica and her daughter Daniela (Johanna Fadul) force him to work for them, threatening to hurt his family. Albeiro, along with fellow inmate David, plots to break out of prison in order to escape. Journalist Daniel Cerón helps Catalina and her parents escape, but Hernán Darío, convinced that Catalina is still in prison and in danger, agrees to work for Yésica's daughter Daniela. Daniela, deeply infatuated with Hernán Darío and viciously jealous of his relationship with Catalina, continually attempts to seduce Darío while in her employ.|$|R
