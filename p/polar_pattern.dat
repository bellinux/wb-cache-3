2500|$|Many {{types of}} input {{transducers}} {{can be found}} in a sound reinforcement system, with microphones being the most commonly used input device. [...] Microphones can be classified according to their method of transduction, pickup (or <b>polar)</b> <b>pattern</b> or their functional application. [...] Most microphones used in sound reinforcement are either dynamic or condenser microphones. One type of directional mics, called cardioid mics, are widely used in live sound, because they reduce pickup from the side and rear, helping to avoid unwanted feedback [...] "howls" [...] or [...] "screams" [...] from the monitors.|$|E
2500|$|An {{omnidirectional}} (or nondirectional) microphone's {{response is}} {{generally considered to be}} a perfect sphere in three dimensions. In the real world, this is not the case. As with directional microphones, the <b>polar</b> <b>pattern</b> for an [...] "omnidirectional" [...] microphone is a function of frequency. The body of the microphone is not infinitely small and, as a consequence, it tends to get in its own way with respect to sounds arriving from the rear, causing a slight flattening of the polar response. This flattening increases as the diameter of the microphone (assuming it's cylindrical) reaches the wavelength of the frequency in question. Therefore, the smallest diameter microphone gives the best omnidirectional characteristics at high frequencies.|$|E

2500|$|A microphone's {{directionality}} or <b>polar</b> <b>pattern</b> indicates how sensitive {{it is to}} sounds {{arriving at}} different angles about its central axis. [...] The polar patterns illustrated above represent the locus of points that produce the same signal level output in the microphone if a given sound pressure level (SPL) is generated from that point. How the physical body of the microphone is oriented relative to the diagrams depends on the microphone design. For large-membrane microphones {{such as in the}} Oktava (pictured above), the upward direction in the polar diagram is usually perpendicular to the microphone body, commonly known as [...] "side fire" [...] or [...] "side address". For small diaphragm microphones such as the Shure (also pictured above), it usually extends from the axis of the microphone commonly known as [...] "end fire" [...] or [...] "top/end address".|$|E
2500|$|Several {{approaches}} {{have been developed}} for effectively using a microphone in less-than-ideal acoustic spaces, which often suffer from excessive reflections from {{one or more of the}} surfaces (boundaries) that make up the space. If the microphone is placed in, or very close to, one of these boundaries, the reflections from that surface have the same timing as the direct sound, thus giving the microphone a hemispherical <b>polar</b> <b>pattern</b> and improved intelligibility. Initially this was done by placing an ordinary microphone adjacent to the surface, sometimes in a block of acoustically transparent foam. Sound engineers Ed Long and Ron Wickersham developed the concept of placing the diaphragm parallel to and facing the boundary. While the patent has expired, [...] "Pressure Zone Microphone" [...] and [...] "PZM" [...] are still active trademarks of Crown International, and the generic term [...] "boundary microphone" [...] is preferred. While a boundary microphone was initially implemented using an omnidirectional element, it is also possible to mount a directional microphone close enough to the surface to gain some of the benefits of this technique while retaining the directional properties of the element. Crown's trademark on this approach is [...] "Phase Coherent Cardioid" [...] or [...] "PCC," [...] but there are other makers who employ this technique as well.|$|E
2500|$|In 1996, Ralph D. Heinz of Renkus-Heinz {{received}} a patent for a multiple entry horn which incorporated multiple drivers for two bandpasses, high and mid, whose sound waves all exited {{into a single}} horn but at differing distances depending on the bandpass. It was marketed as the [...] "CoEntrant" [...] horn. The mid- and high-frequency drivers in the Renkus-Heinz ST/STX product line both exited through a [...] "Complex Conic" [...] waveguide. In the late 1990s, Thomas J. [...] "Tom" [...] Danley of Sound Physics Labs (also known as [...] "Servodrive") began working on a three-way multiple entry horn, bringing the SPL-td1 to market in 2000. The design used seven drivers, with one high frequency driver at the horn's throat, four mid-frequency drivers near the throat and two low frequency drivers ported closer to the horn mouth. In 2001, Tom Danley began developing the [...] "Unity" [...] horn for Yorkville Sound, patenting the improvement in 2002. Following the 2003 release of Yorkville's Unity line, Danley formed Danley Sound Labs and developed a significant improvement over the SPL-td1 called the [...] "Synergy" [...] horn, yielding substantially better phase and magnitude response along with smoother <b>polar</b> <b>pattern.</b> The synergy horn design promises greater power output achieved from a smaller loudspeaker enclosure. Because the design retains pattern control through its crossover regions and over a large range of its total bandwidth, and because the acoustic center of the design is near {{the rear of the}} enclosure, it is more easily combined in arrays for public address applications.|$|E
5000|$|The {{traditional}} B-format (...) only concerned {{itself with}} zeroth and first Ambisonic order.

40|$|AbstractRelevant {{features}} in the visual image are often spatially extensive and have complex orientation structure. Our perceptual sensitivity to such spatial form is demonstrated by <b>polar</b> Glass <b>patterns,</b> in which an array of randomly-positioned dot pairs that are each aligned with a particular polar displacement (rotation, for example) yield a salient impression of spatial structure. Such patterns are typically considered to be processed in two main stages: local spatial filtering in low-level visual cortex followed by spatial pooling and complex form selectivity in mid-level visual cortex. However, it remains unclear both whether reciprocal interactions within the cortical hierarchy are involved in <b>polar</b> Glass <b>pattern</b> processing and which mid-level areas identify and communicate <b>polar</b> Glass <b>pattern</b> structure. Here, we used {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) at 7 T to infer the magnitude of neural response within human low-level and mid-level visual cortex to <b>polar</b> Glass <b>patterns</b> of varying coherence (proportion of signal elements). The activity within low-level visual areas V 1 and V 2 was not significantly modulated by <b>polar</b> Glass <b>pattern</b> coherence, while the low-level area V 3, dorsal and ventral mid-level areas, and the human MT complex each showed a positive linear coherence response functions. The cortical processing of <b>polar</b> Glass <b>patterns</b> thus appears to involve primarily feedforward communication of local signals from V 1 and V 2, with initial polar form selectivity reached in V 3 and distributed to multiple pathways in mid-level visual cortex...|$|R
50|$|In physics a null is a {{point in}} a field where the field {{quantity}} is zero {{as the result of}} two or more opposing quantities completely cancelling each other. The field may be scalar, vector or tensor in nature. Common situations where nulls arise are in the <b>polar</b> <b>patterns</b> of microphones and antennae, and nulls caused by reflections of waves.|$|R

50|$|A {{directional}} boundary microphone is {{a boundary}} microphone with a directional <b>polar</b> <b>pattern</b> such as cardioid or supercardioid. One method {{to create a}} directional boundary mic is to mount panels (hard surfaces) next to an omnidirectional mic capsule.|$|E
5000|$|However, these {{enclosures}} {{are less}} efficient because, {{for the same}} driver, a dipole results in less sound pressure level than a closed or ported enclosure, and certainly far less than a properly designed horn. This means that the drivers mounted on a dipole enclosure must have large maximum excursions, large square areas, or both. One solution to these problems is to cross over to a closed or ported enclosure that handles the low frequencies. Another solution is to construct the dipole {{by means of a}} bipole with signal processing controlling the <b>polar</b> <b>pattern.</b> This enables switching between different polar patterns [...] or varying the <b>polar</b> <b>pattern</b> and efficiency versus frequency and versus output level.|$|E
50|$|In acoustics, {{it is used}} as {{a measure}} of the {{radiation}} pattern from a source indicating how much of the total energy from the source is radiating in a particular direction.

50|$|A common, and basic, radio antenna is the dipole. This has a figure-of-eight <b>polar</b> <b>pattern</b> {{with two}} nulls on {{opposite}} sides. Highly directional antennae, {{such as the}} Yagi have polar patterns very similar to highly directional microphones and for similar reasons. That is, they have multiple small lobes off the main direction with nulls between them.|$|E
50|$|The U 48 was {{identical}} to the U 47 except for the available <b>polar</b> <b>pattern</b> combinations (cardioid and figure of eight instead of cardioid and omnidirectional). According to Neumann: The Microphone Company. by Anselm Roessler, the U 48 was not introduced by Neumann until 1957. However, according to representatives at Georg Neumann GmbH, examples of the U48 existed as early as 1950.|$|E
50|$|Traditionally sound {{pressure}} is measured using microphones. Microphones have a <b>polar</b> <b>pattern</b> describing their sensitivity {{as a function}} of the direction of the incident sound. Many microphones have an omnidirectional <b>polar</b> <b>pattern</b> which means their sensitivity is independent of the direction of the incident sound. Microphones with other polar patterns exist that are more sensitive in a certain direction. This however is still no solution for the sound localization problem as one tries to determine either an exact direction, or a point of origin. Besides considering microphones that measure {{sound pressure}}, it is also possible to use a particle velocity probe to measure the acoustic particle velocity directly. The particle velocity is another quantity related to acoustic waves however, unlike sound pressure, particle velocity is a vector. By measuring particle velocity one obtains a source direction directly. Other more complicated methods using multiple sensors are also possible. Many of these methods use the time difference of arrival (TDOA) technique.|$|E
50|$|Some {{microphone}} {{techniques used}} for coverage of three front channels, include double-stereo techniques, INA-3 (Ideal Cardioid Arrangement), the Decca Tree setup and the OCT (Optimum Cardioid Triangle). Surround techniques are {{largely based on}} 3-channel techniques with additional microphones used for the surround channels. A distinguishing factor for the pickup of the front channels in surround is that less reverberation should be picked up, as the surround microphones {{will be responsible for}} the pickup of reverberation. Cardioid, hypercardioid, or supercardioid <b>polar</b> <b>patterns</b> will therefore often replace omnidirectional <b>polar</b> <b>patterns</b> for surround recordings. To compensate for the lost low-end of directional (pressure gradient) microphones, additional omnidirectional (pressure microphones), exhibiting an extended low-end response, can be added. The microphoneâs output is usually low-pass filtered.A simple surround microphone configuration involves the use of a front array in combination with two backward-facing omnidirectional room microphones placed about 10-15 meters away from the front array. If echoes are notable, the front array can be delayed appropriately. Alternatively, backward facing cardioid microphones can be placed closer to the front array for a similar reverberation pickup.|$|R
50|$|The spatial {{resolution}} of first-order Ambisonics {{as described above}} is quite low. In practice, that translates to slightly blurry sources, but also to a comparably small usable listening area or sweet spot. The resolution can be increased and the sweet spot enlarged by adding groups of more selective directional components to the B-format. These no longer correspond to conventional microphone <b>polar</b> <b>patterns,</b> but rather look like clover leaves. The resulting signal set is then called Second-, Third-, or collectively, Higher-order Ambisonics.|$|R
40|$|A {{new class}} of <b>polar</b> {{sampling}} <b>patterns</b> for projection imaging is described. In contrast to conventional techniques, a nonuniform variation of the angular increments between consecutive projections is introduced. The proposed method allows adaptation of the <b>polar</b> sampling <b>pattern</b> to different shapes of the object. Numerical simulations and MR experiments verify that angular sampling density can be varied according to the radial extension of the object, resulting in a reduction {{of the total number}} of required projections (and X-ray exposure) compared with conventional circular field-of-view imaging...|$|R
50|$|The {{result is}} a {{realistic}} stereo field that has reasonable compatibility with mono playback. Since the cardioid <b>polar</b> <b>pattern</b> rejects off-axis sound, less of the ambient room characteristics are picked up. This means that the mics can be placed {{farther away from the}} sound sources, resulting in a blend that may be more appealing. Further, the availability of purpose-built microphone mounts makes ORTF easy to achieve.|$|E
50|$|This {{coincident}} technique {{employs a}} bidirectional microphone (with a Figure of 8 <b>polar</b> <b>pattern)</b> facing sideways and a cardioid (generally {{a variety of}} cardioid, although Alan Blumlein described the usage of an omnidirectional transducer in his original patent) facing the sound source. The capsules are stacked vertically and brought together as closely as possible, to minimize comb filtering caused by differences in arrival time.|$|E

30|$|Moreover, it {{is known}} that the {{accuracy}} of motion predictor is very important to the adaptive pattern search. To improve the performance of adaptive search, extra related motion predictors can be used other than the initial MVP. The extra motion predictors utilized by ACQPPS algorithm only require an extension and a contraction of the initial MVP that can be easily obtained. Therefore, at the crossing of quarter circle and motion predictors, the search method is equipped with the adaptive crossed quarter <b>polar</b> <b>patterns</b> for efficient motion search.|$|R

The different combinations of these acronyms denote the techniques listed above and tested in our experiments. For instance, the term âOMNI DECâ stands for the hands-free communication system with two omnidirectional microphones (not in stereo configuration) and involving the decorrelation module, whereas the term âBF HYPâ stands for the beamforming based system with hypercardioid microphones and without the decorrelation module.|$|R
