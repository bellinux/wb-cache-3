After 11 years a new administrating committee (in {{collaboration with the}} Bourse de Paris) re-launched the BSE with a new internal bylaw, re-structured and streamlined mechanisms and trading systems. A new automated brokers system was introduced, based on the fixing price instead of the traditional OTC voice brokers. On November 22, 1996, the BSE officially re-launched the {{trading activity}} in its hall. The BSE and Bourse de Paris signed a cooperation agreement in June 1999 and the new European NSC-UNIX-Euronext system was set. In 2000, new forms of securities were listed such as GDR (Global Depository Receipt), investment funds shares, preferred stocks, <b>priority</b> <b>shares</b> and any other tradable derivatives.

40|$|The {{impact of}} {{separating}} cash flow and votes {{depends on the}} ownership structure. In widely held firms, one share - one vote is in general not optimal. While it ensures an efficient outcome in bidding contests, dual-class shares mitigate the free-rider problem, thereby promoting takeovers. In {{the presence of a}} controlling shareholder, one share - one vote promotes value-increasing control transfers and deters value-decreasing control transfers more effectively than any other vote allocation. Moreover, leveraging the insider's voting power aggravates agency conflicts because it protects her from the takeover threat and provides less alignment with other shareholders. Even so, minority shareholder protection is not a compelling argument for regulatory intervention, as rational investors anticipate the insider's opportunism. Rather, the rationale for mandating one share – one vote must be to disempower controlling minority shareholders in order to promote value-increasing takeovers. As this policy tends to empower managers vis-a-vis shareholders, it is an open question whether it would improve the quality of corporate governance, notably in systems built around large active owners. The verdict in the case of depositary certificates, <b>priority</b> <b>shares,</b> voting and ownership ceilings is less I ambiguous, since they insulate managers from both takeovers and effective shareholder monitoring.

This paper fills this shortage by proposing an integrated microscopic framework with: (i) a gap-acceptance algorithm giving relevant capacity estimates in uncongested regime; (ii) a probabilistic ratebased insertion decision module in congested regime. In this framework the car-following model can be implemented independently of the insertion decision making process. Moreover, its direct influence on the insertion decision model is released in congested regime thanks to a relaxation procedure. The obtained simulation results are convincing compared to on-field data collected at different sites for both peak and off-peak periods. 1...|$|R

Early in his term, Adams suspended the Treaty of Indian Springs after learning that the Governor of Georgia, George Troup, had forced the treaty on the Muscogee. Adams signed a new treaty with the Muskogee in January 1826 that allowed the Muskogee to stay but ceded most of their land to Georgia. Troup refused to accept its terms, and authorized all Georgian citizens to evict the Muskogee. A third treaty was signed in 1828, giving all of the Muskogee land to Georgia.|$|R

During the simulator re-training period of control room crews, 14 crews used the instrument <b>Shared</b> <b>Priorities</b> in one or two of their training scenarios.

Crews see meetings and other disseminations of information as an essential part of maintaining shared understanding of different situations.

40|$|One {{manifestation of}} {{division}} {{and the history}} of conflict in Northern Ireland is the parallel education system that exists for Protestants and Catholics.

Underpinned by intergroup contact theory, and reflecting educational <b>priorities</b> <b>shared</b> by all school sectors, the programme seeks to offer children from different denominational schools an opportunity to engage with each other on a sustained basis. In this article the authors adopt a quantitative approach to examining the impact of participation in the Sharing Education Programme on a range of outcomes (out-group attitudes, positive action tendencies and out-group trust) via, first, intergroup contact (cross-group friendships) and, second, intergroup anxiety. Their findings confirm the value of contact as a mechanism for promoting more harmonious relationships, and affirm the Sharing Education Programme as an initiative that can help promote social cohesion in a society that remains deeply divided...|$|R
40|$|Provisioning {{storage in}} disk arrays is a {{difficult}} problem because many applications with different workload characteristics and <b>priorities</b> <b>share</b> resources provided by the array. Currently, storage in disk arrays is statically partitioned, leading to difficult choices between over-provisioning to meet peak demands and resource sharing to meet efficiency targets. In this paper, we present Maestro, a feedback controller that can manage resources on large disk arrays to provide performance differentiation among multiple applications. Maestro monitors the performance of each application and dynamically allocates the array resources so that diverse performance requirements can be met without static partitioning. It supports multiple performance metrics (e. g., latency and throughput) and application priorities so that important applications receive better performance in case of resource contention. By ensuring that high-priority applications sharing storage with other applications obtain the performance levels they require, Maestro {{makes it possible to}} use storage resources efficiently. We evaluate Maestro using both synthetic and real-world workloads on a large, commercial disk array. Our experiments indicate that Maestro can reliably adjust the allocation of disk array resources to achieve application performance targets. 1...|$|R

40|$|A {{classical}} way {{to represent}} vehicle interactions at merges at the microscopic scale is to combine a gap-acceptance {{model with a}} car-following algorithm. However, in congested conditions (when a queue spills back on the major road), outputs of such a combination may be irrelevant if anticipatory aspects of vehicle behaviours are disregarded (like in single-level gap-acceptance models). Indeed, the insertion decision outcomes are so closely bound to the car-following algorithm that irrelevant results are produced. On the one hand, the insertion decision choice is sensitive to numerical errors due to the car-following algorithm. On the other hand, the <b>priority</b> <b>sharing</b> process observed in congestion cannot be correctly reproduced because of the constraints imposed by the car-following on the gap-acceptance model. To get over these issues, more sophisticated gap-acceptance algorithms accounting for cooperation and aggressiveness amongst drivers have been recently developed (multi-level gap-acceptance models). Another simpler solution, with fewer parameters, is investigated in this paper. It consists in introducing a relaxation procedure within the car-following rules and proposing a new insertion decision algorithm in order to loosen the links between both model components. This approach will be shown to accurately model the observed flow allocation pattern in congested conditions at an aggregate scale.
