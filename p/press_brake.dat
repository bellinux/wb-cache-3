5000|$|A <b>press</b> <b>brake</b> is {{a special}} type of machine press that bends sheet metal into shape. A {{good example of the}} type of work a <b>press</b> <b>brake</b> can do is the {{backplate}} of a computer case. Other examples include brackets, frame pieces and electronic enclosures. Some press brakes have CNC controls and can form parts with accuracy to a fraction of a millimetre. Bending forces can range up to 3,000 tons.|$|E

50|$|Presence Sensing Devices (PSD) {{are one of}} {{the more}} common safety devices for <b>press</b> <b>brake</b> safety. It is {{difficult}} to protect the operator using a metal bending machine such as a <b>press</b> <b>brake.</b> Often the operator must hold the sheet metal work-piece in one place while another portion of the piece is being formed in the die. If a foreign object is detected, the laser, camera, or light curtain technology will immediately retract the die or stop the motion of the ram. PSDs protect the operator and other employees in the area.|$|E
50|$|A <b>press</b> <b>brake</b> is {{a machine}} tool for bending {{sheet and plate}} material, most {{commonly}} sheet metal. It forms predetermined bends by clamping the workpiece between a matching punch and die.|$|E
50|$|<b>Press</b> <b>brakes</b> {{often include}} {{multi-axis}} computer-controlled back gauges. Optical sensors allow operators {{to make adjustments}} during the bending process. These sensors send real-time data about the bending angle in the bend cycle to machine controls that adjust process parameters.|$|R

50|$|These {{practical}} {{considerations for}} guarding are not exclusive to alligator shears. A {{much more common}} type of equipment, the <b>press</b> <b>brake,</b> also requires point of operation guarding when used with standardized stock, but not with large-dimension stock.|$|E

40|$|The {{application}} {{of stainless steel}} in structures is limited by its high cost compared to the more widely used carbon steel. Efficient use of the nonlinear and strain hardening material properties of stainless steel provides {{one way in which}} the initial cost may be reduced. During plastic deformation the increase in yield strength caused by cold working is more significant for stainless steel than carbon steel and it occurs in manufacturing cold rolled sheet material and in forming the sheet material into cold formed sections. The presented experimental program maps the strength increase from the codes minimum design values that are observed in <b>press</b> <b>braked</b> and cold rolled sections, most notably in the highly formed corner material. The distribution of material properties in hot rolled sections are also investigated. Associated with plastic deformation is the creation of residual stresses, the measurement of which {{have been made in the}} same hot rolled, <b>press</b> <b>braked</b> and cold rolled sections...|$|R
50|$|The most {{sophisticated}} recent machines may also add facilities for forming and bending, {{as well as}} punch cutting.

50|$|Cameras {{are another}} {{electronic}} safety device used for <b>press</b> <b>brake</b> safety. The camera can detect an intrusion between {{the upper and}} lower dies. If an intrusion is detected, a signal will stop the downward movement of the ram.
