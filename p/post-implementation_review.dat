40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to determine how project managers attribute information technology (IT) project success and failure. IT personnel from large Australian organisations completed an adapted version of the Attributional Styles questionnaire, which asked them to attribute causes along a number of attribution dimensions, for IT projects which have either succeeded or failed. The results indicate that IT support workers attribute failure to external factors, whilst attributing success to themselves. On the other hand, executive management took a more balanced perspective which attribute success to external factors and only partially to themselves, whereas they attribute significant personal responsibility for failure. More junior professionals and operational IT employees can learn from their senior professionals in attributing success and failure. <b>Post-implementation</b> <b>reviews</b> and debriefings conducted by senior IT professionals are ways of passing on their experience in relation to project and self-evaluations.

PT X Surabaya is a fabrication manufacturing company in Surabaya, of which sales are fire doors, architecture doors and components (metal sheet fabrication). Recently, PT X Surabaya change its old system into the new system. The changing of new system because of several factors such as changing in business needs, improved business processes, competitive advantage, the system integration, and so on. The new system of PT X Surabaya is supported by the software that can integrate information system of each department: Marketing, Purchasing, PPIC, Finance and Accounting, Human Resource, and Top Management. The system implementation start from October 2010 until now, however, there are problems occur in the new system such as the Purchasing Department cannot meet its goals and objectives to purchase the raw materials on time. Therefore, the researcher evaluate the system by using <b>Post-Implementation</b> <b>Review</b> factors and give the recommendations for the problems occurred. This research use the qualitative method by understanding the concept of <b>Post-Implementation</b> <b>Review.</b> To gather the information, the researcher use observation, interview, and documentary analysis as the data collection method.

It illustrates the difficulty of determining what effects should be considered by the standard-setter. The paper then discusses when effects should be reviewed. It agrees with the DP that effects need to be considered from inception of the project. It disagrees that the standard-setter should necessarily be responsible for all of the effects analysis. It argues that effects are likely to be different by geographical region and industry sector, and recourse should be had to national standard-setters and other organisations.

However, one major issue is that, historically, IT {{projects have}} high failure rates, with scholars asserting that ineffective stakeholder management strategies were {{a major factor}} for project failure. The purpose of this multiple case {{study was to explore}} strategies IT executives use for managing IT project stakeholders by exploring the experiences of 2 CIOs and 4 IT directors in two multinational companies, based in Switzerland. Stakeholder theory was the conceptual framework for this study. Data were collected through semistructured interviews and company documentation, and analyzed using Yin 2 ̆ 7 s 5 -step data analysis process to identify and code themes. Five main themes emerged from the data analysis: organizational culture, organizational maturity, leadership, competencies, and <b>post-implementation</b> <b>reviews.</b> The results of this study revealed the importance for leaders to articulate business strategies enabling stakeholders to have a common perspective on project objectives, and to act as a foundation upon which IT executives can create effective stakeholder management strategies.

Since 2001, SSA has reported spending about $ 5 billion on the modernization of its systems. Specifically, the agency has undertaken hundreds of modernization projects each year from 2001 to 2011, and officials identified 120 such initiatives that they considered to be key investments in modernization. About two-thirds of these projects were for modernizing and enhancing existing systems, while other efforts were aimed at moving from manual to electronic processes and online access, {{and the development of}} new or redesigned system software. These efforts also enhanced work processes, automated notices to beneficiaries, and modified systems to accommodate legislation, among other things.

40|$|Background: Current {{management}} of {{the second stage of}} labor often follows tradition-based routines rather than evidence-based practices. A lack of situational awareness and tunnel vision can limit medical decision-making. Northern New England Perinatal Quality Improvement Network (NNEPQIN) has listed Second Stage Situational Awareness as a priority initiative. Standardized checklists are useful for maintaining situational awareness. Regular debriefings using a standardized tool have been shown to improve communication and team based care, which generally leads to improved patient outcomes. Based on this evidence, developing a standardized checklist including regular hourly care team “huddles” is valuable and could result in improved birth outcomes. AIM Statement: The global aim of this project was to reduce variability in practice during the second stage of labor to improve neonatal birth outcomes. The specific aim was to implement a second stage situational awareness checklist with a completion percentage of 80 % by July 2015. Method: The theoretical framework guiding this project was Endsley’s theory of Situation Awareness. Pre-implementation chart reviews were conducted to determine what information was currently being documented during the second stage. A 9 -item checklist was developed based on hospital preference for use during hourly huddles once second stage was reached. Staff were educated on checklist use pre-implementation. <b>Post-implementation</b> chart <b>reviews</b> were conducted to determine checklist completion percentage. Results: Chart reviews demonstrated an average checklist completion percentage of 43 % over the two-week implementation period with a range of 22 - 89 %. Huddles were conducted and documented in 33 % of the reviewed delivery charts. Conclusions: Continued follow up and work re-design is needed to consistently incorporate the checklist and huddles into practice. Implications for the CNL: Implications for the CNL include continuing staff education to increase awareness and acceptance of the practice change, and examining project effects on perinatal outcomes including delivery mode and neonatal Apgar scoring...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (PhD) [...] Macquarie University, Faculty of Business and Economics, Dept. of Accounting and Corporate Governance, 2011. Bibliography: p. 273 - 293. Introduction [...] Methodology [...] Was the {{enactment}} of the CGT regime actuated by a perception that it will satisfy the policy objective of horizontal equity? [...] Is the perception that the CGT regime will satisfy the policy objective of horizontal equity a perception that is largely correct? [...] What reasons could (in theory) cause the CGT regime to produce outcomes that fail to satisfy horizontal equity? [...] What reasons in practice cause the CGT regime to produce outcomes that violate horizontal equity? [...] Is there reasons to expect outcomes that violate horizontal equity (caused by the CGT regime) to be widespread? [...] Overall conclusions, policy implications of them, and delimitations of the research. The research problem addressed in this thesis is: Does the Australian regime of income tax on capital gains cause widespread violation of horizontal equity? The conclusion drawn in this thesis is that there is reason to expect that the Australian regime of income tax on capital gains ("the CGT regime") can cause widespread violation of horizontal equity. That conclusion is reached by seeking answers to five questions: Question 1. Was {{the enactment}} of the CGT regime, and the continuance of it after enactment, actuated by a perception (of respectively the government which enacted it, and subsequent governments which yielded to its continuance) that the regime will satisfy the policy objective of horizontal equity?, and, if it was, Question 2. Is that perception largely correct?, and, if it is, Question 3. What reasons could (in theory) cause the CGT regime to produce outcomes that fail to satisfy horizontal equity (that is, outcomes that violate horizontal equity) ?, and, if such reasons exist, Question 4. Do those reasons (or any other) in practice cause the CGT regime to produce outcomes that violate horizontal equity?, and, if they do, Question 5. Is there reason to expect those outcomes to be widespread? [...] This thesis argues that only any one of four reasons can (in theory) cause the CGT regime to potentially produce outcomes that violate horizontal equity. Those four reasons (designated as respectively Reason A, Reason B, Reason C and Reason D) are: Reason A. The best interpretation (pursuant to the current approach of the Australian judiciary) of relevant legislative provisions can result in outcomes that violate horizontal equity. Reason B. Though the best interpretation (pursuant to the current approach of the Australian judiciary) of relevant legislative provisions does not result in outcomes that violate horizontal equity, the Australian judiciary's interpretation of those legislative provisions, not being compatible with the best interpretation of those legislative provisions (pursuant to the current approach of the Australian judiciary), can result in outcomes that violate horizontal equity. Reason C. Though the best interpretation (pursuant to the current approach of the Australian judiciary) of relevant legislative provisions does not result in outcomes that violate horizontal equity, the Commissioner's interpretation of those legislative provisions (generally, as evinced in rulings) can result in outcomes that violate horizontal equity. That would occur where the Commissioner's interpretation of relevant legislative provisions is not compatible with their best interpretation (pursuant to the current approach of the Australian judiciary). Reason D. Though the Australian judiciary's interpretation of relevant legislative provisions (despite not being the best interpretation of those legislative provisions, based on the current approach of the Australian judiciary) does not result in outcomes that violate horizontal equity, the Commissioner's interpretation of those legislative provisions (generally, as evinced in rulings) can result in outcomes that violate horizontal equity. That would occur where the Commissioner's interpretation of relevant legislative provisions is not compatible with their interpretation by the Australian judiciary (albeit, based on the current approach of the Australian judiciary, such interpretation of the Australian judiciary not being compatible with the best interpretation of those legislative provisions). [...] In the arrangements pursuant to which legislative provisions imposing CGT are enacted and implemented, there is an absence of systematic sensitivity to those four reasons. In those arrangements, there is also an absence of institutionalised processes (mandated by legislation or otherwise) for the identification of outcomes that violate horizontal equity, and effecting legislative amendments to prevent such outcomes. Due to those absences, in this thesis, the conclusion is reached that there is reason to expect outcomes from the detailed working of the CGT regime that violate horizontal equity to be widespread. [...] Those four reasons can be effectively addressed through: a consequentialist approach to interpreting legislative provisions imposing CGT, buttressed by legislative directives to the Australian judiciary and other means necessary for making such an approach practicable; <b>post-implementation</b> <b>reviews</b> of CGT measures enacted to ensure that those measures do not cause violation of horizontal equity; and enacting explicit legislative directives essentially precluding the Commissioner from issuing rulings (or any like pronouncements) which are inconsistent with judicial authority. [...] A status quo where there is reason to expect widespread violation of horizontal equity caused by the CGT regime may be perpetuated if those four reasons are not addressed. Such an outcome will retard sound tax administration because the public's willingness to optimally comply with a tax will not be fostered unless the public views that tax as one which satisfies horizontal equity. An absence of optimal compliance will make a tax inefficacious. The CGT may become a tax relegated to such a status if those four reasons are not addressed. Mode of access: World Wide Web. 293...|$|R

Despite the significant benefits that ERP systems provide, fewer than 30 % of ERP projects are successfully implemented, i. e. projects completed on time and on budget with all features and functions operating as specified (Wallace and Kremzar, 2001; Iskanius, 2009). Reasons underlying unsuccessful implementation include: dealing with ERP solely as software and not as a system; the inability to adopt a new organizational policy to implement ERP or to cope with the changes created by ERP; projects going over budget; projects being terminated before the implementation begins; and failure to achieve the planned objectives (Shah et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2003). The ERP life cycle can be divided simply into three main stages; the pre-Implementation; during Implementation; and after Go-Live or post-implementation phase.

ABSTRACT:Historically, the transition from rural routes, with typically high speeds, to urban routes with speeds of {{up to half of}} the latter, has resulted in excessive speeding in such, as well as the corresponding high accident rates. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to present the applicability of modern roundabouts to manage these transitions, possible enhancements and the perceptions of road users. On the R 60 approaching Robertson from Ashton, a modern roundabout was constructed in 2003. The roundabout was identified as a measure to control the rural/urban transition and contribute to controlling speeds through the town thus improving safety. This paper determines whether the objective for the construction of the roundabout has been achieved. A <b>post-implementation</b> <b>review</b> was embarked upon to establish if the holistic design application was appropriate. Further what, if any, additional measures could be implemented to improve operation. Interviews have been undertaken with responsible authorities and road users, both regular and incidental, to determine their perceptions. The paper concludes with recommendations regarding the suitability of modern roundabouts as a measure to manage the transition between the rural and urban environment, possible design improvements and present the road-user’s perceptions.

40|$|This audit {{assessed}} {{the effectiveness of}} selected departments’ implementation of the Deregulation Agenda: Cutting Red Tape initiatives. Conclusion The incoming Government’s Deregulation Agenda included an annual net reduction target of at least $ 1 billion in red tape, and on taking office in late 2013, internal portfolio-level reduction targets were set by Ministers, with a combined value of $ 2. 65 billion for 2014 and 2015. By the end of 2015, the Government had publicly announced measures to deliver estimated total net savings of $ 4. 80 billion. Portfolio reporting to PM&C advised that some $ 3. 97 billion in net savings had been implemented in 2014 and 2015 —exceeding the internal target of $ 2. 65 billion by $ 1. 32 billion. PM&C moved quickly {{to put in place}} a governance framework to support implementation of the incoming Government’s Deregulation Agenda. The selected departments established internal Deregulation Units with clearly articulated roles, responsibilities and consultative mechanisms, and involved senior APS leaders to provide impetus. The selected departments’ approaches to calculating the savings (and in some cases the costs) of the 29 measures examined by the ANAO was consistent with whole-of-government guidance provided by PM&C and had regard to government expectations that departments adopt a risk-based and proportionate approach to assessing the benefits of removing or adjusting regulatory arrangements. Ministers agreed in December 2013 that significant regulatory changes—potentially including some red tape reduction measures—would be subject to a <b>post-implementation</b> <b>review</b> process within five years, and that the economic impacts of the overall Deregulation Agenda would be assessed by the Productivity Commission or another equivalent body within three years. As at the end of 2015, no whole-of-government post-implementation reviews or evaluations had been conducted, although some of the audited portfolios advised that they planned to undertake stakeholder surveys. Portfolio-level surveys are not a substitute for the structured third-party assessment of impact agreed by Ministers at the commencement of the program, and PM&C should take the necessary steps to implement the Australian Government’s decision that the Deregulation Agenda’s economic impacts be assessed within three years...|$|E
40|$|The {{institutional}} and financial circumstances at many transit agencies significantly constrain the bus planning process. Long-term planning focuses on major infrastructure projects, while short-term planning focuses on scheduling and minor service adjustments. Medium-range bus planning is given limited attention in many agencies, {{especially those with}} significant capacity constraints. Recent research has developed a new method of assembling data {{that has the potential}} to be very useful to service planners: origin, destination, and interchange inference (ODX), which uses farecard and vehicle location data to provide a previously unavailable level of geographically precise disaggregate data on passengers' linked trips. This research develops a framework for using ODX for medium- to long-range bus planning. It proposes a service planning process that targets limited resources at the areas that need them most. It develops tools and methods for using ODX data to design and evaluate realistic, practical, and incremental service changes to improve accessibility to key parts of the agency's service area. The process has five phases: identification of target locations, analysis of those locations, development of proposed service changes, evaluation of those proposals, and <b>post-implementation</b> <b>review.</b> Several case studies are presented using data from the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA), the transit agency for the Boston region. First, three target locations in the MBTA service area are analyzed. Service changes that would improve access to each of these locations are proposed and evaluated, including additional frequency on an existing route, the creation of a new route, and extensions of two existing routes. ODX and related data are used to analyze each proposal in detail in a process that can be replicated by other agencies with similar data. by Catherine Vanderwaart. Thesis: M. C.

40|$|As {{capital markets}} become more {{integrated}} and globalized, standard setting in financial accounting faces multiple challenges. Financial accounting standards must adapt {{and change in}} ways that make them usable to firms in varying institutional and economic settings, and by extension, make the financial statements produced under those standards useful to capital market participants worldwide. A {{question that arises is}} how to ensure corporate transparency and faithfully represented financial reports, and whether principles-based – rather than rules-based – standards are superior in this context. Two areas of particular interest to standard setters are mandatory disclosures made within the scope of the standards, and judgments and estimates required by financial statement preparers when standards are predominantly principles-based. This thesis investigates quality implications of features pertaining to three different accounting standards: IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements, IAS 19 Employee Benefits and IFRS 9 Financial Instruments. The underlying aim is to draw conclusions about effects on accounting usefulness of the various accounting methods and disclosure and recognition rules prescribed by these standards. The rationale for this type of research can be derived from the IASB's own requirements that a <b>post-implementation</b> <b>review</b> (PIR) be executed whenever significant financial reporting changes are introduced by a new or revised standard. The studies carried out within the scope of this thesis show that in accounting for certain discretionary items related to employee benefits, there appears to be improvements in transparency as firms are required by the amended IAS 19 to move previously off-balance-sheet items onto the balance sheet, thus formally recognizing them rather than merely disclosing them in the supplementary notes. Further, evidence on disclosures made in accordance with IAS 1 points to comparability issues and to the disclosures being of varying quality, with accounting outcomes being contingent on the individual firm’s contextual factors. This indicates that the principles-based disclosure standards that are currently favored by standard setters do not work as well as expected. Meanwhile, as regards estimation of credit losses in banks, there is evidence to support the current move towards a more principles-based standard (IFRS 9), provided that there is enforcement of adequate quality...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{addresses the}} goodwill impairment test under IFRS, which prescribes that goodwill is not amortized and instead tested for impairment {{at least once}} a year. The objective of introducing this impairment-only approach in 2004 was to provide more useful information to financial statement users. The dissertation is thereforemotivated by the ongoing debate on the decision usefulness and reliability of goodwill impairment tests, as the IASB’s recent <b>post-implementation</b> <b>review</b> on business combinations shows, and the high practical relevance of this topic for firms, auditors, enforcement institutions, and regulators. Against this background, the dissertation (1) sets forth and critically discusses the accounting requirements for goodwill, (2) develops an audit approach for goodwill impairment tests, (3) empirically assesses whether goodwill impairment tests are used as a device for earnings management, and (4) performs two empirical studies to analyze how goodwill impairments are perceived by capital market participants. Based on the requirements of international and German auditing standards and the author’s practical audit experience, a risk-based audit approach is developed that outlines the different audit steps necessary to verify the reasonableness of goodwill impairment tests including practical application guidance for auditors. Using a sample of German listed firms for the periods 2006 to 2013, the main findings of the three empirical studies are that (1) the likelihood to recognize goodwill impairments and the magnitude of impairment losses are influenced by earnings management incentives, (2) investors perceive goodwill impairments as value relevant, but not timely recognized, and (3) the announcement of goodwill impairments leads to a negative capital market reaction, but the reaction is considerably smaller than the goodwill amount written off. Moreover, the perceived timeliness of goodwill impairments is shown to be influenced by auditor characteristics, which serve as a proxy for perceived audit quality. Overall, the empirical results therefore indicate that the concept of impairment testing might generally have merits in reflecting the economic value and consumption of goodwill, but that current accounting requirements might not be sufficient to ensure a rigorous impairment test providing adequate decision useful information. Hence, improvements of the current approach or the implementation of a different approach, e. g. based on certain amortization requirements with indication-based impairment testing, should be discussed...|$|E
40|$|This thesis aims at {{investigating}} {{the level of}} service at departure area of KKIA. The study further measures the perceived quality of service and passenger satisfaction in term of tangibles, reliability, responsiveness, assurance and empathy by using five steps of lean six sigma (Define, Measure, Analyse, Improve and Control). The study aims to implement and {{evaluate the effectiveness of}} using a lean six-sigma managerial approach to the departure area of KKIA to enhance the level of service (LOS) and customer satisfaction. The passenger flow through the airport is used to measure the quality of services. Existing studies that discuss lean six-sigma implementation in airports were evaluated. Data was collected about KKIA departure area and its LOS {{both before and after the}} lean six-sigma implementation. Additionally, a SERVQUAL questionnaire was used to evaluate pre- and <b>post-implementation</b> <b>review.</b> The questionnaire features easy-to-collect data to measuring the perceived quality of service and evaluate passenger satisfaction with the LOS in KKIA. Before the study concepts of LOS and Lean was unheard within the airport community. Initial evaluation show poor customer service and many delays (waste) within the departure are at KKIA. During the study a growing awareness of Lean and LOS showed improvements in the customers’ experience, e. g, removing the shop at the entrance, improving flow thought the airport. Concluding the study, there was a total reduction in waiting from 54. 74 minutes to 34. 87 minutes (35. 7 % reduction). Also the LOS on the IATA Performance Standard went from E (Inadequate) to C (Good). This is improvement, excellent but without continuous improvements the Airport’s LOS will reduce back as passenger numbers grow from 16 million passengers per year (up from 9. 8 million in 2004), to an expected 25 million by 2025. Interesting different cultural approaches to lean management became evident during the study when compared to other implementations in Europe to the Middle East. Cultural difference will always affected the reliability of the results. However, by considering these cultural effects in answering questions and interviews, the lean implementation was still successful. As culture changes are ongoing, evaluation of the situation at KKIA is required for ongoing improvements. Best-practice for the continued improvement of ongoing lean management is suggested for the departure area at KKIA. These key strategies and best-practice approaches are useful to future implementations at other airports. Saudi Arabia government scholarshi...|$|E
40|$|In {{the early}} 1980 s, a general dissatisfaction {{developed}} with traditional accountingbased performance measurement in the New Zealand public sector. The not-forprofit nature of public sector organisations {{had led to}} a perceived lack of transparency and accountability in their managerial styles. A change in management philosophy in the 1980 s due to pressures from stakeholders, for example the government, and competition as well as rising costs (Local Government Forum, 1999) prompted public sector management to search for effective contemporary management tools to navigate towards public goals and expectations. The Balanced Scorecard (BSC), a performance measurement and a strategic management system, has been implemented in business organisations with success and is gaining acceptance in not-for-profit and public sector organisations. Despite potential benefits to public sector organisations, there are challenges and problems for implementers of the BSC (Griffiths, 2003). The research reported here examined NZ local government managers' experiences of implementing and using the BSC in local government organisations and their perceptions of its usefulness as a performance measurement and strategic management tool. It also sought to identify the factors that drive local government managers to undertake a BSC initiative, and the potential causes of BSC programme failure in the NZ local government context. The aim {{of this research was}} to provide an answer to the following question: "What is the current status of the use of the Balanced Scorecard as a performance measurement and a strategic management tool in local government organisations in NZ?" The research addressed the following questions: • Has the BSC been accepted as a performance measurement and/or a strategic management tool by local government organisations in NZ? • How do local government managers perceive the BSC as a management tool? • What factors are perceived to contribute to the successful implementation of the BSC? • What factors are perceived to contribute to partial and/or non implementation of the BSC? The findings indicated that the BSC is not widely used by NZ local government organisations. This is due to a variety of reasons. With regards to the research questions, the eight respondents who are current BSC users perceived the concept as; • a very useful management tool overall • a highly valid performance management tool • a highly valid strategic management tool The findings {{of this study suggest that}} the majority of NZ local government organisations are encountering problems with their BSC implementations and, at the same time, are learning as they go. Some interesting lessons for successful BSC implementation to emerge from this study include the need to ensure: • a full and participative pre-implementation decision process; • benchmarking best practice; • continuous learning and training; • adequate resources; • management support; • appropriate <b>post-implementation</b> <b>review.</b> Although this study reveals that reported BSC usage is currently low, applying these lessons may help to improve the perceived and actual usefulness of the BSC for measuring and managing the performance of NZ local government organisations...|$|E
