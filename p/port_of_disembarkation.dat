The Fraser River was navigable to Yale, above which a fearsome torrent {{inhibited}} regular navigation. Gold seekers were travelling to the area and to the British Columbia Interior and thus wanted to move from Victoria, the deep sea port, by shallow draft steamer. A Hudson's Bay fort at Fort Langley, sat some 30 mi inland from tidewater. Regular steamer service ran on the Fraser River as far as Yale and also shortly afterwards via the Harrison River up {{to the head of}} Harrison Lake, where a townsite named Port Douglas became the <b>port</b> <b>of</b> <b>disembarkation</b> for the Douglas Road, also known as the Lakes Route or Lillooet Trail, which ran via a series of lakes and wagon-road portages to Cayoosh Flat, the other major boomtown of the early gold rush alongside Yale and Port Douglas.|$|E

40|$|The cruise {{industry}} {{can be considered}} a new niche in the tourist sector, especially in Gothenburg where it begun to take of when the Gothenburg Cruise Network was created in 2009. Tourism is often seen as a good way to increase the income and create employment in declining areas earlier dependent on. While studying the cruise tourism in Gothenburg it has shown that the economic impact of this particular niche has not affected the area to any major extent. In order gain a greater economic advantage from the increasing cruise tourism the study has shown the importance <b>of</b> becoming the <b>port</b> <b>of</b> embarkation and <b>disembarkation,</b> which results in greater spending per passenger. To become a successful cruise port the cooperation between the port and the cities tourist organisation is important; networks with members from different sectors are created working together to attract the cruise lines. On the regional level the networks are created with members consisting of the local networks. Cruise Baltic is the regional network in the Baltic Sea and are working together to create an attractive destination for the cruise lines. In order to do that unified port standards are created and the more developed cruise ports are helping their newer competitors. Competitors’ working together to develop the destination creates a synergy, which favours the whole region...|$|R

40|$|One out {{of every}} three people lacks access to {{sufficient}} nourishment in sub-Saharan Africa, the region with the greatest food insecurity in the world today. Low agricultural productivity and expansionary demographic trends will necessitate greater reliance on imports if the food needs of the region are to be met in the future. However, sub-Saharan Africa is distant from major food export markets, and many of its countries are landlocked. In my research, I quantify the influence of the region?s transport-prohibitive characteristics on food security. By constructing regression models from agricultural trade data, I demonstrate that geographically isolated countries face substantially higher grain import prices, and these higher prices can raise the prevalence of hunger. I find that 300 kilometers between the <b>port</b> <b>of</b> <b>disembarkation</b> and the major population agglomeration in the importing country explains a one percentage point increase in the undernourished population. This result highlights the needs for infrastructure investment and low trade barriers to minimize the cost of remoteness and promote the eradication of hunger in the region...|$|E
40|$|In September 1346, Edward III {{brought his}} victorious army {{to the gates}} of Calais to begin a siege that over 12 months {{developed}} into the largest military operation conducted by the English on French soil during the fourteenth century. It is also perhaps the least understood campaign of Edward III’s reign, because {{of the loss of}} the army pay records. We know from chronicles that the men of Calais conducted a heroic defence of their town, and we know too that the English created and maintained an enormous logistical operation first to besiege and then to capture the port. What is little understood, however, is the scale, scope and chronology of the siege. The role played by English naval forces has received little attention, yet there is a series of pay records relating to their service which can compensate for the loss of the vadia guerre accounts and which can enrich understanding of the campaign. Using this evidence, this article reappraises the whole expedition, highlights the numbers of ships and mariners involved in the siege, and draws attention to periods of intensive military activity. Edward III’s ultimate objective was to capture, hold and use the town as a safe <b>port</b> <b>of</b> <b>disembarkation</b> for future invasions...|$|E

The fleet sailed from the <b>port</b> <b>of</b> Athens, passed up through the narrow strait called Euripus, lying between the island of Euboea and the main land, and finally landed at a favorable point <b>of</b> <b>disembarkation,</b> south <b>of</b> Thessaly. From this point the forces marched to the northward until they reached the Peneus, and then established themselves at the narrowest part of the passage between the mountains, strengthened their position there as much as possible, and awaited the coming of the enemy. The amount of the force was ten thousand men.|$|R

40|$|This article {{argues for}} the {{importance}} of religion in mass emigration from Britain in the nineteenth century. It does so by examining the origins and development of the Anglican emigrant chaplaincy developed from the 1840 s to nurture the spiritual welfare of British emigrants departing for the British settler colonies over the rest of the nineteenth century. Developed over succeeding decades by the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel and the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, the chaplaincy expanded into a global network. By the 1880 s it incorporated chaplains at British <b>ports</b> <b>of</b> embarkation and colonial ones <b>of</b> <b>disembarkation,</b> chaplains travelling on ships with emigrants and matrons supervising parties of single women. Although principally concerned with caring for Anglican emigrants, the chaplains regarded it as their business, as clergy of the national church, to provide ministry {{to a wide variety of}} emigrants, including Nonconformists, Germans and Jews. The article argues for the significance of the Anglican emigrant chaplaincy as an international network enabling the expansion of British Christianity and the export of social capital in the form of religious connectivity throughout the settler colonies of the British Empire...|$|R
