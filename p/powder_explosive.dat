40|$|The growing {{threats and}} {{terrorist}} activities {{in recent years}} have urged the need for rapid and accurate forensic investigation on post-blast samples. The analysis of explosives and their degradation products in soils are important to enable forensic scientist to identify the explosives used in the bombing and establish possible links to their likely origin. Anions of interest for post-blast identification of low explosives were detected and identified using ion chromatography (IC). IC separations of five anions (Cl -, NO 2 -, NO 3 -, SO 4 2 -, SCN-) employed a Metrosep Anion Dual 2 column with carbonate eluent. The anions were separated within 17 minutes. Sampling of post blast residues was carried out in Rompin, Pahang. The post-blast explosive residues were extracted from soil samples collected at the seat of three simulated explosion points. The homemade explosives comprised of black powder of various amounts (100 g, 150 g and 200 g) packed in small plastic sauce bottles. In black powder standard, three anions (Cl-, NO 3 -, SO 4 2 -) were identified. However, low amounts of nitrite (NO 2 -) were found present in post-blast soil samples. The amounts of anions were generally found to be decreased with decreasing amount of black <b>powder</b> <b>explosive</b> used. The anions analysis was indicative that nitrates were being used as one of the black <b>powder</b> <b>explosive</b> ingredients...|$|E

40|$|In recent years, {{terrorist}} activities and bombing incidents that are widespread to specific region worldwide have generated {{the need for}} rapid investigation on postblast residues. The analysis of inorganic ions contained in homemade explosives and explosive residues in soils demands the rapid determination and identification of explosives compounds and materials used to commit such unlawful bombings. In this study, anions and cations of interest for post-blast identification of homemade explosives were detected and identified using ion chromatography (IC). The postblast explosive residues were extracted from soil samples collected at the seat of simulated explosion point The homemade explosives comprised black powder of various amounts (100 g, 150 g and 200 g). The sample extracts were tested for five anions (Cl NC> 2 ‘, NO 3 ', SO 42 ’, SOT) and four cations (Li+, Na+, NRT, KT). Two IC separations were employed, using suppressed IC on a Metrosep Anion Dual 2 column with carbonate eluent for anions, and non-suppressed IC for cations using Metrosep C 4 column with nitric acid and dipicolinic acid as eluent. The detection limit for anions ranged from 0. 1 - 100 ppb and 0. 1 - 84 ppb for cations. All ions showed good linear calibration (rz> 0. 9326) over the range 1 to 5 ppm. Excellent reproducibility was achieved for within-day and day-to-day variation of target analytes. In black powder standard, three anions (C 1 ' 5 NOi’, SC^ 2 -) and two cations (Na and KT) were identified. An additional anion (NO 2 ") was found present in postblast soil samples. The amounts of ions {{were found to be}} decreased with decreasing amount of black <b>powder</b> <b>explosive</b> used. By noting the presence of these ions, it was concluded that the explosive contained potassium nitrate which is a strong evidence for the use of black <b>powder</b> <b>explosive</b> in the improvised explosive device...|$|E

40|$|In recent years, active {{research}} on explosives in exploring its effective {{use in the}} field of engineering is widely carried out. One way of instant initiation of explosive is by means of a metal wire explosion. The wire explosion technique generates plane shock waves produced by exploding parallel metal wire rows using a high voltage impulsive current. This method has been performed as mass shock compaction processing technology, such as shock synthesis of industrial diamond. The present study was undertaken to investigate the behavior of copper pipe by the detonation of PETN <b>powder</b> <b>explosive</b> initiated by metal wire explosion. This was carried out with the motivation to know the effect of PETN on the structure, which was detonated by metal wire explosion, and the detonation state of PETN. A copper wire exploded using metal wire explosion technique, was used to initiate the PETN filled in the copper pipe. The expansion process of the copper pipe by the detonation of PETN was evaluated by the optical observation using high-speed camera and the numerical analysis using LS-DYNA 3 D. The results on the expansion velocity of copper pipes showed a variation depending on the initiation and the amount of PETN used for the expansion...|$|E
40|$|Particle {{size and}} {{distribution}} {{play an important}} role in ignition. The size and distribution of the cyclotetramethylene tetranitramine (HMX) particles were investigated by Laser Particle Size Analyzer Malvern MS 2000 before experiment and calculation. The mean size of particles is 161 [*]μm. Minimum and maximum sizes are 80 [*]μm and 263 [*]μm, respectively. The distribution function is like a quadratic function. Based on the distribution of micron scale explosive particles, a microscopic model is established to describe the process of ignition of HMX particles under drop weight. Both temperature of contact zones and ignition probability of <b>powder</b> <b>explosive</b> can be predicted. The calculated results show that the temperature of the contact zones between the particles and the drop weight surface increases faster and higher than that of the contact zones between two neighboring particles. For HMX particles, with all other conditions being kept constant, if the drop height is less than 0. 1 [*]m, ignition probability will be close to 0. When the drop heights are 0. 2 [*]m and 0. 3 [*]m, the ignition probability is 0. 27 and 0. 64, respectively, whereas when the drop height is more than 0. 4 [*]m, ignition probability will be close to 0. 82. In comparison with experimental results, the two curves are reasonably close to each other, which indicates our model has a certain degree of rationality...|$|E
40|$|The MAX phase Ti 3 SiC 2 {{has been}} {{synthesized}} from starting powder mixtures {{which do not}} include pure titanium. The presence of pure titanium in a powder is problematic because of its oxidizing, and {{in the form of}} a finely divided <b>powder,</b> <b>explosive</b> nature. The aim of this study was to evaluate the synthesis of bulk polycrystalline samples of Ti 3 SiC 2 from a starting powder mixture which is more suited for large scale production. Titanium silicon carbide MAX phase was synthesized by pressureless sintering of ball milled TiC and Si powders of six different compositions. The sintering reactions were evaluated in situ by dilatometer analysis under flowing argon gas. The as-sintered samples were evaluated using mainly x-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. This study showed that titanium carbide, silicon carbide and titanium disilicide were present as intermediate or secondary phases in the samples. Our results indicate that TiSi 2 is an intermediate phase to the formation of Ti 3 SiC 2 when excess Si is present. The excess of silicon also proved beneficial for the synthesis of the MAX phase and there is a Si content which is optimal with respect to the maximum MAX phase content of the final product. The Ti 3 SiC 2 was found to decompose into TiC and gaseous Si at high temperatures. Godkänd; 2009; 20080917 (idaker...|$|E
