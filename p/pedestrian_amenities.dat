Therefore, the aim of this research is to improve the signal control at pedestrian crossings, so that optimisation takes into account the total delay to all road users including pedestrians. Upstream Detection and Volumetric Detection at pedestrian crossing facilities have been identified as potential alternatives that might enhance <b>pedestrian</b> <b>amenity.</b> These new possibilities were evaluated using a micro-simulation software. Research to date has shown that the VISSIM model is suitable for this evaluation and the latest algorithm for signal controlled pedestrian crossing, the Puffin has been coded into the model and tested. The Puffin then formed a base control strategy against which new strategies were evaluated. The new strategies were then evaluated based on travel delay to both vehicle and pedestrian and also financial benefit to the road crossing. After calibration and validation in VISSIM model, an Upstream Detection and Volumetric Detection were developed. In the Upstream Detection, a push button was located 5 meters at an upstream location of the crossing. In the Volumetric Detection, the optimum maximum green was determined based on the lowest total person delay and total delay costs. Generally, an Upstream Detection caused a reduction in total person delay and total delay costs at a lower vehicle flow. The Volumetric Detection caused a reduction in total person delay and total delay costs at all vehicle and pedestrian flow combinations. The results showed that both Upstream Detection and Volumetric Detection have promising benefits to implement at Puffin crossing. Upstream Detection has a clear benefit at a lower vehicle flow while the Volumetric Detection shows there are changes on maximum green settings at a lower vehicle flow as pedestrian flow increases...|$|R

40|$|The work of VRU-TOO is {{targeted}} specifically at {{the application of}} ATT for reducing risk and improving comfort (e. g. minimisation of delay) for Vulnerable Road Users, namely pedestrians. To achieve this, the project operates at three levels. At the European level practical pilot implementations in three countries (U. K., Portugal and Greece) are linked with behavioural studies of the micro-level interaction of pedestrians and vehicles {{and the development of}} computer simulation models. At the National level, the appropriate Highway Authorities are consulted, according to their functions, for the pilot implementations and informed of the results. Finally, at the local level, the pilot project work is fitted into specfic local (municipality) policy contexts in all three pilot project sites. The present report focuses on the Elefsina pilot application in Greece and the relevant National and Local policy contexts are the following. At the National level, the ultimate responsibility for road safety and signal installations rests with the Ministry of Environment and Public Works. The Ministry is responsible for the adoption of standards and solutions for problems and also for a large number of actual installations, since local authorities lack the size and expertise to undertake such work on their own One of the project's aims is to provide information to the Ministry as to the suitability of the methods developed for aiding pedestrian movement, ultimately leading to a specification for its wider use. The Ministry is expecting to use the final {{results of the present study}} for possible modifications of its present standards for pedestrian controlled traffic signals. At the local level (Elefsina) the municipality has, in the past, pursued environmental improvements through pedestrianisation schemes in the city centre. At the same time it has developed a special traffic management policy, to solve a particularly serious problem of through traffic. A summary of the policy is contained in Appendix A and more details in a previous deliverable (Tillis, 1992). In the particular case of Elefsina pedestrian induced delay to through vehicular traffic, may form a key element in this policy ensuring at the same time, an incentive to divert to the existing bypass and enhancing pedestrian movement. The effectiveness of pedestrian detection techniques tested in the pilot, will provide valuable information on the future implementation of the policy. Thus, the Elefsina Pilot Project operates at the same time on three levels: It provides a basis, in combination with the other two pilot project sites, for comparing the effects of pedestrian detection on pedestrian safety and comfort at a European level. It provides information to the National authorities (Ministry of Environment and Public Works) for their standards setting, scheme design and implementation tasks. It fits into a comprehensive plan at the local level for effecting environmental improvements and enhancing <b>pedestrian</b> <b>amenity</b> and comfort at the same time. In addition, an investigation into the capabilities of pedestrian detectors to function as data collection devices, was performed. The data 'quality gap' betweenvehicular and pedestrian tr&c may be closed with the utilisation of microwave pedestrian detectors, providing a more solid foundation for the planning for total person movement through networks (vehicle occupants, public transport passengers, pedestrians).

2500|$|Project Wagtail was {{the brainchild}} of {{resident}} Jez Lilley who received a £15,000 grant from Birmingham City Council in 1988 to help transform an area of wasteland to the south of the estate into a nature reserve. He campaigned to schools and businesses and around 500 people helped plant trees and shrubs in the area. Lilley also established a gardening club and was given an office at The Fort Centre, on Farnborough Road. The office became a drop-in centre for unwanted pets and a bird of prey centre was set up, housing fourteen birds. Lilley also envisaged a footpath to encircle the estate and this idea was presented to Richard Temple Cox in 1994, who later offered Lilley a job as Community Development Officer with an environmental remit. Project Wagtail became his priority and it was funded {{over the next two years}} by the HAT, Groundwork Birmingham and Birmingham City Council.

40|$|Although a {{significant}} number of trips are made by foot in developing cities, <b>pedestrian</b> infrastructure, <b>amenities,</b> and services are often neglected in municipal planning and budgets. Since helping city planners understand the scope and extent of local pedestrian conditions relative to other cities would be a positive step towards improving the quality of the pedestrian environment, I was retained by the World Bank to devise a walkability index, which would rank cities across the world based on the safety, security, and convenience of their pedestrian environments. To accomplish this task, I first generated a list of Index variables by studying existing tools for evaluating non-motorized transport and by consulting experts from a variety of related fields. After considering different methods for survey area selection, field data collection, and data aggregation, I created prototypes of the index and survey materials and organized field tests in cities throughout the world, including Beijing, Washington, and Delhi. I also oversaw a full-scale pilot in Ahmedabad, India, where 65 volunteers from the Centre for Environmental Planning and Technology (CEPT) conducted physical infrastructure, public agency, and pedestrian surveys in eight neighborhoods, which were selected using a random spatial sampling method. Results from these tests and pilot were used to refine the Index composition and data collection methodologies, resulting in a two-pronged tool. Since, out of practical necessity, the Global Walkability Index's robustness is limited by its simplicity (the Index is primarily intended to generate awareness of walkability as an important issue),(cont.) I developed an additional set of Extended Survey Materials that may be used to gather more detailed, site-specific data for use in developing investment and policy proposals. The Index is burdened by at least two significant limitations, namely that the notion of walkability itself is not well understood, paving the way for widespread misunderstanding and that the Index requires that most of the data be collected in the field, which presents difficulties in terms of funding, translation, and quality assurance. by Holly Virginia Krambeck.

40|$|The {{history of}} {{shopping}} {{centers in the}} United States is closely associated with decentralizing urban trends and increased auto dependence, {{both of which have}} severe environmental effects. Retail formats have shifted over the years from downtown shopping to indoor shopping centers, and more recently to big box superstores. As retail formats and markets continue to evolve, many older, less modem stores have suffered. Most recently, this trend has affected big boxes, creating an opportunity to reuse and re-image many of these sites. Vacant shopping centers represent an expanding phenomenon that has been little studied. I survey examples of vacant superstores in the Boston region, and characterize their physical and neighborhood characteristics, as well as procedural barriers and opportunities toward reusing these sites in a way that promotes land-efficient, non-auto-dependent development. I found two primary types of site: urban and suburban. In both types, site plan characteristics are similar. They have low density site plans, and are serviced almost entirely by the automobile. There are few concessions to <b>pedestrian</b> or transit <b>amenity,</b> and in both cases, sites are disconnected from surrounding parcels. Both also face similar procedural redevelopment difficulties, especially regarding ownership and tenant issues, sprawl-oriented zoning regimes, and known but uncertain levels of environmental contamination. However, characteristics of the surrounding areas differ greatly between the two types. "Urban" sites are located in compact, connected, older suburban areas with connected street grids. The shopping center parcels represent a coarse-grain anomaly in a fine-grain area. "Suburban" types are located in urban fringes, in areas that are primarily single-use, auto-oriented, and poorly connected. Planning for both types of site should account for urban design and pedestrian connectivity deficiencies by encouraging connections among different sites and to circulation systems, and to take advantage of other underutilized parcels nearby. To this end, municipalities should plan for an entire area surrounding the shopping center sites, using the tools of design guidelines, site plan review, and flexible zoning regimes. Additionally, municipalities should engage and coordinate private and community sectors to promote cohesion among many sites. Suburban sites should emphasize site planning for connectivity and directing new superstores into existing space. Urban sites should capitalize on existing neighborhood infrastructure to reintegrate the sites into surrounding neighborhoods, and to direct investment and development away from auto-dependent greenfield sites to connected, accessible locations within the metropolitan region. by Adam Varat.
