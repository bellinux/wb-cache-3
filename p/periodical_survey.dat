Many reports consider them as carcinogens and nephropathogens, respectively. Objective-The {{aim of this study}} was to present the natural occurrence of AF and OA in some important foodstuffs in the southern Caspian littoral. Methods-Fourteen barley and nine corn samples, intended for animal feed, were collected from Golestan and Mazandaran provinces, northern Iran, and were analyzed for AF and OA by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Results-In corn samples, aflatoxin B 1 (AFB 1) and aflatoxin B 2 (AFB 2) were detected in 8 (88. 8 %) and 6 (66. 6 %) samples at a mean level of 15. 83 and 2. 99 ppb (median 1. 72 and 1 ppb) respectively. Only one of the AF-contaminated corn samples was co-contaminated with OA at a concentration of 0. 35 ppb. Neither AF nor OA were found in any of the barley samples. Conclusion-This study was the first report on natural occurrence of OA and its co-occurrence with AF in the corn samples of northern Iran.

40|$|AbstractThis {{study was}} planned {{so as to}} perform an {{examination}} of the discipline problems experienced in the secondary education schools in accordance with school types. In this study, in which the special situation method was used, the data were obtained by the public survey method. The survey used in this study was extracted from literature and a study was carried out to adapt it to Turkish. The adapted study was applied to totally 390 students in three secondary education schools in Amasya {{under the supervision of the}} researcher. The data obtained were assessed by putting them into a table. The disciplinary problems existing in schools can be dealt with in two ways. They are the frequency and varieties of disciplinary problems. In these two points of view, the most variation appears to exist in Vocational High Schools among the school types. It can be said that, among the school types studied as to disciplinary problems not very big differences were found, and that vocational high schools (ML) reveal more varieties regarding disciplinary problems. In order to be able to reduce the disciplinary problems in schools to the least, (1) <b>periodical</b> <b>survey</b> should be applied in schools and their results should be noted, (2) in solving the existing problems, rather than compelling disciplinary methods, creative, flexible techniques inclined towards finding solutions in cooperation with families should be preferred, (3) essentially within teaching process, for the productivity of teaching besides classroom management, students should be given chances so that they can be active...|$|E

40|$|Abstract The HIV/AIDS {{pandemic}} {{is primarily}} caused by HIV- 1. Another virus type, HIV- 2, is found mainly in West African countries. We hypothesized that population migration and mobility in Africa may have facilitated the introduction and spreading of HIV- 2 in Mozambique. The presence of HIV- 2 {{has important implications}} for diagnosis and choice of treatment of HIV infection. Hence, the aim {{of this study was to}} estimate the prevalence of HIV- 2 infection and its genotype in Maputo, Mozambique. HIV-infected individuals (N = 1, 200) were consecutively enrolled and screened for IgG antibodies against HIV- 1 gp 41 and HIV- 2 gp 36 using peptide-based enzyme immunoassays (pepEIA). Specimens showing reactivity on the HIV- 2 pepEIA were further tested using the INNO-LIA immunoblot assay and HIV- 2 PCR targeting RT and PR genes. Subtype analysis of HIV- 2 was based on the protease gene. After screening with HIV- 2 pepEIA 1, 168 were non-reactive and 32 were reactive to HIV- 2 gp 36 peptide. Of this total, 30 specimens were simultaneously reactive to gp 41 and gp 36 pepEIA while two samples reacted solely to gp 36 peptide. Only three specimens containing antibodies against gp 36 and gp 105 on the INNO-LIA immunoblot assay were found to be positive by PCR to HIV- 2 subtype A. The proportion of HIV- 2 in Maputo City was 0. 25 % (90 %CI 0. 01 - 0. 49). The HIV epidemic in Southern Mozambique is driven by HIV- 1, with HIV- 2 also circulating at a marginal rate.

The aim is to identify the non genetic effects upon the growth curve of local goat population raised under arid conditions as a necessary step to improve kids` meat production on range lands. The Gompertz model was adopted to assess individual kids` growth curves. A non linear regression iterative procedure allows estimating 688 kids curves parameters and convergence criteria was 10 - 8. For each kid, curve parameters, asymptotic weight, inflexion age and weight, were considered as quantitative traits. A GLM procedure was applied to decompose the total variance of the kid`s traits. A means comparison test (SNK, α = 0. 05) was applied to identify homogenous class by factor. Results show that the GLM determination coefficient remains lower than 67 % of all studied traits due to the observed data structure. All traits seem {{to be affected by}} the significant effects (p< 0. 001 or 0. 05) of the factors related to the restrictions and the irregularity of the technical and natural environment of pastoral husbandry. Specially, growth traits varied with year, herd, month of birth and natural region. Herd mobility contributes to stamp climatic stresses and resources irregularities. Equally, the year factor plays an important role upon the kids weight and it evolution till 6 months age. Kids growth curve loses its S-shape and becomes linear under harsh conditions of dry years. Also, the non-genetic factors impact increases with kids age and requirements. The sex, birth mode and mother age acts only during first 2 months age.

30|$|The {{site safety}} {{monitoring}} involves {{continuously or periodically}} evaluation of deformations of a permanent (e.g., building) or temporary (e.g., scaffolding) structure that usually bears dynamic excitements. The consequences of site safety monitoring failure are usually severe, and can cause damage, injuries, or even casualties. A specific case is monitoring the settling displacements of an existing building adjacent to a jobsite. For construction sites, it is stringently demanded that the settlement of adjacent buildings is monitored {{in the course of}} foundation excavation to ensure the integrity of these buildings and minimize disturbances. Traditionally, the settling markers are installed on the wall of a monitored building, and the contractor employs a registered professional surveying team to carry out periodical (e.g., bi-weekly) measurements of the settling markers with a total station during the entire piling construction period (ASD 2007). In such respect, surveying settlement consists of two phases: transiting the geodetic coordinates from the government benchmark positions to locally defined points around the monitored building, and performing a <b>periodical</b> <b>surveying</b> of the vertical movements of these markers on the building relative to the local points and identifying changes, both of which remand a sheer volume of efforts and costs.|$|R

Preliminary observations on few cultivars, support the evidence that differential cultivar responses to Xf infections may exist. To explore the response of a larger panel of cultivars, in April 2015, an experimental olive plot, located within the Xf-heavily affected olive groves, {{was established in the}} Apulia Region (Italy). Twenty-four trees for each of the ten different cultivars were planted in randomized blocks. Each tree was caged with 15 - 20 specimens of Philaenus spumarius collected from the neighboring infected olive groves. Upon removing the cages, the trees are then continuously exposed to the natural vector populations occurring in the area. Nine and 12 -months after planting, the trees were sampled, tested for Xf and inspected for symptoms. The first data confirmed the infectivity of the vector populations occurring in the Apulian contaminated area and the Xf susceptibility of the olive cultivars tested. Almost 50 % of the trees tested positive, with an infection incidence ranging from 25 % (Leccino) to 78 % (Koroneiki).
