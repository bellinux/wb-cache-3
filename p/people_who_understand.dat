2500|$|The {{company has}} {{received}} attention stemming from CEO Patrick Byrne's battle against alleged {{naked short selling}} of his company's shares. Beginning in 2005, Byrne has contended {{that a number of}} companies, including Overstock.com, have been the targets of this practice, which involves selling a stock short but without the usual step of initially borrowing or locating the shares. Byrne alleges that the practice circumvents safeguards of conventional shorting, and has been used in large schemes devised to profit from driving down the prices of companies' shares, in many cases leading to these companies' failure. With Overstock, Byrne contends that the company's longstanding appearance on the Regulation SHO Threshold Security list, an SEC-mandated list showing companies with a high number of [...] "fails to deliver", along with high trading volumes that sometimes surpass total quantity of the company's stock, establish that it has been targeted by this practice. Byrne's campaign has been controversial, including criticism in the financial press that Byrne is seeking to divert attention from Overstock's share price declines and failure to turn a profit. New York Times columnist Joseph Nocera has said in 2006 that, [...] "Except for a few fellow-traveling Web sites, where Mr. Byrne is viewed as a heroic figure, most <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>understand</b> the issue or have looked into it think it's pretty bogus." [...] Others have suggested that the problem is real, but that the SEC acts to prevent it and that it does not happen on any scale such as Byrne suggests. SEC Chairman Christopher Cox called abusive naked short selling [...] "a fraud that the commission is bound to prevent and to punish." ...|$|E
2500|$|Interpreting [...] {{together}} with [...] Maimonides taught that judges {{must be on}} {{the highest level of}} righteousness. An effort should be made that they be white-haired, of impressive height, of dignified appearance, and <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>understand</b> whispered matters and who understand many different languages so that the court will not need to hear testimony from an interpreter. Maimonides taught that one need not demand that a judge for a court of three possess all these qualities, but a judge must, however, possess seven attributes: wisdom, humility, fear of God, loathing for money, love for truth, being beloved by people at large, and a good reputation. Maimonides cited [...] “Men of wisdom and understanding,” for the requirement of wisdom. [...] continues, “Beloved by your tribes,” which Maimonides read to refer to those who are appreciated by people at large. Maimonides taught that what will make them beloved by people is conducting themselves with a favorable eye and a humble spirit, being good company, and speaking and conducting their business with people gently. Maimonides read [...] “men of power,” to refer to people who are mighty in their observance of the commandments, who are very demanding of themselves, and who overcome their evil inclination until they possess no unfavorable qualities, no trace of an unpleasant reputation, even during their early adulthood, they were spoken of highly. Maimonides read [...] “men of power,” also to imply that they should have a courageous heart to save the oppressed from the oppressor, as [...] reports, “And Moses arose and delivered them.” Maimonides taught that just as Moses was humble, so, too, every judge should be humble. [...] continues “God-fearing,” which is clear. [...] mentions “men who hate profit,” which Maimonides took to refer to people who do not become overly concerned even about their own money; they do not pursue the accumulation of money, for anyone who is overly concerned about wealth will ultimately be overcome by want. [...] continues “men of truth,” which Maimonides took to refer to people who pursue justice because of their own inclination; they love truth, hate crime, and flee from all forms of crookedness.|$|E
