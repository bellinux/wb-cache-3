50|$|Early in the 1950s, {{he founded}} Benson-Lehner Corporation with George F. G. Lehner, a {{psychology}} professor at UCLA. Soon after its founding, futurist Donald Prell {{joined the company}} as Vice President, Application Engineering. The new company was successful, as it filled a niche designing systems {{that were used to}} provide data input and output to and from the early computers. The B/L machines semi-automatically read oscillograph and <b>photographic</b> <b>flight</b> test data producing punched tape and IBM punch cards which were then entered into computers. After being processed, the data was then automatically printed on large flatbed graph-plotters. This process automated the formerly manual reading and subsequent hand-plotting of data. B/L plotters soon became the industry standard, and were sold worldwide. After an IPO the company expanded into the field of high speed photography. Two photo-mechanical engineers, Guy Hearon and Harry Katt, were hired, who designed a series of 16mm, 35mm, and 70mm high speed cameras and accessories.|$|E

40|$|A <b>photographic</b> <b>flight</b> {{was made}} over the James River on May 17, 1977. The data show that, in general, James River water has very high {{sunlight}} reflectance. In the Bailey Bay area this reflectance is drastically reduced. Also shown is a technique for normalizing off-axis variations in radiance film exposure from camera falloff and uneven sunlight conditions to the nadir value. After data normalization, a spectral analysis is performed that identifies Bailey Creek water in James River water. The spectral results when compared with laboratory spectrometer data indicate that reflectance from James River water is dominated by suspended matter, while the substance most likely responsible for reduced reflectance in Bailey Creek water is dissolved organic carbon...|$|E
40|$|Practical {{remote sensing}} {{techniques}} were developed for detecting and evaluating vigor loss in forest conifers due to dwarf mistletoe. Eastern dwarf mistletoe (Arceuthobium pusillum) infection of black spruce (Picea mariana) was investigated. A tower-tramway system, 100 feet high, was erected over an infected stand in northeast Minnesota in June and multiband/multidate photography was initiated in July and is continuing. Four 70 mm film-filter combinations {{were used in}} a multicamera unit: Plus-X/Wratten 58, Plus-X/Wratten 25 A, Aero Infrared/Wratten 89 B, and Ektachrome Infrared/Wratten 12. The stand of mistletoe-infected black spruce under the tramway was photographed three times per day (0900, 1200 and 1500 local sun time) at approximately 10 day intervals. An extensive test site, several square miles in area, was selected in north-central Minnesota {{for the purpose of}} testing photographic specifications developed on the tramway test site. One aerial <b>photographic</b> <b>flight</b> at a variety of altitudes was accomplished over the extensive test site in August. Data analyses are not available at this time...|$|E
40|$|The {{construction}} of Casa de Piedra (Stone House) dam, {{in the final}} stretch of Colorado river high valley, radically modified down waters the hydrologic river course, especially regarding sediment transport, the majority of which settles in the lake. Consequently, waters the dam distributes, contain a remarkable erosive capacity, and accelerate down waters hydrographic processes, increasing river “meandering” and bringing about {{what is known as}} the “clear waters phenomenon” causing adverse effects on watering zones. With the purpose of checking the fact in a quantitative way, cartographies from a certain stretch were taken, being this stretch considered a witness one in periods around 25 years, assessing meanders appearance and disappearance, and comparing these quantities with the variation -in the same sense-, that took place since Casa de Piedra dam start up. The quantities were significant considering the relatively short time gone by. The fact was checked in a new aero - <b>photographic</b> <b>flight,</b> according to which, in a shorter lapse, meanders number increased again in the witness stretch. ...|$|E

40|$|There {{has been}} much {{speculation}} {{about the significance of}} avian formation flight, yet it 2 ̆ 7 s purpose is still unknown. To explain the phenomenon, two hypotheses have been proposed. The first describes linear formations, such as vee formations, {{as a function of the}} visual, social and spacial needs of the particular bird. The second hypothesis proposes that formation flight exists to conserve flight energy for the formation as a whole. The proposed conservation of flight energy is achieved by an overall reduction of in-flight drag, or by taking advantage of lift components of the vortex wake produced by the preceeding bird in the formation. To confirm basic aerodynamic considerations of flapping bird flight, and to clarify the sequential wing actions during such flight, a Budgerigar (Melopsittacus undulatus) was taught to fly in a wind tunnel. Airflow characteristics around the bird were made visible by directing a stream of chemical smoke into the tunnel. The bird was photographed during flight. The <b>photographic</b> <b>flight</b> data were used in conjunction with data on formation flight geometry to construct a hypothetical model of a five bird vee formation. The model was subjected to analysis using standard aerodynamic principles to determine the extent of drag savings available to the birds in the formation. The reduction in aerodynamic drag was much less than previously hypothesized, and the use of a fixed wing analogy for flapping flight was determined as an oversimplication. Previous aerodynamic studies of formation flight are discussed and compared to the results of this study, and investigation methods are proposed for further work which may provide answers to the question of a possible aerodynamic advantage to formation flight...|$|E
