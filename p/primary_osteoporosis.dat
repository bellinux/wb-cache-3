40|$|Abstract: Osteoporosis is {{characterized}} by reduced bone mass and impaired micro-architectural structure, leading to an increased susceptibility to fractures. It is a complex, multifactorial disorder resulting from genetic factors, environmental factors and gene-environment interactions. Currently there are three opinions on the main pathogenesis of <b>primary</b> <b>osteoporosis</b> in traditional Chinese medicine: kidney deficiency, spleen deficiency, and spleen-kidney deficiency, in which disagreement remains. In this paper， the authors combine the modern etiology of osteoporosis to explain scientific connotation of the three opinions, aiming to comprehend the pathogenesis of <b>primary</b> <b>osteoporosis</b> and strengthen the communication between traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine, and trying to evaluate the clinical curative effect on osteoporosis...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the {{discontinuation}} and occurrence of fracture during denosumab treatment in Japanese women with <b>primary</b> <b>osteoporosis</b> or rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with osteoporosis. Methods: This retrospective study included 143 patients with <b>primary</b> <b>osteoporosis</b> and 96 patients with RA and osteoporosis who were treated with denosumab. Treatment discontinuation, fracture occurrence, lumbar spine (L 1 – 4) bone mineral density (LS-BMD), and bilateral total hip BMD (TH-BMD) were examined before and at 1 and 2 years after treatment commencement. Results: In the <b>primary</b> <b>osteoporosis</b> group, 32 cases dropped out and no fractures occurred from 0 to 1 year. Eighteen cases were lost to follow-up and no fractures were noted from 1 to 2 years. In the RA with osteoporosis group, 7 cases dropped out and no fracture occurred from 0 to 1 year. Twenty-one cases were lost to follow-up and 2 nonvertebral fractures were noted from 1 to 2 years. In this group, 13 cases dropped out from 1 to 2 years and 16 cases dropped out during the 2 -year study period due to economic reasons. LS-BMD and TH-BMD values increased continuously for 2 years of treatment in both <b>primary</b> <b>osteoporosis</b> and RA with osteoporosis groups. Conclusions: These results suggest that during denosumab therapy, the discontinuation rate is expected to remain low during 2 years of treatment in primary osteoporotic patients.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to analyze symptomatic refractures after vertebroplasty in patients on oral steroid therapy. We hypothesized that the higher refracture rate of patients on oral glucocorticoid therapy after percutaneous vertebroplasty is due not to an inadequacy of the procedure but rather to a naturally higher predisposition of these patients to refracture compared with patients with <b>primary</b> <b>osteoporosis.</b> METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on all osteoporosis patients having initial verte-broplasty from August 1999 to August 2003. The follow-up period was limited to 1 year after initial vertebroplasty session, with the last follow-up date ending in August 2004. Data were collected on 387 osteoporosis patients. RESULTS: Of the patients with <b>primary</b> <b>osteoporosis,</b> 20. 6 % patients refractured whereas 37. 8 % of the patients with steroid-induced osteoporosis had symptomatic refractures within 1 year of initial vertebroplasty.

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Primary</b> <b>osteoporosis</b> {{is a rare}} childhood-onset {{skeletal}} condition whose pathogenesis {{has been}} largely unknown. We have previously shown that <b>primary</b> <b>osteoporosis</b> {{can be caused by}} heterozygous missense mutations in the Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 (LRP 5) gene, and the role of LRP 5 is further investigated here. Methods LRP 5 was analyzed in 18 otherwise healthy children and adolescents who had evidence of osteoporosis (manifested as reduced bone mineral density i. e. BMD, recurrent peripheral fractures and/or vertebral compression fractures) but who lacked the clinical features of osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) or other known syndromes linked to low BMD. Also 51 controls were analyzed. Methods used in the genetic analyses included direct sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). In vitro studies were performed using luciferase assay and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) to examine the effect of two novel and three previously identified mutations on the activity of canonical Wnt signaling and on expression of tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (Tph 1) and 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -Htr 1 b). Results Two novel LRP 5 mutations (c. 3446 T > A; p. L 1149 Q and c. 3553 G > A; p. G 1185 R) were identified in two patients and their affected family members. In vitro analyses showed that one of these novel mutations together with two previously reported mutations (p. C 913 fs, p. R 1036 Q) significantly reduced the activity of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway. Such reductions may lead to decreased bone formation, and could explain the bone phenotype. Gut-derived Lrp 5 has been shown to regulate serotonin synthesis by controlling the production of serotonin rate-limiting enzyme, Tph 1. LRP 5 mutations did not affect Tph 1 expression, and only one mutant (p. L 1149 Q) reduced expression of serotonin receptor 5 -Htr 1 b (p Conclusions Our results provide additional information on the role of LRP 5 mutations and their effects on the development of juvenile-onset <b>primary</b> <b>osteoporosis,</b> and hence the pathogenesis of the disorder. The mutations causing <b>primary</b> <b>osteoporosis</b> reduce the signaling activity of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway and may therefore result in decreased bone formation.

40|$|Glucocorticoids are {{the most}} common cause of {{secondary}} osteoporosis leading to the so-called glucocorticoidinduced osteoporosis (GIO). A treatment with 10 mg/d of prednisone or equivalent for more than 3 months leads to a 7 -fold increase in hip fractures and a 17 -fold increase in vertebral fractures. The difference between bone quantity and quality in GIO makes bone mineral density measurements inadequate to detect patients at risk of fracture. The adverse effects of glucocorticoids on the skeleton derive from a direct impact on bone cells with a severe impairment of mechanical competence. Crucial to prevention of GIO is early timing of intervention. The World Health Organization has adopted a fracture prevention algorithm (FRAX) intended to estimate fracture risk in GIO. The American College of Rhematology modified its prevention and treatment guidelines taking into account the individual risk of fracture calculated in GIO on the basis of the FRAX algorithm. Recently, also a joint Guideline Working Group of the International Osteoporosis Foundation (IOF) and the European Calcified Tissue Society (ECTS) published a framework for the development of national guidelines for the management of GIO.

Besides, long-term HT was frequently used to manage the higher risks for osteoporosis and heart attack in postmenopause. Estrogens alone or combined with progestin feature most frequently in HT. Objectives: This HTA report addresses the questions on medical efficacy and cost-effectiveness of HT as a treatment of hot flashes and night sweats {{as well as in the}} <b>primary</b> prevention of <b>osteoporosis</b> and cardiovascular disease in postmenopause in general healthy women. Methods: The literature search for articles published after 1998 was conducted in March 2004 in standard medical and economic databases. The analysis included randomised controlled trials, systematic reviews, meta-analysis and economic evaluations considering relevant clinical endpoints in English or German language. The quality of the studies was assessed using checklists corresponding to the study type. Results: HT is highly effective in treating hot flashes in climacteric women. The question of economical efficiency cannot be answered due to the scarce database. As the positive effects (lower risk for fractures and endometrial cancer) do not outweigh the negative effects (higher risk for breast cancer and general cardiovascular risk) estrogen-progestin combination HT cannot be recommended for <b>primary</b> prevention of <b>osteoporosis</b> and cardiovascular disease in postmenopausal women. Discussion: The observation period of most of the studies regarding therapy of hot flashes and night sweats were too short to evaluate possible risks of long-term HT. The economic publications assessing HT for this indication varied vastly in terms of applied methods and were not carried out with respect to the German health care system.
