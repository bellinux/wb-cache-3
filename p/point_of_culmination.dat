Florence School of Regulation proposes a European gas target model with a special focus on market architectures and investment: The MECO-S Model. The MECO-S is a “Market Enabling, Connecting and Securing” Model describing an end-state of the gas market to be achieved over time. The common foundation of the MECO-S Model is the economic investment. Investment aims at supporting the other pillars in realizing their respective goals e. g. in contributing to the creation of functioning markets or in contributing to improved price alignment...|$|E
40|$|The {{forms of}} {{interfaces}} {{that allow us}} to interact with the world are developing in a fast way. New technical devices permit new manipulations. The computer leads to a reduction of the haptic and tactile sense {{and it seems to be}} a short lapse of time until the hand will entirely be replaced entirely by the visual sense. The center of this development is the relation between the visual and the tactile sense, Photography as a reproductive image technology, is a central <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>culmination</b> in the relation of both senses. In this dissertation the point is to analyse the changes in the relation between the tactile and the visual sense, it is in analysing historical positions in philosophy of perception that the concepts are found and then applied to photography. The analysed positions are situated in the Greek thinking, as in Descartes metaphysics, Pascal, Walter Benjamin and Barthes. The result of this dissertation consists in a prehistory of the tactile perception, which could be a starting point for new interrogations. This research which reconsiders the actual relation to the world mediated by pictures with a special attempt towards tactile and visual perception, is only in its beginning. Important changes are involved in this relation, all the more so our environment gets deeply defined by technical devices and representation, but actually based in philosophy...|$|E
40|$|The present {{research}} {{was aimed at}} studying the height growth of Pinus elliottii from Capão Bonito, São Paulo State, due {{to the importance of}} knowing about this development while using a growth function for the prognosis of forest production. The objectives of the study were the following: a) to research different methods of prognosis through a bibliographical review and to select the ones that utilize growth functions which can be adjusted to a straight line, as these do not require special methods for the calculation of their coefficients; b) to obtain the height growth data from stem analysis of 30 year old trees; c) to estimate the values of height till the 30 thyear of age simulating prognosis by adjusting the growth functions in different data periods or the following ages: 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26 and 28; d) to evaluate the results of the prognosis simulation by comparison with real data obtained from stem analysis. Prognosis of thirteen growth functions were tested and compared with the real growth up to the 30 th year, being the age periods: 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26 and 28. The residue analysis test was used through associate probability, and its was confirmed that among the tested models only four had not tended to the probability value of 0, 05 in all the prognosis periods. 6. H = H (I - 1) + e(a + b(I - 1) + c ln(I - 1)) 7. H = H (I - 1) + e (a + b ln(I - 1) + c lnH((I - 1)) 10. H = H (I - 1) + e(a + b(I - 1) + c ln(I - 1)) 11. H = H (I - 1) + e(a + b(I - 1) + c ln(I - 1)) It was seen that the tendency of the curves presented by the functions of best adjustment began to get near the real data when the adjustment was made during the data period which comprises the young and the adult phasis, in other words, from the CAI (current annual increment) <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>culmination.</b> Through graphic analysis it was seen that, concerning prognosis, the tendency of the functions is not significantto the obtained results, since the tendentious functions also offered good prognosis at adjustment periods. Among the tested functions the one introduced by Schumacher (1939) [log II = a + b 1 /I) was the only not to present a good adjustment at any of the studied prognosis phases, having been tendentious at all the adjustment periods except at the 8 th year. The empyrical method of Backman was studied {{with the use of the}} probability graph paper and it has been concluded that this method it the safest for prognosis, since once the CAI <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>culmination</b> is related to the final theoretical heights, thus defining the growth tendency, it doesn't result in errors such as the ones wich occur at the use of growth functions while assuming the data tendency according to the adjusted mathematical functions...|$|E
40|$|Through {{effective}} educational transmission {{cultural traditions}} are {{passed on to}} subsequent generations. The presence of alternative theoretical views of reality (paradigms) in various academic disciplines uprooted the positivistic conviction that genuine science ought to be ‘objective’ and ‘neutral’. The background of this view is found in Renaissance and post-Renaissance philosophy, with its initial <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>culmination</b> in {{the thought of the}} 18 th century philosopher, Immanuel Kant. He safe-guarded autonomous human freedom by restricting scholarship to phenomena (subject to the universal law of causality). The dialectic between nature and freedom gave direction to modern philosophy. Non-reductionist orientations eventually emerged recognising what is irreducible. Although a sound academic culture,operative within supervision to doctoral students, must pay attention to argumentative skills and informal logic, it must at the same time acknowledge the limitations of logic. The principle of sufficient reason refers human thinking beyond logic itself. The supervisor therefore should generate, amongst students, an awareness of the difference between reductionist and non-reductionist ontologies. Doctoral students must also realise that persistent themes and scientific revolutions go hand-in-hand. Some examples of seeing the aspects of reality as modes of explanation are given, before the seven aims of scientific endeavors identified by Stafleu are stipulated. This constitutes another important guideline that ought {{to be taken into account}} in supervising post-graduate work. Argumentative skills, scientific communication and the status of facts are discussed before a concluding formulation is given in which the overall argument of the article is summarised...|$|R

40|$|The {{procedures}} launched against Germany and France due {{to their}} excessive deficits, again brought {{the attention of the}} media and broader public to the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP). The <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>culmination</b> was reached when the European Commission filed a claim against the Council (C- 27 / 04) which in essence concerned the enforceability and, thus, the functioning of the SGP {{in the context of the}} required cooperation between the two Community institutions. The ruling of the European Court of Justice (ECJ), however, was comparably more reluctant. While concentrating on the concrete steps taken by the Council in the deficit procedures against Germany and France, it sidestepped key questions on the nature and the sequence of the procedure and the division of power between Council and Commission in the enforcement of national budgetary discipline. As a result, the extent to which the system of fiscal surveillance and economic policy coordination binds the Member States, as well as the institutions, remains unsettled. The same can be said regarding the interplay between the Council and Commission not only in the case at hand, but also in future excessive deficit procedures. Can the procedure be continued against the will of the Council? Can there ever be sanctions against the will of the Council? Does the SGP therefore effectively force the Member States to abide by the principle of fiscal discipline? It is one thing to confirm the Council as the central actor and decision-maker in the deficit procedure; it is, however, another to remain silent on the limits of the Council's discretion. When the ECJ mentions the possibility of an action for failure to act, it acknowledges the shortcomings of the procedure in those cases where the Council is unwilling to decide. Nevertheless, the ruling opens additional loopholes for inaction by the Council. This might be fatal not only for the current decisive phase of the excessive deficit procedure against Germany and France, but also for the existence of the pact as such. With the case of Italy, where the Council failed to adopt the recommendation of the Commission to initiate the early warning procedure, the next conflict between Commission and Council is pending. With the adoption of its Communication of 3 September 2004, the Commission has meanwhile reignited the discussion on the reform of the SGP at the political level.

40|$|Different {{courses of}} tree growth in height and {{diameter}} in nursery and plantation, immediately after transplanting, cause {{the difficulties in}} adaptation of tree growth models. Tree growth models, which {{do not include the}} sudden transitions and specificities of nursery growth and in the first years after planting can show errors in the assessment of the values of current and average increment at the moment <b>of</b> <b>culmination</b> and at the age of maximum increment. This paper proposes the introduction of additional parameters in the models of diameter and height growth, e. g. the values of mean diameter at breast height and mean height immediately after planting. Compared to the models without additional parameters, the precision of diameter and height model is reflected in the lower standard error of regression (se) and in the more accurate assessment of current and average increment at the moment <b>of</b> <b>culmination</b> and at the age <b>of</b> <b>culmination...</b>|$|R

(1983) Cell Differ. 12, 205 - 210]. The onset <b>of</b> <b>culmination</b> is marked {{by the appearance of}} concentric waves of cell movement on the aggregate surface. Culmination proceeds by the chemotactic attraction of amoebae to the center of wave propagation, which results in the accumulation of amoebae into a finger-like structure. Evidence is presented that the chemoattractant used during culmination is cAMP, which is secreted in pulses. The cells secrete cAMP themselves; cAMP receptors and phosphodiesterase activity appear on the cell surface just before the onset <b>of</b> <b>culmination.</b> Micromolar concentrations <b>of</b> externally applied cAMP induce disorientation of amoeboid movement at the onset <b>of</b> <b>culmination.</b> These observations are compatible with the hypothesis that the cAMP signaling system organizes multicellular development in both primitive and advanced cellular slime mold species.
