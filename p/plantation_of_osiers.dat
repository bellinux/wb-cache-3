6000|$|Scene: Smooth level grass {{near the}} Shannon. Ecclesiastical ruins, [...] {{a part of}} which have been roofed in. Rocky plain in the distance, [...] with a river. FATHER COLMAN sorting some bundles <b>of</b> <b>osiers.</b>|$|R
50|$|A cripple, Cenydd {{was placed}} in a cradle made <b>of</b> <b>osiers</b> and cast into the estuary of the River Loughor (a fate that befell several early British saints) and {{eventually}} landed on Worm's Head. Seagulls and angels with a miraculous breast-shaped bell ensured that he survived and was educated as a Christian.|$|R
60|$|When {{they stood}} in the doorway the merman stopped to look at the princess and made many signs of admiration. His voice was very hoarse and husky, but when he found that he was not {{understood}} he took to signs. He carried a little basket made <b>of</b> <b>osiers</b> and filled with rare shells, which he presented to the princess.|$|R
50|$|The {{island is}} tree-covered {{and has a}} narrow channel behind it crossed by a footbridge. It was {{formerly}} used for the growing <b>of</b> <b>osiers</b> (basket willows, used for basketry, furniture, and cart-making). The house on the island replaces the Swan Hotel which was formerly a well-known stopping point on the river. The island was also known {{in the past as}} Kennington Island or St Michael's Island.|$|R
50|$|The island had {{previous}} names including Walnut Tree Ait {{and was a}} {{site for}} the growing <b>of</b> <b>osiers</b> used for basket making. Its modern name comes from the boat builder Thomas Tagg, who hired out boats on the island from 1841. In 1872 he built the Thames Hotel on the island. It became a venue frequented by London's high society including Edward, Prince of Wales, the future King Edward VII.|$|R
60|$|A knot {{of country}} boys, gabbling {{at one another}} like starlings, shrilled a cheer as we came {{rattling}} over a stone bridge beneath which a stream shallowly washed its bank <b>of</b> <b>osiers.</b> I laughed at them, waved my hand. At this they yelled, danced in the road, threw dust into the air. Not, perhaps, a very friendly return; but how happy I was, all anxiety and responsibility gone now.|$|R
40|$|Four {{patients}} in whom endocarditis had been verified at autopsy had the pathogenic organism isolated from aspirates <b>of</b> <b>Osier's</b> nodes. In three cases the responsible organism was identified in Gram stains made from aspirates. The etiologic agent was Staphy/ococcus aureus in three cases and Candida albicans in one case. Histologic examination <b>of</b> an <b>Osier's</b> node {{from one of}} the patients with S. aureus endocarditis showed a microabscess in the papillary dermis together with microemboli in nearby dermal arterioles. Workers previously have interpreted similar histologic findings as consistent with perivasculitis resulting from an immunologic reaction to the pathogenic organism. The present findings support Osier's original contention that the skin lesions that bear his name are "in all probability caused by minute emboli. "...|$|R
60|$|At length, after {{crossing}} several wet fields, {{they came}} into a rushy meadow {{on the edge of}} the river, which spread out into a wide pool, fringed with alders which had not yet lost their leaves and the barer withes <b>of</b> <b>osiers.</b> There was a swift stream at the head of it, and a long rippling shallow at the tail, and a very mixed company was scattered along the bank and in the water.|$|R
50|$|The {{troubles}} {{of the business}} obligated him to mortgage the Linnaean nurseries, {{and for a time}} control of them passed to Gabriel Winter, his brother-in-law. There was a printed dispute with the new owner to which the family attributed the death of his father. Prince eventually regained control of the nurseries. In 1849 he went to California, was a founder of Sacramento, and in 1851 traveled through Mexico. He introduced the culture <b>of</b> <b>osiers</b> and sorghum in 1854/5, and the Chinese yam in 1854.|$|R

60|$|By {{means of}} thin {{spaces between the}} braids of matting, the place was open to the air, but not to view. There was also a round opening on one side, only large enough, however, to admit the arm; but this {{aperture}} was partially closed from within. In front, a deep-dyed rug <b>of</b> <b>osiers,</b> covering the entrance way, was intricately laced to the standing part of the tent. As I divided this lacing with my cutlass, there arose an outburst of voices from the Islanders. And they covered their faces, as the interior was revealed to my gaze.|$|R
50|$|The flat {{country is}} divided into fields with rather meagre hedgerows and scanty trees. The {{alluvial}} and sandy soil appears fertile, yielding good crops of potatoes and turnips, oats, wheat, and clover, whilst many a marshy corner {{is devoted to the}} cultivation <b>of</b> <b>osiers</b> for the manufacture of potato hampers and 'skips'. In the north of the district there is a considerable patch of mossland and here too there is a good deal of clay in the surface soil. By the river there are moist pastures. The inhabitants are entirely employed in agricultural labour and basketmaking. 1907 description.|$|R

50|$|A 17th-century {{account in}} Latin by Philip O'Sullivan Beare of the Elizabethan wars in Ireland {{includes}} {{a description of}} two currachs built in haste to cross the River Shannon. The larger was constructed as follows: two rows <b>of</b> <b>osiers</b> were thrust in the ground opposite each other, the upper ends being bent in to each other (ad medium invicem reflexa) and tied with cords, whereupon the frame so made was turned upside down. Planks, seats and thwarts were then fitted inside (cui e solida tabula, statumina, transtraque interius adduntur), horse hide was fixed to the exterior and oars with rowlocks were supplied. This vessel is described as being able to carry 30 armed men at a time.|$|R
5000|$|According to Julius Caesar, {{the ancient}} Celts practiced the burning alive of humans {{in a number}} of settings. For example, in Book 6, chapter 16, he writes of the Druidic {{sacrifice}} of criminals within huge wicker frames shaped as men: Others have figures of vast size, the limbs of which formed <b>of</b> <b>osiers</b> they fill with living men, which being set on fire, the men perish enveloped in the flames. They consider that the oblation of such as have been taken in theft, or in robbery, or any other offence, is more acceptable to the immortal gods; but when a supply of that class is wanting, they have recourse to the oblation of even the innocent.|$|R

Sometimes they heard the hounds, sometimes a hoarse shouting that traveled far through the still air, and then sometimes {{there was only the}} tremulous song of running water. At length, after crossing several wet fields, they came to a rushy meadow {{on the edge of the}} river, which spread out into a wide pool, fringed with alders which had not yet lost their leaves and the barer withes <b>of</b> <b>osiers.</b> There was a swift stream at the head of it, and a long rippling shallow at the tail; and scattered along the bank and in the water was a curiously mixed company.|$|R

5000|$|The village lies in {{the parish}} of Berse, whose name has the same origin as the nearby village of Bersham. The name, still {{sometimes}} applied {{to the area of}} Caego, was originally that of a common and later came to apply to the whole township of Berse or Bersham; it may be based on an Old English personal name or on the Middle English word [...] "berse", meaning a hedge <b>of</b> <b>osiers.</b> Nearby farms are still known as Higher Berse and Little Berse. Berse parish, however, was created only in June 1934, when it was formed from parts of the parishes of Rhosddu and Wrexham, while most of the houses making up Caego village were built in the 1930s or later. Many of the pre-World War II houses were built by the brothers, Evan and Robert Thomas Williams.|$|R
