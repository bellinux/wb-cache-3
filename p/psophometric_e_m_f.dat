The novel scheme overcomes {{the limitations of the}} encoder-based system, with a reduced cost.;This research re-utilised a LUED slip power facility, previously funded by SERC in the 80 s.;The SRIM uses a conventional current source inverter (CSI) connected between the supply and the rotor windings. Two techniques of slip power recovery, the Kramer and the Scherbius system, are discussed. The Kramer system recovers slip power to the supply. The Scherbius system is capable of four-quadrant operation, with the main advantage of twice the rated shaft output power when operating at twice the rated speed.;The CSI is investigated and its commutation problems studied. For stable operation the commutation sequence in the CSI is synchronised electrically with the varying rotor <b>e.</b> <b>m.</b> <b>f.</b> 's. When motoring sub-synchronously, or generating super-synchronously, the rotor <b>e.</b> <b>m.</b> <b>f.</b> 's are in the direction to aid the commutation process. However, when motoring super-synchronously or generating sub-synchronously, the rotor <b>e.</b> <b>m.</b> <b>f.</b> 's oppose commutation. These limit the performance of the CSI.;Provided the rotor terminal voltages are isolated from the mains, the rotor speed and phase information can be derived from the measured and filtered rotor terminal voltages. The derived signals can synchronise the CSI to the secondary <b>e.</b> <b>m.</b> <b>f.,</b> thereby eliminating the need of an encoder.

Faraday’s discovery that by moving wires across {{a magnetic field}} so as to cut lines of force, a current would be induced, suggested the construction of magneto electric machines, drawn by mechanical power. If a coil of wire be revolved between the poles of a magnetic current a current will be induced in the conductors. In Fig. 1. A simple coil C of wire is revolved between the poles of a magnet N S each end of this coil is connected to a slip ring A-B. Now suppose the coil to be revolving so that {{the top of the}} coil is coming toward one, then the current induced in the wires at that moment will be in the direction indicated by the arrow heads. It will leave by the ring A. and will return from the circuit through B. Now when the coil is turned 180 ? degrees from the position shown, the <b>E.</b> <b>M.</b> <b>F.</b> will be reversed and now it will leave the right B. and return through A. Hence in each complete revolution of the coil the <b>E.</b> <b>M.</b> <b>F</b> rises to a maximum, then falls to 0 and then rises to a maximum in the opposite direction. Then we have a primitive form of the alternator, generating a simple periodical {{alternating current}}. In alternating current working, the current is rapidly reversed, rising and falling in a set of pulses, the electrical current is being set oscillating, forwards and backwards, through the line and around the circuit with great rapidity under the influence of a rapidly reversing <b>E.</b> <b>M.</b> <b>F.</b> Now, as seen above, the coil by cutting lines of force of the magnetic field sets up a periodic <b>E.</b> <b>M.</b> <b>F.</b> which changes at every half turn giving rise to alternating currents. On each whole revolution there will be an <b>E.</b> <b>M.</b> <b>F.</b> which rises to a maximum and then dies away giving a curve such as is represented in Fig. 2. The heights of the curve above the horizontal line represent the momentary values of the <b>E.</b> <b>M.</b> <b>F.</b> ’s; the depths below {{in the second half of}} the curve represent the inverse <b>E.</b> <b>M.</b> <b>F.</b> ’s that succeed them. The exact slope of this curve depends upon the arrangement of the iron and the winding of the alternator, and also upon the current that is flowing. Some machines are constructed so that their <b>E.</b> <b>M.</b> <b>F.</b> curve is nearly a sine curve, while in other machines the curves vary and sometimes are very irregular. Each complete operation exhibited by the whole wave above and below the line is called a period, and the number of periods in a second is called the frequency or periodicity of the alternator. The number of revolutions per second times the number of pairs of poles gives the frequency...|$|R

40|$|The {{distribution}} of currents induced in the vacuum vessel of spherical tokamaks {{is required for}} accurate equi-librium reconstruction. To {{take into account the}} effect of these eddy currents, the vacuum vessel is usually modeled as a large collection of conducting rings [1, 2, 3]. Then, given the measured electromotive force (<b>e.</b> <b>m.</b> <b>f.)</b> obtained from a toroidal loop placed near each ring, the current flowing in the ring is calculated dividing the <b>e.</b> <b>m.</b> <b>f.</b> by the ring resistance. This model assumes that the current in each ring is uniform, requiring the division of the vacuum vessel wall in a large number of segments, for adequate representation, and the interpolation of the signals obtained from a finite number of measuring loops. In this way, the coupling between diverse regions of the vacuum vessel is not properly taken into account and the method fails at fast time scales. Recently [4], a method has been developed that accurately describes the local and non-local fast effects of different regions of the vessel. The method solves the integro-differential equation that governs the evolution of the surface current density induced in a thin axisymmetric shell.

The cell arrangement can be represented as,Pt, O'_ 2 + SO'_ 2 + SO'_ 3 | Na_ 2 SO_ 4. Nasicon [...] . Na_ 2 SO_ 4 |SO"_ 3 + SO"_ 2 + O"_ 2, Pt The Na 2 SO 4 acts both as an auxiliary electrode, converting chemical potentials of SO x and O 2 to equivalent sodium potentials, and as an electrolyte. The presence of Na 2 SO 4 provides partial protection of Nasicon from chemical reaction with gas mixtures containing SO x. The open circuit <b>e.</b> <b>m.</b> <b>f.</b> of the cell is {{in close agreement with}} values given by the Nernst equation. For certain fixed inlet gas compositions of SO 2 +O 2, the <b>e.</b> <b>m.</b> <b>f.</b> varies non-linearly with temperature. The intrinsic response time of the cell to step changes in gas composition is estimated to vary from sim 2. 0 ksec at 723 K to sim 0. 2 ksec at 1077 K. The cell functions well for large differences in partial pressures of SO 3 (pPrimeSO 3 /pprimeSO 3 ap 104) at the electrodes...|$|R

However, {{there are many}} problems in Bio-fuel cell using organism catalyst because research {{of this type of}} fuel cell is started in only few years. Purpose of this research is to obtain high electric power using new type of electrode in Microbial Fuel Cell (MFC). Firstly, three types of electrodes were prepared. Those are (1) painted CNT (Carbon Nanotube) by Ag paste, (2) only Ag paste (without CNT) and (3) bare carbon thin plate. MFC with CNT painted (2) electrode generated high current density and high power in MFC, but its <b>E.</b> <b>M.</b> <b>F</b> (Electromotive Force) was decreased. When CNT painting was applied only to anode, high current and power densities were attained without reducing <b>E.</b> <b>M.</b> <b>F...</b>|$|R

The software is implemented as a function in MATLAB environment. By means of some examples, covering the most relevant winding types, the capabilities of this software will be shown. Particularly, integer and fractional single and double layer winding can be treated. Some examples are presented and briefly discussed.
