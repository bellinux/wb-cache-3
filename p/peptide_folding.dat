40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a <b>peptide</b> <b>folding</b> {{prediction}} method which discovers contrast patterns to differentiate and predict <b>peptide</b> <b>folding</b> classes. A contrast pattern is de-fined {{as a set}} of sequentially associated amino acids which frequently appear in one type of folding but significantly in-frequent in other folding classes. Our hypothesis is that each type of <b>peptide</b> <b>folding</b> has its unique interaction patterns among peptide residues (amino acids). The role of contrast patterns is to act as signatures or features for prediction of a peptide’s folding type. For this purpose, we propose a two phase <b>peptide</b> <b>folding</b> prediction framework, where the first stage is to discover contrast patterns from different types of contrast datasets, followed by a learning process which uses all discovered patterns as features to build a supervised clas-sifier for folding prediction. Experimental results on two benchmark protein datasets will indicate that the proposed framework can outperform simple secondary structure pre-diction based approaches for <b>peptide</b> <b>folding</b> prediction. 1...|$|E

40|$|Experimental {{characterization}} of molecular details is challenging, and although single molecule experiments have gained prominence, oligomer characterization remains largely unexplored. The ability {{to monitor the}} time evolution of individual molecules while they self assemble is essential in providing mechanistic insights about biological events. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations can fill the gap in knowledge between single molecule experiments and ensemble studies like NMR, and are increasingly used {{to gain a better}} understanding of microscopic properties. Coarse-grained (CG) models aid in both exploring longer length and time scale molecular phenomena, and narrowing down the key interactions responsible for significant system characteristics. Over the past decade, CG techniques have made a significant impact in understanding physicochemical processes. However, the realm of peptide-lipid interfacial interactions, primarily binding, partitioning and folding of amphipathic peptides, remains largely unexplored compared to <b>peptide</b> <b>folding</b> in solution. The main drawback of existing CG models is the inability to capture environmentally sensitive changes in dipolar interactions, which are indigenous to protein folding, and lipid dynamics. We have used the Drude oscillator approach to incorporate structural polarization and dipolar interactions in CG beads to develop a minimalistic peptide model, WEPPROM (Water Explicit Polarizable PROtein Model), and a lipid model WEPMEM (Water Explicit Polarizable MEmbrane Model). The addition of backbone dipolar interactions in a CG model for peptides enabled us to achieve alpha-beta secondary structure content de novo, without any added bias. As a prelude to studying amphipathic peptide-lipid membrane interactions, the balance between hydrophobicity and backbone dipolar interactions in driving ordered peptide aggregation in water and at a hydrophobic-hydrophilic interface, was explored. We found that backbone dipole interactions play a crucial role in driving ordered peptide aggregation, both in water and at hydrophobic-hydrophilic interfaces; while hydrophobicity is more relevant for aggregation in water. A zwitterionic (POPC: 1 -palmitoyl- 2 -oleoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphocholine) and an anionic lipid (POPS: 1 -palmitoyl- 2 -oleoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phospho-L-serine) are used as model lipids for WEPMEM. The addition of head group dipolar interactions in lipids significantly improved structural, dynamic and dielectric properties of the model bilayer. Using WEPMEM and WEPPROM, we studied membrane-induced <b>peptide</b> <b>folding</b> of a cationic antimicrobial peptide with anticancer activity, SVS- 1. We found that membrane-induced <b>peptide</b> <b>folding</b> is driven by both (a) cooperativity in peptide self interaction and (b) cooperativity in membrane-peptide interactions. The dipolar interactions between the peptide and the lipid head-groups contribute to stabilizing folded conformations. The role of monovalent ion size and peptide concentration in driving lipid domain formation in anionic/zwitterionic lipid mixtures was also investigated. Our study suggest monovalent ion size to be a crucial determinant of interaction with lipid head groups, and hence domain formation in lipid mixtures. This study reinforces the role of dipole interactions in protein folding, lipid membrane properties, membrane induced <b>peptide</b> <b>folding</b> and lipid domain formation. Therefore, the models developed in this thesis can be used to explore a multitude of biomolecular processes, both at longer time-scales and larger system sizes...|$|E
40|$|SummaryCertain <b>peptide</b> <b>folds,</b> {{owing to}} a {{combination}} of intrinsic stability and resilience to amino acid substitutions, are particularly effective for the display of diverse functional groups. Such “privileged scaffolds” are valuable as starting points for the engineering of new bioactive molecules. We have identified a precursor peptide expressed in the venom gland of the marine snail Conus victoriae, which appears to belong to a hitherto undescribed class of molluscan neuropeptides. Mass spectrometry matching with the venom confirmed the complete mature peptide sequence as a 31 -residue peptide with a single disulfide bond. Solution structure determination revealed a unique <b>peptide</b> <b>fold</b> that we have designated the single disulfide-directed β hairpin (SDH). The SDH fold is highly resistant to thermal denaturation and forms the core of several other multiple disulfide-containing <b>peptide</b> <b>folds,</b> including the inhibitor cystine knot.

This paper reports the identification of Ps-AFP 1, a novel AMP isolated from the Pisum sativum radicle. Ps-AFP 1 was purified and evaluated against phytopathogenic fungi, showing clear effectiveness. In silico analyses were performed, suggesting an unusual fold and disulfide bond pattern. A novel fold and a novel AMP class were here proposed, the αβ-trumpet <b>fold</b> and αβ-trumpet <b>peptides,</b> respectively. The name αβ-trumpet was created due to the <b>peptide's</b> <b>fold,</b> which resembles the musical instrument. The Ps-AFP 1 mechanism of action was also proposed. Microscopic analyses revealed that Ps-AFP 1 could affect the fungus during the hyphal elongation from spore germination. Furthermore, confocal microscopy performed with Ps-AFP 1 labeled with FITC shows that the peptide was localized at high concentration along the fungal cell surface.

Six of the eight variants were successfully produced by E. coli at production levels comparable with that of the wild-type peptide. Of these six variants, three retain detectable antimicrobial activity, although this activity is reduced relative to wild-type MccJ 25.

40|$|Unnatural {{amino acid}} substitutions {{can provide a}} wealth of {{information}} about protein and <b>peptide</b> <b>folding</b> events. Collagen, the most abundant protein in the animal kingdom, has served as an important model system for unnatural amino acid substitutions due to its broad importance in human disease and its use in constructing synthetic biomaterials. Recently, we incorporated the unnatural amino acid aza-proline into a collagen model peptide (CMP) and demonstrated its utility as a stereodynamic replacement for proline to provide key insights into collagen <b>peptide</b> <b>folding</b> and recognition processes. Replacement of a proline stereocenter with a nitrogen atom in a CMP resulted in stereochemical mimicry and a surprisingly stable triple helix structure. For the first time, this single result demonstrated the effect of stereodynamics in the context of biopolymer self-assembly. ^ In 2015, we reported the first favorable substitution of a central glycine residue in collagen by aza-glycine, demonstrating a simple and effective way of stabilizing the triple helix by addition of extra H-bond donors at the helix interface. An X-ray crystallography study confirmed the presence of an additional H-bond and the triple helical nature of the incubated species. We have examined the positional dependence of aza-glycine as well as the effects of multiple and complete aza-glycine substitutions. Our results show that aza-glycine incorporation is the most effective and synthetically tractable means of stabilizing the collagen triple helix. Preliminary collagenase degradation experiments revealed that an all-azGly collagen model peptide such as Ac-(azGPO) 4 -NH 2 resists collagenase hydrolysis, and {{can be used as a}} potent collagenase inhibitor.
