Each locomotive class was given a number 0–9 that signified its power, 0 for the least powerful and 9 for the most, with a suffix of F or P, indicating freight and passenger roles respectively. Freight power ranged from 0–9, passenger from 0–8. Many locomotives were used for both roles, in which case they were given two class numbers, the P-rating first e.g. 3P4F or 6P5F. A slight change from the LMS system saw those where the freight classification (x) equalled the <b>passenger</b> <b>classification</b> (also x) reclassified as xMT, MT standing for mixed traffic, e.g. for the LMS Black Five locomotives, LMS 5P5F became BR 5MT.

40|$|Purpose: There {{are several}} routes between some OD pairs {{in the urban}} rail transit network. In order {{to carry out the}} fare allocating, {{operators}} use some models to estimate which route the passengers choose, but there are some errors between estimation results and actual choices results. The aim of this study is analyzing the passenger route choice behavior in detail based on <b>passenger</b> <b>classification</b> and improving the models to make the results more in line with the actual situations. Design/methodology/approach: In this paper, the passengers were divided into familiar type and strange type. Firstly passenger integrated travel impedance functions of two types were established respectively, after that a multi-route distribution model was used to get the initial route assignment results, then a ratio correction method was used to correct the results taking into account the transfer times, crowd and demand for seats. Finally, a case study for the Beijing local rail transit network is shown. Findings: The numerical example showed that it is logical to take <b>passenger</b> <b>classification</b> and the model and algorithm is effective, the final route choice results are more comprehensive and realistic. Originality/value: The paper offers an improved model and algorithm based on <b>passenger</b> <b>classification</b> for passenger route choice in the urban rail transit network. </p...|$|E

40|$|Competition in airline {{business}} is severe after an introduction of low cost airlines. In Thailand, three low cost airlines occupied one-third of domestic market {{at the end}} of 2005. Their growth rate, 47 percent, surpassed the industrial growth rate at the expense of full-service airlines. One million passengers of full-service airlines were lost to low cost airlines in 2005. The competition drives airlines to clarify their market segments. Passenger information is crucial for retargeting and repositioning. In this study, questionnaires were collected from 468 Thai passengers at Chiang Mai International Airport during October to November 2005. Clients of full-service airlines and low cost airlines shared equally in the allocation of questionnaires. Neural Networks, an alternative technique for airline <b>passenger</b> <b>classification,</b> was benchmarked to a traditional econometric model, Logit. Information from 368 passengers was included into the learning process of models whereas 100 were used for validation. In prediction, Logit model showed little advantage over Neural Networks.

Existing driver data or data from one vehicle is augmented by viewpoint warping using planar homography, which does not require knowledge of the source camera parameters, and overcomes the need to re-train the model with large amounts of additional data.

5000|$|With the {{acquisition}} of the North Manchuria Railway in 1935, equipment differences became much more marked. This was because the NMR was built to Russian broad gauge, and the equipment conformed to that standard; these were referred to as [...] "broad vehicles" [...] (広軌車輛) by the National Railway. This equipment all had old-style couplers and buffers, independent heaters in each passenger car, and were very different and much less modern than Mantetsu equipment. As a result, this equipment {{could not be used}} together with other equipment. Locomotives were classified with letters of the alphabet instead of numbers (e.g. テホA), and <b>passenger</b> equipment <b>classifications</b> were composed of the standard type designation plus オ ("o"), e.g. ハオ [...] "HaO". Due to the fact that so much of the North Manchuria Railway's equipment was outdated, after the regauging of the NMR lines it was decided not to convert the rolling stock to standard gauge. Exceptions included some of the newest locomotives; 44 locomotives of the DekaA (デカA) class and six of the DabuA (ダブA) class were converted to standard gauge, becoming National Railway classes Dekani (デカニ) and Daburo (ダブロ, later Satai (サタイ)) respectively. A small number of passenger carriages were also converted and remained in use. However, only converted locomotives lasted {{until the end of the}} war; the last of the passenger cars were scrapped by 1943.|$|R

The results were compared and contrasted with the idealized and actualized FMVSS 208 sled deceleration pulses. A total of 346 dynamic tests and 83 sled tests were considered. For the passenger vehicle subset of the FMVSS 208 dynamic test population these parameters were 224. 98 ± 30. 39 m/sec 2, 34. 11 ± 4. 57 sec- 1, 94 ± 13 msec and 0. 619 ± 0. 089 meters respectively. For the multipurpose vehicle subset of the FMVSS 208 dynamic test population theses parameters were 246. 17 ± 43. 61 m/sec 2, 37. 78 ± 6. 38 sec- 1, 86 ± 15 msec and 0. 557 ± 0. 100 meters respectively. The differences in all parameters between the two classifications were significant (p < 0. 00004).

40|$|AbstractThe {{rural road}} {{level of service}} quality has highly related to the {{vehicles}} operating speed. The vehicle operating speed has been generally influenced by geometric design characteristics. Previous studies have constructed various analytical models to measure the effect of miscellaneous geometric design variables on vehicle operating speed. This study investigates {{the main effect of}} road slopes and its interaction with other variables in Two-Lane rural roads. The vehicles operating speed in 42 sections of Two-Lane rural roads in north of Iran, a recreation area, has been recorded by video. The obtained films are analysed by image processing and operating speeds are measured by an appropriate software with acceptable precision. The distribution of vehicle speed along tangent sections was analysed and it was found speed had normal distribution. So it had two parameters: mean and variance. The relation between these two parameters and geometric characteristics of tangent sections was studied. The results show that the interaction between vehicle <b>classification</b> (<b>passenger</b> car or heavy vehicle) with slope has been significant parameter. Moreover, the initial speed of vehicle at start of tangent section is a significant parameter. This result demonstrates the effect of previous geometric section on vehicle speed. The proposed models are validated by the standard error of estimate and observation versus estimation graph. The models will help road designer to estimate the average operating speed of vehicles along tangent sections and useful for policy makers to enact policies to control vehicles operating speed. The estimated speed can be helpful for analysis the safety of road concepts such as design consistency...|$|R
40|$|For the {{protection}} of the unbelted occupants on the front passenger’s seat in frontal crashes the airbag is fired according to FMVSS 208 depending on the occupant’s size or for children at individual stages. For children seated in a rearward facing child seat or OoP (“Out of Position“) situ ations the airb ag should not be fired. A sensor mat on the seat cushion is developed for the classif ication of the occupants on the <b>passenger</b> seat (“Occupant <b>Classification</b> System “ = OCS). The e mployed sensors in the mat are activated based on a resistive measuring principle so that a chara cteristic activation of sensors for particular “classes of occupants “ can be achieved. During the development of such a sensor mat for a particular seat model, a large number of tests with test persons, child seats and special buttock dummies are carried out in order to guarantee a reliable recognition of the seat’s occupancy. The benefit of using numerical simulation is in the early phase of the development process. Simulation results can be used for predicting how the sy stem will behave.
