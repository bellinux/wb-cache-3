Impedance loci occurring {{in the first and}} second quadrants suggesting tunnel diode behavior and negative differential resistance were observed, for the first time, for mercury in 1. 0 M sodium chloride solutions. Admittance measurements indicated an increase in admittance at potentials close to zero followed by a sharp decrease at the beginning of passivation. This maximum becomes sharper at lower frequencies. There is also a slight anodic shift in the maximum with decreasing frequency suggesting the role of solute-water interactions and orientation effects of water near the double layer changeover potential. Mott-Schottky analysis revealed both p-type and n-type semiconduction.

Beside their interesting mechanical properties, they are considered as an environmental friendly alternative to Portland cement [1 - 2]. Most of the considerations on the low CO 2 embodied energy of CSA cements is, however, referred to studies based on theoretical calculation by comparing the burning temperature and the enthalpy associated {{with the formation of}} different mineral phases compared to the well-known values of Portland cement clinker [3 - 4].

The A 1 C 13 -TMPAC melts diluted with 1, 2 -dichlorobenzene of had a beneficial effect on increasing aluminium deposition and stripping currents by decreasing viscosity {{and increasing the}} conductivity of the melt. The reductions of A 12 C 17 ions were quasi-reversible and diffusion controlled, The irreversibility of the reductions {{was due to the}} relatively low conductivity and high viscosity of the melts. The aluminium deposition was associated with the reduction of the resulting product A 1 C 14 ions following the locally changing acidity of the melts, and a corrosion reaction between fresh aluminium deposits and the melt. The mechanism for aluminium electrodeposition from 2 : 1 A 1 C 13 -TMPAC was realised likely similar to that for the acidic A 1 C 13 - BPC melts. The bulk depositions of aluminium on all electrode except platinum involved three-dimensional instantaneous nucleation process followed by hemispherical diffusion-controlled growth of the developing nuclei. On platinum the nucleation process was characteristic of instantaneous at short time and then tended to progressive.

The recycling of the platinum catalyst represents a good way to limit the production cost of PEMFCs. Usual recovery routes for platinum-containing catalysts are pyro-hydrometallurgical processes, combining a calcination step and an aqua regia treatment, generating fumes and NOx emission. An electrochemical recovery route by coupling electrochemical leaching and electrodeposition in ionic liquids (ILs) is proposed here, more environmentally friendly, performed in "soft" temperature conditions and without any gases emission. Imidazolium chloride ILs were selected for their complexing ability against platinum and their good electrochemical stability. They were used either pure or diluted in a low coordinating IL, BMIMTFSI (1 -butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide). The electroleaching of massive platinum was first studied in several chloride-based ILs. BMIMCl (1 -butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium chloride) appeared to be the best of leaching media tested, as <b>passivation</b> <b>phenomena</b> were observed in other ILs. BMIMCl + BMIMTFSI melts were then tested, containing different BMIMCl amounts. A marked increase of the leaching rate with BMIMCl content is observed up to 0. 1 M. For contents higher than 0. 5 M, the leaching rate is comparable with the one obtained in pure BMIMCl. The study of the electrochemical recovery of leached platinum revealed that its electrodeposition is impossible in the electrochemical window of pure BMIMCl, due to its high chloride content. On the contrary, platinum electrodeposition was successful in BMIMCl + BMIMTFSI ILs melts for BMIMCl content up to 0. 1 M.

40|$|A {{critical}} review of previous {{work on the}} Kolbe reaction is given where it is shown that very few applications of modern electrochemical techniques and no applications of recent electrochemical kinetic theory have been made previously to this reaction. No work on the electrochemical kinetics of formate decarboxylation {{has been carried out}} previously. The kinetics of electrochemical decarboxylation formate ions in pure anhydrous formic acid have been studied in detail {{for the first time as}} a model reaction for examination of the decarboxylation and radical coupling reactions that occur with higher aliphatic acids. Current-potential relations (Tafel slopes) have been obtained which show a sharp transition, not diffusion controlled, which is characteristic of <b>passivation</b> <b>phenomena.</b> The behavior is observed at platinum, palladium, gold and palladium-gold alloy electrodes. Tafel slopes are derived for "Langmuir" and "Temkin" conditions of surface coverage. Reversible potentials and exchange currents have been evaluated for the reaction. Galvanostatic charging, cathodic discharge and open circuit decay transients have been obtained for the decarboxylation of formate in formic acid which indicate the formation of films and are interpreted quantitatively in terms of the adsorption of reaction intermediates on the electrode surface. These intermediates are surmised to be HCOO· radicals, and the transition regions in the Tafel plots are identified with the formation of this adsorbed layer. Extended anodic polarisation at platinum and particularly at palladium leads to the formation of films of an anodic product which are considerably thicker than a monolayer, but at gold the film thickness does not exceed that of a monolayer. Following relatively long times (> 100 sec.) of anodic polarisation, film growth obeys the inverse logarithmic rate law deduced by Mott and Cabrera. During the course of the work, an interesting and evidently unique phenomenon of delayed gas evolution was discovered during studies of the formate decarboxylation reaction at palladium electrodes. The electrochemistry of this phenomenon has been studied in some detail and the delayed gas evolution is shown to be associated with attainment of a critical potential in the self-discharge process on open-circuit e. m. f. decay. The thick films formed at palladium are believed to be responsible, upon autocatalytic decomposition, for the delayed gas evolution phenomenon observed at this metal. A new method for deduction of adsorption pseudo-capacitance and charge associated with the adsorbed layer from open-circuit decay transients and Tafel parameters is used to obtain the pseudo-capacitance and charge associated with the transition region in the current-potential relationships for the formate decarboxylation. It is shown that this region corresponds to filling of the surface with adsorbed intermediates formed in the reaction. Possible reaction mechanisms are proposed and are examined in relation to the observed experimental results. The galvanostatic results enable distinctions to be made between some of the possible reaction mechanisms proposed. In the aqueous formate systems, current-potential relationships have been obtained which also exhibit transition regions; multilayer formation is indicated, including deposition of layers of different species corresponding to different potential arrest regions in the galvanostatic discharge transients. Reversible potentials and exchange currents have been evaluated for the reaction. Experimental results in the non-aqueous and aqueous formate systems are compared; It is suggested that the layers formed in the aqueous system may consist of oxide and discharged carboxylate and that the transition behavior and critical currents in the Kolbe reaction correspond to conditions for passivation of the metal by oxide and discharged carboxylate species. Electrochemical kinetic studies on the Kolbe reaction have been carried out with potassium trifluoroacetate in trifluoroacetic acid (100 %). High yields of the Kolbe product C 2 F 6 and CO 2 are obtained and current-potential plots exhibiting transition behavior and linear Tafel regions are found. Tafel slopes are deduced for "Langmuir" and "Temkin" surface coverage conditions by surface intermediates and compared with experimental results. Plausible reaction mechanisms are proposed, which are supported by galvanostatic discharge transients; the latter indicate that the coverage by adsorbed intermediates in the trifluoroacetate reaction approaches a monolayer...|$|R

In this study, a photocatalytic process is used to degrade one herbicide of the imidazolinone family, Imazapyr. It was shown to be photodegraded rapidly and extensively in an aqueous solution. The decline of Imazapyr concentration in the solution followed a first-order kinetics. The apparent first order rate constant was found equal to 0. 19 min- 1 in distilled water at natural pH 3. 8. The smaller activities found at acidic and basic pH were explained by considering the ionisation state of Imazapyr and the charge density of TiO 2. The present work dealt with the influence of metal ions like Ni 2 + and Cu 2 + which are frequently present in agricultural wastewater on the photocatalytic efficiency of TiO 2 in the elimination of Imazapyr. A detrimental effect of the presence of metallic species was observed only with samples containing amount of copper and nickel in the presence of TiO 2.

The use of NZVI coupled with strong reducers for RDC appears thus as good alternative and promising technological to clean up polluted environments by CHC. The optimization of an industrial process, using DT and NZVI, for RDC of aquifers or unsaturated soils contaminated by CHC, appeared as a sustainable alternative for in situ RDC, more especially as development of processes where DT is involved do not exceed the stage of the laboratory. This study is accomplished within the framework of DECHLORED. The objective of the work is to develop and prove the efficiency of a novel in situ RDC process in polluted aquifers by using strong reducers and illuminate, by an improved monitoring, the field under the RDC process. For this purpose, four key steps have been identified: i) define, at laboratory scale, the operating conditions, ii) determine the performances iii) draw up the list of the equipment and the technical conditions of implementation on site and iv) make a complete assessment of the processes application. The purpose of this communication is to present the work accomplished (i) to set up an enhanced procedure for the RDC of CHC at lab scale and (ii) to perform RDC experiments in situ as demonstration at a selected polluted site (Néry-Saintines, 60, Oise, France). For lab experiments (performed by using batch and columns), perchloroethene (PCE) was chosen as the target compound as it {{is one of the}} most widespread chlorinated pollutants in groundwaters and its degradation produces many known molecules. Batch experiments carried out in hermetically closed cells allowed the setting up of protocols making it possible to study the feasibility of RDC for PCE. Tests were carried out using DT and NZIV particles while varying operating parameters: nature and contents of reagents, temperature (from 12 °C to 25 °C), concentrations in pollutants, reagent/pollutant molar ratios, treatment duration, physical and chemical parameters. Columns experiments were then conducted in designed Kynar® columns (Figure 1, height 50 cm; diameter 15 cm) that were fully equipped with sophisticated systems for non-destructive monitoring of time changing physical parameters and chemical compositions (Figure 2). The entire system (filled with reference sand from Fontainebleau and with Cuisian sand from the selected polluted site) was placed in air-conditioned cupboard under different operating conditions. The monitoring was complemented by probes (T, pH, redox, conductivity, oxygen, sulfide and chloride ions). Gas Chromatography (GC) led to monitor PCE (and its degradation products) migration and dispersion over the entire columns. Ion Chromatography (IC) was used for the quantitation of Cl- at the column outputs to correlate RDC. Results showed the effective reduction of PCE by NZVI, firstly by direct electron transfer and secondly from native H 2. The association NZVI+DT was demonstrated to be more powerful; probably due to a concerted mechanism. IC analyses confirmed the superiority of the combination DT+NZVI than DT alone. GC analyses suggested that the combination DT+NZVI led to minimize the formation of chlorinated intermediate species; which represents a significant advantage for in situ groundwater treatments. Experiments carried out in columns allowed us to: •evaluate the applicability of the selected operating conditions close to those being able to be met on the aquifers or soils•improve understanding of reactant efficacy, and also their transformation and persistence, •model these flow-through systems (1 D or 2 D column set up) by numerical modeling softwares (PHREEQC® and MARTHE® reactive transport simulations). Our results also recommended combining of geophysical measurements with electroanalytical measurements to monitor RDC process and will allow us to give an advantageous method for monitoring and checking in situ remediation. Concerning the implementation in situ, the site was carefully selected because it presented a well-documented pollution (with a majority of CHC and their metabolites) provided by analyses since 1980. The processing of all historical data allowed highlighting the existence of a slow natural reductive bio-dechlorination process. It also allowed selecting the right emplacement for the implementation of the RDC process (40. 5 m width, 25 m length x 25 m depth). Before any implementation of the process, geological and hydrogeological investigations allowed dimensioning the demonstration pilot. In order to define the initial conditions and later to appreciate the effectiveness of treatment, a network of 12 piezometers (PZ) were installed. They were disposed along a transect intercepting perpendicularly the polluted water flow. Three of them, made in carbon steel, were injection wells, judiciously equipped for simultaneous injection over four different levels, from 0 to - 25 m. The other nine PZ have been realized as control PZ. For this purpose they have been fully equipped with probes for physical and chemical monitoring. It is worth noting that all the 12 PZ were firstly dedicated to monitor the groundwater quality. Data acquired before the treatment allowed us to obtain a 3 D-representation of the geochemical parameters of the whole contaminated zone. The total CHC content at this location was about 30 mg/L. The whole RDC process in situ is under operation (injection at four levels of reagent solutions according to ratios defined during the preliminary experiments and monitoring) since October 2014. During and after the treatment application, the 9 PZ were used for regular and judicious sampling at different depth. This lead to (i) comfort the physical and chemical data acquired by the probes, (ii) provide T, pH, redox, alkalinity, chloride, sulfate, Fe(II) and total Fe contents and (iii) monitor CHC and their metabolites (mechanisms of RDC) and estimate the RDC process efficiency. At that time (May 2015), tested RDC processes are efficient at minus 85 %. At the end on the treatment (July 2015), the performances of the process will be thoroughly investigated. The processes will be economically assessed and compared to other treatments in terms of efficiency, limits, and costs...|$|R
40|$|Nanostructured {{materials}} play a {{vital role}} in almost all aspects of science and technology in the 21 st century. The materials include nanoparticles, nanofilms, biological membranes etc. whose physicochemical properties are size-dependent. Thin films have wide range of applications in various branches of science. One of the efficient methods to form miniaturized structures for device applications is to fabricate nanostructured films on different substrates. Surfactant assembly on metallic and non-metallic surfaces based on self assembly and Langmuir-Blodgett technique offers a unique way to form thin films at molecular levels. The process of formation of unimolecular assemblies gives the flexibility of tuning the properties of underlying substrates for various applications including wetting characteristics, lubrication, <b>passivation,</b> mimicking biological <b>phenomena</b> etc. Towards this direction, self assembled monolayers (SAMs) of alkanethiols on gold and silver surfaces have been studied comprehensively for the past two decades. The reported literature on short chain length thiol-based monolayers is however, limited since the formation using conventional methods yield poor quality monolayers. The short chain length monolayers are useful in various applications like tribology, layer-by-layer assemblies, biosensors etc. Hence, it is essential to reproducibly form SAMs of various chain lengths and understand their properties. 	 The present study is related to the formation of SAMs of alkanethiols and diselenides on gold and silver surfaces to form ordered and well-oriented monolayers. Monolayers of varying chain lengths (CH 3 (CH 2) nSH where n = 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 15) have been formed on gold and silver surfaces using different methods, (1) adsorption from neat thiols; (2) adsorption under electrochemical control and (3) adsorption from alcoholic solutions of the thiols. The characteristics features of the SAMs have been followed based on three different aspects, (i) structure and stability of the methylene groups (ii) interfacial characteristics involving the end group and the solvent and (iii) metal-head group interactions. The structure and stability of the monolayers have been followed based on vibrational spectroscopy and electrochemistry under different environment including thermal perturbations. The stability of the SAMs at different temperatures and subsequent changes associated with the orientation / packing has been monitored both in the dry state using reflection absorption infrared spectroscopy (RAIRS) and under electrochemical conditions using cyclic voltammetry and impedance analysis. Monolayers adsorbed from neat thiols show superior quality in terms of stability and structural arrangement. Short chain thiols with n = 3, 5, 7 show substantial stability when the adsorption is carried out from neat thiols. Figure 1 shows the RAIR spectra of hexanethiol SAM on gold adsorbed by three different procedures. Monolayers adsorbed under potential control behave very similar to the monolayers adsorbed from neat thiol as for as stability and structural orientation are concerned. Monolayers prepared using conventional methods of adsorption from alcoholic solutions are of inferior quality in terms of stability and arrangement especially for the short chain lengths. This is likely to be due to the fact that monolayers prepared using conventional methods may have intercalated solvent molecules within the monolayer assembly that degrade the integrity of the SAM leading to poor quality. The blocking characteristics of the monolayers for diffusing redox couple have been followed by determining the heterogeneous electron transfer rate constant using electrochemical techniques. The spectroscopic data and the electrochemical data follow similar trend indicating the superior quality of monolayer adsorbed from neat thiol in terms of stability as compared to conventionally prepared monolayers. Figure 1. RAIR spectra of hexanethiol-SAMs on Au(111) surface at 25 C. The monolayers are formed by adsorption (A) from neat thiol (B) under potential control and (C) from alcoholic solution of the thiol. Wavenumber (cm- 1) The interfacial characteristics of the monolayers (effect of end group functionality on the solvent properties) have been monitored on the basis of capacitance, contact angle and atomic force microscopy- measurements. Well-organized monolayers behave like good capacitors with relatively low values of double layer capacitance in presence of a liquid electrolyte as compared to the expected values based on known thickness and dielectric constant of the SAMs. This behavior can be explained by invoking the depletion of water density at the methyl terminated SAM-water interface where the solvent properties are different from that of bulk. Variation of one such property, dielectric constant, has been mapped using force measurement based on AFM. Dielectric constant of water changes from the bulk value of 78 to a low value as given in figure 2. This cross-over occurs within a span of 1 - 3 nm depending on the chain length of the thiol. Of the three procedures used, the ones based on the use of neat thiol and electrochemical adsorption result in well-oriented alkyl chains followed by highly oriented methyl terminal groups. This is responsible for the high hydrophobic nature of the interface and the subsequent observation of interfacial water properties. The SAMs prepared from ethanol fail to show the hydrophobic effects. Hydrophilic monolayers (NH 2 terminated monolayers) fail to show depletion of water density at the interface indicating the importance of end group functionality in altering the interfacial characteristics of the monolayer. 					 Figure 2. Spatial variation of dielectric permittivity of water at the hexanethiol SAM - water interface. The SAM is formed on gold (111) surface; (a) from ethanolic solution of the thiol (b) under electrochemical control (c) from neat thiol. The origin on the x-axis is the position of the methyl groups of SAM and the direction towards right side is in to the bulk water. The well-oriented SAMs have been used to follow the adsorption of a biopolymer. Zein protein is a prolamine of maize and is projected to be a biocompatible coating for food products and food containers. Hence, it is essential to prepare impermeable coatings of zein with different surface wetting properties. The adsorption of zein on highly ordered SAMs with hydrophobic or hydrophilic end group functionality has been studied and the orientation of the protein followed using spectroscopy, microscopy and electrochemistry. It is observed that zein shows higher affinity towards hydrophilic than hydrophobic surfaces with small foot print size on the Figure 3. Orientation of zein protein on hydrophilic and hydrophobic SAM as deciphered from the experimental data. hydrophilic surface resulting in large surface coverage. Figure 3 shows the schematics of zein deposits on hydrophilic and hydrophobic SAM surfaces determined based on spectroscopy, quartz crystal microbalance and electrochemical studies. The AFM shows cylindrical, rod-like and disc-like features of zein on hydrophilic surfaces that form the base units for the growth of cylindrical structures of zein. The published literature on the studies on SAMs on silver surfaces reveals that there is no consensus on the structure of the monolayers on silver. This may be due to the difficulty in getting pristine oxide-free surfaces in the case of silver and this is likely to affect the monolayer quality. Hence, it is decided to prepare SAMs of alkanethiols on silver and study their characteristics. Subtle differences between the monolayers adsorbed from neat thiol and from alcoholic solutions of thiols have been observed in terms of stability and permeability. Atomic force microscopic studies illustrate the presence of depletion of water at the SAM-aqueous interface. Diselenide-based monolayers have been formed on gold to understand the head group-substrate interactions on the monolayer properties. The disorder observed on short chain diselenide-based monolayers formed from alcoholic solutions can be eliminated by adsorption from neat compounds as described for the thiols. A preliminary account on the stability of SAMs under hydrodynamic conditions has been given based on rotating disc electrode voltammetry. It is observed that the SAMs get well-ordered when the electrode is rotated at a fast rate leading to the hypothesis that the monolayer assembly gets annealed as a function of the rotation rate. The thesis is planned as follows: Chapter 1 gives general introduction about organic thin films with particular emphasis on self-assembled monolayers on gold and silver, their characteristics in terms of stability, interfacial properties and adsorption behaviour. Chapter 2 deals with the experimental methodologies and schematics used for the preparation and characterization of the monolayers. Chapter 3 is on the contribution of alkyl spacer to the stability of the monolayers studied using spectroscopy and electrochemistry. Chapter 4 deals with the interfacial properties of the SAMs in presence of aqueous medium. In order to emphasize the importance of the terminal functional groups, adsorption of zein has been demonstrated on surfaces of controlled wettablity. Chapter 5 explains the formation and stability of monolayers of short and long chain alkyl diselenides on gold surfaces. Chapter 6 gives the structural and interfacial characteristics of alkanethiol monolayers on silver surfaces. The stability and subsequent changes of alkanethiol monolayers under hydrodynamic conditions has been discussed in the appendix section. (For fig pl refer pdf file. ...|$|R
