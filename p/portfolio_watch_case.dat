5000|$|The Star <b>Watch</b> <b>Case</b> Company Elgin, Illinois {{started in}} 1897 making <b>watch</b> <b>cases</b> for the Elgin Watch Company. The founders were Otto A. Starke, Fred Hermann and Alfred W. Church. The company {{incorporated}} on February 7, 1905. The first {{officers of the}} new Star <b>Watch</b> <b>Case</b> Company were Otto A. Starke as its president; Fred Hermann, vice president; Warren Antoine Cartier, secretary; and Alfred W. Church as the treasurer. [...] The Illinois Watchcase Company changed its name sometime between 1903 and 1905 to the Star <b>Watch</b> <b>Case</b> Company, which is {{sometimes referred to as}} the Star Watchcase Company.|$|R
50|$|The Star <b>Watch</b> <b>Case</b> Company {{manufactured}} <b>watch</b> <b>cases.</b> <b>Watch</b> movements (the mechanical mechanism), the dial, hands, {{glass that}} covers {{the face of the}} watch (sometimes called the crystal), and some of the crowns (the button used to wind the watch) were made in another location and shipped to Star to assemble the final watch product. Some of the companies it made <b>watch</b> <b>cases</b> for were Manistee Watch Company, Hamilton, Longines, Elgin, Gruen, Omega and Pulsar.|$|R

50|$|The raw {{materials}} Star <b>Watch</b> <b>Case</b> Company used for <b>watch</b> <b>cases</b> were gold, silver, nickel, brass, zinc and chrome-plated cases; solid gold or gold filled {{being the most}} preferred. Their gold supply in bars was held in a local Ludington bank, then as need some bars were transferred to the factory for melting down. The factory always held around $200,000 worth of gold {{at any one time}} for <b>watch</b> <b>cases</b> of 10, 14, or 18 karats.|$|R

50|$|The {{tool and}} die {{engineer}} would place the <b>watch</b> <b>cases</b> in a fixture that would {{hold them in}} place. A Master Plate design was then selected for the design desired. The pantograph machine would then reduce the design and accurately reproduce it {{on the backs of}} the <b>watch</b> <b>cases.</b> The operator would use a lever that followed the Master Plate design and the diamond tipped cutting tools would cut the design into the blank <b>watch</b> <b>cases.</b> The pantograph machine invented by Andrew Hallberg around 1910 led to hand engraving of pocket watches becoming obsolete after 1930.|$|R

5000|$|The Clamshell's 15-year history {{began in}} 1936 when Gallet {{purchased}} {{the rights to}} a patent for the [...] "waterproof" [...] <b>watch</b> <b>case</b> design (Brevet N° 189190), invented by the Swiss firm of Schmitz Frères & Cie in the neighboring city of Grenchen. By inserting gasket sealed pushbuttons {{into the side of}} this unique <b>watch</b> <b>case</b> design, Gallet was able to expand the water resistant characteristics of the Schmitz Frères concept to the more complex wrist-worn chronograph. Originally engineered by Gallet for the adverse conditions of the battlefield, the Clamshell chronograph derived its nickname from the way that the upper and lower sections of the <b>watch</b> <b>case</b> compressed together over a specially flared crystal, protecting the delicate inner mechanisms from the intrusion of water, dirt, dust, and caustic chemicals.|$|R
