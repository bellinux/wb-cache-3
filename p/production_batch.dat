5|$|The T48 {{originated}} from an Anglo-American requirement for a self-propelled 6-pounder anti-tank gun. The requirement {{was met by}} emplacing a 57mm gun M1 – the U.S. production version of the British Ordnance QF 6-pounder – {{in the rear of}} an M3 Half-track. The first <b>production</b> <b>batch</b> was ordered in April 1942. The Americans dropped their requirements because of the design of another tank destroyer, the M10. Afterwards, it was intended solely to be supplied overseas {{under the terms of the}} Lend-Lease Program; the T48 was never officially type-classified.|$|E
5|$|The first <b>production</b> <b>batch</b> {{of uranium}} slugs were {{dissolved}} at the separation plant on 26 December 1944, and in January 1945 Matthias personally couriered {{the first batch}} of plutonium nitrate to Los Angeles, where he handed it over to another courier, who {{took it to the}} Los Alamos Laboratory. Plutonium from Hanford would be used in the Fat Man bomb used in the bombing of Nagasaki. For his wartime services, he was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal.|$|E

5|$|A single {{prototype}} of the two-seat trainer was the first aircraft of the first <b>production</b> <b>batch</b> built by Factory No. 31 {{in the fall of}} 1946. The prototype did not begin manufacturer's flight testing until 5 April 1947, even though the primary differences from the single-seat version were limited to a redesigned forward fuselage that accommodated an additional cockpit for the trainee where the armament used to be and a sideways-opening, canopy. The trainer was initially designated as the Yak-Jumo vyvoznoy, but it was eventually designated as the Yak-21 although some documents refer to it as the Yak-15V, Yak-15UT or Yak-21V. Further work on the trainer was cancelled with the success of the trainer version of the Yak-17 with its tricycle undercarriage.|$|E
5|$|Construction of {{the delayed}} 1926 order for 20 K class {{locomotives}} began in 1928 after alteration to the U class specification. As {{a result of}} Harold Holcroft’s position as one of Maunsell’s assistants, the new-builds also displayed the Churchward GWR 4300 Class influence. The ideas applied to this class were already used on the N, N1 and K class rebuilds, including long-travel valves for fast running, Belpaire firebox and conical boilers, constructed at the North British Locomotive Works in Glasgow. The first of the <b>production</b> <b>batch</b> emerged from Brighton works in August 1928 and featured a tapered chimney and smokebox snifting valves, {{both of which were}} used on the K and N class locomotives.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, Sukhoi {{developed}} {{an updated version}} of the Su-33; flight trials began in October 2010. This modernised Su-33 was to compete with a potential Chinese indigenous version of the original Su-33, and to encourage orders from the Russian Navy. Major upgrades to the aircraft included more powerful (132kN, 29,800lbf) AL-31-F-M1 engines and a larger weapons carriage; upgrades to the radar and weapons were not possible at the time due to funding constraints. According to military author Richard Fisher, it has been speculated that further modifications to a new <b>production</b> <b>batch</b> would include a phased-array radar, thrust-vectoring nozzles, and long-range anti-ship missiles.|$|E

50|$|The {{earliest}} <b>production</b> <b>batches</b> suffered poor handling, {{and after}} some improvements {{the handling of}} this model became better and Modenas Karisma dominates the Malaysian scooter market since 2004.|$|R
5|$|The 20 {{locomotives}} of {{the first}} <b>production</b> <b>batch</b> were split equally between Brighton and Ashford works, and all were completed by December 1929. The production locomotives had a slightly different profile to the K class rebuilds and featured left-hand drive to improve the visibility of signals from the driver's side of the footplate. They also had higher running plates {{along the sides of}} the boiler than the rebuilds, which required smaller wheel splashers to cover the tops of the driving wheels. Another variation was the flatter top to the dome covers, as the rebuilds retained the high N class type used on the K class.|$|E
5|$|In {{common with}} the N, N1 and K class locomotives, the Midland Railway {{influence}} of Clayton showed in the placement of locomotive fittings on the <b>production</b> <b>batch,</b> as the water top-feed into the boiler was located inside a dome, whilst the cab area was {{a modified version of}} those on the 0-6-0s of Henry Fowler and the K class rebuilds. The rebuilds had Midland Railway-style double spectacle plates (the small windows on the front face of the cab) left over from the K class cabs, whereas the production versions had one each side of the boiler. Such modifications were becoming typical of the Southern Railway’s attempt to produce a fleet of standardised locomotives. However, all members of the U class were to vary from GWR practice, as the superheating surface area was increased, and all were equipped with outside Walschaerts valve gear.|$|E
5|$|Zavod Nr. 39built 16Pe-3s in August, {{including}} the prototype, 98in September and 82in October before the factory was evacuated to Irkutsk late in October. Production was restarted in April 1942 {{with a total}} of 132 built during the year. All were Pe-3bis models except for eleven Pe-3s that had not been completed before the evacuation. Thirteen were built in 1943before production was canceled in favor of Ilyushin Il-4 bombers. A final <b>production</b> <b>batch</b> of 19was built at Zavod Nr. 22in early 1944, but these were more lightly armed than earlier versions, with only a single ShVAK cannon in the wing center section and one UBK in the nose. The bomb racks in the engine nacelles were eliminated entirely, as was the fixed ShKAS machine gun in the tail. Two DAG-10 grenade launchers were fitted in the rear fuselage, each with ten grenades.|$|E
50|$|The first Fairmile B {{motor launch}} was {{completed}} in September 1940, with a further 38 from the first two <b>production</b> <b>batches</b> entering service {{before the end of}} the year.|$|R
5000|$|The state railway {{procured}} 139 examples between 1895 and 1912; it was {{the most}} numerous Bavarian branch line locomotive. Both Krauss and Maffei supplied three prototypes each and both were later involved in the <b>production</b> <b>batches.</b>|$|R
50|$|Production of the {{original}} Westfield XI ceased in 1986, although the company offered kits until about 1988. In 2004 Westfield restarted production, still using the A-series engine. Westfield continues to offer the XI kit in small <b>production</b> <b>batches.</b>|$|R
5|$|After the Falklands War, the UK {{government}} began upgrading the defences of the Falkland Islands {{to guard against}} any further aggression from Argentina. One of the measures taken was the deployment of an interceptor squadron to the islands, with 23 Squadron forming at RAF Stanley in October 1983. At the time, the air defence variant of the Panavia Tornado was still in development, meaning that the Phantom was the UK's primary air defence aircraft (supported by two remaining squadrons of Lightnings). The removal of a squadron of Phantoms to the Falkland Islands left {{a gap in the}} UK's air defences and nothing immediately available to fill it, given that the Tornado was still some years from service. As a result, the UK government decided to purchase another squadron of Phantoms. Because the aircraft in RAF service were a special <b>production</b> <b>batch</b> built to UK specifications, it would not be possible to obtain identical aircraft, so 15 second-hand airframes were procured from among the best of the ex-US Navy F-4Js stored at the Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Center at Davis–Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona and the Naval Air Rework Facility at NAS North Island. The F-4J was chosen because it was the variant from which the RAF's F-4Ks and F-4Ms were developed, and was thus the closest available to the British aircraft. The 15 that were selected were extensively refurbished and brought to a standard almost equivalent to the F-4S, which was the last variant in service with the US Navy, the only differences being the absence of leading-edge slats and a helmet gun sight.|$|E

50|$|Vetrazzo {{recycled}} glass countertops were invented in Berkeley in 1996. A materials scientist, Don McPherson, pursuing his PhD combined {{recycled glass}} and a cement binder {{to create a}} sustainable, polished countertop.

However, it did soldier on in the Army Reserves and National Guard for some time; Frankfort Arsenal only stopped production in 1961 and Lake City Army Ammunition Plant was making [...]30-06 until the late 1970s, with new <b>production</b> <b>batches</b> in 1993 and 2002.|$|R
