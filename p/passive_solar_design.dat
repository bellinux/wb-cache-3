5|$|The common {{features}} of passive solar architecture are orientation {{relative to the}} Sun, compact proportion (a low surface area to volume ratio), selective shading (overhangs) and thermal mass. When these features are tailored to the local climate and environment they can produce well-lit spaces that stay in a comfortable temperature range. Socrates' Megaron House {{is a classic example}} of <b>passive</b> <b>solar</b> <b>design.</b> The most recent approaches to solar design use computer modeling tying together solar lighting, heating and ventilation systems in an integrated solar design package. Active solar equipment such as pumps, fans and switchable windows can complement passive design and improve system performance.|$|E
25|$|The key to {{designing}} a passive solar building is to best {{take advantage of}} the local climate. Elements to be considered include window placement and glazing type, thermal insulation, thermal mass, and shading. <b>Passive</b> <b>solar</b> <b>design</b> techniques can be applied most easily to new buildings, but existing buildings can be retrofitted.|$|E
25|$|In {{passive solar}} {{building}} design, windows, walls, and floors {{are made to}} collect, store, and distribute solar {{energy in the form}} of heat in the winter and reject solar heat in the summer. This is called <b>passive</b> <b>solar</b> <b>design</b> or climatic design because, unlike active solar heating systems, it doesn't involve the use of mechanical and electrical devices.|$|E

Although a ZEB uses multiple <b>passive</b> <b>solar</b> building <b>design</b> concepts, a ZEB is usually not purely passive, having active mechanical renewable energy generation systems such as: wind turbine, photovoltaics, micro hydro, geothermal, and other emerging alternative energy sources.|$|R

Three major climatic zones are identified.

The green building strategies used by Thomas Doerr of Doerr Architecture and Ecofutures Building on the Moore House earned it a verified home energy rating system (HERS) score of −3.|$|E

A good example of an attempt to use <b>passive</b> <b>solar</b> <b>design</b> {{can be seen in the}} Seeley G. Mudd Chemistry Building by Perry Dean Rogers. More recently, New Haven architect César Pelli was asked to design the Lehman Loeb Art Center, which was completed in the early 1990s.

40|$|The green {{building}} concept {{has been successfully}} adopted by many countries in their construction to save energy, protect environment, and recycle the materials. Green building design minimizes the negative human impacts on the natural resources. <b>Passive</b> <b>solar</b> building <b>design</b> {{is one of the}} subcategories of the {{green building}} concept. Execution of the concept of <b>passive</b> <b>solar</b> building <b>design</b> in the tropical countries has a greater potential to reduce national as well as world's fossil fuel consumption. The research shows, apparel industry {{is one of the major}} sectors which uses more energy for the production, thermal and visual comfort of employees during the operation as well as for the maintenance purposes. Hence, the energy cost has become a significant issue in many countries including Sri Lanka. The main aim of this research is to identify and analyze the concept of <b>passive</b> <b>solar</b> building <b>design</b> as an energy conservation method for apparel buildings in Sri Lanka. A literature synthesis is carried out on energy conservation methods, design techniques and systems of <b>passive</b> <b>solar</b> building <b>design</b> under the green building concept. Suitability and application of <b>passive</b> <b>solar</b> techniques within Sri Lankan context is identified through the questionnaire survey among the industry experts. The survey found that current usage of <b>passive</b> <b>solar</b> systems in apparel sector is very low. Passive cooling and day lighting systems were identified as suitable techniques to Sri Lanka as a tropical country. Moreover, research findings provide valuable information about buildings based on environmental design tactics, which promote sustainable construction...|$|R
40|$|<b>Passive</b> <b>solar</b> {{building}} <b>design</b> is {{the process}} of designing a building while considering sunlight exposure for receiving heat in winter and rejecting heat in summer. The main goal of a <b>passive</b> <b>solar</b> building <b>design</b> is to remove or reduce the need of mechanical and electrical systems for cooling and heating, and therefore saving energy costs and reducing environmental impact. This research will use evolutionary computation to <b>design</b> <b>passive</b> <b>solar</b> buildings. Evolutionary <b>design</b> is used in many research projects to build 3 D models for structures automatically. In this research, we use a mixture of split grammar and string-rewriting for generating new 3 D structures. To evaluate energy costs, the EnergyPlus system is used. This is a comprehensive building energy simulation system, which will be used alongside the genetic programming system. In addition, genetic programming will also consider other design and geometry characteristics of the building as search objectives, for example, window placement, building shape, size, and complexity. In <b>passive</b> <b>solar</b> <b>designs,</b> reducing energy that is needed for cooling and heating are two objectives of interest. Experiments show that smaller buildings with no windows and skylights are the most energy efficient models. Window heat gain is another objective used to encourage models to have windows. In addition, window and volume based objectives are tried. To examine the impact of environment on designs, experiments are run on five different geographic locations. Also, both single floor models and multi-floor models are examined in this research. According to the experiments, solutions from the experiments were consistent with respect to materials, sizes, and appearance, and satisfied problem constraints in all instances...|$|R

2500|$|Since the 1980s, <b>passive</b> <b>solar</b> {{building}} <b>design</b> and <b>passive</b> {{house have}} demonstrated heating energy consumption reductions of 70% to 90% in many locations, without active energy harvesting. For new builds, and with expert design, {{this can be}} accomplished with little additional construction cost for materials over a conventional building. Very few industry experts have the skills or experience to fully capture benefits of the <b>passive</b> <b>design.</b> Such <b>passive</b> <b>solar</b> <b>designs</b> are much more cost-effective than adding expensive photovoltaic panels on the roof of a conventional inefficient building. A few kilowatt-hours of photovoltaic panels (costing 2 to 3 dollars per annual kWh production, U.S. dollar equivalent) may only reduce external energy requirements by 15% to 30%. A [...] high seasonal energy efficiency ratio 14 conventional air conditioner requires over 7kW of photovoltaic electricity while it is operating, and that does not include enough for off-the-grid night-time operation. Passive cooling, and superior system engineering techniques, can reduce the air conditioning requirement by 70% to 90%. Photovoltaic-generated electricity becomes more cost-effective when the overall demand for electricity is lower.|$|R
