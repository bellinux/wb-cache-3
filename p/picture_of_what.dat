5|$|In 1924, Sadler began hosting Sunday tea gatherings at his home, {{which could}} {{accommodate}} fifty guests. Many attendees {{worked in the}} medical establishment, and typically adhered to a progressive ideology. The group often held a forum to discuss the patient with the sleep issue and devise questions for him. The observers withheld the man's name from the group, but relayed some of his statements. In 1925, the forum, which then had thirty members, closed their meetings to visitors and began to require a pledge of secrecy. Sadler instructed forum members not to publicize what they learned, telling them that they had an incomplete <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> was occurring. He also feared that the patient would face criticism if his identity were known. His identity has never been confirmed; Joscelyn Godwin, of Colgate University, and skeptic Martin Gardner posit that the sleeping man was Wilfred Kellogg, the husband of Lena's sister Anna.|$|E

He was soon replaced by Sir Andrew Clarke and Clarke {{was ordered to}} get a complete <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> {{was happening in the}} Malay states and recommend how to streamline British administration in Malaya. The reason was that London was increasingly aware that the Straits Settlements were increasingly dependent on the economy of the Malay states, including Perak. After Clarke's arrival in Singapore, many British traders including Read became close to the governor. Through Read, Clarke learned of Raja Abdullah's problem and willingness to accept a British representative in his court if the British assisted the once apparent heir.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{the night}} {{different}} opposing ships {{came into contact}} in an arc as the German fleet proceeded from west to east across {{the tail of the}} British fleet. The two fleets were on similar courses so the encounter was drawn out over several hours, but at no time did the British get a clear <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> was happening. The action was characterised by determination and nerve on the German side to keep a steady course despite continual encounters with British destroyers, but by confusion and failure to report events by the British. Individual British ships showed considerable courage and determination in carrying out attacks, but their efforts were spoilt by confusion, which meant many ships turned away from possible targets, uncertain that they were enemy vessels.|$|E
25|$|After Kilroy was {{confirmed}} dead, the media framed the drug group and their religious practices as satanist. For the most part, the U.S. media labeled {{the group as}} satanist and gave little mention to the drug-related violence that was widespread in northern Mexico, thus failing to provide a wider <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> happened at Matamoros. Reports concluded that because human body parts were found inside a large metal pot, the group practiced cannibalism. Some journalists made the error of attributing cannibalism with the common mistake of satanist groups sacrificing and eating human remains. Other writers, however, stated that Constanzo believed in Kadiempembe, the devil's version in Palo Mayombe. In addition, some occult writers believed {{that the nature of}} Kilroy's murder, which included mutilation and clandestine burial, were part of occult tradition.|$|E

The added ceilings impose then a limit on the attainable performance that is below the actual Roofline, and indicate that the kernel or application cannot break through anyone of these celining without first performing the associated optimization.|$|E

500|$|A {{review in}} Religious Studies {{describes}} {{the book as}} [...] "a convenient and in many respects convincing account {{of the history of}} Scientology." [...] However, it comments that Wallis [...] "does not really succeed in the formidable task of giving the reader a rounded <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> {{it is like to be}} a believing member of the Org. His analysis, like its subject matter, is rather mechanical and follows a particular pattern." [...] The review observes that Wallis did not explore the parallels between Dianetics and B. F. Skinner's psychological theories, nor between the screening processes used in Scientology and in Communist China. It recommends that the book would have been more interesting if it had compared its subject with initiation rites, including those of Freemasonry. It dismisses as [...] "facile" [...] the book's background material on secularization and religious schisms.|$|E
500|$|One of Walter's {{subjects}} {{is young}} Olivia Dunham (Karley Scott Collins), aka [...] "Subject 13".

One night, as Olivia {{is about to be}} struck by her stepfather, she temporarily finds herself in a different place; the next day, she draws in her sketchbook a <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> she saw in the other place: a zeppelin (which are a common mode of transportation in the alternate universe). Walter realizes that Olivia crossed over to the parallel universe, and can be the means for returning Peter. Walter puts Olivia under several tests to try to coax her to cross over, eventually eliminating all emotions but fear as the triggering mechanism. He arranges a traumatic test for Olivia, but instead of crossing over, she exhibits pyrokinesis and sets the room afire. In the confusion of extinguishing the blaze, she disappears.|$|E
500|$|The album's songs placed {{emphasis}} on vocals and melody over the heavy guitar riffs {{that were found}} on the band's earlier LPs.

Cornell summed up the changes with [...] "What we've lost in sonic precision we've gained so much in terms of feeling." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic said that Soundgarden [...] "retained their ambitious song structures, neo-psychedelic guitar textures, and winding melodies but haven't dressed them up with detailed production." [...] The songs vary in tempo throughout the course of the album, with Thayil describing the album as having a [...] "dual nature". He stated, [...] "It keeps listeners on their toes and lets them know they're not getting the same album over and over."

500|$|Due to {{the complex}} {{technology}} used to for the video, Robyn believed [...] "It looked like 'MacGyver' on the set."

[...] And [...] is made to give you a <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> sex really is, which I think is something that's very hard to do, because sex is everywhere all the time, but very rarely is it made out to be something real." [...] The video begins with a reversed scene of a young couple having sex. In cutscenes, Robyn appears with a tube dress with clear liquid flowing through it. When the young woman begins to switch her sex partners, the liquid in the tubes wrapped around Robyn begins to alter colors and flow more quickly. The video ends with Robyn standing alone with black liquid in the tubes.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues" [...] {{continues}} {{the theme of}} road weariness from the album's previous song, [...] "Highway 61 Revisited." [...] The singer finds himself in Juarez, Mexico, at Easter time, amidst sickness, despair, whores and saints. While there, he encounters corrupt authorities and women of dubious character, named in the song as [...] "Saint Annie" [...] and [...] "sweet Melinda", before seeking succor in drugs and alcohol. The song establishes a nightmare vision as the singer is influenced by gravity, negativity, sex, drugs, drink, illness, remorse and memory. In the song's final verse, the singer decides he has had enough and finds the means to leave it all behind and head back to New York City, where things may be better. Author Paul Williams has noted that scene and situation are combined into a gorgeous evocation of muddied consciousness in [...] "Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues", without ever resolving into a clear <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> the song is about. Despite the sordid details of the singer's experiences in Juarez, the lyrics maintain a sense of humor, and William Ruhlmann of the AllMusic website considers the song a comic tour de force.|$|E

However, Adams enjoyed the episode's subplots and wrote that the episode really [...] "gave me a better <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> makes Andy's girlfriend tick." [...] Furthermore, he praised many of her lines and her acting ability. Damon Houx of ScreenCrush said that the episode was a [...] "surprisingly strong Erin episode" [...] and that [...] "Dwight acting crazy was also well used". Dan Forcella of TV Fanatic awarded the episode three-and-a-half stars out of five and called it [...] "a nice enough holiday episode". He was critical of the episode's Jim and Pam subplot, saying that it could have [...] "been left on the cutting room floor."

500|$|Climbing fibers fire at low rates, but {{a single}} {{climbing}} fiber action potential induces a burst of several action potentials in a target Purkinje cell (a complex spike). The contrast between parallel fiber and climbing fiber inputs to Purkinje cells (over 100,000 of one type versus exactly {{one of the other}} type) is perhaps the most provocative feature of cerebellar anatomy, and has motivated much of the theorizing. In fact, the function of climbing fibers is the most controversial topic concerning the cerebellum. There are two schools of thought, one following Marr and Albus in holding that climbing fiber input serves primarily as a teaching signal, the other holding that its function is to shape cerebellar output directly. Both views have been defended in great length in numerous publications. In the words of one review, [...] "In trying to synthesize the various hypotheses on the function of the climbing fibers, one has the sense of looking at a drawing by Escher. Each point of view seems to account for a certain collection of findings, but when one attempts to put the different views together, a coherent <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> the climbing fibers are doing does not appear. For the majority of researchers, the climbing fibers signal errors in motor performance, either in the usual manner of discharge frequency modulation or as a single announcement of an 'unexpected event'. For other investigators, the message lies in the degree of ensemble synchrony and rhythmicity among a population of climbing fibers." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{historian}} Richard Southern argues that, {{notwithstanding the}} stated {{aim of the}} work, it was not produced {{to be used in}} lawsuits, but rather as a kind of utopian <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> was in the past. The goal was to depict those things that were beyond human recovery but that were [...] "laid up in heaven". Because of its narrative structure, it should be seen not only as a documentation of the various landholdings of the diocese, but as a historical work as well. Unlike the Liber, it was not revised as the property changed hands, and this lack of revision has been seen as emphasizing the commemorative nature of the work. The historian John Reuben Davies sees a close parallel between Hemming's work and the Welsh medieval document The Book of Llandaf. Other similar works were the Norman pancartes, which were compilations of gifts to a monastery, connected by a narrative which was then presented to the dukes to secure confirmation of the gifts. These Norman works date from the early 11th century, and like Hemming's work, they are of great interest to the historian as sources for the study of medieval history. Also noting that Hemming's part of the compilation {{does not appear to have}} been revised or updated to meet new circumstances, Patrick Geary describes it as [...] "a commemorative, historical volume, not a working administrative tool" [...] and associates the work with counterparts produced in the continental West, such as Folcuin's chronicle cartulary Gesta abbatum S. Bertini Sithiensium.|$|E
500|$|Thrive was {{recorded}} at Zoo Studio in Franklin, Tennessee, with producer Mark A. Miller. According to lead vocalist Mark Hall, {{the idea behind}} Thrive came from the student ministry he is involved in. As a youth pastor, Hall frequently uses Psalms 1, which metaphorically compares {{the concept of a}} righteous man to a prosperous tree planted by a river. Hall said that many people he has talked with are simply surviving, which he feels contrasts with this — he felt that, although hard times can come upon anyone, people are not put in these situations to simply survive through them, but rather to thrive through the adversity. Using the metaphor, Hall noted that, if one were to pull away all the dirt from around a tree, one would find roots digging into the ground in addition to the limbs of the tree reaching out. Hall elaborated that [...] "you need to get your strength from God; you don’t get it on your own. If you’re all limbs, the thorns of life will knock you over. You need to dig your roots in and let God reach out through you". Accordingly, half of the record focuses on 'reaching out', while the other half focuses on 'digging deep'. Hall described the record as being [...] "an effort to draw a <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> a believer, a follower of Jesus, would look like if they dug into their roots and understood God and themselves more, and then instead of trying to go be Christian for God, they just let God give them chances to be a Christian".|$|E
