40|$|A spectroscopic {{ellipsometry}} (SE) {{model was}} developed and implemented to study substrate loss in shallow implanted silicon (i-Si) substrates following a <b>photoresist</b> <b>strip.</b> The model is based on different optical properties of silicon dioxide (SiO 2) and i-Si layers and silicon substrates and is used to characterize relevant layers, i-Si and SiO 2, before and after plasma treatment. An increase in SiO 2 {{and a decrease in}} the i-Si layer were observed after plasma exposure. Changes in the i-Si layer are the result of two phenomena, oxidation and heating-induced regrowth of the i-Si layer, while changes in the SiO 2 thickness represent the direct measure of substrate loss due to oxidation. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and secondary-ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) analysis were performed to cross-check the validity and accuracy of the SE model. The TEM results confirm that the SE model can distinguish between a crystalline (c-Si) substrate and an i-Si layer regardless if the i-Si is damaged, crystalline, or amorphized.

40|$|In {{solid-state}} device processing, cleaning of the substrates has always attracted {{a lot of}} interest, so also the cleaning of Si {{and the removal of}} SiO 2 by HF solutions. HF is a fast etcher of SiO 2, but unfortunately also a slow etcher of Si. Since with evolving technology, the transistor gate length becomes narrower and the dopant implantation in the source/drain area shallower, the substrate and dopant loss during cleaning of heavily doped substrates has become even more critical. When 1 nm of Si is etched away, this could lead to up to 25 % of implanted dopant loss. During manufacturing, Si and dopant loss could occur during different processsteps like cleaning, plasma etch, <b>photoresist</b> <b>strip,</b> [...] . For the different processteps a maximum of Si loss is defined by a roadmap. The International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS) predicts the technological challenges and demands {{for the development of the}} ICÂ’s during the coming years. For future technologies, the Si and oxide loss must be limited to 0. 6 &# 730;A per clean, but more relevant is the total Si loss which must be limited to 2 nm. Also in the photovoltaic industry, the cleaning and etching of Si gains interest. Therefore, a better understanding of the Si etching mechanism in HF is required. This should allow us to put forward some recommendations for developing a HF based clean with minimal Si and dopant loss. First a metrology and methodology is developed to determine Si and dopant loss in the sub-&# 730;A regime in order to study the removal of monolayers of highly doped Si in HF solutions. The total Si and dopant loss after etching was determined by analysis of the dissolved concentrations in the HF liquid by Inductively Coupled Plasma - Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS). By combining ellipsometry with ICP-MS, it was proven that no systematic errors occur during ICP-MS measurements. This implies that correct and reproducible values for dissolved Si can be obtained. By correlating ICP-MS with modeled ion implantation profiles, it was verified that dopant (As, B) loss can be measured accurately by ICP-MS down to the sub-&# 730;A values. Since results obtained by ICP-MS and electrochemistry matched, both techniques are reliable for further use. Next the influence of different parameters like illumination, air saturated vs. deoxygenated, [...] . on the etching of bulk Si was examined. Afterwards, the influence of these parameters on the etching of heavily activated doped Si is investigated, with first the highly As doped, followed by the B doped. These substrates are characterized before and after etching with different analytical techniques like XPS, contact angle, Â…. The etching of bulk Si is dopant independent, with the etch rates of bulk p - and n-type in the same order of magnitude. In addition, it was shown that the etching is (almost) independent of the dissolved O 2 and therefore the H+ /H 2 redox couple is the oxidator of the Si. When lowering the pH of the HF solutions, a lower etch rate was observed due to a lower activity of the HF etchingspecies, while etching is facilitated by a nucleophilic attack of the F&# 8722; (or HF&# 8722;). Finally, another important parameter is the illumination. Due to the introduction of additional carriers by light in the substrate, a higher etch rate is obtained. The etching in light is dominated by an electroless mechanism, while in dark, chemical etching is more important. The photoetch rate decreases slightly as the B concentration is increased up to about 10 19 - 10 20 As/cm 3. We were not able to fully comprise this suprising result. In comparison with the bulk doped Si, the etching is also independent of the dopant element and the dissolved O 2 concentration. The band diagrams show a downward bending, so that holes are directed towards the surface. In addition, the redox couple has a full overlap with the CB. This all results in a etching process which is dominated by electrochemical etching both under light and darkness. Finally the etching of non-activated substrates immediately after ion implantation is studied. Just as for the activated implanted substrates, the etching was faster for the As implanted substrates than the bulk Si, while the opposite is noted for the B doped substrates. In light etching was quick due to the additional carriers, while in dark etching occurs slowly. For the As doped substrates, it was ruled out by XPS, micro-raman and contact angle measurements, that etching is fast due to stress or fast re-oxidation of the substrate. The high shallow implanted dose, amorphizes the Si when the amorphization threshold was exceeded, resulting in broken Si-Si backbonds. This weakened Si-Si structure was easier for HF to attack and resulted in fast etching. This statement was further proven by etching amorphous doped Si substrates, with in addition an even higher etch rate for the highly P doped amorphous Si. For the heavily B doped substrates, the etch rate lowers with increasing B doses. But it rises as soon as the amorphization treshold was exceeded. With XPS and contact angles, it was shown that the B doped substrates are difficult to get H passivated. However, once H-passivated, these substrates do not re-oxidize due to lack of electrons. Based on our work, some recommendations can be made to reduce the substrate and dopant loss during cleaning. For etching in practice both conditions occur, i. e. most of the HF cleans are on non-activated Si, but also a HF based clean occurs after activation. A first remark for both conditions is that the 1. 2. nm of native oxide is removed during an HF clean and hence, 10 - 25 % of the implanted dose may already be removed, except for heavily B doped substrates. Moreover, to limit substrate and dopant loss all cleans should be performed under dark conditions.

40|$|Each new {{generation}} of integrated circuits and other nano-structured devices is produced at ever decreasing length scales. The extension of conventional liquid-phase processes for the manufacturing of these devices is uncertain. This work investigates the ability of liquids to wet nanoscale features. A model for wetting time is derived {{that may be used}} to identify those geometries for which wetting is critical. Conditions under which wetting time is significant may result in low yield and poor uniformity, and may require alternate-phase processing. Furthermore, the dependence of wetting time on the properties of the fluid are quantified so that fluids may be designed to have optimal properties and thus optimal performance for wetting. The resulting model {{can be used as a}} tool to predict future processing requirements, and when necessary, to design novel processes implementing alternative phase fluids such as gas-expanded liquids (GXLs). This study also quantitatively predicts specific effects associated with modified transport properties for dissolution and transport in nanoscale features. The use of GXLs is a particularly promising alternative to conventional liquid-phase processes. GXLs have superior mass transport properties relative to liquids, but can maintain the solvent strength necessary for IC process steps such as post-etch residue removal and <b>photoresist</b> <b>stripping.</b> In addition, the environmental benefits associated with CO 2 -based processes can be substantial. Conceptual demonstration of the use of carbon dioxide (CO 2) -expanded liquids for photoresist and residue removal has been performed. GXLs containing up to 75 % CO 2 are equally as effective as the pure solvents for removal of PHOST-based films. These experiments indicate that GXLs have potential applications in <b>photoresist</b> <b>stripping</b> and post-etch residue removal, in which cost savings due to reduced solvent use can be substantial. The removal of films with GXLs has been evaluated primarily with x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Additionally, an in situ optical technique has been developed for film and GXL diagnostics.

The design consists of a square mirror supported by two torsional beams. Several design variations were considered to see how these variations affected the fabrication. Due to time limitations, the construction was not completed. It was achieved through the <b>photoresist</b> <b>stripping</b> of the bottom pattern step. Although, the construction was not completed, microfabrication techniques were learned such as mask drawings design...|$|R

An understanding of the fun-damental mechanism responsible for carbon dio&ide-based processing, & in surface cleaning, is lacking. Although carbon dioxide is an excellent solvent for removing non-polar contaminants {{from a variety of}} surfaces, other C 02 -based cleaning and surface modification processes are based on mechanical or morphological-induced changes in the interfacial region. The extremely low surface tension of COz is a favorable property in terms of its rapid and complete removal from the substrate a k r a treatment has been affected, and this characteristic of C 02 also accounts for its negligible effect on the morphology of the substrate, as utilized in the microelectronic industry.

50|$|A common {{method of}} {{fabricating}} multi-threshold CMOS involves simply adding additional photolithography and ion implantation steps. For a given fabrication process, the Vth is adjusted by altering {{the concentration of}} dopant atoms in the channel region beneath the gate oxide. Typically, the concentration is adjusted by ion implantation method. For example, photolithography methods are applied to cover all devices except the p-MOSFETs with photoresist. Ion implantation is then completed, with ions of the chosen dopant type penetrating the gate oxide in areas where no photoresist is present. The <b>photoresist</b> is then <b>stripped.</b> Photolithography methods are again applied to cover all devices except the n-MOSFETs. Another implantation is then completed using a different dopant type, with ions penetrating the gate oxide. The <b>photoresist</b> is <b>stripped.</b> At {{some point during the}} subsequent fabrication process, implanted ions are activated by annealing at an elevated temperature.|$|R
40|$|Nanoporous low-k dielectrics {{are used}} for {{integrated}} circuit interconnects to reduce the propagation delays, and cross talk noise between metal wires as an alternative material for SiO 2. These materials, typically organosilicate glass (OSG) films, are exposed to oxygen plasmas during <b>photoresist</b> <b>stripping</b> and related processes which substantially damage the film by abstracting carbon, incorporating O and OH, eventually leading to significantly increased k values. Systematic studies have been performed to understand the oxygen plasma-induced damage mechanisms on different low-k OSG films of various porosity and pore interconnectedness. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy are used to understand the damage kinetics of O radicals, ultraviolet photons and charged species, and possible ways to control the carbon loss from the film. FTIR results demonstrate that O radical present in the plasma is primarily responsible for carbon abstraction and this is governed by diffusion mechanism involving interconnected film nanopores. The loss of carbon from the film can be controlled by closing the pore interconnections, He plasma pretreatment is {{an effective way to}} control the damage at longer exposure by closing the connections between the pores...|$|R
40|$|The {{production}} of integrated circuits involves {{a number of}} discrete steps that utilize hazardous or regulated solvents. Environmental, safety and health considerations associated with these chemicals have prompted a search for alternative, more environmentally benign, solvent systems. An emerging technology for conventional solvent replacement {{is the use of}} supercritical fluids based on carbon dioxide (CO{sub 2 }). Supercritical CO{sub 2 } (SCCO{sub 2 }) is an excellent choice for IC manufacturing processes since it is non-toxic, non-flammable, inexpensive, and is compatible with all substrate and metallizations systems. Also, conditions of temperature and pressure needed to achieve the supercritical state are easily achievable with existing process equipment. The authors first describe the general properties of supercritical fluids, with particular emphasis on their application as alternative solvents. Next, they review some of the work which has been published involving the use of supercritical fluids, and particularly CO{sub 2 }, as they may be applied to the various steps of IC manufacture, including wafer cleaning, thin film deposition, etching, <b>photoresist</b> <b>stripping,</b> and waste treatment. Next, they describe the research work conducted at Los Alamos, on behalf of Hewlett-Packard, on the use of SCCO{sub 2 } in a specific step of the IC manufacturing process: the <b>stripping</b> of hard-baked <b>photoresist...</b>|$|R

A single carbon nanowire was coated with a 5 -nm-thick palladium layer using an e-beam evaporation process subsequent to a photolithography process in which only a suspended region of the carbon structure was exposed in the metallization process. After metal deposition, the <b>photoresist</b> layer was <b>stripped</b> off using a wet process.

40|$|SCORR, {{short for}} {{supercritical}} carbon dioxide resist removal, is a new technology that could continue to enable the technological development of photolithography processes in industry. SCORR {{is based upon the}} physical properties of supercritical fluids (SCFs). These special properties enable SCFs to remove coatings, residues, and particles froin high-aspect-ratio structures in integrated circuits (ICs). SCORR also eliminates rinsing and drying steps presently used in IC manufacture, thereby eliminating the generation of millions of gallons of water per fab per day. Fabricating integrated circuits relies heavily on photolithography to define the shape and pattern of individual components. Once a single stage of a silicon wafer's topography has been completed, the hardened resist must be removed. Conventional processes generates more waste than any single step in the IC manufacturing process, and the production of a complete IC can involve many photolithography iterations. The cost associated with the treatment and disposal of this waste, as well as employee health and safety considerations, are driving a search for a 1 ternative, environmentally benign, cost-effective solutions. In addition, <b>photoresist</b> <b>stripping</b> is confronting finer architectures and higher aspect ratios, as well as new low-k materials that are highly sensitive to post-etch residue. Low-k dielectrics and low-resistivity conductors such as copper are necessary for meeting industry's need for faster and smaller chips. Further, each low-k choice requires different plasma-etching processes, or chemistries, to etch structures into the low-k material; therefore, the nature of the residues can be different. No one product can meet all copper/low-k applications, and existing chemistries are not tunable - or even desirable - for the new processes. We have developed a new process - known as SCORR - that removes photoresist and post-ash, -etch, and -CMP (particulate) residue from semiconductor wafers. As IC feature sizes become smaller, the need for ensuring particle removal will increase. With feature sizes of less than 0. 18 {micro}m, it will become imperative that all particles greater than about 0. 1 micron be removed from the semiconductor wafer. Existing cleaning technologies (such as liquid or high-pressure jet scrubbing) cannot remove particles on the order of 0. 1 micron because of surface boundary layer constraints. Because of the low viscosities of supercritical fluids (SCFs), these constraints are virtually eliminated...|$|R
