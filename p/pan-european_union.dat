50|$|Hitler {{repeatedly}} stressed another longterm fear, apparently {{driving his}} desire for German economic domination of European resources, which was {{the rise of the}} United States of America as a great power. Underlining his lack of faith in the ability to increase agricultural or industrial productivity, he cites America's vast size as the reason that economic policy will fail, and expansionism can be the only route for Germany. He rejects popular conceptions of a <b>Pan-European</b> economic <b>union</b> designed to counter American economic power by saying that life is not measured by quantity of material goods but by the quality of a nation's race and organization. Instead of the Pan-Europe, Hitler desires a free association of superior nations bound by their shared interest in challenging America's domination of the world. In his mind, US economic power is more threatening than British domination of the world. Only after defeating France and Russia could Germany establish its Eurasian empire that would lead nations against the USA, whose power he saw as undermined by its acceptance of Jews and Blacks.|$|R
50|$|De Villegas {{was also}} a member of the <b>Pan-European</b> <b>Union,</b> an anti-communist group {{headquartered}} in Brussels. Through contacts in this group, in 1969 they met Jean Violet, a lawyer who worked for the Service de Documentation Extérieure et de Contre-Espionnage (SDECE), the French intelligence agency. Violet, who was an influential behind-the-scenes player in the pro-Europe anti-communist world, had formed the Pinay Circle in the 1950s around its titular leader, Antoine Pinay.|$|E
50|$|According to a masonic report, Coudenhove-Kalergi {{died of a}} stroke. His secretary, however, {{indicated}} that Coudenhove-Kalergi possibly committed suicide. In the memoir his secretary wrote, she said his death was kept secret {{so as not to}} disappoint those who considered him to be the great visionary of European integration. Coudenhove-Kalergi {{was the head of the}} <b>Pan-European</b> <b>Union</b> until his death. The presidency was succeeded by Otto von Habsburg.|$|E
50|$|Quisling also fronted {{the idea}} of a <b>pan-European</b> <b>union</b> led, but not dominated, by Germany, with a common {{currency}} and a common market. Quisling presented his plans to Hitler repeatedly in memos and talks with the German dictator, the first time 13 February 1942 in the Reich Chancellery in Berlin and the last time on 28 January 1945, again in the Reich Chancellery. All of Quisling's ideas were rejected by Hitler, who did not want any permanent agreements before the war had been concluded, while also desiring Norway's outright annexation into Germany as the northern-most province of a Greater Germanic Reich. Hitler did, however, in a April 1943 meeting promise Quisling that once the war was over Norway would regain her independence. This is the only known case of Hitler making such a promise to an occupied country.|$|E

5000|$|According to his autobiography, at the {{beginning}} of 1924 his friend Baron Louis de Rothschild introduced him to Max Warburg who offered to finance his movement for the next 3 years by giving him 60,000 gold marks. Warburg remained sincerely interested in the movement for the remainder of his life and served as an intermediate for Coudenhove-Kalergi with influential Americans such as banker Paul Warburg and financier Bernard Baruch. In April 1924, Coudenhove-Kalergi founded the journal Paneuropa (1924-1938) of which he was editor and principal author. The next year he started publishing his main work, the Kampf um Paneuropa [...] (The fight for Paneuropa, 1925-1928, three volumes). In 1926, the first Congress of the <b>Pan-European</b> <b>Union</b> was held in Vienna and the 2,000 delegates elected Coudenhove-Kalergi as president of the Central Council, a position he held until his death in 1972.|$|E
5000|$|Coudenhove-Kalergi {{attempted}} to enlist prominent European politicians in his pan-European cause. He offered {{the presidency of}} the Austrian branch of the <b>Pan-European</b> <b>Union</b> to Ignaz Seipel, who accepted the offer unhesitatingly and rewarded his beneficiary with an office in the old Imperial palace in Vienna. Coudenhove-Kalergi had less success with Tomáš Masaryk, who referred him to his uncooperative Prime Minister Edvard Beneš. However, the idea of pan-Europe elicited support from politicians as diverse as the Italian anti-Fascist politician Carlo Sforza and the German President of the Reichsbank under Hitler Hjalmar Schacht. Although Coudenhove-Kalergi found himself unable to sway Benito Mussolini, his ideas influenced Aristide Briand through his inspired speech in favour of a European Union in the League of Nations on 8 September 1929, as well as his famous 1930 [...] "Memorandum on the Organisation of a Regime of European Federal Union." ...|$|E
5000|$|Coudenhove-Kalergi is {{recognized}} as {{the founder of the}} first popular movement for a united Europe. His intellectual influences ranged from Immanuel Kant, Rudolf Kjellén and Oswald Spengler to Arthur Schopenhauer and Friedrich Nietzsche. In politics, he was an enthusiastic supporter of [...] "fourteen points" [...] made by Woodrow Wilson on 8 January 1918 and pacifist initiatives of Kurt Hiller. In December 1921, he joined the Masonic lodge [...] "Humanitas" [...] in Vienna. In 1922, he co-founded the <b>Pan-European</b> <b>Union</b> (PEU) with Archduke Otto von Habsburg, as [...] "the only way of guarding against an eventual world hegemony by Russia." [...] In 1923, he published a manifesto entitled Pan-Europa, each copy containing a membership form which invited the reader to {{become a member of the}} Pan-Europa movement. He favored social democracy as an improvement on [...] "the feudal aristocracy of the sword" [...] but his ambition was to create a conservative society that superseded democracy with [...] "the social aristocracy of the spirit." [...] European freemason lodges supported his movement, including the lodge Humanitas. Pan-Europa was translated into the languages of European countries (not total; Italian edition was not published at that time), Japanese, Chinese and so on (not even into Russian).|$|E
5000|$|The {{end of the}} World War II inaugurated {{a revival}} of pan-European hopes. In the winter of 1945, Harry S. Truman read {{an article in the}} December issue of Collier's {{magazine}} that Coudenhove-Kalergi posted about the integration of Europe. His article impressed Truman, and it was adopted to the United States' official policy. Winston Churchill's celebrated speech of 19 September 1946 to the Academic Youth in Zurich commended [...] "the exertions of the <b>Pan-European</b> <b>Union</b> which owes so much to Count Coudenhove-Kalergi and which commanded the services of the famous French patriot and statesman Aristide Briand." [...] In November 1946 and the spring of 1947, Coudenhove-Kalergi circulated an enquiry addressed to members of European parliaments. This enquiry resulted in the founding of the European Parliamentary Union (EPU), a nominally private organization that held its preliminary conference on 4-5 July at Gstaad, Switzerland, and followed it with its first full conference from 8 to 12 September. Speaking at the first EPU conference, Coudenhove-Kalergi argued that the constitution of a wide market with a stable currency was the vehicle for Europe to reconstruct its potential and take the place it deserves within the concert of Nations. On less guarded occasions he was heard to advocate a revival of Charlemagne's empire. In 1950 he received the first annual Karlspreis (Charlemagne Award), given by the German city of Aachen to people who contributed to the European idea and European peace. In Japan, a politician Ichirō Hatoyama was influenced by Coudenhove-Kalergi's fraternity in his book The Totalitarian State Against Man. It was translated into Japanese by Hatoyama and published in 1952. Coudenhove-Kalergi was appointed the honorary chairman of the fraternal youth association that Hatoyama, with the influence of his book, had established in 1953.|$|E
5000|$|Nazis {{considered}} the <b>Pan-European</b> <b>Union</b> {{to be under}} the control of freemasonry. In 1938, a Nazi propaganda book [...] was released in German. It revealed Coudenhove-Kalergi's membership of freemasonry, the organization suppressed by Nazis. On the other hand, his name was not to be found in masonic directories 10,000 Famous Freemasons published in 1957-1960 by the United States' freemasons. He had already left the Viennese freemason's lodge in 1926 to avoid the criticism that had occurred at that time against the relationship between the Pan-European movement and freemasonry. He wrote about his masonic membership in Ein Leben für Europa (A Life for Europe) published in 1966. In fact, its Nazi propaganda book also described his action in 1924-1925 only. However, this propaganda also stated that [...] "The Grand Lodge of Wien went enthusiastically to work for the Pan European Union in a call to all Masonic chief authorities. Even the Masonic newspaper The Beacon enthused about the thoughts of the higher degree Freemason Coudenhove-Kalergi, and stated in March, 1925:"Freemasonry, especially Austrian Freemasonry, may be eminently satisfied to have Coudenhove-Kalergi among its members. Austrian Freemasonry can rightly report that Brother Coudenhove-Kalergi fights for his Pan European beliefs: political honesty, social insight, the struggle against lies, striving for the recognition and cooperation of all those of good will. In this higher sense, Brother Coudenhove-Kalergi's program is a Masonic work of the highest order, {{and to be able to}} work on it together is a lofty task for all brother Masons.""After the annexation of Austria by the Third Reich in 1938, Coudenhove-Kalergi fled to Czechoslovakia, and thence to France. As France fell to Germany in 1940, he escaped to the United States by way of Switzerland and Portugal. When he passed a few days after the successful escape to the United States, he listened to the radio saying the possibility of his death. During the World War II, he continued his call for the unification of Europe along the Paris-London axis. His wartime politics and adventures served as the real life basis for fictional Resistance hero Victor Laszlo, the Paul Henreid character in Casablanca. He published his work Crusade for Paneurope in 1944. His appeal for the unification of Europe enjoyed some support from Winston Churchill, Allen Dulles, and [...] "Wild Bill" [...] Donovan. After the announcement of the Atlantic Charter on 14 August 1941, he composed a memorandum entitled [...] "Austria's Independence in the light of the Atlantic Charter" [...] and sent it to Winston Churchill and Franklin Delano Roosevelt. In his position statement, Coudenhove-Kalergi took up the goals of the charter and recommended himself as head of government in exile. Both Churchill and Roosevelt distanced themselves from this document. From 1942 until his return to France in 1945, he taught at the New York University, which appointed him professor of history in 1944. At the same university Professor Ludwig von Mises studied currency problems for Coudenhove-Kalergi's movement.|$|E
40|$|A {{consensus}} is {{emerging in the}} transatlantic community that the Kremlin’s manipulation of information constitutes a real threat to EU security. Across Europe, far-right, populist and Euro- skeptic political parties are embracing Russia’s information campaigns. In the European Parliament, Marine Le Pen’s Europe of Nations and Freedom (ENF) is the main proponent of pro-Kremlin narratives. The foreign policy platform of the Front National in France contains explicit references to a strategic alliance with the Kremlin and a <b>pan-European</b> <b>Union</b> that includes Russia. Following Brexit, Marine Le Pen is describing the UK vote as a peoples’ rebellion that has signaled {{the beginning of the}} end for the EU, much like the fall of the Berlin Wall signaled the collapse of the Soviet Union. Conceivably, in the aftermath of Brexit the absence of British Eurosceptic MEPs from the European Parliament may lead to the consolidation of the radical far-right under the banner of the Front National. In turn, this means that the EU may have a rather difficult time gathering the necessary support to confront Russian assertiveness in the Eastern Neighbourhood...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, at first, the {{movement}} of European integration such asthe <b>Pan-European</b> <b>Union</b> and the European Economic and Customs Union and the concrete integration form, for example, International Crude Steel Community are taken up. These were {{none other than the}} reflection of 2 ̆ 7 European problem 2 ̆ 7, which had appeared after the First World War. In the 1930 s European integration was distorted to the Nazi military integration by its hegemonic order. The integration idea of resistance movements was sophisticated by the severe battle against the European new order by the Nazis. This marked a very important movement following the institutionalization of the economic integration after the Second World War. Its first step was the inauguration of European Coal and Steel Community in 1952. The second step was the creation of European Economic Community (EEC) in 1958. EEC was a great success. The internal trade within EEC became the biggest key route in the world trade. Customs union was completed in July 1968 {{in the middle of the}} sustained economic growth and historical rehabilitation of European economy. Thus, the mood of the self-satisfaction over economic integration brought forth and it came to make a halt. Its transition to higher dimension was not self-evident after the completion of customs union at all. 欧文抄録: p. 10...|$|E
40|$|In {{the summer}} of 2014 the Swedish Church is celebrating the 100 th anniversary of the {{appointment}} of Nathan Söderblom as archbishop of Uppsala, and thus head of the Swedish church organisation. As a Lutheran with an enormously broad-minded and broad-reaching approach to ecumenical understanding and community-building, Söderblom shot to prominence {{in the interwar period}} not only because of his ecumenical engagement, calling for an evangelical catholicity so stand {{side by side with the}} Roman catholic and Orthodox catholic traditions, but also because of his comprehensive secular engagement for peace and understanding between peoples. In the latter context he also acquired a solid reputation as a perhaps less prominent but still noteworthy figure in the history of European integration. This article investigates how, why and to what extent Söderblom’s ecumenical and secular engagements were intertwined. The first part discusses how his biographical and academic background led to such staunch ecumenical positions, while the second part focuses on the secular engagement, which was perceived by Söderblom as necessary to make progress on the ecumenical front in the practical political realities of the 1920 s. The final part, comparing and contrasting Söderblom’s views with those of Count Richard von Coudenhove-Calergi and the <b>Pan-European</b> <b>Union,</b> demonstrates why Söderblom’s engagement for Europe had to be limited: unity in Christ is by definition global in nature and therefore cannot be continent-specific...|$|E
40|$|Summary: The {{product of}} {{discrete}} sources and strands, {{the protection of}} fundamental rights in Europe has now begun to knit together. The difficulties spring less from widely varying views of what fundamental rights ought to be than from their being played out upon different planes and to different purpose: pan-Europe {{by virtue of the}} European Convention on Human Rights, and <b>pan-European</b> <b>Union</b> with its economic (Community) emphasis and partially common law approach combined now with a codified Charter of Fundamental Rights. Perhaps more contentious is the institutional mechanisms by which rights are to be judicially protected, the relatively coherent Convention system and the quasi-appellate jurisdiction of the Court of Human Rights through the right of individual petition, and the Community/Union system which exists in a different dimension yet embraces (or purports to embrace), but is not (yet) formally married to, the Convention – but to which, it is important to remember, the member states are signatory and still subject. The two courts {{at the heart of this}} protection, the Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg and the Court of Justice in Luxembourg, have moved slowly into a closer embrace, but each remains subject still to the peculiarities of its jurisdiction, conscious of the practical limits to its authority and wary of the risks of over-confidence and extending itself too far. Recent developments in their case law, brought about especially by the growth of Union activities which escape Luxembourg scrutiny, have brought issues to a head and produced both robustness and deference from Strasbourg. At the same time events are moving on as life is breathed back into the Constitution for Europe, which had proposed one solution, by the draft Reform Treaty, which proposes another. It also goes down the road of yet more variable geometry, a device all too easy as a means of earning agreement in the political arena but often leaving legal chaos in its wake...|$|E
