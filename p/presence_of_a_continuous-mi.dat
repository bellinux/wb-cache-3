30|$|In {{the domain}} {{personnel}} and resources, the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> box trainer is considered relatively {{more important than}} the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> virtual reality (VR) trainer. This finding is consistent with recent results of Palter et al., who found in their inventory that residents prefer box trainers above VR simulators for training the more advanced laparoscopic skills [13]. Regarding the assessment of laparoscopic skills, both trainer models have an equally good correlation [14]. VR trainers have the advantage as they allow solitary training while the supervisor can monitor the resident's skills level electronically. On the other hand, the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> supervisor required during box training has the advantage that surgical knowledge can be transmitted. Furthermore, the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> laboratory technician is rated low. This could be {{explained by the fact that}} an enthusiastic laparoscopic expert can fulfil this role. However, in our opinion, the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> permanent availability <b>of</b> <b>a</b> technician gives <b>a</b> professionalizing <b>of</b> skills laboratory, with all its advantages.|$|R
40|$|Objective To {{test whether}} the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> peer {{or a friend}} {{increases}} the motivation to be physically active in overweight and non-overweight youth in a laboratory setting.  Methods Youth motivation to be physically active as <b>a</b> function <b>of</b> the social context was measured using a computerized relative reinforcing value task to earn points exchangeable for physical and/or sedentary activities.  Results The <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> friend (p<. 001) increased youth's; motivation to be physically active. The <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> peer increased overweight youth's; motivation to be physically active, whereas {{this was not the}} case for lean youth (p=. 47). Participants biked a greater distance in the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> friend than when alone (p<. 001). Overweight youth biked a greater distance in the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> peer than when alone, while {{this was not the case}} for lean youth (p=. 23). Conclusions Friendships may increase youth's; motivation to engage in physical activity and promote greater physical activity in non-overweight and overweight youth...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{we study}} N= 1 supersymmetric {{theories}} in four dimensions in <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> boundary. We demonstrate {{that it is}} possible to preserve half the supersymmetry of the original theory by suitably modifying it in <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> boundary. This is done by adding new boundary terms to the original action, such that the supersymmetric variation of the new terms exactly cancels the boundary terms generated by the supersymmetric transformation of the original bulk action. We also analyze the boundary projections of such supercharges used in such a theory. We study super-Yang–Mills theories in <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> boundary using these results. Finally, we study the Born–Infeld action in <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> boundary. We analyze the boundary effects for the Born–Infeld action coupled to a background dilaton and an axion field. We also analyze the boundary effects for a non-abelian Born–Infeld action. We explicitly construct the actions for these systems in <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> boundary.
