40|$|The {{effects of}} modifying the {{chemical}} structure of Th 1165 a on its selectivity in vitro for the β-adrenoreceptors of guinea-pig trachea have been examined. The mean log EC 50 s of the compounds on guinea-pig trachea and atria (rate) {{were used as}} estimates of potency. The alternative racemic from of Th 1165 a, i. e. Th 1179, was less potent on trachea but was only slightly less selective. Removal of the p-hydroxyl from the N-substituted phenylisopropyl group of Th 1165 a markedly reduced both its potency on trachea and its selectivity. Me 506, an N-tertiary butyl homologue of Th 1165 a, was equipotent with salbutamol on trachea and was of equivalent selectivity. It was more selective than Th 1165 a. The analogue in which the resorcinol nucleus of Th 1165 a {{is replaced by a}} catechol nucleus, i. e. Cc- 25, was the most potent compound on the trachea but it was less selective than Th 1165 a. Salbutamol and soterenol, which were included in the study for comparative purposes, were both selective for trachea but an accurate estimate of their mean log EC 50 s on atria was difficult to obtain because the mean maximum increase in atrial rate was 58 % for salbutamol and 52 % for soterenol. <b>Protokylol</b> was the only drug examined which was equipotent on trachea and atria. Isoprenaline was not equipotent and higher concentrations of isoprenaline were required to produce half maximal responses of trachea than of atria. The possible reasons for the in vitro selectivity of the drugs examined for trachea or atria are discussed...|$|E
