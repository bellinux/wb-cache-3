The order was subcontracted to Seattle Construction and Drydock Company {{for a total of}} $818,000. The Electric Boat Company then designed and built a boat in a way that could be taken apart and shipped across country to Seattle to be assembled. After sea trials, the submarines now named Iquique and Antofogasta were refused by the Chilean officials as they had failed to achieve the radius of action demanded in the contract. At the same time, Chile had allowed its <b>progress</b> <b>payments</b> to fall in arrears. This led the Seattle shipbuilding company to find ways {{to get rid of the}} submarines.|$|E

Works on the Gippsland electrification was to be completed to Warragul station by 1953, but due to the funding cuts the time line was revised to 1954. 500 of the precut houses were cancelled, the Victorian contribution to joint carriage stock for use on The Overland was cut to 6 sitting cars, and work at Newport Workshops building locomotives, carriages and livestock trucks was suspended. Outside rolling stock contractors were also told to slow down, and to defer claims for <b>progress</b> <b>payments</b> until the 1953-54 financial year.|$|E

2500|$|Askin's {{government}} {{was marked by}} strong opposition {{to an increase in}} Commonwealth powers, a tough stance on [...] "law and order" [...] issues, laissez-faire economic policies, and aggressive support for industrial and commercial development. At his first Cabinet meeting, Askin restored direct air services between Sydney and Dubbo, and required Joern Utzon, the Danish architect then working on the Sydney Opera House, to provide a final price and completion date for the Opera House, which had gone past the original estimates for both. His Public Works Minister Davis Hughes began to assert control over the project and demanded that costs be reined in. This brought him into direct conflict with Utzon and in February 1966, after a bitter standoff and the suspension of <b>progress</b> <b>payments</b> by Hughes, Utzon resigned, sparking a major public outcry. Two weeks after the first Government meeting, the Askin Government abolished the tow-away system for Sydney and Newcastle.

40|$|Although {{significant}} {{research work}} has been conducted on cash flow forecast, planning, and management, the objective is constantly the maximization of profit/final cash balance, or minimization of total project cost. This paper presents a multi-objective fuzzy linear programming model (FLP) for resolving the optimization problem of three conflicting objectives: final cash balance, cost of money, and initial cash balance. The proposed model depends on Jiang et al. (2011) Model. In the new formulation, both the advanced payment and delay of owner's <b>progress</b> <b>payment</b> one period were considered. Literature concerned with cash flow studies and models for construction projects was reviewed. Fuzzy linear programming applications in literature was presented and it's concept was then described. Jiang et al. (2011) Model is presented. The proposed model development was then presented. The proposed model was validated using an example project. An optimization of each individual objective was performed with a linear programming (LP) software (Lindo) that gave {{the upper and lower}} bounds for the multi-objective analysis. Fuzzy linear programming was then applied to optimize the solution. Four cases are considered: considering advanced payment and delay of owner's <b>progress</b> <b>payment</b> one period simultaneously, then separately, and neglecting advanced payment and delay of owner's <b>progress</b> <b>payment.</b> Penalty of delayed payment have been also considered. Analysis of the results revealed that the model is an effective decision making tool to be used by industry practitioners with reasonable accuracy...|$|R

The questionnaire method was used in this research.

The analysis of the identified causes indicates that the top five severe direct dispute causes are: delay in <b>progress</b> <b>payment</b> by owner, unrealistic contract duration, change orders, poor quality of completed works, and labor inefficiencies respectively. While the top five severe indirect dispute causes are: inadequate contractor’s experience, lack of communication between construction parties, ineffective planning and scheduling of project by contractor, cash problems during construction, and poor estimation practices...|$|R
40|$|Since the {{introduction}} of the Building and Construction Industry Security of Payment Act into New South Wales in 1999, construction industry payment legislation has progressively been enacted on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis throughout Australia. Of the eight Australian Acts, two distinct legislative models can be discerned – what have been termed the ‘East Coast’ and ‘West Coast’ models. This article compares the two models with respect to their payment systems and adjudication schemes, procedural justice afforded, incursion upon freedom of contract, uptake rates and efficiency. From this comparison, {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} the two models are identified. Finally, a dual process of adjudication based on <b>progress</b> <b>payment</b> claim size is proposed for a harmonised model, developed from previous proposals put forward by other authors, which aims to combine the strengths of the two existing models...|$|R
