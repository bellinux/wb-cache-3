30|$|This paper {{introduces}} a novel gear–clutch mechanism that {{takes advantage of}} the difference between the directions in the reaction forces that occur during meshing and jamming to ensure jam-free engagement of the gears. The proposed mechanism is a more compact advancement of the previously developed linear rack-tilting clutch used to provide a step change in the reduction ratio. Mathematical models of the jam-free and stable meshing condition of the proposed mechanism are developed and experimentally verified, along with a discussion and recommendations to be considered as design guidelines. Additionally, a singularly actuated robotic joint prototype is developed to examine the performance of the proposed clutch mechanism. The joint was driven by a small 2 -W DC motor. The maximum output torque was 4  Nm with a maximum travel range of over 200 ^∘ during the high-force phase, and the maximum speed was 252 ^∘/s with an infinite travel range during the high-speed phase. The mechanism exhibits potential for applications that benefit from a step transmission and long force-exerting travel range such as vices, grippers, <b>and</b> industrial <b>punching</b> <b>and</b> <b>shearing</b> <b>machines,</b> as well as robotic arms and power assist exoskeletons.|$|R
30|$|We {{developed}} a novel jam-free gear–clutch mechanism and its mathematical model for jam-negation and stable meshing conditions. The conditions were experimentally confirmed to reasonably predict the engagement behavior {{to a certain}} degree. We conclude that {{the small amount of}} deviation from the calculated conditions was mainly caused by friction forces, which were neglected in the model assumption. We also discussed the effects of friction and the actual design recommendations for the link angle θ. As an example application, we {{developed a}} single-actuated robotic joint that can provide step transmission using the proposed gear–clutch. Its ability to abruptly change the reduction ratio and travel range in HF phase was verified through experiments. We can choose any two different reduction ratios (H and L in Fig. 10) and design a gear–clutch mechanism with the required HF travel range to suit the target application. To our knowledge, the proposed mechanism shows a reliable engagement approach for applications that benefit from a step transmission and long travel range in the HF phase. Possible applications for this mechanism include robotic arms, power assist exoskeletons, and industrial machines such as vices, grippers, <b>and</b> <b>punching</b> <b>and</b> <b>shearing</b> <b>machines.</b>|$|R

Girouard had to establish two technical schools to train his Sudanese workers about how to work as station masters, yard shunters and signalers as none of those skills were known in the Sudan which had never known railroads.

40|$|The {{design and}} {{construction}} of civil engineering structures take into great consideration the sensitivity of such structures {{in the event of}} local failures. Flat slab structural systems are very prone to progressive collapse after the failure of a connection or column. Hence, to improve their robustness the introduction of integrity reinforcement is recommended in Eurocode 2, ACI 318 - 11 and Model Code 2010. However, very little investigation has been carried out on the asymmetric post-punching response of these connections or the actual contribution of designed integrity reinforcement to robustness at a system level. Presented in this paper, is a numeric approach developed for modelling the response of isolated RC flat slab test specimens using the finite element (FE) software LS-DYNA. This is in view of their incorporation into system models for both quasi-static and dynamic assessments of robustness in flat slab structures. Quarter FE models of four symmetric isolated RC flat slab specimens with experimental responses available in literature were developed. These quarter FE models were analysed numerically using a quasi-static displacement controlled approach <b>and</b> their flexural, <b>punching</b> <b>shear</b> <b>and</b> post-punching <b>shear</b> responses observed. A sensitivity analysis was carried out to obtain the optimum element characteristics for punching shear strength as well as other response criteria. Half asymmetric F. E models of two slab specimens were also developed and analysed. These provided the asymmetric <b>punching</b> <b>and</b> post-punching <b>shear</b> response of the slab specimens, assuming the loss of an interior column. Results of quarter symmetric FE models gave accurate predictions of slab load-deformation responses, <b>punching</b> <b>and</b> post-punching <b>shear</b> strengths. Maximum percentage differences of 2 % and 3 % were obtained when comparing test and FE results of symmetric slab specimens for peak <b>punching</b> <b>and</b> post-punching <b>shear</b> strengths respectively. Asymmetric FE models gave post-punching shear strengths lower than values obtained from tests on symmetric specimens. Robustness of flat slab structures after the loss of an internal column could be significantly overestimated where models adopted do not take into consideration such reductions in post punching shear strength. The results presented validate the use of this FE approach on LS-DYNA to predict the response of concrete flat slab connections...|$|R

Four ribbed slabs with similar dimensions of 2. 8 m length × 1. 2 m width and 0. 2 m thickness were constructed. Two of the samples were considered as control samples (conventionally reinforced with reinforcement bars and welded mesh) while another two samples were fully reinforced with 1 % (80 kg/m 3) volume of steel fibres incorporated to the SCC mix. For the flexural behaviour study, the ribbed slab samples were subjected to two line loads under four point bending.

40|$|When {{grown in}} a common light environment, the leaves of shade-tolerant {{evergreen}} trees have a larger leaf mass per unit area (LMA) than their light-demanding counterparts, associated with differences in lifespan.

Growth light environment had less effect on leaf mechanics than on LMA: shade leaves had, on average, 40 % lower LMA than sun leaves, but differences in work-to-shear, and especially force-to-punch, were smaller. This was associated with a slightly larger cell wall fraction in shade leaves.

The laboratory experiments simulated were the punching tests of the shotcrete by Holmgren (1979) <b>and</b> the direct <b>shear</b> tests by Malmgren et al (2005). The analysis of the punching tests comprised plain shotcrete and shotcrete reinforced by bolts. Two different approaches were used to model the shotcrete behavior: (i) liner structural elements and (ii) zoned block material. The liner structural elements only allows for separation at the interface while the shotcrete material is linear elastic. The zoned block material was assigned linear elastic material as well as linear elastic- perfectly plastic properties. Numerical model geometry of <b>punch</b> <b>and</b> direct <b>shear</b> tests which {{are the same as}} physical problems constructed by numerical codes. For both <b>punch</b> <b>and</b> direct <b>shear</b> test the shotcrete layer has smaller zone size than the rock block zones size. From the punch test the results indicate that, the interaction between shotcrete and rock for both elastic and linear elastic perfectly plastic material is governed by interfaces properties. For all tests in punch the interface breaks when tensile strength of the interface reached, the strength drops to zero while in the laboratory experiment the strength drops to two third In direct shear test, the result in both elastic and linear elastic perfectly plastic material gives the values which are less than the laboratory experiment result. Since laboratory tests are expensive and time consuming, there advantages of using numerical methods in analyzing the interaction of rock and shotcrete.

Tensile properties of high-strength concrete in terms of modulus of rupture, direct tensile strength and fracture energy were examined up to 700 freeze-thaw cycles in laboratory simulated environment. [...] An experimental investigation on shear enhancement was carried out on seven high-strength concrete slabs to study the <b>punching</b> <b>shear</b> capacity <b>and</b> <b>shear</b> enhancement. Five types of different shear reinforcement, namely single bending, U-stirrup, double bending, shear-stud <b>and</b> T-headed <b>shear</b> reinforcement were tested and evaluated. The emphasis is placed upon the evaluation of their contribution to punching shear capacity of high-strength concrete plates. Structural behaviours were evaluated in terms of overall load-deflection response, ultimate loading capacity, post-ultimate loading capacity, ductility and energy absorption. Failure patterns and strain distribution were also discussed. [...] The analytical investigation was conducted by using the finite element analysis. The finite element analysis reported herein is an application of the nonlinear analysis of reinforced concrete structures using three-dimensional solid finite element.

40|$|AbstractA variational {{multiscale}} {{method has}} been presented for efficient analysis of elastoplastic deformation problems. Severe deformation occurs in plastic region and leads to high gradient displacement. Therefore, solution needs to be refined to properly capture local deformation in plastic region. In this work, scale decomposition based on variational formulation is presented. A coarse scale and a fine scale are introduced to represent global and local behavior, respectively. The displacement is decomposed into a coarse and a fine scale. Subsequently the problem is also decomposed into a coarse and a fine scale from the variational formulation. Each scale variable is approximated using meshfree method. Adaptivity can easily and nicely be implemented in meshfree method. As a method of increasing resolution, extrinsic enrichment of partition of unity is used. Each scale problem is solved iteratively and conversed results are obtained consequently. Iteration procedure is indispensable for the elastoplastic deformation analysis. Therefore iterative solution procedure of each scale problem is naturally adequate.

In addition, an intensity factor was proposed for effective widths of slabs that carry an unbalanced moment delivered by bending.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A direct {{punching}} of inclined ultra-high strength {{steel sheets}} having low ductility {{was carried out}} {{to improve the quality}} of the sheared edge. In the direct punching of an inclined sheet, the contact between the sheet <b>and</b> <b>punch</b> became gradual because of touch from the bottom edge of the <b>punch,</b> <b>and</b> thus the <b>sheared</b> portion tended to bend in the latter half of punching. As the strength of the sheet increased, defects such as burr and secondary burnished surface were occurred around the sheared edge due to the low ductility. The range of direct punching for sheared edge without defects was shown for the high strength steel sheets. To prevent the occurrence of defects, a punch having inclined bottom was used. In this punch, the contact with the sheet was changed, the uniform contact with the inclined bottom was given. In the punch having the inclined bottom, the secondary burnished surface in the edge of 980 MPa grade steel sheet was prevented...|$|R
2500|$|Having secured these contracts, Roach {{set about}} {{equipping}} the Etna Iron Works {{for its new}} role. He began by hiring Thomas Main, a leading engineer with experience {{in a number of}} the world's most advanced engine works, as the plant's superintendent. Roach then began reorganizing the Works, adding a boilershop, machine shop, coppersmith shop and blacksmith, and equipping the plant with a host of new machines including traveling and swing cranes and the steam engines to power them, along with planers, lathes, boring mills, <b>punches,</b> <b>shears</b> <b>and</b> rollers. Amongst the new equipment was a planer capable of finishing 100-ton iron plates, and a lathe capable of boring a [...] cylinder—the two largest machine tools in the entire country.|$|R
