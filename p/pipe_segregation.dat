40|$|In {{recent years}} after {{most of the}} {{concrete}} mixings are executed, a concrete pump isâ€¢ generally used on the construction site; but, unfortunately, as blockages happen in the pipe-line, it becomes necessary to make the concrete more plastic than the required plasticity in the original construction. The {{reason for this is}} that there is not a measuring method to accur-ately express the concrete pumpability. The authors produced,'by some trials, a simulate model of concrete pump having two hydraulic jacks at both ends of a steel pipe. The jacks can act simultaneously keeping the pressure in the pipe at desired values as the oil pressure system is connected with both of them. The authors made sure that the model of the pumping system behaved like truck-mounted pumps used in construction sites, and then investigated several causes that influence the pumpability in this testing apparatus. It was inferred that, with the model pump, loss of pressure in the <b>pipe,</b> <b>segregation</b> of fresh concrete under high pressure and influence of ta-pered pipe could be obtained. From the results, it was concluded that this apparatus could be used in the experiments as the pumping properties of the model concrete-pump were almost the same as the ones of a normal truck-mounted pump. 1...|$|E
40|$|Centerline {{segregation}} {{occurs as}} a positive concentration of alloying elements in the mid-thickness region of continuously cast slab. Depending upon its severity, it may affect mechanical properties and potentially downstream processing such as weldability, particularly for high-strength line <b>pipe.</b> The <b>segregation</b> fraction in continuously cast slabs and corresponding hot-rolled strips was assessed on API 5 L grade X 65 line pipe steels with different levels of segregation, rated as Mannesmann 2. 0 and 1. 4. The {{results showed that the}} segregation fraction in hot-rolled strip samples was in accordance with that assessed in the cast slabs, and the segregated regions in hot-rolled strip samples were found to be discontinuous. Transverse and z-direction CVN impact tests were conducted on the two strips and the results showed that centerline segregation does have an influence on the Charpy impact properties of line pipe steel. Specimens located at segregated regions exhibited lower Charpy impact toughness and strips rolled from slabs with higher segregation levels are more likely to exhibit greater variability in Charpy impact toughness. The influence of centerline segregation on z-direction Charpy impact toughness is more severe than on transverse Charpy impact toughness. Lower Charpy impact toughness and brittle fracture surface with cleavage facets along with rod-shaped MnS inclusions were observed for the strip rolled from slab with 2. 0 segregation rating if the Charpy specimens were located at segregated regions. The influence on Charpy impact toughness can be associated with the pearlite structure at the centerline and level of MnS inclusions...|$|R
