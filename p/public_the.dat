40|$|This study {{explored}} <b>public</b> involvement within <b>the</b> Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) {{using the}} co-orientational theory. Effective <b>public</b> involvement gives <b>the</b> <b>public</b> opportunities {{to be involved}} early in the planning and implementation of transportation projects that directly affect or may concern them. The co-orientational model looks at what an organization (FDOT) thinks about an issue (<b>public</b> involvement), what <b>the</b> <b>public</b> thinks of <b>the</b> issue, what the organization thinks <b>the</b> <b>public</b> thinks about <b>the</b> issue, and what <b>the</b> <b>public</b> thinks <b>the</b> organization thinks about the issue. This study investigated whether the FDOT management has an accurate understanding of the perceptions of <b>the</b> <b>public</b> and communicates effectively with them. To achieve accurate perceptions of <b>the</b> <b>public,</b> management must interact with <b>the</b> <b>public</b> to identify issues that could become potential crises if not addressed at an early stage. This study examined whether there is true consensus or dissensus among <b>the</b> <b>public</b> and <b>the</b> FDOT management {{and looked at the}} perceptions of both groups and the distance between them to see if the needs of <b>the</b> <b>public</b> and <b>the</b> Department can both be met. A critical part of this research included analyzing the opinions of <b>the</b> <b>public</b> to see if <b>the</b> <b>public</b> trusts government and the FDOT. Furthermore, this study set out to determine a relationship between trust and involvement and the different techniques used to communicate. Research was gathered through surveys to <b>the</b> <b>public</b> and to FDOT management. <b>The</b> <b>public</b> surveys were handed out at transportation <b>public</b> meetings across <b>the</b> state of Florida over a period of six months to gain <b>the</b> <b>publics</b> perception of <b>the</b> issue and <b>the</b> <b>publics</b> estimate of <b>the</b> management perceptions...|$|R
