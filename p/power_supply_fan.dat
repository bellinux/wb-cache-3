50|$|The {{reasons given}} for this {{approach}} to power supply are that it eliminates cross-load problems, simplifies and reduces internal wiring that can affect airflow and cooling, reduces costs, increases power supply efficiency, and reduces noise by bringing the <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> <b>fan</b> speed {{under the control of}} the motherboard.|$|E
50|$|As {{with most}} computers, the rear fan and <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> <b>fan</b> exhaust, moving hot air {{away from the}} computer. This causes a slight {{depressurization}} inside the chassis, and requires all other openings to become intake vents. Airflow {{from the front of}} the chassis moves around the Chassis Air Guide, allowing the processor fan to only draw air from outside the chassis, providing more effective cooling.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} ATX specification {{called for}} a power supply to be located near to the CPU with the <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> <b>fan</b> drawing in cooling air from outside the chassis and directing it onto the processor. It was thought that in this configuration, cooling of the processor would be achievable without the need of an active heatsink.http://www.intel.com/support/processors/pentium/sb/cs-011025.htm This recommendation was removed from later specifications; modern ATX power supplies usually exhaust air from the case.|$|E

50|$|Bob Marsh, Lee Felsenstein and Gordon French started {{designing}} the Sol-20 between April and July 1975. The Sol-20 utilized the Intel 8080 8-bit microprocessor chip, running at 2 MHz. A {{major difference between}} the Sol-20 and most other machines of the era was its built-in video driver, which allowed it to be attached to a composite monitor for display. The Sol-20 consisted of a main motherboard (PCB) mounted {{at the bottom of}} the case, and a five slot S-100 bus card cage. The main PCB consisted of the CPU, memory, video display, I/O circuits. Inside the case included <b>power</b> <b>supply,</b> <b>fan,</b> and keyboard. The case was painted 'IBM blue' and the sides of the case were made of solid oiled walnut originally salvaged from a gun stock manufacturer.|$|E
50|$|In {{contrast}} to desktop PCs, laptops and netbooks typically {{do not have}} <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> <b>fans</b> or video card fans, generally use physically smaller hard drives and lower power components.

50|$|Typically, square 120 mm and 140 mm {{case and}} <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> <b>fans</b> are used where cooling {{requirements}} are demanding, as for computers {{used to play}} games, and for quieter operation at lower speeds. 80 mm and 92 mm fans are used in less demanding applications, or where larger fans would not be compatible.

50|$|Processors in most early x86-based computers, {{up to some}} of {{the early}} 486s, did not need active ventilation. <b>Power</b> <b>supplies</b> needed forced cooling, and <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> <b>fans</b> also {{circulated}} cooling air {{through the rest of the}} PC with the ATX standard. The byproduct of increased heat generation is that the fan(s) need to move increasing amounts air and thus need to be more powerful. Since they must move more air through the same area of space, fans will become more noisy.|$|R

The server‟s physical health gets report to Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) by different sensors that built into the system. All the sensors information is provided by Sensor Data Records (SDRs). SDRs provide the data records that contain information about the type and number of sensors in the platform, sensor threshold support, chassis intrusion, <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> monitoring, <b>fan</b> speeds, fan presence, board voltages, board temperatures, bus errors, memory errors. SDR are created manually by the users using the information provided by Configuration sheet. In this paper the need to automate the generation of SDR is discussed in two ways: the SDR mapping to the spreadsheets and provided the details without spreadsheets. This paper proposed a solution by implementing of the SDR creation automation tool.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{issues that}} relate to downscaling the height of centrifugal fans for application in low profile technologies, such as the cooling of portable power electronics. The parameters studied include flow rate, pressure rise, and power consumption characteristics. The former two of these are measured using a fan characterization rig and the latter by directly measuring the <b>power</b> <b>supplied</b> to the <b>fan.</b> These are studied for fan diameters ranging from 15 to 30 mm with numerous profile heights between 0. 3 mm and 15 mm. It is found {{that all of the}} phenomena encountered are best described in terms of fan aspect ratio. The results show that the conventional scaling laws cannot be accurately applied when blade profile alone is scaled. Indeed, the only parameter reasonably well predicted was the pressure rise attainable, but that was only accurate for fan aspect ratios greater than 0. 17. Below this, the pressure rise generated reduces logarithmically toward zero. The study also reveals that no advantage is gained by using fans of aspect ratio greater than 0. 3, as the maximum flow rate attainable decreases slightly above this. Overall, the scaling phenomena reported herein provide invaluable information for the future design of efficient low-profile cooling solutions that are to incorporate such fans...|$|R
