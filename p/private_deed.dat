This Act has brought about two {{important}} changes in respect of {{the purchase of a}} home by a buyer who does not act {{in the course of a}} profession or business (consumer-buyer). In the first place, for the conclusion of such an agreement an exception is made to the general rule that legal acts have no set form.

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{focuses on}} the development of the Dutch silent pledge on claims, which was introduced by legislation after the fiducia became prohibited. Financial institutions were of the opinion that the prohibition on the fiducia would limit the provision of credit and have negative economic consequences. The legislature was of the opinion that with the silent pledge the provision of credit could continue as a matter of course. This contribution traces the development of the silent pledge since then. It starts with a discussion of the introduction of the “silent cession” as a means of security, and then moves to the silent pledge. In terms of the Dutch civil code, a pledge can be created by means of an authentic or registered <b>private</b> <b>deed</b> without the knowledge of the debtor. The purpose of the authentic or registered deed is to ensure that a fixed date can be ascribed to the pledge to be able to determine the rank of the right of pledge in relation to the rights of third parties. Registration, however, does not mean registration in a public register – it is a silent pledge since no publicity is given to this encumbrance of assets. The author discusses the different aspects concerning the silent pledge: the pledge of future debts, a shortened registration period, the meaning of adequate definiteness in the deed, collective pledge deeds, and the collection and redress of the pledged debt. The issue of netting also comes to the fore. It is concluded that the banks have, by means of clever litigation, ensured that the silent pledge is used to their benefit. The silent pledge is currently functioning as a kind of generally applicable right of security. The flipside of the coin is that, in practice, almost every single susceptible asset is subject to a silent pledge, which means that at the insolvency of a debtor, after all the pledgees’claims are dealt with, there is almost nothing left for the concurrent creditors. As a result of the voracity of these very hungry caterpillars, there is nothing left in the insolvent estate. It is becoming clear that the position of the normal creditors in relation to the banks needs to be improved and strengthened...|$|E

50|$|After {{the end of}} the Civil War and the {{abolition}} of slavery, Jim Crow laws were introduced. These laws led to the discrimination of racial and ethnic minorities, especially African Americans. Fifteen state courts obeyed ordinances that enforced the denial of housing to African American and other minority groups in white-zoned areas. These ordinances were then made illegal in the 1917 Supreme Court case, Buchanan v. Warley. Following this decision, however, nineteen states legally supported “covenants,” or agreements, between property owners to not rent or sell any homes to racial or ethnic minorities. Although the covenants, too, were made illegal in 1948, they were still allowed to be present in <b>private</b> <b>deeds.</b> It was not until the Civil Rights Act of 1968, otherwise known as the Fair Housing Act, that the federal government made its first concrete steps to deem all types of housing discrimination unconstitutional. The act explicitly prohibits housing discrimination practices common at the time, including filtering information about a home’s availability, racial steering, blockbusting, and redlining.|$|R

The gist of the converging common European rules pertaining to notaries public are the principle of independence of notaries and the principle of legality, which means that the notaries are in the performance of their duties bound only by the norms of civil substantive and procedure law. Notaries public perform also a function of public service, since they provide assistance to citizens in drafting their public instruments and <b>private</b> <b>deeds</b> (juridical acts and statements), that produce the required evidentiary strength.

5000|$|To {{train the}} dictatores, {{as they were}} known, {{specimens}} {{of public and private}} acta were placed before them, and they had to listen to commentaries thereon. Thus arose the yet extant formularies, between the 5th and the 9th centuries. These models were sometimes of a purely academic nature, but their number is small; in almost every case they are taken from real documents, in the transcription of which the individualizing references were suppressed so as to make them take on the appearance of general formulæ; in many instances nothing was suppressed. The formulæ deal with public documents: royal decrees on civil matters, ordinances etc.; with documents relative to legal processes and the administration of justice; or with <b>private</b> <b>deeds</b> drawn up by a notary: sales, exchanges, gifts to churches and monasteries, transference of ecclesiastical property, the manumission of slaves, the settlement of matrimonial dowries, the execution of wills etc. Finally, there are deeds which refer solely to ecclesiastical concerns: consecrations of churches, blessings of various kinds, excommunications, etc. The study of the medieval formularies is of importance for the history of legislation, the rise of institutions, the development of manners and customs, of civil history, above all for the criticism of charters and diplomas, and for researches in medieval philology. In those times the ecclesiastical and civil orders were closely related. Many civil functions and some of the highest state offices were held by ecclesiastics and monks. The ars dictandi was taught in the schools connected with the monasteries and those under ecclesiastical control. For quite a long time all acta were drawn up only in Latin, and as the vernacular languages, in Romance lands, gradually fell away from classical Latin, recourse to ecclesiastics and monks became a matter of necessity. The formularies are of course anything but models of good Latinity; {{with the exception of the}} Letters (Variæ) of Cassiodorus, and the St. Gall collection [...] "Sub Salomone", they are written in careless or even barbarous Latin, though it is possible that their wretched [...] "style" [...] is intentional, so as to render them intelligible to the multitude.|$|R

The balance of power, at the outset favourable to the chapter of Saint-Martin, was gradually reversed in favour of the bourgeois, who emerged on the social arena by taking over a spatial identity initially created by the canons. Since the spatial data used to legitimate a social position are both physical and ideational (a wall, a river, a city, a political territory?), it seemed interesting to produce a graphic representation of these forms of lived space that changed over time and reflected the changing balance of power in society...|$|R

It was found that while government-assisted land resettlement averaged ± 85 000 ha/year over the period 1984 - 2001, the private land market redistributed between 25 000 and 80 000 ha per year to "black" farmers between 1996 and 1999. Unfortunately, beginning in 2000 with the Fast Track programme, the private land market for both "black" and "white" farmers has collapsed, as have land valuations and mortgage financing. Meanwhile, the public leasing market in the late 1990 s accelerated as government began to unload its properties on the public leasing market. Neither process - financial distress in the rural sector or government ownership and leasing of land - provides the foundations for a productive agricultural sector.
