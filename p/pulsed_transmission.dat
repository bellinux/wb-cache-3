50|$|The IRI can {{transmit}} between 2.7 and 10 MHz, a frequency range that lies above the AM radio broadcast band and well below Citizens' Band frequency allocations. The HAARP Station is licensed to transmit only in certain segments of this frequency range, however. When the IRI is transmitting, the bandwidth of the transmitted signal is 100 kHz or less. The IRI {{can transmit}} in continuous waves (CW) or in pulses {{as short as}} 10 microseconds (µs). CW transmission is generally used for ionospheric modification, while transmission in short pulses frequently repeated {{is used as a}} radar system. Researchers can run experiments that use both modes of transmission, first modifying the ionosphere for a predetermined amount of time, then measuring the decay of modification effects with <b>pulsed</b> <b>transmissions.</b>|$|R
