5|$|The Murray cod {{is a large}} grouper-like {{fish with}} a deep, {{elongated}} body that is round in cross section. It has a broad, scooped head, and a large mouth lined with pads of very small, needle-like teeth. The jaws of the Murray cod are equal, or the lower jaw <b>protrudes</b> slightly.|$|E
5|$|Goodison Park {{is unique}} {{in the sense that}} a church, St Luke's, <b>protrudes</b> into the site between the Goodison Road Stand and the Gwladys Street Stand only yards from the corner flag. Everton do not play early kick-offs on Sundays in order to permit Sunday {{services}} at the church. The church is synonymous with the football club and a wooden church structure was in place when Goodison Park was originally built. Former Everton players such as Brian Harris have had their funeral service held there.|$|E
5|$|The unique {{crest of}} Saurolophus {{is made up}} almost {{completely}} by the nasal bones, and in S. angustirostris it is solid. In adult specimens the crests are a rounded triangular shape in cross section. The crest <b>protrudes</b> past {{the edge of the}} skull backwards. Thin processes from the frontals and prefrontals extend along the underside of the crest, probably to strengthen it. At the end of the crest is a swelling of the nasal, which is often termed differently.|$|E

5|$|VP4 is on {{the surface}} of the virion that <b>protrudes</b> as a spike. It binds to {{molecules}} {{on the surface of}} cells called receptors and drives the entry of the virus into the cell. VP4 has to be modified by the protease enzyme trypsin, which is found in the gut, into VP5* and VP8* before the virus is infectious. VP4 determines how virulent the virus is and it determines the P-type of the virus.|$|E
5|$|The {{clitoral}} hood {{projects at}} the front of the labia commissure, where the edges of the labia majora (outer lips) meet at the base of the pubic mound; it forms as part of the external folds of the labia minora (inner lips) and covers the glans and external shaft. There is considerable variation in how much of the glans <b>protrudes</b> from the hood and how much is covered by it, ranging from completely covered to fully exposed, and tissue of the labia minora also encircles the base of the glans.|$|E
5|$|The husband, whose stained hands reveal he is a dyer by trade, looks harried as {{he carries}} his {{exhausted}} youngest daughter. In earlier impressions (and the painting), {{his hands are}} blue, to show his occupation, while his wife's face is coloured with red ink. The placement of the cow's horns behind his head represents him as a cuckold and suggests the children are not his. Behind the couple, their children replay the scene: the father's cane <b>protrudes</b> between the son's legs, doubling as a hobby horse, while the daughter is clearly in charge, demanding that he hand over his gingerbread. A limited number of proofs missing the girl and artist's signature were printed; Hogarth added the mocking girl to explain the boy's tears.|$|E

5000|$|There are {{two types}} of vowel rounding: {{protrusion}} and compression. In <b>protruded</b> rounding, the corners of the mouth are drawn together and the lips <b>protrude</b> like a tube, with their inner surface visible. In compressed rounding, the corners of the mouth are drawn together, but the lips are also drawn together horizontally ("compressed") and do not <b>protrude,</b> with only their outer surface visible. That is, in <b>protruded</b> vowels the inner surfaces of the lips form the opening (thus the alternate term endolabial), whereas in compressed vowels it is the margins of the lips which form the opening (thus exolabial). [...] observes that back and central rounded vowels, such as German [...] and , are typically <b>protruded,</b> whereas front rounded vowels such as German [...] and [...] are typically compressed. Back or central compressed vowels and front <b>protruded</b> vowels are uncommon, and a contrast between the two types {{has been found to be}} phonemic in only one instance.|$|R
5|$|The pinna {{consists}} of the curving outer rim called the helix, the inner curved rim called the antihelix, and opens into the ear canal. The tragus <b>protrudes</b> and partially obscures the ear canal, as does the facing antitragus. The hollow region {{in front of the}} ear canal is called the concha. The ear canal stretches for about 1inch (2.5cm). The first part of the canal is surrounded by cartilage, while the second part near the eardrum is surrounded by bone. This bony part is known as the auditory bulla and is formed by the tympanic part of the temporal bone. The skin surrounding the ear canal contains ceruminous and sebaceous glands that produce protective ear wax. The ear canal ends at the external surface of the eardrum.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the species}} in the {{freshwater}} mussel family, Unionidae, commonly known as pocketbook mussels, have evolved an unusual reproductive strategy. The female's mantle <b>protrudes</b> from the shell and develops into an imitation small fish, complete with fish-like markings and false eyes. This decoy moves in the current and attracts the attention of real fish. Some fish see the decoy as prey, while others see a conspecific. They approach {{for a closer look}} and the mussel releases huge numbers of larvae from its gills, dousing the inquisitive fish with its tiny, parasitic young. These glochidia larvae are drawn into the fish's gills, where they attach and trigger a tissue response that forms a small cyst around each larva. The larvae then feed by breaking down and digesting the tissue of the fish within the cysts. After a few weeks they release themselves from the cysts and fall to the stream bed as juvenile molluscs. The fish are relatively unharmed.|$|E
5|$|The {{deepwater}} stingray has a flabby body, with enlarged pectoral fins {{forming a}} disc usually {{longer than it}} is wide. The leading margins of the disc converge at a broad angle. The snout is thin and measures over six times {{as long as the}} diameter of the orbit; the snout tip <b>protrudes</b> slightly from the disc. The small eyes are positioned just ahead of the spiracles, which have angular posterior rims. The large, circular nostrils are placed close to the mouth, to which they are connected by a pair of broad grooves. Between the nostrils is a broad curtain of skin with a strongly fringed posterior margin. The wide, straight mouth contains 32â€“60 tooth rows in either jaw, increasing in number with age. Each tooth is small with a low, blunt cusp; in adult males the teeth at the center are sharp and backward-pointing. The five pairs of gill slits are small and placed beneath the disc.|$|E
40|$|Management of <b>protruding</b> premaxilla is an {{important}} aspect of treatment of bilateral cleft lip. Surgical setback, which is considered as the last option in the management of grossly <b>protruded</b> premaxilla has {{an important}} role to play in selected cases. The present case had a grossly <b>protruded,</b> bulky premaxilla, which remained <b>protruded</b> even after 3 year following bilateral cleft lip repair. After failure to achieve expansion of maxillary arches by prosthodontic treatment for six month, patient was taken up for surgical setback. In view of the gross disparity between size of the <b>protruding</b> premaxilla and anterior gap between maxillary arches, conventional setback procedure {{would not have been possible}} and hence the patient underwent a bulk reduction procedure of premaxilla followed by the setback procedure. At the end of 6 weeks after surgery the premaxilla was stable...|$|R

50|$|Diagnosis: Teleoconch is {{with some}} white {{papillae}} {{on the initial}} whorls only, following whorls rather glossy, without any riblets. Parietal side of the apertural border is <b>protruding.</b> Lamella columellaris is somewhat <b>protruding</b> into the aperture.|$|R
5|$|The guide-wheel, which <b>protrudes</b> {{just ahead}} of the front wheels, is the most {{important}} part of the bus when travelling on the O-Bahn. It is connected directly to the steering mechanism, and steers the bus by running along the raised edge of the track. While it is not strictly necessary for drivers to hold the steering wheel when travelling on the O-Bahn because of the guide-wheel, safety procedures require the driver to be alert to their circumstances at all times. A rumble strip before stations is a reminder that they need to resume control. The guide-wheel is the most delicate part of the system and is designed to snap off upon sharp impact; before the O-Bahn was in place, a number of buses were fitted with guide-wheels for their ordinary routes to test their durability. Drivers were forced to be more cautious on their normal trips after numerous guide-wheel-to-kerb impacts.|$|E
5|$|The sparsely-spotted {{stingray}} {{has a more}} or less diamond-shaped {{pectoral fin}} disc wider than long, with rounded outer corners. The anterior margins of the disc are nearly straight and converge at an obtuse angle on the fleshy snout, the tip of which barely <b>protrudes</b> from the disc. The small eyes are immediately followed by comma-shaped spiracles with angular or rounded posterior rims. The outer rim of each nostril is enlarged into a knob towards the back. Between the nostrils is a bell-shaped curtain of skin with a finely fringed trailing margin; only the Kapala stingaree (U.kapalensis) has a similarly shaped nasal curtain. The small mouth contains five or six papillae (nipple-like structures) on the floor, most of which have forked tips. Additional small papillae are present {{on the outside of the}} lower jaw. The teeth in both jaws are small with roughly oval bases, and are arranged in a quincunx pattern. The five pairs of gill slits are short. The pelvic fins are small and rounded.|$|E
5|$|To {{either side}} of the {{pedestal}} are matching panels onto which are inscribed the names of the village's war dead. At the same height are flanking walls of coarsed, squared rubble from the nearby Doulting Stone Quarry, set back at the ends and topped with a yew hedge. In front of each wall is a small stone bench that <b>protrudes</b> across the base of the column, and above the benches, fixed to the wall, are round plaques bearing the dates of the Second World War and the names of the village's dead from that conflict. The statue and the inscriptions are both the work of Eric Gill, who also carved the memorial to Raymond Asquith. Colin Amery, who chaired an exhibition of Lutyens' works after his death, describes the memorials at Mells as among Lutyens' finest.|$|E

5|$|Aquatic life ties North American river otters almost {{exclusively}} to permanent watersheds. The river otters favor bog lakes with banked shores containing semiaquatic mammal burrows and lakes with beaver lodges. The otters avoid water bodies with gradually sloping shorelines of sand or gravel. In Maine, use of watersheds by river otters is negatively associated with the proportion of mixed hardwood-softwood stands in forested areas adjacent to waterways. However, it is positively associated {{with the number of}} beaver flowages, watershed length, and average shoreline diversity. In Idaho, river otters prefer valley habitats over mountainous terrain, and they select valley streams over valley lakes, reservoirs, and ponds. Log jams are heavily used when present. In Florida, inhabitation of North American river otters is lowest in freshwater marshes, intermediate in salt marshes, and highest in swamp forests. During the dry season, they will recede from the marshland and move to permanent ponds, where water is available and food is in greater supply. In Idaho and Massachusetts, ecological elements preferred for latrine sites include large conifers, points of land, beaver bank dens and lodges, isthmuses, mouths of permanent streams, or any object that <b>protrudes</b> from the water.|$|E
5|$|Krueger flap and Natural Laminar Flow Insect Mitigation Test Program â€“ Boeing {{commenced}} {{a series}} of test flights on 17 March 2015 with a modified Boeing 757, incorporating new wing-leading-edge sections and an actively blown vertical tail. The left wing has been modified to include a 6.7 m-span glove section supporting a variable-camber Krueger flap which will be deployed during landing and which <b>protrudes</b> {{just ahead of the}} leading edge. Although Krueger flaps have been tried before as insect-mitigation screens, previous designs caused additional drag; the newer design being tested is variable-camber and designed to retract as seamlessly as possible into the lower wing surface. Increasing the use of natural laminar flow (NLF) on an aircraft wing has the potential to improve fuel burn by as much as 15%, but even small contaminants from insect remains will trip the flow from laminar to turbulent, destroying the performance benefit. The test flights have been supported by the European airline group TUI AG and conducted jointly with NASA as part of the agencyâ€™s Environmentally Responsible Aviation (ERA) program. While the left wing tests the Kreuger flaps, the right wing is being used to test coatings that prevent insects from adhering to the wing. Success here will {{open the door to the}} application of Natural Laminar Flow to reduce fuel burn.|$|E
5|$|The Eastern small footed bat {{is between}} 65 and 95millimeters in length, has a {{wingspan}} of 210 to 250millimeters, and weighs between 4 and 8grams. The bat {{got its name}} from its abnormally small hind feet, which are only 7 to 8 millimeters long. The fur on the dorsal side of their body is dark at the roots, and fades to a light brown at the tips, which gives the bats a signature shiny, yellow-brown appearance. The fur on the dorsal {{side of the body}} is a dull gray color, which is believed to help camouflage themselves in their hibernacula. The defining characteristic of this bat is its face-mask, which is completely black. They also have black ears, wings and interfemoral membrane, (the membrane between the legs and tail). Like all bats, the Eastern small-footed bat has a patagium that connects the body to the forelimbs and tail, allowing the animal to fly. Their head is very flat and short, with a forehead that slopes gradually away from the rostrum, a feature that is unique to other individuals in the Myotis species. They have erect ears, which are very broad at the base and a short flat nose. They have a keeled calcar (protruding cartridge on the hind legs to support the interfemoral membrane) as well as a pointed tragus Their tail is between 25-45 millimeters in length and <b>protrudes</b> past their interfemoral membrane, and they have a dental formula of 2/3, 1/1, 3/3, 3/3.|$|E

5|$|The {{leopard shark}} captures prey by {{expanding}} its buccal cavity {{to create a}} suction force, which is facilitated by its labial cartilages swinging forward to form the mouth into a tube. Simultaneously, the shark <b>protrudes</b> its jaws forward to grip the prey between its teeth. As with other sharks, {{the teeth of the}} leopard shark are periodically shed and replaced; it takes 9ndash&12 days for a replacement tooth to move into position. Leopard sharks have been caught with stomachs filled with clam siphons, which the sharks seize before the clams can retract and break off with a levering motion of their bodies. On occasion, the shark tears the entire clam body out of its shell this way. Other sharks examined have had stomachs containing whole innkeeper worms with no bite marks, suggesting that the sharks sucked them out of their burrows. Under a hollow bridge support in San Francisco Bay, a group of leopard sharks and spiny dogfish have been observed feeding on a dense school of anchovies by slowly swimming counterclockwise through the clockwise-swimming school, and swallowing any anchovies that accidentally entered their open mouths.|$|E
5|$|Verbinski did {{not want}} an entirely romanticized feel to the film: he wanted a sense of {{historical}} fantasy. Most of the actors wore prosthetics and contact lenses. Depp had contacts that acted as sunglasses, while Rush and Lee Arenberg wore dulled contacts that gave a sinister feel to the characters. Mackenzie Crook wore two contacts to represent his character's wooden eye: a soft version, and a harder version for when it <b>protrudes.</b> In addition, their rotten teeth and scurvy skin were dyed on, although Depp did have gold teeth added, which he forgot to remove after filming. Depp also used a genuine pistol which was made in 1760 in London, which the crew bought from a dealer in Connecticut. A number of swords were built for the production by blacksmith Tony Swatton. The crew spent five months creating the cavern in which Barbossa and the Black Pearl crew attempt to reverse their curse, filling it with five feet of water, 882 Aztec coins, and some gold paint on the styrofoam rocks for more impressions of treasure. The crew also built the fortress at Port Royal in Rancho Palos Verdes, California, and Governor Swann's palace was built at Manhattan Beach. A fire broke out in September 2002, causing $525,000 worth of damage, though no one was injured.|$|E
5|$|The Charles Payne House is a -story Gothic-Italianate vernacular cottage {{that has}} a spacious garden founded {{on the site of}} a long-removed house. The house's gable end faces the street with a rear ell and the other ell {{perpendicular}} to the main block on the west side. Centered on the east end of the roof is a cross gable which is visually offset by the dormer on the west. The house has a small gable-roofed vestibule on the east side, aligned underneath the cross-gable. The rear ell has an attached porch that spans its length. A single story bay hexagonal bay window <b>protrudes</b> from the facade. The distinguishing feature of the Payne house is the wood trim exterior, consisting of hood mould on the paired windows on the south, four kinds of bargeboards and bracketed cornices on the rear ell's east side. The interior of the Charles Payne House is not covered in detail by any survey, but has three mantelpieces on the first floor, two displaying Gothic Revival influence in their wooden designs and the third, located in the rear ell, made of grey marble with a round-head opening. Though not mentioned in the nomination, a photo shows one of the wooden mantlepieces filled with brick and rendered unusable at the time. The setting of the house was important to the National Register nomination, which specifically highlighted its shaded garden and fencing. At the time of the nomination, an ornamental round head picket fence surrounded the property and access was through a double-leaf lattice work gate. By 2013, the picket fence and entrance gate had been removed, but the property still retains the street frontage for its garden.|$|E
40|$|The present {{invention}} {{relates to}} {{a method for}} fixation of a first movable component (4) of a micro-mechanical structural element to a stationary or moving second component (5) of the structural element, wherein a lateral surface of the first component and a lateral surface of the second component face one another. In the method, a layer (10) <b>protruding</b> from the lateral surface is produced on a side of one or both components (4, 5) adjoining the lateral surface. The movable first component is moved (4) for fixation against the second component (5) {{in such a manner}} that the <b>protruding</b> layer area slides {{over the side of the}} first or second component (4, 5) adjoining the lateral side or, in the case of a <b>protruding</b> layer (10) present on both components (4, 5), the <b>protruding</b> layer areas slide one over another such that, due to static friction, the <b>protruding</b> layer area (10) adheres to the component (4, 5) thereunder, or the <b>protruding</b> layer areas adhere to one another.

40|$|<b>Protruding</b> ureterocele is a {{very rare}} case found in the literature. We are {{reporting}} a 21 year-old female with an intermittent <b>protruding</b> mass from urethra, accompanied by dysuria, hematuria, and recurrent urinary tract infection. Inspection of the external genitalia revealed a <b>protruding</b> mass from the urethra which could be reduced manually. Excretory urography showed bilateral single collecting systems, grade II hydronephrosis of the right kidney, and a cobra head appearance of the lower right pelvis. The patient {{was diagnosed with a}} <b>protruding</b> right ureterocele in a single collecting system, and thus, endoscopic incision of a ureterocele was performed. Ultrasonography which was carried out three weeks after the procedure confirmed no residual hydronephrosis or ureterocele in the bladder. Voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) underwent at a three-month-follow up revealed a grade 5 vesico-ureteral reflux (VUR) on the right side. Surgical reimplantation was then considered. In conclusion, endoscopic incision was safe and yielded good result for <b>protruding</b> ureteroceles, but the need for secondary surgery in several conditions should be considered...|$|R
