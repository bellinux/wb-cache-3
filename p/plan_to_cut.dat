Portland Science Advocates {{organized}} the march in support of science and to protest President Donald Trump's <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> funding for the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Institutes of Health.

5|$|Collins {{discussed}} the possible {{use of nuclear}} weapons in Korea with MacArthur in December, and later asked him for a list of targets in the Soviet Union in case it entered the war. MacArthur testified before the Congress in 1951 that he had never recommended the {{use of nuclear weapons}}. He did at one point consider a <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> off North Korea with radioactive poisons; he did not recommend it at the time, although he later broached the matter with Eisenhower, then president-elect, in 1952. In 1954, in an interview published after his death, he stated he had wanted to drop atomic bombs on enemy bases, but in 1960, he challenged a statement by Truman that he had advocated using atomic bombs. Truman issued a retraction, stating that he had no evidence of the claim; it was merely his personal opinion.|$|E

5|$|The British camp in Balaclava {{was on a}} plateau, {{with two}} {{approaches}} – the South and North valleys – and a small hill, known as the Causeway Heights, between them. At Balaclava, the force waited for supplies while the allied ships bombarded the forts surrounding Sevastopol, starting on 17 October. The forts proved to be particularly strong, but some damage was caused and Admiral Kornilov killed. From then on, time and time again, the allied navy would bombard the forts, causing damage, which the Russians would then repair each night. While the allied armies waited to strengthen their positions and increase their resources, Prince Menshikov, commander of the Russian forces, had a desire to provide a victory to the Tsar following his defeat at Alma. He formed a <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> the British army off from the harbour at Balaclava, with a secondary objective of capturing the harbour itself. The Russian forces assembled on 24 October, and attacked at around 7am on the 25th. General Gribbe covered the Russian left flank, with Semiakin, Levoutsky and Scudery on his right: General Ryzhov waited behind them, prepared to support any individual force that came under trouble. The Turkish forces in the first redoubts were quickly overwhelmed and forced to flee.|$|E

The State Appointed Receiver, Francis Barnes, had sought court approval of a plan which partially addressed a $23.8 million shortfall. The District lost the appeal. Local charter schools educate more than forty percent of the children living in the attendance zone of the Chester Upland School District.

25|$|Following the Fall of France in June 1940, Hermann Göring advised Adolf Hitler {{to occupy}} Spain and North Africa rather than invade the UK.

Guderian even urged Hitler {{to postpone the}} armistice {{so that he could}} rush on through Spain with two Panzer divisions, take Gibraltar, and then invade French North Africa. General Alfred Jodl, Chief of Staff of Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (OKW) operations, presented Hitler with a formal <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> off Britain from its eastern empire by invading Spain, Gibraltar, North Africa, and the Suez Canal instead of invading the British Isles.|$|E
25|$|Three more {{residence}} halls will temporarily {{close in}} the Fall of 2017: Center, Responsibility, and Discovery. Previously {{it was announced that}} Respect, Excellence, Schurz and McDavid wouldn’t operate in the Fall unless there was sufficient demand to reopen some of them. Combined, the seven halls are capable of housing about 1,500 students. The closures are estimated to save about $2 million, largely through reduced utility costs. The university says two of the closed halls also could potentially get some use as guest and conference housing. The temporary closures come after freshman enrollment dropped 24 percent for this academic year. The declining enrollment precipitated a budget <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> 400 jobs, but most of them are from those resigning or retiring, so less than 100 actual jobs will be eliminated for the 2018 fiscal year.|$|E

25|$|The Hermione was {{a former}} frigate of the Royal Navy, {{commanded}} by Captain Hugh Pigot. In September 1797 {{a number of the}} crew had risen up against the apparently tyrannical Pigot and had murdered him and nine other officers, throwing their bodies overboard. Fearing retribution for their actions, the mutineers had sailed the Hermione to the Spanish port of La Guaira, and handed her over to the authorities. When news of the mutiny reached Parker, he demanded the return of the ship and the surrender of the mutineers, instigating a process that would eventually see the apprehending of 33 of them. The Hermione meanwhile had been renamed Santa Cecilia, but remained in port. News eventually reached Parker that the Santa Cecilia had been sighted in Puerto Cabello, and ordered the Surprise to intercept her, should she attempt to put to sea. Hamilton decided that the honour of the Royal Navy depended on the recovery of the ship, and was determined to retake her. Anchoring near the port he devised a <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> her out of the harbour and asked for a boat and an extra 20 men from Parker.

Prior to the march, Waltman and Wirz wrote a guest column in The Oregonian, where they noted Oregon's achievements in science, and encouraged people to [...] "stand up for science".

On 11 December, the BBC reported that the Treasury had wanted a tougher approach to public spending to lend credibility to its <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> the deficit, but that Brown had over-ruled it following an aggressive campaign for a real-terms increase in education spending by Schools Minister Ed Balls.

500|$|Defence cuts {{announced}} in March 2003 {{resulted in the}} decision to retire 90 Tornados from Luftwaffe service. This led to a reduction in its Tornado strength to four wings by September 2005. On 13 January 2004, the then German Defence Minister Peter Struck announced further major changes to the German armed forces. A major part of this announcement is the <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> the German fighter fleet from 426 in early 2004 to 265 by 2015. The German Tornado force is to be reduced to 85, with the type expected to remain in service with the Luftwaffe until 2025. The aircraft being retained have been undergoing a service life extension programme. Currently, the Luftwaffe operates Tornados with Tactical Wings Taktisches Luftwaffengeschwader 33 in Cochem / Büchel Air Base, Rhineland-Palatinate and with Taktisches Luftwaffengeschwader 51 [...] "Immelmann" [...] in Jagel, Schleswig-Holstein.

500|$|In January 2008, Stelmach {{unveiled}} the province's [...] "made in Alberta"—as distinct from {{imposed by the}} federal government or by international treaty—plan to cut carbon emissions in order to fight global warming. [...] The plan called for reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 14% (from 2007 levels) by 2050. Environmental groups and opposition parties suggested that this was insufficient in light of British Columbia's <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> emissions by 80% (from 2007 levels) during the same period, but Stelmach argued that Alberta's position as a supplier of oil {{to the rest of the}} country justified higher emissions. This was followed in June by the unveiling of the government's campaign to ask Albertans to make [...] "one simple act"—such as composting, using reusable shopping bags, and replacing incandescent light bulbs with the more efficient fluorescent bulbs. Opponents argued that the emphasis on personal responsibility by individuals did nothing to address the greater environmental damage caused by the development of the Athabasca Oil Sands.|$|E

Charles pressed the left wing of the French army and hurled his men towards the III Corps of Marshal Davout. In response, Napoleon came up with a <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> off the Austrians in the celebrated Landshut Maneuver.
