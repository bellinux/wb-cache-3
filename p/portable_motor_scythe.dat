40|$|An {{extensive}} {{review of}} the literature is given of- nine possible methods for estimating herbage intake by grazing ruminants, with special attention to the sward-cutting and indirect animal methods- the factors determining the herbage intake by grazing ruminants. The herbage intake of lactating cows was determined in 151 trials at Lelystad from 1976 to 1979. The pre-cut swards consisted predominantly of perennial ryegrass. A swardsampling technique was used for estimating herbage intake by cows grazing swards for 3 or 4 days (with corrections for herbage accumulation during grazing). If herbage samples were cut both with a <b>motor</b> <b>scythe</b> and a lawn~mower accurate intake figures could be obtained. It was shown that there were no significant effects of higher levels of areic mass of herbage (by taking longer rest periods) on daily organic matter intake of herbage neither by grazing nor by stall-fed cows. However in early summer daily intake of nutrients and milk production decreased at increasing maturity; in late summer these effects were not significant. Higher levels of daily herbage allowance had significant positive effects on daily intake of organic matter of nutrients from herbage and ondaily milk production per grazing animal. High amounts of residual herbage (achieved by higher levels of daily herbage allowance) increased net regrowth of herbage, especially in early summer. At a mean allowance level of 23 kg d - 1 above 4. 5 cm our grazing cows consumed 13. 6 - 14. 8 kg d - 1 of organic matter if no concentrates were fed. This was sufficient, at the quality of herbage as in our trials, for a daily 4 %-fat corrected milk production of 22 - 23 kg...|$|R
40|$|The ‘Conseil Général du Département du Nord’ is {{the manager}} of 480 ha of Flemish dunes located at the far North of France. These spaces, {{initially}} preserved {{by the action of}} the ‘Communauté Urbaine de Dunkerque’ are now the property of the ‘Conservatoire de l’Espace Littoral et des Rivages Lacustres’. Characterised by an aelian dynamism and by the winter flooding of their damp depressions, these systems had represented a very high patrimonial richness before man, by these actions (the pumping of the aquifers, the parcelling out of dune massifs, the fixation of sand by plantations, the destruction of rabbits), reduced to nothing the natural expression of perturbations (storms, floods, important sandbanks) and made dune massifs become wastelands and low marshes and dry lawns disappear. The first step for preservation was the in extremis safeguard and the maintenance by secateurs (1989) then by <b>motor</b> <b>scythes</b> (1992) of micro-habitats with a high richness over a 2 ha total surface lost in very important pre-forested systems. Rapidly, the objectives of preservation obliged us to put into practice the restoration of natural environments by stripping and clearing the ground (1994 and 1997). But these operations of a large scale (10 ha) were always based on a ‘fixist’ and ‘museographical’ approach to the environment (the maintenance of a representative sample of habitats). The management which consists of stopping certain pioneer and post-pioneer stages of vegetation can in fact correspond to a counter-natural step as these dune systems make the proof of a very high dynamism and permanent evolution. Today the management of dune space is done by bulldozers: first the pre-forested vegetation is totally destructed (16 ha in 2004) leaving systems of bare sand freely evolving and accepting their spontaneous wastelanding over more than 50 % of their surfaces. The return to uncontrolled vegetal dynamism is only accepted if perturbations are periodically created in order to regularly produce the starting or reappearance conditions of the different series of vegetation. The last stage of our managing operations would consist, with a middle-term effect, in reducing the stability of the edging dune row and in favouring the development of wind passages with their devastation or saving effects on the dune we intend to preserve...|$|R

40|$|Most motor {{learning}} {{experiments have}} been conducted in a laboratory setting. In this type of setting, a huge and expensive manipulandum is frequently used, requiring a large budget and wide open space. Subjects also need {{to travel to the}} laboratory, which is a burden for them. This burden is particularly severe for patients with neurological disorders. Here, we describe the development of a novel application based on Unity 3 D and smart devices, e. g., smartphones or tablet devices, {{that can be used to}} conduct motor learning experiments at any time and in any place, without requiring a large budget and wide open space and without the burden of travel on subjects. We refer to our application as <b>POrtable</b> <b>Motor</b> learning LABoratory, or PoMLab. PoMLab is a multiplatform application that is available and sharable for free. We investigated whether PoMLab could be an alternative to the laboratory setting using a visuomotor rotation paradigm that causes sensory prediction error, enabling the investigation of how subjects minimize the error. In the first experiment, subjects could adapt to a constant visuomotor rotation that was abruptly applied at a specific trial. The learning curve for the first experiment could be modeled well using a state space model, a mathematical model that describes the motor leaning process. In the second experiment, subjects could adapt to a visuomotor rotation that gradually increased each trial. The subjects adapted to the gradually increasing visuomotor rotation without being aware of the visuomotor rotation. These experimental results have been reported for conventional experiments conducted in a laboratory setting, and our PoMLab application could reproduce these results. PoMLab can thus be considered an alternative to the laboratory setting. We also conducted follow-up experiments in university physical education classes. A state space model that was fit to the data obtained in the laboratory experiments could predict the learning curves obtained in the follow-up experiments. Further, we investigated the influence of vibration function, weight, and screen size on learning curves. Finally, we compared the learning curves obtained in the PoMLab experiments to those obtained in the conventional reaching experiments. The results of the in-class experiments show that PoMLab can be used to conduct motor learning experiments at any time and place...|$|R

50|$|Propane is {{generally}} stored and transported in steel cylinders as a liquid with a vapor space above the liquid. The vapor {{pressure in the}} cylinder {{is a function of}} temperature. When gaseous propane is drawn at a high rate, the latent heat of vaporisation required to create the gas will cause the bottle to cool. (This is why water often condenses {{on the sides of the}} bottle and then freezes). In addition, the lightweight, high-octane compounds vaporize before the heavier, low-octane ones. Thus, the ignition properties change as the cylinder empties. For these reasons, the liquid is often withdrawn using a dip tube. Propane is used as fuel in furnaces for heat, in cooking, as an energy source for water heaters, laundry dryers, barbecues, <b>portable</b> stoves, and <b>motor</b> vehicles.|$|R

The TEM observation showed the unique morphology of Li 2 MnSiO 4 particles with only 10 – 20 nm in size surrounded by carbon phase, which can contribute to a short diffusion path of Li+ ions and the easy relaxation of structural distortion through the delithiation/lithiation. The XRD, XANES, and EXAFS studies of the charged/discharged structures revealed that the long-range order of Li 2 MnSiO 4 structure was destroyed by charge/discharge cycles but the local structure around Mn 2 + cation was kept unchanged. © 2013 The Electrochemical Society.

40|$|Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is {{a system}} {{empowering}} humans to communicate with or control the outside world with exclusively brain intentions. Electroencephalography (EEG) based BCIs are promising solutions due to their convenient and <b>portable</b> instruments. <b>Motor</b> imagery EEG (MI-EEG) {{is a kind of}} most widely focused EEG signals, which reveals a subjects movement intentions without actual actions. Despite the extensive research of MI-EEG in recent years, it is still challenging to interpret EEG signals effectively due to the massive noises in EEG signals (e. g., low signal noise ratio and incomplete EEG signals), and difficulties in capturing the inconspicuous relationships between EEG signals and certain brain activities. Most existing works either only consider EEG as chain-like sequences neglecting complex dependencies between adjacent signals or performing simple temporal averaging over EEG sequences. In this paper, we introduce both cascade and parallel convolutional recurrent neural network models for precisely identifying human intended movements by effectively learning compositional spatio-temporal representations of raw EEG streams. The proposed models grasp the spatial correlations between physically neighboring EEG signals by converting the chain like EEG sequences into a 2 D mesh like hierarchy. An LSTM based recurrent network is able to extract the subtle temporal dependencies of EEG data streams. Extensive experiments on a large-scale MI-EEG dataset (108 subjects, 3, 145, 160 EEG records) have demonstrated that both models achieve high accuracy near 98. 3 % and outperform a set of baseline methods and most recent deep learning based EEG recognition models, yielding a significant accuracy increase of 18 % in the cross-subject validation scenario.

50|$|An {{electric}} motor uses electrical energy to produce mechanical energy, usually through {{the interaction of}} magnetic fields and current-carrying conductors. The reverse process, producing electrical energy from mechanical energy, is accomplished by a generator or dynamo. Traction motors used on vehicles often perform both tasks. Electric motors can be run as generators and vice versa, although {{this is not always}} practical.Electric motors are ubiquitous, being found in applications as diverse as industrial fans, blowers and pumps, machine tools, household appliances, power tools, and disk drives. They may be powered by direct current (for example a battery powered <b>portable</b> device or <b>motor</b> vehicle), or by alternating current from a central electrical distribution grid. The smallest motors may be found in electric wristwatches. Medium-size motors of highly standardized dimensions and characteristics provide convenient mechanical power for industrial uses. The very largest {{electric motor}}s are used for propulsion of large ships, and for such purposes as pipeline compressors, with ratings in the thousands of kilowatts.

Second, the maximum earthquake displacement can not be larger than the table. s displacement capacity. In the present work, the recorded strong motion acceleration time series are processed in order to obtain useful data for engineering analysis. Strong motion accelerogram processing (earthquake data processing) is performed in Scilab. The objectives of strong motion data processing are corrections for the response of the strong motion instrument itself, and reduction of random noise in the recorded signals. The processing concentrates on the lowfrequency ranges of the usable signal in the records. The results obtained from comparison of the present work's outputs and some data providers' outputs are satisfactory. Some slight differences exist due to the different integration schemes and due to the application of different filter orders, zero-padding, and different filters for instance, acausal or causal Butterworth filter.

40|$|Introduction: Objective, <b>portable</b> {{measures}} of <b>motor</b> function for out-of-office assessments {{are needed in}} Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 s Disease (PD). This study had 3 objectives. First, to examine change in objective motor measurements in PD (as assessed with the Objective PD Measurement (OPDM) system). Second, to correlate objective measures with clinical features and putative PD cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and dopaminergic imaging biomarkers. Third, to assess participant compliance with and perceptions of serial in-home motor assessments. Methods: De novo PD subjects participating in this pilot study of the Parkinson Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) completed OPDM assessments at home weekly for 3 months and in the clinic at baseline and 3 -, 6 -, and 12 -months. Tasks included (i) digitography (ii) a repetitive hand tapping task and (iii) timed pegboard task. A global objective motor score (OMS) {{was derived from the}} latter three. MDS-UPDRS-III score was obtained at each time point, and CSF and dopamine transporter (DAT) SPECT at baseline. Results: 27 participants, mean age 62. 6 years, 19 male were included. A mean of 10. 5 in-home assessments were completed. There was no significant change in in-home OMS over 12 weeks (p = 0. 48). There was strong correlation between mean baseline OMS and MDS-UPDRS-III scores (spearman 2 ̆ 7 s rho = 0. 60, p= 3 ̆c 0. 0001). Baseline OMS predicted 6 -month MDS-UPDRS-III (β = 0. 80, p = 0. 0002) but not change in MDS-UPDRS-III score, DAT SPECT, or putative CSF biomarkers. Conclusions: This study suggests that administration of in-home motor tasks as part of a large multi-center study is feasible and scores derived from these assessments may serve as surrogates of in-person clinician-assessed motor score...|$|R
