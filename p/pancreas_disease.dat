50|$|The rising {{temperatures}} are having direct impacts on freshwater and wetlands biodiversity. Atlantic salmon is a keystone species in rivers {{along the coast}} of Norway. Salmon have an upper temperature limit in the twenties so future warming may make it increasingly difficult to maintain current population levels. Higher initial temperatures could lead to increased growth and production in the short-term but ultimately there could be a massive collapse if warming trends continue. This has been made evident by the recent decline in mean individual mass and annual mean length of the fish. It is suggested that the size change of Atlantic salmon is made by the collapse and rebuilding of the pelagic fish abundance in the North Atlantic Ocean, a gradual decrease in zooplankton abundance and climate change. It could also promote genetic abnormalities and the spread of disease such as <b>Pancreas</b> <b>Disease</b> (PD) and Infectious Salmon Anemia Virus (ISA). Furthermore, lake and river surface water {{temperatures are}} projected to increase further, resulting in a longer summer stratification period and more cyanobacterial blooms. Furthermore, both the Atlantic salmon and the Arctic charr have experienced changes in abundance. Whilst both species coexist it has been the Arctic charr who seems to be more vulnerable to environmental changes, hence leading to its overall decline in numbers.|$|E
40|$|This {{publication}} {{constitutes the}} final report for the research project ST/ 05 / 01 “Site investigations and disease management of the <b>pancreas</b> <b>disease</b> virus in Irish farmed salmon”, funded under the NDP Marine RTDI Programme. Work undertaken within the project included longitudinal studies of rainbow trout and Atlantic salmon at sea following the course of infection, testing for vectors and reservoirs of the virus, molecular studies of the virus and an epidemiological investigation of <b>pancreas</b> <b>disease</b> in Ireland. Results have shown that although <b>pancreas</b> <b>disease</b> is endemic in marine farmed Atlantic salmon, no evidence of infection in rainbow trout farmed at sea was found. Serological and molecular based diagnostic methods were shown to be suitable for the screening of fish stocks {{for the presence of}} the virus. For the confirmation of clinical outbreaks, farm data and histopathological results should be included. The results also suggest that horizontal transmission of the virus may be the main route of infection between sites. The project also involved the technology transfer of molecular and serological diagnostic methods for <b>pancreas</b> <b>disease</b> between partners and the final chapter includes practical information on management of, and mitigation against, <b>pancreas</b> <b>disease.</b> Pathologies such as <b>pancreas</b> <b>disease,</b> heart and skeletal muscle inflammation and cardiomyopathy syndrome, pose a serious threat to salmonid farming in Ireland, Scotland and Norway. Most significant among this group of diseases is <b>pancreas</b> <b>disease,</b> a viral disease affecting Atlantic salmon during the marine stage of the production cycle. From the first description of <b>pancreas</b> <b>disease</b> in farmed Atlantic salmon from Scotland in 1976 the disease has now become endemic in Ireland and parts of Norway and continues to be significant in Scotland. The causal agent of <b>pancreas</b> <b>disease,</b> a salmonid alphavirus, has now been characterised and a closely related subtype of the virus is known to cause sleeping disease in farmed rainbow trout on continental Europe and in the United Kingdom. The Irish salmon farming industry has estimated that <b>pancreas</b> <b>disease</b> has resulted in a total loss of turnover of € 35 million with € 12 million loss of profit in the years 2003 - 2004. The economic impacts are estimated to be in the range of € 100 million per year in Norway.

Six subtypes of SAV have so far been reported where SAV subtype 3 and a marine variant of subtype 2 is found in Norway. Currently one commercial vaccine is available, but the effect under field conditions have been debated. Documentation of virulence characteristics and field oriented genome data have been scarce and this work was initiated to enlighten these subjects. Using a SAV 3 isolate cultured in both CHSE and AGK cell line, the thesis shows that adaptation to AGK cells results in an isolate with a higher replication efficiency and higher virulence in vitro, compared to CHSEadapted earlier passages.

40|$|<b>Pancreas</b> <b>Disease</b> is {{the most}} {{significant}} single infectious disease affecting marine salmon farms in Ireland. The first epidemiological studies of <b>Pancreas</b> <b>Disease</b> (PD) in Ireland in the early 1990 ’s indicated that significant losses occurred in farmed Atlantic salmon in their first year at sea on some individual farms (Menzies et al., 1996). A serological survey for the presence of Salmon <b>Pancreas</b> <b>Disease</b> Virus (SPDV) antibody in 1996 revealed that 53 % of Irish sites were positive, but that not all positive sites had recognised clinical signs of PD. This indicated a relatively low incidence and severity of PD at that time (McLoughlin et al., 1998) and this pattern persisted throughout the remainder of the 1990 ’s. In 2002, a serious increase in both the incidence and severity of PD was reported on farmed Atlantic salmon marine sites in Ireland. An epidemiological survey of Irish sites for 2002 revealed that 59 % of sites reported an outbreak of PD, with mortalities averaging 12 % (range 1 – 42 %; McLoughlin et al., 2003). A recent study using data collected for 2003 and 2004 indicated that PD occurred in 62 % and 86 % of sites respectively. The average mortality due to PD on affected farms was 18. 8 % in 2003 and 14. 8 % in 2004. In response to these significant losses due to PD a range of research initiatives was launched in Ireland and was supported by the Marine Institute. This document gives an overview of the most recent findings from the current projects, carried out in 2004 / 2005 and also provides an overview of the various actions in Scotland and Norway, where PD has also become a disease of economic significance in salmon aquaculture.

SAV infection in vivo is temperature-restricted and progeny virus is only produced at low temperatures (10 – 15 °C). Using engineered SAV replicons we show that viral RNA replication is not temperature-restricted suggesting that the viral structural proteins determine low-temperature dependency.

Finally, a vaccination-challenge model in Atlantic salmon demonstrates the biological significance of our findings and shows that SAV replicon DNA vaccines encoding E 2 elicit protective immunity only when E 1 is co-expressed.

40|$|<b>Pancreas</b> <b>disease</b> {{caused by}} salmonid alphavirus in farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) leads to high {{mortality}} rates post infection and histopathological lesions in several organs. As protection against <b>pancreas</b> <b>disease,</b> Novartis developed a prophylactic DNA plasmid-based vaccine {{to be administered}} to salmon as naked plasmid in a single intramuscular injection. In order to assess {{the legal status of}} the fish vaccinated with this new vaccine with regard to the legislation on genetically modified organisms, the European Commission suggested that the company carry out a scientific study on the integration/non-integration of the plasmid DNA into the fish genome. Subsequently, the European Commission requested EFSA to give scientific advice on the study design and the conclusions drawn by the company. PCR based analysis of genomic DNA from muscle samples, taken from at or around the injection site 436 days post vaccination, led the company to conclude that integration of plasmid DNA into the fish genome is extremely unlikely. After an assessment of the study, EFSA considers that the study presented by Novartis Animal Health on the integration/non-integration of DNA plasmid-based vaccine into the salmon genomic DNA provides insufficient information on the potential integration of plasmid DNA fragments into the fish genome due to a limited coverage of the plasmid DNA by the detection method provided, the limited number of samples analysed and an insufficient limit of detection and method validation. Therefore, EFSA is of the opinion that the results from the integration/non-integration study submitted by Novartis Animal Health are not sufficient to support the conclusion of non-integration of plasmid DNA into the fish genome drawn by the company...|$|E

Previous studies have linked growth factors to neural plasticity in neurocognitive impairment and mental disorders. In order to further clarify the impact of chronic alcohol consumption on circulating growth factors, a cross-sectional study was performed in abstinent AUD patients (alcohol group, N = 91) and healthy control subjects (control group, N = 55) to examine plasma concentrations of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), insulin-like growth factor- 1 (IGF- 1) and IGF- 1 binding protein- 3 (IGFBP- 3). The association of these plasma peptides with relevant AUD-related variables and psychiatric comorbidity was explored. The alcohol group was diagnosed with severe AUD and showed an average of 13 years of problematic use and 10 months of abstinence {{at the moment of}} participating in the study. Regarding common medical conditions associated with AUD, we observed an elevated incidence of alcohol-induced liver and <b>pancreas</b> <b>diseases</b> (18. 7 %) and psychiatric comorbidity (76. 9 %). Thus, AUD patients displayed a high prevalence of dual diagnosis (39. 3 %) [mainly depression (19. 9 %) ] and comorbid substance use disorders (40. 7 %). Plasma BDNF and IGF- 1 concentrations were significantly lower in the alcohol group than in the control group (p< 0. 001). Remarkably, there was a negative association between IGF- 1 concentrations and age in the control group (r = - 0. 52, p< 0. 001) that was not found in the alcohol group. Concerning AUD-related variables, AUD patients with liver and <b>pancreas</b> <b>diseases</b> showed even lower concentrations of BDNF (p< 0. 05). In contrast, the changes in plasma concentrations of these peptides were not associated with abstinence, problematic use, AUD severity or lifetime psychiatric comorbidity.

Therefore, the susceptibility of triploid salmon to common infections such as salmonid alphavirus (SAV), the causative agent of <b>pancreas</b> <b>disease</b> (PD), requires investigation. In this study, shortly after seawater transfer, diploid and triploid post-smolts were exposed to SAV type 3 (SAV 3) using a bath challenge model where the infectious dose was 48 TCID 50 ml- 1 of tank water. Copy number analysis of SAV 3 RNA in heart tissue showed that there was no difference in viral loads between the diploids and triploids. Prevalence reached 100 % by the end of the 35 -day experimental period in both infected groups. However, prevalence accumulated more slowly in the triploid group reaching 19 % and 56 % at 14 and 21 days post exposure (dpe) respectively.

Highly significant differences in the severity of lesions in the pancreas at Day 21 post-infection (pi) were detected (p < 0. 01), with Group B being more severely affected. There were also significant differences in the prevalence and severity of lesions in heart and skeletal muscle at Day 21 and 35 pi respectively, with Group B results again significantly higher than those from both Groups A and C (p < 0. 05).

The purpose of our study was to establish the features of sonological and laboratory findings in children with nonalcoholic fatty <b>pancreas</b> <b>disease</b> depending on steatosis degree. Materials and methods. We observed 93 children aged 7 to 17 years, the average age was 11. 87 ± 2. 82 years. Degree of pancreatic steatosis was evaluated by ultrasonography. In order to determine pancreatic fibrosis and steatosis, shear wave elastography and steatometry (quantitative estimation of the ultrasound attenuation with determination of average ultrasound attenuation coefficient (UAC)) were performed using Ultima PA Expert apparatus (Radmir, Ukraine). Liver fibrosis and steatosis were diagnosed by means of Fibroscan 502 Touch (France) with controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) function. According to the presence of pancreatic steatosis, children were divided into the following groups: group 1 — 50 children with pancreatic steatosis and obesity/overweight; this group was divided into subgroups: S 1 subgroup — 20 children with degree 1 pancreatic steatosis, S 2 subgroup — 22 patients with d egree 2 pancreatic steatosis, S 3 — 8 children with degree 3 pancreatic steatosis; group 2 — 30 persons without pancreatic steatosis with obesity/overweight, group 3 — 13 children with normal weight. All patients and their parents agreed to participate in the study. We provided blood count with determination of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), liver function test (alanin aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGTP)) and test for serum amylase level. Insulin level was determined by immunoassay with calculation of HOMA-IR. Statistical analysis was performed using Statistica 7. 0 software by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by post hoc analysis. Results. Children with degree 3 pancreatic steatosis as compared to group 3 demonstrated higher level of ESR — by 1. 86 times (p = 0. 01), ALT — by 1. 86 times (p =  0. 006), AST — by 1. 96 times (p = 0. 00019), GGTP — by 2. 10 times (p = 0. 0001). We found that patients with pancreatic steatosis had higher level of insulin as compared to the control group (S 1 subgroup — 18. 38  ±  5. 07 μU/ml; S 2 subgroup — 30. 76 ± 3. 92 μU/ml; S 3 subgroup — 33. 70 ± 5. 37  μU/ml; group 2 — 18. 70 ±  2. 98 μU/ml; group 3 — 9. 480 ± 5. 067 μU/ml (p = 0. 00262)). Also, patients with pancreatic steatosis demonstrated higher level of HOMA index as compared to the control group (S 1 — 4. 04 ± 0. 87; S 2 — 7. 11 ±  0. 96; S 3 — 7. 99 ± 1. 35; group 2 — 3. 81 ± 0. 73; group 3 — 1. 94 ± 0. 92 (p = 0. 00156)). CAP level increased in patients with pancreatic steatosis (S 1 subgroup — 234. 50 ± 9. 94 dB/m; S 2 — 239. 05 ± 8. 99 dB/m; S 3 — 245. 33  ±  17. 21  dB/m; group 2 — 197. 87 ± 7. 70 dB/m; group 3 — 172. 754 ± 12. 170 dB/m (p = 0. 00156)). UAC reached maximal level in children of S 3 subgroup (S 1 — 2. 55 ± 0. 08 dB/cm; S 2 — 2. 56 ± 0. 09 dB/cm; S 3  — 2. 74 ± 0. 14 dB/cm; group 2 — 2. 26 ± 0. 08 dB/cm; group 3 — 1. 72 ± 0. 15 dB/cm (p = 0. 00001)). Patients with pancreatic steatosis had higher level of liver and pancreatic stiffness, but significance of difference was low (p =  0. 59). Conclusions. Pediatric nonalcoholic fatty <b>pancreas</b> <b>disease</b> was accompanied by liver steatosis, higher level of inflammation markers and insulin resistance that increased with growth of steatosis degree...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Endoscopic sphincterotomy (EST) and {{endoscopic}} papil-lary balloon dilatation (EPBD) {{have become}} the main therapeutic procedures {{in the treatment of}} biliary and <b>pancreas</b> <b>disease.</b> The risk of cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is not well investigated among post-EST/ EPBD patients with benign diseases, particularly in Asia population. A retrospective nationwide cohort study using data from Taiwan’s National Health Insurance Research Database (from January 1, 1998 through December 31, 2010) was conducted. Among patients with history of biliary stone with cholangitis, there were 17, 503 patients in the EST/EPBD cohort and 69, 998 subjects in the comparison. The incidence rate ratio was calculated using the Poisson regression model. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard models, adjusted for potential confounding factors, were used to assess the risk of developing CCA associated with endoscopic EST/EPBD. The cumulative incidences of CCA in the 2 cohorts were calculated using Kaplan–Meier analyses, and differ analyze...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Tissue {{fibrosis}} is {{an integral}} component of chronic inflammatory (liver and <b>pancreas)</b> <b>diseases</b> and pancreatic cancer. Activated pancreatic- (PSC) and hepatic- (HSC) stellate cells {{play a key role}} in fibrogenesis. To identify organ- and disease-specific stellate cell transcriptional fingerprints, we employed genome-wide transcriptional analysis of primary human PSC and HSC isolated from patients with chronic inflammation or cancer. Methods Stellate cells were isolated from patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (n = 5), chronic pancreatitis (n = 6), liver cirrhosis (n = 5) and liver metastasis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (n = 6). Genome-wide transcriptional profiles of stellate cells were generated using our 51 K human cDNA microarray platform. The identified organ- and disease specific genes were validated by quantitative RT-PCR, immunoblot, ELISA, immunocytochemistry and immunohistochemistry. Results Expression profiling identified 160 organ- and 89 disease- specific stellate cell transcripts. Collagen type 11 a 1 (COL 11 A 1) was discovered as a novel PSC specific marker with up to 65 -fold higher expression levels in PSC compared to HSC (p CCL 2 and the cell adhesion molecule VCAM 1 were confined to HSC. PBX 1 expression levels tend to be increased in inflammatory- vs. tumor- stellate cells. Intriguingly, tyrosine kinase JAK 2 and a member of cell contact-mediated communication CELSR 3 were found to be selectively up-regulated in tumor stellate cells. Conclusions We identified and validated HSC and PSC specific markers. Moreover, novel target genes of tumor- and inflammation associated stellate cells were discovered. Our data may be instrumental in developing new tailored organ- or disease-specific targeted therapies and stellate cell biomarkers. </p...|$|R
