25|$|According to the {{witnesses}} who were interviewed during the investigation, {{one of the}} fans fell at the lower steps of Stairway 1. According to some reports, it was a young woman, who had lost her shoe on the stairs and stopped, trying to retrieve it and <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>on.</b> A couple of people also stopped, {{trying to help the}} fan in need, but the moving dense crowd on the stairs, limited by metal banisters, promptly crushed them down. People began to stumble over the bodies of those who were crushed in a domino effect.|$|E
25|$|Climbing the Galibier, Eugène Christophe {{broke the}} fork of his bicycle. This {{was the third}} time in his career that this happened. He walked to the top, and down the entire descent before he could fix it. He {{finished}} the stage three hours after the winner. The leader of the race, Alavoine, also suffered from mechanical problems. His chain broke several times, and in the cold rain he had to <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>on.</b> He also had a cold, and could not go along with his competitors. Heusghem attacked on that stage, and won back more than half an hour, and was then third in the general classification.|$|E
500|$|In March 2008, in an interview, Jason Statham {{said that}} [...] "somebody should just erase it from IMDb.... and <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> there when it's fully due and ready. [...] It's {{one of those}} things that's just sitting around." [...] Producer Donald De Line {{revealed}} in June that a script for The Brazilian Job had been developed and budgeted, but [...] "a lot of things were happening with various management changes and it got [...]" [...] Describing its story, he said it [...] "starts in Brazil, the set up is in Rio and the picture moves to Belgium where there’s something involving diamonds."

5000|$|EG: First, let's {{pretend that}} [...] "Completed" [...] has a third {{attribute}} called [...] "grade". It's unwanted baggage here, {{so we must}} project it off always. In fact in this step we can drop 'Task' from R as well; the multiply <b>puts</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>on.</b>|$|R
500|$|Unlike Madonna's {{previous}} two lead singles, [...] "4 Minutes" [...] (2008) and [...] "Give Me All Your Luvin'" [...] (2012), [...] "Living for Love" [...] puts {{the emphasis on}} the lyrics and vocals, with the lines on the bridge going like [...] "Took me to heaven, let me fall down/Now that it's over, I'm gonna carry on" [...] and a [...] "throbbing drop" [...] in the middle. Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine described the song as Kiesza meets [...] "Like a Prayer", and noted that there were many changes from the leaked demo version: the throwback house music being replaced by an 808 pulse sound and Keys' piano, as well as handclaps and gospel riffing being removed {{towards the end of the}} song. For Jon Lisi from PopMatters, [...] "Living for Love" [...] fitted with contemporary pop music releases and the DIY ethic they displayed, starting from Taylor Swift's [...] "Shake It Off", to Ariana Grande's [...] "Break Free" [...] and Katy Perry's [...] "Roar". The survivor anthem-like nature of the track was evocative of Madonna's survival in her music career. With NRJ the singer herself explained the meaning behind the lyrics: [...] "It's a song having your heart broken but it's about saying you know what I'm going to my life goes on, I will carry on, I won't stop believing in love, I'll pick up my crown, <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> my head and I will walk through life proudly believing that love, true love does exist." ...|$|E
500|$|Writing for USA Today, Brian Mansfield complimented {{the optimistic}} and [...] "self-assured" [...] {{nature of the}} song, adding that [...] "it's the sort of {{determined}} dance anthem Madonna does so well". The Dallas Morning News Hunter Hauk described the song as a [...] "solid melding" [...] of different club musics and appreciated the dance break, and Madonna's singing attitude, calling it [...] "less prickly or defiant than we see on Instagram these days". Jeff Miers from The Buffalo News compared [...] "Living for Love" [...] to earlier club anthems, songs which had become commercial success for Madonna. Writing for i-D, Nick Levine described the song as a [...] "perfectly-pitched comeback single: rather than returning with a cheap EDM banger... When she sings 'I picked up my crown, <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> my head', {{it feels like a}} statement of intent." [...] Lewis Corner from Digital Spy listed it {{as one of the top}} ten tracks of the week, adding that the composition made it [...] "an euphoric first cut from... Rebel Heart". Jed Gottlieb from Boston Herald described the track's beats as contemporary, while found the chorus and the hooks to be reminiscent of [...] "old school" [...] Top 40 songs. [...] "True Blue fans will hear a joy and nostalgia in [...] ". Jon Pareles from The New York Times commended [...] "Living for Love"'s ability to transform [...] "the breakup emotions into an uplifting redemption". He called it [...] "one of Madonna's best singles in a decade". Writing for PopMatters, Lisi found the track to be Madonna's [...] "most joyous" [...] release since [...] "Express Yourself".|$|E
2500|$|In 1998, after George Will wrote {{a column}} {{reviewing}} the allegations of corruption against her, Moseley Braun responded to Will's comments, saying that [...] "I think because he couldn't say nigger, he said corrupt," [...] She also compared Will to a Ku Klux Klansman, saying: [...] "I mean this very sincerely {{from the bottom of}} my heart: He can take his hood and <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> again, as far as I'm concerned." [...] Later, Moseley Braun apologized for her remarks.|$|E

50|$|In November 1981, Potter {{met with}} Ihor Wolosenko of Synapse Software, which {{at that time}} was being run from Wolosenko's {{apartment}} in Berkley. Wolosenko took the time to test and debug the program before <b>putting</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the market. <b>Its</b> re-launch received much better reviews. Over the next year, Potter released five games for Synapse, Protector, Protector II, Chicken, Nautilus and Shadow World.|$|R
2500|$|Members {{who have}} participated in the temple {{endowment}} ceremony are expected to wear a temple garment under their clothing at all times. Members are told that they should not partially or completely remove the garment to participate in activities that can [...] "reasonably be done with the garment worn properly beneath the clothing". When necessary, the garment may be temporarily removed, but members are told that after the activity they should <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> as soon as possible. Swimming is given as an example of an activity that would justify removal of the garment.|$|E
2500|$|The hat {{became so}} iconic that the filmmakers could only {{come up with}} very good reasons or jokes to remove it. If it ever fell off during a take, filming would have to stop to <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>on.</b> In jest, Ford put a stapler against his head to stop his hat from falling off when a {{documentary}} crew visited during shooting of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. This created the urban legend that Ford stapled the hat to his head. Anytime Indy's hat accidentally came off {{as part of the}} storyline (blown off by the wind, knocked off, etc.) and seemed almost irretrievable, filmmakers would make sure Indy and his hat were always reunited, regardless of the implausibility of its return. Although other hats were also used throughout the films, the general style and profile remained the same. Elements of the outfit include: ...|$|E
2500|$|This {{letter to}} Zweig was intercepted by the Gestapo {{and sent to}} Hitler. Strauss was {{subsequently}} dismissed from his post as Reichsmusikkammer president in 1935. The 1936 Berlin Summer Olympics nevertheless used Strauss's Olympische Hymne, which he had composed in 1934. Strauss's seeming relationship with the Nazis in the 1930s attracted criticism from some noted musicians, including Arturo Toscanini, who in 1933 had said, [...] "To Strauss the composer I take off my hat; to Strauss the man I <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> again", when Strauss had accepted {{the presidency of the}} Reichsmusikkammer. Much of Strauss's motivation in his conduct during the Third Reich was, however, to protect his Jewish daughter-in-law Alice and his Jewish grandchildren from persecution. Both of his grandsons were bullied at school, but Strauss used his considerable influence to prevent the boys or their mother being sent to concentration camps.|$|E

50|$|The {{following}} day, Giulio returns Strangers on a Train to {{the video}} store. Andrea asks Giulio to mind the store while he steps out. Giulio agrees and while Andrea is away, he looks up Federica's address on the store computer. In {{the middle of his}} poking around, Sasha comes into the store and they speak briefly. She sees that he has returned Strangers on a Train and she <b>puts</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the shelf.|$|R
50|$|At Boston's Logan International Airport, Mr. Gold is {{required}} to place his scarf, the talisman that protects his memories, in a bin at the security checkpoint. He becomes weak and disoriented until Emma <b>puts</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> him after they are screened. Later, Gold angrily hits a bathroom fixture and bloodies his knuckles, then finds that {{he is unable to}} magically heal the injury. Gold, Emma, and Henry board the plane and its destination is announced: New York City.|$|R
2500|$|PEF {{reached a}} new {{contract}} with the state in March 1993. Although the state's chief negotiation withdrew the state's last contract offer {{at the end of}} February, the governor personally <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the table. Shafer quickly agreed to the pact, which included a 9.5 percent salary increase over four years that was retroactive to April 1, 1991; moved PEF members into the state's health insurance pool; and ended PEF's lawsuit over the state's decision to defer a week's pay until each member retired. Although the PEF executive board voted to recommend the contract to PEF's members, those who voted [...] "no" [...] on the pact argued that PEF had achieved less than other unions, that the deal traded concessions for pay increases, and that the money spent on Kheel's consulting contract had gotten the union nothing better than what had been offered months before. [...] The board meeting was a raucous one, with alleged physical confrontations, a [...] "Dump Shafer" [...] movement hanging banners near the entrance, rumors of decertification, and proposals for PEF to abandon its independence and join either SEIU or AFT. Members of PEF voted 28,774 to 7,281 to ratify the new four-year contract on May 12, 1993.|$|E

The Captain, Jennifer, Miss Gravely and Sam bury the body and then dig it up again several times throughout the day.

50|$|Things {{are going}} well for Oswald until the tiger, which awakened already, walks into the shop. The tiger is pretty annoyed about what it lost earlier and is seeking vengeance. When the rabbit tries to flee, the big cat nabs and {{swallows}} him, although Oswald is able to crawl his way out. Understanding the tiger's disgruntlement, Oswald finally picks up the tail and <b>puts</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the striped beast. The tiger is then overjoyed and runs off peacefully, no longer wanting to wreak havoc. Relieved of his trouble as well as feeling happy for the big cat, Oswald simply laughs.|$|R
60|$|He had {{not exactly}} lost it; he had climbed {{in the dead}} of night to the top of the {{wardrobe}} and hidden it there. What he did not know was that the faithful Liza had found it, and <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> his wash-stand.|$|E

50|$|Following this, the new Tsar crowned his consort, first {{briefly with}} his own crown (by {{touching}} it momentarily to her head before <b>putting</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> his own), then with a smaller crown of her own. Further prayers and litanies were read, then the Emperor was anointed just prior to reception of Holy Communion during the Divine Liturgy. He was invited to enter the altar area through the Royal Doors (normally reserved solely to the clergy) and partake of Communion as a priest would, in both kinds. Further prayers and blessings concluded the service, which {{was followed by a}} special feast held in the Kremlin's Palace of Facets.|$|R

Ugandan runner Moses Kipsiro held a slender lead over him {{in the final stages}} of the race and Kipchoge ended up in second place, taking the silver medal some seven hundredths of a second behind. He flew back to Europe immediately after to take part in the Belgrade Race Through History the following day. His shoe fell off in the first kilometre and, after <b>putting</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>on,</b> he made up much ground on the field to eventually take second place two seconds behind Josphat Menjo.|$|R

60|$|The {{young man}} {{took off his}} hat again, showing his shapely head, with a line of {{wholesome}} sunburn ceasing where the recently and closely clipped hair began. He was dressed in a fine summer check, with a blue white-dotted neckerchief, and he had a white hat, in which he looked very well when he <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> his head. His whole dress seemed very fresh and new, and in fact he had cast aside his Texan habiliments only the day before.|$|E
60|$|He walked on. Where is my hat, by the way? Must have <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the peg. Or {{hanging up}} on the floor. Funny I don't {{remember}} that. Hallstand too full.

25|$|A {{quarter of}} a mile past Milefortlet 21 is another side-road, this time leading to the village of Crosscanonby. There was a car park {{opposite}} the turning, but it was claimed by the sea during a winter storm in early 2014. As Allonby bay turns, so does the road, and by the time it reaches Maryport golf club it is heading almost due west. A bend in the road as it cuts through the golf course, however, <b>puts</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> a more southerly course as it enters the final mile toward its southern terminus.

50|$|When {{the bear}} {{is about to}} take a bite of the roasted chicken, the cop, {{approaching}} from behind, swipes it {{in the blink of an}} eye. The surprised bear then looks around and notices the cop pointing a gun at him. He too flees. As they walk away together, Oswald and the bear point fingers at each other over not having to eat anything. Meanwhile, the cop carries the roasted chicken and <b>puts</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the window sill. Just then, the dog, watching from one of the house's corners, thinks another act of pilferage is taking place. In this, the dog chases the cop down the road, passing by Oswald and the bear who are enjoying the incident.|$|R

Jerry hits a second beam and then grabs onto Tom's fur and uses it as a parachute down to a safe wood outcropping. Tom turns up, brimming with rage, and takes his fur <b>back,</b> and <b>puts</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>on.</b> Tom only runs a few paces before realizing that his tail is still crunched up.
