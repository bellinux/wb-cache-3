[...] "Nothing is square and, although you can't <b>put</b> <b>your</b> <b>finger</b> <b>on</b> it, {{it just makes}} you feel like something is not right". [...] Skewing was also part of the overall design for the color palette used in set decoration and costume design. [...] "In the real world, the colors are bright and rich," [...] Willet said. [...] "In the skewed world, they're washed out and faded. [...] Nothing is obvious, and it's only in the overall effect that these subtle differences will work their magic".|$|E
500|$|Meyer {{has been}} {{particularly}} well received by female Holby City fans, elevating Irving to sex-symbol status. The Dail Mail Lynda Lee-Potter described him as [...] "devastatingly attractive, brusque and autocratic" [...] and [...] "the kind of domineering, unsmiling hero who made Mills & Boon heroines swoon." [...] Irving {{felt that this was}} [...] "fairly predictable in terms of the nature of Meyer–tough and masterful–combined with the aphrodisiac of power, and the life and death aspects of his job." [...] He commented that he was surprised by the positive reaction to his character, explaining: [...] "He seems to have captured people's imaginations, but it's difficult to <b>put</b> <b>your</b> <b>finger</b> <b>on</b> what he has. I think it's got something to do with being a character who says exactly what he means all the time. He's got integrity, which I admire anyway, and I expect the audience responds to that. Surgeons seem to like him too. I find that particularly gratifying. He's got the courage to do what's right for his work and his patients and not worry about popularity or being liked." [...] Conversely, Irving noted that after assuming the role, members of the public would sometimes [...] "give a kind of shudder" [...] upon encountering him, associating him with his character.|$|E
500|$|Early {{before the}} release of B'Day in 2006, Knowles held a {{nationwide}} audition for female musicians which ended in Sony Music Studios {{where she and her}} father and collaborator Mathew Knowles were among the judges. The auditions searched for keyboard players, bassists, guitarists, horn players, percussionists and drummers with stops in New Jersey, Atlanta, Burbank, Chicago and Houston. The musicians were asked to re-create the performance of [...] "Work It Out" [...] from the live album Live at Wembley (2004) and be able to perform at least a one-minute solo. Knowles stated that her goal was to get together a group of [...] "fierce, talented, hungry, beautiful" [...] women and form an all-female band. Speaking about her tour and the decision to form a band, Knowles said, [...] "I'm all about female empowerment. I'm all about pushing the envelope. I know it's my responsibility to do something different. I said, 'I want a band, I want something different.'" [...] She further described the process of choosing the contestants during an interview, saying: [...] "I had worldwide auditions; people flew in from Atlanta, Houston, Israel, all over the world. It was extremely difficult [...] [...] so many talented women. I wanted only a nine-piece band, but the girls were so amazing, I couldn't decide. I think I'm going to wind up having 12 people so I have two [...] certain instruments, because [...] were just brilliant. It's a thing called star quality, it's a thing you can't <b>put</b> <b>your</b> <b>finger</b> <b>on,</b> can't describe. When they were playing, I said, 'I want to see y'all battle.' I brought in two of every instrument and that's how I chose. You see the one that really wants it. It was so entertaining, the energy, seeing the girls battle ... God, it was the best. It was magical." [...] Between segments of the show, Suga Mama performed periodic instrumental interludes, with every member giving a solo so Knowles could change her costumes seven times. Describing them as [...] "fantastic", Eamon Sweeney of the Irish Independent noted that [...] "the interval music works perfectly... but two excruciating drum solos are absolutely unnecessary".|$|E

No, the obstinate brat will tell me nothing on that subject; instead of {{answering}} my questions she asks questions of me--an endless rush of questions, and all about Ballingall. How did I know he was dying? When you <b>put</b> <b>your</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>on</b> their wrist, {{what is it you}} count? which is the place where the lungs are? when you tap their chest what do you listen for? are they not dying {{as long as they can}} rise now and then, and dress and go out? when they are really dying do they always know it themselves? If they don't know it, is that a sign that they are not so ill as you think them? When they don't know they are dying, is it best to keep it from them in case they should scream with terror? and so on in a spate of questions, till I called her the Longer Catechism." ...|$|R
5000|$|Brice Morrison, {{writing for}} Gamasutra, {{identified}} that Trauma created a gameplay environment that would feel real to the player, aided {{through the use}} of photography and a simple movement interface. The environment was further aided through the subtle music that can [...] "keep player on an uneasy edge, but not enough for them to consciously wake up to it". Furthermore, Morrison praised the browser-based version of the game for minimizing the distractions normally associated with Flash games, and providing a way of luring the player to explore more of the game. Jason Johnson for Pitchfork Media considered the game to favorably leave the player with [...] "an unsettling feeling that you can’t quite <b>put</b> <b>your</b> <b>finger</b> on", lingering <b>on</b> the edges of [...] "solemn and chilling" [...] and [...] "profound and inconsequential". [...] GameSpot's Kevin VanOrd was more critical of the voice actress used to narrate the game, calling her work [...] "emotionally distant", along with the [...] "aloof" [...] writing that prevents the player from becoming entranced by the narrator's trauma.|$|R

When I was in the criminal branch of practice, it fell to my lot to take instructions {{for the defense of}} women committed for trial from the women's own lips. Whatever other difference there might be among them, I got, in time, to notice, among those who were particularly wicked and unquestionably guilty, one point in which they all resembled each other. Tall and short, old and young, handsome and ugly, they all had a secret self-possession that nothing could shake. On the surface they were as different as possible. Some of them were in a state of indignation; some of them were drowned in tears; some of them were full of pious confidence; and some of them were resolved to commit suicide before the night was out. But only <b>put</b> <b>your</b> <b>finger</b> suddenly <b>on</b> the weak point in the story told by any one of them, and there was an end of her rage, or her tears, or her piety, or her despair; and out came the genuine woman, in full possession of all her resources with a neat little lie that exactly suited the circumstances of the case. Miss Gwilt was in tears, sir--becoming tears that didn't make her nose red--and I put my <b>finger</b> suddenly <b>on</b> the weak point in her story. Down dropped her pathetic pocket-handkerchief from her beautiful blue eyes, and out came the genuine woman with the neat little lie that exactly suited the circumstances! I felt twenty years younger, Mr. Armadale, on the spot. I declare I thought I was in Newgate again, with my note-book in my hand, taking my instructions for the defense!" ...|$|R
2500|$|In {{an attempt}} to clarify her answer, she {{proposed}} a shell game [...] to illustrate: [...] "You look away, and I put a pea under one of three shells. Then I ask you to <b>put</b> <b>your</b> <b>finger</b> <b>on</b> a shell. The odds that your choice contains a pea are , agreed? Then I simply lift up an empty shell from the remaining other two. As I can (and will) do this regardless of what you've chosen, we've learned nothing {{to allow us to}} revise the odds on the shell under your finger." [...] She also proposed a similar simulation with three playing cards.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{track on}} the album is [...] "Manos al Aire", an uptempo dance-influenced track, which Furtado says is about [...] "having a heated argument" [...] with her love interest. During the chorus, she puts up the [...] "white flag" [...] and [...] "surrenders" [...] to him. Another song from the album entitled, [...] "Bajo Otra Luz", Furtado proclaimed, is about [...] "when {{you are in a}} {{relationship}} and you are under a light. You feel like something is glowing on you and there is something different about the world. You can’t <b>put</b> <b>your</b> <b>finger</b> <b>on</b> it." [...] The seventh track, [...] "Suficiente Tiempo", is a description of the busy life of an overworked wife who is [...] "trying to make time for a date night". Furtado said that the album was [...] "purposefully collaboration-heavy" [...] because she [...] "want it to sound like a community effort. I wanted it to have all those layers of experience" [...] She also collaborated with Josh Groban on a song entitled, [...] "Silencio" [...] and called the collaboration a [...] "huge blessing." [...] She felt it was important to feature [...] "an artist that people know more for their English recordings" [...] because she wanted to demonstrate that [...] "language isn't a barrier when it comes to music." ...|$|E

Only instead of being deep inside a human body, you happen to find yourself inside the virtual space of a VR simulator used to teach the surgical techniques of minimally invasive surgery. Rather than being swept along in a rush of liquid, you find yourself perched precariously on top of a bouncy, pinkish-white sack that feels slightly like an amusement park jumping castle for children. Your little insect legs, which are mechanical and therefore lack the suction cup feet that would have come in handy here, sink down in a squishy sort of way while you step gingerly over the pinker veins under the translucent surface of the organ. ‘Ahhh’, you realise, you are standing on the stomach. From this perch up high in the prostrated abdominal cavity, you can see what you think might be the gall bladder, the liver, and a perfectly round, slightly shiny, blue sphere. The blue sphere looks decidedly out of place. But before you can <b>put</b> <b>your</b> <b>finger</b> (or antenae) <b>on</b> why, exactly, it doesn’t fit in, a thin, narrow and very sharp probe jabs down from above you.

6000|$|... ...I am {{indebted to}} you for your most benignant letter of December last. It lies open before me and I read it again and am soothed and cheered and comforted again. You <b>put</b> <b>your</b> <b>finger</b> sympathetically <b>on</b> the place and spoke of what I wanted you to speak of. I have felt, {{for a long time}} past, that I have fallen upon evil days--every sign or symbol of one's being in the least wanted, {{anywhere}} or by any one, having so utterly failed. A new generation, that I know not, and mainly prize not, has taken universal possession. The sense of being utterly out of it weighed me down, and I asked myself what the future would be. All these melancholies were qualified indeed by one redeeming reflection--the sense of how little, for a good while past (for reasons very logical, but accidental and temporary,) I had been producing. I did say to myself [...] "Produce again--produce; produce better than ever, and all will yet be well;" [...] and there was sustenance in that so far as it went. But it has meant much more to me since you have said it--for it is, practically, what you admirably say. It is exactly, moreover, what I meant to admirably do--and have meant, all along, about this time to get into the motion of. The whole thing, however, represents a great change in my life, inasmuch as {{what is clear is that}} periodical publication is practically closed to me--I'm the last hand that the magazines, in this country or in the U.S., seem to want. I won't afflict you with the now accumulated (during all these past years) evidence on which this induction rests--and I have spoken of it to no creature till, at this late day, I speak of it to you.... All this, I needn't say, is for your segretissimo ear. What it means is that [...] "production" [...] for me, as aforesaid, means production of the little book, pure and simple--independent of any antecedent appearance; and, truth to tell, now that I wholly see that, and have at last accepted it, I am, incongruously, not at all sorry. I am indeed very serene. I have always hated the magazine form, magazine conditions and manners, and much of the magazine company. I hate the hurried little subordinate part that one plays in the catchpenny picture-book--and the negation of all literature that the insolence of the picture-book imposes. The money-difference will be great--but not so great after a bit as at first; and the other differences will be so all to the good that even from the economic point of view they will tend to make up for that and perhaps finally even completely do so. It is about the distinctness of one's book-position that you have so substantially reassured me; and I mean to do far better work than ever I have done before. I have, potentially, improved immensely and am bursting with ideas and subjects--though the act of composition is with me more and more slow, painful and difficult. I shall never again write a long novel; but I hope to write six immortal short ones--and some tales of the same quality. Forgive, my dear Howells, the cynical egotism of these remarks--the fault of which is in your own sympathy. Don't fail me this summer. I shall probably not, as usual, absent myself from these islands--not be beyond the Alps as I was when you were here last. That way Boston lies, which is the deadliest form of madness. I sent you only last night messages of affection by dear little [...] "Ned" [...] Abbey, who presently sails for N.Y. laden with the beautiful work he has been doing for the new Boston public library. I hope you will see him--he will speak of me competently and kindly. I wish all power to your elbow. Let me hear as soon as there is a sound of packing. Tell Mildred I rejoice in the memory of her.
