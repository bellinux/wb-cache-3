40|$|<b>Perifosine</b> is a {{synthetic}} novel alkylphospholipid, {{a new class}} of antitumor agents which targets cell membranes and inhibits Akt activation. Here we show that baseline phosphorylation of Akt in multiple myeloma (MM) cells is completely inhibited by <b>perifosine</b> [octadecyl-(1, 1 -dimethyl-piperidinio- 4 -yl) -phosphate] in a time- and dose-dependent fashion, without inhibiting phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 phosphorylation. <b>Perifosine</b> induces significant cytotoxicity in both MM cell lines and patient MM cells resistant to conventional therapeutic agents. <b>Perifosine</b> does not induce cytotoxicity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Neither exogenous interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) nor insulinlike growth factor 1 (IGF- 1) overcomes Perifosine-induced cytotoxicity. Importantly, <b>Perifosine</b> induces apoptosis even of MM cells adherent to bone marrow stromal cells. <b>Perifosine</b> triggers c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation, followed by caspase- 8 / 9 and poly (ADP) -ribose polymerase cleavage. Inhibition of JNK abrogates perifosine-induced cytotoxicity, suggesting that JNK plays an essential role in perifosine-induced apoptosis. Interestingly, phosphorylation of extracellular signal–related kinase (ERK) is increased by perifosine; conversely, MEK inhibitor synergistically enhances Perifosine-induced cytotoxicity in MM cells. Furthermore, <b>perifosine</b> augments dexamethasone, doxorubicin, melphalan, and bortezomib-induced MM cell cytotoxicity.

40|$|PURPOSE: Combined {{modality}} {{treatment has}} improved outcome in various solid tumors. Besides classic anticancer drugs, {{a new generation}} of biological response modifiers has emerged that increases the efficacy of radiation. Here, we have investigated whether <b>perifosine,</b> an orally applicable, membrane-targeted alkylphospholipid, enhances the antitumor effect of radiation in vitro and in vivo. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Several long-term and short-term in vitro assays (clonogenic survival, sulforhodamine B cytotoxicity, apoptosis, and cell cycle analysis) were used to assess the cytotoxic effect of <b>perifosine</b> in combination with radiation. In vivo, the response of human KB squamous cell carcinoma xenografts was measured after treatment with <b>perifosine,</b> irradiation, and the combination. Radiolabeled <b>perifosine</b> was used to determine drug disposition in tumor and normal tissues. At various intervals after treatment, tumor specimens were collected to document histopathologic changes. RESULTS: In vitro, <b>perifosine</b> reduced clonogenic survival, enhanced apoptosis, and increased cell cycle arrest after radiation. In vivo, radiation and <b>perifosine</b> alone induced a dose-dependent tumor growth delay. When combining multiple <b>perifosine</b> administrations with single or split doses of radiation, complete and sustained tumor regression was observed. Histopathologic analysis of tumor specimens revealed a prominent apoptotic response after combined treatment with radiation and <b>perifosine.</b> Radiation-enhanced tumor response was observed at clinically relevant plasma <b>perifosine</b> concentrations and accumulating drug disposition of > 100 microg/g in tumor tissue. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Perifosine</b> enhances radiation-induced cytotoxicity, as evidenced by reduced clonogenic survival and increased apoptosis induction in vitro and by complete tumor regression in vivo.

40|$|To potentiate the {{response}} of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) cells to TNF-Related Apoptosis- Inducing Ligand (TRAIL) cytotoxicity, we have examined the efficacy of a combination with <b>perifosine,</b> a novel phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PI 3 K) /Akt signaling inhibitor. The rationale for using such a combination is that <b>perifosine</b> was recently described to increase TRAIL-R 2 receptor expression and decrease the cellular FLICE-Inhibitory Protein (cFLIP) in human lung cancer cell lines. <b>Perifosine</b> and TRAIL both induced cell death by apoptosis in the THP- 1 AML cell line, which is characterized by constitutive PI 3 K/Akt activation, but lacks functional p 53. <b>Perifosine,</b> at concentrations below IC 50, dephosphorylated Akt and increased TRAIL-R 2 levels, as demonstrated by western blot, RT-PCR, and flow cytometric analysis. <b>Perifosine</b> also decreased the long isoform of cFLIP (cFLIP-L) and the X-linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein (XIAP) expression. <b>Perifosine</b> and TRAIL synergized to activate caspase- 8 and induce apoptosis, which was blocked by a caspase- 8 selective inhibitor. Upregulation of TRAIL-R 2 expression was dependent on a protein kinase Cα/ c-Jun-NH 2 -kinase 2 /c-Jun signaling pathway activated by <b>perifosine</b> through reactive oxygen species production. <b>Perifosine</b> synergized with TRAIL also in primary AML cells displaying constitutive activation of the Akt pathway, by inducing apoptosis, Akt dephosphorylation, TRAIL-R 2 upregulation, cFLIP-L and XIAP downregulation, and c-Jun phosphorylation.

In phase I/II clinical trials, <b>perifosine</b> has induced tumour regression and caused disease stabilisation {{in a variety of}} tumour types. The genetic determinants responsible for its cytotoxicity have not been comprehensively studied, however. We performed a genome-wide analysis to identify genes whose expression levels or genotypic variation were correlated with the cytotoxicity of <b>perifosine,</b> using public databases on the US National Cancer Institute (NCI) - 60 human cancer cell lines. For demonstrating drug specificity, the NCI Standard Agent Database (including 171 drugs acting through a variety of mechanisms) was used as a control. We identified agents with similar cytotoxicity profiles to that of <b>perifosine</b> in compounds used in the NCI drug screen. Furthermore, Gene Ontology and pathway analyses were carried out on genes more likely to be <b>perifosine</b> specific. The results suggested that genes correlated with <b>perifosine</b> cytotoxicity are connected by certain known pathways that lead to the mitogen-activated protein kinase signalling pathway and apoptosis. Biological processes such as 'response to stress', 'inflammatory response' and 'ubiquitin cycle' were enriched among these genes.

40|$|Hepatocellular {{carcinoma}} (HCC) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common solid cancers, representing the third cause of cancer-related death among cirrhotic patients. Treatment of advanced HCC has become a very active area of research. <b>Perifosine,</b> a new synthetic alkylphospholipid Akt inhibitor, has shown anti-tumor activity by inhibition of Akt phosphorylation. In this study, the effect of <b>perifosine</b> on the cell proliferation and apoptosis in hepatoma cells has been investigated. Cell growth inhibition was detected by MTT assay, cell cycle was analyzed by flow cytometry, AnnexinV-FITC apoptosis detection kit was used to detect cell apoptosis, and protein expression was examined by Western blotting analysis. Our present studies showed that Akt phosphorylation was inhibited by <b>perifosine</b> in HepG 2 and Bel- 7402 human hepatocellular carcinoma cells. <b>Perifosine</b> inhibited the growth of HepG 2 cells and Bel- 7402 cells in a dose-dependent manner, and arrested cell cycle progression at the G 2 phase. Apoptosis induction became more effective with increasing <b>perifosine</b> concentration. The caspase cascade and its downstream effectors, Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), were also activated simultaneously upon <b>perifosine</b> treatment. The proapoptotic effect of <b>perifosine</b> was in part depending on regulation of the phosphorylation level of ERK and JNK. <b>Perifosine</b> cotreatment substantially increased cytotoxic effects of cisplatin in HepG 2 cells.

40|$|<b>Perifosine</b> {{is a novel}} p. o. {{bioavailable}} alkylphospholipid. <b>Perifosine</b> has displayed significant antiproliferative activ-ity {{in vitro}} and in vivo in several human tumor model systems and has recently entered phase I clinical trials. Recent studies have identified that <b>perifosine</b> could cause cell cycle arrest with induction of p 21 WAF 1 /CIP 1 in a p 53 -independent fashion; however, the basis for that effect is not known. Structurally, <b>perifosine</b> resembles naturally occurring phospholipids. Therefore, we hypothesized that <b>perifosine</b> might perturb pathways related to phospholi-pids modulated by growth factor action. We demonstrate here that <b>perifosine</b> causes dose-dependent inhibition of protein kinase B/Akt phosphorylation and thus activation at concentrations causing growth inhibition of PC- 3 prostate carcinoma cells. Only the myristoylated form of Akt (MYR-Akt), which bypasses the requirement for pleckstrin homology (PH) domain-mediated membrane recruitment, abrogated perifosine-mediated decrease of Akt phosphorylation and cell growth inhibition by perifo-sine. We demonstrate further that <b>perifosine</b> decreases the plasma membrane localization of Akt, and this is substan-tially relieved by MYR-Akt along with relief of downstream drug effect on induction of p 21 WAF 1 /CIP 1. <b>Perifosine</b> does not directly affect phosphoinositide 3 -kinase (PI 3 K), phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1, or Akt activity at concentrations inhibiting Akt phosphorylation and mem-brane localization. Our results demonstrate that Akt is an important cellular target of <b>perifosine</b> action.

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Perifosine,</b> an alkylphospholipid {{tested in}} phase II {{clinical}} trials, modulates the extrinsic apoptotic pathway and cooperates with tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) to augment apoptosis. The current study focuses on revealing the {{mechanisms by which}} <b>perifosine</b> enhances TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Results The combination of <b>perifosine</b> and TRAIL was more active than each single agent alone in inducing apoptosis of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cells and inhibiting the growth of xenografts. Interestingly, <b>perifosine</b> primarily increased cell surface levels of DR 5 although it elevated the expression of both DR 4 and DR 5. Blockade of DR 5, but not DR 4 upregulation, via small interfering RNA (siRNA) inhibited perifosine/TRAIL-induced apoptosis. <b>Perifosine</b> increased phosphorylated c-Jun NH 2 -terminal kinase (JNK) and c-Jun levels, which were paralleled with DR 4 and DR 5 induction. However, only DR 5 upregulaiton induced by <b>perifosine</b> could be abrogated by both the JNK inhibitor SP 600125 and JNK siRNA. The antioxidants, N-acetylcysteine and glutathione, but not vitamin C or tiron, inhibited perifosine-induced elevation of p-c-Jun, DR 4 and DR 5.

40|$|Background/Aims: The alkylphospholipid <b>perifosine</b> is {{used for}} the {{treatment}} of malignancy. The substance is effective by triggering suicidal tumor cell death or apoptosis. Side effects of <b>perifosine</b> include anemia. At least in theory, perifosine-induced anemia could result from stimulation of suicidal erythrocyte death or eryptosis. Hallmarks of eryptosis are cell shrinkage and cell membrane scrambling with phosphatidylserine translocation to the erythrocyte surface. Cellular mechanisms participating in the orchestration of eryptosis include increase of cytosolic Ca 2 + activity ([Ca 2 +]i), oxidative stress, increase of ceramide abundance, as well as activation of staurosporine sensitive protein kinase C and/or of SB 203580 sensitive p 38 kinase. The present study explored, whether <b>perifosine</b> induces eryptosis and, if so, whether its effect involves and/or requires Ca 2 + entry, oxidative stress, ceramide and kinase activation. Methods: Flow cytometry was employed to quantify phosphatidylserine exposure at the cell surface from annexin-V-binding, cell volume from forward scatter, [Ca 2 +]i from Fluo 3 -fluorescence, reactive oxygen species (ROS) abundance from DCFDA dependent fluorescence, and ceramide abundance utilizing specific antibodies. Hemolysis was estimated from hemoglobin concentration in the supernatant. Results: A 24 hours exposure of human erythrocytes to <b>perifosine</b> (2. 5 µg/ml) significantly increased the percentage of annexin-V-binding cells, significantly decreased average forward scatter, significantly increased the percentage of shrunken erythrocytes, and significantly decreased the percentage of swollen erythrocytes. <b>Perifosine</b> significantly increased the percentage of hemolytic erythrocytes. <b>Perifosine</b> significantly increased Fluo 3 -fluorescence, but decreased DCFDA fluorescence and ceramide abundance.

KB PERR clone 10 cells show a similar rate of raft-dependent endocytosis {{with respect to}} the parental cells, and silencing of both clathrin and dynamin in the latter causes only minor changes in the rate of <b>perifosine</b> uptake. <b>Perifosine</b> uptake is a temperature- and ATP-dependent, N-ethylmaleimide- and orthovanadate-sensitive process in parental cells.

We hypothesized that inhibiting this positive feedback by a potent Akt inhibitor <b>perifosine</b> would augment rapamycin-induced cytotoxicity in MM cells. <b>Perifosine</b> inhibited rapamycin-induced phosphorylated Akt, resulting in enhanced cytotoxicity in MM. 1 S cells even {{in the presence of}} interleukin- 6, insulin-like growth factor-I, or bone marrow stromal cells. Moreover, rapamycin-induced autophagy in MM. 1 S MM cells, as evidenced by electron microscopy and immunocytochemistry, was augmented by <b>perifosine.</b> Combination therapy increased apoptosis detected by Annexin V/propidium iodide analysis and caspase/poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage. Importantly, in vivo antitumor activity and prolongation of survival in a MM mouse xenograft model after treatment was enhanced with combination of nanoparticle albumin-bound-rapamycin and <b>perifosine.</b> Utilizing the in silico predictive analysis, we confirmed our experimental findings of this drug combination on PI 3 K, Akt, mTOR kinases, and the caspases. Our data suggest that mutual suppression of the PI 3 K/Akt/mTOR pathway by rapamycin and <b>perifosine</b> combination induces synergistic MM cell cytotoxicity, providing the rationale for clinical trials in patients with relapsed/refractory M...|$|E
40|$|Primary {{central nervous}} system (CNS) tumors {{are the most common}} solid tumors found in children. While surgery and {{radiotherapy}} still remain the standard treatment modalities in pediatric brain tumors, chemotherapy also has an important part in the management of these tumors. However, most of the available chemotherapeutic drugs have suboptimal effectiveness. Deregulation of various pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic pathways has been cited as a major mechanism underlying this drug resistance. The role of various serine threonine kinases, including Akt kinases, in promoting drug resistance is being extensively studied in various cancers. A complete understanding of the molecular mechanisms that underlie drug resistance, and the details regarding the specific drug resistance systems operating in medulloblastoma, will help in the development of better therapeutic strategies for these tumors. We have characterized the expression of Akt in medulloblastoma clinical samples and cell lines. The majority of tumor samples and cell lines were found to have elevated endogenous Akt signaling activity, compared with normal brain samples. Akt kinase activity is involved in cell survival, proliferation and resistance to chemo/radiotherapy in medulloblastoma. In this study, we used a novel drug which has significant activity in suppressing Akt and found that treatment with <b>perifosine</b> led to rapid induction of cell death in medulloblastoma cell lines. Akt inhibitor treatment induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Cell cycle arrest was observed at G 1 and G 2 cell cycle checkpoints, accompanied by increased expression of the cell cycle inhibitor p 21 cip 1 /waf 1. We further investigated the involvement of various proteins regulating apoptosis and cell cycle progression in medulloblastoma cells. We also checked the effect of <b>perifosine</b> on regulators of p 21 waf 1 /cip 1, including Akt, MAPK pathways and p 53. The effect of <b>perifosine</b> on the MAPK pathway was found to vary with the medulloblastoma cells line studied: for example <b>perifosine</b> treatment increases the activation level of MAPK in VC- 312 but had no effect in DAOY cells. On the other hand, <b>perifosine</b> treatment resulted in a decrease in P 53 in VC- 312 cells without much effect in DAOY cells. Further studies are warranted to check the effect of <b>perifosine</b> on p 21 waf 1 /cip 1 regulators. Additionally, our studies showed that the combination of <b>perifosine</b> with etoposide or irradiation had a greater than additive effect in DAOY medulloblastoma cells. These studies support an oncogenic role for Akt in medulloblastoma and provide evidence that the Akt inhibition by <b>perifosine,</b> either alone or in combination with other chemotherapeutic drugs, might be an effective therapeutic strategy for the treatment of medulloblastoma...|$|E
40|$|Synthetic ether analogues (prototypes: miltefosine, <b>perifosine</b> and cdelfosine) {{of natural}} {{phospholipids}} are {{a family of}} anti-cancer drugs {{with a wide range}} of pharmacological behaviour. There is a growing interest in anti-cancer ether phospholipids owing to their seleC;! 1 vity against tumours which has resulted in a much lower toxicity, as compared with other classical anti-cancer chemotherapeutic agents. However, due to the presence of the phosphate diester, these compounds can be quickly biodegraded by enzymes of phospholipid metabolism. Consequently, the aims of this research project were to synthesise isosteric analogues of miltefosine, <b>perifosine</b> and edelfosine by replacing the two phosphorus-oxygen bonds with phosphorus-carbon bonds. Several methodologies for the preparation of phosphorus-carbon bonds were investigated and phosphinic acid analogues of miltefosine, <b>perifosine</b> and edelfosine were efficiently synthesised in good overall yields. The first phosphorus-carbon bond of miltefosine and edelfosine analogues was prepared by a radical hydrophosphorylation addition reaction, and the second by conversion to the P(III) silyloxy intermediate, followed by Michael-type addition to acrylonitrile and acidic hydrolysis of the silyl groups. Miltefosine analogue was synthesised in a total of six steps from hexadecene, in 69 % overall yield, and edelfosine analogue was synthesised in a total of ten steps from hexadecanol, in 8. 5 % overall yield. <b>Perifosine</b> analogue was successfully synthesised by a double radical hydrophosphorylatipn process, in a total of six steps, in 50 % overall yield from hexadecene.

Automated solid-phase extraction of diluted plasma samples, based on 250 -μl plasma aliquots, at pH 6. 5, allowed a reliable quantification of <b>perifosine</b> down to 4 ng/ml. Injection of 200 μl of plasma extracts onto a 100 x 3 mm normal-phase analytical column at a flow-rate of 0. 5 ml/min provided retention-times of 2. 4 and 2. 1 min for <b>perifosine</b> (I) {{and the internal}} standard (II), respectively.

40|$|International audienceFunctional {{aminophospholipid}} translocases {{are composed}} {{of at least two}} proteins: an alpha subunit from the P 4 subfamily of P-type ATPases and a beta subunit from the CDC 50 -Lem 3 p family. Over-expression and knockdown of the human beta subunit CDC 50 A in KB cells enhanced and decreased, respectively, the uptake of both fluorescent aminophospholipid analogues and the anticancer alkyl-phospholipid <b>perifosine.</b> Confocal microscopy showed that CDC 50 A-V 5 was localized at the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi complex of both KB (perifosine-sensitive) and KB PER-R (perifosine-resistant, alkyl-phospholipid uptake deficient) cells, but was only widely distributed in the early and late endosomes in KB cells. Biotinylation of cell surface proteins allowed CDC 50 A-V 5 to be detected in the plasma membrane of KB cells but not in KB PER-R cells, thereby suggesting a defect in CDC 50 A trafficking that could explain the inability of KB PER-R to uptake <b>perifosine.</b> Over-expression of CDC 50 A in HeLa and HEK 293 T cells did not increase uptake, since the protein was retained at the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi. However, when CDC 50 A was co-expressed with the P 4 -ATPase Atp 8 b 1, the two proteins co-localized at the plasma membrane and the uptake of aminophospholipids and <b>perifosine</b> increased strikingly in both cell lines.

40|$|Donna S. WoulfeInflammatory Breast Cancer (IBC) is a {{rare and}} {{aggressive}} form of breast cancer with a rapid progression and lower survival rates than non-IBC types. Research aimed at understanding the role of various enzymes involved in controlling cell growth identified the serine/threonine kinase Akt as a major factor involved in cell growth and proliferation. Previous published {{studies have shown that}} Akt activation may be increased in IBC cell line SUM- 149 relative to non-IBC cell line MDA- 231. Building on these studies, it was hypothesized that Akt inhibition using <b>Perifosine</b> may be an effective strategy for reducing proliferation and invasion of breast cancer cells. MTT assay revealed that SUM- 149 cells proliferated more than MDA- 231 cells and Akt inhibition preferentially reduced IBC cell proliferation relative to non-IBC proliferation. Immunoblot analysis revealed that SUM- 149 and MDA- 231 cells expressed equal amounts of Akt 1 and Akt 3 isoforms but SUM- 149 cells expressed lower amount of Akt 2 than MDA- 231 cells. Attempts to further examine the role of individual Akt isoforms, especially Akt 3, on proliferation of IBC cells by siRNA knockdown of individual Akt isoforms to determine whether specific inhibition of an isoform reduces IBC cell proliferation proved to be unsuccessful. Combination therapies (<b>Perifosine</b> in combination with the PDGF inhibitor Crenolanib) were explored in order to limit drug toxicities through possible use of lower concentrations of each drug. Total Akt was immunoprecipitated in SUM- 149 cells and activation was assessed using Akt-phospho-ser 473. The experiment revealed that <b>Perifosine</b> treatment completely inhibited Akt activation while Crenolanib did not inhibit Akt activation. MTT assays conducted to assess proliferation revealed that <b>Perifosine</b> treatment alone was superior to inhibition of IBC cell proliferation compared to Crenolanib alone or in combination. Scratch wound assays were also conducted to assess role of Akt inhibition in migration in both IBC and non-IBC cells. In both cell lines, <b>Perifosine</b> did not appear to inhibit migration while Crenolanib, working through a different pathway, was successful in inhibiting migration. These results suggest that IBC cells utilize different pathways for proliferation and migration and Akt inhibition may be an effective strategy for inhibition of proliferation alone.

40|$|Achieving a {{cure for}} high-risk neuroblastoma, the most common extracranial solid tumor in children, remains a {{formidable}} task despite the recent addition of antibody-mediated anti-GD 2 immunotherapy to established multimodality therapy. The PI 3 K/Akt pathway is a pivotal signaling pathway utilized by a plethora of receptor tyrosine kinases {{that contribute to the}} aggressive phenotype of high-risk neuroblastoma. Akt is aberrantly activated in high-risk neuroblastoma and is therefore an attractive therapeutic target. <b>Perifosine</b> is the best-characterized Akt inhibitor in preclinical studies and in clinical trials in adults, although safety in children is not yet confirmed. It is a synthetic third-generation alkylphospholipid with good oral bioavailability and modest side effects. <b>Perifosine</b> targets the lipid-binding PH domain of Akt and inhibits the translocation of Akt to the cell membrane, an essential step for Akt activation. It decreases Akt phosphorylation and increases caspase-dependent apoptosis in neuroblastoma cell lines, inhibits growth of neuroblastoma xenografts, and overcomes RTK/ligand-mediated chemoresistance. It is currently being studied in two Phase I clinical trials in children with recurrent or refractory solid tumors including neuroblastoma. In the single agent trial (ClinicalTrials. gov identifier NCT 00776867), maximum tolerated dose has not yet been reached and pharmacokinetic data has been accrued. In the second study (ClinicalTrials. gov identifier NCT 01049841), patients are treated with a combination of <b>perifosine</b> and the mTOR-inhibitor temsirolimus based on preclinical data showing synergy of the two agents, and the premise that direct Akt inhibition may overcome Akt activation secondary to mTOR inhibition. Based on results from adult trials, it is unlikely that <b>perifosine</b> alone will produce dramatic therapeutic effects against high-risk neuroblastoma. However, given the recent encouraging early-phase combination therapy results in adults with multiple myeloma and colorectal carcinoma, rational perifosine-containing combination regimens hold promise for neuroblastoma therapy. These will be explored after safety in children is established in Phase I studies...|$|E
40|$|The PI 3 K/Akt/mTOR {{signaling}} pathway is aberrantly activated in various pediatric tumors. We conducted a phase I study of the Akt inhibitor <b>perifosine</b> in patients with recurrent/refractory pediatric CNS and solid tumors. This was a standard 3 + 3 open-label dose-escalation study to assess pharmacokinetics, describe toxicities, and identify the MTD for single-agent <b>perifosine.</b> Five dose levels were investigated, ranging from 25 to 125 mg/m 2 /day for 28 days per cycle. Twenty-three patients (median age 10 years, range 4 - 18 years) with CNS tumors (DIPG [n = 3], high-grade glioma [n = 5], medulloblastoma [n = 2], ependymoma [n = 3]), neuroblastoma (n = 8), Wilms tumor (n = 1), and Ewing sarcoma (n = 1) were treated. Only one DLT occurred (grade 4 hyperuricemia at dose level 4). The most common grade 3 or 4 toxicity at least possibly related to <b>perifosine</b> was neutropenia (8. 7 %), with the remaining grade 3 or 4 toxicities (fatigue, hyperglycemia, fever, hyperuricemia, and catheter-related infection) occurring in one patient each. Pharmacokinetics was dose-saturable at doses above 50 mg/m 2 /day with significant inter-patient variability, consistent with findings reported in adult studies. One patient with DIPG (dose level 5) and 4 of 5 patients with high-grade glioma (dose levels 2 and 3) experienced stable disease for two months. Five subjects with neuroblastoma (dose levels 1 through 4) achieved stable disease which was prolonged (≥ 11 months) in three. No objective responses were noted.
