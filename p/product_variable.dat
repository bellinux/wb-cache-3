40|$|Among {{those who}} use {{multiple}} regression analysis or its offshoots, the dominant method of modeling an interaction effect of two independent variables on a dependent variable is to include a <b>product</b> <b>variable</b> in a linear estimation equation. Textbook writers and researchers almost always interpret the coefficient for the <b>product</b> <b>variable</b> as describing both how the first independent variable influences {{the effect of the}} second independent variable, and vice versa. As a result, writers often claim that interaction effects are “symmetrical. ” In this paper I distinguish between the regression surface produced by estimating a product-variable model of an interaction effect, and the causal mechanisms that produce the regression surface. I discuss four types of interaction effects, and show that the meaning of the product variable’s coefficient differs across types. I also show that one should use the same estimation equation for different types of interaction effects. These considerations imply that the usual interpretation of the product variable’s coefficient is almost always wrong, and that researchers need strong theory or knowledge before they can interpret the results of a <b>product</b> <b>variable</b> model as giving information about the causal mechanisms that constitute an interaction effect. 2 Interpreting Product-Variable Models of Interaction Effects 1 Many interesting findings in the social sciences involve “interaction ” o...|$|E

These techniques included histograms, analysis of means (ANOM), control charts, process capability studies and Gauge Repeatability and Reproducibility (Gauge R&R). The production variables studied included raw material variables (wheat protein and moisture content) and <b>product</b> <b>variables</b> (biscuit breaking strength, moisture content and thickness of biscuit). The plant studied has three independent production lines, so <b>product</b> <b>variables</b> were analysed separately for each line. ANOM indicated that several process means were significantly different (α= 0. 05) from the grand mean (breaking strength line 3, product moisture content line 3 and thickness of biscuit in all lines). Control charts indicated that some observed variables were not in statistical control (wheat protein and moisture content, breaking strength line 3 and thickness of biscuit for lines 1 – 2). Results from capability studies showed that all observed variables except wheat moisture content were not capable. Notably, {{there was a large}} variation in the thickness of biscuit.

40|$|The {{research}} literature {{is replete with}} relatively small scale studies investigating various theories of reading. This research is often exploratory rather than confirmatory in nature. To avoid such limitations, samples from a large data base were used to examine causal models based on the Goodman theory of reading and the concepts of process and product comprehension. Two separate causal models were created using the following variables: graphic similarity, sound similarity, acceptability with prior text, acceptability with following text, acceptability or correction, the retelling score for the text read, the Comprehensive Tests of Basic Skills Vocabulary and Comprehension scores, and the Degrees of Reading Power (DRP) scores. The sample for one model consisted of 448 Grade Two to Grade Five students enrolled in a Chapter I program in the southwestern United States. The sample for the second model consisted of only the Grade Four and Grade Five students from the larger sample since DRP scores were not available for other students. In the hypothesized models graphic and sound similarity, and acceptability with prior and following were posited to load on a latent factor representing the unitary dimension of reading which in turn was posited to be causally related to process and <b>product</b> <b>variables.</b> Process variables included the acceptable or corrected score (RMI comprehending score) and the DRP score. <b>Product</b> <b>variables</b> included the CTBS scores and the retelling score. <b>Product</b> <b>variables</b> were posited to be dependent upon process variables. Analysis was conducted using the LISREL program. For both models causal pathways were dropped between process and <b>product</b> comprehension <b>variables</b> but were retained between the latent variables of reading and process and product comprehension. In addition, the DRP score loaded on product comprehension more than on process comprehension while retelling loaded more on process comprehension than <b>product</b> comprehension. <b>Variables</b> relating to the Goodman theory appeared to be more interrelated than those external to the theory.

In this paper I show how the coefficient for the <b>product</b> <b>variable</b> in these models depends on the causal mechanism that underlies the interaction effect.

40|$|By {{now it is}} well {{established}} that the structural α-relaxation time, τ α, of non-associated small molecular and polymeric glass-formers obey thermodynamic scaling. In other words, τ α {{is a function of}} the <b>product</b> <b>variable,</b> ργ /T, where ρ is the density and T the temperature. The constant γ as well as the function, τ α = (ργ /T), is material dependent. Actually this dependence of τ α on ργ /T originates from the dependence on the same <b>product</b> <b>variable</b> of the Johari-Goldstein β-relaxation time, τ β, or the primitive relaxation time, τ 0, of the coupling model. To support this assertion, we give evidences from various sources itemized as follows. (1) The invariance of the relation between τ α and τ β or τ 0 to widely different combinations of pressure and temperature. (2) Experimental dielectric and viscosity data of glass-forming van der Waals liquids and polymer. (3) Molecular dynamics simulations of binary Lennard-Jones (LJ) models, the Lewis–Wahnström model of orthoterphenyl, 1, 4 polybutadiene, a room temperature ionic liquid, 1 -ethyl- 3 -methylimidazolium nitrate, and a molten salt 2 Ca(NO 3) 2 · 3 KNO 3 (CKN). (4) Both diffusivity and structural relaxation time, as well as the breakdown of Stokes-Einstein relation in CKN obey thermodynamic scaling by ργ /T with the same γ. (5) In polymers, the chain normal mode relaxation time, τ N, is another function of ργ /T with the same γ as segmental relaxation time τ α. (6) While the data of τ α from simulations for the full LJ binary mixture obey very well the thermodynamic scaling, it is strongly violated when the LJ interaction potential is truncated beyond typical inter-particle distance, although in both cases the repulsive pair potentials coincide for some distances...|$|E
