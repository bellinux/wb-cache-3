Mandarić, an investor in AFI, was retained as club chairman. On 1 October 2010, after a poor start that saw Leicester bottom of the Championship with only one win {{out of the first}} nine league matches, Paulo Sousa was sacked by the club with immediate effect. Two days later, Sven-Göran Eriksson, who had been approached by the club after the 6–1 loss to then bottom-of-the-table Portsmouth two weeks earlier, was appointed as his replacement, signing a two-year contract with the club. On 10 February 2011, Vichai Raksriaksorn, part of the Thai-based Asia Football Investments consortium, was appointed new chairman of the club after Mandarić left in November to take over Sheffield Wednesday.|$|E

5|$|Oil {{has been}} pumped {{from the bay}} since 1912, but fishing has been a {{mainstay}} since humans have inhabited the area. In the early 1970s, recreational fishing accounted for a yearly input of $17million to the local economy, while commercial fishermen contributed $27.3 million. Commercial oyster farming was common in the bay until 1995, when the Texas Department of State Health Services suspended the practice, due to an unhealthy annual average zinc level of nearly 2500mg/kg in oysters, which as filter feeders, are affected by high levels of zinc in the water. The excessive zinc {{is believed to have}} been dumped into the bay by the American Smelting and Refining Company's Encycle Texas Incorporated subsidiary, which operated a zinc refinery at the site from 1942 to 1985. The Nueces Bay Power Station is also believed to have discharged zinc used for coolant until December 2002. Since that time, zinc levels in the bay have been reduced to slightly under 1000mg/kg, which remains above the healthy levels of 700mg/kg. The power station has since come under the control of the Topaz <b>Power</b> <b>Group.</b> The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality has established the Total Maximum Daily Load Program to measure the level of pollutants throughout the Nueces watershed, in an effort to restore the bay to safe levels of contaminants. Pesticides that seep into the bay from the heavy agricultural activity on the north shore can also spur adverse environmental effects.|$|E

Alternatively, lower <b>power</b> <b>groups</b> were predicted to fit and be more valued by those individuals with a prevention focus because these groups necessitate (and thus sustain) a focus on safety and security. Five studies found support for these predictions by both assessing and manipulating regulatory focus and <b>group</b> <b>power</b> and by using explicit and implicit measures of group attraction. Moreover, these regulatory fit effects occurred specifically for <b>group</b> <b>power</b> and not for general differences in group status...|$|R
