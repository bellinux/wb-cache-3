The Thai and Vietnamese <b>prices</b> are the five per cent broken rice <b>prices,</b> the American <b>price</b> is the two to four per cent broken <b>price,</b> the Argentinean <b>price</b> is the ten per cent broken <b>price,</b> and the Pakistani <b>price</b> is the twenty five per cent broken <b>price.</b> The <b>prices</b> are therefore seen as representing the higher quality indica grades of rice apart from the Pakistani <b>price.</b> While the higher quality Pakistani <b>price</b> was not available, it is assumed that the higher quality Pakistan <b>price</b> closely follows <b>price</b> movements in the lower quality Pakistani <b>price</b> since this is the case for Thai and Vietnamese rice export <b>prices.</b> The Uruguayan export <b>price</b> is probably a more important rice <b>price</b> for South American markets than the Argentinean <b>price,</b> however, data was only available from 2006 which would have severely cut the available number of observations included in the study therefore the study assumes that Argentinean <b>prices</b> are related to Uruguayan <b>price</b> movements and are therefore suitable for the analysis.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the relationship between live and carcass <b>prices</b> and the seasonality of live, carcass, and wholesale cut <b>prices.</b> Results using Omaha live <b>prices</b> suggested a unidirectional relationship between live and carcass <b>prices,</b> with farm <b>prices</b> leading carcass <b>prices</b> by 3 weeks. In contrast, the results generated using live <b>prices</b> from the St. Joseph terminal market suggested a bidirectional relationship. Live and carcass <b>prices</b> from 1987 to 1992 were found to be highly correlated. The average monthly <b>price</b> spread between the Omaha live <b>price</b> and the USDA carcass <b>price</b> ranged from $ 14. 02 to $ 23. 18 cwt, with an average spread of $ 17. 53 cwt. The spread has changed only marginally from 1987 to 1992.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we explore the possibility, {{heretofore}} unexplored in the marketing literature, that firms “invest funds” in their <b>pricing</b> processes. This builds {{on some of the}} recent economic work on the costs of <b>price</b> adjustment. To do this we undertook a two-year, cross- disciplinary, ethnographic study on the nature of investments made by senior managers to enhance the effectiveness of the <b>pricing</b> processes within their firms. We discovered at least three distinct types of investments that managers at these firms made to <b>price</b> more effectively, which we term as the three capitals of <b>pricing</b> - human capital, systems capital and social capital. Our evidence suggests that <b>pricing</b> is really about managing both <b>prices</b> and investments in the <b>pricing</b> capital used to set and adjust those <b>prices.</b> The existence of these three forms of <b>pricing</b> capital provides a new perspective on <b>pricing</b> strategy, suggesting that firms compete on <b>prices</b> simultaneously in three different ways within their organizations. First, they compete on whether to invest in <b>pricing</b> capital versus or other areas of capital investment, such as plant, equipment, etc. Second, they decide what form of <b>pricing</b> capital to invest in – human, systems or social. Third, they set and adjust <b>prices</b> constrained by the existing <b>pricing</b> capital they have in place {{at the time of their}} <b>pricing</b> actions.
