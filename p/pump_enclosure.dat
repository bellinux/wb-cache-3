40|$|A mass {{spectrometer}} (MS) with unique {{magnetic pole pieces}} which provide a homogenous magnetic field across the gap of the MS magnetic sector {{as well as the}} magnetic field across an ion-type vacuum pump is disclosed. The pole pieces form the top and bottom sides of a housing. The housing is positioned so that portions of the pole pieces form part of the magnetic sector with the space between them defining the gap region of the magnetic sector, through which an ion beam passes. The pole pieces extend beyond the magnetic sector with the space between them being large enough to accommodate the electrical parts of an ion-type vacuum pump. The pole pieces which provide the magnetic field for the pump, together with the housing form the vacuum <b>pump</b> <b>enclosure</b> or housing...|$|E
40|$|Despite the copious {{amount of}} {{research}} on the design and operation of micromixers, there are few works regarding manufacture technology aimed at implementation beyond academic environments. This work evaluates the viability of xurography as a rapid fabrication tool for the development of ultra-low cost microfluidic technology for extreme Point-of-Care (POC) micromixing devices. By eschewing photolithographic processes and the bulkiness of <b>pumping</b> and <b>enclosure</b> systems for rapid fabrication and passively driven operation, xurography is introduced as a manufacturing alternative for asymmetric split and recombine (ASAR) micromixers. A T-micromixer design was used as a reference to assess the effects of different cutting conditions and materials on the geometric features of the resulting microdevices. Inspection by stereographic and confocal microscopy showed {{that it is possible to}} manufacture devices with less than 8 % absolute dimensional error. Implementation of the manufacturing methodology in modified circular shape- based SAR microdevices (balanced and unbalanced configurations) showed that, despite the precision limitations of the xurographic process, it is possible to implement this methodology to produce functional micromixing devices. Mixing efficiency was evaluated numerically and experimentally at the outlet of the microdevices with performances up to 40 %. Overall, the assessment encourages further research of xurography for the development of POC micromixers...|$|R
40|$|This article {{explores the}} impact of the {{existing}} property rights regime over land and water on the sustainable and equitable management and use of these resources, in the context of changing irrigation practices in a paddy-growing area in the south-eastern part of the Palakkad district in Kerala, India. Since land rights determine rights to water in the area, the article discusses the changing rights regime over land, primarily after the implementation of land reforms in 1970. It shows how the implementation of land reforms and nationalization of private forests have paid little attention to the ecological context in which redistribution was taking place. As a result, while an agricultural-cum- forested landscape was divided into privately owned and government owned parcels, the ecological relationships between these different land use categories were ignored. In the same vein, land and water were treated as separate entities, with redistribution of land rights overlooking the distribution of water rights. The compartmentalized view of resources coupled with the consolidation of the private property regime has resulted in a situation where landowners exploit the resource without any consideration for its ecological characteristics and inter-resource linkages. The failure to view land and water in integration has precipitated inequitable access and unsustainable use of water. In addition, the availability of external water supplies and the introduction of energised <b>pumping</b> facilitate the <b>enclosure</b> of water within privately owned land parcels. The article concludes that a re-envisioning of rights to resources within the concerned ecological context is necessary if sustainable and equitable resource use and management are to be achieve...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} carry out deep {{excavations}} under the water table in urban environments, {{the safety of the}} work site and of the adjacent buildings is a major cause for concern. One of the most common and effective methods of undertaking these excavations involves combining the cut and cover method with a dewatering system. The success of a construction depends on the stability of the excavation bottom, the effects produced outside the excavation by dewatering (soil movements) and/or the state of the enclosure (defects in the diaphragm walls). This study proposes a realistic multidisciplinary procedure to address these issues. The work emphasizes the importance of soil characterisation and underlines the need to perform a Watertightness Assessment Test (WTAT) before the excavation stage. The procedure was applied to the excavation of a deep shaft of the High Speed Train (HST) tunnel in Barcelona. An earlier geological characterisation at large scale ruled out the use of deep pumping wells. However, a subsequent hydrogeological characterisation, which involved borehole logging, grain size analyses, Natural Gamma Ray and pumping tests, revealed the presence of thin transmissive layers inside the low hydraulic conductivity materials. The dewatering system was designed by considering different model scenarios and the safest design was selected for the excavation. Depths of the enclosure and of the pumping wells differed in accordance with the scenarios. The impacts (settlements due to pumping) and the stability in each scenario were computed. The state of the enclosure underwent a WTAT {{before the start of the}} excavation, but after constructing the enclosure, to verify its low permeability. The test consisted in <b>pumping</b> inside the <b>enclosure</b> and monitoring the groundwater behaviour outside the enclosure. Numerical interpretation of this test showed a defect in the diaphragm walls below the excavation bottom. Since this defect was not repaired because of its location (below the bottom of the excavation), the dewatering system had to be redesigned to ensure safety. Surface settlements, which were also a source of concern, were small. They were computed using coupled hydro-mechanical models. Peer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|R
