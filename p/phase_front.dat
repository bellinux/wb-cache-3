It turns out that AGWs with larger spatial scales have higher phase velocities, which {{are more likely to}} survive the journey from troposphere to ionosphere (e.g., Vadas 2007). Once the AGW reaches the F-region, LSWS must be produced by AGWs through some form of neutral-ion coupling, which likely involves a polarization E (e.g., Klostermeyer 1978).

Again, this is true only in the far field, defined as: Range = 2 D2 / λ where D is the maximum linear extent of the optical sources and λ is the wavelength (Scott 1998). The plane wave spectrum is often regarded as being discrete for certain types of periodic gratings, though in reality, the spectra from gratings are continuous as well, since no physical device can have the infinite extent required to produce a true line spectrum.|$|E

5000|$|A curved phasefront may be {{synthesized}} from {{an infinite}} number of these [...] "natural modes" [...] i.e., from plane wave phasefronts oriented in different directions in space. Far from its sources, an expanding spherical wave is locally tangent to a planar <b>phase</b> <b>front</b> (a single plane wave out of the infinite spectrum), which is transverse to the radial direction of propagation. In this case, a Fraunhofer diffraction pattern is created, which emanates from a single spherical wave phase center. In the near field, no single well-defined spherical wave phase center exists, so the wavefront isn't locally tangent to a spherical ball. In this case, a Fresnel diffraction pattern would be created, which emanates from an extended source, consisting of a distribution of (physically identifiable) spherical wave sources in space. In the near field, a full spectrum of plane waves is necessary to represent the Fresnel near-field wave, even locally. A [...] "wide" [...] wave moving forward (like an expanding ocean wave coming toward the shore) can be regarded as {{an infinite number}} of [...] "plane wave modes", all of which could (when they collide with something in the way) scatter independently of one other.

Fourier optics forms much of the theory behind image processing techniques, as well as finding applications where information needs to be extracted from optical sources such as in quantum optics. To put it in a slightly more complex way, similar to the concept of frequency and time used in traditional [...] Fourier transform theory, Fourier optics makes use of the spatial frequency domain (kx, ky) as the conjugate of the spatial (x, y) domain. Terms and concepts such as transform theory, spectrum, bandwidth, window functions and sampling from one-dimensional signal processing are commonly used.|$|E
