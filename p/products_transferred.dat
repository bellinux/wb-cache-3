40|$|Females of most {{animal species}} are usually inseminated {{by more than}} one male, which allows sperm from {{different}} males to compete for fertilization. To prevent invasion of sperm from other males, Drosophila males elicit a rejection behavior in their mates after copulation. Using paired mutant males that, for the lack of accessory glands, are sterile, we show that this rejection behavior is induced exclusively by the secreted accessory gland <b>products</b> <b>transferred</b> to the female during copulation. Moreover, the activities of sperm and accessory gland products are complementary and interdependent: both sperm fertility and rejection behavior depend on accessory gland products whose prolonged activities, in turn, require the presence of sperm. Fertility of sperm from paired males can be restored by accessory gland products of spermless males in “copulation complementation” experiments. Our observations may have important implications for the role of sexual behavior in evolution and for the treatment of male sexual dysfunction in humans...|$|E

40|$|There is {{considerable}} merit in {{thinking of the}} modern multidivisional corporation as an economy within itself. There is an important similarity between the interaction of divisions within a corporation and the perfectly competitive economic model formulated by Leon Walras 1. When we look at modern corporations from this viewpoint we discover {{that much of what}} we know in general equilibrium economics may have considerable application inside modern corporations. Some of our existing theorems help clarify distinctions between decentralization and central control in corporate management {{in the same way that}} they clarify the distinctions between the market economies and those that run by central decree. They help distinguish which divisions must be centrally managed and those which can be left to look after themselves. This viewpoint offers new insights too—that, for instance, the <b>products</b> <b>transferred</b> between divisions may quite logically have two transfer prices instead of one. This viewpoint also permits an easy synthesis of the existing literature on transfer pricing. While the transfer pricing issue is especially important for multinational and international corporations which transfer goods and services between divisions located in different countries, the principles generally apply to any multidivisional corporation. The purposes of this paper are to present a simple, but general analytic model of the multidivisional corporation, to use it to make a synthesis of the existing literature on transfer pricing, and to make some important new discoveries. ...|$|E
40|$|Seminal <b>products</b> <b>transferred</b> during {{copulation}} {{can have}} substantial effects on females, including accelerated oviposition, decreased mating receptivity and shorter life span. This study addresses {{two sets of}} hypotheses about ingested seminal products: (1) whether they act as nutrition or have effects like those of seminal proteins and (2) whether they harm females (implying sexual conflict). We studied the ladybird beetle Adalia bipunctata, the females of which consume a spermatophore after mating. To {{examine the effect of}} spermatophore feeding on short-term reproduction, we combined a spermatophore treatment (allowing or preventing ingestion) with a diet manipulation. If spermatophores serve only as food, then low-food females are expected to show the strongest response; if spermatophores contain signalling proteins, the effect should be of similar magnitude across food treatments. Feeding on a single spermatophore affected females in two ways. The 'allow' group oviposited significantly faster than the 'prevent' group, but this response was independent of female diet, suggesting that spermatophores act as signals rather than as nutrition. In a second experiment, spermatophore consumption increased female remating resistance. In a long-term experiment, the continued ingestion of multiple spermatophores had no detectable effect on female life span, lifetime reproductive success or lifetime remating behaviour. The absence of such costs does not support the hypothesis of sexual conflict over spermatophore ingestion. Overall, the results imply that spermatophores have a signalling function but provide little, if any, nutritional value or long-term effect on fitness. Direct evidence that spermatophore function is shaped by sexually antagonistic coevolution is still lacking. © 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The X-Ray Photoelectron Spectrometry (XPS) and Auger Electrons Spectroscopy (AES) {{analysis}} of PVD coatings were performed for samples, made from cemented carbides, cermets and composite gradient tool materials. Design/methodology/approach: The Ti(C,N) gradient coating was investigated by XPS and AES method with multifunctional PHI 5700 / 660 spectrometer. The characteristic of surface region coating were determined from XPS depth profile. The transition region between Ti(C,N) coating and substrate was analyzed by AES method as line profile. Findings: The coating consists mainly of TiC and TiN compound. The oxygen impurities of investigated coating is below 2 %. The “fresh” surface of Ti(C,N) coating {{is covered by}} thin films TiO 2. There was observed homogeneous distribution of carbon, titanium and nitrogen elements in the surface region. The ratio of C/N obtained for surface region is characteristic for deposited coating. The transition region is also homogeneous between coating and cermet substrate. Practical implications: PVD deposition techniques {{making it possible to}} obtain surface layers with the varying thickness values, respectively, with the structure changing across the layer depth along with the change of its chemical or phase compositions for improvement of its properties, and especially for the advantageous combination of the very high abrasion wear resistance of the surface along with the relatively high ductility of the core of materials used for, respectively, blanking tools and for hot working, profile cutting tools with ductility high enough and for the heavy duty very high speed cutting tools. Originality/value: Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) are an excellent tools for performing surface analysis and for determining elemental composition as a function of depth. AES or XPS analyzes the residual surface left after a certain sputtering time with rare gas ions. In this way composition depth profiles can be obtained that provide a powerful means for analyzing worked layers, modified layers, thin films, multiple-layered coatings, lubricants, reaction film <b>products,</b> <b>transferred</b> films, and their interfaces...|$|E

This potential has still to be fully exploited. European Aluminium foundry industry is now facing the challenge of transforming itself into a quality/efficiency-driven and integration-oriented sector. This target requires the achievement of several intermediate objectives, such as {{the development of new}} and advanced Standards and Technical Reports, supporting a systematic improvement in design and production of high quality and highly performing cast components. This is the scenario in which the EU financed StaCast project (FP 7 -NMP- 2012 -CSA- 6, Grant n. 319188) has been carried out, with the joint effort of University of Padova (Italy), Aalen Hochschule Technik und Wirtschaft (Germany), Trondheim Norges Universitet (Norway), Associazione Italiana di Metallurgia (Italy), Assomet Servizi (Italy), and Federation of Aluminium Consumers Europe (Belgium). The acronym StaCast means “New Quality and Design Standards for Aluminium Alloys Cast Products”, and the Project has been focussed on - a public survey of EU Aluminium foundries, to understand their more relevant characteristics, particularly for what concerns quality and standardisation issues, - the development of a reliable classification of defects and imperfections in Al Alloys cast <b>products,</b> <b>transferred</b> to CEN (European Committee for Stardardisation) as an official Technical Report, - the development of a procedure for the evaluation of mechanical potential of Aluminium-based foundry alloys, transferred to CEN (European Committee for Stardardisation) as an official Technical Report, - the elaboration of engineering guidelines for the mechanical design of Al alloys castings.

40|$|Abstract Background Genes {{involved}} in post-mating processes of multiple mating organisms {{are known to}} evolve rapidly due to coevolution driven by sexual conflict among male-female interacting proteins. In the malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae - a monandrous species in which sexual conflict {{is expected to be}} absent or minimal - recent data strongly suggest that proteolytic enzymes specifically expressed in the female lower reproductive tissues are {{involved in}} the processing of male <b>products</b> <b>transferred</b> to females during mating. In order to better understand the role of selective forces underlying the evolution of proteins involved in post-mating responses, we analysed a cluster of genes encoding for three serine proteases that are down-regulated after mating, two of which specifically expressed in the atrium and one in the spermatheca of A. gambiae females. Results The analysis of polymorphisms and divergence of these female-expressed proteases in closely related species of the A. gambiae complex revealed a high level of replacement polymorphisms consistent with relaxed evolutionary constraints of duplicated genes, allowing to rapidly fix novel replacements to perform new or more specific functions. Adaptive evolution was detected in several codons of the 3 genes and hints of episodic selection were also found. In addition, the structural modelling of these proteases highlighted some important differences in their substrate specificity, and provided evidence that a number of sites evolving under selective pressures lie relatively close to the catalytic triad and/or {{on the edge of the}} specificity pocket, known to be involved in substrate recognition or binding. The observed patterns suggest that these proteases may interact with factors transferred by males during mating (e. g. substrates, inhibitors or pathogens) and that they may have differently evolved in independent A. gambiae lineages. Conclusions Our results - also examined in light of constraints in the application of selection-inference methods to the closely related species of the A. gambiae complex - reveal an unexpectedly intricate evolutionary scenario. Further experimental analyses are needed to investigate the biological functions of these genes in order to better interpret their molecular evolution and to assess whether they represent possible targets for limiting the fertility of Anopheles mosquitoes in malaria vector control strategies. </p...|$|E
40|$|From {{the studies}} of the {{ontogeny}} of the seed plants and the true ferns the different characters in these two groups are summarized in Table 1. [Table] The supposed phylogenetic original plants composed under the consideration of those characters listed in Table I are as follows : 1. That of the ferns resembles the prothallium of the living ones. The cell division occurs when the nucleus divides in the cell, making uninuclear multicelullar filament first, leaving a growing point {{at the tip of}} the body. After a little while it grows 2 -dimentionally due to the division of the growing point cell by terns, producing the cells of the thallus. Semiterraneus. The reproductive cells are zoospores. 2. That of the seed plant resembles the seedling of the living seed plant, composed of a stalk and a leafy upper portion. The initial cell developes first as the multinuclear cell, then to the uninuclear multicellular thallus. Subterraneus. The reproductive cells are swarm spores. In the later phylogenetic stage there appeared different kinds of sexual reproduction in the above two, which induced the alternation of the n-(gametophyte) and 2 n-(sporophyte) generations, the terraneus habit, the differentiation of the vascular bundles, the spore formation in the sporophyte generation, and the resting type spores in the fern plants, while the parasitic type in the seed plants. Now we can find out the resemblances of those two types in the item 1 and 2 in the living green algae, belonging to different systematic types. They suggest to us that the seed plants and the ferns derived from different ancestors and were parallel existences in the phylogenetic ages having no implication between them. In Table 1 we can find out that there we can trace back the cause of the differences of many characters in both groups into the protoplasmic character in their initial cells. And the latter more importantly leads the writer to consider that such fundamental character as that which concerns to the protoplasmic behaviours conducting the ontogeny in such large group as the seed plants could not be derived from such a differentiated group as the ferns. As for the common characters in them, (1) they have similar type chloroplasts. However, we can find out a similar case in the green algae as well as in the green plants in other systematic groups. It is one of certain universal characters with certain broad distributions in the plant kingdom; (2) they have vascular bundle, which is considered an important character by which they are classified in the same group as the vascular plants, but it looks to the writer that this character is not a unique one in these two groups; it appears in the moss, though very primitive, and the sieve tube develops in the brown algae such as laminaria. Thus the cause of the appearance of the vascular bundles is to be considered as the results of the plant body developed 3 -dimentionally and thickened in the 2 n-generation due to the doubling of the nuclear phase, namely there appears a part in the center of the body, where the light can not reach from the outside so that the cells can not develop as the synthetic tissue and also there accumurate the synthetic <b>products</b> <b>transferred</b> from the differentiated synthetic tissue outside; thus there developes the reserving tissue, then conductive sieve cells or tubes. The self-digestion in certain cells among those reserve cells may cause the xylem elements. The latter may be the ones which were induced by the terrestrial habit. In short the possibilities of the appearance of the reserve or conductive tissue exist in several different kinds of the plant groups, and the terrestrial habit forced the development of the tendencies. Consequently the presence of these two common characters can not be recognized as the direct proof of the assumption that the ferns and seed plants have the intimate phylogenetic relationship. Here the writer wishes to say that in the field of the phylogenetic studies we have to consider more details from the comparative studies of the ontogeny in the plants, and we have to select in this field the different standards from those in {{the studies of}} the derivation of certain small groups or some organs in the living things...|$|E
