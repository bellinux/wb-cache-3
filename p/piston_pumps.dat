25|$|The exact {{amount of}} water needed for the dough depends on the final shape of the pasta. Long pastas should have less {{moisture}} content (and therefore less water) so {{they will be able}} to stretch during the extrusion. Short pastas need less moisture content due to rapid cutting. Various dosing systems are used to pump the water to the mixture. The most common ones are <b>piston</b> <b>pumps</b> in which the water flow rate is controlled by adjusting the piston stroke, screw feeder, and gear and lobe pumps where the speed of the rotation determines the water flow. In more advanced systems, electronic devices are used to regulate the water flow.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the capital}} outlay can be high, it is {{desirable}} to use a meter-mix or dispense unit for even low-volume production operations that require a steady output of finished parts. Dispense equipment consists of material holding (day) tanks, metering pumps, a mix head, and a control unit. Often, a conditioning or heater-chiller unit is added to control material temperature {{in order to improve}} mix efficiency, cure rate, and to reduce process variability. Choice of dispense equipment components depends on shot size, throughput, material characteristics such as viscosity and filler content, and process control. Material day tanks may be single to hundreds of gallons in size, and may be supplied directly from drums, IBCs (intermediate bulk containers, such as totes), or bulk storage tanks. They may incorporate level sensors, conditioning jackets, and mixers. Pumps can be sized to meter in single grams per second up to hundreds of pounds per minute. They can be rotary, gear, or <b>piston</b> <b>pumps,</b> or can be specially hardened lance pumps to meter liquids containing highly abrasive fillers such as chopped or hammer milled glass fibres and wollastonite.|$|E

2500|$|There {{are several}} types of pump mechanisms. <b>Piston</b> <b>pumps</b> draw a piston through a {{cylinder}} to create suction. These are generally considered top-of-the-line units. They have characteristics of low speed, high reliability, low noise, and long life. [...] Rotary vane pumps use a cam with retractable vanes to create suction. These rotary vane pumps are not widely used anymore. Fast diaphragm pumps use a diaphragm that is acted on by a lever, with thousands of cycles per minute. They operate at higher speed and are usually noisier. Slow diaphragm pumps use a large diaphragm operated by a cam or lever to generate suction with each stroke. [...] Pumps have also been designed that use venturi effects powered by a faucet or water stream, wall suction in hospitals, or pumps powered by oral suctioning.|$|E

50|$|As {{for later}} Dennis fire engines, the water pump was a {{centrifugal}} pump, {{rather than the}} <b>piston</b> <b>pumps</b> used by other makers.

A drawback of the usual centrifugal design was the considerable axial force generated by the pump impeller, requiring a thrust bearing.

40|$|Aiming at the {{existing}} problems of traditional water <b>piston</b> <b>pump</b> {{used in the}} naval ship, such as low efficiency, high noise, large vibration, and nonintelligent control, {{a new type of}} linear-motor-driven water <b>piston</b> <b>pump</b> is developed and its vibration characteristics are analyzed in this research. Based on the 3 D model of the structure, the simulation analyses including static stress analysis, modal analysis, and harmonic response analysis are conducted. The simulation results reveal that the mode shape under low frequency stage is mainly associated with the eccentricity swing of the piston rod. The vibration experiment results show that the resonance frequency of linear-motor-driven water <b>piston</b> <b>pump</b> is concentrated upon 500 [*]Hz and 800 [*]Hz in the low frequency range. The dampers can change the resonance frequency of the system to a certain extent.
