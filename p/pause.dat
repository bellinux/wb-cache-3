40|$|Although pre-ratio <b>pausing</b> is a {{characteristic}} feature of fixedratio (FR) schedules of reinforcement, <b>pausing</b> reduces the rate atwhich reinforcement is earned. To determine whether FR pausingcan be altered, 7 rats were studied with procedures in which longpauses were punished with time-out from reinforcement. A generalfinding was that <b>pausing</b> is modifiable. However, tendencies to pausewere highly resistant to change, {{and for some}} animals under someconditions efforts to reduce <b>pausing</b> were unsuccessful. Moreover,despite the fact that reduced <b>pausing</b> was accompanied by increasedreinforcement rates, long <b>pauses</b> resumed when the punishmentcontingency was removed.

40|$|This {{empirical}} study {{explores the}} characteristics of and motivations for <b>pauses</b> in Chinese-English (C-E) simultaneous interpreting (SI). The {{data were collected from}} a simultaneous interpreting task in which five expert interpreters and five trainee interpreters interpreted an authentic speech from Chinese into English. A bilingual corpus was built comprising transcripts of the speech and the interpretations and <b>pauses</b> were codified for analysis. Retrospective interviews were conducted to stimulate subjects' recall of their motivations for unnatural <b>pauses</b> in SI production. The major findings are: First, <b>pauses</b> are less frequent but longer in C-E simultaneous interpreting than in the original speech. Second, there is a hierarchical distribution of <b>pauses</b> corresponding to syntactic complexity, except that <b>pauses</b> inside phrases are disproportionately frequent. Third, major motivations for unnatural <b>pauses</b> in C-E simultaneous interpreting can be attributed to SI-specific strategies such as waiting, formulating and restructuring. Fourth, compared with trainees, expert interpreters have fewer and shorter <b>pauses</b> and their <b>pauses</b> tend to be more appropriate and occur mainly at major syntactic junctions. Although both groups share major motivations for unnatural <b>pauses,</b> expert interpreters have remarkably fewer <b>pauses</b> due to formulating, waiting, conceptualising and split attention but more <b>pauses</b> due to monitoring and adoption of strategies.

50|$|Schachter et al.

These findings suggest that the greater the number of word choices, the more frequent are the <b>pauses,</b> and hence the <b>pauses</b> serve to allow us time to choose our words.|$|R

5|$|The family uses {{a number}} of {{techniques}} to obtain prey. The majority of antbirds are arboreal, with most of those feeding in the understory, many in the middle story and some in the canopy. A few species feed in the leaf litter; for example, the wing-banded antbird forages in areas of dense leaf-litter. It does not use its feet to scratch the leaf litter, as do some other birds; instead it uses its long bill to turn over leaves rapidly (never picking them up). The antbirds that forage arboreally show {{a number of}} techniques and specialisations. Some species perch-glean, perching on a branch watching for prey and snatching it by reaching forward, where others sally from a perch and snatch prey on the wing. In both cases birds will hop through the foliage or undergrowth and <b>pause,</b> scanning for prey, before pouncing or moving on. The time paused varies, although smaller species {{tend to be more}} active and <b>pause</b> for shorter times.|$|E
5000|$|A {{sentence}} like (1) {{will not}} typically be produced with the <b>pauses</b> indicated in (2), where the <b>pauses</b> [...] "interrupt" [...] syntactic constituents. For example, <b>pausing</b> between the and dog would interrupt the noun phrase (DP) constituent, as would <b>pausing</b> between his and hand. Most often, <b>pauses</b> are placed {{so as to}} group the utterance into chunks that correspond to the beginnings and ends of constituents such as noun phrases (DPs), verb phrases (VPs), and prepositional phrases (PPs). As a result, sentences like (3), where the <b>pauses</b> correspond to syntactic constituents, are much more natural.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to clarify {{different}} interpretations of <b>pauses</b> by Japanese, Chinese and Americans and to see their different responses and reactions to <b>pauses</b> during natural conversations. Also this study is to see who <b>pauses</b> most during the conversation, how differently each person from different socio-cultural background responds and reacts to each other's <b>pauses,</b> and how differently they interpret each other's <b>pauses.</b> The data is taken from the three groups (Group A, B, and C). Each group consisted of two Americans and two Japanese, two Americans and two Japanese, two Chinese and two Japanese, respectively. In all data, the participants spoke in English. The general findings are: 1) Americans and Chinese/Japanese have different perspective on <b>pauses.</b> 2) Americans try to fill the gaps during the conversation and while only Americans are talking, few <b>pauses</b> are found. 3) Chinese and Japanese do not mind long <b>pauses.</b> These different perspectives of <b>pauses</b> caused uneasiness and discomfort during the conversation. Consequently, different perception of <b>pauses</b> will generally develop unsuccessful management of communication. The result will contribute to prevent this kind of misperception. ...|$|R

40|$|The frequency, {{duration}} {{and distribution of}} <b>pauses</b> in French were investigated acousti-cally in three types of speech styles: political interviews and casual interviews, which belong to spontaneous speech, and political speeches, which are carefully prepared. The speech samples were subdivided into articulated sequences, silent <b>pauses,</b> and non-silent <b>pauses.</b> The total time of silent <b>pauses</b> was 50 % greater in political speeches than in either type of interview. It appears {{to be one of}} the characteristics of political speeches. In all three styles, the distribution of silent <b>pauses</b> was generally correlated with the syntactic structure of the sentence. Most of the time, these <b>pauses</b> occurred at clause or phrase boundaries. In political speeches, however, their frequency was greater and their duration longer. Some of these <b>pauses,</b> particularly the long ones, must have a predominantly stylistic function. In inter-views, non-silent <b>pauses</b> were frequent and long, particularly in casual interviews, whereas they were almost completely absent in political speeches. These results confirm previous studies that involve other languages as well, and investigate the syntactic distribution of <b>pauses</b> and the importance of hesitation in spontaneous speech; they open onto a new research area concerned with the stylistic function of <b>pauses...</b>|$|R
30|$|Filled <b>pauses</b> {{are common}} in {{everyday}} spontaneous speech and generally do not hamper communication.

US President Barack Obama is praised by the media for his oratory skills whereas former President George W. Bush is considered as not a very proficient speaker. This study investigated whether being a good speaker, like Obama, correlates with his use of filled and unfilled <b>pauses</b> in speeches and interviews. A speech and interview for both Bush and Obama were analysed by means of Praat. The results showed that Bush uses more unfilled <b>pauses</b> but less filled <b>pauses</b> than Obama. Thus, the use of <b>pauses</b> does not suffice as a variable on its own...|$|R

40|$|<b>Pausing</b> {{during the}} {{transcription}} of MDV- 1 cDNA by Escherichia coli RNA polymerase was compared with <b>pausing</b> during the replication of MDV- 1 RNA by Q 6 replicase. MDV- 1 RNA {{is able to}} form many strong hairpin structures, and Q 6 replicase <b>pauses</b> after the synthesis of each [Mills et al. (1978) Cell 15, 541 - 550]. Although the transcripts were virtually identical to MDV- 1 RNA, the locations at which RNA polymerase <b>paused</b> were different and apparently were not related to sequences that can form hairpins. These results indicate that hairpin stability, per se, cannot be used to predict the occurrence of <b>pausing</b> during transcription. Four <b>pauses</b> that occur within a 5 -nucleotide region were studied in detail. Insertions and deletions {{were made in the}} template DNA to determine the contribution made by the surrounding sequences to these <b>pauses.</b> The results indicate that some of the <b>pauses</b> require the presence of particular upstream sequences, while others are unaffected by the template modifications.

40|$|Readers or {{speakers}} {{of a particular}} language break up sentences into lexical/syntactic entities while reading or speaking. <b>Pausing,</b> being one indispensible characteristic of this process, forms a basis for this study. President Obama‘s address at the G- 20 summit was analyzed in terms of intrasentential <b>pausing</b> strategies with due focus on duration of <b>pauses</b> preceding and following the that complementizer in noun and adjective type that-clauses. Recordings of the speech were analyzed in two separate parts: (1) the first part - assumed as pre-prepared and thus considered as read speech, and the second – question/answer session –considered as spontaneous speech. <b>Pauses</b> were measured in milliseconds utilizing Goldwave™, the sound analyzing software, and later, a comparison was carried out between <b>pauses</b> in the two speech types to observe any potential differences and/or similarities. Overall findings obtained reveal that while preceding <b>pauses</b> in read speech were significantly longer than following ones, in spontaneous speech, however, the difference was statistically insignificant. One interesting outcome {{was found to be}} clause-type specific, in that while preceding <b>pauses</b> regarding adjective clauses were considerably longer than following <b>pauses</b> in read speech, with noun clauses, however, the difference was insignificant.
