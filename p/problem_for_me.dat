500|$|However, in 1993, Jackson told Oprah Winfrey [...] "there, as I know of, {{there is}} no such thing as skin bleaching. [...] I've never seen it, I don't know what it is." [...] It was in this {{interview}} that Jackson stated he had a skin disorder (vitiligo) and also stated that the disorder was hereditary, rather than something he caused; he also said he used make-up to even out the uneven skin tone. [...] "It is something I cannot help," [...] explained Jackson. [...] "When people make up stories that I don't want to be who I am, it hurts me. It's a <b>problem</b> <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> I can't control it. But what about all the millions of people who sit in the sun to become darker, to become other than what they are. Nobody says nothing about that." [...] Winfrey's interview of Jackson was watched by 62million Americans. It also started a public discourse on the topic of vitiligo, a relatively unknown condition before then.|$|E
500|$|Jackson's {{skin had}} been a medium-brown color during his youth, but from the mid-1980s {{gradually}} grew paler. The change gained widespread media coverage, including rumors {{that he might have}} been bleaching his skin. According to J. Randy Taraborrelli's biography, Jackson was diagnosed with vitiligo in 1984; vitiligo results in white patches on the skin. Although Jackson was diagnosed with vitiligo, Taraborrelli stated that Jackson had been skin bleaching. He said that Jackson was diagnosed with lupus, and that while the vitiligo partially lightened Jackson's skin, the lupus was in remission. Both illnesses made Jackson's skin sensitive to sunlight. The treatments Jackson used for his condition further lightened his skin, and, with the application of pancake makeup to even out blotches he could appear pale. Jackson stated that although he used makeup to control the patchy appearance of his skin, he never purposely bleached his skin. He said of his vitiligo: [...] "It is something I cannot help. When people make up stories that I don't want to be who I am, it hurts me. It's a <b>problem</b> <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> I can't control it." [...] Jackson was also diagnosed with vitiligo in his autopsy, though not lupus.|$|E

I nevertheless begin this way because I believe that a careful re-examination of the narrow constitutional issues raised by § 13 will yield important insights into larger and much debated issues of constitutional law.

40|$|My goal in {{this chapter}} of lecture notes is to {{introduce}} the basic notions of a statistical model and an algebraic variety and show how they are related to one another. The title “Statistical Models are Algebraic Varieties” could {{be considered as a}} mantra of algebraic statistics. It is the ubiquity of the polynomial structures that arise when describing statistical models that makes some statistical problems amenable to algebraic techniques. The algebraic perspective on statistical models provides a number of interesting applications, which I will discuss in more detail in later chapters. The goal of this chapter is only to show that it is not so far fetched to think that algebra could be useful in statistics by illustrating that a number of elementary statistical models have the structure of an algebraic variety. On a more pragmatic note, this chapter will also serve as a primary place to introduce much of the terminology and notation that will be used {{throughout the rest of the}} lecture notes. But what is algebraic statistics? I am sure that the answer will vary greatly depending on who is asked. In the broadest possible sense, algebraic statistics is merely the study of the algebraic structures underlying statistical inference. Which algebraic structures are emphasized will vary greatly from person to person. The focus of my research in this area has been on the ways that algebraic geometry and the ensuing commutative algebra and combinatorics arise in statistical inference, and so I will tend to focus on these aspects in these lecture notes. Of course, one cannot talk about everything so I will have to leave out lots of interesting results. Why study algebraic statistics? Again, the answer will vary greatly depending on who is asked. Algebraic statistics is certainly not a magic bullet to solve all statistical <b>problems.</b> <b>For</b> <b>me,</b> the approach has always been to merely try to understand a statistical problem by looking through algebraic glasses. At the end of the day, this new point of view may lead to new algebraic solutions to statistical problems. It might explain unusual phenomena that statisticians observe. It might lead to purely mathematical problems, interesting in their own right, that are not informative for statistics. It might lead to a unifying framework for discussing and exploring many related statistical problems...|$|R
