6000|$|Did Alonzo {{give her}} up? Not he. He said to himself, [...] "She will sing that sweet song {{when she is}} sad; I shall find her." [...] So he took his carpet-sack and a <b>portable</b> <b>telephone,</b> and shook the snow of his native city from his arctics, and went forth into the world. He wandered far and wide and in many states. Time and again, strangers were astounded to see a wasted, pale, and woe-worn man laboriously climb a telegraph-pole in wintry and lonely places, perch sadly there an hour, with his ear at a little box, then come sighing down, and wander wearily away. Sometimes they shot at him, as peasants do at aeronauts, {{thinking}} him mad and dangerous. Thus his clothes were much shredded by bullets and his person grievously lacerated. But he bore it all patiently.|$|E

Lighting a cigarette; then, bound to the telephone with no ashtray in reach, wondering what to do with this burning menace and anxiously trying to toss it into the tiled bathroom. At last, on the telephone, [...] "No message, eh? All right, I'll call up again." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{aim of this}} paper, a {{comparative}} study of several antennas commonly used in <b>portable</b> <b>telephones</b> is investigated. These include a monopole, a helical, a patch and a PIFA antenna. Each one of these structures is modelled and numerically tested using CST Microwave Studio. The testing procedure involves antenna simulation in {{the proximity of the}} human head and hand. The behavior of each antenna is evaluated for variable distances from the head geometry (0 - 20 mm). The simulation outputs used as measures for this comparative study include the specific absorption rate (SAR). The computed SAR levels within each of the considered tissues vary for the four antennas under investigation and are within the determined health safety standards.

50|$|The {{most common}} {{example of a}} {{cellular}} network is a mobile phone (cell phone) network.

50|$|Historically {{telephones}} {{were typically}} {{owned by the}} telephone company and were usually permanently wired to the telephone line. However, for many installations it was necessary or convenient to provide <b>portable</b> <b>telephone</b> sets that could be moved to a different location within the customer's premises. For this purpose telephone companies developed jacks and plugs with a varying number of contacts. Before ca. 1930, concentric connectors with three contacts were sufficient, but the upgrade of telephone sets to anti-sidetone circuitry required four conductors between the desk set and the subscriber set. For this purpose, Bell System engineers developed a cube-shaped four-prong plug (type No. 238) with uneven prong spacings to avoid improper insertion into the jack (type No. 404). This jack and plug combination later became the standard line connection for <b>portable</b> <b>telephone</b> sets.|$|E
5000|$|A {{cordless}} telephone or <b>portable</b> <b>telephone</b> is a telephone {{in which the}} handset is portable and communicates with {{the body of the}} phone by radio, instead of being attached by a cord. The base station is connected to the telephone network through a telephone line as a corded telephone is, and also serves as a charger to charge the handset's batteries. The range is limited, usually to the same building or some short distance from the base station.|$|E

50|$|Cellphone - a <b>portable</b> <b>telephone</b> that is {{connected}} to the telephone network by radio signals exchanged with a local antenna called a cell tower. Cellphones have highly automated digital receivers working in the UHF and microwave band that receive the incoming side of the duplex voice channel, as well as a control channel that handles dialing calls and switching the phone between cell towers. They usually also have several other receivers that connect them with other networks: a WiFi modem, a bluetooth modem, and a GPS receiver. The cell tower has sophisticated multichannel receivers that receive the signals from many cell phones simultaneously.|$|E

The race to create truly <b>portable</b> <b>telephone</b> devices began after World War II, with developments taking place in many countries. The advances in mobile telephony have been traced in successive [...] "generations", starting with the early zeroth-generation (0G) services, such as Bell System's Mobile Telephone Service and its successor, the Improved Mobile Telephone Service.

50|$|A {{mobile phone}} is a <b>portable</b> <b>telephone</b> {{that can make}} and receive calls over a radio {{frequency}} link while the user is moving within a telephone service area. The radio frequency link establishes {{a connection to the}} switching systems of a mobile phone operator, which provides access to the public switched telephone network (PSTN). Modern mobile telephone services use a cellular network architecture, and, therefore, mobile telephones are often also called cellular telephones or cell phones. In addition to telephony, 2000s-era mobile phones support a variety of other services, such as text messaging, MMS, email, Internet access, short-range wireless communications (infrared, Bluetooth), business applications, gaming, and digital photography. Mobile phones which offer these and more general computing capabilities are referred to as smartphones.|$|E

The other block of wood supported a horseshoe magnet made of two toy magnets.

The pattern of electrical currents generated by the spool of wire related to a person's voice spoken into the mouthpiece.|$|E

Warren believes the crypt may contain evidence that could confirm some of his speculations (details of these speculations are never revealed, but {{it is said that}} Warren recently read a mysterious book written in an unknown language about incorruptibility of the dead). Upon reaching the cemetery, Carter and Warren uncover the crypt by lifting an immense granite slab, revealing a set of stone steps leading downward into the earth. Warren insists that Carter remain at the surface. He descends the steps alone, but remains in communication with Carter via a <b>portable</b> <b>telephone</b> set. Shortly thereafter he tells Carter that he has discovered a monstrous unbelievable secret and pleads with his companion to replace the stone and run for his life. When Carter asks what he has found, his queries are initially met with silence and then by the voice of an unknown entity who informs him that Warren is dead.

40|$|It {{is shown}} that the quasi-normal modes arise, in a natural way, when {{considering}} the oscillations in unbounded regions by imposing the radiation condition at spatial infinity with a complex wave vector k.

It is proposed to consider the space form of the quasi-normal modes with allowance for their time dependence. As a result, the problem of their unbounded increase when r→∞ is not encountered more. The properties of quasi-normal modes of a compact dielectric sphere are discussed in detail.
