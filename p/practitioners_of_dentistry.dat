40|$|This 40 -minute {{video is}} {{intended}} for <b>practitioners</b> <b>of</b> <b>dentistry,</b> medicine, nursing and public health {{who are responsible for}} diagnosing and referring patients with head and neck and oral cancer. Approximately 31, 000 cases of oral, head and neck cancer are diagnosed in the United States yearly and about 25 % of these patients died from their disease. 1.) The preponderance of these tumors represent squamous cell carcinoma of the oral mucous membranes. The combined five-year survival rate in the United States is approximately 57 percent. 2.) A squamous cell carcinoma found in stage 1 has a five year prognosis of 95 % while the same tumor diagnosed in stage 4 has a five year prognosis of approximately 20 %. The purpose of this video is to provide the practitioner with the baseline skills to diagnose and refer patients with head and neck and oral cancer at the earliest possible time. Dentists and physicians (students and licensed practitioners) will have a means of providing patients with a complete head and neck and oral examination. This will allow these cancers to be diagnosed at the earliest possible time, thereby increasing the prognosis and decreasing morbidity and mortality...|$|E

40|$|D IAGNOSIS {{is the art}} {{and science}} of {{recognizing}} the presence and nature of disease by an evaluation of its various distinctive signs, symptoms and characteristics. As modern rational therapy {{is based upon the}} scientific inter-pretation of the changes in structure and function of the body tissues the im-portancc of an accurate diagnosis is at once evident. There can be only one true diagnosis and the success of treatment is dependent upon its establish-ment. Therefore, in our endeavor to render the best possible service to the patient every known method should be employed, if necessary, in making an accurate diagnosis. The character of oral surgery practice is changing rapidly because of con-sistently greater demands being made by the health service professions and the laity. The field is extensive and in its scope is not unlike other specialized fields in medicine including ophthalmology, otolaryngology, obstetrics, and gen-eral surgery. An unusual amount of training and specialized skill are required to diagnose and treat diseases of the oral cavity, and for this reason it is not practical for the general <b>practitioners</b> <b>of</b> medicine or <b>dentistry</b> to have a ver...|$|R
