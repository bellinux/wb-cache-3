Ancient sources indicate that the Sudanic archers favored one-piece bows that were between six and seven feet long, with so powerful a draw strength that many of the archers used their feet to bend their bows. Although composite types saw some use, the Greek historian Herodotus (circa 450-420BC) indicates <b>primary</b> <b>bow</b> construction was of seasoned palm wood, with the arrows made of cane. Other sources describe intense encounters between African archers and a variety of enemies. Such fighting men were not an uncommon sight on battlefields or royal courts throughout the Mediterranean and Middle East. There is some indication that the arrows of Sudanic bowmen (including those fighting Rome) were often poison-tipped, a technique used elsewhere by Africa's archers, well into the 19th century. Among the Meriotic forces facing Rome, elephants were still occasionally used in war. Later Sudanic based forces like the Blemmye also deployed horses and camels for their raids over the Egyptian frontier, and the poisoned arrow tactics of their predecessors found ready employment.|$|E

50|$|Descartes' 1637 treatise, Discourse on Method, further {{advanced}} this explanation. Knowing {{that the size}} of raindrops did not appear to affect the observed rainbow, he experimented with passing rays of light through a large glass sphere filled with water. By measuring the angles that the rays emerged, he concluded that the <b>primary</b> <b>bow</b> was caused by a single internal reflection inside the raindrop and that a secondary bow could be caused by two internal reflections. He supported this conclusion with a derivation of the law of refraction (subsequently to, but independently of, Snell) and correctly calculated the angles for both bows. His explanation of the colours, however, was based on a mechanical version of the traditional theory that colours were produced by a modification of white light.|$|E
50|$|In certain circumstances, one {{or several}} narrow, faintly {{coloured}} bands {{can be seen}} bordering the violet edge of a rainbow; i.e., inside the <b>primary</b> <b>bow</b> or, much more rarely, outside the secondary. These extra bands are called supernumerary rainbows or supernumerary bands; together with the rainbow itself the phenomenon {{is also known as}} a stacker rainbow. The supernumerary bows are slightly detached from the main bow, become successively fainter along with their distance from it, and have pastel colours (consisting mainly of pink, purple and green hues) rather than the usual spectrum pattern. The effect becomes apparent when water droplets are involved that have a diameter of about 1 mm or less; the smaller the droplets are, the broader the supernumerary bands become, and the less saturated their colours. Due to their origin in small droplets, supernumerary bands tend to be particularly prominent in fogbows.|$|E

5000|$|Secondary rainbows {{are caused}} by a double {{reflection}} of sunlight inside the raindrops, and are centred on the sun itself. They are about 127° (violet) to 130° (red) wide. Since {{this is more than}} 90°, they are seen {{on the same side of}} the sky as the primary rainbow, about 10° above it at apparent angles of 50-53°. As a result of the [...] "inside" [...] of the secondary bow being [...] "up" [...] to the observer, the colours appear reversed compared to the <b>primary</b> <b>bow.</b> The secondary rainbow is fainter than the primary because more light escapes from two reflections compared to one and because the rainbow itself is spread over a greater area of the sky.

40|$|The {{knowledge}} on the optics of fogbows is scarce, and their polarization characteristics {{have never been}} measured to our knowledge. To fill this gap we measured the polarization features of 16 fogbows during the Beringia 2005 Arctic polar research expedition by imaging polarimetry in the red, green and blue spectral ranges. We present here the first polarization patterns of the fogbow. In the patterns {{of the degree of}} linear polarization p, fogbows and their supernumerary bows are best visible in the red spectral range due to the least dilution of fogbow light by light scattered in air. In the patterns of the angle of polarization α fogbows are practically not discernible because their α-pattern is {{the same as that of}} the sky: the direction of polarization is perpendicular to the plane of scattering and is parallel to the arc of the bow, independently of the wavelength. Fogbows and their supernumeraries were best seen in the patterns of the polarized radiance. In these patterns the angular distance δ between the peaks of the primary and the first supernumerary and the angular width σ of the <b>primary</b> <b>bow</b> were determined along different radii from the center of the bow. δ ranged between 6. 08 ° and 13. 41 °, while σ changed from 5. 25 ° to 19. 47 °. Certain fogbows were relatively homogeneous, meaning small variations of δ and σ along their bows. Other fogbows were heterogeneous, possessing quite variable δ- and σ-values along their bows.

40|$|In bowed-string {{instruments}} the <b>primary</b> {{function of}} <b>bowing</b> movements is {{to control the}} parameters that govern the stick-slip interaction between the bow and the string, giving the performer control of the sound.

In fast, repetitive bowing movements involving string crossings and <b>bow</b> changes the <b>primary</b> and anticipatory movements become integrated, forming an overall, in the simplest case circular movement pattern. The relative timing of string crossings and bow changes is an inherent property of the shape of these patterns, which therefore has an important influence {{on the quality of}} the note transitions. We will present two complementary studies that provide insight in this coordination phenomenon. A perceptual study has been conducted using a virtual violin, in which the participants could influence the relative timing between string crossings and bow changes by a simple slider, giving insight in the perception of such transitions and typical temporal constraints. Analyses of bowing movements show in detail how the coordination is realized in performance, giving insight in the freedoms and constraints in the performance of this type of bowing patterns...|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{represents}} {{an attempt to}} summarize some of the direct and indirect connections that exist between ray theory, wave theory and potential scattering theory. Such connections have been noted in the past, and have been exploited to some degree, but {{in the opinion of}} this author, there is much more yet to be pursued in this regard. This article provides the framework for more detailed analysis in the future. In order to gain a better appreciation for a topic, it is frequently of value to examine it from as many complementary levels of description as possible, and that is the objective here. Drawing in part on the work of Nussenzveig, Lock, Debye and others, the mathematical nature of the rainbow is discussed from several perspectives. The <b>primary</b> <b>bow</b> is the lowest-order bow that can occur by scattering from a spherical drop with constant refractive index n, but zero-order (or direct transmission) bows can exist when the sphere is radially inhomogeneous. The refractive index profile automatically defines a scattering potential, but with a significant difference compared to the standard quantum mechanical form: the potential is k-dependent. A consequence of this is that there are no bound states for this system. The correspondences between the resonant modes in scattering by a potential of the well-barrier type and the behavior of electromagnetic rays in a transparent (or dielectric) sphere are discussed. The poles and saddle points of the associated scattering matrix have quite profound connections to electromagnetic tunneling, resonances and bows arising within and from the sphere. The links between the various mathematical and physical viewpoints are most easily appreciated in the case of constant n, thus providing insight into possible extensions to these descriptions for bows of arbitrary order in radially inhomogeneous spheres (and cylinders).

40|$|This {{invention}} relates {{generally to}} control systems for controlling crystal growth, and more particularly to such a system which uses {{a beam of light}} refracted by the fluid in which crystals are growing to detect concentration of solutes in the liquid. In a hanging drop apparatus, a laser beam is directed onto drop which refracts the laser light into <b>primary</b> and secondary <b>bows,</b> respectively, which in turn fall upon linear diode detector arrays. As concentration of solutes in drop increases due to solvent removal, these bows move farther apart on the arrays, with the relative separation being detected by arrays and used by a computer to adjust solvent vapor transport from the drop. A forward scattering detector is used to detect crystal nucleation in drop, and a humidity detector is used, in one embodiment, to detect relative humidity in the enclosure wherein drop is suspended. The novelty of this invention lies in utilizing angular variance of light refracted from drop to infer, by a computer algorithm, concentration of solutes therein. Additional novelty is believed to lie in using a forward scattering detector to detect nucleating crystallites in drop...|$|R
40|$|Most of {{the current}} aerosol retrievals from passive sensors are {{restricted}} to cloud-free scenes, which strongly reduces our ability to monitor the aerosol properties at a global scale. The presence of Aerosols Above Clouds (AAC) affects the polarized light reflected by the cloud layer, {{as shown by the}} spaceborne measurements provided by the POlarization and Directionality of Earth Reflectances (POLDER) instrument. We present new developments that allow retrieving the properties of mineral dust particles when they are present above clouds. These particles do not much polarize light but strongly attenuate the polarized cloud bow generated by the beneath liquid cloud layer. The spectral attenuation can be used to qualitatively identify the nature of the particles (i. e. mineral dust particles or biomass burning aerosols) whereas the magnitude of the attenuation is related to the optical thickness of the aerosol layer. We provide accurate polarized radiance calculations for AAC scenes and evaluate the contribution of the POLDER polarization measurements for the simultaneous retrieval of the aerosol and clouds properties. We investigate various scenes with mineral dust particles and biomass burning aerosols above clouds. We found that the magnitude of the <b>primary</b> cloud <b>bow</b> cannot be accurately estimated with a plane parallel transfer radiative code. The errors for the modelling of the polarized cloud bow are between 5 and 8 % for homogenous cloudy scenes, as shown by a 3 -D radiative transfer code. For clouds, our results confirm that the droplets size distribution is narrow in high latitude ocean regions and that the droplets effective radii retrieved from polarization measurements and from total radiance measurements are generally close for AAC scenes (departures smaller than 2 μm). For the aerosols, the POLDER polarization measurements are primarily sensitive to the particles load, size distribution, shape and real refractive index. An algorithm was developed to retrieve the Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOT) and the Angström exponent above clouds in an operational way. This method was applied to various regions of the world and time period. Large mean AOTs above clouds at 0. 865 μm (> 0. 3) are retrieved for oceanic regions near the coasts of South Africa and California (> 0. 1) that correspond to biomass burning aerosols whereas even larger mean AOTs above clouds for mineral dust particles (> 0. 6) are also retrieved near the coasts of Senegal (for June–August 2008).

40|$|Most of {{the current}} aerosol retrievals from passive sensors are {{restricted}} to cloud-free scenes, which strongly reduces our ability to monitor the aerosol properties at a global scale and to estimate their radiative forcing. The presence of aerosol above clouds (AAC) affects the polarized light reflected by the cloud layer, {{as shown by the}} spaceborne measurements provided by the POlarization and Directionality of Earth Reflectances (POLDER) instrument on the PARASOL satellite. In a previous work, a first retrieval method was developed for AAC scenes and evaluated for biomass-burning aerosols transported over stratocumulus clouds. The method was restricted to the use of observations acquired at forward scattering angles (90 – 120 °) where polarized measurements are highly sensitive to fine-mode particle scattering. Non-spherical particles in the coarse mode, such as mineral dust particles, do not much polarize light and cannot be handled with this method. In this paper, we present new developments that allow retrieving also the properties of mineral dust particles above clouds. These particles do not much polarize light but strongly reduce the polarized cloud bow generated by the liquid cloud layer beneath and observed for scattering angles around 140 °. The spectral attenuation can be used to qualitatively identify the nature of the particles (i. e. accumulation mode versus coarse mode, i. e. mineral dust particles versus biomass-burning aerosols), whereas the magnitude of the attenuation is related to the optical thickness of the aerosol layer. We also use the polarized measurements acquired in the cloud bow to improve the retrieval of both the biomass-burning aerosol properties and the cloud microphysical properties. We provide accurate polarized radiance calculations for AAC scenes and evaluate the contribution of the POLDER polarization measurements for the simultaneous retrieval of the aerosol and cloud properties. We investigate various scenes with mineral dust particles and biomass-burning aerosols above clouds. For clouds, our results confirm that the droplet size distribution is narrow in high-latitude ocean regions and that the droplet effective radii retrieved from both polarization measurements and from total radiance measurements are generally close for AAC scenes (departures smaller than 2 μm). We found that the magnitude of the <b>primary</b> cloud <b>bow</b> cannot be accurately estimated with a plane parallel transfer radiative code. The errors for the modeling of the polarized cloud bow are between 4 and 8 % for homogenous cloudy scenes, as shown by a 3 -D radiative transfer code. These effects only weakly impact the retrieval of the Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOT) performed with a mineral dust particle model for which the microphysical properties are entirely known (relative error smaller than 6 %). We show that the POLDER polarization measurements allow retrieving the AOT, the fine-mode particle size, the Ångström exponent and the fraction of spherical particles. However, the complex refractive index and the coarse-mode particle size cannot be accurately retrieved with the present polarization measurements. Our complete and accurate algorithm cannot be applied to process large amounts of data, so a simpler algorithm was developed to retrieve the AOT and the Ångström exponent above clouds in an operational way. Illustrations are provided for July–August 2008 near the African coast. Large mean AOTs above clouds at 0. 865 μm (> 0. 3) are retrieved for oceanic regions near the coasts of South Africa that correspond to biomass-burning aerosols, whereas even larger mean AOTs above clouds for mineral dust particles (> 0. 6) are also retrieved near the coasts of Senegal.
