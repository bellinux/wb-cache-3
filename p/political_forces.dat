5|$|Famine {{is shaped}} by {{generally}} two theories. The first is FAD, Food Availability Decline. This {{is the result of}} a drought, a war, or some other drastic change to the agricultural system. This is the natural cause for famine. The other theory deals primarily with the population’s ability to access or become entitled to food. In this case, food power makes itself known on a small scale, as opposing <b>political</b> <b>forces</b> in Sudan compete for the votes of the people by instigating or encouraging the famine.|$|E
5|$|Nasser's {{involvement}} in political activity increased throughout his school years, such {{that he only}} attended 45 days of classes during his last year of secondary school. Despite it having the almost unanimous backing of Egypt's <b>political</b> <b>forces,</b> Nasser strongly objected to the 1936 Anglo-Egyptian Treaty because it stipulated the continued presence of British military bases in the country. Nonetheless, political unrest in Egypt declined significantly and Nasser resumed his studies at al-Nahda, where he received his leaving certificate later that year.|$|E

In June, Nasser {{took control of the}} interior ministry post from Naguib loyalist Sulayman Hafez, and pressured Naguib to conclude the abolition of the monarchy.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1920s, <b>political</b> <b>forces</b> in the Northwestern United States {{generally}} favored private development of hydroelectric dams along the Columbia. But the overwhelming victories of gubernatorial candidate George W. Joseph in the 1930 Republican primary, and later his law partner Julius Meier, were understood to demonstrate strong {{public support for}} public ownership of dams. In 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed a bill that enabled {{the construction of the}} Bonneville and Grand Coulee dams as public works projects. The legislation was attributed to the efforts of Oregon Senator Charles McNary, Washington Senator Clarence Dill, and Oregon Congressman Charles Martin, among others.|$|E
5|$|The Finns faced a {{detrimental}} {{interaction of}} power struggle and breakdown of society during 1917. The collapse of Russia induced {{a chain reaction}} of disintegration, starting from the government, military power and economy, and spreading downwards to all fields of the society such as local administration and workplaces, and finally {{to the level of}} individual citizens as changes and questions of freedom, responsibility and morality. The Social Democrats wanted to retain the civil rights achieved and increase socialists' power over the society. The conservatives feared to lose the long-held socioeconomic might. Both factions, with groups aiming at major supremacy, collaborated with the corresponding <b>political</b> <b>forces</b> in Russia, deepening the split in the nation.|$|E
5|$|After {{almost a}} year of heavy fighting, a large Russian force crossed the Vistula and besieged the capital of Poland on 20 August. Although the siege was {{partially}} lifted soon afterwards and a successful sortie allowed a communication route between {{the city and the}} rest of Poland, a large Russian force remained on the left bank of the Vistula and continued to threaten the city. Russian commander Ivan Paskevich counted on Polish surrender as his Polish counterpart, Jan Krukowiecki, was known {{to be a member of}} the moderate <b>political</b> <b>forces,</b> willing to negotiate with Russian tsar Nicholas I, who had been deposed from the Polish throne in January 1831 by the Sejm (Polish parliament). When a less conciliatory faction gained power in Warsaw and the Russian offer of surrender was refused, Paskevich ordered his forces to launch an assault against Warsaw's western defences.|$|E

5|$|After {{the start}} of World War II, Gheorghe Tătărescu {{initiated}} a move to rally <b>political</b> <b>forces</b> in opposition to Ion Antonescu's dictatorship, and sought an alliance with the Romanian Communist Party (PCR). He was twice expelled from the PNL, in 1938 and 1944, creating instead his own group, the National Liberal Party-Tătărescu, and representing it inside the Communist-endorsed Petru Groza cabinet. In 1946-1947, {{he was also the}} President of the Romanian Delegation to the Peace Conference in Paris. After that moment, relations between Tătărescu and the PCR began to sour, and he was replaced from the leadership of both his own party and the Foreign Ministry when his name was implicated in the Tămădău Affair. Following the Communist takeover, he was arrested and held as a political prisoner, while being called to testify in the trial of Lucrețiu Pătrășcanu. He died soon after his release from prison.|$|E
5|$|Alongside Alexandru Vaida-Voevod and Constantin Argetoianu (whom {{he succeeded}} as Premier), Tătărescu became a {{dominant}} {{figure in the}} group of maverick pro-Carol politicians. After a bloody crackdown on the Iron Guard, the Front attempted to reunite <b>political</b> <b>forces</b> in a national government that was to back Carol's foreign policies in view of increasing threats on Romania's borders after the outbreak of World War II. In 1945, Tătărescu stressed his belief that authoritarianism benefited Romania, and supported the view that Carol had meant to keep Romania out of the war. Tătărescu's second cabinet was meant to reflect the latter policies, but it did not draw any support from traditional parties, and, in April 1940, Carol, assisted by Ernest Urdăreanu and Mihail Ghelmegeanu, began talks with the (by then much weaker) Iron Guard.|$|E
5|$|Between 1928 {{until his}} death, al-Qassam {{served as the}} {{president}} of the Young Men's Muslim Association (YMMA) in Haifa. While he focused his activism with the lower classes, his position in the YMMA afforded him access with the middle and educated classes of the city who were attracted to Hizb al-Istiqlal (Independence Party), an Arab nationalist political party. In particular, he developed a strong relationship with leading local party member Rashid al-Hajj Ibrahim, the previous president of the Haifa YMMA. A wide ideological gap between the secularist al-Istiqlal and al-Qassam was bridged by a convergence in the view that the struggle against Zionist expansion in Palestine was inseparable from active opposition to British rule. This view separated al-Qassam and al-Istiqlal from the mainstream <b>political</b> <b>forces</b> in Palestine at the time. While men from al-Istiqlal and the YMMA generally refrained from joining al-Qassam's cause, his association with them helped protect him from political figures who opposed his activism. His activities were also financed by several well-off businessmen associated with al-Istiqlal due to his spreading reputation.|$|E

5|$|Casey won a John R. Freeman {{fellowship}} {{from the}} American Society of Mechanical Engineers in 1933 to study hydraulics and civil engineering in Germany. For {{the next two}} years, he attended the Technische Hochschule in Berlin, earning a Doctorate in Engineering. His thesis, written in German, was on Geschieb Bewegung, the bedload movement in streams. Returning to the United States in June 1935, Casey was posted to Eastport, Maine as chief of the Engineering Division at the Passamaquoddy Tidal Power Project, a New Deal public works project. There, he established a concrete testing laboratory under Charles E. Wuerpel which {{is now part of}} the Structures Laboratory at the Waterways Experiment Station at Vicksburg, Mississippi. Due to <b>political</b> <b>forces,</b> the project came to nothing and was allowed to die. After the Passamaquoddy project fell through, Casey served with the Boston Engineer District on flood control surveys of the Connecticut River Valley.|$|E
5|$|However, {{despite the}} efforts of Mair and Bruxner, the {{controversy}} surrounding Stevens' departure and a resurgent Labor Party, now led by the moderate William McKell, ensured that the popularity of the government never recovered. At the campaign for the 10 May 1941 election, the government performed poorly, finding it difficult to distinguish themselves from the past and proposing policies but only promising action after the war. McKell's Labor Party did the opposite, leaving war matters to the federal government and promising current reforms. At the election, the Labor Party polled more than half the vote while Bruxner's Country Party lost nine seats and Mair's UAP lost twenty seats. Bruxner retained his seat with 56%. Bruxner would never again hold ministerial office and the conservative <b>political</b> <b>forces</b> would not take government again until Robert Askin and Charles Cutler won the 1965 election.|$|E
5|$|<b>Political</b> <b>forces</b> {{beyond the}} borders of Egypt {{exacerbated}} the internal problems of the Ptolemaic kingdom. AntiochusIII the Great and PhilipV of Macedon had made a pact to divide Egypt's overseas possessions. Philip had seized several islands and cities in Caria and Thrace, while the Battle of Panium (198 BC) had resulted in the transfer of Coele-Syria, including Judaea, from the Ptolemies to the Seleucids. Meanwhile, in the south of Egypt, there was a long-standing revolt that had begun during the reign of PtolemyIV, led by Horwennefer and by his successor Ankhwennefer. Both the war and the internal revolt were still ongoing when the young PtolemyV was officially crowned at Memphis at the age of 12 (seven years after the start of his reign), and the Memphis decree issued.|$|E

5|$|The PKWN was {{reshaped}} {{into the}} Provisional Government (Rząd Tymczasowy Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej; RTRP), which functioned from January 1945. This government was headed by Edward Osóbka-Morawski, a socialist, but the communists, mostly non-PPR Soviet employees, such as Michał Rola-Żymierski, held {{a majority of}} key posts. In April 1945, a Polish-Soviet treaty of friendship and cooperation was signed; it severely limited the possibilities of future Western or émigré impact or internal cooperation with non-communist <b>political</b> <b>forces</b> in Poland. The consecutive early Soviet-influenced governments were subordinate to the unelected, communist-controlled parliament, the State National Council (Krajowa Rada Narodowa; KRN), formed by Gomułka and his PPR in occupied Warsaw in January 1944. The communist governmental structures were not recognized by the increasingly isolated Polish government-in-exile, which had formed its own quasi-parliament, the Council of National Unity (Rada Jedności Narodowej; RJN).|$|E
