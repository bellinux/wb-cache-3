25|$|Following the Velodrom d’Hiver {{roundup of}} Jews of July 15, 1942, the Northern {{assembly}} of cardinals and archbishops sent a protest letter to Pétain. With the free press silenced, Charles Lederman, a Jewish Communist approached the Archbishop of Toulouse, Jules-Géraud Saliège, to alert public opinion {{to what was}} being done to the Jews. He told Saliège of the arrests, kidnappings and deportations. Saliège read his famous Pastoral letter the following Sunday. Other bishops - Monseigneur Théas, Bishop of Montauban, , Bishop of Marseilles, Cardinal Gerlier, Archbishop of Lyon, Monseigneur Vansteenberghe of Bayonne and Monseigneur Moussaron, Archbishop of Albi - also denounced the roundups from the pulpit and through parish distributions, {{in defiance of the}} Vichy regime.

40|$|Isolation of {{guinea pig}} pups {{in a novel}} {{environment}} first produces active behaviors such as vocalizing and movement; over time, these behaviors wane and pups show characteristic <b>passive</b> <b>responses</b> similar to those produced by increased proinflammatory activity. Further, isolation of pups on two consecutive days has recently been shown to enhance those <b>passive</b> <b>responses</b> on the second day. Endogenous proinflammatory activity is thought to mediate the enhancement (sensitization). An injection of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) {{has been shown to}} increase passive behavior, possibly by increasing proinflammatory activity. The present study further investigated the role of CRF on proinflammatory activity and behavior during separation. In Experiment 1, pups were subcutaneously injected with 10 μg of CRF or saline vehicle and then placed in a novel environment for 3 hr. CRF-injected pups exhibited more passive behavior and increased expression of the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus when compared to saline injected pups. CRF increased plasma cortisol levels confirming that CRF activated the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. In Experiment 2, pups were injected with either 75 μg d-Phe 12 - 41 (CRF 12 - 41), a corticotropin releasing factor antagonist, or saline vehicle and separated for 3 hr on two consecutive days. CRF 12 - 41 increased active behaviors on Day 1. Passive behavior during separation was minimally affected by administration of the antagonist. In addition, <b>passive</b> <b>responses</b> increased from Day 1 to Day 2 in both the CRF 12 - 41 and saline groups. Together, these findings provide evidence that exogenous CRF increases passive behavior through a proinflammatory mechanism, but also raise questions about the role of endogenous CRF in the separation response...|$|R

Because α-MSH has broad anti-inflammatory properties, the results suggested that proinflammatory factors {{play a role in}} mediating the behavior of isolated infants. The present study further investigated this possibility. In Experiment 1, injection of lipopolysacchride (LPS) increased the number of 60 -s intervals in which pups expressed the same three responses during a 1 -h test, and ICV infusion of α-MSH significantly reduced the effect of LPS on crouching and piloerection. In Experiment 2, the prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor indomethacin (10 mg/kg) reduced the number of 60 -s intervals in which pups exhibited both crouching and the full suite of <b>passive</b> <b>responses</b> during a 3 -h isolation in a novel environment.

Although {{this is consistent}} with the transverse basilar membrane (BM) fibers, the cochlear partition contains cellular longitudinal coupling. In cochlear models, longitudinal coupling diminishes passive BM tuning; however, it has recently been employed in theories of active mechanics to enhance tuning. Our goal in this study was to probe passive longitudinal coupling by comparing BM responses in damaged cochleae with <b>passive</b> <b>responses</b> in normal cochleae. The cochleae of gerbils were damaged with intratympanic neomycin followed by a waiting period to ensure that all of the cells of the partition were missing or severely disrupted. We then measured BM motion and examined the cochleae histologically. In comparison with <b>passive</b> <b>responses</b> in normal cochleae, we observed a downward shift in characteristic frequency, an expected consequence of reduced stiffness from cellular damage. However, we did not observe enhanced passive tuning in the damaged cochleae, as would be expected if longitudinal coupling were substantially greater in the normal cochleae. Thus, we conclude that cell-based longitudinal coupling is not large enough to influence passive cochlear mechanics. This finding constrains theories of active mechanics...|$|R

The present study examined social and developmental influences on {{the expression of the}} passive stage of responsiveness in young guinea pigs. Both preweaning and periadolescent guinea pigs displayed the passive stage during isolation in a novel environment. In preweaning pups and periadolescents that had been housed with the mother since birth, the presence of the mother in the novel environment prevented the passive stage from occurring. Levels of <b>passive</b> <b>responses</b> in the presence of an unfamiliar adult female were generally intermediate to those in the other two test conditions; however, periadolescents housed only with a peer between weaning and testing exhibited the passive stage of responsiveness not only when alone but also when with the mother or an unfamiliar female.

40|$|Early life {{stressors}} {{have long}} been known to have powerful immediate and lasting biobehavioral consequences. Though much has been learned about the neural and endocrine substrates of such effects, increasing evidence suggests that elements {{of the immune system}} may also play a substantial role. Neonatal exposure to lipopolysacchride (LPS) has been found to affect later behavioral and endocrine endpoints in rats and mice in ways that parallel the effects of more-traditional early experiences. In guinea pigs—a rodent model for studies of filial attachment and separation—proinflammatory factors appear to contribute to the behavioral reaction of pups during isolation in a novel environment. Evidence for this assertion includes findings that: (1) exposure of guinea pig pups to LPS produces the same constellation of passive behavioral effects as does protracted isolation from the mother in a novel environment; (2) isolation in a novel environment increases proinflammatory cytokine expression and core body temperature; and, (3) administration of anti-inflammatory agents attenuate <b>passive</b> <b>responses</b> during isolation. Further, it appears that corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) may activate the immune system during isolation since administration of this peptide increases the <b>passive</b> <b>responses</b> {{in the same way as}} does prolonged isolation or injection of LPS, and anti-inflammatory treatment attenuates the behavioral effect of CRF.

The {{second part of the}} research investigates consumers’ expectations of how toy recalls should be handled and identifies what recall actions are considered most important to them.

The study argues that companies do not generally follow any structured steps when conducting toy recalls and that they do not adhere to the Smith, Thomas and Quelch’s (1996) framework in the same way. Moreover, the study discovers that <b>passive</b> <b>responses</b> are prevalent among the recalling toy companies, while both the “super-effort” and the “forced compliance” approaches according to the “company response continuum” are equally common. Finally, the research outlines that consumers vary in their expectations of of recalls’ handling; however, they anticipate similar behavior from toy companies. This includes: proactive preparation for recalls; conducting recalls immediately after discovering faulty toys; keeping the customers fully informed about the cause of the defects and their potential consequences and providing them with an adjustment offer in return for the defective products...|$|R

Greater insight into goal-based coping processes theorised to underpin psychological resilience may inform efforts to support the maintenance and recovery of psychological wellbeing in the context {{of breast cancer}} treatment and recovery. This prospective study adopted a qualitative descriptive design to better understand the nature of situational goal-based coping in response to personal goal interference encountered across the six months following surgery for early-stage breast cancer. Method: Responses to specific instances of goal interference were derived from semi-structured interviews conducted at three time-points following surgery (i. e., approximately two, four, and six months post-surgery). Thematic and cross-case analytic techniques were utilised to identify broad patterns across the goal-specific response trajectories. Results: Three broad response patterns were identified - goal-based coping only, combined goal-based coping and other (i. e., informed waiting and/or <b>passive)</b> <b>responses,</b> and informed waiting and/or <b>passive</b> <b>responses</b> only. Specific response patterns were further identified within each category. The majority of response trajectories incorporated the utilisation of assimilative and/or accommodative goal-based coping. Conclusions: Early-stage breast cancer patients utilised goal-based coping in response to many instances of goal-specific interference encountered during the study period. While the initial or delayed activation of these processes appeared generally adaptive, there was also evidence of maladaptive coping and blocked goal pursuit. Further insight into the nature of adaptive and maladaptive goal-based coping in this context could help oncology nurses facilitate ongoing personal goal pursuit and psychological resilience across the cancer continuum...|$|R
