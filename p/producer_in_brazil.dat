40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, Acinetobacter baumannii {{resistant}} to carbapenems {{has emerged in}} many medical centres and has been commonly associated with high morbimortality. <b>In</b> <b>Brazil,</b> this resistance is mainly attributed {{to the spread of}} OXA- 23 -producing clones and, to a lesser extent, to OXA- 143 -producing clones.

40|$|ABSTRACTDeterminants of {{contractual}} arrangements in agricultural credit transactionsBecause of {{a reduction in}} the supply of subsidized agricultural credit <b>in</b> <b>Brazil,</b> the economic agents in the agro-industrial systems organized themselves to tie in credit and their buying and selling transactions with farmers. Different types of agreements appeared, characterized by different finance structures. In this study, the authors aimed at verifying the causal relation between the type of financing used by soy <b>producers</b> <b>in</b> <b>Brazil</b> and their possible determinants. Two arrangements were chosen for analysis: getting bank loans and getting loans tied to transactions with agro-industrial chain agents. The explanatory variables used were property size, guarantees provided and reputation, measured in terms of how long the relationship had existed for. As foreseen in the theory, results showed that property size is one of the determinants of credit transactions between farmers and agro-industrial chain agents. However, the relation with government banks and the guarantees did not turn out to be relevant elements for the analysis of the determinants in the choice of {{contractual arrangements}} for soy financing with agents of the agro-industrial system...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{regulatory}} {{process of the}} organic sector <b>in</b> <b>Brazil</b> began <b>in</b> 1999 and has gone through several changes, culminating in the Decree-Law of December 2007, which established rules for the production and trading of organic products <b>in</b> <b>Brazil.</b> <b>In</b> such Decree, the certification has become a compulsory requirement for production and trading of such products, whose rules governing their obtaining follow rigorous controls standards. As the certification process of organic products is recent {{and there is a}} lack of studies carried on this subject, this study will contribute to fill the existing gap in the international literature, mainly national about this topic, once that aimed to identify factors that influence the possibility of non-renewal of organic production certificate, according to the perception of certified <b>producers</b> <b>in</b> <b>Brazil.</b> Through this effort, this research should contribute to wider adherence and maintenance of the <b>producer</b> <b>in</b> the certified system or, at least, proposals for further works. A total of 200 producers from several Brazilian states participated in this study, and data analysis was performed using descriptive statistics and, later, exploratory factor analysis. The results achieved holds that the determining factors to the non-renewal of the certificate involve variables related to transactions among operators, organization of the supply chain and to the regulations. Furthermore, to overcome the challenges imposed to rural producers, one of the proposals is for greater effective actions from representative industry entities of the sector in aspects that are related to the certification process...|$|R

50|$|CSN {{primarily}} {{operates as}} an integrated steel <b>producer</b> <b>in</b> <b>Brazil.</b> It produces {{a line of}} steel products, including slabs, which are semi-finished products used for processing hot-rolled, cold-rolled, or coated coils and sheet products; hot-rolled products comprising heavy-gauge hot-rolled coils and sheets, and light-gauge hot-rolled coils and sheets; cold-rolled products, including cold-rolled coils and sheets; and galvanized products consisting of flat-rolled steel coated with zinc or a zinc-based alloy. The company also offers tin mill products, including tin plate, tin free steel, low tin coated steel, and black plate products. CSN also mines iron ore, limestone, and dolomite, and maintains strategic investments in railroads and power supply companies. The company sells its steel products to customers in Brazil and 71 other countries in North America, Europe, and Asia through its sales force and distributors.

40|$|Today {{the use of}} {{anaerobic}} digestion technique emerges {{as an alternative to}} the conventional treatment method of pig slurry to the pig <b>producers</b> <b>in</b> <b>Brazil</b> because of the energy demanding intensive pig production and the negative environmental impact that arises during storage and use. The end products of AD technique are biogas as an energy source and digestate that can be used as a fertilizer. The study took place at two pig <b>producers</b> <b>in</b> southern <b>Brazil</b> <b>in</b> order to evaluate the biogas production in the area, its applications and environmental impact. The visited pig producers run a confined animal production system where the slurry that is used in the anaerobic digesters is diluted. The studied digesters are covered with an air tight flexible plastic membrane that takes the shape of a balloon where each digester has the volume of 620 m 3. Sedimentation occurs inside each reactor where the temperature also fluctuates. The produced biogas is conveyed to a torch where the biogas is combusted. The results of this study show that the digesters are working properly but there is a need for mixing and constant temperature in order to optimize the process. Biogas is primarily suited for heat production and the digestate can be used as a fertilizer. Biogas production is considered to have a positive environmental impact if the biogas is used or combusted in a torch. There is also a need to apply a cover over the digestate during the storage time to avoid ammonia emissions. The approximated biogas potential for Rio Grande do Sul is nearly 100 GWh/year. For an approximated biogas potential of more consideration it is found that further studies of the housing systems in Rio Grande do Sul are needed. This is due to a greatly varying amount of degradable materials in the pig slurry from one ranch to another...|$|R
