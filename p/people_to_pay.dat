5|$|Schneiderman {{described}} Trump University as a bait-and-switch {{scheme and}} pointed {{to the fact that the}} organization was not a university. He accused Trump of misleading more than 5,000 <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> up to $35,000 to learn his real estate investment techniques.|$|E
5|$|Like {{a typical}} mobile ransomware, it employs scare tactics to extort <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> a ransom. The program {{pretends to be}} an accusatory authority, {{demanding}} the victim to pay a fine from $100 to $200 USD or otherwise face a fictitious charge. Rather surprisingly, Fusob suggests using iTunes gift cards for payment. Also, a timer clicking down on the screen adds to the users’ anxiety as well.|$|E
5|$|Macdonald was {{considered}} one of his province's most eloquent political orators. He articulated a philosophy of provincial autonomy, arguing that poorer provinces needed a greater share of national tax revenues to pay for health, education and welfare. He contended that Nova Scotians were victims of a national policy that protected the industries of Ontario and Quebec with steep tariffs forcing <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> higher prices for manufactured goods. It was no accident, Macdonald said, that Nova Scotia had gone from the richest province per capita before Canadian Confederation in 1867 to poorest by the 1930s.|$|E

25|$|In 1865, Hickok {{recruited}} six Indians {{to accompany}} him to Niagara Falls, where he put on an outdoor demonstration called The Daring Buffalo Chasers of the Plains. Since the event was outdoors, he could not compel <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay,</b> and the venture was a financial failure.|$|E

25|$|Lower {{fertility}} rates and an aging population, {{due to increased}} life-expectancy, brings new challenges to the Finnish health care system. As there will be fewer <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for health and social care, many of the aging population can be predicted to be affected. It is estimated that the old age dependency ratio in Finland will be the highest of all EU countries in 2025.|$|E
25|$|Burgher arms used to {{be common}} in France, but they {{disappeared}} in the French Revolution, which was hostile to heraldry. In {{the end of the}} 17th century, an attempt was made to list all arms in Armorial général as a device to increase tax revenue. When the attempt failed, in order to force <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> tax, arms were given to many burghers who had never had them. These arms were never used by their recipients. In France burgher arms are not supposed to have a helmet.|$|E
25|$|Cases of grisi siknis were {{registered}} in Nicaragua in March 2009 in Puerto Cabezas and Siuna where many {{students of the}} National Institute of Technology and other schools, suffered attacks. Most {{of the victims were}} girls. The Miskito people argued that it was due to the action of black sorcerers to oblige the <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> the expensive cures. Some scholars in the country conclude that it is due to the extreme poverty that the Miskito people endure and that was worsened by Hurricane Felix of September 2007.|$|E

500|$|And {{yet despite}} his {{formidable}} record and undoubted {{importance in the}} history of technology, Evans never became a household name. In this respect Evans was his own worst enemy. He was deeply affected by a perceived lack of recognition and appreciation from his peers for his work, and his bouts of depression would lead him to act in the extreme, prematurely ending projects and vowing to give up inventing many times {{over the course of his}} life. In time these feelings turned to bitterness and vengeance towards those who criticized or doubted him, and led him to become notoriously bombastic and combative, often aggrandizing his accomplishments and fiercely denouncing critics (such as the wild exaggerations as to the success of the Oruktor Amphibolos at the end of his life). While his relentless pursuit of patent rights did indeed force <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> him his due, the process badly damaged his reputation and made him many enemies. A leading Philadelphia merchant summed it up in 1802, stating [...] "few if any [...] are inclined to give pompous blockhead, Oliver Evans, the credit of inventing any of the useful contrivances in milling for which he now enjoys patents." ...|$|E
500|$|In the Singapore High Court case of Pillay, the Public Prosecutor appealed {{against a}} magistrate's {{decision}} that rules requiring <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> {{a fee for}} a permit before driving motor vehicles into {{an area of the}} city designated as the [...] "restricted zone" [...] were ultra vires section 90(1) of the Road Traffic Act, the relevant part of which stated: [...] "The Minister may make rules... generally for the purpose of carrying this Act into effect...". The respondent submitted that {{the primary purpose of the}} rules was to impose a fee on vehicles entering the restricted zone, and that section 90(1) did not empower the Minister to do so. The Court disagreed, holding that the Act empowered the Minister to make rules to regulate road traffic, and the purpose of the rules in question was not fee collection but to alleviate traffic congestion within the restricted zone. The fee imposed was [...] "the means adopted to achieve the desired purpose and is merely incidental thereto". Law professor Thio Li-ann has commented that the Court's judgment, which appears to accept that an administrative measure need not relate directly to the purpose of a statute but may be incidental to it, [...] "effectively gives the public body a great latitude to manoeuvre and formulate means which may have only a bare nexus with the statutory purpose".|$|E
2500|$|Prior to 1066, {{animals and}} objects causing serious damage or even death were called banes, and were handed over {{directly}} to the victim in a practice known as noxal surrender. [...] Early legislation also directed <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> specific sums of money, called wergild, as compensation for actions that resulted in someone else's death.|$|E
40|$|Using a {{contingent}} valuation survey, <b>people’s</b> willingness <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> {{for a given}} risk reduction {{is found to be}} much larger when traveling by air compared to by taxi. Follow-up questions revealed that an important reason for this discrepancy is that many experience a higher mental suffering from flying, and that they are willing <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>to</b> reduce this suffering. It was also consistently found that <b>people</b> are willing <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> more for a certain risk reduction if the original price was higher. Policy implications are discussed...|$|R

2500|$|Shadow {{explained}} that the album's title also referred to the experiences of recording artists in the year 2011: he described some of these experiences as [...] "a bit silly." [...] He also described the difficulty for an artist to gain attention, explaining: [...] "It's really hard to get <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> attention if all you're doing is putting out an album. It only matters to people if you're wearing a meat dress or slagging off your peers or generally behaving like an ass. So it's satire and I'm {{the butt of the}} joke." ...|$|E
2500|$|Tommy Lee Wallace, the film's art director, spoke admirably about Carpenter during post. [...] " [...] {{asked if}} I could cut sound effects. The answer, {{of course was}} 'Sure!' Once again, here I was, a {{perfectly}} green recruit, yet John made {{a leap of faith}} … he further insisted we get the best processing money could, which at that time was the legendary MGM color labs. Finally, he insisted we get the best postproduction sound money could buy, which was Samuel Goldwin Sound, another legend. The expense for this unorthodox approach ate up a huge amount of the budget. The production manager fumed that we were exploiting <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for processing— and it was true." ...|$|E
2500|$|Medicare is not {{generally}} an unearned entitlement. Entitlement is most commonly {{based on a}} record of contributions to the Medicare fund. As such it {{is a form of}} social insurance making it feasible for <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for insurance for sickness in old age when they are young and able to work and be assured of getting back benefits when they are older and no longer working. Some people will pay in more than they receive back and others will receive more benefits than they paid in. [...] Unlike private insurance where some amount must be paid to attain coverage, all eligible persons can receive coverage regardless of how much or if they had ever paid in.|$|E

2500|$|Coauthor Bill Zanker {{writes in}} the work about the {{importance}} of brand name power for Trump: [...] "That {{is an example of the}} Trump attitude. Trump knows his worth, and he gets <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> him for it. But it is not only for the money. With Trump it is never just for the money. He is passionate about everything he does. He loves connecting with people, helping them, and educating them. Zanker gave as an example his company The Learning Annex and its business relationship with Trump, [...] "If you consider the advertising, promotions, and everything The Learning Annex does to enhance the Trump brand, nationally and internationally, Donald gets much more than $1.5 million per speech— but he donates much of the money to charity." [...] Trump concurs with Zanker's assessment, [...] "I give two-hour speeches at the Learning Annex Wealth Expos. I donate a large portion of my speaking fees to charity." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{government}} also used animation studios like Walt Disney to encourage <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> their taxes promptly. [...] In the New Spirit, Donald Duck listens attentively {{to the radio}} as it tells him {{about the importance of}} paying his income taxes. [...] It details how to fill out a new tax form for households making less than $3,000.00. [...] In Spirit of ’43 Donald is caught in a conundrum to either spend his money in frivolous pursuits, which aids the Axis, or save his money so he can pay his taxes and support the war effort. [...] In both of these films, paying taxes is described as a right and a privilege and should be done gladly and proudly for the war effort. [...] "Taxes run the factories which make the war supplies" [...] according to the narrator in the cartoon. [...] Spirit of ’43 blames Hitler and Hirohito for the high taxes.|$|E
2500|$|Ted Morton {{was first}} elected to the Alberta {{legislature}} in the Alberta general election, 2004. He had previously served as {{a professor in the}} political science department of the University of Calgary where he was considered to be member of the conservative Calgary School of professors. [...] Morton served a six-year term as a [...] "senator in waiting" [...] between 1998 and 2004 after he was elected by Albertans in the Alberta Senate nominee election, 1998 and used this position to advocate for democratic reform. [...] Although Ted Morton was a backbencher, he was considered a strong contender for the leadership because of his high profile in the former Reform Party and Canadian Alliance. Morton was considered to be on the right of the political spectrum, and supported allowing <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> for non-emergency health care services such as hip and knee replacements. Ted Morton also presented a private members bill in the Alberta legislature which would have allowed marriage commissioners who objected to same-sex marriage to opt out of performing same-sex marriages. Morton became one of two Senators-in-Waiting chosen by Albertans in a 1998 election.|$|E
