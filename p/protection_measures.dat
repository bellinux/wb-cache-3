The investigations examined why the buildings collapsed and what fire <b>protection</b> <b>measures</b> were in place, and evaluated how {{fire protection systems}} might be improved in future construction. The investigation into the collapse of 1WTC and 2WTC was concluded in October 2005 and that of 7WTC was completed in August 2008.|$|E
5|$|Fishers {{have few}} predators besides humans. They have been trapped since the 18th century for their fur. Their pelts were in such demand {{that they were}} extirpated from several parts of the United States {{in the early part}} of the 20th century. Conservation and <b>protection</b> <b>measures</b> have allowed the species to rebound, but their current range is still reduced from its {{historic}} limits. In the 1920s, when pelt prices were high, some fur farmers attempted to raise fishers. However, their unusual delayed reproduction made breeding difficult. When pelt prices fell in the late 1940s, most fisher farming ended. While fishers usually avoid human contact, encroachments into forest habitats have resulted in some conflicts.|$|E
5|$|De la Ferté {{was highly}} {{critical}} of the Air Ministry's attitude to his service. In 1937 several exercises were carried out by Coastal Command in co-operation with submarines against the Home Fleet to judge the surface fleet's defence against submarine and air attack. However, despite the experiences of the First World War, no attention was paid to the problem of attacking submarines from the air as part of trade <b>protection</b> <b>measures.</b> Owing to misplaced faith in the imperfect ASDIC invention which was never intended to detect surface-running submarines, it appeared the Royal Navy no longer considered U-boats a threat to Britain's sea lanes. The Air Ministry, keen to concentrate on strategic air forces, did not dispute the Admiralty's conclusions and Coastal Command did not receive any guidance from the Air Ministry. The saving grace for both services was the construction of the Combined Headquarters which enabled rapid collaboration in maritime operations. This {{was one of the few}} successes in organisation and preparation made before the outbreak of war.|$|E
