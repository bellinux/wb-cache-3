The earthquake ground motions considered {{to examine the}} seismic behavior of the coupled structures are: N 00 E component of Imperial Valley, 1940 with peak ground acceleration (PGA) 0.32  g (g is the acceleration due to gravity), N 90 E component of Kobe, 1995 with PGA 0.63  g, N 90 E component of North-ridge, 1994 with PGA 0.84  g, and N 00 E component of Loma Prieta, 1989 with PGA 0.57  g.

The response quantities of interest are <b>peak</b> top <b>floor</b> relative displacement, <b>peak</b> top <b>floor</b> absolute accelerations and peak base shears.

40|$|It {{is useful}} to {{estimate}} <b>peak</b> <b>floor</b> accelerations consistent with the specified seismic hazard for ensuring the safety of rigid nonstructural components in structural systems. A modal combination rule is formulated here to estimate <b>peak</b> <b>floor</b> accelerations in a multistoried building directly {{in terms of the}} dynamic properties of the building and pseudo spectral acceleration ordinates of the base excitation. The formulation is developed under the framework of stationary random vibration theory for a linear, lumped-mass, classically damped, multi-degree-of-freedom system with the help of some approximations. A numerical study shows that the proposed rule performs well with the maximum average absolute error in any combination of building and excitation being less than 20 % in case of 5 % damping. Two simpler SRSS-type variants of the proposed rule, one considering modal cross-correlation and another ignoring this, are also shown to perform reasonably well, particularly when the building is not flexible to the ground motion...|$|E

Six events ranging from Mw 5. 6 - 6. 6 were considered {{in the analysis of}} five different structures: GNS Science at Avalon, BNZ Centre Port, Majestic Centre, Victoria University Te Puni Village Tower, and Wellington Hospital. This preliminary investigation firstly involved determination of the fundamental period of each structure in the principal horizontal directions, and comparison with the simplified method proposed in NZS 1170. 5 : 2004.

40|$|Abstract. The {{potential}} {{basis of}} a simplified methodology for estimating the inelastic <b>peak</b> <b>floor</b> acceleration demand (PFA) of multi-story buildings subjected to seismic excitation is explored. Inelastic single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) oscillators are used to find a relation between the lateral strength and the inelastic acceleration demand. Effects of positive as well as negative post yielding stiffness and different damping types are assessed. Using regression analysis, a simplified approach is proposed to estimate inelastic acceleration demands for use within a probabilistic framework. Based on a fundamental mode approximation an existing approach for predicting elastic PFA demands is extended to inelastic multi-story structures. Pros and cons of this methodology are discussed, and further developments are recommended...|$|E

40|$|This study {{presents}} {{the influence of}} vertical component of ground motion on the response of a tall building; earthquakes with reverse fault and strike-slip with short or far distance to the fault are considered. The main {{focus has been on}} the change of structural response due to inclusion of vertical exitation in the analysis. The first part of this study discusses the description of the structural model and modeling techniques in detail which is based on Model 2 B of PEER’s Case Studies of the Seismic Performance of Tall Buildings (Moehle, et al. 2011). All elements are modeled with specific effective stiffness and nonlinear materials to capture the accurate behavior of the building under the nonlinear response history analysis. Backbone curves of the components is presented. The model is validated by comparing the behavior of the structural model for this study and the response of the Model 2 B of PEER’s Case Studies of the Seismic Performance of Tall Buildings (Moehle, et al. 2011). The second part of this thesis focuses on the nonlinear response history analysis, the ground motion selection and information on the selected records. The effect of vertical component of the ground motion on the structural behavior is discussed in detail by comparing the structural response due to the lateral components of the ground motion and the structural response due to all three components of the ground motion. The structural response includes the following parameters: maximum inter-story drift ratio, the axial force of columns and shear walls, story shear, <b>peak</b> <b>floor</b> vertical acceleration and <b>peak</b> <b>floor</b> vertical displacement.

30|$|In the {{definition}} of loss, {{one of the most}} vital steps toward the estimation of the total loss in buildings due to an earthquake event is the fragility curve, which describes the relation of the response of a structure with its damage state.

The main source of damage of various structural components is the structural deformation due to lateral displacements and therefore the IDR proves to be a strong index of possible damage to the structural elements of a building.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Earthquake loading {{standards}} NZ 1170. 5 : 2004 {{has introduced}} new provisions {{for the design}} of Non-Structural Components (NSC) and building parts taking into account of <b>peak</b> <b>floor</b> acceleration up the height of the building and spectral response of components. In this study, the acceleration demands on NSCs located in ductile low-rise and high-rise buildings of reinforced-concrete moment-resisting frames are analysed under earthquake records with two design levels representing life safety or ultimate limit state, and operational or serviceability limit state. The numerical results on the response of the components are derived using a floor response spectra approach. The floor response spectra up the height of the building have shown peaks near the modal periods which are not reflected by code provisions. This effect is observed both in SLS and ULS conditions, but more pronounced in SLS. Finally, the adequacy of the current provisions of NZS 1170. 5 : 2004 in terms of acceleration demands for NSC with short and long periods have been verified. ...|$|E

40|$|A low cost, simple {{solar heating}} system {{consisting}} of an active collector with an In-Floor Heat Distribution and Storage (IFHDS) system was developed {{in response to the}} energy crisis of the 1970 s. A two-dimensional finite difference model was developed and used to simulate the performance of IFHDS system cross-sections. Simulation runs were conducted with a steady-periodic model for the temperature of the solar-heated air in the IFHDS system cross-section. The steady periodic simulation results indicated IFHDS system energy efficiency increases with decreasing air temperature in the room above the IFHDS system, peak temperature of the solar-heated air in the IFHDS system cross-section, and required temperature of the IFHDS system floor surface. The results also indicated that energy efficiency increases as thermal storage mass thickness decreases.

40|$|AbstractJoint {{probabilistic}} {{characteristics of}} key structural demand variables due to intense ground shaking {{are important for}} quantitative seismic loss estimation. Current damage–loss models require inputs of multiple seismic demand parameters, such as maximum/residual inter-storey drift ratio (ISDR) and <b>peak</b> <b>floor</b> acceleration (PFA). This study extends current seismic demand estimation methods based on incremental dynamic analysis (IDA) by characterising dependence among different engineering demand parameters (EDP) using copulas explicitly. The developed method is applied to a 4 -storey non-ductile reinforced concrete (RC) frame in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada. The developed multi-variate seismic demand model is integrated with a storey-based damage–loss model to assess the economic consequences due to different earthquake loss generation modes (i. e. non-collapse repairs, collapse, and demolition). Results obtained from {{this study indicate that}} the effects of multi-variate seismic demand modelling on the expected seismic loss ratios are significant. The critical information is the limit state threshold for demolition.

40|$|This report {{describes}} in-plane experimental {{testing and}} numerical modelling of timberconcrete floor diaphragms. The experimental tests investigated the in-plane stiffness of the diaphragm and the stiffness {{and strength of}} different connections between the diaphragm and the lateral load resisting system. The test model was 1 / 3 scale and three meters square in plan. Seven tests with {{a different kind of}} connection between the floor and the rigid lateral supports (which simulated a timber lateral load resisting system) have been performed. The results of the experimental testing are used to calibrate numerical models which are used to investigate the effects of the floor flexibility on the seismic behaviour of post-tensioned timber buildings. For the experimental tests, screw and nail fasteners were used to connected to floor unit to the lateral supports. These fasteners were embedded into the concrete slab or timber edge joints at different orientations. The stiffness of the diaphragm connections was vastly different for each detail. Screws installed at a 45 ? angle (inclined) to the lateral supports were four times stiffer than the screws installed orthogonal to the lateral supports. The initial stiffness of the inclined fasteners was similar for timber-to-timber and concrete-to-timber connections. For the timberto- timber connections the orientation did not seem to influence the strength of the connection. The tested diaphragm had an uncracked stiffness of 4000 kN/mm and a cracked stiffness of 300 kN/mm. For the tested floor unit it was concluded that the influence of the diaphragm flexibility was negligible compared to the connector flexibility. The floor flexibility can be idealized as three different parts, the deformation of the connectors, the shear deformation of the diaphragm and the flexural deformation of the diaphragm. The numerical analyses showed that in most perceivable situations the connection deformation will govern the in-plane seismic response of the floor. Hence, it is justified to model it as a single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) element. The influence of the floor flexibility on the seismic response of post-tensioned timber buildings is small. In most cases neglecting the floor flexibility is a conservative approach for the structural design of the building. However, structures with stiff walls and long floor spans there can be a significant amplification of the seismic response. For that case, a simple SDOF representation is proposed. Code-based recommendations for predicting the <b>peak</b> <b>floor</b> accelerations are found to be inadequate.

40|$|ABSTRACT: A set of {{guidelines}} was developed for the Global Earthquake Model (GEM), aiming to offer a practical, yet sufficiently accurate, analytical method for assessing {{the relationship between the}} ground shaking and the repair cost for a building class. The present work illustrates the methodology for a class of modern low-rise steel moment-resisting frames (SMRFs). The structural analysis is performed using Incremental Dynamic Analysis (IDA). The selection of a single Intensity Measure (IM) to parameterize IDA results and, eventually, vulnerability curves is being tackled through an extended IM comparison study across the entire structural response range considering both interstory drifts and <b>peak</b> <b>floor</b> accelerations. It is demonstrated that scalar IMs, defined as the geometric mean of spectral accelerations values Sagm(Ti) estimated at several periods Ti can have an overall satisfactory performance. Once the uncertain structural response is determined, the methodology proceeds to the vulnerability estimation and consequently to loss assessment that is built upon a simplified component-based FEMA P- 58 style methodology. The end product of this study is a high-quality set of vulnerability curves whose weighted moments are taken as the uncertain vulnerability function of the investigated building class. 1...|$|E
