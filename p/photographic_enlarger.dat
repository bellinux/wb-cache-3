40|$|O N E of the {{problems}} encountered in clinical electromyography, especially in the diagnosis of primary muscle disease, lies in the differentiation between the normal and abnormal. The human ear, although a sensitive analyser, is unfor-tunately subjective and liable {{to be influenced by}} the electromyographer's know-ledge of the history and clinical findings. Quantitative techniques that have been developed to overcome this difficulty include frequency analysis (Richardson, 1951; Walton, 1952) and the estimation of mean potential duration (Kugelberg, 1949; Pinelli and Buchthal, 1953). Frequency analysers are costly and complicated items of equipment (the analyser described by Walton contained 27 resonant circuits) and are not in general use. The technique of mean potential duration estimation is difficult to acquire and time-consuming in practice. Close, Nickel, and Todd (1960) reported on the use of a pulse counter in the analysis of electrical activity in normal muscles, and Willison (1964) described a method of counting the number of potential changes and their mean amplitude at a standard tension over a period of one second.

50|$|Negatives are {{normally}} {{used to make}} positive prints on photographic paper by projecting the negative onto the paper with a <b>photographic</b> <b>enlarger</b> or making a contact print.

50|$|Kinematograph Weekly {{was founded}} in 1889 as the monthly {{publication}} Optical Magic Lantern and <b>Photographic</b> <b>Enlarger.</b> In 1907 it was renamed Kinematograph Weekly, containing trade news, advertisements, reviews, exhibition advice, and reports of regional and national meetings of trade organisations such as the Cinematograph Exhibitors' Association, and the Kinema Renters' Society.

Before his graduation in 1937, he spoke at a banquet for the institute's newspaper, where he served as photo editor. An executive from Carl Byoir's public relations firm was present and was impressed by Link's speaking ability. He offered Link a job as a photographer.|$|E
5000|$|The contact copier is {{used for}} {{duplication}} of negative or positive prints obtaining what are called contact prints, that is, to reproduce on paper or film, a photographic negative or positive [...] of exactly the same size of the original. (With normal photographic non inverting processes, black generates white on the target while white generates black). It was the common mode to make prints until it began {{the use of the}} alternative <b>photographic</b> <b>enlarger.</b> There are some models with internal light source constructed as a closed box, in which one or more lamps illuminate the negative through an opal or frosted glass.|$|E
5000|$|The {{reproduction}} {{is done by}} placing the negative {{on top of the}} glass and then the photo paper with the emulsion in contact with the negative. The negative role fits the body, the lid is closed applying some pressure against the glass to prevent blur; then proceed to impress photographic paper by turning on the interior light (contact copier) or an external focus, in the last case, usually from a <b>photographic</b> <b>enlarger.</b> Exposure time can be controlled [...] "manually" [...] or using a timer that controls the light source for a preset time and with greater precision.|$|E

50|$|The {{class of}} color {{photographic}} processes known as chromogenic {{is characterized by}} a reaction between two chemicals to create the color dyes that make up a photographic image. Chromogenic color images are composed of three main dye layers—cyan, magenta, and yellow—that together form a full-color image. The light-sensitive material in each layer is a silver halide emulsion—just like black and white photographic papers. After exposure, the silver image is developed (or reduced) by a special color developer. In this reaction, the color developer in the areas of exposed silver are oxidized, and then react with another chemical, the dye coupler, which is present throughout the emulsion. This is the chromogenic reaction—the union of the oxidized developer and the dye coupler form a color dye. Different dye couplers are used in each of three layers, so this same reaction forms a different colored dye in each layer. Responding to both exposure and development, a blue-light-sensitive layer forms yellow dye, a green-light-sensitive layer forms magenta dye, and a red-light-sensitive layer forms cyan dye. A series of processing steps follow, which remove the remaining silver and silver compounds, leaving a color image composed of dyes in three layers. The exposure of a chromogenic print may be accomplished with a traditional <b>photographic</b> <b>enlarger</b> using color filters to adjust the color balance of the print.|$|E
5000|$|Known for her camera-less images, Means often uses a {{technique}} {{similar to the}} darkroom process which creates photograms, but is uniquely her own. She uses objects such as leaves, light bulbs, and water glasses, instead of photographic negatives, to produce her prints. For both her Leaves and Flowers series (both ongoing, begun in the 1990s) she places the botanical subject {{on a piece of}} glass in the head of the <b>photographic</b> <b>enlarger.</b> The enlarger light passes through the organic matter and onto the paper {{in a way that makes}} them seem to glow. Traditional photographic techniques rely on reflected light in both camera and darkroom, but her technique avoids light reflection altogether. The effect is that the prints seem to emanate their own light, aligning them with the light-emitting pigments of oil painting. [...] "The resulting prints are tonally negative which gives the flowers a mysterious inner glow, because the light is coming through the petals, from within the flower," [...] said Means of this technique. She used similar techniques for her subsequent Water Glass and Light Bulb series. Scott Hall describes the effect of these techniques: [...] "Her transformation of ordinary household objects into sublime Minimal art is not only evident in the bulb series, but also in the black and white prints of water glasses...Sweaty, chipped and scratched vessels monumentally fill the frame, revealing the beauty in the mundane." ...|$|E

40|$|A {{low cost}} spot {{densitometer}} system is described.

We have described how to construct, test and use the densitometer and how to interface the densitometer to a microcomputer. The advantages of this system are: (1) the ability to enlarge the image for accurate measurements from `small' areas; (2) a completely unobscured image during measurement; (3) low cost and (4) ease of use...|$|E

We used a commercial <b>photographic</b> <b>enlarger</b> in reverse mode obtaining 10 : 1 reduction factor with error less than 1 %. Masks have been characterized by optical transmission measurement and contact profilometry: the exposed region completely absorbs light in the wavelength region explored, while the non-exposed region is transparent from 350 nm on; the average film thickness is of 410 nm and its roughness is about 120 nm. A PDMS microfluidic device has been realized and tested {{in order to prove}} the effectiveness of designed photomasks used with the common UV light box...|$|E
40|$|As Mogenson and Cioé (1977) {{have assumed}} that our {{electrodes}} aimed at the ectostriatum (Hollard and Davison, 1971) were actually located there, we feel that a presentation of the histological data is necessary. Following termination of further experiments (Hollard, 1974) the pigeons, numbered 93, 95, and 119, were sacrificed and perfused with saline followed by 10 % formalin. Sections, 50 microns thick, were cut on a freezing microtome. Prints were made by mounting each unstained section of a microscope slide and placing them in a standard <b>photographic</b> <b>enlarger.</b> The electrode tips of Pigeons 93 and 119 were located in the paleostriatal complex. The sections of Pigeon 95 were damaged and precise localization was not possible. Further work in this laboratory has also found that, using the same coordinates, electrode tips tend to fall in the paleostriatum, {{rather than in the}} more dorsal ectostriatum at which they are aimed. The paleostriatal placements tended to sustain self-stimulation, whereas others located in the ectostriatum sustained relatively low or unstable rates...|$|E
