40|$|To {{prevent the}} {{delamination}} of polymeric coatings from glass fibers, temperature cycling induced interfacial-shear-stress between the glass fiber and <b>primary</b> <b>coating</b> should be always smaller than its interfacial shear strength {{in a long}} time. The method {{for the prevention of}} the long-term delamination of polymeric coatings from glass fibers is as follows. The thickness of the <b>primary</b> <b>coating</b> can be increased if the spring constant of the optical fiber is selected to prevent low temperature microbending of the glass fiber. Meanwhile, Poisson's ratio of the <b>primary</b> <b>coating</b> should be selected to be very close to 0. 5. Alternatively, the relaxation time of the <b>primary</b> <b>coating</b> and secondary coating should be increased, but Young's modulus of the <b>primary</b> <b>coating</b> as well as the thermal expansion coefficient of the secondary coating should be decreased.

However, the physiological importance of caveolin- 1 in regulating signaling {{has been difficult}} to distinguish from its traditional functions in caveolae assembly, transcytosis, and cholesterol transport. To directly address the importance of the caveolin scaffolding domain in vivo, we generated a chimeric peptide with a cellular internalization sequence fused to the caveolin- 1 scaffolding domain (amino acids 82 - 101). The chimeric peptide was efficiently taken up into blood vessels and endothelial cells, resulting in selective inhibition of acetylcholine (Ach) -induced vasodilation and nitric oxide (NO) production, respectively. More importantly, systemic administration of the peptide to mice suppressed acute inflammation and vascular leak to the same extent as a glucocorticoid or an endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) inhibitor.

We show that delivery of Cav- 1 amino acids 82 - 101 (Cav) fused to an internalization sequence from Antennapedia (AP) blocks NO release in vitro and inflammation and tumor angiogenesis in vivo. To characterize the molecular {{mechanism by which}} the AP-Cav peptide and Cav- 1 mediate eNOS inhibition, we subdivided the Cav portion of AP-Cav into three domains (Cav-A, -B, and -C), synthesized five overlapping peptides (AP-Cav-A, -AB, -B, -BC, and -C), and tested their effects on eNOS-dependent activities. Peptides containing the Cav-B domain (amino acids 89 - 95) induced time- and dose-dependent inhibition of eNOS-dependent NO release in cultured endothelial cells, NO-dependent inflammation in the ear, and hydraulic conductivity in isolated venules. Alanine scanning of AP-Cav-B revealed that Thr- 90 and - 91 (T 90, 91) and Phe- 92 (F 92) are crucial for AP-Cav-B- and AP-Cav-mediated inhibition of eNOS. Mutation of F 92 to A 92 in the Cav- 1 cDNA caused the loss of eNOS inhibitory activity compared with wild-type Cav- 1.

Literature is reviewed for information theory relating to molecular structure, biosensors, immobilisation techniques, piezoelectric transducers and biosensor applications of quartz crystals. Three types of molecules were investigated for their biosensing potential, saccharides (pectic acid and alginic acid), an enzyme (galactose oxidase) and an antibody (specific for Botrytis cinerea). Immobilisation procedures using #gamma#-aminopropyltrimethoxy silane, polyethyleneimine and glutaraldehyde cross-linking are developed for pectic acid, alginic acid, galactose oxidase and the Botrytis antibody. These materials are immobilised onto the gold electrode area of an AT-cut quartz crystal microbalance. Operating conditions, either dip and dry batch monitoring or dynamic real-time monitoring using a flow cell are outlined. Ageing of the piezoelectric crystal sensor through erosion of coatings or during physical cleaning of crystals, prior to recoating, is featured and {{is particularly important}} to future cost effective commercial piezoelectric crystal sensor systems. Scanning tunnel microscopy is selected and an example from literature is used to evidence possible mechanisms of <b>primary</b> <b>coat</b> bonding to the gold electrodes. The associated cleaning problems and explanation of memory effects are then postulated. Calibrating data with sensitivities and limits of detection are presented for Cu" 2 "+ (pectic acid coating, Cu" 2 "+ range of 0. 002 mM (0. 128 ppm) to 0. 5 mM (32 ppm); galactose oxidase coating, Cu" 2 "+ range of 0. 002 mM (0. 128 ppm) to 0. 5 mM (32 ppm)); and for Pb" 2 "+ (alginic acid coating, Pb" 2 "+ range of 0. 002 mM (0. 414 ppm) to 0. 1 mM (20. 7 ppm)). Interference effects of Pb, Co, Ni, Zn, Ca and Mg on Cu" 2 "+ detection and measurement are presented. Similarly interference effects of Cu, Co, Ni, Zn and Ca on Pb" 2 "+ detection and measurement are presented. Sauerbrey working of the data is presented, estimating the mass change at the crystal surfaces. The worked data from the dip and dry experiments indicate the mass of analyte bound to the crystal coatings. The data from the flow cell experiments are less conclusive as the saccharide coatings changed structure on contact with divalent ions and the resulting frequency shift relates not only the change in mass at the crystal surface but also the change in structure of the coatings. The results indicate the useful and problem areas of the coatings, when integrated with a quartz crystal to form an analyte specific qualitative and quantitative micromass chemical measurement system.

40|$|The {{dependence}} of the interfacial shear strength between the glass fiber and <b>primary</b> <b>coating</b> in double-coated optical fibers on humidity and temperature is experimentally investigated. The interfacial shear strength is determined from the mechanical stripping force. The effect of humidity on the interfacial shear strength is governed by the diffusion of water vapor through the polymeric coatings to the interface between the glass fiber and <b>primary</b> <b>coating.</b> After several days, the diffusion of water vapor reaches a steady state. The degradation of the interfacial shear strength is unrelated to {{the total amount of}} water vapor in the polymeric coatings, does depend on the amount of water vapor on the glass/polymer interface.

40|$|The {{viscoelastic}} {{behavior of}} commercial UV-cured polymeric coatings of optical fibers is evaluated using dynamic mechanic analysis. The {{results indicate that}} relaxation of stresses and/or strains in these coatings occurs by creep deformation. The axial strain-induced viscoelastic stresses in optical fibers are derived from the exact viscoelastic behavior of the polymeric coatings. Compressive radial stress on the glass fiber produces microbending losses, and therefore, microbending losses in double-coated optical fibers that are caused by axial strain-induced creep deformation of polymeric coatings are investigated. These microbending losses can be minimized by suitably selecting the thickness and physical properties of the polymeric coatings, as follows. The radius, Poisson's ratio, and strain ratio of the <b>primary</b> <b>coating</b> should be increased, but the Young's modulus and relaxation time of the <b>primary</b> <b>coating</b> should be decreased. The radius, Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, and strain ratio of the secondary coating should be decreased, but the relaxation time of the secondary coating should be increased.

30|$|In this {{experimental}} study, {{chromium oxide}} powder was sprayed on a low-carbon steel substrate using the atmospheric plasma spray process. The current and standoff distances (SODs) were varied to study {{their effect on}} the fracture toughness of the coatings. Theoretically, as the arc current increases, the melting of the ceramic oxide should increase and this in turn should lead {{to the formation of}} a dense coating. However, it was observed that if the arc power is too high and because the particle size of the powder is small (approximately 30 μm), the particles tend to fly away from the plasma core. Similarly, an appropriate SOD should provide the particles with more melting time, thus resulting in a dense coating. On the other hand, a larger SOD leads to the solidification of the molten particles before the droplets can reach the substrate. All these effects may lead to substantial variation in the fracture toughness of the coating.
