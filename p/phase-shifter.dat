50|$|Doppler is {{incompatible}} with most electronically steered phase-array antenna. This is because the <b>phase-shifter</b> elements in the antenna are non-reciprocal and the phase shift must be adjusted before and after each transmit pulse. Spurious phase shift is produced by the sudden impulse of the phase shift, and settling during the receive period between transmit pulses places Doppler modulation onto stationary clutter. That receive modulation corrupts the measure of performance for sub-clutter visibility. Phase shifter settling time {{on the order of}} 50ns is required. Start of receiver sampling needs to be postponed at least 1 <b>phase-shifter</b> settling time-constant (or more) for each 20 dB of sub-clutter visibility.|$|E
50|$|The {{output of}} the {{envelope}} sampler was also sent to a <b>phase-shifter</b> that adjusted the output of a local clock that locked to the master carrier using a phase-locked loop. This retained the phase of the master signal {{long enough for the}} slave signal to arrive. Gating on the slave signal was then compared to this master signal in a phase detector, and a varying voltage was produced depending on the difference in phase. This voltage represented the fine-positioning measurement.|$|E

40|$|With the {{congestion}} of the sub- 6 GHz spectrum, {{the interest}} in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems operating on millimeter wave spectrum grows. In {{order to reduce the}} power consumption of such massive MIMO systems, hybrid analog/digital transceivers and application of low-resolution digital-to-analog/analog-to-digital converters have been recently proposed. In this work, we investigate the energy efficiency of quantized hybrid transmitters equipped with a fully/partially-connected phase-shifting network composed of active/passive <b>phase-shifters</b> and compare it to that of quantized digital precoders. We introduce a quantized MIMO model based on an additive quantization noise model considering a realistic power consumption and loss model to evaluate the spectral and energy efficiencies of the transmit precoding methods. Simulation results show that partially-connected hybrid precoders can be more energy-efficient compared to digital precoders, while fully-connected hybrid precoders perform poorly due to their severe insertion losses. Also, the topology of the phase-shifting components offers an energy-spectral efficiency trade-off: active <b>phase-shifters</b> provide higher data rates, while passive <b>phase-shifters</b> maintain better energy efficiency...|$|R

50|$|In early 1941, Air Defense {{recognized}} the need for radar on their night-fighter aircraft. The requirements were given to Runge at Telefunken, and by the summer a prototype system was tested. Code-named Lichtenstein, this was originally a low-UHF band, (485-MHz), 1.5-kW system in its earliest B/C model, generally based on the technology now well established by Telefunken for the Würzburg. The design problems were reduction in weight, provision of a good minimum range (very important for air-to-air combat), and an appropriate antenna design. An excellent minimum range of 200 m was achieved by carefully shaping the pulse. The Matratze (mattress) antenna array in its full form had sixteen dipoles with reflectors (a total of 32 elements), giving a wide searching field and a typical 4-km maximum range (limited by ground clutter and dependent on altitude), but producing {{a great deal of}} aerodynamic drag.
