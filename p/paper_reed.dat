40|$|In {{his opening}} {{paragraph}} Professor Staley [2] states that although inferred as being important, no cprrelation between zonal and meridional wind fluctuations {{have so far}} been detected in the lower stratosphere over equatorial regions. I should {{like to point out}} that a study of wind observations in these regions has yielded positive results, and that these have been used in a non-Fickian treatment of the zonal eddy flux in the momentum balance equation (Tucker [3, 41). If the zonal wind oscillation is given by U(Z, t) =A(z) sin 9 (z, t) where A is the amplitude of the oscillation and 9 its phase angle, it was shown that the divergence of horizontal eddy flux of momentum can be represented by a-dY- v’u’=B(z) +C(z) sin [9 +l#J] B lies close to zero, observations suggest a form for C(z), a-and the phase difference between U and- v‘u ‘ is aY approximately?rJ 2 In the second paragraph it is implied that the treatment by Reed [l] represents a fully acceptable description of the meridional and vertical fields of motion. Yet Reed’s treatment depends entirely on a Fickian approach to the large-scale horizontal flux of heat. In the same <b>paper</b> <b>Reed</b> has stated that a similar approach to the momentum flux is inapplicable; Staley also comes to the same conclusion. This apparent discrepancy between the approach to two different parameters is all the more important because it has been shown (Tucker [3]) that if the horizontal convergence of northward eddy flux of momentum is represented by equation (l), then such a non-Fickian treatment yields a kinematic scheme in which vertical velocity is invariant in time, provided that the vertical eddy viscosity is also invariant in time. This result is quite different from that obtained by Reed who derived vertical velocities with a 26 -mo. period, oscillating about zero. This brings me to the third point. Staley has assumed that, in his symbolism, QK,, is constant with height. But in a,theoretical treatment of the momentum balance (1 1 equation (Tucker [3]) it has been shown that the for...|$|E

The primary aim of this paper is to present an elementary method of describing certain characterizations of spectra and tilings. To illustrate this method, we first give a simple proof of this characterization. We then use the method to derive some characteristic results connected with the dual Fuglede's spectral-set conjecture. The results here extend several known conclusions in a simple manner...|$|R

40|$|The main {{proposed}} goal of {{this research}} was a synthesis of radiosonde and radar time series from the TRMM validation experiment KWAJEX (Jul. 23 - Sep. 14 1999) with satellite datasets and forecast model based analyses, in order to characterize synoptic-scale disturbances passing through the Kwajalein (9 deg N 168 deg W) region on the north edge of the central Pacific ITCZ. The Sobel et al. paper summarizes our methodology and findings. A classic <b>paper</b> of <b>Reed</b> and Recker had documented the steady pulse of easterly waves modulating meridional wind, clouds and precipitation in and west of this region in a set of observations in boreal fall. Our study found easterly waves were much less organized and intense during KWAJEX, and only weakly correlated with daily area-averaged radar-derived precipitation and IR brightness temperature. Instead, we focused on three disturbances associated with the highest daily-averaged rainfall amounts during the period. We found by looking at NCEP reanalyses that only one was an easterly wave, while the other two corresponded to an equatorial Kelvin wave and a mixed Rossby-gravity wave, respectively. The contrast with Reed and Recker may be sampling variability, but the timing of KWAJEX, earlier in the year, and during suppressed (weak La Nina) conditions may also contribute to our different conclusions...|$|R
