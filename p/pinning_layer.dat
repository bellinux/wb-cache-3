40|$|Abstract. To commute {{between the}} {{different}} resistance states of a magnetic tunnel junction (TJ) one can use a thermally-induced <b>pinned</b> <b>layer</b> switching mechanism. When a sufficiently high electrical current flows through the insulating barrier, local temperatures inside the tunnel junction can increase above the blocking temperature of the antiferromagnetic <b>layer</b> used to <b>pin</b> the magnetization of the adjacent ferromagnet.

Here we demonstrate thermally-induced <b>pinned</b> <b>layer</b> switching in thin magnetic tunnel junctions. We further present numerical results that suggest that heating is small when one takes into consideration the uniform current density flowing through the tunnel junction and that one must conclude that nanoconstrictions concentrate most of the current, increasing local current densities and temperature.

40|$|Abstract—The {{magnetoresistance}} of IrMn based spin {{valve sheet}} films has been measured {{as a function}} of applied field orientation and temperature. Analysis of these angular resolved results allows the separation of the magnetic response of each ferromagnetic layer in the structure. Specifically, the data are fitted to a model of magnetoresistive response that accounts for giant magnetoresistance (GMR) effects between the two layers and anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) effects within each <b>layer.</b> Both the <b>pinned</b> and free ferromagnetic layers are assumed to be single domains. Additionally, the free layer is assumed to follow the applied field, while the <b>pinned</b> <b>layer</b> follows the vector sum of the applied field and the pinning field. From the fitting results, several parameters are separated quantitatively, including the resistance change associated with GMR and AMR effects, the misalignment angle for the <b>pinned</b> <b>layer,</b> the angular excursion of the <b>pinned</b> <b>layer</b> under external field, the average current direction and the thermal coefficient of resistance.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{statistical}} distribution of switching durations in spin-transfer switching induced by current steps, and discuss biasing strategies {{to enhance the}} reproducibility of switching durations. We use a macrospin approximation and model the effect of finite temperature as a Boltzmann distribution of initial magnetization states (adiabatic limit). We compare three model spin-valves: a spin-valve with a free layer whose easy axis {{is parallel to the}} <b>pinned</b> <b>layer</b> magnetization (standard geometry), a <b>pinned</b> <b>layer</b> with magnetization tilted with respect to the free <b>layer</b> easy axis (<b>pinned</b> <b>layer</b> biasing), and a free layer whose magnetization is pulled away from easy axis by a hard axis bias (free layer biasing). In the conventional geometry, the switching durations follow a broad regular distribution, with an extended long tail comprising very long switching events. For the two biasing strategies, the switching durations follow a multiply-stepped distribution, reflecting the precessional nature of the switching, and the statistical number of precession cycles needed for reversal. We derive analytical criteria to avoid switching events lasting much longer than the average switching duration, in order to achieve the highest reproducibilities. Depending on the current amplitude and the biasing strength, the width of the switching time distribution can be substantially reduced, the best reproducibility being achieved for free layer biasing at overdrive current of a few times unity.
