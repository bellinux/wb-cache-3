5|$|The airline {{had three}} Boeing 737-300 aircraft, built in 1994. Originally fitted with 136 seats each, they were later reduced to 124, and then {{increased}} to 142. The aircraft were owned by International Lease Finance Corporation and General Electric Capital, and cost NOK 2.25 million per month to lease, <b>plus</b> <b>additional</b> costs per hour. They were British-registered {{and operated by}} Air Foyle HeavyLift, while maintenance was performed by British Midland. Both companies are based in the United Kingdom.

5|$|The Convention {{agreed on}} several principles. Most importantly, {{they agreed that}} the Convention should go beyond its mandate merely to amend the Articles of Confederation, and instead should produce a new {{constitution}} outright. While some delegates thought this illegal, the Articles of Confederation were closer to a treaty between sovereign states than they were to a national constitution, so the genuine legal problems were limited. Another principle they agreed on was that the new government would have all {{the powers of the}} Confederation Congress, <b>plus</b> <b>additional</b> powers over the states. Once agreeing on these principles, the Convention voted on the Virginia plan and signaled their approval for it. Once this was done, they began modifying it.|$|E
5|$|The Veterans Committee {{election}} process was revised in July 2007.

Voting for both the managers/umpires and executives ballots, which now takes place prior to inductions in even-numbered years, began with the 2008 class of inductees, when two managers and three executives were elected. To be eligible, managers and umpires must be retired for at least five years, or for at least six months if they are age 65 or older, while executives must be either retired or at least age 65.|$|E

But intensive mountain search and rescue can require packs that provide for up to 72 hours of operational supplies and tool for the location, rescue and extraction of lost or crashed parties. This gear includes the above, <b>plus</b> <b>additional</b> water, meals, and survival gear.
