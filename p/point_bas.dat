40|$|Abstract. Natural and {{anthropogenic}} aerosols have {{a direct}} impact on the earth's radiative balance. Many of the common atmospheric aerosols contain hygroscopic salts and therefore their physical state and composition are sensitive to the relative humidity. The phase of the aerosol particle will dramatically affect the relative rates of atmospheric reactions, and radiative properties such as scattering and optical activity. In order to understand these atmospheric processes and provide accurate input for global modeling, it is imperative that these phase tran-sitions be well defined. It is thought that the degree of metasta-bility is influenced by the presence of foreign particulate matter.

The first group (mesh) (n = 45) received a PM implant and the control group (n = 55) was submitted to traditional colporraphy. Postoperatory follow-up was done after 12 months. The primary objective was the correction of the <b>Ba</b> <b>point</b> &# 8804; - 2 POP-Q (Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification System) and the secondary objective was the improvement of vaginal symptoms and QoL through ICIQ-VS (International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire - Vaginal Symptoms).

Study design: Cross-sectional study among 890 women (>= 55 years) screened for pelvic floor symptoms. Main outcome measures: The Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory 20 {{was used to measure}} symptoms, and the Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification (POP-Q) system was used to assess prolapse. Areas under the curves, sensitivity, and specificity were calculated for the hymen as a cut-off point for symptomatic prolapse of the anterior and posterior vaginal wall. For the apical compartment, a cut-off point of - 5 cm relative to the hymen was used. Results: Vaginal bulging was the only symptom reported more often with increasing POP-Q stages. Areas under the curves (95 % confidence intervals) to discriminate between women with and without vaginal bulging symptoms were 0. 66 (0. 61 - 0. 72), 0. 56 (0. 50 - 0. 63), and 0. 61 (0. 55 - 0. 66) for the anterior (Ba), posterior (Bp) and apical (C) compartment, respectively. When the hymen was used as the cut-off <b>point,</b> <b>Ba</b> had a sensitivity of 38. 1 % and a specificity of 82. 4 %, and Bp had a sensitivity of 13. 3 % and a specificity of 96. 5 %.

METHODS: This 4 -year prospective study included 260 postmenopausal women with an intact uterus enrolled at one Women 2 ̆ 7 s Health Initiative (WHI) clinical trial site. All completed at least two annual pelvic organ prolapse quantification (POP-Q) examinations and symptom questionnaires (30 bladder, bowel, and prolapse symptom items, modified from the Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory). Symptoms were grouped, and group scores categorized into two or three evenly distributed levels. Year 4 data collection was incomplete because the overall WHI study halted. Generalized logistic linear models and generalized estimating equation methods were used to measure associations between vaginal descent and a symptom or symptom score, controlling for time, age, and body mass index (BMI). RESULTS: Mean age was 68 +/- 5 years, BMI 30 +/- 6 kg/m(2), and median parity 4. Ninety-five percent of women had POP-Q stages I-II prolapse. Increasing maximal vaginal descent was associated with 2 ̆ 2 see/feel a bulge 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 sensation of protrusion or bulging, 2 ̆ 2 and with obstructive bladder, prolapse, and obstructive bowel scores.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that transperineal ultrasound images obtained during maximum pelvic floor muscle contraction improve the diagnosis of levator ani muscle (LAM) avulsion by comparison with those obtained at rest. The objective {{of this study was to}} establish, using transperineal tomographic ultrasound imaging (TUI), the correlation between LAM avulsion diagnosed at rest and that on contraction. METHODS: Primiparous women were examined 3 months postpartum by Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification (POP-Q) assessment and for LAM avulsion clinically by digital palpation and by transperineal TUI performed at rest and on pelvic floor muscle contraction. LAM avulsion was diagnosed on TUI when the three central slices were abnormal. A comparison was made between LAM avulsion diagnosed at rest and on maximum contraction. Two independent blinded investigators performed the analyses and a third investigator resolved discrepancies. RESULTS: One hundred and ninety primiparae were analyzed providing 380 results for comparison, as right and left LAM were analyzed independently. LAM avulsion was found in 36 (9. 5 %) images obtained at rest and in 35 (9. 2 %) on contraction, revealing moderate correlation between the two (ICC, 0. 58 (95 % CI, 0. 51 - 0. 64)). Twenty-two cases of LAM avulsion were identified both at rest and on contraction. One woman had LAM avulsion on palpation, which was seen on TUI as LAM avulsion on contraction, but not at rest. More cases of anterior and posterior compartment prolapse were found in women with LAM avulsion diagnosed on contraction only compared to LAM avulsion observed at rest only (POP-Q assessment <b>point</b> <b>Ba,</b> - 1. 8 vs - 2. 5 (P = 0. 075) and point Bp, - 2. 5 vs - 2. 8 (P = 0. 072)).

However, data regarding whether obesity is a risk factor for recurrence after pelvic organ prolapse surgery are controversial. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to estimate the risk of recurrent prolapse in any vaginal compartment after total vaginal hysterectomy with concurrent uterosacral ligament vaginal vault suspension among normal-weight women compared with either overweight or obese women. STUDY DESIGN: This is a 5 -year retrospective cohort study of women who underwent total vaginal hysterectomy with concurrent vaginal uterosacral ligament suspension at one referral center for pelvic organ prolapse in Italy from January 2010 to January 2015. All women who underwent total vaginal hysterectomy with concurrent uterosacral ligament suspension were included in the analysis. Laparoscopic approach was excluded. Women were classified according to the body mass index of 2 groups: (1) normal weight (body mass index, 18. 5 - 24. 9 kg/m 2) and (2) either overweight (body mass index, 25. 0 - 29. 9 kg/m 2) or obese (body mass index, ≥ 30. 0 kg/m 2). The primary outcome was the incidence of recurrent prolapse in any vaginal compartment (anterior, posterior, or apical). Recurrent prolapse was defined as prolapse extending beyond the hymen with straining (pelvic organ prolapse quantification <b>points</b> <b>Ba,</b> C, Bp ≥ 0) or repeat treatment for prolapse with either pessary or surgery. Uterosacral ligament suspensions were performed with a vaginal approach with the use of sutures placed in the intermediate uterosacral ligament, at or above the ischial spine, and affixed to the vaginal apex. Delayed absorbable sutures were used, with 2 sutures per side.

5|$|The good {{preservation}} of the texts in Unas' pyramid shows that they were arranged {{so as to be}} read by the Ba of Unas, as it arose from the sarcophagus thanks to resurrection utterances and surrounded by protective spells and ritual offerings. The Ba would then leave the burial chamber, which incorporates texts identifying the king with Osiris in the Duat, and would move to the antechamber symbolizing the Akhet. Included in the spells written {{on the walls of the}} antechamber of Unas are two utterances known as the Cannibal Hymn, which portrays the pharaoh as flying to heaven through a stormy sky and eating both gods and men. In doing so the king would receive the life force of the gods. At this <b>point</b> the <b>Ba</b> of Unas would face east, the direction of the sunrise, and beyond the pyramid masonry, the false door of the mortuary temple where funerary rituals were performed. Finally, turning left the Ba would join Ra in the sky by passing through the pyramid corridor.|$|R
25|$|A Medical Civic Action Program (MEDCAP) station {{manned by}} medical {{personnel}} from an American unit, aided by Vietnamese interpreters, and a dentist was brought along {{to provide health}} check-ups and treatment for the villages. The medical treatment was mainly symptomatic and for minor problems, such as aspirin for pains, soap and medication for skin diseases, and extraction for toothaches. Where more serious medical issues were diagnosed, they were referred to other facilities outside the military channels for proper treatment or corrective surgery. The Youth Service Activity entertained the children so that their parents were free {{to talk to the}} government officials present about more serious matters such as government policy. Games were played, songs were sung, candy and toys were handed out to the children, and movies were shown. At one <b>point</b> Colonel <b>Ba</b> joined the children for ballgames. The Vietnamese Agricultural Service provided information to the elders about farming and government initiatives designed to assist farmers. The American military personnel present reported that the villagers appeared to be very pleased with the information session and the free social services.|$|R
