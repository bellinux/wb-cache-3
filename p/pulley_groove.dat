5000|$|It is more {{efficient}} than the older multiple belt system and may consume less space in the engine compartment. By using a single, wider belt instead of multiple, thinner belts, the belt may be put under increased tension without stretching. Higher tension reduces slip, which increases belt life and mechanical efficiency. Reduced slip can allow the use of lower-ratio pulleys; this reduces the load on the engine, increasing fuel economy and available power. The tendency for V-belts to [...] "flip over" [...] in the <b>pulley</b> <b>groove</b> (at high RPM and/or when the belt stretches) is eliminated, and a serpentine belt is also much easier to maintain and replace, {{since there is no}} need to remove multiple belts in order to replace one of them, although newer adjustable-length V-belts ("link belts") can be put on without having to remove other belts, and their link design also allows a self-tensioning characteristic to reduce the risk of flipping over. Also since only one movable belt tensioner is required all of the peripheral components (alternator, A/C compressor, etc.) can simply be mounted to the engine without the need to swivel.|$|E
40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{lubrication}} {{conditions at the}} pin-pulley interface in a Gear Chain Industrial chain CVT. In particular, {{we focus on the}} squeeze of oil which occurs as soon as the pin enters the <b>pulley</b> <b>groove.</b> The duration time to complete the squeeze process compared with the running time the pin takes to cover the entire arc of contact is fundamental to determine what actually is the lubrication regime at the interface. Taking into account that for normal CVT operations the time the pin spends in contact with the <b>pulley</b> <b>groove</b> is of about 0. 01 s (traveling time), we show that rms surface roughness less than 0. 1 μm and squeezing load of about 1 kN acting on the pin, corresponding to values adopted in such systems, guarantee a fully lubricated EHL regime at the interface. We also show that during low-velocity CVT operations, the lubrication regime at the interface is determined by a succession of hydrodynamic and mixed lubrication stages in an order strictly related to the squeezing load history. © 2010 Journal of Mechanical Engineering...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The work {{described}} {{here has been}} carried out to obtain {{a better understanding of the}} tooth root cracking failure mode of timing belts. Previous work has demonstrated the close dependence of this on the tooth deflections of fully meshed teeth, generated by torque transmission, but has not considered the additional distortions generated in the partially meshed conditions at entry to and exit from a <b>pulley</b> <b>groove.</b> Approximate compatibility and constitutive equations are combined with a rigorous consideration of tooth equilibrium in partial meshing to show how bending moments are generated at both exit from a driven pulley and entry to a driving pulley. Experimentally determined belt lives correlate very well with a combined measure of fully meshed tooth strain and strain due to bending at entry or exit. The analysis also shows that this strain measure reduces with increasing belt tooth stiffness, confirming the importance of a high tooth stiffness for a long belt life. Tooth force variations through the partial meshing cycle have also been predicted and compared with measurements obtained from a special strain gauge instrumented pulley. A greater pulley rotation than is predicted is required for a belt tooth to seat in a <b>pulley</b> <b>groove.</b> There is room for improvement in the modelling...|$|E

5000|$|A sheave (...) is a <b>pulley</b> with a <b>grooved</b> wheel {{for holding}} a belt, wire rope, or rope. The grooved wheel spins inside {{the frame of}} the sheave. This allows the wire or rope to move freely {{minimizing}} wear and abrasion on cable. Sheaves can be used to redirect a cable or rope, lift loads, and transmit power. The words sheave and pulley are sometimes used interchangeably.|$|R
50|$|In {{the case}} of a drum-style <b>pulley,</b> without a <b>groove</b> or flanges, the pulley often is {{slightly}} convex to keep the flat belt centred. It is sometimes referred to as a crowned pulley. Though once widely used on factory line shafts, this type of pulley is still found driving the rotating brush in upright vacuum cleaners, in belt sanders and bandsaws. Agricultural tractors built up to the early 1950s generally had a belt pulley for a flat belt (which is what Belt Pulley magazine was named after). It has been replaced by other mechanisms with more flexibility in methods of use, such as power take-off and hydraulics.|$|R

5000|$|Some people {{argue that}} {{elevators}} began as simple rope or chain hoists (see Traction elevators below). An elevator {{is essentially a}} platform that is either pulled or pushed up by a mechanical means. A modern-day elevator consists of a cab (also called a [...] "cage", [...] "carriage" [...] or [...] "car") mounted on a platform within an enclosed space called a shaft or sometimes a [...] "hoistway". In the past, elevator drive mechanisms were powered by steam and water hydraulic pistons or by hand. In a [...] "traction" [...] elevator, cars are pulled up by means of rolling steel ropes over a deeply <b>grooved</b> <b>pulley,</b> commonly called a sheave in the industry. The weight of the car is balanced by a counterweight. Sometimes two elevators are built so that their cars always move synchronously in opposite directions, and are each other's counterweight.|$|R
50|$|In the {{earliest}} applications power was transmitted between pulleys using loops of rope on <b>grooved</b> <b>pulleys.</b> This method is extremely rare today, dating {{mostly from the}} 18th century. Flat belts on flat pulleys or drums were the most common method during the 19th and early 20th centuries. The belts were generally tanned leather or cotton duck impregnated with rubber. Leather belts were fastened in loops with rawhide or wire lacing, lap joints and glue, or one of several types of steel fasteners. Cotton duck belts usually used metal fasteners or were melted together with heat. The leather belts were run with the hair side against the pulleys for best traction. The belts needed periodic cleaning and conditioning {{to keep them in}} good condition. Belts were often twisted 180 degrees per leg and reversed on the receiving pulley to cause the second shaft to rotate in the opposite direction.|$|R
50|$|Front-loading washers are {{mechanically}} simple {{compared to}} top-loaders, {{with the main}} motor (a universal motor or variable-frequency drive motor) normally being connected to the drum via a <b>grooved</b> <b>pulley</b> belt and large pulley wheel, {{without the need for}} a gearbox, clutch or crank. But front-load washers suffer from their own technical problems, due to the drum lying sideways. For example, a top loading washer keeps water inside the tub merely through the force of gravity pulling down on the water, while a front-loader must tightly seal the door shut with a gasket to prevent water dripping onto the floor during the wash cycle. This access door is locked shut during the entire wash cycle, since opening the door with the machine in use could result in water gushing out onto the floor. For front-loaders without viewing windows on the door, it is possible to accidentally pinch fabric between the door and the drum, resulting in tearing and damage to the pinched clothing during tumbling and spinning.|$|R
5000|$|Three {{views of}} the film camera appear [...] "as if in a {{technical}} drawing. It then proceeds to examine the bridge from all angles." [...] The bridge is shown in ultrawide format, then wide, then in close-up, from a train rider's viewpoint.

A worker ascends, inspects, observes the surrounding environs, and descends the superstructure. From a vantage point between two train cars coupled together, the countryside flits by as the train makes its way to the bridge. The bridgemaster at the control console commands the raising of the central section, and the massive alignment <b>grooves,</b> <b>pulleys,</b> cables, and counterweights are all detailed in their steady synchronized operation until the bridge's maximum height of 38 meters is reached. Sailing and steam ships then make their way through, while the steam train waits, puffing. The bridge descends, the counterweights rise, and the train continues on its way.|$|R
40|$|Whether {{the present}} {{generation}} {{had discovered the}} ultimate force in nature most applicable {{to the service of}} men was a question for the scientist of the future to decide, but he thought they could claim the present to be an electrical age, as in pre-historic times there were ages of stone and bronze. The practical utility of the application of electricity to the propulsion of railway and tramway cars was first demonstrated at Berlin in 1879 by Siemens and Halske on an experimental line of 500 metres, {{in the form of an}} oval. The train consisted of a small electric locomotive and carriages, which had very small wheels, with two rows of seats running parallel to the rails. The success of this experiment led to other attempts of an exhibitional nature at Brussels, Dusseldorf, Frankfort and other places, and then electrical traction passed from the experimental to the commercial process of development. The Lichterfelde electric tram near Berlin was the first of its kind. The length was 1 1 / 2 miles, and the equipment in 1881 consisted of two motor cars, the motion being transmitted to the wheels by belts working on <b>grooved</b> <b>pulleys</b> outside the wheels. The prime source of power was a steam engine, with a Siemens motor and generator, but the installation differed in some respects from the Berlin line, the central rail not being used, but the one rail acting as a lead, and the other as a return for the current. Up to 1887 this line canied 100, 000 passengers yearly. These instances showed that the inception of electrical tramways took place in Europe, the principle being the generation of electricity by dynamo, and conveying the current through conductors connected by sliding contact with the cars while in motion. Modern electrical railways were now built chiefly on this principle, although America had far succeeded Europe in the improvement and perfecting of the system. The remainder of the paper consisted of a description of the various systems in vogue, after which he dealt with the "overhead system," which had most successfully operated commercially and practically. Many objections of an aesthetical nature had been urged against the overhead gearing, but they were more apparent than real, and he recommended such objectors to look to the telegraph cables so obtrusively conspicuous in big towns. It was superior to other systems of traction...|$|R
