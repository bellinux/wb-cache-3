Because of the constrained nature of the site, consideration was given, during the design phase, to building part of the new works at a separate location. 22 sites within a 2 mi radius of Deephams were initially identified, and these were then reduced to a short-list of five. An assessment of the whole life cost of using a separate site was then undertaken, and concluded that developing the existing site would be the best way forwards. Any solution required that the works could continue to treat 209,000 tonnes of sewage per day to the existing standards while the work was progressing.|$|E
