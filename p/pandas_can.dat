40|$|ABSTRACT. A 10 -year-old male {{red panda}} {{presented}} acutely with symptoms of shock due to acute abdominal distress and respiratory compro-mise. Abdominal ultrasound confirmed a severely distended stomach for which passage of an orogastric tube for relief was unsuccessful. Intra-operatively, the stomach {{was found to}} be distended and torsed around its long axis supporting the diagnosis of Gastric dilitation-volvulus (GDV). The animal arrested and died intra-operatively and was submitted for necropsy with lesions supportive of the diagnosis of GDV. No risk factors for GDV were found to correlate between the panda and those described in domestic dogs.

We then used playback experiments to examine the response of male giant pandas to female chirps produced during fertile versus pre-fertile phases of the caller's reproductive cycle. Our results show that the acoustic structure of female giant panda chirps differs between fertile and pre-fertile callers and that male giant <b>pandas</b> <b>can</b> perceive differences in female chirps that allow them to determine the exact timing of the female's fertile phase.

40|$|Diffusion {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (dMRI) is widely used in both scientific research and clinical practice in in-vivo studies of the human brain. While a number of post-processing packages have been developed, fully automated processing of dMRI datasets remains challenging. Here, we developed a MATLAB toolbox named Pipeline for Analyzing braiN Diffusion imAges (PANDA) for fully automated processing of brain diffusion images. The processing modules of a few established packages, including FMRIB Software Library (FSL), Pipeline System for Octave and Matlab (PSOM), Diffusion Toolkit and MRIcron, were employed in PANDA. Using any number of raw dMRI datasets from different subjects, in either DICOM or NIfTI format, <b>PANDA</b> <b>can</b> automatically perform {{a series of steps}} to process DICOM/NIfTI to diffusion metrics (e. g., FA and MD) that are ready for statistical analysis at the voxel-level, the atlas-level and the Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) -level and can finish the construction of anatomical brain networks for all subjects.

In another approach, we co-transferred both panda-rabbit and cat-rabbit interspecies cloned embryos into the oviducts of 21 cat recipients.

Mi-crosatellite DNA analysis of these early fetuses confirmed that two were from giant panda-rabbit cloned embryos.

40|$|Understanding {{the impacts}} of {{meteorological}} factors on giant pandas is necessary for future conservation measures in response to global climate change. We integrated temperature data with three main habitat parameters (elevation, vegetation type, and bamboo species) to evaluate the influence of climate change on giant pandahabitat in the northern Minshan Mountains using a habitat assessment model. Our study shows that temperature (relative importance= 25. 1 %) was {{the second most important}} variable influencing giant panda habitat excepting the elevation. There was a significant negative correlation between temperature and panda presence (=- 0. 133, P< 0. 05), and the temperature range preferred by giant pandas within the study area was 18 - 21 degrees C, followed by 15 - 17 degrees C and 22 - 24 degrees C. The overall suitability of giant panda habitats will increase by 2. 7 %, however, it showed a opposite variation patterns between the eastern and northwestern region of the study area. Suitable and subsuitable habitats in the northwestern region of the study area, which is characterized by higher elevation and latitude, will increase by 18007. 8 hm(2) (9. 8 % habitatsuitability), while the eastern region will suffer a decrease of 9543. 5 hm(2) (7. 1 %habitatsuitability). Our results suggest that increasing areas of suitable giant panda habitat will support future giant panda expansion, and food shortage and insufficient living space will not arise as problems in the northwest Minshan Mountains, which means that giant <b>pandas</b> <b>can</b> adapt to climate change, and therefore may be resilient to climate change. Thus, for the safety and survival of giant pandas in the Baishuijiang Reserve, we propose strengthening the giant panda monitoring program in the west and improving the integrity of habitats to promote population dispersal with adjacent populations in the east...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{retaining}} a carnivore?s characteristic simple gastrointestinal tract, giant pandas {{acquire the}} majority of their required nutrients from bamboo. The processes that allow giant pandas to meet their nutritional requirements from this high fiber diet are not yet fully understood due to this monogastric species? limited capability to digest plant structural components. Season dietary shifts in plant part selection have been observed in both wild and captive giant panda populations, and are believed to be an adaptive response to their specialized bamboo diet. We hypothesized that these dietary shifts are driven by temporal changes in the nutritive composition of bamboo and accompanied by changes in digestibility that maximize the absorption of bamboo nutrients in the giant panda. To examine changes in bamboo selection and potential responses in nutrient utilization, five feeding trials were conducted with two captive giant pandas at the Memphis Zoo (July 2014, January, March, May, October 2015). Both giant pandas exhibited two distinctive culm-preference trials, one shoot-preference trial, and one leaf-preference trial. Despite higher nutritive quality of bamboo leaves, culm was the overall predominant plant part consumed by giant pandas during year. Maximum bamboo culm intake coincided with times of high starch concentration in culm. However, starch and hemicellulose content in culm was relatively low during October, when both giant pandas incorporated considerable amounts of leaves into their diets. Bamboo shoots were preferentially consumed when offered during May, likely due to their reduced proportion of plant part structural compounds (ADF and NDF) and increased CP content. Total dry matter digestibility of bamboo based diets by giant pandas is very low (averaging less than 30 %), though giant <b>pandas</b> <b>can</b> apparently access and utilize non-fiber nutrients, such as starch, to a greater extent. When bamboo shoots were included in the diet, giant pandas achieved higher digestion rates for all nutrients. We propose that the basis of giant panda foraging strategy is maximization of digestible energy intake, often from carbohydrate sources, which has applications in the aforementioned areas of giant panda conservation, in addition to management of animals in captive scenarios...|$|E
