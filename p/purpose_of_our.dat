2500|$|In September 2002, Tony Blair stated, in {{an answer}} to a {{parliamentary}} question, that [...] "Regime change in Iraq would be a wonderful thing. That is not the <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> action; our purpose is to disarm Iraq {{of weapons of mass}} destruction..." [...] In November of that year, Blair further stated that, [...] "So far as our objective, it is disarmament, not régime change – that is our objective. Now I happen to believe the regime of Saddam is a very brutal and repressive regime, I think it does enormous damage to the Iraqi people ... so I have got no doubt Saddam is very bad for Iraq, {{but on the other hand}} I have got no doubt either that the <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> challenge from the United Nations is disarmament of weapons of mass destruction, it is not regime change." ...|$|E

60|$|This question, however, {{is not to}} the <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> present work, which respects landscape-painting only; it must be one {{of those}} left open to the reader's thoughts, and for future inquiry in another place. One or two {{essential}} points I briefly notice.|$|E

30|$|Note {{also that}} we only {{considered}} two databases, whereas many others could be included as well (e.g., Scopus or Ovid).

60|$|I fancied {{from the}} {{expression}} on the general's face that it pleased him because my comrade showed himself so eager, {{and there was a}} tinge of bitterness in my heart as I understood that, whatever good to the Cause might be the <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> task, the commander was, in a certain degree, trading on Jacob's love for his father.|$|E

60|$|I said {{to myself}} {{that there was some}} {{movement}} afoot among these men concerning which I had not heard, and then straightway reproved myself for being such a simple as to believe they knew more regarding the <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> friends than did I, who heard discussed every day measures which would soon be taken to relieve ourselves of the burdens which the king had put upon us.|$|E
30|$|The <b>purposes</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> {{study were}} to {{evaluate}} the changes in perioral pressures after protruding the upper incisors and to investigate {{if there is any}} relationship between the upper incisor inclination and perioral pressure changes.
