This new conceptualization explains different types <b>of</b> sense <b>of</b> <b>presence</b> in terms <b>of</b> different modes <b>of</b> <b>presence,</b> and calls {{for the development of}} mode-specific measures <b>of</b> sense <b>of</b> <b>presence.</b> 1...|$|R

5|$|In their {{original}} description, Krause and colleagues suggested that Lavanify was most {{closely related to}} the then-unnamed Indian sudamericid. They based this proposed relationship on the shared <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> prominent, continuous bands of IPM. The teams who named the Indian gondwanathere in 2007 both agreed with this proposed relationship. In their description of Dakshina, Wilson and colleagues added the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> an infundibulum and of perikymata to the evidence for the relationship between the two. These three characters are synapomorphies (shared derived traits) for the Bharattherium-Lavanify clade. They also share the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> furrows on the lingual side of the teeth only, but whether this is a derived feature is uncertain. Wilson and colleagues list two autapomorphies (unique derived traits) of Lavanify: <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> a V-shaped dentine island and absence of enamel {{on one side of the}} crown. Prasad and colleagues who named Bharattherium, noted the absence of enamel on part of the crown of a Bharattherium tooth and interpreted this trait as a synapomorphy of Bharattherium and Lavanify. They also mentioned the <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> a furrow and infundibulum as shared traits.|$|E
