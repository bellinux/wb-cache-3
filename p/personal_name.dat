5|$|Opinions differ {{as to the}} {{derivation}} of the name. One is the farmstead or {{village of}} a man named Aethelhere, an Old English <b>personal</b> <b>name</b> and the suffix tun, meaning an enclosure, farmstead or manor estate; another is adre, Saxon for little brook with the suffix tun. Either is possible as Atherton is bounded by brooks {{to the west and}} south, and crossed by several others. The western boundary is Hindsford Brook, originally named Goderic Brook after a Saxon saint.|$|E
5|$|The fateful {{encounter}} between Margaðr and Guthormr is sometimes dated to 1052 on {{the presumption that}} Margaðr is identical to Echmarcach, and that the event must have taken place {{at the conclusion of}} Echmarcach's second reign in Dublin. In fact, the Old Norse <b>personal</b> <b>name</b> Margaðr is a form of the Gaelic <b>personal</b> <b>name</b> Murchad; and the aforesaid accounts of Margaðr likely refer to Echmarcach's nemesis Murchad, rather than Echmarcach himself. Although the saga claims that a thankful Guthormr donated a portion of his looted silver to the shrine of his saintly uncle at Niðaróss, it is unlikely that any church would have accepted property known to have been looted from Christians. Instead, it is possible that Guthormr's hoard of silver was actually the tax that Murchad which had collected from Mann in 1061 during the expulsion of Echmarcach. Such a date corresponds to the implied date of about 1061 given by Heimskringla.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} the name Glastonbury is unclear but when the {{settlement}} is first recorded in the 7th and the early 8th century, it was called Glestingaburg. The burg element is Anglo-Saxon and could refer either to a fortified place such as a burh or, more likely, a monastic enclosure; however the Glestinga element is obscure, and may derive from an Old English word or from a Saxon or Celtic <b>personal</b> <b>name.</b> It may derive from a person or kindred group named Glast.|$|E

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that, in all societies, <b>personal</b> <b>naming</b> practices and culture are intertwined. Given that {{culture is not}} static, but dynamic and ever changing, <b>personal</b> <b>names</b> have undergone a major transformation due to socio-cultural and political factors. This article reflects on shifts and continuities {{in the practice of}} <b>personal</b> <b>naming</b> amongst the Zulu people. Emerging data demonstrate the evolution from pre-colonial Africa to the post- 1994 period in South Africa. It is further illustrated that the reclaiming of indigenous names in the new democratic dispensation is perceived as a way for Africans to re-define and re-affirm their identities, thus de-stigmatising their culture. Ultimately, this article makes a strong argument that <b>personal</b> <b>naming,</b> in any society, is not detached from the socio-cultural environment. Rather, <b>personal</b> <b>naming</b> and culture are inextricably linked to socio-political conditions at any historical moment. This is demonstrated in the shift from <b>personal</b> <b>naming</b> practices greatly inspired by communal values to those steeped in contradictions within the epoch of neo-liberal capitalism. It is, therefore, concluded that shifts in people’s consciousness lead to fundamental shifts in <b>personal</b> <b>naming</b> practices...|$|R
5|$|While {{the name}} Sigyn is found {{as a female}} <b>personal</b> <b>name</b> in Old Norse sources (Old Norse sigr meaning 'victory' and vina meaning 'girl-friend'), and though in {{surviving}} sources she is largely restricted to a single role, she appears in the 9th century skaldic poem Haustlöng from pagan times, written by the skald Þjóðólfr of Hvinir. Due to this early connection with Loki, Sigyn has been theorized as being a goddess dating back to an older form of Germanic paganism.|$|E
5|$|Also in 941, the seventeenth-century Annals of the Four Masters {{reports that}} a {{chieftain}} named Áed Albanach was slain amongst a vast host of Dublin Vikings by the invading forces of Amargein mac Cináeda, overking of Uí Failge. The fact that Áed bore a Gaelic <b>personal</b> <b>name,</b> died with the Dubliners, and bore an epithet referring to a Scotsman, could be evidence {{that he was a}} successor of Gebeachan. Further evidence of this may be the record of Mór, a woman attested by the twelfth-century pseudo-historical Caithréim Chellacháin Chaisil, which identifies her as a daughter of a certain Áed mac Echach, and describes her as the daughter of a King of the Hebrides.|$|E
5|$|Chat Moss may {{be named}} after St Chad, a 7th-century bishop of Mercia, {{but as it}} was once part of a great tree-edged lake, as {{evidenced}} by the numerous wood remains in the lower levels of the peat, it is perhaps more likely that the name stems from the Celtic word ced, meaning wood. Chat Moss could also derive from Ceatta, an Old English <b>personal</b> <b>name</b> and mos, a swamp or alternatively the first element could be the Old English ceat meaning a piece of wet ground. It was recorded as Catemosse in 1277 and Chatmos in 1322. Moss is the local name for a peat bog.|$|E

40|$|This article {{presents}} the <b>personal</b> <b>naming</b> practices in Konso, a Cushitic-speaking people in southwest Ethiopia. <b>Personal</b> <b>naming</b> in Konso can be formal or informal.

This article argues that the Konso have family names in their naming practice. This article analyses the typology of <b>personal</b> <b>names</b> in Konso and shows an intrinsic interplay between poetry, songs and <b>personal</b> <b>names.</b> The unitary state policies of the previous regimes and the proliferation of religions have resulted in trends in which people give Amharic or religious names to their children or replace indigenous Konso <b>personal</b> <b>names</b> either by Amharic or religious names.

5|$|Emperor Taizong, {{also known}} by his <b>personal</b> <b>name</b> Li Shimin, was {{familiar}} with the culture of the steppe nomads and employed military strategies using steppe tactics as a prince. Taizong was a skilled horsemen, and during a celebration of his victory and ascension to the throne, sacrificed a horse in a ritual derived from a Turkic religious practice. He was able to outmaneuver the heavy cavalry of the Sui Dynasty with his light cavalry, a characteristic of steppe warfare. Taizong shared personal relationships with Turkic allies as a prince, reinforced through oaths sworn as blood brothers. His later successes as an emperor against the armies of Central Asia through diplomacy and divide and rule are the result of his early experiences with Turkic culture.|$|E
5|$|Hun is {{familiar}} in 8th and 9th century England, for instance {{as part of}} a name with two elements. During the 9th century there were East Anglian bishops of Helmham named Ælfhun, Hunferthus and Hunbeorht and a bishop of Worcester called Æthelhun. Hun also occurred {{as part of a}} moneyer's name. There are several placenames in England that contain the term as a <b>personal</b> <b>name</b> element, such as Hunsdon, Hertfordshire and Hunston, West Sussex (but not Hunston, Suffolk). It is possible that Hun was a historical figure, whose name was run together with Beonna's by a scribe.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{place names}} in Scandinavia contain the Old Norse name Þórr. The {{identification}} of these place names as pointing to religious significance {{is complicated by}} the aforementioned common usage of Þórr as a <b>personal</b> <b>name</b> element. Cultic significance may only be assured in place names containing the elements -vé (signifying the location of a vé, a type of pagan Germanic shrine), –hof (a structure used for religious purposes, see heathen hofs), and –lundr (a holy grove). The place name Þórslundr is recorded with particular frequency in Denmark (and has direct cognates in Norse settlements in Ireland, such as Coill Tomair), whereas Þórshof appears particularly often in southern Norway. Torsö (Thor's Island) appears on the Swedish westcoast. Thor also appears in many placenames in Uppland.|$|E

5|$|Scholars of Old Norse mythology now {{focus on}} {{references}} to elves in Old Norse poetry, particularly the Elder Edda. The only character explicitly {{identified as an}} elf in classical Eddaic poetry, if any, is Völundr, the protagonist of Völundarkviða. However, elves are frequently mentioned in the alliterating phrase Æsir ok Álfar ('Æsir and elves') and its variants. This was clearly a well established poetic formula, indicating a strong tradition of associating elves with the group of gods known as the Æsir, or even suggesting that the elves and Æsir were one and the same. The pairing is paralleled in the Old English poem Wið færstice and in the Germanic <b>personal</b> <b>name</b> system; moreover, in Skaldic verse the word elf {{is used in the}} same way as words for gods. Sigvatr Þórðarson’s skaldic travelogue Austrfaravísur, composed around 1020, mentions an álfablót (‘elves' sacrifice’) in Edskogen in what is now southern Sweden. There does not seem to have been any clear-cut distinction between humans and gods; like the Æsir, then, elves were presumably thought of as being human(-like) and existing in opposition to the giants. Many commentators have also (or instead) argued for conceptual overlap between elves and dwarves in Old Norse mythology, which may fit with trends in the medieval German evidence.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} uses, functions, and meaningfulness of traditional <b>personal</b> <b>names</b> and naming practices in Niitsitapi (Blackfoot Indian) culture. The current {{study indicates that}} Niitsitapi <b>personal</b> <b>names</b> appear {{to play a major}} role in capturing and conveying various aspects of traditional Niitsitapi sociocultural knowledge. Niitsitapi <b>personal</b> <b>names</b> thus appear to form an integral part of Niitsitapi oral tradition, and also seem to play a powerful role in establishing and maintaining Niitsitapi conceptualisations of individual, as well as social and cultural, identity. This dissertation supports the position that, in addition to their nominative function, names contain and communicate sociocultural meaning, based on their associations with a wide range of non-linguistic factors which form part of the sociocultural environment within which they are used.

40|$|In recent years, {{a number}} of {{cognitive}} linguistic studies (Barcelona 2003, 2004, Brdar and Brdar-Szabó 2007, Brdar 2007) {{have focused on the}} construction of the figurative meaning of <b>personal</b> <b>names</b> as accompanied by their “irregular” morpho-syntactic behavior. These studies prove that cognitive linguistics, with its theory of metaphor and metonymy, can provide answers to questions that have troubled philosophers and linguists who have examined the meaning, reference, and grammatical behavior of proper names. This paper follows in the footsteps of Barcelona (2003, 2004), Brdar and Brdar-Szabó (2007), and Brdar (2007) in exploring proper names within the cognitive linguistics framework. Specifically, it deals with the construction of the figurative meaning of <b>personal</b> <b>names</b> in English and Bosnian. However, unlike the aforementioned studies which apply the cognitive theory of metaphor and metonymy to the study of figuratively used <b>personal</b> <b>names,</b> this paper employs conceptual integration theory in order to explain the construction of the figurative meaning of <b>personal</b> <b>names</b> in highly creative examples. The analysis of figuratively used <b>personal</b> <b>names</b> in light of conceptual integration theory presents an alternative to the models proposed by Barcelona (2003, 2004), Brdar and Brdar-Szabó (2007), and Brdar (2007). At the same time, it is a complementary analysis to the abovementioned models, which, in our view, should be limited to examples which are innovative and in which the context plays an important role. Additionally, the paper addresses an issue related to cultural peculiarities influencing the expressions with figuratively used <b>personal</b> <b>names</b> in the languages in question. In particular, it examines the role of culture in the selection of figuratively used <b>personal</b> <b>names,</b> and the selection of figurative referents of such <b>personal</b> <b>names...</b>|$|R
