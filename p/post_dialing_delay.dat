To facilitate both relationships, Enum server- that is able to translate the numbering address such as PSTN (E. 164) to URI address (Uniform Resource Identifier) - can be used. In this research, we interconnect Open IMS and Asterisk server Enum server. We then analyze the server performance and PDD (<b>Post</b> <b>Dial</b> <b>Delay)</b> values resulted by the system. As the result of the experiment, we found that, for a call from Open IMS user to analog Asterisk telephone (FXS) with a arrival call each servers is 30 call/sec, the maximum PDD value is 493. 656 ms. Open IMS is able to serve maximum 30 call/s with computer processor 1. 55 GHz, while the Asterisk with computer processor 3. 0 GHz, may serve up to 55 call/sec. Enum on server with 1. 15 GHz computer processor have the capability of serving maximum of 8156 queries/sec. Comment: 12 Page...|$|R

5000|$|Before modern {{electronic}} telephone switching systems came into use, dial tones were usually generated by electromechanical means. In the United States, the standard [...] "city" [...] dial tone was a 600 Hz tone that was amplitude-modulated at 120 Hz. Some dial tones were simply adapted from 60 Hz AC line current. In the UK, the standard <b>Post</b> Office <b>dialling</b> tone was 33 Hz; it was {{generated by a}} motor-driven ringing machine in most exchanges, and by a vibrating-reed generator in the smaller ones. Some later ringing machines also generated a 50 Hz dial tone.|$|R

50|$|In {{the case}} of H2S, the echoes are {{returned}} {{from the ground and}} objects on it. That means the very first signal that would normally be received would be from the ground directly beneath the aircraft. Since the echo from this location took some time to return to the aircraft, the time needed to travel to the ground and back at the aircraft's current altitude, the H2S display naturally had an empty area around the centre of the display, with its radius representing the altitude of the aircraft. This was known as the centre-zero. Normally the operator used a <b>dial</b> that <b>delayed</b> the start of the sweep {{in order to reduce the}} size of this centre-zero, and thereby increase the amount of the screen used for the ground display.|$|R
500|$|Because of his {{experience}} with the Specimens translations, Ripley was chosen to be {{the managing editor of}} the Transcendental publication The Dial at its inception, working alongside its first editor Margaret Fuller. In addition to overseeing distribution, subscriptions, printing, and finances, Ripley also contributed essays and reviews. In October 1841, he resigned his <b>post</b> with The <b>Dial</b> as he prepared for an experiment in communal living. As he told Emerson, although he was happy seeing all the Transcendental thoughts in print, he could not be truly happy [...] "without the attempt to realize them".|$|R
50|$|The precise date of {{establishment}} of hunting in Sussex is uncertain, but in the 17th century the Duke of Richmond formed the Old Chariton Hunt covering a huge territory later to be divided between the Goodwood Hunt and Colonel Wyndham's. The Merstham Hunt used to periodically hunt the area until these hounds were given up in 1835, whereupon the local Henry Steere turned his harriers into foxhounds, hunting the forest country north of Horsham until around 1842, when the hounds were sold to Charles Bethune and extended the hunting country out to Findon and <b>Dial</b> <b>Post.</b>|$|R
40|$|Wheeling Walks, a {{community-based}} {{health promotion}} intervention {{conducted in a}} small city in WV during 2001 {{with support from the}} Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, aimed to motivate sedentary adults, ages 50 - 65, to become more physically active. The target behavior was 30 minutes of daily moderate-intensity walking, consistent with the Surgeon General√ïs recommendations. Local citizens and leaders were involved with intervention planning activities from inception. The initiative included a mass media campaign to inform the community and set the agenda for change, with physical activity messages developed using formative research and based on the Theory of Planned Behavior. Social marketing techniques were employed in an eight-week media campaign that had high levels of market penetration from paid television, radio, and newspaper ads; media relations; and community educational activities. A pre and <b>post</b> random digit <b>dial</b> telephone survey was used to determine campaign effectiveness. As a result of the intervention, 90 % of the target population became aware of the campaign. There was a 14 % net increase in walking, and a 12 % increase in persons moving to a higher level of readiness to change walking behavior. Additionally, advisory board members from the community who helped plan and implement the Wheeling Walks intervention showed significant increases in social capital reflecting higher levels of commitment, trust, and empowerment. Ongoing experience with the intervention has led the investigators and community partners to recognize the necessity of building in environmental and policy supports to create enabling and reinforcing elements to further increase and sustain walking behavior.
