50|$|During design process, ports {{need to come}} up with a <b>port</b> <b>security</b> <b>plan</b> and {{implement}} it. The <b>port</b> <b>security</b> <b>plan</b> should include: security survey and risk assessment, physical security and access control, information security, personnel security, maritime terrorism, drug smuggling, stowaways and alien smuggling, roles/ responsibilities/ legal authorities of port agencies, sea robbery, cargo security and hazardous materials and intelligence.|$|E
40|$|The International Ship and Port {{facility}} Security Code (ISPS) {{has many}} measures {{of maintaining the}} security of the ship and port. In addition, a required <b>port</b> <b>security</b> <b>plan</b> facilitates the access of visitors, land-based labourers and workers, and seafarers ’ welfare to ships in ports. Certainly the code will enhance maritime security on board and in ports, but extra work has fallen on an already overburdened crew and master. Although the seafarers ’ support has increased maritime security, they are most likely considered to be victims of terrorist attacks, pirates and armed robbers. Piracy procedures are incorporated into the ship security plan; also stowaways should be prevented through the ship’s own security system. Therefore, they will have extra work required to maintain the required level of security and to detect the threat. On the other hand, the security measures implementation in some countries is creating problems for seafarers to go ashore, and apply for individual visas. In addition, seafarers should maintain ship safety and protect the marine environment. Certainly the code will enhance maritime security and keep the sea and seafarers secure, but {{there is a need for}} proportionate measures that protect seafarers ’ fundamental rights and freedom...|$|E
50|$|In December 2002, new {{amendments}} to the 1974 SOLAS Convention were enacted. These amendments {{gave rise to the}} International Ship and <b>Port</b> Facility <b>Security</b> (ISPS) Code, which went into effect on 1 July 2004. The concept of the code is to provide layered and redundant defences against smuggling, terrorism, piracy, stowaways, etc. The ISPS Code required most ships and port facilities engaged in international trade to establish and maintain strict security procedures as specified in ship and <b>port</b> specific Ship <b>Security</b> <b>Plans</b> and <b>Port</b> Facility <b>Security</b> <b>Plans.</b>|$|R
30|$|<b>Port</b> <b>security</b> on {{the other}} hand, besides {{terrorism}} includes considerations regarding smuggling, stowaway, asylum seekers, illegal immigrants, sabotage, theft and pilferage of cargo. The ISO/PAS 20858 standard was prepared by the ISO Technical Committee ISO/TC 8 “Ships and marine technology”, Subcommittee SC 11 “Intermodal and short sea shipping” is addressing security issues. It should be noted however that this particular standardization document, being a Publicly Available Specification (PAS), has not matured to a homophonous decision as an ISO standard {{but it has been}} accepted by at least the 2 / 3 members of the committee casting a vote. The ISO/PAS 20858 is compatible to ISO 9000 and addresses the <b>port</b> facility <b>security</b> assessment issue, the development of <b>port</b> facility <b>security</b> <b>plan</b> (including countermeasures), and the skills and knowledge required of the personnel involved. The ISO/PAS 20858 is designed to assure that the requirements of ISPS code are met through appropriate security practices that can be verified by an outside auditor. Hence, the ISO/PAS 20858 establishes a framework assisting the development of a <b>security</b> <b>plan</b> as required by ISPS code and drafting a <b>Port</b> Facility <b>Security</b> <b>Plan</b> (PFSP).|$|R

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and its U. S Coast Guard, Transportation Security Agency, and U. S. Customs and Border Protection have key maritime security responsibilities.

40|$|The {{research}} employs {{an adaptive}} cross-disciplinary research strategy {{in an industrial}} example to address port facilities’ inability to assess whether their security systems are efficient. The research combines a twin-pronged approach of first, adapting Markowitz (1952) theory of portfolio selection {{from the field of}} finance to maritime <b>port</b> <b>security</b> to examine each <b>port</b> facility’s <b>security</b> systems as a portfolio; and secondly, through portfolio optimization to construct the optimum theoretical portfolio of security systems drawn from a number of different port facilities owned by Dubai Ports World. The research builds on the existing literature and proposes new definitions of <b>security,</b> <b>port</b> <b>security,</b> <b>port</b> <b>security</b> risk and <b>port</b> <b>security</b> risk management. The research also develops a model of <b>port</b> <b>security</b> risk based on Willis et al’s (2005) definition of terrorist risk. Furthermore, the research builds on the work of Gleason (1980) and examines terrorist attacks on ports and on shipping in ports between 1968 and 2007 and shows, using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, that they follow a Poisson distribution. The contribution which the research makes is in terms of adapting Markowitz (1952) theory to the <b>port</b> <b>security</b> environment; and the modelling and measurement {{of the impact of the}} introduction of new <b>port</b> <b>security</b> technology, changes in background <b>port</b> <b>security</b> threat levels and for the <b>planning</b> of <b>port</b> <b>security</b> in Greenfield sites.

40|$|ABSTRACT The Effects Of <b>Port</b> <b>Security</b> Compliance On The Competitiveness Of European Union Maritime Industry Firms. (May 2013) Jonathan Stone Department of Maritime Administration Texas A&M University Research Advisor: Dr. Joan Mileski Department of Maritime Administration Prior {{research}} has addressed European Union (EU) water transportation policy {{and its impact}} on firm strategy. We extend this research by attempting to measure the effect of <b>port</b> <b>security</b> regulation compliance implementation on the perceived competitiveness of maritime firms located in European Union ports. We ask the question: Can firm specific implementation of required <b>port</b> <b>security</b> compliance enhance or hinder a firm?s competitive advantage? We use Resource-Based Strategic Theory as a framework for evaluating competitiveness. Resource based theory purports that assets and systems can give a firm a competitive advantage if they follow the ?VRIN? criteria of Valuable, Rare, Inimitable, and Not easily substitutable. We ask via email and snail mail survey instrument whether certain security assets, resources and systems are ?VRIN? and whether these assets, resources and systems give competitive advantage to the firm. The type of resources/assets/systems include physical assets such as fencing; ongoing management assets such as communication systems, planning and structuring management assets such as <b>security</b> <b>planning</b> systems; human assets such as employee knowledge; technological assets such as software protection; intangible assets such as a safety culture and financial assets such as cost savings from security compliance. We administer the instrument to all firms operating in EU ports in 2011 - 2012. A list of firms is obtained from IHSfairplay Ports and Terminals Guide. The results of the survey shows that most managers do not perceive a competitive advantage was gained in the way security assets/resources/management systems were implemented. However, a strong minority 34. 12 % of managers did perceive competitive advantage was gained from <b>port</b> <b>security</b> compliance where systems/assets/resources were not easily imitated or the ?I. ? Furthermore, managers perceive where they were located within the port as an important advantage to security and competitiveness...|$|R
