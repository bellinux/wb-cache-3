Corundum that contains ~0.01% of titanium is colorless. If trace amounts of iron are present, a very pale yellow to green color may be seen. However, if both titanium and iron impurities are present together, and in the correct valence states, the result is a deep-blue color.|$|R

[...] But he concluded that [...] "Taine is sadly lacking as a novelist, in style and especially in characterization." ...|$|E
