For this study, the key job responsibilities were the eight standards identified by the American Association of School Administrators Commission on Standards for the Superintendency, chaired by John Hoyle, completed in 1993. The eight standards identified were: leadership and district culture, policy and governance, communications and community relations, organizational management, curriculum planning and development, instructional management, human resources management, and values and ethics of leadership. A total of 207 superintendents with at least three but not more than five years of experience were included in the study. ^ The findings associated with the research questions revealed that superintendents relied on <b>prior</b> <b>administrative</b> experiences significantly more than any of the other four variables to complete each key job responsibility. When all eight key job responsibilities were considered as a whole, <b>prior</b> <b>administrative</b> experiences were relied on significantly more than any other variable.

Rapid regionalization and decentralization policies followed again by nationalization of industry did spur corruption, because drastic change and insecurity (which included job losses and loss of local welfare programs) occurred. Enforcing central economic targets, and the power play to generate obedience to national goals, shifted loyalties to informal ties. Tacitly, the (unintended) coupling of transformation, modernization, and anti-corruption brought about a systemic risk for future economic growth due to the co-optation of Triple Helix-based regional innovation systems by routine corruption.|$|R

The increasing demand and inefficient management of marine sand have resulted in a series of environmental problems and raised great challenges for rational utilization of marine sand. In the long term, resolving management conflicts and improving the efficiency of resource utilization will require a shift in management approach from administrative examination and approval (AEA) of sector-based management to market-based approach of cooperation management. This paper concerns a pilot scheme for market-based resource allocation, and illustrates how the involved agencies could work together to push forward the scheme in a sectoral context. Both achievements and inadequacies of the scheme are presented, and enabling factors are identified, which include <b>administrative</b> <b>authorization,</b> institutional support and approach improvement, which facilitate the success of the scheme.
