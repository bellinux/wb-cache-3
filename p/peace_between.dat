5|$|Complicating {{the account}} of this period {{is the issue of}} the Peace of Callias, which {{allegedly}} ended hostilities between the Greeks and the Persians. The very existence of the treaty is hotly disputed, and its particulars and negotiation are ambiguous. Ernst Badian believes that a <b>peace</b> <b>between</b> Athens and Persia was first ratified in 463 BC (making the Athenian interventions in Egypt and Cyprus violations of the peace), and renegotiated {{at the conclusion of the}} campaign in Cyprus, taking force again by 449–448BC.|$|E
5|$|During {{the long}} period of <b>peace</b> <b>between</b> 1815 and 1846 midshipmen had few {{opportunities}} for promotion, and their warrants were often obtained via patronage.

Spencer had gained his post aboard the Somers via the influence of his father, United States Secretary of War John C. Spencer.|$|E

5|$|John Fine, on {{the other}} hand, {{suggests}} that the first <b>peace</b> <b>between</b> Athens and Persia was concluded in 450–449BC, due to Pericles' calculation that ongoing conflict with Persia was undermining Athens' ability to spread its influence in Greece and the Aegean.

5|$|Just {{prior to}} the {{settlement}} of <b>peace</b> <b>between</b> the Uí Briain and the Norwegians, Muirchertach was not only contending {{with the arrival of}} Magnús, but was also locked in an extended struggle with Domnall Mac Lochlainn, King of Cenél nEógain (died 1121). The agreement of a year's <b>peace</b> <b>between</b> Muirchertach and Magnús, however, turned Magnús from an enemy into an ally. Whilst Magnús appears to have intended for Sigurðr to rule over his recently-won overseas territoriesa region stretching from Orkney to DublinMuirchertach appears to have intended to exert influence into the Isles through his new son-in-law. In fact, during the following year, Muirchertach and Magnús cooperated in military operations throughout Ireland. Unfortunately for Muirchertach, and his long-term ambitions in Ireland and the Isles, Magnús was slain in Ulster in 1103. Thereupon Morkinskinna and Fagrskinna reveal that Sigurðr immediately repudiated Bjaðmunjotheir marriage apparently having been unconsummatedand returned to Norway. There Sigurðr proceeded to share the Norwegian kingship with his two brothers, Eysteinn (died 1123) and Óláfr (died 1115). It would over one hundred and fifty years until another King of Norway ventured into the Isles.|$|E
