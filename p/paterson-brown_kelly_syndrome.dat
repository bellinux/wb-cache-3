It is occasionally known as Paterson-Kelly or <b>Paterson-Brown</b> <b>Kelly</b> <b>syndrome</b> in the UK, after Derek Brown-Kelly and Donald Ross Paterson. however, Plummer-Vinson syndrome {{is still the most}} commonly used name.|$|E
50|$|Iron-deficiency anemia. Iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) may be {{the only}} symptom for CD, {{detected}} in subclinical CD and is accompanied by a decrease in serum ferritin levels. This can cause addition problems (see:symptoms of IDA and certain conditions like such as <b>Paterson-Brown</b> <b>Kelly</b> (Plummer-Vinson). Whereas IDA is corrected on GF diet, refractory disease or gluten-sensitive malignancies can cause persistent IDA.|$|R

40|$|Bone {{resorption}} is {{an ongoing}} process that tends to worsen in full or partially edentulous patients, especially those using PPR mandibular bilateral free end associated with denture in the upper jaw, a condition determined by <b>Kelly</b> <b>Syndrome.</b> The present study evaluates the reabsorption that occurs in the acrylic base of PRPs, through radiographic examination periapical with E-Speed (Kodak). A positioner individual acrylic on plaster model was used 11 patients, who underwent bilateral radiographs {{in a range of}} six months. Referred radiographs were digitized at a resolution of 300 dpi, archived for later subtraction radiography in apropriete software. Through the results remained reveled a small bone resorption,which is higher in the posterior branch. Patients with advanced age, as well as patients with diabetes presents with higher resorption(p< 0, 05), whereas in relation to sex, it can be observed that the incidence of resorption was equal...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: 1. – To {{measure the}} {{alveolar}} resorption processes {{that occur in}} patients wearing mandibular overdentures on 2 implants and fully-removable maxillary dentures, and to evaluate the same process on patients wearing fully- removable dentures on both arches. 2. - To verify whether <b>Kelly’s</b> Combination <b>Syndrome</b> occurs {{in the group of}} patients wearing overdentures. Method and Material: Forty patients were evaluated, of which a “cases” group was formed by 25 patients wearing mandibular overdentures on 2 lower jaw implants and fully-removable dentures on the opposite arch. The other 15 patients formed a control group that wore fully-removable dentures on both arches. Each one of the patients underwent orthopantograms from the moment the dentures were inserted until an average of 6 years later, which were assessed based on the Xie et al. method to estimate vertical bone loss. Once the data was collected, it was subjected to statistical analysis. Results: In terms of the maxillary midline, we observed a greater loss in patients wearing overdentures, which was statistically significant, as it registered 0. 32 mm/year. Mandibular bone loss was 2. 5 times less in patients in the cases group. The rest of the clinical criteria for <b>Kelly’s</b> Combination <b>Syndrome</b> were not observed. Conclusions: <b>Kelly’s</b> Combination <b>Syndrome</b> did not occur in the patients in the cases group. In spite of the greater bone loss on a premaxillary level in this group, the placing of the overdenture on the implants significantly reduced mandibular bone resorption...|$|R
