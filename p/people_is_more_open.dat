50|$|Dialect {{levelling}} occurs {{mostly in}} socially and geographically mobile groups and in contexts {{where people have}} a tendency to adapt to their listener in order to ensure they better understand. People who come to a new town adapt their language and unconsciously leave out local language elements so that the hearer will understand them better. As a result, dialect forms that have a wide geographical and social range tend to <b>be</b> used <b>more</b> often. Eventually these short-term adaptions become long-term changes. Though most of the adjustments happen largely unconsciously, some <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>open</b> to language change and adaptation than others and this influences the extent to which dialect levelling takes place (Kerswill, 2003; Milroy, 2002).|$|R

40|$|Abstract = Most {{reports from}} Western {{countries}} are discouraging {{the establishment of}} direct donation programs since little evidence exists that this approach improves the safety of blood transfusion. However, the infectious disease marker frequencies vary from one region to another and not much {{is known about the}} figures in less individualized, and more culturally uniform societies. The authors compared the fre-quency of infectious disease markers among 14, 253 directed and 1, 228, 132 volunteer blood donors in Korea. The frequency of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) was higher in volunteer donors while the frequency of elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and VDRL was higher in directed donors(p(0. 01). Our data suggest that even in a less individualized society where <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>open</b> to exchange their medical and personal information, directed donation does not confer significant benefit in the pre-vention of transfusion-transmitted diseases...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{relationship}} between cognitive styles and values. Cognitive styles and values are both frequently studied domains, but the relationship between these concepts has been investigated rarely. Individuals increasingly become points of reference in the shaping of values and attitudes. Moreover, <b>people</b> <b>are</b> confronted with <b>more</b> alternatives. Hence, cognitive styles <b>are</b> becoming <b>more</b> important, since they are the vehicles for choosing relevant information and for building our value system. To study differences in cognitive styles the profoundly investigated analytic-holistic dimension was used. Examination of values was based on the theory of Schwarz (1992, 1994). 15, 616 Belgian citizens filled out our self-developed questionnaire. The results revealed different value patterns for analytic and holistic thinkers, indicating that analytic <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> conservative, while holistic <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>open</b> to change. Moreover, two types of analytic thinkers (knowing and planning style) were identified, each attaching importance to different values. As to the dimension of self-transcendence versus self-enhancement, a significant difference was found between the two types of analytic thinkers, as well as between analytic and holistic individuals...|$|R

40|$|Theory and {{research}} in both personality psychology and creativity share an essential commonality: emphasis on {{the uniqueness of the}} individual. Both disciplines also share an emphasis on temporal consistency and have a 50 -year history, and yet no quantitative review of the literature on the creative personality has been conducted. The 3 major goals ofthis article are to present the results ofthefirst meta-analytic re-view ofthe literature on personality and creative achievement, to present a conceptual integration of underlying potential psychological mechanisms that personality and creativity have in common, and to show how the topic ofcreativity has been important to personality psychologists and can be to social psychologists. A common system of personality description was obtained by classifying trait terms or scales onto one of the Five-Factor Model (or Big Five) dimensions: neuroticism, extraversion, open-ness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness. Effect size was measured using Cohen 's d (Cohen, 1988).

5000|$|Although the {{majority}} group may accept part {{or all of}} the minority view, that fact does not necessarily indicate that {{the majority}} has been completely influenced by the minority. A study by Elizabeth Mannix and Margaret Neale (2005) shows that having the support from the majority leader could prove the critical factor in getting the minority opinion to be heard and be accepted. The support of a leader gives the majority more confidence in the merit of the minority opinion, leading to an overall respect for the minority. The strength of the [...] "key people" [...] (Van Avermaet, 1996) comes from the reputation built from their consistency of behaviors and ideas. Involving key people will benefit the minority view because <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>open</b> to hear from others whom they trust and respect. In minority influence, a few influential leaders can influence the opposing majority to the minority's way of thinking.In the end, having a more supportive and active minority group could lead to innovative and better decision-making.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} value of using the dérive and psychogeography {{as a means of}} {{teaching}} research methods to business students. It draws on the experience and reflections of undergraduate students who carried out a derive in a research methods course. It makes a novel contribution to qualitative research practices in business by applying a methodology established in literary circles and sociology to business. Using the dérive illuminates the importance of several issues such as the dominance of the visual and the importance of location. The paper also considers whether certain <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>open</b> to dérives, whether first-year undergraduates are mature enough for such an activity, and whether undergraduates are able to deal with such an informal practice. It considers how early in their education and to what effect students should be exposed to fundamental issues of epistemology and the challenges to orthodoxy. The findings suggest that the setting of the project is consequential and that reflection is an important element in students’ learning from the experience. We may conclude that the deployment of dérive related to psychogeography in teaching research methods in business is viable and productive...|$|R

As a result of coaching sessions, <b>people</b> <b>are</b> becoming <b>more</b> <b>open</b> and <b>more</b> tolerant to different views, this helps organize relationship within organisation based on trust and respect. This change in relationships very positively reflects on employees’ and managers’ motivation to support change. Coaching also stimulates the ability to organize individual’s thinking process more clearly and more structural. In respect to organisations, coaching provides greater goal clarity, better alignment with the role in organisation that facilitates change in the style of management.|$|R
40|$|Most {{information}} spreading models {{consider that}} all individuals are identical psychologically. They ignore, for instance, the curiosity level of people, which {{may indicate that}} they can be influenced to seek for information given their interest. For example, the game Pokémon GO spread rapidly because of the aroused curiosity among users. This paper proposes an information propagation model considering the curiosity level of each individual, which is a dynamical parameter that evolves over time. We evaluate the efficiency of our model in contrast to traditional information propagation models, like SIR or IC, and perform analysis on different types of artificial and real-world networks, like Google+, Facebook, and the United States roads map. We present a mean-field approach that reproduces with a good accuracy the evolution of macroscopic quantities, such as the density of stiflers, for the system's behavior with the curiosity. We also obtain an analytical solution of the mean-field equations that allows to predicts a transition from a phase where the information remains confined to a small number of users to a phase where it spreads over a large fraction of the population. The results indicate that the curiosity increases the information spreading in all networks as compared with the spreading without curiosity, and that this increase is larger in spatial networks than in social networks. When the curiosity is taken into account, the maximum number of informed individuals is reached close to the transition point. Since curious <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>open</b> to a new product, concepts, and ideas, this is an important factor to be considered in propagation modeling. Our results contribute {{to the understanding of the}} interplay between diffusion process and dynamical heterogeneous transmission in social networks. Comment: 8 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} how the Qing state imagined the political incursion of Russian {{culture in the}} Amur River basin, a disputed borderland with the Russian empire. The Qing administration was apprehensive about signs that the indigenes of this area were embracing Russian material customs, and that these <b>people</b> would <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>open</b> to Russian control. Conversion to Russian Orthodoxy, despite a relative lack of missionary activity, and thus submission to foreign religious authorities, were also regarded as a threat. Such concerns were seen as detrimental to the Qing and as strengthening St Petersburg's claim over the Amur. Such anxieties were expressed both in the folk culture of the Amur River indigenes (Orochen, Dagur) {{as well as in}} official Qing documents.

For example, the Ngarinyin name for the art is Gwion Gwion. Other terms include giro giro used by Aboriginal people in the Napier, Broome Bay and Prince Regent River. Australian rock art researcher David Welch notes that these words are probably different regional accents of Kujon, {{the name of the}} bird found in the creation story originally heard by Schultz in 1938. Aboriginal <b>people</b> <b>are</b> also <b>more</b> <b>open</b> in telling foreigners stories regarding the images.

50|$|However, {{in recent}} decades, {{there has been}} a {{significant}} change in the spirituality of the Safwas. Most of them have accepted other faiths such as Christianity and even Islam. About 22% of the Safwas adhere to different Christian denominations. This is a very radical shift for a tribe that is proud of their culture and are basically conservatives. Some of the Christian denominations that have made significant inroads in this community, and therefore have big impacts in changing the worldview of the people, include: the Assemblies of God, Roman Catholics, Seventh-day Adventists, Jehovah's Witnesses, Moravians, etc. Perhaps this diversity of denominations found in Safwaland speaks more eloquently than any other factor when it comes to how open to new ways of spirituality this group of people has become. All these denominations have trained Safwa ministers some of whom take care of their own people and others serve the larger Christian community elsewhere in the country and beyond. Today in most villages, houses of worship of different shapes and sizes may be found. This would have been impossible just a few decades ago.

50|$|Microfinancing {{produces}} {{many benefits}} for poverty stricken, or low- income households. One {{of the benefits}} {{is that it is}} very accessible. Banks today simply won’t extend loans to those with little to no assets, and generally don’t engage in small size loans typically associated with microfinancing. Through microfinancing small loans are produced and accessible. Microfinancing is based on the philosophy that even small amounts of credit can help end the cycle of poverty. Another benefit produced from the microfinancing initiative is that it presents opportunities, such as extending education and jobs. Families receiving microfinancing are less likely to pull their children out of school for economic reasons. As well, in relation to employment, <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> likely to <b>open</b> small businesses that will aid the creation of new jobs.

Since 2008, the hospice {{has run a}} series of events to encourage <b>people</b> to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>open.</b> Two panel discussions have been held, entitled ‘Dying & Death: Let’s Talk about It 2 ̆ 7, which have resulted in good attendance and constructive dialogue. In addition, the local university was commissioned to identify perceptions surrounding talking about dying and death. Focus groups Two focus groups explored viewpoints from the general public and practitioners. The focus group sessions were facilitated, audio-recorded, transcribed, coded and analysed by researchers. Panel discussion The panels consisted of people such as writers, poets, academics, vicars, medical consultants and journalists; the audience was invited to ask questions. Results Four conceptual themes were identified from the focus groups: ▶ Emotions, beliefs and behaviours ▶ Coping with adversity ▶ Difficulties, barriers and tensions ▶ Fostering a participative future. The panel discussions produced dialogue around issues such as {{the role of religion in}} death, what constitutes a good death and euthanasia. Conclusions A lack of openness together with a ‘live forever’ mindset contributed to a cultural shift where the inevitable isn 2 ̆ 7 t discussed; which hinders advance care planning and adversely affects the grieving process. Dying and death was articulated as an upsetting and taboo topic. Some practitioners take the view that they “do not want to upset patients” and choose avoidance, while others are drawn to talking as an integral aspect of their role.
