40|$|Abstract—Synchronous <b>parallel</b> <b>links</b> {{are widely}} used in modern VLSI designs for on-chip inter-module communication. Long range <b>parallel</b> <b>links</b> occupy large area and incur high {{capacitive}} load, high leakage power and cross-coupling noise. The problems exacerbate for applications having low utilization of the links or suffer from congestion of the interconnect. While standard synchronous serial links are unattractive due to limited bit-rate, novel high performance serial links may change the balance. In this paper we show that novel serial links provide better performance than <b>parallel</b> <b>links</b> for long range communications, beyond several millimeters. We analyze the technology dependence of link performance. An example for 65 nm technology is presented, and compare wavepipelined and register-pipelined <b>parallel</b> <b>links</b> to a high performance serial link in terms of bit-rate, power, area and latency...|$|R

40|$|Link {{bundling}} {{is a way}} {{to increase}} routing scalability whenever a pair of Label Switching Routers in MPLS are connected by multiple <b>parallel</b> <b>links.</b> However, link bundling can be inefficient as a Label Switched Path (LSP) has to be associated with a particular link. In this paper, we show that the efficiency of link bundling can be significantly improved if traffic can be effectively distributed across the <b>parallel</b> <b>links.</b> We propose an IP switch architecture that is capable of distributing flows both inside the switch and among the <b>parallel</b> <b>links</b> based on operations that are relatively simple to implement. The switch requires no speedup, guarantees in-sequence packet delivery for a given flow, avoids complex co-ordination algorithms, and can achieve LSP throughput higher than the line rate. By means of simulation using IP traces, we investigate the performance of the proposed switch, and show that the switch achieves good load-balancing performance. We describe extensions to the basic architecture which allows for very large bundle size, handles incremental upgrade strategy, improves reliability, and accommodates non-IP traffic...|$|R

40|$|We {{reconsider the}} well-studied Selfish Routing game with affine latency functions. The Price of Anarchy for {{this class of}} games takes maximum value 4 / 3; this maximum is {{attained}} already for a simple network of two <b>parallel</b> <b>links,</b> known as Pigou’s network. We improve upon the value 4 / 3 by means of Coordination Mechanisms. We increase the latency functions of the edges in the network, i. e., ifℓe(x) is the latency function of an edge e, we replace it by ˆℓe(x) with ℓe(x) ≤ ˆℓe(x) for all x. Then an adversary fixes a demand rate as input. The engineered Price of Anarchy of the mechanism {{is defined as the}} worst-case ratio of the Nash social cost in the modified network over the optimal social cost in the original network.

The objective {{of this research is}} the theoretical analysis and the experimental verification of dynamics and control of a two link flexible manipulator with a flexible <b>parallel</b> <b>link</b> mechanism. Nonlinear equations of motion of the lightweight manipulator are derived by the Lagrangian method in symbolic form to better understand the structure of the dynamic model. A manipulator with a flexible <b>parallel</b> <b>link</b> mechanism is a constrained dynamic system whose equations are sensitive to numerical integration error. This constrained system is solved using singular value decomposition of the constraint Jacobian matrix.

40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} we {{consider}} Nash equilibria for the selfish task allocation game proposed in Koutsoupias, Papadimitriou (1999) [26], where {{a set of}} n users with unsplittable tasks of different size try to access m <b>parallel</b> <b>links</b> with different speeds. In this game, a player can use a mixed strategy (where he uses different links with a positive probability); then he is indifferent between the different link choices. This means that the player may well deviate to a different strategy over time. We propose the concept of evolutionary stable strategies (ESS) as a criterion for stable Nash equilibria, i. e. equilibria where no player is likely to deviate from his strategy. An ESS is a steady state that {{can be reached by}} a user community via evolutionary processes in which more successful strategies spread over time. The concept has been used widely in biology and economics to analyze the dynamics of strategic interactions. We first define a symmetric version of a Bayesian <b>parallel</b> <b>links</b> game where every player is not assigned a task of a fixed size but instead is assigned a task drawn from a distribution, which is the same for all players. We establish that the ESS is uniquely determined for a given symmetric Bayesian <b>parallel</b> <b>links</b> game (when it exists). Thus evolutionary stability places strong constraints on the assignment of tasks to links. We characterize ESS for the Bayesian <b>parallel</b> <b>links</b> game, and investigate the structure of evolutionarily stable equilibria: In an ESS, links acquire niches, meaning that there is minimal overlap in the tasks served by different links. Furthermore, all links with the same speed are interchangeable for every task with weight w: Every player must place a task with weight w on links having the same speed with the same probability. Also, bigger tasks must be assigned to faster links and faster links must have a bigger load. Finally, we introduce a clustering condition–roughly, distinct links must serve distinct tasks–that is sufficient for evolutionary stability, and can be used to find an ESS in many models...|$|R
