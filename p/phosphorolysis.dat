2500|$|The {{first step}} in {{glycolysis}} is phosphorylation of glucose by a family of enzymes called hexokinases to form glucose 6-phosphate (G6P). This reaction consumes ATP, but it acts to keep the glucose concentration low, promoting continuous transport of glucose into the cell through the plasma membrane transporters.

Several cytostatic purine nucleoside analogues proved to be susceptible to PNPHyor-mediated <b>phosphorolysis</b> and a markedly decreased or increased cytostatic activity was observed in Mycoplasma hyorhinis-infected human breast carcinoma MCF- 7 cell cultures (MCF- 7.

Hyor cells and observed a rapid and complete <b>phosphorolysis</b> of this drug when exposed to the supernatant of mycoplasma-infected cells. This conversion (inactivation) could be prevented by a specific PNP inhibitor. These findings correlated well with the high efficiency of PNPHyor-catalyzed <b>phosphorolysis</b> of cladribine to its less-toxic base 2 -chloroadenine (Km = 80 μM). In contrast, the cytostatic activity of nucleoside analogues carrying a highly toxic purine base and being a substrate for PNPHyor, but not human PNP, was substantially increased in MCF- 7.

40|$|Ruminococcus albus has {{the ability}} to intracellularly degrade cello-oligosaccharides {{primarily}} via <b>phosphorolysis.</b> In this study, the enzymatic characteristics of R. albus cellodextrin phosphorylase (RaCDP), which is a member of glycoside hydrolase family 94, was investigated. RaCDP catalyzes the <b>phosphorolysis</b> of cellotriose through an ordered ‘bi bi’ mechanism in which cellotriose binds to RaCDP before inorganic phosphate, and then cellobiose and glucose 1 -phosphate (Glc 1 P) are released in that order. Among the cello-oligosaccharides tested, RaCDP had the highest phosphorolytic and synthetic activities towards cellohexaose and cellopentaose, respectively. RaCDP successively transferred glucosyl residues from Glc 1 P to the growing cello-oligosaccharide chain, and insoluble cello-oligosaccharides comprising a mean of eight residues were produced. Sophorose, laminaribiose, β- 1, 4 -xylobiose, β- 1, 4 -mannobiose and cellobiitol served as acceptors for RaCDP. RaCDP had very low affinity for phosphate groups in both the <b>phosphorolysis</b> and synthesis directions. A sequence comparison revealed that RaCDP has Gln at position 646 where His is normally conserved in the phosphate binding sites of related enzymes. A Q 646 H mutant showed approximately twofold lower apparent Km values for inorganic phosphate and Glc 1 P than the wild-type.

40|$|Amino acid {{sequences}} of enzymes that catalyze hydrolysis or <b>phosphorolysis</b> of the N-glycosidic bond in nucleosides and nucleotides (nucleosidases and phosphoribosyltransferases) were explored using computer methods for database similarity search and multiple alignment. Two new families, each including bacterial and eukaryotic enzymes, were identified. Family I consists of Escherichia coli AMP hydrolase (Amn), uridine phosphorylase (Udp), purine phosphorylase (DeoD), uncharacterized proteins from E. coli and Bacteroides uniformis, and, unexpectedly, {{a group of}} plant stress-inducible proteins. It is hypothesized that these plant proteins have evolved from nucleosidases and may possess nucleosidase activity. The proteins in this new family contain 3 conserved motifs, {{one of which was}} found also in eukaryotic purine nucleosidases, where it corresponds to the nucleoside-binding site. Family II is comprised of bacterial and eukaryotic thymidine phosphorylases and anthranilate phosphoribosyltransferases, the relationship between which has not been suspected previously. Based on the known tertiary structure of E. coli thymidine phosphorylase, structural interpretation was given to the sequence conservation in this family. The highest conservation is observed in the N-terminal alpha-helical domain, whose exact function is not known. Parts of the conserved active site of thymidine phosphorylases and anthranilate phosphoribosyltransferases were delineated. A motif in the putative phosphate-binding site is conserved in family II and in other phosphoribosyltransferases. Our analysis suggests that certain enzymes of very similar specificity, e. g., uridine and thymidine phosphorylases, could have evolved independently.

The variation with time of the concentrations of intracellular alpha,alpha-trehalose and Pi is reciprocal to that of trehalose phosphorylase activity, indicating that the enzyme makes temporary use of the pool of alpha, alpha-trehalose (approx. 0. 42 mmol/g dry cell) via <b>phosphorolysis.</b> The enzyme has been purified, 150 -fold, to homogeneity in 55 % yield and characterized.

The enzyme catalyses the reversible <b>phosphorolysis</b> of alpha,alpha-trehalose into alpha-d-glucose 1 -phosphate and alpha-d-glucose in the absence of cofactors, with a catalytic-centre activity at 30 degrees C of 14 s(- 1). Double-reciprocal analysis of the initial velocities for trehalose <b>phosphorolysis</b> and synthesis yields intersecting patterns, and no exchange reaction occurs between alpha-d-glucose 1 -phosphate and the phosphate analogue arsenate.
