40|$|In {{the present}} study, the {{polycyclic}} aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) genotoxicity was investigated in a one-step predator-prey relationship with the trophic-related marine species. Florida <b>pompanos</b> were fed for 5 and 10 days with pink shrimp post larvae previously exposed to benzo(a) pyrene (BaP) concentrations. Parent BaP body burden was measured in samples of Farfantepenaeus brasiliensis. BaP metabolites were determined in bile samples of Trachinotus carolinus and DNA damage was assessed through the comet and erythrocyte nuclear abnormalities (ENAs) assays in fish erythrocytes. BaP body burden increased significantly with the PAH concentration in pink shrimp PLs {{as well as the}} fish bile BaP metabolites. Both, comet and ENAs assays indicated significant increase on erythrocyte DNA damage of Florida <b>pompanos</b> fed with BaP-exposed pink shrimp on both feeding periods. The trophic route of BaP genotoxicity is discussed as well as the PAH biotransformation as the inducing mechanism for the DNA damages observed.

2500|$|The blue {{trevally}} is {{a moderately}} large fish, growing to a recorded maximum length of 70cm and a weight of 8kg. The species {{is similar in}} general morphology {{to a number of}} other trevallies in the genus Carangoides, having a compressed, oblong body, with the dorsal profile more convex than the ventral profile. Unlike most of the Carangoides, however, the blue trevally’s snout is bluntly rounded, resembling the snouts of the <b>pompanos</b> of the genus Trachinotus and the lips of adults are notably fleshy. Two separate dorsal fins are found, the first having eight spines, while the second consists of one spine and 26 to 34 soft rays; more than any other species in Carangoides. In young adults, the lobe of the second dorsal fin is often falcate, but usually shorter than the head length. The anal fin has two anteriorly [...] detached spines followed by a single spine attached to 21 to 26 soft rays, while the pelvic fin has one spine attached to 20 or 21 soft rays. The lateral line has a gentle anterior arch, with the junction of the curved and straight sections vertically below the 15th to 20th soft rays of the second dorsal fin. The curved section of the lateral line contains 82 to 90 scales, while the straight section has 12 to 17 scales and 26 to 31 scutes. The breast is naked ventrally to origin of the pelvic fins and the base of the pectoral fins, but is interrupted laterally by a moderate band of scales.

40|$|The Echeneoidea {{comprise}} three famiUes of cosmopoUtan tropical/subtropical marine fishes: the Echeneidae (remoras), Coryphaenidae (dolphinfishes), and Rachycentridae (cobia). Complete nucleotide sequences {{from the}} mitochondrial 12 S rRNA, 16 S rRNA, protein-coding ND 2, and nuclear ITS- 1 gene regions {{were used to}} reconstruct the phylogenetic history of these fishes. Parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian analyses of combined data sets resolved trees of similar topology. Congruent with evolutionary hypotheses based on larval morphology, a monophyletic Rachycentridae + Coryphaenidae was resolved with high support. Within a monophyletic Echeneidae, the subfamilies Echeneinae and Remorinae were monophyletic. In agreement with recent morphological analyses, the genus Remora was paraphyletic based on the position of Remorina albescens Temminck and Schlegel, 1850. Consistent resolution within the Remorinae using parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian inference was not achieved with the gene regions surveyed in this study. The superfamily Echeneoidea comprises three of the 160 famiUes that are tradi-tionally placed in the order Perciformes: the Echeneidae, Coryphaenidae, and Rachy-centridae (Nelson, 2006). The Echeneoidea has been grouped with the Carangidae (jacks, <b>pompanos)</b> and the Nematistiidae (roosterfish) {{on the basis of}} prenasal canal ossification and scale structure (Freihofer, 1978). Collectively, these five families make up the suborder Carangoidei (Johnson, 1984; Springer and Smith-Vaniz, 2008). The carangids and echeneoids form a monophyletic group based on three features: these fishes lack the bony stay posterior to the ultimate dorsal and anal pterygiophores, possess two prenasal canal units, and bear a lamellar expansion of the coracoid. Sy-napomorphies that unite the Rachycentridae, Coryphaenidae, and the Echeneidae include absence of supraneural bones, an anterior shift of the first dorsal pterygio-phore, presence of several anal pterygiophores anterior to the first haemal spine, loss of the beryciform foramen in the ceratohyal, tubular ossifications surrounding both prenasal canal units, and elongate larvae with late dorsal fin completion (Johnson...|$|R
25|$|The African <b>pompano</b> (Alectis ciliaris) (also {{known as}} the pennant-fish and {{threadfin}} trevally) is a widely distributed species of tropical marine fish in the jack family, Carangidae. The species is found in tropical waters worldwide, with adults often inhabiting coastlines, while juveniles are usually pelagic, floating with ocean currents. The adult African <b>pompano</b> is similar in appearance to {{the other members of}} the genus Alectis, with the concave shape of the head near the eyes the clearest distinguishing feature. The juveniles are similar to other members of Alectis, having long, filamentous dorsal and anal fin tips which are thought to discourage predators. The species lives in depths less than 100 m, consuming a range of crustaceans and small fishes. The species is of minor economic importance, often taken amongst other tropical midwater fishes by hook and line, while juveniles are occasionally caught in beach seines. African <b>pompano</b> are also highly rated game fish, often considered one of the strongest of the jacks in larger sizes.|$|E
