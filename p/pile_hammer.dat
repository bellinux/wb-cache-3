The pile driving machine is lifted and positioned over the pile by means of an excavator or crane, and is fastened to the pile by a clamp and/or bolts. Vibratory hammers can either drive in or extract a pile; extraction is commonly used to recover steel [...] "H" [...] piles used in temporary foundation shoring. Hydraulic fluid is typically supplied to the driver by a diesel engine powered pump mounted in a trailer or van and connected to the driver head through a set of long hoses. When the pile driver is connected to a dragline excavator, it is powered by the excavator's own diesel engine. Vibratory pile drivers are often chosen to mitigate noise, as when the construction is very close to residence or office buildings, or when there is not enough vertical clearance above the foundation to permit use of a conventional <b>pile</b> <b>hammer</b> (for example when retrofitting additional piles to a bridge column or abutment footing). Hammers are available with several different vibration rates, ranging from about 1200 vibrations per minute to about 2400 VPM; the vibration rate chosen is influenced by soil conditions at the site and other factors such as power requirements and purchase price of the equipment.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this paper}} is to present the {{methodology}} currently followed in the offshore industry for the prediction of the pile fatigue induced by <b>pile</b> <b>hammering</b> during installation. A few decades ago piles were thicker, of lower yield stress and hammers were less efficient. Today, to be cost effective, it is common to use high strength steel resulting in lower pile thickness and increased driving stress together with better hammer efficiency to reduce installation time. Hence fatigue damages are more important. Evaluation of fatigue damages depend on various parameters such as applied stresses, number of blows, Stress Concentration Factor (SCF) and S-N curves. It is shown how fatigue damages are dependant on the choice of the values used for the SCF and S-N curves and also on applied stresses by the hammer, and in the end the impact of these parameters on the residual available fatigue life for the in-place conditions...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability of}} {{hydraulic}} pile driving hammers to overcome energy losses during freefall enables {{a greater proportion}} of the impact energy to be transferred to the pile in comparison to diesel hammers. This percentage, termed the energy transfer ratio, is not routinely measured in practice however, and {{there is an element of}} uncertainty regarding appropriate energy transfer ratios to assume in driveability analyses. In light of such uncertainties, the energy transfer ratios of four- and five-tonne hydraulic hammers were assessed during installation of driven cast-in-situ piles at several sites in the United Kingdom. The piling rigs were fitted with instrumentation which enabled measurement of the hammer velocity (and hence kinetic energy) at impact for each blow during installation, with the corresponding magnitude of energy transferred to the closed-ended steel installation tube ascertained using a Pile Driving Analyser. The results of the study showed that energy transfer ratios were strongly dependent on the hammer drop height, with transfer ratios of 95 % advocated by the <b>pile</b> <b>hammer</b> manufacturer only achievable when a drop height in excess of about 600 mm was used. As such, lower energy transfer ratios may need to be considered in driveability predictions for these pile types (i. e. steel or DCIS piles) if lower drop heights are used during driving.

40|$|Piles are long, slender {{structural}} elements used {{to transfer the}} loads from the superstructure through weak strata onto stiffer soils or rocks. For driven piles, {{the impact of the}} piling hammer induces compression and tension stresses in the piles. Hence, an important design consideration is to check that the strength of the pile is sufficient to resist the stresses caused by the impact of the <b>pile</b> <b>hammer.</b> Due to its complexity, pile drivability lacks a precise analytical solution with regard to the phenomena involved. In situations where measured data or numerical hypothetical results are available, neural networks stand out in mapping the nonlinear interactions and relationships between the system's predictors and dependent responses. In addition, unlike most computational tools, no mathematical relationship assumption between the dependent and independent variables has to be made. Nevertheless, neural networks have been criticized for their long trial-and-error training process since the optimal configuration is not known a priori. This paper investigates the use of a fairly simple nonparametric regression algorithm known as multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), as an alternative to neural networks, to approximate the relationship between the inputs and dependent response, and to mathematically interpret the relationship between the various parameters. In this paper, the Back propagation neural network (BPNN) and MARS models are developed for assessing pile drivability in relation to the prediction of the Maximum compressive stresses (MCS), Maximum tensile stresses (MTS), and Blow per foot (BPF).

40|$|Due to {{the lack}} of {{understanding}} of the cyclic degradation of Rhode Island silts there exists no practical method, numerical model, or otherwise to assist a practicing engineer to determine potential actual hazards to existing structures during pile installation activities. Therefore, the ultimate objective of this research is to predict the onset of significant ground movement during pile driving in silts and to provide practicing engineers with a hazard assessment model that can be utilized to identify the radial extent of significant soil degradation (e. g. the onset of significant induced strains) prior to the onset of construction activities. ^ To meet the research objective, {{a review of the literature}} was performed to determine the applicability of various liquefaction-based analyses to both non-plastic fines (i. e. silts) and for predicting the resulting behavior from pile-induced vibrations. Additionally, a review of the current State-of-Practice was conducted to identify how the hazard of pile-induced vibrations are assessed. It was concluded that energy-based approaches are the most adaptive for this research moreover, the current State-of-Practice does not consider the hazards associated with soil degradation with depth (at best only considers surface vibrations). ^ Secondly, a laboratory-testing program was developed and implemented to determine the response of non-plastic silts in terms of normalized energy capacity. A reconstitution methodology was developed whereby laboratory specimens could be reconstituted to mimic in-situ behavior at any density state through a newly developed normalized density state thus, negating the need for in-situ samples. ^ Lastly, a total stress hazard prediction model was developed based on determining the spatial Factor of Safety, defined as the ratio of normalized energy capacity to normalized energy demand, against the onset of significant movement. The model was then validated against a well-documented case history, wherein the predicted radial hazard extent was in good agreement with the observed deformations. A parametric study was performed to identify model sensitivities. It was concluded that the radial extent of the hazard is most influenced by the effectives stress profile, <b>pile</b> <b>hammer,</b> and pile properties (ultimate capacity, composition, etc.). Therefore, the use of the hazard model, presented herein, would provide practicing engineers with the ability to mitigate potential hazards to adjacent structures during the construction design phase. ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} introducing a so-called continuum numerical model to overcome some of the limitations of the mass–spring–dashpot systems. Two continuum numerical schemes including a finite difference method (FDM) and a finite element method (FEM) are utilized. Unlike the previous continuum numerical models, the adopted models follow a signal matching procedure similar to lumped models. A real driven pile that has been carefully monitored is considered for model verification and validation, for which the dynamic and static test results, soil profile and soil characteristics are available. Among the major advantages of the model are considerations of soil inertia and/or radiation damping effects. A signal matching procedure is followed by changing the strength and deformation parameters of the soil and interface between pile–soil, both at the “End-Of-Drive” (EOD) and “Beginning of Restrike” (BOR). The results indicate a substantial increase in the soil strength parameters of the pile–shaft interface and the soil modulus below the pile tip at restrike. It is found that the effect of radiation damping significantly changes the pile–soil stiffness during <b>pile</b> <b>hammering.</b> The comparisons between FDM and FEM predictions show very good agreements. Two sets of parameters involved in signal matching are introduced for EOD and BOR signal matching analyses, to compare the variations during the soil setup process.

Because most development has occurred in the western waters of Hong Kong, where generally only the humpback dolphin occurs, most of the work has been conducted on that species. Development of large infrastructure projects (such as airports, bridges, expressways, power plants, fuel facilities, and container ports) in Hong Kong often results in land reclamation, dredging and dumping of spoils, pipe and cable laying, percussive and bored piling work, underwater blasting, large increases in vessel traffic, and other impacts.

40|$|Both {{operation}} {{and construction of}} offshore wind turbines induce underwater noise. While {{it is not yet}} clear if operating noise affects the behavior of marine animals, construction noise is considered crucial. Common foun-dation techniques require to drive steel tubes up to 30 m into the seabed. In general, hydraulic <b>pile</b> <b>hammers</b> are used for this purpose. During the erection of a 3. 5 m monopile, peak sound pressure levels of more than 180 dB re 1 µPa have been measured at 1 km distance from the pile driver. These levels are potentially harm-ful to marine mammals like harbor porpoises and induce flee reactions in a large area. Due to larger piles requir-ing higher blow energies, even higher levels are expected in future projects. Hence, noise reduction is manda-tory. Within a joint research project, a concept of practicable noise reducing methods is derived from measured results and numerical simulations on construction noise of offshore wind turbines. Theoretical background and technical realizations are discussed in this paper. Furthermore, results of numerical simulations and of scaled and near full scale experiments are shown. There are two main approaches: 1. Adjusting the parameters of the pile stroke, 2. Use of sound barriers. One of the key parameters of method 1 is stroke duration. Prolonging the impulse not only reduces the sound level, but also shifts the maximum of the acoustic spectrum to lower frequencies, which are less harmful to marine mammals. Vibration pile driving, where appli-cable, also considerably reduces the sound level with respect to impulse pile driving, in particular the peak level. Underwater noise measurements of vibroham-mer are compared to impulse hammer. Method 2 includes various techniques like the well-known bub-ble curtain, but also noise barriers based on sound impedance mismatch between the barrier material and water. Both method 1 and 2 are mutually inde-pendent; when used in combination, their efficiency simply adds up in terms of dB numbers and a very high degree of noise reduction is achieved...|$|R

The mechanisms required to install these piles generally consist of a hammer, hammer lead, a crane, and various support rigging. This study focused on lead sections, specifically, one which was manufactured by Berminghammer Foundation Equipment, Inc. The dimensions and strength of a lead section must be capable of supporting both the <b>pile</b> driving <b>hammer</b> and the longest anticipated pile for a given site. The strength of the section must be capable of withstanding hundreds of tons in compression and bending.

The results show that the neural network models give a good prediction of axial bearing capacity of piles if both stress wave data and properties of both driven pile and driving system are considered in the input data. Verification of the model indica tes that the numbers of data are not always related {{to the quality of the}} prediction...|$|R
