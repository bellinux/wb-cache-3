40|$|Neural {{activity}} patterns {{related to}} behavior occur at many scales {{in time and}} space from the atomic and molecular to the whole brain. Here we explore the feasibility of interpreting neurophysiological data in the context of many-body physics by using tools that physicists have devised to analyze comparable hierarchies in other fields of science. We focus on a mesoscopic level that offers a multi-step pathway between the microscopic functions of neurons and the macroscopic functions of brain systems revealed by hemodynamic imaging. We use electroencephalographic (EEG) records collected from high-density electrode arrays fixed on the epidural surfaces of primary sensory and limbic areas in rabbits and cats trained to discriminate conditioned stimuli (CS) in the various modalities. High temporal resolution of EEG signals with the Hilbert transform gives evidence for diverse intermittent spatial patterns of amplitude (AM) and <b>phase</b> <b>modulations</b> (<b>PM)</b> of carrier waves that repeatedly re-synchronize in the beta and gamma ranges at near zero time lags over long distances. The dominant mechanism for neural interactions by axodendritic synaptic transmission should impose distance-dependent delays on the EEG oscillations owing to finite propagation velocities. It does not. EEGs instead show evidence for anomalous dispersion: the existence in neural populations of a low velocity range of information and energy transfers, and a high velocity range of the spread of phase transitions. This distinction labels the phenomenon but does not explain it. In this report we explore the analysis of these phenomena using concepts of energy dissipation, the maintenance by cortex of multiple ground states corresponding to AM patterns, and the exclusive selection by spontaneous breakdown of symmetry (SBS) of single states in sequences.

INTRODUCTION Modulated signals {{play an important role in}} Power Electronics. For example, Frequency or <b>Phase</b> <b>Modulation</b> (FM, <b>PM)</b> is related to resonant power converters [1] and electronic ballasts of discharge lamps [2].

In these systems, the lamp is driven by a high frequency source in series with an inductor which controls the current (Fig [...] ...|$|R
5000|$|Casio's {{implementation}} of PD used oscillators generated by modulator and carrier waveforms, synchronised {{to each other}} per-cycle. The modulators were various angular waves that could 'distort' the carrier's sine into other shapes, to a degree derived from the [...] "DCW" [...] envelope. In doing so, many harmonics were created in the output. As modulators were rich in harmonic content, they could create spectra more linear, i.e. more similar to traditional subtractive spectra, than Yamaha's <b>phase</b> <b>modulation</b> (PM/FM) synthesis. <b>PM</b> does not require oscillator sync but {{was for a long}} time limited to sine waves, which meant output spectra bore the non-linear hallmark of Bessel functions. PD is a different type of PM - whose very different modulators caused significant difference in operation and sound between PD and PM. Thus the two aren't directly equivalent.|$|R

Based on the maximum-likelihood principle, the optimum schemes for coherently demodulating OMO 2 AM and OMO 2 PM signals on the additive white Gaus-sian noise channel are developed. Union bounds are developed to evaluate the bit error probability characteristics of the optimum schemes. The power spectral density characteristics are studied in terms of fractional power containment. The OMO 2 AM and OMO 2 PM schemes are found to provide not only the same trend as, but also significant improvement over, the conventional OMOAM [1] and OMOPM [2] schemes in spectral efficiency, while exhibiting very different trends in power efficiency. The OMO 2 AM and OMO 2 PM families also provide other choices of power and spectral efficiencies than the efficiencies achieved by the OMOAM and OMOPM families.

50|$|Angle {{modulation}} is a {{class of}} carrier modulation that is used in telecommunications transmission systems. The class comprises frequency modulation (FM) and <b>phase</b> <b>modulation</b> (<b>PM),</b> and is respectively based on altering the frequency or the phase of a carrier signal to encode the message signal. This contrasts with varying the amplitude of the carrier, practiced in amplitude modulation (AM) transmission, the earliest of the major modulation methods used widely in early radio broadcasting.|$|E
40|$|When {{the source}} of a tone moves with respect to a listener's ears, {{dichotic}} (or interaural) <b>phase</b> and amplitude <b>modulations</b> (<b>PM</b> and AM) are produced. Two experiments investigated the psychophysical characteristics of dichotic linear ramp <b>modulations</b> in <b>phase</b> and amplitude, and compared them with the psychophysics of diotic PM and AM. In experiment 1, subjects were substantially more sensitive to dichotic PM than diotic PM, but AM sensitivity was equivalent in the dichotic and diotic conditions. Thresholds for discriminating modulation direction were smaller than detection thresholds for dichotic AM, and both diotic AM and PM. Dichotic PM discrimination thresholds were similar to detection thresholds. In experiment 2, the effects of ramp duration were examined. Sensitivity to dichotic AM and PM, and diotic AM increased as duration was increased from 20 ms to 200 ms. The functions relating sensitivity to ramp duration differed across the stimuli; sensitivity to dichotic PM increased more rapidly than sensitivity to dichotic or diotic AM. This was also reflected in shorter time-constants and minimum integration times for dichotic PM detection. These findings support the hypothesis that the analysis of dichotic PM and AM rely on separate mechanisms. (C) 2003 Acoustical Society of America...|$|R
40|$|A {{mesoscopic}} field-theoretic {{approach is}} compared with neural network and brain imaging approaches to understanding brain dynamics.

Paleocortex exemplified by olfactory EEG has one AM-PM pattern at a time that forms by an input-dependent phase transition. Neocortex shows multiple overlapping AM-PM patterns before and during presentation of CSs. Modeling suggests that neocortex is stabilized in a scale-free state of self-organized criticality, enabling cooperative domains to form virtually instantaneously by phase transitions ranging in size from a few hypercolumns to an entire hemisphere. Self-organized local domains precede formation of global domains that supervene and contribute global modulations to local domains.

50|$|A {{function}} generator is a device which produces simple repetitive waveforms. Such devices contain an electronic oscillator, a circuit that {{is capable of}} creating a repetitive waveform. (Modern devices may use digital signal processing to synthesize waveforms, followed by a digital to analog converter, or DAC, to produce an analog output). The most common waveform is a sine wave, but sawtooth, step (pulse), square, and triangular waveform oscillators are commonly available as are arbitrary waveform generators (AWGs). If the oscillator operates above the audio frequency range (>20 kHz), the generator will often include some sort of modulation function such as amplitude modulation (AM), frequency modulation (FM), or <b>phase</b> <b>modulation</b> (<b>PM)</b> as well as a second oscillator that provides an audio frequency modulation waveform.|$|E
50|$|Each Apollo {{spacecraft}} {{was assigned}} a frequency pair. For certain <b>phase</b> <b>modulation</b> (<b>PM)</b> downlinks, the uplink to downlink frequency ratio was exactly 221/240. The ALSEP lunar surface experiments shared a common uplink and did not,insofar as is known, implement a coherent transponder. (The passive laser retroreflectors left by the Apollo 11, 14 and 15 missions provide much greater accuracy, and have far outlived the active electronics in the other ALSEP experiments.) The Lunar Communications Relay Unit (LCRU) on the Lunar Rover had its own downlink frequency (to avoid interference with the LM) but shared the LM's uplink frequency as it did not implement a coherent transponder. To keep the VHF transmitters on the LM and LCRU from both trying to relay uplink voice and interfering with each other, separate voice subcarriers were used on the common S-band uplink: 30 kHz for the LM and 124 kHz for the LCRU.|$|E
40|$|The {{timing jitter}} of a modelocked laser is {{fundamentally}} {{limited by the}} amplified spontaneous emission in the laser cavity. While one cannot, even in principle, remove this source of noise, one does have control over the pulse timing by using filtering and modulation. In this thesis, {{we report on the}} advances made in developing the understanding of timing jitter and stability in actively modelocked soliton fiber lasers. The main achievements reported here are: the development of a theory for quantum-limited timing jitter for the cases of amplitude and <b>phase</b> <b>modulation</b> (AM and <b>PM,</b> respectively); identification of a set of characteristic coefficients governing the physics of pulse retiming that depend on the laser parameters; construction of an apparatus-including the development of harmonically modelocked soliton fiber lasers in both a ring and a sigma configuration-to measure the predicted coefficients; and residual phase-noise measurements of the quantum-limited timing jitter using homodyne detection. The measurements of the characteristic coefficients and the timing jitter were found to be in good agreement with the theory. In addition, a theory for the case of harmonic modelocking was developed, and it is shown that the supermodes reveal pulse-to-pulse correlation statistics and must be included in measurements and calculations of the timing jitter. For the case of uncorrelated timing jitter between different pulses in the laser cavity, the supermodes are predicted to have the same timing jitter spectrum as the baseband mode, and this is confirmed by measurements. (cont.) A scheme for reducing the timing jitter of a pulse train outside of the laser cavity using group-velocity dispersion and <b>phase</b> <b>modulation</b> is described, and it is shown theoretically that a reduction in the timing jitter is possible, but only {{at the expense of the}} carrier-frequency fluctuations.

50|$|Quadrature {{amplitude}} modulation (QAM) {{is both an}} analog and a digital modulation scheme. It conveys two analog message signals, or two digital bit streams, by changing (modulating) the amplitudes of two carrier waves, using the amplitude-shift keying (ASK) digital modulation scheme or {{amplitude modulation}} (AM) analog modulation scheme. The two carrier waves of the same frequency, usually sinusoids, are out of phase with each other by 90° and are thus called quadrature carriers or quadrature components — hence {{the name of the}} scheme. The modulated waves are summed, and the final waveform is a combination of both phase-shift keying (PSK) and amplitude-shift keying (ASK), or, in the analog case, of <b>phase</b> <b>modulation</b> (<b>PM)</b> and amplitude modulation. In the digital QAM case, a finite number of at least two phases and at least two amplitudes are used. PSK modulators are often designed using the QAM principle, but are not considered as QAM since the amplitude of the modulated carrier signal is constant. QAM is used extensively as a modulation scheme for digital telecommunication systems. Arbitrarily high spectral efficiencies can be achieved with QAM by setting a suitable constellation size, limited only by the noise level and linearity of the communications channel.|$|E
