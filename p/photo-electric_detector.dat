40|$|Accurate {{obscuration}} {{levels at}} the response time of photo-electric smoke detectors {{are needed for}} proper detection modeling and analysis. In recent works, obscuration meters were {{used to measure the}} obscuration level at <b>photo-electric</b> <b>detector</b> response. In this study, aspirated smoke detectors (VESDA) were used to measure this same obscuration level. These detailed measurements were used to reduce the ambient light and the technology difference error associated with the obscuration meters. The use of aspirated smoke detection (VESDA) instead of light obscuration meters displayed increased accuracy for a majority of the experiments conducted in the 2008 report titled "Validation of a Smoke Detection Performance Prediction Methodology" involving flaming and non-flaming incipient fire sources at 3 different ventilation conditions...|$|E
40|$|The aerosol {{soundings}} {{were carried}} out at Syowa Station (69 ° 002 ̆ 7 S, 39 ° 352 ̆ 7 E), Antarctica in October 1983. The vertical distribution of concentrations of Aitken nuclei (particles larger than 0. 002 μm in radii) up to 15 km in height was obtained at 1600 LT October 17 by use of the sonde which comprises an adiabatic expansion fog chamber with a <b>photo-electric</b> <b>detector.</b> The main results are summarized as follows : The mixing ratio of Aitken nuclei higher than 1000 /mg is observed around 750, 600, 300 and above 200 mb, whereas the surface value is a few hundreds/mg. The maximum mixing ratio {{is seen in the}} stratosphere just above the tropopause. The tropospheric high-concentration layer seems to exist commonly over Antarctica, whereas the high concentration in the stratosphere is peculiar to the present sounding. The high concentration in the troposphere may give an evidence for the possible production of new particles through the photochemical gas-to-particle conversion process in the antarctic troposphere. The high concentration in the stratosphere, which may be partly attributed to the effect of eruption of El Chichon, may give an evidence for the possible occurrence of evaporation and recondensation of aerosol particles in the antarctic lower stratosphere...|$|E
40|$|Changes {{in length}} of {{successive}} 0. 5 - 0. 8 mm segments along single muscle fibres of Rana temporaria were recorded during 3 s isometric (fixed fibre ends) tetani at 2. 15 and 2. 60 micron sarcomere length. The measurements were performed {{by means of}} a <b>photo-electric</b> <b>detector</b> system which recorded the distance between opaque markers (ca. 60 microns in width) that were attached to the upper surface of the fibre. The segment length change had an initial rapid phase (1) which coincided with the steep rise of force and a subsequent slow phase (2) which coincided with the upper, rounded portion of the force myogram and the 'plateau' of the tetanus. At 2. 15 micron sarcomere length the majority of the central segments (comprising approximately 90 % of the fibre) shortened to various degrees during phase 1. A considerable redistribution of length occurred during phase 2 in that some segments shortened {{at the expense of others}} which were forcibly stretched. The central region, taken as a whole, shortened by 0. 1 - 0. 5 % during phase 2. The end segments were consistently found to elongate during phase 1. However, they were able to hold the tension, without further elongation, during phase 2. The pattern of length changes within the central region of the fibre observed at 2. 15 micron sarcomere spacing remained largely the same after increasing the sarcomere length to 2. 60 micron. However, in contrast to the situation at 2. 15 micron sarcomere length there was an over-all (0. 4 - 1. 5 %) elongation of the central region of the fibre during phase 2 at the great fibre length. This elongation of the central region was associated with marked shortening of the end segments. The sarcomere length of the end segments (s. 1. e) was compared to that of the central region of the fibre (s. l. c) at various fibre rest lengths. There was no significant difference between s. l. e and s. l. c when the fibre was just taut, i. e. at approximately 2. 1 micron sarcomere length. The following relationship between s. l. e and s. l. c was found to apply for values of s. l. c ranging between 2. 2 and 2. 7 micron: s. l. e = 0. 636 s. l. c + 0. 744 (correlation coefficient, 0. 93). The possibility was explored that redistribution of sarcomere length along the fibre causes the slow climb of force ('tension creep') that occurs during a tetanus at great (greater than 2. 2 micron) sarcomere lengths. Tension creep could be reproduced, after peak force had been attained, during an isometric tetanus by releasing the fibre to shorten within the range 2. 6 - 2. 3 micron sarcomere length.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{describes}} the experiment platform {{for studying the}} scattering characteristic of fire smoke and interference aerosols, which was developed independently by the Shenyang Fire Research Institute of the Ministry of Public Security of China. This paper also introduces the constitution, work principle and key technologies of the platform. By real experiment, the ability of this platform on studying the scattering characteristic of fire smoke and interference aerosol was proved. This paper then presents the scattering intensity distribution data yielded out of that the laser (635 nm) was scattered by four test fires SH 1 -SH 4 conforming to Chinese National Standard GB 4715, and by typical interference aerosols, such as loess dust, water mist and tobacco burning smoke, at angles of 30 o, 90 o and 150 o. The analysis in the data shows that the scattering intensity distribution of fire smoke and interference aerosol demonstrated a stable characterized law, and by the difference of this characterized parameter, each fire smoke and typical interference aerosol can be identified. Thus, multi-angle detection is {{an effective way to}} resolve broadspectrum response proportionality and false alarm rejection for scatter type <b>photo-electric</b> <b>detectors,</b> and a promising developingdirection of intelligent photo-electric smoke detection...|$|R
40|$|The {{distribution}} of entanglement with Gaussian statistic {{can be used}} to generate a mathematically-proven secure key for quantum cryptography. The distributed secret key rate is limited by the entanglement strength, the entanglement bandwidth and the bandwidth of the <b>photo-electric</b> <b>detectors.</b> The development of a source for strongly, bi-partite entangled light with high bandwidth promises an increased measurement speed and a linear boost in the secure data rate. Here, we present the experimental realization of a Gaussian entanglement source with a bandwidth of more than 1. 25 GHz. The entanglement spectrum was measured with balanced homodyne detectors and was quantified via the inseparability criterion introduced by Duan and coworkers with a critical value of 4 below which entanglement is certified. Our measurements yielded an inseparability value of about 1. 8 at a frequency of 300 MHz to about 2. 8 at 1. 2 GHz extending further to about 3. 1 at 1. 48 GHz. In the experiment we used two 2. 6 mm long monolithic periodically poled potassium titanyl phosphate (PPKTP) resonators to generate two squeezed fields at the telecommunication wavelength of 1550 nm. Our result proves the possibility of generating and detecting strong continuous-variable entanglement with high speed. Comment: 5 pages, 3 figures, published in Optics Letter...|$|R
5000|$|Thallium(I) sulfide, Tl2S, is a {{chemical}} compound of thallium and sulfur.It {{was used in}} some of the earliest <b>photo-electric</b> <b>detectors</b> by T. Case who developed the so-called thalofide (sometimes spelt thallofide) cell, used in early film projectors. Case described the detector material as consisting of thallium, oxygen and sulfur, and this was incorrectly described by others as being thallium oxysulfide, which incidentally is a compound that is not known. Case's work was then built on by R.J. Cashman who recognised that the controlled oxidation of the Tl2S film was key to the operation of the cell. [...] Cashman's work culminated in the development of long wave infrared detectors used during the Second World War. Reliable Tl2S detectors were also developed in Germany at the same time. [...] Tl2S is found in nature as the mineral carlinite which has the distinction of being the only sulfide mineral of thallium that does not contain at least two metals. Tl2S has a distorted anti-CdI2 structure.Tl2S can be prepared from the elements or by precipitating the sulfide from a solution of thallium(I), e.g. the sulfate or nitrate. Thin films have been deposited, produced from a mixture of citratothallium complex and thiourea. Heating the film in nitrogen at 300°C converts all the product into Tl2S ...|$|R
40|$|Shizuoka Prefecture in the Tokai {{region of}} Japan has {{designated}} eight model high schools forobservations and studies of earthquake prediction. We have supported {{this program and}} are colla-borating with teachers and students of model high schools. Our duties are to suggest a direction oftheir program, to prepare simple and inexpensive methods for their observation of natural phenomenaassociated with the occurrence of earthquakes, and to study with them on characteristics of precursoryphenomena of big earthauakes. In this paper we have described on some kinds of methods newly designed for the continuousobservation of the variation of ground water level, ground tilt movement and self-potential. To observe the variation of ground water level we designed a new digital water level gauge. It is composed of a float, <b>photo-electric</b> <b>detectors,</b> a digital IC circuit, a up/down counter and LEDdisplay. This water level gauge has very high sensitivity and can detect 1 mm change of water level. Now twenty gauges have been settled on the well {{in or near the}} campus of model high schools andcontinuous observation by them have been carried out. For the observation of ground tilt movements long span water pipe tiltmeters have been set inthe shallow underground of the campus of each high school. They have two components which areperpendicular to each other and spans of more than 50 meters. We calculate the variation of tiltfrom data of changes of water level detected by magnetic sensors. Although water pipes are buriedin 1 meter depth from the ground surface and so a noise level is comparatively high, we can detecta tilt movement of 5 x 10 - 6 radian by only reading output voltage of sensors once in a day. In thecase of continuous recording of signals we can detect a tilt of 0. 1 x 10 - 6 radian. The variation of self-potential is continuously recorded on a paper chart by a multi-channelrecorder. Electorodes were buried in more than 2 meters depth of underground to observe twocomponents of NS and EW. Each component has a span more than 40 meters. In addition to three kinds of observations, short period seismometer and meteorological instru-ments are set in each campus. Some high schools have individual programs owing to their circum-stances. Examples of precursory phenomena associated with a big earthquake observed on the hotspring water at the Matsuzaki High School are shown...|$|R
40|$|X-ray {{polarization}} measurements hold {{great promise}} {{for studying the}} geometry and emission mechanisms in the strong gravitational and magnetic fields that surround black holes and neutron stars. In spite of this, the observational situation remains very limited; the last instrument dedicated to X-ray polarimetry flew decades ago on OSO- 8, and the few recent measurements {{have been made by}} instruments optimized for other purposes. However, the technical capabilities to greatly advance the observational situation are in hand. Recent developments in micro-pattern gas detectors allow use of the polarization sensitivity of the photo-electric effect, which is the dominant interaction in the band above 2 keV. We present the scientific and technical requirements for an X-ray polarization observatory consistent with the scope of a NASA Small Explorer (SMEX) mission, along with a representative catalog of what the observational capabilities and expected sensitivities for the first year of operation could be. The mission is based on the technically robust design of the Gravity and Extreme Magnetism SMEX (GEMS) which completed a Phase B study and Preliminary Design Review in 2012. The GEMS mission is enabled by time projection detectors sensitive to the <b>photo-electric</b> effect. Prototype <b>detectors</b> have been designed, and provide engineering and performance data which support the mission design. The detectors are further characterized by low background, modest spectral resolution, and sub-millisecond timing resolution. The mission also incorporates high efficiency grazing incidence X-ray mirrors, design features that reduce systematic errors (identical telescopes at different azimuthal angles with respect to the look axis, and mounted on a rotating spacecraft platform), and a moderate capability to perform Target of Opportunity observations. The mission operates autonomously in a low earth, low inclination orbit with one to ten downlinks per day and one or more uplinks per week.
