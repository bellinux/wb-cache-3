5000|$|In June, she {{was sent}} {{overseas}} {{for the first time}} for the Diamond Jubilee Stakes at Royal Ascot. On the 30-hour flight from Australia to the United Kingdom, she wore a specially designed [...] "compression suit" [...] which helped blood circulation. The race on 23 June attracted a crowd of 80,000 to Ascot and was broadcast live in Australia, where crowds watched the event on a big screen in Melbourne's Federation Square. Racing over a straight six furlongs on rain-softened turf, <b>Black</b> <b>Caviar</b> won the Diamond Jubilee Stakes by a head from the French-trained filly Moonlight Cloud, with Restiadargent a neck away in third. Nolen sent the mare past the Frankie Dettori-ridden Soul inside the last quarter mile but after establishing a clear lead, he began to ease <b>Black</b> <b>Caviar.</b> Moonlight Cloud moved up on the stands side to draw almost level before Nolen began driving <b>Black</b> <b>Caviar</b> again in the final strides. Nolen said that his over-confidence had been a factor in the closeness of the finish: [...] "It was an error that every apprentice is taught not to do, and I got away with it today." [...] It was discovered during after-race X-rays that <b>Black</b> <b>Caviar</b> had sustained an eight-centimetre muscle tear somewhere in the race. Nolen felt the change in the horse and said he 'thought she'd done enough to get home. I didn't want to annoy her any more.' Moody explained the mare had not coped with the 11,000-mile journey as well as he had hoped or expected. He also described her as appearing [...] "tired and worn out" [...] after the race. Based on <b>Black</b> <b>Caviar's</b> 22 victories, Timeform rated the Diamond Jubilee as her third lowest performance(116). However, an examination by veterinarian Peter Angus and chiropractor Michael Bryant later revealed that <b>Black</b> <b>Caviar</b> sustained a grade-four tear of the quadriceps and a grade-two tear of the sacroiliac during the race. It was announced that <b>Black</b> <b>Caviar</b> would return to Australia to recover and bypass the originally intended second stage of her international challenge in the July Cup. On 26 June, Moody explained that <b>Black</b> <b>Caviar</b> was expected to recover from her injuries and that, after an extended break, she would be prepared for a third Patinack Farm Classic.On 31 July connections decided <b>Black</b> <b>Caviar</b> would not race during the spring carnival.|$|R
