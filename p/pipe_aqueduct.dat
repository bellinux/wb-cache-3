The major aim of the analysis is to determine the structure and properties of transport networks that are important for the emergence of complex flow patterns of vehicles (or pedestrians) through the network such as the Braess paradox [1]. This counter-intuitive phenomenon occurs when adding more resources to a transportation network (say, a new road or a bridge) worsens the quality of traffic by creating longer delays for the drivers, rather than alleviate it.

What often causes confusion is the large amount of evidence of widespread lead poisoning, particularly amongst those who would have had easy access to piped water. This was an unfortunate result of lead being used in cookware and as an additive to processed food and drink, for example as a preservative in wine. Roman lead pipe inscriptions provided information on the owner to prevent water theft.|$|R

40|$|Henry Darcy and Jules Dupuit {{were born}} 1 year apart, were classmates during their {{undergraduate}} and graduate education in civil engineering, and were colleagues in the French corps of civil engineers, with overlapping appointments as inspector general in the early 1850 s. At that time Darcy turned over, to Dupuit, his position as Director of Water and Bridges in Paris and the research on pipe flow he had begun there in 1849. In these pipe flow experiments, Darcy discovered what he {{referred to as a}} “law” of fluid mechanics, which is that above a certain velocity threshold, the head loss is proportional to velocity squared, and below that threshold, the head loss is linearly proportional to velocity. During the remainder of their careers, Darcy and Dupuit applied this law with their collective, extensive, prior knowledge of fluid mechanics, geology, aquifers, wells, and springs to quantitative studies of fluid flow in the subsurface (and also in <b>pipes,</b> <b>aqueducts,</b> rivers, and sand filters). Two monographs by Darcy (1856) and Dupuit (1857) are mutually cited retrospectives on much of this research, submitted at nearly the same time, to the same Corps des Ponts et Chaussées publisher, near the end of their careers. Between these two monographs, many of the fundamentals of quantitative hydrogeology were established, including the equation for groundwater motion, average linear velocity, average travel time, effective hydraulic conductivity for layered heterogeneity, conservation of mass in confined and unconfined flow, the nature of the regional pieziometric surface, porous flow versus flow through discrete fractures and karst conduits, the equation for a cone of depression around flowing wells, superposition of the effects of multiple wells, and capture zone geometries of wells within a regional flow field...|$|R

2500|$|CastelBrando was {{originally}} {{built in the}} Roman age as a defensive fortress {{in order to protect}} the important lines of communication which connected Northern Italy to the countries on the other side of the Alps. Originally there was a garrison here protecting the territory between the Piave and the Livenza rivers in order to facilitate the safe construction of the pre-alpine part of the Via Claudia Augusta, an important Roman road, which linked the valley of the Po River with Rhaetia (modern Austria). The original castrum, dating from 46 AD is still visible today. A recent archaeological excavation has uncovered a [...] diameter bread-oven within the castrum, dating from the same period.

This is true not only as a contribution to the seismic hazard assessment but also for the local planning of residential areas, plants and infrastructures. The 2009 earthquake occurred on the Paganica normal fault (PF hereinafter) and produced 3 km-long, maximum 0. 1 m-high surface rupture along its central section, and secondary slip along nearby tectonic structures. The PF consists of a prominent morphologic scarp formed by the tectonic juxtaposition of Pliocene-middle Pleistocene and late Pleistocene alluvial deposits, and by lower scarps in late Pleistocene-Holocene deposits. The fault, NW-SE striking and SW dipping, runs for a total length of about 20 km along the NE side of the Aterno River valley, a graben-type basin bounded by marked antithetic faults. The limited extent and the small throw of the 2009 surface ruptures, when compared {{to the size of the}} Paganica long-term fault scarp, suggest that the PF probably experienced larger Magnitude earthquakes than the 2009 seismic event. Thus, although the April 6, 2009 earthquake and associated surface faulting caused loss of lives and major damage, we believe that this event does not fully characterize the seismic hazard of the area. Therefore, a campaign of paleoseismological investigations is underway with the aim of defining the Max Magnitude, the average rate of displacement and the frequency of seismic events on the PF and on the nearby faults. An amazing “coseismic” trench, caved by the overpressure produced by the broken <b>pipe</b> of an <b>aqueduct,</b> provided the exposure of a 30 -m wide fault zone of the PF. We show the preliminary results from the analysis of this site, as well as from other sites along the PF. In addition, we also present preliminary paleoseismological data from the antithetic Fossa fault. A major finding at this early stage of our field campaign is the recognition of large displacements (0. 5 to 1 m) associated to individual events affecting deposits of Holocene age based on radiocarbon dating and pottery content...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2013 California's water {{resources}} vary {{throughout the state}} owing to the regions varying topography, diverse climate, {{and the distribution of}} precipitation. Most of the state's precipitation falls over the northern coastal range and the western slopes of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Winter snowpack that accumulates within these mountain basins serves as an efficient means of natural water storage. Moreover, the state's two massive water conveyance systems, the State Water Project (SWP) and the Central Valley Project (CVP), are integrally dependent upon winter snowpack accumulation, and subsequent spring snowmelt runoff. The SWP and CVP's extensive network of reservoirs, <b>pipes,</b> and <b>aqueducts</b> are engineered to collect and transport water from the snowcapped Sierra Nevada Mountains where it is plentiful, to farmland and urban communities where it is scarce but in greatest demand. However, increased warming within these mountain basins is causing a declined winter snowpack, altering the fraction of precipitation occurring as snow, and changing the timing of snowmelt derived streamflow. The loss of this immense amount of naturally occurring stored water, and its earlier arrival at the downstream reservoirs, has profound implications on the state's existing water management infrastructure. This work attempts to address these water management challenges that lie in the foreseeable future. Using a binary based deterministic approach, and a climatologically record of temperature and precipitation, "at-risk" snow dominated regions were identified throughout the Feather River Basin, and nested basins of the San Joaquin Watershed. These "at-risk" regions represent locations that {{would be the first to}} transition from a snow dominated, to a rain dominated precipitation regime under projected future warming scenarios. Future warming projections ranging from 1 °C to 4 °C were analyzed relative to the 1971 - 2000 base period. Results show that if warming trends considered by the IPCC 2007 report to be highly likely continue, nearly all snow dominated regions existing between 1500 and 2100 m in the San Joaquin Watershed would become rainfall dominated. Within the Feather River Basin, in the Sacramento Watershed, implications are even more alarming. A 3 °C warming in February would result in approximately 87 % of the regions previously snow covered area (SCA) becoming rainfall dominated; only 12 % of the basin would remain snow covered. The decline of winter snowpack within all six study basins is closely correlated with elevation and average winter temperatures. Lower elevation, snow dominated regions near the rain to snow transition zone are highly sensitive to warmer temperatures relative to higher elevation, colder snow dominated regions. Furthermore, warming during high precipitation months, from December to February, would yield the largest reductions in loss of Snow Water Equivalent (or SWE). The loss of this immense amount of naturally occurring stored water, and its earlier arrival at the downstream reservoirs poses challenges and opportunities for California's water managers. For reservoir managers, adapting to a rapidly changing climate would require updating rigid flood control rule curves that were established based on hydrological trends during the first half of the twentieth century. Developing greater flexibility into flood-control rule curves could allow reservoir managers to store more water in the winter, thereby mitigating the consequences of snow loss from natural stored water sources. Faced with an expanding population and increased strains on {{water resources}} availability, sustaining future water demands hinges on developing adaptive water management strategies. By understanding basin and, at a finer scale, elevation specific vulnerability to snow loss due to warming, water managers can begin to guide effectual adaptation strategies...|$|R
50|$|After this attack, Milan was not bombed for {{six more}} months, {{but at the}} {{beginning}} of August 1943, following the fall of Mussolini, it was decided to start a series of heavy bombings on the main Italian cities, to persuade the Badoglio government to surrender.On the night of 7/8 August 1943, 197 bombers took off from Great Britain to carry out a simultaneous bombing of Milan, Turin, and Genoa.Milan was bombed by 72 aircraft (two of which were shot down by AA fire), which dropped 201 tons of bombs, mainly incendiaries. Large parts of the city centre were set ablaze; 600 buildings were destroyed, with 161 victims and 281 wounded among the population. The only factory that was damaged was the Pirelli plant. The headquarters of the Corriere della Sera were hit again and partly destroyed; among the public and historical buildings that suffered heavy damage were the Sforza Castle, the Natural History Museum, the Villa Belgiojoso Bonaparte and Palazzo Sormani. The Pinacoteca di Brera was also hit. Public transport was no longer possible in the city centre, as most of the streets were obstructed by ruins or sprinkled with craters.On the night of 12/13 August, the Bomber Command launched its heaviest raid on Milan and any Italian city. 504 bombers (321 Lancasters and 183 Halifax) took off from English bases, and 478 of them reached Milan and dropped 1,252 tons of bombs (670 explosive bombs and 582 incendiary bombs), including 245 4,000-lb blockbusters and 380,000 incendiary devices, over the city. This was the heaviest single air raid ever suffered by an Italian city.The bombing caused massive fires in many parts of Milan; the fires drew air from the surrounding countryside, creating winds that reached a speed of 50 km/h, an event that usually heralded a firestorm, which however did not materialize (owing to the humid climate, in addition to the previously mentioned urbanistic traits typical of Italian cities, {{and the fact that the}} raid was heavy but not very concentrated). Most of Milan’s most famous buildings were hit during the raid; the Sforza Castle was further damaged, Palazzo Marino (the city hall) and Santa Maria delle Grazie were partly destroyed, the San Fedele Church and the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II suffered heavy damage. The Milan Cathedral was also hit by some bombs. The Alfa Romeo plant and the fair ground were also damaged.The death toll, although never fully ascertained, was an estimated 700 deaths; casualties were not higher because about 900,000 of the city’s 1,150,000 inhabitants had already left after the previous attacks. Most of those who were still in Milan evacuated the city on August 13. The RAF lost three bombers.On the night of 14/15 August, fires were still raging when another bombing was carried out by 134 Lancasters (ouf of 140 which had originally taken off; one was lost), which dropped 415 more tons of bombs. Several factories (Breda, Pirelli, Innocenti, Isotta Fraschini) and the Farini marshalling yard were badly hit; the Sforza Castle and the Royal Palace were further damaged, and Teatro Dal Verme was partly destroyed, as was the Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore. The Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio also suffered heavy damage. The few remaining citizens helped firefighters and UNPA (Unione Nazionale Protezione Antiaerea, National Anti-Aircraft Protection Union) in the attempts to control the fires, but the destruction of the <b>aqueduct</b> <b>pipes</b> hampered the efforts. The official death toll of this raid was of only nine killed, presumably due to the small number of people who were still in the city.On the following night, 186 Lancasters (13 more bombers did not reach the target; 7 were lost, mainly to Luftwaffe fighters on the way back) carried out a final raid, during which they dropped an additional 601 tons of bombs. Several districts suffered further damage; the cathedral was hit again, and the La Scala theatre and the Ospedale Maggiore were heavily damaged; the La Rinascente store was destroyed. 183 people were killed.|$|R
