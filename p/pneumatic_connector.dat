40|$|The mode of {{road freight}} {{transportation}} changes from single vehicle transport to drop and pull transport. The efficiency, safety, {{and reliability of}} coupling between semi-trailer towing vehicle and semi-trailers {{is the key to}} developing drop and pull transport. Some technical clauses of standards on connection between semi-trailer towing vehicle and semi-trailers are not suitable requirements for drop and pull transport, and application status is not optimistic. This paper puts forward some suggestions based on analysis of articulated vehicle dimensions, interchangeability between semi-trailer towing vehicle and semi-trailers, electrical and <b>pneumatic</b> <b>connector,</b> fifth wheel kingpin, trailer landing gears, and so on, that would provide a reference to revise the relevant standards.

40|$|The Ranger {{program at}} the Space Systems Laboratory (SSL) at the University of Maryland is a {{demonstration}} of an extremely low cost, space flight experiment. The Ranger vehicle is designed to perform teleoperated spacecraft maintenance. Completing the various tasks included in spacecraft maintenance requires several specific tools. This paper describes the Ranger interchangeable end effector mechanism (IEEM). Its design allows Ranger to change end effectors to utilize the appropriate tool for the various tasks. The Ranger vehicle is designed with four manipulators. A seven degree-of-freedom (DOF) grappling manipulator securely attaches the vehicle to the work site. A 6 DOF camera positioning manipulator allows the operator to position a stereo pair of video cameras for visual feedback. The two remaining manipulators are the 7 DOF dexterous arms. They are the primary means by which Ranger accomplishes its required tasks. At {{the end of each}} of these dexterous manipulators is an IEEM. This paper begins with a brief overview of the Space Systems Laboratory and the Ranger program. The constraints leading to the requirements for an IEEM are described. The following section then describes the design strategies and the down selection process resulting in two candidate designs, taper and <b>pneumatic</b> <b>connector</b> type. Next, the leading candidate design is described in detail, followed by a preliminary discussion of failure modes and planned testing. The paper concludes with a brief review and a section discussing future work...|$|E
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this paper was to develop a {{selection}} method of the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>connectors</b> for directional 3 / 2 valve. The method was established to minimize resistance and loss of pressure in the valve with mounted pneumatic connections for the selected pipe diameters. Directional valve was modeled in 3 D CAD software SolidWorks while 3 D models of the air connections have been downloaded from the website of one of the leading suppliers of pneumatic. Based on developed solid model the simulation of compressed air flow in the software for computational fluid dynamics Ansys CFX was conducted. The studies using CFD methods helped to determine which air connections best meet the assumptions. Performed numerical tests enable proper selection of items to the newly designed pneumatic systems for a particular group of valves. As a consequence, this translates into a reduction in energy consumption and improve the efficiency of the entire pneumatic complex system. ...|$|R
50|$|Hybrid {{connectors}} have housings with inserts {{that allow}} the intermixing of many connector types, such as those mentioned above. These housings may also allow intermixing of electrical and non-electrical interfaces, examples of the latter being <b>pneumatic</b> line <b>connectors,</b> and optical fiber connectors. Because hybrid connectors are modular in nature, they tend to simplify assembly, repair, and future modifications. They also allow the creation of composite cable assemblies that can reduce equipment installation time by {{reducing the number of}} individual cable and connector assemblies.|$|R
50|$|Being an evolved {{version of}} the UIC AK69e coupler, the C-AKv coupler has the same basic outline as the SA3 coupler.Unlike the Russian SA-3 coupler, however, {{connectors}} for brake air lines and - if required - electric conduits are integrated into the coupler, which are automatically connected while coupling up. Also, these <b>pneumatic</b> and electric <b>connectors</b> are compatible with the buffers and chain setup, as opposed to previous types.|$|R
