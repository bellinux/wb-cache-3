50|$|Typically, {{the rate}} at which a {{molecule}} rotates is indicative of its size. When a fluorescent-labelled molecule (tracer) binds to another molecule the rotational motion will change, resulting in an altered intensity of plane-polarized light, which results in altered fluorescence polarization. Fluorescence polarization immunoassays employ a fluorophore bound antigen that when bound to the antibody of interest, will increase fluorescence polarization. The change in polarization is proportional to the amount of antigen in sample, and is measured by a fluorescence <b>polarization</b> <b>analyzer.</b>|$|E

40|$|In the {{recently}} developed technique of X-ray Birefringence Imaging, molecular orientational order in anisotropic materials is studied by exploiting the birefringence of linearly polarized X-rays with energy {{close to an}} absorption edge of an element in the material. In the experimental setup, a vertically deflecting high-resolution double-crystal monochromator is used upstream from the sample to select the appropriate photon energy, and a horizontally deflecting X-ray <b>polarization</b> <b>analyzer,</b> consisting of a perfect single crystal with a Bragg reflection at Bragg angle of approximately 45 °, is placed downstream from the sample to measure the resulting rotation of the X-ray polarization. However, if the experiment is performed on a synchrotron bending-magnet beamline, then the elliptical polarization of the X-rays out of the electron orbit plane affects {{the shape of the}} output beam. Also, because the monochromator introduces a correlation between vertical position and photon energy to the X-ray beam, the <b>polarization</b> <b>analyzer</b> does not select the entire beam, but instead selects a diagonal stripe, the slope of which depends on the Bragg angles of the monochromator and the <b>polarization</b> <b>analyzer.</b> In the present work, the final background intensity distribution is calculated analytically because the phase space sampling methods normally used in ray traces are too inefficient for this setup.

40|$|As {{discussed}} below, Bell's inequalities {{and experimental}} results rule out commutative hidden variable models {{as a basis}} for Bell correlations, but not necessarily non-commutative probability models.

The probability calculus used is associated with chaotic light. Joint wave intensity correlations at spatially separated <b>polarization</b> <b>analyzers</b> are computed using common information originating at the source.

40|$|International audienceIon-exchange {{in glass}} {{substrate}} {{has long been}} an enabling technology for optical waveguides device manufacturing. Thus, in the last years, hybridization of ion-exchanged glass waveguides components has become a promising method for functional integration. In that context, we propose a Integrated acousto-optic <b>Polarization</b> <b>Analyzer</b> Sensor (IPAS) made by ion-exchange in a glass substrate. The IPAS consists in two Y-junctions that give three different outputs. The first one is simply one output waveguides of the first Y-junction. The two other outputs are the waveguides following the second Y-junction. A piezoelectric plate is placed over the entrance waveguide of the second Y-junction. It creates an artificial anisotropy when it is excited electrically. For each one of the three output signals, a polarizer is inserted between the waveguide's end and a photodetector. The IPAS is a compact hybrid realization insensitive to vibrations and easy to realize. It is capable to determine, with adequate signal processing, the polarization state of a light beam. Experimental results are obtained with a single buried straight waveguide made by low birefringence Ag+↔Na+ ion-exchange.

40|$|ABSTRACT Microspectrophotometric {{measurements}} of isolated crayfish rhabdoms illuminated transversely show that their photosensitive absorption exhibits a dichroic ratio of 2 in situ. The major absorption axis matches the axial {{direction of the}} closely parallel microvilli comprising the receptor organelle. Since these microvilli are regularly oriented transversely in about 24 layers, with the axes of the microvilli at 90 ° in alternate layers, transverse illumination of a properly oriented rhabdom displays alternate dichroic and isotropic bands. Because all the microvilli from any one cell share the same orientation, the layers of microvilli constitute two sets of orthogonal <b>polarization</b> <b>analyzers</b> when illuminated along the normal visual axis. Furthermore, since the dichroic ratio is 2 and transverse absorption in isotropic bands {{is the same as}} that in the minor absorbing axis of dichroic bands, the simplest explanation of the analyzer action is that the absorbing dipoles of the chromophores, as in rod and cone outer segments, lie parallel to the membrane surface but are otherwise randomly oriented.
