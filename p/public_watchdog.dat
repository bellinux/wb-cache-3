40|$|The {{inherent}} lack {{of control}} over the Internet content resulted in proliferation of online material that can be potentially detrimental. For example, the infamous “Anarchist Cookbook ” teaching how to make weapons, home made bombs, and poisons, keeps re-appearing in various places. Some websites teach how to break into computer networks to steal passwords and credit card information. Law enforcement, security experts, and <b>public</b> <b>watchdogs</b> started to locate, monitor, and act when such malevolent content surfaces on the Internet. Since the resources of law enforcement are limited, it may take some time before potentially malevolent content is located, enough for it to disseminate and cause harm. Currently applied approach for searching the content of the Internet, available for law enforcement and <b>public</b> <b>watchdogs</b> is by using a search engine, such as Google, AOL, MSN, etc. We have suggested and empirically evaluated an alternative technology (called automated question answering or QA) capable of locating potentially malevolent online content. We have implemented a proof-of-concept prototype that is capable of finding web pages that may potentially contain the answers to specified questions (e. g. “How to steal a password?”). Using students as subjects in a controlled experiment, we have empirically established that our QA prototype finds web pages that are more likely to provide answers to given questions than simple keyword search using Google. This suggests that QA technology can be a good replacement or an addition to the traditional keyword searching for the task of locating malevolent online content and, possibly, for a more general task of interactive online information exploration...|$|R

5000|$|In 2008 {{there was}} {{implemented}} the Federal Law ‘On Public Oversight of Human Rights in Places of Detention and Assistance to Persons in Places of Detention’. In {{line with the}} Law the Civic Chamber coordinates the work on creation of <b>public</b> <b>watchdog</b> committees in the RF entities. Adoption of the Federal Law ‘On Basic Principles of Public Oversight in the Russian Federation’ in July 2014 became a significant milestone and recognition of the Civic Chamber performance efficiency.The Federal Law establishes the legal framework for organising and carrying out public oversight, its goals and objectives, principles and forms, as well as procedures and methods for determining and disclosing its results.The Law stipulates the right of citizens and public organisations to engage in carrying out public oversight, and sets forth subjects and objects of public oversight, their legal status, rights and responsibilities, and forms of cooperation. The Law enables Russian citizens to exercise their right to participate in managing state affairs, {{in accordance with the}} Constitution of the Russian Federation (Article 32). Public oversight is being increasingly approached as a platform for dialogue between civil society and public authorities. By encouraging search for solution to social problems public oversight provides rise of both civil activism and social responsibility. Public councils within ministries and agencies are permanent advisory and consultative bodies of public oversight. They are designed to ensure cooperation between citizens of Russia and bodies of federal, regional and local power {{to take into account the}} requirements and interests of citizens, to protect their rights and freedoms in developing and implementing state policy. Public councils are aimed at monitoring activities of federal executive authorities, including public procurement. Public councils have been established at 53 federal bodies of power (e.a. Federal Security Service, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Internal Affairs).In 2015 the Civic Chamber and Russian Governmental Expert Council introduced a new procedure for establishment of councils, with 75% of public councils members to be nominated by the Civic Chamber of the Russian Federation and the rest 25% by the Russian Governmental Expert Council. Such proportion provides a reasonable balance between representatives of civic organisations and expert community. Public expert examination is considered to be one of the key instruments of public oversight. According to the law, public expert examination is an analysis and assessment of acts and decisions made by central and local authorities, inspection of documentation with regard to compliance with legislation, human and civil rights and freedoms, rights and legitimate interests of non-governmental, non-profit organizations (NGOs and NPOs). Over the past ten years the Civic Chamber examined more than 500 draft laws relating to various spheres - from state-building to family and childhood support. Most expert examinations contain proposals and additions to draft laws. As stated before, the Civic Chamber’s conclusions and proposals serve as recommendations.In 2014 the Civic Chamber tried a new approach to expert examination - the so called ‘zero readings’ of draft normative legal acts as a part of improvement of lawmaking process. In other words, ‘zero readings’ mean public participation not only in the assessment of prepared draft documents, but also contribution to the creation of draft documents, i.e. discussion of conceptual basis, formulation of basic ideas. ‘Zero readings’ encourage open dialogue between civil society and authorities. Accepted by society, ‘zero readings’ became a regular fixture of the Civic Chamber. In 2014 there were held over 20 ‘zero readings’, taking part in which were experts in economic and social spheres. In 2015 the number has doubled, which is evidence of a demand for this initiative.To conclude, the examination activities of the Civic Chamber aim at accommodation of socially important interests of the RF citizens, NGOs, public and local authorities.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT This study {{examines}} {{the role of}} the media in the resource driven conflicts of the Niger Delta region of Nigeria.

It recognises the important role the media plays and interrogates the response of the local communities to the media. The findings of this study show that {{the role of the}} media has hugely impacted the conflicts and the principal actors rely immensely on media-driven campaigns in pursuit of their political goals. However, the Nigerian media, due to the challenges it faces from its political economic structure, stands the risk of being manipulated by actors’ public relations machinery and therefore, needs to focus on delivering to the Nigerian people and the Niger Delta citizens in particular, its corporate social responsibility role of <b>public</b> <b>watchdog.</b> While the media’s impact on the conflict has generated both positive and negative effects, as the conflicts are still playing out, it is hoped that the media’s role, would contribute to speeding up the conflict resolution process, which is still in its infancy...|$|E

While there is evidence of both cooperation and competition between the two in the post-crisis era, a predominantly competitive relationship between private regulators and <b>public</b> <b>watchdogs</b> may severely undermine the practical importance of co-governance arrangements. A significant degree of cooperation between private regulators and public supervisors is key to ensuring their effectiveness.

40|$|This {{case study}} {{examines}} {{the role of}} the Forest Practices Board, an independent <b>public</b> <b>watchdog</b> in the forest sector of British Columbia. British Columbia is Canada’s most forest-dependent province with 62 % of the province covered in forest and a forest industry that generates $ 1. 2 billion revenue p. a. and directly employs 4. 4 % of the province’s workforce. The BC forest industry came to international attention during the so-called ‘war in the woods ’ in the 1980 s/ 90 s, when there was high profile protest over the damage to BC’s unique fauna and flora caused by a relatively unregulated industry. Confrontation between the government and environmentalists peaked in 1993, when the arrest of some 900 protesters provoked adverse publicity both domestically and internationally. The government responded in 1995 by passing the Forest Practices Code and establishing a Forest Practices Board (FPB) to provide an independent 3 rd party view of (i) the compliance of licensees with the Code; (ii) the efficacy of the Code; and (iii) Government administration of the Code. The FPB carries out audits of companies, of the government agency responsible for developing and auctioning timber sales licences, and of the government’s compliance and enforcement branch.

40|$|The {{gap between}} what is {{actually}} {{happening in the world}} and how powerful interests try to portray what is happening is ever widening. Due to an increase in 'spin' and a decrease in resources spent on breaking news from media production houses, the role of journalism as a <b>public</b> <b>watchdog</b> has been significantly eroded. Institutions of higher education are an obvious place to assist in reinstating the notion of the media as the 'fourth estate'. Putting news back on the agenda as a matter -of social conscience and public debate means teaching students deeper research skills, often neglected by the media industry where time constraints of deadlines often work against investigative journalism. It is in the context of university education that students can engage with the issues, values and skills that will enable them to develop a sense of pro-activity in newsgathering. This paper reflects on two investigative journalism subjects taught within the postgraduate coursework program at the University of Tasmania between 2003 and 2005. It explores the successes and pitfalls of guiding students through the process of researching and crafting the investigative story. This paper argues that mentoring students to gain publication of their research in the media not only better equips them to enter the professional arena but also takes their stories beyond their immediate academic context to connect with a wider audience thus making a valuable contribution towards reinstating the notion of the media as a fourth estate...|$|E
40|$|Trade secret law arose to help {{companies}} protect {{confidential information}} (e. g., the Coca-Cola formula) from competitors seeking to copy their innovative efforts. But companies increasingly use trade secret law {{to block a}} wide swath of information from the scrutinizing eyes of consumers, <b>public</b> <b>watchdog</b> groups, and potential improvers. Companies can do this, in part, because trade secret law lacks clear limiting doctrines that consider the social benefits of unauthorized use. For example, trade secret law makes no allowance for the departing employee that uses proprietary information to create a substantially improved product or disclose public health risks. This Article argues that trade secret law 2 ̆ 7 s indifference to the social benefits of unauthorized use stands in contrast to other intellectual property doctrines, like patent and copyright.

40|$|Background: Previous {{research}} has shown that the media can play a role in shaping consumer perceptions during a public health crisis. In order for public health professionals to communicate well-informed health information to the media, it is important that they understand how media view their role in transmitting public health information to consumers and decide what information to present. This paper reports the perceptions of media actors from three countries about their role in reporting information during a food incident. This information is used to present ideas and suggestions for public health professionals working with media during food incidents. Methods: Thirty three semi-structured interviews with media actors from Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom were conducted and analysed thematically. Media actors were recruited via purposive sampling using a sampling strategy, from a variety of formats including newspaper, television, radio and online. Results: Media actors said that during a food incident, they play two roles. First, they play a role in communicating information to consumers by acting as a conduit for information between the public and the relevant authorities. Second, they play a role as investigators by acting as a <b>public</b> <b>watchdog.</b> Conclusion: Media actors are an important source of consumer information during food incidents. Public health professionals can work with media by actively approaching them with information about food incidents; promoting to media that as public health professionals, they are best placed to provide the facts about food incidents; and by providing angles for further investigation and directing media to relevant and correct information to inform such investigations. Public health professionals who adapt how they work with media are more likely to influence media to portray messages that fit what they would like the public to know and that are in line with public health recommendations and enable consumers to engage in safe and health promoting behaviours in response to food incidents...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{considers}} {{the role of}} the mainstream South African print media in perpetuating discrimination during the years of legalised racial discrimination - commonly known as apartheid - from when the Herenigde Nationale Party took power in May 1948 with an unprecedented 28 -seat swing under the leadership of 74 -year-old Dr Daniel F. Malan until it was replaced by the African National Congress, black-dominated unity government in April, 1994. Against an historical background, it focuses on the agenda and efforts of the mainstream metropolitan print media during the apartheid era, the build-up to the first non-racial elections, and the media 2 ̆ 7 s role in the immediate post-apartheid era. Race and class-based inequalities have always been a feature of South African life since settlement when the Dutch arrived at the Cape of Good Hope in 1652. The era of racial segregation can broadly be categorised as starting from 1910 to 1948, the Immigrant Regulation Act of 1913 that prevented the free movement of Indians across the provincial borders of Natal, which also placed restrictions on Indians owning land outside Natal province. Black land ownership was subjected to similar regulations with the Scheduled Areas of the Native Lands Act of 1913 and later the Native (Urban Areas) Act. But it was from 1948 that the era of apartheid started under the National Party leader Dr Malan, known as the father of apartheid, a racially discriminatory and evil practice based entirely on racial superiority and aimed at keeping the minority white tribe of Africa in control over the indigenous people. This 2 ̆ 7 separate development 2 ̆ 7 policy was already entrenched in South African society by the time the National Party took control after the 1948 elections, but Malan legislated oppression by introducing various Acts of Parliament and in 1953 disenfranchised the 2 ̆ 7 Coloured 2 ̆ 7 people by removing them from the voters 2 ̆ 7 role. Instead of opposing this blatant racism and discrimination that lasted nearly half a century, the South African mainstream print media 2 ̆ 7 both the English and Afrikaans language press 2 ̆ 7 embraced the new direction in the early years with an enthusiasm that reflected poorly on {{the role of the}} press. During the early reign of the National Party, from 1949 to the mid- 50 s, the English-language newspapers were weak and fearful, lacked integrity and honesty, and failed in their duty as <b>public</b> <b>watchdog.</b> While the Afrikaans-language newspapers were developing to support government policies, the English press shared similar views. Both the English and Afrikaans press failed in their duties as the Fourth Estate in keeping a watchful eye on government. They never opposed the status quo and offered little or no support for a system of equality for all the peoples of South Africa. Although, in many ways the press was severely restricted in performing its proper role, ultimately it was a white controlled press which profited from apartheid. This thesis argues that despite its efforts, fundamental political change was never the agenda of the press, nor was equality of the various races. Definitely not the Afrikaans press and certainly not the English press despite the role that it seeks to claim in the post-apartheid era as a de facto opposition and a constant nagging thorn in the side of government. At times the English press wore the mantle of the opposition press and chided the government on various excesses but at the same time remained a conservative institution that practised much the same discriminatory policies of apartheid. Now, as South Africa continues along a new path of democracy, it is not a question of whether there is need for a reappraisal of the media in the post-apartheid era, but what shape or form it should take. This thesis aims to redirect the functions and role of the national print media and suggests that while the owners and the gatekeepers remain the same, on their past record, there is a justifiable cause for concern in a country struggling to come to terms with democracy and concludes that fundamental change is needed. By way of conclusion, I attempt to show that the South African print media, despite being hindered by a variety of laws to suppress criticism of the government, was at best hypocritical, at worst inherently racist and secular, tacitly supportive of the apartheid regime during the rule of the Nationalists and is now in need of reorganisation and fundamental structural change to meet the future challenges in a redeveloping nation. It is not a case of whether that change is effected but how it will be done that is at issue. How that change will be effected depends both on a willingness for change on the part of the major publishers, full integration and a more balanced racially-representative staff, as well as a commitment to open government on the part of the ruling establishment. With the demise of the National Party government and the introduction of the first non-racial parliament, it is my contention that it is now timely to forge a new media order, incorporating the best of what is good in the rest of the world and shedding that which is cumbersome while at the same time being sensitive to the development of an emerging democracy. This does not mean that the new media order should be of a restrictive nature, nor is it a call for the media to be less vigorous in its role of keeping Government honest. The press must be free to criticise, investigate and chide the government. However, in the early years of nation building the role of the press should in some ways be more supportive rather than fiercely antagonistic, defiantly critical or adversarial. In short, the new media order should work towards reconciling the need for openness and the right to speak one 2 ̆ 7 s mind with the necessity for healing the wounds created by racism. In the words of African National Congress stalwart Albie Sachs (1990) : We must remember that the objective is to open doors that are at present closed, not to create more blockages to the free circulation of ideas and information. We would have gained little if we were to replace the present media controls with new ones that simply switch the propaganda and biases around; if one realm of banality takes over from another. Truth has always favoured the democratic cause, and our people are tired of forever being protected in the name of what others think is good for them. 1 The press in South Africa does not exist in a vacuum. Large sections of the South African print media grew fat on the machinery of apartheid. Racism was rife in many newsrooms and evidence given to both the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the Racism in the Media inquiry amply illustrates this. At the very least there is now a moral obligation on the part of the media to participate constructively in the transformation just as there is an obligation on all sectors of South African industries and trades to adopt Black Economic Empowerment objectives...|$|E

These principles are the authoritative guidelines for directing the work of national human rights institutions. Designed as agencies for both the promotion and protection of human rights, these entities occupy an important intermediate position between the state and civil society. They are to serve as <b>public</b> <b>watchdogs</b> over the state and to be accessible to the public at large as agencies investigating complaints about state wrongdoing and as sources of education and training for raising human rights awareness. The report makes an assessment of the legal mandate, composition, independence, operational priorities and to the extent possible, the effectiveness and impact of the three commissions in Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines. Although the assessment finds that the three fulfil the requirements of the Paris Principles, there is still considerable room for improvement for all three. All three commissions are also found to vary in significant respects and this variation is sought summarised in a concluding table. Finally, some recommendations are made as to how the performance of the commissions can be bettered. The general weakness of the commissions is that their mandates are not as encompassing as they should be and that they have few powers to make sure that their recommendations are followed once they are submitted to the relevant government authority.

This Article focuses on the law’s deeply conflicted treatment of auditors of public corporations. Though the audit firm is charged with serving as the <b>public’s</b> <b>watchdog</b> in insuring good financial disclosure, the auditor’s actual client is the audited corporation itself, whose interests concerning disclosure are not necessarily aligned with those of investors. Because the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 left this structure in place, further reform is needed. One promising suggestion is to give public corporations the option of buying Financial Statement Insurance (FSI) to insure against liability to investors harmed by misrepresentations in financial information disclosed to the public. Instead of working for the audited corporation, under FSI, auditors work for the insurer, whose financial interest in a candid audit is in line with the investing public’s need for good information. Who Pays The Auditor Calls The Tune? contributes to the FSI literature by making the case for reform and suggesting modifications in current FSI proposals. It reviews the development of the auditor’s role through history, the changing incentives of auditors and clients and the characteristics of other successful disclosure-based regulatory regimes compared to FSI and rival suggestions. It concludes that FSI is viable not just as a supplement to current auditor regulation, but as a substitute, with corporations required to have at least a minimum level of FSI coverage...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} a consecutive 91 -day reporting period in The New York Times as it peaked {{leading up to}} the invasion of Iraq in March 2003. It analyzes the newspaper???s role through the type and scope of information it offered the public about the administration???s arguments for war. A content and quantification analysis method using 1, 038 articles is illustrated in charts, graphs and tables to determine whether the reporting (a) balanced American government or military voices on the subject of weapons of mass destruction, and Iraqi affected groups; (b) fairly represented military achievements or movements with possible massive damage to [...] institutions of law and order, infrastructure, public health, the environment and to civil order, resulting from expected massive high ordnance bombing; (c) represented the voices of Iraqis or other Arab/Islamic/antiwar groups in the conflict. The study reaches back to the Civil War for historical context to show, with examples, the media-government relation pattern set then and followed in each U. S. intervention, except Vietnam, up to the latest in Iraq when the Internet disrupted it as The Times readers could compare their information to that from other sources. Results from this study, as reflected in the data extracted from this research, may be useful for (a) understanding the type of pressures administration and military officials can bring to bear upon the media in times of war and how news stories about a country designated as an ???enemy??? are reported; (b) journalism educators to demonstrate to reporters and editors the pitfalls they should avoid, and to be aware of incidents when the interests of the U. S. military and politicians override those of the US media; and to seek out ways to resist them, and be independent of government; (c) helping readers understand how newspapers see their role as the <b>public???s</b> <b>watchdog,</b> and how they interpret their task during periods of national crisis...|$|R

40|$|What makes {{regulation}} rational? And why is rationality {{important to}} an international tribunal? In the World Trade Organization (WTO) context, these questions have had significant implications for the public policy of its Member countries. The WTO Appellate Body’s emerging emphasis on means–ends rationality testing {{is based on the}} questionable premise that consistent regulation is non-discriminatory. It has led regulators, such as the EU, to defend—and probably even construct—complex regulation in a way that emphasizes conformity to one overarching policy objective. More surprisingly, the Appellate Body has re-cast itself as <b>public</b> policy <b>watchdog,</b> pointing out when governments {{do not appear to be}} committed to their cause. In response, governments have strengthened disputed regulation, rather than making it less trade-restrictive. This retreat to rationality can be seen as a result of a difficult challenge facing the Appellate Body: how to review national regulation without passing judgment on it. More specifically, the rationality test pays the price of the Appellate Body’s retreat from proportionality...|$|R
50|$|Defendants making Marsden Motions {{are often}} advised by advocates {{to create a}} clear paper trail. This is because the court often gives more {{credibility}} to attorneys than to criminal defendants, and a successful Marsden Motion may trigger a state Bar investigation if granted based on ineffective assistance. Aram Byer James, a former <b>public</b> defender and <b>watchdog</b> of abuses by the public defender, who teaches defendants and their families how to file a Marsden Motion, emphasises creation of a paper trail as essential {{to the success of}} the motion prior to trial, or to basing an appeal on the denial of the motion.|$|R
