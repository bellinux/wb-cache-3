5|$|Gerd Heidemann {{was born}} in Hamburg in 1931. During the rise of Hitler his parents {{remained}} apolitical, but Heidemann, like many other young boys, joined the Hitler Youth. After the war he trained as an electrician, and pursued an interest in photography. He began working in a <b>photographic</b> <b>laboratory</b> and became a freelance photographer for the Deutsche Presse-Agentur and Keystone news agencies, {{as well as some}} local Hamburg papers. He had his first work published in Stern in 1951 and four years later joined the paper as a full-time member of staff. From 1961 he covered wars and hostilities across Africa and the Middle East; he became obsessed with these conflicts and other stories on which he worked, such as the search for identity of the German writer B. Traven. Although he was an excellent researcher—his colleagues called him , the Bloodhound—he would not know when to stop investigating, which led to other writers having to finish off the stories from large quantities of notes.|$|E

Constructed under MARADs supervision, she was completed on 20 April 1966, at 303 feet (92 meters) in length the largest vessel constructed for research purposes to date. Her stark white paint, large radome aft of the funnels, and heavy crane on the aft deck gave her a distinctive appearance. She had chemistry, wet and dry oceanographic, meteorological, gravimetric, and <b>photographic</b> <b>laboratories.</b> She also had several precision oceanographic winches.|$|R
2500|$|The {{unit was}} {{established}} in late 1943 as the 497th Bombardment Group at El Paso Army Air Base, Texas, a Boeing B-29 Superfortress very heavy bombardment group. The unit's original operational [...] squadrons were the 869th, 870th, 871st, and 872d Bombardment Squadrons.

2500|$|The Rockefeller Commission {{reported}} in 1975 that they investigated {{the allegation that}} Hunt and Sturgis, {{on behalf of the}} CIA, participated in the assassination of Kennedy. The final report of that commission stated that witnesses who testified that the [...] "derelicts" [...] bore a resemblance to Hunt or Sturgis [...] "were not shown to have any qualifications in photo identification beyond that possessed by an average layman". Their report also stated that FBI Agent Lyndal L. Shaneyfelt, [...] "a nationally-recognized expert in photoidentification and photoanalysis" [...] with the FBI <b>photographic</b> <b>laboratory,</b> had concluded from photo comparison that none of the men was Hunt or Sturgis. In 1979, the United States House Select Committee on Assassinations reported that forensic anthropologists had again analyzed and compared the photographs of the [...] "tramps" [...] with those of Hunt and Sturgis, as well as with photographs of Thomas Vallee, Daniel Carswell, and Fred Lee Chrisman. According to the Committee, only Chrisman resembled any of the tramps, but determined that he was not to be in Dealey Plaza {{on the day of the}} assassination. In 1992, journalist Mary La Fontaine discovered the November 22, 1963 arrest records that the Dallas Police Department had released in 1989, which named the three men as Gus W. Abrams, Harold Doyle, and John F. Gedney. According to the arrest reports, the three men were [...] "taken off a boxcar in the railroad yards right after President Kennedy was shot", detained as [...] "investigative prisoners", described as unemployed and passing through Dallas, then released four days later.|$|E
40|$|Images on {{developed}} photographic emulsions can {{be significantly}} intensified {{by making the}} image silver radioactive and exposing a second emulsion to this radiation. Because the print, an autoradiograph, reproduces the original with significant increases in density and contrast, the method {{can be used to}} enhance underexposed emulsions and to increase the limits of photographic detection. This paper reports a new, practical chemical method for activating the silver, using thiourea labeled with sulfur- 35, a process convenient for use in <b>photographic</b> <b>laboratories.</b> Speed increases of 13 and contrast increases of 18 were achieved with Kodak Plus-X film in this initial phase...|$|R

In 1939, {{he was forced to}} flee Germany, {{followed}} closely by his twin brothers, and was interned in Mooragh Internment Camp in Ramsey on the Isle of Man for the interim of the Second World War. He ended up settling in London, where he worked in the <b>photographic</b> <b>laboratories</b> of a newspaper while also avidly pursuing his own photography at a semi-professional level. [...] Despite Joseph’s lack of confidence in his photographic skills, his family members were always keen proponents of his work and {{played a crucial role in}} gaining him belated recognition.|$|R
40|$|Photographic {{technology}} {{is based on}} light sensitivity of silver halides that, because of silver properties, are capable of forming <b>photographic</b> images. <b>Photographic</b> <b>laboratories</b> and hospital departments because of digital photographic systems less use this technology today. Nevertheless recovery of solver is still advantageous because environmental problems related to Ag ions danger to biological system. Many processes have been studied to treat silver containing photographic bath: cementation, chemical precipitation and electrowinning. In this work, after preliminary voltammetric tests, a batch electrometallurgical process has been studied. The effect on process yield and deposit quality, of silver concentration in the electrolyte, varying over the range 3 - 10 g/L, bath stirring, current density ranging from 10 to 200 A/m 2 has been investigated...|$|R
60|$|If I had {{not given}} heed to the clerk's warning, and braced myself for a shock, I should {{certainly}} have dropped the lamp. The room, windowless and bare, was fitted up as a <b>photographic</b> <b>laboratory,</b> with a tap and sink {{at the side of}} it. A shelf of bottles and measures stood at one side, and a peculiar, heavy smell, partly chemical, partly animal, filled the air. A single table and chair were in front of us, and at this, with his back turned towards us, a man was seated in the act of writing. His outline and attitude were as natural as life; but as the light fell upon him, it made my hair rise to see that the nape of his neck was black and wrinkled, and no thicker than my wrist. Dust lay upon him--thick, yellow dust--upon his hair, his shoulders, his shrivelled, lemon-coloured hands. His head had fallen forward upon his breast. His pen still rested upon a discoloured sheet of paper.|$|E

5000|$|From {{the casual}} talk, {{he went on}} to a point that one heard raised a good deal. The {{question}} of Mr. Chambers' memory. He remembered so many things and he had failed to remember a number of other things."That's always baffled me," [...] he said In a slow and measured tempo. [...] "There doesn't seem to be any consistency in the importance of what is remembered. One recalls a shadow on a wall, a gesture, something of no great importance, remembers it for years--and then forgets some extremely important fact like the address of one of the underground <b>photographic</b> <b>laboratories.</b> I suppose only a student of memory could give you the answer and then I wouldn't be particularly impressed. Memory is like a hot coal-it fades and grows bright again and fades." ...|$|R

500|$|As {{this was}} happening, Briskin {{was asked to}} return to active duty, {{this time in the}} navy, for a brief stint in the {{beginning}} of March, 1945; he was assigned to the <b>Photographic</b> Sciences <b>Laboratory,</b> where he was to evaluate the Navy's filming activity. By the end of the month, he had finished his study, and submitted his findings to Captain Gene Markey, head of the Navy's Photographic Services, after which he returned to Hollywood to continue setting up Capra-Briskin. With Capra still in the service, Briskin incorporated the new film studio, with the name Liberty Films, in late April 1945. One of the first properties they went after was the hugely successful play, Harvey. In July, they convinced William Wyler to join their fledgling company, and he became part-owner, agreeing to start work for the company {{as soon as he was}} discharged from the army, and produce one film per year for the studio. In August, Briskin negotiated a deal with RKO Studios for Liberty Pictures to film 9 movies at the RKO studio, [...] and in September Wyler announced that the company would produce 3 films a year for their deal with RKO.

50|$|Bragg's {{interest}} in physics developed, {{particularly in the}} field of electromagnetism. In 1895 he was visited by Ernest Rutherford, en route from New Zealand to Cambridge; this was the commencement of a lifelong friendship. Bragg had a keen {{interest in}} the new discovery of Wilhelm Röntgen. On 29 May 1896 at Adelaide, Bragg demonstrated before a meeting of local doctors the application of “X-rays to reveal structures that were otherwise invisible”. Samuel Barbour, senior chemist of F. H. Faulding & Co., an Adelaide pharmaceutical manufacturer, supplied the necessary apparatus {{in the form of a}} Crookes tube, a glass discharge tube. The tube had been obtained at Leeds, England, where Barbour visited the firm of Reynolds and Branson, a manufacturer of <b>photographic</b> and <b>laboratory</b> equipment. Barbour returned to Adelaide in April 1896. The tube was attached to an induction coil and a battery borrowed from Sir Charles Todd, Bragg’s father-in-law. The induction coil was utilized to produce the electric spark necessary for Bragg and Barbour to “generate short bursts of X-rays”. The audience was favorably impressed. Bragg availed himself as a test subject, in the manner of Röntgen and allowed an X-ray photograph to be taken of his hand. The image of the fingers in his hand revealed “an old injury to one of his fingers sustained when using the turnip chopping machine on his father’s farm in Cumbria”. He gave a public demonstration of Marconi's wireless in 1897.|$|R
40|$|Background: Owing to {{the limited}} soft tissue donor sites in the foot area, the use of microsurgical tissue {{transfer}} is frequently becoming mandatory in this area, especially in cases of massive defects due to the common motor vehicle accidents in the territory of Upper Egypt. Free flaps offer {{a great variety of}} available tissues to cover larger, multifocal or multistructural defects. They also improve the perfusion of the infected poorly perfused areas. Objectives: In this study, we tried to evaluate foot defects according to their size, shape and site and to determine the general and specific parameters of free tissue transfer to the foot area in concomitance with the patients needs. Materials and Methods: Eleven patients were included in this study. For each patient, complete history was taken, general and local examination, <b>photographic</b> documentation, <b>laboratory</b> investigations, imaging and other investigations were performed. Free flap transfers were applied in all cases as follows: Latissimus dorsi flap in five cases, Rectus abdominis flap in three cases, Scapular flap in one case, Gracilis flap in one case and Radial forearm flap in one case. Results: Nine flaps survived. No infection or donor site complications were recorded. Every patient had the optimum free flap as regards the defect size, site, depth, condition, shape, donor site availability and the recipient vessels&#x 2032; condition. Conclusion: The study of the optimum free flap for foot reconstruction in relation to the defect present and patient conditions is crucial to have significant results...|$|R
