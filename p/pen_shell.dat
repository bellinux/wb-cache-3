30|$|In {{recent years}} <b>pen</b> <b>shells</b> in the Ariake Sea mainly consist of A. pectinata Lineage 2 (>  90 % of specimens; Aramaki 2013; Hashimoto, {{personal}} data). Considering this, we judge that most <b>pen</b> <b>shells</b> {{collected from the}} Ariake Sea in recent studies (e.g., Yamamoto and Handa 2011; Koga and Aramaki 2013) consist of A. pectinata Lineage 2. Note that these <b>pen</b> <b>shells</b> were called “Atrina lischkeana” in some of recent studies (e.g., Yamamoto and Handa 2011).|$|R
30|$|Experimental {{specimens}} were artificially hatched in July 2014 at the Seikai National Fisheries Research Institute {{from the}} eggs of adult <b>pen</b> <b>shells</b> {{collected in the}} Ariake Sea, Japan. The orthodox species name at present for these <b>pen</b> <b>shells</b> is unclear owing to the taxonomic confusion of Atrina (Lemer et al. 2014). Yet, these <b>pen</b> <b>shells</b> all have been confirmed to be identical to “Atrina pectinata Lineage 2 ” (sensu Liu et al. 2011) by the analyses of the mtDNA COI region (Hashimoto, personal data). Therefore, we provisionally call our material “Atrina pectinata Lineage 2 ” or “Atrina pectinata”.|$|R

40|$|The {{occurrence}} {{of two new}} species of bivalves from family Pinnidae is recorded {{for the first time}} from south west coast of India. These two species are under the family Pinnidae. The Pinnidae are marine bivalves. It includes large wedgeshaped bivalves that live in mud and sand or amongst rocks or corals. These bivalves are not popularly used in India as food or other industries. But it is a popular food source with a high commercial value {{in a number of other}} Asian Pacific areas. The present study is dealt with the taxonomy and distribution of <b>pen</b> <b>shells</b> based on their morphometry and molecular data. The samples were collected from the sandy shore amongst the rocky area of Vizhinjam, the south west coast of India. Two types of <b>Pen</b> <b>shells,</b> Pinna atropurpurea and Atrinavexillum were collected from the study area. Initially <b>pen</b> <b>shells</b> are classified into two based on their morphology. The two <b>pen</b> <b>shells</b> collected were showing differences in their external characteristics. Morphologically they are identified by nine characters of the valves. DNA barcoding is a powerful tool for species detection, identification and discovery. It is a useful tool for monitoring genetic variation and global distribution of aquatic bioresource. DNA barcoding of these two species were made and the data is also included and discussed in this paper...|$|R

50|$|The anodont hinge is {{characterized}} by a strong ligament (or a series of transverse ligamental grooves as in the Isognomonidae), however, true teeth are absent in adults {{as is the case in}} the <b>pen</b> <b>shells</b> (Pinnidae), tree oysters (Isognomonidae), the pearl oysters (Pteriidae), and some freshwater mussels such as the genus Anodonta.|$|R
5000|$|A byssus [...] is {{a bundle}} of {{filaments}} secreted by many species of bivalve mollusk, that function to attach the mollusk to a solid surface. Species from several families of clams have a byssus, including the <b>pen</b> <b>shells,</b> the true mussels and the false mussels: the Pinnidae, the Mytilidae and the Dreissenidae.|$|R
5000|$|This {{subclass}} of mollusks has lamellibranch gills, and is epibenthic. Some {{attach to}} the substrate using a byssus. The foot is reduced. The mantle margins are not fused. Gills are usually large and assist in feeding. This group includes the well known mussels, scallops, <b>pen</b> <b>shells,</b> and oysters. [...] It also includes the only {{members of the class}} bivalvia to have rudimentary eyes.|$|R
50|$|Like most pen shells, A. rigida {{lives in}} soft bottoms, with the {{majority}} of the shell buried, point down, leaving only a few inches exposed, held in place by an extensive net of byssal threads. This <b>pen</b> <b>shell</b> tends to prefer shallower waters, whereas related species prefer greater depths.|$|E
50|$|The amber <b>pen</b> <b>shell</b> is benthic {{and usually}} occurs in medium to coarse sand or mixed substrata (sand, gravel, rocks), in fine {{calcareous}} sandy mud of eelgrass (e.g. Zostera spp.), in sandy substrata of turtle grass (e.g. Thalassia spp.) and other mixed-species seagrass meadows at depths usually between 2 and 15 m.|$|E

5000|$|The bivalve {{shell is}} usually 30 - 50 cm long, but can reach 120 cm. Its shape differs {{depending}} on the region it inhabits.

50|$|The Ariake Sea (Ariake-kai) {{is a body}} of {{salt water}} {{surrounded}} by Fukuoka, Saga, Nagasaki, and Kumamoto Prefectures, all of which lie {{on the island of}} Kyūshū in Japan. It is the largest bay in Kyūshū. Its deepest point is only about 50 m deep, and extreme tides exceed 4 m. It is used for aquaculture, with nori being a major product. Various species of fauna, including mudskippers, <b>pen</b> <b>shells</b> (Atrina pectinata), and fiddler crabs, live in the Ariake Sea. In autumn, there is red-grass along the sea shore.Recent years have brought increasing pollution, with resultant red tides. Isahaya Bay is a branch of the Ariake Sea.
