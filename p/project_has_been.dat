5|$|The Glen Yards <b>project</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{controversial}} due {{to local}} {{opposition to the}} project, environmental issues, {{and the cost of}} the project itself.

5|$|The {{drilling}} <b>project</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{opposed by}} some environmental groups and scientists who {{have argued that}} hot-water drilling would have a more limited environmental impact.
