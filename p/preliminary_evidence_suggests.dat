5|$|This mamba preys {{primarily}} on adult birds, eggs and rodents. This species {{has also been}} documented to prey on bats. It is also believed that this species eats arboreal lizards as well, but {{this has not been}} documented. The <b>preliminary</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>suggests</b> that this species displays a sit-and-wait strategy of foraging. However, this evidence does not preclude active foraging by this species. One witness observed a specimen systematically hunt sleeping bats (J. Ashe, pers. comm. 1991). They have also been known to raid the nests of young birds. Sit-and-wait tactics may be successful with highly mobile prey, such as adult birds or rodents. Documented prey include the sombre greenbul, which occur in dense portions of natural and cultivated vegetation along Kenya's coastline. Ionides and Pitman (1965) reported a large Bushveld gerbil in the stomach of a green mamba in Tanzania. Although the Bushveld gerbil does not occur in Kenya, green mambas will prey on any of the seven species of gerbil that inhabit various portions of its range.|$|E

Much of the literature, however, suggests a curvilinear or even quadratic relationship between spatial performance and circulating testosterone, where both hypo- and hypersecretion (deficient- and excessive-secretion) of circulating androgens have negative effects on cognition.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} studies have {{suggested}} that subtle behavioral or personality changes may occur in infected humans, and infection with the parasite has recently been associated with a number of neurological disorders, particularly schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. A 2015 study also found cognitive deficits in adults to be associated with joint infection by both T. gondii and Helicobacter pylori in a regression model with controls for race-ethnicity and educational attainment. Although a causal relationship between latent toxoplasmosis with these neurological phenomena has not yet been established, <b>preliminary</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>suggests</b> that T. gondii infection can induce some of the same alterations in the human brain as those observed in mice.|$|E

25|$|<b>Preliminary</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>suggests</b> {{that the}} {{dopamine}} transporter couples to L-type voltage-gated calcium channels (particularly Cav1.2 and Cav1.3), which {{are expressed in}} virtually all dopamine neurons. As a result of DAT–Cav coupling, DAT substrates that produce depolarizing currents through the transporter are able to open calcium channels that are coupled to the transporter, resulting in a calcium influx in dopamine neurons. This calcium influx is believed to induce CAMKII-mediated phosphorylation of the dopamine transporter as a downstream effect; since DAT phosphorylation by CAMKII results in dopamine efflux in vivo, activation of transporter-coupled calcium channels is a potential mechanism by which certain drugs (e.g., amphetamine) trigger neurotransmitter release.|$|E
25|$|Many {{people with}} anxiety {{disorders}} benefit from joining a self-help or support group (telephone conference-call support groups or online support groups being of particular help for completely housebound individuals). Sharing problems and achievements with others, {{as well as}} sharing various self-help tools, are common activities in these groups. In particular, stress management techniques and various kinds of meditation practices and visualization techniques can help people with anxiety disorders calm themselves and may enhance the effects of therapy, as can service to others, which can distract from the self-absorption that tends to go with anxiety problems. Also, <b>preliminary</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>suggests</b> aerobic exercise may have a calming effect. Since caffeine, certain illicit drugs, and even some over-the-counter cold medications can aggravate the symptoms of anxiety disorders, they should be avoided.|$|E

40|$|Abstract We {{analyzed}} {{intracranial pressure}} (ICP) signals {{during periods of}} acute intracranial hypertension (ICH) using the Lempel–Ziv (LZ) complexity measure. Our results indicate the LZ complexity of ICP decreases during periods of ICH. The mean LZ complexity before ICH was 0. 20 ± 0. 04, while the mean LZ complexity during ICH was 0. 16 ± 0. 03 (p < 0. 05). The mean decrease of the LZ complexity values during the ICH episodes was 19. 5 %. Additionally, we present <b>preliminary</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>suggesting</b> that periods of ICH may be detectable from non-invasive signals coupled with ICP, such as pulse oximetry (SpO 2) ...|$|R
