5000|$|The gun {{was placed}} on a wooden platform, {{consisting}} of three layers of beams (deals) each measuring 7,5 cm by 7,5 cm by 4,5 m. The size of the platform was 4,5 m by 4,5 m by 22,5 cm. The layers were placed {{at right angles to}} one another. The platform weighed 5,200 kg. The platform had to be placed level in all directions to ensure that the range did not change when the gun pointed in a different direction.Near the [...] "front" [...] of the platform a <b>pivot</b> <b>plate</b> was securely attached to the platform. Recoil was controlled by a hydraulic cylinder which connected the trail to the <b>pivot</b> <b>plate.</b> Chocks were also placed behind the wheels to limit recoil.|$|E
40|$|A {{plurality}} of identical modules are serially connected together with each module including {{a base plate}} and a top plate interconnected by a ball joint assembly so that the top plate is adapted to pivotally nutate around the base plate to describe a cone in space. An array of twenty-four electromagnets, sequentially energized in sets of three, are arranged in a ring around {{the periphery of the}} base plate. Selective energization of the eight sets of electromagnets causes the rim of the top plate to be magnetically attracted to the energized electromagnets. The tilt of the top <b>pivot</b> <b>plate</b> is detected and controlled over a range of 360 degrees, thus permitting a series string of modules to assume any desired elongated configuration...|$|E
40|$|Crop yield map is {{a useful}} means to {{quantify}} yield variations within the fields {{and to provide a}} scientific basis for implementing site-specific crop management strategies. This research explores the feasibility of developing a new silage yield monitoring system by employing a new mass flow sensor based on using the momentum of chopped material impacting a <b>pivoted</b> <b>plate</b> loaded by a retractable spring installed {{at the end of a}} chopper discharge spout. A precise rotary potentiometer was used to measure the degree of <b>pivoted</b> <b>plate</b> rotation. To save and process the output voltage of the potentiometer, a programmable circuit comprising of AVR microcontroller ATMEGA series and MAX 232 microchip was used and the output data was sent to a portable computer for further processing. To calibrate the output signal of the sensor versus instantaneous chopped material flow rate, the chopper was fed artificially with predetermined mass flow rates of 6, 8 and 10 kg s- 1 of silage corn at five replications for each feeding rate. The results of statistical analysis showed high correlation between degrees of the pivoted-plate rotation and instantaneous feed rates with adjusted R 2 of 0. 98. To evaluate the accuracy of mass flow rate estimation, a platform scale weighing system was used during the field tests. The statistical analysis did not show any significant difference between sensor mass flow rate estimation and platform scale weighing system output. By using the resulted calibration equation, yield map of a silage cornfield was generated...|$|R

50|$|A {{centreboard}} or centerboard (US) is a retractable keel which pivots {{out of a}} slot in {{the hull}} of a sailboat, known as a centreboard trunk (UK) or centerboard case (US). The retractability allows the centreboard to be raised to operate in shallow waters, to move the centre of lateral resistance (offsetting changes to the sailplan that move the centre of effort aft), to reduce drag when the full area of the centreboard is not needed, or when removing the boat from the water, as when trailering. A centreboard which consists of just a <b>pivoting</b> metal <b>plate</b> is called a centerplate. A daggerboard is similar but slides vertically rather than pivoting.|$|R
40|$|Since its {{inception}} {{scanning tunneling microscopy}} (STM) {{has emerged as a}} powerful technique in the field of nanoscience, with applications that have provided extremely important insights into the local nano-scale chemical/electrical properties of semiconducting and conducting materials. However, this technique alone is not capable of directly observing the tip and sample during its operation. Direct observation of the dynamic changes of both the tip and sample may help to provide {{a better understanding of the}} mechanisms behind some STM applications. Recent developments in this area have successfully combined STM to operate in-situ with imaging techniques such as Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). 	This thesis presents a new design for an in-situ STM which can operate within the spatial confines of a TEM – allowing both techniques to be conducted simultaneously. To overcome the spatial constraints of imaging inside a TEM, the design uses a novel coarse approach mechanism; consisting of three parallel hammer-action inertial driving mechanisms that are attached via flexible linkages to a <b>pivot</b> <b>plate</b> that allows the STM tip to be reliably positioned to regions of interest in three dimensions. The operation of STM in a TEM provides numerous advantages that are not available with standard STM techniques; these advantages are discussed and potential applications for this technique are also presented. One such application investigated is the potential for using silver sulphide STM tips for use in in-situ STM manipulation...|$|E

50|$|In 1915 Galerkin {{published}} an article in which he put forward an idea of an approximate method for differential equations, in particular boundary value problems. He had applied his method to a big number of <b>pivot</b> and <b>plate</b> analysis problems. Some time before I.G.Bubnov developed a similar approach for the variational problem solution, which he interpreted as a variant of Ritz method algorithm. The distinguishing features of Galerkin's method were the following: he did not associate the method, developed by him, with any variational problem direct solution, but considered it to be common for solving differential equations. He interpreted it, using the probable displacements principle. These ideas showed to be very productive, not only in structural mechanics, but for mathematical physics at large.|$|R
50|$|In this scale, two {{identical}} horizontal beams are attached, one {{directly above}} the other, to a vertical column, which {{is attached to}} a stable base. On each side, both horizontal beams are attached to a vertical beam. The six attachment points are <b>pivots.</b> Two horizontal <b>plates,</b> suitable for placing objects to be weighed, are fixed {{to the top of the}} two vertical beams. An arrow on the lower horizontal beam (and perpendicular to it) and a mark on the vertical column may be added to aid in leveling the scale.|$|R
40|$|During {{the last}} years the {{increasing}} number of fatal coach accidents with tragic consequences for passengers showed the importance of passive safety in addition to the driver’s competence and active safety. In the European countries the certification of sufficient deformation strength when overturning is compulsory for the approval of a coach according to the ECE R 66 regulation. The certification is granted after positive results from crash tests or computer simulations with partial or full bus structure. The ECE R 66 regulation defines a survival space for the passengers which must remain intact after the accident. The tests specify either the overturning of the vehicle structure from a tilting platform or the impact of a plate on the coach structure as it would correspond to the crash of the structure when falling onto the ground. Since such tests with real vehicle structures are costly and computer efficiency, on the other hand, is becoming increasingly better and cheaper, crash simulations will play a more important role for the approval in the future. This paper will present different LS-DYNA – time simulations of the overturning test with a segment of a bus structure according to ECE R 66 and time simulations with a <b>pivoted</b> <b>plate</b> hitting with the same kinetic energy against the structure as the model falling from the tilting platform and crashing onto the floor. Several modelling configurations with deformable and rigid undercarriage, with different friction coefficients of the contact ground-structure, are simulated. These calculations shall serve as a preparation for future calculations to obtain the necessary certification. Unfortunately no experimental results are available at present to enable the comparison between hardware test and computer simulation. However, the experience gained with tilting tests of similar coach structures in the past indicates the trustworthiness of the calculations. As these experiences are published on the panel of a users’ meeting, this paper goes more then usual into detail regarding the modelling and the difficulties in simulations which the authors, until that time unfamiliar with LS-DYNA, has to overcome. A short introduction to the variable test possibilities explained in regulation ECE R 66 is given...|$|R
5000|$|Each valve was a wood disc {{with leather}} facing on both sides. One face had a center hole {{leading to a}} pocket of a larger {{diameter}} in the wood. The valve was supported only by a lever between the valve <b>plate</b> <b>pivot</b> and the pouch lifter disc, with a right angle dowel extension that [...] "plugged in" [...] the center hole of the valve button. The pivotal lever is easily removable {{because it was not}} cemented to the valve, rendering a loose valve button in the valve well behind the valve plate that was screwed onto the valve chest with white sealing compound.|$|R
50|$|The {{parking pawl}} locks the {{transmission}}'s output shaft to the transmission casing by engaging a pawl (a pin) that engages in a notched wheel on the shaft, stopping it (and thus the driven wheels) from rotating. The main {{components of a}} parking pawl mechanism are the parking gear, parking pawl, actuator rod, cam collar, cam <b>plate,</b> <b>pivot</b> pin and parking pawl return spring. The mechanism assembly is designed so that the parking pawl tooth collides and overrides the parking gear teeth (ratchets) until a safe engagement speed for the vehicle is reached. Software controls are {{put in place to}} avoid this condition and engage the pawl only when the vehicle has come to a stand still.|$|R
50|$|The {{development}} {{in the beginning of}} the 20th century resulted in the need for a larger factory, as the company located at the center of the historic city became too small. A spacious factory for constructing hydraulic fruit, wine and oil presses was built. After the Second World War the Dieffenbacher group specialized in heavy equipment construction and could gain ground in the timber industry in 1954. The first chipboard and inlay presses were built. Furthermore, plywood facilities and pattern facilities to refine chipboards were adopted in the product range. In the mid-60’s Dieffenbacher developed a spotting press with <b>pivoting</b> slide <b>plates</b> and extendable desk. This type of press is the precursor of today’s tryout press. From 1960’s onwards Dieffenbacher built presses for fiber-reinforced polyester plastic processing and became the market leader of this branch in the 1970s. With the entry of Wolf-Gerd Dieffenbacher as managing director in 1980 the development to a complete system manufacturer and the internationalization of the company with numerous start-ups, acquisitions and worldwide expansion of sales offices and service-centers. The Dieffenbacher group is represented in 22 locations worldwide today.|$|R
50|$|In use, {{this type}} of secure fixing enables rod {{rotation}} in both directions which is often necessary to clear blockages. Tree roots in particular often need 'winding up' before extraction and disposal. In addition the drain rod set usually has one or two unblocking tools. One may be a <b>pivoting</b> flat metal <b>plate</b> of almost half the drain diameter. It is hinged across the widest point. This tool can be rotated to ride over poor mortar joints or dragged over the joint to scrape any protuberance. An auger can be screwed onto one end, {{it may be a}} single helical coarse thread or even double helix. The latter being ideal to capture thin young tree roots. Various rubber 'washers' and bristle cleaning assemblies can be purchased too.|$|R
40|$|An {{automatic}} {{thermal switch}} to control heat flow includes a first thermally conductive plate, a second thermally conductive plate and a thermal transfer plate pivotally mounted {{between the first}} and second plates. A phase change power unit, including a plunger connected to the transfer plate, is in thermal contact with the first thermally conductive plate. A biasing element, connected to the transfer plate, biases the transfer plate in a predetermined position with respect to the first and second plates. When the phase change power unit is actuated by an increase in heat transmitted through the first plate, the plunger extends and <b>pivots</b> the transfer <b>plate</b> to vary the thermal conduction {{between the first and}} second plates through the transfer plate. The biasing element, transfer plate and piston can be arranged to provide either a normally closed or normally open thermally conductive path {{between the first and second}} plates...|$|R
40|$|In water {{hydraulic}} systems, {{requirements for}} better energy efficiency {{call for the}} development of variable displacement axial piston pumps. Most axial piston units utilizing water as pressure medium lack the possibility of adjusting the swash plate tilt angle because of difficulties in constructing robust water compatible swash <b>plate</b> <b>pivot</b> bearings. Without smooth enough adjustment motion, the lubrication conditions between the swash plate and the piston slipper pads become disturbed and loss of fluid film may lead to early pump failure. This study reports on measurements made with a test rig built for investigating tribological phenomena in variable displacement axial piston pumps. In the tests, the effects of changing the swash plate tilt angle were measured in a test setup with constant high pressure which loaded the piston. Lubricating film thickness and lateral force acting on the piston were measured together with changes in these quantities in response to changes in swash plate tilt angle...|$|R
40|$|A {{horizontal}} component seismograph of inverted pendulum type was newly designed. The main objects {{of this new}} design were ease of manipulation and great accuracy. To attain this object, all the jewels, {{by means of a}} flat spring, were made to press lightly against the pivots. This design was very effective in eliminating backlashes between the pivot and the jewels. As shown in Fig. 2, the helical spring and needle system that is so frequently used in connecting the magnifying levers was replaced in the new seismograph by a connecting rod, having <b>pivots</b> and <b>plate</b> springs at both ends. The air damper, which consists of a pendulum bob, which acts as the piston, and two cylinders covaring the both side of the bob, have a large functioing area, there beipg wide clearance between the piston and cylinder, making it easy to set up the instrument, and doing away with the contact of cylinder with the piston which is so liable to occur with rough manipulation, and bad observation conditions. The effective mass and the effective moment of inertia of the pendulum are 12 ・ 7 kg and 1 ・ 18 × 104 kg cm 2 respectively. The geometrical magnification of the seismograph, that is, the magnification for an infinitely quick motion of the ground, is 47 ・ 5 and the period of free oscillation is 8 ・ 0 sec. The record is made on a sheet of smoked paper wound on a drum, 60 cm in circumference revolving once in 5 minutes. The drum is driven by a 6 watt Warren synchronous motor...|$|R
5000|$|The first attested use of {{the term}} [...] "safety razor" [...] is in a patent {{application}} for [...] "new and useful improvements in Safety-Razors", filed in May 1880 by Fredrik and Otto Kampfe of Brooklyn, New York, and issued the following month.

[...] The Kampfe Brothers produced razors under their own name following the 1880 patent and improved the design in a series of subsequent patents. These models were manufactured under the [...] "Star Safety Razor" [...] brand.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{detection}} of sound by the cochlea involves a complex mechanical interplay among {{components of the}} cochlear partition. An in vitro preparation of the second turn of the jird’s cochlea provides an opportunity to measure cochlear responses with subcellular resolution under controlled mechanical, ionic, and electrical conditions that simulate those encountered in vivo. Using photodiode micrometry, laser interferometry, and stroboscopic video microscopy, we have assessed the mechanical responses of the cochlear partition to acoustic and electrical stimuli near the preparation’s characteristic frequency. Upon acoustic stimulation, the partition responds principally as a rigid <b>plate</b> <b>pivoting</b> around its insertion along the spiral lamina. The radial motion at the reticular lamina greatly surpasses that of the tectorial membrane, giving rise to shear that deflects the mechanosensitive hair bundles. Electrically evoked mechanical responses are qualitatively dissimilar from their acoustically evoked counterparts and suggest the recruitment of both hair-bundle- and soma-based electromechanical transduction processes. Finally, we observe {{significant changes in the}} stiffness of the cochlear partition upon tip-link destruction and tectorial-membrane removal, suggesting that these structures contribute considerably to the system’s mechanical impedance and that hair-bundle-based forces can drive active motion of the cochlear partition...|$|R
40|$|Abstract We {{investigate}} {{the dynamics of}} an object towed {{over the surface of}} an initially flat, deformable layer. Using a combination of simple laboratory experiments and a theoretical model, we demonstrate that an inclined <b>plate,</b> <b>pivoted</b> so as to move up and down, may be towed steadily over a substrate at low speed, but become unstable to vertical oscillations above a threshold speed. That threshold depends upon the weight of the plate and the physical properties of the substrate, but arises whether the substrate is a viscous fluid, a viscoplastic fluid, or a granular medium. For the latter two materials, the unstable oscillations imprint a permanent rippled pattern on the layer, suggesting that the phenomenon of the 'washboard road' can arise from the passage of a single vehicle (i. e. the absolute instability of a flat bed). We argue that the mechanism behind the instability originates from the mound of material that is pushed forward ahead of the object: the extent of the mound determines the resultant force, whereas its growth is controlled by the object's height relative to the undisturbed surface, allowing for an unstable coupling between the vertical motion and the substrate deformation. © 2012 Cambridge University Press...|$|R
