Among those using the Internet, 39 percent had protected their online accounts, for example by changing passwords or canceling accounts; 29 percent believed their <b>personal</b> <b>information</b> was put at risk because of the Heartbleed bug; and 6 percent believed their <b>personal</b> <b>information</b> had been stolen.|$|E
5|$|Remittances from Abroad: As {{identity}} theft happens {{in many different}} ways: a thief obtains credit card receipts or bank statements from your wallet or trash; <b>personal</b> <b>information</b> is inadvertently provided over the phone or Internet; or other confidential information. Before a person even realizes their <b>personal</b> <b>information</b> has been compromised, their credit and goods is claimed by fraudulent persons. The use of the Lebanese Identity Card and PIN in claiming goods and monies sent from abroad {{has been designed to}} prevent unauthorized persons from claiming what is due to the Lebanese Identity Card holder.|$|E

5|$|On 16 August 2007, Odex {{initiated}} {{legal action}} against a third Internet Service Provider, Pacific Internet. Odex sought to have Pacific Internet disclose the <b>personal</b> <b>information</b> of about 1,000 subscribers. The closed-door hearing was held on 23 August 2007 in the Subordinate Courts, where District Judge Earnest Lau ruled that Pacific Internet {{did not have to}} reveal its subscribers' <b>personal</b> <b>information.</b> Lau believed that Odex was not the correct party to make the application, despite having permission to prosecute on behalf of the Japanese anime studios. The decision came as a surprise to many, and Odex quickly announced its intent to appeal. Although Lau denied Odex the court order, he warned that the right to privacy was no defence for copyright infringement.|$|E

In addition, the recall drives brought in support from national groups {{on both sides}} of the issue. The National Rifle Association (NRA) supported the recall effort with mailers and donations.

5|$|In 2006, The Royal Bank of Scotland Group {{undertook}} {{the first}} trial of PayPass contactless debit and credit cards in Europe. The bank is introducing Visa Debit cards with the technology for current accounts, {{which can be used}} to pay for purchases up to £30 by tapping an enabled card on the retailer's terminal. In an effort to enhance security, hand-held devices for use with a card to authorise online banking transactions were introduced in 2007.

5|$|One {{security}} conscious commenter on the Engadget {{consumer electronics}} blog addressed the privacy {{implications of the}} oversize bills given the limitations of personal paper shredders, by speculating on {{whether it would be}} more practical to dispose of these large bills by burning them to protect <b>personal</b> <b>information.</b> An editor for the libertarian monthly Reason also speculated about the usefulness of the detailed information to government investigators. The original Ars Technica blog posting, on the other hand, dismissed privacy concerns, showing that the detail pages do not contain sensitive information.|$|E
5|$|Passport Acquisition: Any time a Lebanese Identity Card holder applies for a passport, their Personal Identification Number (PIN) is {{captured}} on the passport and their <b>personal</b> <b>information</b> cross-checked {{with the existing}} data in the National Identification System. A Lebanese Identity Card holder {{may not be able}} to acquire a passport if they do not possess a Lebanese Identity Card. This is because only people who qualify to hold Lebanese Passports will be issued with one since the individual’s nationality can be properly checked from the National Identification System.|$|E
5|$|Pension Claims: As {{identity}} theft occurs when someone uses a persons <b>personal</b> <b>information,</b> such as Social Security number without their permission to commit fraud by claiming their benefits {{or that of}} a relation. The Lebanese Identity Card identifies a Lebanese Identity Card holder as the rightful and only person authorized to receive their pension benefits. In the event of the Lebanese Identity Card holder's death, only their children or spouse will benefit from their pension claim.|$|E

5|$|Related to privacy, the ACLU {{engaged in}} several battles {{to ensure that}} {{government}} records about individuals were kept private, and to give individuals the right to review their records. The ACLU supported several measures, including the 1970 Fair Credit Reporting Act required credit agencies to divulge credit information to individuals; the 1973 Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, which provided students the right to access their records; and the 1974 Privacy Act which prevented the federal government from disclosing <b>personal</b> <b>information</b> without good cause.|$|E

However, despite these security measures, counterfeit tickets were still produced, forcing UEFA to issue a statement warning people against buying tickets from touts.|$|E
30|$|In {{previous}} research, {{the importance}} of <b>personal</b> external <b>information</b> sources has been acknowledged as influential because such information is presumably credible and unbiased—the type of information to which consumers are receptive (Cafferky 2004; Myers and Hufton 2008). Surprisingly, the current study found {{no significant differences in}} frequency of use of <b>personal</b> external <b>information</b> sources based on the variables examined (fashion leadership and SOP). It appears that virtually all these participants made use of other people’s opinions when searching for information about products. Future research might examine other environmental (e.g., culture) or individual influences (e.g., age) on use of <b>personal</b> external <b>information</b> sources.|$|R
