Timothy played both soccer and ice hockey, while Kate was a ballerina with the State Ballet of Missouri {{by the age}} of ten. During this time, Farrar worked long hours and Green accompanied the children to their activities, though perception of her by other parents at the activities varied—some felt she was a supportive mother, while others believed she drove her children too hard and <b>put</b> <b>down</b> <b>their</b> efforts too often.|$|E
5|$|Eclipses {{have been}} {{interpreted}} as omens, or portents. The ancient Greek historian Herodotus wrote that Thales of Miletus predicted an eclipse {{that occurred during}} a battle between the Medes and the Lydians. Both sides <b>put</b> <b>down</b> <b>their</b> weapons and declared peace {{as a result of}} the eclipse. The exact eclipse involved remains uncertain, although the issue has been studied by hundreds of ancient and modern authorities. One likely candidate took place on May 28, 585 BC, probably near the Halys river in Asia Minor. An eclipse recorded by Herodotus before Xerxes departed for his expedition against Greece, which is traditionally dated to 480 BC, was matched by John Russell Hind to an annular eclipse of the Sun at Sardis on February 17, 478 BC. Alternatively, a partial eclipse was visible from Persia on October 2, 480 BC. Herodotus also reports a solar eclipse at Sparta during the Second Persian invasion of Greece. The date of the eclipse (August 1, 477 BC) does not match exactly the conventional dates for the invasion accepted by historians.|$|E
5|$|Eric Sundwall, Chair of the New York Libertarian Party, was the Libertarian {{candidate}} for the seat. However, he {{was removed from the}} ballot on March 25, after 3,786 of the 6,730 signatures his campaign had collected were ruled invalid. Under state election law, independent congressional candidates must collect at least 3,500 valid signatures to be on the ballot. Two Saratoga County residents challenged over 6,000 of Sundwall's signatures; Sundwall blamed Tedisco for the effort to have him removed from the ballot. The vast majority of the rejected signatures were from voters who <b>put</b> <b>down</b> <b>their</b> mailing address instead of the municipality in which they physically lived. Votes for Sundwall on absentee ballots, which were mailed out before he was removed from the ballot, were voided. On March 27, Sundwall announced that he would vote for Murphy in the election and urged his supporters to join him.|$|E

During the morning three guns (caliber unknown) from the Royal Artillery C. Troop arrived on the island. The Royal Artillery positioned the battery within point blank range of the Hindustan on the dockside. An ultimatum was delivered to the mutineers aboard Hindustan, stating that if they did not the leave the ship and <b>put</b> <b>down</b> <b>their</b> weapons by 10:30 they would have to face the consequences.

25|$|From the Renaissance on, some {{individuals}} wanted {{not only to}} record events, as in medieval chronicles and itineraries, but also to <b>put</b> <b>down</b> <b>their</b> own opinions and express their hopes and fears, without any intention to publish these notes. One of the early preserved examples is the anonymous Journal d'un bourgeois de Paris that covers the years 1405–49, giving subjective commentaries on the current events. Famous 14th- to 16th-century Renaissance examples, which appeared much later as books, were the diaries by the Florentines Buonaccorso Pitti and Gregorio Dati and the Venetian Marino Sanuto the Younger. Here we find records of even less important everyday occurrences together with much reflection, emotional experience and personal impressions.|$|E
25|$|As the {{violence}} escalated, the Mayor of Nogales, Sonora, Felix B. Peñaloza, sought {{to stop the}} shooting. The 53-year-old presidente municipal took a white handkerchief, tied it to his cane {{and ran into the}} streets of his city hoping to quell {{the violence}}. As US troops advanced into the streets of Nogales, Sonora, from their positions across the line, Presidente Peñaloza pleaded with the angry nogalenses to <b>put</b> <b>down</b> <b>their</b> weapons. Despite later accounts to the contrary by US military personnel (including Lt. Col. Herman), an official note from the US Consulate in Nogales, Sonora, confirmed that a shot “from the Arizona side” felled the Mexican mayor. The mortally wounded Peñaloza was dragged into a nearby pharmacy, “where nothing could be done to save him.” He died a half-hour later.|$|E
25|$|In chapter 67, {{during a}} banquet to {{celebrate}} Lü Meng and Gan Ning's victory at Wan County (皖縣), {{just before the}} Battle of Xiaoyao Ford, Ling Tong was angry when he saw Lü Meng praising Gan Ning, so he offered to perform a sword dance and use the opportunity to avenge his father. Gan Ning sensed Ling Tong's intention so he also offered to perform with his pair of jis. Lü Meng realised that {{they were about to}} fight, so he drew his sword, carried a shield, and stood between the two men to separate them. When Sun Quan heard about the incident, he came to the banquet hall and everyone <b>put</b> <b>down</b> <b>their</b> weapons. When Sun Quan chided them for fighting, Ling Tong cried and knelt down. Sun Quan had to repeatedly urge him to stop provoking Gan Ning.|$|E
25|$|By 26 March, {{the growing}} refusal of {{soldiers}} to fire into the largely nonviolent protesting crowds {{turned into a}} full-scale tumult, and resulted in thousands of soldiers <b>putting</b> <b>down</b> <b>their</b> arms and joining the pro-democracy movement. That afternoon, Lieutenant Colonel Amadou Toumani Touré announced on the radio that he had arrested the dictatorial president, Moussa Traoré.

25|$|In the {{aftermath}} the RUF was a depleted threat, civilians {{were able to}} return from refugee camps and begin rebuilding their lives. But the peace was fragile and negotiations were ongoing. The RUF was reluctant to <b>put</b> <b>down</b> <b>their</b> arms, concerned over potential retribution {{at the hands of}} army units and civilian militias alike. There was a planned deployment of UN peacekeepers meant to ease these concerns and help with the transition to peace, but things began to unravel. International contributors began to shy away from further peacekeeping initiatives; such as an expensive and open-ended mission in a strategically unimportant country. As a result, the UN's intervention force was slow to come to fruition and then came to a halt completely when Sankoh argued the size of the contingent of 740 UN peacekeepers was too large.|$|E
25|$|Prevention of {{political}} abuse {{can be achieved}} through the reformation of institutions associated with the government. Training and monitoring the security forces (e.g. army or police) help to make them an unbiased protector of the people rather than a weapon of suppression for the ruling government. Hopefully this training can bring trust by the people for the security establishment. UN forces can also run and monitor elections {{in order to ensure}} a fair process. In other cases, the UN may provide a neutral interim government to administer the country during a transitional period wherein the associated government institutions are being retrained, reformed or better developed. Lastly, military groups such as armed rebels can be encouraged to <b>put</b> <b>down</b> <b>their</b> weapons and transformed into political organisations using appropriate non-violent means to mete out their grievances and compete in the election cycle. This is especially important as many of these groups serve as the chief opposition to a given government, but lack the means or know-how to operate effectively as political organisations.|$|E
25|$|Zhong Hui {{had long}} harboured the {{intention}} of rebelling against Wei. When he saw that Deng Ai behaved in an autocratic manner even though his military command was authorised by the Wei imperial court, he secretly reported to the court that Deng was plotting a rebellion. He was skilled in imitating people's handwriting. After getting his hands on a report written by Deng Ai to the Wei imperial court, he edited the report {{to make it sound}} arrogant and demanding. At the same time, he also destroyed a letter from Sima Zhao to Deng Ai to increase Sima's suspicions towards Deng. The Wei government fell for Zhong Hui's ruse and ordered Deng Ai to be arrested and transported back to Luoyang in a prison cart. Sima Zhao was worried that Deng Ai would not submit, so he ordered Zhong Hui and Wei Guan to arrest Deng Ai. With Zhong Hui and his troops following behind, Wei Guan went to Deng Ai's camp in Chengdu and used Sima Zhao's letter of authorisation to order Deng's soldiers to <b>put</b> <b>down</b> <b>their</b> weapons. Deng Ai was arrested and placed in a prison cart.|$|E

60|$|There is {{no doubt}} that waterspouts are to a great extent, if not altogether, due to the {{presence}} of electricity in the air.

50|$|Premčević {{was born}} in the village of Ljupšte in the Poreče region, at the time part of the Ottoman Empire (now R. Macedonia). He joined the Serbian Chetnik Organization and {{organized}} the first Serbian četa (band) in Poreče in March 1904, which he then submitted to the command of vojvoda (duke) Micko Krstić. Premčević was the assistant of Micko Krstić, and after Micko was returned by the Serbian Committee to Serbia, Premčević became vojvoda of a band in charge of pursuing the Albanian kachaks. He was an active guerilla fighter until 1908, when the Young Turk Revolution saw all rebels <b>putting</b> <b>down</b> <b>their</b> weapons. He participated in the Battle of Kumanovo in the detachment of vojvoda Vojin Popović-Vuk. He died in 1937.|$|R
25|$|In the 15th century, Cilicia {{fell under}} Ottoman {{dominion}} and officially {{became known as}} the Adana Vilayet. Cilicia {{was one of the most}} important regions for the Ottoman Armenians because it managed very well to preserve Armenian character throughout the years. In fact, the Cilician highlands were densely populated by Armenian peasants in small but prosperous towns and villages such as Hadjin and Zeitun, two mountainous areas where autonomy was maintained until the 19th century. In ports and cities of the Adana plain, commerce and industry were almost entirely in the hands of the Armenians and they remained so thanks to a constant influx of Armenians from the highlands. Their population was continuously increasing in numbers in Cilicia in contrast to other parts of the Ottoman Empire, where it was, since 1878, decreasing due to repression. This is true despite the fact that in 1909, Armenians were subjected to a massacre in Adana. During the 1915 Armenian genocide, the Armenians of Zeitun had organized a successful resistance against the Ottoman onslaught. In order to finally subjugate Zeitun, the Ottomans had to resort to treachery by forcing an Armenian delegation from Marash to ask the Zeituntsi-s to <b>put</b> <b>down</b> <b>their</b> arms. Both the Armenian delegation, and later, the inhabitants of Zeitun, were left with no choice.|$|E
500|$|Black militia {{fought back}} in Charleston on September 6, 1876 {{in what was}} known as the [...] "King Street riot". The white militia assumed {{defensive}} positions out of concern over possible intervention from federal troops. Then, on September 19, the Red Shirts took offensive action by openly killing between 30 and 50 African Americans outside Ellenton. During the massacre, state representative Simon Coker was killed. On October 7, Governor Chamberlain declared martial law and told all the [...] "rifle club" [...] members to <b>put</b> <b>down</b> <b>their</b> weapons. In the meantime, Wade Hampton never ceased to remind Chamberlain that he did not rule South Carolina. Out of desperation, Chamberlain wrote to President Grant and asked for federal intervention. The [...] "Cainhoy riot" [...] took place on October 15 when Republicans held a rally at [...] "Brick Church" [...] outside Cainhoy. Blacks and whites both opened fire; six whites and one black were killed. Grant, upset over the Ellenton and Cainhoy riots, finally declared a Presidential Proclamation on October 17, 1876 and ordered all persons, within 3 days, to cease their lawless activities and disperse to their homes. A total of 1,144 federal infantrymen were sent into South Carolina, and the violence stopped; election day was quiet. Both Hampton and Chamberlain claimed victory, and for a while both acted as governor; Hampton took the office in 1877, after President Rutherford B. Hayes withdrew federal troops and after Chamberlain left the state.|$|E
