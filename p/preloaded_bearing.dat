40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} the {{variation of the}} dynamic characteristics of a spindle with the change of <b>bearing</b> <b>preload.</b> The correlations between the variation of <b>bearing</b> <b>preload</b> and fundamental modal parameters were first examined by conducting vibration tests on physical spindle units. Experimental measurements show that the dynamic compliance and damping ratio associated with the dominating modes were affected to vary with variation of the <b>bearing</b> <b>preload.</b> When the <b>bearing</b> <b>preload</b> was slightly deviated from a standard value, the modal frequency and damping ability also vary to different extent, which further enable the spindle to perform with different compliance. For the spindle used in this study, a standard preload value set on bearings would enable the spindle to behave a higher stiffness as compared with others with a preload variation. This characteristic can be served as a reference to examine the variation of <b>bearing</b> <b>preload</b> of spindle in assemblage or operation.

These mechanisms perform in a predictable and repeatable manner in benign temperature environments. Severe thermal gradients experienced in actual space applications however, cause assemblies to expand and contract around their bearings. This results in unpredictable changes in <b>bearing</b> <b>preload,</b> and hence <b>bearing</b> friction. This becomes a limitation for servos controlling pointing accuracy. Likewise, uncontrollable vibrations may couple into fixed preload (hence, fixed stiffness) mechanisms and limit pointing accuracy. Consequently, a complex problem faced today is how to design mechanisms that remain insensitive to changing thermal and vibrational spacecraft environments. Research presented involves the simplified modeling and test results of an actuator module that used piezoelectrically <b>preload</b> controlled <b>bearings.</b> The feasibility of actively controlling <b>bearing</b> <b>preload</b> was demonstrated. Because bearing friction is related to preload, a thermally active system designed with aluminum components and a 440 C bearing, was friction tested at temperatures ranging from 0 to 70 C (32 to 158 F). Effectiveness of the translators were demonstrated by mapping a controllable friction range throughout tested temperatures. It was learned that constant preload for this system could be maintained over an approximate 44 C (79 F) temperature span. From testing, it was also discovered that at the more deviate temperatures, expansions were so large that radial clearances were taken up and the duplex <b>bearing</b> became radially <b>preloaded.</b> Thus, active control of <b>bearing</b> <b>preload</b> is feasible but may be limited by inherent geometry constraints and materials used in the system...|$|R

40|$|Investigation {{into the}} dynamic {{behaviour}} of rolling element bearings {{is motivated by}} the urge to reduce vibrations in rolling bearing applications.

To investigate {{the effect of the}} lubricant on the dynamic behaviour of deep groove ball bearings, computational models have been developed for both the EHL problem and the structural dynamics problem. In the present study, the interaction between the structural elements is described by means of a non-linear spring-damper model which is based on numerical solutions of the full EHL contact problem. These relations have subsequently been adopted in the structural dynamics bearing model.

40|$|International audienceThe {{modeling}} of High Speed Machining (HSM) spindles {{is a complex}} task due to the numerous physical phenomena involved in the dynamic behavior. Modeling is still rarely used in the industry, although sophisticated research work has been achieved. The boundary conditions of rotor models, which correspond to the ball bearings, are crucial and difficult to define. Indeed, they affect the dynamic behavior of the rotor in a non-linear and sometimes in an unpredictable way. The aim of the paper is to determine a relevant spindle model, i. e. the adequate level of complexity. To do so, a dynamic bearing model is introduced and the axial model of a spindle is established {{in relation to the}} <b>preloaded</b> <b>bearing</b> arrangement. Then, the operating stiffness of the spindle has been obtained experimentally with a new specific device that applies axial load and measures the resulting displacement, whatever the spindle speed. The model updating with the experimental data combined to sensibility analysis have led to the model refinement with additional physical phenomena, in order to account for non-linearities observed experimentally. The parameters of the model are also identified experimentally. As a result, a relevant spindle model is obtained and validated by the good agreement between simulations and experiments...|$|E

These ones correspond to excitation in a resonant manner of some particular modes which store a high potential energy at the meshing stiffness.

40|$|PaperPg. 47 - 54. This paper {{describes}} how a serious field vibration problem {{on a high}} speed centrifugal compressor using tilting pad bearings was identified, following the introduction in the plant of simple methods of vibration recording and analysis, as being due to fractional frequency whirl at around 40 % of the running speed. A clear correlation was discovered between the vibration behavior and the bearing clearance. This correlation is shown to match closely the predictions of a theoretical study {{of the effect of}} bearing geometry (clearance and preload) on the stability of the particular rotor/bearing system, when a commonly used empirical criterion for stability is employed, namely that the logarithmic decrement of the system should be at least 0. 25 for instability to be avoided. The study shows that adequate stability could only be achieved in this particular system for bearings lying within a limited range of clearance and preload. Tight clearance, high <b>preload</b> <b>bearings</b> or loose clearance, negative <b>preload</b> <b>bearings</b> both give instability, and variations in bearing dimensions between nominally identical units are shown to be capable of moving the system from the stable to the unstable zone. The vibration problems have now been overcome by proper pad selection aimed at achieving an optimum <b>bearing</b> clearance and <b>preload</b> of about 7 mils and 0. 15, respectively. The marginal stability in this machine is associated {{with the fact that the}} shaft first critical speed is about 44 % of the full running speed, while machines of the same type, but with stiffer shafts giving a critical speed of about 55 % of the running speed, have been free of instability problems. To provide a long term solution to the problem, and to cater for some increase of the maximum running speed in the future, stiffer rotors are being manufactured for the machines to raise the rigid bearing first critical speed to 57 % of the current maximum running speed. In future purchase specifications for high pressure compressors a stability analysis will be requested for machines having a rigid bearing critical less than 60 % of the maximum running speed, which will be required to demonstrate a logarithmic decrement of not less than 0. 4 over the full possible range of bearing geometries, allowing for shaft, housing and pad tolerances, and wear.

40|$|The five {{appended}} papers all {{deal with}} gearbox noise and vibration. The first paper presents {{a review of}} previously published literature on gearbox noise and vibration. The second paper describes a test rig that was specially designed and built for noise testing of gears. Finite element {{analysis was used to}} predict the dynamic properties of the test rig, and experimental modal analysis of the gearbox housing was used to verify the theoretical predictions of natural frequencies. In the third paper, the influence of gear finishing method and gear deviations on gearbox noise is investigated in what is primarily an experimental study. Eleven test gear pairs were manufactured using three different finishing methods. Transmission error, which is considered to be an important excitation mechanism for gear noise, was measured as well as predicted. The test rig was used to measure gearbox noise and vibration for the different test gear pairs. The measured noise and vibration levels were compared with the predicted and measured transmission error. Most of the experimental results can be interpreted in terms of measured and predicted transmission error. However, it does not seem possible to identify one single parameter, such as measured peak-to-peak transmission error, that can be directly related to measured noise and vibration. The measurements also show that disassembly and reassembly of the gearbox with the same gear pair can change the levels of measured noise and vibration considerably. This finding indicates that other factors besides the gears affect gear noise. In the fourth paper, the influence of <b>bearing</b> endplay or <b>preload</b> on gearbox noise and vibration is investigated. Vibration measurements were carried out at torque levels of 140 Nm and 400 Nm, with 0. 15 mm and 0 mm bearing endplay, and with 0. 15 mm <b>bearing</b> <b>preload.</b> The results show that the <b>bearing</b> endplay and <b>preload</b> influence the gearbox vibrations. With <b>preloaded</b> <b>bearings,</b> the vibrations increase at speeds over 2000 rpm and decrease at speeds below 2000 rpm, compared with bearings with endplay. Finite element simulations show the same tendencies as the measurements. The fifth paper describes how gearbox noise is reduced by optimizing the gear geometry for decreased transmission error. Robustness with respect to gear deviations and varying torque is considered in order to find a gear geometry giving low noise in an appropriate torque range despite deviations from the nominal geometry due to manufacturing tolerances. Static and dynamic transmission error, noise, and housing vibrations were measured. The correlation between dynamic transmission error, housing vibrations and noise was investigated in speed sweeps from 500 to 2500 rpm at constant torque. No correlation was found between dynamic transmission error and noise.

In deep waters, drag embedment anchors are an attractive option for mooring of semisubmersible platforms due to low installation cost and high holding capacity; {{on the other}} hand, jack-up platforms are more stable than semisubmersible platforms but only can be placed in shallow waters. The analyses of anchor capacities are developed for an idealized anchor comprising a rectangular fluke, a cylindrical shank, and a metal chain connected to the shank at the padeye. The anchor trajectory prediction during drag embedment is also developed by considering anchor behavior {{in conjunction with the}} mechanics of the anchor line. The results of simulations show that anchors approach at equilibrium condition rapidly during the embedment and both the normalized holding capacity and the anchor line uplift angle remain constants in this stage. Besides the geometry of the fluke, the properties of the shank and soil are also crucial factors in the anchor-soil interaction behavior. Partial failure of mooring systems for floating structures will subject drag anchors to loads having an appreciable component outside of the intended plane of loading. Partial failure of mooring systems during hurricanes in recent years have generated an interest in understanding drag anchor performance under these conditions. The analysis {{presents the}} simulations of three dimensional trajectories of an anchor system subjected to an out-of-plane load component. For the conditions simulated in the example analyses, the anchor experienced a modest amount of continued embedment following partial failure of the mooring system; however, the ultimate embedment and capacity of the anchor is much less than what would have developed if the anchor had continued in its original trajectory within the plane of intended loading.

40|$|Shaft {{bearing system}} {{analysis}} codes were developed, improved, {{and used to}} investigate Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) Liquid Oxygen (LOX) turbopump bearing problems, and to support the Marshall Space Flight Center Bearing and Seal Materials Test (BSMT) program. Thermal network modeling uses the SINDA thermal code, and the modeling of bearing quasi-dynamic characteristics uses the SHABERTH bearing/shaft code. These codes are solved concurrently for a bearing/shaft system using software developed for this purpose. Simulation of the SSME LOX turbopump turbine and pump end bearings and the MSFC BSMT operating in liquid nitrogen (LN sub 2) and LOX was done. The thermal network models include the bearing components, bearing carriers, shaft, housing, frictional heat, and viscous fluid energy. A cage model was included to account for heat generation between the cage and rolling elements. Since most bearing surfaces operate at temperatures well above the coolant saturation temperature, and move at high speed relative to the coolant, forced convection boiling is the dominant mechanism for heat removal. Improved modeling of forced convection film boiling was incorporated {{to take into account}} the local vapor generation at the high temperature surfaces. Rearing preloads in the pump and tester are provided by <b>preload</b> springs. As <b>bearing</b> operating clearances and contact angles change due to thermal effects and loading, the <b>bearing</b> <b>preload</b> changes with these varying conditions. These characteristics were modeled and are included in the overall system models. Results from these models indicate an operational limit which, if exceeded, predicts a thermal excursion...|$|R
40|$|For {{the purpose}} to improve a design quality of {{high-speed}} spindle units, {{we have developed}} mathematical models and software to simulate a rotation accuracy of spindles running on ball bearings. In order {{to better understand the}} mechanics of ball bearings, the dynamic interaction of ball bearings and spindle unit, and the influence of the bearing imperfections on the spindle rotation accuracy, we have carried out computer aided analysis and experimental studies. When doing this, we have found that the spindle rotation accuracy can vary drastically with rotational speed. The influence of <b>bearing</b> <b>preload</b> has a secondary importance. Comparison of the results of these studies has demonstrated adequacy of the models developed to the real spindle units...|$|R
40|$|Chatter is a harmful {{machining}} vibration {{that occurs}} between the workpiece and the cutting tool, usually resulting in irregular flaw streaks on the finished surface and severe tool wear. Stability lobe diagrams could predict chatter by providing graphical {{representations of the}} stable combinations of the axial depth of the cut and spindle speed. In this article, the analytical model of a spindle system is constructed, including a Timoshenko beam rotating shaft model and double sets of angular contact ball bearings with 5 degrees of freedom. Then, the stability lobe diagram of the model is developed according to its dynamic properties. The Monte Carlo method is applied to analyse the <b>bearing</b> <b>preload</b> influence on the system stability with uncertainty taken into account...|$|R
