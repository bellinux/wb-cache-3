To obtain guarantees that arbitrary (and unknown) user processes are able to run isolated from privileged software and other user processes, instruction level noninterference and integrity properties are provided, along with proofs that transitions to <b>privileged</b> <b>modes</b> can only occur in a controlled manner. This work establishes a main requirement for operating system and hypervisor verification, as demonstrated for the PROSPER separation kernel. The proof is performed in the HOL 4 theorem prover, taking the Cambridge model of ARM as basis. To this end, a proof tool has been developed, which assists the verification of relational state predicates semi-automatically.

Rather that precluding deliberately harmful programs from producing their effects, our solution is aimed at limiting the spread of programming errors outside the memory scope of the running program.

These tools are then used for a study of micromaser dynamics, where the harmonic oscillator is a <b>privileged</b> cavity <b>mode</b> of the radiation field. In addition to being damped, the mode is also driven by atoms that traverse the cavity one by one and interact strongly with the quantized radiation. The most important statistical properties of the exiting atoms are derived.

40|$|In {{this era}} of accountability-driven, standards-based {{education}} policy, learning to develop system-level leadership capacity to prepare schools for instructional reform is imperative in advancing school improvement work. The investigation of school improvement networks increases awareness of how network-based consultants can facilitate the implementation of instructional practices in local contexts. Understanding how these consultants operate and which competencies are beneficial to their enactment of the role informs the field about building local capacity for instructional improvement. This case study of one large-scale school improvement initiative examines the organizational designs for the practice and guidance of network-based consultants, the interpretation and enactment of their role, and the initiative’s continual improvement process vis-à-vis the design and support for this work. This study comprises data gathered through observations, interviews, and documents. The analysis of these data draws on Feldman & Pentland’s (2003) ostensive and performative aspects of organizational routines. The ostensive defines what, ideally, the routine comprises; the performative is {{the execution of the}} routine in context (Feldman & Pentland, 2003). Spillane (2005) broadened these concepts beyond routines, noting that “ostensive and performative distinctions can be applied to other aspects of the situation, including structures and tools” (Spillane, 2005, p. 148). Following suit, I expand the ostensive and performative dichotomy to the designs for, and guidance of, practice. Through this analysis, I identified the most highly privileged functions of this consultant role as the organization and co-facilitation of local implementation teams and effective communication. Extending this finding, the most highly favored competencies for coordinators are communication, interpersonal skills, and content knowledge. These results reflect an emphasis on building the capacity of local districts to implement and sustain the improvement model within their contexts. The most highly <b>privileged</b> <b>modes</b> of guidance emerging from this analysis are interactive, human resources that allow for real-time, individualized support. Additionally, I expose challenges that the initiative faces {{due to the lack of}} an organized system for continuous improvement, and I suggest ways for the organization to be more deliberate and efficient in gathering and using feedback to improve the design and guidance of the consultant role...|$|R
