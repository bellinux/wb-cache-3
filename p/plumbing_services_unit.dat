40|$|Abstract In this paper, we {{consider}} districting problems for emergency service systems (such as ambulance systems). In such a service system, typically, N mobile <b>service</b> <b>units</b> cooperate {{in responding to}} calls from the public. The assignment of <b>service</b> <b>units</b> is determined by a priority order (such as the order of proximity) for the available <b>service</b> <b>units.</b> We divide the entire service area into several districts by considering the priority order. We give a general formulation for the districting problem and propose a model to obtain the objective for the formulation. The objective function of the formulation is the average response time computed from a stochastic model. The model assumes the continuous-time Markov chain with characteristic of random arrival of calls, assignment of a <b>service</b> <b>unit</b> considering the priority orders, service times depending {{on a combination of}} available <b>service</b> <b>units</b> and districts. We give a numerical example of an ambulance system for a city in Japan. Using actual data, we show the usefulness of our formulation and model...|$|R
