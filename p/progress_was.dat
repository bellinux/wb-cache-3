5|$|Although {{there were}} {{periodic}} attempts at reconciliation between the Metropolia and the Russian Church {{over the next}} few decades, no serious <b>progress</b> <b>was</b> made. During this time, the ethnic character of the Metropolia began to change. Since many Russian immigrants to America aligned themselves with the vocally anti-Communist ROCOR, the Metropolia experienced its growth increasingly through the addition of English-speaking converts. As a result, the ethnic makeup of the Metropolia began to shift away from a purely Slavic one that had included mainly Russians, Ukrainians, Galicians, and Rusyns.|$|E
5|$|Although {{they had}} {{initially}} {{been told that}} they would be withdrawn from the front within 48 hours, the strategic situation called that they remained at the front holding the ground on the eastern flank. In late July a breakout from the beachhead was attempted and the 1st Special Service Brigade moved through the Le Bois de Bavent, a large wooded area, as the Germans began to withdraw. Nevertheless, little <b>progress</b> <b>was</b> made, and, after a brief move which saw No. 6 Commando advance to Bavent, they went on the defensive again.|$|E

By {{the end of}} October they had crossed McMurdo Sound and advanced 60miles (100km) up the difficult Victoria Land coast, at which point they decided to concentrate all their efforts on reaching the Magnetic Pole. After traversing the Nordenskjold Ice Tongue and the treacherous Drygalski Glacier they were finally able to leave the coast and turn north-west, towards the Magnetic Pole's approximate location. Before then, David had a narrow escape after falling into a crevasse but was rescued by Mawson.|$|E

5|$|Regent Street {{was one of}} {{the first}} planned {{developments}} of London. The desire to impose order on the city's medieval street pattern dates back to the aftermath of the Great Fire of London (1666) when Sir Christopher Wren and John Evelyn drew plans for rebuilding the city on the classical formal model, but <b>progress</b> <b>was</b> slow and houses were rebuilt on the old street network anyway.|$|E
5|$|Simple filters. The {{frequency}} dependence of electrical response {{was known for}} capacitors and inductors from very early on. The resonance phenomenon was also familiar from an early date and {{it was possible to}} produce simple, single-branch filters with these components. Although attempts were made in the 1880s to apply them to telegraphy, these designs proved inadequate for successful frequency-division multiplexing. Network analysis was not yet powerful enough to provide the theory for more complex filters and <b>progress</b> <b>was</b> further hampered by a general failure to understand the frequency domain nature of signals.|$|E

The Road Board was formed in 1910 to address traffic issues, which led to the London Arterial Road Conferences in 1913–14 that revived the earlier plans. <b>Progress</b> <b>was</b> halted because of the war, but resumed in 1920, when it was hoped it would find work for demobilised soldiers.|$|E
