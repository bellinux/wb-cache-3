S.A.Andrée (1854–97), the first Swedish balloonist, proposed a voyage by hydrogen balloon from Svalbard to either Russia or Canada, which was to <b>pass,</b> <b>with</b> luck, straight over the North Pole on the way. The scheme was received with patriotic enthusiasm in Sweden, a northern nation that had fallen behind {{in the race for the}} North Pole.|$|E

5|$|Chelsea had {{the best}} of the chances after this, with Shevchenko {{controlling}} a long <b>pass</b> <b>with</b> his chest before passing to Kalou, but his subsequent attempt went wide of the Liverpool goal. Then two minutes later Shaun Wright-Phillips, who had replaced Drogba, ran down the righthand side of the pitch. He passed the ball to Kalou, but he was unable to pass to Shevchenko in the Liverpool penalty area, after being blocked by the Liverpool defence. Minutes later, Liverpool took the lead when Bellamy advanced down the left hand side of the pitch with the ball, his pass found Crouch, who headed into the Chelsea goal to make it 2–1. The lead was almost extended minutes later, as a Gerrard pass found Aurélio in the Chelsea penalty area, but his shot was saved by Cudicini. Chelsea had a final chance in stoppage time from a Lampard free-kick, but the ball was cleared from the Liverpool penalty area by Sissoko.|$|E
5|$|Eight {{different}} receivers {{caught at}} least one <b>pass,</b> <b>with</b> Dexton Fields leading all receivers in the game with sevencatches for 101yards. Both totals were the highest marks recorded in the game by either team. Fields was also the recipient of a play that tied for the longest pass play of the game, a 37-yard toss from Reesing halfway through the third quarter. Cornerback and game MVP Aqib Talib came into the game as a receiver several times, but because his appearance in the game was such an unusual occurrence, the Virginia Tech defense was able {{to zero in on}} him and prevent him from catching the ball.|$|E
5|$|If {{there is}} a pass in the {{mountain}} range, winds will rush through the <b>pass</b> <b>with</b> considerable speed because of the Bernoulli principle that describes an inverse relationship between speed and pressure. The airflow can remain turbulent and erratic for some distance downwind into the flatter countryside. These conditions are dangerous to ascending and descending airplanes. Cool winds accelerating through mountain gaps have been given regional names. In Central America, examples include the Papagayo wind, the Panama wind, and the Tehuano wind. In Europe, similar winds are known as the Bora, Tramontane, and Mistral. When these winds blow over open waters, they increase mixing of the upper layers of the ocean that elevates cool, nutrient rich waters to the surface, which leads to increased marine life.|$|E

5|$|Isolated and {{difficult}} to reach, the monument initially attracted few visitors, by 1920 only 1,800 for the year. The situation changed markedly when large numbers of Americans began to travel by automobile on roads paid for largely with government funds. One highway connected Grants <b>Pass</b> <b>with</b> the California coast at Crescent City. Another new road, the Oregon Caves Highway, led from the Grants Pass – Crescent City highway to the cave. Campaigns to attract car-driving tourists included those of the Cavemen, a booster group from Grants Pass that dressed in animal skins, posed along tour routes, and staged annual events to promote the monument. By 1928, {{the number of visitors}} to the cave had risen to about 24,000 a year.|$|E
5|$|News of the Donner Party's {{fate was}} spread eastward by Samuel Brannan, an elder of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and journalist, who {{ran into the}} salvage party as they {{came down from the}} <b>pass</b> <b>with</b> Keseberg. Accounts of the ordeal first reached New York City in July 1847. Reporting on the event across the U.S. was heavily {{influenced}} by the national enthusiasm for westward migration. In some papers, news of the tragedy was buried in small paragraphs despite the contemporary tendency to sensationalize stories. Several newspapers, including those in California, wrote about the cannibalism in graphic exaggerated detail. In some print accounts, the members of the Donner Party were depicted as heroes, and California a paradise worthy of significant sacrifices.|$|E
5|$|On December 31, {{the weather}} was clear and warm {{at the start of}} the game, though a light rain began to fall in the fourth quarter. Virginia Tech scored first, taking a 70 lead at the end of the first quarter—its only {{advantage}} in the game. In the second quarter, Nebraska scored three times for 17 points, taking a 177 lead before Virginia Tech quarterback Jim Druckenmiller threw a touchdown <b>pass</b> <b>with</b> 19 seconds remaining in the first half, cutting Nebraska's lead to 1714. In the third quarter, the two teams alternated scores, with Nebraska maintaining a three or 10-point lead throughout. At the end of the third quarter, Nebraska had a 3121 lead. In the final quarter of the game, Nebraska scored 10 unanswered points as the Cornhuskers used their large number of backup players to advantage. The final score was 4121, Nebraska.|$|E
