40|$|The {{conventional}} exposed pad low-profile quad {{flat pack}} (E-pad LQFP) package {{is a low}} cost solution for multimedia chips, but its disadvantages are limited pin count and worse electrical characteristics. In order to increase their pin utilization rate and electrical characteristics for high-speed applications, an innovative leadframe package, named multiple exposed pads (M-pad) LQFP package, is proposed. By bonding all power and ground wires to their dedicated exposed pads, the leads originally bonded to the corresponding power and ground wires {{can be used as}} the spared leads for the other signals, or they can be just removed to reduce the lead numbers, and thus the size and cost of the M-pad leadframe package. The M-pad LQFP package was evaluated for manufacturing processes and electrical characteristics. The parasitics of power nets and S-parameters of high-speed differential signals were extracted using 3 D electromagnetic field solvers. The simulated <b>power</b> <b>parasitics</b> of M-pad LQFP are much lower than those of E-pad LQFP and BGA packages. The simulated differential S-parameters of M-pad LQFP also indicate less signal loss compared with those of E-pad LQFP. The co-simulation of chip-(M-pad) package-board with multi-Gbps serial link was performed with well-behaved eye-diagrams that conform to high-definition multimedia interface (HDMI) specification...|$|E

40|$|Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) plants play a {{major role}} in the newest {{renewable}} technologies as they are the only ones with cost-effective possibility of energy store. In this context, it is of major importance to have the convenient tools to predict the behavior of the CSP plants before acting. For this reason, a program which can simulate with accuracy and quickness the behavior of CSP plants was created. The validation process is a must step in any simulation program development, as it provides the reliability and usefulness of such tool and is a fundamental activity to set the input parameters for a successful model performance. The present work presents the validation process carried out for a simulation tool especially designed for the energy yield assessment of concentrating solar plants based on parabolic through (PT) technology. The validation has been carried out by comparing the model estimations with real data collected from a commercial CSP plant. In order to adjust the model parameters used for the simulation, 12 different days were selected among one-year of operational data measured at the real plant. The 12 days were simulated and the estimations compared with the measured data, focusing on the most important variables from the simulation point of view: temperatures, pressures and mass flow of the solar field, gross <b>power,</b> <b>parasitic</b> <b>power,</b> and net power delivered by the plant. Based on these 12 days, the key parameters for simulating the model were properly fixed and the simulation of a whole year performed. The results obtained for a complete year simulation showed very good agreement for the gross and net electric total production. The estimations for these magnitudes show a 1. 47 % and 2. 02 % BIAS respectively. The results proved that the simulation software describes with great accuracy the real operation of the power plant and correctly reproduces its transient behavior.

At the same time, government and industry in development countries have teamed up to invest {{billions of dollars in}} partnerships intended to commercialize fuel cell vehicles within {{the early years of the}} 21 st century. The purpose of this study is evaluation of model and performance of fuel cell hybrid electric vehicle in different drive cycles. A fuel cell system model developed in this work is a semi-experimental model that allows users to use the theory and experimental relationships in a fuel cell system. The model can be used as part of a complex fuel cell vehicle model in advanced vehicle simulator (ADVI-SOR).

Lithium-titanate {{batteries}} {{have become}} a viable option for automotive energy storage due to their long lifetime, good energy density, and ability to withstand large charge/discharge currents. Normal vehicle operation exposes the battery to significant current demands which can cause substantial heat generation. Therefore, the battery pack requires an active thermal management system {{in order to maintain}} a safe operating temperature and prevent battery degradation. The goals for this research are to analyze the temperature rise and heat generation in a battery pack of 50 Ah lithium- titanate cells, and to design and evaluate cooling systems that maintain safe operating temperatures without consuming excessive <b>parasitic</b> <b>power.</b> A liquid crystal thermography technique was devised to measure the temperature rise of the cells under various charge/discharge current cycles.

50|$|Of {{particular}} interest to the SOFC-based IGFC power system is catalytic coal gasification, because of the characteristically high methane content of its resultant syngas. This process experienced development in the 1980s for synthetic natural gas production purposes. Compared to conventional gasification summarized above, a catalytic gasifier would require less oxygen input, run at a lower process temperature, and produce a syngas stream with a higher methane concentration (vol), in addition to hydrogen and carbon monoxide. With its lower operating temperature, a relatively high cold gas efficiency of at least 90% is projected for catalytic gasification, and this characteristic, {{as well as the}} process need for less oxygen input, would directly support high-efficiency IGFC power system operation. Furthermore, internal reformation of the substantial methane content of its syngas within the SOFC module can be used by design to assist module cooling, and can thereby lead to reductions in the <b>parasitic</b> <b>power</b> demand associated with cooling air supply.The SOFC electric power generator module in an IGFC system could conceivably be fueled with syngas supplied by any of the available conventional coal gasifiers, and studies indicate that power system electric efficiencies in the 45-50% range are achievable, depending on whether the power system uses atmospheric-pressure or pressurized SOFC modules. However, from the efficiency viewpoint particularly, the preferred coal gasification approach for the application is catalytic. Using that technology, IGFC system efficiencies in 56-60% range are projected, again depending on SOFC module pressurization.

40|$|A {{thermodynamic}} simulation is used {{to study}} the effects of oxygen-enriched intake air on the performance and nitrogen oxide (NO) emissions of a locomotive diesel engine. The <b>parasitic</b> <b>power</b> of the air separation membrane required to supply the oxygen-enriched air is also estimated. For a given constraint on peak cylinder pressure, the gross and net power outputs of an engine operating under different levels of oxygen enrichment are compared with those obtained when a high-boost turbocharged engine is used. A 4 % increase in peak cylinder pressure can result in an increase in net engine power of approximately 13 % when intake air with an oxygen content of 28 % by volume is used and fuel injection timing is retarded by 4 degrees. When the engine is turbocharged to a higher inlet boost, the same increase in peak cylinder pressure improves power by only 4 %. If part of the significantly higher exhaust enthalpies available as a result of oxygen enrichment are recovered, the power requirements of the air separator membrane can be met, resulting in substantial net power improvements. Oxygen enrichment reduces particulate and visible smoke emissions but increases NO emissions. However, a combination of retarded fuel injection timing and post-treatment of exhaust gases may be adequate to meet the locomotive diesel engine NO{sub x} standards. Exhaust gas after-treatment and heat recovery would be required to realize the full potential of oxygen enrichment.
