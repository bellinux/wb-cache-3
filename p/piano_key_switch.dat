40|$|Since {{the first}} {{implementation}} by Electricité de France on Goulours dam (France) in 2006, the <b>Piano</b> <b>Key</b> Weir {{has become a}} more and more applied solution to increase the discharge capacity of existing spillways. In parallel, several new large dams’ projects have been built with such a flood control structure, usually in combination with gates. Today, more than 25 <b>Piano</b> <b>Key</b> Weirs are in operation or under construction all over the world. Besides, more than 15 years {{of research and development}} have enabled detailed investigations of the hydraulic and structural behaviour of the <b>Piano</b> <b>Key</b> Weir complex structure and have provided more and more accurate design equations. Following the books of proceedings of two first workshops held in Liege (Belgium – 2011) and Paris (France – 2013), this book gathered all the contributions presented by people with varied background, from researchers to practitioners, during the 3 rd international workshop on Labyrinth and <b>Piano</b> <b>Key</b> weirs, organized in Qui Nhon, Vietnam. These papers, reviewed and accepted by an International Scientific Committee, summarize the current knowledge on <b>Piano</b> <b>Key</b> Weir, from a theoretical to a practical point of view, and present most of the main projects in operation or under construction.

40|$|<b>Piano</b> <b>Key</b> Weir is a cost {{effective}} solution for rehabilitation {{as well as}} for new dam project {{with a high level of}} constraints (space, flood discharge, reservoir level). If the efficiency of the <b>Piano</b> <b>Key</b> Weir has already been well demonstrated, the definition of its optimal geometry has been still poorly approached. In order to improve the design of the complex geometry of this structure, the study of the influence of the mean geometrical parameters on the discharge capacity is an essential stage. Following a former experimental study of the flow over <b>Piano</b> <b>Key</b> Weirs, highlighting the mean influence of three geometrical parameters, this paper presents the results of an experimental parametric study. These results highlight the influence of the alveoli bottom slopes on the <b>Piano</b> <b>Key</b> Weir release capacity. Comparisons with numerical and analytical results, as well as design advices are also provided. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Nappe {{oscillation}} {{may affect}} {{a variety of}} free overflow hydraulic structures operating at low heads such as crest gates and various types of weirs. This phenomenon produces oscillations in the thin nappe cascading downstream of the control structure. These oscillations {{can result in a}} high noise levels that may affect people and structures located nearby. With long linear and thin overtopping walls, <b>piano</b> <b>key</b> weirs might be subject to strong nappe oscillation risks, as a few documented cases with labyrinth weirs. However, the specific geometric features of <b>piano</b> <b>key</b> weirs, such as the outlet ramps or the limited width of the inlet apex, could perhaps prevent the development of nappe oscillation. In this paper, a prototype-scale linear weir is operated to assess the risk of nappe oscillations on a <b>piano</b> <b>key</b> weir like configuration (sidewall). In particular, the effect of the weir width and inclined apron is analyzed. The experimental results show that nappe oscillation development should not occur on <b>piano</b> <b>key</b> weir, contrary to what might be observed on a labyrinth weir with the same crest.

40|$|Abstract—The {{purpose of}} this study is to design a {{portable}} virtual piano. By utilizing optical fiber gloves and the virtual piano software designed by this study, the user can play the piano anywhere at any time. This virtual piano consists of three major parts: finger tapping identification, hand movement and positioning identification, and MIDI software sound effect simulation. To play the virtual piano, the user wears optical fiber gloves and simulates <b>piano</b> <b>key</b> tapping motions. The finger bending information detected by the optical fiber gloves can tell when <b>piano</b> <b>key</b> tapping motions are made. Images captured by a video camera are analyzed, hand locations and moving directions are positioned, and the corresponding scales are found. The system integrates finger tapping identification with information about hand placement in relation to corresponding <b>piano</b> <b>key</b> positions, and generates MIDI piano sound effects based on this data. This experiment shows that the proposed method achieves an accuracy rate of 95 % for determining when a <b>piano</b> <b>key</b> is tapped. Keywords—virtual piano, portable, identification, optical fiber gloves. I...|$|R
40|$|A {{hydraulically}} undersized {{control structure}} {{could result in}} water overtopping a dam or channel banks. To increase hydraulic capacity and reduce flooding risk, nonlinear spillways are frequently replacing linear weirs. This study investigates four subjects to further knowledge for two types of nonlinear weir, the <b>piano</b> <b>key</b> and labyrinth. Weir submergence is a condition when the downstream water level of a weir exceeds the weir crest elevation, and can influence the head-discharge relationship of the structure. The effects of submergence on laboratory-scale <b>piano</b> <b>key</b> weir head-discharge relationships were evaluated experimentally and compared to published submergence data for linear and labyrinth weirs. For relatively low levels of submergence, the <b>piano</b> <b>key</b> weir requires less upstream head relative to the labyrinth weir (3 ̆c 6...|$|R
