5|$|Despite the Cathedral's {{reaction}} to {{its use in}} Resistance: Fall of Man, the controversy {{has resulted in a}} significant increase in its visitor numbers according to David Marshall, director of communications for the Diocese of Manchester, writing in the Official PlayStation Magazine. Teachers tell him that teenagers in particular are interested to see a building which they thought was fictional. He adds that tourism has increased since the broadcast of <b>pictures</b> <b>taken</b> inside the Cathedral.|$|E
5|$|During {{the middle}} of the 20th century, {{examination}} of the maps and photographs from the previous century provided clear evidence that the 150 glaciers known to have existed in the park a hundred years earlier had greatly retreated, and in many cases disappeared altogether. Repeat photography of the glaciers, such as the <b>pictures</b> <b>taken</b> of Grinnell Glacier between 1938 and 2009 as shown, help to provide visual confirmation of the extent of glacier retreat.|$|E

5|$|In Erdely's story, Jackie {{disclosed}} to friends Cindy, Andy, and Randall {{the identity of}} her date to the fraternity party {{and said that he}} was the ringleader of the rape. Later media analysis of photos Jackie showed her friends of her date demonstrated that they were <b>pictures</b> <b>taken</b> from the public social media profile of a former high-school classmate of Jackie, who was not a student of the University of Virginia, did not live in the Charlottesville area, and was out of state at an athletic competition the day of the alleged attack.|$|E
5|$|In <b>pictures</b> <b>taken</b> by the Hubble Space Telescope in 1999, {{the motion}} of M87's jet was {{measured}} at four to six times the speed of light. This motion is presumably an optical illusion caused by the relativistic velocity of the jet, and not true superluminal motion. However, detection of such motion supports the theory that quasars, BL Lacertae objects and radio galaxies may all be the same phenomenon, known as active galaxies, viewed from different perspectives. It has been proposed M87 could actually be a BL Lacertae object (with a low-luminosity nucleus compared with the brightness of its host galaxy) seen from an unfavorable angle to appreciate the properties {{of that kind of}} galaxy.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} history of the park, {{visitors}} were allowed, and sometimes even encouraged, to feed the bears. Visitors welcomed the chance to get their <b>pictures</b> <b>taken</b> with the bears, who had learned to beg for food. This led to numerous injuries to humans each year. In 1970, park officials changed their policy and started a vigorous program to educate the public on the dangers of close contact with bears, and to try to eliminate opportunities for bears to find food in campgrounds and trash collection areas. Although it has become more difficult to observe bears in recent years, the number of human injuries and deaths has taken a significant drop and visitors are in less danger. The eighth recorded bear-related death in the park's history occurred in August 2015.|$|E

25|$|The {{benefits}} of ATG {{can easily be}} seen not only during day-night-day transitions, but also under dynamic lighting conditions when rapidly changing from low light to high light conditions (above 1 lx), such as sudden illumination of dark room. A typical advantage of ATG is best felt when using a weapon sight which experiences a flame burst during shooting (see figures below showing <b>pictures</b> <b>taken</b> at the impact zone of a dropped bomb). ATG would reduce the temporary blindness that a standard BSP tube would introduce, allowing them to continuously maintain “eyes on target”.|$|E
25|$|Perdita is {{an inner}} {{satellite}} of Uranus. Perdita's discovery was complicated. The first photographs of Perdita {{were taken by}} the Voyager 2 spacecraft in 1986, {{but it was not}} recognized from the photographs for more than a decade. In 1999, the moon was noticed by Erich Karkoschka and reported. Because no further pictures could be taken to confirm its existence, it was officially demoted in 2001. However, in 2003, <b>pictures</b> <b>taken</b> by the Hubble Space Telescope managed to pick up an object where Perdita was supposed to be, finally confirming its existence.|$|E

The book, Dreams, contains mostly <b>pictures</b> <b>taken</b> by photographer Dean Freeman.

The assailant was sectioned under the Mental Health Act 2007 and was charged with common assault. He admitted to the offence and was hospitalised for an indeterminate period.|$|E
25|$|In the Czech Republic, Street View {{was banned}} in September 2010 by the Czech Office for Personal Data Protection {{after more than}} half a year of {{unsuccessful}} negotiation between the Czech Republic and Google. The Office described Google’s program as taking pictures “beyond the extent of the ordinary sight from a street”, and that it “disproportionately invade citizens’ privacy.” However, <b>pictures</b> <b>taken</b> before this decision (mostly in 2009) may have remained available online but Google was obliged to erase every picture from that period should they be disputed. In May 2011, the ban was lifted after Google lowered the cameras by 30 centimeters.|$|E
25|$|Based on <b>pictures</b> <b>taken</b> by Cassini at 1,200km above Titan, {{the landing}} site {{appeared}} to be a shoreline. Assuming the landing site could be non-solid, Huygens was designed to survive the impact, splash down on a liquid surface on Titan, and send back data for several minutes under these conditions. If that occurred it was expected to be the first time a human-made probe would land in an extraterrestrial ocean. The spacecraft had no more than three hours of battery life, most of which was planned to be used during the descent. Engineers expected to get at most only 30 minutes of data from the surface.|$|E

25|$|Ma {{has been}} criticized by many {{environmental}} groups. His mayoral construction of the Maokong Gondola was criticized by the Taiwan Environmental Information Center. The construction of the Taipei Arena also drew negative reactions from these groups. The Society of Wilderness (SOW; 荒野保護協會) pointed out that of the three hundred and eighty-four trees that were moved for the construction, {{more than a hundred}} had already died. The city government said that the ages of the trees are unknown; therefore, they are not protected by law. The SOW then responded that, according to <b>pictures</b> <b>taken</b> by the United States Air Force in 1947 and 1948, these trees were present already during the Japanese rule era.|$|E
25|$|Today, {{owing to}} {{technological}} convergence, the word fluoroscopy is widely {{understood to be}} a hypernym of all the earlier names for moving <b>pictures</b> <b>taken</b> with X-rays, both live and recorded. Also owing to technological convergence, radiography, CT, and fluoroscopy are now all digital imaging modes using X-rays with image analysis software and easy data storage and retrieval. Just as movies, TV, and web videos are to a substantive extent no longer separate technologies but only variations on common underlying digital themes, so too are the X-ray imaging modes. And indeed, the term X-ray imaging is the ultimate hypernym that unites all of them, even subsuming both fluoroscopy and 4DCT. However, it may be many decades before the earlier hyponyms fall into disuse, not least because the day when 4D CT displaces all earlier forms of moving X-ray imaging may yet be distant.|$|E
25|$|Michael Arrington of TechCrunch and the Electronic Frontier Foundation have criticised Flickr for its heavy-handed {{implementation}} of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) and Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act (OCILLA). Under OCILLA, a service provider such as Flickr is obliged to delete or disable access to content {{as soon as they}} receive an official notice of infringement, to maintain protection from liability. After having one of his own <b>pictures</b> <b>taken</b> down following an incorrect DMCA claim, British comedian Dave Gorman researched the issue and concluded that if the Flickr user was not based in the United States – or they were but the person filing the notice of infringement was not – Flickr deleted the disputed content immediately. Even if the user could successfully demonstrate that the content did not infringe upon any copyright, Flickr did not, according to Gorman, replace the deleted content. He argued that this was contrary to its obligations in responding to a counter-notice. Shortly afterward, Flickr changed its policy.|$|E
