25|$|Still, {{there existed}} {{pressure}} {{to reform the}} enlisted component of the Navy's medical department—medicine as a science was advancing rapidly, foreign navies had begun training medically skilled sailors, and even the U.S. Army had established an enlisted Hospital Corps in 1887. Navy Surgeon General J.R Tryon and subordinate physicians lobbied the Navy administration to take action. With the Spanish–American War looming, Congress passed a bill authorizing establishment of the U.S. Navy Hospital Corps, {{signed into law by}} President William McKinley on 17 June 1898. Three rates were created therein—hospital apprentice, hospital apprentice first class (a <b>petty</b> <b>officer</b> <b>third</b> <b>class),</b> and hospital steward, which was a chief petty officer.|$|E

500|$|On {{the night}} of April 12, Norris didn't dare take the two ARVN {{soldiers}} who had faltered the night before.

They worked their way slowly upriver until they came upon an abandoned, destroyed village. They found clothing and an abandoned sampan, which they used to disguise themselves as fishermen.

Stopping to check his map at one point, Norris suddenly realized that two NVA soldiers were sitting about [...] away. Fortunately, they were asleep. Traveling upriver in the sampam, they broke out of the heavy fog and found themselves under the Cam Lo bridge. They had passed Hambleton’s position more than 30 minutes ago. Turning around, they worked their way south before putting ashore and began to search for Hambleton. They finally found him sitting in a clump of bushes, alive but partly delirious and extremely weakened, having eaten only four small ears of corn in 12 days and having lost [...] since his plane was shot down. He weighed only [...] Sunrise was coming, and although Norris thought it best to wait until dark to return downriver, Hambleton needed to be evacuated immediately. Despite the risk, they hid Hambleton {{in the bottom of the}} sampan, covered him with bamboo, and started downriver.|$|E

5000|$|Each rating has an {{official}} abbreviation, such as AM for aviation structural mechanic. When {{combined with the}} <b>petty</b> <b>officer</b> level, this gives the shorthand for the <b>petty</b> <b>officer's</b> rank, such as AM3 for aviation structural mechanic <b>third</b> <b>class.</b> It is common practice {{to refer to the}} <b>petty</b> <b>officer</b> by this shorthand in all but the most formal correspondence, such as printing an inscription on awards. Often the <b>petty</b> <b>officer</b> is referred to by the shorthand designation, without using the surname. Thus AM3 Anderson would be called AM3. To address a <b>petty</b> <b>officer,</b> one would say, [...] "Petty Officer Smith," [...] "Smith," [...] or [...] "sailor," [...] the latter two forms being acceptable for use by those equal or greater in rank than the <b>petty</b> <b>officer.</b> It is uncommon to address a <b>petty</b> <b>officer</b> as simply [...] "petty officer" [...] the way one might address an NCO in the Army as [...] "sergeant." [...] It is also acceptable, though archaic, to address a <b>petty</b> <b>officer</b> or chief <b>petty</b> <b>officer</b> of any grade as [...] "Mister Smith" [...] or [...] "Miss Smith."
