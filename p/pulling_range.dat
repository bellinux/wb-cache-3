40|$|Generally, {{quartz crystal}} {{inductance}} frequency pulling in oscillators {{is very low}} and therefore is not often used in practice. The new method of improving frequency pullability uses inductance to compensate for quartz stray capacitances. To this end, a special AT fundamental quartz crystal working near the antiresonance frequency is selected. By modifying its equivalent circuit with load inductance and series tuning capacitance, the magnetic sensing of the circuit can be highly improved. The experimental {{results show that the}} new approach using the quartz crystal stray capacitance compensation method increases the frequency <b>pulling</b> <b>range</b> (from ≅ 2 kHz/μH to ≅ 600 kHz/μH) by × 300 {{depending on the type of}} oscillator, making possible the measurement of nano-magnetic changes...|$|E

40|$|In modern RF {{system on}} chips (SoCs), the digital content consumes up to 85 % of the IC chip area. The recent push to {{integrate}} multiple RF-SoC cores is met with heavy resistance by the remaining RF/analog circuitry, which creates numerous strong aggressors and weak victims leading to RF performance degradation. A key such mechanism is injection pulling through parasitic coupling between various $LC$-tank oscillators {{as well as}} between them and strong transmitter (TX) outputs. Any static or dynamic frequency proximity between aggressors (i. e., oscillators and TX outputs) and victims (i. e., oscillators) that share the same die causes injection pulling, which produces unwanted spurs and/or modulation distortion. In this paper, we propose and demonstrate a new frequency planning technique of a multicore TX where each $LC$-tank oscillator is separated from other aggressors beyond its <b>pulling</b> <b>range.</b> This is done by breaking the integer harmonic frequency relationship of victims/aggressors within and between the RF transmission channels using digital fractional divider based on a phase rotation. Each oscillator's center frequency can be fractionally separated by ~ 28 % but, at the same time, both producing closely spaced frequencies at the phase rotator outputs. The injection-pulling spurs are so far away that they are insignificantly small (- 80 dBc) and coincide with the second harmonic of the carrier. This method is experimentally verified in a two-channel system in 65 -nm digital CMOS, each channel comprising a high-swing class-C oscillator, frequency divider, and phase rotator...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of the research of tires {{was to determine the}} dynamic rolling radius and to apply it to wheel slip calculations with special respect to vertical wheel load and to tire inflation pressure. It is typical of mechanical four-wheel drive tractors that there is a definite additional power in the tractor power chain. This additional power is dependent on the difference between the front wheel and rear wheel peripheral speeds. Further-more, the purpose was to determine the effect of additional slip on four-wheel drive tractors operated without drawbar pull. Experiments were performed on asphalt surfaces and fields. A new measurement method was developed, and a device was constructed for the implementation of three tractor wheel drive operational modes (four-wheel drive, rear-wheel drive and front-wheel drive). As the result of the experiments, a relationship was found to describe the dynamic rolling radius for low-profile radial tires tested on rigid road surfaces. On this basis, the classical slip calculation method was modified. This phenomenon appears only on hard roads and soil surfaces with high adhesion coefficients and only within the low drawbar <b>pull</b> <b>range...</b>|$|R
