Pascu refused hospitalization. His only request was to be administrated something {{in order to get}} some sleep, and the doctor gave him Diazepam. A second call followed a couple of hours later; this time Pascu was unconscious. Doctors tried to resuscitate, but to no avail. It was determined that Pascu died due to a heart attack.|$|E

Co-morbidity was objectively assessed by a record-linkage with previous hospitalizations, in order to assess the occurrence of <b>previous</b> <b>illnesses</b> that could be associated with the likelihood of being identified as frails or at risk. The methodological approach is based on social network analysis (SNA), suited to explore relational aspects of complex phenomena.|$|R
500|$|A brief lull in {{hostilities}} allowed Pitt {{to concentrate}} effort on Ireland, where {{there had been}} an uprising and attempted French landing in 1798. In 1800, the British and Irish Parliaments passed an Act of Union that took effect on 1 January 1801 and united Great Britain and Ireland into a single state, known as the [...] "United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland". George used the opportunity to drop the title [...] "king of France", which English and British Sovereigns had maintained since the reign of Edward III. It was suggested that George adopt the title [...] "Emperor of the British Isles", but he refused. As part of his Irish policy, Pitt planned to remove certain legal disabilities that applied to Roman Catholics. George III claimed that to emancipate Catholics would be to violate his coronation oath, in which Sovereigns promise to maintain Protestantism. Faced with opposition to his religious reform policies from both the King and the British public, Pitt threatened to resign. At about the same time, the King had a relapse of his <b>previous</b> <b>illness,</b> which he blamed on worry over the Catholic question. On 14 March 1801, Pitt was formally replaced by the Speaker of the House of Commons, Henry Addington. Addington opposed emancipation, instituted annual accounts, abolished income tax and began a programme of disarmament. In October 1801, he made peace with the French, and in 1802 signed the Treaty of Amiens.|$|E
2500|$|The {{court case}} between Devereux and Lechelad would not resume again for 10 years. On 14 October 1211 William de Lechelad testified under his sworn oath that by {{inheritance}} he had greater right to Leach, Gloucester, which Cecilia held in demesne. Cecelia presented her claim to Leach [...] as her right because her grandfather, William Devereux held {{the land in}} the time of Henry, the king’s father. William de Lechelad claimed the greater right to the holding based on his descent from William Devereux, and the passing of the land from William Devereux to Lechelad’s mother, Orenge Devereux. Further, Lechelade stated that Cecilia’s right only was through marriage. The case was granted a new date on 19 November 1211. On 19 November 1211 Cecilia put in her place Thomas fitzWilliam in the ongoing land dispute which had been delayed again. In January 1212 the assize was put in respite again {{due to a lack of}} jurors, and a new date given on 9 April 1212. On 21 May 1212, the hearing was delayed yet again due to lack of jurors, and a claim by Peter de Barton that William de Lechelade had not recovered from his <b>previous</b> <b>illness.</b> The court did not require Cecilia Devereux to accept this excuse as 4 knights had not yet confirmed his illness, and a new date was set. On 24 June 1212 the final hearing took place, and the jury found in favor of William de Lechelad and his heirs. Cecilia Devereux could make no further claims on these 33 acres. The Pipe Roll for Michaelmas 1212 records the payment by Cecilia Devereux of 2 marks for making a false claim.|$|E

60|$|For instance; when Sowerberry had {{an order}} for the burial of some rich old lady or gentleman, who was {{surrounded}} by a great number of nephews and nieces, who had been perfectly inconsolable during the <b>previous</b> <b>illness,</b> and whose grief had been wholly irrepressible even on the most public occasions, they would be as happy among themselves as need be--quite cheerful and contented--conversing together with as much freedom and gaiety, as if nothing whatever had happened to disturb them. Husbands, too, bore the loss of their wives with the most heroic calmness. Wives, again, put on weeds for their husbands, as if, so far from grieving in the garb of sorrow, they had made up their minds to render it as becoming and attractive as possible. It was observable, too, that ladies and gentlemen who were in passions of anguish during the ceremony of interment, recovered almost as soon as they reached home, and became quite composed before the tea-drinking was over. All this was very pleasant and improving to see; and Oliver beheld it with great admiration.|$|E
60|$|The fog {{had already}} {{closed in on}} Monterey, and was now rolling, a white, billowy sea above, that soon shut out the blue {{breakers}} below. Once or twice in descending the mountain Concho had overhung the cliff and looked down upon the curving horse-shoe of a bay below him,--distant yet many miles. Earlier in the afternoon {{he had seen the}} gilt cross on the white-faced Mission flare in the sunlight, but now all was gone. By the time he reached the highway of the town it was quite dark, and he plunged into the first fonda at the wayside, and endeavored to forget his woes and his weariness in aguardiente. But Concho's head ached, and his back ached, and he was so generally distressed that he bethought him of a medico,--an American doctor,--lately come into the town, who had once treated Concho and his mule with apparently the same medicine, and after the same heroic fashion. Concho reasoned, not illogically, that if he were to be physicked at all he ought to get the worth of his money. The grotesque extravagance of life, of fruit and vegetables, in California was inconsistent with infinitesimal doses. In Concho's <b>previous</b> <b>illness</b> the doctor had given him a dozen 4 grain quinine powders.|$|E
60|$|Had Ivanhoe {{been present}} at Ronen, when the King meditated his horrid designs against his nephew, {{there is little}} doubt that Sir Wilfrid would have {{prevented}} them, and rescued the boy: for Ivanhoe was, as we need scarcely say, a hero of romance; and it is the custom and duty of all gentlemen of that profession to be present on all occasions of historic interest, to be engaged in all conspiracies, royal interviews, and remarkable occurrences: and hence Sir Wilfrid would certainly have rescued the young Prince, had he been anywhere in the neighborhood of Rouen, where the foul tragedy occurred. But he was a couple of hundred leagues off, at Chalus, when the circumstance happened; tied down in his bed as crazy as a Bedlamite, and raving ceaselessly in the Hebrew tongue (which he had caught up during a <b>previous</b> <b>illness</b> in which he was tended by a maiden of that nation) about a certain Rebecca Ben Isaacs, of whom, being a married man, he never would have thought, had he been in his sound senses. During this delirium, what were politics to him, or he to politics? King John or King Arthur was entirely indifferent to a man who announced to his nurse-tenders, the good hermits of Chalus before mentioned, that he was the Marquis of Jericho, and about to marry Rebecca the Queen of Sheba. In a word, he only heard of what had occurred when he reached England, and his senses were restored to him. Whether was he happier, sound of brain and entirely miserable, (as any man would be who found so admirable a wife as Rowena married again,) or perfectly crazy, the husband of the beautiful Rebecca? I don't know which he liked best.|$|E
40|$|To {{identify}} life-related factors causing increased mortality, 2, 769 rural residents aged 29 - 77 {{were investigated}} through a self-administered questionnaire in 1990.

Age, obesity, life attitude, job, marital status, {{drinking and smoking}} habits, <b>previous</b> or current <b>illness,</b> and frequency of participation in health examinations were checked during the baseline survey. The person-year mortality rate was higher among irregular participants in health examinations than among regular participants both among males and females.

Under this model, some <b>previous</b> <b>illnesses</b> (e.g., mental ill health) are recognized as behavior disturbances only, and other types of medicine (e.g., complementary or alternative medicine and traditional medicine) are studied by the medicine researchers, sometimes with the aid of health geographers without medical education.

As a first step in bringing down Shaftesbury, Dugdale gave evidence against his fellow informer Stephen College at the Old Bailey, when a verdict of Ignoramus (i.e. we find no case against the accused) was returned by the grand jury, 8 July 1681. At the later Oxford trial of College (the Crown having simply ignored the grand jury's finding that he had no case to answer), Dugdale swore against him, but came into direct conflict with his old associates like Titus Oates.

Therefore, this case highlights the importance of treating cancer in patients with Trousseau syndrome. In addition, the FDP and D-dimer levels changed in parallel with changes in the CEA level, which suggests that the activity of cancer is related to an internal thrombotic tendency.
