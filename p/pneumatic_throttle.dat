50|$|At {{launch the}} {{innovative}} {{design of the}} Imp was underdeveloped, {{in part because of}} UK Government pressure to start production quickly in response to the job losses in shipbuilding. Mechanical and cooling system problems were commonplace in the early cars. At the end of 1965 a major revision to the Imp was introduced, effectively splitting the marque into Mk I and Mk II cars. The Mk I Imps had a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>throttle</b> linkage and an automatic choke, both of which were replaced by more conventional items on the Mk II. The Mk II also had improved front suspension geometry and several trim and detail changes. Although the car was constantly improved over its production life, there was no single change as significant as that in 1965.|$|E
5000|$|Most <b>pneumatic</b> {{die grinder}} <b>throttles</b> (also called triggers) feature a {{spring-loaded}} [...] "kickstand" [...] mechanism between the throttle lever {{and the body}} of the grinder. This prevents the throttle from opening (being pressed down towards {{the body of the}} grinder) without operator intervention and inhibits accidental activation. It is similar in principle to the safety catches used on many handguns.|$|R
5000|$|In 2006 Harley-Davidson Introduced a non-street legal eight-second drag bike nicknamed [...] "the Destroyer". It {{came with}} the same engines as others in its family, with the {{exception}} of a long stroke flywheel, larger valves, dyno tuned velocity stacks, large bore high compression forged pistons, high lift cams, multi stage lock-up clutch, programmable shift light, <b>pneumatic</b> shifter, larger <b>throttle</b> bodies, and more race equipment. A total of 646 vehicles were produced with 625 released to dealer showrooms. The Destroyer was inspiration for a four-time world champion in NHRA Pro Stock motorcycle drag racing the Harley-Davidson Screamin’ Eagle/Vance & Hines V-Rod. This Screamin’ Eagle/Vance & Hines V-Rod ran 6.815 seconds and went nearly 200 mph in the quarter-mile.|$|R
