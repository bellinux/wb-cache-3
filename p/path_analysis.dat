5|$|In 1981, Sexual Preference {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} the historian Paul Robinson in Psychology Today and Richard P. Halgin in Library Journal, a negative review from the sociologist John Gagnon in The New York Times, a notice in Newsweek, and a discussion in The Chronicle of Higher Education, {{which focused on}} the controversy surrounding the book. The following year, it received a negative review from Michael Ignatieff in the London Review of Books. Reviewers faulted the work on grounds such as the questionable representativeness of its sample of homosexuals, though those who reviewed it positively praised it for reasons including the sophistication of its <b>path</b> <b>analysis.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1982, Sexual Preference {{received}} negative {{reviews from}} the psychologist Clarence Tripp in the Journal of Sex Research and the sociologist Ira Reiss in Contemporary Sociology, mixed reviews from the sociologist John DeLamater in Science and the sex researcher James D. Weinrich in The Quarterly Review of Biology, {{and a positive}} review from J. Kenneth Davidson, Sr. in the Journal of Marriage and Family. Criticisms made of the work included that its authors' conclusions were based on an unrepresentative or dubiously representative sample of homosexuals, and that their reliance on <b>path</b> <b>analysis</b> and adult recall of early childhood feeling was problematic.|$|E
5|$|Seen {{as likely}} to provoke {{controversy}} even before its publication, Sexual Preference received considerable media attention, and reviews that were mainly mixed or negative. Critics questioned Bell et al.′s reliance upon a statistical technique, originally developed {{for use in the}} biological sciences, called <b>path</b> <b>analysis,</b> disputed the representativeness of their sample of homosexuals, pointed out the difficulty and potential unreliability of adult recall of childhood feeling and the vague and general nature of the questions respondents were asked, and disagreed with Bell et al.′s suggestion that sexual orientation is innate. Nevertheless, some reviewers complimented Sexual Preference for its authors' challenge to established views about the causes of homosexuality, and it eventually came to be considered a classic work. It {{is one of the most}} frequently cited retrospective studies relating to sexual orientation, credited by psychologists with disproving psychoanalytic theories about the development of homosexuality. In 2009, the American Psychological Association credited Bell et al. with helping to discredit theories attributing sexual orientation to family dynamics or trauma.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn this article, {{we carry}} out a rough <b>paths</b> <b>analysis</b> for Banach space-valued Wiener processes. We show {{that most of the}} {{features}} of the classical Wiener process pertain to its rough path analog. To be more precise, the enhanced process has the same scaling properties and it satisfies a Fernique type theorem, a support theorem and a large deviation principle in the same Hölder topologies as the classical Wiener process does. Moreover, the canonical rough paths of finite dimensional approximating Wiener processes converge to the enhanced Wiener process. Finally, a new criterion for the existence of the enhanced Wiener process is provided which is based on compact embeddings. This criterion is particularly handy when analyzing Kunita flows by means of rough <b>paths</b> <b>analysis</b> which is the topic of a forthcoming article...|$|R

25|$|Psychometricians {{have also}} {{developed}} methods {{for working with}} large matrices of correlations and covariances. Techniques in this general tradition include: factor analysis, a method of determining the underlying dimensions of data; multidimensional scaling, a method for finding a simple representation for data {{with a large number}} of latent dimensions; and data clustering, an approach to finding objects that are like each other. All these multivariate descriptive methods try to distill large amounts of data into simpler structures. More recently, structural equation modeling and <b>path</b> <b>analysis</b> represent more sophisticated approaches to working with large covariance matrices. These methods allow statistically sophisticated models to be fitted to data and tested to determine if they are adequate fits.|$|E

500|$|Smith {{considered}} the study useful for its authors' challenge to established {{views about the}} causes of homosexuality, but he found their account of homosexuality remote from real experience and was unconvinced by their conclusion that it has a biological basis.

500|$|Bell et al. {{considered}} their sample of homosexual adults more representative than {{those used in}} previous studies, and argued {{that the fact that}} they examined blacks separately from whites, and men separately from women, helped them {{to determine the extent to}} which patterns of homosexual and heterosexual development depend on race and sex. They wrote that while Bell, a psychologist and therapist, was [...] "relatively supportive of psychodynamic theory", Weinberg and Hammersmith were sociologists with a different theoretical perspective. They argued that their varying outlooks counteracted any bias due to their respective backgrounds. Bell et al. did not believe that completing their study earlier would have altered their findings. Believing that familiarity with scientific theories about homosexuality might bias their respondents′ answers, Bell et al. did not report results that could be explained through exposure to books, articles or scientific lectures about homosexuality. They used <b>path</b> <b>analysis,</b> a statistical technique originally developed for use in the biological sciences, to try to establish which factors were most important. <b>Path</b> <b>analysis</b> required dividing [...] "the independent variables into sequential stages, according to the time when their influences are most likely to occur."

500|$|Bem, in {{a defense}} of his {{hypothesis}} published {{in the same issue}} of Psychological Review, wrote that in their <b>path</b> <b>analysis</b> Bell et al. engaged in [...] "an unfortunate dichotomization of the dependent variable, sexual orientation ... grouping the bisexual and homosexual respondents into the same category." [...] In his view, while this procedure [...] "might have seemed reasonable on a priori grounds ... it should have been abandoned as soon as the researchers saw the results of their own subanalyses, which {{made it clear that the}} bisexual respondents were not only very different from their exclusively homosexual counterparts but actually were more like the heterosexual respondents in theoretically critical ways."

[...] "reduced many of the correlations and increased the likelihood that important antecedent variables would be erroneously eliminated during the recursive process of discarding the weaker correlates from successive iterations of the path model." ...|$|E
500|$|Robinson {{suggested}} that Bell et al. might have misidentified gender nonconformity {{as a cause}} of homosexuality, rather than as one of its expressions, but nevertheless found Sexual Preference to be a [...] "superb" [...] book that answered the question of how people become heterosexual or homosexual better than any previous study, disqualified most previous answers, and was comparable to Kinsey's best work. He maintained that their study's empirical foundation and <b>path</b> <b>analysis</b> gave Bell et al.′s findings [...] "unprecedented trustworthiness". Robinson credited Bell et al. with documenting the [...] "intellectual poverty" [...] of psychoanalytic hypotheses about homosexuality. He lamented that unlike Sexual Behavior in the Human Male (1948) and Sexual Behavior in the Human Female (1953), which gained popular attention, Sexual Preference [...] "seems destined for academic oblivion." [...] Halgin wrote that the book would be considered a landmark publication in sexology, and was more scientifically rigorous than most research in the field, but that it was also likely to create controversy.|$|E
500|$|Sexual Preference {{attracted}} considerable {{media attention}} in 1981. Prior to its publication, Jane E.

[...] According to Brody, Bell said that he expected the study to be condemned by both [...] "radical gays for even looking into the subject and by the analysts who may say we're trying to paint a glowing picture of homosexuality," [...] the psychologist John DeCecco called Sexual Preference [...] "very dubious on a theoretical basis and on the basis of how reliable and valid is asking people about their childhood", and the psychoanalyst Irving Bieber described Bell et al.′s findings as [...] "totally disparate" [...] with his experience from psychiatric consultation.|$|E

500|$|Gagnon {{considered}} Sexual Preference {{a politically}} motivated study that would inevitably be {{received as a}} political and moral statement. He noted that Bell et al.′s conclusion {{that the lack of}} correlation between sexual orientation and early family experience means that the development of heterosexuality and homosexuality must be based on a biological predisposition was controversial. He criticized Bell et al.′s use of <b>path</b> <b>analysis,</b> arguing that it over-emphasized differences between heterosexual and homosexual patterns of development, and wrote that their reliance on adult recall of early childhood feeling was inconsistent with all recent research on memory, suggesting that respondents' answers to Bell et al.′s vague and general questions might reflect a subsequent reconstruction of events rather than an accurate recall of childhood. Gagnon also criticized Bell et al.′s decision to group together [...] "the respondents' observations relating to certain behaviors and attitudes", and their failure to provide new biological evidence. Ignatieff wrote that even if Bell et al.′s conclusion that family upbringing and factors such as labeling have little measurable effect on adult sexual orientation was correct it would not justify their additional claim that homosexuality is biologically innate, and that they had not resolved the question of how responsible people are for their sexual orientation.|$|E
500|$|Reiss {{concluded}} that Sexual Preference [...] "has value for suggesting directions and the likely worth of ideas", but that given its shortcomings {{there was no}} way in which its authors could definitively resolve the issues they explored, despite their claim to [...] "once and for all" [...] discredit some theoretical ideas about homosexuality. Reiss wrote that Bell et al. asked questions that were [...] "vague" [...] and [...] "open-ended", had an [...] "arbitrary and rigid conception" [...] of what could be done with their data and lacked [...] "theoretical development" [...] in its handling, and deliberately minimized the importance of the predictor variables they used to test psychoanalytic and other theories. He found their conclusion that sexual orientation has a biological basis unconvincing. DeLamater wrote that Sexual Preference benefited from Bell et al.′s [...] "eclectic theoretical basis", which drew from the psychodynamic model, social learning theory, sociological models that emphasize the importance of peer relationships, and labeling theory. However, while he accepted Bell et al.′s claim that their study was methodologically superior to prior work on homosexuals, he still found it problematic for many reasons and hesitated to endorse its conclusions. In his view, the <b>path</b> <b>analysis</b> involved [...] "arbitrary classification and sequencing of variables".|$|E
500|$|In a {{citation}} graph the vertices are documents with {{a single}} publication date. The edges represent the citations from the bibliography of one document to other necessarily earlier documents. The classic example comes from the citations between academic papers as {{pointed out in the}} 1965 article [...] "Networks of Scientific Papers" [...] by Derek J. de Solla Price. [...] In this case the citation count of a paper is just the in-degree of the corresponding vertex of the citation network. This is an important measure in citation analysis. Court judgements provide another example as judges support their conclusions in one case by recalling other earlier decisions made in previous cases. A final example is provided by patents which must refer to earlier prior art, earlier patents which are relevant to the current patent claim. By taking the special properties of directed acyclic graphs into account, one can analyse these graphs with techniques not available when analysing the general graphs considered in many studies in network analysis. For instance transitive reduction gives a new insights into the citation distributions found in different applications highlighting clear differences in the mechanisms creating citations networks in different contexts.

500|$|The {{psychoanalyst}} Gerard J. M. van den Aardweg, {{writing in}} the American Journal of Psychotherapy, criticized Bell et al.′s interpretation of their data. Aardweg argued that too many studies suggest that domineering mothers {{play a role in}} the development of male homosexuality for Bell et al.′s conclusion that mothers have at most a weak influence on the development of their sons' sexual orientation to be readily acceptable, that all questionnaire studies have inherent limitations, and that their data are inferior to those collected over time by psychotherapists. He suggested that homosexuals might give defensive answers due to not wanting to be labelled abnormal, that Bell et al.′s data were of poor quality, since too few questions about parental behavior had been asked and open-ended questions yielded superficial answers, and that it was unjustified to conclude that parents must have only a small influence on the development of their children's sexual orientation simply because that influence did not reveal itself clearly. He accused Bell et al. of admitting the limitations of <b>path</b> <b>analysis</b> only to then ignore those limitations, arguing that the technique had [...] "numerous dubious premises" [...] and that Bell et al. used it in a way that was open to technical objections such as its failure to [...] "distinguish between different types of psychodynamic development to homosexuality". He considered Bell et al. mistaken to treat their variables as isolated items, rather than in combination with each other. He also found the studies cited by Bell et al. as evidence that homosexuality might have a hormonal basis unconvincing.|$|E
500|$|The philosopher Frederick Suppe {{considered}} Sexual Preference a {{very important}} study that failed to duplicate the findings of Bieber et al. or the predictions of symbolic interactionism, labeling theory, and societal reaction theory approaches. Suppe considered Bell et al.′s sample of homosexuals, while highly biased, to nevertheless be the most representative ever made, and argued that biased samples can be adequate {{for the purposes of}} refuting theories propounded in other studies [...] "so long as the types of subjects used in those other studies constitute a subsample of the replicative study′s sample and the latter's population does not go beyond the claimed scope of the replicated studies." [...] He maintained that Bell et al.′s study meets these requirements, that their use of <b>path</b> <b>analysis</b> was appropriate, and that their procedures for developing a composite etiology model, which contained [...] "virtually all paths advanced in the literature", are legitimate. He argued that the only plausible basis for disputing that the study definitively refutes [...] "social learning theories of homosexual etiology" [...] is to challenge the adequacy of Bell et al.′s models and the questions they used. However, he questioned some of the details of Bell et al.′s methodology, including the questions asked. He wrote that while Bell et al. did not use the same specific questions that Bieber et al. employed, they did use [...] "questions directed at the same concerns." [...] He noted that Bell et al.′s data regarding subjects′ negative feelings toward and relationships with their fathers were based on open-ended interview questions, adding {{that it would have been}} preferable had they employed the same [...] "structured-answer questions" [...] used in Bieber et al.′s earlier study. He rejected Bell et al.′s claim that their study supports a biological explanation of sexual orientation.
