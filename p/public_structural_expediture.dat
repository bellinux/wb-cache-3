We analyse the role of private restructuring and <b>public</b> <b>structural</b> reforms for the urgently needed readjustment of intra-euro area imbalances. A panel regression reveals a significant impact of private restructuring and <b>public</b> <b>structural</b> reforms on intra-euro area competitiveness. This implies that private restructuring and public reforms are rather than public transfers the best way to preserve long-term economic stability in Europe. structural reforms, competitiveness, current account imbalances, euro area, European Monetary Union, dynamic panel estimation, interaction term...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{evidence supporting}} endogenous growth models that emphasize <b>public</b> <b>structural</b> capital. The authors apply a simple test of endogenous vs. exogenous growth models. In exogenous growth economies temporary innovations to policy variables lead only to temporary changes in GNP levels, while in endogenous growth economies the innovations {{can lead to}} permanent changes in GNP levels. Of the seven U. S. policy variables they examine, only non-military equipment capital and non-military structural capital have a statistically and economically significant effect upon long-run GNP levels. Further estimation suggests that the non-military equipment capital result is not robust and that several disaggregate components of structural capital contribute significantly.

30|$|Considering 91 {{countries}} with seaports, this study conducted an empirical {{inquiry into the}} broader economic contribution of seaborne trade, from a port infrastructure quality and logistics performance perspective. Investment in quality improvement of port infrastructure and its contribution to economy are often questioned by politicians, investors and general <b>public.</b> A <b>structural</b> equation model (SEM) is used to provide empirical evidence of significant economic impacts of port infrastructure quality and logistics performance. Furthermore, analysis of a multi-group SEM is performed by dividing countries into developed and developing economy groups. The results reveal that it is vital for developing countries to continuously {{improve the quality of}} port infrastructure as it contributes to better logistics performance, leading to higher seaborne trade, yielding higher economic growth. However, this association weakens as the developing countries become richer.|$|R

We extend the existing literature by estimating a model of the British economy that takes into account long run factors such as public debt accumulation. We find that in such a long run framework, public investment has a significant and permanently positive effect on GDP growth; this result runs counter to the most recent literature on the topic that was limited to a short run specification. We further find, by comparing different subsamples, that the introduction of the golden rule in 1997 strengthened the positive effect of public investment. fiscal policy, golden rule of <b>public</b> finance, <b>Structural</b> VAR, <b>Public</b> Investment, UK Economy...|$|R

40|$|Social {{workers can}} play an {{important}} role in the lives of parental caregivers and their children who have developmental disabilities. However, these individuals often do not experience meaningful social work services. This qualitative study focused on meaningful social work services that can assist in the provision of parental care and caregiving to persons with developmental disabilities. The question under review was: "From the perspective of caregivers, what knowledge, values, and skills are necessary for social workers to provide meaningful services to them in caring for their daughters and sons who have developmental disabilities?" A fundamental assumption of the study was the recognition of caregivers as the experts with respect to their needs. A purposive, convenience sample of 15 caregivers was developed in St. John's, NL., where they each participated in nonscheduled, standardized interviews. Interviews involved an open-ended interviewing technique that emphasized personal experiences and participants' viewpoints using probes to ensure in-depth coverage of broad topic areas. The study's findings were obtained through a synthesis of the audio tape-recorded interviews, documented through written summaries, and approved by the respective study participants. A feminist theoretical lens was used to interpret the findings and enhance the discussion. The findings lent support to a number of significant contentions. First, parental caregiving of persons with developmental disabilities is a women's issue. Second, this caregiving often results in oppressive life circumstances for caregivers. Third, caregiving, while typically viewed as a private issue, is intricately linked to <b>public</b> <b>structural</b> issues and social policy. Fourth, social workers who use a feminist practice lens have an ability to provide life enhancing service to caregivers. Fifth, caregivers are the experts in their lives. They provided valuable information pertaining to the appropriate combination of knowledge, values, and skills that social workers need to best serve them. The study's results are discussed in consideration of social work practice, social work education, and social service agency opportunities to make a positive difference in eradicating oppression for caregivers by addressing their needs as defined by them...|$|R
