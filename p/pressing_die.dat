In {{order to}} {{investigate}} {{the effect of a}} confinement condition on the damage induced by a spherical impact, an experimental setup that can impact contact pressure to the specimen through a <b>pressing</b> <b>die</b> was composed. The steel and the WC balls in 3 mm diameter impacted to the soda-lime glass specimen with dimension of 33 × 33 × 8 m in the impact velocity range of 30 m/s to 200 m/s. Three different conditions are given for the impact damage investigation, which are the case without a <b>pressing</b> <b>die</b> and the cases of p= 0 MPa and p= 200 MPa with a <b>pressing</b> <b>die.</b> The stress distribution in the glass specimen by impacting the particle was also evaluated using MARC s/w system. The particle impact produced various kinds of the damage such as the ring and the cone cracks, the radial cracks and the craters. The contact pressure applied to the specimen changed stress fields in the specimen. The damage zones of the specimen without a <b>pressing</b> <b>die</b> increased as the impact velocity increased. The damage extents in the specimen with the contact pressure of 200 MPa were reduced as compared with the case of those without a <b>pressing</b> <b>die...</b>|$|E

Scrap jumping up is one problem which usually occurs in high-speed stamping manufacturing processes. In this paper, the relevant factors are analyzed and studied such as the press tool, the shape {{and size of the}} stamping pieces, the structure and rigidity of <b>pressing</b> <b>die,</b> the clearance between punch and die, material properties of the blank, etc. Then ten cases are summarized that lead to scrap jumping up.

40|$|The {{manufacture}} of dies and moulds {{is a critical}} aspect of many production systems since the manufacturing and try-out of new dies and moulds often is essential in determining the lead-time and quality of a new production system. In the automotive industry, many new car models are introduced each year and {{for each of these}} models, a new set of <b>pressing</b> <b>dies</b> has to be designed and manufactured. The manufacturing of <b>pressing</b> <b>dies</b> consists of several different process steps of which machining and manual polishing contribute largely to the time and cost. To be able to improve the manufacturing processes rationally, for example by optimising the machining to reduce or eliminate the subsequent manual work, an appropriate specification of the required surface quality, using a relevant parametric description of the surface, is needed. In <b>pressing</b> <b>dies,</b> the effects of manufacturing processes on functional performance are not fully understood. One of the reasons for this is the lack of effective methods for characterisation. In the work described in this thesis, research is conducted to evaluate and establish such methods. It was found that surface roughness measurement of dies, with the purpose of manufacturing process development, requires 3 D data. Replication often needs to be used in these cases since dies usually are too large to bring into a lab measurement equipment. The replication techniques tested in this thesis work adequately. For quality control in production 2 D measurements from a handheld instrument are good enough if an appropriate measuring strategy is used and limits for the evaluated parameters are defined. Using a multi-scale approach when analysing roughness data {{it may be possible to}} find so called functional bandwidths. With the analysis focused on the functional bandwidth the characterisation is more effective and it is easier to identify roughness parameters which correlate to the functional property or the process parameter of interest. Such a method for functional filtering of roughness data is developed and presented in the thesis. Surface texture anisotropy has been found to be important for the function of a die surface. It has also been observed that texture anisotropy can vary depending on the scale of observation. The method developed in this work to analyse and visualise texture anisotropy as a function of scale can be a helpful tool when evaluating die surfaces, especially when analysing surfaces produced with different manufacturing methods to make sure that the manufactured surface has the required texture properties in the relevant scales...|$|R

The main objective {{of the study was}} to evaluate whether the MHP method could be used as a plausible substitute for manual polishing in <b>pressing</b> <b>die</b> manufacturing. To do this, sample surfaces were hammered and evaluated. Changes to the surfaces were assessed using surface roughness measurements, hardness measurements and optical images. First of all, the workpiece surface was smoothened. Secondly, the surface hardness was increased significantly. Thirdly, the nodules on the workpiece surface were effected. They appeared to be smaller and not as visible. It is probable that they had been plastically deformed and that some of the graphite in the nodules was replaced by material from the surrounding steel matrix. By replacing the graphite in the larger nodule cavities by surrounding steel material, a die surface is created which would be less prone to galling.

The materials was first deformed in equal channel angular <b>pressing</b> <b>die</b> (ECAP) to one and two passes, via route BC and then deformed in plane strain compression (PSC) to two axial true plastic strain values of 0. 5 and 1. 0. The study provides a documentation {{of the evolution of}} microstructure parameters namely; cell size, misorientation angle, fraction of submicron grain size and fraction of high angle grain boundaries. These microstructure parameters were investigated on the plane normal to the loading direction in PSC (RD-TD). These microstructure parameters are compared to those achieved due to the ECAP process only. The ideal rolling texture orientations are depicted and crystal orientation maps were generated. The spatial distribution of grains having these orientations are revealed through these maps.

40|$|Calibration of two commercially {{available}} glow discharge double focusing mass spectrometers, the VG 9000 and Element GD, is described using synthetic pin standards pressed from solution doped copper and zinc matrices. A special <b>pressing</b> <b>die</b> {{was developed for}} this purpose and optimal results were obtained with the highest possible pressures, i. e., 95 kN 2 ̆ 022 cm - 2. This calibration approach permits the determination of trace element mass fractions down to 3 ̆bcg 2 ̆ 022 kg - 1 with small uncertainties and additionally provides traceability of the GD-MS results in the most direct manner to the SI (International System of Units). Results were validated by concurrent measurements {{of a number of}} compact copper and zinc certified reference materials. The impact of the sample pin cross-section (circular or square) was investigated {{with the use of a}} new pin-sample holder system for the Element GD. The pin-sample holder was designed by the manufacturer for pin-samples having circular cross-section; however, samples with square pin cross-section were also shown to provide acceptable results. Relative Sensitivity Factors for some 50 analytes in copper (VG 9000, Element GD) and zinc matrices (VG 9000) are presented. The field of applicability of GD-MS may be considerably extended via analysis of pin geometry samples based on their ease of preparation, especially with respect to the accuracy and traceability of the results and the enhanced number of analytes which can be reliably calibrated using such samples. 9 2011 Elsevier B.

First, the focus is on methods for obtaining measurement data. Second, the focus is on methods for relating the measurement data to functional performance. In contrast, the technique commonly used today for characterisation is visual and tactile inspection, with the help of reference surfaces, by an experienced operator. In this work, effective 3 D measuring strategies were established for <b>pressing</b> <b>die</b> surfaces, including the use a surface replication technique. It was also found that machined surfaces are more homogeneous than manually polished surfaces and therefore require fewer measurements to give representative results. Furthermore, it was established that in production, a 2 D profiler can be used for quality control of a finish milled steel surface, in regard to surface roughness, if an appropriate measuring strategy is used and limits for the evaluated parameters first are established for each combination of cutting tools, cutting data, workpiece material etc. In addition, using Rz (average peak-to-valley profile roughness) or Rp (highest peak) is better than using Ra (arithmetical mean deviation) if surface finish appearance is to be assessed. The method employed in this study, using scale-sensitive fractal analysis, for evaluating functional correlations and designing filters was very usable and gave good results. This method can surely be applied to other types of surfaces and functional correlations. Also, there is a correlation between the surface roughness parameter Sq (root-mean-square deviation of the surface) and the surface finish appearance of pressing dies and this correlation is stronger in certain wavelengths on the surface...|$|E
