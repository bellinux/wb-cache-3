5000|$|The Pigou Club is {{described}} by its creator, economist and blogger N.

[...] These pundits and economists often advocate lowering other taxes to keep the total amount of taxes collected the same, though many have also proposed dedicating the revenue to other worthwhile projects. A Pigovian tax (also spelled <b>Pigouvian</b> <b>tax,</b> named after economist Arthur Cecil Pigou) is a tax levied to correct the negative externalities (negative side-effects) of a market activity. These ideas are also known as an Ecotax (or green tax shift).|$|E

40|$|Previous {{analysis}} of pollution presumes separation between pollutees and polluters. In the model developed here, all possible combinations {{of housing and}} industry locations are allowed.

Accordingly, our analysis considers {{a wide range of}} policy instruments extending from <b>Pigouvian</b> <b>taxes,</b> double taxes, to zoning regulations. The results demonstrate that the management of pollution requires the recognition of two separate regimes determined by the type of convexity or concavity of the pollution dispersion function. When this function is convex, the optimal solution requires no zoning of housing. When the dispersion function is concave in emissions, the optimal allocation implies zoning into industrial and residential zones and, in some circumstances, taxes equal to total damages. To achieve effective management under limited information regarding the pollution dispersion function, it is argued that zoning restrictions cab be determined by trial and error through observation of changes in land rents. economic policy, environmental externalities, land, rents, taxation, Agricultural and Resource Economics...|$|R
5000|$|The first {{published}} reference to 'road pricing' was possibly in 1949 when the RAND Corporation proposed [...] "use of direct road pricing to make freight journeys more expensive on congested routes or {{to influence the}} time of day at which freight traffic operates". Nobel-laureate William Vickrey then built on the ideas of the economist Arthur Pigou, outlining a theoretical case for road pricing in a major work on the subject of 1955 proposing in 1959 that drivers should be charged by electronic means for use of busy urban roads. Arthur Pigou had previously developed the concept of economic externalities in a publication of 1920 in which he proposed that what is now referred to as a <b>Pigouvian</b> <b>tax</b> equal to the negative externality should be used to bring the outcome within a market economy back to economic efficiency.|$|E
50|$|One {{effective}} method of tackling externalities is through government intervention, with {{the imposition of}} environmental or 'green' taxes. Take, for example, a plant which emits noxious fumes {{in the process of}} smelting copper. These fumes cause health issues for individuals who live in the plant's vicinity, to the sum of x dollars per ton of copper output. The plant owners have no obligation to cover these costs and therefore they are not included in private cost calculations; this means output occurs at a level where the marginal social cost exceeds the marginal private cost and the level of output exceeds the quantity which is optimally beneficial to society. This market failure can be addressed with the introduction of a <b>Pigouvian</b> <b>tax,</b> whereby the government imposes a tax on either output (the copper produced), or input (the coal used in the smelting process). The level of the tax should equal the level of negative externalities, so that the producers are now responsible for the full cost of their activity and output falls to the socially optimal level.|$|E
5000|$|The {{prudential}} {{capital controls}} should differentiate {{the types of}} capital inflow based on {{their contributions to the}} systemic risk. Since different forms of capital inflow would result in different probabilities of future capital outflows with different payoff characteristics {{in the event of a}} crisis, thus they lead to different degrees of negative externality. [...] In the case of an emerging market economy, Korinek (2010) found that dollar debt imposes a larger negative externality, followed by CPI-indexed debt that hedges against the exchange rate risk as dollar debt suffers, local currency debt and portfolio investment. The non-financial foreign direct investment often stays in the country when a financial crisis occurs so that it has no externalities. In other words, the <b>pigouvian</b> <b>tax</b> should be set equal to the magnitude of the externalities of different inflow types. Based on Korinek’s (2010) estimated the optimal annual magnitude of externalities for various types of capital inflows for Indonesia. As the graph shows, the magnitude of externalities confirms the indicated order of magnitude for different types. Long run average indicates an average magnitude of externalities for the past 20 years. And red bars capture the magnitude during the 1997-1998 Asian Crisis. It is clear that externalities of foreign capital inflow rise during booms and leverages were built up. After a crisis, the externalities are smaller once the economy was de-leveraged. Therefore, the magnitude of optimal tax should be time-variant which depends on the financial vulnerability over business cycles. The optimal tax rates should be tighter during the boom and lowered even to zero during the bust.|$|E

Additionally, we derive cost benefit rules for a green tax reform on the context of a two sector economy, in particular, a final goods sector and a knowledge sector, considering two externalities - one environmental externality and one technology externality. ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Pigouvian</b> <b>taxes</b> are {{typically}} imposed {{in situations where}} there is imperfect knowledge {{on the extent of}} damage caused by a producing firm. A regulator imposing imperfectly informed <b>Pigouvian</b> <b>taxes</b> may cause the firms that should (should not) produce to shut down (produce). In this paper we use a Bayesian information framework to identify optimal signal-conditioned taxes in the presence of such losses. The tax system involves reducing (increasing) taxes on firms identified as causing high (low) damage. Unfortunately, when an abatement decision has to be made, the tax system that minimizes production distortions also dampens the incentive to abate. In the absence of wrong-firm concerns, a regulator can solve the problem by not adjusting taxes for signal noise. When wrong-firm losses are a concern, the regulator has to trade off losses from distorted production incentives with losses from distorted abatement incentives. The most appropriate policy may involve a combination of instruments. conditioning; heterogeneity; informativeness; Pigouvian tax; signaling...|$|R
