40|$|Judicial {{review is}} often {{the only way to}} correct errors made by the Immigration and Refugee Board in refugee determinations. Applicants must seek leave from the Federal Court, where a judge will decide if their case is {{suitable}} for judicial review. The stakes are high for refugee claimants confronting deportation to countries where they may face persecution, torture or death. The author reviews over 23 000 applications for judicial review from 2005 to 2010, and finds troubling inconsistency in leave grant rates at the Federal Court. Over 36 per cent of judges deviated by more than 50 per cent from the average rate of granting leave, with twenty judges granting leave more than ten times as often as the judge with the lowest leave grant rate. This inconsistency continues at the <b>judicial</b> review <b>stage.</b> The author considers several external factors that could explain it, from the judge 2 ̆ 7 s political party of appointment to the impact of the Supreme Court of Canada 2 ̆ 7 s decision on standard of review in Dunsmuir. Ultimately, the author concludes that the outcome of a leave application hinges largely on which judge is assigned to decide the application, and that this poses an arbitrary barrier to access to justice for refugees. The author considers various solutions to this problem, from abolishing the leave requirement to requiring written reasons or a panel of judges. At a minimum, he suggests that the test for leave should be clarified, as the limited jurisprudence has provided insufficient guidance to judges. Forthcoming reforms to the refugee determination system, including the introduction of the Refugee Appeal Division, will in his view increase rather than diminish the importance of fair and consistent judicial review of refugee determinations...|$|R
40|$|The {{beginning}} of the 1990 s saw many African countries embarking {{on the process of}} drafting new constitutions as they abandoned independence constitutions. Most of the independence constitutions were perceived as constitutions without constitutionalism and they were generally blamed for failure of democracy {{and the rule of law}} in Africa. The study analyses the state of democracy and constitutionalism and the impact that colonialism had on the African continent. Apart from the spurt of new constitutions adopted, democracy is growing very slowly in most African states with widespread human rights violations and disregard for the rule of law and the principle of separation of powers, still holding the centre <b>stage.</b> <b>Judicial</b> independence is an important component of democracy in the modern state. The study therefore scrutinizes how the principle of judicial independence can be promoted and protected to enhance democracy. One important mechanism which plays a crucial role in safeguarding judicial independence is the way judicial officers are appointed. The study selects four countries – Swaziland, Kenya, Zimbabwe and South Africa and analyses how judicial officers are appointed in these countries in an effort to find an effective and optimal approach. The premise of the study is centred on the role of constitutionalism and the process of appointing judges as a means of promoting and safeguarding democracy in these selected countries.

40|$|This thesis {{sets out}} to study {{constitutional}} developments in Swaziland from 1960 to 2005. Such a study {{has not yet been}} subjected to scholarly enquiry by historians. This thesis therefore {{sets out to}} fill this yawning gap in the historiography of Swaziland. In doing this longitudinal study of Swaziland s constitutional developments in the colonial and post-colonial periods, the author took into consideration the historical context, actors and processes involved. She relied heavily on primary sources including parliamentary and senatorial debates, official gazettes of the Swazi Government, Reports of the European Advisory Council and the Swazi National Council, newspapers, and oral interviews. Interviews with selected politicians and a host of legal experts were useful in illuminating cloudy constitutional issues. This thesis revealed that Swaziland s constitutional developments under British tutelage was shaped by a concatenation of factors including the African political environment in the aftermath of World War II, Swaziland s monarchical structures, its Black-White racial composition, and its geo-political location within the sphere of influence of South Africa. These factors underscored the uniqueness of Swaziland s constitutional history. The modern political leaders including John June Nquku, Dr. Ambrose Zwane, Sishayi Nxumalo, Clifford Nkosi and Dr. George Msibi formed political parties to capture power in the Kingdom of Swaziland from the departing British colonial authorities. They subscribed to Kwame Nkrumah s radical brand of nationalism which clamoured for immediate independence and Africa for Africans meaning the Africanisation of all sectors and services. While recognising the importance of the monarchy in Swazi society, they felt the Swazi King, as a traditional ruler, was ill-fitted for the business of modern governance and should restrict himself to traditional matters. The White Swazis operating under the European Advisory Council with Carl Todd as their leader, supported the conservative monarchy {{at the expense of the}} radical nationalists whose ideology threatened their investments in Swaziland. The Swazi monarch and the White minority, therefore, constituted an alliance to check the rising tide of radical nationalism in Swaziland. The various stakeholders could not come to a compromise from 1960 to 1963 over several constitutional issues, especially the future of the Swazi monarchy in a modern state and the issue of the exercise of popular suffrage on the basis of one-man-one vote; Britain therefore decided to impose a Constitution on Swaziland in 1963. The imposed Constitution failed to satisfy any of the stakeholders. The conservative traditional monarchists cried foul because King Sobhuza was provided a token ceremonial role in the constitution since Britain did not expect a traditional ruler to be engaged in modern politics. The White community under Todd rejected the constitution because equal European representation was not included in it and the traditional monarchy, which they preferred to the radical political parties, was marginalised. The radical political leaders rejected the constitution on grounds that it did not provide for one-man-one vote under universal adult suffrage and also because it introduced the federation of races which favoured the White minority who were disproportionately overrepresented in the Legislature. Britain ignored the rejection of the imposed constitution and went ahead to announce elections for June 1964. The White United Swaziland Association (USA) party and the Imbokodvo (INM) formed a coalition to contest the elections and received logistical and financial support from apartheid South Africa, while opposition parties contested the elections in dispersed ranks. Not surprisingly, the USA-INM alliance won all the seats. The initiative for the revision of the 1963 imposed constitution, therefore, fell on the two political parties in the legislature, namely the INM and the USA. The exchanges between the two allies during the constitutional debates were heated and bitter over the issue of separate electoral roll for Whites. At the end of the debates, the majority INM had its way with the establishment of a single electoral roll for all. It submitted the 1967 constitutional proposals which the British endorsed. The 1967 constitution was the penultimate constitution enacted in Swaziland which, for the first time, granted the territory full internal self-government based on a bicameral Legislature and which recognised Sobhuza as Head of State and King of Swaziland. Swaziland became independent in September 1968 under the British-tailored Westminster Constitution but the Constitution had a short life span of just five years. Two principal reasons explain the collapse of the Independence Constitution. First, Swaziland was not spared of constitutional developments in other parts of the continent where a common tendency among Anglophone independent African states was to amend, revise or alter the British-tailored Westminster Constitution and introduce a single party rule. These developments appealed to the conservative instincts of the Swazi monarchy who was no lover of the Westminster liberal democratic constitution. Second domestic developments in Swaziland led to the collapse of 1968 constitution. A dispute between the government and B. T. Ngwenya of the opposition Ngwane National Libaratory Congress after the May 1972 multiparty elections ended in court with the victory of the opposition. Sobhuza responded to this <b>judicial</b> decision by <b>staging</b> an auto-coup d état on 12 April 1973 followed by the declaration of a state of emergency. The Kingdom remained without a constitution for the next 32 years, an unprecedented constitutional void that is unrecorded in Africa s recent history. King Sobhuza ruled by the proclamation of decrees and orders-in-council. After his demise in 1982 his son, King Mswati III, continued to rule by decree until a new constitution was promulgated for Swaziland in 2005.

Tarkastelun kohteena on kunnan ja oikeusjärjestelmän välinen suhde, jonka sisältö ulottuu sosiaali- ja terveydenhuollon ulkopuolella lasten ja perheiden välisiä suhteita, opetusta ja kulttuuria, työtä ja työllistymistä, onnettomuuksien estämistä, ympäristönsuojelua, elinympäristöjen suunnittelua ja rakentamista, ravintoa, kulutusta ja tuoteturvallisuutta käsittelevään sääntelyyn. Preventiivisiä säännöksiä tarkastellaan sekä sosiaalioikeuden että hyvinvointivaltiollisen sosiaalipolitiikan kautta. Suhde hyvinvointivaltioon on tutkimukseen sisältyvä arvolähtökohta, suhde sosiaalioikeuteen määräytyy sääntelyn systematisoinnin kautta esille nousevien oikeusperiaatteiden ja niihin sisältyvien käsitteiden kautta. Tutkimus tarkastelee kunnan roolia paikallisen hyvinvoinnin toteuttajana, lainsäädännön nojalla määrittyviä ehkäisemisen keinoja ja sitä koskevia vastuita kuntaorganisaation sisällä. Tutkimusaineistona olleesta lainsäädännöstä systematisoitavissa olleiden suojelun, inkluusion ja syrjäytymisen ehkäisyn periaatteiden ja niihin sisältyvien käsitteiden muodostaman koherenssin nojalla preventiivisten säännösten voidaan katsoa erottuvan muusta sääntelystä erillisenä säädösten ryhmänä. Periaatteiden kautta on mahdollista hahmottaa, mitä muilla hallinnonaloilla toteutuva "sosiaalinen" on ja mitä se merkitsee kunnallisessa toiminnassa. Kunnan toimivalta ehkäisemiseen liittyvissä tehtävissä on laaja. Kunta päättää strategisista perusvalinnoista ennakollisen tai jälkikäteisen toimintamallin välillä, samoin kuin siitä, minkälaisten keinojen tai palvelujen avulla ehkäisemistä toteutetaan. Tehtävät jakautuvat toiminnan rakenteellisia ehtoja määrittäviin poliittisiin linjauksiin ja viranomaistoimintoina suoritettaviin asiantuntija- ja valvontatehtäviin. Ehkäisevän sosiaalipolitiikan kannalta merkittävin rooli kunnan sisällä on valtuustolla, joka päättää talousarviosta myös erityistoimialojen toimielimille kuuluvien tehtävien resursoinnissa. Missä asemassa ehkäiseminen on kunnallisessa politiikassa määräytyy vain osaksi sääntelystä käsin. Olennaista on, pyritäänkö kunnallisten toimintojen suunnittelussa ja toteutuksessa tietoisesti ehkäisemään ja estämään hyvinvoinnin kannalta ongelmallisia kehityskulkuja ja myönnetäänkö palveluja ehkäisevinä vai vasta ongelmien syntyessä. Kunnan yhteys paikalliseen toimintaan ja ihmisten arkeen voi muodostua juuri {{prevention}} kautta edellyttäen, että paikalliset tarpeet ja kuntalaisten hyvinvointi hyväksytään politiikan lähtökohdaksi. Kunnan rooli ehkäisemisen järjestämisessä on pitkälle rinnakkainen valtionhallinnon kanssa. Kun valtio hoitaa kansalliset ja alueelliset tehtävät, kunnan vastuulla on paikallisen prevention toteuttaminen. Prevention, {{social law}} and municipality - local authority as an implementer of preventive social policy in current legislation This research investigates {{the role of}} the municipality as an implementer of preventive social policy in current legislation, the tasks given to municipalities under that, whether or not these statutes reach beyond social welfare and health care and the liability distributions of the preventative action within municipal organisations. The legal objective in this study was the assembly of statutes and the formulation of rules of interpretation. In addition the objective was the systemisation of legislations, particularly in relation to social law. The purpose was to examine whether the systematised legal principles or concepts make visible the legislative content supporting municipalities preventive regulations as a special area of social law or as a distinct body of enactments from other legislation in general. Although prevention as a part of social activities has almost as long a history as poor relief, the related judicial research has not been performed. Moreover, very little research has been conducted on prevention through social policy. Considering the above, defining preventative social policy as a concept was necessary to rendering the topic researchable and the resulting research reliable. The theoretical approaches of this research are based on jurisprudence and the sociology of law. Through the use of systemisation and interpretation, judicial research aims to answer questions concerning the content of the current legislation. In this study legal concepts are treated mostly as concepts defining the regulated domain and not as expressions of the judicial systems normative content. In addition, legal principles are approached more as arguments {{to be taken into account}} in the interpretation of regulations than as applicable norms. As a research on the sociology of law the study examines the relationship between the legal order and the municipality in social policy of the welfare state. Through prevention, this approach is also connected to the discussion of the Risk Society. Particularly the examination of the preventive aspects of the Social Welfare Act and its implementation bring the dimensions of legal policy to this research. The research material primarily comprises the Constitution, parliamentary law, Government bills and <b>preliminary</b> works, and <b>judicial</b> and social policy literature. From the viewpoint of traditional jurisprudence research, the approach of this thesis is extensively empirical. The preliminary understanding of the research scope originated in the Social Welfare Decree, that defines responsibilities of the Social Welfare Board. The Board must take into consideration the social aspects in health care, education, land use and construction, housing, employment, cultural and leisure activities as well as public transport and other services. The examination of the content of single regulations is based on a framework derived from the concept of preventive social policy. Functional characteristics of this concept comprise goal, intervention and approach, as well as their respective attributes, empowerment, prevention and precaution. The research methodology comprised juridical interpretation and qualitative social science research content analysis in which a content-based approach and established theoretical models alternated and were materials and theoretical models combined in various ways. According to the research findings, the preventive duties of municipalities extend beyond the social welfare and health care and touch upon education, teaching, employment, environmental planning, construction and use of the environment, and monitoring industrial health and safety functions, foodstuffs, consumer products and environmental protection. Planning, improvement of living conditions, provision of services and financial support, information, direction, advice and supervision are means of precaution of the risks, dangers and problems. In addition to planning, other methods of surveillance include inspections, granting permission to start up and practice a business or activity, notifications, suspension or shutting down operations and conditional fines. The intensity of the intervention varies in scope from providing advice to extreme limitations on individual autonomy and intervening in private actors possibilities to operate. In education, employment, social welfare and health care the primary interventions are the services provided to individuals. It is a particular characteristic of social services as well as e. g. mental health care services that they can be granted either preventatively or for other purposes. Legislation does not define the time or circumstances upon which services should be granted in order to be preventative. These decisions depend on the operational culture within the municipality, and its policies. On the contrary in the case of supervision, as well as benefits and services falling under subjective rights form an exception, where the question of prioritising preventative interventions is determined by the legislator. A municipality has broad authority in preventative functions, almost to the extent of sovereign. It may determine basic strategic choices based on an anticipatory or retrospective model, as well as the type of services and means by which preventative measures are implemented. Tasks and interventions are divided into specific policies defining the structural conditions of the operations and expert functions carried out by authorities. Like in other municipal functions, the municipal council plays a significant role within preventative social policies. The council also determines the budget for issues falling under the specific sphere of authorities. As the basis of the council's decisions are determined the orientation and resources of the municipality's employment policy, as well as whether employment policy aspects will be considered in municipal investments. The council approves in the municipality both general and local plans, and makes decisions to apply for state approval to provide educational services, e. g. vocational training. In addition to the municipal council and government, other bodies have related political mandates. For example, the body responsible for the tasks of Social Welfare Board has a broad development mandate which obliges it to prevent the formation of unfavourable living conditions. The weight placed on prevention in municipal policy depends on whether the municipality aims to prevent problematic developments from emerging based on the improvement of living conditions, land use planning and the related implementation, and on whether services are provided on a preventative basis or only after the problems occur. The connection between the municipality, local activities and the everyday life of citizens can form precisely through preventative activities, as long as local needs and the welfare of the municipality s population are accepted as the policy bases. To a great extent, the competence of the municipalities in preventative activities are of the equal quota that of the state. While the state attends to national and regional responsibilities, the municipalities have responsibility for local ones. The municipalities have the competence to arrange the preventative functions and decide on how to organize them. The delegation of preventative tasks to private actors can take place only by an Act or by virtue an Act. However in social and health care on the basis of current legislation this is possible regardless of the nature of the service as a subjective right or the allocation in the budget. This, however, presupposes that the municipality decides on the criteria to be applied in the provision of preventive services, and that these criteria are included with adequate specificity in the contract between the municipality and the service provider. For example, outsourcing compulsory basic education and supervisory functions of municipalities would require changes in legislation. In the main prevention will be implemented via structural solutions, whose tasks cannot be transferred to the private sector and whose context lies almost wholly beyond the scope of the current legislation. While the municipal task is to attend to local people s welfare, a private actor s interests lay either in profitability or in promoting the interests of certain groups. Attending to the public good requires comprehensive local expertise covering various administrative sectors, something which private operations can not be assumed to posses. Furthermore, reaching an adequately detailed agreement, e. g. concerning municipal obligations for development of living conditions, so that the realization of public interests could be supervised, would not be feasible in practice. Any extent transfer of municipal tasks would at the same time mean a withdrawal from safeguarding the interests of the general public and rescinding the municipal powers which constitute a municipality s autonomy. The legislation that formed the research material in this study systemically demonstrates three principles of law: protection, inclusion and the prevention of social exclusion. These principles and the concepts they contain form a coherent whole, on the basis of which preventive provisions emerge as a group of distinct regulation among other legislation. Based on this it is possible to outline what the realised social aspect is in other public administration areas and what it means in municipal activities. The knowledge generated by a single research project is limited. Prevention, and the implementation of the related regulations at both municipal and national level requires additional research...|$|R
