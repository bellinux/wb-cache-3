40|$|PhDThis thesis {{analyses}} which principles should {{govern the}} interpretation of tax treaties. This field is complex - because tax treaties have a dual status. Tax treaties are treaties between States - which are governed by public international law, the principles {{of which have been}} codified in the 1980 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. Tax treaties are also laws which can affect the domestic rights of taxpayers (and States). Different, and possibly conflicting, principles of interpretation may apply in public international, and in (different) domestic, contexts. This thesis seeks to reconcile these different principles, recognising that tax treaties should be interpreted uniformly. Only if this is done can double taxation (and double non-taxation) be avoided - and reciprocity achieved. This thesis analyses why, and when, the Vienna Convention is relevant in interpreting a tax treaty in a domestic context. It seeks to describe a uniform approach to tax treaty interpretation - which could be applied by domestic courts worldwide. It reaches four main conclusions. Firstly, a textual approach (endorsed as the starting <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>interpretation</b> at a public international level by Article 31 (1) of the Vienna Convention) should (also) be the starting <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>interpretation</b> in a domestic context. Secondly, the proper approach in a domestic context cannot be the mirror image of the Vienna Convention approach. Thirdly, a uniform domestic approach cannot be identical to any one particular State's approach to {{the interpretation of}} its domestic tax statutes. Fourthly, a uniform domestic approach should be autonomous - and neutral as between all States. It should recognise a tax treaty's dual status - yet be independent of any interpretative principles which are appropriate only in a purely public international, or a purely domestic, context...|$|E

40|$|What is {{the object}} of interpretation? The {{question}} is ambiguous. The object may be either that which falls to be interpreted or the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>interpretation.</b> This article maintains that the central object of constitutional interpretation is the Constitution, which is an intentional lawmaking act rather than a text floating free in the world, and that the point of such interpretation is primarily to understand the meaning that those who made the Constitution intended to convey by promulgating the text in question. I take as my foil Cass Sunstein’s recent argument, in these pages, that there is nothing that interpretation just is. His argument aims to demonstrate that all the familiar, established approaches to constitutional interpretation – originalist and non-originalist alike – are consistent with the idea of interpretation and that judges are free to choose whichever approach they think will have the best consequences in their time and place. I contend, on the contrary, that Sunstein misunderstands the way that intention works in language use in general and that the various alternatives to intentionalism that he outlines each fail. His idea of interpretation is empty and the radical interpretive choice for which he argues is ruled out {{by the nature of the}} Constitution. The final part of the article considers the various ways in which one might understand the Constitution as an object requiring interpretation and outlines the significance that this understanding has for interpretive practice...|$|E
40|$|The {{emergence}} of practice-led research within the academy has brought into focus {{a problem of}} knowledge. While epistemological issues are always under consideration in research communities, what constitutes knowledge is, for the most part, rather narrowly conceived, and still typically relies {{on a kind of}} theological structure: that there exists what is knowable, and worth knowing; that there exists what is testable and worth testing; and that there exists something that accords with "the truth". Practice-led research - research conducted by creative practitioners as part of their practice - starts from a different position, and builds in a different manner. It approaches research, and the interpretation of findings, in an agnostic rather than theological manner. 1 That is, practitioners focus on exploration and accident rather than on hypotheses and pre-negotiated approaches, and typically use an interpretive process, concerned with relatively informal problem-solving, and with intuitive leaps, rules of thumb and educated guesses. Such research is less concerned with interpreting "hard" evidence, and more concerned with exploring an issue or situation. It relies on the phenomenological and the concrete, operationalizing what Paul Carter (2004) characterizes as material rather than abstract thinking. But at the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>interpretation,</b> it is often caught between competing imperatives: to produce knowledge according to a "theological" standard, or to remain open to ambiguities and uncertainties; that is, to undertake empirical or logical analysis, or to follow Keats' notion of Negative Capability. We discuss this with reference to how creative writers undertake and interpret their research in their work, discussing the similarities and differences between writing and other art forms in the academy.

Therefore, {{it is important}} for companies to focus efforts on providing information users with the best possible quality of information to ensure that knowledge can perform tasks efficiently and effectively. The first task {{of this study was to}} figure out if the case division had any information quality problems; this was because our case division did not know if they had any information quality problems and thereby asked the researchers to start from a blank page. Therefore, the focus of this research was to investigate the level of infor-mation quality management implementation as well as knowledge workers’ perception re-garding information product within the company. By using the characteristics of IQMM the researchers were able to find implications and indicators for information quality man-agement at AGA Specialty Gas division. The researchers decided that the nature of the problem was to investigate the current situation within our case company. An inductive approach was the best solution with a philosophical stand <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>interpretation</b> to tackle the problem.

40|$|The {{subject matter}} of this {{dissertation}} is the it-cleft construction, exemplified in (1) 1. It was Mary who drank all the vodka. It-clefts have attracted the long-standing interest of researchers {{in a number of}} linguistic subfields for the reason that this is a construction within which converge a variety of phenomena touching on issues central to linguistic theory. This work addresses several of these issues, including the construction of copular sentences, the properties of the left periphery and their relevance to the grammar of wh -movement, the interaction of syntax, semantics, and information structure, and the linguistic sources of connectivity and reconstruction effects. The core predicational structure of the it-cleft is identified as a small clause containing an atypical predicate - a CP λ-abstract - and this has repercussions in several domains. Among these is the availability of two derivational options: the clefted constituent may be first merged either within or above the subordinate clause. Each derivation places a set of demands on the syntactic system and therefore, although both of these derivations are attested in the Germanic languages, some languages are restricted to one or the other option due to language-specific syntactic constraints. This cross-linguistic variation in the structure of it-clefts provides a means of isolating morphosyntactic connectivity from interpretive reconstruction effects. A comparison of German it-clefts with the structurally distinct it-clefts of Norwegian reveals that, contrary to expectation, variation in structure is not reflected in variation for the availability of reconstruction effects. On the basis of these data, the analysis argues that it-clefts having distinct syntactic structures are semantically identical at the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>interpretation.</b> Differences in structure, however, will require that each language make use of distinct syntactic and semantic operations in reaching this ultimate semantic uniformity...|$|E

Mixed methods are increasingly {{used in the}} fields of evaluation, health sciences, and education {{in order to meet the}} diverse information needs of funders and stakeholders. However, a consensus has yet to develop on the theoretical underpinnings of the methodology. A side-by-side assessment of two competing theoretical approaches to mixed methods, the dialectic and pragmatic, can assist researchers to optimize their use of mixed methods methodology and contribute to the growth of mixed methods theory. This study empirically compares the dialectic and pragmatic approaches to mixed methods and probes key issues underlying the methodology, including unique yield from mixed method studies, the importance of paradigmatic divergence between methods, and the financial demands of mixed method studies. A secondary analysis of a real-world evaluation, this study explores five research questions regarding the convergence, divergence and uniqueness of single method findings; the extent to which mixed methods produce unique findings over and above single methods presented side-by-side; the extent to which studies meet key criteria for validity; stakeholders' perceptions of the utility and credibility of the studies; and the cost of single methods. The pragmatic mixed method study was developed by integrating a post-positivistic telephone survey with weakly interpretive focus groups at the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>interpretation</b> using pragmatic criteria. The dialectic study mixed the same post-positivistic telephone survey with strongly interpretive phenomenological interviews using a Hegelian-inspired dialectic format. All three single methods were examined by a method expert in the field who affirmed the methodologies used. Findings suggest that both mixed method approaches produced unique conclusions that would not have been available by presenting single methods side-by-side. However, the dialectic method produced more complex convergence and more divergence, leading it to be more generative than the pragmatic method. The use of stronger as compared to weaker interpretive methods contributed to the generative quality of the dialectic approach. Overall, the dialectic method appears more suitable to exploring more complex phenomenon as compared to the pragmatic approach. However, these conclusions are drawn from one study of one real-world evaluation. Much more scholarship is needed to explore the issues raised here...|$|E
40|$|The {{description}} of the spatial entities used in space syntax is growingly taking on a direct cognitive character,where for example axial lines are often equated to ‘lines of movement’, convex spaces to ‘spaces of being’,and isovists to ‘visual fields’. While developments of these have served to deepen our understanding of spatial configuration in many ways, it is of importance to revisit {{the origins of the}} spatial entities used toinvestigate spatial syntactics and study the implications of alternate definitions. This is a question of whatkind of analysis can be performed and on what sort of objects, but also of positioning of the research field. This paper argues that while the perceiving subject is one valid <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>interpretation</b> of the spatial entitiesstudied syntactically, other interpretations enable other questions to be investigated and consequently other results to emerge. In this paper the focus lies on how a de‐centralisation from e. g. subjects’ visual fieldsunearths qualities in the isovist and its consecutive systemization into spatial syntactic relations that risk passby. It furthermore aims to discuss the theory base for analyses of certain phenomena (‘the logic of themannequin’). This discussion revolves around a concept already highlighted in space syntax theory:allocentricy, i. e. the quality of spatial cognition to recognize the situation of ‘elsewhere’, and discusses theimpact of such understanding through systemic operations and through the ‘elsewhere’ of inanimate objects. De enheter som används inom space syntax för att analysera rummet börjar allt oftare beskrivas som perceptuella enheter, såsom att axiallinjer kallas 'linjer som man kan se och gå längs', konvexrum 'rum för varande' och isovister 'synfält'. Medan undersökningar av detta sätt att förstå enheterna har bidragit till vår rumsliga förståelse, är de också begränsande genom hur de knyter all tolkning till det enskilda subjektet - och riskerar därmed också bli missvisande. I det här paperet argumenteras för en annan tolking av enheterna som lösgör sig från subjektet och istället utgår från abstraktion och transformation. Detta genom att kritiskt studera implikationerna av en subjektorienterad tolkning, och hur enheter förändras när de sätts samman till system, för att till sist studera hur relationer mellan objekt kan analyseras förutsatt att idéer som 'synfält' eller 'visuella relationer' inte längre är grundstenen i tolkningen av analysen.

40|$|AbstractModern project {{management}} has developed numerous techniques based on mathematical models {{in order to}} be able to plan the projects’ processes in time, their costs and resources. Even though a significant majority of the users do not know that, there are hypotheses behind every technique. These hypotheses help simplify the problems to such an extent that they can be handled by mathematical tools. In this paper, two mathematical models are examined, compared; then the results are analyzed. The first model is the cost optimization model, which can be applied to determine the optimal direct cost corresponding to a given project duration. With the help of the other model the expected distribution of the project duration is determined, assuming that the distribution of the activity durations is stochastic. Both models are adapted in Precedence Diagramming networks, consequently, PDM/cost and PDM/PERT expressions are used in the paper. A PDM network plan made by the contractor of a construction project is developed further into a PDM/cost and a PDM/PERT model in a case study described in the paper.

A small group of proto-methodists, who later on were influenced by Mormonism and emigrated to Utah, made serious efforts to dominate the public urban spheres: the church, the court room, the harbour and the streets. Their actions were, partly, inspired and legitimized by religious visions and hallucinations but their message included both religious and social reformation. They were charged with accusations of blasphemy, crimen laesae majestatis, disturbing public order and insulting His Majesty's servants, and they eventually ended up with legal sentences. One of the rebels, the shipmaster Tobias Jacobsen, was also accused of being insane and made the object of a thorough psychiatric investigation. The author presents four main <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>interpretation</b> <b>of</b> these events: 1) The events can be analyzed in terms of "systems in conflict", that is as a confrontation between radically different cultural values and symbols, 2) The conflict had rhetorical implications for both groups of participants: the group in revolt and the established public authority, 3) The rhetorical implications include different conceptions of time and history, and 4) As a contribution to the study of cultural history, a close examination of the visionar-ies' rebellious narratives may show the close interaction between speech and action, event and narrative...|$|R

40|$|Phase Space is the {{framework}} {{best suited for}} quantizing superintegrable systems [...] systems with more conserved quantities than degrees of freedom. In this quantization method, the symmetry algebras of the hamiltonian invariants are preserved most naturally, as illustrated on nonlinear σ-models, specifically for Chiral Models and de Sitter N-spheres. Classically, the dynamics of superintegrable models such as these is automatically also described by Nambu Brackets involving the extra symmetry invariants of them. The phase-space quantization worked out then leads to the quantization of the corresponding Nambu Brackets, validating Nambu's original proposal, despite excessive fears of inconsistency which have arisen over the years. This is a pedagogical talk based on hep-th/ 0205063 and hep-th/ 0212267, stressing <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>interpretation</b> and care needed in appreciating the consistency of Quantum Nambu Brackets in phase space. For a parallel discussion in Hilbert space, see T Curtright's contribution in these Proceedings [hep-th 0303088].

40|$|This {{has been}} a good year with a nearly full {{contingent}} of faculty, although we have missed our once and future Chair, Randy Curren. We welcomed two new faculty members, Alison Peterman and Brett Sherman to the department, who are wonderful in every way. All year the philosophy corridor of Lattimore hummed with the buzz of conversation and even laughter. Ralf Meerbote has retired but happily has not disappeared from the hall. His retirement, nevertheless, gave us an occasion for having a conference on Kantian Studies. His former students gave excellent papers and then after serious debates about fine <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>interpretation,</b> we all ate and drank into the night. Alas, we will have a second retirement this year: John, you will be sorely missed. The business of the department went on seamlessly. Undergraduates were well advised by William FitzPatrick and graduate students by Earl Conee. Alyssa Ney once more organized a dynamite colloquium series. The graduate admissions committee (Brad, Alyssa and Alison) did a great job recruiting new students. Th...|$|R
