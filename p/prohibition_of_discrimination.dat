25|$|Some {{discrimination}} protections {{on gender}} identity had existed since 1999. Regulations were introduced for discrimination protections on sexual orientation in employment on 1 December 2003, following {{the adoption of}} an EC Directive in 2000, providing for the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> <b>discrimination</b> in employment {{on the grounds of}} sexual orientation.|$|E

25|$|ACODI {{documented}} 612 {{cases of}} racial discrimination in a single year, emphasising {{that many of these}} did not lead to official complaints because victims fear police retaliation or believe their complaints will be ignored. This belief is not unfounded; in 2005 Beauty Solomon, an African American immigrant working as a prostitute, filed two criminal complaints against Spanish policemen for repeated harassment and physical assault. In spite of eyewitness testimony and medical reports confirming her injuries the Spanish Courts dismissed her claims on the grounds of insufficient evidence. Solomon then took her case to the European Court of Human Rights, who unanimously ruled in her favour that Spain had violated Article 3 (prohibition of inhuman and degrading treatment) and Article 14 (<b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> <b>discrimination)</b> of the European Convention of Human Rights. They also condemned Spain for failing to investigate both Solomon's assault and other racist and sexist acts of violence by police officers.|$|E
40|$|The <b>Prohibition</b> <b>of</b> Racial <b>Discrimination</b> in the Case Law of the European Court of Human Rights The {{subject of}} this thesis is the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> racial <b>discrimination</b> on a {{regional}} scale, which is discussed {{in relation to the}} European Court of Human Rights and its case law. The aim of this work is to present the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> racial <b>discrimination,</b> as embodied in the most important international legal documents {{from the beginning of the}} twentieth century with a special focus on the rules contained in the legal documents of the Council of Europe, and the protection granted by the European Court of Human Rights. Race and ethnicity is seen mainly in terms of the Roma ethnicity, which is obviously not the only one who is in Europe facing the racial discrimination. Given the scope of the thesis it is not possible to address more groups belonging to the above mentioned category. The subject matter is elaborated by methods such as compilation, comparison and partially also analysis. The introductory chapter of the thesis contains general interpretation of equality and non-discrimination with explanations of important terms and concepts.

2500|$|Sexuality {{is rarely}} {{discussed}} openly in contemporary Hindu society, especially in modern India where homosexuality was illegal until {{a brief period}} beginning in 2009, due to colonial British laws. On July 2, 2009 The Delhi High Court in a historic judgement decriminalised homosexuality in India; where the court noted that the existing laws violated fundamental rights to personal liberty (Article 21 of the Indian Constitution) and equality (Article 14) and <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> <b>discrimination</b> (Article 15). Even before this judgement, in India homosexuals were very rarely prosecuted despite {{the existence of such}} laws in the penal code. However, the Supreme Court of India re-affirmed the penal code provision and overturned the Delhi High Court decision, effectively re-instating the legal ban on homosexuality.|$|E
2500|$|In very {{narrowly}} defined situations, an employer {{is permitted to}} discriminate {{on the basis of}} a protected trait where the trait is a bona fide occupational qualification (BFOQ) reasonably necessary to the normal operation of that particular business or enterprise. To prove the bona fide occupational qualifications defense, an employer must prove three elements: a direct relationship between the protected trait and the ability to perform the duties of the job, the BFOQ relates to the [...] "essence" [...] or [...] "central mission of the employer's business", and there is no less-restrictive or reasonable alternative (United Automobile Workers v. Johnson Controls, Inc., [...] 111 S.Ct. 1196). The Bona Fide Occupational Qualification exception is an extremely narrow exception to the general <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> <b>discrimination</b> based on protected traits (Dothard v. Rawlinson, [...] 97 S.Ct. 2720). An employer or customer's preference for an individual of a particular religion is not sufficient to establish a Bona Fide Occupational Qualification (Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Kamehameha School — Bishop Estate, 990 F.2d 458 (9th Cir. 1993)).|$|E

40|$|Introduction:This article {{examines}} the meaning and scope <b>of</b> the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> unfair <b>discrimination</b> against employees contained in s 6 of the Employment Equity Act {{in the light of}} the development of the concept of 'unfair discrimination' from the early 1980 s onwards. In so doing, it ipso facto delineates the content and scope of the defences available to an employer faced with a claim of this nature. Though focusing on direct discrimination, it will suggest that the same fundamental principles are applicable to indirect discrimination. Some conceptual points of departure should be noted. The <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> unfair <b>discrimination</b> by the EEA derives from the basic right to 'equal protection and benefit of the law' contained in s 9 of the Constitution and, more specifically, from the constitutional injunction that '[n]ational legislation must be enacted to prevent or prohibit unfair discrimination'.

2500|$|On December 15, 2014, under a {{memorandum}} issued by Attorney General Eric Holder, the United States Department of Justice (DoJ) took {{a position that}} aligned with the EEOC, namely the prohibition of sex discrimination under Title VII encompassed the <b>prohibition</b> <b>of</b> <b>discrimination</b> based on gender identity or transgender status. DoJ had already stopped opposing claims of discrimination brought by federal transgender employees. In October 2017, Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued a directive that withdrew the Holder memorandum. According to {{a copy of the}} directive reviewed by BuzzFeed News, Sessions stated that Title VII should be narrowly interpreted to cover discrimination between [...] "men and women". [...] Attorney General Session stated as a matter of law, “Title VII does not prohibit discrimination based on gender identity per se.” Devin O'Malley, speaking on behalf of the DoJ, stated [...] "the last administration abandoned that fundamental principle , which necessitated today's action." [...] Sharon McGowan, a lawyer with Lambda Legal who previously served in the Civil Rights division of DoJ, rejected that argument, saying [...] "his memo is not actually a reflection of the law as it is — it's a reflection of what the DOJ wishes the law were" [...] and [...] "The Justice Department is actually getting back in the business of making anti-transgender law in court." ...|$|E
