In {{an exception to the}} no-first-use policy, which his statement reaffirmed, Nixon made a deference for riot-control agents and herbicides. Both were in use in Vietnam and both had been lightning rods for criticism. Nixon promised later memorandums concerning abolition of both types of agents; herbicide use in Vietnam was discontinued in 1970 but riot-control agent use continued.|$|E
25|$|These {{talks were}} {{a result of}} North Korea {{withdrawing}} from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) in 2003. Apparent gains following {{the fourth and fifth}} rounds were reversed by outside events. Five rounds of talks from 2003 to 2007 produced little net progress until the third phase of the fifth round of talks, when North Korea agreed to shut down its nuclear facilities in exchange for fuel aid and steps towards the normalization of relations with the United States and Japan. Responding angrily to the United Nations Security Council's <b>Presidential</b> <b>Statement</b> issued on April 13, 2009 that condemned the North Korean failed satellite launch, the DPRK declared on April 14, 2009 that it would pull out of Six Party Talks and that it would resume its nuclear enrichment program in order to boost its nuclear deterrent.

40|$|In {{order to}} gain a {{perspective}} on the factors which shape presidential rhetoric, {{this article focuses on}} Lyndon Johnson’s public statements about Vietnam during the final 18 months of his presidency. A model of the dynamics of Vietnam decision-making is formulated, and shifts in the "hawkishness " of <b>presidential</b> <b>statements</b> are seen as products of policy evolution. The content of <b>presidential</b> <b>statements</b> is also hypothesized to reflect the nature of the audience being addressed the importance of the statement, and mass media coverage. Analysis of the data (in the form of paragraphs coded from 77 separate presidential addresses) reveals strong support for policy flow and audience as shapers of presidential rhetoric. The intimate connection between the use of language and the exercise of power has long fascinated students of politics and communication. As a result, a massive schol-arly literature now focuses on the rhetoric employed by political decision makers-most commonly, it would seem, on the public statements of American presidents. Many studies have been published which describe the policy priorities expressed and the dramaturgical symbols invoked in presidential addresses (see, e. g., Buss and Hofstetter...|$|R
