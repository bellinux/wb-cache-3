40|$|Beginning in 2000, Japan’s government-owned <b>postal</b> <b>saving</b> system {{experienced}} a rapid outflow of funds {{as a large}} number of 10 -year fixed-rate Postal Saving Certificates (PSCs) that had been purchased during the period of high interest rates in the early 1990 s were maturing. This paper exploits this episode as a natural experiment to investigate the crowding-out effects of a government-owned depository institution on local economies. The panel data of 47 prefectures from 1995 to 2004 show that the prefectures where local funds were heavily invested in the <b>postal</b> <b>saving</b> system in the early 1990 s tended to experience a larger shift of funds into private banks from the <b>postal</b> <b>saving</b> system in the early 2000 s, suggesting that the exogenous maturing of PSCs was in part responsible for the observed shifts in the allocation of local funds. More importantly, the (instrumented) flow of local funds to private banks from the <b>postal</b> <b>saving</b> system has statistically robust and economically important positive effects on local output and on the number of small firms, but not on the number of large firms. These results provide empirical support for the view that a government-owned depository institution has crowding-out effects on local economies and, in particular, on small firms that rely on local banks in direct competitio...|$|R

25|$|As {{his second}} term progressed, Roosevelt moved {{to the left of}} his Republican Party base and called for a series of reforms, most of which failed to pass Congress. Roosevelt's {{influence}} waned as he approached the end of {{his second term}}, as his promise to forego a third term made him a lame duck and his concentration of power provoked a backlash from many Congressmen. He sought a national incorporation law (at a time when all corporations had state charters), called for a federal income tax (despite the Supreme Court's ruling in Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co.), and an inheritance tax. In the area of labor legislation, Roosevelt called for limits on the use of court injunctions against labor unions during strikes; injunctions were a powerful weapon that mostly helped business. He wanted an employee liability law for industrial injuries (pre-empting state laws) and an eight-hour work day for federal employees. In other areas he also sought a <b>postal</b> <b>savings</b> system (to provide competition for local banks), and he asked for campaign reform laws.|$|E

40|$|Corporate {{governance}} {{is now a}} key {{concern in}} China’s banking sector. Its importance {{is related to the}} important policy questions of how to foster economic growth without increasing inflation in an environment where monetary guidance does not function in a conventional manner and there exist few constraints on bank lending. Under such an environment topdown best practice models offer considerable appeal, but their implementation in China’s banking sector suffers from a reform deficit. In this context, this study argues that innovative reforms that draw on existing institutions and expertise such as the reform of the China <b>Postal</b> and <b>Savings</b> Bank and the relaxation of restrictions on foreign banks in the rural sector indicate a unique and policy-driven response to this conundrum. Their advantage is that they provide the state with a ready-made platform to influence economic activity in the rural economy...|$|R

40|$|Despite growing {{double digit}} level of annual {{growth for the}} last one and half decades, the lack of regular {{employment}} and mass prevalence of under employment is still a major factor of persistent rural poverty and vulnerability in India, especially among certain ethnic communities and in rural hinterlands. In 2006, the Government of India implemented the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS) to address the growing rural distress and vulnerabilities. Based on synthesis of research findings and several case studies across the states of India that were presented at the national workshop on MGNREGS organized in Ahmadabad on 10 - 11 December 2013, this policy brief summarizes the key messages and policy level challenges emerge while improvingthe performances of the MGNREGS program. The employment guarantee schemes like MGNREGS have provided meaningful employment {{to the poor and}} vulnerable sections of the society. In many respect, the scheme is successful in bringing marginalized sections and women to mainstream labour force, reducing vulnerability in rural areas, and in integrating a vast section of neglected rural population to formal financial institutions like banks and <b>postal</b> offices <b>saving</b> schemes, especially of rural agricultural labor forces of women and backward communities. The implementation of MGNREGS in areas with higher agricultural wage seems a problem due to better opportunities for labor in other sectors of the economy than the MGNREGS work activities. Therefore, better targeting of the schemes to backward districts and in those rural areas where seasonal unemployment is rampant, and where overall agricultural wage rate is at staggering low level for a long time. Likewise, better convergence of the MGNREGS activities at the community level with the other on-going rural development and livelihood improvement activities will provide better synergy effects of the programs and high impact on the ground in terms of long term livelihood improvement, and long-run sustainability of the program activitie...|$|R
