For each particle size there is a definite degree of. surface coverage below which the particles do not float. A 'flotation domain' is identified which shorvs that both coarse (- 100 pm) and fine (- 10 pm) particles require {{a greater degree of}} surface coverage to initiate flotation than do intermediate (- 40 pm) particles. Water contact angles have been measured on quartz plates and powders which have been methylated (under the same conditions) with trimethylchlorosilane. Both advancing and receding water contact angles measured on quartz plates as a function of degree of surface methylationare in good agreement with the angles predicted by the Cassie equation. Advancing water contact angles measured on quartz particles as a function of degree of surface methylation are also in good agreement with angles predicted by the Cassie equation up to surface coverages of'about 70 %. The angles measured at higher surface coverages are less than those anticipated by the Cassie equation. The flotation behaviour of the particles has been compared with that predicted by existing flotation theories.

Focusing on population of particles containing multi ingredients with porous structure, the general model framework links mixing system power and <b>particle</b> dissolution <b>behaviour</b> by combining convective dissolution equations and computational fluid dynamics simulation. Particle dissolves in a variety way due to many factors for example particle shape and size, pore structure, agitation speed, solvent material and temperature. It is difficult to quantitatively conclude these factors on dissolution. As a result, detailed simulations based on Lattice-Boltzmann method are carried out to investigate factors for instance particle shape, surface {{area to volume ratio}} and pore structure separately. Later on, both experiment and simulation methods have been studied to explore the effects of agitation and particle wetting process. Results show that surface area to volume ratio plays a more important role in terms of particle related properties. Results also indicate that agitation affects dissolution significantly comparing to the other studied factors. The new dissolution model, expressed as a coupled system of numerical and computational issues, is used to predict <b>particle</b> dissolution <b>behaviour</b> in a well mixed system.

Conventional microfiltration involves retention of particles by a porous membrane, but is limited by (irreversible) particle accumulation and concentration polarization that can only be (partially) controlled by back pulsing that transfers particles back into the bulk. Microfluidic separation devices employ a combination of inertial forces and sometimes geometric constraints to control <b>particle</b> migration <b>behaviour,</b> which allows splitting of suspensions into concentrated and diluted streams. Considering their effectiveness, inertia-based microfluidic separation is regarded an interesting alternative to microfiltration; therefore, this paper focusses on the use of inertial forces in suspension separation.

The current Bayer precipitation of gibbsite {{is notoriously}} slow {{and is considered}} to be the rate limiting step of the Bayer process. The present industrial reactor configuration involves precipitating gibbsite inside a series of large stainless steel agitated vessels due to the slow precipitation kinetics of gibbsite from pregnant Bayer liquor. The scope {{of this study is to}} investigate the effectiveness of using water as an antisolvent to increase the overall gibbsite yield and the associated <b>particle</b> <b>behaviours</b> under isothermal conditions. The experiments were performed in a series of batch experiments which were divided into two subsets. Firstly, the effect of different caustic concentrations present in the anti solvent on gibbsite yield was tested. Secondly, the effect of different seed loading (50 and 100 grams seeds per liter of synthetic liquor) on aggregation and fines formation were investigated. All batch experiments were conducted isothermally at 80 °C under a closed system using a baffled stainless steel 316 agitated vessel. The experimental results indicated water to be a feasible medium for the isothermal antisolvent crystallisation of gibbsite from synthetic pregnant Bayer liquor. It was found that the extent of overall gibbsite yield exhibits a power law correlation to the change in the antisolvent caustic concentration with R 2 ～ 1 (R 2 = 0. 99974). This finding is important as the regressed curve will be used to correlate gibbsite yield as a function of anti solvent purity. From the seed loading experiments, an Increase In seed loading under constant temperature and initial liquor supersaturation resulted in an overall decrease in product particle size due to a rise in inter-particulate attrition. However, crystal growth was not dominant during any period of the experiments with aggregation being more prominent for the system with the lower seed load. Gibbsite morphology determination from SEM revealed hexagonal solids which, in the presence of a higher seed loading indicated signs of fracture due to attrition. Quantitative evidence of this mechanism is shown USIng the discretised population balance method by Bramley et al. (1996) with the aid of the computational technique developed by Hounslow (2005) in Mathematica. Results generated using this method show decreasing aggregation with liquor de supersaturation and increased seed loading. The overall <b>particle</b> <b>behaviours</b> from the current investigation are validated by results obtained from previous gibbsite studies under very similar conditions. Although the gibbsite yield can be increased drastically in the presence of an anti solvent, the average particle size generated from this study is still too small to be commercially feasible due to the increase in initial supersaturation. Thus it is recommended that further particle size optimisation may be conducted inside a fluidised bed reactor where particles generally experience lower shear than inside a conventional agitated vessel...|$|R
