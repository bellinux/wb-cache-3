40|$|The {{main goal}} of the thesis was to compare a {{potential}} of rural tourism at two villages in Jindřichohradecko, one {{is located in a}} protected landscape area and the other is outside of this region.

The practical part assesses the potential of Jindřichohradecko for activities of the rural tourism and particularly analyzes in detail the situation in a village Pístina (lying in the PLA) and Zahrádky by using a descriptive case study, which is situated outside of the area with an enhanced <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> the <b>nature.</b> The thesis includes a questionnaire survey, whose results present an opinion of citizens of the villages on the rural tourism in their villages...|$|R

25|$|Early 20th-century European {{efforts to}} lobby internationally for {{environmental}} conservation laws were delayed by World War I, but Belgian biologist Jean Massart reintroduced Paul Sarasin's proposals at the International Union of Biological Sciences (IUBS) in the 1920s. Professor Michel Siedliecki promoted them in Poland {{and helped to}} get the issue onto {{the agenda of the}} IUBS meetings of 1925, 1926, 1927 and 1928. In 1927 Siedliecki, Derscheid and P.-G. Van Tienhoven of The Netherlands created the International Office for the <b>Protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>Nature</b> (Centre international de documentation et de correlation pour la protection de la nature) to implement wildlife conservation plans in Europe. Van Tienhoven was the first president, while Jean-Marie Derscheid was named secretary and managed the office until he resigned in 1933.

25|$|The {{conservation}} measures undertaken in Bhutan {{to preserve and}} conserve the cranes are unique; in fact more and more crane habitat areas are being brought under the protected area concept. The Royal Society for <b>Protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>Nature</b> (RSPN) established in 1987, which has the mandate for conservation and nature education {{has been involved in}} monitoring the winter visitors to the Phobjika valley and other habitats such as Bomdeling Valley. According to recorded information, 141 cranes visit Bomdeling valley (Phobjika reports a count of about 400 now) every year. RSPN has a Visitor Centre at the Phobjikha Valley, which provides information on cranes and the environment of the valley. The information Centre is a very modern decagonal building, next to a stream, with high-tech equipment. There is an observatory for birdwatchers, a mini theatre with mural painting with narration. The center staff provides services such as narration, facilitation and presentation of the valley and cranes in Bhutan. The Society has also produced a documentary (1989 : On the wings of prayer and 2014: Heavenly Bird with A german TV comapny) film on the cranes visiting Bhutan every year. Further, in Phubjika the Observation Towers have been so located that they cause the least disturbance to the crane habitats. Tourists are allowed to observe the cranes through the two or three high tech “spotting telescopes’’ and spotted on the watch the behaviour of the crane as described in the RSPN pamphlet titled “Field Guide to Crane Behaviour”, from a safe distance under the strict supervision of forest officials. Farmers are also advised to replace the barbed wire fencing with wooden and stone fencing to reduce harm to the cranes. Collisions with powerlines cause mortality to many crane species and when electricity was to be provided to the valley, the power cables were laid underground to avoid any mortality. The work was taken up during summer when the birds do not use the area.|$|E

2500|$|... ″Conservation and {{preservation}} are closely linked and may indeed seem {{to mean the}} same thing. Both terms involve a degree of protection, but how that protection is carried out is the key difference.

2500|$|In 1989, Fulufjället {{appeared}} in Naturvårdsverket's {{plan for the}} creation of new national parks. Negotiation with local authorities began the following year, but the project met opposition from the local population. One of the arguments in favor of the creation of the park, beyond the simple <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature,</b> was that it would draw more tourists, especially foreigners; this was particularly important since while Idre and Sälen had succeeded in developing winter tourism, Särna had not. The project's opponents retorted that there was no reason that European tourists should choose to visit this distant mountain over the Alpes. Besides that, the national park would necessitate a certain number of restrictions on the locals such as banning of snowmobile use, hunting, and fishing. The council of administration of Älvdalen Municipality heard the locals' negative opinion, and so opposed itself {{to the creation of the}} park. Naturvårdsverket and Dalarna County thus changed their strategy, and surveyed the locals to learn how they thought the mountain ought to be used. Discussions continued following the publication of this study, and in 1999, the locals began to express favorable opinions. The park was no longer seen as a set of restrictions, but as an opportunity for the municipality. This led to the creation of the park in 2002. The official motive {{for the creation of}} the park was [...] "to preserve an area of the central mountains with a distinctive vegetation and a great natural richness in a relatively intact state". It was the first Swedish national park established in the mountains since Padjelanta in 1962. The official inauguration was held 17 September 2002, in the presence of the king Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden. The park is also part of the Natura 2000 Network since 1995 and is classified a Special Protection Area for the preservation of birds since 1996. The park became one of the first parks of the European network of PAN Parks, created by the WWF to reconcile the <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> and tourism.|$|E
