5|$|Wilson {{ran into}} trouble with Lawrence's harsh {{frugality}} while working on his cyclotron and was fired twice from the Radiation Laboratory. The first time was for losing a rubber seal in the 37-inch cyclotron which prevented its use in a demonstration to a potential donor. He was later rehired at Luis Alvarez's urging, but melted an expensive <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>pliers</b> while welding, and was fired again. Though offered his job back, he decided instead to go to Princeton University to work with Henry DeWolf Smyth.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the game}} was never completed, {{only a small portion}} of the {{intended}} gameplay exists. During the playable segment, Mustafa, through conversations with other detainees, discovers that another detainee is planning an escape but needs a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>pliers</b> to make the attempt. Mustafa must join a work detail to gain access to the pliers, hide the pliers in a garbage can to prevent them from being found during a search, recover them at night (which requires Mustafa to find a way to pry open the area that the garbage cans are stored in), and deliver them to the other detainee. The playable section ends when Mustafa delivers the pliers. Other interactions during the playable section include speaking with a detainee who, after complaining that a guard threw her copy of the Quran to the ground, mentions the existence of a partially built tunnel from a previous escape attempt.|$|E
5|$|During a cold open scene, Ron (Nick Offerman) horrifies {{the entire}} parks {{department}} by apparently pulling an aching tooth {{out of his}} own mouth with a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>pliers.</b> He later admits it was a prank, as a dentist had removed the tooth the previous day. Later, Andy (Chris Pratt) and April (Aubrey Plaza) invite everyone to a dinner party at the home of Andy's band-mate Burly (Andrew Burlinson), where Andy is living. Ben (Adam Scott) tells Leslie (Amy Poehler) that his boss in Indianapolis wants him back on the road, but he has also been offered a job to work under Chris (Rob Lowe) in Pawnee. Although Leslie wants Ben to stay, she is hesitant to say so outright, disappointing him and leaving him conflicted over which job to take.|$|E
5000|$|I {{was much}} more skeptical about such claims until one day I {{personally}} folded {{the bowl of a}} large, heavy soup spoonin half with a gentle touch, and with half a dozen witnesses present.

I couldn't budge the bowl without the assistance <b>of</b> two <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> <b>pliers</b> and some serious leverage. Dean Radin ...|$|R

They also allege the Tomkins tied Bartman to a tree and forced him to watch as they threatened to cut off Boland's toes with a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>pliers</b> and beat them both with sticks.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of manual systems, the grip resembles a very large <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>pliers,</b> and {{considerable}} strength and skill are required to operate the car. As many early cable car operators discovered the hard way, if the grip is not applied properly, it can damage the cable, or even worse, become entangled in the cable. In the latter case, the cable car {{may not be able}} to stop and can wreak havoc along its route until the cable house realizes the mishap and halts the cable.|$|E
25|$|Following the IRA {{killing of}} a Royal Irish Constabulary {{sergeant}} outside Bandon church in July 1920, Percival captured Tom Hales, commander of the IRA's West Cork Brigade, and Patrick Harte, the brigade's quartermaster, {{for which he was}} appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE). Both prisoners later claimed to have been repeatedly beaten and tortured while in custody. Hales alleged that a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>pliers</b> had been used on his lower body and to extract his fingernails. Harte suffered brain injury and died in a mental hospital in 1925. The claims of torture were denied by Percival and his colleagues, Hales being unable to produce any visible wounds beyond missing teeth and Harte's head injury being officially recorded as the result of being rifle-butted upon arrest. Ormonde Winter, the head of British Intelligence in Dublin Castle, later named Hales as an informer who had invented the story as an excuse for providing the names of his fellow IRA members in return for a lesser sentence.|$|E

50|$|To make a hook barbless, the barb {{is simply}} crushed flat with a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> needle-nosed <b>pliers,</b> a trivial task. Medium grit {{sandpaper}} {{can be further}} used to ensure complete removal of the barb, {{but this is not}} necessary and is rarely done.|$|R
50|$|Circlips are {{designed}} to be removed with special circlip plier which can be reassembled for internal or external clips, but in field expedient situations, a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> needle-nose <b>pliers</b> (for internal clips) or leverage with a flat-headed screwdriver (internal or external) is sometimes used.|$|R

According to Gaga, she imagined [...] "a downtown, bad-ass kid walking down the street with his buddies, grabbing a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>pliers,</b> and making a pair of sunglasses out of a fence on the street". She wore them on the opening shot of the music video along with a chain link hood garment, saying that [...] "they look so hard.

500|$|Research by rock {{historian}} Bob Egan {{suggests the}} location of the cover photo was at 375 West Street, at the extreme west of Greenwich Village. The original inside gatefold featured nine black-and-white photos, all taken by Schatzberg and selected for the sleeve by Dylan himself. A shot of actress Claudia Cardinale from Schatzberg's portfolio was included but later withdrawn because it had been used without her authorization and Cardinale's representatives threatened to sue, making the original record sleeve a collector's item. Dylan included a self-portrait by Schatzberg as a credit to the photographer. The photos, for Gill, added up to [...] "a shadowy glimpse of [...] life, including an enigmatic posed shot of Dylan holding a small portrait of a woman {{in one hand and a}} <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>pliers</b> in the other: they all contributed to the album's air of reclusive yet sybaritic genius." ...|$|E

50|$|A {{disgorger}} {{is used in}} coarse fishing {{to remove}} a fish hook from deep inside {{the mouth of a}} fish that is not possible to reach using fingers alone. It is also known as the Unhooker or Hook remover. It is typically made of plastic or metal and is used on smaller fish. Larger fish that are hooked deep inside the mouth can be unhooked using a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> forceps or a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> long-nose <b>pliers.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Australian bass {{fishermen}} {{almost exclusively}} practice catch and release, which {{is necessary for}} the preservation of wild Australian bass stocks. [...] The use of barbless hooks (which can be created by crushing the barbs flat with a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> needle-nosed <b>pliers)</b> is essential as Australian bass hit lures with great ferocity and are consequently almost impossible to unhook on barbed hooks. [...] Conversely, Australian bass are swiftly and easily released if barbless hooks are used.|$|R
2500|$|Multi-tool knives {{formerly}} {{consisted of}} {{variations on the}} American camper style or the Swiss Army knives manufactured by Victorinox and Wenger, however, {{the concept of a}} multitool knife has undergone a revolution thanks in part to an avalanche of new styles, sizes, and tool presentation concepts. [...] These new varieties often incorporate a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>pliers</b> and other tools in conjunction with one or more knife blade styles, either locking or nonlocking.|$|E
2500|$|Bassoon reeds, made of Arundo donax cane, {{are often}} {{made by the}} players themselves, {{although}} beginner bassoonists tend to buy their reeds from professional reed makers or use reeds made by their teachers. Reeds begin with a length of tube cane that is split into three or four pieces using a tool called a cane splitter. The cane is then trimmed and gouged to the desired thickness, leaving the bark attached. After soaking, the gouged cane is cut to the proper shape and milled to the desired thickness, or profiled, by removing material from the bark side. This {{can be done by}} hand with a file; more frequently it is done with a machine or tool designed for the purpose. After the profiled cane has soaked once again it is folded over in the middle. Prior to soaking, the reed maker will have lightly scored the bark with parallel lines with a knife; this ensures that the cane will assume a cylindrical shape during the forming stage. On the bark portion, the reed maker binds on one, two, or three coils or loops of brass wire to aid in the final forming process. The exact placement of these loops can vary somewhat depending on the reed maker. The bound reed blank is then wrapped with thick cotton or linen thread to protect it, and a conical steel mandrel (which sometimes has been heated in a flame) is quickly inserted in between the blades. Using a special <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>pliers,</b> the reed maker presses down the cane, making it conform to the shape of the mandrel. (The steam generated by the heated mandrel causes the cane to permanently assume the shape of the mandrel.) The upper portion of the cavity thus created is called the [...] "throat," [...] and its shape has an influence on the final playing characteristics of the reed. The lower, mostly cylindrical portion will be reamed out with a special tool called a reamer, allowing the reed to fit on the bocal.|$|E

50|$|Crocodile Dentist {{went through}} several changes during its {{development}} phase. Fuhrer and his technicians {{were told to}} tweak the length and speed of the crocodile's lunging motion so that the toy would not cause eye injuries. Fuhrer also added a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> plastic <b>pliers</b> to quell fears that children would hurt their fingers. However, the game testers later thought that the toy lacked excitement, and though the pliers remained in the final product, Fuhrer restored the original lunging motion.|$|R

He had some wire, and a little <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>pliers</b> for bending it in all shapes, and a hammer and little nails. He had also a paint-box and brushes, and paper of various colors, for lining boxes, and making portfolios and pocket-books; and he had varnishes, red, green, blue, and black. All these he kept in his drawers and shelves, and made a great many ingenious things with them.|$|E

50|$|Klein Tools {{was founded}} in 1857 in Chicago, Illinois by German {{immigrant}} Mathias Klein. The first tool Klein made was a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> side-cutting <b>pliers</b> for a telegraph lineman. The company grew as the telegraph and eventually telephone and electrical industries grew after the Civil War by adding 100 types <b>of</b> <b>pliers</b> in the 1910s. From the 1960s-1980s, the company expanded their product line to include leather and canvas products, occupational safety equipment, hex key wrenches, screwdrivers, nut drivers, as well as electrical terminals and connectors. Along the way, Klein acquired the R.H. Buhrke Company of Fort Smith, Arkansas in 1968 and the Vaco Products Company of Jonesville, Michigan in 1986. Also in the mid 1980s, the company started manufacturing adjustable wrenches in the US, which they had previously been purchasing from a Japanese supplier.|$|R
50|$|Lock {{snapping}} is {{a method}} of forced entry that only affects certain types of cylinder lock, such as the euro cylinder which are commonly found on uPVC doors in Europe. Lock snapping involves applying a strong torque force to the lock cylinder, usually with a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> locking <b>pliers,</b> thereby breaking the mechanism and allowing access to the latch. It can take between 50 seconds and 2 minutes to snap the lock and gain entry. Police in the UK have estimated that around 22 million doors throughout the country could be at risk from lock snapping.|$|R

50|$|Before the flight, Denver and the {{mechanic}} {{had attempted to}} extend {{the reach of the}} handle, using a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> Vise-Grip <b>pliers.</b> However, this did not solve the problem, and the pilot still could not reach the handle while strapped into his seat. NTSB investigators' post-accident investigation showed that because of the positioning of the fuel selector valves, switching fuel tanks required the pilot to turn his body 90 degrees to reach the valve. This created a natural tendency to extend one's right foot against the right rudder pedal to support oneself while turning in the seat, which caused the aircraft to yaw (Nose right) and pitch up.|$|R
50|$|Venustodus is an extinct genus of eugeneodontid holocephalid {{from the}} Carboniferous of the Komi Republic of Russia, and in {{similarly}} aged strata in the United States The generic name is from Ancient Greek, meaning Tooth of Venus. The genus {{is believed to}} be of cosmopolitan distribution due to the discovery of specimens across two continents within the same period. The individual teeth are heterodontal, measuring between 8-9mm (0.3 inches), with unusual curvature familiar among members of Eugeneodontida, growing in the shape reminiscent <b>of</b> a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> Locking <b>pliers,</b> hundreds <b>of</b> teeth continuing to grow and cause pre-existing teeth to protrude outwards. Teeth that were recovered from Warsaw, Illinois showed signs of wear due to crushing hard-shelled invertebrates and mollusks, leading to the conclusion that it is durophagous.|$|R
50|$|Lee Smart {{was born}} in 1940 in Washington State and lived 17 years before being sentenced to thirty years {{confinement}} to the Montana State Prison for the second-degree murder of traveling salesman Charles Ward outside of Browning, Montana on 28 April 1956. Smart had bludgeoned Ward {{to death with a}} <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> lineman's <b>pliers</b> and robbed him of $100 cash. Smart was almost 6 ft. tall and weighed 147 pounds, wore a ducktail haircut, a black leather jacket, and had tattooed arms and chest. He and a friend had escaped from a reformatory camp in Cedar Creek, Washington, on 14 April 1956. The two then went on a two-week criminal binge which ended in Great Falls, Montana. Lee Smart left his friend in Great Falls and went north, where he ended up killing Ward.|$|R
