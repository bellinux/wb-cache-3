40|$|A Capstone Project {{submitted}} to the Graduate Faculty of the California State University ??? Maritime Academy in partial fulfillment of {{the requirements of the}} degree of Master of Science in Transportation and Engineering Management with a specialization in TransportationTechnology is being incorporated into all phases of maritime port and ship operations and management. Maritime piloting, the business of navigating ships safely within port confines, is an area where opportunity remains to utilize technology to develop more robust navigation safety systems. One often-discussed approach would be to use technology to enable shore-based pilots to provide navigation assistance to vessels. Certain European <b>pilotage</b> <b>authorities</b> have instituted limited shore-based piloting programs. But, those systems rely on older, less accurate radar based input, and have not been updated to take advantage of newer navigation and communication technologies. Moreover, the industry in general has resisted any move toward shore-based pilotage, citing their belief that the traditional system with a pilot physically on board the vessel will always be safer. This paper explores ways that emerging navigation and communication technologies might be applied to the business of piloting ships with a goal of increasing marine safety and efficiency. The objective {{of this paper is to}} spark discussion aimed at moving this issue forward by asking: ???What might be possible???...|$|R
50|$|The port is a {{compulsory}} pilotage area. Pilotage {{is provided by}} the Great Lakes <b>Pilotage</b> <b>Authority,</b> a Crown corporation of the Government of Canada which includes responsibility for pilotage on the Hudson Bay coast of the provinces of Ontario and Manitoba. Pilotage charges between July 20 and October 31 follow a published schedule; outside these dates charges are based on cost recovery.|$|E
50|$|The Atlantic <b>Pilotage</b> <b>Authority</b> Canada is a Crown {{corporation}} of the Government of Canada, {{which was}} established As a result of recommendations made by the Royal Commission on Pilotage in Canada, by the Pilotage Act, Section 18, on February 1, 1972 mandated to assist in pilotage in all Canadian waters {{in and around the}} provinces of New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador.|$|E
50|$|The {{principal}} harbour of the Isles of Scilly (known as St Mary's Harbour) {{is located}} on the northern edge of the town, naturally formed by the bay at Town Beach (itself part of a larger bay named St Mary's Pool) and improved by the construction of a quay on its western side, which acts also as a breakwater. The quay is the terminal of the ferry to Penzance, currently the Scillonian III, and the cargo vessel Gry Maritha; both vessels have St Mary's as their port of registry. The Duchy of Cornwall is the owner and the harbour authority (the St Mary’s Harbour and <b>Pilotage</b> <b>Authority).</b>|$|E
5000|$|It {{was first}} sighted on 30 January 1820 by Edward Bransfield, Master, Royal Navy, {{immediately}} after his charting {{of the newly}} discovered South Shetland Islands nearby. In the century following the peninsula's discovery, chartmakers used various names (Trinity Land, Palmer Land, and Land of Louis Philippe) for this portion of it, each name having some historical merit. The recommended name derives from [...] "Trinity Land", given by Bransfield during 1820 in likely recognition of the Corporation of Trinity House, Britain's historical maritime <b>pilotage</b> <b>authority,</b> although the precise application by him has not been identified with certainty and {{is a matter of}} different interpretation by Antarctic historians.|$|E
50|$|Emlyn-Jones had {{a private}} {{education}} in Cardiff, France, Spain and Italy before making his {{reputation in the}} shipping industry. In 1911 he went into partnership with E. Williams as shipowners. In 1915 he started on his own with a fleet of small coasting steamers using the experience he had gained while working in a shipping office in Bordeaux. In 1920 he founded the Dragon Steam Ship Company to operate deep sea tramping routes. The affairs of his own enterprises took him {{all over the world}} on business and he was also a director of the Green Star Shipping Co, the Ocean Salvage and Towage Co and one time Chairman of the Cardiff <b>Pilotage</b> <b>Authority.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Surplus to requirements, Squirrel {{was sold}} on 16 November 1921 to the Sunderland <b>Pilotage</b> <b>Authority</b> for {{conversion}} {{to the pilot}} tender Vedra. Registered in 1923 at Sunderland with Official Number 146924, she was measured as 158 GRT and 52 NRT. [...] In the mid-1930s several {{attempts were made to}} sell Vedra, and in 1936 Thomas Young & Sons (Shipbreakers) Ltd purchased her for local demolition. [...] However, she was resold to Captain Vernon Sewell for use during the making of the Michael Powell film The Edge of the World in Scotland during 1937. [...] Thereafter Vedra was sold to foreign owners and renamed, but again became a British ship in 1938 as the yacht Sea-Serpent, registered at Famagusta, Cyprus, then a British colony. Sea-Serpent was reported sunk on 22 April 1941 by German aircraft between Syros and Souda.|$|E
5000|$|On October 13, 2016 {{just after}} 1 a.m a Texas-owned {{articulated}} tug/barge—a 28-metre tugboat, the Nathan E Stewart, secured to {{the stern of}} an empty 90-metre petroleum barge DBL 55—ran hard aground on the Edge Reef off Athlone Island {{at the entrance to}} Seaforth Channel in the Heiltsuk Nation's traditional territorial waters. contaminating the Seaforth Channel area with [...] "more than 100,000 litres of fuel." [...] The Nathan E Stewart held approximately 200,000 litres of industrial oils including diesel. Although the Seaforth Channel is part of the Voluntary Tanker Exclusion Zone, the Nathan E. Stewart which is a U.S. vessel under 10,000 gross tonnage was allowed to operate by the Pacific <b>Pilotage</b> <b>Authority,</b> [...] "without a local pilot on the West Coast of Canada." [...] This is a common practice [...] "if the crew meets a minimum standard of experience and licensing." [...] None of the seven-member crew of the Nathan E Stewart were injured. The fuel spill was about 20 kilometres west of Bella Bella, the core community of the Heiltsuk Nation. The fuel spill threatens [...] "dozens of species that are harvested in the area, including manila clam beds that provide income of up to $150,000 per year for the community." [...] A shellfish harvesting ban was imposed on October 14. The fuel spill is in the environmentally sensitive Great Bear Rainforest - the largest intact old-growth forest in the world. The operator responsible for the tug and barge are Kirby Offshore Marine, a Texas-based operator. In 2011 when the Nathan E Stewart lost power and was set adrift in rough waters of Alaska, journalists at the time drew attention to the Pacific <b>Pilotage</b> <b>Authority</b> waiver that exempted the barge which makes routine weekly runs [...] "between Vancouver and Alaska through the Inside Passage" [...] "from the requirement of having Canadian pilots on board." [...] Following the October incident, the Pacific <b>Pilotage</b> <b>Authority</b> revoked the barge's waiver. The Canadian Coast Guard who were leading the cleanup, arrived on scene at 2:19 a.m. at CCG Station Bella Bella. They called in the Western Canada Marine Response Corporation (WCMRC) at 4:30 am and their vessels and crew from Vancouver and Prince Rupert arrived on site at 5:30 pm. A [...] "mobile skimming vessel, boom skiff, work boat, and tug, along with a total of 2,500 feet of boom" [...] were on site. The tugboat [...] "settled under nine metres of water in Seaforth Channel." [...] By October 26 the tanks of fuel on the submerged tug had been pumped out and [...] "110,131 litres of an oil-water mixture" [...] were recovered but oil was discovered in at [...] "least three coves in Seaforth Channel." [...] Bad weather prevented the salvage operation. Resolve Pioneer, a salvage vessel arrived in Bella Bella on November 8. and the damaged Nathan E. Stewart was raised from the sea floor on November 14. It was hauled to Surrey, B.C. on November 19 but cleanup continued. The Heiltsuk, B.C. Premier Christy Clark and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau criticized the oil spill response as [...] "inadequate" [...] and [...] "unacceptable." [...] The incident highlighted concerns about lack of capacity of existing response teams as on the eve of proposed pipelines which would lead to even more tanker traffic on the Inside Passage. On November 6 in Bella Bella Federal Minister of Transportation Marc Garneau met briefly with Heiltsuk hereditary and elected chiefs and on November 7 in Vancouver Prime Minister Trudeau announced a $1.5B ocean protection plan which will [...] "creating a marine safety system, restoring marine ecosystems and research into oil spill cleanup methods." ...|$|E
5000|$|The Corporation of Trinity House of Deptford Strond, {{known as}} Trinity House (formally The Master Wardens and Assistants of the Guild Fraternity or Brotherhood {{of the most}} glorious and {{undivided}} Trinity and of St. Clement in the Parish of Deptford Strond in the County of Kent), is a private corporation governed under a Royal Charter (rather than a non-departmental public body). It has three core functions: it is the official General Lighthouse Authority for England, Wales, the Channel Islands and Gibraltar, responsible for the provision and maintenance of navigational aids, such as lighthouses, lightvessels, buoys, and maritime radio/satellite communication systems. Trinity House is also an official deep sea <b>pilotage</b> <b>authority,</b> providing expert navigators for ships trading in Northern European waters. It is also a maritime charity, dispersing funds {{for the welfare of}} retired seamen, the training of young cadets and the promotion of safety at sea; for the financial year ending in March 2013 it spent approximately £6.5 million in furtherance of its charitable objectives. Funding for the work of the lighthouse service comes from [...] "light dues" [...] levied on commercial vessels calling at ports in the British Isles, based on the net registered tonnage of the vessel. The rate is set by the Department of Transport, and annually reviewed. Funding for the maritime charity is generated separately. After the corporation was founded in 1514, the first master was Thomas Spert (later Sir), sailing master of Henry VIII's flagship Mary Rose and of Henry Grace à Dieu.|$|E
40|$|Marine {{pilotage}} in {{the coastal}} waters of British Columbia, Canada is mandatory. The Pacific <b>Pilotage</b> <b>Authority</b> Canada (PPA) provides marine pilotage services on a coast-wide basis. The coast-wide model of marine pilotage services offers much flexibility to the users of the service; however, it {{has its share of}} operational challenges: inter alia pilot transportation logistics, increasing training and transportation costs, lower responsiveness to local port requirements and a diminishing pool of qualified mariners with coast-wide navigation knowledge and experience. To address the above-mentioned challenges holistically, this analysis recommends that the PPA provide a combination of coastal and port-based pilotage services in areas of high demand and where financially feasible...|$|E
