Land redistribution was meant to achieve equal land area per household and improve agricultural <b>performance.</b> <b>Sale</b> of land and hiring of agricultural labour were prohibited and there were fears that livestock would be nationalized. Following the ousting of the military regime in 1991, {{there has been a}} reduction of the imperfections in rural factor markets. Results from a field survey in the central Ethiopian highlands indicate that selling, hiring, renting, and exchanging of agricultural land, farm labor; and animal traction are increasing. These changes will influence agricultural production in many ways, particularly if reform with respect to rural factor markets is encouraged and accorded appropriate policy support...|$|E

40|$|Abstract__ Many {{organizations}} worldwide use personality {{measures to}} select applicants for sales jobs or to assess incumbent sales employees. In the present dissertation, consisting of four independent studies, five approaches {{to strengthen the}} personality-sales performance linkage were studied. This dissertation shows that personality {{can be used to}} predict <b>sales</b> <b>performance.</b> Although different meta-analyses in the past 20 years have reported that Conscientiousness and Extraversion are predictors of <b>sales</b> <b>performance,</b> in two independent samples of the dissertation was found that Openness predicted <b>sales</b> <b>performance.</b> Possibly, being open and interested in new things is related to finding new customers. Findings further show that using a GFP score may be useful for selecting sales employees. If one wants to select personnel for rather specific and more restricted tasks, such as dealing with customers or doing administrative work, then the use of more narrow measures may be better. In order to ensure optimal predictive validity, both in practice and in research, it is important to clearly specify the <b>sales</b> <b>performance</b> criterion before the optimal personality predictor is selected. The results of the dissertation further assert the importance of emotion regulation for high emotional labor sales jobs. Also, when predicting <b>sales</b> <b>performance,</b> other-ratings of personality may be an alternative to self-ratings. Finally, adding a sales Frame-Of-Reference to a personality measure may have the potential to improve the predictive validity for <b>sales</b> <b>performance.</b> To further optimize the prediction of <b>sales</b> <b>performance</b> with personality measures, we suggest more focus on the nature of <b>sales</b> <b>performance</b> criteria...|$|R

A longitudinal study examines the organization's implementation of a customer service intervention which utilized new service standards and customer feedback mechanisms. Moreover, the chain provided a natural experiment, since the forty-six stores in this chain represented three levels of facility design ranging from the traditional supermarket to the extended "store of the future" format. A theoretical model relating the customer service intervention, variations in store design, and customer satisfaction to <b>sales</b> <b>performance</b> was developed. Using both operational performance data from each of the stores and 1, 537 responses from customer satisfaction surveys, a LISREL model was used to test the predictive fit of the model. The results indicate that both the store design and the customer service intervention had a significant, positive impact on customer satisfaction which, in turn, significantly affected <b>sales</b> <b>performance</b> (<b>sales</b> per labor hour). In addition, the customer service intervention had a direct effect on <b>sales</b> <b>performance,</b> although there was no support for a direct relationship between store design and <b>sales</b> <b>performance.</b> This research provides a theoretical basis in helping management understand how to leverage customer service for improved <b>sales</b> <b>performance.</b> service quality, customer satisfaction, customer service intervention, service standards, facility design service productivity...|$|R
