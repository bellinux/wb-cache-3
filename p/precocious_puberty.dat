Using our own data from the assessment of MRI scans in healthy young females and data extracted from four studies that assessed uterine volume using transabdominal ultrasound in healthy females we have derived and validated a normative model of uterine volume from birth to age 40 years. This shows that uterine volume increases across childhood, with a faster increase in adolescence reflecting the influence of puberty, followed by a slow but progressive rise during adult life. The model suggests that around 84 % of the variation in uterine volumes in the healthy population up to age 40 is due to age alone. The derivation of a validated normative model for uterine volume from birth to age 40 years has important clinical applications by providing age-related reference values for uterine volume.

40|$|Poster presentado en el 17 th International Congress of Comparative Endocrinology celebrado en Barcelona del 15 al 19 de julio de 2013 Puberty {{comprises}} the developmental period {{that leads to}} the first successful reproduction. In female European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) puberty occurs {{at the end of the}} third year of life, although intensive rearing results in a high percentage of precocious maturation one year earlier. This study is aimed at the characterization of the onset of <b>puberty</b> in <b>precocious</b> sea bass females through a hemigonadectomy approach. This methodology allows the study of early events occurring in the ovaries prior to the appearance of any histological changes induced by the onset of puberty. With this purpose, by the time puberty was about to start (September) the left ovary of a group of fish was removed by precise surgery. These ovaries were frozen and kept for further gene expression analysis. After completion of gonadal maturation (February), histological observation of the developmental stage achieved by the remaining ovaries was used to classify the fish into precocious or non-precocious. Moreover, the plasma profiles of different reproductive molecules, in the hemigonadectomized animals, were additional criteria for their classification as precocious or non-precocious. Blood samples were taken monthly to analyze plasma levels of estradiol (E 2), FSH, LH and vitellogenin using specific ELISAs to obtain a seasonal plasma profile for each female. Among these profiles, the vitellogenin showed the most divergent pattern between groups, with increasing levels from December onwards in precocious fish whereas only basal levels were observed in non-precocious females throughout the experiment. Gene expression analyses were done in the pre-pubertal ovaries extracted by hemigonadectomy. RNA samples were subsequently hybridized on a sea bass specific microarray for the identification of differentially expressed genes involved in early events of <b>precocious</b> female <b>puberty.</b> Finally, several candidate genes involved in the onset of puberty were also analyzed by real time PCR.

40|$|In normal subjects, thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) is not {{involved}} in the control of growth hormone secretion. Paradoxical growth hormone (GH) responses to TRH have been described in acromegalic subjects and, recently, in some constitutionally tall children. To confirm this finding, we have examined the GH response to combined LHRH-TRH tests performed to assess the pituitary function of children with GH deficiency, tall stature before and during bromocriptine therapy, <b>precocious</b> or delayed <b>puberty</b> as well as in a group of patients of average height and normal bone age. Unlike prolactin, the GH "response" to TRH, in children followed longitudinally, is particularly heterogeneous with an unpredictable pattern of secretion in repeated tests. Over 90 % of children display peaks of GH (greater than or equal to 5 ng/ml), of which 38 % occur twice during the test period. Amplitude and frequency of GH peaks appear to be independent of height, chronological age or bromocriptine therapy. Secretory rate estimated by integrated surface area increases in parallel to sex steroids impregnation. The pattern of GH secretory episodes, the increase in mean GH secretion in parallel to the production of gonadal sex steroids and the failure of bromocriptine to affect GH secretion in constitutionally tall children allow to speculate that what is measured after TRH injection is normal spontaneous GH rhythm rather than a direct effect of TRH on GH secretion...|$|R

However, like sex cord tumors, they can cause ovarian torsion or hemorrhage and, in children, isosexual <b>precocious</b> <b>puberty.</b> They frequently metastasize to nearby lymph nodes, especially para-aortic and pelvic lymph nodes. The most common symptom of germ cell tumors is subacute abdominal pain caused by the tumor bleeding, necrotizing, or stretching the ovarian capsule. If the tumor ruptures, causes significant bleeding, or torses the ovary, it can cause acute abdominal pain, which occurs in less than 10% of those with germ-cell tumors. They can also secrete hormones which change the menstrual cycle. In 25% of germ-cell tumors, the cancer is discovered during a routine examination and does not cause symptoms.|$|E
25|$|The growth {{problem is}} even worse in the simple virilizing forms of CAH which are {{detected}} when premature pubic hair appears in childhood, because the bone age is often several years advanced {{at the age of}} diagnosis. While a boy (or girl) with simple virilizing CAH is taller than peers at that point, he will have far fewer years remaining to grow, and may go from being a very tall 7-year-old to a 62-inch 13-year-old who has completed growth. Even with adrenal suppression, many of these children will have already had central <b>precocious</b> <b>puberty</b> triggered by the prolonged exposure of the hypothalamus to the adrenal androgens and estrogens. If this has begun, it may be advantageous to suppress puberty with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist such as leuprolide to slow continuing bone maturation.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To present {{relevant}} and updated {{information on the}} status of hypothyroidism in the pediatric popula-tion (newborn infants to adolescents). Sources: Original and review articles and books containing relevant updated data. Summary of the findings: This review addressed data on the etiopathogeny of hypothyroidism and on the importance of screening for congenital hypothyroidism to assure early diagnosis and treatment of the newborn. We point out the difficulties experienced in the handling of subclinical hypothyroidism; we also address the importance of diagnosing autoimmuneHashimoto’s thyroiditis, the high incidence of the disease amongadolescents,mainly females, and the occurrence of a severe neurological condition, Hashimoto’s encephalopathy. We indicate situations in which severe hypothyroidismmay lead to <b>puberty</b> disorders (<b>precocious</b> or delayed <b>puberty)</b> and describe the importance of transcription factors in thyroid embryogenesis. Diagnostic and therapeutic criteria are also addressed. Conclusion: Thyroid hormones are necessary for normal growth and development since fetal life. Insufficient production or inadequate activity on the cellular ormolecular level lead to hypothyroidism. These hormones are neces-sary {{for the development of the}} brain in the fetus and in the newborn infant. Neonatologists and pediatricians deal with child development issues in their practice, andmanyof these issues start during intrauterine life. Currently,withneonatal screening, neonatologists and pediatricians can prevent irreversible damage through early treatment. They should also be alert for dysfunctions such as subclinical hypothyroidism andHashimoto’s thyroiditis, whichmay provoke dam-age not only to growth, but also to the neurological and psychological development of these children and adolescents.

25|$|The {{side effects}} of {{ketoconazole}} are sometimes harnessed {{in the treatment of}} non-fungal conditions. While ketoconazole blocks the synthesis of the sterol ergosterol in fungi, in humans, at high dosages (>800mg/day), it potently inhibits the activity of several enzymes necessary for the conversion of cholesterol to steroid hormones such as testosterone and cortisol. Specifically, ketoconazole has been shown to inhibit cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme, which converts cholesterol to pregnenolone, 17α-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase, which convert pregnenolone into androgens, and 11β-hydoxylase, which converts 11-deoxycortisol to cortisol. All of these enzymes are mitochondrial cytochrome p450 enzymes. Based on these antiandrogen and antiglucocorticoid effects, ketoconazole has been used with some success as a second-line treatment for certain forms of advanced prostate cancer and for the suppression of glucocorticoid synthesis in the treatment of Cushing's syndrome. However, in the treatment of prostate cancer, concomitant glucocorticoid administration is needed to prevent adrenal insufficiency. Ketoconazole has additionally been used, in lower dosages, to treat hirsutism and, in combination with a GnRH analogue, male-limited <b>precocious</b> <b>puberty.</b> In any case, the risk of hepatotoxicity with ketoconazole limits its use in all of these indications, especially in those that are benign such as hirsutism.|$|E

40|$|The thesis can {{be divided}} in two main parts. In the first part (Chapter 2 to 5) bone mineral density, bone {{metabolism}} and body composition in healthy {{children and young adults}} have been evaluated, while in the second part (Chapter 6 to 10) these issues were studied in children with various diseases. Healthy children were studied to gain references for parameters of bone turnover, and to extend our reference data for bone density and body composition. Furthermore, the effect of polymorphisms in two candidate genes, e. g. polymorphisms in the vitamin D receptor gene and the collagen la 1 gene, were studied. For a proper interpretation of our findings in diseased children, it is essential to have, preferably own reference data for serum markers of bone turnover, bone density, and body composition. Results of our studies in healthy children are presented in Part I (Chapter 2 to 5). The long-term survival of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) has improved dramatically during the last decades, consequently more emphasis is being placed on the long- and shortterm side effects of ALL and its treatment. Some of these side-effects, such as osteoporosis, growth retardation and adiposity, have been investigated cross-sectionally in children ten years after diagnosis (Chapter 6). Furthermore, we longitudinally studied children who were newly diagnosed and followed during and after cessation of chemotherapy (Chapter 7). In Chapter 8 and 9 treatment with growth hormone will be discussed. Growth-retarded children with chronic renal failure were treated with growth hormone. The effects of GH treatment on bone density and body composition were compared to children with chronic renal failure but without growth hormone treatment (Chapter 8). Bone density, body composition and serum lipid levels in growth hormone deficient children, and the longitudinal effects of growth hormone treatment on these parameters will be described in Chapter 9. Puberty {{is considered to be a}} crucial period for bone mass acquisition. It is therefore important to know whether children with a disorder in pubertal development will achieve an adequate peak bone mass. The effects of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone-agonist (GnRH-a) on bone density and body composition were evaluated in children with <b>precocious</b> or early <b>puberty</b> (Chapter 10). Patients were studied before, during and after cessation of GnRH-a. In Chapter 11 & 12 results will be summarised and discussed, and recommendations for future research are made...|$|R
