40|$|Thick {{films of}} nearly equiatomic Coâ€“Pt {{produced}} by electrodeposition into nanoporous membranes exhibit an isotropic magnetic phase with square hysteresis loops (Mr/Ms= 0. 95) and coercivity {{of up to}} 1. 3 T. The initial magnetization curve is characteristic of <b>pinning-type</b> <b>magnets.</b> The coercivity can be controlled by the choice of annealing temperature or alloy composition, which depends on the chemical composition of the plating bath, properties which can be exploited to produce fine-pitch pole patterns...|$|E
