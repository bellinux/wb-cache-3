2500|$|French {{children}} are {{told a story}} in which they imagine having a <b>pond</b> with water <b>lily</b> <b>leaves</b> floating on the surface. The lily population doubles in size every day and if left unchecked will smother the pond in 30 days, killing all the other living things in the water. Day after day the plant seems small {{and so it is}} decided to leave it to grow until it half-covers the pond, before cutting it back. They are then asked on what day half-coverage will occur. This is revealed to be the 29th day, and then there will be just one day to save the pond. (From Meadows et al. 1972) ...|$|R
50|$|People often {{mistake the}} smaller scarlet lily beetle, Lilioceris lilii, for a {{cardinal}} beetle as {{they also have}} a black underside and wings that are spotless and red. However, the scarlet lily leaf beetle's wing cases have tiny dimples and are shinier and more rounded than the dull, narrow, flattened and elongated cardinal beetle. The beetles can also be distinguished by the cardinal's toothed antennae. Another difference between the two is their diets. Scarlet lily leaf beetles are herbivores and are usually found eating <b>lily</b> <b>leaves,</b> whereas cardinal <b>beetles</b> are usually found on tree bark and flowers and feed on flying insects.|$|R
