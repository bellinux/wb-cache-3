25|$|Aerotel's patent {{was found}} to relate to a <b>patentable</b> <b>invention</b> in {{principle}} because {{the system as a}} whole was new in itself, not merely because it is to be used for the business of selling phone calls. While this system could be implemented using conventional computers, the key to it was a new physical combination of hardware. The judge felt that this was clearly more than just a method of doing business as such. The method claims were construed as relating to a use of the new system and were also deemed to relate to a <b>patentable</b> <b>invention</b> in principle. The additional questions of whether the claimed invention was novel and involved an inventive step were not considered directly by the judge, although the implication is that the invention was at least novel.|$|E
2500|$|Relying on Mayo v. Prometheus, {{the court}} found that an {{abstract}} idea could not be patented just because it is implemented on a computer. In Alice, a software implementation of an escrow arrangement was not patent eligible because it is an implementation of an abstract idea. [...] Escrow is not a <b>patentable</b> <b>invention,</b> and merely using a computer system to manage escrow debts does not rise to the level needed for a patent. Under Alice, the [...] "Mayo framework" [...] should be used in all cases in which the Court has to decide whether a claim is patent-eligible.|$|E
2500|$|Salk {{preferred}} not to have {{his career as a}} scientist affected by too much personal attention, as he had always tried to remain independent and private in his research and life, but this proved to be impossible. [...] "Young man, a great tragedy has befallen you—you've lost your anonymity", the television personality Ed Murrow said to Salk shortly after the onslaught of media attention. When Murrow asked him, [...] "Who owns this patent?", Salk replied, [...] "Well, the people I would say. There is no patent. Could you patent the sun?" [...] The vaccine is calculated to be worth $7 billion had it been patented. However, lawyers from the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis did look into the possibility of a patent, but ultimately determined that the vaccine was not a <b>patentable</b> <b>invention</b> because of prior art.|$|E

40|$|Excerpt] 2 ̆ 2 Inventors pursue {{patents and}} authors receive copyrights. No special {{education}} {{is required for}} either endeavor, and nothing precludes a person from being both an author and an inventor. Inventors working on patentable industrial projects geared toward commercial exploitation tend to be scientists or engineers. Authors, {{with the exception of}} those writing computer code, tend to be educated or trained in the creative arts, such as visual art, performance art, music, dance, acting, creative writing, film making, and architectural drawing. There is a well-warranted societal supposition that most of the inventors of <b>patentable</b> <b>inventions</b> are male. Assumptions about the genders of the authors of remunerative commercially exploited copyrights may be less rigid. Women authors are more broadly visible than women inventors across most of the typical categories of copyrightable works. Yet, whether one considers <b>patentable</b> <b>inventions</b> or copyrightable works, {{the vast majority of the}} very profitable ones are both originated and controlled by men. This causes a host of negative consequences for women. They start and run businesses at much lower rates than men and rarely reach elite leadership levels in the corporate world or within high-profile artistic or cultural communities. They are perceived as less competent, less dedicated, and less hard working, and suffer from a lack of female mentors and female colleagues. Women are lied to during financial negotiations more than men and earn less than men in equivalent positions. Women control only a tiny portion of the world’s wealth. Though female students outperform male students in almost every context and at almost every level of education, and even seek postdegree job-related training in greater numbers than men, this has not helped women to produce and control <b>patentable</b> <b>inventions</b> or to author and own valuable copyrighted works in numbers comparable to men. 2 ̆...|$|R

50|$|In patent law, an {{inventor}} is the person, or persons in United States patent law, who {{contribute to the}} claims of a <b>patentable</b> <b>invention.</b> In some patent law frameworks, however, {{such as in the}} European Patent Convention (EPC) and its case law, no explicit, accurate definition of who exactly is {{an inventor}} is provided.

5000|$|Shell Oil Co v Canada (Commissioner of Patents), 1982 2 S.C.R. 536, is a {{landmark}} {{decision by the}} Supreme Court of Canada {{in the area of}} Canadian patent law.

In other words, the paradigm claims on appeal are not directed to statutory subject matter under 35 U.S.C. § 101 because they are not directed to subject matter within the four recognized categories of <b>patentable</b> <b>inventions.</b> Therefore, the paradigm claims, claims 24-35, are not patentable under 35 U.S.C. § 101 for at least this reason.|$|R
