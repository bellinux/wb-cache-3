40|$|Whilst {{growing demand}} for energy in Nepal and neighbouring- countries, {{investments}} in hydro- power projects appears continuously, both by local and multinational companies. As a consequence of this, Turbine Testing Lab was founded in 2011 at Kathmandu University in Nepal. The laboratory is rapidly developing, and is currently implementing a Francis turbine test rig. A long- term goal for the laboratory, is to execute model tests according to IEC 60193, which is the standard used in model tests of hydraulic runners. When determining the hydraulic efficiency of a runner, a central parameter is the discharge measurement. According to IEC, any secondary device {{used to measure the}} discharge shall be calibrated in sit&# 249; against one of the following primary methods: the weighing method, volumetric method or the moving- screen method. The aim of this work has been to develop and design a primary method for calibration of the flowmeter at TTL. Based on an evaluation of the mentioned primary methods, as well as economy, accuracy and correspondence with technical staff, a volumetric method is chosen as calibration principle. The principle of the method is based on collecting water into a tank with a known geometry, and by execution of level- and time measurements calculating the discharge. The calibration rig consists of a flowmeter, inlet nozzle, deflector mechanism, emergency weir, calibration tank, level measurement, time measurement, drainage system, emergency weir, and an upgraded <b>pipe</b> <b>run</b> at the measuring section of the flowmeter. It is developed a LabView program, for logging and processing the voltage output from the flowmeter. The other measurements executed is registered manually in a separate calibration sheet for data processing. An evaluation of the accuracy in the calibration method is conducted, which may be used to determine the total uncertainty when the calibration facility is installed. Provided design and installation according to ISO 8316, the accuracy in discharge measurement with the volumetric method lies within ± 0, 1 - 0, 2 %. The major uncertainty contribution in the method lies in the determination of the volume collected, and the corresponding tank calibration. It is proposed to reduce the diameter of the flowmeter from original size of 400 mm to 250 mm. Reduction in diameter and upgraded <b>pipe</b> <b>run</b> will increase accuracy of the flow measurement, a result of improved flow pattern at the measuring section. When the primary calibration rig is installed at TTL, this will be a large step towards an IEC- approved laboratory in Nepal, which open doors against an international market. </p...|$|E
40|$|Revolutionary new {{technology}} that creates balanced conditions {{across the face of}} a multi-hole orifice plate has been developed, patented and exclusively licensed for commercialization. This balanced flow technology simultaneously measures mass flow rate, volumetric flow rate, and fluid density with little or no straight <b>pipe</b> <b>run</b> requirements. Initially, the balanced plate was a drop in replacement for a traditional orifice plate, but testing revealed substantially better performance as compared to the orifice plate such as, 10 times better accuracy, 2 times faster (shorter distance) pressure recovery, 15 times less acoustic noise energy generation, and 2. 5 times less permanent pressure loss. During 2004 testing at MSFC, testing revealed several configurations of the balanced flow meter that match the accuracy of Venturi meters while having only slightly more permanent pressure loss. However, the balanced meter only requires a 0. 25 inch plate and has no upstream or downstream straight pipe requirements. As a fluid conditioning device, the fluid usually reaches fully developed flow within 1 pipe diameter of the balanced conditioning plate. This paper will describe the basic balanced flow metering technology, provide performance details generated by testing to date and provide implementation details along with calculations required for differing degrees of flow metering accuracy...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{multiphase}} flow meters (MPFMs) increase each year. The {{main reasons for}} this are the cost benefits connected {{to the use of}} such a meter by eliminating exclusive lines to the test separator and the test separator itself and the demand for a meter that can measure the produced fluids in real time without separating the phases. The MPFMs measures the flow rate by use of different measurement principles and techniques, and in combination of these, e. g. by means of Venturi and void fraction sensor. The scope of this thesis is to measure the flow rate of a two-phase flow by means of a flow meter device and a void fraction sensor and to check the applicability of several known calculation methods to the measurements. In order determine the flow rate of such a flow; a flow loop, flow meter, and a void fraction sensor are required to be designed and fabricated. The Venturi tube is a common flow meter and can offer high accuracy, high pressure recovery, a short straight <b>pipe</b> <b>run</b> is required upstream and has no moveable parts. No moveable parts are preferred throughout the industry, owing to expensive maintenance runs of any moveable part. The flow rate can be determined from the pressure drop over the Venturi from well known relationships. An impedance probe is used to determine the void fraction of the flow. This sensor is made from two full-ring electrodes flush mounted to the inner pipe wall making the impedance probe non-intrusive. To determine the mean void fraction from the impedance measurements the liquid holdup equation proposed by Andreussi et al. (1988) is used. Two rotameters are used as reference measurements in the flow loop, one for water and one for air. An electrical water pump and an air compressor are used in order to obtain a wide range of flow rates. The flow rates used in this study are ranging from 1. 185 up to 1. 975 m 3 /h for water and 0. 347 up to 2. 1 m 3 /h for air. Flow characteristics that are encountered are defined as bubbly and transition to slug flow, and the mean void fraction ranged from 18 % up to 44 % and the mass quality obtained ranged up to 0. 12 %. The uncertainty of the Venturi and impedance probe is obtained by the use of 90 % confidence interval, which is a common method used to present the uncertainty of a MPFM, Johnsen (2010). From the measurements the Chisholm correlation proved to achieve the best performance in predicting the flow rate of the two-phase flow and the homogenous model gives reasonable predictions of the flow. The uncertainty of the meters ability to measure the flow rate by the use of Chisholm correlation is ± 3. 5 %, ± 10. 23 %, and ± 4. 19 % for water, air, and total flow rate, respectively. The study shows that the measurement of a low quality (χ < 0. 12 %) two-phase flow is possible by the means of simple Venturi and impedance probe, when the mean void fraction ranged from 18 % up to 44 % and the flow is within the bubbly and transition to slug flow. </p...|$|E
30|$|Another reason {{accounting}} for temporary material shortage in the spool fabrication practice {{is attributed to}} the fact that raw materials can be misused in fabrication of spools. For example, a 12 -meter-long piece and two 6 -meter-long pieces of pipe of the same size, thickness and material type are procured to fabricate Spools A and B. Note the two 6 -meter-long pieces of raw pipe are intended for fabricating the two 5 -meter-long <b>pipe</b> <b>runs</b> on Spool A. However, in the fabrication process, the 12 -meter-long piece of raw pipe is cut into the two 5 -meter-long <b>pipe</b> <b>runs.</b> This happens to cause material storage in fabricating the 10 -meter-long pipe section on Spool B, which actually requires the 12 -meter-long piece of raw pipe.|$|R

40|$|Site {{inspections}} of Hot Reheat Piping system have indentifed cracking {{at a number}} locations at butt welds between <b>pipe</b> <b>runs</b> and elbows. Furthermore,it was discovered that <b>pipe</b> <b>runs</b> are instaled with wall thickness of SCH 60 (ANSI/ASME code[3]),and elbows with wall thickness of SCH 30 what is not according to design documentation. This wall thickness discrepancy creates a stress enhancement at the connections between elbows and piping runs. Also,because the elbows are more flexible,there could be a propensity for a creep strains to be concentrated in the elbows as the piping system stresses will be relaxed at these lower strength elbows rather than being distributed throughout the main piping runs. So,a detailed finite element analysis,including elastic and creep analysis, is performed {{to determine if the}} secondary stresses during relaxation,or if the stress enhacement of the wall thickness discrepancy,play significant roles in the cracking detected in the piping system...|$|R
