500|$|Daniels {{announced}} the first tuition freeze {{before the state}} had determined Purdue's funding for the next biennium.

This {{is the right thing}} to do and we are going to do it...the same way families do; the same way some governments do and all businesses do. [...] We are going to adjust our spending to what we believe is the available and in this case the fair amount of revenue. [...] I know often with good reason there has been an opportunity in higher education to adjust tuition to match what the place wanted to spend, and I just think we've reached the <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> ought to break that pattern." [...] The first tuition freeze required the university to find $40 million in savings or new revenue. In order to make up for the lost revenue from tuition freezes, Daniels and the Purdue Board of Trustees focused on finding operating efficiencies such as consolidating information technology data centers, investing cash reserves and switching to a consumer-driven health plan for employees.|$|E

Twiggs Lyndon, {{a friend of the}} band, joined them; he had just completed a stay in a psychiatric hospital stemming from his 1970 arrest for the murder of a concert promoter. Lyndon became the band's production manager. The band recorded four more tracks with Dowd, including [...] "Melissa," [...] "Les Brers in A Minor," [...] and [...] "Ain't Wastin' Time No More." [...] Allman's death provided the band with motivation; [...] "We were all putting more into it, trying so hard to make it as good as it would have been with Duane. We knew our driving force, our soul, the guy that set us all on fire, wasn't there and we had to do something for him," [...] said Trucks.

You feel like fans have paid their money and they expect you to come out and play them your songs like the first time you ever played them. That's the <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> hate touring." [...] The band was criticized for its lack of energy while performing. Cornell said that [...] "after a number of years, you start to feel like you're acting. All those people who criticize us for not jumping around should shut the fuck up, and when they come to our shows they should jump around and entertain us for a while." [...] Thayil had an issue with how the band's audience had changed, stating that [...] "nowadays, you also have the kids and the housewives, the casual fans. With your casual fans, you say, 'Thanks for the money.' And they say, 'Thanks for the song.'" [...] The band's concerts in December 1996 were postponed for a week due to Cornell's throat problems.|$|E

500|$|The band took a slot on the 1996 Lollapalooza {{tour with}} Metallica, who {{had insisted on}} Soundgarden's {{appearance}} on the tour. After Lollapalooza, the band embarked on a world tour, and already-existing tensions increased during it. When asked whether the band hated touring, Cornell replied: [...] "We really enjoy it to a point, and then it gets tedious, because it becomes repetitious.

The band retreated, with Cornell returning to end the show with a solo encore. On April 9, 1997, the band announced it was disbanding. Thayil said, [...] "It was pretty obvious from everybody's general attitude {{over the course of the}} previous half year that there was some dissatisfaction." [...] Cameron later said that Soundgarden was [...] "eaten up by the business".

[...] McMillan continued some of Mendelson's thinking, feeling that Marvel was [...] "in an awkward place with Civil War" [...] regarding superhero destruction moving forward. He wondered how superhero oversight would [...] "actually prevent the kind of destruction that it's meant to stop ... unless the bad guys all agree to play by the new rules" [...] as well. [...] "Worse still ... the destruction caused by superhero fights [...] foremost in viewers' heads ... the audience won't be able to enjoy the sight of the Hulk smashing a random minion through a wall without thinking of the property damage and/or whoever was standing {{on the other side of}} that wall.

500|$|The {{creative}} {{struggle was}} {{evident from the}} outset. Hoppus loved everything regarding Enema of the State — including the music videos and live show — and [...] "wanted to do it again," [...] desiring to create a bigger, better and louder follow-up. DeLonge, however, was striving for heavier and dirtier guitar-driven rock, which was inspired by post-hardcore bands Fugazi and Refused. Barker, [...] "never simply a punk rock drummer," [...] wanted to challenge himself and was listening to {{a great deal of}} hip hop and heavy metal. The lyrics often turned darker and more introspective for Hoppus, and [...] "love songs became broken love songs." [...] DeLonge rewrote some of his lyrics after listening to songs by Alkaline Trio, feeling as though he needed to [...] "step up his game." [...] DeLonge pushed his guitar style further away from that on Enema of the State: [...] "Arpeggiated guitar hooks became frenetic 1/16th note spasms," [...] wrote Hoppus in 2013. Barker's drum parts were looped and filtered, creating different sounds. For the first time, the trio worked in opposition to one another, and the sessions sometimes became contentious. Hoppus felt that the sessions created an unspoken competition between him and DeLonge, between who could write the better chorus or most clever lyrics. [...] "Our confidence and insecurity begat some heated differences, sometime to the <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> had to leave rooms and cool down," [...] recalled Hoppus. Finn would often smooth over differences with a joke, offering a fresh perspective and advice.|$|E
