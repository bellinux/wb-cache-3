40|$|Volvo Cars {{is in need}} of a {{development}} method to be used for in-house new product development of <b>powertrain</b> <b>mounts.</b> The current development process includes development of requirements in-house and component design by an external supplier. To reduce the development lead-time and cost Volvo Cars is investigating the possibilities to do component design of <b>powertrain</b> <b>mounts</b> in-house. It is suggested to use structural optimization as a tool in the design work. A method for using structural optimization to design the geometry of <b>powertrain</b> <b>mounts</b> to meet stiffness specifications has been developed in this project. The project focused on shape optimization of torque rods to meet static stiffness requirement. An iterative approach was used, where the optimization method was developed using a simplified torque rod to facilitate the development. It was also studied if it is possible to obtain material parameters to sufficiently accurate model rubber materials by doing tensile tests on rubber from existing components. Finally, the optimization method was applied to a real Volvo torque rod for validation and adjustment. The proposed optimization method is based on finite element (FE) modelling of the mount. A concept geometry and a requirement stiffness curve are needed as input to the method. An FE model of the concept geometry is created and then morphed, creating shapes that are used as design variables. The morphing enables controlled geometry changes that are used in the optimization. An objective function, that represents the sum of the squared distances that a certain design’s displacement values for certain force levels deviates from the required displacement values, is used to determine the goodness of the design. The shape of the FE model is then optimized by changing the shapes to minimizing the value of the objective function. The output from the optimization method is an optimized mount geometry that can be used as basis in final design work. The proposed method is performing well; it is able to optimize a concept geometry far from the final geometry into a shape that has a static stiffness close to the required. It is also able to fine-tune the shape of a full-feature geometry to a static stiffness very close to the requirement. The method is very flexible, and additional optimization constraints can easily be added. The proposed optimization method has potential of being an important tool in new product development of <b>powertrain</b> <b>mounts</b> or other rubber components. A modified version of the method was also shown to be useful for optimizing hyperelastic material parameters to model a certain rubber compound more accurately...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{design of}} an {{automotive}} <b>powertrain</b> <b>mounting</b> system {{plays an important}} role in improving vehicle noise, vibration and harshness (NVH). One of the main problems encountered in the automotive design remains the isolation of the low frequencies vibrations of the engine from the rest of the vehicle. Several engine mounting schemes have been developed to deal with this problem. Most of these strategies stem from arranging the rigid body modes of the engine mounted on resilient supports to have certain coupled or decoupled characteristics. It is currently admitted in literature that a decoupled <b>powertrain</b> <b>mounting</b> system improves NVH characteristics. The significant engine mass makes the right frequencies and modes arrangement a critical design decision. But it can not be stated that decoupling the on-ground rigid body modes of the engine will systematically reduce chassis vibrations. In this paper, a new analytical method is proposed to examine the mechanisms of coupling between the engine and the vehicle body structure. The analytical procedure enable to define the domain of validity of the mounting schemes based on a 6 degreesof- freedom engine model and to assess NVH improvement...|$|E

The methods are illustrated on the determination and improvement of powertrain induced steering wheel vibration of a heavy commercial truck. More specifically, the transmissibility of powertrain idle vibration to cabin is investigated with respect to powertrain rigid body modes and modal alignment of the steering column/wheel system is considered. It is found out that roll mode of the powertrain is not separated from idle excitation for effective vibration isolation as well as steering wheel column mode {{is close to the}} 3 rd engine excitation frequency order, which results in high vibration levels. Powertrain roll mode is optimized by tuning the <b>powertrain</b> <b>mount</b> stiffness to improve the performance. Steering column mode is also separated from the 3 rd engine excitation frequency by the application of a mass absorber. It is concluded that the use of analytical and test methods to address the complex relation between design parameters and powertrain idle response is effective to optimize the system performance and evaluate the trade-offs in the vehicle design such as vibration performance and weight.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effect of the <b>powertrain</b> <b>mounting</b> system on the linear and {{nonlinear}} torsional dynamical behaviour of a transmission system. To this aim, two dynamic models, one with rigid mounts and the other with flexible mounts, are presented and compared: the first model considers only the torsional dynamics of transmission and driveline, while the second model includes also a 3 degrees-of-freedom powertrain block. The mechanical coupling and interaction between the powertrain block and transmission system is discussed and formulated. These models are then analyzed in terms of vibrational mode shapes, natural frequencies and Frequency Response Functions (FRFs); a sensitivity analysis of the main transmission parameters, e. g. the gear ratio, is also presented. From the comparison of the two simulated configurations (with and without powertrain mounts) both in time and frequency domain, a significant interaction between the two subsystems is noticed, particularly in the vehicle acceleration signal. Neglecting the powertrain mounts may lead to underestimating the real vibration level. A nonlinear model of a dual clutch transmission, including the main backlashes present along the transmission path (clutch spline, gear meshes, synchronizers), is coupled to the <b>powertrain</b> <b>mounting</b> system model.

30|$|The design {{strategies}} for <b>powertrain</b> <b>mounting</b> systems {{play an important}} role in the reduction of vehicular vibration and noise. As stiffness and damping elements connecting the transmission system and vehicle body, the rubber mount exhibits better vibration isolation performance than the rigid connection. This paper presents a complete design process of the mounting system, including the vibration decoupling, vibration simulation analysis, topology optimization, and experimental verification. Based on the 6 -degrees-of-freedom vibration coupling model of the <b>powertrain</b> <b>mounting</b> system, an optimization algorithm is used to extract the best design parameters of each mount, thus rendering the mounting system fully decoupled and the natural frequency well configured, and the optimal parameters are used to design the mounting system. Subsequently, vibration simulation analysis is applied to the mounting system, considering both transmission and road excitations. According to the results of finite element analysis, the topological structure of the metal frame of the front mount is optimized to improve the strength and dynamic characteristics of the mounting system. Finally, the vibration bench test is used to verify the availability of the optimization design with the analysis of acceleration response and vibration transmissibility of the mounting system. The results show that the vibration isolation performance of the mounting system can be improved effectively using the vibration optimal decoupling method, and the structural modification of the metal frame can well promote the dynamic characteristics of the mounting system.|$|E

40|$|This conference {{paper was}} {{presented}} at Inter-noise 1998. Introduction: There is a general trend in the motor industry towards reduced noise levels inside vehicles. Low frequency vehicle interior noise, below 500 Hz, is mostly generated through structure-borne vibration emanating from the powertrain and transmitted through the various connection points to the vehicle body and into the passenger compartment. This noise contribution has been reduced dramatically {{over the past few}} years by control of the vibration levels generated by the <b>powertrain,</b> engine <b>mount</b> isolation and improved body structures. The consequence of this is that high frequency noise has become much more intrusive because of the reduction in the masking effect of low frequency noise. High frequency noises come from a variety of sources, and are generally airborne rather than structure-borne. Possibly the most annoying to the driver are narrow band high frequency noises, classified as ‘whine’ noises, the majority of which are attributable to noise radiated from the powertrain and the various auxiliary components attached to it. Engine radiated noise has also been reduced significantly over recent years, which means that the contribution of auxiliary components has become more important. A component such as the alternator can produce more overall radiated noise than the rest of the powertrain, if badly designed. So that an accessory will not give rise to unacceptable noise inside a vehicle the component suppliers must develop their parts such that radiated noise levels are sufficiently low. This can only be achieved if the suppliers know what levels of radiated noise are acceptable. This paper presents the results of an investigation into the influence of accessory noise on the overall interior noise of a vehicle, and the setting of tonal noise targets for vehicle accessories, concentrating on an automotive alternator. The investigations are based on detailed transfer function measurements carried out using a wideband sound source and the principle of acoustic reciprocity. A subjective target setting experiment is then described which allowed rig based target values to be derived...|$|R

One main reason is the carbon dioxide content of the exhaust gas emissions which is considered to contribute to global warming. This situation led to {{a renewed interest in}} hybrid vehicles which combine at least two types of propulsion systems. Generally an Electrical Motor (EM) is integrated between Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) and Gear Box (GB). The resulting Hybrid Electric Drive Train (HEDT) differs from the original one with respect to mass distribution, inertia moments and cg position, for example, thus requiring an adaptation of the mounting system in order to maintain a low vibration and noise level inside the passenger cabin. A <b>powertrain</b> <b>mounting</b> system has a significant effect in the noise, vibration and harshness (NVH) as well as ride and handling characteristics of a vehicle. Lighter vehicles and increasing customer demands for a vehicle refinement and dynamics are placing a greater emphasis on the optimization of the position, stiffness and damping characteristics of the mounts. A modeling approach is described, using the multibody dynamic simulation package ADAMS/ Engine, which allows the compromises between conflicting design requirements to be assessed rapidly and an optimum specification reached. The use of time domain non-linear approach allows the motion of the powertrain and mounts deflection to be assessed under normal and extreme driving conditions. Model of the major engine components allow the forced response of the powertrain, to low frequency engine excitation, to be predicted in order that idle shake and, via the use of transfer functions, interior vibration may be assessed.

To reduce costs and lead-time {{in the development}} process the possibility of in-house design of such components at Volvo Cars is being investigated. For this to be possible, knowledge must be built concerning modelling the mechanical properties of rubber materials. As part of this a parameter extraction method for modelling of filled rubber materials intended for finite element use has been developed in this project. Both a simple static model fitting procedure and a more complex dynamic model fitting procedure are detailed. Mechanical testing of four filled natural rubber materials with varying hardnesswas carried out at the facilities of Volvo Cars and recommendations have been made regarding {{the limits of the}} equipment and the specific test body geometry used. It was found that the lower limit for dynamic testing in regards to displacement amplitude is 0. 02 mm. The highest frequency recommended is dependent on the material hardness but a higher limit of 200 Hz is recommended for the softest material investigated. The upper limit was found to be necessary due to inertia effects in the material. The models used to describe the static behaviour were hyperelastic phenomenological models independent on the second invariant such as the Yeoh and the linear neo-Hookean models. The dynamic model used the overlay method to capture therate and amplitude dependent properties of filled rubber. A generalized viscoelastic-elastoplastic rheological model using Maxwell and friction elements in parallel with alinear elastic element was presented and used. These were limited to having maximumfive of each element and no attempts at minimizing this number was made in this work. The dynamic model was fitted to experimental data using a minimization procedure focusing on dynamic modulus and damping at a range of frequencies and strain amplitudes. The proposed fitting procedure is a three segment loop in which FE simulationsof the experimental data is used as both a correction and a validation tool.
