40|$|Abstract. Most of the {{magnetic}} fields of cosmic objects are generated and maintained by dynamo action of the motions of electrically conducting fluids. A brief survey on observational facts concerning cosmic magnetic fields is given. Some basic principles of magnetofluiddynamics are explained. On this basis essential features of the dynamo theory of cosmic objects are developed, first on the kinematic level and later {{taking into account the}} full interaction between magnetic field and motion. Particular attention is paid on mean–field electrodynamics and mean–field magnetofluiddynamics and their application to mean–field dynamo models for objects showing irregular or turbulent motions and magnetic fields. A few explanations are given on dynamos in the Earth and the planets, in the Sun and stellar objects and in galaxies. <b>Preliminary</b> <b>remark</b> The lectures whose main content is reproduced in this article were planned to give an introduction to the dynamo theory of cosmic magnetic fields.

40|$|International audienceIn this {{presentation}} {{we focus}} on the problem of minimization of the consumption for the coplanar orbit transfer problem. This problem is usually solved numerically by a shooting method, based on the application of the Pontryagin Maximum Principle, however the shooting method is known to be hard to initialize and the convergence is difficult to obtain due to discontinuities of the optimal control. Several tricks are known in order to overcome that problem, however in this article we introduce a new approach based on the following <b>preliminary</b> <b>remark.</b> When considering a 2 D flat Earth model with constant gravity, the optimal control problem of passing from an initial configuration to some final configuration by minimizing the consumption can be very efficiently solved, and the solution leads to an extremely efficient algorithm. Based on that, we propose a continuous deformation from this flat Earth model to a modified flat Earth model that is diffeomorphic to the usual round Earth model. The resulting numerical continuation process thus provides a new way {{to solve the problem of}} minimization of the consumption for the coplanar orbit transfer problem...|$|E
40|$|Mass {{customization}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} interesting and promising approach in the e-business field. In today's competitive global market the understanding of customer needs is becoming the essential <b>preliminary</b> <b>remark</b> for a successful design and implementation of products. In fact the ability to create customized product configurations fulfilling user’s needs is a major aim sought by many companies, especially the design and implementation of web-based services that allows users to create and customize in a simple and intuitive way a desired product. To define a common vocabulary that opens possibilities such as the ability to express customer requirements correctly and to exchange knowledge, a popular approach uses ontological formalisms. Ontology, in fact, is a key factor for enabling interoperability across heterogeneous systems, services and users. Different users, however, usually represent the same knowledge domain by the use of different ontologies that can differ in structure, concepts, relations and attributes. Therefore, ontology could lose its main feature: allowing the semantic interoperability among actors working on the same knowledge domain. An effective solution to this problem is the introduction of methods for finding mapping among the various components of ontologies. This paper presents an ontology-based configurator system that maximally satisfies user’s needs starting from the desired requirements, the available components, the context information and previous similar configurations...|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{focuses on}} {{sections}} iv and v of part II of Wittgenstein's Philosophical Investigations. In these sections Wittgenstein deals with two closely knit problems: {{our knowledge of}} other minds and {{the subject matter of}} psychology. The interpretation of Wittgenstein's treatment of these problems cannot remain confined to these sections, however, as equally important references to these problems occur elsewhere in the Investigations {{as well as in the}} Remarks on the Philosophy of Psychology. Moreover, Wittgenstein's very treatment of the two problems is intertwined with his treatment of some other problems in the philosophy of psychology. For instance, in the context of his discussion of the subject matter of psychology, he points out analogies with problems pertaining to theories of perception. I take these analogies seriously and, therefore, a discussion of perception is interwoven as appropriately. Yet another <b>preliminary</b> <b>remark.</b> Although references to other philosophers and psychologists do not occur in sections iv and v, it does not follow that they were not written in response to others. On the contrary, a substantial part of these (and other) sections is the product of reflecting upon theories produced by Russell, James and Köhler. In my view, the best way to understand Wittgenstein is to involve the standpoints of his adversaries explicitly into the discussion. Otherwise seemingly trivial questions and condensed remarks, gain power and depth when explicitly seen as undermining and reversing dominant theories in philosophy and psychology...|$|E
40|$|The {{contribution}} {{shows the}} results of a research aiming to the chrono-typological definition of earthen building situated in the South of Sardinia, specifically in Quartu Sant’Elena, Villamassargia, Serramanna and Pirri. Indeed, there is no systematic and scientifically based catalogue of the traditional solutions used by the Sardinia builders for the realization of earthen walling, with great detriment for their conservation, especially with reference to the so called ‘minor building’, just for its non-identification. Considering this lack, the investigation aims to date masonries, using chrono-typological criteria, based on: - the examination of the printed sources concerning building materials and of archive sources; - the realisation, through metric and photographic surveys, of drawings highlighting the constructive peculiarities of the masonries analysed (metrical, materical, morphological); - the identification of the chrono-typological models identified; - the definition of chronological series of the structural solutions. Specifically, through the interpretation of local techniques, it is possible to study in detail the traditional building practices. The aim of this research, in operative sense, is double, i. e. : 1. to arrive to a correct definition of the restoration project, really respectful of the essence of the building, as well as respectful of compatibility and reversibility criteria; 2. to promote the permanence of the use of earth, as we know very vulnerable and easily degradable, but representing a sustainable solution, exploring new rules for the contemporary project. Besides, one believe that the deep knowledge of constructive characteristics, by a structural, chemical and physical point of view, is the only <b>preliminary</b> <b>remark</b> to plan a conservation project, in the respect of cultural, materical and figurative consistence of architectural heritage. ...|$|E
40|$|Focussing on the {{definition}} of the Annual Report genre, this paper explores how much ´interdisciplinarity´ and ´contamination´ are needed in order to achieve the communicative purposes the Annual Reports are written for, through their rhetorical structuring and linguistic realisations. This is a research project, still ‘under construction’, as it is founded on a joint effort with accountancy experts with whom we are gradually forming a common method for analysing a text as complex as an Annual Report. The aim is to join efforts and specific expertise in order to improve: a) 	tools for analysing such texts; b) 	classifying the quantity of information they provide; c) 	interpreting and evaluating the quality of such information. The paper presents a synthesis of the main study areas so far associated with Annual Reports. A fundamental <b>preliminary</b> <b>remark</b> is that: 1. This genre has been subject to various research efforts in disciplines that are very different (accounting, finance, marketing, linguistics, and semiotics are among the most significant). 2. The Annual Report is to be considered a highly specialised text, created by and for insiders, even though often created also for popularization, addressing an audience of non-experts. 3. In the area of linguistics, the Annual Report genre has also been a tool for studying Business English (Bargiela Chiappini/Nickerson 1999; Del Lungo Camiciotti et al. 2006) and, less frequently, for legal English (Gotti 2009; Gunnarson 2009; Olsen et al. 2009; Veneziani et al. 2010) even though its significant regulatory content has often not been taken sufficiently into account : a reason for which this text is of great significance socially, culturally and ethnographically. These considerations have led us to reconsider the concepts of ‘interdisciplinarity’ and ‘contamination’ for applied linguistics as a new methodological basis for an area that is certainly not new to recent research into specialised English (Bargiela Chiappini/Nickerson 1999; Garzone 2004, 2005; Gotti 2005; Gotti/Giannoni 2006) but that has, in our opinion, lacked, up until now, an “integral and integrated” analysis (that is to say in all of its numerous elements, or based on an interaction between linguists and experts in the sector) ...|$|E

It was hypothesized that there should be variances in the contents of responses to open questions which have different <b>preliminary</b> <b>remarks</b> prior to them. The remarks which stress explanation lead to explanatory responses to the open question, whereas the remarks which stress evaluation lead to evaluative responses to the same open question, as compared with the responses to the same open question which has no <b>preliminary</b> <b>remarks.</b> Sixty one undergraduates served as the participants were assigned to one of the three groups: the explanatory <b>preliminary</b> <b>remarks</b> group (EXP gr.), the evaluative <b>preliminary</b> <b>remarks</b> group (EVA gr.), and the no <b>preliminary</b> <b>remarks</b> group (NO gr.). The participant assigned to the EXP group was asked as follows: "Please remember someone who is particularly intimate with vou. I would like to ask you how you explain your friendship if you do so. Could you tell me about your friendship as you like?" The participant assigned to the EVA group was asked as follows: "Please remember someone who is particularly intimate with you. I would like to ask you how you evaluate your friendship if you do so. Could you tell me about your friendship as you like?" The participant assigned to the NO group was asked only as follows: "Could you tell me about your friendship as you like?" About half of the participants were asked about their friendship, whereas the other half were asked about their career. Every verbal response was audiotaped and was transcribed in wordprocessor. The results were analyzed qualitatively as well as quantitatively. The results showed that in the quantitative measures there were no statistical differences among the groups, whereas in the quantitative measure there were statistically significant differences in line with our predictions.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study is to examine how the legacy of Alexander was appropriated, altered and used in {{arguments}} in early Christian discourse (c. 200 - 600). There is an inventory of all the early Christian references to Alexander in Appendix 1. The structure of the thesis is conceived as an unequal triptych: it is divided into three parts with subdivisions into three chapters of varying lengths (Part III contains two chapters and the thesis conclusion). Each part is prefaced with a short description of its contents. Each chapter within those parts have a <b>preliminary</b> <b>remark</b> to introduce the principal subject area with a brief conclusion in the back of it. Part I explores the Alexander traditions of three geographical centres of the Christian world: Alexandria (Ch. 1), Jerusalem (Ch. 2) and Rome (Ch. 3). It shows how the Jewish tales from these cities, such as the Josephan tale about Alexander’s visit to Jerusalem, were used in a variety of diverging, often contradictory, ways. Part II turns to the writings of the apologists {{in the second and third}} centuries. It discusses three prevalent themes associated with Alexander: historiography (Ch. 4), divine honours (Ch. 5) and Greek philosophy (Ch. 6). Part III moves on to the central texts and Alexander themes in the fourth to sixth centuries. It focuses on his role in Christian chronicles, church histories and representations of their world (Ch. 7), and also the rhetorical use of the figure in Christian preaching and public speaking (Ch. 8). Taken together, these three parts form the overarching argument that Alexander did not only fill many diverse roles in Christian representations of the remote past, but also featured in contemporary discourse on Christian culture, identities and societies, as well as in arguments made on behalf of the Christian religion itself. Indeed, the Christians frequently juxtapose the figure with distinctively Christian features, such as the life of Jesus, the Apostles, the church, sacred cities and holy spaces. They incorporate him into discourses on peace, mercy, generosity and abstinence. In other words, they repeatedly made Alexander relevant for what they considered important and, thus, created their own distinct discourse on the figure. A. G. Leventis Foundatio...|$|E
40|$|More {{than one}} third of {{companies}} listed in the FTSE EUROFIRST 300 index are governed accordingly to principles differing from the One share – One vote standards. These exceptions could be illustrated by several practices such as Scandinavian multiple voting shares, non voting shares as seen in some State members as authorised by European Directives, French double voting shares, “golden shares” concerning recently privatized firms, or even preference shares as observed in Holland. Such variety {{can be explained by}} the fact that “control rights” and “cash-flow rights”, understood as essential to the company's activities, are distinctly considered in the shareholder practices. The question at stake is to know if the application of the One share – One vote as a European standard would be justified with regard to European Law, including its underlying principles, and to economic efficiency in general. Indeed, One share – One vote enthusiast affirm that this rule participates to corporate democracy and contributes to increases firms' performance. The aim of our study is to determine whether these principles are reached or not. As a <b>preliminary</b> <b>remark,</b> we can notice that the European Commission intervention is questionable. First, its competence, and therefore the legality of a potential action, is not obvious. Indeed, owing to the subsidiarity principle and the article 48. 2 : (“co-ordinating to the necessary extent the safeguards which, for the protection of the interests of members and others, are required by Member States of companies or firms, with a view to making such safeguards equivalent throughout the Community”.) and the European Parliament position concerning the Takeover Directive, the legitimacy of the European Commission in this case is undoubtedly compromised. Then, the application of One share - One vote, by the cancellation of certain rights attached to a share, would violate a democratic principle, founder of the European Union, and dedicated by Member States Constitutions, known as private property. It would have, as a result, an unjustified, not compensable and therefore, illegal expropriation. We also have to question ourselves concerning the concept of corporate democracy and its consequences on Europeans companies. Unquestionable at first glance, is the notion of democracy transposable it in corporate Law? Is it only referring to a strict equality between shareholders or rather intents to limit unequal situations and therefore, prevent dominant shareholders from unilaterally capturing the company's performance? The respect of principles such as equity, shareholders general interest and company's interest, combined with transparency rules and protection of minority shareholders leads us to favour the second supposition. Finally, we underline that the ultimate argument relating to efficiency as a result from the strict application of the One share – One vote rule, is tempered by economical studies and by the practice observed in several State members. The One share - One vote rule could definitely be necessary for market readability purposes. But, some exception to this rule might be justified with regard to the company's interest. Therefore, some flexibility principles should remain. A dogmatic approach focused on shareholders, or certain type of shareholders, would disadvantage the development of the internal market and could not be justifiable on a legal ground. We believe that promoting corporate democracy requests an enhancement of transparency with a better bordering of existing practices and a strengthening of minority shareholders (by improving an “upper standard” harmonization).
