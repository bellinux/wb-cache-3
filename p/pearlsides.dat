5000|$|Maurolicus is an oceanic ray-finned fish genus which {{belongs in}} the family Sternoptychidae. They are {{commonly}} known as <b>pearlsides,</b> but the brilliant pearlside is the related Argyripnus iridescens.

50|$|The marine hatchetfishes or deep-sea hatchetfishes {{as well as}} {{the related}} bottlelights, <b>pearlsides</b> and constellationfishes are small deep-sea ray-finned fish of the stomiiform family Sternoptychidae. They are not closely related to and should not be {{confused}} with the freshwater hatchetfishes, which are teleosts in the characiform family Gasteropelecidae. The Sternoptychidae have 10 genera and about 70 species altogether.|$|E
50|$|The Zeidae are top predators {{in their}} habitat and are noted for their marked stenophagy: juveniles feed {{exclusively}} on zooplankton, such as copepods, euphausiids, mysids, apheids, pandalids, palaemonids, {{and other small}} crustaceans. Conversely, adults feed almost exclusively on active schooling fish, such as <b>pearlsides,</b> porgies, young carangids (e.g., mackerels), and clupeids (e.g., sardines and pilchards); and other benthic fish, such as dragonets, gobies, filefish, flatfish, bandfish, and sea chubs; and occasionally on cephalopods such as squid and cuttlefish.|$|E

50|$|Mueller's <b>pearlside</b> or Mueller's bristle-mouth fish, Maurolicus muelleri, {{a marine}} hatchetfish {{of the genus}} Maurolicus, is found in deep tropical, {{subtropical}} and temperate waters of the Pacific Ocean and the Atlantic Ocean, from the surface to depths of 1,500 m. Its can grow up to 8 cm at maximum.|$|R
5000|$|Typically, the Sternoptychidae {{are divided}} into two subfamilies, with the more plesiomorphic members making up the Maurolicinae. Symplesiomorphies are no {{reliable}} indicator of actual relationships, however. While {{it remains to be}} seen what Sternoptychidae other than the <b>pearlsides</b> (Maurolicus, the type genus) do actually belong in the Maurolicinae, it is unlikely that the two-subfamily arrangement is correct. It may even be that the Maurolicinae are just an indiscriminate assemblage of unrelated basal Sternoptychidae and are altogether invalid. The Sternoptychinae [...] - [...] the [...] "true" [...] marine hatchetfishes [...] - [...] on the other hand are monophyletic.|$|E
5000|$|Sternoptychidae {{undertake}} nightly mass migrations from {{depths of}} 3,600 metres {{to the upper}} 50-100 metres of the starlit water column. There they feed throughout the night, returning to the depths by daybreak. Their prey consists primarily of tiny crustaceans, such as amphipods, copepods, euphausiids (krill) and ostracods (seed shrimp), and of fish smaller than themselves. What little is known of their life cycle suggests {{that at least some}} members of this family are short-lived, dying after no more than a year. They spawn in the open water, and do not guard or otherwise care for their offspring; species with a short lifespan are presumably semelparous The fry [...] - [...] even of Sternoptychinae [...] - [...] look like tiny <b>pearlsides</b> (Maurolicus).|$|E
5000|$|Harbour {{porpoises}} prefer temperate and subarctic waters. They inhabit fjords, bays, estuaries and harbours, hence their name. They feed {{mostly on}} small pelagic schooling fish, particularly herring, capelin, and sprat. [...] They will, however, eat squid and crustaceans in certain places. [...] This species tends to feed {{close to the}} sea bottom, at least for waters less than 200 m deep. [...] However, when hunting sprat, porpoise may stay closer to the surface. [...] When in deeper waters, porpoises may forage for mid-water fish, such as <b>pearlsides.</b> [...] A study published in 2016 showed that porpoises {{off the coast of}} Denmark were hunting 200 fish per hour during the day and up to 550 per hour at night, catching 90% of the fish they targeted. [...] Almost all the fish they ate were very small, between 3 and(-) 10 cm long.|$|E
50|$|A {{total of}} 21 {{specimens}} were examined from examples caught in Galicia and different prey items which fell into three distinct types {{were found to}} be taken as prey by Todaropis eblanae these were bony fish, crustaceans and other cephalopods.

40|$|Acoustic {{scattering}} layers (SL) {{ascribed to}} <b>pearlside</b> Maurolicus muelleri were studied in Masfjorden, Norway, using upward-looking echo sounders cabled to shore for continuous long-term measurements. The acoustic studies {{were accompanied by}} continuous measurements of surface light and supplemented with intermittent field campaigns. From autumn to spring, young M. muelleri formed an SL in the upper ∼ 75 to 150 m in the daytime, characterized by migration to near-surface water near dusk, subsequent 'midnight sinking', followed by a dawn ascent before {{a return to the}} daytime habitat. Light levels were ∼ 1 order of magnitude lower during the dawn ascent than for ascent in the afternoon, with the latter terminating before fish reached upper layers on ∼ 1 / 3 of the nights from late November to mid-April. Adults showed less tendency of migration during autumn and winter, until the SLs of young and adults merged in late spring, and thereafter displayed coherent migration behavior. The midnight sinking became progressively deeper from autumn to winter but was strongly reduced from mid-May when the darkest nocturnal light intensity (PAR) at the surface was above 10 - 3 μmol m- 2 s- 1. The <b>pearlside</b> took on schooling in upper waters during the even lighter nights in early June, with minimum light of ∼ 5 × 10 - 3 to 10 - 1 μmol m- 2 s- 1 at the surface. Nocturnal schooling ceased in early July, and midnight sinking reappeared in mid-August. We suggest that the strong variation in nocturnal light intensity at high latitudes provides changing trade-offs between visual foraging and avoiding predators and hence varying time budgets for feeding in the upper, productive layers...|$|R
5000|$|Bryde's whales feed on a {{wide variety}} of fish, planktonic crustaceans, and cephalopods. In the western North Pacific, Bryde's whales caught by Japanese {{scientific}} whaling vessels (2000-2007) mainly fed on Japanese anchovy (Engraulis japonicus, 52%) and various species of euphausiid (36%, including Euphausia similis, E. gibboides, Thysanoessa gregaria, and Nematoscelis difficilis), as well as oceanic lightfish (Vinciguerria nimbaria, nearly 3%), and mackerels (Scomber spp., less than 2%). The prey differed by location and season. In coastal areas, euphausiids dominated the diet, comprising 89 and 75% of the diet in May and June, respectively. Further offshore, Japanese anchovy was the dominant species, accounting for nearly 100% of the diet in late summer. Based on the stomach contents of Bryde's whales caught by Japanese pelagic whaling expeditions in the North Pacific in the 1970s, the majority where found to feed on euphausiids (nearly 89%), whereas only about 11% fed on fish.Off South Africa, prey preferences differed between the inshore and offshore forms. The former mainly feed on anchovies (Engraulis capensis, 83%), maasbankers (Trachurus trachurus, 36%), and pilchards (Sardinops ocellata, 33%), with only one (or 3%) being found with euphausiids (Nyctiphanes capensis). The latter, however, mainly feed on euphausiids (primarily Euphausia lucens, but also E. recurva, N. capensis, and Thysanoessa gregaria), as well as various deep-sea fish (including Mueller's <b>pearlside,</b> Maurolicus muelleri, and a species of Lestidium).

40|$|Most {{vertebrates}} have a duplex retina comprising two photoreceptor types, rods for dim-light (scotopic) {{vision and}} cones for bright-light (photopic) and color vision. However, deep-sea fishes are only active in dim-light conditions; hence, most species {{have lost their}} cones {{in favor of a}} simplex retina composed exclusively of rods. Although the <b>pearlsides,</b> Maurolicus spp., have such a pure rod retina, their behavior is at odds with this simplex visual system. Contrary to other deep-sea fishes, <b>pearlsides</b> are mostly active during dusk and dawn close to the surface, where light levels are intermediate (twilight or mesopic) and require the use of both rod and cone photoreceptors. This study elucidates this paradox by demonstrating that the pearlside retina does not have rod photoreceptors only; instead, it is composed almost exclusively of transmuted cone photoreceptors. These transmuted cells combine the morphological characteristics of a rod photoreceptor with a cone opsin and a cone phototransduction cascade to form a unique photoreceptor type, a rod-like cone, specifically tuned to the light conditions of the <b>pearlsides</b> 2 ̆ 7 habitat (blue-shifted light at mesopic intensities). Combining properties of both rods and cones into a single cell type, instead of using two photoreceptor types that do not function at their full potential under mesopic conditions, {{is likely to be the}} most efficient and economical solution to optimize visual performance. These results challenge the standing paradigm of the function and evolution of the vertebrate duplex retina and emphasize the need for a more comprehensive evaluation of visual systems in general...|$|E
40|$|A {{research}} cruise {{was made}} in the Irminger Sea west and southwest of Iceland and adjacent waters on the Icelandic vessel Árni Friðriksson, from 03 Jun- 04 Jul 2003. The main purpose was to study distribution and abundance of deepwater redfishes, Sebastes mentella et sp., other pelagic fishes, zooplankton, phytoplankton and the hydrography of the area. Part of the cruise was devoted to a special study on community structure at transect over {{the northern part of the}} Mid-Atlantic Ridge (Reykjanes Ridge). In this paper, an overview is given on the composition of the pelagic fish community, both vertically and horizontally, over the northern part of the Reykjanes Ridge. In total, nine trawl hauls were made with a “GLORIA” midwater trawl outfitted with a small mesh size (9 -mm) cod-end. Three hauls were made at three different depths west of the Ridge, three above it and three East of the Ridge. A total of 230 nautical miles separated hauls taken west of the Ridge and east of it. A minimum total of 44 species were identified from 23 families. Lanternfishes (Myctophidae), <b>pearlsides</b> (Sternoptychidae), barracudinas (Paralepididae), dragonfishes (Stomiidae) and deep-sea smelts (Microstomatidae) dominated fish catches. Results show that the total number of fishes caught was lowest east of the Ridge, coinciding with warmer deep waters. At all positions both number of species and families increased with depth as the number of individuals decreased with depth...|$|E
40|$|During {{the second}} half of 1984, T. sagittatus invaded the Norwegian coastal waters, but less {{abundant}} than in 1983. During the spring and summer 1985, squid was present in small numbers. In the autumn of 1985, T. sagittatus again frequented Norwegian waters, more abundantly than in the previous year. Materials for investigation were obtained from research cruises near Shetland in July 1984, from Norwegian coastal banks in April and August-September 1985 and, through the courtecy of the Faroese Institute of Fisheries Investigations, from the Faroes in August 1985. During September-December 1984, samples of squid were also obtained from commercial catches along the coast of Norway. From July to December 1984 the mean dorsal mantle length (DML) of the females increased from near 21 cm to about 33 cm. In April 1985, females measured 33 - 43 cm. In August 1985, the squid at the Faroes measured 24 cm in average, similar to those from the Norwegian coastal banks in August- September. In the latter area, a few larger females, ML 42 - 47 cm, were also present. The stomach contents were mostly dominated by small fish, mainly blue whiting and <b>pearlside.</b> At the Faroes, a decapod, not identified, was also frequent. In stomach contents of squid from commercial catches at the coast of Norway, squid remains were common. The liver percentages were very variable, with mean values mostly below 10 %. Age determinations, based on counts of primary growth rings in the statoliths, confirmed observations from earlier years, with mean ages of 9 - 10 months. This also applies to squid caught in April. Squid, caught during July-October 1984, were supposed to be hatched in November 1983 -January 1984, those caught in December, in January-March 1984; those taken in April 1985 were hatched in June 1984. Squid, caught in August-September 1985, were mainly hatched in November-December 1984. In 1984 the commercial fishery yielded about 8 000 tons, in 1985 close to 14 000 tons...|$|R
40|$|Investigations on gonatus fabricii (gonatus) in the Norwegian Sea {{and western}} Barents Sea {{continued}} during June-September 1982 and 1983. Materials were collected with pelagic trawls and from stomach contents of blue ling and Greenland halibut. Dorsal mantle lengths (DML) were mainly 20 - 50 mm, extremes 10 mm and 100 mm. Larger gonatus, DML 80 - 200 mm, {{were taken in}} deep pelagic and bottom hauls at 200 - 400 m. Gonatus with DML 95 - 255 mm were the main contents in stomachs of blue ling and Greenland halibut fished in April-June on the continental slope off western Norway. Age and growth were estimated from counts of primary growth rings in the statoliths. In the juveniles, linear relations were found between DML and number of growth rings, but with varying slopes of the regression lines, and correlation coefficients, r, varying from 0. 47 to 0. 67. In larger gonatus, the regression curve had a sigmoid shape. The assumption that larger gonatus, having. left the surface layers, grow considerably faster than the juveniles, seems to be confirmed. The relationship between total statolith length. (TLS) and DML, both in mm, was calculated for various length groups with the following results: DML 10 - 250 mm: TLS = 0. 131 DML 0. 47, n = 201, r²= 0. 93 DML 10 - 69 mm: TLS = 0. 104 DML 0. 53, n = 163, r²= 0. 93 DML 70 - 250 mm: TLS = 0. 328 DML 0. 26, n = 38, r²= 0. 74 There is a considerable change in the relationship for DML longer than 70 mm, indicating a slower growth of the stato 1 iths. The main spawning period seems to be from December to April, on, or near the bottom in 300 - 700 m depth or more on the continental slopes of the Norwegian Sea, from {{the west coast of}} Norway to West-Spitsbergen, and westwards to Iceland and Jan Mayen. The food of juvenile gonatus was dominated by amphipods, Parathemisto sp., but copepods, chaetognaths, euphausiids, pteropods and Pasiphaea sp. were also identified.

40|$|Since 1977 {{the squid}} Todarodes sagittatus has invaded the Norwegian coast and adj acent areas every year. Materials for {{investigation}} {{were collected from}} August 1981 to April 1982. In coastal areas the mean dorsal mantle length (DML) of the femea 1 es increased from 28 cm in August to 35 - 39 cm in November, and to 43 cm in March, while males measured averagely 31 cm in November. In oceanic and bank waters the mean DML's {{for males and females}} in August were 24 cm and 26 cm respectively, in March 32 cm and 39 - 40 cm. Liver weight constituted 3 - 23 % of total weight, in oceanic waters. with mean of about 7 % in August and 11 % in March, in coastal areas 6 - 9 % in August-November. The most important food items were fish (redfish, blue whiting, <b>pearlside),</b> cephalopods, euphausiids and amphipods. Males were usually scarce, 0 - 8. 6 % of the total number in fjord areas, 0 - 23 % in open waters, but in March 1982 samples from the Viking bank had 80. 8 % males. In fjord areas nearly all males were immature in November, single larger animals maturing. In March most males in open waters were maturing or mature. Of the females, a few were in stage 4 in November, the majority immature. In March most females in open waters were in stage 2, a few in stage 3 and 4. Primary growth rings (GR) in the statoliths were counted and related to DML, and a functional GM-regression was fitted. In squid from the Hebrides-Faroe area in March-April 1981 the result was: DML= 0. 121 GR + 1. 850, r²= 0. 686, n= 38. In squid from the Norwegian Sea and the coast of Norway August-November 1981 : DML:= 0. 213 GR - 31. 020, r²= 0, 185, n= 416. In the latter case the regression is significant (F= 94. 1, p<< 0. 01), but only 18 % of the total variance is explained by linear regression. Most of the squid enters the area studied at an age of about 200 days. Local differences in available food may induce great variations in growth. Hatching periods indicated are: OctoberNovember, December-January, and March-May. During. August-November 1981, 3500 squid were tagged with anchor tags at 32 localities. Until June 10 1982, 26 tags have been recovered after maximum 66 days at or near the tagging locality. One squid was recovered after 154 days, 145 n. miles from the tagging site.

40|$|This work {{describes}} the diet, through {{the analysis of}} stomach contents, of different species of cetaceans in Andalusian waters. Stomachs of 53 specimens, 36 striped dolphins (Stenella coeruleoalba), 13 common dolphins (Delphinus delphis) and 4 Risso's dolphins (Grampus griseus) stranded in the provinces of Cadiz, Huelva, Malaga and Almeria (South Iberian Peninsula) were examined. Strandings were attended {{by members of the}} official stranding network of Andalusia. Fourteen of the specimens had no food remains in the stomachs: 9 striped dolphins, 2 common dolphins and 1 Risso´s dolphin. Prey remains consisted mostly of hard structures e. g. fish otoliths, bones and eye lenses, cephalopod jaws and eye lenses and crustaceans exoskeletons. These remains were identified using published guides (e. g. Clarke, 1986; Härkonen, 1986; Xavier & Cherel, 2009) and reference material available at the Centro Oceanográfico in Vigo of the Spanish Institute of Oceanography (IEO). Diet was characterised for each cetacean species using three standard indices, calculated for each category of prey and for group totals: the frequency of occurrence in the stomachs, the number of individuals and the reconstructed prey weight. These indices were also expressed as percentages to allow comparison between cetacean species and groups (e. g. dolphin sex and area of stranding). The results indicate that striped dolphins feed predominantly on small mesopelagic fish, mainly species of the Myctophidae family, although <b>pearlsides</b> (Maurolicus muelleri) were also present. Significant numbers of gobies (Gobiidae) were also found in the stomachs. Other prey identified were hake (Merluccius merluccius), silvery pout (Gadiculus argenteus), bogue (Boops boops) and scads (Trachurus spp.). Because of the degree of erosion of some otoliths they could not be identified to species level. Cephalopods were also found in the stomachs of striped dolphins with specimens of the families Brachioteuthidae, Chiroteuthidae, Sepiolidae, Ommastrephidae and Enoploteuthidae among others being identified from the remains. For common dolphin, myctophids were also important in the diet. Scads were also present. The 3 non-empty stomachs of Risso´s dolphin examined contained only cephalopod beaks (e. g. Todarodes sagittatus, several species of Histioteuthidae, Octopus vulgaris, etc.) confirming the teutophagous diet of this species already reported in other areas (Blanco et al., 2006) ...|$|E

Biopsychology ProgrammeBibliography: leaves 279 - 295 There is {{increased}} concern for harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) susceptibility to incidental mortality in commercial fisheries throughout their range. In {{order to obtain}} information on the incidental capture of harbour porpoise in the western North Atlantic, research was conducted in three fishing regions (St. Bride's, Newfoundland {{during the summer of}} 1993, Jeffreys Ledge in the Gulf of Maine during the fall of 1993 and Grand Manan Island in the Bay of Fundy during the summers of 1994 and 1995) where incidental capture of harbour porpoise in groundfish gillnets was occurring. Data were collected on the procedures used in fishing, the environmental conditions at the time of fishing, characteristics of the porpoise caught and the views of the fishermen regarding the issue of harbour porpoise incidental capture in their nets. [...] A total of 124 harbour porpoises were captured during 465 observer days when 17, 363 nets were hauled. Over three seasons, significant relationships were found between harbour porpoise capture, duration of net soak time and distance of net placement from shore. The depth at which the net was set and the number of nets in a string were related to harbour porpoise bycatch over two seasons. Target species capture varied between seasons, altering the relationship of target species fish and bycatch. For one of the two seasons where mesh size varied, it showed a relationship to harbour porpoise bycatch. Of 85 animals retrieved, 50 were male and 35 female. Lengths and weights of females were greater than males. Estimated age of animals ranged from 0 to 7 + years. Of the total number, 64 % of the porpoises were sexually mature, 23 % were immature, and 13 % were calves. [...] Newfoundland porpoise primarily foraged for capelin, sand lance and herring, while Gulf of Maine/Jeffreys Ledge animals ate <b>pearlsides,</b> silver hake and herring; in the Grand Manan Island/Bay of Fundy region the diet was primarily Atlantic herring and silver hake. Atlantic herring occurred in 80 % of the stomachs analyzed and was the longest prey fish (44 - 332 mm). [...] Environmental data were collected over the 159 days of the study. Bycatch of the harbour porpoise was correlated with wind speed during both seasons in Grand Manan Island/Bay of Fundy, with cloud cover during the 1993 summer season in Newfoundland, and with water temperature during the 1994 Grand Manan Island/Bay of Fundy season. [...] Assessment of elapsed time since death was undertaken to examine the diagnostic usefulness of the vitreous humour and core body temperature in determining postmortem interval.

Vitreous humour glucose decreased from antemortem serum values, and the level was positively correlated with core temperature. Potassium and magnesium increased from antemortem serum values. Data suggest nearly all the animals had been dead for several hours.

40|$|During {{the second}} half of 1979 T. sagittatus invaded the eastern Norwegian Sea, the {{northern}} North Sea and the coastal and bank areas of the Faroes, Iceland and Norway. The squid stayed in parts of the areas at least to the end of April 1980. Materials for investigation were collected during research cruises off western and northern Norway in October, and in other areas from July 1979 to the middle of April 1980. Squid were also obtained from the commercial fishery and from the weather ship "Polarfront" at st. M in the Norwegian Sea. Data from the Faroes were kindly supplied by Mr. H. i Jakupsstovu. The mean mantle length increased from about 23 cm in August to 41 - 42 cm in February-April. The maximum individual length of 50 cm was observed in April. The mean monthly growth during different periods was calculated for the females. In August-September it was 5 - 7 cm, October-January 2, 3 cm, January-February 1, 5 cm, August-February 3, 0 cm. Males were on average 2 - 3 cm shorter in mantle length than the females. In northern Norway the average mantle length was somewhat larger in October- November 1978 and 1979 than {{at the same time in}} 1977 and 1972. The mean total weight increased from about 280 g in August to 420 - 540 g in September and further to 1300 g in February. A female with mantle length of 50 cm and weighing 3130 g was taken in April. The length-weight curve was calculated from the relationship W=aLb. a= 0. 02, b- 3. 01. The liver weight varied considerably, both individually and between samples, but the mean weight was mostly below 10 % of the total weight, except off northern Norway, Males were few, constituting 4 - 11 % of the samples along the Norwegian coast and in the Norwegian Sea, but about 26 % near the Hebrides in November. Nearly all were immature, but a few with developing gonads, weight 10 - 20 g, were found in January-February. Males, even small ones, are easily recognized in the catches by the poor quality of the skin which deteriorates and becomes chapped shortly after the catch. Food items in stomach contents were similar to those identified in earlier years. Fish dominated, herring, sprat, redfish, blue whiting and <b>pearlside</b> being most abundant. Squid ranged second, in Norwegian waters T. sagittatus, in the Norwegian Sea Gonatus -fabricii, and at the Hebrides, octopods. Various other organisms were identified, e. g. krill, deep-sea prawns and other shrimps, amphipods, polychaetes and chaetognaths. Age determinations from statoliths are in progress, but the interpretation is constantly difficult. It is assumed that the squid spawns at an age of 1 - 1 1 / 2 years. Observations with underwater TV indicated that the squid is very voracious, attacking various kinds of bait, including squid, and remaining on the bait for up to half an hour. Fishing technique is improving, and marketing for human consumption, both domestic and for export, is increasing...|$|R
50|$|In the North Atlantic, they {{primarily}} eat small schooling fish, demersal fish, and krill. A 2007 {{study showed}} that off Spitsbergen they fed almost exclusively on members of the euphausiid genus Thysanoessa (mainly T. inermis), but nearly a fifth also fed on small amounts of capelin. A small percentage of individuals, by decreasing frequency, also fed on polar cod, Atlantic cod, haddock, and copepods. Capelin dominated off Bear Island and in the southern Barents Sea, accounting for about three-quarters of their diet in both regions. Nearly half (nearly 46 per cent) also consumed euphausiids (Thysanoessa spp.) in the former area - haddock (12.5%), blue whiting (8.3%), polar cod, Atlantic cod, Atlantic herring, and copepods constituted the rest. Herring and haddock were also taken in the southern Barents Sea (accounting for 41.5 and 28.7 per cent by frequency of occurrence, respectively), while sandeel (Ammodytes spp.), Atlantic cod, copepods, euphausiids, pollock, and blue whiting made {{up the rest of}} the diet. In the Norwegian Sea, herring was found in all individuals sampled (n= 10), with some (20 per cent each) also feeding on a small amount of capelin and blue whiting - an earlier study, based on data primarily obtained between 1943-1945, showed that they fed exclusively on herring off Vesterålen, while the diet off Lofoten was more varied, including herring (34 per cent by occurrence), pelagic crustaceans (23%), Atlantic cod (22%), haddock (6%), and a mixture of coalfish and flatfish for one individual (1.5%). In the North Sea, they primarily fed on sandeel (62%) and Atlantic mackerel (nearly 30%), with some feeding on herring (16.2%), small amounts of Mueller's <b>pearlside</b> (10.8%), copepods, haddock, capelin, and whiting. They were found to feed almost exclusively on Atlantic mackerel in the northern North Sea, while the same was true for sandeel in the eastern North Sea. Off Iceland, they mainly fed on sandeel (nearly 58 per cent of sampled individuals), haddock (22.6%), herring (20%), capelin (19.4%), and Atlantic cod (14.7%), with the rest of the diet consisting of euphausiids, various larger species of gadiods, and Norway pout. Sandeel was more important in southern Iceland (constituting 78 per cent of sampled individuals), while capelin (35.1%), haddock (28.7%), and cod (22.3%) were more important in the north. Euphausiids were only consumed in the north. Although haddock was only a minor part of the diet the first couple years of the study (0 and 4% in 2003 and 2004, respectively), it subsequently constituted a major component of it (31-35% in 2005-2007), while sandeel's importance in the south declined considerably (95.2 to 77.7% from 2003-2006, but only 18.1% in 2007). Off southeastern Greenland, they only fed on capelin, while sandeel dominated off southwestern Greenland. In a sample of 172 minke whales caught off Newfoundland between 1966 and 1972, the vast majority (85%) fed only on fish, mainly capelin. Some fed on a mixture of capelin and cod, while others had only consumed cod. Other gadiods, herring, krill, and squid formed the rest of the diet.|$|R
40|$|During {{the second}} half of 1980 T. sagittatus invaded the northeastern Norwegian Sea and {{adjacent}} coastal areas in great abundance. The invasion coincided with the occurrence of large quantities of salps. Squid still remained in coastal waters in January 1981. Materials for investigation were obtained from research cruises in northeast Atlantic waters in April - May, in the North Sea in July, and in the Norwegian Sea and coastal waters of Norway in August - December. Length and weight. The mean dorsal mantle length (DML) of squid hatched during the autumn of 1979 increased from 16 - 18 cm in April to 31 - 32 cm (males) and 35 - 38 cm (females) in December. A specimen of DML 59 cm and weight (W) of 5300 g was reported caught in October. The relation between weight and mantle length W = a(DML) b was calculated on material from 1979 - 1980. Males (DML 17 - 41 cm) : a = 0. 0181, b = 3. 0181, r 2 = 0. 9447. Females (DML 14. 5 - 50 cm) : a = 0. 0180, b = 3. 0170, r 2 = 0. 9419. Liver weight. On the Porcupine Bank and at st. M in the Norwegian Sea the liver averagely constituted about 7 % of the total weight, in other areas 9 - 10 %, with individual variations of 3. 7 - 17. 2 %. Sex proportions. In fjords and coastal areas males constituted 0 - 10 %, on the banks about 13 %, in oceanic areas 22 - 28 %. The low proportion of males in the fjords is ascribed to cannibalism. Maturation. In April - May, males with DML above 30 cm were maturing, most of them with spermatophores developed. In October - November a few large males had developing testes. During July - December all females taken were immature. In April - May about 50 % of females with DML above 35 cm were maturing or mature, with nidamental glands 50 - 100 mm in length. One female with DML 44 cm had eggs (oocytes) in maturity stage 3. Total number in the ovisac was calculated to 84 500, considerably above earlier literature records. Stomach contents. As recorded earlier, fish were most common. Blue whiting, <b>pearlside,</b> Notoscopelus krøyeri, Notolepis rissoi krøyeri, redfish, herring or sprat and whiting were identified. Of squid, T. sagittatus, Gonatus fabricii and small octopods were found. Of other organisms krill and Hyperiids were most common. Pasiphaea sp., Pareuchaeta sp., Nereis sp., Eukrohnia sp. were also identified. Age. A report on daily rings in the statoliths has been published. The age readings revealed two main periods of hatching, September - November and April - June, but reproduction also occurs at other times of the year. Squid caught in October, are probably one year or less of age, but the specimen with DML 59 cm might be 11 / 2 - 2 years old. Fishery. In 1980 the fishery yielded 2 500 m. tons. The possible yield was estimated to 25 - 50 000 tons...|$|R
