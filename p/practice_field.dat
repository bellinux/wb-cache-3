5|$|Texas {{honored the}} Texas horned lizard in 1993, but private Texas Christian University {{has had the}} {{associated}} mascot the Horned Frog since 1896. According to legend, the football team identified with the lizards found on the <b>practice</b> <b>field</b> as the athletes and reptiles were similarly scrappy. The college founder's son, Addison Clark Jr., a faculty member and the initiator of the football team, had been fascinated by the creatures. By 1897, the lizard appeared as a logo {{on the front of}} the school yearbook, which Clark had also started and was managing.|$|E
5|$|The team {{conducted}} intense preparations {{during the}} spring and fall practices before the 1940 season. On one occasion, Stanford athletic director Al Masters angrily complained that the maintenance department had left on the <b>practice</b> <b>field</b> lights, only to be told that the team was still practicing. In one scrimmage, the varsity offense managed only a single touchdown against the freshman team, which prompted Shaughnessy to secretly draft a single-wing playbook in the event that the T formation failed.|$|E
5|$|For the 2017–18 school year, the Florida State Athletics Department budgeted $103.2 {{million for}} its sports teams and {{facilities}} and currently brings in over $121.3 million in revenues. Florida State University {{is known for}} its competitive athletics in both men's and women's sports competitions. The men's program consists of baseball, basketball, cross country running, football, golf, swimming, tennis, and track & field. The women's program consists of basketball, cross country running, golf, soccer, softball, swimming, tennis, track & field, and volleyball. FSU's Intercollegiate Club sports include bowling, crew, rugby, soccer and lacrosse. Harkins Field is an artificial turf field that is home to the lacrosse team as well as serving as the <b>practice</b> <b>field</b> for the Marching Chiefs of the College of Music and the football team.|$|E

50|$|The LSU Outdoor <b>Practice</b> <b>Fields</b> {{consist of}} four outdoor <b>practice</b> <b>fields</b> that are {{directly}} {{adjacent to the}} football operations center and indoor practice facility. Three of the fields are natural grass, while the fourth has a Momentum Field Turf by SportExe playing surface.|$|R
5|$|In {{the days}} prior to the game, both teams {{had to cope with}} harsh winter weather in the Nashville area. Virginia Tech was forced to move {{practices}} indoors when an ice storm arrived on the day before Christmas. The storm caused travel delays for fans and players alike. Alabama's first practices in Nashville were held without the full team available because many players had been delayed. The harsh weather continued through the day of the game, and Tech was forced to cancel its final outdoor practice before the game. Alabama, meanwhile, drove 45 minutes to Murfreesboro to a <b>practice</b> <b>field</b> that was not covered by ice.|$|E
5|$|Maud W. Gordon Elementary School in Bellaire {{does not}} have a zoning boundary; before 2012 it drew excess {{students}} from apartments west of Bellaire, in Houston, to relieve other schools in Houston west of Bellaire such as Benavidez, Cunningham, Elrod, and Milne. From its opening to 1953 to 1983 Gordon served as a neighborhood school. After its closure Gordon temporarily housed the Post Oak School and later served as administrative offices. It re-opened as a relief school in 1988 for Elrod and Cunningham schools. It was scheduled to re-open in September of that year. In 2012 HISD opened the Mandarin Chinese Language Immersion Magnet School Chinese language-immersion magnet school, in the former Gordon Elementary building. It is HISD's first Chinese immersion school. The school was scheduled to move to the St. George Place area of Houston; it was scheduled to open in August 2016. In 2017 HISD announced plans to demolish the Gordon/former MIMS campus so Bellaire High School's baseball <b>practice</b> <b>field</b> could be relocated there, allowing HISD to easily rebuild the high school main campus.|$|E

25|$|On 10 November 2014, the Bloomington {{city council}} voted 5-4 to {{purchase}} four {{acres of land}} near McGraw Park in Empire Business park using state funds and to rent the land to CCHS {{for use as a}} football <b>practice</b> <b>field.</b> The council voted with the understanding that the current football <b>practice</b> <b>field</b> on land owned by the Central Illinois Regional Airport was in a Federal Aviation Agency restricted flight path zone and the school would have to move to another location in 2015. In 2009, state senator and CCHS alum Bill Brady had arranged a $750,000 state legislative grant for the purchase as part of a General Assembly capital bill. Alderman Jim Fruin, another CCHS alum, voted in favor. CCHS agreed to spend at least $20,000 to improve the land, pay an annual rent of $1,700, as well as maintain, mow, and clean the field. The annual cost to the city was estimated to be $2,500 and the land was {{to be used as a}} park when not in use by the school.|$|E
25|$|After Chevron Corporation {{announced}} it was selling its office complex in Bellaire in 2016, HISD officials considered the idea of buying the property so a new Bellaire High School could be built there. Instead HISD decided to rebuild Bellaire High on its current site. In 2017 HISD announced plans to demolish the Gordon Elementary School/former Mandarin Immersion Magnet School campus in Bellaire so Bellaire High School's baseball <b>practice</b> <b>field</b> could be relocated there, allowing HISD to easily rebuild the high school main campus.|$|E

25|$|When {{learning}} {{positions for}} drill, an American football field may {{be divided into}} a 5-yard grid, with the yard lines serving as one set of guides. The locations where the perpendicular grid lines cross the yard lines, sometimes called zero points or gacks, may be marked on a <b>practice</b> <b>field</b> at eight-, four-, or two-step intervals. Alternately, band members may only use field markings—yard lines, the center line, hash marks, and yard numbers—as guides (but note that different leagues put these markings in different places).|$|E
25|$|The trend would reverse {{again as}} George Young {{took over the}} {{coaching}} duties in 1959. Young had actually been a history teacher at City, but an assistant coach at rival Calvert Hall College. Young brought discipline back to the <b>practice</b> <b>field</b> and an emphasis on grades. He also brought in young aggressive special teams coaches Joe Brune, Bob Patzwall, Mel Filler, and Ed Novak; all of whom would become head coaches later in their careers with Brune coaching the Loyola Dons for more than 25 years.|$|E
25|$|Athletic {{facilities}} are distributed throughout {{a number of}} buildings on campus. Mabee Gym houses an extensive indoor rowing facility, an indoor golf practice facility, and volleyball practice gyms. Renovations in spring 2008 incorporated FieldTurf into an indoor <b>practice</b> <b>field</b> for the soccer, softball, and football programs. The tennis teams are housed in the Michael D. Case Tennis Center, which includes a number of indoor and outdoor courts (and spectator seating for 2,000). The Hurricane Soccer & Track Stadium {{is home to the}} track and field and soccer programs.|$|E

25|$|No Oakland player wore Russell's #2 {{during the}} regular season for several years after his release; only punter Marquette King donned it, during Oakland's 2012 preseason before being placed on season-ending injured reserve. In 2011, newly drafted quarterback Terrelle Pryor's request to wear #2 was turned down by then-coach Hue Jackson; it is widely {{believed}} that the Raiders did not want another highly touted quarterback wearing the same number as the disappointing Russell. However, in 2013 Raiders coach Dennis Allen allowed Pryor to trade numbers with King; he debuted on Oakland's <b>practice</b> <b>field</b> on August 21, 2013 wearing the jersey number he had worn at Ohio State.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} the 2004 season, the Packers team depth {{appeared}} to be diminishing. Sherman also seemed overworked and reportedly had trouble communicating with players on the <b>practice</b> <b>field</b> with whom he was also negotiating contracts. Harlan felt the dual roles were too much for one man to handle and removed Sherman from the GM position in early 2005, while retaining him as a head coach. Harlan hired Seattle Seahawks Vice President of Operations Ted Thompson as the new Executive Vice President, General Manager and Director of Football Operations. The relationship between Thompson and Sherman appeared strained, as Thompson immediately began rebuilding Green Bay's roster. Following a dismal 4–12 season, Thompson fired Sherman.|$|E
25|$|KU {{football}} {{dates from}} 1890, and {{has played in}} the Orange Bowl three times: 1948, 1968, and 2008. They are currently coached by David Beaty, who was hired in 2014. In 2008, {{under the leadership of}} Mark Mangino, the #7 Jayhawks emerged victorious in their first BCS bowl game, the FedEx Orange Bowl, with a 24–21 victory over the #3 Virginia Tech Hokies. This capstone victory marked the end of the most successful season in school history, in which the Jayhawks went 12–1 (.923). The team plays at Memorial Stadium, which recently underwent a $31 million renovation to add the Anderson Family Football Complex, adding a football practice facility adjacent to the stadium complete with indoor partial <b>practice</b> <b>field,</b> weight room, and new locker room.|$|E

25|$|During {{the second}} summer {{session at the}} University, both Moore and Sharpe began to work with players on the {{offensive}} change, and in August Royal and Bellard traveled to Tuscaloosa and led a coaching clinic for the Alabama staff on the wishbone. In {{order to keep the}} change a secret, Bryant closed all of the Crimson Tide's practices closed from the public, screened the <b>practice</b> <b>field</b> from view with a canvas and hired security to keep people away. The change to the wishbone was kept under such secrecy that when the media would visit practice, Bryant had the team practice the pro-style system that was phased out. Alabama later opened the season with an upset victory over USC that was credited to the surprise switch to the wishbone that caught the Trojans off-guard.|$|E
25|$|George Petrides, a 1967 City College graduate, {{served as}} head {{football}} coach from 1975 until he retired in 2015. His 40-year tenure was longer than the previous 10 coaches combined. During the 1960s, Petrides played on City College teams that never lost a game, but {{at the beginning of}} his coaching career, he was faced with almost impossible circumstances. The City College main academic building was being renovated forcing enrollment to plummet and the student body to take courses at the old Poly building on North Avenue in midtown Baltimore. The athletic <b>practice</b> <b>field</b> was two miles (3km) away, and in 1979 Petrides was forced to use his junior varsity team to play Poly's varsity because of the dwindling enrollment. The Castle on the Hill reopened in 1978 but the Knights did not manage a win against Poly again until 1987.|$|E
25|$|On May 2, 2009 {{during the}} rookie mini-camp, the Cowboys air-supported roof <b>practice</b> <b>field</b> (a tent-like structure) {{collapsed}} during a storm {{that turned into}} a microburst. At {{the time of the}} incident, there were around 70 people inside (team personnel, coaches, rookie players and media), leaving 12 people injured. The most serious injuries were suffered by scouting assistant Rich Behm, who was left paralyzed from the waist down after his spine was severed, DeCamillis, the special teams coach, fractured one of his cervical vertebrae and Greg Gaither, the assistant athletic trainer, sustained a fracture to the tibia and fibula in his right leg. The facility was completely destroyed and was never rebuilt. After the incident fallout, Summit Structures, its parent company Cover-All Building Systems and the consulting firm JCI (helped design reinforcements) all filed for bankruptcy after serious structural flaws were found with the construction and manufacturing of the facility.|$|E
50|$|In 2009 {{plans were}} made {{to build a new}} single-building school.

The new building was completed in mid-2011 and students were officially moved in during January 2012. The old campus was then promptly demolished, this area now serves as parking and <b>practice</b> <b>fields.</b>|$|R
