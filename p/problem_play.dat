There had developed a growing popular and political movement to deal with the issue, and out of this policy to relocate certain Indian populations. Jackson, never known for timidity, became an advocate for this relocation policy in what many historians consider the most controversial aspect of his presidency.|$|E

2500|$|Many {{consider}} Shakespeare's Cleopatra, whom Enobarbus {{describes as}} having [...] "infinite variety", {{as one of}} the most complex and fully developed female characters in the playwright's body of work. She is frequently vain and histrionic enough to provoke an audience almost to scorn; at the same time, Shakespeare invests her and Antony with tragic grandeur. These contradictory features have led to famously divided critical responses. It is difficult to classify Antony and Cleopatra as belonging to a single genre. It can be described as a history play (though it does not completely adhere to historical accounts), as a tragedy (though not completely in Aristotelian terms), as a comedy, as a romance, and according to some critics, e.g. McCarter, a <b>problem</b> <b>play.</b> All one can say with certainty is that it is a Roman play, even a sequel to another of Shakespeare's tragedies, Julius Caesar.|$|E

60|$|I {{remember}} witnessing long ago, in {{a country}} barn, a highly moral play. It was a <b>Problem</b> <b>Play,</b> now I {{come to think of}} it. At least, that is, {{it would have been a}} <b>Problem</b> <b>Play</b> but that the party with the past happened in this case to be merely a male thing. Stage life presents no problems to the man. The hero of the <b>Problem</b> <b>Play</b> has not got to wonder what to do; he has got to wonder only what the heroine will do next. The hero--he was not exactly the hero; he would have been the hero had he not been hanged in the last act. But for that he was rather a nice young man, full of sentiment and not ashamed of it. From the scaffold he pleaded for leave to embrace his mother just once more before he died. It was a pretty idea. The hangman himself was touched. The necessary leave was granted him. He descended the steps and flung his arms round the sobbing old lady, and--bit off her nose. After that he told her why he had bitten off her nose. It appeared that when he was a boy, he had returned home one evening with a rabbit in his pocket. Instead of putting him across her knee, and working into him the eighth commandment, she had said nothing; but that it seemed to be a fairly useful sort of rabbit, and had sent him out into the garden to pick onions. If she had done her duty by him then, he would not have been now in his present most unsatisfactory position, and she would still have had her nose. The fathers and mothers in the audience applauded, but the children, scenting addition to precedent, looked glum.|$|E

60|$|In this {{expectant}} hush, {{a man in}} a check tweed suit {{walks on}} the stage: only one man, one single man. Because if he had been accompanied by a chorus, {{that would have been a}} burlesque; if four citizens in togas had been with him, that would have been Shakespeare; if two Russian soldiers had walked after him, that would have been melodrama. But this is none of these. This is a <b>problem</b> <b>play.</b> So he steps in alone, all alone, and with that absolute finish of step, that ability to walk as if,--how can one express it?--as if he were walking, that betrays the finished actor.|$|E
6000|$|To {{take the}} plays first, {{there is a}} general {{disposition}} to describe that type of intimate or defiant drama which he approves as [...] "the problem play." [...] Now the serious modern play is, as a rule, the very reverse of a problem play; for there can be no problem unless both points of view are equally and urgently presented. Hamlet really is a <b>problem</b> <b>play</b> because {{at the end of it}} one is really in doubt as to whether upon the author's showing Hamlet is something more than a man or something less. Henry IV and Henry V are really problem plays; in this sense, that the reader or spectator is really doubtful whether the high but harsh efficiency, valour, and ambition of Henry V are an improvement on his old blackguard camaraderie; and whether he was not a better man when he was a thief. This hearty and healthy doubt is very common in Shakespeare; I mean a doubt that exists in the writer as well as in the reader. But Bernard Shaw is far too much of a Puritan to tolerate such doubts about points which he counts essential. There is no sort of doubt that the young lady in Arms and the Man is improved by losing her ideals. There is no sort of doubt that Captain Brassbound is improved by giving up the object of his life. But a better case can be found in something that both dramatists have been concerned with; Shaw wrote Cæsar and Cleopatra; Shakespeare wrote Antony and Cleopatra and also Julius Cæsar. And exactly what annoys Bernard Shaw about Shakespeare's version is this: that Shakespeare has an open mind or, in other words, that Shakespeare has really written a <b>problem</b> <b>play.</b> Shakespeare sees quite as clearly as Shaw that Brutus is unpractical and ineffectual; but he also sees, what is quite as plain and practical a fact, that these ineffectual men do capture the hearts and influence the policies of mankind. Shaw would have nothing said in favour of Brutus; because Brutus is on the wrong side in politics. Of the actual problem of public and private morality, as it was presented to Brutus, he takes actually no notice at all. He can write the most energetic and outspoken of propaganda plays; but he cannot rise to a <b>problem</b> <b>play.</b> He cannot really divide his mind and let the two parts speak independently to each other. He has never, so to speak, actually split his head in two; though I daresay there are many other people who are willing to do it for him.|$|E
6000|$|Certain it is {{that but}} for her father {{she would never have}} had a past. Failing anyone else on whom to lay the blame for {{whatever}} the lady may have done, we can generally fall back upon the father. He becomes our sheet-anchor, so to speak. There are plays in which at first sight it would almost appear there was nobody to blame--nobody, except the heroine herself. It all seems to happen just because she is no better than she ought to be: clearly, the father's fault! for ever having had a daughter no better than she ought to be. As the Heroine of a certain <b>Problem</b> <b>Play</b> once put it neatly and succinctly to the old man himself: [...] "It is you parents that make us children what we are." [...] She had him there. He had not a word to answer for himself, but went off centre, leaving his hat behind him.|$|E
