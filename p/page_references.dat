Especially well represented are sets from New England and Florida. The collection is rich in sets of raptor eggs, including bald eagles, ospreys, broad-winged hawks, red-shouldered hawks, northern caracaras, American kestrels, the Florida races of seaside sparrows and clapper rails. Rarities include sets of passenger pigeon, Carolina parakeet, and Bachman's warbler eggs.|$|E

40|$|Flash {{solid-state}} drives (SSDs) {{provide much}} faster {{access to data}} compared with traditional hard disk drives (HDDs). The current price and performance of SSD suggest it can be adopted as a data buffer between main memory and HD-D, and buffer management policy in such hybrid systems has attracted more and more interest from research commu-nity recently. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to manage the buffer in flash-based hybrid storage system-s, named Hotness Aware Hit (HAT). HAT exploits a <b>page</b> <b>reference</b> queue to record the access history {{as well as the}} status of accessed pages, i. e., hot, warm and cold. Addition-ally, the <b>page</b> <b>reference</b> queue is further split into hot and warm regions which correspond to the memory and flash in general. The HAT approach updates the page status and deals with the page migration in the memory hierarchy ac-cording to the current page status and hit position in the <b>page</b> <b>reference</b> queue. Our empirical evaluation on bench-mark traces demonstrates the superiority of the proposed strategy against the state-of-the-art competitors...|$|R

Quayle criticized Gore's book Earth in the Balance with specific <b>page</b> <b>references,</b> though his claims were subsequently criticized by the liberal group FAIR for inaccuracy. Quayle's closing argument sharply asked voters, [...] "Do you really believe Bill Clinton will tell the truth?" [...] and [...] "Do you trust Bill Clinton to be your president?", whereas Gore and Stockdale talked more about the policies and philosophies they espoused. Republican loyalists were largely relieved and pleased with Quayle's performance, and the Vice President's camp attempted to portray it as an upset triumph against a veteran debater. However, post-debate polls were mixed on whether Gore, Stockdale or Quayle had won. It ultimately {{proved to be a}} minor factor in the election, which Bush and Quayle subsequently lost.|$|E
