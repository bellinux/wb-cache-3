40|$|Introduction: TASH using {{alcohol is}} {{established}} as a highly effective procedure {{in the treatment of}} patients with HOCM worldwide. However there is often produced a complete heart block with need of permanent pacemaker implantation by the procedure. TASH using polyvinyl alcohol <b>foam</b> <b>particles</b> represents a catheter-based therapeutic option in severely symptomatic patients. Therefore this study sought to determine the outcome of this procedure regarding safety and efficacy. Methods: This is the report of 49 patients with HOCM treated by TASH using PVA <b>foam</b> <b>particles</b> in the department of Internal Medicine/Cardiology (German Heart Institute Berlin) between 1998 and 2009. Our analysis gives a comprehensive overview of interventional data, acute- and long-term results as well as complications, event-free survival and survival rate. Results: During the procedure a total amount of 150 to 250 microns of PVA <b>foam</b> <b>particles</b> was injected on average 1, 8 septal arteries (Contour Emboli; Boston Scientific). On average, post procedural serum CK peaked at 414, 4 U/L and CK-MB to 64, 8 U/L. The resting pressure gradient (invasive assessment) was significantly reduced by 81, 6 % (p < 0, 0001). There was no in-hospital mortality or early mortality (within 30 days). In addition during follow-up time patients had a significant reduction of NYHA functional class, LVOTG and IVS thickness. Furthermore no complete heart block with need of permanent pacemaker implantation occurred. Repeat TASH procedures using PVA <b>foam</b> <b>particles</b> were needed in 10 patients (23, 3 %). The cumulative 1 - and 5 -year survival rate after TASH were 97, 4 %. Conclusion: Our data shows that TASH using PVA <b>foam</b> <b>particles</b> successfully and safety relieves LVOTG and improves symptoms of patients. Interestingly there were no TASH-induced AV-conduction disturbances with need of permanent pacemaker implantation.

50|$|In {{addition}} to medicine, biodegradable polymers {{are often used}} to reduce the volume of waste in packaging materials. There is also significant effort to replace materials derived from petrochemicals with those {{that can be made}} from biodegradable components. One of the most commonly used polymers for packaging purposes is polylactic acid, PLA.

BASF markets a product called ecovio® which is a biobased blend of the company's certified compostable and biodegradable co-polyester ecoflex® and PLA.

40|$|We {{conducted}} forced drainage {{experiments to}} study the liquid flow within the foams stabilized by a cationic surfactant (CTAB) {{in the presence of}} partially hydrophobic silica particles. The results show that the presence of solid particles, even when present in small amounts (0. 0932 g L foam), can significantly decrease the foam permeability. The scaling behaviour (power law) between the drainage velocity and the imposed flow rate indicates that the presence of solid <b>particles</b> in the <b>foams</b> triggers a transition of the foam drainage regime from a node-dominated regime to a Plateau border-dominated regime. We applied two foam drainage equations for aqueous foams to simulate the experimental data and interpret the transition. The simulation results show that the presence of solid <b>particles</b> in the <b>foams</b> increases the rigidity of the interfaces and the viscous losses in the channels (the Plateau borders) of the foams, and decreases the foam permeability.

40|$|It is {{commonly}} known that Pickering emulsions are extremely stable against coalescence and are, therefore, potentially interesting for {{the synthesis of}} new materials, such as colloidosomes, microcapsules, composite <b>particles,</b> <b>foams,</b> and so on. However, for the efficient synthesis of such materials, one also has to consider the colloidal stability against aggregation, which is often neglected. In this study, it is demonstrated that steric stabilization is provided to Pickering emulsion droplets by the adsorption of poly(styrene-block-ethylene-co-propylene) (pS-b-EP) {{and that it is}} a requirement for the efficient synthesis of polymeric microcapsules. Monodisperse polystyrene particles of 648 nm are synthesized by soap-free emulsion polymerization. A model Pickering emulsion is then formed by the addition of sodium chloride at a critical concentration of 325 mM and mixing it with either heptane or decane. Subsequently, pS-b-EP is added to the Pickering emulsion to provide steric stabilization. Size exclusion chromatography is used to prove and quantify the adsorption of pS-b-EP onto the Pickering emulsion droplets. A maximum surface coverage of 1. 3 mg/m 2 is obtained after 2 h, which is approximately one-third of the adsorption on a pure pS surface. We believe that the presence of polar sulfate groups on the particle, which initially stabilized the particle in water, reduces the adsorption of pS-b-EP. Microcapsules are formed by heating the Pickering emulsion above the glass-transition temperature of the particles. Significant aggregation is observed, if no pS-b-EP is used. The adsorption of pS-b-EP provides steric stabilization to the Pickering emulsion droplets, reduces aggregation significantly, and ultimately leads to the successful and efficient synthesis of pS microcapsules...|$|R
40|$|Materials such as foams, {{concentrated}} emulsions, dense suspensions {{or colloidal}} gels, are yield stress fluids. Their steady flow behavior, characterized by standard rheometric techniques, is usually modeled by a Herschel-Bulkley law. The emergence of techniques {{that allow the}} measurement of their local flow properties (velocity and volume fraction fields) has led to observe new complex behaviors. It was shown {{that many of these}} materials exhibit shear banding in a homogeneous shear stress field, which cannot be accounted for by the standard steady-state constitutive laws of simple yield stress fluids. In some cases, it was also observed that the velocity fields under various conditions cannot be modeled with a single constitutive law and that nonlocal models are needed to describe the flows. Doubt may then be cast on any macroscopic characterization of such systems, and one may wonder if any material behaves in some conditions as a Herschel-Bulkley material. In this paper, we address the question of the existence of a simple yield stress fluid behavior. We first review experimental results from the literature and we point out the main factors (physical properties, experimental procedure) at the origin of flow inhomogeneities and nonlocal effects.

Thanks to controlled particle chemistry and production devices, {{we are able to}} generate large volumes of such foams. We previously investigated some of their unique properties, especially the strongly reduced coarsening. Here we report another type of study on these foams: performing diffusing wave spectroscopy (DWS), we investigate {{for the first time the}} internal dynamics on the scales of both the particles and the bubbles. When compared to surfactant foams, unusual features are observed; in particular, two well-separated modes are found in the dynamics, both evolving with foam aging. We propose an interpretation of these specificities, taking into account both the scattering by free <b>particles</b> in the <b>foam</b> fluid (fast mode), and by the foam structure (slow mode). To validate our interpretation, we show that independent measurements of the interstitial fluid scattering length, obtained indirectly on the foam and directly on the drained liquid, are in good agreement.

Counter-intuitively, the fraction of free <b>particles</b> within the <b>foam</b> interstitial fluid has to be very low to get an optimal signature of these particles on the DWS correlation curves. This study also sheds light on the partitioning of the <b>particles</b> inside the <b>foams</b> and at the interfaces, as the foam ages.

These studies were conducted using both bulk and interfacial rheology, XRD, sessile droplet, TGA and UV-vis. Two novel and simple techniques, lamella break point and capillary breakup extensional rheometry, were used to both understand the Laponite Pluronic L 62 interaction and determine a different mechanism for foaming properties. Bulk rheological properties identified an optimal Laponite concentration of 2 % with Pluronic L 62 ranging from 2. 5 % and 6. 5 %, due to the ease of flow for the dispersion. The Pluronic L 62 was observed to enhance the Laponite bulk rheological properties in solution. Additionally TGA showed a similar trend in thermal resistance to water with both addition of Laponite and Pluronic L 62. XRD demonstrated that 0. 25 % Pluronic intercalated into Laponite from dried 2 % Laponite films. XRD demonstrated that the Laponite matrix was saturated at 1 % Pluronic L 62. UV-vis demonstrated that a monolayer of Pluronic L 62 is observed up to 0. 65 % Pluronic L 62 onto Laponite. Interfacial rheology showed that Laponite enhances Pluronic L 62 at the air-liquid interface by improving the storage modulus as low at 0. 65 % Pluronic L 62 with 2 % Laponite.

40|$|International audienceMaterials such as foams, {{concentrated}} emulsions, dense suspensions {{or colloidal}} gels, are yield stress fluids. Their steady flow behavior, characterized by standard rheometric techniques, is usually modeled by a Herschel-Bulkley law. The emergence of techniques {{that allow the}} measurement of their local flow properties (velocity and volume fraction fields) has led to observe new complex behaviors. It was shown {{that many of these}} materials exhibit shear banding in a homogeneous shear stress field, which cannot be accounted for by the standard steady-state constitutive laws of simple yield stress fluids. In some cases, it was also observed that the velocity fields under various conditions cannot be modeled with a single constitutive law and that nonlocal models are needed to describe the flows. Doubt may then be cast on any macroscopic characterization of such systems, and one may wonder if any material behaves in some conditions as a Herschel-Bulkley material. In this paper, we address the question of the existence of a simple yield stress fluid behavior. We first review experimental results from the literature and we point out the main factors (physical properties, experimental procedure) at the origin of flow inhomogeneities and nonlocal effects. It leads us to propose a well-defined procedure to ensure that steady-state bulk properties of the materials are studied. We use this procedure to investigate yield stress fluid flows with MRI techniques. We focus on nonthixotropic dense suspensions of soft <b>particles</b> (<b>foams,</b> concentrated emulsions, Carbopol gels). We show that, {{as long as they are}} studied in a wide (as compared to the size of the material mesoscopic elements) gap geometry, these materials behave as 'simple yield stress fluids': they are homogeneous, they do not exhibit steady-state shear banding, and their steady flow behavior in simple shear can be modeled by a local continuous monotonic constitutive equation which accounts for flows in various conditions and matches the macroscopic response...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Silica {{suspensions}} were foamed in {{a dynamic}} rotor-stator mixer {{in an attempt}} to model the effects of pigment <b>particles</b> on the <b>foam</b> application pro-cess. Results of foamability, bubble size, foam rheology, and foam stability studies are presented. Suspensions have been foamed with various concentrations of silica. Foams have been generated with various blow ratios or with various rotational speeds of the mixer. It has been found that silica particles affect these four foam properties.

40|$|A {{new concept}} of {{chemical}} foaming is {{proposed for the}} preparation of geopolymers with fine porosity. The use of an interactive powder mixture of gas releasing agent and carrier particles, potentially combines the benefits of small point sources of gas with easy homogenization in the fresh geopolymer. This concept was exploited here for the preparation of porous flyash-based geopolymers. The interactive powder mixture was a SiC powder containing reactive submicron FeSi/FeSi 2 <b>particles.</b> Premature <b>foaming</b> was avoided due to prolonged induction period and slow reaction rate of the active phase. Samples were characterized using scanning electron microscopy, mercury porosimetry, tree-point bending tests and thermal conductivity measurements. In addition, total porosity was determined using measured apparent and real densities. It was found that fine pore structure (diameter 140 ± 80 μm) not normally obtained using chemical foaming, was achieved in a reproducible manner with this approach...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new foaming {{technology}} (solid-state foaming) to produce structural foams from waste thermosetting resins. The proposed technology is easy {{and does not}} require specific and expensive equipments. Solid tablets are produced by cold compaction of resin powder, and foam by heating in an oven. Composite foams can be produced by mixing fillers and resin powder before the cold compaction. In the experiment, an epoxy-polyester (EP-PE) resin powder, deriving from the waste of a manufacturer of domestic appliances, was used with montmorillonite (MMT) <b>particles.</b> Resulting <b>foams</b> with a filler content ranging from 0 to 10 wt% were characterized in terms of physical and mechanical properties (by compression tests). Although {{the effect of the}} MMT content seems to be negative for the adopted resin, the feasibility of producing composite foams by recycling waste industrial powders is shown. The properties of the unfilled foams are sufficient for many industrial applications...|$|R
