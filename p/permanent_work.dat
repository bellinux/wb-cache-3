Her grandfather, Andrew F. Stewart, {{was a master}} mechanic with the Chesapeake & Ohio Railway. Schlafly's father, John Bruce Stewart, was a machinist and salesman of industrial equipment, principally for Westinghouse. He became unemployed in 1932 during the Great Depression and could not find <b>permanent</b> <b>work</b> until World War II. He was granted a patent in 1944 for a rotary engine.|$|E

It houses {{exhibitions}} on parks and energy, and has interactive displays on how the pavilions' solar panels function and on renewable energy. There are exhibits with interactive web-based touch screens that depict the city's use of solar energy, and a dynamic multi-screen video presentation on electricity generation and usage. The building's atrium includes a sculpture by Chicago-based artists Patrick McGee and Adelheid Mers with three backlit [...] two-way mirrors. The sculpture, titled Heliosphere, Biosphere, Technosphere, is [...] "designed to interpret the links between the Earth's atmosphere, the solar system and scientific applications". It is the only <b>permanent</b> <b>work</b> of art by Chicago artists within the park.|$|E
500|$|In 1979, Parks Canada {{sponsored}} a competition for a <b>permanent</b> <b>work</b> to commemorate Captain George Vancouver, the first European to enter Burrard Inlet, in 1792. Guidelines for the competition required {{the use of}} permanent materials other than wood and that the work should [...] "not be in the likeness of a man". Hugh Faulkner, Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development during 1977–1979, offered the opportunity for the sculpture, and the project was recommended by the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada. Gate to the Northwest Passage was selected by a five-person jury, led by former parks superintendent Stuart Lefeaux, then confirmed by the Parks Board. The work was originally to be installed at Stanley Park's Ferguson Point, but was sited in Vanier Park adjacent to the Vancouver Maritime Museum in 1980.|$|E

500|$|The {{following}} month, on 5–6 December, Yavuz and Midilli provided {{protection for}} troop transports, and on 10 December, Yavuz bombarded Batum. On 23 December, Yavuz and [...] escorted three transports to Trebizond. While returning from another transport escort operation on 26 December, Yavuz struck a mine that exploded beneath the conning tower, on the starboard side, about one nautical mile outside the Bosphorus. The explosion tore a [...] {{hole in the}} ship's hull, but the torpedo bulkhead held. Two minutes later, Yavuz struck a second mine on the port side, just forward of the main battery wing barbette; this tore open a [...] hole. The bulkhead bowed in [...] but retained watertight protection of the ship's interior. However, some 600 tons of water flooded the ship. There was no dock in the Ottoman Empire large enough to service Yavuz, so temporary repairs were effected inside steel cofferdams, which were pumped out to create a dry work area around the damaged hull. The holes were patched with concrete, which held for several years before more <b>permanent</b> <b>work</b> was necessary.|$|E
500|$|On {{the day of}} Isabel {{moving through}} the state, President George W. Bush {{declared}} 18 counties and 14 independent cities as disaster areas, making residents and business-owners there eligible for federal funding. Additionally, funds were allocated {{for state and local}} governments in the 31 designated jurisdictions to pay 75% of the eligible cost for debris removal and emergency services related to the hurricane, including requested emergency work undertaken by the federal government. Many other jurisdictions were added, based on subsequent damage reports, and by September 22, 99 jurisdictions were eligible for disaster assistance. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) provided hurricane-related bulletins, including safety tips and the method for removing hazardous materials. By 12days after the passage of the hurricane, FEMA distributed more than 6.3million lbs. (2.9million kg) of ice and [...] of water to areas affected by Isabel. Disaster Recovery Centers, which contain information on the aftermath process, were opened in eight locations and received more than 1,850 inquiries. More than 350 FEMA inspectors visited homes to verify damages caused by Isabel, {{and by the end of}} September 2003 about 12,000 inspections were completed. In response to the power outages, FEMA installed 28 generators at disaster-affected critical public facilities to support life-sustaining community needs. By about four months after the hurricane, 93,139 individuals in the designated areas applied for disaster assistance, while 20,417people visited Disaster Recovery Centers throughout the state. The Small Business Administration approved more than 3,000 low-interest disaster loans from homes and businesses, with the value of the loans totaling $74million (2003USD; $87million 2008USD). The government provided $105million (2003USD; $123million 2008USD) for debris removal, emergency protective services, and <b>permanent</b> <b>work,</b> and approved about $25.9million (2003USD; $30.3million 2008USD) for life-sustaining needs such as water, ice, and generators at critical public facilities. Monetary assistance for temporary rental assistance and minimal home repairs totaled $32million (2003USD; $37million 2008USD), as well.|$|E
2500|$|Another famous work of Serra's is {{the mammoth}} {{sculpture}} Snake, {{a trio of}} sinuous steel sheets creating a curving path, permanently located in the largest gallery of the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao. In 2005, the museum mounted an exhibition of more of Serra's work, incorporating Snake into a collection entitled The Matter of Time. The whole work consists of eight sculptures measuring between 12 and 14 feet in height and weighing from 44 to 276 tons. Already in 1982-84, he had installed the <b>permanent</b> <b>work</b> La palmera in the Plaça de la Palmera in Barcelona.

2500|$|Yet {{there were}} {{long-term}} benefits for young Franck. [...] For {{it was from}} this period, extending back into his last Conservatoire years and forward beyond his return to Paris, that his first mature compositions emerged, a set of Trios (piano, violin, cello); these are {{the first of what}} he regarded as his <b>permanent</b> <b>work.</b> Liszt saw them, offered encouragement and constructive criticism, and performed them some years later in Weimar. [...] In 1843, Franck began work on his first non-chamber work, the oratorio Ruth. [...] It was privately premiered in 1845 before Liszt, Meyerbeer, and other musical notables, who gave moderate approval and constructive criticism. [...] However, a public performance in early 1846 met with public indifference and critical snubs for the oratorio's artlessness and simplicity. [...] The work was not performed again until 1872, after considerable revision.|$|E
2500|$|Unger’s airy {{and grand}} {{monument}} known as Ode to Tatlin was commissioned as a <b>permanent</b> <b>work</b> in 1991 by the Aaron Copland School of Music at Queens College in New York. The sculpture forms {{a gateway to}} the school {{in the shape of}} an ellipse sliced in half to leave an entrance in the middle. [...] It was inspired by Monument to the Third International, a grand building designed by the Russian artist Vladimir Tatlin that was never constructed. [...] It was meant to suggest staves of music and the supports of a rollercoaster with a swooping path that contrasts the drab and incoherent stretch of campus where it is situated. [...] Critics were not fond of the sherbet colors of the painted slats of the monument because they found the excessive amount of sweetness almost sickening; however, from farther away, they acknowledged the power and splendor it emanated in its commonplace surroundings.|$|E

6000|$|But are books {{the only}} channel {{through which the}} stream of {{intellectual}} usefulness can flow? Is the diffusion of truth to be estimated by publications; or publications by the truth, which they diffuse or at least contain? I speak it in the excusable warmth of a mind stung by an accusation, which has not only been advanced in reviews of the widest circulation, not only registered in the bulkiest works of periodical literature, but by frequency of repetition has become an admitted fact in private literary circles, and thoughtlessly repeated by too many who call themselves my friends, and whose own recollections ought to have suggested a contrary testimony. Would that the criterion of a scholar's utility were the number and moral value of the truths, {{which he has been}} the means of throwing into the general circulation; or the number and value of the minds, whom by his conversation or letters, he has excited into activity, and supplied with the germs of their after-growth! A distinguished rank might not indeed, even then, be awarded to my exertions; but I should dare look forward with confidence to an honourable acquittal. I should dare appeal to the numerous and respectable audiences, which at different times and in different places honoured my lecture rooms with their attendance, whether the points of view from which the subjects treated of were surveyed,--whether the grounds of my reasoning were such, as they had heard or read elsewhere, or have since found in previous publications. I can conscientiously declare, that the complete success of the REMORSE on the first night of its representation did not give me as great or as heart-felt a pleasure, as the observation that the pit and boxes were crowded with faces familiar to me, though of individuals whose names I did not know, and of whom I knew nothing, but that they had attended one or other of my courses of lectures. It is an excellent though perhaps somewhat vulgar proverb, that there are cases where a man may be as well [...] "in for a pound as for a penny." [...] To those, who from ignorance of the serious injury I have received from this rumour of having dreamed away my life to no purpose, injuries which I unwillingly remember at all, much less am disposed to record in a sketch of my literary life; or to those, who from their own feelings, or the gratification they derive from thinking contemptuously of others, would like job's comforters attribute these complaints, extorted from me by the sense of wrong, to self conceit or presumptuous vanity, I have already furnished such ample materials, that I shall gain nothing by withholding the remainder. I will not therefore hesitate to ask the consciences of those, who from their long acquaintance with me and with the circumstances are best qualified to decide or be my judges, whether the restitution of the suum cuique would increase or detract from my literary reputation. In this exculpation I hope to be understood as speaking of myself comparatively, and in proportion to the claims, which others are entitled to make on my time or my talents. By what I have effected, am I to be judged by my fellow men; what I could have done, is a question for my own conscience. On my own account I may perhaps have had sufficient reason to lament my deficiency in self-control, and the neglect of concentering my powers to the realization of some <b>permanent</b> <b>work.</b> But to verse rather than to prose, if to either, belongs the voice of mourning for ...|$|E
