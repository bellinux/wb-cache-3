50|$|There is no <b>provision</b> <b>for</b> <b>operation</b> {{during a}} power failure, when the base reverts to {{generator}} power. This would require limiting the output {{to less than}} or equal to what the generators can provide. Otherwise a cloud could pass over and cause the sudden drop in output to overload the generators, causing them to trip off. If a pumped-hydro facility was added in the nearby hills, that would allow the base to operate during power failures under solar power, although batteries would also be needed to allow time for the hydro-electric plant to adjust to the load requirements.|$|E

50|$|Although the {{description}} above has employed {{the notion that}} code may be generated with certain fields left to be fixed up later, there was an implicit assumption {{that the size of}} such code sequences was stable. This may not be the case. Many computers have <b>provision</b> <b>for</b> <b>operations</b> occupying different amounts of storage, notably relative addressing whereby if the destination is within say -128 or +127 addressing steps then an eight-bit address field can be used, otherwise a much larger address field is required to reach. Thus if the code were generated with a hopeful short address field, later it may become necessary to go back and adjust the code to use a longer field, with the consequence that earlier code referencing locations after the change will have to be adjusted as well. Likewise, later references going backwards across the change will have to be fixed, even those that had been to known addresses. And as well, the fixup information will itself have to be fixed, correctly. On the other hand, long addresses could be used for all cases when nearness is not certain, but the resulting code will no longer be the best possible...|$|R

5000|$|An {{additional}} {{feature that}} differentiates the ICL {{from all other}} laser diodes is its <b>provision</b> <b>for</b> electrically-pumped <b>operation</b> without a p-n junction. This is possible because the injectors function as rectifying barriers that keep the current flowing in a single direction. Nevertheless, it is highly advantageous to dope certain layers in each cascade stage {{as a means of}} controlling the active electron and hole densities, via a design technique called “carrier rebalancing.” [...] While the most favorable combination of electron and hole populations depends on the relative strengths of various free carrier absorption and Auger recombination processes, the studies done thus far indicate that the ICL performance is optimal when at threshold the two concentrations are roughly equal. Since the hole population tends to substantially exceed the electron population in undoped or moderately-doped ICLs, carrier rebalancing is achieved by heavily n-doping the electron injector (typically, with Si) so as to add electrons to the active QWs.|$|R
