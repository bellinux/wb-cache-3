40|$|Paired pre- and postsynaptic {{activity}} in area CA 1 of the hippocampus induces long-term inhibitory synaptic plasticity at GABAergic synapses. This pairing-induced GABAergic plasticity weakens synaptic inhibition {{due to a}} depolarization of the reversal potential for GABAA receptor-mediated currents (EGABA) through {{a decrease in the}} function of the neuron-specific K+-Cl- cotransporter KCC 2. When pairing-induced GABAergic plasticity is induced at feedforward inhibitory synapses in the CA 1, the decrease in inhibition produces an increase in the amplitude of Schaffer collateral-mediated postsynaptic potentials in pyramidal neurons. This form of inhibitory synaptic plasticity is termed disinhibition-mediated long-term potentiation (LTP). In the present study, we investigated whether disinhibition-mediated LTP is synapse specific. We performed these experiments in hippocampal slices prepared from adult Sprague Dawley rats. We found that the underlying depolarization of EGABA is not restricted to the <b>paired</b> <b>pathway,</b> but rather is expressed to the same extent at unpaired control pathways. However, the overall strength of GABAergic transmission is maintained at the unpaired pathway by a heterosynaptic increase in GABAergic conductance. The pairing-induced depolarization of EGABA at the paired and unpaired pathways required Ca 2 +-influx through both the L-type voltage-gated Ca 2 + channels and N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptors. However, only Ca 2 +-influx through L-type channels was required for the increased conductance at the unpaired pathway. As a result of this increased GABAergic conductance, disinhibition-mediated LTP remains confined to the <b>paired</b> <b>pathway</b> and thus is synapse specific, suggesting it may be a novel mechanism for hippocampal-dependent learning and memory...|$|E
40|$|More {{than one}} pathway is {{involved}} in disease development and progression, and two or more pathways may be interconnected to further affect the disease onset, as functional proteins participate in multiple pathways. Thus, identifying cross-talk among pathways is necessary to understand the molecular mechanisms of multiple myeloma (MM). Based on this, this paper looked at extracting potential pathway cross-talk in MM through an integrative approach using Monte Carlo cross-validation analysis. The gene expression library of MM (accession number: GSE 6477) was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The integrative approach was then used to identify potential pathway cross-talk, and included four steps: Firstly, differential expression analysis was conducted to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Secondly, the DEGs obtained were mapped to the pathways downloaded from an ingenuity pathways analysis (IPA), to reveal the underlying relationship between the DEGs and pathways enriched by these DEGs. A subset of pathways enriched by the DEGs was then obtained. Thirdly, a discriminating score (DS) value for each <b>paired</b> <b>pathway</b> was computed. Lastly, random forest (RF) classification was used to identify the paired pathways based on area under the curve (AUC) and Monte Carlo cross-validation, which was repeated 50 times to explore the best paired pathways. These paired pathways were tested with another independently published MM microarray data (GSE 85837), using in silico validation. Overall, 60 DEGs and 19 differential pathways enriched by DEGs were extracted. Each pathway was sorted based on their AUC values. The paired pathways, inhibition of matrix metalloproteases and EIF 2 signaling pathway, indicated the best AUC value of 1. 000. Paired pathways consisting of IL- 8 and EIF 2 signaling pathways with higher AUC of 0. 975, were involved in 7 runs. Furthermore, it was validated consistently in separate microarray data sets (GSE 85837). Paired pathways (inhibition of matrix metalloproteases and EIF 2 signaling, IL- 8 signaling and EIF 2 signaling) exhibited the best AUC values and higher frequency of validation. Two paired pathways (inhibition of matrix metalloproteases and EIF 2 signaling, IL- 8 signaling and EIF 2 signaling) were used to accurately classify MM and control samples.

Using microarray profile of AS and biological pathways as study objects, Monte Carlo cross-validation method was used to identify the significant pathway cross-talks. In the process of Monte Carlo cross-validation, all steps were iterated 50 times. For each run, detection of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between two groups was conducted. The extraction of the potential disrupted pathways enriched by DEGs was then implemented. Subsequently, we established a discriminating score (DS) for each <b>pathway</b> <b>pair</b> according to the distribution of gene expression levels.

To analyse this subject in grasshoppers, organisms that have been considered as models for meiotic studies for many years, we have studied the localization of phosphorylated histone H 2 AX (γ-H 2 AX), which marks the sites of double-strand breaks (DSBs), in combination with localization of cohesin SMC 3 and recombinase Rad 51.

Nearly 40 years ago, pathogen-inducible diterpenoid production was described in rice, and these compounds were shown to function as antimicrobial phytoalexins. Using rice and maize as examples, we discuss recent advances in the discovery, biosynthesis, elicitation and functional characterization of monocot terpenoid phytoalexins.

Biochemical approaches {{have been used to}} <b>pair</b> <b>pathway</b> precursors and end products with cognate biosynthetic genes. The number of predicted terpenoid phytoalexins is expanding through advances in cereal genome annotation and terpene synthase characterization that likewise enable discoveries outside the Poaceae.

Elicited production of terpenoid phytoalexins exhibit additional biological functions, including root exudate-mediated allelopathy and insect antifeedant activity. Such findings have encouraged consideration of additional interactions that blur traditionally discrete phytoalexin classifications. The establishment of mutant collections and increasing ease of genetic transformation assists critical examination of further biological roles.

In the context of synthetic lethal interaction data alone, the global similarity of synthetic lethal interaction patterns between two genes is used to predict gene function.

Analysis of the {{partitioning}} of absorbed {{light energy}} within PSII into fractions utilised by PSII photochemistry (FPSII), thermally dissipated via DpH- and zeaxanthin-dependent energy quenching (FNPQ) and constitutive non-photochemical energy losses (Ff,D) {{was performed in}} control and cold-stressed maize (Zea mays L.) leaves. The estimated energy partitioning of absorbed light to various pathways indicated that the fraction ofFPSII was twofold lower, whereas the proportion of thermally dissipated energy throughFNPQwas only 30 %higher, in cold-stressed plants compared with control plants. In contrast,Ff,D, the fraction of absorbed light energy dissipated by additional quenchingmechanism(s), was twofold higher in cold-stressed leaves. Thermoluminescence measurements revealed that the changes in energy partitioning were accompanied by narrowing of the temperature gap (DTM) between S 2 / 3 QB and S 2 QA charge recombinations in cold-stressed leaves to 8 C compared with 14. 4 C in control maize plants.

40|$|Ab initio and semi-empirical {{molecular}} orbital {{methods have been}} used to study the rearrangement pathways of ammonium ylides. There are two primary competing rearrangements of ammonium ylides, a [1, 2] migration (Stevens rearrangement) and a [3, 2] rearrangement (usually followed by rearomatisation as the Sommelet-Hauser rearrangement). The mechanism of the Stevens rearrangement has been determined by an investigation of twelve model rearrangements. A dissociative radical mechanism is predicted to be the true mechanism in all cases of alkyl migration. There is no competition from the formally symmetry-forbidden concerted mechanism, or from an ion-pair dissociative pathway. The interaction of lithium ions from the bases used to generate ammonium ylides does not affect the mechanism. The effects of solvation have been taken into account using polarisable continuum models,supermolecule calculations (at PM 3) and a hybrid polarisable continuum-supermolecule model (in an effort to take into account both electrostatic and specific solvent-solute interactions). Incorporation of solvent effects does not change the prediction of a radical <b>pair</b> <b>pathway</b> for the Stevens rearrangement. The concerted transition geometry for the [3, 2] rearrangement has been characterised for fifteen model rearrangements. The important factor in the activation energy of the [3, 2] rearrangement is in aligning the carbanion lone pair to be in a favourable position to interact with the vacant It* orbital of the double bond. This requires rotation about the N—C and C—C bonds. The competition between the [1, 2] and [3, 2] rearrangements for a prototype ylide, N-methyl- 3 -propenyl ammonium methylide, has been investigated. The activation energies for the two processes are remarkably close, separated by 2 kJ mol - 1 at ROMP 2 / 6 - 311 +G(d,p). Increasing the size of the basis set leads to a relative stabilisation of the [3, 2] transition geometry, while higher levels of electron correlation (such as CCSD(T)) favour the [1, 2] rearrangement. Incorporation of solvent effects via the SCRF polarisable continuum model leads to a lowering of the energy barrier of the concerted [3, 2] rearrangement, but have little effect on the radical [1, 2] rearrangement. The activation energies of both pathways have been calculated for ylides bearing substituents on the ammonium nitrogen and the double bond. Substituents at nitrogen lead to an ylide which is sterically unstable, and hence a preference for the dissociative [1, 2] rearrangement. Electron-withdrawing substituents on the double bond show a preference for the [3, 2] rearrangement, mildly electron-donating alkyl substituents have very little effect on activation energies. The sulfonium ylide is shown to have a much smaller barrier to the [3, 2] rearrangement than its nitrogen analogue, and there is no competition from the Stevens rearrangement, which, in the sulfonium case, has a similar barrier to dissociation as in the nitrogen case...|$|R

40|$|We have {{developed}} an e#cient algorithm for comparing two chemical compounds, where the chemical structure is treated as a 2 D graph consisting of atoms as vertices and covalent bonds as edges. Based {{on the concept of}} functional groups in chemistry, 68 atom types (vertex types) are defined for carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and other atomic species with di#erent environments, which has enabled detection of biochemically meaningful features. Maximal common subgraphs of two graphs can be found by searching for maximal cliques in the association graph, and we have introduced heuristics to accelerate the clique finding. Our heuristic procedure is controlled by some adjustable parameters. Here we applied our procedure to the latest KEGG/LIGAND database with di#erent sets of parameters, and demonstrated the correlation of parameters in our algorithm with the distribution of similarity scores and/or the execution time. Finally, we showed the e#ectiveness of our heuristics for compound <b>pairs</b> along metabolic <b>pathways...</b>|$|R
40|$|Ionic liquids (ILs) are room {{temperature}} molten salts with unique properties and {{broad range of}} applications. The properties are tunable based on the cation-anion (C + -A -) combination. Studying the ion pairs provides understanding {{of the interaction between}} the isolated cation and anion, which primarily determines the electronic and nuclear structure. New velocity map imaging experiments were initiated to study the dissociative pathways upon photoexcitation of isolated ion pairs. Dissociative ionization and ion <b>pair</b> dissociation <b>pathways</b> initiated by 54 nm light of an IL, 1 -ethy- 3 -methylimidazolium ([Emim] +) bis(trifluoromethyl-sulfonyl) imide ([Tf 2 N] -), are revealed. Furthermore, the ultrafast excited dynamics of an IL, [Emim] + [Br] -, has been studied using time-resolved photoion spectroscopy. Momentary depletion of the intact cation and rise of the alkyl-loss fragments are observed, suggesting a possibility for a short-lived electronically or internally excited state that promotes the formation of alkyl-loss fragments upon probe excitation. The volatilization process of thermally stable and unstable ionic liquids is studied using tunable vacuum ultraviolet light (VUV). Heats of vaporization for imidazolium-based ionic liquids are measured and the ionization threshold for the neutral ion pair is directly measured for the first time. The thermal decomposition mechanism for [Emim] + [Br] - is explored to understand the volatilization process better, showing that alkyl abstraction upon heating occurs via an S N 2 type mechanism. Moreover, an IL hypergolic reaction mechanism is studied using an aerosol flow tube method combined with tunable VUV light to understand the reaction chemistry of a potentially less corrosive and toxic rocket fuel system. Isolated ion pairs are monitored from IL aerosols with the advantage of less photofragmentation. Observation of early stage reaction intermediates, cyanamide, N 2 O, and CO 2 from a hypergolic IL reaction with nitric acid reveals the existence of a nitro-substituted intermediate...|$|R
40|$|The shikimate pathway, {{responsible}} for aromatic amino acid biosynthesis, {{is required for}} the growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and is a potential drug target. The first reaction is catalyzed by 3 -deoxy-d-arabino-heptulosonate 7 -phosphate synthase (DAH 7 PS). Feedback regulation of DAH 7 PS activity by aromatic amino acids controls shikimate pathway flux. Whereas Mycobacterium tuberculosis DAH 7 PS (MtuDAH 7 PS) is not inhibited by the addition of Phe, Tyr, or Trp alone, combinations cause significant loss of enzyme activity. In the presence of 200 μm Phe, only 2. 4 μm Trp is required to reduce enzymic activity to 50 %. Reaction kinetics were analyzed in the presence of inhibitory concentrations of Trp/Phe or Trp/Tyr. In the absence of inhibitors, the enzyme follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics with respect to substrate erythrose 4 -phosphate (E 4 P), whereas the addition of inhibitor combinations caused significant homotropic cooperativity with respect to E 4 P, with Hill coefficients of 3. 3 (Trp/Phe) and 2. 8 (Trp/Tyr). Structures of MtuDAH 7 PS/Trp/Phe, MtuDAH 7 PS/Trp, and MtuDAH 7 PS/Phe complexes were determined. The MtuDAH 7 PS/Trp/Phe homotetramer binds four Trp and six Phe molecules. Binding sites for both aromatic amino acids are formed by accessory elements to the core DAH 7 PS (β/α) 8 barrel that are unique to the type II DAH 7 PS family and contribute to the tight dimer and tetramer interfaces. A comparison of the liganded and unliganded MtuDAH 7 PS structures reveals changes in the interface areas associated with inhibitor binding and a small displacement of the E 4 P binding loop. These studies uncover a previously unrecognized mode of control for the branched pathways of aromatic amino acid biosynthesis involving synergistic inhibition by specific <b>pairs</b> of <b>pathway</b> end products...|$|R
40|$|Motivation: Many {{biological}} phenomena involve extensive {{interactions between}} {{many of the}} biological pathways present in cells. However, extraction of all the inherent biological pathways remains a major challenge in systems biology. With the advent of high-throughput functional genomic techniques, {{it is now possible}} to infer biological pathways and pathway organization in a systematic way by integrating disparate biological information. Results: Here, we propose a novel integrated approach that uses network topology to predict biological pathways. We integrated four types of biological evidence (protein–protein interaction, genetic interaction, domain–domain interaction and semantic similarity of Gene Ontology terms) to generate a functionally associated network. This network was then used to develop a new pathway finding algorithm to predict biological pathways in yeast. Our approach discovered 195 biological pathways and 31 functionally redundant <b>pathway</b> <b>pairs</b> in yeast. By comparing our identified pathways to three public pathway databases (KEGG, BioCyc and Reactome), we observed that our approach achieves a maximum positive predictive value of 12. 8 % and improves on other predictive approaches. This study allows us to reconstruct biological pathways and delineates cellular machinery in a systematic view.

Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 79 - 85). Information visualization {{is concerned with}} effective visual presentation of abstract information, which reinforces human cognition. Graphs are structures that are well suited to represent relational information. Graph visualization is vital since the underlying relational information of the graph provides fine analysis and comprehension opportunities. Biological pathway visualization {{is one of the}} most popular areas, where graph visualization is highly favored. Interactive analysis and visualization of cancer related pathways in the context of genomic data, such as those available through the TCGA project, might reveal valuable information for scientists about disease conditions and potential causes. As the size and complexity of such cancer pathways and associated genomic data increase, exchangeable in-silico representations and their effective, enhanced visualizations, and complexity management become crucial for effective analysis of such data to potentially discover cause-effect relations. In this thesis, we designed and implemented software solutions to visualize cancer genomics data in the context of networks from simple gene interaction networks to process description diagrams within the cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics (cBioPortal). cBioPortal is a popular web portal, getting about 60. 000 visits globally per month, providing visualization, analysis and download of largescale cancer genomics data sets. The network view in cBioPortal presents neighborhood of genes of interest. The alteration data is overlaid on the network with numerous ways to filter and manage complexity of the network (e. g. by alteration percentage or by type or source of the interactions). Upon demand, the user can obtain a more detailed, mechanistic view of the interactions among gene <b>pairs,</b> from <b>Pathway</b> Commons database with a live query using the SBGN process description notation. Finally, we also developed a new pathway visualization component, specifically for cancer pathways, using a uniform notation found in TCGA cancer publications.

40|$|Despite {{efforts to}} {{understand}} the interactions between nanoparticles and cells, the cellular processes that determine the efficiency of intracellular drug delivery remain unclear. Here we examine cellular uptake of short interfering RNA (siRNA) delivered in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) using cellular trafficking probes in combination with automated high-throughput confocal microscopy. We also employed defined perturbations of cellular <b>pathways</b> <b>paired</b> with systems biology approaches to uncover protein-protein and protein–small molecule interactions. We show that multiple cell signaling effectors are required for initial cellular entry of LNPs through macropinocytosis, including proton pumps, mTOR and cathepsins. siRNA delivery is substantially reduced as ≅ 70 % of the internalized siRNA undergoes exocytosis through egress of LNPs from late endosomes/lysosomes. Niemann-Pick type C 1 (NPC 1) is shown {{to be an important}} regulator of the major recycling pathways of LNP-delivered siRNAs. NPC 1 -deficient cells show enhanced cellular retention of LNPs inside late endosomes and lysosomes, and increased gene silencing of the target gene. Our data suggest that siRNA delivery efficiency might be improved by designing delivery vehicles that can escape the recycling pathways.

40|$|Motivation: A rapid {{technological}} {{development in the}} biosciences and in computer science {{in the last decade}} has enabled the analysis of high-dimensional biological datasets on standard desktop computers. However, in spite of these technical advances, common properties of the new high-throughput experimental data, like small sample sizes in relation to the number of features, high noise levels and outliers, also pose novel challenges. Ensemble and consensus machine learning techniques and data integration methods can alleviate these issues, but often provide overly complex models which lack generalization capability and interpretability. The goal of this thesis was therefore to develop new approaches to combine algorithms and large-scale biological datasets, including novel approaches to integrate analysis types from different domains (e. g. statistics, topological network analysis, machine learning and text mining), to exploit their synergies in a manner that provides compact and interpretable models for inferring new biological knowledge. Main results: The main contributions of the doctoral project are new ensemble, consensus and cross-domain bioinformatics algorithms, and new analysis pipelines combining these techniques within a general framework. This framework is designed to enable the integrative analysis of both large- scale gene and protein expression data (including the tools ArrayMining, Top-scoring <b>pathway</b> <b>pairs</b> and RNAnalyze) and general gene and protein sets (including the tools TopoGSA, EnrichNet and PathExpand), by combining algorithms for different statistical learning tasks (feature selection, classification and clustering) in a modular fashion. Ensemble and consensus analysis techniques employed within the modules are redesigned such that the compactness and interpretability of the resulting models is optimized in addition to the predictive accuracy and robustness. The framework was applied to real-word biomedical problems, with a focus on cancer biology, providing the following main results: (1) The identification of a novel tumour marker gene in collaboration with the Nottingham Queens Medical Centre, facilitating the distinction between two clinically important breast cancer subtypes (framework tool: ArrayMining) (2) The prediction of novel candidate disease genes for Alzheimer’s disease and pancreatic cancer using an integrative analysis of cellular pathway definitions and protein interaction data (framework tool: PathExpand, collaboration with the Spanish National Cancer Centre) (3) The prioritization of associations between disease-related processes and other cellular pathways using a new rule-based classification method integrating gene expression data and pathway definitions (framework tool: Top-scoring <b>pathway</b> <b>pairs)</b> (4) The discovery of topological similarities between differentially expressed genes in cancers and cellular pathway definitions mapped to a molecular interaction network (framework tool: TopoGSA, collaboration with the Spanish National Cancer Centre) In summary, the framework combines the synergies of multiple cross-domain analysis techniques within a single easy-to-use software and has provided new biological insights {{in a wide variety of}} practical settings.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between the genetic and environmental risk factors for alcohol use disorders (AUD) detected in Swedish medical, pharmacy, and criminal registries has not been hitherto examined. Prior twin studies have varied {{with regard to the}} detection of shared environmental effects and sex differences in the etiology of AUD. In this report, structural equation modeling in OpenMx was applied to (1) the three types of alcohol registration in a population-based sample of male–male twins and reared-together full and half siblings (total 208, 810 pairs), and (2) AUD, as a single diagnosis, in male–male, female–female, and opposite-sex (OS) twins and reared-together full and half siblings (total 787, 916 <b>pairs).</b> An independent <b>pathway</b> model fit best to the three forms of registration and indicated that between 70 % and 92 % of the genetic and 63 % and 98 % of the shared environmental effects were shared in common with the remainder unique to each form of AUD registration. Criminal registration had the largest proportion of unique genetic and environmental factors. The best fit model for AUD estimated the heritability to be 22 % and 57 %, respectively, in females and males. Both shared (12 % vs. 6 %) and special twin environment (29 % vs. 2 %) were substantially more important in females versus males. In conclusion, AUD ascertained from medical, pharmacy, and criminal Swedish registries largely share the same genetic and environmental risk factors. Large sex differences in the etiology of AUD were seen in this sample, with substantially stronger familial environmental and weaker genetic effects in females versus males...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} 19 {{compounds}} of general formula R 1 S-Cd-SR 2, R 1, and R 2, being some biologically relevant thiol amino acids and peptides, were prepared by direct reaction of cadmium(II) ions and thiols in water at millimolar concentration. The obtained products {{were characterized by}} electrospray ionization and triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry. The source spectra of stoichiometric 1 : 2 Cd-thiol systems containing either an individual thiol or equimolar mixtures of two different thiols featured several Cd-containing signals, although at much lesser intensity than in the previously reported experiments with mercury(II) (J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 2004, 15, 288 – 300). Also, the relative intensity of the homo- and heterodimeric thiolates were {{significantly different from the}} theoretically expected 1 : 2 : 1 ratio, thus pointing at some degree of discrimination between the different thiols. In particular, homo-cysteine showed much less reactivity than cysteine, and penicillamine and cysteine methyl ester much less than the free amino acid. The fragment spectra show structure-specific ions for the different ligands bound to the metal ion and allow a stand-alone determination of the connectivity also of isomeric <b>pairs.</b> The fragmentation <b>pathways</b> are similar to those observed for the corresponding mercury(II) analogues, with the addition of further intense and specific fragments, one formally carrying a Cd-bound OH ligand and one connected as a five-membered oxazolone carrying a cadmium-bis-thiolate side chain, both formed with a high intensity. Energy-resolved fragmentation data show that metal-free ions can be generated from cysteine but not from glutathione conjugates and point to the possibility of unveiling differences in the biochemical behavior of the conjugates of different heavy metals through the detailed study of their mass spectrometric fragmentation...|$|R
