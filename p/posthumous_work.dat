In 1908, after eight years of work, Koht completed the two last volumes of Norsk Forfatter-lexikon, a biographical dictionary of Norwegian writers.

5|$|Several novels, {{books and}} poems were {{generated}} {{as a consequence}} of the Klondike gold rush. The writer Jack London incorporated scenes from the gold rush into his novels set in the Klondike, including The Call of the Wild, a novel about a sledge dog. His colleague, poet Robert W. Service, did not join the rush himself, although he made his home in Dawson City in 1908. Service created well-known poems about the gold rush, among them Songs of a Sourdough, one of the bestselling books of poetry in the first decade of the 20th century, along with his novel, The Trail of '98, which was written by hand on wallpaper in one of Dawson's log cabins. The Canadian historian Pierre Berton grew up in Dawson where his father had been a prospector, and wrote several historical books about the gold rush, such as The Last Great Gold Rush. The experiences of the Irish Micí Mac Gabhann resulted the <b>posthumous</b> <b>work</b> Rotha Mór an tSaoil (translated into English as The Hard Road to Klondike in 1962), a vivid description of the period.|$|E

25|$|Ephron began {{background}} {{interviews with}} McAlary's colleagues such as Jim Dwyer, {{in the months}} after McAlary's Christmas 1998 death. In 2005, the film idea was floated again, but Ephron claimed she could not get her preferred leading actor. It was not until 2011 that Ephron succeeded in attracting Hanks to the project. Hanks had previously starred in Ephron's popular films, Sleepless in Seattle and You've Got Mail, but he had last performed live in the theatre in 1979 for Riverside Shakespeare Company's production of The Mandrake. The play is the final and <b>posthumous</b> <b>work</b> of Ephron, who died the year before its production.|$|E
25|$|His <b>posthumous</b> <b>work</b> and legacy, {{especially}} his collections were {{to some extent}} blurred later as {{he was unable to}} find Japanese or Chinese translators and scholars in Europe that could help him with the translation of his gathered sources. As his own knowledge of the Sino-Japanese written characters was limited he could only edit the translations of the Japanese accounts that were already prepared by himself and others in Dejima during his stay abroad. The majority of his work thus was published posthumously and consisted of only small parts of his broader overall work. Moreover, some parts were altered and modified to a great extent by his editors and publishers. This was {{due to the fact that}} after the bankruptcy of Titsingh’s son Willem Titsingh sold the collections and manuscripts, which then were spread all over 19th century Europe.|$|E

25|$|Gemma edited his father's <b>posthumous</b> <b>work</b> De astrolabo catholica (1556). In 1560, {{he began}} {{publishing}} {{his own work}} in the annual series Ephemerides meteorologicae, printed by Joannes Withagen. The Ephemerides is the earliest known astrological work from the Low Countries to carry an official notice of approval from the Roman Catholic Church. Gemma moved away from judicial astrology and renounced astrological predictions about political events, and seems to have gradually confined himself to predictions about astronomical phenomena and meteorological astrology. His predictions for 1561, for example, provided detailed information on every lunar phase, and most planetary aspects and phases of fixed stars {{in relation to the}} sun, with a thoroughness that surpassed the predictions of his contemporaries. He remained committed to astrologic medicine, however, and believed that predictable atmospheric conditions, extending to astral conjunctions, generated disease.|$|E

500|$|Godwin's book {{appeared}} {{in a time of}} great interest in the Moon and astronomical phenomena, and of important developments in celestial observation, mathematics and mechanics. The influence particularly of Nicolaus Copernicus led to what was called the [...] "new astronomy"; Copernicus is the only astronomer Godwin mentions by name, but the theories of Johannes Kepler and William Gilbert are also discernible. Galileo Galilei's 1610 publication Sidereus Nuncius (usually translated as [...] "The Sidereal Messenger") had a great influence on Godwin's astronomical theories, although Godwin proposes (unlike Galileo) that the dark spots on the Moon are seas, one of many similarities between The Man in the Moone and Kepler's Somnium sive opus posthumum de astronomia lunaris of 1634 ("The Dream, or <b>Posthumous</b> <b>Work</b> on Lunar Astronomy").|$|E

[...] In Frayn's view, [...] "The Festival was the last, and virtually the <b>posthumous,</b> <b>work</b> of the Herbivore Britain of the BBC News, the Crown Film Unit, the sweet ration, the Ealing comedies, Uncle Mac, Sylvia Peters." [...] In making the Festival the Herbivores [...] "earned the contempt of the Carnivores – the readers of the Daily Express; the Evelyn Waughs; the cast of the Directory of Directors".|$|E

Overseas signings were considered an unusual and rare achievement for Brisbane bands at the time. The songs were described by Noise for Heroes Steve Gardner as [...] "some kind {{of out of}} control speed metal-hardcore hybrid ... Even when it sounds metally there's a lot more effort in playing and less in posing than most metal bands, so the judges' scores {{are going to be}} pretty good on this one". A final line up change occurred in 1988 when Le Noury left to join Hitmen D.T.K.. The remaining members recorded a mini-LP, Acid Commandos from Planet Fuzz, but disbanded in 1990 before its release. Cooke joined Le Noury in Hitmen DTK. In 1991 the <b>posthumous</b> <b>work,</b> Acid Commandos from Planet Fuzz, was released on Schlock Records.|$|E
