25|$|In plants, algae, {{and other}} {{photosynthetic}} organisms, lycopene {{is an important}} intermediate in the biosynthesis of many carotenoids, including beta-carotene, {{which is responsible for}} yellow, orange, or red pigmentation, photosynthesis, and <b>photoprotection.</b> Like all carotenoids, lycopene is a polyunsaturated hydrocarbon, i.e. an unsubstituted alkene. Structurally, lycopene is a tetraterpene and assembled from eight isoprene units that are composed entirely of carbon and hydrogen. It is insoluble in water. Lycopene's eleven conjugated double bonds give its deep red color and its antioxidant activity in vitro. Owing to the strong color, lycopene is a useful food coloring (registered as E160d) and is approved for usage in the USA, Australia and New Zealand (registered as 160d) and the EU.|$|E

50|$|According to the <b>photoprotection</b> theory, {{anthocyanins}} {{protects the}} leaf against {{the harmful effects}} of light at low temperatures. Indeed, the leaves are about to fall, so protection is not of extreme importance for the tree. Photo-oxidation and photoinhibition, however, especially at low temperatures, make the process of reabsorbing nutrients less efficient. By shielding the leaf with anthocyanins, according to the <b>photoprotection</b> theory, the tree manages to reabsorb nutrients (especially nitrogen) more efficiently.|$|E

50|$|Melanin {{is not a}} photocarcinogen, {{because it}} dissipates the {{excitation}} energy into small amounts of heat (see <b>photoprotection).</b> Oxybenzone (a component of some sunscreens) is suspected owing to its skin penetrating qualities and its production of free radicals.|$|E
50|$|In {{many species}} of fish, amphibians, crustaceans, and reptiles, melanosomes can be highly mobile within the cell in {{response}} to hormonal (or sometimes neural) control, which leads to visible changes in colour that are used for behavioural signaling or <b>photoprotection.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{melanosome}} is an organelle {{found in}} animal cells {{and is the}} site for synthesis, storage and transport of melanin, the most common light-absorbing pigment found in the animal kingdom. Melanosomes are responsible for color and <b>photoprotection</b> in animal cells and tissues.|$|E

50|$|Under iron-deficient growth conditions, CP43' {{associates}} with photosystem I {{to form a}} complex that consists of a ring of 18 or more CP43' molecules around a PSI trimer, which significantly increases the light-harvesting system of PSI. IsiA can also provide <b>photoprotection</b> for PSII.|$|E
50|$|Xanthophyll cycle reactions, where antheraxanthin is an {{intermediate}} stage, are usually responses {{to changes in}} light or radiation exposure, which cause changes in the internal pH of thylakoids.

5000|$|... 3'-Hydroxyechinenone is a keto-carotenoid pigment {{found in}} {{cyanobacteria}} and microalgae. Carotenoids {{belong to a}} larger class of phytochemicals known as terpenoids. The chemical formula of canthaxanthin is C40H54O2. It is found non-covalently bound in the orange carotenoid protein (OCP), which is a soluble protein involved in <b>photoprotection</b> and non-photochemical quenching of photosynthesis.|$|E
50|$|Carotenoids are red, orange, {{or yellow}} tetraterpenoids. During {{the process of}} photosynthesis, they have {{functions}} in light-harvesting (as accessory pigments), in <b>photoprotection</b> (energy dissipation via non-photochemical quenching as well as singlet oxygen scavenging for prevention of photooxidative damage), and also serve as protein structural elements. In higher plants, they also serve as precursors to the plant hormone abscisic acid.|$|E
5000|$|The primary {{structure}} (amino acid sequence) is highly conserved among OCP sequences, and the full-length protein is usually co-located on the chromosome with the FRP at an adjacent locus. [...] Often, biosynthetic genes for ketocarotenoid synthesis (e.g., CrtW) are nearby. These conserved functional linkages underscore the evolutionary {{importance of the}} OCP style of <b>photoprotection</b> for many cyanobacteria.|$|E
5000|$|Antheraxanthin (from ánthos, Greek for [...] "flower" [...] and xanthos, Greek for [...] "yellow") is {{a bright}} yellow {{accessory}} pigment found in many organisms that perform photosynthesis. It is a xanthophyll cycle pigment, an oil-soluble alcohol within the xanthophyll subgroup of carotenoids. Antheraxanthin is both a component in and product of the cellular <b>photoprotection</b> mechanisms in photosynthetic green algae, red algae, euglenoids, and plants.|$|E
50|$|Solumbra {{has been}} used by highly sun {{sensitive}} patients as well as by world-class athletes participating in international competition. Sun protection clothing can offer superior <b>photoprotection</b> because of typical sunscreen shortcomings: not equally broad spectrum, misapplication, low durability, allergic reaction, poor reapplication behavior, and poor cosmetic elegance. Sun protection clothing has become a choice of patients with skin cancer, lupus, vitiligo, porphyria, XP, and sun allergies.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Photoprotection</b> is the {{biochemical}} process that helps organisms cope with molecular {{damage caused by}} sunlight. Plants and other oxygenic phototrophs have developed a suite of photoprotective mechanisms to prevent photoinhibition and oxidative stress caused by excess or fluctuating light conditions. Humans and other animals have also developed photoprotective mechanisms to avoid UV photodamage to the skin, prevent DNA damage, and minimize the downstream effects of oxidative stress.|$|E
50|$|Men are {{generally}} hairier than women, and Darwin {{was of the}} opinion that hairlessness was related to sexual selection; however, several other explanations have been advanced to explain human hairlessness, a leading one is loss of body hair to facilitate sweating. This idea closely relates to that of the suggested need for increased <b>photoprotection</b> and is part of the most-commonly-accepted scientific explanation for the evolution of pigmentary traits.|$|E
50|$|<b>Photoprotection</b> of {{the human}} skin is {{achieved}} by extremely efficient internal conversion of DNA, proteins and melanin. Internal conversion is a photochemical process that converts {{the energy of the}} UV photon into small, harmless amounts of heat. If the energy of the UV photon were not transformed into heat, then it would lead to the generation of free radicals or other harmful reactive chemical species (e.g. singlet oxygen, or hydroxyl radical).|$|E
50|$|A {{few cases}} of {{photosensitivity}} (hypersensitivity to ultraviolet light-induced skin redness and/or lesions) associated with bicalutamide have been reported. In {{one of the}} cases, bicalutamide was continued due to effectiveness in treating prostate cancer in the patient, and in combination with strict <b>photoprotection</b> (in the form of avoidance/prevention of ultraviolet light exposure), the symptoms disappeared and did not recur. Flutamide is also associated with photosensitivity, but much more frequently in comparison to bicalutamide.|$|E
50|$|Several natural {{molecules}} {{perform a}} fast internal conversion. This ability {{to transform the}} excitation energy of photon into heat can be a crucial property for <b>photoprotection</b> by molecules such as melanin. Fast internal conversion reduces the excited state lifetime, and thereby prevents bimolecular reactions. Bimolecular electron transfer always produces a reactive chemical species, free radicals. Nucleic acids (precisely the single, free nucleotides, not those bound in a DNA/RNA strand) have an extremely short lifetime due to a fast internal conversion.|$|E
50|$|IsiA is a photosynthesis-related chlorophyll-containing protein {{found in}} cyanobacteria. It {{belongs to the}} chlorophyll-a/b-binding family of proteins, and {{has been shown to}} have a <b>photoprotection</b> role in {{preventing}} oxidative damage via energy dissipation. It was originally identified under Fe-starvation, and thus received the name Iron-Starvation-Induced protein A. However, the protein has more recently been found to respond to a variety of stress conditions such as high irradiance. It can aggregate with carotenoids and form rings around the PSI reaction center complexes to aid in photoprotective energy dissipation.|$|E
50|$|Recent {{research}} suggests that melanin may serve a protective role other than <b>photoprotection.</b> Melanin is able to effectively ligate metal ions through its carboxylate and phenolic hydroxyl groups, in many cases much more efficiently than the powerful chelating ligand ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA). Thus, it may serve to sequester potentially toxic metal ions, protecting {{the rest of the}} cell. This hypothesis is supported {{by the fact that the}} loss of neuromelanin observed in Parkinson's disease is accompanied by an increase in iron levels in the brain.|$|E
5000|$|Cyanobacteria possess some unique {{strategies}} for <b>photoprotection</b> {{which have not}} been identified in plants nor in algae. [...] For example, most cyanobacteria possess an Orange Carotenoid Protein (OCP), {{which serves as a}} novel form of non-photochemical quenching. [...] Another unique, albeit poorly-understood, cyanobacterial strategy involves the IsiA chlorophyll-binding protein, which can aggregate with carotenoids and form rings around the PSI reaction center complexes to aid in photoprotective energy dissipation. Some other cyanobacterial strategies may involve state-transitions of the phycobilisome antenna complex, photoreduction of water with the Flavodiiron proteins, and futile cycling of CO2.|$|E
5000|$|Carotenoids such as beta-carotene, lycopene, lutein and beta-cryptoxanthine are {{produced}} in plants and certain bacteria, algae and fungi, where they function as accessory photosynthetic pigments and as scavengers of oxygen radicals for <b>photoprotection.</b> They are also essential dietary nutrients in animals. Carotenoid oxygenases cleave {{a variety of}} carotenoids into a range of biologically important products, including apocarotenoids in plants that function as hormones, pigments, flavours, floral scents and defence compounds, and retinoids in animals that function as vitamins, visual pigments and signalling molecules. Examples of carotenoid oxygenases include: ...|$|E
5000|$|Orange {{carotenoid}} protein (OCP) is a water-soluble protein {{which plays}} a role in <b>photoprotection</b> in diverse cyanobacteria. [...] It is the only photoactive protein known to use a carotenoid as the photoresponsive chromophore. The protein consists of two domains, with a single keto-carotenoid molecule non-covalently bound between the two domains. It is a very efficient quencher of excitation energy absorbed by the primary light-harvesting antenna complexes of cyanobacteria, the phycobilisomes. The quenching is induced by blue-green light. It is also capable of preventing oxidative damage by directly scavenging singlet oxygen (1O2).|$|E
5000|$|Afamelanotide in a {{subcutaneous}} implant form {{is currently}} being prescribed and used for treatment of patients in Italy and Switzerland and has received market authorization from the European Medicines Agency as a dermal <b>photoprotection</b> inducing agent for those suffering from erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) covering all of the European Union under the brand name [...] "Scenesse". As of 2016 {{it continues to be}} evaluated in human clinical trials both for Europe and countries outside of the E.U. for a spectrum of indications including EPP. It is being further developed by Clinuvel Pharmaceuticals for such dermatological medical indications.|$|E

Phospholipids are used in formulation of honey based topical microemulsion of Clotrimazole for treating Dermatomycosis. Phospholipid cream with Phyllanthus emblica (amla) extract, is used as an antioxidant cosmetic formulation for <b>photoprotection.</b> A novel anti-aging cream composed of phospholipids, Citrus auranticum (orange) and Glycyrrhiza glabra (liquorice) is used for effective cutaneous delivery of anti-oxidants. It is used for nutritional supplementation and improving bio-availability of natural extracts. Rutin trihydrate, a powerful antioxidant entrapped in Phospholipids, when administered tropically exhibits enhance protection against degenerative effects such as photoaging, sunburn, photocarcinogenesis etc.|$|E
50|$|Upon {{illumination}} with blue-green light, OCP switches from {{an orange}} form (OCPO) to a red form (OCPR). The reversion of OCPR to OCPO is light independent and occurs slowly in darkness. OCPO {{is considered the}} dark, stable form of the protein, and does not contribute to phycobilisome quenching. OCPR {{is considered to be}} essential for induction of the <b>photoprotection</b> mechanism. The photoconversion from the orange to red form has a poor light efficiency (very low quantum yield), which helps to ensure the protein's photoprotective role only functions during high light conditions; otherwise, the dissipative NPQ process could unproductively divert light energy away from photosynthesis under light-limiting conditions.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the human}} skin, {{melanogenesis}} is generated after exposure to UV radiation, causing {{the skin to}} turn tan. Melanin is an effective absorbent of light; the pigment is able to dissipate over 99.9% of absorbed UV radiation. Because of this property, melanin is thought to protect skin cells from UVB radiation damage, {{reducing the risk of}} cancer, and it's considered that exposure to UV radiation is associated with increased risk of malignant melanoma, a cancer of the melanocytes cells. Studies have shown a lower incidence for skin cancer in individuals with more concentrated melanin, i.e. darker skin tone. However; the relationship between skin pigmentation and <b>photoprotection</b> is still being investigated.|$|E
5000|$|Solumbra sun {{protection}} fabrics rely on four methods to achieve {{sun protection}}: fiber content, weaving methods, fabric dyeing process and finishing process. The key concept {{is to prevent}} UV from transmitting through the fibers and apertures (holes between the fibers). Solumbra I fabric is protected by U.S. and international design and process patents. [...] Hughes developed the technology without treatments or coatings that could lose their effectiveness and <b>photoprotection</b> after use, laundering and exposure to environmental factors.Solumbra clothing designs are based upon published medical guidelines.
