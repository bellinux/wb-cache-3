5000|$|Syracuse Faucet and Valve Company were {{manufacturers}} {{of the famous}} Syracuse <b>Packless</b> Radiator Valve by December 1913. The company also produced Globe Angle Y and Check Valves. The company advertised the valves [...] "do not leak" [...] and they were designed for hot water or steam radiators and [...] "built for hard usage, will last indefinitely." [...] The company was located at 107 North Franklin Street in Syracuse and 220-224 West 42nd Street in New York City.|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} {{experiments}} have been performed to test a calculational model for precipitation of NaH in sodium cold traps. The calculational model, called ACTMODEL, is a computer simulation that uses the system geometry and operating conditions as input to calculate a mass-transfer coefficient {{and the distribution of}} NaH in a cold trap. The ACTMODEL was tested using an analytical cold trap (ACT) that is simple and essentially one-dimensional. The ACT flow and temperature profile can be controlled at any desired condition. The ACT was analyzed destructively after each test to measure the actual NaH distribution. Excellent agreement was obtained between the ACTMODEL simulations and the experiments. Mass-transfer coefficients ranging upward from 6 x 10 /sup - 5 / m/s were measured in both <b>packless</b> and packed traps. As much as a fourfold increase in precipitation surface area was observed with increasing amount of NaH deposited...|$|E
40|$|Chemical Engineering Department, College of Engineering King Saud UniversityHeavy Arabian vacuum residua were {{hydrocracked}} non-catalytically using tetralin as {{a hydrogen}} donor solvent. A bolted closure <b>packless</b> high temperature/high pressure autoclave with a magnedrive assembly was used batchwise for this purpose. The effects of temperature, pressure, and reactants ratio {{on the performance}} of the system were studied. The products were analyzed both qualitatively and quantitatively. Methods of analysis included: hydrocarbon group analysis using an HPLC, simulated distillation using a GC, sulfur determination and API gravity, asphaltene and carbon residue determination according to ASTM standards. Tetralin proved to be an effective donor for Arabian residua. HPLC and simulated distillation analysis showed that heavy compounds of the residuum were converted into lighter ones. When a ratio of tetralin to residuum less than 1 / 1 by weight was used coke formed in amounts proportional to tetralin. For ratios greater than 1 / 1 no coke formation was observed. A ratio of 2 / 1 was found to be a suitable ratio and was used in all runs. It was found that a minimum initial pressure of nitrogen gas (0. 5 MPa) was sufficient to keep the reactants in the liquid state. Otherwise, pressure had no effect on the conversion. As the temperature was increased the conversion to lighter products increased. The relative percentage change of both asphaltenes and carbon residue increase with temperature. Degree of desulfurization also increased with temperature. This preliminary study was limited to use a maximum temperature of 435 Qc. Increasing the temperature beyond this limit causes gas venting, and thus a loss of gaseous products. The system will be modified to work at higher temperatures by the method of rapid injection...|$|E
