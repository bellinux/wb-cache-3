5000|$|Succinimides {{refers to}} {{compounds}} that contain the succinimide group, {{although they are}} generally not made from succinimide itself. These compounds have some notable uses. Several succinimides are used as anticonvulsant drugs, including ethosuximide, <b>phensuximide,</b> and methsuximide.|$|E
40|$|A {{simple and}} {{accurate}} method is described for the quantitative determina tion of trimethadione, paramethadione, ethosuximide, metharbital, methsuxim-ide, <b>phensuximide,</b> mephenytoin, ethotoin, primidone and diazepam in serum. Gas chromatography, with temperature programming, is employed {{and each of}} the drugs or any combination of them may be assayed on a single specimen during a single rapid determination on 3 percent OV- 17 following chloroform extraction. Retention times relative to an internal standard (methyl myristate) are given. The recovery of the drugs is from 77 to 100 percent, the instrument response is linear for each drug, and the coefficients of variation are from 3 to 9 percent...|$|E
40|$|Recent reports imply {{potential}} benefits to patients taking longterm, multiple anticonvulsants {{if the number}} of concurrent drugs could be safely reduced. Attempts to reduce the doses of one anticonvulsant were made at monthly intervals in a selected group of 33 closely supervised, ambulatory, chronic epileptic patients with severe mental retardation. Phenytoin dosage was increased in over half the patients as the other drug was decreased. Over 18 months of observation, phenobarbital was completely withdrawn from 19 patients, primidone from four, ethosuximide from one and <b>phensuximide</b> from one. There was no deterioration of behavior or loss of seizure control in these patients. Seizures reappeared after a year in five patients who continued to take phenytoin after phenobarbital or primidone was withdrawn. A second anticonvulsant was given to these patients. This study shows that one anticonvulsant can be successfully withdrawn from many, but not all, chronic epileptic patients with multiple handicaps...|$|E
