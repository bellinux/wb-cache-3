5000|$|At 09:30, as the frigate {{approached}} Kiangyin (now {{known as}} Jiangyin) further up the river, she came under sustained fire {{from a second}} PLA battery. The first shell passed over the ship, then the bridge, wheelhouse and low <b>power</b> <b>room</b> were hit in quick succession, Lt Cdr Skinner was mortally wounded, and all the bridge personnel were disabled. The coxswain on the wheel, Leading Seaman Leslie Frank, was seriously injured {{and as a result}} the ship slewed to port and grounded on the bank before control of the ship was regained. Before the ship grounded, the order to open fire had been given, but when the director layer pulled the firing trigger, nothing happened, because the firing circuits were disabled when the low <b>power</b> <b>room</b> was hit. First Lieutenant Geoffrey L. Weston assumed command of the vessel, although also wounded himself.

The low temperature photoluminescence (PL) spectrum of the In 0. 5 Ga 0. 5 As quantum dots surrounded by GaAs exhibit an emission peak at 1. 137 to 1. 182 eV and a narrow linewidth (FWHM). The PL peak energy and intensity are varied with the excitation <b>powers.</b> <b>Room</b> temperature PL shows slightly lower peak energy with a broader spectrum linewidth.

50|$|A {{security}} weakness on {{the rural}} Strowger exchanges (UAX 13s and smaller) {{had been the}} electrical power supply. If the mains feed went down, the exchanges relied on back-up batteries, but these could only keep the exchange going {{for a few hours}} and after that, service was lost across the whole exchange to typically several hundred customers. The TXE2s were much better equipped. They had a separate <b>power</b> <b>room,</b> itself often bigger than the entire UAX 13, in which, as well as back-up batteries, there was a stand-by diesel generator. This started automatically {{in the event of a}} power cut and could keep the exchange going for days.

50|$|All British {{ships were}} under {{instructions}} to use radio as sparingly {{as possible and}} to use the lowest practical transmission <b>power.</b> <b>Room</b> 40 had benefited greatly from the free chatter between German ships, which gave them many routine messages to compare and analyse, and from the German habit of transmitting at full power, making the messages easier to receive. Messages to Scapa were never to be sent by wireless, and when the fleet was at sea, messages might be sent using lower power and relay ships (including private vessels), to make German interception more difficult. No attempts were made by the German fleet to restrict its use of wireless until 1917 and then only in response to perceived British use of direction finding, not because it believed messages were being decoded.|$|E
