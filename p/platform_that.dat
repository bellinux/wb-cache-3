5|$|Although {{nitrogen}} is non-toxic, when {{released into}} an enclosed space it can displace oxygen, and therefore presents an asphyxiation hazard. This may happen with few warning symptoms, since the human carotid {{body is a}} relatively poor and slow low-oxygen (hypoxia) sensing system. An example occurred shortly before {{the launch of the}} first Space Shuttle mission in 1981, when two technicians died from asphyxiation after they walked into a space located in the Shuttle's Mobile Launcher <b>Platform</b> <b>that</b> was pressurised with pure nitrogen as a precaution against fire.|$|E
5|$|Another {{potential}} Guitar Hero {{project was}} discovered by the archival site Unseen64 for a game titled Hero World, a massively multiplayer online game that would link the Guitar Hero and DJ Hero games. The game had been developed by FreeStyleGames, sometime {{after the release of}} DJ Hero 2, with the main development duties passed to Virtual Fairground, using their platform The Ride, an Adobe Flash-based <b>platform</b> <b>that</b> would let the game be played in a web browser. The game was cancelled in 2011 along with other pending Guitar Hero projects.|$|E
5|$|Before the First World War, the Spanish Army {{bought a}} Schneider-Brillié in 1909 {{to be used}} in Melilla, where armed {{conflict}} with local tribes was going on. This was a French bus <b>platform</b> <b>that</b> was fitted with an armoured body, to be used as troop transport. Although it was big, slow and its performance was not good, the Spanish Army learned the value of armored vehicles and bought a second one. Spanish Army officers appreciated the advantages of using advanced weapons technology in the Colonial War in Spanish Morocco and followed First World War advances.|$|E

5|$|Bradley {{declared}} his candidacy {{early for the}} Republican gubernatorial nomination in 1895, and no real challenger emerged prior to the Republicans' nominating convention. Consequently, Bradley was nominated in a relatively harmonious convention. The major issue of the campaign was whether the country should maintain a monetary system based on the gold standard or allow the coinage of silver {{at a ratio of}} 16 to 1, commonly called the free silver position. At their convention, the Republicans adopted a <b>platform</b> <b>that</b> was unequivocally in favor of the gold standard.|$|E
5|$|Bush portrayed {{himself as}} a {{compassionate}} conservative, implying he was more centrist than other Republicans.

By early 2000, the race had centered on Bush and McCain.|$|E

Subsequent series became larger, culminating with the fourth generation Commodore, fully developed in Australia {{and based on the}} GM Zeta platform.|$|E
5|$|Group 18 Structure 2 is on {{the east}} side of the plaza. Its {{earliest}} phase dates to the Late Preclassic. The Preclassic remains consist of a low north wall running east-west.
