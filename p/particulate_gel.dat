DETAILED DESCRIPTION - A <b>particulate</b> <b>gel</b> {{material with}} sensitized phase transition behavior having a mobile phase of controlled permeability is prepared by two-stage polymerization comprising: (a) formation of a thermally sensitized hydrogel core by radical heterophase polymerization of a water soluble monomer system showing corresponding phase transition behavior in the presence of crosslinkers, with stabilization in a continuous oil phase, and (b) coating of the hydrogel core with a closed porous shell. In stage (a) the particle size of the particles obtained, assuming appropriate synthesis conditions, is 0. 7 - 50 micron, and the degree of swelling of the sensitized material in a solvent is restricted by the crosslinker level. In stage (b) the porous shell is selected from a monomer/crosslinker system of solution properties opposite to those of the sensitized hydrogel cores and is applied to the sensitized hydrogel cores by precipitation polymerization in the continuous oil phase, in which the open porosity and thus the required permeability is established by setting the precipitation conditions for polymerization. USE - The <b>particulate</b> <b>gel</b> material in useful in the production of plastics for permeable roads and tracks.

40|$|We {{identify}} {{the sequence of}} microstructural changes that characterize the evolution of an attractive <b>particulate</b> <b>gel</b> under flow and discuss their implications on macroscopic rheology. Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD) is used to monitor shear-driven evolution of a fabric tensor constructed from the ensemble spatial configuration of individual attractive constituents within the gel. By decomposing this tensor into isotropic and non-isotropic components we show that the average coordination number correlates directly with the flow curve of the shear stress vs. shear rate, consistent with theoretical predictions for attractive systems. We show that the evolution in non-isotropic local particle rearrangements are primarily responsible for stress overshoots (strain-hardening) at the inception of steady shear flow and also lead, at larger times and longer scales, to microstructural localization phenomena such as shear banding flow-induced structure formation in the vorticity direction.

40|$|The {{rheological}} behaviour of biopolymer gels with different network structures was studied to elucidate how {{the structure of}} the gel influences its rheological properties. Non-destructive viscoelastic measurements and fracture techniques were used. The different types of structures studied were fine-stranded <b>gels,</b> <b>particulate</b> <b>gels,</b> inhomogeneous gels and mixed gels. The biopolymer gels chosen as the model systems were one protein, b-lactoglobulin, two polysaccharides, k-carrageenan and locust bean gum. b-Lactoglobulin forms gels on heating and develops different structures depending on pH: a particulate network at intermediate pH (4 - 6) and a fine-stranded network below and above this interval. It can also form inhomogeneous networks depending on pH or heating rate. The two polysaccharides formed mixed fine-stranded gels of various structures depending on the ionic form of k-carrageenan and on type and concentration of cations. The fine-stranded gels of b-lactoglobulin were compared with the <b>particulate</b> <b>gels</b> of the same biopolymer. The <b>particulate</b> <b>gels</b> were stiffer with a higher modulus, G', than the fine-stranded gels at equal concentrations and formed gels at lower concentrations. The gelation of the <b>particulate</b> <b>gels</b> started at temperatures below the denaturation temperature, Td, and proceeded in two steps with the second step coinciding with Td. A method for measuring fracture properties of the gels in tension was developed. The fine-stranded b-lactoglobulin gels formed at low pH were brittle whereas those formed at high pH were rubber-like. The stiffness at large deformations, E, had two maxima, one at pH 4, where a mixed network was formed and one around pH 6 where an inhomogeneous network was formed. It was shown that b-lactoglobulin forms inhomogeneous networks at pH 5. 3 and 7. 5 if the gel is formed at slow heating. At pH 7. 5 the inhomogeneities were formed as a result of microphase separation in the incipient network. G' of these gels showed a stronger frequency dependence at low frequencies than at high, caused by different relaxation times in the dense and loose regions of the network. The inhomogeneous <b>particulate</b> <b>gels</b> at pH 5. 3 had a network structure containing some large pores where fracture started. The strand structure differed between the homogeneous and inhomogeneous <b>particulate</b> <b>gels</b> causing different storage moduli. Mixed gels of the potassium form of k-carrageenan and locust bean gum showed synergistic effects in a KCl-concentration 0. 1 M KCl. The synergistic effects probably originated from a different effect at low KCl-concentration than at high KCl-concentration. The sodium and calcium forms did not show any synergistic effects, neither did the mixed gels of the potassium form in high KCl-concentration (0. 2 M) ...|$|R
40|$|Strong <b>particulate</b> <b>gels</b> {{are widely}} {{believed}} to behave poroelastically in compression, e. g. in sedimentation, even though they consolidate irreversibly because of the stickiness of the particles. <b>Particulate</b> <b>gels</b> are usually adhesive as well as cohesive and so wall effects {{are to be expected}} in general [Michaels & Bolger (1962) ]. These are rarely manifest on process engineering scales, although they can be important in the laboratory and with formulated products in small containers. When the assumption of non-linear poroelasticity is combined with the idea that adhesive failure (yield) is brittle, relatively speaking, a prescription emerges for the ratio of shear to compressive strength S and how this varies with density. S is predicted to be of order unity at the gel-point and then to increase rapidly thereafter. The predictions are consistent with the experimental data available for both dilute and concentrated gels, although more data would be welcome. A critique of a recent paper by Condre et al. (2007) on wall effects in very dilute gels is given in which it is argued, amongst other things, that {{it is not necessary to}} invoke granular in order to account for their results, simple adhesion suffices.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Particulate</b> <b>gels</b> {{are known}} to be formed by bovine β-lactoglobulin near the isoelectric point when partial {{unfolding}} is allowed to occur under heating. The aggregation process of the protein has been investigated {{within the context of a}} nucleation and growth process by preparing gels under precisely con-trolled thermal histories. This was achieved using a Differential Scanning Calorimeter (DSC) to provide controlled heating rates, and known final temperatures and incubation times. The resulting <b>particulate</b> <b>gels</b> were characterized by their particle size and polydispersity using Environmental Scanning Electron Microscopy (ESEM), which permits hydrated samples to be observed. Particle size was found to decrease with increasing final temperature, with the aggregation taking longer to reach completion for lower tem-peratures. Particle size was also found to decrease with increasing heating rate. This system could be modelled as evolving via nucleation and growth by taking into account the fact that the concentration of the aggregating species was varying as a function of temperature as well as time. The intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence as a function of temperature was used as a guide to the fraction of unfolded protein in solu-tion, thereby permitting successful comparisons between the model predictions and the particle sizes to be made.

40|$|The {{interaction}} between two gelled alginate surfaces {{in a variety}} of solution environments was studied using a Texture Analyser. The influence of both the applied force and contact time on adhesion was investigated. The Young 2 ̆ 7 s modulus of the alginate gels in each environment was also determined. It was found that experiments performed in calcium chloride solutions with pre-cut flat surfaces offered the best reproducibility of measurements, due to the removal of the driving force for calcium exchange to the surrounding solution. Systematic trends were observed for this particular system: an increase in either applied force or contact time between the gelled surfaces gave rise to higher adhesion values. This study provides a solid protocol for investigating interactions between gelled biopolymer surfaces and has implications in particle-particle interaction and bulk rheological behaviour in <b>particulate</b> <b>gel</b> systems.

Four different structures ofEWG were prepared combining various pH and ionic strength conditions before heating. The extent ofdigestion, estimated by the appearance of soluble peptides, was greater for the <b>particulate</b> <b>gel</b> comprisingspherical aggregates as compared to the filamentous gel comprising linear aggregates. This result may beexplained by an alteration of enzyme diffusion due to the microstructural characteristics of the gel, or analteration of digestive enzyme adsorption or catalytic activity due to local differences in pH within the gelmatrices. Peptide identification using LC-MS/MS highlighted that the aggregate morphology modulatedovotransferrin hydrolysis which resulted in the release of specific peptides depending on the EWGstructure.

The ultrathin films (50 nm in thickness) are formed in situ in the shear cell through a reaction at the toluene−water interface between a metal−organic compound in the organic layer and an appropriate reagent for sulfidation in the aqueous layer. Linear viscoelastic spectra of the nanofilms reveal solid-like rheological behavior with the storage modulus {{higher than the}} loss modulus over the range of angular frequencies probed. Large strain amplitude sweep measurements on the CdS nanofilms formed at different reactant concentrations suggest that they form a weakly flocculated gel. Under steady shear, the films exhibit a yield stress, followed by a steady shear thinning at high shear rates. The viscoelastic and flow behavior of these films that are in common with those of many 3 D “soft” materials like gels, foams, and concentrated colloidal suspensions can be described by the “soft” glassy rheology model...|$|E

Specific examples of recent research conducted in our laboratory using Raman, micro-Raman and FT-Raman spectroscopy will be described to illustrate their appli-cations for investigating protein-protein, protein-lipid, and protein-polysaccharide interactions, and for elucidating structure-function relationships of whey proteins and peptides. Raman spectroscopy was used to discriminate between structural changes of β-lactoglobulin in transparent fine-stranded versus particulate gels. Formation of <b>particulate</b> <b>gel</b> structures led to a more hydrophilic or exposed microenvironment around tryptophan residues, compared to a more hydrophobic microenviron-ment in translucent gels. A decrease in the α-helical content was more pronounced in translucent gels, while both types of gels retained considerable β-sheet structures, consistent with the known heat-resistance of the β-barrel structure of β-lactoglobulin.

30|$|By definition, a sol is a {{two-phase}} {{suspension of}} colloidal particles in a liquid, while gels {{are regarded as}} composites because they consist of a solid skeleton or network that encloses a liquid phase or an excess of the solvent. Therefore, the sol-gel process, as the name implies, is a wet-chemical technique that involves transition from a liquid ‘sol’ into a solid ‘gel’ phase. Colloidal particles {{can be in the}} approximate size range of 1 to 1, 000 [*]nm; hence, gravitational forces on these particles are negligible, and interactions are dominated by both short-range forces and surface charges. To prepare sols, usually, inorganic metal salts and/or organometallic compounds such as metal alkoxides are used as precursors. Sols are formed after a series of hydrolysis and condensation reactions of the precursors. Then, the sol particles condense into a continuous liquid gel phase. Besides, a sol might be prepared by dispersion of colloidal particles in a liquid, followed by destabilization of the sol to produce a <b>particulate</b> <b>gel.</b> With further drying and heat treatment, the gel is then converted into dense ceramic or glass materials (Morris 2011).

40|$|This thesis aims {{to develop}} a better {{understanding}} of both the formation and properties of fluid gels using the microstructural engineering approach. In general terms, the two main outcomes of this research are: (1) advancing the knowledge on the structuring processes for fluid gel design and (2) developing new models for the structure-function relationship for fluid gels. There is currently a lack of understanding on the formation of thermo-stable fluid gels due to the absence of processing techniques for their production. In this thesis, two processing techniques were developed to produce thermo-stable fluid gels from alginates. The first technique is a continuous process comprising a pin stirrer device with a Ca 2 +-injection system. The second production technique used a cup and vane rheometer combined with an internal gelation method. With this technique, the kinetics of fluid gel formation was studied as function of applied shear rate, calcium concentration and alginate molecular weight. With regard to the structure-function relationship, the lubricating behaviour of agar fluid gels was explored using a new approach which consisted in decoupling the contributions of the continuous phase and the <b>particulate</b> <b>gelled</b> phase.

40|$|Several {{methods for}} {{measuring}} the compressive strength of strong particulate gels are available, including the centrifuge method, whereby the strength {{as a function of}} volume-fraction is obtained parametrically from the dependence of equilibrium sediment height upon acceleration. The analysis used conventionally due to Buscall & White (1987) ignores the possibility that the particulate network might adhere to the walls of the centrifuge tube, even though many types of cohesive <b>particulate</b> <b>gel</b> can be expected to. The neglect of adhesion is justifiable when the ratio of the shear to compressive strength is small, which it can be for many systems away from the gel-point, but never very near it. The errors arising from neglect of adhesion are investigated theoretically and quantified by synthesising equilibrium sediment height versus acceleration data for various degrees of adhesion and then analysing them in the conventional manner. Approximate correction factors suggested by dimensionless analysis are then tested. The errors introduced by certain other approximations made routinely in order to render the data-inversion practicable are analysed too. For example, it shown that the error introduced by treating the acceleration vector as approximately one-dimensional is minuscule for typical centrifuge dimensions, whereas making this assumption renders the data inversion tractable.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{aggregation}} process leading to gel formation in colloidal dispersions under quiescent conditions {{in order to}} identify possible precursor aggregate distributions for particulate gels. The aggregation process is described with an experimentally validated population balance model, which allows us to calculate how the aggregate mass distribution evolves in time. When the cumulative occupied volume fraction of fractal aggregates reaches a certain limit, the random cluster-cluster aggregation regime crosses over to an interconnection regime, and a gel network forms. The aggregate distribution {{at the end of the}} aggregation regime is the precursor for the subsequently formed <b>particulate</b> <b>gel.</b> We demonstrate that, when aggregation proceeds fully in the reaction-limited regime, the precursor aggregate distribution depends only on the solid volume fraction while being insensitive to both the primary particle size and the stability ratio. However, the stability ratio is an important operating parameter controlling the overall aggregation and gelation time. The situation can be significantly changed by entering the diffusion-limited aggregation regime. The interplay among these various factors is illustrated through an example of the optimal design of the precursor aggregate distribution. Primary particle size, solid volume fraction, and stability ratio are used as design parameters, and the objective function is formulated in terms of specific requirements on the precursor cluster mass distribution. These requirements were determined on the basis of qualitative arguments about the relation between the precursor structure and the gel mechanical properties...|$|E

Three coating polymers were tested: Pluronics (PEG-PPG-PEG), poly(PPGMA-co-PEGMA) and poly(PNIPAm-DMA+). These were first tested as a dilute solution for clouding behaviour and then added to PLGA nanoparticles dispersions and tested rheologically for gel behaviour. These three polymers were chosen for their amphiphilic nature which may allow for surface attachment and decreasing miscibility with temperature. The PLGA copolymer in this work contained 75 % lactic acid and 25 % glycolic acid, and {{was made into a}} nanoparticle dispersion by interfacial deposition. The Pluronic L 62 showed a promising cloud point temperature (Tclpt) of 37 °C, but did not show gel behaviour with the PLGA dispersions. It conferred thermally triggered aggregation, which may be useful as a drug delivery system. The poly(PPGMA-PEGMA) was synthesised using a free radical polymerisation feed method. These copolymers showed promising Tclpt values (20 - 37 °C) but only showed increased viscosity when heated at high concentration and when mixed with a PLGA dispersion. The structure-property relationships for these copolymers were analysed. Poly(NIPAM-DMA+) showed gelation at low concentrations without the particles, when the particle dispersion was added the gel maintained its strength up to 300 % strain.

We investigate a capillary suspension to determine how the network ages and restructures at rest and under applied external shear deformation. The present work uses calcium carbonate suspended in silicone oil (11 % solids) with added water as a model system. Aging of capillary suspensions and their response to applied oscillatory shear is distinctly different from <b>particulate</b> <b>gels</b> dominated by the van der Waals forces. The suspensions dominated by the capillary force are very sensitive to oscillatory flow, with the linear viscoelastic re-gime ending at a deformation of only 0. 1 % and demonstrating power-law aging behavior. This aging persists for long times at low deformations or for shorter times with a sudden de-crease in the strength at higher deformations. This aging behavior suggests that the network is able to rearrange and even rupture. This same sensitivity is not demonstrated in shear flow where very high shear rates are required to rupture the agglomerates returning the apparent viscosity of capillary suspensions to the same viscosity as for the pure vdW sus-pension. A transitional region is also present at intermediate water contents wherein the material response depends very strongly on the type, strength, and duration of the external forcing...|$|R

Aerogels can be prepared {{in a variety of}} ways, and though most have been based on silica, materials based on zirconia, titania, cellulose, polyurethane, and resorcinol—formaldehyde systems, amongst others, have been reported and explored. The prime disadvantage of a silica-based aerogel is its fragility, though NASA has used them for insulation on Mars rovers, the Mars Pathfinder and they have been used commercially for insulating blankets and between glass panes for translucent day-lighting panels. <b>Particulate</b> <b>gels</b> prepared by the Stöber process can be dehydrated rapidly to produce highly effective silica aerogels, as well as xerogels. They key step is the use of supercritical fluid extraction to remove water from the gel while maintaining the gel structure, which is typically done with supercritical carbon dioxide, as NASA does. The resulting aerogels are very effective thermal insulators because of their high porosity with very small pores (in the nanometre range). Conduction of heat through the gas phase is poor, and as the structure greatly inhibits movement of air molecules through the structure, heat transfer through the material is poor, {{as can be seen in}} the image at right where heat from a Bunsen burner transfers so poorly that crayons resting on the aerogel do not melt. Due to their low density, aerogels have also been used to capture interstellar dust particles with minimal heat changes in slowing them down (to prevent heat-induced changes in the particles) as part of the Stardust mission.|$|R

As such, gelled hypergolic propellants are being investigated for use in standard impinging jet configurations. By understanding the effect of shear rate on gel viscosity, at the same shear rate it will experience in the injector orifice, one can estimate how readily a gel will break up into a spray under shear stress. The {{purpose of this study}} was to build a propellant grade high-shear capillary rheometer for use with gelled hypergolic propellants and obtain viscosity measurements for gels at shear rates of 105 to 106 1 /s. ^ The high shear capillary rheometer was constructed and validated with a NIST standard calibration oil and a COMSOL Multiphysics model. After validation, the viscosity of two hydroxypropylcellulose (HPC) based gels and six nano silica based <b>particulate</b> <b>gels</b> were measured with a commercial rotational rheometer and high shear capillary rheometer. High shear rate viscosity measurements simulate injector orifices and low shear rotational rheometer measurements simulate propellant storage and loading conditions. ^ The viscosity of monomethylhydrazine (MMH) /silica gel at high shear was found to be 0. 0124 ± 0. 0006 Pa·s. Liquid MMH has a viscosity of 0. 00086 Pa·s, indicating the gel has not reached the liquid viscosity by experiencing high shear stress.

40|$|The {{morphology}} of beta-lactoglobulin structures inside droplets was studied during aggregation and gelation using confocal {{laser scanning}} microscopy (CISM) equipped with a temperature stage and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results showed {{that there is a}} strong driving force for the protein to move to the interface between oil and water in the droplet, and the beta-lactoglobulin formed a dense shell around the droplet built up from the inside of the droplets. Less protein was found inside the droplets. The longer the beta-lactoglobulin was allowed to aggregate prior to gel formation, the larger the part of the protein went to the interface, resulting in a thicker shell and very little material being left inside the droplets. The droplets were easily deformed because no network stabilizes them. When 0. 5 % emulsifier, polyglycerol polyresinoleat (PGPR), was added to the oil phase, the beta-lactoglobulin was situated both inside the droplets and at the interface between the droplets and the oil phase; when 2 % PGPR was added, the beta-lactoglobulin structure was concentrated {{to the inside of the}} droplets. The possibility to use the different morphological structures of beta-lactoglobulin in droplets to control the diffusion rate through a beta-lactoglobulin network was evaluated by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). The results show differences in the diffusion rate due to heterogeneities in the structure: the diffusion of a large water-soluble molecule, FITC-dextran, in a dense <b>particulate</b> <b>gel</b> was 1 / 4 of the diffusion rate in a more open particulate beta-lactoglobulin gel in which the diffusion rate was similar to that in pure water...|$|E
40|$|A {{simple and}} popular {{constitutive}} model {{used to describe}} the compressional strength of a consolidating strongly cohesive <b>particulate</b> <b>gel</b> is tested further with new experimental data. Strong cohesive particulate gels have variously been described as being ratchet (poro) elastic, on the one hand, and as having a yield stress in compression, on the other, to the point where same groups of workers have used both descriptions at one time or another. The dichotomy is real though as such gels do show a hitherto somewhat puzzling elastic-plastic duality. This can be explained in part by the strong concentration dependence of the modulus since this leads to irreversible volumetric strain-hardening, in effect, the ratchet; but only in small part. The real problem seems to be that, until very recently, most work on consolidation has neglected what what Michaels and Bolger told us to do over 50 years ago, viz. to take into wall adhesion into account, most cohesive particulate gels being adhesive too. Since wall adhesive failure is plastic in character, the simplest non-linear elastic model of compressive strength can be combined with the simplest possible model of wall debonding to produce a approximate complete constitutive description. Examples of the use of such a description in detailed modelling of consolidation equilibrium can be found in refs 10 - 12. Consolidation dynamics with wall adhesion is a substantial modelling challenge remaining to be tackled. Comment: The earlier extended abstract has been extended to a letter of 8 pages with 8 figs.

Through dynamic light scattering and size measurements it was possible to observe that EF treatment applied around critical <b>particulate</b> <b>gel</b> formation conditions (pH near isolectric point and high ionic strength medium) resulted in a whey gel less prone to formation of large aggregates and protein sedimentation. Structural characterization was assessed by dissolving the formed gels in various reducing and non-reducing buffers. Results showed that the hydrogel formed under an EF was almost completely solubilized in water (> 60 %) and largely soluble in NaCl 6 M (> 30 %), SDS or urea (> 45 %) buffers, without using a reducing agent thus showing the importance of non-covalent and electrostatic interactions in maintaining the gel structure. As conclusion, the presence of an EF during heating favor whey proteins’ water binding properties resulting in a more stable dispersions of β-lactoglobulin aggregates with different mechanical and microstructual features...|$|E
40|$|Many gastropods, such as snails and slugs, crawl using {{adhesive}} locomotion, {{a technique}} that allows the organisms to climb walls and walk across ceilings. These animals stick to the crawling surface by excreting {{a thin layer of}} biopolymer mucin gel, known as pedal mucus, and their acrobatic ability is {{due in large part to}} the theological properties of this slime. The primary application of the present research is to enable a mechanical crawler to climb walls and walk across ceilings using adhesive locomotion. A properly selected slime simulant will enable a mechanical crawler to optimally perform while climbing in the horizontal, inclined, and inverted positions. To this end, the rheology of gastropod pedal mucus is examined in greater detail than any previously published work. The linear rheological response of pedal mucus is examined with flow, oscillation, and creep tests. Nonlinear rheology is examined with large amplitude oscillatory shear (LAOS), and analyzed with Lissajous curves, Fourier transform rheology, and a new measure of non-linear elasticity. In addition, pedal mucus is examined with a flexure-based microgap rheometer, which can test the sample at the biologically relevant gap of 10 - 20 lim, the measured thickness of pedal mucus under a crawling slug. (Cont.) Adhesive locomotion of a mechanical crawler is modeled in order to find the criteria for an optimal slime simulant. After developing the selection criteria for the ideal simulant, a range of candidate materials are examined including polymeric <b>gels,</b> <b>particulate</b> <b>gels,</b> emulsions, composites, and field-responsive fluids. Two promising simulants are examined in detail and compared with native gastropod pedal mucus. by Randy H. Ewoldt. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|The heat-induced {{structure}} formation by the globular protein, b- lactoglobulin, {{has been}} studied {{over a wide range}} of solution conditions and heating regimes. The results are split into two main categories corresponding to the regimes in which b -lactoglobulin forms fine stranded and <b>particulate</b> <b>gels.</b> In the fine stranded regime (non-isoelectric pH), b- lactoglobulin was found to form highly ordered structures which bound the amyloid specific dyes Congo red and Thioflavin T. In the case of the pH 2. 5 and no added NaCl, the X-ray fibre diffraction pattern was found to correspond well to that of amyloid. Higher order structures in the form of spherulites composed of assemblies of amyloid fibrils were also investigated. The kinetics of fibril formation in b -lactoglobulin was investigated and modelled using a theory based on a slow forwards reaction, generating an active species followed by a critical stable nucleus size dependent nucleation and growth. In the particulate regime (isoelectric pH), the gel structures were investigated using Environmental SEM, confocal microscopy and small angle X-ray scattering. The gels were found to comprise densely packed particles with fractal surfaces. The effects of ionic strength, pH, protein concentration and heating regime {{on the size of the}} particles were investigated. Increasing heating rate and holding temperature were found to decrease the particle size, with ionic strength increasing particle size. A peak in particle size was found as a function of pH as the isoelectric point was approached. These results were described in terms of two models. The first model, based on a temperature imposed equilibrium size, accounts well for the decrease in particle size with holding temperature. The second model based on a nucleation rate which is dependent on the temperature via the unfolding transition, was more successful at describing the heating rate dependence.

40|$|The {{exploration}} of microstructures and textures of protein based systems {{is essential to}} understand (oral) breakdown properties and thereby textural aspects, or macroscopic functionalities such as water holding. Upon structure breakdown, the applied energy (W) is primarily directed towards fracture (Wf) for <b>particulate</b> <b>gels.</b> For stranded gels the applied energy is either elastically stored (Ws) or dissipated (Wd). The energy balance can then be denoted as W= Ws+Wd+Wf. 1 The fore mentioned mechanical properties {{have been shown to}} relate to texture perception that may go from ‘spreadable’ to ‘crumbly’ for particulate and stranded networks, respectively. 2, 3 Understanding of how to control the energy balance with regard to microstructure and texture perception is of key importance for the food industry to modulate their products towards desired sensory properties, especially when new (alternative) protein sources are involved. Texture is to a large extent determined by the properties of the structural elements and their mutual interactions. These structural aspects stem from the aggregation behaviour of the individual proteins, which in turn is determined by the molecular characteristics and their ability to interact during processing. Subsequently, an assembled microstructure may consist of molecules (nm) and protein molecules that are assembled into flexible fine stranded structure elements (0. 1 - 5 mm), and coarse stranded or particle shaped structure elements (5 - 50 mm). At any length scale, protein (structure elements) can be subjected to (food grade) chemical or enzymatic modification to tune their function in a spatial network. Up to now, this was however only done for proteins at a molecular level. Functionalization of specific structure elements and their interactions is a tool in understanding which length scales are relevant for tuning texture and breakdown properties. The type, shape and dimensions of these structure elements determine the efficiency and gel strength of the established spatial network. Hence, this work sketches the potential of different types of structure elements made from gelatin, whey protein and soy protein to direct macroscopic behaviour is discussed. On a molecular scale, modulation of gelatine is performed to alter its assembly into fine stranded networks and the subsequent macroscopic breakdown behaviour. Modification of whey protein is performed on an aggregate level to show the efficiency of thiolation of different supramolecular structures (fibrillar and amorphous aggregates) with regard to gelation propensity. On a microstructural level, particulate soy protein networks are tuned through the presence of calcium salts for their fracture behaviour. We show that control over texture and macroscopic properties can be obtained by modulation of protein functionality at different levels of protein organization...|$|R

These factors may determine treatment effectiveness, safety, and longevity; however, this requires confirmation in the clinic. Methods: To compare the efficacy, safety, and longevity of two distinct HA-based dermal fillers in the correction of severe nasolabial folds (NLFs), a 24 mg/mL smooth gel (Juvederm ULTRA PLUS&trade; [JUP]) and a 20 mg/mL <b>particulate</b> <b>gel</b> (Perlane&reg; [PER]) were injected {{in a total of}} 80 normal, healthy subjects using a split face design and were followed for 12 months in this prospective, randomized, controlled, multicenter study. Results: Both fillers achieved a clinically relevant NLF correction (one point or more improvement, based on a validated NLF severity scale). However, JUP displayed greater longevity, with this correction maintained in a significantly larger percentage of NLFs after 6 months (physician&# 39;s evaluation) or 9 months (subject&# 39;s evaluation) and thereafter {{for the remainder of the}} study (70 % vs 45 %; P = 0. 0002 and 62. 5 % vs 46. 3 %; P = 0. 01 at month 12, based on physician and subject assessments, respectively). At month 12, 71. 4 % of the subjects nominated a preference for the NLF injected with JUP (P &lt; 0. 0001). Both treatments were well tolerated. Conclusion: These results suggest that different physicochemical properties of HA-based fillers, associated with distinct manufacturing technologies, may influence treatment longevity in the correction of volume deficits. This may relate to a differential resistance to hyaluronidase and/or free radical degradation as previously documented in vitro.

40|$|The {{microstructure}} of particulate biopolymer gels {{has been}} studied to comprehend the effect of microstructure on textural properties. Particulate structures have been characterized at different levels by using light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. Various microstructural parameters have been defined for particulate structures. Methods for quantification have been developed and particulate structures have been quantified. Two different systems have been analysed: dispersions of starch particles and particulate protein gels. The microstructure of particulate gels has been related to texture, as measured instrumentally and by sensory perception. Two protein systems were chosen as <b>particulate</b> <b>gel</b> model systems, (-lactoglobulin and whey protein, WPC. Both proteins form gels on heating and particulate gels are formed around the iso-electrical point (&# 8764; pH 5. 2). Fine-stranded gels were formed at high pH, above pH 6, and at low pH, below 4, when no salt was added. In order to comprehend the size concept in microstructural terms, such as individual particles or clusters, particles in a dispersion were analysed. The size of industrially produced spherical starch particles was estimated by using light microscopy in combination with image analysis. Methods for size estimation were analysed taking clustering and orientation of clusters into account. Quantification of microstructural parameters facilitated the structural analysis of {{a large amount of}} samples and the statistical correlation of structure with the perceived texture. A stereological approach was used to estimate the size of pores and particles in the particulate gels. The size was estimated by the star volume. Three-dimensional features, such as strand characteristics and clustering phenomena, have been defined and quantified in an objective manner by the trained human experts on a microstructural panel. The microstructural data was correlated to textural data. It was found that the microstructure can explain texture, as measured instrumentally or perceived sensorily. Microstructural parameters of particulate protein gels can be divided into two groups: overall network characteristics (pore size and particle size) and strand characteristics ('mode of aggregation'). The test principles of analysing texture can also be divided into two groups: destructive tests and non-destructive tests. The texture analysed by using a large force, either when perceived sensorily (chewing or the appearance of a newly cut surface) or when measured instrumentally (tensile tests), was sensitive to the overall network dimensions. The texture analysed by using a small deformation, either as perceived sensorily by pressing lightly with the forefinger or as measured viscoelastically, was shown {{to be sensitive to the}} strand characteristics of the particulate gels...|$|E

For the study we used novel excipient, consisting of two components: silver containing finely <b>particulate</b> sorbent: chitosan <b>gel</b> in ratio one-to-one. Novel sorbent agent, taken for study, consists of thermally activated silica containing aluminum hydroxide in the form of its modification silver. Experiment was conducted on 48 Wistar models in case of scalp (degloving) wound (abscission of skin area 30 – 40 mm 2 in size on depilated side surface) and chemical burn (applying 1 – 2 drops of 70 % sulfuric acid on the depilated surface side.   Regenerating activity was evaluated based on morphometry area of the wound surface, fixing the rate of scarring.  Evaluation was made histologically on 4 th - micrometers paraffin sections, stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and semithin sections, stained with toluidine blue. The results of study. Composition (paste) developed from silver containing finely particulate sorbent: chitosan gel sped up (for 3 days) the process of reparative regeneration of tissue on the model of chemical burns, helped to structuring formations in skin by the type of granuloma, {{at the same time there}} were no signs of perifocal inflammation.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this thesis is the {{relation}} between the rheological and structural properties of mixed <b>particulate</b> <b>gels,</b> based on &# 946;-lactoglobulin, determined under both dynamic and static conditions. Rheological characteristics were recorded during formation of the gels, on set gels and during deformation and fracture of the gels, using viscoelastic measurements in shear and in compression and fracture mechanics in tension. Structure evolution, structure in the set state and structural behaviour during deformation were evaluated with the microstructural methods of light microscopy (LM), confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) on different length scales. The microstructure was quantified by image analysis. Structure-fracture measurements, a new type of technique, were used, where rheological behaviour and structural alterations during deformation and fracture were measured simultaneously. The model structures used were generated by altering the kinetics of aggregation of &# 946;-lactoglobulin using potato amylopectin. The &# 946;-lactoglobulin structures formed were particulate networks varying in density of the overall network structure, size of pores and clusters, density of clusters and connectivity of strands and clusters. The main message from this thesis is that structural behaviour during deformation and fracture is strongly correlated to the way the structure is evolved. It is thus possible to predict what structural characteristic control a certain rheological property if a combination of dynamic and static measurements is used on different length scales. Higher gel strength is related to increased density of clusters as long as the connectivity between clusters in the strands is maintained. Stress at fracture is more sensitive to changes in connectivity than the storage modulus. Strain at fracture is controlled by the ability of clusters and strands to alter in form and to extend during deformation. Unique information on the connectivity and stretchability of the structures was obtained through recording the structure while it was being extended. It was feasible to relate the structural differences: stretching of clusters contra brittle fracture of clusters and merging of small voids into larger cracks contra rapid fracture without pore formation, to differences in stress-strain behaviour and crack propagation. This work shows that the kinetics of aggregation and gel formation of &# 946;-lactoglobulin are strongly influenced by variations in the concentration and molecular weight of amylopectin. Both increased concentration and increased molecular weight induce acceleration of the aggregation mechanism into particle aggregates and clusters and reduction of the gelling temperature. The altered kinetics resulted in different microstructures of the &# 946;-lactoglobulin, which on an overall level of structure become more open the higher the concentration and the higher the molecular weight of amylopectin. Open network structures were constructed of large and dense &# 946;-lactoglobulin clusters, while dense network structures were formed of smaller and more open clusters. Increased gel strength coincided with a rise in the density of clusters as long as the connectivity of the &# 946;-lactoglobulin strands of clusters was unaffected. At a sufficiently high concentration and molecular weight of amylopectin, the continued aggregation to a connected network was prevented during the structure formation due to decreased mobility of the &# 946;-lactoglobulin constituents in the highly viscous medium, resulting in poorer connectivity of the finished gel. As a result, fracture of the structure occurred via large sheets of clusters...|$|R
40|$|Understanding the {{influence}} of the fabrics microstructure on frictional noise was investigated in terms of surface roughness for three multi-fibre apparel fabrics (denim, cotton and silk) and single-fibre polyester model fabrics. Surface roughness (R_a) correlated strongly with total noise emitted (R^ 2 = 0. 97) and was attributed to the ‘hairy’ nature of multi-fibre fabrics. In terms of specific frequencies emitted within a fabric’s sound spectrum, the microstructure of the model fabrics was strongly correlated (R^ 2 = 1. 00) with the fundamental harmonic predicted, enabling a ‘fingerprint’ theory to be proposed. Friction coefficients, measured using tribology, of apparel and model fabrics were established, and showed that the major impact on friction was R_a and fibre type. Furthermore, friction was reduced via the lubrication of hydrocolloid fluid <b>gel</b> <b>particulates,</b> by means of reducing the surface roughness by filling in asperities and reducing the hairy nature of the fibres. Consumer perceptions of fabrics and fabric sounds were established with one-to-one interviews, and {{the influence}} of sound on sensory perception and liking was established by manipulating real-time fabric sounds, showing that by altering high and low frequencies, and overall noise, a significant difference in sensory attribute 'textured' can be observed...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{effects of}} glucose and {{glycerol}} on the lubrication properties of agar fluid gels {{have been studied}} using soft tribology. A novel approach using the sediment and supernatant of centrifuged fluid gels has allowed investigation of the distinct contributions of both the <b>gelled</b> <b>particulate</b> phase and the continuous phase on fluid gel tribology. The friction coefficient of both the particulate phase and fluid gels was significantly {{lower than that of}} the continuous phase across the three lubrication regimes. This indicates that particle entrainment occurs at all entrainment speeds, enhancing lubrication by prevention of surface contact. Softer fluid gel particles produced with intermediate levels of glycerol (up to 30 %) show increased friction as would be expected for an increased contact area between the tribological surfaces. At high levels of glycerol, the friction does not increase. It is proposed that soft particles are produced but the increasing friction is overcome with the increased lubrication from the more highly viscous continuous phase. In contrast, the presence of intermediate levels of glucose (up to 30 %) increases the friction of the aqueous continuous phase but does not affect the particle properties. Texture analysis, rheology and light scattering techniques were used to elucidate the structural changes of the fluid gels induced by the addition of co-solutes and the influence this has upon lubrication...|$|R
