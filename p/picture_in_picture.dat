40|$|The {{general purpose}} of this {{dissertation}} is to study <b>picture</b> communication <b>in</b> <b>picture</b> books and it addresses the following questions: What is the illustrator’s role {{in the process of}} making a picture book? What communicative qualities do <b>pictures</b> have <b>in</b> <b>picture</b> books and how do pictures interact with texts? What methods do illustrators use to visualize the meaning of stories <b>in</b> <b>picture</b> books? A genre analysis, a literature study and an interview of a professional illustrator has been conducted to answer the questions. I found that all objects that make up pictures, the arrangement, colours and shapes contribute to the meaning <b>in</b> diverse ways. <b>Pictures</b> also communicate <b>in</b> a different way than texts. An important difference between <b>pictures</b> and texts <b>in</b> the context of <b>picture</b> books is that pictures are more open for interpretation. Text <b>in</b> <b>picture</b> books can help to define the meaning of pictures but if the text and the pictures are too coherent the message may feel repetitive and might not engage the reader.   Pictures do more easily provoke feelings and are more suited for descriptions. The notion of movement is also essential <b>in</b> <b>picture</b> books. The illustrator’s task is to interpret the text and form characters, scenes and ambiences, and to keep the story moving forward. After my study it is clear that communication <b>in</b> <b>picture</b> books varies a lot. Illustrators relate to texts very differently and have a lot of possibilities to use different methods and styles to approach the meaning of stories...|$|R
