50|$|It is 223 pages long, and {{consists}} of two roughly equal halves, titled first Olive on page 1, and then Megan on page 127. The division of the book into two halves is for a stylistic change of perspective or vantage <b>point.</b> While <b>Olive</b> was crippled from a car crash, Megan is a gorgeous actress. One of the issues is whether beauty is only skin deep, and whether the intellect, taken separately and by itself, is or can {{be a source of}} attraction. Similarly, whether beautiful people can transmigrate to beautiful bodies if they are trapped in bodies unsuitable to them. Finally, there is the issueof whether car crashes can be induced psychically, or if they depend purely on chance.|$|R
50|$|She first {{appears as}} Stephen's girlfriend at {{boarding}} school, and is initially unaware about Stephen's relationship with Olive. A {{few weeks after}} Stephen's suspension, she returns home to see him, and discovers about Olive and Stephen's plan to run off to Paris. She leaves Stephen {{to think about what}} he wants from their relationship, and joins Olive at her school (her character profile on the website says that she had to leave the private school because her father lost his job as a hedge fund manager.) After going out with Stephen a few more times, she dumps him as she realises that he is only using her to make a <b>point</b> to <b>Olive.</b> She apologises to Olive about her part in Stephen's deception and they become friends. When Rosa realises Tommy's attraction to Olive, she encourages him to ask her out. It doesn't work and Olive decides to go out with Stephen instead. The night before the party, Rosa shares a spliff with Tommy and they kiss.|$|R
50|$|The {{smoke point}} of any oil {{is defined by}} the {{temperature}} at which light blue smoke rises from the surface. The smoke, which contains acrolein, is an eye irritant and asphixiant. The smoke point of oils vary widely. Depending on origin, refinement, age, and source growth conditions, the smoke point for any given type of oil can drop nearly 20 °C. For example, the smoke <b>point</b> of <b>olive</b> oil can vary from being suitable for high temperature frying to only safely used for stir frying. As a cooking oil is refined its smoke point increases. This is because many of the impurities found in natural oils aid in their breakdown. In general the lighter the oil, the higher its smoke point. It is important to choose the appropriate oil for each cooking technique and temperature as cooking oils degrade rapidly when heated about their smoke point. It is recommended that oils heated beyond their smoke point should not be consumed as the chemicals created are suspected carcinogens.|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 124 - 142) Since {{the time}} when Neolithic Man first developed the olive (Olea europaea) as a cultigen in the eastern Mediterranean region over 6000 years ago, the fruit has had a prolonged and significant influence on the pattern of man's habitation in both the Mediterranean world and in Spanish America. It has been hypothesized by many scholars that olive cultivation originated somewhere within the eastern Mediterranean region. From this <b>point,</b> <b>olive</b> cultivation diffused throughout the Mediterranean basin. It is suggested that the fruit was first introduced into Spain by the Phoenicians around 1000 B. C. From Spain, the practice of olive cultivation was transmitted to the New World by Spanish agriculturalists who sailed to the West Indies with Christopher Columbus [...] possibly as early as 1493. Olive cultivation then diffused within the New World, via the various Spanish settlements and missionary outposts, until it reached California shortly after 1769. Olive cultivation diffused {{to most of the}} California Franciscan missions by 1800, and subsequently spread to the present-day production areas in the inland valleys of the State, where there are currently over 40, 000 acres devoted to the cultivation of this crop. A study of the olive industry in the San Fernando Valley [...] which was taken to be representative of the impact that olive cultivation had on areas adjacent to mission sites [...] revealed that the industry was not as successful {{as it was in the}} interior regions of the State. The combined pressure of four main factors over a period of years served to create a situation that was not conducive to the success of the olive industry in the Valley: (1) a steady in-flow of people whose demand for residential housing, and the associated commercial and industrial development, caused a persistent encroachment of urban activities into the olive-growing district; (2) an increase in the valuation of orchard lands as the demand for new land for housing increased; (3) the non-availability of low-wage labor upon the termination of the Bracero Program in 1964; and (4) the fact that a scientific study revealed that climatic conditions in the Valley were never really conducive to quality olive production in the first place...|$|R
40|$|ScopeThe {{ability of}} {{different}} plant sterols/stanols (PS) mixtures, which differed {{in the degree}} of B-ring saturation and aliphatic side chain structure and saturation, to reduce cholesterol (CH) micellarization was explored. Methods and resultsExperiments were performed using an in vitro digestion model, synthetic mixed micelles, and pure porcine pancreatic lipases. Sterols were measured by GC-FID. The ability of PS to reduce CH micellarization was dependent on the form of PS and on the type of delivery matrix (low-fat yogurt or olive oil). Long-chain PS esters delivered in the yogurt matrix, and medium chain PS esters delivered in olive oil provided the greatest reduction in CH micellarization. In yogurt, the ability to impair CH micellarization was inversely related (rho = - 0. 41, p < 0. 0005) to PS melting <b>point.</b> In <b>olive</b> oil, the more hydrophobic PS mixtures, i. e. those rich in long-chain PS esters, had the lower ability to impair CH micellarization. ConclusionsDifferent forms of PS have a different ability to impair CH micellarization. This ability depends on the transfer efficiency of PS from the food matrix to the micelle, which in turn depends on the melting point and the hydrophobicity of PS and on the delivery food matrix...|$|R
50|$|Amatriciana {{originates}} from {{a recipe}} named gricia. Grici were what Romans—modern dwellers of Rome, not the ancient ones—called the sellers {{of bread and}} comestibles. They were so called in {{that a number of}} them emigrated from the Swiss canton of Grisons. According to another hypothesis, the name originates from the hamlet of Grisciano, in the comune of Accumoli, near Amatrice. The sauce was (and still is) prepared with guanciale (cured pork cheek) and grated pecorino. According to the matching hypothesis, ingredients reflect local products available either to a simple grocery store or to common folk who practiced herding in the mountainous area. At some <b>point,</b> a little <b>olive</b> oil was added to the recipe; also {{it should be noted that}} in the 1960s the Amatriciana sauce was still prepared in this way in Amatrice itself.|$|R
50|$|In 1888 the Sheffield Football Association {{agreed to}} give a {{testimonial}} to Sheffield Wednesday's Billy Mosforth, versus Preston North End. The meeting of both clubs in the FA Cup meant that the match was postponed until February, by which <b>point</b> the <b>Olive</b> Grove was snow covered and the match was switched to Bramall Lane. Arthur volunteered for the 'Sheffield Wednesday and District' team but despite both clubs being locked into a draw {{in the first half}} Preston ran away with the match, winning 8-1. It was reported that Wednesday’s heavy loss was “in great measure owing to the wretched performance of Wharton, who utterly failed to uphold his high reputation as a goalkeeper” and that he “could not have stopped the ball had it been half as big as a balloon”. It was reported that at times the Wednesday fans ironically applauded every kick Arthur took and one fan angrily asked the Preston team where they had “brought him from” as it was well known that Arthur was an ex Preston player. There were even fears that Arthur would be the victim of violence as he left the field. Arthur did have a connection to Sheffield Wednesday, through his trainer in Sheffield 'Billy' South, who amongst other noted Sheffield sporting icons of the day also trained Wednesday's Tommy Crawshaw.|$|R
40|$|A survey {{among the}} olive oil {{producers}} was conducted {{in order to assess}} the situation of {{the olive oil}} chain and identify the actual strength or weak <b>points</b> of the <b>olive</b> oil chain in Basilicata. The survey indicated that the olive growing is fundamentally characterized by a very fragmented supply, with a resultant low market penetration and a limited market power of the single producers. Oil production is still oriented to self consumption, and the oil production system is characterized by a low technology level, even if the mills are going through a slow but progressive technological update. Marketing opportunities are limited, also due to the small quantities of olive oil that the single producer can offer on the market, but there is the trend to move towards the use of marketing tools, such as PDO certification, that may valorize the typicality {{and the quality of the}} product...|$|R
40|$|A large {{increase}} {{in demand for}} high-quality virgin olive oil {{during the past few}} years can be attributed not only to its potential health benefits, but also to its particular organoleptic properties. The aim of increasing the quality standards for virgin olive oil is continuously stimulating the search for new technologies. All operations carried out during the oil extraction process aim to obtain the highest quality of oil from fruits. Malaxation is one of the most important critical <b>points</b> of the <b>olive</b> oil mechanical extraction process. The employment of wrong mixing conditions (time, temperature and atmosphere) compromise the healthy and organoleptic properties of the product. A new malaxer was projected and tested to improve thermal exchange reducing the malaxation time and enhancing the virgin olive oil quality. The experimental data showed that resistance to oxidation, total phenols and pleasant volatile compounds were higher in the extracted olive oils employing the innovative malaxer than in the extracted oils utilizing the traditional one...|$|R
40|$|International audienceOlive oil {{is a major}} {{economic}} resource of the Mediterranean region. Olive crop management can be improved by models that forecast the variable reproductive biology of olive tree. However, the processes controlling olive harvest are complex on large scales. Here, we study the parameters that influence olive fruit production for developing accurate forecasting models. Seventeen aerobiological sampling <b>points</b> have monitored <b>olive</b> pollen grains in Spain, Italy and Tunisia from 1993 to 2012. Six crop models have been developed at two provinces and country scales. The modelling {{has been done in}} two steps: (1) typification and (2) modelling by partial least square regression. Results show that higher pollen indexes and water availability during spring are related to an increase of final fruit production in all the studied area. Higher pollen indexes are also positively correlated with air temperature during early spring and autumn. Furthermore, a decrease of fruit production is related with increasing air temperature during winter and summer. To conclude, we have designed accurate models that allow accurate predictions of olive production...|$|R
40|$|In {{semi-arid}} regions {{crop yields}} are primarily water-limited. As reported by many authors, water supply can improve olive yield, while, {{on the other}} hand, the influence of soil water availability on olive oil quality it is not well understood. This {{study was conducted to}} determine whether soil water availability could have an effect on yield and some quality parameters of extra virgin olive oil. Trials were carried out over a three years period in an olive orchard (cv. Coratina) planted in 1992 at distances of 6 x 3 m and located in Southern Italy (Basilicata region). Yield, fruit characteristics and oil quality parameters (FFA, total phenols, alpha-tocopherol content, peroxide value, K 232, K 270) for rainfed plants were compared with those observed for irrigated trees, taking into account only the on years (6 th and 8 th year after planting). In the irrigated treatment seasonal water supply ranged from 128 to 203 mm, according to the climatic variables (rainfall and crop evapotranspiration). Soil water potential in the non-irrigated plot was never above the permanent wilting <b>point</b> for <b>olive</b> tree (- 2, 5 MPa). Olive yield was statistically different in the 6 th year after planting between treatments (irrigated and non-irrigated) while, in the 8 th year, no difference was observed, probably because of a sort of recovering by the rainfed plants after the non-bearing year (7 th year after planting). For the productions obtained in the 8 th year after planting, soil water availability did not seem to affect fruit dry weight and oil quality parameters, while slight different results could be observed for the productions of the 6 th year after planting. However, this latter result could be attributed to the different plant crop load and fruit ripening pattern...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Floral phenology, as most {{of natural}} phenomena, shows, as an {{inherent}} feature, {{a high degree of}} spatial continuity. Geostatistics are a family of statistics that describe correlations through space/ time and they can be used for both quantifying spatial correlation and interpolating no monitored sampling points. The combined use of Geographical Informa-tion Systems (GIS) and geostatistics can be an essential tool for spatial analysis in phenological and aerobiological studies. In the present work, Kriging interpolation by using linear geostatistic analysis has allow us to estimate phenological data of a wide olive crop area of the province of Cordoba (Andalusia, Southern Spain), {{on the basis of a}} limited number of phenology sampling points. The main a priori hypothesis was that 7 traditionally observed sampling <b>points</b> (with 10 <b>olive</b> trees in each site) uniformly distributed through the main olive crop areas could be enough for interpolating phenological information of the whole Cordoba olive area. Geostatistical results reject this hypothesis. The optimum/minimum number and location of sampling points was deter-mined in 13 sites (including the original 7 sites and 6 new sites). The obtained phenological maps will improve olive pollen aerobiological information and forecasting in the area. The application of such new combined space analysis tools on floral phenology allows optimising human and economic resources on field phenology campaigns. Moreover, an appropriate use of GIS and geostatistic software to create phe-nological maps will be an essential complement in pollen aerobiological studies, given the increased interest in obtaining automatic aerobiological fore-casting maps...|$|R
5000|$|Francis Kelsey’s life {{started in}} Ogden, New York, a city located in Monroe County, New York on May 23, 1858. Kelsey {{was the fourth}} child of Henry Kelsey and Olive Trowbridge Kelsey and was named after his {{grandmother}} on his mother's side. Francis' father, Henry, originally {{wanted to go into}} the medical field. This goal would consume at least ten years of his life, to pay for his medical training he not only was a school teacher but would travel at night to teach singing lessons. Quite unfortunately, he would learn at age 28, when he had enough funds to join a doctor's office as a student, that, ironically, his lack of knowledge of Greek and Latin would make his studies even longer. [...] Greek and Latin were still very important in the medical field at this time, Henry was discouraged and to his medical career and instead bought a farm near his parents home in Stony <b>Point.</b> He married <b>Olive</b> Cornelia Trowbridge in 1842, sister to antislavery writer and friend of Mark Twain, John Townsend Trowbridge.The Kelseys would stay at the farm in Stony Point until Francis was two years old and then moved to larger farm at Churchville. [...] There was a school in town that Francis attended but to go to secondary school he would have to travel to the Lockport Union School, about sixty miles away. He enrolled when he was 15 and sources think because the school was so far from home he was most likely a boarder. After attending Lockport, he went to the University of Rochester where he followed the Classical Course and won numerous awards including a sophomore prize in Latin and a junior prize in Greek. While {{there is no doubt that}} Kelsey was very studious, that did not mean his time at university was constantly spent in the library. From time to time he enjoyed a practical joke, he ended up creating a chemistry lab in his boarding house at one point, making stink bombs to ward off the occasional, unwelcome guest. He graduated in 1880 being elected valedictorian.|$|R
