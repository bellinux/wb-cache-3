5|$|Each of {{the core}} {{economic}} functions, consumption, production, and investment, have become highly globalized in recent decades. While consumers increasingly import foreign goods or purchase domestic goods produced with foreign inputs, businesses continue to expand production internationally to meet an increasingly globalized consumption in the world economy. International financial integration among nations has afforded investors the opportunity to diversify their asset portfolios by investing abroad. Consumers, multinational corporations, individual and institutional investors, and financial intermediaries (such as banks) are the key economic actors within the global financial system. Central banks (such as the European Central Bank or the U.S. Federal Reserve System) undertake open market operations {{in their efforts to}} realize monetary <b>policy</b> <b>goals.</b> International financial institutions such as the Bretton Woods institutions, multilateral development banks and other development finance institutions provide emergency financing to countries in crisis, provide risk mitigation tools to prospective foreign investors, and assemble capital for development finance and poverty reduction initiatives. Trade organizations such as the World Trade Organization, Institute of International Finance, and the World Federation of Exchanges attempt to ease trade, facilitate trade disputes and address economic affairs, promote standards, and sponsor research and statistics publications.|$|E
5|$|Nixon was a late {{convert to}} the {{conservation}} movement. Environmental policy {{had not been}} a significant issue in the 1968 election; the candidates were rarely asked for their views on the subject. He saw that the first Earth Day in April 1970 presaged a wave of voter interest on the subject, and sought to use that to his benefit; in June he announced the formation of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Nixon broke new ground by discussing environment policy in his State of the Union speech; other initiatives supported by Nixon included the Clean Air Act of 1970 and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA); the National Environmental Policy Act required environmental impact statements for many Federal projects. Nixon vetoed the Clean Water Act of 1972—objecting not to the <b>policy</b> <b>goals</b> of the legislation but to the amount of money to be spent on them, which he deemed excessive. After Congress overrode his veto, Nixon impounded the funds he deemed unjustifiable.|$|E
25|$|Some criteria, such as {{economic}} benefit, {{will be more}} easily measurable or definable, while others such as environmental quality will be harder to measure or express quantitatively. Ultimately though, the set of decision criteria needs to embody all of the <b>policy</b> <b>goals,</b> and overemphasising the more easily definable or measurable criteria, will have the undesirable impact of biasing the analysis towards {{a subset of the}} <b>policy</b> <b>goals.</b>|$|E
40|$|The Republic of Korea vaulted in {{less than}} three generations from being one of the poorest {{countries}} in the world to becoming a member of the OECD. This economic transformation has attracted considerable admiration and inquiry. One of the key factors for Korea’s success was the provision of skills to support industrialization and economic diversification. This report takes advantage of a new World Bank diagnostic tool to examine the development of the Korean system for WfD from 1970 to 2010. The findings are intended to document good practices, lapses and key breakthroughs and generate insights {{that can be used to}} enrich dialogue on WfD policy in the World Bank’s partner countries.

General insecurity along borders in the north, including cross-border banditry and terrorism, remain troubling issues in regional relations.|$|E
25|$|While his {{domestic}} aims represented continuity with past Democratic policies, {{successful completion of}} Polk's foreign <b>policy</b> <b>goals</b> would represent the first major American territorial gains since the Adams–Onís Treaty of 1819. Pledged to serve only one term, Polk accomplished his four major objectives in just four years. By linking acquisition of new lands in Oregon (with no slavery) and Texas (with slavery), he hoped to satisfy both North and South.|$|E

25|$|Once policy {{alternatives}} {{have been}} evaluated, {{the next step}} is to decide which policy alternative should be implemented. This is shown as step 5 in Figure 1. At one extreme, comparing the policy alternatives can be relatively simple if all the <b>policy</b> <b>goals</b> can be measured using a single metric and given equal weighting. In this case, the decision method is an exercise in benefit cost analysis (BCA).|$|E
25|$|The EU {{is based}} on a series of treaties. These first {{established}} the European Community and the EU, and then made amendments to those founding treaties. These are power-giving treaties which set broad <b>policy</b> <b>goals</b> and establish institutions with the necessary legal powers to implement those goals. These legal powers include the ability to enact legislation which can directly affect all member states and their inhabitants. The EU has legal personality, with the right to sign agreements and international treaties.|$|E
25|$|The main {{challenger}} to {{the ruling}} Sąjūdis nationalist movement, which had controlled the Supreme Council since February 1990 and spearheaded the move to independence, was the Democratic Labour Party of Lithuania (LDDP). In {{the run-up to the}} elections, Sąjūdis portrayed the opposing political groups as communist and reactionary, opposed to independence and democracy. The LDDP declared their commitment to maintaining foreign <b>policy</b> <b>goals,</b> including joining Council of Europe and agreements with other international organizations, while also promising friendlier relations and better trade with Russia.|$|E

25|$|Many OECD {{countries}} have implemented reforms to achieve <b>policy</b> <b>goals</b> of ensuring {{access to health}} care, {{improving the quality of}} health care and health outcomes, allocating an appropriate level of public sector other resources to healthcare {{but at the same time}} ensuring that services are provided in a cost-efficient and cost-effective manner (microeconomic efficiency). A range of measures, such as better payment methods, have improved the microeconomic incentives facing providers. However, introducing improved incentives through a more competitive environment among providers and insurers has proved difficult.|$|E
25|$|Back in Chicago, Merriam coordinated {{and edited}} {{a series of}} {{comparative}} studies by political scientists {{on the use of}} expertise in policy making, civic education, and public opinion. Merriam's contribution to the series, The Making of Citizens (1934), was highly laudatory of Soviet Russia, Nazi Germany, and Fascist Italy's use of these tools to strengthen the sense of national purpose and achieve <b>policy</b> <b>goals.</b> Merriam was highly critical of these regimes, though, and felt that a more scientific approach would avoid the messianism on which these governments relied and strengthen democratic and pluralistic norms.|$|E
25|$|In November 2001, Toledo opened talks which {{concluded}} in the National Accord of July 22, 2002. In the accord, seven {{political parties and}} seven social organizations agreed upon a framework that would guide policy for the next twenty years. The accord set forth twenty-four <b>policy</b> <b>goals</b> divided into four categories: democracy {{and the rule of}} law, equity and social justice, economic competitiveness, and an institutional framework of efficiency, transparency, and decentralization. Initially, the accord opened up dialogue in Peru’s political arena, but within a year, the public considered it to be less effective than had been hoped.|$|E

It examines pertinent definitional issues and explores the main rationales {{for the promotion of}} media literacy as a regulatory and <b>policy</b> <b>goal,</b> paying particular attention to the specific interests of selected target groups and stake-holders. It then considers the extent to which those definitions, rationales and interests are reflected in relevant regulatory and policy instruments adopted by the European Union and the Council of Europe. The article concludes with a tentative prognosis for the future promotion of media literacy as a regulatory and <b>policy</b> <b>goal</b> for the European audiovisual sector...|$|R
40|$|Since {{the stock}} market boom of the 1990 s, many have {{suggested}} the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has adopted an unannounced <b>policy</b> <b>goal</b> of supporting equity values. This paper offers {{a new approach to}} disentangle the relationship between changes in equity values and monetary policy. Specifically, the paper distinguishes the FOMC's reaction to forecasts of traditional goal variables, which may depend on equity prices, from the FOMC's independent reaction to changes in equity prices. By using actual forward-looking variables examined by the FOMC before each action (the "Greenbook" forecasts), the authors find little evidence to support the proposition that the FOMC responds to stock values, except as filtered through a forecast of accepted monetary <b>policy</b> <b>goal</b> variables. ...|$|R

25|$|The {{conclusion}} that Khrushchev drew from the Suez crisis, which {{he saw as}} his own personal triumph, was {{that the use of}} nuclear blackmail was a very effective tool for achieving Soviet foreign <b>policy</b> <b>goals.</b> Therefore, a long period of crises began, starting with the Berlin crisis of 1958 and culminating in the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962. Equally important in explaining the Soviet diplomatic triumph in the Near East was Nasser's reaction to the Eisenhower Doctrine. Nasser never wanted Egypt to be aligned with one superpower, and instead preferred a situation where he was the object of rival American and Soviet efforts to buy his friendship.|$|E
25|$|The {{result was}} a ten-year capital plan which had been crafted by the government. It {{bypassed}} leasing a fast ferry for trials in BC waters and went directly to implementation. Several other projects previously considered essential, such as replacing one of the northern ferries, were deferred in favour of the fast ferries. In addition, {{the construction of the}} fast ferries would be used to revitalise the province's shipbuilding industry, furthering <b>policy</b> <b>goals</b> beyond merely improving ferry service to Nanaimo. The BC Ferries board, which was required to rubberstamp the plan, noted several concerns about the fast ferry aspect when asking the cabinet to give it final approval.|$|E
25|$|Science {{policy is}} an area of public policy {{concerned}} with the policies that affect the conduct of the scientific enterprise, including research funding, often in pursuance of other national <b>policy</b> <b>goals</b> such as technological innovation to promote commercial product development, weapons development, health care and environmental monitoring. Science policy also refers to the act of applying scientific knowledge and consensus to the development of public policies. Science policy thus deals with the entire domain of issues that involve the natural sciences. In accordance with public policy being concerned about the well-being of its citizens, science policy's goal is to consider how science and technology can best serve the public.|$|E

25|$|Buddhism, {{furthermore}} {{played a}} role in Mongolia's foreign policy by linking Mongolia with the communist and the noncommunist states of East and Southeast Asia. Ulaanbaatar was the headquarters of the Asian Buddhist Conference for Peace, which has held conferences for Buddhists from such countries as Japan, Vietnam, Cambodia, Sri Lanka, and Bhutan; published a journal for international circulation; and maintained contacts with such groups as the Christian Peace Conference, the Soviet Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee and the Russian Orthodox Church. It sponsored the visits of the Dalai Lama to Mongolia in 1979 and 1982. The organization, headed by the abbot of then-Gandan Monastery, advanced the foreign <b>policy</b> <b>goals</b> of the Mongolian government, which were in accord with those of the Soviet Union.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{political}} {{leader of the}} state was Josip Broz Tito, but there were several other important politicians, particularly after Tito's death: see the list of leaders of communist Yugoslavia. In 1974, Tito was proclaimed President-for-life of Yugoslavia. After Tito's death in 1980, the single position of president was divided into a collective Presidency, where representatives of each republic would essentially form a committee where the concerns of each republic would be addressed and from it, collective federal <b>policy</b> <b>goals</b> and objectives would be implemented. The head of the collective presidency was rotated between representatives of the different republics. The head of the collective presidency was considered {{the head of state}} of Yugoslavia. The collective presidency was ended in 1991, as Yugoslavia fell apart.|$|E
25|$|A staunch anti-communist, Woll {{eventually}} became a confidant of AFL president Samuel Gompers and other like-minded labor leaders such as William Green of the United Mine Workers of America. Green in particular relied heavily on Woll for advice and policy guidance during his term {{as president of the}} AFL. Woll also became a mentor to Jay Lovestone, the one-time Communist who was expelled from the party only to become a rabid Red-baiter and AFL-CIO foreign policy advisor. In 1944, the AFL-CIO established the Free Trade Union Committee (FTUC) to assist free trade unions abroad, particularly in Europe. Lovestone was named its secretary, reporting (in part) to Woll. Lovestone's mission was to eliminate pro-Communist unions and supplant them with unions which supported capitalism. The Central Intelligence Agency funneled millions of dollars through FTUC in support of American foreign <b>policy</b> <b>goals.</b>|$|E
