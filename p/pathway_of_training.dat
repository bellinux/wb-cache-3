40|$|This article {{describes}} the history and the prevailing orientations of group psychotherapy in Italy (psychoanalytically oriented, psychodrama, CBT groups) and particularly group analysis. Provided free of charge by the Italian health system, group psychotherapy is growing, but its expansion is patchy. The main <b>pathways</b> <b>of</b> Italian <b>training</b> in the different group psychotherapy orientations are also presented. Clinical-theoretical elaboration on self development, psychopathology related to group experiences, and the methodological attention paid to objectives and methods in different clinical groups are issues related to group therapy in Italy. Difficulties {{in the relationship between}} research and clinical practice are discussed, as well as the empirical research network that tries {{to bridge the gap between}} research and clinical work in group psychotherapy. The economic crisis in Italy has led to massive cuts in health care and to an increasing demand for some forms of psychological treatment. For these reasons, and because of its positive cost-benefit ratio, group psychotherapy is now considered an important tool in the national health care system to expand the clinical response to different forms of psychological distress...|$|R
40|$|For decades, {{glycogen}} {{has been}} recognized as a storage form of glucose within the liver and muscles. Only recently has a greater role for glycogen as a regulator of metabolic signalling been suggested. Glycogen {{either directly or indirectly}} regulates a number of signalling proteins, including the adenosine- 52 ̆ 7 -phosphate- (AMP-) activated protein kinase (AMPK) and p 38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). AMPK and p 38 MAPK {{play a significant role in}} controlling the expression and activity of the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ coactivators (PGCs), respectively. The PGCs can directly increase muscle mitochondrial mass and endurance exercise performance. As low muscle glycogen is generally associated with greater activation <b>of</b> these <b>pathways,</b> the concept <b>of</b> <b>training</b> with low glycogen to maximize the physiological adaptations to endurance exercise is gaining acceptance in the scientific community. In this review, we evaluate the scientific basis for this philosophy and propose some practical applications of this philosophy for the general population as well as elite endurance athletes. <br /...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Genome-wide {{association}} {{studies are}} useful for discovering genotype–phenotype associations but are limited because they require large cohorts to identify a signal, which can be population-specific. Mapping genetic variation to genes improves power and allows the effects of both protein-coding variation as well as variation in expression to be combined into “gene level” effects. Methods Previous work has shown that warfarin dose can be predicted using information from genetic variation that affects protein-coding regions. Here, we introduce a method that improves dose prediction by integrating tissue-specific gene expression. In particular, we use drug pathways and expression quantitative trait loci knowledge to impute gene expression—on the assumption that differential expression <b>of</b> key <b>pathway</b> genes may impact dose requirement. We focus on 116 genes from the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic <b>pathways</b> <b>of</b> warfarin within <b>training</b> and validation sets comprising both European and African-descent individuals. Results We build gene-tissue signatures associated with warfarin dose in a cohort-specific manner and identify a signature of 11 gene-tissue pairs that significantly augments the International Warfarin Pharmacogenetics Consortium dosage-prediction algorithm in both populations. Conclusions Our results demonstrate that imputed expression can improve dose prediction and bridge population-specific compositions. MATLAB code is available at [URL]...|$|R
40|$|Education, {{training}} and employment {{have been identified}} in the last decade as a key priority for improving Indigenous outcomes. A huge gap exists in the relationships between the social determinants of health and the health outcomes experienced by Indigenous Australians. If we are to close the gap on these inequalities, and improve health and wellbeing, key strategies must include more Indigenous representation in social and emotional wellbeing training. As the second paper in a three-part series, this paper describes the opportunities and challenges associated with the process of gaining personal empowerment and training to better help Indigenous communities. After I took the difficult first step of deciding to commit to the <b>pathway</b> <b>of</b> education <b>training</b> and a better job, I trained as a Family Wellbeing (FWB) facilitator and I am now involved in passing on these skills to others. The Aboriginal-developed Family Wellbeing Program works toward improving self-esteem and confidence of participants. Taking control and responsibility of one's own health and wellbeing is a necessary precursor to taking responsibility in education and training. Additionally, control is a determinant for improved benefits, such as having more representation in education, {{training and}} employment for Indigenous people. This paper is based on reflections written during Family Wellbeing training and facilitation processes and draws upon data collected between 2007 and 2010. I used thematic analysis to code the reflections and evaluation feedback. I reviewed the resulting themes and created a mind map to see how the themes related to each other. This paper describes the cyclical process of my getting help and giving help to improve Indigenous education, training and wellbeing outcomes...|$|R

40|$|Accepted for {{publication}} 3 July 2016. Objective: Despite increases in Commonwealth funded general practice (GP) Registrar training positions, workforce trends continue to show geographical maldistribution. This study aimed to identify Registrar attributes which describe a cohort choosing {{to work in}} rural practice. Design: Cross-sectional self-report questionnaire for socio-demographics, prior training, current <b>training</b> <b>pathway,</b> measures <b>of</b> personality and resilience. Participants and Setting: GP Registrars (N = 452) training in either the general or rural <b>pathways</b> <b>of</b> three Registered <b>Training</b> Providers in three states, or training through the Australian College of Rural and Remote Medicine’s independent pathway. Main outcome measure: Ordinal logistic regression tested the impact of key variables on the likelihood that Registrars would settle in rural practice. Univariate analysis explored differences between groups and effects of variables. Results: A significantly increased interest in rural practice was to found to exist among registrars who were male, identified themselves as being rural, had a partner who identified as being rural, were enrolled in a rural training pathway and had high levels of Cooperativeness. Conclusion: We present a discriminating model combining socio-demographics, prior training and personality variables which challenges Australia to rethink Registrar attributes when training for rural general practice. With significant changes about to occur to GP training in Australia, this paper highlights {{the need for a}} more holistic approach which considers personal attributes such as Cooperativeness, rural identity and provision of geographically focused rural training pipelines to encourage Registrars to bond to individual rural communities and further develop their personal connectedness to country life and rural medical practice.

A secondary purpose was to explore the potential mediators <b>of</b> <b>training</b> effects on executive function and functional mobility with particular reference to physical fitness gains. Methods: A sample of 42 healthy community dwelling adults aged 65 to 75 years participated twice weekly for 3 months in either: (1) multicomponent training, prioritizing neuromuscular coordination, balance, agility, and cognitive executive control; or (2) progressive resistance training for strength conditioning. Participants were tested at baseline (T 1), following a 4 -week control period (T 2), and finally at postintervention (T 3) for executive function (inhibition and cognitive flexibility) and functional mobility (maximal walking speed with and without additional task requirements). Cardiorespiratory and muscular fitness were also assessed as potential mediators. Results: Indices of inhibition, the functions involved in the deliberate withholding of prepotent or automatic responses, and measures of functional mobility improved after the intervention, independent <b>of</b> <b>training</b> type. Mediation analysis suggested that different mechanisms underlie the effects of multicomponent and progressive resistance training. While multicomponent training seemed to directly affect inhibitory capacity, resistance training seemed to affect it indirectly through gains in muscular strength. Physical fitness and executive function variables did not mediate functional mobility changes. Conclusion: These results confirm that physical training benefits executive function and suggest that different training types might lead to such benefits through different <b>pathways.</b> Both types <b>of</b> <b>training</b> also promoted functional mobility in older adulthood; however, neither inhibitory capacity, nor muscular strength gains seemed to explain functional mobility outcomes.

40|$|Short-term {{habituation}} (STH) is {{the decrease}} in behavioral responding observed during repeated stimulation at regular intervals. For siphon-elicited siphon withdrawal in Aplysia (S-SWR), we previously showed that the amplitude of responses measured in LFS-type siphon motor neurons (LFS MNs) during training {{is dependent on the}} stimulus interval used and is training-site specific. The major source of excitation from siphon stimulation onto the LFS MNs comes from the L 29 interneurons. Here we examined the role of the L 29 s in STH by addressing two questions: 1. What are the relative contributions of intrinsic regulation of excitability and network inhibition on L 29 activity during STH training? By activating L 29 s with intracellular current injection, we found that intrinsic changes in excitability occur, but only at short training intervals (1 sec). We also demonstrated that network inhibition is not required for regulating L 29 responses during training, indicating that any expression of inhibition is redundant to the excitability changes. 2. How does L 29 synaptic plasticity contribute to the maintenance <b>of</b> <b>training</b> site-specificity exhibited in LFS MNs? When training stimuli are delivered 1 sec apart (1 sec ISI), L 29 responses decrease in both stimulated (trained) and un-stimulated (untrained) <b>pathways,</b> yet site-specificity <b>of</b> <b>training</b> is maintained in the LFS MNs. Our results suggest that activity-dependent synaptic facilitation (augmentation; AUG) expressed by the L 29 s acts to compensate for the decreased activity in the untrained pathway. First, we demonstrated that the L 29 -LFS synapse exhibits significant AUG with L 29 activation at a 1 sec ISI. Second, we showed that the induction of AUG prevents the reduction in siphon-evoked LFS responses that is otherwise observed with decreased L 29 activity. Collectively, our results support a role for the L 29 s in regulating network dynamics during STH training, but only at rapid (1 sec ISI) training intervals...|$|R
