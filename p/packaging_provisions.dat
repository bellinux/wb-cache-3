40|$|Part {{of efforts}} to have Ireland tobacco free by 2025 Minister for Health, Simon Harris and Minister of State, Marcella Corcoran Kennedy today {{announced}} that the legislation for the standardised packaging of tobacco is to come into force in September 2017. This follows {{the signing of the}} commencement order today by Minister Corcoran Kennedy for the standardised <b>packaging</b> <b>provisions</b> of the Public Health (Standardised Packaging of Tobacco) Act 2015. The aim of standardised packaging is to make all tobacco packs look less attractive to consumers, to make health warnings more prominent and to prevent packaging from misleading consumers about the harmful effects of tobacco. The signing of this order means that all tobacco products manufactured for sale in Ireland from 30 th September 2017 must be in standardised retail packaging. There will be a wash through period allowed, meaning any products manufactured and placed on the market before the September date will be permitted to stay on the market for a 12 month period (i. e. until 30 th September, 2018). Standardised packaging means that: •	all forms of branding – trademarks, logos, colours and graphics – are to be removed from tobacco packs, •	The brand and variant names would be presented in a uniform typeface for all brands and •	the packs would all be in one plain neutral colour Minister Harris said “Smoking is a significant cause of ill-health in Ireland. Almost 6, 000 people die from tobacco related disease and tobacco use. That is 6, 000 families who go through the pain of losing a loved one when the stark reality is that these deaths are unnecessary and avoidable. It has been estimated to cost Irish society a total of € 10. 7 billion annually in healthcare, productivity and other costs. The Government is committed to changing that and standardised packaging of tobacco products is one such evidence-based measure that will assist in achieving our overarching goal of having Ireland tobacco free by 2025 ″. Minister Corcoran Kennedy said “The tobacco pack is the last advertising medium for the tobacco industry in Ireland and so is a critically important form of promotion. Standardised packaging is the next step in tackling the promotion and advertising of tobacco. There is strong evidence emerging from Australia, that introducing standardised packaging is both effective and proportionate in reducing the toll of tobacco use on the population. Research has shown that younger people are more influenced by brands. Ireland has the lowest age of children starting to smoke among all the EU Member States and almost 80...|$|E

In particular, while local policy preferences appear to shape the extent of direct payments growth, the results also demonstrate that understanding levels of activity requires attention to local circumstances.

With the introduction of new, effective, but more expensive antimalarials, there is concern that the high levels of efficacy observed in clinical trials may not be translated into effectiveness in the normal context of use. We reviewed available published evidence on adherence to antimalarial drugs and community drug usage; 24 studies were identified of which nine were 'intervention' studies, seven were classified as 'outcome studies', and the remainder were purely descriptive studies of antimalarial adherence. Definitions, methods, and results varied widely. Adherence was generally better when treatments were effective, and was improved by interventions focusing on provider knowledge and behaviour, <b>packaging,</b> and <b>provision</b> of correct dosages. There is insufficient information on this important subject, and current data certainly do not justify extrapolation from results with ineffective drugs to new effective treatments.

40|$|The paper {{reports on}} a small {{research}} project conducted in the South of England and funded by Mencap City Foundation. The study {{is concerned with the}} processes through which young children with learning difficulties come to be experiencing a combination of special and mainstream preschool provision. We have (i) explored ways of identifying parents who have "opted" for a combination of special and mainstream services for their child in the early years; (ii) sought {{to gain a better understanding}} of how parents conceptualise the choices available to them and their choice making process; and (iii) tried to elicit what parents expect from the combined provision and how they feel about it. In addition to questionnaires and follow-up interviews with parents, we sent similar questionnaires to providers (special schools, nurseries, early excellence centres, Sure Start centres etc) and to voluntary groups (local and national, disability-focused and parent-focused). This enabled us to gain the perspectives of those providing services and support as well as providing routes to accessing parents. We found that behind the New Labour rhetoric of the importance of placing children at the centre of individually created <b>packages</b> of <b>provision,</b> and parents at the centre of decision-making, there were complex stories of mixed messages, local diversity and constrained option...|$|R
30|$|The {{search for}} {{balancing}} the bargaining power of farmers {{has led to}} specific legal solutions within the sector. Experience varied between countries although a common feature is derogations to competition policy (Nash et al. 1996; Del Cont et al. 2012, Carrau, 2012; Andries and Garcia Azcarate 2015). Moreover, in Europe the move from price to income support within the Common Agriculture Policy (CAP) has increased farmers’ market exposure (Tothova Velazquez 2012; European Commission 2010).

40|$|Objectives To compare two post-abortion family {{planning}} (FP) service packages on contraceptive use and repeat abortion rate among {{young women in}} three cities in China. Methods In this cluster-randomized trial, one FP service <b>package</b> included <b>provision</b> of limited information and referral to existing FP services, and the other, more comprehensive, package consisted-in addition to the above simple package-of individual counselling, free provision of contraceptive materials, and involvement of the male partner. Eight matched pairs of hospitals were certified by centralized randomization. Women undergoing abortion were followed up for six months, and data were collected in two rounds, {{before and after the}} intervention. Results We followed a total of 2336 women younger than 25 years (555 before and 555 after the simple intervention package; 634 before and 592 after the comprehensive intervention package). Both packages increased use of any contraceptive method, but the comprehensive approach also increased use of more effective methods. Odds ratios for consistent and correct use of condoms were 2. 32 (95 % confidence interval 1. 55 - 3. 46) and 2. 78 (1. 81 - 4. 26), respectively, compared with the simple package. The rates of unwanted pregnancies and repeat abortions were somewhat reduced for both packages, with no significant statistical difference between them. Conclusion Couples who received the comprehensive post-abortion FP service appear to use more effective contraceptive methods and show better compliance...|$|R
40|$|It is not {{uncommon}} for young children in England identified with special educational needs to attend both mainstream/inclusive and special early childhood settings. Amid the national policy context of placing children at the centre of individually created <b>packages</b> of <b>provision</b> and parents at the centre of decision-making and a reality of a multi-track system of mainstream and special services, parents can negotiate such combined <b>packages</b> of <b>provision</b> in (Nind, Flewitt & Johnston, 2005). We reported at the 2005 BERA Conference on a small-scale questionnaire and interview study of how parents had arrived at the decision to combine both special and mainstream preschool settings, their expectations of this combination, and their experiences. An emerging theme from that data was that parents believed this combination offered 'the best of both worlds' for their children – which they felt neither inclusive nor special settings alone could provide. The 2007 follow-up study, part of which is reported here, considers the experiences of three children with learning difficulties attending special and mainstream early years settings, with a particular focus on {{the ways in which they}} make meaning in these environments and at home. The study adopts an ethnographic case study approach, including visual methods of data collection. Video observations capture the multi-sensory, multimodal dynamism of children’s meaning-making, and semi-structured and informal interviews with staff and parents reveal different constructions of particular events, children and needs. Data were collected on each child for a period of one week near the start of the Spring term 2007, and will be collected for a second week during the Summer term. Computer Aided Qualitative Data Analysis Software is being used to enhance the systematic, rigorous analysis of the complex qualitative data. Adopting a social model of disability, the study is not concerned with deficits within children or within environments, but with how children act on and within the diverse social environments that may facilitate or hinder their active participation as members and learners. The approach treats the children as active meaning-makers in socio-historically situated dynamic contexts. A rich complicating contextual factor in the project is how the settings attended by the children are variously placed on a segregation-integration continuum. The study is revealing that the settings are often in complex transition as they attempt to provide for all needs within the context of current political drivers to move swiftly towards more fully inclusive provision. The findings therefore also offer a timely snapshot of a system of provision in a state of change. The detailed, empirical evidence on how individual children respond to the varied communicative environments of home and the different settings is important for the evaluation of local and national policy and for parents facing decisions about whether or not to combine settings. Ultimately, we hope that the study findings will help to illuminate the ways in which the macro processes embodied in the organizational structures and practices of different settings impact upon the micro processes of children’s everyday learning. This conference paper focuses one of four research questions addressed in the study: How are the children constructed in the different environments of home and two early years settings on the special-inclusive continuum. ...|$|R
40|$|Current {{debates on}} the welfare state entail two {{intertwined}} questions. First, does a nation have sufficient active labor force participation to maintain the benefits for non-participants? Second, do social provisions exacerbate or attenuate class, ethnic and other distinctions within society? As predominantly structural or institutional debates, these discussions tend to exclude the impact social provisions have on facilitating individual agency among members of social groups. Yet the institutions of state, market and family interact to shape a gender order which specifies the types of social or civil claims {{that can be made}} by individuals. The gender order yields the societal boundaries within which agency can be exercised. This paper will present comparative evidence of how the <b>package</b> of social <b>provisions</b> in combination with market factors manifests in women's agency regarding family choices in eight countries. This, in turn, provides material evidence of whether the institutionally-framed gender order encourages gender difference or equity in terms of paid and unpaid work. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{the last}} 30 years, {{health care in}} the Netherlands has seen a large number of mergers of general hospitals. These mergers were not {{isolated}} incidents, but came about at a time when a great number of developments were taking place within health care. Examples of these changes include alterations to systems, the increased involvement of patients, the role of specialists in hospitals, technological developments and the role of insurers. If the part played by government up until the 1970 s was in the main distant and facilitating, then {{from the middle of the}} decade government influence increased in terms of legislation and cost management. At the end of the 1980 s, when it appeared that despite all the interventions made the cost of health care was still not properly under control, the government decided to set itself a new course. The plans emphasised an increase in market operations. First the Dekker Commission, then the Dunning Commission and finally the Biesheuvel Commission all proceeded to develop plans for market operations and funding, the <b>package</b> of <b>provisions</b> and the position of, and collaborative working relationship within, general health care. One decade later, it can be seen that only one part of all the proposed changes has actually been implemented. Regional experiments are indeed being carried out, aimed at both finding ways to defray costs for health care and the working relationship between the various parties; for each hospital there is one budget in which all costs have been accounted for and there are local initiatives in many locations for the purpose of better aligning the relationship between home care and hospital care. As far as other developments are concerned, it is the change in the position of the health-care insurers which has become noteworthy. At present, the majority of healthcare insurers operate nationally, health-care insurers have become the hospitals’ negotiating partners, contractual obligations have disappeared and the health-care insurers are taking part in the regional experiments. Furthermore, an increase in scale can also be seen to be a result of mergers. ...|$|R

40|$|Background Pakistan faces huge {{challenges}} in eradicating polio due to widespread poliovirus transmission and security challenges. Innovative interventions are urgently needed to strengthen community buy-in, {{to increase the}} coverage of oral polio vaccine (OPV) and other routine immunisations, and to enhance immunity through the introduction of inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) in combination with OPV. We aimed to evaluate the acceptability and effect on immunisation coverage of an integrated strategy for community engagement and {{maternal and child health}} immunisation campaigns in insecure and conflict-affected polio-endemic districts of Pakistan. Methods We did a community-based three-arm cluster randomised trial in healthy children aged 1 month to 5 years that resided within the study sites in three districts of Pakistan at high risk of polio. Clusters were randomly assigned by a computer algorithm using restricted randomisation in blocks of 20 by an external statistician (1 : 1 : 1) to receive routine polio programme activities (control, arm A), additional interventions with community outreach and mobilisation using an enhanced communication <b>package</b> and <b>provision</b> of short-term preventive maternal and child health services and routine immunisation (health camps), including OPV (arm B), or all interventions of arm B with additional provision of IPV delivered at the maternal and child health camps (arm C). An independent team conducted surveys at baseline, endline, and after each round of supplementary immunisation activity for acceptability and effect. The primary outcome measures for the study were coverage of OPV, IPV, and routine extended programme on immunisation vaccines and changes in the proportion of unvaccinated and fully vaccinated children. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials. gov, number NCT 01908114. Findings Between June 4, 2013, and May 31, 2014, 387 clusters were randomised (131 to arm A, 127 to arm B, and 129 to arm C).

40|$|Abstract The {{turn of the}} {{millennium}} has heralded {{an explosion in the}} popularity of adventure sports often also referred to as alternative lifestyle sports or extreme sports. These are offering both new avenues and potential challenges to the traditional ways of conceptualising and practicing sport. This thesis analyses the development of adventure sports, in particular climbing and kayaking, as a subculture. It delivers a socio-economic history of climbing, analyses the role of the media in its development, its participation and its lived experience. Further it investigates the impact of globalisation, commercialisation and consumerism on adventure sports, and considers to what extent they are being brought into the mainstream as a result. The economic impact of participation in adventure sports is reviewed along with a study of how the make up of its participants has changed as the activities have become more accessible. Particular focus is placed on the analysis of the gender order, specifically looking at the experiences of women in adventure sports. For this purpose the sports culture found in climbing and kayaking is examined and the implications for the reconstruction of gender relations are considered. This study employs an ethnographic approach including both semi-structured and structured interviews with both adventure sports experts and participants, document and media analysis, participant observation and the more recent nethnography approach. One of the significant contributions of this thesis has been to provide a comprehensive review and analysis of the social, cultural and media environment of arguably {{one of the most popular}} lifestyle sports in the UK. It has also shown the strong interrelationship that exists between the media and adventure sports, and has demonstrated how the increased commercialisation and commodification of the activity has resulted in economic development particularly in some remoter parts of the UK through the <b>packaging</b> and <b>provision</b> of the climbing experience. At the same time some participants see this is ‘selling out’. This research has demonstrated how women’s participation in adventure sports has been subject to marginalisation, sexualisation and trivialisation similar to other mainstream sports. However, this work has also highlighted that there is room for optimism as new discourses of femininity contrary to the traditional male hegemony are emerging. Further research opportunities have been identified concerning issues of ethnicity and participation; the social, cultural and economic relationships between adventure sportspeople and rural communities. Emerging feminist discourses also warrant further investigation...|$|R
