25|$|Altham {{says that}} CUCC began {{at a huge}} public area called Parker's Piece but then became tenants at Fenner's in 1846. The club secured the lease of Fenner's in 1873. Francis Fenner had been a bowler with the Cambridge Town Club (CTC) and had {{acquired}} his land in 1846, <b>perhaps</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> express purpose of leasing it to CUCC. CTC and the subsequent Cambridgeshire CCC also played on Parker's Piece.|$|E
25|$|Platform Tickets are {{required}} to be purchased by those {{members of the public}} not boarding trains, but who wish to access the platforms at certain long distance termini, <b>perhaps</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> purpose of receiving or seeing off a passenger. These generally cost , but this price may vary by location. Not all stations issue platform tickets. In their absence, access to the platform is free. A person can be penalised for non-possession of this ticket.|$|E
25|$|A {{foot-rest}} (suppedaneum) {{attached to}} the cross, <b>perhaps</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> purpose of taking the person's weight off the wrists, is sometimes included in representations of the crucifixion of Jesus, but is not discussed in ancient sources. Some scholars interpret the Alexamenos graffito, the earliest surviving depiction of the Crucifixion, as including such a foot-rest. Ancient sources also mention the sedile, a small seat {{attached to the}} front of the cross, about halfway down, which could have served a similar purpose.|$|E

25|$|The {{capital was}} the center of court life. Over time, court rituals to appease spirits developed, and in {{addition}} to his secular duties, the king would serve {{as the head of the}} ancestor worship cult. Often, the king would even perform oracle bone divinations himself, especially near the end of the dynasty. Evidence from excavations of the royal tombs indicates that royalty were buried with articles of value, presumably for use in the afterlife. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> same reason, hundreds of commoners, who may have been slaves, were buried alive with the royal corpse.|$|E
25|$|According to the Jewish writer Benjamin of Tudela, who {{travelled}} {{through the}} kingdom around 1170, there were 1,000 Samaritans in Nablus, 200 in Caesarea and 300 in Ascalon. Since sets a lower {{bound for the}} Samaritan population at 1,500, since the contemporary Tolidah, a Samaritan chronicle, also mentions communities in Gaza and Acre. Benjamin of Tudela estimated the total Jewish population of 14 cities in the kingdom to be 1,200, making the Samaritan population of the time larger than the Jewish, <b>perhaps</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> only time in history.|$|E
25|$|The {{second floor}} {{mezzanine}} is also presumed {{to have been}} divided into fourteen small rooms, seven rooms along {{each side of the}} North and South walls of the building, between the arched ceiling of the second floor. Circular windows in the entablature of the building allowed for illumination. Just as with the second floor assembly room, {{there is no evidence that}} these rooms were ever completed, except <b>perhaps</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> partitions dividing each room. There was a staircase in the second room from the Southeast corner leading to a room above, providing another access method to the attic.|$|E

25|$|The {{whole area}} {{is now an}} archaeological zone {{containing}} {{the remains of the}} walls and of the much larger three-aisled 5th-century Basilica of San Giovanni Evangelista. There is also a baptistry of the 5th to 7th centuries dedicated to St. John the Baptist. This has two fonts, <b>perhaps</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> use of different Rites, and is octagonal with a small apse to the east. A third Church of San Paolo has a central hexagonal plan and was built between the 6th and 12th centuries. There are some ruins left from the castle. Nearby is a large tower, once used as a convent.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{the greater}} part of the 13th century a state of {{comparative}} peace existed at Tallaght, but subsequently the O'Byrnes and O'Tooles, in what would become County Wicklow, took offensive action and were joined by many of the Archbishop's tenants. As a result of this the land was not tilled, the pastures were not stocked and the holdings were deserted. In 1310 the bailiffs of Tallaght got a royal grant to enclose the town. No trace of these defensive walls survive and {{there is no evidence of}} their exact location, except, <b>perhaps,</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> name of the Watergate Bridge which spans the Dodder on the Oldbawn Road.|$|E
25|$|The {{background}} forms a semi-urban {{landscape that}} possesses both rural and semi-industrial components, consistent with Courbevoie of the 1910s (except <b>perhaps</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> rock-like outcrops), a village or town with delicate smokestacks or factory chimneys billowing smoke that blends into the cloudy sky. Evidence that factories were already {{located on the}} Seine (billowing smoke) {{can be seen in}} Gleizes' Péniches et fumées à Courbevoie of 1908. The statuesque nudes themselves are highly stylized, divided into geometrized facets, planes and curves, yet they are graceful, balletic and elegant. The source of light, rather than beaming down from one particular direction, appears to emanate from within the canvas itself, with an intensification {{in the vicinity of the}} bathers.|$|E

25|$|The Abydos boat graves were {{adjacent}} to a massive funerary enclosure for the late Dynasty II (ca. 2675 B.C.) Pharaoh Khasekhemwy at Abydos which is 8 miles from the Nile. Umm el-Qa'ab is a royal necropolis at Abydos, Egypt where early pharaohs were entombed. However, these boat graves were established earlier than late in Dynasty II, <b>perhaps</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> afterlife journeys of Hor-Aha, the first king (ca. 2920–2770) of the First Dynasty of Egypt, or Pharaoh Djer also of Dynasty I. Two more recently located mortuary discoveries {{have been identified as}} those of King Aha, who may have been the son of the famous King Narmer, to whom the first unification of Upper and Lower Egypt is often attributed.|$|E
25|$|This {{position}} and the order of battle which was thus developed, were well calculated to answer the object which Blücher had in view, namely, to hold his ground long enough to gain sufficient time {{for the arrival of}} at least a portion of Wellington's forces, expected to join the Prussian extreme right by the Namur road; as also, <b>perhaps,</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> arrival and co-operation of IV Corps (Bülow's), in rear of Thielemann, by the Gembloux road. In either of these cases if not previously favoured by the circumstances of the general battle about to take place, such a marked accession to his strength would enable him to assume the offensive; whilst, in the first mentioned, Wellington would effectually prevent a junction between Napoleon's and Ney's forces.|$|E
25|$|In the 1950s and 1960s, {{the problem}} became {{increasingly}} popular in scientific circles in Europe and the USA after the RAND Corporation in Santa Monica offered prizes for steps {{in solving the}} problem. Notable contributions were made by George Dantzig, Delbert Ray Fulkerson and Selmer M. Johnson from the RAND Corporation, who expressed the problem as an integer linear program and developed the cutting plane method for its solution. They wrote what is considered the seminal paper on the subject in which with these new methods they solved an instance with 49 cities to optimality by constructing a tour and proving that no other tour could be shorter. Dantzig, Fulkerson and Johnson, however, speculated that given a near optimal solution {{we may be able}} to find optimality or prove optimality by adding a small amount of extra inequalities (cuts). They used this idea to solve their initial 49 city problem using a string model. They found they only needed 26 cuts to come to a solution for their 49 city problem. While this paper did not give an algorithmic approach to TSP problems, the ideas that lay within it were indispensable to later creating exact solution methods for the TSP, though it would take 15 years to find an algorithmic approach in creating these cuts. As well as cutting plane methods, Dantzig, Fulkerson and Johnson used branch and bound algorithms <b>perhaps</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first time.|$|E

500|$|The {{progressing}} {{relationship between}} Maggie Greene and Glenn was well received by critics. Nate Rawlings of Time asserted that their interactions carried the most emotional poignance. Rawlings opined: [...] "She's forced to confront, <b>perhaps</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first time, that these creatures are slobbering monsters. Before her attack, she yelled at Dale [...] for calling them Walkers; to her they're mom, her brother, the neighbors. After her attack, her mind might be changed." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{terms of}} engineering, the Tagora had no major flaws (except <b>perhaps</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> poor cabin ventilation). The 1979 energy crisis, however, dealt {{a blow to}} the European {{automotive}} market: the large car segment contracted significantly, making Chrysler's initial sales projections unrealistic. The Tagora was ultimately launched under the Talbot brand, which was not established in the marketplace and had a confused pedigree, putting the car at an immediate disadvantage in an executive car market dominated by well established offerings such as the Ford Granada. In the view of Martin Buckley Talbot did not advertise the car effectively so [...] "people did not know about the car".|$|E
500|$|James' date {{of death}} is unknown, but Bede implies {{that he was still}} alive during Bede's lifetime, which presumably means that he died after Bede's birth, {{sometime}} around 671 or 672. This would mean that he was at least 70 years old at his death. It has been suggested that James was Bede's informant for the life of Edwin, the works of Paulinus, and <b>perhaps</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Synod of Whitby. The historian Frank Stenton calls James [...] "the one heroic figure in the Roman mission". This reflects {{the fact that many of}} the Gregorian missionaries had a habit of fleeing when things went wrong.|$|E
