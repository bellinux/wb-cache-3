40|$|The Monte-Carlo neutral {{transport}} code 3 D-GAPS is described. The code models impurity {{transport and}} deposition in remote areas, such as gaps between cells of castellated plasma-facing surfaces. A step-by-step {{investigation of the}} interplay of different processes that may influence the deposition inside gaps, namely particle reflection, elastic neutral collisions, different <b>particle</b> <b>sources,</b> chemical erosion and plasma penetration into gaps, is presented. Examples of modelling results in application to the TEXTOR experiment with a castellated test limiter are provided. It is shown that only with the assumption {{of the presence of}} species with different reflection probabilities, do simulated carbon deposition profiles agree with experimental observations for side surfaces of the gaps. These species can be attributed to different <b>particle</b> <b>sources,</b> e. g. carbon atoms and hydrocarbon radicals. Background carbon ions and atoms have low and moderate values of the reflection coefficient (R = 0. 9). Deposition {{at the bottom of the}} gaps cannot be adequately reproduced unless extreme assumptions on <b>particle</b> <b>sources</b> and reflection properties are imposed. Elastic neutral collisions and ionization of neutrals escaping the gaps have no significant influence on the results. Nevertheless, particle-in-cell simulations of plasma penetration into gaps are essential for estimating the incoming ion flux and leading to a better quantitative agreement with experimental observations...|$|R

5000|$|Rutherford {{backscattering}} spectrometry {{is named}} after Lord Ernest Rutherford, a physicist {{sometimes referred to as}} the father of nuclear physics. Rutherford supervised a series of experiments carried out by Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden between 1909 and 1914 studying the scattering of alpha particles through metal foils. While attempting to eliminate [...] "stray particles" [...] they believed to be caused by an imperfection in their alpha source, Rutherford suggested that Marsden attempt to measure backscattering from a gold foil sample. According to the then-dominant plum-pudding model of the atom, in which small negative electrons were spread through a diffuse positive region, backscattering of the high-energy positive alpha particles should have been nonexistent. At most small deflections should occur as the alpha particles passed almost unhindered through the foil. Instead, when Marsden positioned the detector {{on the same side of}} the foil as the alpha <b>particle</b> <b>source,</b> he immediately detected a noticeable backscattered signal. According to Rutherford, [...] "It was quite the most incredible event that has ever happened to me in my life. It was almost as incredible as if you fired a 15-inch shell at a piece of tissue paper and itcame back and hit you." ...|$|E
