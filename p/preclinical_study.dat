40|$|The {{decision}} to initiate invasive, first-in-human trials involving Parkinson’s disease presents a vexing ethical challenge. Such studies present significant surgical risks, and high degrees of uncertainty about intervention risks and biological effects. We argue that maintaining a favorable riskbenefit balance {{in such circumstances}} requires a higher than usual degree of confidence that protocols will lead to significant direct and/or social benefits. One critical way of promoting such confidence is {{through the application of}} stringent evidentiary standards for <b>preclinical</b> <b>studies.</b> We close with a series of recommendations for strengthening the internal and external validity of <b>preclinical</b> <b>studies,</b> reducing their tendency toward optimism and publication biases, and improving the knowledge base used to design and evaluate <b>preclinical</b> <b>studies...</b>|$|R
