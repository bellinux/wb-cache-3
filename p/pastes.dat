5|$|Shoe polish {{products}} are low-value {{items that are}} infrequently purchased, as a single can might last several months {{for even the most}} frequent user. Consumer demand is inelastic and largely insensitive to price change, while sales volumes are generally low. In the shoe polish market as a whole, some 26% of turnover is accounted for by <b>pastes,</b> 24% by creams, 23% by aerosols, and 13% by liquids. In recent years, the demand for shoe polish products has either been static or declined; one reason is the gradual replacement of formal footwear with sneakers for everyday use.|$|E
5|$|The Mexican {{state of}} Hidalgo, and the twin silver mining cities of Pachuca and Real del Monte (Mineral del Monte), have notable Cornish {{influences}} from the Cornish miners who settled there, with pasties being considered typical local cuisine. In Mexican Spanish, they {{are referred to}} as <b>pastes.</b> The town of Real del Monte in Mexico is the site of a museum of pasties. The annual International Pasty Festival is held in Real del Monte for three days each October.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{the effect}} of the mix {{composition}} on rheological behavior of a mixture is studied by considering a two-phase model for a mixture. A mixture is decomposed into a granular and a <b>paste</b> phase. <b>Paste</b> itself is divided into the void <b>paste</b> and the excess <b>paste.</b> The slump test is used for evaluation of rheological behavior of a mixture. The results show that the granular-cement <b>paste</b> mixtures can be split into three main classes viz Granular-High <b>Paste,</b> Granular-Intermediate <b>Paste</b> and Granular-Low <b>Paste.</b> In Granular-High <b>Paste</b> class, the behavior is governed by the excess <b>paste</b> and the capacity of deformation of mixtures is maximal. In Granular-Low <b>Paste</b> class, the behavior is governed by the void <b>paste</b> and the capacity of deformation of mixtures is minimal. In Granular-Intermediate <b>Paste</b> class the behavior is determined by both the excess <b>paste</b> and the void <b>paste,</b> and the deformability is in between that of the two other extreme cases.

5|$|Artificial {{freshwater}} ponds (often called stews) held carp, pike, tench, bream, eel, and other fish. Poultry {{was kept in}} special yards, with pigeon and squab being reserved for the elite. Game was highly prized, but very rare, and included venison, wild boar, hare, rabbit, and birds. Kitchen gardens provided herbs, including some, such as tansy, rue, pennyroyal, and hyssop, which are rarely used today. Spices were treasured and very expensive at that time – they included pepper, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, and mace. Some spices used then, but no longer today in French cuisine are cubebs, long pepper (both from vines similar to black pepper), grains of paradise, and galengale. Sweet-sour flavors were commonly added to dishes with vinegars and verjus combined with sugar (for the affluent) or honey. A common form of food preparation was to finely cook, pound and strain mixtures into fine <b>pastes</b> and mushes, something believed to be beneficial {{to make use of}} nutrients.|$|E
25|$|Plant-based paste {{tends to}} dry {{more quickly than}} silk-based <b>pastes</b> because the plant extract does not hold onto the oil as tightly as silk. Depending on the paper used, plant <b>pastes</b> can dry in 10 to 15 minutes. The more {{absorbent}} the paper is, the faster it dries as the paper absorbs most of the oil. Also, plant <b>pastes</b> tend to smudge more easily than silk <b>pastes</b> due to the loose binding agent.|$|E

25|$|To {{make the}} {{parchment}} more aesthetically pleasing or {{more suitable for}} the scribes, special treatments were used. According to Reed there were a variety of these treatments. Rubbing pumice powder into the flesh side of parchment {{while it was still}} wet on the frame was used to make it smooth and to modify the surface to enable inks to penetrate more deeply. Powders and <b>pastes</b> of calcium compounds were also used to help remove grease so the ink would not run. To make the parchment smooth and white, thin <b>pastes</b> (starchgrain or staunchgrain) of lime, flour, egg whites and milk were rubbed into the skins.|$|E
50|$|The {{process for}} making the <b>paste</b> {{is similar to that}} used to make smooth red bean <b>paste.</b> First, the dried seeds are stewed in water until soft and then mashed into a fine <b>paste.</b> The <b>paste</b> is then watered down to a thin slurry and passed through a sieve and into cheesecloth, with which it is {{squeezed}} dry. This produces a fine crumbly <b>paste,</b> which is then mixed with sugar or other sweeteners and often oil to produce a smooth, sweet <b>paste.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Red bean <b>paste</b> (...) or red bean jam, {{also called}} adzuki bean <b>paste,</b> is a <b>paste</b> made of red beans (also called [...] "adzuki beans"), used in Chinese, Japanese, and Korean cuisine. The <b>paste</b> is {{prepared}} by boiling the beans, then mashing or grinding them. At this stage, the <b>paste</b> can be sweetened or left as it is. The {{color of the}} <b>paste</b> is usually dark red, which comes from the husk of the beans. In Korean cuisine, the adzuki beans (often the black variety) can also be husked prior to cooking, resulting in a white <b>paste.</b> It is also possible to remove the husk by sieving after cooking, but before sweetening, resulting in a red <b>paste</b> that is smoother and more homogeneous.|$|R

25|$|Zinc {{lowers the}} melting point and is low-cost. However {{it is highly}} {{susceptible}} to corrosion and oxidation in air, therefore zinc-containing alloys are unsuitable for some purposes, e.g. wave soldering, and zinc-containing solder <b>pastes</b> have shorter shelf life than zinc-free. Can form brittle Cu-Zn intermetallic layers in contact with copper. Readily oxidizes which impairs wetting, requires a suitable flux.|$|E
25|$|These {{payloads}} contain {{red phosphorus}} as an energetic filler.

25|$|The Mexican Spanish word “paste” (pronounced PAH-steh) {{come from}} the Cornish word pasties, which is {{basically}} a semi-circular turnover made with a pastry crust with sweet or savory fillings. Cornish miners brought the recipe with them as they made {{a good way to}} bring their midday meal with them to the mines. One feature of both pasties and <b>pastes</b> is that they have a thick braided edge. Originally, this was done to provide the miners a way to hold the turnover without getting the filled portion dirty, as {{there was no way to}} wash their hands before eating. The shape and pastry portion of the turnover have remained the same but today, the fillings are decidedly Mexican: mole verde, beans, mole rojo, chicken “tinga,” pineapple, rice pudding and one seasonal specialty is a lamb paste with poblano chili peppers. <b>Pastes</b> are a local delicacy strongly identified with both Pachuca and Real del Monte.|$|E
50|$|The {{semi-solid}} {{condition of}} sugar is called sugar <b>paste.</b> By the time sugar <b>paste</b> starts to form, {{the temperature of}} the mixture can reach 158°C to 160°C.

40|$|Densely packed {{colloidal}} suspension, called <b>paste,</b> {{remembers the}} direction of applied forces, such as vibration and flow, and these memories kept in <b>paste</b> can be visualized as morphology of desiccation crack patterns. For example, when the <b>paste</b> remembers {{the direction of}} vibration, all primary cracks propagate in the direction perpendicular to the direction of initial vibration. On the other hand, when the <b>paste</b> remembers the direction of flow, all primary cracks propagate along the direction of initial flow. These results indicate that external forces imprint easy-breakable direction into <b>paste</b> as memories. Therefore, by controlling memories in <b>paste,</b> we can tune to produce various types of crack patterns, such as cellular, radial, lamellar, ring, spiral and lattice structures. Recently {{we have found that}} memories in <b>paste</b> can be erased by the irradiation of ultrasonic waves to <b>paste</b> as we obtain only isotropic and cellular crack patterns without any anisotropy related to memory effect. This method can be applied to increase the breaking strength of dried <b>paste</b> by homogenizing microstructure in <b>paste...</b>|$|R
