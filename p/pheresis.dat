40|$|BackgroundIntimal {{hyperplasia}} (restenosis) is {{an exaggerated}} healing response leading to failure of half of vascular interventions. Increasing {{evidence suggests that}} circulating progenitor cells contribute to intimal pathology, and clinical studies have demonstrated a correlation between progenitor cells and the incidence of restenosis after cardiovascular interventions. The aims {{of this study were}} to characterize the temporal response of CD 34 + progenitors following vascular injury in an ovine model and to evaluate an affinity <b>pheresis</b> approach to attenuate this response. MethodsAn ovine model underwent either operative vascular injury or a nonvascular surgery (n = 3 per group). Blood was examined perioperatively over 2  weeks by flow cytometry. Next, an affinity <b>pheresis</b> approach to mediate systemic depletion of CD 34 progenitors was designed. Custom agarose <b>pheresis</b> matrix with antibody affinity toward CD 34 or an isotype control was evaluated in vitro. Next, following vascular injury, sheep underwent perioperative whole blood volume <b>pheresis</b> toward either the progenitor cell marker CD 34 (n = 3) or an isotype control (n = 4) for 14  days. Animals were monitored by physical exam as well as complete blood counts. Cells recovered by <b>pheresis</b> were eluted and examined by flow cytometry. ResultsFlow cytometry revealed a focal surge of circulating CD 34 cells after vascular injury but not among surgical controls (P =. 05). Toward the goal of an approach to attenuate the surge of CD 34 progenitors, an evaluation of high-flow affinity matrix revealed efficacy in removal of progenitors from ovine blood in vitro. Next, a separate group of animals undergoing affinity <b>pheresis</b> after vascular injury was evaluated to mediate systemic depletion of CD 34 + cells. Again, a surge of CD 34 + cells was observed among isotype <b>pheresis</b> animals following vascular intervention but was attenuated over 20 -fold by a CD 34 <b>pheresis</b> approach (P =. 029). Furthermore, an average of 77 million CD 34 -positive cells were eluted from the CD 34 <b>pheresis</b> matrix. Despite multiple sessions of <b>pheresis,</b> complete blood counts remained essentially unchanged over 2  weeks. ConclusionsDespite evidence suggesting a role for CD 34 + circulating progenitor cells in restenotic pathology, the temporal pattern of CD 34 progenitors after vascular injury has not been previously defined. We have demonstrated a surge among circulating CD 34 + cells that appears confined to procedures involving vascular injury and that this event seems to occur early after vascular injury. We further conclude that CD 34 affinity <b>pheresis</b> attenuates the surge. This approach for direct depletion of progenitors may have important implications for the study of progenitors in vascular restenosis. Clinical RelevanceRestenosis is a major cause of failure after vascular inteventions. Progenitor cells in the blood are believed to contribute to this disease, and published human studies reveal an association between these cells and increased incidence of restenosis. Our ovine study characterized the pattern of CD 34 + progenitor cells after vascular injury and suggests an early, focal surge event. We further demonstrate a novel <b>pheresis</b> approach to reduce these cells in the bloodstream. This study offers new insights on the progenitor cell changes that follow vascular injury and may provide new insights on this life- and limb-threatening disease...|$|E

This paper discusses a new method to develop a highly portable, slow flow rate plasmapheresis device for continuous therapeutic treatments of patients. The plasmapheresis device, composed of blood flowing tubes and pump, allows a closed, sterile continuous process, which will be applicable to therapeutic usage. The new separation process is based on hydrodynamic effects and the gravitational force. It is very simple and gentle process which can minimize mechanical damage to the cells and also minimize clotting and coagulation problems of blood cells. The separation method provides a unique apparatus with few moving parts and low pressure drop that is very different in operating principle from existing techniques such as centrifugation and membrane ultrafiltration. The new method makes possible development of a small plasmapheresis device which will result in an easily operated <b>pheresis</b> system.

A median of four phereses were performed on each patient. Blood samples from 34 of the 35 patients were harvested through existing double-lumen central catheters, using either a Fenwal CS- 3000 or COBE Spectra <b>pheresis</b> machine. The <b>pheresis</b> procedures were well tolerated overall. A median of 3. 7 x 10 (6) /kg CD 34 + cells were infused (range, 0. 2 - 15. 5 x 10 (6) /kg), and all patients engrafted. The median time to an absolute neutrophil count > 500 /microL was 13 days (range, 9 - 44 days) and to a platelet count > 20, 000 /microL was 21 days (range, 9 - 210 days).

Four-teen adults with hematologic malignan-cies underwent blood HPC transplanta-tion from haploidentical family donors. <b>Pheresis</b> products were stringently de-pleted of T and B cells by immunomag-netic adsorption, and patients received no immunosuppression after transplanta-tion. HSV reactivation occurred in all 7 evaluable HSV- 1 – or HSV- 2 –seropositive patients, at a median of 40 days after transplantation. Susceptibility testing of clinically resistant viral isolates demon-strated acyclovir resistance in all 5 cases tested. Second-line therapy produced only partial responses, and in vitro evidence of foscarnet resistance developed rapidly in all 3 patients treated with foscarnet.

40|$|AbstractImmune {{tolerance}} describes specific unresponsiveness to antigens. In clinical situations such as {{graft-versus-host disease}} {{it may be}} useful to capitalize on these pre-existing tolerance mechanisms to treat patients. Extracorporeal photopheresis is a <b>pheresis</b> treatment whereby the approximately 5 × 109 leukocytes are treated with a photoactivatable compound (8 -methoxypsoralen) and UVA light, and immediately returned to the patient in a closed-loop, patient-connected system. This therapy induces apoptosis of virtually all the treated leukocytes. There is growing evidence that infusion of apoptotic cells may trigger certain tolerance mechanisms and, thus, be of therapeutic use in graft-versus-host disease. These apoptotic cells are taken up by phagocytes (antigen-presenting cells) {{in the body of the}} patient. Apoptotic cell engagement has been reported to induce several changes and functional activities in the engulfing antigen-presenting cell. These antigen-presenting cells: (1) decrease production of proinflammatory cytokines; (2) increase production of anti-inflammatory cytokines; (3) lower ability to stimulate T-cell responses; (4) delete CD 8 T effector cells; and (5) induce regulatory T cells. Any and all of these mechanisms could explain the noted effect in graft-versus-host disease. It is still unclear which one or ones are truly responsible.

However, the number of EPCs in the blood is low, limiting endogenous repair, and a method to rapidly mobilize EPCs has not been reported. In this study, healthy donors were mobilized sequentially with the CXCR 4 antagonist, AMD 3100, and G-CSF. The number of EPCs and circulating angiogenic cells (CACs) in the blood and <b>pheresis</b> product was determined and the angiogenic capacity of each cell population assessed. Compared with baseline, treatment with AMD 3100 or G-CSF increased the number of blood CACs 10. 0 -fold ± 4. 4 -fold and 8. 8 -fold ± 3. 7 -fold, respectively. The number of EPCs in the blood increased 10. 2 -fold ± 3. 3 -fold and 21. 8 -fold ± 5. 4 -fold, respectively. On a percell basis, CACs harvested from G-CSF–mobilized blood displayed increased in vivo angiogenic potential compared with AMD 3100 -mobilized CACs. Mobilized EPCs displayed a greater proliferative capacity than EPCs isolated from baseline blood. Both CACs and EPCs were efficiently harvested by leukapheresis.

GAVeCeLT - the Italian group for venous access devices - has developed a consensus on the evidence-based criteria for the choice and the clinical use of the {{most appropriate}} lock solution for central venous catheters (excluding dialysis catheters). METHOD:After the constitution of a panel of experts, a systematic collection and {{review of the literature}} has been performed, focusing on clinical studies dealing with lock solutions used for prevention of occlusion (heparin, citrate, urokinase, recombinant tissue plasminogen activator [r-TPA], normal saline) or for prevention of infection (citrate, ethanol, taurolidine, ethylene-diamine-tetra-acetic acid [EDTA], vancomycin, linezolid and other antibiotics), in both adults and in pediatric patients. Studies on central lines used for dialysis or <b>pheresis,</b> on peripheral venous lines and on arterial lines were excluded from this analysis. Studies on lock solutions used for treatment of obstruction or infection were not considered. The consensus has been carried out according to the Delphi method. RESULTS:The panel has concluded that: (a) there is no evidence supporting the heparin lock; (b) the prevention of occlusion is based on the proper flushing and locking technique with normal saline; (c) the most appropriate lock solution for infection prevention should include citrate and/or taurolidine, which have both anti-bacterial and anti-biofilm activity, with negligible undesired effects if compared to antibiotics; (d) the patient populations most likely to benefit from citrate/taurolidine lock are yet to be defined.

The IMI-HPCs were compared with CD 34 counts and numbers of colony-forming units (CFUs), The IMI-HPC data were reproducible and dilution experiments yielded a log-linear relationship, The mean percentage of CD 34 (+) cells in 50 umbilical cords was 0. 43 versus 0. 11 of HPCs in the IMI channel (correlation coefficient r = 0. 67), Absolute numbers yielded 96. 79 x 10 (6) /L CD 34 (+) 33. 17 x 10 (6) /L IMI-HPC, and 35. 04 x 10 (6) /L CFU-HPC. Receiver operating characteristics curves were made at various cutoff levels for CD 34 (+) cells to visualize sensitivity and specificity profiles. With median values of 13. 56 x 10 (6) /L for IMI-HPC and 20 x 10 (6) /L for CD 34 (+) as cutoff points (the levels used in the laboratory to start stem cell <b>pheresis),</b> the percentage of false-negative observations was 70. 4 %, To exclude the influence of storage time, tests were repeated until 72 h after umbilical cord collection.

40|$|Introduction: Platelet {{concentrate}} (PC) {{remains one}} of the most important support measures in thrombocytopenic patients. An efficient cell separator is a prerequisite for an optimally functioning apheresis setup. Donor blood count may undergo a temporary reduction after the procedure. Aim: The aim was to find the extent of reduction in donor blood count (hemoglobin, hematocrit, white blood cell, and platelet) after plateletpheresis and to evaluate the cell separator for collection efficiency, processing time, and leukoreduction. Study Design and Methods: Two hundred and thirty seven procedures performed on the Amicus (N = 121), Fenwal CS- 3000 Plus (N = 50) and Cobe spectra (N = 66) in a one year period were evaluated. The procedures performed on the continuous flow centrifugation (CFC) cell separators and donor blood counts (pre and post donation) done were included in the study. Results: The percent reduction in hemoglobin (HB), hematocrit (HCT), white blood cell (WBC) and platelet count ((PLT ct) was 2. 9, 3. 1, 9, 30. 7 (Mean, N = 237) respectively after the procedure. The post donation PLT ct reduced to &# 60; 100 x 109 /L (range 80 - 100) in five donors (N = 5 / 237, Amicus). The pre donation PLT ct in them was 150 - 200 x 109 /L. Collection efficiency (percent) of Amicus (79. 3) was better as compared to the other two machines (CS: 62. 5, Cobe: 57. 5). PC collected on Cobe spectra had &# 60; 1 x 106 WBC.

Randomly assigned treatments on days 1, 3, and 5 were: group 1 (n= 27) placebo, placebo, rhTPO 1. 5 μg/kg; group 2 (n= 27) rhTPO 1. 5 μg/kg, placebo, placebo; groups 3 (n= 28) and 4 (n= 22) rhTPO 0. 5 μg/kg on all 3 treatment days; and group 5 (n= 30) placebo on all 3 treatment days. After high-dose chemotherapy and PBPC transplantation, groups 1 through 4 received rhTPO 1. 5 μg/kg days 0, + 2, + 4, and + 6 with either G-CSF 5 μg/kg/day (groups 1 - 3) or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor 250 μg/m 2 /day (group 4). Group 5 received placebo plus G-CSF 5 μg/kg/day. The addition of rhTPO to G-CSF increased median CD 34 + cell yield/pheresis in cohorts in which rhTPO was started before day 5, with higher yields in groups 2 (2. 67 × 106 /kg) and groups 3 and 4 (3. 10 × 106 /kg) than in group 1 (1. 86 × 106 /kg) or group 5 (1. 65 × 106 /kg) (P=. 006 across groups). Comparing rhTPO to placebo, higher percentages of patients achieved the minimum yield of CD 34 + ≥ 2 × 106 /kg (92 % v 75 %; P=. 050) {{as well as the}} target yield of CD 34 + ≥ 5 × 106 /kg (73 % v 46 %; P=. 041). rhTPO-treated patients required fewer phereses to achieve minimum (P=. 011) and target (P=. 015) CD 34 + cell values. rhTPO given after transplantation did not speed platelet recovery.
