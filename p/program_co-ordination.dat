40|$|Background: The Australian {{government}} has addressed rural medical workforce shortages through {{strategies such as}} the Rural Undergraduate Support and <b>Co-ordination</b> <b>program,</b> {{based on the premise}} that increased exposure to rural medicine within the curricula will contribute to more students adopting a rural career. Purpose: This article reports on how an Australian Rural Clinical School is meeting the aims of this initiative. Methods: Year 3 students (n = 463) from 10 eight-week rural rotations in 2005 - 2006 evaluated the content and value of rural lectures/workshops and a 6 -week rural clinical placement. Results: The aggregate results suggest overall favourable evaluation of the various components of this rotation. Conclusions: A rural rotation can encourage students 2 ̆ 7 interest in and understanding of rural medicine. The longitudinal nature and ongoing evaluation of this program may in time provide more conclusive evidence for this. Challenges such as increasing student numbers, decreasing clinical placements, and logistically complicated programs remain. Research toward alternatives to a "real-life" rural experience may be needed...|$|R
40|$|Sport is {{becoming}} increasingly competitive and this places enormous pressure on sportsmen to perform at their absolute best. For athletes to achieve their greatest potentials, aspects of sport such as reaction time and hand-eye co-ordination needs to be at their peaks. Sports vision aims to enhance performance {{through a variety of}} procedures and training techniques. Materials & Methods: Rugby players aged 18 to 26 were subjected to a sports vision battery consisting of three different hand-eye co-ordination tests. Results: An improvement in performance was observed by players exposed to the exercises. In the ‘number of catches’ test there was a meaningful improvement of 12 %. A 22 % improvement was observed in the number of successful catches (simultaneous ball- throwing) and an 8 % and 3 % improvement in the number of successful throws through a ring (accurate passing) to the left and right sides respectively. Discussion & Conclusion: It is very important to measure hand-eye co-ordination alongside the standard measuring of cardiopulmonary and metabolic status to determine the athletic abilities of sporting individuals. Visual abilities can affect both motor skill and performance. This study proves that correct training <b>programs</b> and hand-eye <b>co-ordination</b> tests can vastly improve sporting performance. Athletes are advised to complete at least 15 minutes of sport-specific visual training during each day of practice.

40|$|Although Japan has a {{basically}} free economic system, it {{is necessary}} to have a long range economic project in order to carry out a sound economic policy with foresightedness. As a project of this sort, the New Long-Range Economic Program was framed by the Economic Council at the end of 1957, in response to a request of the government. In 1960 this program was reformed and developed as the National Income Doubling Program which makes clear the aim to double the national income in ten years. A feature of this program is that it has the planning of public investment as its core, though the considerations of private investment and of various institutional measures are not lacking. Tables 1 and 2 show, respectively, how this program estimates the future development of national economy and transport in this country. As regards transport, table 2 indicates a considerable (relative) decrease of the share of railways as compared with a remarkable increase of the share of cars and trucks. The extent of investment necessary for realizing those developments is also calculated. The sum which falls under the heading of public investment is shown in Table 3. What is noticeable here is that the road investment is to be greatly expanded during the coming 10 years so as to make road facilities fit for rapidly increasing automobiles. Table 4 shows the expected road improvement during 10 years in case the road investment of Table 3 is realized, and Table 5 shows the anticipated increase of automobiles. Comparing Tables 4 and 5, we cannot be so optimistic as to the condition of road congestion after 10 years, because, if the anticipation of Table 5 comes true, the increase of vehicles will necessarily outpace the road improvement in spite of the acceleration of road improvement through the expanded road investment. In the proposed program a number of organizational or institutional measures in the transport field of investment along with the over-all expansion of facilities, will improve transport systems so that they will meet expanded economic activities anticipated after 10 years. However, the author believes that the proposals are not adequate enough and must be intensified, modified or supplemented by other considerations in order to satisfy the expanded future requirements from industrial field. The author intends to clarify the inescapable defects of the proposals and other considerations made in the program, arranging them in three major points, namely; the program is 1) does not recognize fully the necessity of further rationalization in each transport field; 2) does not consider the problem of integration and co-ordination in transport in their full scale; 3) does not always gear with industrial location program and city redevelopment <b>program,</b> without whose <b>co-ordination</b> any extensive transport program result in a failure or a paper-plan.

40|$|Un lac collinaire est une retenue créée par un petit barrage en terre. Les lacs collinaires contiennent quelques dizaines de milliers à {{1 million}} de m 3 d'eau recueillie sur des bassins versants d'une superficie de quelques {{hectares}} à quelques km 2. Ils s'intègrent de façon naturelle dans le paysage en ne créant pas de nuisance particulière. Ils sont aptes à réguler les flux hydriques et donc susceptibles de maintenir les populations en place en leur assurant de réelles possibilités de développement. HYDROMED est un programme de recherche mené dans quatre pays (Liban, Maroc, Syrie et Tunisie), engagés dans une politique de construction de petits barrages en complément des réalisations de grande hydraulique. L'objectif du projet HYDROMED a été d'étudier l'aménagement " lac collinaire" et ses impacts sur l'environnement proche et sur les sociétés rurales riveraines. Outre les opérations de coordination et de formation, quatre opérations de recherches ont été menées- Synthèse des travaux existants et choix des sites pour les expérimentations,- Eau - Sol - Environnement,- Agronomie - Impacts sociaux et économiques,- Pérennité du lac collinaire et son intégration dans le développement durable des régions marginales. A hill reservoir {{is a small}} lake resulting from a small dam. Hill reservoirs contain fifty thousand to one million m 3 of runoff water from watersheds whose areas range from a few hectares to several km 2. They are integrated in a natural way within the landscape and do not create any particular pollution problems. They regulate water flow and thus help to maintain populations in place, ensuring for them real possibilities of development. Their construction has several objectives:- protection of downstream infrastructures against floods and erosion;- assuring availability of water at several places in the landscape for domestic needs, watering cattle, micro-irrigation, and water harvesting for refilling shallow groundwater reserves;- development of new economic activities: irrigation, breeding, fishing and fish farming, tourism, and {{improvement of the environment}} (creation of oases, afforestation, etc.). The HYDROMED research project was undertaken in four countries (Lebanon, Morocco, Syria and Tunisia) where a strong policy favouring the building of small dam is going on in parallel to the construction of large dams. The goal of the HYDROMED project is {{to assess the impact of}} these hydraulic dams on the local environment and on lakeside rural communities. In addition to a training <b>program</b> and <b>co-ordination</b> activities, four projects were carried out:- Synthesis of existent data from each country and a choice of test sites for relevant experimentation; - Characterization of the water and soil environment;- Examination of agronomy, agricultural economy and the social management of water;- Sustainability of the hill reservoir and its integration into sustainable development of marginal regions. After an analysis and synthesis of these projects in each country, seven test sites were chosen and a multidisciplinary approach was adopted. All small reservoirs at the test sites were equipped with a water level gauge, an evaporation pan, and two stations for automatic data collection. One station was connected to a tipping bucket rain gauge (0. 5 mm rainwater), whereas the other was connected to probes that measured water and air temperatures and water levels with 1 cm accuracy. The spillways were shaped in such a way that discharge could be estimated. Since the beginning of the project, annual records of all observations made from September to August at these test sites have been published. A computerized bank of hydrological data was set up. The parameters describing the watersheds were also recorded in a similar data bank. Maps of different watersheds were stored using a geographical information system (GIS). The main objective of this work was to build a hydrological model suitable for semiarid Mediterranean catchments with hill reservoirs, with two specific objectives: (i) rainfall-runoff simulation and (ii) simulation of reservoir storage capacity and probability of failure. This model, called HYDROMED (RAGAB et al., 2001 a, b, c), provided the project with an accurate understanding of the water resource and allowed the evaluation of water availability for different uses. The bathymetry of each reservoir was measured at least once every two hydrological years, and was compared with a fine resolution land survey, making it possible to determine the rate of siltation in the pond, and to establish depth/volume and depth/surface curves. At the same time, studies on sheet erosion and gully erosion were carried out in the watersheds. Solid transport varied from 1. 8 t/ha/an on a small forested catchment with soil conservation management (El Gouazine in Tunisia) to 50 t/ha/an on a cultivated catchment with marl in the Rif foothills (Morocco). A model was applied to compute the solid transport for each flood (ALBERGEL et al. 2003). It showed that solid transport is not a linear function of time and noted, for example, that 3 floods were responsible for 50 % of the sedimentation that occurred in the Kamech dam (Tunisia) between the years 1994 and 2002. Water samples were collected seasonally during the project. Electrical conductivity (E. C.) and pH were measured and the concentrations in the major ions were determined (RAHAINGOMANANA, 1998). The geochemical characterization of the water in hill reservoirs showed three major groups: calcium sulphate water types, calcium bicarbonate dominated waters and sodium chloride dominated waters. The observations made during different hydrological periods aided in the understanding of the present geochemical evolution of water and confirmed the importance of reservoir hydrology in this evolution. Simulations with the Expreso model (RIEU et al., 1997) were used to estimate the risk of water quality deterioration due to evaporation. An agronomic survey was carried out in Tunisia on water requirements for the main cropping systems and for different irrigation systems (traditional, sprinkler or drip irrigation) on two semi-arid sites. At the catchment scale, measurements of energy balance showed a very strong water demand throughout the year. Values of potential evapotranspiration were always greater than 4 mm/day at Kamech (Cap Bon Peninsula) and greater than 5 mm/day at El Gouazine (Central Tunisia). During winter, high potential evapotranspiration values are due to strong winds. Micro-meteorological studies on rainfed agriculture allowed the estimation of actual evapotranspiration fluxes for hard wheat at both sites. The observed actual evapotranspiration of hard wheat (2. 3 mm/day at Kamech and 1. 9 mm/day at El Gouazine from mid-February to mid-May) was always less than potential evapotranspiration. Micro-meteorological measurements on a drip irrigated tomato crop showed an actual evapotranspiration rate of 6 to 7 mm/day in July for an irrigation height of 9 to 10 mm/day. Thermic stresses were observed in summer time when air temperatures exceeded 45 °C (Vacher and Mougou, in HYDROMED 2001). Economic, social and environmental studies were made using surveys with the farmers. Access to water and social organizations were studied as well as the division of responsibilities among state, collectivities and the individual. The use of water in the hill reservoirs appeared to be limited, but variable from one lake to the other. On the Kamech site in Cap Bon the dam was equipped with 4 fuel water pumps. Intensive cultivation of drip-irrigated tomatoes and peppers (10 ha) coexists with traditional irrigated gardens. There is little to no exploitation of hill reservoirs that are far from the markets. Among other uses of the reservoir water, cattle watering and domestic needs were also important. In all semi-arid Mediterranean regions, ovine breeding is an important income for farmers...|$|R
