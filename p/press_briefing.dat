Capcom later announced that the demo would become available for both Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 owners on 18 September 2012. Early access to the demo was included with Dragon's Dogma. As a result of criticism of the first demo, Capcom brought a different version of the demo to the 2012 San Diego Comic-Con, modifying various parts of its gameplay. Originally scheduled to be released on 20 November 2012, the game's release date was pushed forward to 2 October 2012. Prior to the game's launch, several copies of the game were stolen and went on sales in Poland.|$|E

5|$|The {{disaster}} and investigation received widespread media coverage. The {{impact on the}} public was increased by the dramatic effect of an amateur photo taken of the aircraft rolling that was published {{on the front page of}} the Chicago Tribune on the Sunday two days after the crash. There were some early reports that a collision with a small aircraft had been the cause of the crash. This apparently was the result of the discovery of small-aircraft parts among the wreckage at the crash site. National Transportation Safety Board vice-chairman Elwood T. Driver, in a <b>press</b> <b>briefing,</b> was photographed holding a broken bolt and nut, implying that these parts were a cause of the accident. The small-plane parts were subsequently determined to have been on the ground at the time of the crash, at the former general aviation Ravenswood Airport, a facility that had been out of service for a few years. An owner there had been selling used aircraft parts from a remaining hangar building.|$|E

The combined curvature, synchrotron, and inverse-Compton emission from ultra-relativistic positrons and electrons, which are created by two-photon and/or one-photon pair creation processes, or emitted from the neutron-star surface, provide us with essential information on {{the properties of the}} accelerator [...] electric potential drop along the magnetic field lines. A new accelerator model, which is a mixture of traditional inner-gap and outer gap models, is also proposed, by solving the Poisson equation for the electrostatic potential together with the Boltzmann equations for particles and gamma-rays in the two-dimensional configuration and two-dimensional momentum spaces.
