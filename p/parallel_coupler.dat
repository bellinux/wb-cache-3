40|$|The Model Coupling Toolkit (MCT) is a {{software}} library for constructing parallel coupled models from individual parallel models. MCT {{was created to}} address the challenges of creating a <b>parallel</b> <b>coupler</b> for the Community Climate System Model (CCSM). Each of the submodels that make up CCSM is a separate parallel application with its own domain decomposition, running on {{its own set of}} processors. This application contains multiple instances of the M × N problem, the problem of transferring data between two parallel programs running on disjoint sets of processors. CCSM also requires efficient data transfer to facilitate its interpolation algorithms. MCT was created as a generalized solution to handle these and other common functions in parallel coupled models.

40|$|The {{high degree}} of {{computational}} complexity of atmosphere and ocean general circulation models, land-surface models, and dynamical sea-ice models makes coupled climate modeling a grand-challenge problem in high-performance computing. On distributed-memory parallel computers, a coupled model comprises multiple message-passingparallel models, each of which must exchange data among themselves or through a special component called a coupler. The Model Coupling Toolkit (MCT) {{is a set of}} Fortran 90 objects {{that can be used to}} easily create low bandwidth parallel data exchange algorithms and other functions of a <b>parallel</b> <b>coupler.</b> In this paper we describe the MCT, how it vas employed to implement some of the important functions found in the flux coupler for the Parallel Climate Model(PCM), and compare the per- formance of MCT-based PCM functions with their PCM counterparts...|$|E

An array of 13 x 10 soliton waveguides has been induced in a lithium niobate crystal using c. w. laser light at 532 nm wavelength. The spatial separation between waveguides (100 pm) ensures soliton writing without interactions, avoiding the possible deformation of soliton channels {{over a long}} distance (more than 15 diffraction lengths) and allowing the individual addressing of each soliton waveguide. The coupling and guiding properties of this <b>parallel</b> optical <b>coupler</b> at different wavelengths, with c. w. and pulsed laser signals, are investigated...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 73 - 77). An {{increasing number}} of multi-physics modeling applications require the coupling {{of two or more}} computational models; which coupling consists of incorporating the interaction between two or more numerical models. One approach to computational coupling is to force elds and variables from one model into the other, without changing the original numerical formulation of either model. This approach {{is often referred to as}} "weak" or "loose" coupling. The main objective of this research has been the development of a purely distributed <b>parallel</b> <b>coupler</b> library, called the Distributed Coupling Toolkit (DCT). The DCT is a software library that supports weak coupling between pairs of computational models, whose design provides scalability in both the model's physical complexity and parallel processing. A purely distributed coupling approach reduces inter-process synchronization and improves scalability and resource utilization. This scalability facilitates the implementation of complex model coupling, and enables the inclusion of more model components, higher model resolutions, and dynamic parallel processing con gurations. Performance results show the e ectiveness of the approach adopted with the DCT's implementation. The tests evaluate the distributed approach compared with the commonly used centralized approach. The performance results reveal the drawbacks of a centralized approach and its model coupling implementation, which includes bottlenecks, lack of scalability, and limited model resolution bound by available memory. The distributed approach overcomes all of these problems and restrictions, thereby offering better load balancing. Posterior results of an in-depth performance evaluation of the library implementation lead to a focus on the registration phase (setup) of the DCT. The outcome is a scalable implementation able to handle larger number of processing elements (PEs) without running into memory bounds or PE constraints of the centralized coupling implementations. Coastal simulations require approaches that are able to simulate the effect of the complexity of the bathymetry, rapid currents, and high gradients of density. An approach for use in the General Curvilinear Environmental Model for coastal simulation which features the utilization of the DCT is presented. The seamount test is used to illustrate the potential bene ts of using the DCT to effciently address coastal simulation challenges...|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} is to provide a {{framework}} for future researchers to understand and use the FARSITE wildfire-forecasting model with data assimilation. Current wildfire models lack the ability to provide accurate prediction of fire front position faster than real-time. When FARSITE is coupled with a recursive ensemble filter, the data assimilation forecast method improves. The scope includes an explanation of the standalone FARSITE application, technical details on FARSITE integration with a <b>parallel</b> program <b>coupler</b> called OpenPALM, and a model demonstration of the FARSITE-Ensemble Kalman Filter software using the FireFlux I experiment by Craig Clements. The results show that the fire front forecast is improved with the proposed data-driven methodology than with the standalone FARSITE model...|$|R

Some grooves are oriented parallel to the strips and just next to them. It can be shown that an appropriate depth of the grooves can be used for equalizing the even- and odd-mode phase velocity in a coupled microstrip lines with proper geometrical dimensions. Sets of design graphs are derived for various depths of grooves as a parameter and with curves that implies phase velocity equalization curves. The simulated scattering parameters for couplers in conventional and proposed topology show the efficacy of the new grooved substrates. 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, a {{microstrip}} {{transmission line}} {{combined with a}} new U-headed dumb-bell defected ground structure (DGS) is investigated. The proposed DGS of two U-shape slots connected by a thin transverse slot {{is placed in the}} ground plane of a microstrip line. A finite cutoff frequency and attenuation pole is observed and thus, the equivalent circuit of the DGS unit can be represented by a parallel LC resonant circuit in series with the transmission line. A two-cell DGS microstrip line yields a better lowpass filtering characteristics. The simulation is carried out by the MoM based IE 3 D software and in the experimental measurements a vector network analyzer is used. The ef-fects of the transverse slot width and the distance between arms of the U-slot on the filter response curve are studied. This DGS is utilized for different microstrip circuit appli-cations. The DGS is placed in the ground of a capacitive loaded microstrip line and a very low cutoff frequency is obtained. The DGS is adopted under the coupled lines of a <b>parallel</b> line <b>coupler</b> and an improvement in coupling co-efficient is noticed. The proposed DGS is also incorporated in the ground plane under the feed lines and the coupled lines of a bandpass filter to improve separately the stop-band and passband performances...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaf 58) A Broadband Balanced Amplifier {{has been}} designed to operate at the octave-wide bandwidth of 8 to 16 GHz. Two amplifier stages are combined in <b>parallel</b> using Lange <b>couplers,</b> where each stage uses a GaAs Heterojunction FET. The matching network is designed to compensate for the transistor's gain roll-off over the bandwidth. Two designs are shown; one using lumped elements, the other using distributed elements. The Excel-based RF-MW Design 2009 Software aids in the amplifier design calculations. The design is then simulated in Ansoft Designer CAD software, and is further optimized for performance. It is emphasized that proper calculations will only provide a first order, or "baseline" solution. Iterative optimizations using software, along with fundamental knowledge, are required to resolve remaining unknowns and obtain the final design. This is particularly the case for the gain flatness parameter. This project will present the amplifier design theory used, and the results of the two designs...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} the global configuration of a coupled atmosphere/ocean model. The atmosphere is simulated by the ECHAM 5 {{and the ocean}} by the Finite-Element Sea-Ice Ocean Model (FESOM), which supports unstructured meshes and allows for variable resolution. Coupling between structured and unstructured meshes is a technically challenging task due to different geometry, resolution and representation of coastlines in both components. This has been achieved via the <b>parallel</b> OASIS 4 <b>coupler</b> and additional use of a regular exchange mesh. The latter has been introduced in the ocean model. The conservation of flux moments requires additional care since model grids are different in both components. The heat and moisture fluxes are computed in the atmospheric model so that the flux variance {{is defined by the}} resolution in the atmosphere. Since it is problematic to downscale the variance onto the fine resolved parts of the ocean, a few interpolation techniques are suggested. We validate the coupled setup on the basis of an integration run for 300 years...|$|R
40|$|A coupler is a {{fundamental}} software tool for Earth system modeling. Targeting the requirements of 3 -D coupling, high-level sharing, common model software platform and better parallel performance, we started to design and develop a community coupler (C-Coupler) from 2010 in China, and finished the first version (C-Coupler 1) recently. C-Coupler 1 is a <b>parallel</b> 3 -D <b>coupler</b> that achieves the same (bitwise-identical) results with any number of processes. Guided by the general design of C-Coupler, C-Coupler 1 enables various component models and various coupled models to be integrated on the same common model software platform to achieve a higher-level sharing, where the component models and the coupler can keep the same code version in various model configurations for simulation. Moreover, it provides the C-Coupler platform, a uniform runtime environment for operating various kinds of model simulations in the same manner. C-Coupler 1 is ready for Earth system modeling, and it is publicly available. In China, {{there are more and}} more modeling groups using C-Coupler 1 for the development and application of models...|$|R
40|$|Vertical coupler filters (VCF) exhibiting narrow handwidth and low {{sidelobe}} {{levels have}} been designed and demonstrated. Narrow bandwidth filter response is achieved due to the strong asymmetry between the waveguides of the filter and the nondispersive characteristics of the anitresonant reflecting optical waveguide (ARROW) structure. An ARROW-type VCF with a conventional <b>parallel</b> coupled directional <b>coupler</b> configuration with a full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of 1. 36 nm and a maximum sidelobe level of- 8. 5 dB was fabricated using a coumpound glass consisting of SiO_ 2 and SiO_ 2 /Ta_ 2 O_ 5. The filter sidelobe levels were then further suppressed by using an X-crossing arrangement to provide coupling strength apodization along the device. The sidelobe levels of this modified X-crossing filter were suppressed to below - 23 dB and the measured FWHM was 3. 9 nm. The central wavelength of the reported filters are in the 1. 55 μm region. The measured results are in good agreement with theoretical results from an analysis procedure that combines the coupled mode theory with the finite difference complex mode solver...|$|R

With this new fully <b>parallel</b> OASIS 4 <b>coupler</b> we target the needs of Earth system modelling in its full complexity. The primary focus of this article is to describe the design of the OASIS 4 software and how the coupling software drives the whole coupled model system ensuring the synchronization of the different component models. The application programmer interface (API) manages the coupling exchanges between arbitrary climate component models, as well as the input and output from and to files of each individual component. The OASIS 4 Transformer instance performs the parallel interpolation and transfer of the coupling data between source and target model components. As a new core technology for the software, the fully parallel search algorithm of OASIS 4 is described in detail. First benchmark results are discussed with simple test configurations to demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of the software when applied to Earth system model components. Typically the compute time needed in order to perform the search is in the order of a few seconds and is only weakly dependant on the grid size...|$|R
40|$|A {{wavelength}} division multiplexer (WDM) for 980 / 1550 nm {{based on}} planar curved waveguide coupler (CWC) is proposed. Compared with conventional <b>parallel</b> straight waveguide <b>coupler</b> (SWC), this structure has more flexibility with two variable parameters of bending radius R and minimum edge-to-edge spacing do, {{which are the}} two main parameters for the splitting ratio of coupler and decrease the complexity of device design and fabrication. Based on coupled mode theory (CMT) and waveguide theory, R and do of the WDM CWC {{are designed to be}} R = 13. 28 m and d(0) = 4. 39 mu m. The contrast ratio (CR) and insertion loss (IL) for 980 and 1550 nm are CR 1 = 24. 62 dB, CR 2 = 24. 56 dB and IL 1 = 0. 014 dB, IL 2 = 0. 015 dB, respectively. The 3 D beam propagation method (BPM) is used to verify the validity of the design result. The influence of R and d(0) variations on the device performance is analyzed. For CR > 20 dB, the variation ranges of R and d(0) should be within - 0. 10 to + 0. 44 m and - 0. 05 to + 0. 02 mu m, respectively. (c) 2006 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved...|$|R
