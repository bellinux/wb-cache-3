Up to date, three studies have been performed on how Engineering News Record’s (ENR) Top 400 Contractor use CPM. The first study was performed by Edward Davis in 1974 and the second was performed by Amir Tavakoli and Roger Riachi in 1990. This paper is {{a summary of the}} third survey, which took place in 2003. The results from the three studies indicate that CPM use by the Top 400 Contractors is growing and the areas of use are expanding. The number one use of CPM throughout the years is detailed planning before the start of construction. Periodic control during construction is another large area of CPM use and has been a large area of growth due to the advances in technology, which make updating a schedule during construction easier and faster than was possible with a mainframe computer in the past. Another area of CPM growth is estimating and bidding for several reasons: use in this area has jumped from 19 % to 54 % in the past 30 years. An area of concern lately in CPM is the use of <b>precedence</b> <b>diagramming</b> instead of arrow diagramming.

And, of course, it is paperless. Boeing created a complex lean management process called 'define and control airplane configuration/manufacturing resource management' (DCAC/MRM). The process was built with the help of the operations research and computer sciences departments of the University of Pittsburgh. The manufacture of the Boeing 777 was ultimately a success, and it became the precursor to succeeding generations of CALM at Boeing.

Quite often, these methods are criticized for their limited information capturing ability. Relationship Diagramming Method (RDM) proposed by Plotnick in the recent past, is an improved variant of PDM, which can store additional information on relationships that would improve the scheduling process. In addition to basic data on the activities, additional information can be represented through five codes in RDM. Sequencing of activities in a construction project is primarily driven by the construction logic and/or the availability of resources. There is scope for arriving at alternate sequences with varying availability of resources to achieve the objectives of project scheduling {{as long as the}} construction logic is preserved. In order to achieve such a resource-constrained project scheduling, additional information on the restraints of the activities are necessary, which can be modelled using RDM through one of the five codes of RDM.

An activity's dependence on a resource has been captured using Reason/Why code in this study.

40|$|Although {{the birth}} of <b>Precedence</b> <b>Diagramming</b> Method (PDM) is not as radiant as of CPM or PERT, but it is {{definitely}} the prevailing scheduling technique of our times. This popularity is due to its modeling flexibility over other techniques and the easy-to-understand mathematical model behind the technique. However, even this technique has its own limitations; modeling overlapping activities in a proper way {{seems to be a}} never-ending debate. The reason of this {{can be found in the}} fundamentals of PDM technique; the four precedence relationships that form connections between the end-points of the activities, with constant production speed. These fundamentals of PDM have their own consequences to scheduling practice; it is more and more apparent among professionals that activity overlapping in PDM cannot be modeled adequately. Different solutions were proposed for solving this problem from the application of negative lag, through the combination of SS and FF relations to the fragmentation of activities. All these solutions have their shortcomings. Probably the fragmentation technique has led to the development of point-to-point type of relation that can connect any arbitrary points of the dependent activities. The objective of this paper is to analyze the pros and cons of different solutions that are used for modeling overlapped activities, then to show how newly defined point-to-point relations can be used for this purpose. Algorithms that handles point-to-point relations with minimal and maximal lags are also presented. The main finding of the paper is that newly developed point-topoint relations are better from theoretical and practical point of view than the solutions based on traditional precedence relationships, but they still cannot provide theoretically perfect solution for overlapping.

40|$|Abstract: Resource-constrained project {{scheduling}} involves the scheduling of project activities subject to precedence and resource constraints {{in order to}} meet the objective(s) in the best possible way. The area covers a wide variety of problem types. The objective of this paper is to provide a survey of what we believe are important recent in the area. Our main focus will be on the recent progress made in and the encouraging computational experience gained with the use of optimal solution procedures for the basic resource-constrained {{project scheduling}} problem (RCPSP) and important extensions. The RCPSP involves the scheduling of a project its duration subject to zero-lag finish-start precedence constraints of the PERT/CPM type and constant availability constraints on the required set of renewable resources. We discuss recent striking advances in dealing with this problem using a new depth-first branch-and-bound procedure, elaborating on the effective and efficient branching scheme, bounding calculations and dominance rules, and discuss the potential of using truncated branch-and-bound. We derive a set of conclusions from the research on optimal solution procedures for the basis RCPSP and subsequently illustrate how effective and efficient branching rules and several of the strong dominance and bounding arguments can be extended to a rich and realistic variety of related problems. The preemptive resource-constrained project scheduling problem (PRCPSP) relaxes the nonpreemption condition of the RCPSP, thus allowing activities to be interrupted at integer points in time and resumed later without additional penalty cost. The generalized resource-constrained project scheduling (GRCPSP) extends the RCPSP to the case of <b>precedence</b> <b>diagramming</b> type of <b>precedence</b> constraints (minimal finish-start, start-start, start-finish, finish-finish precedence relations), activity ready times, deadlines and variable resource availability's. The resource-constrained project scheduling problem with generalized precedence relations (RCPSP-GPR) allows for start-start, finish-start and finish-finish constraints with minimal and maximal time lags. The MAX-NPV problem aims at scheduling project activities in order to maximize the net present value of the project in the absence of resource constraints. The resource-constrained project scheduling problem with discounted cash flows (RCPSP-DC) aims at the same non-regular objective in the presence of resource constraints. The resource availability cost problem (RACP) aims at determining the cheapest resource availability amounts for which a feasible solution exists that does not violate the project deadline. In the discrete time/cost trade-off problem (DTCTP) the duration of an activity is a discrete, non-increasing function of the amount of a single nonrenewable resource committed to it. In the discrete time/resource trade-off problem (DTRTP) the duration of an activity is a discrete, non-increasing function of the amount of a single renewable resource. Each activity must then be scheduled in one of its possible execution modes. In addition to time/resource trade-offs, the multi-mode project scheduling problem (MRCPSP) allows for resource/resource trade-offs and constraints on renewable, nonrenewable and doubly-constrained resources. We report on recent computational results and end with overall conclusions and suggestions for future research. Scheduling; Optimal;...|$|R
