50|$|<b>Polyglycerol</b> <b>polyricinoleate</b> (PGPR), E476, is an {{emulsifier}} {{made from}} glycerol and fatty acids (usually from castor bean, {{but also from}} soybean oil). In chocolate, compound chocolate and similar coatings, PGPR is mainly used with another substance like lecithin to reduce viscosity. It is used at low levels (below 0.5%), and works by decreasing the friction between the solid particles (e.g. cacao, sugar, milk) in molten chocolate, reducing the yield stress so that it flows more easily, approaching the behaviour of a Newtonian fluid. It {{can also be used}} as an emulsifier in spreads and in salad dressings, or to improve the texture of baked goods. It is made up of a short chain of glycerol molecules connected by ether bonds, with ricinoleic acid side chains connected by ester bonds.|$|E

First, undecenoic acid was covalently attached to oligo-ricinoleic acid using immobilized Candida antarctica lipase (CAL) at a 30 % yield. Thirty percent conversion also occurred for CAL-catalyzed esterification between undecenoic acid and biocatalytically-prepared <b>polyglycerol</b> <b>polyricinoleate</b> (PGPR), with attachment of undecenoic acid occurring primarily at free hydroxyls of the polyglycerol moiety. The synthesis of oligo-ricinoleyl-, undecenoyl- structured triacylglycerols comprised two steps.

40|$|Abstract Biodiesels {{are mostly}} {{produced}} from lipid transesterification of vegetable oils, including those from soy-bean, jatropha, palm, rapeseed, sunflower, and others. Unfortunately, transesterification of oil produces various un-wanted side products, including steryl glucosides (SG), which precipitate {{and need to}} be removed to avoid clogging of filters and engine failures. So far, efficient and cost-effective methods to remove SGs from biodiesel are not available. Here we describe {{for the first time the}} identification, charac-terization and heterologous production of an enzyme capable of hydrolyzing SGs. A synthetic codon-optimized version of the lacS gene from Sulfolobus solfataricus was efficiently expressed and purified from Escherichia coli, and used to treat soybean derived biodiesel containing 100 ppm of SGs. After optimizing different variables, we found that at pH 5. 5 and 87 °C, and in the presence of 0. 9 % of the emulsifier <b>polyglycerol</b> <b>polyricinoleate,</b> 81 % of the total amount of SGs present in biodiesel were hydrolyzed by the enzyme.

40|$|In most {{publications}} concerning edible W/O/W-emulsions, the low-HLB emulsifier <b>polyglycerol</b> <b>polyricinoleate</b> (PGPR) is used {{to stabilize}} the W/O-interface in combination with a high-HLB emulsifier which stabilizes the O/ W-interface. Therefore, PGPR {{was used as the}} reference low-HLB emulsifier and compared to two alternative low-HLB emulsifiers namely ammonium phosphatide (AMP) and low-HLB sucrose ester O- 170. As high-HLB emulsifiers both random coil (sodium caseinate) and globular proteins (whey protein isolate) were used. Hereby, the use of WPI led to similar, high enclosed water volume fractions for all used low-HLB emulsifiers whereas the use of Na-Caseinate led to almost no enclosed water in the emulsions containing ammonium phosphatide. Finally, the influence of osmotic pressure gradients on the release of an enclosed compound was examined. Therefore, the W/O/W-emulsions were diluted in iso-, hypo-and hypertonic solutions after which the release of an enclosed marker compound was followed over time. Hereby, AMP-and O- 170 stabilized W/O/W-emulsions released the enclosed marker due to swelling under hypotonic dilution whereas hyper-and isotonic dilution never led to release of the enclosed marker, regardless of the used low-HLB emulsifier...|$|E

Such protein micro-particles, having controlled size, protein content, and surface composition {{can be useful in}} the development of novel food products with high protein content. Protein particles were formed through emulsification of a WPI (whey protein isolate) solution (25 % w/w) in sunflower oil containing 2. 5 % (w/w) PGPR (<b>Polyglycerol</b> <b>Polyricinoleate)</b> as an oil-soluble emulsifier. The emulsion (w/o) was heated to induce gelation of the protein inside the emulsion droplets. Oil was removed through successive centrifugation and washing steps. This resulted in micron-sized protein particles dispersed in an aqueous phase. The average diameter of the particles was in the order of a few [mu]m, depending on the mixing speeds applied in the primary emulsification step. CLSM (Confocal laser scanning microscopy) analysis of protein particles indicated that there is oil associated with the particles, either surrounding the particles and/or distributed throughout the particles.

40|$|Abstract The multiobjective {{optimization}} {{method was}} applied {{in order to}} improve the droplet size distribution and stability of water-in-oil emulsions composed of sunflower and pumpkin seed oils as continuous phase, <b>polyglycerol</b> <b>polyricinoleate</b> as emulsifier, water as dispersed phase and sodium chloride as co-stabilizer (lipophobe). Three composition factors were varied based on the three level Box-Behnken design and three characteristics of the obtained emulsions were measured for each experimental run. The mean volume diameter of water droplets and the span of the droplet size distribution, both determined immediately upon preparation of the emulsion, as well as the stability index over a three-month period were interrelated by regression functions with the surfactant concentration, oil composition and the salt content in the water phase of the emulsion. Also, the fourth objective function based on a difference in the prices of pumpkin seed and sunflower oils was considered for optimization. The multiobjective optimum was calculated by using the minimal loss method with weight factors. Additionally, effects of the continuous phase composition and the salt content on the equilibrium interfacial tension of water-oil systems and the changes of the droplet size distribution over time were studied...|$|E

Emulsions (with gelled inner water droplets and gelled water continuous phase) were created using a simple ‘one-step’ process where the oil phase (triglyceride oil and <b>polyglycerol</b> <b>polyricinoleate)</b> and the water phase (containing a combination of locust bean gum and carrageenan) were emulsified at an elevated temperature (70  °C) followed by cooling to room temperature.

Flowable to self-standing emulsion gels could be prepared by changing the total concentration of polymers (and the ratios of the individual polymers) as confirmed from low amplitude oscillatory shear rheology and creep recovery measurements. The cryo-scanning electron microscopy images of freeze-fractured emulsion samples revealed the presence of gelled inner water droplets. Further, when subjected to heating and cooling cycles, emulsions displayed reversible rheological changes which could be tuned by simply changing the total polymer concentration and the proportions of individual polymers.

It has several advantages over high energy and other low energy methods including, protecting sensitive compounds against severe conditions of high energy method and its ability to minimize surfactant, removal of cosurfactant and thermal stability compared with other low energy methods. In this study, we examined possibility of encapsulating highly soluble crocin in W/O micro-emulsions using spontaneous method which further could be used for making double emulsions. Nonionic surfactants of Span 80 and <b>polyglycerol</b> <b>polyricinoleate</b> (PGPR) were used for making micro-emulsions that showed the high potential of PGPR for spontaneous method. Surfactant to water ratio (SWR) was evaluated to find the highest amount of aqueous phase which can be dispersed in organic phase. Droplet size decreased by increasing SWR toward the SWR = 100 which had the smallest droplet size and then increased at higher levels of surfactant. By increasing SWR, shear viscosity increased which showed the high effect of PGPR on rheological properties.

40|$|A {{simple method}} for {{preparing}} gelled alginate beads with a diameter smaller than 5 µm is described. A 1 % alginate solution and a medium chain triglyceride (MCT) oil {{are used to}} prepare a water-in-oil (w/o) emulsion, stabilized by <b>polyglycerol</b> <b>polyricinoleate.</b> CaCl 2 nanoparticles with dimensions in the nano-range (6 – 400 nm), dispersed in MCT oil, are then added to the emulsion. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) show that these nanoparticles migrate to the emulsion droplet interface, where they dissolve into the aqueous alginate phase and cause gelation, forming beads. Gelation of the beads was confirmed with a novel technique using Congo red as an indicator. A color change occurs upon the addition of CaCl 2 to a Congo red solution and we believe {{this is due to}} formation of a Congo red–calcium complex. Scanning electron microscopy shows that alginate beads are mostly in a size range around 1 µm, but beads as small as 200 nm and smaller were also found. Extending the size range of alginate beads into the submicron range, while maintaining relatively mild pH conditions in the interior of the bead, will significantly extend the range of applications for this type of beads...|$|E

Globule size distribution was essentially monomodal with area-volume mean diameter (d) values ∼ 2  μm. Creaming along an 8  d refrigerated storage was always minor. The predominant elastic behavior in control samples evolved to viscous in samples with Verols. DSC revealed that V 10 and V 50 crystalized as α- and β′-polymorphs respectively, that can absorb at a W/O interface, potentially producing interfacial crystallization (V 10    V 50) concerning DEs stabilization because V 50 plus 3 or 6 % PGPR produced essentially glassy matrices, thus impeding Pickering effects. V 10 plus 3 or 6 % PGPR formed crystalline DEs with presence of lyotropic mesophases, which yielded W/O Pickering stabilization effects.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{contribute}} to the optimized production of water-in-oil emulsions with pumpkin seed oil in the oil phase using a high-speed homogenizer. Pumpkin seed oil is a valuable natural source of essential fatty acids and biologically active micronutrients that contribute to its nutritive value and medical uses, and reduce interfacial tension between water and the oil phases. Therefore, pumpkin seed oil can be considered as a prosperous oil phase whose use can possibly decrease the amount of some emulsifier that is normally involved in every emulsification process. A central composite rotatable experimental design was implemented to analyze the impact of the contents of <b>polyglycerol</b> <b>polyricinoleate</b> and pumpkin seed oil in the continuous phase, as well as water phase content in the emulsion on droplet size distribution and the response surface methodology was used to obtain optimal conditions for water-in-oil emulsion preparation.

40|$|Citral is a flavour {{component}} that {{is widely used}} in the beverage, food, and fragrance industries. Citral chemically degrades over time in aqueous solutions due to acid catalysed and oxidative reactions, leading to loss of desirable flavour {{and the formation of}} off-flavours.

The percentage of citral in the aqueous phase of the emulsions increased with increasing Tween 80 concentration, which was attributed to its incorporation within surfactant micelles. The rate of citral degradation decreased as the Tween 80 concentration was increased from 1 % to 5 % w/w in both aqueous solutions and in emulsions, suggesting that citral was protected from degradation once it was incorporated into micelles. The presence of reverse micelles (5 % or 10 % w/w PGPR) in the oil droplets decreased the percentage of citral present within the aqueous phase of the emulsions, suggesting that citral was preferentially incorporated into the reverse micelles. In addition, the presence of reverse micelles increased the chemical stability of citral, possibly because a greater fraction remained within the oil droplets. These results show that micelle or reverse-micelle structures may be used to improve the chemical stability of citral in beverage emulsions...|$|E
