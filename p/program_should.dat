25|$|The 8 LMQs {{have two}} key purposes. Firstly, {{they act as}} a ‘professional {{knowledge}} organiser’. This means the 8 LMQs enable the teacher to identify and then organise the fundamental consideration, or elements, required for the successful development and execution of learning experiences, units of work or individual lessons. For the student-teacher the 8LMQs act as a ‘knowledge organiser’ whereby essential professional knowledge, learnt {{as part of their}} preparation program, is organised such they have a bank of ‘considerations’ that they can call upon as they engage with each question. By this is meant the teacher education <b>program</b> <b>should</b> be presented so as to inform each LMQ. This has the effect of providing the student-teacher with a ‘ready-reference’ arrangement of knowledge that they can draw upon and unpack when designing and then executing successful learning experiences.|$|E
25|$|International {{experts have}} also {{weighed in on}} the controversies {{surrounding}} Brazil’s nuclear program. Hans Rühle, a former official from the German defense ministry who also worked with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) wrote an article in 2010 in which he indicated that Brazil {{might be on the}} path toward getting the bomb. He based his argument on the submarine project, which may involve the production of highly enriched uranium, and the fact that Brazil seeks to develop capacity to conduct all phases of the nuclear fuel cycle indigenously. While Rühle affirms that there is no hard proof of a nuclear weapons program in Brazil, he suggests that Brazil’s relations with Iran and defense of the Iranian nuclear <b>program</b> <b>should</b> be seen as a clue of the path Brazil wants to tread. Commenting on Rühle’s article, the Argentine scholars Federico Merke and Florencia Montal said that Brazil might develop the capacity to manufacture a bomb but that it didn’t seem to have the intention to do so.|$|E

25|$|Critics {{claim that}} the new 421-a program will cost city taxpayers {{even more than the}} old plan. The IBO found that the new 421-a plan would cost add $120 million per year, or $1.2 billion over ten years, to the overall cost of the program. This is {{compared}} to the old program that would have cost $7.2 billion over ten years. The Association for Neighborhood Housing and Development, an interest group that advocated for non-profits and affordable housing groups, claimed that the city needed that extra money to make up for expected cuts in federal funding to the city over the next year, and that luxury development companies should have to pay full taxes on the property, not get a deduction. Meanwhile, Democratic State Senator Gustavo Rivera claimed that the rents would not be low enough for residents in his Bronx state senate district {{to take advantage of the}} program. Senator Brad Hoylman stated that the dollars devoted to the 421-a <b>program</b> <b>should</b> instead go directly to creating affordable housing.|$|E
25|$|Therapy for Expressive Aphasia (nonfluent) is beneficial, {{even for}} {{patients}} with severe nonfluent aphasia. A study conducted by Marangolo and co-workers (2013) administered conversational therapy to patients with severe nonfluent aphasia. The {{results of the study}} demonstrated {{a significant increase in the}} patient’s expressive language. The authors suggested that an intensive conversational therapy <b>program</b> <b>should</b> be considered {{for patients with}} moderately severe nonfluent aphasia in order to enhance the patient's quality of life and improve their language expression. In addition, although Anomic Aphasia is seen to be less severe than other aphasias, therapy is still imperative to help decrease the patient’s word finding deficits. A research study conducted by Harnish and co-workers (2014), provided intense treatment to patients with anomic aphasia. Results of the study concluded significant increases in the participant’s expressive language. These results suggest that an intensive intervention program for patients with anomic aphasia provides a surprisingly quick expressive language increase. Specifically, these patients relearned to correctly produce the problematic words after one to three hours of speech-language therapy.|$|E

According to Choi Sung-ja, a member of the Intangible Cultural Heritage Subcommittee, the intangible {{cultural heritage}} <b>program</b> <b>should</b> not be tied exclusively to the existence of [...] "holders", and a less subjective selection process should be introduced.

Disappointed, Archer goes to the 602 Club, a local bar, bumping into Robinson there. Later, Robinson takes the scheduled flight aboard the NX Alpha, breaking the warp 2.0 barrier. He refuses a command from Forest to stop and instead increases speed; the craft soon destabilizes and is destroyed as it approaches warp 2.2, but Robinson escapes. The Vulcans argue that the warp <b>program</b> <b>should</b> be postponed, but Archer wants the program, and his father's engine research, to continue.

500|$|In {{addition}} to the various other amici, the United States filed a brief through the Solicitor General, as it may without leave of court under the Supreme Court's rules. [...] When consideration of [...] Bakke began in the new administration of President Jimmy Carter, early drafts of the brief both supported affirmative action and indicated that the <b>program</b> <b>should</b> be struck down and Bakke admitted. This stance reflected the mixed support of affirmative action at that time by the Democrats. Minorities and others in that party complained, and in late July 1977, Carter announced that the government's brief would firmly support affirmative action. [...] That document, filed October 3, 1977 (nine days before oral argument), stated that the government supported programs tailored {{to make up for}} past discrimination, but opposed rigid set-asides. [...] The United States urged the court to remand the case to allow for further fact-finding (a position also taken by civil rights groups in their amicus briefs).|$|E
500|$|The {{success of}} MA-8 made the {{preparation}} for MA-9 [...] "considerably easier", {{though it did}} cause some observers to suggest the <b>program</b> <b>should</b> be ended abruptly in order to conclude on a clear note of success, rather than risking another—potentially catastrophic—flight. However, {{this was not a}} view shared by the NASA planners, who had been pressing for a one-day Mercury mission since mid-1961, when it first began to seem technically feasible. To prepare the spacecraft for a long-duration mission involved trimming as much on-board weight as possible to offset the additional consumables required. The changes made to the capsule hardware on MA-8 were now used to justify the removal of [...] of control equipment and [...] of radio equipment, as well as the [...] periscope which Schirra had found so unhelpful. In total, there were 183 alterations listed between the capsules for the MA-8 and MA-9 missions. The spacecraft was to be equipped with several cameras, building on Schirra's photographic work, though weight and power limitations did restrict the amount of scientific experiments that could be scheduled.|$|E
500|$|The eighth {{season of}} The Office {{received}} mixed reviews. While some critics {{felt that the}} show was still humorous in its eighth year, many others argued that the <b>program</b> <b>should</b> have ended after the departure of Steve Carell. The A.V.

Alan Sepinwall of HitFix criticized Ed Helms' comedic performance as manager (calling him [...] "a softer version of Michael Scott"), {{as well as the}} toning down of Robert California from his appearance in the show's seventh season's finale, [...] "Search Committee". Sepinwall also expressed disappointment that many of the supporting characters were seemingly transformed into mere caricatures of their former selves. He stopped reviewing a majority of the Season 8 episodes since [...] "Pam's Replacement", due to his distaste for the series. Time writer James Poniewozik also criticized the choice of Andy as manager, instead arguing that Jim should have gotten the job so the series could have been more ensemble-oriented. New York named Andy Bernard one of the most annoying TV characters of 2011. Matt Zoller Seitz from New York wrote, [...] "Fact is, the show's first post–Steve Carell year has been a mess, at times bordering on a disaster", although he did write, [...] "Nevertheless, I still adore these characters, even when the writing doesn't do them justice." [...] McNutt gave the season a [...] "C" [...] grade overall, writing that the season finale, [...] "Free Family Portrait Studio" [...] was [...] "a disheartening conclusion to the show's worst season, offering little optimism to sustain our already dwindling enthusiasm over the summer months." ...|$|E
