50|$|Pamphiliidae (sometimes {{incorrectly}} spelled Pamphilidae) {{is a small}} wasp family within Symphyta, containing some 200 {{species from}} the temperate regions of North America and Eurasia. The larvae feed on plants (often conifers), using silk to either build webs or tents, or to roll leaves into tubes, in which they feed, thus earning them the common names leaf-rolling <b>sawflies</b> or <b>web-spinning</b> <b>sawflies.</b> They are distinguished from the closely related Megalodontesidae by their simple, filiform antennae.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} carbon and oxygen stable {{isotopes}} {{in conjunction with}} tree-ring chronologies to investigate the short-and long-term effects of the spruce <b>web-spinning</b> <b>sawfly</b> Cephalcia arvensis Panzer defoliation on Picea abies. We found massive growth loss and significantly different carbon and oxygen stable isotope patterns associated with insect feeding; while carbon isotope values increased, oxygen isotope values decreased in the defoliated trees. We also observed a difference in isotope composition between defoliated and control trees prior to the defoliation, indicating that some abiotic factors may have predisposed the trees to the insect attack. With respect to isotope theory, carbon and oxygen isotope patterns {{could be explained by}} both an increase in photosynthetic rate and a resort to starch reserves following insect feeding. Overall, these findings contribute to our understanding of how trees respond to insect attack. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The recent {{outbreaks}} (1986 - 1992) of the spruce <b>web-spinning</b> <b>sawfly</b> Cephalcia arvensis Panzer (Hymenoptera, Pamphiliidae) {{extended over}} 1500 ha of spruce (Picea abies Karst.) stands in two {{areas of the}} Venetian Pre-Alps (north-east Italy). Among the possible causes of these outbreaks, the climatic and pedological factors seem to predominate: (1) the period 1983 - 1986 showed a hot and dry climate in both areas, especially during the developmental time of the pest (June-July); (2) severe water stress occurred in the same years preceding the outbreaks; (3) inside each area the insect attack was irregularly distributed, reflecting the variability in soil and stand features. The relationships between climate and attack levels could be interpreted in two complementary ways: (1) lower mortality and faster development of the insect induced by favourable climatic conditions (high temperatures and lack of precipitations); (2) increase of food quality {{as a consequence of}} the water stress suffered by the trees, according to the soil and stand characteristics...|$|R
40|$|The {{life history}} of the spruce <b>web-spinning</b> <b>sawfly</b> Cephalcia arvensis has been studied from 1987 to 1991 in two {{outbreak}} areas of the Venetian Prealps. The populations of the pest are composed of individuals characterized by a different length of the life cycle, annual and biennial, the latter including {{in a few cases}} also triennial individuals. The two parts of the population differ as the emergence period, the distribution of the larvae (nymphs) in the soil, the fecundity and the weight of the mature larvae are considered. Longterm diapausing individuals seem to be heavier and more fertile than annual individuals; they are more deeply distributed in the soil and later in the emergence. These and other characteristics (adult behaviour, oviposition and egg features, larval feeding) are described and compared with those known in literature for other populations of the pest, with particular reference to the ''forms'' of C. arvensis recently described from Czechoslovakia...|$|R
30|$|Among the {{afforested}} lands, afforestation of <b>pine</b> <b>trees</b> and deciduous afforestation {{gained more}} from the losses in other LCTs. However, there were instances where deciduous afforestation also lost to afforestation of <b>pine</b> <b>trees</b> (Table  4). While other LUTs were changing to afforestation (mixed forest), afforestation often lost to afforestation of <b>pine</b> <b>trees</b> and deciduous tree afforestation. In Schlabendorf Nord, 23.81 ha and 15.69 ha of afforestation was replaced by afforestation of <b>pine</b> <b>trees</b> in the first segment and second segments.

In the first segment 97.05  ha of afforestation was replaced by afforestation of <b>pine</b> <b>trees</b> (Figures 6 and 8) in the last segment the coverage was 49.68  ha (Table  4).|$|R

40|$|The spruce <b>web-spinning</b> <b>sawflies</b> of {{the genus}} Cephalcia have been {{surveyed}} on two host plants (Picea Koraiensis and P. jezoensis) in both natural and artificial stands of north-eastern China. Ornamental trees were {{also included in the}} study. Five sites situated in the Provinces of Heilongjiang and Jilin and characterized by various elevations were considered in 1992 - 93. A total of nine species have been found, in the following decreasing order of abundance: C. abietis, C. arvensis (with two froms), C. fallenii, C. pallidula (new to China), C. alashanica, C. erythrogaster, C. fulva, C. klugii, and an unknown species. In most cases the adult specimens from China show a darker and more extended pigmentation with respect to the European ones. Some biological attributes (emergence period of adults, oviposition features, larval instars and feeding habits) are given for each species and compared with those known from European populations. A key for the practical identification of prepupae is presented. All information could be useful in monitoring, since these sawflies are considered among the main pests of various spruce species in this region...|$|R
