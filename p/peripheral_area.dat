25|$|With dense {{indigenous}} Maya populations, Yucatán's encomienda {{system was}} established early and persisted {{far longer than}} in central Mexico, since fewer Spaniards migrated to the region than in the center. Although Yucatán was a more <b>peripheral</b> <b>area</b> to the colony, since it lacked rich mining areas and no agricultural or other export product, it did have complex of Spanish settlement, with {{a whole range of}} social types in the main settlements of Mérida and the villas of Campeche and Valladolid. There was an important sector of mixed-race castas, some of whom were fully at home in both the indigenous and Hispanic worlds. Blacks were an important component of Yucatecan society. The largest population in the province was indigenous Maya, who lived in their communities, but which were in contact with the Hispanic sphere via labor demands and commerce.|$|E
25|$|The first {{reproduction}} occurs {{after one}} year. Spawning is {{triggered by the}} first rains and occurs in the warm and rainy season. As a callichthyine, it builds a bubble nest; among callichthyines, this species {{is reported to have}} the most complex nest structure. This dome-shaped nest is rich with oxygen; in the hypoxic water conditions of tropical swamps, the main function of the bubble nest appears to be to provide oxygen to the developing eggs by lifting the eggs above the water surface while protecting them from desiccation. It may also serve to protect the brood against predators, regulate temperature, identify the center of the male's territory, and to synchronize reproductive activities. Nest-building activities usually lasted from 1,000 to 1,500 hours, but only on clear and warm days, particularly during the hottest hours. These activities are also reported to occur at night. Most nests are built in newly flooded swamps, especially in open water in the <b>peripheral</b> <b>area</b> of the swamp. A minimum distance of 10metres between nests is observed. The nest is the centre of a territory that is vigorously defended by the male, using its enlarged pectoral spines. The diameter and height of the nest average 30 and 6cm (12 and 2.36in), respectively.|$|E
2500|$|McConkie's and Currie's saccade {{target theory}} {{is similar to}} {{research}} by Schneider {{who came up with}} a similar [...] "reference object theory". Both theories hypothesize that each saccade is preceded by processes in the visual system that chose an object as the target for the next fixation point. The object is usually located in peripheral vision. The object's features are stored as a mental representation in transsaccadic memory for identification of future fixations. These target features are searched for by the visual system when the eye lands on its fixation point, and [...] the physical features are compared to the mental representation of the target object. The theory assumes that visual stability is attained when these processes are successful (when the visual stimuli and the mental representation of the target object match). This process occurs before each saccade. Experiments performed by McConkie to support the role of a saccadic target in transsaccadic memory show two things: first, there is a limited <b>peripheral</b> <b>area</b> where a saccadic target exists, and second, attention is vital in recollection of items in the target area. The experiments involved recalling changes to an image that occurred in the <b>peripheral</b> <b>area.</b> Irwin performed similar experiments in which participants recalled letters that occurred near the target area. Due to confounding factors of the controlled environment in the studies, the involvement of saccade target objects is inferred and not established.|$|E

A matching fund program for 15 million employees was also introduced, which stimulated them to accumulate capital.|$|E

Sponsorship: EU Interreg IIc project 'Marine Ecotourism for the Atlantic Area (META-) 'Embedded in the ecotourism concept is 'marine ecotourism': ecotourism {{that takes place}} in marine and coastal environments. Much marine ecotourism activity occurs in parts of the world that would be considered 'peripheral' in spatial, temporal and economic terms; yet to date no one has attempted to draw together the concepts of marine ecotourism and peripherality. In particular, why might marine ecotourism be considered an especially appropriate strategy for coastal <b>peripheral</b> <b>areas?</b> This paper introduces the concept of ecotourism in the marine and coastal context. It then examines what is meant by the term 'peripherality' and outlines some of the challenges and opportunities it can bring to coastal locations. A particular focus is on the EU's main policy responses to the peripherality dimension of its regional 'problem'.

40|$|The areas located outside {{metropolitan}} areas and also outside areas activated through other big cities are called peripheries. There are big {{differences between the}} levels of development of metropolitan and <b>peripheral</b> <b>areas</b> in Poland. There are also great differences in opportunities to development including the location of new investment. <b>Peripheral</b> <b>areas</b> are characterized by features such as: high unemployment, relatively impoverished populations, low productivity, low territorial accessibility, small development potential. Lack of development factors {{is the cause of}} low development level. <b>Peripheral</b> <b>areas</b> are differential. The author analyses this differentiation, including location of development factors in <b>peripheral</b> <b>areas</b> of northern Poland. Touristic values are such factor, but tourism is mainly seasonal. The tourist season is short, 2 - 4 months. The development of this tourism increases the income of people and business, but the increase of permanent work-places is small. The lack of robust businesses that are able to start constant and stable development {{is one of the main}} weakness of <b>peripheral</b> <b>areas.</b> Bed transport accessibility is the other weakness of <b>peripheral</b> <b>areas.</b> As one of the factors of socio-economic development considered by author is the spatial structure, including settlement network. In some areas lack of appropriately big node could be the weakness of such network. The analysis of case study area is conducted on the basis of the features of poviats (counties), which are described by following indicators: employees in the industry sector and market service sector per 1000 population of working age, number of entities in national economy between 10 - 49 and more than 49 workers per 1000 population of working age, investment outlays in enterprises per capita in the years 2008 - 2010, gross value of fixed assets in enterprises per capita, average monthly gross wages and salaries, unemployment rate, participation of the urban population, population of the biggest settlement node.
