As Vietnam is a single-party state led by the Vietnamese Communist Party, the VNQDD is illegal.

40|$|This study explores how senior {{executives}} affect firms' propensity {{to engage in}} <b>political</b> <b>activity.</b> I propose that firms' participation {{in the political process}} depends on their {{senior executives}}' involvement in <b>political</b> <b>activity.</b> I examine this framework using data on the campaign contributions of 151 U.

40|$|The {{association}} between corporate <b>political</b> <b>activity</b> and firm performance is contested. Considering both potential {{costs and benefits}} we {{examine the relationship between}} corporate <b>political</b> <b>activity</b> and firm performance by explicating the moderating effects of product and international diversification. The idea is that corporate <b>political</b> <b>activity</b> facilitates expansion into new product and international markets and hence justifies the costs occurred. Our results based on a sample of 737 U. S. -based firms show that corporate <b>political</b> <b>activity</b> is positively associated with performance for firms that are diversified in both international markets and along product-lines; whereas <b>political</b> <b>activity</b> is counter-productive for purely domestic and undiversified firms. Our results contribute to the literature on the nonmarket behaviour of firms by highlighting the roles of international and product diversification...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} of <b>political</b> <b>activity</b> to the Westminster constitution might {{give rise to}} two understandings: either <b>political</b> <b>activity</b> operates within or is unbounded {{by the absence of}} a constitution.

By inviting a study of the Westminster constitution centred on the many relationships between constitutional actors, <b>political</b> <b>activity</b> is understood not as within or without, but as the constitution...|$|R
5|$|Aymer Vallance was {{commissioned}} {{to produce the}} first biography of Morris, published in 1897, after Morris' death, as per the latter's wishes. This presented the creation of SPAB as Morris' greatest achievement. Morris's next biographer was Burne-Jones' son-in-law John William Mackail, who authored the two-volume Life of William Morris (1899) in which he provided a sympathetic portrayal of Morris that largely omitted his <b>political</b> <b>activities,</b> treating them as a passing phase that Morris overcame.|$|E

40|$|This article adds to extant {{literature}} {{by examining the}} contingent effect of two cross-functional processes {{on the relationship between}} the use of an innovation strategy and firm performance, namely, task conflict and <b>political</b> <b>activity.</b> The authors examine the effects of these processes with a sample of 260 firms. The positive relationship between the use of an innovation strategy and firm performance is stronger for higher levels of cross-functional task conflict and lower levels of cross-functional <b>political</b> <b>activity.</b> Furthermore, the authors find support for a configurational hypothesis: the innovation strategy-firm performance relationship is strongest for the high task conflict/low <b>political</b> <b>activity</b> configuration and weakest for the low task conflict/high <b>political</b> <b>activity</b> configuration. The results unveil two important cross-functional mechanisms influencing {{the extent to which the}} benefits of an innovation strategy can be reaped.

40|$|The article {{considers}} the correct tax treatment of organized <b>political</b> <b>activity</b> by {{the tax system}} and discusses the problems that have arisen from <b>political</b> <b>activity</b> {{depending on whether the}} organization is a charity, a noncharitable exempt, or a political organization. The article then examines administrative and legislative options to the problems raised by <b>political</b> <b>activity.</b> Quantum-based solutions to the problem of <b>political</b> <b>activity</b> by noncharitable exempts do not provide a clear advantage over present law. Formally quantifying the “primarily” test would result in more certainty, but would also require that the Service be more, not less, involved in the regulation of <b>political</b> <b>activity.</b> If the policy goal is to curb <b>political</b> <b>activity</b> by noncharitable exempts, changing the test from “primarily” to something more restrictive like “substantially” or “exclusively” would be effective, but would create new categories of taxable nonprofits that are treated worse than political organizations for engaging in less <b>political</b> <b>activity,</b> which is irrational. Further, it is not clear, especially after the Citizens United decision, why as a matter of tax exemption the regulations decree that <b>political</b> <b>activity</b> may not further noncharitable exempt purposes. Before Citizens United, the <b>political</b> <b>activity</b> limits were not especially relevant, but at least helped to differentiate organization types. However, Citizens United largely rendered existing tax law limitations obsolete by making a new kind of multi-purpose organization possible. As a result, definitional <b>political</b> <b>activity</b> limits are no longer justified and should be eliminated, but only if the 527 (f) tax on investment income remains vital and the differences in the disclosure regimes between political organizations and noncharitable exempts are erased. In addition, Congress should affirm that the gift tax does not apply with respect to political contributions, but also extend the income tax to transfers of appreciated property to noncharitable exempts. Further, Congress should acknowledge that the increase in political speech by noncharitable exempts will lead to abuse of charitable organizations, and take steps to prevent the laundering of independent expenditures through the charitable form. Congress also should recognize that Citizens United has led to a need to develop a new tax baseline for <b>political</b> <b>activity</b> conducted “for profit” or outside of section 527...|$|R

40|$|This study {{explores the}} impact of {{publicly}} traded founding family firms (FFFs) on their propensity for corporate <b>political</b> <b>activity</b> (CPA) and their choice of political approaches. Based on the behavior and characteristics of publicly traded FFFs, the author expected a positive association between FFFs and corporate <b>political</b> <b>activity</b> and a preference for relational, or long-term, over transactional, or short-term, corporate <b>political</b> <b>activity.</b> It was found that publicly traded FFFs {{are more likely to}} engage in CPA only when the firm’s founder is in an executive position. Furthermore, publicly traded FFFs show a preference for relational versus transactional corporate <b>political</b> <b>activity.</b> These findings are examined in light of FFF and corporate political strategy literatures...|$|R
40|$|Although {{significant}} {{scholarship has}} been devoted to the study of corporate <b>political</b> <b>activity,</b> contradictory messages emerge regarding its impact on public policy outcomes and firm performance. Using meta-analytic methods on a US-only sample of 93 studies, working papers, and books, we try to disentangle two mechanisms that explain why corporate <b>political</b> <b>activity</b> is not always beneficial to firms: (1) the uncertainty about the public policy process itself, that is, can firms get the policies they want through corporate <b>political</b> <b>activity?</b> and (2) the uncertainty about the policies’ impact on the firm, that is, whether firms effectively anticipate the implications of policies for their performance. Our results support the idea that these types of uncertainty {{play an important role in}} explaining the intermediary dynamics of corporate <b>political</b> <b>activity.</b> We find that in the United States, corporate <b>political</b> <b>activity</b> only weakly impacts public policy and at best has a (direct) weak effect on corporate outcomes...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{extensive}} research on <b>political</b> <b>activity</b> {{on the part}} of corporations, clear and consistent findings remain elusive. We identify three reasons for this failure. First, most of the empirical literature on corporate <b>political</b> <b>activity</b> simply studies the wrong phenomena by examining political action committees rather than lobbying more generally. Second, the literature studies an excessively narrow sample of organizations that might engage in lobbying, focusing almost always on extremely large corporations, which inevitably attenuates variance on many of the variables hypothesized to influence engagement in <b>political</b> <b>activity.</b> And third, prior work is rarely attentive to the diversity of corporate activities, narrowly conceptualizing vital aspects of the business context that might influence decisions to engage in <b>political</b> <b>activity.</b> Based on this critique, we develop and test new models of corporate <b>political</b> <b>activity,</b> finding that the diversity of the economic context within which firms work and firm size matter a great deal, if in ways somewhat different from those reported in prior work. ...|$|R

At Cambridge he embraced socialism, and believed that scientists had a moral responsibility to society, one that included fighting fascism.|$|E

5|$|Evans {{sought to}} promote a form of nativist, Protestant nationalism. In {{addition}} to his white supremacist ideology, he fiercely condemned Catholicism, unionism, and communism, which were associated with recent immigrants from eastern and southern Europe. He argued that Jews formed a non-American culture and resisted assimilation, although he denied being an anti-Semite. Historians credit Evans with refocusing the Klan on <b>political</b> <b>activities</b> and recruiting outside the Southern United States; the Klan grew most in the Midwest and industrial cities. However, they note that the political influence and membership gains he sought were transitory. Some commentators argue that Evans was more focused on money and power than any particular ideology.|$|E
5|$|He {{was elected}} a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1965. After 1968, his <b>political</b> <b>activities</b> were {{centered}} on the PLP. The Harvard administration considered these activities disruptive and attempted to censure Putnam, but two other faculty members criticized the procedures. Putnam permanently severed his ties with the PLP in 1972. In 1997, {{at a meeting of}} former draft resistance activists at Arlington Street Church in Boston, Putnam described his involvement with the PLP as a mistake. He said that he had been impressed at first with the PLP's commitment to alliance-building and its willingness to attempt to organize from within the armed forces.|$|E
5|$|His {{social and}} <b>political</b> <b>activities</b> {{resulted}} in a diminished literary output. He wrote a new historical novel, Na polu chwały (On the Field of Glory), that was meant {{as the beginning of}} a new trilogy; it was, however, criticized as being a lesser version of his original Trilogy, and was never continued. Similarly, his contemporary novel Wiry Whirlpool (novel), 1910, which sought to criticize some of Sienkiewicz's political opponents, received a mostly polemical and politicized response. His 1910 novel for young people, W pustyni i w puszczy (In Desert and Wilderness), serialized in Kurier Warszawski (The Warsaw Courier), finishing in 1911, was much better received and became widely popular among children and young adults.|$|E

5|$|In 1989, the {{government}} of the Socialist Republic of Croatia decided to tolerate political parties in response to growing demands to allow <b>political</b> <b>activities</b> outside the Communist party. The first political party founded in Croatia {{since the beginning of the}} Communist rule was the Croatian Social Liberal Party (HSLS), established on 20 May 1989, followed by the Croatian Democratic Union on 17 June 1989. In December 1989, Ivica Račan became the head of the reformed Communist party. At the same time, the party cancelled political trials, released political prisoners and endorsed a multi-party political system. The Civil Organisations Act was formally amended to allow political parties on 11 January 1990, legalising the parties that were already founded.|$|E
