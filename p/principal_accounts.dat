5|$|Abu Nuwar's enmity with Glubb Pasha, the Arab Legion's {{powerful}} British {{chief of}} staff, his insistence on establishing Arab command over {{the army and}} his influence with Hussein led the latter to dismiss Glubb Pasha and appoint Abu Nuwar in his place. However, Abu Nuwar's ardent support for the pan-Arabist policies of Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser contributed to Jordan's increasing isolation from the UK and the US, which were major sources of foreign aid to Jordan. At the same time, existing dissatisfaction with Abu Nuwar's leadership by palace officials and veteran Bedouin army units culminated into violent confrontations at the large army barracks in Zarqa between royalist and Arab nationalist units. Two <b>principal</b> <b>accounts</b> emerged regarding the events at Zarqa, with the royalist version holding that the incident was an abortive coup by Abu Nuwar against Hussein, and the dissident version asserting {{that it was a}} staged, American-backed counter-coup by Hussein against the pan-Arabist movement in Jordan.

25|$|Disagreements {{between the}} monarchy and the leftist {{government}} culminated in March 1957 when Nabulsi provided Hussein {{with a list}} of senior officers in the military he wanted to dismiss; Hussein initially heeded the recommendations, but then Nabulsi presented a new list, which Hussein refused to act upon. Nabulsi's government was forced to resign on 10April. On 13April, rioting broke in the Zarqa army barracks and the 21 year-old Hussein went to end the violence between royalist and Arab nationalist army units after the latter group spread rumors that the King had been killed. A 3,000-man Syrian force started moving south in support of what they perceived as a coup attempt, but turned around after the army units showed their loyalty to the King. Two <b>principal</b> <b>accounts</b> emerged regarding the events at Zarqa, with the royalist version holding that the incident was an abortive coup by army chief of staff Ali Abu Nuwar against King Hussein, and the dissident version asserting that it was a staged, American-backed counter-coup by Hussein against the pan-Arabist movement in Jordan. In any case, Abu Nuwar and other senior Arabist officers resigned and were allowed to leave Jordan for Syria, where they incited opposition to the Jordanian monarchy. Hussein imposed martial law and disbanded Palestinian-dominated military units after the incident. Although he eventually relaxed some of these measures, namely military curfews and severe press censorship, Hussein's moves significantly curtailed the constitutional democracy that existed in Jordan in the mid-1950s. The alleged conspirators were sentenced to 15 years in absentia, but later on were pardoned by Hussein in 1964 as part of his reconciliation efforts with his exiled opposition, and were given senior posts in the government.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} the incentive effects of corporate taxes in an agency setting with a principal facing an investment opportunity including an abandonment option. We are {{particularly interested in}} the interplay of taxation and the real option on the principal's incentives to motivate the agent to work hard. First, we extend the well-known studies on tax effects on decision making under uncertainty to moral hazard settings. In a benchmark case we find that, as confirmed in current literature, the corporate income tax has no incentive effect. If the <b>principal</b> <b>accounts</b> for the real option we show that paradoxical tax effects may occur. Also, with respect to the effect of the real option on the incentive problem we show that the option makes it less attractive for the principal to induce the agent to exert a high effort...|$|E

Part II develops an explanatory model of domestic violence based upon these key elements.

40|$|The events {{triggered}} by defaults on 2 ̆ 7 sub-prime 2 ̆ 7 mortgages {{have been widely}} described as constituting a 2 ̆ 7 crisis 2 ̆ 7. But a crisis of what exactly? Several different explanations of the 20 month drama that unfolded from summer 2007 have been proposed by {{a wide range of}} commentators. These include journalists, academics, politicians, business-people, pundits and public administrators, among others. This essay parses this superfluity of crisis talk into five <b>principal</b> <b>accounts.</b> It focuses on the Anglo-American scene. The interpretations presented range from the simplistic and populist to the complex and specialised. They are compared and contrasted, and in each case their diverse normative implications are sketched. As a Marxist, I argue that the fifth interpretation - which speaks to macro-economic imbalances and asymmetries of class power - is the most compelling. But I also argue that each of the other interpretations can be narrated and politicised {{in such a way as}} to advance Left arguments for far-reaching socio-economic reform. Yet, this fact notwithstanding, the Left - by which I mean those positioned left of both New Labour and the Democrats - has so far failed to use the recent crisis to its political advantage. This, I suggest, is a sign of its long-standing marginality in Britain and the US - a marginality so entrenched that even an acute economic crisis has been unable to alter it. This crisis thus reveals a seeming paradox: the continued strength of neoliberal capitalism despite itself...|$|E
40|$|Subverting the {{expectation}} that expo pavilions incorporate recognizable markers of national identity, the Australian pavilion at the 1970 Japan World Exposition, Osaka, was conceived around a set of direct and oblique references to Japanese culture. The exposition’s Japanese audience {{was the target of}} architect James Maccormick’s ‘East-West’ approach to design, which sought to enhance Japanese opinions of Australia and Australians. Working from briefing papers prepared by the Department of External Affairs, Maccormick used references to Japanese culture to address perceived Japanese perceptions of Australians as ‘coarse’ and ‘uncultured’. The pavilion’s ambitious engineering tackled the Japanese view of Australia as under-industrialized. These themes coalesced {{in the design of the}} pavilion’s canopy roof. Shaped from Australian steel as a stylized lotus and suspended from a giant cantilever arm, its hovering form appealed to purported Japanese interest in mastery over nature while showing what Australia could do with its natural resources. Drawing on archival research and secondary sources, the paper argues that the design of the Osaka pavilion bypassed the usual renderings of Australian national identity based in rural enterprise and nature imagery to demonstrate a new, pragmatic approach to national representation open to recurrent reconstruction according to changing contexts and circumstances. In referencing Japanese culture, the pavilion’s design not only highlights Japan’s growing economic and strategic importance to Australia but marks an important change in Australia’s outlook on its inter-societal relations in the Asia-Pacific region. Despite the significance of these shifts neither the pavilion design nor Australia’s participation in Osaka is discussed in the <b>principal</b> <b>accounts</b> of relations between Australia and Japan in the twentieth century...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{a study of the}} pageantry and {{entertainments}} which took place in 1608 on the occasion of three aristocratic marriages, those of Princesses Margherita and Isabella of Savoy to Francesco Gonzaga of Mantua and Alfonso d'Este of Modena and of Maria Maddalena of Austria to Cosimo II de' Medici of Tuscany. Volume I comprises: a brief survey of the political situation in northern Italy in 1608, including the marriage negotiations between savoy, Mantua and Modena; a discussion of attitudes to women current in the Renaissance as reflected in marriage pageantry; a full account of the pageantry and entertainments celebrating these marriages, drawing on archival material and contemporary published descriptions; a discussion of the interpretation of pageantry, the response of the spectators, and pageantry's value as political propaganda and as a means of promoting and spreading artistic development. Volume II is an edited collection (in Italian and French) of the relevant documents from Italian state archives and full transcriptions of the three <b>principal</b> <b>accounts</b> published in 1608. The thesis concludes that there is a close relationship between political changes and developments in pageantry. The rise of absolutism as the dominant form of government in Italy {{at the end of the}} sixteenth century is parallelled by the glorification of the ruler in pageantry. The stability and prosperity of the state come to be identified with the security and strength of the ruler. The thesis offers a new approach to the role of women in Renaissance politics and society through examination of marriage pageantry. Women are represented as counsellors and mediators, rarely taking action, but promoting peace and, through their role as mothers of future heirs, ensuring stability and prosperity in the state...|$|E
40|$|In the 212 text {{pages of}} Changing Ones, Roscoe {{demonstrates}} his storytelling abilities as he reweaves previously published papers with a canonical polemic that deeply engages {{his own and}} others 2 ̆ 7 writings about purported Native American sexuality, sex, and gender definitions and practices. In presenting his analysis of select writings on 2 ̆ 2 berdache, 2 ̆ 2 he generously acknowledges those who have become his adversaries by painstakingly replaying those authors 2 ̆ 7 points of view against his own interpretations. For example, {{in the field of}} sexuality studies, Roscoe 2 ̆ 7 s disagreement with Ram 6 n Gutierrez (2 ̆ 2 Must We Deracinate Indians to Find Gay Roots? 2 ̆ 2 Out/Look [Winter 1989]) and Richard Trexler (Sex and Conquest: Gender Construction and Political Order at the Time of the European Conquest of the Americas, 1995) is well known, but for the sake of those who do not follow such studies, he reprises his previously published arguments point-by-point. His disagreements with specific feminist theories and their leading scholars, published originally in 1994, are elaborated here in several chapters, each a nominal revision of previously published papers. In presenting revisions of his earlier writings, Roscoe maintains the core theories he has espoused since his work with Gay American Indians of San Francisco (Living the Spirit: A Gay American Indian Anthology, 1988). Indeed, in this new book, his first chapter carries nearly the same title as his theoretical essay in Living the Spirit: 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 Strange Country This 2 ̆ 7 : An Introduction to North American Gender Diversity 2 ̆ 2 (1998); 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 Strange Country This 2 ̆ 7 : Images of Berdaches and Warrior Women 2 ̆ 2 (1988). The stories about women told in the 1988 work are retold here in Chapter Four, 2 ̆ 2 Warrior Women and Women Chiefs: Alternative Identities and Genders for Native Women, 2 ̆ 2 which contains the <b>principal</b> <b>accounts</b> of Plains cultural examples. The strength of this work is its gathering together writings by a serious scholar of American Indian cultures who was the first to bring Native voices to the conversations about homosexuality, sex role transformations, and gender diversity. A steadfast ally of those who founded and expanded the work of Gay American Indians, he has extended his own involvement in their causes outside the Bay area. Having his writings brought together in an accessible book, along with a greatly expanded versions of his 1987 2 ̆ 2 Bibliography of Berdache and Alternative Gender Roles Among North American Indians, 2 ̆ 2 increases the work 2 ̆ 7 s value. Although little about Plains culture is included, the references made are useful, and overall the volume is well worth a thorough reading...|$|E
