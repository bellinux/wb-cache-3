IgG anti-matrix metalloproteinase- 1 autoantibody levels were significantly higher in patients with diffuse cutaneous <b>systemic</b> <b>sclerosis</b> than those found in patients with limited cutaneous <b>systemic</b> <b>sclerosis.</b> Furthermore, IgG anti-matrix metalloproteinase- 1 antibody levels significantly correlated with the extent of fibrosis in the skin, lung, and renal blood vessels.
