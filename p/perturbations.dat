5|$|Because their {{elliptical}} orbits frequently {{take them}} {{close to the}} giant planets, comets are subject to further gravitational <b>perturbations.</b> Short-period comets have a tendency for their aphelia to coincide with a giant planet's semi-major axis, with the JFCs being the largest group. It is clear that comets {{coming in from the}} Oort cloud often have their orbits strongly influenced by the gravity of giant planets {{as a result of a}} close encounter. Jupiter is the source of the greatest <b>perturbations,</b> being more than twice as massive as all the other planets combined.

5|$|The 4:1 orbital {{resonance}} with Jupiter, at a radius 2.06AU, can {{be considered}} the inner boundary of the asteroid belt. <b>Perturbations</b> by Jupiter send bodies straying there into unstable orbits.

5|$|The {{explanation}} of this instability {{begins with the}} existence of tiny <b>perturbations</b> in the stream. These are always present, no matter how smooth the stream is. If the <b>perturbations</b> are resolved into sinusoidal components, we find that some components grow with time while others decay with time. Among those that grow with time, some grow at faster rates than others. Whether a component decays or grows, and how fast it grows is entirely a function of its wave number (a measure of how many peaks and troughs per centimeter) and the radii of the original cylindrical stream.|$|E

40|$|Data <b>perturbation</b> is {{a popular}} {{technique}} for privacypreserving data mining. The major challenge of data <b>perturbation</b> is balancing privacy protection and data quality, which are normally considered {{as a pair of}} contradictive factors. We propose that selectively preserving only the task/model specific information in <b>perturbation</b> would improve the balance. Geometric data <b>perturbation,</b> consisting of random rotation <b>perturbation,</b> random translation <b>perturbation,</b> and noise addition, aims at preserving the important geometric properties of a multidimensional dataset, while providing better privacy guarantee for data classification modeling. The preliminary study has shown that random geometric <b>perturbation</b> can well preserve model accuracy for several popular classification models, including kernel methods, linear classifiers, and SVM classifiers, while it also revealed some security concerns to random geometric <b>perturbation.</b> In this paper, we address some potential attacks to random geometric <b>perturbation</b> and design several methods to reduce the threat of these attacks.
