5000|$|In Europe {{since the}} late 1840s, the king of Sardinia, Carlo Alberto, had been contemplating the {{excavation}} of a 12 km tunnel through Mount Fréjus to create a rail link between Italy and France, which would cross his realm. [...] The need for a mechanical rock drill was obvious and this sparked research on pneumatic rock drills in Europe. A Frenchman, Cavé, designed, and in 1851 patented, a rock drill that used compressed air; but the air had to be admitted manually to the cylinder during each stroke, {{so it was not}} successful. [...] In 1854, in England, Thomas Bartlett made and then patented (1855) a rock drill whose drill bit was connected directly to the piston of a steam engine. In 1855 Bartlett demonstrated his drill, powered by compressed air, to officials of the Mt. Fréjus tunnel project. [...] (In 1855, a German, Schumann, invented a similar <b>pneumatic</b> <b>rock</b> <b>drill</b> in Freiburg, Germany.) Bartlett’s drill was refined by the Savoy-born engineer Germain Sommeiller (1815-1871) and his colleagues, Grandis and Grattoni, by 1861. [...] Thereafter, many inventors refined the pneumatic drill.|$|E
40|$|Experimental {{modifications}} {{have been}} made by the Bureau of Mines on standard <b>pneumatic</b> <b>rock</b> <b>drills</b> to reduce the noise of the air exhaust, drill steel resonance noise, and noise radiated by the drill body. A close-fitting case and muffler around the drill body, consisting of a metallic honeycomb skeleton filled with viscoelastic absorber on the inside and a durable outer shell, provide both exhaust and drill body noise muff ling and absorption. Drill steel resonance noise is reduced by a constrained-layer treatment consisting of a tubular metal cover bonded to the ouside of the sod by a viscoelastic filler. Damping alloy components have been developed to reduce metallic resonance noise. Combined, these modifications have reduced the drilling noise level in granite from 115 dbA to 97 dbA. Data are presented on the individual and combined effects of these modifications on drilling noise and performance...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of springy impact interface and of curved drill rods on energy transfer in percussive <b>rock</b> <b>drilling</b> was studied. Analytical models for <b>pneumatic</b> and hydraulic <b>rock</b> <b>drills</b> were introduced, {{in which the}} springy piston-rod impact interface was taken into account. A nonlinear model for the springy impact interface was also implemented in a computer simulation program for percussive <b>rock</b> <b>drilling</b> systems. Laboratory tests were performed and the experimental results were compared with the results by three theoretical models. The agreement between theoretical and experimental incident stress waves {{was found to be}} satisfactory. The factors affecting the <b>rock</b> <b>drilling</b> efficiency were analysed. For the hydraulic <b>rock</b> <b>drills</b> investigated, it was found that a springy impact interface slightly decreases the <b>drilling</b> efficiency. For <b>pneumatic</b> <b>rock</b> <b>drills,</b> however, the analysis showed that an appropriate springy impact interface might increase the drilling efficiency significantly. The reflection and transmission of harmonic stress waves at a constant curvature bend of an ilifinite uniform bar was analysed theoretically. The energy fluxes of the reflected and transmitted extensional and flexural waves were obtained for an incident wave which may be either extensional or flexural. Results are shown in polar radiation diagrams for an incident extensional wave. It was found that for bends of small angles, the radius of curvature has little effect on the transmission of extensional stress waves and a significant amount of extensional wave energy is transmitted through the bends. Furthermore, the efficiency of percussive <b>rock</b> <b>drilling</b> with a bent drill rod was investigated using a combined approach of FFT and matrix method. In percussive <b>rock</b> <b>drilling</b> with slightly bent rods (bend angle up to 100), {{it was found that the}} efficiency is practically the same as with straight rods. It was also found that the efficiency can remain high even if the rod is significantly bent (bend angle up to 30 °). Godkänd; 1993; 20070429 (ysko...|$|R

40|$|Vibration {{isolation}} is a procedure {{through which the}} transmission of oscillating disturbances or forces is reduced. The ideal isolator is one that will support the equipment being isolated without transmitting any dynamic forces. An isolator with infinite static stiffness and zero dynamic stiffness will achieve this goal. Although this ideal isolation cannot be obtained in practice, it can be approximated through {{a wide range of}} devices. This approximation occurs over a limited frequency band and methods of increasing this band were investigated. The goal of this thesis was to further our understanding of mechanical systems that can approximate the ideal isolator behaviour. To compare the various devices the blocked transfer dynamic stiffness was defined. This value was found to represent the isolator properties without the additional complication of the equipment being isolated as happens in traditional transmissibility methods. Three classes of devices were distinguished namely isolators, vibration-absorbing isolators (VAl) and amplified vibration-absorbing isolators (AVAI). The last two types exploit nodalisation to reduce the dynamic stiffness over a limited frequency range. The focus of this work is the broadening of the effective low stiffness bandwidth of amplified vibration-absorbing isolators by adapting system characteristics. If the excitation is tonal time-varying these devices can be used successfully. Two novel adaptive amplified vibration-absorbing isolators were introduced and studied in the time and frequency domains. The type I AVAI uses flexible reservoir walls to vary the isolation frequency. The type II device incorporates a heavy metal slug. Both devices use variable pressure air springs to change their stiffness. The use of air springs are convenient, offers low damping and can be used in an application such as a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>rock</b> <b>drill</b> handle to eliminate the need for a control system. Conceptual design methodologies for both damped and un-damped fixed and adaptive isolation frequency AVAls are presented. To determine the effects of tuning the equations were transformed in terms of constant frequency ratios and the variable stiffness ratio. The devices can be controlled using an optimisation approach, but care should be taken since the method could be unsuccessful in some cases. The design was then applied to a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>rock</b> <b>drill.</b> This application was particularly demanding because the stiffness had to be large enough for the operator to remain in control of the drill, yet low enough to offer isolation. Extensive measurements of drill vibration at a test facility found that the maximum acceleration values were 18. 72 m/s 2. The maximum allowed under the proposed European Union legislation is 10 m/s 2 for short durations. The excitation consisted of a large tonal component and wide-band noise. The tonal component contributed ~ 50 % of the total weighted equivalent acceleration experienced by the operator and a vibration absorbing isolator should therefore be an ideal solution. The measurements also showed that the excitation frequency {{is a function of the}} supply air pressure. By using the supply air pressure to feed the air spring the device could be made self-¬tuning. Numerical simulation showed that there is only a slight difference between using the supply pressure and forcing coincidence of the excitation and isolation frequencies. It was also found that the vibration levels could be reduced to below 10 m/s 2 in some cases. Thesis (PhD (Mechanical Engineering)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2006.

40|$|The {{relevance}} of the research {{is due to the}} necessity to create <b>pneumatic</b> <b>rock</b> <b>drills</b> with low air consumption. The article analyzes the reasons for low efficiency of percussive machines. The authors state that applying a single distribution body in the percussive mechanism does not allow carrying out a low-energy operating cycle of the mechanism. Using the studied device as an example, it is substantiated that applying a compression valve with two distribution bodies separately operating the working chambers makes it possible to significantly reduce the airflow. The authors describe the construction of a core drill percussive mechanism and the operation of a compression valve. It is shown that in the new percussive mechanism working chambers are cut off the circuit by the time when exhaust windows are opened by the piston and air is not supplied into the cylinder up to 20 % of the cycle time. The air flow rate of the new mechanism was 3. 8 m 3 /min. In comparison with the drill PK- 75, the overall noise level of the new machine is lower by 8 - 10 dB, while the percussive mechanism efficiency is 2. 3 times higher...|$|R

All hand-held machines transmit vibrations to our hands while {{we are working with}} them [3]. Vibrations consist of a reciprocal motion in handles which arises when a number of forces with varying directions and magnitude influence the machine and set it in motion. Work with intensely vibrating machines {{for a long period of}} time may give rise to different types of injury. Main types of injuries likely to occur are largely vascular injury, nerve injury, skeletal injury and joint injuries. Perhaps, the most famous injury is vibration induced white fingers or Raynaud’s phenomena [4].

The aim of this study was to (1) use a participatory process to develop a rig to support <b>pneumatic</b> <b>rock</b> <b>drills</b> or large electric hammer drills in order to reduce the health risks and (2) evaluate the usability of the rig. Seven prototype rigs for supporting large hammer drills were developed and modified with feedback from commercial contractors and construction workers. The final design was evaluated by laborers and electricians (N= 29) who performed their usual concrete drilling with the usual method and the new rig. Subjective regional fatigue was significantly less in the neck, shoulders, hands and arms, and lower back) when using the universal rig compared to the usual manual method. Usability ratings for the rig were significantly better than the usual method on stability, control, drilling, accuracy, and vibration. Drilling time was reduced by approximately 50 % with the rig. Commercial construction contractors, laborers and electricians who use large hammer drills for drilling many holes should consider using such a rig to prevent musculoskeletal disorders, fatigue, and silicosis.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} evaluation of noise in hand-held <b>pneumatic</b> tools (<b>Rock</b> <b>drills)</b> used in Lashotor stone mines in Isfahan by the method of PNEUROP CAGI TEST CODE specifies the procedures which can be applied to certain items of construction equipment. Extremely loud noise damages hearing. In rare cases, the damage is momentary and caused by shock waves from, for instance, an explosion [1]. Damage to hearing normally occurs after many years of exposure to loud noise. Such damage is not sudden and total, but a gradual deterioration of the hearing which is most pronounced around the frequency of 4000 Hz [2]. Compressed air driven hand-tools are often used as examples of noisy machines. This is not surprising considering that air tools are extremely common and many old, compressed air tools are noisy [3]. This method is designed to evaluate noise and vibration propagated by the hand-held <b>pneumatic</b> tools [4]. <b>Rock</b> <b>drill</b> is one of the four product categories specially identified as a major source noise and vibration in the federal noise control Act of 1972 [5]. There are three different types of noise sources including: 1. Process noise, produced by contact between the machine and a surface, 2. Exhaust air noise, partly caused by the flow variation as the compressed air passes the motor, partly by the aerodynamic sound generated in the exhaust air channel, and 3. Vibration radiated noise, {{from the surface of the}} machine produced by the moving parts of machine and the flow of air inside the machine [6, 7].

40|$|In any mining enterprise, the {{extraction}} of the ore from the orebody is of vital importance. This activity is stoping. The gold mines of the Witwatersrand and its extensions in the Klerksdorp, Welkom, and Evander areas form the most extensive goldfield in the world. This address reviews stoping technology and improvements in this technology {{since the end of}} the Second World War. Although the reefs that make up the Witwatersrand orebody are uniquely extensive, they are not suited to mechanized mining. This is due to a number of factors such as the depth of the orebody, its narrowness, and the hardness and abrasiveness of the quartzite forming the orebody. The most notable improvements in stoping technology have been brought about because of our better under-standing of rock-engineering problems. This has resulted in better layouts, stoping geometry, systems of alleviating rock stresses, and support systems. It has enabled the industry, at ever-greater mining depths, to maintain and even increase productivity. These improvements, based on rock engineering, have significantly reduced the accidents due to rockbursts. There are many differences between today's stoping and that practised forty years ago. Panels are shorter, con-centrated mining has superseded bench mining, and the support systems are certainly better. Yet the face scraper is still used extensively, as are <b>pneumatic</b> <b>rock</b> <b>drills.</b> Some innovative stoping systems that have given rise to improved productivity are discussed. Explosives technology has shown spectacular advances during the period under review.
