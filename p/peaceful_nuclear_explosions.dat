5|$|The decade {{following}} {{ratification of}} the PTBT (1963–72) featured more US nuclear tests than the decade prior (1953–62). In the following decade, the US conducted 385 nuclear tests and 23 <b>peaceful</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>explosions</b> (PNEs), versus 268 tests and three PNEs in the preceding decade. In contrast, the number of Soviet detonations fell from 218 in the preceding decade to 157 in the following decade, as the Soviet Union {{was never able to}} meet the pace of US underground explosions. China and France, both non-signatories, conducted 53 tests between 1963 and 1973. In all, 436 tests were conducted between the signing of the PTBT and 1 July 1973, compared to 499 tests between 16 July 1945 and the signing of the PTBT. In the 1960s and 1970s, China conducted 22 atmospheric tests and France conducted 50. The last atmospheric test was conducted by China in 1980, after French atmospheric testing stopped in 1974. Public opposition to nuclear testing continued following the treaty's enactment. Greenpeace was founded in 1971 in opposition to a planned underground test on the Alaskan island of Amchitka. In 1982, a Greenpeace ship docked at Leningrad without permission demanding that the Soviet Union stop testing.|$|E

The γ and frequency-independent Qe parameters replace the traditional frequency-dependent Q(f) = Q 0 (f/f 0) η parameterization and provide stability, independence of assumptions of a background model, and convenience in interpretation.

40|$|India {{entered the}} nuclear club {{with a bang}} in may 1974. Prior to this there had been {{considerable}} debate in the country on whether India should go nuclear and whether she could afford to do so. Now that India is set on the nuclear path, much of the debate is theoretical Prime Minister Indira Gandhi has of course stated that India {{does not intend to}} make nuclear weapons of destruction. But nuclear technology and <b>nuclear</b> <b>explosions,</b> whether for <b>peaceful</b> or destructive purposes cost of the same. If the question whether India can effort it at all is relevant now, it is so {{only to the extent that}} we are discussing the pace of development of nuclear technology. The more significant question especially since India still claims that its nuclear programme is strictly for peaceful purpose is: Is it in India's security interest to renounce the use of nuclear technology for building nuclear weapons. What posture we adopt towards a nuclear weapons. Programme will of course depend on our threat perception. The history of India's nuclear technological development begins directly after independence with Jawaharlal Nehru. Nehru pressed hard for the development of civilian nuclear facilities in the name of scientific progress and domestic energy production. This was mainly driven by his desire to develop a Commission in 1947 to develop these civilian technologies by the 1960 's India had fuel and reprocessing facilities that resulted in weapons- ready plutonium. But all official considerations of nuclear energy research was still focused on civilian technologies.

40|$|Abstract Frequency-dependent coda {{attenuation}} {{values are}} often reported; how-ever, such measurements usually {{depend on the}} types of the Qf models employed. We use numerical modeling of <b>peaceful</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>explosion</b> (PNE) coda at far-regional to teleseismic distances to compare two such models, namely, the conventional frequency-dependent quality factor (Qcodaf Q 0 fη) and frequency-independent coda attenuation (Qc) with geometrical attenuation (γ). The results favor strongly the γ; Qc model and illustrate the mechanisms leading to apparent Qcodaf depen-dencies. Tests for variations of the crustal velocity structures show that the values of γ are stable and related to lithospheric structural types, and the inverted Qc-values can be systematically mapped into the true S-wave attenuation factors within the crust. Modeling also shows that γ could increase in areas where relatively thin attenuating layers are present within the crust; such areas could likely be related to younger and active tectonics. By contrast, when interpreted by using the traditional Q 0; η ap-proach, the synthetic coda shows a strong and spurious frequency dependence with η ≈ 0 : 5, which is also similar to the observations. Observed Lg coda from two PNEs located in different areas in Russia show sim-ilar values of γ ≈ 0 : 75 × 102 sec 1, which are also remarkably close to the inde-pendent numerical predictions. At the same time, coda Qc-values vary strongly, from 850 in the East-European platform to 2500 within the Siberian Craton. This suggests that parameters γ and Qc could provide stable and transportable discriminants for differentiating between the lithospheric tectonic types and ages and also for seismic coda regionalization in nuclear test monitoring research...|$|R
