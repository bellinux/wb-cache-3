5|$|Between the {{extremes}} of bicycles with classical front-wheel steering and those with strictly rear-wheel steering is a class of bikes with a <b>pivot</b> <b>point</b> somewhere between the two, referred to as center-steering, and similar to articulated steering. An early implementation of the concept was the Phantom bicycle in the early 1870s promoted as a safer alternative to the penny-farthing. This design allows for simple front-wheel drive and current implementations appear to be quite stable, even rideable no-hands, as many photographs illustrate.|$|E
5|$|The Leslie is {{specifically}} designed, via {{reproduction of the}} Doppler effect, to alter or modify sound. As the sound source is rotated around a specific <b>pivot</b> <b>point,</b> it produces tremolo (the modulation of amplitude) and a variation in pitch. This produces a sequence of frequency modulated sidebands. To stop a Leslie's rotor, a special brake circuit {{was added to the}} Leslie motor controls, that incorporated an electronic relay by producing a half-wave of direct current.|$|E

25|$|The small rudder of the Bf 109 was {{relatively}} ineffective at controlling the strong swing {{created by the}} powerful slipstream of the propeller during the early portion of the takeoff roll, and this sideways drift created disproportionate loads on the wheel opposite to the swing. If the forces imposed were large enough, the <b>pivot</b> <b>point</b> broke and the landing gear leg would collapse outward into its bay. Experienced pilots reported that the swing was easy to control, {{but some of the}} less-experienced pilots lost fighters on takeoff.|$|E
25|$|In its closed position, a {{swing bridge}} {{carrying}} a road or railway over a river or canal, for example, allows traffic to cross. When a water vessel needs {{to pass the}} bridge, road traffic is stopped (usually by traffic signals and barriers), and then motors rotate the bridge horizontally about its <b>pivot</b> <b>point.</b> The typical swing bridge will rotate approximately 90 degrees, or one-quarter turn; however, a bridge which intersects the navigation channel at an oblique angle may be built to rotate only 45 degrees, or one-eighth turn, in order to clear the channel.|$|E
25|$|The bridge {{opens to}} let {{shipping}} traffic through the Manchester Ship Canal, which occurs up to 14 times a day. The island supports the pivot {{points for the}} bridges' rotating structures, which are fixed in concrete.

The bridge is a steel arch of girders, and connects to the <b>pivot</b> <b>point</b> via a rack and pinion system. It is the only swing road bridge on the canal that rotates from the centre, instead of from one end.|$|E

25|$|Huygens {{analyzed}} {{this problem}} by finding the curve down which a mass will slide {{under the influence of}} gravity in the same amount of time, regardless of its starting point; the so-called tautochrone problem. By geometrical methods which were an early use of calculus, he showed it to be a cycloid, rather than the circular arc of a pendulum's bob, and therefore that pendulums are not isochronous. He also solved a problem posed by Mersenne: how to calculate the period of a pendulum made of an arbitrarily shaped swinging rigid body. This involved discovering the center of oscillation and its reciprocal relationship with the <b>pivot</b> <b>point.</b> In the same work, he analysed the conical pendulum, consisting of a weight on a cord moving in a circle, using the concept of centrifugal force.|$|E
25|$|Adhesions, or {{scar tissue}} between various organs {{that are not}} {{normally}} attached within the abdomen, may occur whenever an abdominal surgery is performed. It is often seen secondary to reperfusion injury where there is ischemic bowel or after intestinal distention. This injury causes neutrophils {{to move into the}} serosa and mesothelium to be lost, which the body then attempts to repair using fibrin and collagen, leading to adhesion formation between adjacent tissues with either fibrinous or fibrous material. Adhesions may encourage a volvulus, as the attachment provides a <b>pivot</b> <b>point,</b> or force a tight turn between two adjacent loops that are now attached, leading to partial obstruction. For this reason, clinical signs vary from silent lesions to acute obstruction, encouraging future colics including intestinal obstruction or strangulation, and requiring further surgery and risk of adhesion. Generally, adhesions form within the first two months following surgery. Adhesions occur most commonly in horses with small intestinal disease (22% of all surgical colics), foals (17%), those requiring enterotomy or a resection and anastomosis, or those that develop septic peritonitis.|$|E
25|$|The EL {{brought with}} it {{improvements}} to braking and handling. Speed-sensitive power steering on the Fairmont Ghia made parking more straightforward, without compromising high-speed steering. With {{the introduction of the}} new model, buyers could now purchase a Falcon with standard (optional on GLi) anti-lock brakes featuring the latest Bosch 5.3 module. Perhaps the biggest advancement with the EL was the improvements to the handling woes of the EF, with improvements established to the suspension and steering. Engineers at Tickford had discovered that by lowering the <b>pivot</b> <b>point</b> of the Watt's linkages in the rear suspension by 20millimetres (0.8in), that the roll oversteer effect which plagued the EF could finally be eliminated. Previously on EF models, during hard cornering the rear end of the car often felt as if it could not keep up with the front, due to the difference in roll rate between the front and rear suspension. The result of this produced unpredictable car handling at times, where the delayed weight transfer at the rear would seek to damage the integrity of the outside rear tyre grip. This was exaggerated even further in wet weather or on vehicles fitted with poor tyres. Although this problem was addressed to a degree in the EFII update, it was the EL that became the first base level Falcon to feature a rear suspension setup that would complement the precision of rack and pinion steering introduced in the EA Falcon eight years earlier. The improved suspension geometry allowed Ford to soften the spring rates on both front and rear on the EL for a more compliant ride, as the driver no longer had roll oversteer to contain.|$|E

500|$|In {{the late}} 1860s, Andrew Carnegie's Keystone Bridge Company built the {{original}} Keokuk and Hamilton Bridge {{in the same}} location as the Keokuk Rail Bridge. [...] It was a , steel truss bridge that had one set of tracks and two lanes for wagon traffic. Pedestrian traffic was cantilevered out [...] {{on either side of}} the trusses.

2500|$|An {{inverted}} pendulum is {{a pendulum}} {{that has its}} center of mass above its <b>pivot</b> <b>point.</b> It is often implemented with the <b>pivot</b> <b>point</b> mounted on a cart that can move horizontally and may be called a cart and pole {{as shown in the}} photo. Most applications limit the pendulum to 1 degree of freedom by affixing the pole to an axis of rotation. Whereas a normal pendulum is stable when hanging downwards, an inverted pendulum is inherently unstable, and must be actively balanced in order to remain upright; this can be done either by applying a torque at the <b>pivot</b> <b>point,</b> by moving the <b>pivot</b> <b>point</b> horizontally as part of a feedback system, changing the rate of rotation of a mass mounted on the pendulum on an axis parallel to the pivot axis and thereby generating a net torque on the pendulum, or by oscillating the <b>pivot</b> <b>point</b> vertically. A simple demonstration of moving the <b>pivot</b> <b>point</b> in a feedback system is achieved by balancing an upturned broomstick on the end of one's finger. [...] The inverted pendulum is a classic problem in dynamics and control theory and is used as a benchmark for testing control strategies.|$|E
