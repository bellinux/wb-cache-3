30|$|The Japanese {{government}} subsidises various silvicultural {{practices in}} planted forests {{irrespective of the}} tree species, providing approximately 70 % of the <b>planting,</b> <b>thinning</b> and other silvicultural costs. For this reason, these subsidies were not included as a variable in this study but rather treated as a constant with a value of 70 % of silvicultural costs (Additional file 1 : Table S 1 (b)). The reality of these subsidy systems was confirmed by checking active silvicultural areas throughout Japan and comparing the subsidies they received with the implemented silvicultural practices (Hiroshima and Nakajima 2006).|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of the present field experiment was to examine how plant density and en-hanced source, i. e. thinning treatments, may affect grain yield and its components for a non-prolific maize hybrid, SC 704. The environment of the hybrid maize crop was changed at intervals over its life cycle by removing every other plant in rows equispaced at 75 cm apart {{with a population of}} 13. 34 plants m- 2. The plants were grown with no wa-ter or nutrient restrictions. Results showed that earlier thinning was associated with greater stem, leaf, shoot and ear dry weight accumulation, ear kernel weight (EKW) and kernel number per ear row (KNER). In this ways the greatest of these characteristics were obtained in thinning at sowing i. e. 6. 67 plants m- 2 throughout. Delay in thinning un-til the 12 -leaf stage reduced stem dry weight and EKW significantly. Thinning at tasseling also resulted in significantly lower stem dry weight accumulation compared to thinning at sowing. At final harvest, the stem dry weight of <b>plants</b> <b>thinned</b> at tasseling was 20. 47 % (P< 0. 05) lower than those thinned at sowing. Similar effects were found upon delay in thinning until tasseling on leaf, shoot, and ear dry weight accumulation. Delay in thinning until the 12 -leaf stage or later, also reduced EKW significantly compared to <b>plants</b> <b>thinned</b> at sowing. This reduction was attributable to decreased KNER and 1000 -kernel weight. According to these results, KNER and 1000 -KW were found to be yield compo-nents sensitive to light environment...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{objective}} of this work was to select, using operational research techniques, management regimes of Pinus taeda L. that maximize the revenue generated by the wood, considering different attractiveness rates. The OpTimber-LP® software, which performs the simulations using SisPinus® software, was used for forest optimization. The regimes consisted of different combinations of forest sites, <b>planting</b> densities, <b>thinning</b> regimes and clearcutting ages, totaling 17, 760 regimes per site. Wood production was quantified and evaluated by assortment classes. <b>Planting,</b> <b>thinning</b> and harvesting costs were considered. The Annualized Net Present Value (ANPV) and the Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of each management regime were calculated. As a result, the density of 1, 600 plants per ha optimized ANPV for most cases. Optimized regimes included no or only one thinning and provided ANPV of 2, 753 and 158 BRL per ha and IRR of 22. 9 % and 2. 9 % for sites I and IV, respectively. It was concluded that the optimal number of thinning is reduced in lower quality sites, and the less productive the site, the later the optimal year for clearcutting. The attractiveness rate is a parameter {{that contributes to the}} selection of thinning regimes, because the larger the rate, the larger the number of thinning and the earlier they should be carried out...|$|R

40|$|For {{the past}} ten years, Douglas-fir on the Oregon and Washington coast has shown a {{progressive}} decrease in height and diameter increment {{as a result of}} Swiss needle cast, which is caused by Phaeocryptopus gaeumannii. In this contribution, we discuss the effects of silvicultural operations on Swiss needle cast and recommend specific actions to reduce the severity of the disease. We also suggest a method of assessing the severity of Swiss needle cast damage to a stand based on years of needle retention. Our recommendations are based on disease severity and are designed to discriminate against Douglas-fir when <b>planting,</b> <b>thinning,</b> and harvesting stands suffering low, medium, and high Swiss needle cast severity. These recommendations are based on our collective observations and research being conducted by the Swiss Needle Cast Cooperative...|$|R

The effect of all {{forestry practices}} (e. g., logging, road building, <b>planting,</b> <b>thinning,</b> and slash) on the riparian areas is considered since these areas {{are part of the}} landscape. In new forestry, more effort is directed in the planning effort to define site objectives and to understand the implications of each site objective at the landscape scale. This planning provides management with greater flexibility in applying forestry practices to all areas of the landscape {{as well as in the}} riparian areas. New forestry is implemented by using the different forestry practices to finesse the stream-reach scale to meet the established objectives in terms of the functional relationship at the landscape scale...|$|R

Os tratamentos utilizados foram 120, 100 e 80 frutos por planta, e o controle sem raleio (230 frutos por planta). As plantas submetidas ao raleio produziram frutos significativamente maiores e mais pesados do que os do controle. A produção por planta (kg) e a produtividade estimada (t/ha) foram maiores nas plantas sem raleio, mas a classificação comercial e a receita bruta (R$/ha) desse tratamento foram menores, devido ao menor tamanho e peso dos frutos. Os tratamentos 100 e 80 frutos por planta (56, 52 % e 65, 21 % de raleio, respectivamente) apresentaram os melhores resultados The {{objective of}} this paper was to test the behavior of peaches (Prunus persica (L.)

40|$|Localization and {{characterization}} of fruit set in winter tomato crops was investigated {{to determine the}} main internal and external controlling factors and to establish a quantitative relationship between fruit set and competition for assimilates. Individual fruit growth and development was assessed on a beef tomato cultivar during the reproductive period (first nine inflorescences). A non-destructive photograph technique {{was used to measure}} fruit growth from very early stages of their development and then calliper measurements were made on big fruits. From these measurements we determined the precise developmental stage at which fruit growth stopped. Fruit potential growth, which is defined as the growth achieved in non-limiting conditions for assimilate supply, was also assessed by this method on <b>plants</b> <b>thinned</b> to one flower per inflorescence. The latter was used to calculate the ratio between actual and potential growth, which was found to be a good index of the competition for assimilates...|$|R

40|$|A {{successful}} micropropagation {{system was}} developed for four different medicinal Maesa species. Multiple shoots were induced through both axillary bud formation and adventitious shoot regeneration from leaf explants. The explants were cultured on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with 6 -benzyladenine (BA), thidiazuron (TDZ) and/or alpha-naphthalene acetic acid (NAA). The success of regeneration varied for different species and depended on the type and concentration of plant growth regulators. Regenerated shoots spontaneously developed roots within 6 weeks on MS hormone-free medium. The rooted shoots were transferred to the greenhouse with a 100 % success rate. Furthermore, flow cytometry analysis indicated {{that there were no}} changes in ploidy level of those regenerated shoots as compared with wild type adult <b>plants.</b> <b>Thin</b> layer chromatography (TLC) analysis revealed that common and distinguishing spot of saponins were similarly observed in regenerated shoots compared to the control plants.

40|$|Uniform {{seed spacing}} has been {{demonstrated}} to bea significant factor in quality and yield for somecrops such as sugarbeets. With uniform spacing,the roots can grow to a uniform size and fill the row space without being pushed out of the row by a neighboring root. This ensures that all of each root can be gathered from the row by the harvester. With uneven plant spacing, some roots may be {{too small to be}} gathered by the harvester, or some roots may be too large, and may be damaged by the topping implements, or the lifting wheels of the harvester (Jaggard, 1990). Traditional methods of sugarbeet planting have involved planting excess seed and <b>thinning</b> the resulting <b>plants</b> to obtain the desired plant population at a uniform plant spacing.
