40|$|In {{the present}} study, we aimed at characterizing {{the effect of}} <b>prochloraz,</b> an {{imidazole}} fungicide, on the oocyte meiotic maturation process in a freshwater teleost species, the rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Full-grown post-vitellogenic ovarian follicles were incubated in vitro with <b>prochloraz,</b> Luteinizing Hormone (LH), {{or a combination of}} <b>prochloraz</b> and LH. The occurrence of oocyte maturation was assessed by monitoring germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD) after 62 -h in vitro incubation. Experiments were repeated in presence of actinomycin D, cycloheximide, or trilostane. The effect of <b>prochloraz</b> on the production of 17, 20 beta-dihydroxy- 4 -pregnen- 3 -one (17, 20 beta P), the natural maturation-inducing steroid, was quantified by radioimmunoassay. In addition, the effect of <b>prochloraz</b> on ovarian expression of 12 genes was monitored by real-time PCR. <b>Prochloraz</b> (10 (- 5) M) administered alone was able to induce 100 % GVBD in the most responsive females. The occurrence of GVBD observed after <b>prochloraz</b> stimulation of follicles originating from various females was similar and highly correlated with the occurrence of GVBD observed after stimulation with low LH concentration. In addition, oocyte maturation induced by LH or <b>prochloraz</b> was totally inhibited by actinomycin D, cycloheximide, and trilostane. Similarly to LH, <b>prochloraz</b> was able to trigger 17, 20 beta P production by the ovarian follicle. Finally, <b>prochloraz</b> induced the overexpression of genes participating in 17, 20 beta P production, intercellular communication, and paracrine control of preovulatory follicular differentiation such as igf, igf 2, connexin 43, and 20 beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (hsbd 20). Together, our results demonstrate that <b>prochloraz</b> administered alone is able to trigger oocyte maturation through the induction of specific genes, some of them being also triggered by LH.

40|$|<b>Prochloraz</b> is a {{commonly}} used fungicide that has shown multiple mechanisms {{of action in}} vitro. It antagonizes the androgen and the estrogen receptors, agonizes the Ah receptor, and inhibits aromatase activity. In vivo <b>prochloraz</b> acts antian-drogenically in the Hershberger assay by reducing weights of reproductive organs, affecting androgen-regulated gene expres-sions, and increasing luteinizing hormone (LH) levels. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate reproductive toxic effects after exposure during gestation and lactation to <b>prochloraz</b> alone and a mixture of five pesticides (deltamethrin, methiocarb, <b>prochloraz,</b> simazine, and tribenuron-methyl). <b>Prochloraz</b> (30 mg/kg/day) or the mixture (20 mg/kg/day) was dosed to pregnant Wistar dams from gestational day (GD) 7 until postnatal day (PND) 16. Some dams were taken for cesarean section at GD 21, and others were allowed to give birth. Results showed that <b>prochloraz</b> and the mixture significantly reduced plasma and testicular testosterone levels in GD 21 male fetuses, whereas testicular progesterone was increased. Gestational length was increased by <b>prochloraz.</b> Chem-ical analysis of the rat breast milk showed that <b>prochloraz</b> was transferred to the milk. In males a significant increase of nipple retention was found, and the bulbourethral gland weight was decreased, whereas other reproductive organs were unaffected. In addition cytochrome P 450 (CYP) 1 A activities in livers were induced by <b>prochloraz,</b> possibly as a result of Ah receptor activation. Behavioral studies showed that the activity level and sweet preference of adult males were significantly increased. Overall these results strongly indicate that <b>prochloraz</b> feminizes the male offspring after perinatal exposure, and that these effects are due, at least in part, to diminished fetal steroidogenesis...|$|E

Samples were taken in April (1985 - 1987) and July (1985 - 1989). When all inoculation treatments are considered together, carbendazim was ineffective at all sampling times after April 1985 because of its rapid selection for MBC-resistance, and increased eyespot incidence and severity in some samples. <b>Prochloraz</b> applied alone decreased eyespot incidence and severity at all sample times except July 1988.

Treatments and doses tested in the field per 100 l of water were iprodione (75 ml), benomyl (100 g), tebuconazole (50 ml), methyl thiofanate (70 g), <b>prochloraz</b> (100 ml), propiconazole (50 ml), mancozeb (200 g), folpet (270 g), copper sulfate (200 g) and chlorothalonil (200 g), sprayed weekly (protectants) or bi-weekly (systemic). Fruit yield and number of blighted flowers were computed. For the in vitro fungitoxicity tests, the rate of mycelial growth rate of conidial germination and appressorium formation were studied in fungicide dilutions. In vitro tests were conducted with 1 and 10 ppm, and subsequently at 0. 01, 0. 1 and 1 ppm for the most efficient products and at 10, 50 and 100 ppm, for the least efficient a. i. The fungicides that resulted in least mycelial growth at the lowest concentrations were <b>prochloraz</b> and tebuconazole, {{and the ones that}} least inhibited mycelial growth the was copper sulfate, chlorothalonil and folpet. Most efficient products for inhibition of conidial germination were chlorothalonil, tebuconazole, <b>prochloraz</b> and benomyl. Most efficient products for inhibition of appressorium formation were chlorothalonil and benomyl. Field results were partially different from in vitro results: <b>prochloraz</b> and copper sulfate had the lowest percentages of blighted flowers (53 - 55 %), whereas benomyl had 100 % blighted flowers. Although <b>prochloraz,</b> followed by iprodione, folpet and mancozeb resulted in larger fruit yields, no product alone provided sufficient control of strawberry flower blight...|$|E
40|$|The {{molecular}} {{mechanisms by}} which environmental pollutants including 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlordibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) or widely used imidazole fungicide <b>prochloraz</b> display their toxic effects in vertebrates is still not well understood. Using computer analysis, we recently identified nuclear aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) binding sites termed dioxin response elements (DREs) in the 5 -untranslated region (5 -UTR) of efflux transporter ABCG 2 (Accession No. EU 570105) from the bovine mammary gland. As these regulatory motifs mediate regulation of target genes by AhR agonists including TCDD and <b>prochloraz,</b> we have systematically investigated the effect of both contaminants on functional ABCG 2 transport activity in primary bovine mammary epithelial cells. TCDD or <b>prochloraz</b> doubled ABCG 2 -mediated Hoechst H 33342 secretion. This effect was almost completely reversed by specific ABCG 2 inhibitor Ko 143. In further mechanistic studies we showed that this induction was due to binding of activated AhR to DRE sequences in the ABCG 2 5 -UTR. Receptor binding was significantly reduced by specific AhR antagonist salicylamide. Induction of AhR by TCDD and <b>prochloraz</b> resulted in a time- and dose-dependent increase of ABCG 2 gene expression and transporter protein levels. As ABCG 2 represents the main mammary transporter for xenobiotics including drugs and toxins exposure to prevalent AhR agonists may enhance transporter-mediated secretion of potential harmful compounds into milk. Through identification of mammary ABCG 2 as a novel target gene of pesticide <b>prochloraz</b> and dioxin our results may therefore help to improve the protection of breast-feeding infants and the consumer of dairy product...|$|E
40|$|Consumers {{are exposed}} to {{multiple}} residues of different pesticides via the diet. Therefore, EU legislation for pesticides requires the evaluation of single active substances {{as well as the}} consideration of combination effects. Hence the analysis of combined effects of substances in a broad dose range represents a key challenge to current experimental and regulatory toxicology. Here we report evidence for additive effects for (tri) azole fungicides, a widely used group of antifungal agents, in the human placental cell line Jeg- 3. In addition to the triazoles cyproconazole, epoxiconazole, flusilazole and tebuconazole and the azole fungicide <b>prochloraz</b> also pesticides from other chemical classes assumed to act via different modes of action (i. e., the organophosphate chlorpyrifos and the triazinylsulfonylurea herbicide triflusulfuron-methyl) were investigated. Endpoints analysed include synthesis of steroid hormone production (progesterone and estradiol) and gene expression of steroidogenic and non-steroidogenic cytochrome-P- 450 (CYP) enzymes. For the triazoles and <b>prochloraz,</b> a dose dependent inhibition of progesterone production was observed and additive effects could be confirmed for several combinations of these substances in vitro. The non-triazoles chlorpyrifos and triflusulfuron-methyl did not affect this endpoint and, in line with this finding, no additivity was observed when these substances were applied in mixtures with <b>prochloraz.</b> While <b>prochloraz</b> slightly increased aromatase expression and estradiol production and triflusulfuron-methyl decreased estradiol production, none of the other substances had effects on the expression levels of steroidogenic CYP-enzymes in Jeg- 3 cells. For some triazoles, <b>prochloraz</b> and chlorpyrifos a significant induction of CYP 1 A 1 mRNA expression and potential combination effects for this endpoint were observed. Inhibition of CYP 1 A 1 mRNA induction by the AhR inhibitor CH 223191 indicated AhR receptor dependence this effect...|$|E

In unsprayed and carbendazim-sprayed whole plots, a stable coexistence of about 50 % each of T yallundae and T acuformis developed within five seasons, but in whole plots sprayed with <b>prochloraz</b> or <b>prochloraz</b> plus carbendazim, {{the proportion of}} T acuformis increased to > 80 %. A discrete time difference equation model was derived from knowledge of the biology of eyespot and competition theory to describe the population changes. The model was fitted to the data from treatments where coexistence occurred [subplots in unsprayed (1985 - 92) and carb endazim-sprayed (1985 - 89) whole plots], using nonlinear least squares regression. The optimized value of the resource overlap coefficient was small, suggesting niche {{differences between the two}} species. Populations were nearly 100 % carbendazim-resistant in carbendazim-sprayed whole plots by July 1985 (one season) and in whole plots sprayed with <b>prochloraz</b> plus carbendazirn by July 1986 (two seasons). In prochloraz-sprayed whole plots, the proportion of carbendazim-resistant isolates decreased more rapidly than in unsprayed whole plots in the 1980 s, but by July 1992 a shift in populations in unsprayed and prochloraz-sprayed whole plots towards predominantly carbendazim-resistant strains had occurred...|$|E

Parcelas sem aplicação de fungicida constituíram a testemunha. As pulverizações foram realizadas com pulverizador costal manual, com o jato dirigido para as panículas. O intervalo das aplicações dos fungicidas foi de 4 dias, a partir da antese. Aos 7 dias após o término das pulverizações, a porcentagem de panículas doentes variou 5, 4 para o fungicida tebuconazole e 100, 0 % para a maioria dos demais tratamentos. Para a porcentagem {{de flores}} doentes por panícula, os valores variaram de 0, 3 % a 65, 0 % para o fungicida tebuconazole e testemunha, respectivamente. Não ocorreu diferença significativa entre as porcentagens de flores doentes por panículas nos tratamentos tebuconazole (0, 3 %), chlorothalonil (2, 5 %) e <b>prochloraz</b> (3, 0 %), sendo esses os mais eficientes no controle da ergot. Adicionalmente, o fungicida mais eficiente no controle da antracnose foliar (Colletotrichum graminicola) foi o <b>prochloraz,</b> ao passo que para a ferrugem (Puccinia purpurea) e a cercosporiose (Cercospora fusimaculans), o maior controle foi obtido com o fungicida tebuconazole. Não houve aumento da germinação das sementes em nenhum dos tratamentos; entretanto, o aumento do peso de mil sementes foi significativo para os tratamentos com os fungicidas <b>prochloraz,</b> chlorotalonil e tebuconazole. The efficiency of fungicides {{in the control}} of sugar disease of sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench.) was evaluated in a seed production field of the sorghum hybrid BR 304. The following fungicides and doses (g a. i. /ha) were evaluated : captan (1250. 0), fenarimol (80. 0), fentin hydroxide (166. 7), <b>prochloraz</b> (450. 0), chlorothalonil (1500. 0), iprodione (750. 0), azoxystrobin (150. 0), thiabendazole (360. 0), procimidone (750. 0), ziram (1500. 0) and tebuconazole (200. 0). A control plot without fungicide application was included in this assay. Applications were performed with a back sprayer, covering the whole panicle, and using 4 days intervals between applications at the anthesis. Seven days {{after the end of}} the applications, the percentage of diseased panicles varied of 5. 4 for the fungicide tebuconazole and 100 for the most of the other treatments. For the percentage of diseased flowers for panicle, the values varied from 0. 3 to 65. 0 for the fungicide tebuconazole and check, respectively. No significant difference among the percentages of diseased flowers for panicles in the treatments tebuconazole (0. 3), chlorothalonil (2. 5) and <b>prochloraz</b> (3. 0), being those the most efficient fungicides in the control of the "ergot".

We aimed to develop a co-culture model to study steroidogenesis by the human fetoplacental unit and its disruption by exposure to environmental contaminants. We cultured BeWo human choriocarcinoma cells, representing the villous cytotrophoblast, and H 295 R human adrenocortical carcinoma cells, representing the fetal unit, in a carefully adapted co-culture medium. We placed H 295 R cells in 24 -well plates and BeWo cells on transwell inserts with or without pesticide treatment (atrazine or <b>prochloraz)</b> and assessed CYP 19 activity and hormonal production after 24 hr of co-culture. The co-culture exhibited the steroidogenic profile of the fetoplacental unit, allowing a synergistic production of estradiol and estriol (but not of estrone) of 133. 3 ± 11. 3 pg/mL and 440. 8 ± 44. 0 pg/mL, respectively. Atrazine and <b>prochloraz</b> had cell-type specific effects on CYP 19 activity and estrogen production in co-culture. Atrazine induced CYP 19 activity and estrogen production in H 295 R cells only, but did not affect overall estrogen production in co-culture, whereas <b>prochloraz</b> inhibited CYP 19 activity exclusively in BeWo cells and reduced estrogen production in co-culture by almost 90 %. In contrast, <b>prochloraz</b> did not affect estradiol or estrone production in BeWo cells in monoculture. These differential effects underline the relevance of our co-culture approach to model fetoplacental steroidogenesis. The co-culture of H 295 R and BeWo cells creates a unique in vitro model to reproduce the steroidogenic cooperation between fetus and placenta during pregnancy {{and can be used}} to study the endocrine-disrupting effects of environmental chemicals...|$|E

The efficacy of three fungicides (<b>prochloraz,</b> tebuconazole, fenpropimorph) for controlling growth of two strains of F. langsethiae isolated from oats was examined at 0. 96 and 0. 98 a(w) at 15, 20 and 25 °C on oat-based media. The concentrations necessary for 50 and 90 % growth inhibition (ED₅₀ and ED₉₀ values) were determined. The effect on the trichothecene type A mycotoxins T- 2 and HT- 2 was also determined. Without fungicides both strains grew faster at 0. 98 than at 0. 96 a(w) and the influence of temperature on growth rates was 25 > 20 > 15 °C. <b>Prochloraz</b> and tebuconazole were more effective than fenpropimorph against F. langsethiae. Strain, temperature and type of fungicide significantly influenced the ED₅₀ and ED₉₀ values for growth. The concentration ranges under different environmental conditions were: <b>prochloraz</b> (0. 03 - 0. 1 and 0. 3 - 1. 5), tebuconazole (0. 06 - 0. 9 and 1. 3 - 8. 2), and fenpropimorph (22 - 59 and 125 - 215 mg l⁻¹). Production of T- 2 and HT- 2 toxins was influenced by temperature, a(w), type of fungicide and dose. Levels of T- 2 were usually higher than those of HT- 2 under the same conditions. The biosynthesis of T- 2 toxin increased after 10 day incubation, but was reduced with decreasing temperature and increasing fungicide dose. At 0. 98 a(w) T- 2 levels increased in cultures containing fenpropimorph while at 0. 96 a(w) the toxin concentrations increased in response to the other two fungicides. Low doses of <b>prochloraz</b> or tebuconazole enhanced toxin production when compared with untreated cultures for strain 2004 - 59 at 0. 96 a(w) and 20 - 25 °C.
