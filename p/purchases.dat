5|$|Both {{countries}} faced {{difficulty in}} financing their own dreadnoughts. Although in Argentina the ruling National Autonomist Party supported the <b>purchases,</b> they initially faced public resistance for such expensive acquisitions. An influx of inflammatory newspaper editorials supporting new dreadnoughts, especially from La Prensa, and renewed border disputes, particularly Brazilian assertions that the Argentines {{were attempting to}} restore the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata, swayed the public to support the <b>purchases.</b> The Argentine President, José Figueroa Alcorta, attempted to ease the tensions with a message warning the Brazilians of a naval arms race should they continue on their present course. The Brazilian government replied with reasoning similar to Pena's speech in 1906, in that they believed the ships were necessary to replace the antiquated equipment left by the long-term neglect of the Brazilian Navy, and they repeatedly insisted that the ships were not meant for use against Argentina.|$|E

5|$|In {{the post-war}} years, {{acquisitions}} {{have become increasingly}} difficult for the National Gallery as the prices for Old Masters – {{and even more so}} for the Impressionists and Post-impressionists – have risen beyond its means.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the decision-making process}} of customers focusing on how <b>purchase</b> intention is transformed into actual <b>purchase.</b> Specifically, we investigate 1) how <b>purchase</b> intention is formed, 2) how <b>purchase</b> intention drives action, and 3) what factors stand between <b>purchase</b> intention and action. After reviewing literature on <b>purchase</b> intention and action, and the product evaluation mechanisms employed by the customer, we propose the following hypotheses. First, product value has {{a positive impact on}} <b>purchase</b> intention (H 1). Second, <b>purchase</b> intention increases the probability of <b>purchase</b> (H 2) and third, the relationship between <b>purchase</b> intention and <b>purchase</b> will be moderated by uncertainty levels in product valuation (H 3). To validate, we conduct a survey regarding four types of products and collect data from 300 respondents. Regression and Probit analyses methods are used for validation. H 1 and H 2 are supported while H 3 is partially supported. This study challenges the conventional notion that customers with high <b>purchase</b> intentions will necessarily move to the <b>purchase</b> stage. To this end, we examine the relationship between <b>purchase</b> intention and <b>purchase,</b> and find that uncertainty in valuation moderates the relationship...|$|R

5|$|On 6 November 2005, Octopus Cards Limited {{launched}} Octopus Rewards, {{a program}} that allows cardholders to earn rewards at merchants that are partners in the program. Participating merchants provide consumers with tailor-made offers and privileges. The rewards that the program offers are {{in the form of}} points, or reward dollars, stored on the card. Once a card is registered for the program, the cardholder may accumulate reward points by making <b>purchases</b> at participating merchants, and payments may be made in the form of cash, credit cards, or Octopus cards themselves. The rate at which reward points are earned per dollar-amount purchase differs by the merchant at which that the <b>purchases</b> are made. At Wellcome, for example, one point is earned for every purchase of HK$200; and at Watsons, points are earned at a rate of 0.5 percent per dollar amount of a purchase. Once these reward dollars are accumulated, they may be redeemed as payment for <b>purchases</b> at partner merchants for at least HK$1 per reward dollar. To redeem the accumulated reward dollars, cardholders must use the entire value amount in whole, and may not elect to use it partially. If the purchase price is lower than the amount of reward dollars available, the amount difference remains stored on the card. Founding partners for the Octopus Rewards program include HSBC, UA Cinemas and Wellcome.|$|E
