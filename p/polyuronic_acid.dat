40|$|Tragacanth gum (TG) is {{a natural}} gum whose {{biomedical}} applications are limited because of the low water solubility and the possibility to form only weak water-insoluble gels. An innovative method to produce water-soluble tragacanth (WST) is assessed in this work. WST structural characterization indicates a high-molecular weight <b>polyuronic</b> <b>acid,</b> which can undergo gelling by ionotropic complexation. Biological characterization shows no cytotoxicity on Hela, HepG 2, and L 929 cell lines. Furthermore, TG-based and WST-based gel beads prepared by ionic crosslinking with ferric and zinc ions are studied. Ferric WST gels exerted better cell adhesion with L 929 cells than ferric alginate gels. These characteristics make WST a promising candidate for tissue engineering and drug delivery application...|$|E
40|$|Bio{{polymers}} are polymers {{produced by}} living organisms. A more broad classification would embrace also those polymers synthesized from renewable sources which {{are able to}} display biodegradability. The demand of biopolymers has been continuously growing along these last decades. The main reason for such increasing interest is their sustainability; the renewable origin of biopolymers makes them inexhaustible in contrast with synthetic polymers produced from finite fossil sources. Biodegradability is a second advantage; due to the presence {{in the nature of}} enzymes able to degrade biopolymers under environmental conditions to give non-toxic products, their impact on the environment is basically trivial. Finally, the use of more or less modified biopolymers as biomaterials, owing to their unique properties of biocompatibility and biodegradability, has aroused their interest in several disciplines. As a result of all these considerations, great efforts in biopolymers research including chemical modification, characterization and property evaluation are today being carried out to develop new materials able to replace traditional plastics in a wide diversity of applications. In the present Thesis, a selection of carboxylic biopolymers has been studied for their capacity to form stable ionic complexes with cationic surfactants suitable to render new materials with advanced properties. Previous studies on polyelectrolytesurfactant complexes carried out in our group have demonstrated that these coupled systems tend to be self-assembled in well-ordered structures that can be exploited for building films and particles with singular properties as biomaterials. The main goal of this Thesis is the study of polyelectrolyte-ionic complexes based on naturally occurring polyacids and cationic surfactants. One part of the work delves into the complexes of poly(g-glutamic acid), a system that has been object of continuous research in our group from 90 s. The aim is to progress in the development by making them "greener" through coupling with bio-based surfactants, and by improving their basic properties through blending with nanoclays. The other part is dedicated to explore the ionic complexes made from <b>poly(uronic</b> <b>acid)</b> s and cationic surfactants. This {{is the first time that}} such complexes are examined and their structural features and properties compared to those displayed by complexes based on poly(glutamic acid). Experimentally, the Thesis embodies a multidisciplinary task work including preparation, structural characterization and evaluation of thermal properties of a series of ionic complexes, as well as a preliminary valuation of the suitability of some of them to be used as drug delivery systems. Hence, the specific objectives in this Thesis are enumerated as follows: 1. Synthesis and chemical characterization of ionic complexes of <b>poly(uronic</b> <b>acid)</b> s (pectinic, alginic and hyaluronic acids), with trimethylalkylammonium surfactants of n= 18, 20 and 22. Structural and thermal analysis of these complexes and critical comparison of results with those available for complexes made of poly(glutamic acid). 2. Synthesis and characterization of choline-based surfactants for the preparation of fully bio-based polyglutamic complexes as an alternative to complexes based on trimethylalkylammonium surfactants in their potential use as biomaterials. Structural and thermal analysis of these complexes and their preliminary evaluation as nano-particulated drug delivery systems. 3. Preparation of composites of poly(glutamic acid) -cationic surfactant complexes with organo-modified nanoclays, their extensive structural characterization and the evaluation of their thermal and mechanical properties compared to those displayed by the neat complexes. The Thesis is organized in five Chapters. After a very brief summary of the whole work with explicit definition of the objectives, Chapter I is an introduction to the subject, in which an extensively referenced account of the main hints previously achieved in the field is provided and the state-of-art is described. The following three Chapters correspond to the three specific objectives enumerated above. Chapter II gathers the synthesis, characterization and properties evaluation study carried out on ionic complexes of <b>poly(uronic</b> <b>acid)</b> s. Chapter III is focused on the study of ionic complexes of polyglutamic and alkanoylcholines, the synthesis and characterization of the surfactants, the preparation of their complexes with poly(glutamic acid) and their possibilities as potential biomaterials. Chapter IV covers the preparation of the composites made of Cloisite 30 B and poly(glutamic acid) complexes along with a detailed study of their structure by X-ray diffraction, electron microscopy and modeling, and a correlative analysis of their structure with their thermal and mechanical properties. Chapter V contains the whole collection of conclusions that have been drawn from the Thesis. The author’s profile and published scientific production coming out from the Thesis constitute the body of the closing part. Postprint (published version...|$|E

Suspension of cells in media deficient in calcium results in abortive encystment {{characterized by the}} release of viscous cyst coat material. Mature cysts rupture in ethylene glycol-bis-(beta-aminoethyl ether) -N,N'-tetraacetic acid, suggesting that calcium is a structural component of the cyst coat. Maximal stimulation of encystment by calcium ions occurs prior to {{the completion of the}} cyst exine or outer coat. The uronic acid composition of cyst components is dependent on calcium levels in the medium. Uronic acids account for 31. 7 percent of the intine (inner coat) and 13 percent of the exine dry weight, and only mannuronic and guluronic acids are present in these fractions. These can be extracted as homo- and heteropolymeric sequence "blocks" characteristic of alginic acids. The <b>polyuronic</b> <b>acid</b> fraction of both the cyst coats contain approximately equal amounts of heteropolymeric (mannuronic acid/guluronic acid) blocks. The exine, however, is richer in polyguluronic acid and the intine is richer in polymannuronic acid. As a result, the mannuronic acid/guluronic acid ratio of the exine is lower than that of the intine. Slimes that form in abortive encystment are rich in polymannuronic acid and have a high mannuronic acid/guluronic acid ratio. A polymannuronic acid 5 -epimerase is active in the mature cyst central body and the encystment culture fluid...|$|E
40|$|Little {{has been}} {{reported}} {{about the effects of}} different polysaccharides on cytokine production from human monocytes. In this study, we show that several well-defined polysaccharides, including polymers with different sizes of beta 1 - 4 -linked D-mannuronic acid (poly-M, high-M alginate, and M-blocks) and cellulose oxidized in the C- 6 position, induced human monocytes to produce tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha). Poly-M was the most efficient polysaccharide tested and, on a weight basis, was approximately as efficient as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Escherichia coli. TNF-alpha production was shown to depend strongly on the molecular weights of poly-M and high-M alginate, with maximal TNF-alpha production occurring at molecular weights above 50, 000 and 200, 000, respectively. G-blocks, alpha 1 - 4 -linked L-guluronic acid polymers that did not induce cytokine production from monocytes, reduced the cytokine production induced by the beta 1 - 4 -linked <b>polyuronic</b> <b>acids</b> and LPS. Furthermore, both G-blocks and LPS were found to inhibit the binding of poly-M to monocytes, as measured by flow cytometry. In addition, we found that the binding of LPS to monocytes was inhibited by G-blocks, M-blocks, and poly-M. Our results indicate that beta 1 - 4 -linked <b>polyuronic</b> <b>acids</b> and LPS may stimulate monocytes to produce TNF-alpha by similar mechanisms and may bind to a common receptor...|$|R

The complexes were analysed by DSC and WAXS/SAXS and compared to their analogous made from poly(γ-glutamic acid). They all adopt a biphasic layered structure in which the main chain and the alkyl side chain alternate with a nanometric periodicity. Alkyl side chains were partially crystallized in these complexes and they show reversible melting at temperatures within the 60 - 80 ºC range depending {{on the length of}} the polymethylene segment.

40|$|Selective {{oxidation}} of galacturonic residues of oligo and <b>polyuronic</b> <b>acids</b> by Cr-VI affords CO 2 /HCO 2 H, oxidized uronic acid, and Cr-III as final redox products. Kinetic {{studies show}} that the redox reaction proceeds through a mechanism combining Cr-VI -> Cr-IV -> Cr-II and Cr-VI -> Cr-IV -> Cr-III pathways. The mechanism is supported by the observation of free radicals, CrO 22 + and Cr-V as reaction intermediates. The EPR spectra show that five- and six coordinated oxo-Cr-V intermediates are formed. Penta-coordinated oxo-Cr-V species are present at any [H+], whereas hexa-coordinated ones are only observed at pH < 1. At low pH Cr-V predominating species are coordinated by carboxylate groups and O-ring (g(iso) = 1. 9783 / 5). At pH 7. 5, the predominating ones are those coordinated by alcoholate groups of the ligand (g(iso) = 1. 9800). Polygal can reduce Cr-VI and efficiently trap Cr-III. This behaviour represents an interesting model for the study of biomaterials, which possess a high proportion of polygal, in order to remove chromium from polluted waters...|$|R

Burkholderia cenocepacia, which normally infects adolescent patients, encounters alginate elaborated by mucoid P. aeruginosa. To determine whether P. aeruginosa alginate facilitates B. cenocepacia infection in mice, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator knockout mice were infected with B. cenocepacia strain BC 7 suspended in either phosphate-buffered saline (BC 7 /PBS) or P. aeruginosa alginate (BC 7 /alginate), and the pulmonary bacterial load and inflammation were monitored. Mice infected with BC 7 /PBS cleared {{all of the}} bacteria within 3 days, and inflammation was resolved by day 5. In contrast, mice infected with BC 7 /alginate showed persistence of bacteria and increased cytokine levels for up to 7 days. Histological examination of the lungs {{indicated that there was}} moderate to severe inflammation and pneumonic consolidation in isolated areas at 5 and 7 days postinfection in the BC 7 /alginate group. Further, alginate decreased phagocytosis of B. cenocepacia by professional phagocytes both in vivo and in vitro. P. aeruginosa alginate also reduced the proinflammatory responses of CF airway epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages to B. cenocepacia infection. The observed effects are specific to P. aeruginosa alginate, because enzymatically degraded alginate or other <b>polyuronic</b> <b>acids</b> did not facilitate bacterial persistence. These observations suggest that P. aeruginosa alginate may facilitate B. cenocepacia infection by interfering with host innate defense mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|Both dilute and {{concentrated}} solutions of bacterial Mannuronan (MANNA) and its epimerized products by AlgE 1 at 5 and 24 h, named MANNAEp 1 t 5 h and MANNAEp 1 t 24 h, respectively, and AlgE 4 (MANNAEp 4) {{have been studied}} {{as a function of}} variables such as polymer concentration and ionic strength (NaCl) in order to investigate the macromolecular solution properties of these innovative <b>polyuronic</b> <b>acids</b> having the same charge density but different composition and sequence of b-D-mannuronic acid (-M-), a-L-guluronic acid (-G-) or MGblocks. Measurements of intrinsic viscosity [h] as a function of ionic strength, I, by capillary viscometry has led to an estimate of the Smidsrød- Haug parameter B, an index useful to characterize the stiffness of polymeric chains. The results are largely consistent with much of the published data relative to chain extension and conformational freedom around the torsional angles of the glycosidic linkages occurring in alginates. Steady shear rheometry provided information about the coil-overlapping parameter c*, which marks the transition from dilute to concentrated solution. The slopes of the double logarithmic plots of hsp vs. c[h] both at low and high degrees of coil overlap suggest that all samples solutions behave like linear polymer entangled network systems. The value of c* is strictly influenced by the stiffness of the chains, and hence by the primary structure. Dynamic shear rheometry shows that the frequency dependence of dynamic viscosity is only partially superimposable to the shear rate dependence of viscosity. Such behaviour may be ascribed to the presence of semiflexible polymeric coils in a non-totally destructured entangled state. By solvent/non-solvent (H 2 O/isopropanol) fractionation carried out on mannuronan, a set of samples with different average molecular weights and narrow polydispersities were obtained. Triple detection GPC allowed the evalutation of the Mark–Houwink–Sakurada parameters {{as well as of the}} characteristic ratio CN for one of the fractionated MANNA samples.

In which, Talinum patens is well-known not only a leaf vegetable but also a valuably medicinal herb. It is useful to treat many various deseases thanks to contain the bioactive materials such as: triterpenoids, anthriquinon, saponin, <b>polyuronic,</b> organic <b>acid</b> and sucrose [...] Oleanolic acid (a kind of sapogenin) is formed by the hydrolyzed saponin in the plant cells. The main goal of this study was to forecast rapid and available methods to obtain a first indication of saponin oleanolic acid in the solven extraction from any plant which containing these compounds. The T. patens’ roots were used as the first sample for analyses. The autolyzed dried-roots were extracted by the other solvents. The residue compound was determinated by thin layer chromatography (TLC) in the solvent buffers: chloroform – methanol (9 : 1 v/v); toluen – diethyl acetate (7 : 3 v/v). As a result, the chromatograms indicated that the analysed material contained saponin oleanolic acid (violet spots). Besides, a novel and simple ultraviolet Vis spectroscopy was also applied to quantificative analysis for this work. Quantification was performed by densitometry λ = 540 nm. 0. 94 % w/w saponin oleanolic acid was found in the roots biomass (based on oleanolic acid reference). The obtained results showed oleanolic acid can be detected and measured repidly, accurately, specifically and less expensively by TLC and UV-Vis spectroscopy. They are useful for the qualtative as well as quantitative determination of oleanolic acid in the different solvents, and significant in the improvement of the compounds’ identification processes...|$|R
