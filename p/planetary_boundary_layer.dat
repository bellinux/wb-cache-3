5|$|The {{atmospheric}} {{effect of}} surface friction with winds aloft force surface winds to slow and back counterclockwise {{near the surface}} of the Earth blowing inward across isobars (lines of equal pressure), when compared to the winds in frictionless flow well above the Earth's surface. This layer where friction slows and changes the wind is known as the <b>planetary</b> <b>boundary</b> <b>layer,</b> sometimes the Ekman layer, and it is thickest during the day and thinnest at night. Daytime heating thickens the boundary layer as winds at the surface become increasingly mixed with winds aloft due to insolation, or solar heating. Radiative cooling overnight further enhances wind decoupling between the winds at the surface and the winds above the boundary layer by calming the surface wind which increases wind shear. These wind changes force wind shear between the boundary layer and the wind aloft, and is most emphasized at night.|$|E
5|$|The Quantitative Precipitation Forecast (abbreviated QPF) is the {{expected}} amount of liquid precipitation accumulated over a specified time period over a specified area.

Forecast models show significant sensitivity to humidity levels within the <b>planetary</b> <b>boundary</b> <b>layer,</b> or in the lowest levels of the atmosphere, which decreases with height. QPF can be generated on a quantitative, forecasting amounts, or a qualitative, forecasting the probability of a specific amount, basis. Radar imagery forecasting techniques show higher skill than model forecasts within 6 to 7hours of the time of the radar image. The forecasts can be verified through use of rain gauge measurements, weather radar estimates, or a combination of both. Various skill scores can be determined to measure the value of the rainfall forecast.|$|E

Until present, the PBLs typical of stormy weather were always considered as neutrally stratified. Recent works have disclosed that such PBLs are in fact very strongly affected by the static stability of the free atmosphere and must be treated as factually stable (we call this type of the PBL “conventionally neutral ” in contract to the “truly neutral ” PBLs developed against the neutrally stratified free flow).

40|$|A massively {{parallel}} large-eddy simulation (LES) code for <b>planetary</b> <b>boundary</b> <b>layers</b> (PBLs) that utilizes pseudospectral differencing in horizontal planes and solves an elliptic pressure equation is described. As an application, this code {{is used to}} examine the numerical convergence of the three-dimensional time-dependent simulations of a weakly sheared daytime convective PBL on meshes varying from 323 to 10243 grid points. Based on the variation of the second-order statistics, energy spectra, and entrainment statistics, LES solutions converge provided there is adequate separation between the energy-containing eddies and those near the filter cutoff scale. For the convective PBL studied, the majority of the low-order moment statistics (means, variances, and fluxes) become grid independent when the ratio zi/(CsDf). 310, where zi is the <b>boundary</b> <b>layer</b> height, Df is the filter cutoff scale, and Cs is the Smagorinsky constant.

For Wangara, the simulated variances and fluxes match that expected from similarity arguments, while the mean state is a little less mixed than the observations. In the BOMEX simulation, the shape and magnitude of the fluxes and the turbulence kinetic energy budget agree with LES results and observations. However, the liquid water mixing ratio is too large. This is attributed to an underprediction of the skewness. In agreement with observations from the ASTEX experiment, many of the model-simulated fields distinctly reflect a regime in transition between the trade wind cumulus and the classic stratocumulus-topped <b>boundary</b> <b>layers.</b> In general, the simulated entrainment rate tends to be a little underpredicted in regimes where there is little cloud-top radiative cooling (Wangara and BOMEX), while it is overpredicted in regimes where this process is more critical (e. g., ASTEX).

The resolution was chosen to be coarse so that the results might be sensitive to the details of the various subgrid scale model formulations.

Profiles of first and second moments, budgets of resolved-scale second moments, and spectra have been analyzed.

Often as much as 50 % of the grid points in a computational domain are devoted to these regions. The dense grids that this implies also generally require small time steps for numerical stability and/or accuracy. It is commonly assumed that the inner wall layers are near equilibrium, so that the standard logarithmic law can be applied as the boundary condition for the wall stress {{well away from the}} wall, for example, in the logarithmic region, obviating the need to expend large amounts of grid points and computational time in this region. This approach is commonly employed in LES of <b>planetary</b> <b>boundary</b> <b>layers,</b> and it has also been used for some simple engineering flows.
