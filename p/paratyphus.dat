50|$|Bucky {{was born}} in Leipzig. He wanted to become an engineer, but his parents steered him toward medical school. He studied {{medicine}} in Geneva and Leipzig, graduating from medical school in 1906 after completing a thesis on the mechanisms of the movement of <b>paratyphus</b> from lymph and blood vessels to the gastrointestinal tract.|$|E
50|$|Prisoners {{are forced}} {{to sleep in a}} room with 80 to 90 people in 30 square metre (322 square feet) flea-infested rooms. Prisoners are only {{occasionally}} allowed to use the toilet (one for about 300 people) and may only take a shower after several months. Diseases like <b>paratyphus</b> are common, resulting from the bad nutrition.|$|E
50|$|The catastrophic {{situation}} of the inmates appalled the 24-year-old officer; the barracks stood on a swampy field and had no floor. The mortality rate, primarily from Typhus and <b>Paratyphus</b> stood at up to 50 dead per day. At Dold's request a sanitary inspection commission {{was called in to}} examine the hygienic and medical facilities, resulting in the transfer of the commandant.|$|E
40|$|A 47 -years old farmer, male: Afflicted with <b>paratyphus</b> C, {{at the age}} of 29 years, and {{followed}} by tertian malaria, attack occurring at the interval of three days. Thereafter he had continual and intermittent tic-like or tonic cramps. This cramps grow more frequent with lapse of time, and finally the cramps occured uninterruptedly during his waking hours. This does not change by emotional changes, {{what he wants to do}} or by his will, but it is absent during his sleeping hours. Concomitant with such clinical symptoms, multiple foci from the right hemisphere can always be observed in the electroencephalogram, and sometimes multiple foci from the left hemisphere can also be seen. In the physocephalic picture a slight atrophic picture can be recognized in a portion of the cerebrum, especially in the right hemisphere. Then in March when he was about 47 years old, he had occasional expiratory dyspnea, and thereafter there occurred transiently such symptoms as loss of memory, fatigue, and restlessness what might be construed as “epilepsy-replacement” phenomena. However, up today there occurred no great or small fit or loss of consciousness...|$|E
