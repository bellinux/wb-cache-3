40|$|From data {{it seems}} that the {{presence}} of OTA on surface of sausages does not represent a food health risk for human, considering that OTA was not identified inside in the dry meat. In particular after washing the surface of the sausages, no OTA was detected on the casings. So to limit any accidental contamination of the meat of the sausages, it was suggested to wash the casings before packaging or slicing. However the control of the temperature and the Relative Humidity during sausages production and the choice of a <b>protective</b> <b>moulds</b> starter cultures (Leistner, 1986; Comi et al., 2004), are the best methods to limit the presence and the growth of toxigenic moulds on the surface of dry sausages...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} {{a report on}} the study of structural modifications LM 4 processed by semi solid metallurgy. This was with the view to determine effects of degree of cold work, thermal treatment temperature and soaking time on the structural formations in the alloy. LM 4 alloy was prepared and cast in sand <b>mould</b> into <b>rods</b> of diameter 12 mm and 200 mm in length. The cast rods were then heated to different temperatures which fall within the slurry region of the alloy. The heated samples were soaked at these temperatures for various times. There was also a set of non-treated control samples. The thermally treated rods were subjected to various degrees of cold work after which the metallographic examination of the samples was carried out. The observed microstructure of the alloy showed significant modifications...|$|R

The specimens were prepared from the rods to study the microstructure, microhardness and wear properties. It {{was found that the}} aging process increases the hardness of the alloy significantly. It was due to the change in the microstructure of the alloy. Further, spinodal decomposition and the ordering reaction take place during the aging treatment. Specific wear rate was found to decrease with the hardness of the alloy. Coefficient of friction remains constant and is not affected by the aging process...|$|R

40|$|The results {{concerning}} {{emission of}} gases from two commercial graphite <b>protective</b> coatings for <b>moulds</b> and cores (water and alcoholic) {{are given in}} the hereby paper. Investigations were performed in two systems. One of the systems was corresponding to conditions occurring inside the mould cavity immediately after its pouring with liquid metal (Method 1), while the second was simulating conditions deep inside the mould at a certain distance from the casting (Method 2). Investigations were {{carried out in the}} CO 2 atmosphere and in the air. The water protective coating generated 1. 5 to 3 times larger volume of gases than the alcoholic coating (in dependence on the measuring method and atmosphere).

40|$|When {{cast steel}} {{castings}} {{are made in}} moulding sands on matrices of high-silica sand, which has a low fire resistance {{the problem of the}} so-called chemical penetration is distinctly visible. Whereas this effect appears to a small degree only when moulding sand matrices are of chromite, zircon or olivine sands. Therefore in case of making castings of high-manganese cast steel (e. g. Hadfield steel) sands not containing free silica should be applied (e. g. olivine sand) or in case of a high-silica matrix <b>protective</b> coatings for <b>moulds</b> and cores should be used. Two protective coatings, magnesite alcoholic (marked as coating 1 and coating 2) originated from different producers and intended for moulds for castings of the Hadfield steel, were selected for investigations. Examinations of the basic properties were performed for these coatings: viscosity, thermal analysis, sedimentation properties, wear resistance. In order to estimate the effectiveness of protective coatings the experimental castings were prepared. When applying coating 1, the surface quality of the casting was worse and traces of interaction between the casting material (cast steel) and the coating were seen. When protective coating 2 was used none interactions were seen and the surface quality was better...|$|R
5000|$|Ductile {{iron pipe}} is a pipe made of {{ductile cast iron}} {{commonly}} used for potable water transmission and distribution. This type of pipe is a direct development of earlier cast iron pipe, which it has superseded. The ductile iron used to manufacture the pipe {{is characterized by the}} spheroidal or nodular nature of the graphite within the iron. Typically, the pipe is manufactured using centrifugal casting in metal or resin lined <b>moulds.</b> <b>Protective</b> internal linings and external coatings are often applied to ductile iron pipes to inhibit corrosion: the standard internal lining is cement mortar and standard external coatings include bonded zinc, asphalt or water-based paint. In highly corrosive environments loose polyethylene sleeving (LPS) to encase the pipe may also be used. Life expectancy of unprotected ductile iron pipes depends on the corrosiveness of soil present and tends to be shorter where soil is highly corrosive. However, a lifespan in excess of 100 years has been estimated for ductile iron pipelines installed using [...] "evolved laying practices", including use of properly installed LPS (polyethylene encasement). [...] Studies of ductile iron pipe's environmental impact have differing findings regarding emissions and energy consumed. Ductile iron pipe manufactured in the United States has been certified as a sustainable product by the Institute for Market Transformation to Sustainability.|$|R
40|$|Needle fibre calcite {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{ubiquitous}} habits of calcite in vadose environments (caves deposits, soil pores, etc.). Its origin, either through inorganic, indirect or direct biological processes, has long been debated. In this study, investigations at 11 sites in Europe, Africa and Central America support arguments for its biogenic origin. The wide range of needle morphologies is the result of a gradual evolution of the simplest type, a rod. This rod is the elementary brick which, by aggregation and welding, builds more complex needles. The absence of cross-welded needles implies that they are welded in a mould, or under a longitudinal and unidirectional constraint, before being released inside the soil pores. The difference between the lengthening of the needles and the c axis can be explained by the existence of needles observed under a scanning electron microscope in organic sleeves, which can act as a <b>mould</b> during <b>rod</b> growth. Complex morphologies with epitaxial outgrowths on straight rods cannot have grown entirely inside organic microtubes; they must result from soil diagenesis after the release of straight rods in a soil-free medium. Whisker crystals are interpreted as the result of growth and coalescence of euhedral crystals on a rod. Rhomb chains are considered to be the consequence of successive epitaxial growth steps on a needle during variations in growth conditions. Isotopic signatures for needle fibre calcite vary from - 16. 63 [per mille] to + 1. 10 [per mille] and from - 8. 63 [per mille] to - 2. 25 [per mille] for Delta 13 C and Delta 18 O, respectively. The absence of high Delta 18 O values for needle fibre calcite precludes a purely physicochemical origin (evaporative) for this particular habit of calcite. As epitaxial growth cannot precipitate in the same conditions as initial needles, needle fibre calcite stable isotopic signatures should be used with caution as a proxy for palaeoenvironmental reconstructions. In addition, it is suggested that the term needle fibre calcite should be kept for the original biogenic form. The other habit should be referred to as epitaxial forms of needle fibre calcite...|$|R
40|$|Wear {{behaviour}} of sand cast Cu- 11 Ni- 6 Sn alloy was studied using pin-on-disc wear tester with {{alloy steel}} disc as counterpart on dry sliding wear conditions. The alloy was prepared from pure elements and melted in an electric furnace under argon atmosphere and cast into sand <b>moulds.</b> The cast <b>rods</b> were homogenized, solution heat treated and aged. Specific wear rate and {{coefficient of friction}} were measured in a sliding speed of 191 rpm, 287 rpm and 382 rpm and different normal forces of 10 N, 15 N and 20 N. Hardness of the specimen was found to increase by the aging process and it reached its maximum value, after which it decreased. The specific wear rate was found to increase {{with the increase in}} normal load and it decreased with the increase in speed. Co-efficient of friction is independent of hardness of the alloy and dependent on both applied load and speed. The strength of the material is increased by a technique called spinodal decomposition and aging process. In the case of Cu-Ni-Sn system the various alloy composition was not tested for tribological behaviour. Only few alloy compositions are studied. So in this case we have taken Cu- 11 Ni- 6 Sn alloy composition. The products made by Cu-Ni-Sn alloy is less costlier compared to Cu-Be products without health hazard and used as high performance connector materials in electronics applications, bearing material in aerospace and mining industries, friction-reducing and anti-wear materials to make high performance bearings for aerospace...|$|R
40|$|National audienceWe {{report on}} the primary and {{secondary}} acoustic forces exerted by ultrasonic standing waves on the motion of air bubbles in microfluidic devices. Bubbles are generated in a flow-focusing device and various sizes are obtained by adjusting the air to water plus surfactant flow rates. Ultrasounds are brought in channel through the resonance modes of a glass <b>rod</b> <b>moulded</b> near the channel. A CCD camera is used for optical measurements and to record bubble trajectories. Primary Bjerknes forces cause the very compressible bubbles entering the standing wave region to be deflected and attracted either towards the nodes or the anti-nodes, depending on the relative value of the standing wave frequency and the bubbles resonance. This acoustic force of a few hundreds of nanoNewtons in amplitude {{can be used to}} drive bubbles in a lab-on-a chip device, by a proper choice of the applied frequency, using moderate sound amplitudes of order of 10 kPa. Secondary Bjerknes forces between two or more bubbles oscillating in the main pressure field are seen for large pressure amplitudes and/or when the bubbles come close enough. In this case, we observe superimposed to the primary force an additional effect due to the pressure field radiated from one pulsating bubble acting on the second, that makes them either to agglomerate, or to repulse. Size sorting experiments using this principle will be presented. Last, a new phenomenon has been evidenced for moderate incident field amplitudes that manifests by a self-organisation of the bubbles into a periodic lattice. In order to explain the existence of this Â“bubble crystalÂ” that moves independently of the acoustic standing wave, existence parameters (size of the bubbles, acoustic amplitude, frequency) have been systematically investigated, leading to a new phenomenological and theoretical description based on bubble-bubble interactions mediated by acoustic waves...|$|R
