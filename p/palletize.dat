50|$|Palletizing {{is one of}} {{the more}} popular {{applications}} for robots,and is accomplished by combining a series of commands into a palletizing routine. A RoboLogix palletizing routine consists of five program instructions, or lines. The first instruction is the <b>Palletize</b> instruction, which is followed by a linear motion instruction to move to the stack point. The stack point is the top-center of the workpiece, and a group of stack points forms a stacking pattern, as shown in the adjacent image. The first stack point in a stacking pattern is located at (1,1,1) (row,column, layer) and is incremented each time the palletizing routine is executed.|$|E
50|$|The {{research}} in expending and applying the ICAM definitions have proceeded. In the 1990s {{for example the}} Material Handling Research Center (MHRC) of the Georgia Institute of Technology and University of Arkansas had included the it in their Information Systems research area. That area focuses on the information that must accompany material movements {{and the application of}} artificial intelligence to material handling problems. MHRC's {{research in}}volves expanding the integrated computer-aided manufacturing definition (IDEF) approach to include the information flow as well as the material flow needed to support a manufacturing enterprise, as well as models to handle unscheduled events such as machine breakdowns or material shortages. Past research resulted in software to automatically <b>palletize</b> random-size packages, a system to automatically load and unload truck trailers, and an integrated production control system to fabricate optical fibers.|$|E
5000|$|SSI Schaefer's Schaefer Case Picking {{system is}} a fully automated, {{customizable}} picking solution for retail. It manages all aspects from unloading of incoming pallets and intermediate storage to the ordering and repackaging of cases into new pallets. The SCP uses a computer vision system to identify items, removing the requirement of other identification schemes such as those involving barcodes or RFID tags. It can automatically select and <b>palletize</b> products according to store layout or other customer criteria, and prepare the products for shipping. The system reduces labor requirements, product loss, and energy consumption {{by way of a}} more accurate, route-optimized computer-controlled system that reduces wait time and increases pallet throughput. Additionally, it reduces transportation costs by optimizing the density of individual pallets, selecting combinations of product cases that lead to more product per unit volume.|$|E

40|$|The {{anaerobic}} {{pyrolysis of wood}} material used to <b>palletize</b> commodities is {{studied in}} a Fire Propagation Apparatus (FPA) {{for a range of}} heating conditions relevant to fires. The data collected, consisting of mass loss rate, cumulative mass loss, and surface temperature, are used to determine model-specific material properties using inverse modeling and optimization methodologies previously developed in our laboratory. However, in this study, considerable effort is placed on determining the radiation environment that characterizes the FPA tests as well as how the radiation interacts with the samples. This is done {{on the basis of the}} recognition that boundary conditions have a pronounced effect on the output of a given pyrolysis model and, thus, the optimization results. The spectral radiance from the FPA heaters as well as the absorptivity/emissivity of the material surface are measured herein. The spectral features of the surface indicate that markedly different effective emissivities and absorptivities can be exhibited by the material depending on the spectral distribution of incident radiation. These effects are included in the pyrolysis model used to extract model-specific material properties so that the optimization process can, in a sense, be decoupled from boundary conditions. Therefore, it is expected that the approach described in this study can ensure that the derived model-specific properties can be applied to practical scenarios that are characterized by radiation environments that differ from those in bench-scale test apparatuses such as the FPA...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—A wafer-level {{packaging}} strategy for micro device chips based on uniquely orienting self-assembly is {{presented with the}} following steps: 1) bulk parts are uniquely face-oriented and spread in a single layer; 2) parts are palletized onto an alignment template having an array of receptor sites; 3) parts are anchored one-to-one to the receptor sites; 4) each anchored part is fixed to a unique in-plane orientation. We demonstrate all of these steps with two different self-organizing parallel assembly (SPASS) processes: a semidry uniquely orienting process (semi-DUO-SPASS) and a dry uniquely orienting (DUO-SPASS) process. The semidry process exploits: 1) an agitated air/water interface to uniquely face-orient bulk parts having a single hydrophobic face; 2) a hydrophobic carrier wafer to <b>palletize</b> the parts in an air environment; 3) orbital shaking to drive the parts until they are anchored to receptor sites; 4) gravity to uniquely align the parts. Experiments show that 2 -mm square silicon parts are correctly registered on a 4 -in alignment template having 164 receptor sites with a defect rate of 1 % after 3 min orbital shaking. The dry process utilizes: 1) asymmetry in dynamic stability to uniquely face-orient bulk parts having protruding features on one face; 2) orbital shaking to drive the parts until they are first anchored to receptor sites and then fixed in well-defined in-plane orientations by two-stage shape recognition. In our experiments, 1 -mm square silicon parts are assembled with a defect rate of 2 % in 10 min on each of two 4 -in alignment templates having, respectively, 397 and 720 receptor sites.

40|$|Abstract: 4 -DOF (Four {{degrees of}} freedom) <b>palletizing</b> robot {{is widely used}} in our country, which is playing a more and more {{important}} role in the logistics automation. The important indicators of ER 300 <b>palletizing</b> robot performances include strength, stiffness, and ER 300 <b>palletizing</b> robot weight, which mainly depend on the structural design of ER 300 palletiz-ing robot. So it is of importance to research on the structural optimization design by means of finite element analysis (FEA), ADMAS and Matlab. In this paper, the framework of structural optimization design is proposed. Secondly, taking ER 300 <b>palletizing</b> robot as research object, its structure is described and the finite element (FE) model of the <b>palletizing</b> robot is developed for the finite element analysis. Thirdly, to ensure the reliability {{of the results of the}} analysis, stress and strain experiment is carried out to validate the analysis results. Finally, the structural optimization design of major parts has been completed. The results show that structural optimization design can reduce total mass of ER 300 <b>palletizing</b> robot greatly by using the finite element analysis and optimization technology premised on the design requirements of palletiz-ing robot such as stiffness, strength and so on, thus the structural optimization design can be achieved...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Modern <b>palletizing</b> {{systems are}} {{designed}} mainly for performance and flexibility. In today’s competitive scenario, {{the cost of}} <b>palletizing</b> system,its installation lead time and its proper integration with material transport system present inside the plant are the factors of major concern for any industrial engineer. At {{the same time the}} system he designs, should be flexible enough to accommodate some basic anticipated changes with minimum setup time. Industrial Robots and Automated Inline Palletizers are widely used in industries for the <b>palletizing</b> operation. But neither of these provides a complete solution. Eg Automated Inline Palletizers are fast enough but cannot handle situations involving 1. drastic changes in carton sizes and 2. different pallet layer configurations. It is because of lack of programmability. On the contrary, robots are programmable but consumes programming downtime. The present paper proposes a model of an entire <b>palletizing</b> cell which is not only cost effective, but also flexible enough to accommodate frequent changes in sizes of cartons with almost negligible setup time and therefore negligible downtime. The paper describes the schematic configuration of proposed model as well as it explains how this model conquers the limitations of present available <b>palletizing</b> facilities mentioned above...|$|R
