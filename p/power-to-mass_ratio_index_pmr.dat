40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article was to {{establish}} whether previously reported oxygen-to-mass ratios, used to predict flat and hill-climbing cycling performance, extend to similar <b>power-to-mass</b> <b>ratios</b> incorporating other, often quick and convenient measures of power output recorded in the laboratory [maximum aerobic power (W(MAP)), power output at ventilatory threshold (W(VT)) and average power output (W(AVG)) maintained during a 1 h performance test]. A proportional allometric model was used to predict the optimal <b>power-to-mass</b> <b>ratios</b> associated with cycling speeds during flat and hill-climbing cycling. The optimal models predicting flat time-trial cycling speeds were found to be (W(MAP) m(- 0. 48)) (0. 54), (W(VT) m(- 0. 48)) (0. 46) and (W(AVG) m(- 0. 34)) (0. 58) that explained 69. 3, 59. 1 and 96. 3 % of the variance in cycling speeds, respectively. Cross-validation results suggest that, in conjunction with body mass, W(MAP) can provide an accurate and independent prediction of time-trial cycling, explaining 94. 6 % of the variance in cycling speeds with the standard deviation about the regression line, s= 0. 686 km h(- 1). Based on these models, there is evidence to support that previously reported VO 2 -to-mass ratios associated with flat cycling speed extend to other laboratory-recorded measures of power output (i. e. Wm(- 0. 32)). However, the power-function exponents (0. 54, 0. 46 and 0. 58) would appear to conflict with the assumption that the cyclists' speeds should be proportional to the cube root (0. 33) of power demand/expended, a finding that could be explained by other confounding variables such as bicycle geometry, tractional resistance and/or the presence of a tailwind. The models predicting 6 and 12 % hill-climbing cycling speeds were found to be proportional to (W(MAP) m(- 0. 91)) (0. 66), revealing a mass exponent, 0. 91, that also supports previous research...|$|R

Sprint success is determined {{largely by the}} <b>power-to-mass</b> <b>ratio,</b> so sprinters aim to increase muscle mass and power. However, extra mass that does not increase power may be detrimental. Energy and protein intake are important for increasing muscle mass. If energy balance is maintained, increased mass and strength are possible {{on a wide range}} of protein intakes, so energy intake is crucial. Most sprinters likely consume ample protein. The quantity of energy and protein intake necessary for optimal training adaptations depends on the individual athlete and training demands; specific recommendations for all sprinters are, at best, useless, and are potentially harmful. However, if carbohydrate and fat intake are sufficient to maintain energy levels, then increased protein intake is unlikely to be detrimental. The type and timing of protein intake and nutrients ingested concurrently must be considered when designing optimal nutritional strategies for increasing muscle mass and power. On race day, athletes should avoid foods that result in gastrointestinal discomfort, dehydration or sluggishness. Several supplements potentially influence sprint training or performance. Beta-alanine and bicarbonate may be useful as buffering agents in longer sprints. Creatine may be efficacious for increasing muscle mass and strength and perhaps increasing intensity of repeat sprint performance during training. status: publishe...|$|R

Slightly higher mass exponents were observed when the mass predictor was replaced with the combined mass of cyclist and equipment (m (C)). Uphill cycling speed was proportional to (V O (2 max). m (C) (- 1. 33)) (0. 57) and (RMP (max). m (C) (- 1. 10)) (0. 59). The curvilinear exponents, 0. 54 - 0. 59, identified a relatively strong curvilinear relationship between cycling speed and energy cost, suggesting that air resistance remains influential when cycling up a gradient of 5. 4 %.

Due to the reliable, operational and non-destructive advantages, hyperspectral remote sensing plays a significant role for assessing and monitoring chlorophyll content. In the study, a few of typical vegetation indices (VI) with the combination of 670 nm and 800 nm band reflectance, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Modified Simple <b>Ratio</b> <b>index</b> (MSR), Modified Chlorophyll Absorption <b>Ratio</b> <b>Index</b> (MCARI), Transformed Chlorophyll Absorption <b>Ratio</b> <b>Index</b> (TCARI), and Optimized Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (OSAVI) are modified by using 705 nm and 750 nm band reflectance so as to reduce the effect of spectral saturation in 660 - 680 nm absorptive band region, and then used to assess the rice chlorophyll content. The result shows that the five mentioned VIs have better correlation with rice chlorophyll content while using 705 nm and 750 nm. In addition, in the study the Weight optimization combination (WOC) principle is utilized to further assess the capacity of the five modified VIs for estimating rice chlorophyll content, it is proved that OSAVI and MSR display the better performance...|$|R
