25|$|One way to {{alleviate}} {{this is to}} use a copolymer. Comonomers such as CHDM or isophthalic acid lower the melting temperature and reduce the degree of crystallinity of PET (especially important when the material is used for bottle manufacturing). Thus, the resin can be plastically formed at lower temperatures and/or with lower force. This helps to prevent degradation, reducing the acetaldehyde content of the finished product to an acceptable (that is, unnoticeable) level. See copolymers, above. Another way to improve the stability of the polymer is to use stabilizers, mainly antioxidants such as <b>phosphites.</b> Recently, molecular level stabilization of the material using nanostructured chemicals has also been considered.|$|E
25|$|Following that, {{that was}} a period of {{experimentation}} of different techniques and chemicals using creosote in tuberculosis, which lasted until about 1910, when radiation therapy looked to be a more promising treatment. Guaiacol, instead of a full creosote solution, was suggested by Hermann Sahli in 1887; he argued it had the active chemical of creosote and had the advantage of being of definite composition and of having a less unpleasant taste and odor. A number of solutions of both creosote and guaiacol appeared on the market, such as phosphotal and guaicophosphal, <b>phosphites</b> of creosote and guaiacol; eosot and geosot, valerinates of creosote and guaicol; phosot and taphosot, phosphate and tannophospate of creosote; and creosotal and tanosal, tannates of creosote. Creosote and eucalptus oil were also a remedy used together, administered through a vaporizor and inhaler. Since then, more effective and safer treatments for tuberculosis have been developed.|$|E

In this study, salicylic acid (SA) was investigated as an alternative, or supplementary, treatment to be used to protect plant species. With the use of aeroponics chambers, foliar application of <b>phosphite,</b> SA, and phosphite/SA to Lupinus augustifolius was assessed in relation to root tip damage, in planta <b>phosphite</b> and SA concentration and lesion development.

40|$|Although <b>phosphite</b> {{has been}} {{effective}} in the control of P. cinnamomi in E. marginata (jarrah), the biochemical mechanisms behind <b>phosphite</b> protection are poorly understood. Using an aeroponics system, jarrah clones with moderate resistance to P. cinnamomi were treated with foliar applications of <b>phosphite</b> (0 and 5 g L− 1). The roots were inoculated with zoospores of P. cinnamomi at 4 days before and 0, 2, 5, 8 and 14 days after <b>phosphite</b> treatment.

It was concluded from these studies that the effect of <b>phosphite</b> in controlling the pathogen is determined by the <b>phosphite</b> concentration at the host–pathogen interface.

40|$|The soil borne plant {{pathogen}} Phytophthora cinnamomi has irreversibly altered the make-up {{and diversity of}} the plant communities found in Australia. Recently, the fungicide <b>phosphite</b> {{has been used to}} effectively reduce the impact of this pathogen in natural plant communities. However, little is known (a) about how rapidly <b>phosphite</b> is diluted in the tissues of rapidly growing plants and (b) how soil and plant phosphate levels interact with <b>phosphite</b> and its ability to induce host-resistant responses when challenged by P. cinnamomi. This study examined the effects of different <b>phosphite</b> rates (0, 24 and 48 kg/ha <b>phosphite)</b> applied as a mist application on three size classes of Banksia grand is, as well as the interaction of phosphate status on two Eucalyptus marginata forest vegetation types differing in soil phosphate status with <b>phosphite.</b> It also examined, under controlled glasshouse conditions, the effects different soil phosphate levels had on in planta <b>phosphite</b> and phosphate levels in B. hookeriana, and the subsequent control of P. cinnamomi. This study was the first to look at the role of phosphate in the soil and the plant, and its interaction with <b>phosphite</b> and the subsequent control of P. cinnamomi in planta. Results from the field trial indicated that phosphate in the soil did not {{play a role in the}} reducing the uptake of <b>phosphite</b> by the plant. It did suggest that stem and root colonisation was increased when phosphate in the soil was more plentiful. Further research is needed into this area. This study was also the first to look at the distribution of <b>phosphite</b> in planta. The highest concentration of <b>phosphite</b> was in the leaves, followed by the stem and then roots. Ph 9 sphite in the plant tissue was found to increase as the <b>phosphite</b> applied to 5 the plants increased. Plants classed as seedlings showed more phytotoxic symptoms than the intermediate and semi-mature plants. The concentration of <b>phosphite</b> in the roots of the intermediate sized plants was more than double the amount found in the seedling and semi-mature plants. The concentration of <b>phosphite</b> in the whole plant, as well as in the leaves and stems per plant, increased as the plant size increased. This was supported by results that showed that as the dry weight of the leaves increased so did the amount of <b>phosphite</b> in the leaves. The same was seen with the dry weights of the stems and roots that correlated with <b>phosphite</b> in the stem and the roots, respectively. Lesions and P. cinnamomi colonisation in the stems of non-phosphite treated plants were more than double those in stems of plants treated with 24 and 48 kg/ha <b>phosphite.</b> There was very little difference in the visible lesion lengths and P. cinnamomi colonisation between plants treated with 24 and 48 kglha of <b>phosphite</b> even though plants sprayed with 48 kg/ha <b>phosphite</b> had significantly more <b>phosphite</b> in their tissues than plants sprayed with 24 kg/ha <b>phosphite.</b> This suggests that the <b>phosphite</b> in the plant may have been metabolised into another substance and that this substance was acting on the pathogen and/or the plant to reduce colonisation. This was further supported by no observed correlation between <b>phosphite</b> in the plant tissue and the extent of colonisation or visible stem lesion caused by P. cinnamomi. This was contradictory to other results in this study (Chapter 2) that clearly showed that <b>phosphite</b> did restrict the colonisation of the pathogen. Further research is needed into the mode of action of <b>phosphite.</b> In the glasshouse trial, a non-invasive inoculation technique failed to infect B. hookeriana plants with the pathogen. However, this is likely due to very high ambient temperatures experienced during the trial, since a preliminary trial 18 days earlier resulted in extensive colonisation of all plants inoculated. As phosphate levels increased, stem colonisation by the pathogen increased in the presence of <b>phosphite.</b> There was no difference in the concentration of <b>phosphite</b> in the leaves. As <b>phosphite</b> applied increased, so did the concentration of <b>phosphite</b> in the root tissue. This study shows that phosphate does interact with <b>phosphite</b> and the subsequent expression of P. cinnamomi, and as phosphate levels increased in planta so did the extent of colonisation by the pathogen.
