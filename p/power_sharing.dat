5|$|Not {{having been}} {{involved}} in the coup d'état, Rainilaiarivony provided direction for his brother {{and the rest of the}} court as they grappled with the gravity of their acts. He proposed that future monarchs would no longer have absolute power but would instead rule by the consent of the nobles. A series of terms were proposed by Rainilaiarivony that the nobles agreed to impose on Radama's widow, Rasoherina. Under Rainilaiarivony's new monarchy, a sovereign required the consent of the nobles to issue a death sentence or promulgate a new law, and was forbidden to disband the army. The new <b>power</b> <b>sharing</b> agreement was concluded by a political marriage between the queen and the Prime Minister.|$|E
5|$|Following the coup, the courtiers offered Radama's queen Rasoherina (1863–68) the {{opportunity}} to rule, if she would accept a <b>power</b> <b>sharing</b> arrangement with the Prime Minister—a new social contract that would be sealed by a political marriage between them. Queen Rasoherina accepted, first wedding Rainivoninahitriniony, then later deposing him and wedding his brother, Prime Minister Rainilaiarivony (1864–95), who {{would go on to}} marry Queen Ranavalona II (1868–83) and Queen Ranavalona III (1883–97) in succession. Over the course of Rainilaiarivony's 31-year tenure as prime minister, numerous policies were adopted to modernize and consolidate the power of the central government. Schools were constructed throughout the island and attendance was made mandatory. Army organization was improved, and British consultants were employed to train and professionalize soldiers. Polygamy was outlawed and Christianity, declared the official religion of the court in 1869, was adopted alongside traditional beliefs among a growing portion of the populace. Legal codes were reformed on the basis of British common law and three European-style courts were established in the capital city. In his joint role as Commander-in-Chief, Rainilaiarivony also successfully ensured the defense of Madagascar against several French colonial incursions.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} deteriorated {{in early}} 1993, when the teams in Arusha signed a full <b>power</b> <b>sharing</b> agreement, dividing government positions between the MRND, RPF {{and other major}} opposition parties, but excluding the CDR. This government was supposed to rule the country under a transitional constitution until {{free and fair elections}} could be held. The agreement was reasonably equitable given the balance of power at the time and Habyarimana, the mainstream opposition and the RPF all accepted it; however, the CDR and hardline MRND officers were violently opposed. MRND national secretary Mathieu Ngirumpatse announced that the party would not respect the agreement, contradicting both the president and the party's negotiators in Arusha. The MRND hardliners organised demonstrations across the country and mobilised their supporters within the army and populace to begin a much larger scale killing spree than those that had previously occurred. The violence engulfed the whole northwest of Rwanda and lasted for six days, with numerous houses burned and hundreds of Tutsi killed. Paul Kagame, reacting to stories brought to him first hand by survivors seeking refuge in rebel territory, announced that he was pulling out of the Arusha process and resuming the war, ending the six month cease-fire.|$|E

A Karzai spokesman indicated that both foreign and Afghan officials were proffering formulas for <b>power</b> <b>sharing,</b> but that Karzai had rejected them and would not discuss <b>power</b> <b>sharing</b> until after a winner is declared.

25|$|The Vanguard Unionist Progressive Party (VUPP), informally {{known as}} Ulster Vanguard, was a unionist {{political}} party which existed in Northern Ireland between 1972 and 1978. Led by William Craig, the party {{emerged from a}} split in the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) and was closely affiliated with several loyalist paramilitary groups. The presence of features such as an honour guard and a common salute led opponents to accuse it of being fascist. The party {{was set up in}} opposition to <b>power</b> <b>sharing</b> with Irish nationalist parties. It opposed the Sunningdale Agreement and was involved in extra-parliamentary activity against the agreement. However, in 1975, during discussions on the constitutional status of Northern Ireland in the constitutional convention, William Craig suggested the possibility of voluntary <b>power</b> <b>sharing</b> with the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour Party. In consequence the party split, with dissenters forming the United Ulster Unionist Party. Thereafter Vanguard declined and following poor results in the 1977 local government elections, Craig merged the remainder of Vanguard into the UUP in February 1978.|$|E
