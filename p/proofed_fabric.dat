50|$|Rubber {{was also}} widely used for waterproofs {{during the nineteenth}} century and {{although}} not breathable was highly versatile and widely used. In 1823 Charles Macintosh patented a double textured fabric sandwiched around a layer of rubber. The Mackintosh became the synonym for the rain coat. Improved Macintosh was extremely versatile and was developed for fashionable wear and sporting activity and was made by numerous Manchester manufacturers. Other waterproof and wind <b>proof</b> <b>fabrics,</b> such as Burberry, Grenfell and Ventile were developed from the late nineteenth century. By the early 1960s wartime-developed materials including Nylon and PVC had come to the commercial market in volume. The development of synthetic polymers innovation began in the 1920s gathering pace during and after the Second World War, though it took time for light, breathable waterproofs to be developed.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{influence}} of waterproof fabrics on heat and moisture transfer through a clothing system. The water vapor permeability (WVP) for the outside layer was derived from published experimental data, and {{was considered to be}} a factor influencing the mass transfer coefficient at the boundary exposed to the environment. The analysis was carried out by using a mathematical model that describes the coupled heat and moisture transfer in porous textiles. The numerical simulation reveals a significant influence of water <b>proof</b> <b>fabrics</b> on the dynamic moisture content distribution in fabrics/fibers, moisture vapor condensations and the liquid transfer behavior inside the clothing. The research has shown the potential usage of the mathematical simulation in evaluating the performance of different waterproof and breathable fabrics in clothing systems, as well as the potential usage in the product development of functional apparel.

50|$|The {{original}} design was short sleeved, {{long in the}} back, and would be worn on top of work clothes for warmth and shower proofing. During production, these garments were dipped into a secret mixture and then dried. It is not known if Broome had been taught the method for shower <b>proofing</b> the <b>fabric</b> he used or whether he developed the formula himself. The mixture caused the garments to shrink unevenly so were sold as one size fits all.|$|R
30|$|Surgical gown {{should be}} made out of liquid <b>proof</b> <b>fabric</b> to protect the {{blood-borne}} infectious microbes from penetrating through the fabric. Risks of patients are contamination from both endogenous and exogenous microorganisms and risk of healthcare workers are contamination from various blood-borne pathogens due to occupational exposure to patient blood and body fluids (Unsal et al. 2005). Surgical gowns should provide an effective protective barrier against the transfer of microorganisms, particulates and fluids, in addition to acting as an aseptic barrier for the patient’s protection, {{in order to minimize}} strike-through and the potential for personnel contamination (Rutala and Weber 2001). Due to the prevalence of HIV and hepatitis B and C viruses in the patient population, the barrier efficacy of protective surgical gowns have gained importance. During surgery, in an operating room, a patient’s blood can penetrate surgical gown material and possibly contaminate the surgeon’s skin, if not well protected. Several blood borne pathogens have the potential to spread in this manner, the most important being the HIV and the hepatitis B virus, which are related to AIDS and hepatitis (Loveday et al. 2007).|$|R
40|$|Technology which renders aramid fibrous {{structures}} {{flame resistant}} through chemical modification was developed. The project scaled up flame resistant treatment from laboratory fabric swatches {{of a few}} inches to efficiently producing ten yards of commercial width (41 inches) aromatic polyamide. The radiation intensity problem of the processor was resolved. Further improvement of the processor cooling system was recommended for two reasons: (1) To advance current technology of flame <b>proofing</b> Nomex <b>fabric</b> to higher oxygen enriched atmospheres; and (2) To adapt the processor for direct applicability to low cost commercial fabrics...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{simultaneous}} use of conventional fire-retardant additives and an insulative intumescent thermal barrier/mat {{to improve the}} fire performance and mechanical property retention of glass-fibre-reinforced polyester (GRP) composites. Significant reductions in the peak heat release rate (PHRR) and total heat release (THR) were observed from measured cone calorimetric data following the addition of nitrogen, phosphorous, halogen containing and hydroxylated fire-retardant additives. Some fire-retarded glass-fibre-reinforced composites further protected by an intumescent mat containing silicate fibres, expandable graphite and borosilicate glass bound together by an organic matrix show further reductions in PHRR. Despite improving the fire retardancy of the composites, the presence of fire-retardant additives alone does not improve flexural modulus retention following exposure to a heat source. However, {{the introduction of a}} &# 039;passive&# 039; fire <b>proofing</b> insulative <b>fabric</b> enhances fire performance while preserving the mechanical properties of composites exposed to high heat fluxes or fires...|$|R
50|$|The most {{conclusive}} <b>proof</b> {{against the}} <b>fabric</b> hypothesis {{is in the}} photographs of the actual accident {{as well as the}} many airships which were not doped with aluminum powder and still exploded violently. When a single gas cell explodes, it creates a shock wave and heat. The shock wave tends to rip nearby bags which then explode themselves. In the case of the Ahlhorn disaster on January 5, 1918, explosions of airships in one hangar caused the explosions of others in three adjoining hangars, wiping out all five Zeppelins at the base.|$|R

40|$|A {{method is}} {{described}} for comparing {{the resistance to}} penetration by aqueous fluids, under rubbing contact, of a representative series of fabrics. Untreated woven fabrics are rapidly penetrated, but some non-woven synthetic materials resist penetration for much longer and tightly woven <b>proofed</b> cotton <b>fabrics</b> for prolonged periods, even after repeated washing and sterilizing. If a wetting agent is added to water, penetration occurs more quickly, but fabrics containing natural cotton are penetrated more slowly by serum. The same fabrics were examined by a test designed to simulate transfer of dry particulate material, e. g. skin scales, through them during nursing contact. The proportionate differences observed were much greater than for air dispersal during exercise and closely resembled those obtained by a laboratory rubbing test. In particular, one of the non-woven fabrics showed much greater relative penetration when examined by these methods than the relative dispersal of skin scales through it during exercise...|$|R

Clothes which make the user too hot, or which prevent the user moving easily, are a safety problem in themselves. A worker unable to move easily and/or suffering from being too hot is not safe. Extra fabric layers are added to clothing to improve cut resistance, but clothes which cannot be cut at all by a powerful saw are impractical, even with modern fibres. Additionally saw and chain technology seems to be outstripping fabric technology. It {{is almost impossible to}} protect against high power saws employing aggressive cutting chains.|$|R
40|$|Abstract ― It is {{commonly}} known that water repellency {{of the fabric}} treated with fluorocarbon resin brings about a decrease by the washing and recovers by the subsequent heat treatment. In this article, effect of the water repellency was investigated on the nylon 6, triacetate and silk fabrics treated with hydrocarbon and silicon resins. Hydrocarbon and silicon resins {{have been widely used}} in the textile finishing as the softening and water <b>proofing</b> agents. The <b>fabrics</b> were treated with hydrocarbon resins, Paragium JQ and RC (Ohara Paragium Chemical Co.) and a silicon resin, Poron MR (Shinetsu Chemical Co.), and then washed and subsequently heat treated. Although the water repellency increased by the resin treatment, it decreased by the washing apparently and recovered a little by the heat treatment. The effect of the heat treatment was small comparing with that of the fluorocarbon resin. Furthermore, as a mechanical property of the treated fabric, KES shearing and bending hysteresis parameters, modulus and hysteresis width of the hydrocarbon resin-treated nylon 6, triacetate and silk fabrics decreased by the heat treatment after washing. Therefore, the treatment is effective at improving the softening of the fabric in water repellent finish...|$|R
