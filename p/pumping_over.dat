25|$|The Syrian {{government}} has {{at various times}} considered two alternative mega-projects to bring additional water to the Greater Damascus area. One plan consisted in the transfer {{of water from the}} coastal region over a distance of at least 225km and a cumulated difference in altitude of about 1000m. The water sources considered were two reservoirs in the coastal basin and even offshore springs in the Mediterranean or desalination of seawater at a total cost of more than US$1 per cubic meter including its transfer. By 2010 this plan was considered to have been abandoned. The other plan consists in building a pipeline from the Euphrates River. In 2006 Syrian officials said they were “pressing ahead” with a feasibility study by a Swiss company to transfer water from the Euphrates to Damascus at an estimated cost of US$2 billion. The project would involve conveying water from Lake Assad, some 441 kilometers away with <b>pumping</b> <b>over</b> an altitude of 712 meters. A capacity of 850 million m3 per annum has been envisaged, about twice the current water deficit in Greater Damascus. The cost for bulk water before distribution losses would be more than US$0.50 per cubic meter.|$|E

50|$|The Stars' {{biggest problem}} was Downing Stadium. Despite Schmertz <b>pumping</b> <b>over</b> $200,000 into renovations, it was {{completely}} inadequate even as a temporary facility. Located on {{an island in the}} East River and accessible primarily on foot, it was nearly inaccessible from most parts of the city, and it had not been well maintained in at least 20 years. (Indeed, it had hosted little football in that time, most notably a partial season of the old Continental Football League.) The field was mostly sand and dirt. Amenities for fans, players and the press were virtually nonexistent. The toilets in the locker room frequently overflowed. During the home opener, the Stars' radio announcers John Sterling and Matt Snell had to sit on orange crates because there were no chairs in the press box; their Birmingham counterparts had to stand. Parking and lighting were both inadequate. It soon became obvious that Schmertz and Baldwin wouldn't have enough money to finish the season. With the Stars over a million dollars in debt and unable to afford to upgrade Downing Stadium to anything approaching professional standards, the WFL resigned itself to abandoning the nation's biggest market.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to {{evaluate}} the financial feasibility of implementing an automated gas injection system from Pulsair {{as an alternative to}} the traditional <b>pump</b> <b>over</b> cap mixing technique that is used during the alcoholic fermentation stage of winemaking. There were various costs involved in this project that were determined and explained through the use of the partial budgeting method. The costs that were thoroughly analyzed included equipment, labor, utility, and initial investment costs for the Pulsair system as well as the related <b>pump</b> <b>over</b> operation costs. After the two methods associated numbers were evaluated, they were then transferred into Excel spread sheets where it was determined that the initial investment for the Pulsair system would be considerably higher. It was also concluded that even if the utility cost (the major cost factor in the difference of the systems) for the Pulsair system was multiplied 200 times, the total operating cost for the automated system would still be considerably less than the <b>Pump</b> <b>Over</b> method. After further assessment of the figures, it has been concluded that it would be a feasible endeavor for wineries seeking expansion, as well as for future start-up wineries to implement the Pulsair system with expected profitability after the first year of operations...|$|R
