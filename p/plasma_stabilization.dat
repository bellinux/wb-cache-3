Ring canal assembly is a step-wise process that transforms an arrested cleavage furrow into a stable intercellular bridge by the addition of several proteins.

Mutants in cheerio fail to localize ring canal inner rim proteins including filamentous actin, the ring canal-associated products from the hu-li tai shao (hts) gene, and kelch. Since hts and kelch are present but unlocalized in cheerio mutant cells, cheerio is likely to function upstream from each of them.

On account of these properties, these molecules are ideal targets for development of new therapeutic and agronomic agents. However, these proteins are of low abundance, which limits their study. Although yeast seems ideal for expressing heterologous transporters, plasma membrane proteins are often retained in intracellular compartments. We tried to find yeast mutants potentially able to improve functional expression of a whole set of heterologous transporters. We focused on Arabidopsis thaliana ureide transporter 1 (AtUPS 1), previously cloned by functional complementation in yeast.

Concomitantly, the therapeutic window for levodopa narrowed and the levodopa dose-antiparkinsonian response slope increased. The antiparkinsonian threshold dose correlated best with duration of symptoms; the dyskinesia threshold dose, therapeutic window, and dose-response slope related most closely with the duration of levodopa treatment. The differing dose-response profiles for the antiparkinsonian and dyskinetic effects suggest involvement of separate pharmacological mechanisms. The present results, taken together with previous observations that the wearing-off phenomenon responds promptly to <b>plasma</b> levodopa <b>stabilization</b> while on-off fluctuations tend to diminish over several days, suggest that postsynaptic modifications, presumably at the receptor level, serve as the major determinant for the increasing difficulty with optimal dose adjustment and the motor fluctuations, especially of the on-off type, which complicate levodopa therapy of patients with advanced Parkinson's disease...|$|R

This fact {{leads to the}} controversy whether attained HT concentrations after olive oil polyphenol ingestion are too low to explain the observed biological activities. Due to this, an analytical methodology to determine free HT in plasma is crucial for understanding HT biological activity. Plasma HT instability and low concentrations have been major limitations for its quantification in clinical studies. Here, we describe a method to detect and quantify free HT in human plasma by using liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. The method encompasses different steps of sample preparation including <b>plasma</b> <b>stabilization,</b> protein precipitation, selective derivatization with benzylamine, and purification by solid-phase extraction. A high sensitivity (LOD, 0. 3 ng/mL), specificity and stability of HT is achieved following these procedures. The method was validated and its applicability was demonstrated by analyzing human plasma samples after olive oil intake. A pharmacokinetic comparison was performed measuring free HT plasma concentrations following the intake of 25 mL of ordinary olive oil (nearly undetectable concentrations) versus an extra-virgin olive oil (Cmax= 4. 40 ng/mL). To our knowledge, {{this is the first}} time that an analytical procedure for quantifying free HT in plasma after olive oil dietary doses has been reported.

40|$|While the Tokamak is {{considered}} as very promising nuclear fusion energy source, {{people are still}} struggling to stabilize the complicated plasma behavior to eventually {{make it as a}} practical future energy source. The first step of such a path may be diagnosing the plasma status inside the Tokamak. More specifically, understanding the procedure of laminar plasma converting into a turbulent flow {{is one of the key}} issue in <b>plasma</b> <b>stabilization.</b> For that purpose, various plasma diagnostic tools have been developed for exact, in-situ detecting of the plasma status. MIR, the microwave-imaging-reflectometry, is one such a tool, recently proposed. This is the extension of the previously known reflectometry, which is basically a pin-pointing technique, to a one-shot imaging technique of the plasma density distribution using the curvature-matching concept. Since MIR is a new concept, and has not been fully proved of its validity, some intensive theoretical and simulation studies are required. To meet those needs, a fluid-like FWR code has been developed in PPPL. However, due to its original nature that it handles the plasma as a 'static' dielectric material, it cannot be effectively extended to the regime of fast plasma flow, or turbulence, i. e. the kinetic regime. In this project, we developed a particle-in-cell (PIC) code to simulate self-consistently such a kinetic effects. A full 1 / 2 / 3 D PIC code with high-order current acquisition and interpolation routines has been completed along with open-boundary field solver, which is quite useful in calculating a continuous microwave launching. The final goal of the project is benchmarking the PIC simulation against the FWR 2 D, for which we obtained excellent agreements between the results from two different codes. In this way, we accomplished successfully everything we intended to do at the beginning of the research, and now are ready to jump onto more complicated simulations involving dynamic plasma flow and turbulence. Along with those major project goals, we also performed a couple of basic science research regarding the X-mode absorption and Raman scattering in a magnetized plasma.

40|$|We {{present the}} results of fast time scale plasma control {{simulations}} for the proposed Korea Superconducting Tokamak Advanced Research (KSTAR) tokamak. Here, the fast <b>plasma</b> control includes <b>stabilization</b> of the vertical instability and rapid radial position control. As a simulation tool, we use the tokamak simulation code (TSC). We evaluate the power supply requirements for both the vertical and radial position control with a similar approach to that which was employed {{in the analysis of}} the tokamak physics experiments (TPX). In particular, we investigate the efficacy of control coil locations to minimize the power supply requirements. From this study, it is shown that two separate sets of control coils, one responsible for vertical control and the other responsible for radial control, are required to provide robust control of both vertical and radial position for all the anticipated plasmas in KSTA...|$|R
40|$|An {{electron}} density bubble driven in a rarefied uniform plasma by a slowly evolving laser pulse goes through periods of adiabatically slow expansions and contractions. Bubble expansion causes robust self-injection of initially quiescent <b>plasma</b> electrons, whereas <b>stabilization</b> and contraction terminate self-injection thus limiting injected charge; concomitant phase space rotation reduces the bunch energy spread. In regimes relevant to experiments with hundred terawatt- to petawatt-class lasers, bubble dynamics and, hence, the self-injection process are governed {{primarily by the}} driver evolution. Collective transverse fields of the trapped electron bunch reduce the accelerating gradient and slow down phase space rotation. Bubble expansion followed by stabilization and contraction suppresses the low-energy background and creates a collimated quasi-monoenergetic electron bunch long before dephasing. Nonlinear evolution of the laser pulse (spot size oscillations, self-compression, and front steepening) can also cause continuous self-injection, resulting in a large dark current, degrading the electron beam quality...|$|R

Apolipoproteins are very heterogeneous protein family, implicated in <b>plasma</b> lipoprotein structural <b>stabilization,</b> lipid metabolism, inflammation, or immunity. Obtaining detailed information on apolipoprotein composition and structure may contribute to elucidating lipoprotein roles in atherogenesis and to developing new therapeutic strategies {{for the treatment of}} lipoprotein-associated disorders. This study aimed at developing a comprehensive method for characterizing the apolipoprotein component of plasma VLDL, LDL, and HDL fractions from patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy, by means of two-dimensional electrophoresis (2 -DE) coupled with Mass Spectrometry analysis, useful for identifying potential markers of plaque presence and vulnerability. The adopted method allowed obtaining reproducible 2 -DE maps of exchangeable apolipoproteins from VLDL, LDL...|$|R
