50|$|In addition, Songdo IBD {{utilizes}} a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>waste</b> disposal system. This {{means no}} garbage cans on street corners, and no garbage trucks. Instead, garbage is thrown into pipes that will suck the garbage underground, disposing of waste, and recycling {{what can be}} recycled.|$|E
50|$|Regarding infrastructures, 14,800 lm {{of streets}} have been urbanized-of {{a total of}} 37 km—which equals 19,649 m2 of streets—with {{a high level of}} services, 46 new conducts, sewers, {{selective}} <b>pneumatic</b> <b>waste</b> collection, district heating and cooling system, 47,000 m of dark fiber optics, etc.|$|E
50|$|It {{is common}} {{practice}} to lock sites using pneumatic non-return valves during the loading or transferring of chemicals or hazardous <b>waste.</b> <b>Pneumatic</b> non-return valves {{have a longer}} service life when compared to pneumatic bladder systems.|$|R
40|$|Flushing {{transfer}} pipe after {{radioactive waste}} transfers generates thousands {{of gallons of}} additional radioactive waste each year at the Hanford site. The use of <b>pneumatic</b> pigging with <b>waste</b> soluble pigs {{as a means to}} clear transfer piping may be an effective alternative to raw water flushes. A feasibility study was performed by a group of senior mechanical engineering students for their senior design project as part of their curriculum at Washington State University. The students divided the feasibility study into three sub-projects involving: (1) materials research, (2) delivery system design, and (3) mockup fabrication and testing. The students screened through twenty-three candidate materials and selected a thermoplastic polymer combined 50 : 50 wt% with sucrose to meet the established material performance criteria. The students also prepared a conceptual design of a remote pneumatic delivery system and constructed a mockup section of transfer pipe for testing the prototype pigs...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} decade, {{sustainability}} {{has become one}} of the key drivers in any human activity and industrial process. Being characterised by a significant demand of raw materials and energy, the construction sector is fully concerned by the challenge of reducing the environmental impact for preserving the limited natural resources employed for producing construction materials. As part of this widespread effort, the present paper deals with the possible use of Recycled Steel Fibers (RSFs) in the production of Fiber-Reinforced Concrete (FRC). Particularly, it investigates the mechanical behaviour of FRCs made with both industrial and recycled steel fibers, the latter being obtained from <b>waste</b> <b>pneumatic</b> tyres. Particularly, it is aimed at quantifying the expected decay in terms of post-cracking toughness induced by the substitution of increasing amounts of the former with an equal quantity of the latter. Therefore, an experimental campaign was carried out at the Laboratory of Materials testing and Structures (LMS) of the University of Salerno (Italy) : specimens of four different mixtures, characterised by the same nominal amount of fibers and different relative proportions of the two kinds of fibers under consideration, were tested both in compression and four-point bending. As expected, no significant influence of fibers emerged in terms of compressive strength, whereas a significant decay of the post-cracking behaviour was observed for higher replacement ratio of RSFs. Particularly, a significant enhancement of the response in bending was generally observed with respect to reference plain concrete specimens, even in the case of all RSF replacement. Further investigations, both experimental and theoretical in nature, are encouraged by the results reported in this paper which is intended as a first contribution to pave the way towards understanding, controlling and predicting the behaviour of concrete with recycled fibers...|$|R
50|$|Songdo IBD is {{a planned}} city in Incheon which has {{incorporated}} {{a number of}} eco-friendly features. These include a central park irrigated with seawater, a subway line, bicycle lanes, rainwater catchment systems, and <b>pneumatic</b> <b>waste</b> collection system. 75% of the waste generated by {{the construction of the}} city will be recycled.|$|E
50|$|The MetroTaifun Automatic Waste Collection System was {{selected}} for Vuores since it consumes {{only a third of}} the energy compared to conventional <b>pneumatic</b> <b>waste</b> collection solutions, and half of the traditional garbage truck and container based collection method. When ready, the system will consist of about 400 waste inlets and 13 km of pipe work. The MetroTaifun automatic waste collection system has initially start to collect waste in the 2012.|$|E
40|$|A four {{component}} {{system was}} developed {{which consists of}} a particle size reduction mechanism, a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>waste</b> transport system, a rotating-paddle incinerator, and a catalytic afterburner to be integrated into a six-man, zero-g subsystem for processing human wastes on board spacecraft. The study included the development of different concepts or functions, the establishment of operational specifications, and a critical evaluation {{for each of the}} four components. A series of laboratory tests was run, and a baseline subsystem design was established. An operational specification was also written in preparation for detailed design and testing of this baseline subsystem...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this article is}} to develop a computer-based simulation model of the use of scrap tire waste in the composition of interlocking concrete blocks. Research was carried out by means of a computer simulation of variations occurring in constituent basic elements of concrete blocks by the insertion of waste tires. Two scenarios were elaborated for the projection of results and Vensim software (VENTANA SYSTEMS, 2011) was used. The main results of the article are there is an economy of 15. 71 % of water in scenario A and 9. 42 % in scenario B; and an economy of 6. 79 % of cement in scenario A and 0. 77 % in scenario B. Finally, we emphasize consumption of 473 tons of scrap in the simulation done in scenario B and 372 tons in scenario A. This suggests that there should be encouragement of the use of <b>pneumatic</b> <b>waste</b> in building concrete blocks...|$|E
40|$|CIVINSAt {{the turn}} of the nineteenth century the {{collection}} and removal of most urban household waste materials was accomplished via local refuse disposal wagons. These refuse vehicles, sometimes referred to as honey wagons (I was not able to ascertain exactly why they were called honey wagons although it probably {{had something to do with}} the refuse carts' similar attraction of flies), would pick-up both a residence's solid and liquid waste, typically on either a weekly or monthly schedule. This practice continued, especially in Europe, until around the early 1920 s when it became more and more common for urbanized areas to design and construct basic waste water collection systems. These sewage systems, using water as both the medium and mechanism for the waste transport, replaced the function of the refuse wagon, at least as far as liquid waste removal was concerned. [...] And just what are the other alternatives to the aforementioned manual collection method? Several ideas and possibilities have been suggested including the conveyance of solid waste via hydraulics (similar to waste water), air-cushion and rubber-tired trolleys, as well as the use of underground conduits with magnetically transported gondolas. However, the one alternative that has shown the most promise and has actually been implemented at various sites throughout both Europe and the United States is the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>waste</b> transport system.

40|$|AbstractThe {{research}} {{results of the}} material, chemical and mineral compositions of waste coal from the processing plant Abashevskaya and carbonaceous argillites from the Korkino coal mine are provided. The technology of waste coal recycling is offered {{that can be used}} in the production of coal fuel for bricks burning and preparation of the raw material for ceramics manufacture. On the basis of the pilot plant tests it is shown that the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>waste</b> classification allows coal residues to be extracted from argillites and a stable ceramic raw material to be obtained for the brick manufacture. Such complex processing of waste coal does not only provide a significant expansion of the raw material base for the production of building materials and generation of additional energy, but will also help to solve environmental problems and improve the environmental situation in industrial regions. Due to the introduction of the patented method of production and rational compositions of the granulated molding materials there is an increase in operational properties of ceramic wall materials produced from the waste coal after secondary processing. The study of thin sections using a polarizing microscope and SEM was conducted to examine the structures of the obtained ceramic cork. It was established that high physical and mechanical properties of the brick were achieved by forming the matrix structure of a ceramic crock, intensive generation of the glass phase at the interphase boundary of the composite material and the temperature reduction of processes of a solid-phase sintering during burning...|$|E
40|$|Scarcity {{of funds}} has arisen {{the need for}} the public sector to seek for new ways to fund {{important}} investments. This has increased the popularity of Public-Private Partnerships, which are found to be a worthy alternative to the traditional procurement methods. Nowadays, these partnership arrangements are widely used in the provision of public services. In a Public-Private Partnership a public operator does not purchase an asset but signs a long-term contract with the private company for the supply of serviced asset. The private company builds and maintains the needed facilities and delivers the acquired services. Instead of a large initial investment, public sector operator makes a regular payment, which covers the use of the asset and provision of the related services. Public sector should pursue Public-Private Partnership only if its overall benefits exceed the benefits of other options. This is normally shown with a value for money analysis, which is a variant of the net present value method. However, decisions to conduct a Public- Private Partnership are not always based on analytical findings. Furthermore, accounting in general is not a neutral instrument but {{it can be used to}} promote or disguise decision- makers motives. Many studies have questioned the reliability of the value for money analysis. The purpose of this study is to identify characteristics of decision-making practices in Finnish public-private-partnerships thorough a case study. Empirical data was collected by interviews and observations of a competitive tendering of a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>waste</b> collection system. This study shows how public sector decision-making is a complex task that may dilute responsibility. Additionally, it reinforces the assumption that public sector decision- making is often focused on economical aspects. This study also highlights the weakness of the value for money analysis to disregard the fall back position, an option where the public sector decides to provide the needed services with already existing infrastructures...|$|E
