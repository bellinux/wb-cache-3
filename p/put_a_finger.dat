5|$|While {{travelling}} {{on a train}} Abbe {{noticed an}} older man staring at him who then {{asked if he was}} a 5th Dan Judo. Abbe replied “Why yes, how did you know that?” “Because you have the build of a 5th Dan. So who are you?“ Kenshiro replied: “Everyone knows who I am, I am Kenshiro Abbe, Judo champion of all Japan! “ Yes, I can see that,“ the old man replied. The old man continued to talk to Kenshiro much to his annoyance as he wanted to get some sleep. Eventually, the old man <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>finger</b> in Kenshiro’s face, “You are so powerful, break my finger!” Kenshiro was only too happy to oblige. He took the finger, expecting to snap it like a twig, and wham! He found himself on the carriage floor under the full control of the old man. The old man allowed Kenshiro to get back into his seat. “Who are you?” Kenshiro Abbe asked. “I am Morihei Ueshiba, the founder of Aikido.” Kenshiro Abbe was astounded at the technique of the old man and requested that he become his student.|$|E

60|$|But Fedallah, <b>putting</b> <b>a</b> <b>finger</b> on his lip, {{slid over}} the bulwarks {{to take the}} boat's {{steering}} oar, and Ahab, swinging the cutting-tackle towards him commanded the ship's sailors to stand by to lower.|$|R

60|$|She <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>finger</b> to her lips, {{with a quick}} {{peremptory}} {{gesture to}} Dion, then she recrossed the studio with a firm step and the curtains of the inner door fell back behind her with a swish.|$|E
60|$|In the {{meanwhile}} the little group who had thought prudence {{the better part}} of valour had reached the door.

6000|$|Greta {{opened her}} book, and <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>finger</b> in the page. [...] "Herr Harz is {{very kind to}} me," [...] she said.

60|$|It was Francis, {{long and}} elegant, with his {{straight}} shoulders and his coat buttoned {{to show his}} waist, and his face so well-formed and so modern. So modern, altogether. His voice was pleasantly modulated, and never hurried. He now looked as if a thought had struck him. He <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>finger</b> to his brow, and hastened {{back to his own}} carriage. In a minute, he returned with a new London literary magazine.|$|E
60|$|Suddenly {{the larger}} savage {{clutched}} his companion's knee. Then lifting his hatchet, shook {{it with a}} significant gesture in Sheppard's face, {{at the same time}} <b>putting</b> <b>a</b> <b>finger</b> on his lips to enjoin silence.

60|$|Her {{eyes widened}} with {{surprise}} {{when she saw}} who the visitor was, and she <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>finger</b> to her lip {{and pointed to the}} sleeper. And, as we have to record another of the long list of Steve's failures to propose we may say here, in excuse, that this reception took {{a great deal of the}} edge off the dashing resolution which had been his up to that moment. It made him feel self-conscious from the start.|$|E
6000|$|Suddenly Billy Mink <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>finger</b> on {{his lips}} {{as a warning to}} Little Joe Otter to keep {{perfectly}} still.

[...] shouted Billy Mink.|$|E
6000|$|This {{is not a}} {{marriage}} story. It wasn't so bad as that with me. My action, rash as it was, had more the character of divorce--almost of desertion. For no reason on which a sensible person could <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>finger</b> I threw up my job--chucked my berth--left the ship of which the worst that could be said {{was that she was}} a steamship and therefore, perhaps, not entitled to that blind loyalty which.

If the player does elect to answer the question, he then {{has the right to}} immediately ask his own question to the first player.|$|R
60|$|Maimie craned forward eagerly {{to see how}} {{her friend}} fared, though she had really no hope; {{no one seemed to}} have the least hope except Brownie herself, who, however, was {{absolutely}} confident.

6000|$|But the teacher, where?

6000|$|... "Oh, yes, I {{have just}} been sitting by him after he was gone to bed. He never goes to sleep till I have done that, and he always tells me if {{anything}} is on his mind. I could not ask him again, {{it would have been}} insulting him; but he went over it all of himself, and owned he ought not to have <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>finger</b> {{on the edge of the}} nest, but he wanted so to see what it was lined with; otherwise he never touched it. He says, poor boy, that it was only your being a civilian that made you not able to believe him, I am sure you must believe him now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Jonson," [...] he says, [...] "I have {{hitherto}} held thee for {{an honest}} scholar and a deserving {{man in the}} quality thou dost profess. But thou hast brought me a maimed and deformed printed copy of that which I did write for my own recreation, not wishful to be known for so light {{a thing as a}} poet. Moreover, thou hast placed among these my trifles, four plays to which I never <b>put</b> <b>a</b> <b>finger,</b> and others in which I had no more than a thumb. The Seneschal, Mr. Jonson, will pay thee what is due to thee; thy fardels shall be sent whithersoever thou wilt, and, Mary! Mr. Jonson, I bid thee never more be officer of mine." ...|$|E

50|$|Mayanist Francisco Estrada-Belli {{has pointed}} out that even should a Maya site be located in the {{predicted}} place, it could be down to coincidence since there are likely to be hundreds of undiscovered Maya archaeological sites; he commented that the chances were very good of <b>putting</b> <b>a</b> <b>finger</b> anywhere on <b>a</b> map of the region and pinpointing a Maya site. He also offered an invitation for Gadoury to come to Mexico with him to look for Mayan sites.|$|R
