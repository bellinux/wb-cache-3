500|$|After {{the release}} of the first season of Luke Cage, The Atlantics David Sims wrote on the pacing issue of Marvel's Netflix series, a common {{complaint}} to that point, stating, [...] "After two seasons of Daredevil, one of Jessica Jones, and now one of Luke Cage, the Netflix model feels fundamentally flawed, encouraging the kind of molasses-slow plotting comic books are designed to eschew. The problem isn’t that these shows are bad, necessarily... But they all take far too long to get going, by which point many viewers will have already tuned out." [...] He felt one of the problems was the fact that Netflix does not rely on viewers tuning into a particular series as broadcast series do each week, but rather subscribers who, if they lose interest, [...] "can take as long as they want to catch up... as long as they keep paying their subscription fee every month." [...] The Netflix series are also afforded the opportunity to explore elements in more detail, with Sims noting [...] "A lot of this detail [...] good, {{but it could have been}} considerably compressed—none of the Marvel Netflix series, so far, would have lost much by being squeezed into 10 episodes, or even 8. If Netflix shaved the 60-minute running time down quite a bit, it would likely inspire more economical—and better—storytelling from its shows." [...] Sims concluded by saying, [...] "What’s most frustrating of all is that Netflix isn’t getting rid of this approach anytime soon. Daredevil season three, Jessica Jones season two, Iron Fist, and The Punisher are all on their way, and each will follow the same 13-episode structure... The only respite may come in the form of The Defenders, a planned crossover series... over the course of just eight episodes. Who knows? The show might even surprise viewers and explain its villain’s motivations within the first hour. Until then, fans will be stuck needlessly giving over entire days to these series, while others are deterred from watching at all." [...] In her review for the first season of Iron Fist, Allison Keene of Collider.com spoke more on the pacing of Marvel's Netflix series, stating, [...] "By focusing so intently on making these series... much more grounded in a gritty real world than what we typically expect from a superhero show (like DC's candy-colored [...] on The CW), the <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> miss out on the key element: this [...] be fantastical entertainment." [...] With The Defenders, Jeff Jansen of Entertainment Weekly felt many improvements were made to the general complaints the previous seasons received. He said, [...] "The Defenders is far from perfect. But it’s an enjoyable superhero adventure distinguished by improvements and innovations that I hope Marvel will carry forward. Shorter seasons. More team-ups. Fewer shows. Start the consolidation by letting go of Iron Fist. If Danny Rand must persist, add him to the other shows and let the stronger players carry him." ...|$|E
2500|$|It is a {{well-established}} finding that, unlike written language, spoken language {{does not have}} any clear boundaries between words; spoken language is a continuous stream of sound rather than individual words with silences between them. This lack of segmentation between linguistic units presents a problem for young children learning language, who must be able to pick out individual units from the continuous speech streams that they hear. One proposed method of how children are able to solve this <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are attentive to the statistical regularities of the world around them. For example, in the phrase [...] "pretty baby," [...] children are more likely to hear the sounds pre and ty heard together during the entirety of the lexical input around them than they are to hear the sounds ty and ba together. In an artificial grammar learning study with adult participants, Saffran, Newport, and Aslin found that participants were able to locate word boundaries based only on transitional probabilities, suggesting that adults are capable of using statistical regularities in a language-learning task. This is a robust finding that has been widely replicated.|$|E

2500|$|The {{result of}} all those factors, is that the Armenian {{population}} censuses, according to the specialists that criticize them, is an important under counting of the Armenian population, that could have {{gone as far as}} misrepresenting it by half. Lynch critic itself regarding the inclusion of all the Muslims together, when there were probably Armenians in the count, is supported by the Ottoman census, that contain an anomaly that in some region like Van, the Muslim population from one census to another jumped to about 50%, suggesting that numbers for the Ottoman government could have been used as political tool, and went as far as transferring Armenians in the table as Muslim. In fact Ottoman census didn't define any ethnic groups, only religious ones. In this context Armenian meant an adherent of Armenian Apostolic Church not an ethnic Armenian. Ethnic Armenians who claimed to be Muslims were counted as Muslims, Armenian Protestants were counted as others. So Ottoman records aren't reliable sources- the <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> don't give the ethnic breakup of the population, only the religious one. The fact that the 1912 records are based on a census that was conducted under the Hamidian regime, according to the critics, makes it dubious. Turkish records as also suggest that sultan Hamid might have intentionally under-counted the Armenian population. The Turkish author Kâzım Kadri writes, “During the reign of Abdul Hamid we lowered the population figures of the Armenians...” He adds, “By the order of Abdul Hamid the number of the Armenians deliberately had been put in low figures.” ...|$|E

Part of the <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> seem to be trying too hard - laying everything on, instead of sticking with simplicity. The result is that it sounds, heavy, cluttered, even, a bit old-fashioned. Noddy's voice still sounds great, and Dave turns in some pretty nifty guitar, but there's just too much of everything. In the old days, lyrics weren't too important to Slade, but now they're writing songs with meaning." [...] Pete Makowski of New Musical Express wrote: [...] "The band were always on form when they worked within the most basic of formats. Rock and Roll! This album is high energy on a primeval scale. It's got all the ball bustin' riffs you'll find nestling comfortably alongside yer ZZ Tops and Nugents. It's got the same suicidal pace of the Aerosmith Rocks album. It's packed with strong tunes, lotsa potential singles and the lyrical content is more interesting." [...] Tony Ciarochi of Fairbanks Daily News-Miner said: [...] "...their latest album definitely packs the kind of punch that would get that kind of reaction from a crowd of concert goers. Although it is fairly basic rock 'n' roll, the British humor and sarcasm with which it is presented make it a refreshing chance from some of the more bland sledgehammer rock grounds dominant in America." ...|$|E
