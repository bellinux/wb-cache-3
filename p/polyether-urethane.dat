40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} improve {{mechanical}} properties of polyurethane, hyperbranched interpenetrating network(H-IPN) was achieved by incorporating hyperbranched polyethrs into <b>polyether-Urethane</b> that derived from hydroxyl terminated ethylene oxide tetrahydrofuran copolyether (PET) and isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI). It was found that H-IPN exhibited dual-phase morphology, and hydrogen bonding was formed between hyperbranch polyether and <b>polyether-Urethane.</b> H-IPN shows synergetic effect, the tensile strength of H-IPN increased from 1. 39 MPa of neat <b>polyether-Urethane</b> to 2. 67 MPa; Meanwhile, the elongation increased from 605 % of control sample to 2304 %...|$|E

The molar ratio of isocyanate: PTMEG:chain extender varied from 2 : 1 : 1 to 4 : 1 : 3, which produces a molar concentration of furyl group ranging between 3. 65 • 10 – 4 and 1. 25 • 10 – 3 mol/g...|$|E
40|$|A {{recent report}} on the {{correlation}} between enhanced polymer mobility and ionic conductivity at room temperature in plasticized <b>polyether-urethane</b> solid polymer electrolytes (Forsyth et al. [1]), has prompted the present investigation. Positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS) {{has been used to}} study the effect of plasticizer addition on the room temperature free volume characteristics of the crosslinked <b>polyether-urethane.</b> The addition of low molecular weight plasticizers to the <b>polyether-urethane</b> results in a constant or decreasing mean free volume cavity radius, as measured by the orthoPositronium lifetime τ 3, and a decreasing relative concentration of free volume cavities as measured by the ortho-Positronium intensity, I 3. It is postulated that the plasticizers interrupt polymer-polymer interactions by occupying the inter- and intra-chain free volume. The plasticizer structure influences the polymerplasticizer interactions which affect inter- and intra-chain separation and hence the free volume of the system. The decrease in polymer-polymer interaction and the increase in polymer-plasticizer interaction in turn influence the glass transition temperature behaviour. <br /...|$|E
40|$|Polyurethane {{films have}} {{potential}} applications in medicine, especially for packaging implantable medical devices. Although <b>polyether-urethanes</b> have superior mechanical properties and are biocompatible, achieving water resistance {{is still a}} challenge. Polyether based polyurethanes with two different molecular weights (PTMO 1000, PTMO 2000) were prepared from 4, 4 ’-diphenylmethane diisocyanate and poly(tetra-methylene oxide). Polymer films were introduced using different concentrations (0. 5 - 10 wt %) of isopropyl myristate lipid (IPM) as a non-toxic modifying agent. The physical and mechanical properties of these polymers were characterised using physical and spectroscopy techniques (FTIR, Raman, DSC, DMA, tensile testing). Water contact angle and water uptake of the membranes {{as a function of}} IPM concentration was also determined accordingly. The FTIR and Raman data indicate that IPM is dispersed in polyurethane at ≤ 2 wt% and thermal analysis confirmed this miscibility to be dependent on soft segment length. Modified polymers showed increased tensile strength and failure strain as well as reduced water uptake by up to 24 % at 1 - 2 wt% IPM...|$|R
40|$|While small bone defects heal spontaneously, {{critical}} size defects may exceed the body’s regenerative capabilities, and {{require the use}} of bone substitutes and implants. To date, in vitro and in vivo testing of implants remains the gold standard for rigorous mechanical stability and biological safety checks. Current 2 D in vitro testing is limited by a lack of dynamic environment and an inability to investigate mechanical strength of the attachment between the bone-matrix and implant surface. 3 D in vivo tests are also limited by differences in the behaviour and structure of human and animal cells, high costs and difficulty of replicating human ageing effects. The aim of this thesis is to develop biocompatible and osteoconductive polyurethane-based scaffolds with optimal mechanical and biological properties that can be used as 3 D in vitro bone models for bone regeneration and implant testing. 17 Plain-PU and PU-HA scaffolds were fabricated from three different medical grade <b>polyether-urethanes,</b> namely, Z 1 A 1, Z 3 A 1 and Z 9 A 1. The polymer’s ability to dissolve in graded concentrations of DMF/THF solvents was assessed as part of this study. Composite scaffolds containing nano or micro HA particles were fabricated in a ratio of 3 PU: 1 HA by doping PU solutions with HA particles. Electrospinning, freeze drying, freeze extraction and particulate leaching were the main fabrication techniques explored for creating scaffolds. Electrospun scaffolds with non-aligned fibres were spun at 300 rpm whilst those with aligned fibres were spun at 1300 rpm. Particulate leaching using NaCl particles optimized 3 novel fabrication protocols namely, the layer-by-layer, homogenized or physical-mixing techniques for creating highly porous PU-based constructs. Investigation of non-aligned electrospun scaffolds showed that the choice of solvents, on their own or in combination, strongly influences the final properties of solution, hence the fibre morphology of scaffolds. Reducing the amount of DMF contained in the solution, increased fibre diameter, eliminated beads in fibres and led to scaffolds with a more uniform morphology. Moreover, reducing the DMF solvent content led to lower tensile properties of electrospun scaffolds, whilst incorporation of nano and micro HA particles reinforced the mechanical properties of both aligned and non-aligned electrospun composites. RAMAN and FTIR spectroscopy confirmed the presence of HA in all composites. Xylenol orange staining showed that composite mHA scaffolds supported a higher percentage of mineral area coverage compared to plain-PU scaffolds. SHG imaging identified that collagen deposition appeared to be guided by the alignment of the scaffold fibres in the matrix deposited near to the fibres, but changed orientation with an increase in distance from the originally deposited layers. Layer-by-Layer particulate leached scaffolds made from all the three types of PU had a highly porous 3 D structure. 3 : 1 PU:nano-HA composites had the highest Young’s Modulus and yield strength in the Layer-by-Layer group and {{there was no significant difference}} between the mechanical properties of 3 : 1 micro-HA composites and 2 : 1 micro-HA composites.

40|$|Hybrid <b>poly(ether-urethane)</b> {{acrylate}} (PEUA) /titania (TiO 2) microcomposites {{were prepared}} using a novel method {{that includes a}} swelling of different photo-crosslinked PEUA networks in concentrated tetraisopropoxytitanate (Ti(OiC 3 H 7) 4 or TIPT) precursor solution in organic media followed by the hydrolysis of covalently bonded polyalkoxytitanate ([–OTi(OC 3 H 7) 2 –]n) chains and their aggregation to amorphous micro- and nano-scale sized TiO 2 particles. A formation of polymer/titania hybrids was confirmed by complex investigations of the hybrids using infrared (IR) spectroscopy, small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) analysis, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and gravimetry. The dependence of titania phase formation behavior versus functionality of the <b>poly(ether-urethane)</b> acrylate network was discussed. The presence of reactive groups in the organic network promotes the formation of surface-bonded ball-shaped type TiO 2 inclusions as well as provides transparency to the hybrid film samples.

40|$|This article {{deals with}} enzyme-induced {{biodegradation}} behavior of thermoplastic <b>polyether–urethane</b> (TPU). Porous scaffolds were processed {{by a new}} foaming method applied in hot pressing and injection molding. The scaffolds were subsequently ¿ sterilized. The samples were incubated with cholesterol esterase (CE) for 28 days to simulate an enzymatic degradation order to assess polymer biostability. The main focus of degradation products was the most toxic one: methylene dianiline (MDA). LC/MS was used to separate the breakdown products and to identify possible MDA amounts. The results showed that (a) the hot-pressed sample released an MDA amount almost twice as large (0. 26 ng ± 0. 008) {{as that of the}} injection-molded samples (0. 15 ng ± 0. 003) after incubation with enzyme activity in the physiological range, and (b) a tenfold increase in CE activity revealed considerably higher MDA amounts (7540. 0 ng ± 0. 004). This enzyme concentration is physiologically unlikely, however, but may occur for extreme high inflammation behavior. Even for extremely high levels of CE enzyme, the scaffold will not discharge MDA above toxic levels. The injection-molded samples sterilized at 25 kGy seem to represent the most promising processing method. Therefore, the new injection-molding foaming process of <b>polyether–urethane</b> can be considered appropriate for use as a biomaterial...|$|E

Thin films have been irradiated under a dose rate of 1 MGy/h with absorbed doses varying from 25 to 1000 kGy under O- 2. FTIR spectra have shown the formation of hydroperoxides, carboxylic acids, primary amines, alcohols, esters and formates. Moreover, the decrease of urethane and ether absorbances revealed the degradation of both soft and hard segments. Spin-trapping technique was used to monitor the evolution of short-lived peroxy and alkyl radicals at room temperature.

Two new synthetic polymers, perfluorobutyryl ethylcellulose and polyalkylsulfone, that combine desirable blood compatibility and gas-to-blood transfer rates are discussed in terms of their potential usefulness for membrane oxygenators. Among the several hydrogels, polyacrylamide covalently grafted onto segmented <b>polyether-urethane</b> substrates showed essentially no platelet adhesion and adsorbed the least plasma proteins in comparison to other systems. Polymeric composites having stiffness, anisotropies that approximate living tissues, and the ability to culture cells and hence to maintain a living cellular interface between flowing blood and microfiber substrates, are expected to expand the horizons for biomaterials in prosthetic applications...|$|E

The hybrids can be easily synthesized by a moisture-cured sol-gel process at room temperature. Strong interactions between the organic and inorganic domains in these hybrids are obtained through the hydrolysis-condensation of the silane end group of the prepolymer with titanium isopropoxide (TTIP), which forms a 3 D hybrid network. These hybrids exhibit adjustable mechanical properties, in a range dependent on the organic/inorganic content ratio, e. g., the hybrid containing 40 wt% of TTIP exhibits 69. 3 % elongation at break and excellent resilience. They show intrinsic optical transparency and the ability to completely block UV radiation in the range of UV-B and UV-A 2, as well as excellent X-ray radiation blocking property.

40|$|The structure-property {{relationships}} of thermoplastic polymer blends based on <b>poly(ether-urethane)</b> ionomer (PEUI) and ion-containing styrene-acrylic acid copolymer (S-co-AA(K)) {{have been investigated}} by using DMTA, DSC and TGA, as well as tensile tests. Convergence of the glass transition temperature (T g) values of the PEUI and the S-co-AA(K) components in the blends studied, {{as compared to the}} individual polymers, was found and explained by improving compatibility of the components due to increasing effective density of physical networks formed by ion-dipole and ion-ion interactions of ionic groups of the components. Character of E'=f(T) and E''=f(T) dependencies confirms the increase of the effective density of physical networks in the compositions studied compared to individual PEUI and S-co-AA(K). Improvement of end-use properties, i. e. thermal stability and tensile properties has been found for the PEUI/S-co-AA(K) compositions with lower content of S-co-AA(K) (i. e. < 10 mass%) and explained by formation of additional network of intermolecular ionic bonds between the functional groups of PEUI and S-co-AA(K). © 2006 Akadémiai Kiadó...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Porous Shape Memory Polymers (SMPs) {{are ideal}} {{candidates}} for the fabrication of defect fillers, able to support tissue regeneration via minimally invasive approaches. In this regard, control of pore size, shape and interconnection is required to achieve adequate nutrient transport and cell ingrowth. Here, we assessed the feasibility of the preparation of SMP porous structures and characterized their chemico-physical properties and in vitro cell response. Methods: SMP scaffolds were obtained via solvent casting/particulate leaching of gelatin microspheres, prepared via oil/water emulsion. A solution of commercial <b>polyether-urethane</b> (MM- 4520, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries) was cast on compacted microspheres and leached-off after polymer solvent evaporation. The obtained structures were characterized in terms of morphology (SEM and micro-CT), thermo-mechanical properties (DMTA), shape recovery behavior in compression mode, and in vitro cytocompatibility (MG 63 Osteoblast-like cell line). Results: The fabrication process enabled easy control of scaffold morphology, pore size, and pore shape by varying the gelatin microsphere morphology.

40|$|PhD. DissertationA novel {{polymeric}} {{matrix system}} has been developed to deliver agents to block platelet adhesion or inhibit thrombin activation on implanted biomaterials. The base material of the system used was BioSpan®, a medical-grade <b>polyether-urethane</b> urea (PEUU) elastomer, which contained a dispersion of an active agent: either an anti-platelet-adhesion peptide (echistatin), small peptide (RGDSGY), or direct antithrombin peptide (hirudin), along with bovine serum albumin (BSA) or poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) as an excipient and poreformer. The PEUU-peptide matrix was subsequently processed using radio-frequency glowdischarge (RFGD) plasma polymerization of acrylate monomers, either 2 -hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA), n-butyl methacrylate (BMA), or N-isopropyl acrylamide (NIPAAm) to create a barrier membrane. Control of plasma parameters changed the cross linking of this thin, conformal barrier, and produced different release rates of the active agents from the matrix. Biologically active echistatin and hirudin were delivered successfully, but some matrices exhibited a limited reduction in release rate due to osmotic rupturing of the matrix and coating. For RGDSGY-containing matrices, the reduction in release rate with RFGD plasma coating was greatest for matrices with PEG excipients of 10, 000 and 20, 000 molecular weight...|$|E
40|$|The aim was {{to prepare}} {{expanded}} graphite oxide (GO, Graftech Inc.) and disperse it in a polyol (poly(oxypropylene glyceride), Dow Chemicals) using ultrasonication. The dispersion was polymerized and crosslinked with methane 4, 4 &# 039;-diphenyldiisocyanate to form a <b>poly(ether-urethane).</b> SEM showed relatively uniform dispersion of graphite oxide sheets and unexfoliated graphite oxide in the PU. X-ray data showed a single sharp diffraction peak for unexfoliated graphite at a scattering angle of 26 °. Thermogravimetry demonstrated that the thermal stability of the PU was increased by GO. The increased thermal stability was due to retardation of volatiles emission by tortuous paths created by GO and absorption of both polymer and degradation products by GO. The modulus and yield strength of GO-PU nano-composites were increased, while the elongation at break was reduced. PU creep was reduced by GO, while recovery was slowed and the non-exponentiality (skewness of the exponential recovery curve) increased consistent to a greater distribution of relaxation times. The storage modulus in the glassy and rubbery regions was increased with PU-GO, while the damping factor was decreased. The glass transition of the flexible polyol phase was not significantly changed...|$|E
40|$|Three {{commercial}} medical-grade polyurethanes (PUs), a <b>polyether-urethane</b> (Pellethane), and two poly-carbonate-urethanes, the one aromatic (Bionate) and {{the other}} aliphatic (Chronoflex), were tested for macrophages and bacterial cells adhesion, in {{the presence or absence}} of adhesive plasma proteins. All the experiments were carried out on PUs films obtained by solvent casting. The wettability of these films was analysed by measuring static contact angles against water. The ability of the selected PUs to adsorb human fibronectin (Fn) and fibrinogen (Fbg) was checked by ELISA with biotin-labelled proteins. All PUs were able to adsorb Fn and Fbg(Fn >Fbg). Fn adsorption was in the order: Pellethane>Chronoflex>Bionate, the highest Fbg adsorption being detected onto Bionate (Bionate>Chronoflex>Pellethane). The human macrophagic line J 111, and the two main bacterial strains responsible for infection in humans (Staphylococcus aureus Newman and Staphylococcus epidermidis 14852) were incubated in turn with the three PUs, uncoated or coated with plasma proteins. No macrophage or bacterial adhesion was observed onto uncoated PUs. PUs coated with plasma, Fn or Fbgpromoted bacterial adhesion (S. aureus>S. epidermidis), whereas macrophage adhered more onto PUs coated with Fn or plasma.

40|$|Solid polymer {{electrolytes}} {{based on}} amorphous <b>polyether-urethane</b> networks combined with lithium or sodium salts {{and a low}} molecular weight cosolvent (plasticizer) have been investigated in our laboratories for several years. Conductivity enhancements of up to two orders of magnitude can be obtained whilst still retaining solid elastomeric properties. In {{order to understand the}} effects of the plasticizers and their mechanism of conductivity enhancement, multinuclear NMR has been employed to investigate ionic structure in polymer electrolyte systems containing NaCF 3 SO 3, LiCF 3 SO 3 and LiClO 3 salts. With increasing dimethyl formamide (DMF) and propylene carbonate (PC) concentration the increasing cation chemical shift with fixed salt concentration indicates a decreasing anion-cation association consistent with an increased number of charge carriers. 13 C chemical shift data for the same systems suggests that whilst DMF also decreases cation-polymer interactions, PC does the opposite, presumably by shielding cation-anion interactions. Temperature dependent 7 Li spin-lattice relaxation times indicate the expected increase in ionic mobility upon plasticization with a shift of the T 1 minimum to lower temperatures. The magnitude of T 1 at the minimum increases upon addition of DMF whereas there is a slight decrease when PC is added. This also supports the suggestion that the DMF preferentially solvates the cation whereas the action of PC is limited to coulomb screening, hence freeing the anion. <br /...|$|E
