50|$|The {{output power}} of an engine {{is the product}} of its torque and speed. The torque varies with speed, {{increasing}} to a peak value and falling away both above and below this. The range for which the torque is a useful proportion of the maximum is described as the 'power band'. Diesel engines generally have a broader band than petrol engines and they also lose less fuel-efficiency at <b>part</b> <b>throttle</b> settings.|$|R
5000|$|Once {{more fully}} developed, {{electronic}} valve operation will yield even more benefits. Cylinder deactivation, for instance, {{could be made}} much more fuel efficient if the intake valve could be opened on every downstroke and the exhaust valve opened on every upstroke of the deactivated cylinder or [...] "dead hole". Another even more significant advancement will be {{the elimination of the}} conventional throttle. When a car is run at <b>part</b> <b>throttle,</b> this interruption in the airflow causes excess vacuum, which causes the engine to use up valuable energy acting as a vacuum pump. BMW attempted to get around this on their V-10 powered M5, which had individual throttle butterflies for each cylinder, placed just before the intake valves. With electronic valve operation, {{it will be possible to}} control engine speed by regulating valve lift. At <b>part</b> <b>throttle,</b> when less air and gas are needed, the valve lift would not be as great. Full throttle is achieved when the gas pedal is depressed, sending an electronic signal to the ECU, which in turn regulates the lift of each valve event, and opens it all the way up.|$|R

Tractors with and without front-wheel assist were used. The method {{can be used as a}} substitute for normalized tests, exhibiting deviations smaller than 2 % for values of the drawbar power and traction relative to test results. The method has the advantage of allowing the simulation at <b>part</b> <b>throttle,</b> and the accuracy would not be affected if tests were conducted in one gear only...|$|R
50|$|Under <b>part</b> <b>throttle</b> {{conditions}} (i.e. {{when the}} throttle {{is less than}} fully open), the effective compression ratio is less than when the engine is operating at full throttle, due to {{the simple fact that}} the incoming fuel-air mixture is being restricted and cannot fill the chamber to full atmospheric pressure. The engine efficiency is less than when the engine is operating at full throttle. One solution to this fact is to shift the load in a multi-cylinder engine from some of the cylinders (by deactivating them) to the remaining cylinders so that they may operate under higher individual loads and with correspondingly higher effective compression ratios. This technique is known as variable displacement.|$|R
40|$|Initial {{studies of}} the effect of air-fuel mixture {{preparation}} on piston engine performance have been conducted on a four cylinder 1600 cc petrol engine using conventional carburation and ultrasonic fuel atomisation. The performance of the engine, under various conditions of operation, has been assessed on the basis of specific fuel consumption and brake mean effective pressure. Whereas only minor differences in performance were found under full power condition at <b>part</b> <b>throttle</b> running of the engine with ultrasonic fuel atomisation improvements in fuel consumption in excess of 10 % were observed. These improvements appear to be the direct result of better mixture preparation.

An engine noise test facility was developed and initial tests were performed on a Lycoming IO- 360 engine. The engine exhaust, rather than direct engine-housing vibration caused radiation, was identified as the prime source of engine noise. Spectral characteristics and radiation directivities were determined for different operational conditions as well as the dependence of the overall noise on full and <b>part</b> <b>throttle</b> engine power.

The present study is planned to develop and evaluate the performance, emission and combustion characteristics of the ultra-lean burn Internal Combustion engine was modified to operate on ethanol blends fuels. The study looked at <b>part</b> <b>throttle,</b> constant speed operation of 0 %, 10 %, and 15 % ethanol blends with gasoline mixtures operating in ultra-lean operating systems. In experiment practice the use of homogeneous lean mixtures in engine has been handicapped by several difficulties. The most serious one is that the flame propagation through mixtures becomes gradually slower as the mixture becomes leaner. The mixture distribution in a multi-cylinder engine is a problem because even small variation in mixture ratio on the linear side will strongly effect power output. Enhancement of lean combustion of homogeneous mixtures can be achieved by (i) using ethanol blends with gasoline (ii) using high-ignition energy (iii) providing high compression ratios (iv) creating high swirl in the combustion chamber...|$|R
50|$|Outboard motor carburetors are {{typically}} sidedraft, because {{they must be}} stacked {{one on top of}} the other in order to feed the cylinders in a vertically oriented cylinder block.The main disadvantage of basing a carburetor's operation on Bernoulli's Principle is that, being a fluid dynamic device, the pressure reduction in a Venturi tends to be proportional to the square of the intake air speed. The fuel jets are much smaller and limited mainly by viscosity, so that the fuel flow tends to be proportional to the pressure difference. So jets sized for full power tend to starve the engine at lower speed and <b>part</b> <b>throttle.</b> Most commonly this has been corrected by using multiple jets. In SU and other movable jet carburetors, it was corrected by varying the jet size. For cold starting, a different principle was used in multi-jet carburetors. A flow resisting valve called a choke, similar to the throttle valve, was placed upstream of the main jet to reduce the intake pressure and suck additional fuel out of the jets.|$|R

5000|$|While basic carburetors {{have only}} one Venturi, many carburetors {{have more than one}} Venturi, or [...] "barrel". Two barrel and four barrel {{configurations}} are commonly used to accommodate the higher air flow rate with large engine displacement. Multi-barrel carburetors can have non-identical primary and secondary barrel(s) of different sizes and calibrated to deliver different air/fuel mixtures; they can be actuated by the linkage or by engine vacuum in [...] "progressive" [...] fashion, so that the secondary barrels do not begin to open until the primaries are almost completely open. This is a desirable characteristic which maximizes airflow through the primary barrel(s) at most engine speeds, thereby maximizing the pressure [...] "signal" [...] from the Venturis, but reduces the restriction in airflow at high speeds by adding cross-sectional area for greater airflow. These advantages may not be important in high-performance applications where <b>part</b> <b>throttle</b> operation is irrelevant, and the primaries and secondaries may all open at once, for simplicity and reliability; also, V-configuration engines, with two cylinder banks fed by a single carburetor, may be configured with two identical barrels, each supplying one cylinder bank. In the widely seen V8 and 4-barrel carburetor combination, there are often two primary and two secondary barrels.|$|R
40|$|Real-time {{transmission}} over asymmetric satellite IP links is challenging, since {{satellite systems}} commonly exhibit long propagation delays, while bandwidth asymmetry often enforces a variable and infrequent rate of acknowledgment packets (ACKs) across the upstream channel with several undesirable implications. In this context, we formulate an analytical model {{in order to}} quantify the impact of satellite systems and link asymmetry on TCP performance and real-time delivery. We emphasize {{on the effects of}} asymmetric links, and especially on the implications that cause interruptions in the sending rate, and eventually disturb smooth delivery. Since TCP performance is in <b>part</b> <b>throttled</b> by the rate of arriving ACKs, we additionally investigate the impact of delayed ACKs. Although delayed ACKs occasionally diminish the transmission rate, we uncover notable gains in terms of smoothness and real-time delivery. Furthermore, we demonstrate conclusive performance studies tackling the supportive role of selective acknowledgments (SACK) and the effect of varying bit error rates. Our simulation results illustrate that most existing end-to-end solutions do not comply with the stringent Quality of Service (QoS) provisions of time-sensitive applications, resulting in ineffective bandwidth utilization and varying delays in data delivery. Finally, with the absence of a satellite-optimized TCP implementation for real-time transmission, we identify the most prominent end-to-end solutions that manage to alleviate most of the impairments induced by asymmetric satellite links, sustaining a relatively smooth transmission rate...|$|R

40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. A study has been conducted into the causes of cycle by cycle variations in combustion within a spark ignition engine, the best measured engine parameter to use for its characterization, and the effects that: ignition timing, equivalence ratio, fuel type, throttle position and knock, have upon it. A Ricardo E 6 single cylinder variable compression ratio research engine was instrumented to allow measurement of: cylinder pressure, temperatures, speed, load, fuel flow and air flow. The engine was also fitted with an optical slice that allowed optical access to the combustion chamber and enabled measurement of the early flame speed (up to 10 mm from spark plug gap) using a laser schileren system. Cylinder pressure data were collected on a dedicated HP 1000 computer for every degree of crank angle rotation for up to 300 successive cycles. A phenomenological model was developed for turbulent combustion that split the combustion process into three phases: early laminar burn, turbulent combustion, and final burn. The model allowed {{the study of the}} physical phenomena occurring within the combustion chamber and enabled insights to be gained into their effects on combustion and cyclic variations. The study showed: The variation in mixture strength has a far greater effect on the average and Coefficient of Variation (COV) values of all the combustion performance parameters, than does changing the fuel type. Cycle by cycle variations in combustion are best characterized by COV of imep. The onset of knock has no discernible effect on the COVs of the measured parameters. The <b>part</b> <b>throttle</b> results show higher COVs than at Wide Open Throttle (WOT) due to slower burn, supporting the theory that faster initial flame speeds reduce cyclic variations. The combustion model was used to support the hypothesis that cycle by cycle variations are caused by movement of the flame kernel by turbulence within the combustion chamber. SER...|$|R

The sensor was replaced overnight and a new wheel was welded on. The engine was not fired until the 2nd day of the competition after the technical inspections. On the 3rd day, the engine fired ok for the first acceleration event but the starter wheel gave out (possibly due to a misalignment during installation). The team replaced the engine within 1.5 hours {{to make it to the}} AutoX event in the afternoon, but had to skip Skid-Pad event. First driver successfully completed the AutoX run and the second driver did not complete his 2nd run after the engine started over-heating due to an electrical failure on the radiator fan. FSAE Michigan 2011 EnduranceThe first driver completed the first half of the event with no problems. As he was getting out of the car, he instructed the second driver to be cautious and take it slow. The second driver conducted his stint at mainly <b>part</b> <b>throttle</b> and through corners would hold the clutch in and then keep the RPMs high due to the belief that the engine was dying. The car was running ok but the 2nd driver was black flagged and had to pull in because of a malfunctioning brake light switch.

For the remaining of the race, the driver pulled the brake pedal back with his foot every time he hit the brakes, which resulted him with very slow laptimes. Since the car was not tuned well for the RPM range that the driver was keeping the car at, the car ran out of fuel and DNF'ed from Endurance 2 laps before it could finish.|$|R
40|$|Optimizing {{the vehicle}} system is {{essential}} for achieving higher fuel efficiency. This dissertation addresses the need to better understand energy demand from a vehicle subsystem standpoint and tackles the challenge of optimal hardware and control system design. An energy analysis methodology and Matlab®/Simulink® based tool are developed to account for where the fuel energy supplied to a vehicle system is demanded. A hybrid semi-empirical and analytical approach that combines first principles with detailed component speed and load data is proposed. The methodology and tool are applied {{to account for the}} instantaneous and accumulated vehicle subsystem energy usage over a given drive cycle. A comparison of the prevailing fuel economy factors for city and highway driving are presented. Incremental vehicle subsystem changes that account for a fraction of the total energy demand are analyzed to determine individual effects on overall fuel economy. A reverse dynamic optimization methodology is proposed for optimal powertrain integration and control design. A reverse tractive road load demand model developed in Matlab®/Simulink® propagates the required wheel torque and speed derived from vehicle speed and road grade through the powertrain system to determine the required fuel flow for all possible states within the hardware constraints. The control strategy is treated as a multi-stage, multi-dimension decision process, where dynamic programming is applied to find an optimal control policy that minimizes the accumulated fuel flow over a drive cycle. The reverse dynamic optimization methodology and tool are used to assess and develop transmission gear shift, torque converter lock-up clutch, and pedal control strategies that are catered to specific vehicle applications. The reverse model and dynamic optimization technique are extended to virtually optimize variable displacement engine operation taking gear and clutch control interaction effects into account. The reverse model is used for establishing design criteria, such as minimum engine <b>part</b> <b>throttle</b> torque requirements, by determining the required speeds and loads to traverse drive cycles. The advantages of the reverse dynamic optimization approach are demonstrated by performing powertrain matching analyses (i. e., vehicle attribute sensitivity analysis; optimal engine, transmission and axle selection; and variable displacement effects) and key system integration concepts are revealed...|$|R

Because the pioneer tests became worldwide standards, this location was designated as a Historic Landmark of Agricultural Engineering by the American Society of Agricultural Engineers in 1980, shortly after testing was moved to a new nearby facility on the University of Nebraska-Lincoln East Campus.

This serves as a period for limber up, general observation and adjustments. Adjustments that are permissible include valve tappet clearance, breaker, point gap, spark plug gaps, clutch and others of a similar nature. No new parts or accessories can be installed without having mention made of it in the report. No data 2 ̆ 7 are recorded during this preliminary run except the time that the engine is operated. BELT HORSEPOWER TESTS TEST B: The manual throttle control level is set so that the throttle valve is held wide opened and the belt load on the dynamometer is adjusted so that the engine is at the rated speed recommended by the manufacturer. Carburetor, ignition timing and manifold adjustments are all set for maximum engine power. This test is designed to determine maximum belt horsepower of the tractor at rated speed and to measure fuel consumption at the maximum power on the belt. TEST C: For tractors with carburetors the best fuel economy does not always occur when the engine develops maximum power at rated speed. Test C is intended to allow the manufacturer 2 ̆ 7 s representative to select a more economical fuel setting even though there is a slight loss of power. This more practical carburetor setting is used in all later tests except test F. The throttle valve is held wide open and load adjusted to give rated rpm.
