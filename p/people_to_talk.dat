25|$|Another aim is {{to provide}} a {{platform}} for local talent and bands to promote themselves, and is also a feature for local <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about their trade, crafts and charities, including Stafford MP Jeremy Lefroy, who chatted with the team and the restoration work they are involved in, and former Stafford Mayor Angela Loughran, who visited the station in April 2014.|$|E
25|$|If Agnes is the fulcrum, then Tobias is {{the energy}} behind the fulcrum that works at keeping a balance in this {{dysfunctional}} family. He is constantly asking <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> more kindly about one another. Or, in the least, it is Tobias who keeps silent while fury flares around him. It is also Tobias who serves everyone drinks, {{as if trying}} to soften the edges of their grievances with alcohol.|$|E

500|$|A word, phrase or {{topic that}} is {{mentioned}} at a greater rate than others {{is said to}} be a [...] "trending topic". Trending topics become popular either through a concerted effort by users, or because of an event that prompts <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about a specific topic. These topics help Twitter and their users to understand what is happening in the world and what people's opinions are about it.|$|E
500|$|Allison Bowsher from MuchMusic was {{impressed}} with the video, calling it a [...] "moving short film". She wrote, [...] "As an ode to Los Angeles, the band brought together what is most simply described as a diverse group of <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about their feelings towards the famous city. From street performers to homeless youth {{to some of the most}} famous celebrities in the world, Thirty Seconds to Mars compiled a panel that concisely and visually demonstrate the extreme highs and lows of Los Angeles in eleven minutes." [...] Luke O'Neil from MTV noted that [...] "interspersed with the real celebrities are a series of celebrity impersonators, which only heightens the underlying conceit about the fuzzy intersection of dreams and reality. That's the idea of Los Angeles". Emily Wright from The Boston Globe noticed the [...] "raw, personal side to some of today's most popular celebrities" [...] featured. Scott Sterling of CBS News called it a [...] "compelling examination on life in Los Angeles".|$|E
500|$|On 13 July 1942, the Franks {{were joined}} by the van Pels family: Hermann, Auguste, and 16-year-old Peter, and then in November by Fritz Pfeffer, a dentist and friend of the family. Frank wrote of her {{pleasure}} at having new <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to, but tensions quickly developed within the group forced to live in such confined conditions. After sharing her room with Pfeffer, she {{found him to be}} insufferable and resented his intrusion, and she clashed with Auguste van Pels, whom she regarded as foolish. She regarded Hermann van Pels and Fritz Pfeffer as selfish, particularly in regard to the amount of food they consumed. Some time later, after first dismissing the shy and awkward Peter van Pels, she recognized a kinship with him and the two entered a romance. She received her first kiss from him, but her infatuation with him began to wane as she questioned whether her feelings for him were genuine, or resulted from their shared confinement. Anne Frank formed a close bond with each of the helpers, and Otto Frank later recalled that she had anticipated their daily visits with impatient enthusiasm. He observed that Anne's closest friendship was with Bep Voskuijl, [...] "the young typist... the two of them often stood whispering in the corner." ...|$|E

2500|$|Reddy explores {{some of the}} {{potential}} social and psychological effects of believing that communication is a [...] "success without effort" [...] system, whereas it is an [...] "energy must be expended" [...] system. The conduit metaphor objectifies meaning and influences <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> and think about mental content as if it possessed an external, inter-subjective reality.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{feel that}} speed dating has some obvious {{advantages}} over most other venues for meeting people, such as bars, discotheques, etc. in {{that everybody is}} purportedly there to meet someone, they are grouped into compatible age ranges, it is time-efficient, and the structured interaction eliminates the need to introduce oneself. [...] Unlike many bars, a speed dating event will, by necessity, be quiet enough for <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> comfortably. Speed dating is for singles.|$|E
2500|$|According to Richard Zoglin of Time, [...] "Lucky Guy {{captures the}} hard-drinking, boys-club camaraderie, {{gets into the}} weeds of how reporters {{actually}} get <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk,</b> and shows us the rivalries and egos and dubious ethics that {{are all part of}} the package". In the end it is [...] "a celebration of old-fashioned tabloid journalism in the heart of the city’s other great indigenous and endangered industry, Broadway theater." [...] When the play closed, its run was described by Mike Lupica as a [...] "New York Story" [...] in addition to being a sentimental depiction of newspaper journalism.|$|E

2500|$|The Internet now allows deaf <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> via a video link, {{either with}} a {{special-purpose}} videophone {{designed for use}} with sign language or with [...] "off-the-shelf" [...] video services designed for use with broadband and an ordinary computer webcam. [...] The special videophones that are designed for sign language communication may provide better quality than 'off-the-shelf' services and may use data compression methods specifically designed to maximize the intelligibility of sign languages. Some advanced equipment enables a person to remotely control the other person's video camera, in order to zoom in and out or to point the camera better to understand the signing.|$|E
2500|$|Poirot {{focuses on}} getting <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk.</b> In the early novels, he casts {{himself in the}} role of [...] "Papa Poirot", a benign confessor, {{especially}} to young women. In later works, Christie made a point of having Poirot supply false or misleading information about himself or his background to assist him in obtaining information. In The Murder of Roger Ackroyd, Poirot speaks of a non-existent mentally disabled nephew to uncover information about homes for the mentally unfit. In Dumb Witness, Poirot invents an elderly invalid mother as a pretence to investigate local nurses. In The Big Four, Poirot pretends to have (and poses as) an identical twin brother named Achille: however, this brother was mentioned again in The Labours of Hercules.|$|E
2500|$|Murray {{wanted to}} work on a Comics Code-approved series in order to reach a broader audience. He said, [...] "I wanted a way to at least tell a part of the story to the kids and maybe get other <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about it as well." [...] However, because of the Code, {{he was not able to}} address things like drug use or include swearing. Hama and Murray wanted to ignore {{politics}} and focus on the war from the average foot soldier's point of view. Murray said that the comic was [...] "a pretty accurate view of the way the average soldier looked at the war. It was outside ordinary experience. The world was elsewhere." [...] Murray decided to do the comic book in real-time so that one issue equaled one month to convey the concept of short-time.|$|E

In one episode, Burton took the show behind-the-scenes on the set of [...] The final segment of each show, called Book Reviews, began with Burton's introductory catchphrase, [...] "But you don't have to take my word for it," [...] and featured children giving capsule reviews of books they liked.
