40|$|Link Clustering (LC) is a {{relatively}} new method for detecting overlapping communities in networks. The basic principle of LC is to derive a transform matrix whose elements are composed of the link similarity of neighbor links based on the Jaccard distance calculation; then it applies hierarchical clustering to the transform matrix and uses a measure of <b>partition</b> <b>density</b> on the resulting dendrogram to determine the cut level for best community detection. However, the original link clustering method does not consider the link similarity of non-neighbor links, and the <b>partition</b> <b>density</b> tends to divide the communities into many small communities. In this paper, an Extended Link Clustering method (ELC) for overlapping community detection is proposed. The improved method employs a new link similarity, Extended Link Similarity (ELS), to produce a denser transform matrix, and uses the maximum value of EQ (an extended measure of quality of modularity) as a means to optimally cut the dendrogram for better partitioning of the original network space. Since ELS uses more link information, the resulting transform matrix provides a superior basis for clustering and analysis. Further, using the EQ value to find the best level for the hierarchical clustering dendrogram division, we obtain communities that are more sensible and reasonable than the ones obtained by the <b>partition</b> <b>density</b> evaluation. Experimentation on five real-world networks and artificially-generated networks shows that the ELC method achieves higher EQ and In-group Proportion (IGP) values. Additionally, communities are more realistic than those generated by either of the original LC method or the classical CPM method...|$|E

This extends {{the results of}} Goldreich, Goldwasser and Ron who obtained similar algorithms for the special case of graph partition problems in their seminal paper [16]. The partitioning algorithm is used to obtain the following results: • We derive a surprisingly simple O(n) time algorithmic version of Szemerédi’s regularity lemma. Unlike all the previous approaches for this problem [3, 10, 14, 15, 21], which only guaranteed to find partitions of tower-size, our algorithm will find a small regular partition in the case that one exists; • For any r ≥ 3, we give an O(n) time randomized algorithm for constructing regular partitions of r-uniform hypergraphs, thus improving the previous O(n 2 r− 1) time (deterministic) algorithms [8, 15].

According to the problems existing in current road network partitioning, first of all, this paper proposes the <b>partition</b> <b>density</b> formula and the optimal road network partitioning method according to the <b>partition</b> <b>density.</b> Based on that, we propose the concepts of partition self-attraction, mutual attraction, and merger factor of partition to effectively merge the partitions with low densities, which can further {{reduce the number of}} unnecessary broadcast frames and optimize the index method. Then, we propose the real distributed air index method DIM and kNN spatial query processing algorithm based on the MapReduce platform. According to the DIM index method, the Name Node only stores the prime index, while not storing the data, and each frame consists of defined index and the data in a partition that need to be broadcasted. The mobile user can quickly localize the frame data that they need to obtain according to the main index or the index of current frame, in this way to reduce the tuning time and access latency, which can significantly optimize the query efficiency.

40|$|Density-based {{embedding}} for multiscale simulations, CECAM-HQ-EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland, March 24, 2014 to March 27, 2014 A {{method is}} proposed to <b>partition</b> the <b>density</b> {{of a system}} in two portions. The density on each subsystem is the solution of a Fock equation modified {{by the addition of}} an "embedding" potential. This embedding potential is obtained iteratively by minimizing the difference between the electronic densities of the total system and the sum of the subsystems. Thus, the electronic <b>density</b> <b>partition</b> and the two embedding potentials, one per portion, are obtained at the same time within the procedure, warranting the v-representability of the two densities obtained. The method is first applied to a linear H_ 10 chain to illustrate how it works.

Finally, the method is applied to include the electronic correlation needed to describe the van der Waals interaction between H_ 10 chains and H_ 2 molecules, of ≈ 12 meV, giving very accurate results.

Fdp is a recently proposed density-based clustering algorithm which does not need the number of clusters as prior input {{and the result is}} insensitive to its parameter.

To solve the problem, a new community detection method (named IsoFdp) is proposed in this paper. First, we use Isomap technique to map the network data into a low dimensional manifold which can reveal diverse pair-wised similarity. Then Fdp is applied to detect the communities in networks.

To efficiently solve for the embedding potential, an optimized effective potential method is derived. This embedding potential, which eschews use of approximate kinetic energy density functionals, is then {{used to describe the}} environment while a correlated wavefunction (CW) treatment of the embedded region is employed. We first demonstrate the accuracy of this new embedded CW (ECW) method by calculating the van der Waals binding energy curve between a hydrogen molecule and a hydrogen chain. We then examine the prototypical adsorption of CO on a metal surface, here the Cu(111) surface. In addition to obtaining proper site ordering (top site most stable) and binding energies within this theory, the ECW exhibits dramatic changes in the p-character of the CO 4 σ and 5 σ orbitals upon adsorption that agree very well with x-ray emission spectra, providing further validation of the theory.

40|$|Fingerprint {{positioning}} {{method is}} generally {{the first choice}} in indoor navigation system due to its high accuracy and low cost. The accuracy depends on <b>partition</b> <b>density</b> to the indoor space. The accuracy will be higher with higher grid resolution. But the high grid resolution leads to significantly increasing work of the fingerprint data collection, processing and maintenance.

While used for pedestrian navigation, sometimes a person can be located at the area {{where he or she}} cannot access. This paper studied these two issues, proposed a new indoor space partition method considering pedestrian accessibility, which can increase the accuracy of pedestrian position, and decrease the volume of the fingerprint data.

The resultant equation includes the following terms: convection, diffusion, entropy flow due to a thermostat and entropy production. The averaging of the four terms recover the corresponding terms in a balance equation for the macroscopic entropy density of irreversible thermodynamics for a thermostated system. Moreover, an empirical law of order estimation is introduced to explain the limiting behavior of the averaged quantities in the macroscopic limit for the bulk system. The law makes it possible to separate some minor contributions from the major four terms and, for example, to explain the positive entropy production rate in a nonequilibrium state for volume-preserving systems, even if the state is far from steady state.

40|$|Approximations of the non-additive non-interacting {{kinetic energy}} (NAKE) as an {{explicit}} functional of the density {{are the basis}} of several electronic structure methods that provide improved computational efficiency over standard Kohn-Sham calculations. However, within most fragment-based formalisms, there is no unique exact NAKE, {{making it difficult to}} develop general, robust approximations for it. When adjustments are made to the embedding formalisms to guarantee uniqueness, approximate functionals may be more meaningfully compared to the exact unique NAKE. We use numerically accurate inversions to study the exact NAKE of several rare-gas dimers within <b>Partition</b> <b>Density</b> Functional Theory, a method that provides the uniqueness for the exact NAKE. We find that the NAKE decreases nearly exponentially with atomic separation for the rare gas dimers. We compute the logarithmic derivative of the NAKE with respect to the bond length for our numerically accurate inversions as well as for several approximate NAKE functionals. We show that standard approximate NAKE functionals do not reproduce the correct behavior for this logarithmic derivative, and propose two new NAKE functionals that do. The first of these is based on a re-parametrization of a conjoint PBE functional.

40|$|Networks are {{powerful}} tools for the presentation {{and analysis of}} interactions in multi-component systems. A commonly studied mesoscopic feature of networks is their community structure, which arises from grouping together similar nodes into one community and dissimilar nodes into separate communities. Here, the community structure of protein sequence similarity networks is determined with a new method: Attribute Clustering Dependent Communities (ACDC). Sequence similarity has hitherto typically been quantified by the alignment score or its expectation value. However, pair alignments with the same score or expectation value cannot thus be differentiated. To overcome this deficiency, the method constructs, for pair alignments, an extended alignment metric, the link attribute vector, which includes the score and other alignment characteristics. Rescaling components of the attribute vectors qualitatively identifies a systematic variation of sequence similarity within protein superfamilies. The problem of community detection is then mapped to clustering the link attribute vectors, selection of an optimal subset of links and community structure refinement based on the <b>partition</b> <b>density</b> of the network. ACDC-predicted communities {{are found to be}} in good agreement with gold standard sequence databases for which the "ground truth" community structures (or families) are known.

40|$|<b>Partition</b> <b>density</b> {{functional}} theory (PDFT) is {{a method}} for dividing a molecular electronic structure calculation into fragment calculations.

Each fragment acts as an isolated system except for {{the influence of a}} global one-body 2 ̆ 7 partition 2 ̆ 7 potential which deforms the fragment densities. In this work, the developments of PDFT are put into the context of other fragment-based density functional methods. We developed three numerical implementations of PDFT: One within the NWChem computational chemistry package using basis sets, and the other two developed from scratch using real-space grids. It is shown that all three of these programs can exactly reproduce a KS-DFT calculation via fragment calculations. The first of our in-house codes handles non-interacting electrons in arbitrary one-dimensional potentials with any number of fragments. This code is used to explore how the exact partition potential changes for different partitionings of the same system and also to study features which determine which systems yield non-integer PDFT occupations and which systems are locked into integer PDFT occupations. The second in-house code, CADMium, performs real-space calculations of diatomic molecules. Features of the exact partition potential are studied for a variety of cases and an analytical formula determining singularities in the partition potential is derived. We introduce an approximation for the non-additive kinetic energy and show how this quantity can be computed exactly.
