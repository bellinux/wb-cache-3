The next few years were marked by publicity surrounding Love's legal troubles and drug addiction, {{which resulted in a}} mandatory lockdown rehabilitation sentence in 2005 while she was in the <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> a second planned solo album. That project became Nobody's Daughter, which was released in 2010 as a Hole album but without any other members of the former lineups. Between 2014 and 2015, she released two solo singles and returned to acting in the network series Sons of Anarchy and Empire.|$|E
40|$|This thesis explores how {{writing is}} made in two Swedish early {{childhood}} classrooms {{with a focus on}} how <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> are constituted in the writing event and what writings and writers the event offers potentials for. Theoretically, the research project takes its starting point in the assumption that <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> are an effect of relations between different elements, where the young writer is only one part of many human and non-human matters that make way for multiple becomings <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> and writers. In this context, the figuration of the nomad thought of Deleuze and Guattari is particularly applicable as it builds on the assumption that everything is always connected, continuously moving. The questions addressed are how the <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> writers, text-like writings and educational writing processes emerge, continue and transform in the writing event, and what writers, text-like writings and educational writing processes the event offers potentials for. The thesis consists of three research articles based on different empirical data. The first article builds on data from the thinking and talking about writing and the writing child in scholarly literature since the 19 th century. The second and third articles are based on analyses of ethnographic documentation of six- to seven-year-olds’ writing activities in two early childhood classrooms. The ethnographic strategies of the audio and video recordings, field notes, informal interviews and the collection of children’s text-like writings were carried out over a period of one and a half year during which the children moved from preschool class to their first year of school. The findings of the first article suggest that the image <b>of</b> the ideal <b>writing</b> and the ideal writer has changed over time. However, the image of the young writer training for adult life predominates over time. The main result of the second article shows in specific ways that the mutual production <b>of</b> stabilizing <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> and <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> experimentation are vital components for becomings <b>of</b> writers and <b>writing,</b> irrespective <b>of</b> pedagogical framings. The finding of the third article illustrates how the teaching method <b>of</b> creative <b>writing</b> produced over time creates multiple pedagogical trajectories of “doing method” and “doing creativity”. The thesis posits nomadic writing as a way to account for the movement, the connectivity and change in the <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> <b>writing,</b> thus contributing to an understanding <b>of</b> how the <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> create potentialities for multiple becomings <b>of</b> writers and <b>writing.</b> Baksidestext/Blurb How is writing made? How do <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> emerge, continue and change in educational writing events? And what kinds of writers and writings can potentially emerge from the writing event? In this thesis Carina Hermansson explores how writing is produced in early childhood education, partly through analyses of the thinking and talking about writing and the writing child provided in scholarly literature since the 19 th century, and partly through analyses of ethnographic documentation of six- to seven-year-olds’ writing activities in two early childhood classrooms. The research identifies how the <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> are an effect of many elements assembled in the writing event, such as computers, learning outcomes, bodily movements, children and teachers, and experiences based on children’s popular cultures. Hermansson posits nomadic writing as a way to account for the connectivity, the movement and change in the <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> <b>writing,</b> thus contributing to an understanding <b>of</b> how the <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> create potentialities for multiple becomings <b>of</b> writers and <b>writing.</b> The findings show that the mutual production <b>of</b> stabilizing <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> and <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> experimentation are vital components for becomings <b>of</b> writers and <b>writing,</b> thus offering a way to view early childhood writing classrooms as sites of experimentation. Nomadic Writing: Exploring <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> in early childhood education is a book about children’s writing and writing development in a society where media, digital technology and new forms of communication and literacy are conceptualized as important in education. It provides researchers and teachers with a conceptual framework for understanding the dynamic <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> <b>writing.</b>   The online version of the thesis differs slightly from the printed version as research articles have been removed for copyright reasons. </p...|$|R
40|$|Every <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>written</b> {{mathematical}} argumentation, {{requires a}} high level of management of semiotic records, articulating semantic structures capable of meaning. This manuscript shows the results of the research project entitled “Analysis and interpretation of semiotics in the <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> mathematical argumentation, <b>written</b> by the 9 th grade students of the Gonzalo Rivera Laguado School in Cúcuta”, the study was assumed from theories surrounding the semiotics and mathematical argumentation, proposed by Peirce, Bachelard, Vygotsky and Duval. The research was developed under the quantitative methodology with a descriptive scope. The esults showed that in the analyzed <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> <b>written</b> mathematica argumentation, the argument loses its strength and relevance due to the inappropriate use of semiotic resources, evidencing conceptual gaps that generate epistemological gaps in mathematical knowledge...|$|R

5|$|The {{characterization}} of Neville Sinclair {{was inspired by}} movie star Errol Flynn, or rather by the image of Flynn that had been popularized by Charles Higham's unauthorized and fabricated biography of the actor, in which he asserted that Flynn was, among other things, a Nazi spy. The film's Neville Sinclair is, like Higham's Flynn, a movie star known {{for his work in}} swashbuckler roles, and who is secretly a Nazi spy. Because Higham's biography of Flynn was not refuted until the late 1980s, the image of Flynn as a closet Nazi remained current all through the arduous <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> and re-writing the script. The other real-life characterization was of Howard Hughes.|$|E

5|$|Murasaki {{began her}} diary after she entered service at Shōshi's court. Much {{of what we}} know about her and her {{experiences}} at court comes from the diary, which covers the period from about 1008 to 1010. The long descriptive passages, some of which may have originated as letters, cover her relationships with the other ladies-in-waiting, Michinaga's temperament, the birth of Shōshi's sons—at Michinaga's mansion rather than at the Imperial Palace—and the <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> Genji, including descriptions of passing newly written chapters to calligraphers for transcriptions. Typical of contemporary court diaries written to honor patrons, Murasaki devotes half to the birth of Shōshi's son Emperor Go-Ichijō, an event of enormous importance to Michinaga: he had planned for it with his daughter's marriage which made him grandfather and de facto regent to an emperor.|$|E
5|$|One of the Wattle Birds, Anderson's {{seventh and}} final novel, was {{published}} in 1994. Set in Sydney, it details three days {{in the life of}} Cecily Ambruss. Although the novel is ostensibly set in the present, the final paragraph of the novel reveals that the three-day sequence has been devised by Cecily as a means of coping with the fact that a year earlier, her mother, Christine had died of breast cancer, while Cecily had been away on holiday. Throughout the novel, Cecily attempts to resolve two quandaries: she does not understand why her mother did not tell her about that fatal illness and let her go overseas, refusing to let family members call her back, even for the funeral, nor why Christine included the cruel stipulation in her will that Cecily must marry before she can inherit. In addition to its adept depiction of the intricacies of social and family life, One of the Wattle Birds speaks to the <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> and creating, as Cecily is herself a writer.|$|E
5|$|The Aniplex {{producer}} of Angel Beats!, Hironori Toba, was interviewed in the November 2009 issue of Dengeki G's Magazine, where he commented that a 13-episode anime with about 21 minutes per episode {{was not enough}} to tell the whole story of Angel Beats! Maeda had envisioned. Therefore, the various additional media, such as the illustrated short stories and manga, contain some of the story that was unable to make it into the anime because of time constraints. Toba wanted fans of the series to be able to enjoy it to the fullest by exploring all of the media types. Maeda found it tiring to go back and forth between Osaka and Tokyo for business meetings {{when he was in the}} <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> the script, and found it difficult to write an entire script by himself, since he had never done that before with any of the games he produced as a member of Key. It was only after the script was done that Maeda was able to work on the music, which he greatly enjoyed and never tired of it. Maeda composed about 15 songs for Girls Dead Monster and spent about two days each composing each song. He made sure to create songs for Girls Dead Monster that high school girls would compose, including the lyrics. Due to this, Maeda pointed out that the opening and ending theme songs for Angel Beats!, which Maeda also composed, sound like they were composed by a different person compared to the Girls Dead Monster songs.|$|E
40|$|Creative Imitation is an {{alternative}} strategy to help students improve their expository writing in college composition. It combines writing by imitation with process modeling to increase student fluency with both the products and <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> <b>writing.</b> For centuries, a technique of "imitatio" was used to teach oral and written language traditions. Isocrates, Quintilian, and Cicero shaped the tradition <b>of</b> imitating <b>writing</b> models. Their principles were revived in the 60 s by two neo-classical educators, Corbett and D'Angelo. Objections {{to the principles of}} imitation to teach writing are analyzed: models intimidate students, imitation focuses on the products instead <b>of</b> the <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> <b>writing,</b> and imitation reduces individual creativity. Some teachers have reported success with student-centered writing-by-imitation exercises in college composition classrooms. They assert that imitation exercises increase student awareness of correct usage, grammar conventions, rhetorical strategies, and paradoxically enable students to develop an "authentic" voice in their own writing...|$|R

5|$|The {{script was}} co-written by Nanase Ohkawa and Junichi Fujisaku, who also {{worked on the}} series. According to Fujisaku, the {{narrative}} of The Last Dark focused on Saya both seeking revenge and searching for purpose after discovering she was being used by cruel humans. The <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>writing</b> The Last Dark ran parallel to Blood-C, and as Ohkawa was preoccupied with the series, Fujisaku put together a basic story and script draft which he expanded and adjusted based on Shiotani's desires for the movie. When Ohkawa, she and Fujisaku together worked to write and polish the final script. Saya's relationships with others despite her non-human status formed {{a key part of}} the movie's themes. According to Ohkawa, one of her main issues was keeping the storytelling as tight as possible within the movie's planned runtime, meaning that some elements of Saya's backstory needed to be cut. While the series took place in a fictional location, the movie used the real-world location of Tokyo, so Ohkawa took extra care to insert realistic details into the script. She found it difficult accommodating the wishes of both Shiotani and Fujisaku's ideas alongside her own in the script.|$|E
