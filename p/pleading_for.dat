5|$|A Venetian fleet forced Vatatzes' {{naval forces}} to withdraw, {{but after the}} Venetians {{departed}} for home the Greeks and Bulgarians besieged Constantinople again in November 1235. John sent letters to European monarchs and the pope, <b>pleading</b> <b>for</b> assistance. Since {{the survival of the}} Latin Empire was in jeopardy, Pope Gregory urged the crusaders to defend Constantinople instead of the Holy Land. A combined naval force from Venice, Genoa, Pisa and Geoffrey II of Achaea broke through the blockade. Asen soon abandoned his alliance with Vatatzes, who was forced to lift the siege in 1236.|$|E
5|$|Although Richard sought {{peace with}} France, {{he took a}} {{different}} approach to the situation in Ireland. The English lordships in Ireland were in danger of being overrun, and the Anglo-Irish lords were <b>pleading</b> <b>for</b> the king to intervene. In the autumn of 1394, Richard left for Ireland, where he remained until May 1395. His army of more than 8,000 men was the largest force brought to the island during the late Middle Ages. The invasion was a success, and a number of Irish chieftains submitted to English overlordship. It {{was one of the most}} successful achievements of Richard's reign, and strengthened the king's support at home, although the consolidation of the English position in Ireland proved to be short-lived.|$|E

He also expects this at our hands, saying, [...] "Who will rise up for me against the evil doers? Who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity?" [...] (Psa 94:16). The apostle did it, and counted himself engaged to do it, where he saith, he preached [...] "the gospel of God with much contention" [...] (I Thess 2:2).

5|$|Born on New Providence Island, she {{completed}} her secondary education {{and became a}} teacher. After teaching for 17 years, Johnson returned to school to earn a master's and doctorate degree in educational administration. During this period, she traveled {{back and forth between}} school and her Bahamian home organizing labor and suffrage efforts. Upon graduation, Johnson was unable to find work because of her activism. She made a compelling speech to the Bahamian legislature in 1959, <b>pleading</b> <b>for</b> women's suffrage and subsequently made a similar plea to the Colonial Office in London. Once the right to vote had been secured, Johnson immediately entered politics in 1961, running in the first election in which women were allowed to participate. Though she lost her bid, she worked with the Progressive Liberal Party to gain Bahamian independence. When the country gained its freedom from colonial rule, Johnson was appointed to the Senate and served the government until her death, a decade later.|$|E
5|$|Forensic entomology: The Song Dynasty (960–1279) {{forensic}} science book Collected Cases of Injustice Rectified published by court judge, physician, medical scientist and writer Song Ci in 1247 contains the oldest known case of forensic entomology. In {{a murder case}} of 1235, a villager was stabbed to death and authorities determined that his wounds were inflicted by a sickle; this was a tool used for cutting rice at harvest time, a fact which led them to suspect a fellow peasant worker was involved. The local magistrate had the villagers assemble {{in the town square}} where they would temporarily relinquish their sickles. Within minutes, a mass of blow flies gathered around one sickle and none other, attracted to the scent of traces of blood unseen by the naked eye. It became apparent to all that the owner of that sickle was the culprit, the latter <b>pleading</b> <b>for</b> mercy as he was detained by authorities.|$|E

At a party, {{one of the students}} hits on Veronica. The student gets more aggressive with Veronica, and when Troy begins to defend her, the student punches him. Later that night, Veronica sees Troy making out with Stacy (Alia Shawkat). When Veronica is sleeping, Troy calls her unexpectedly, <b>pleading</b> <b>for</b> help, and Veronica visits him at the police station, where he has been charged in the date-rape of Stacy. Meanwhile, Keith (Enrico Colantoni) comes to the aid of Cliff (Daran Norris), from whom a briefcase of legal documents was stolen.|$|E

5|$|Several months previously, Texians {{had driven}} all Mexican {{troops out of}} Mexican Texas. About 100Texians were then garrisoned at the Alamo. The Texian force grew {{slightly}} {{with the arrival of}} reinforcements led by eventual Alamo co-commanders James Bowie and William B. Travis. On February 23, approximately 1,500 Mexicans marched into San Antonio de Béxar as {{the first step in a}} campaign to retake Texas. For the next 10 days, the two armies engaged in several skirmishes with minimal casualties. Aware that his garrison could not withstand an attack by such a large force, Travis wrote multiple letters <b>pleading</b> <b>for</b> more men and supplies, but the Texians were reinforced by fewer than 100 men.|$|E
5|$|The Combat: Woman <b>Pleading</b> <b>for</b> the Vanquished {{is a large}} painting, 399cm (13ft 1in) across. It {{depicts a}} {{defeated}} soldier, kneeling in front of another soldier. The defeated fighter strains to free himself from {{the grip of the}} victorious warrior, who stands, raising a sword. A kneeling woman clutches the waist of the victorious soldier, raising her face to him to beg him to spare his defeated foe. The defeated warrior has a stronger body, a face more in keeping with the conventions of attractiveness at the time, and a more sympathetic expression, while the victorious man is darker skinned and has an expression of blank fierceness. The vanquished soldier's sword has broken, and lies beside him on the ground.|$|E

Their reputation combined with the stories told concerning the firepower of these battleships' 16-inch guns are such that when they were brought out of retirement in the 1980s in response to increased Soviet Naval activity—and in particular, in response to the commissioning of the s—the United States Navy was inundated with requests from former sailors <b>pleading</b> <b>for</b> a recall to active duty so they could serve aboard one of the battleships.|$|E

5|$|The {{government}} {{was determined to}} give the soldiers a fair trial so {{there could be no}} grounds for retaliation from the British and so moderates would not be alienated from the Patriot cause. After several lawyers with Loyalist leanings refused to defend him, Preston sent a request to John Adams, <b>pleading</b> <b>for</b> him to work on the case. Adams, who was already a leading Patriot and who was contemplating a run for public office, agreed to help, in the interest of ensuring a fair trial. Adams was joined by Josiah Quincy II after the latter was assured that the Sons of Liberty would not oppose his appointment, and by Robert Auchmuty, a Loyalist. They were assisted by Sampson Salter Blowers, whose chief duty was to investigate the jury pool, and Paul Revere, who drew a detailed map of the bodies {{to be used in the}} trial of the British soldiers held responsible. Massachusetts Solicitor General Samuel Quincy and private attorney Robert Treat Paine, hired by the town of Boston, handled the prosecution. Preston was tried separately in late October 1770. He was acquitted after the jury was convinced that he had not ordered the troops to fire.|$|E
5|$|Soon after Stalingrad, Khrushchev {{met with}} {{personal}} tragedy, {{as his son}} Leonid, a fighter pilot, was apparently shot down and killed in action on 11 March 1943. The circumstances of Leonid's death remain obscure and controversial, as none of his fellow fliers stated that they witnessed him being shot down, nor was his plane found or body recovered. As a result, Leonid's fate {{has been the subject}} of considerable speculation. One theory has Leonid surviving the crash and collaborating with the Germans, and when he was recaptured by the Soviets, Stalin ordering him shot despite Nikita Khrushchev <b>pleading</b> <b>for</b> his life. This supposed killing is used to explain why Khrushchev later denounced Stalin in the Secret Speech. While there is no supporting evidence for this account in Soviet files, some historians allege that Leonid Khrushchev's file was tampered with after the war. In later years, Leonid Khrushchev's wingmate stated that he saw his plane disintegrate, but did not report it. Khrushchev biographer Taubman speculates that this omission was most likely to avoid the possibility of being seen as complicit in the death of the son of a Politburo member. In mid-1943, Leonid's wife, Liuba Khrushcheva, was arrested on accusations of spying and sentenced to five years in a labor camp, and her son (by another relationship), Tolya, was placed in a series of orphanages. Leonid's daughter, Yulia, was raised by Nikita Khrushchev and his wife.|$|E
