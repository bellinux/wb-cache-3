40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper was}} to perform a comprehensive review of psychophysically determined maximum acceptable <b>pushing</b> and <b>pulling</b> forces. Factors affecting <b>pushing</b> and <b>pulling</b> forces are identified and discussed. Recent studies show a significant decrease (compared to previous studies) in maximum acceptable forces for males but not for females when <b>pushing</b> and <b>pulling</b> on a treadmill. A comparison of <b>pushing</b> and <b>pulling</b> forces measured using a high inertia cart with those measured on a treadmill shows that the <b>pushing</b> and <b>pulling</b> forces using high inertia cart are higher for males but are about the same for females. It is concluded that the recommendations of Snook and Ciriello (1991) for <b>pushing</b> and <b>pulling</b> forces are still valid and provide reasonable recommendations for ergonomics practitioners. Regression equations as a function of handle height, frequency of exertion and pushing/pulling distance are provided to estimate maximum initial and sustained forces for <b>pushing</b> and <b>pulling</b> acceptable to 75 % male and female workers. At present {{it is not clear whether}} <b>pushing</b> or <b>pulling</b> should be favored. Similarly, it is not clear what handle heights would be optimal for <b>pushing</b> and <b>pulling.</b> Epidemiological studies are needed to determine relationships between psychophysically determined maximum acceptable <b>pushing</b> and <b>pulling</b> forces and risk of musculoskeletal injuries, in particular to low back and shoulders.

In this paper we first review the di#erent possible adaptation models and discuss the concepts of <b>push,</b> <b>pull</b> and hybrid adaptation.

40|$|Although <b>pushing</b> and <b>pulling</b> is {{very common}} in {{occupational}} settings, this type of manual materials handling is less well studied than lifting and carrying. Several issues should be considered when obtaining exposure measures in epidemiological field studies on <b>pushing</b> and <b>pulling.</b> The {{purpose of this article}} is threefold: (i) to critically evaluate different methods to assess <b>push</b> and <b>pull</b> forces, (ii) to describe measures of exposure to <b>pushing</b> and <b>pulling,</b> and (iii) to consider measurement strategies for assessment of exposure to <b>pushing</b> and <b>pulling.</b> Firstly, information on the level of exerted forces with the accuracy needed for epidemiology can only be obtained from direct measurement methods. These methods are particularly required when <b>push</b> and <b>pull</b> tasks are biomechanically analysed, implying that also force direction and point of application relative to the worker have to be assessed. Secondly, to obtain a limited number of external exposure measures that reflect exposure to <b>pushing</b> and <b>pulling</b> over time, aggregation of various force measurements is suggested. Internal exposure measures and parameters corresponding to guidelines are also described. Thirdly, for truck drivers and refuse collectors a strategy of approximately five repeated measurements for each representative working situation is advised to obtain a reliable estimate of an individual's exposure to <b>pushing</b> and <b>pulling.</b> Relevance to industryAn overview is given of methods to assess forces accompanying <b>pushing</b> and <b>pulling,</b> which are very common activities in industry. Examples of exposure measures and measurement strategies in studies on adverse health effects of <b>pushing</b> and <b>pulling</b> are presented. Such studies should eventually stimulate prevention of work-related musculoskeletal disorders. Copyright (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B. V...|$|R

30|$|Separating remote content {{acquisition}} from actual ingestion {{was also}} a realization of my PhD dissertation work wherein which I demonstrated that data movement and acquisition technologies experience largely different qualities of service depending on data dissemination scenarios – so by separating <b>Push</b> <b>Pull</b> as its own component, we could isolate a major potential bottleneck in a data-intensive and grid software system, allowing it to evolve independent, and be improved independently of local ingestion. So, with <b>Push</b> <b>Pull</b> in hand, I also drew from Nutch and my experience building the Apache Tika [14] content detection and analysis framework to construct the CAS crawler, an automated ingestion, file detection and classification technology that works in concert with <b>Push</b> <b>Pull</b> to ingest remote and local content.

This thesis investigates if <b>push</b> and <b>pull</b> factors leading into violent Islamic extremism differentiate between men and women. Furthermore, it assesses how preventive measures from The United Kingdom, Sweden and Denmark targets <b>push</b> and <b>pull</b> factors and if these are sensitive to sex. To fulfil this objective an exploratory thematic {{analysis was used to}} synthesise secondary qualitative research surrounding <b>push</b> and <b>pull</b> factors. The <b>push</b> and <b>pull</b> factor analysis revealed three trends: there were limited variation in the overall categories describing the <b>push</b> and <b>pull</b> factors present for men and women; what caused <b>push</b> and <b>pull</b> factors to manifest differed according to sex; and, there were differences in how much men and women were affected by these factors. The assessment of prevention measures showed that none of the measures explicitly mentioned <b>push</b> and <b>pull</b> factors, yet they all had the potential of targeting these. Sex was included in some aspects of the measures, but was not a consideration in relation to the targeting of <b>push</b> and <b>pull</b> factors. The thesis ends with a discussion of what implications the found results have for practice and offers suggestions to how prevention measures can be improved...|$|R
40|$|Objectives Low-back and {{shoulder}} complaints {{were examined in}} relation to self-reported and objectively assessed exposure to work-related <b>pushing</b> and <b>pulling.</b> Methods Workers from several companies (eg, nursing homes and flower auctions) with <b>pushing</b> and <b>pulling</b> tasks and, as reference, workers without physically demanding tasks were invited to participate. Altogether 829 workers initially received a questionnaire, of whom 459 responded both initially and after I year of follow-up. Initially, self-reported exposure to <b>pushing</b> and <b>pulling</b> was assessed by questionnaire. Furthermore, {{a representative sample of}} 131 workers was observed at work using TRAC (task recording and analysis on computer) to assess exposure to <b>pushing</b> and <b>pulling</b> objectively. For exposure to <b>pushing</b> and <b>pulling,</b> the workers were classified into a reference group and medium and high exposure groups. Initially and in the follow-up, the 12 -month prevalence of low-back {{and shoulder}} complaints was assessed. Complaints reported in the follow-up were separately used as dependent variables to calculate prevalence rate ratios (PR) in a Cox's proportional hazard regression analysis. Results The adjusted PR values were not significant for low-back complaints. For shoulder complaints, both the medium and high exposure groups showed significant adjusted PR values for self-reported exposure and observed duration of <b>pushing</b> and <b>pulling</b> when compared with the reference group (PR range 2. 18 - 4. 86). For the observed frequency of <b>pushing</b> and <b>pulling,</b> only the medium exposure group showed a significant PR, of 3. 95. Conclusions The findings suggest a rather strong relationship between <b>pushing</b> and <b>pulling</b> and shoulder complaints.

40|$|Maize is {{becoming}} the major food crop around Lake Victoria. Major constraints to its production are Striga, stem borer, and declining soil fertility. Innovative integrated technologies have been developed: the <b>push</b> <b>pull</b> system (intercropping with Desmodium and surrounded by Napier grass), soybean and Crotalaria rotations, and imidazolinone-resistant (IR) maize seed. In 12 demonstration trials in four villages in Siaya and Vihiga districts (Kenya) and two villages in Busia (Uganda) in 2003 and 2004, 504 farmers evaluated all cropping systems and a mono-cropped continuous maize, each cropped with IR or local maize, and supplemented or not with fertilizer, totaling 16 treatments. Farmers evaluated all treatments for yield, resistance to Striga and stem borer, improvement of soil fertility, and provided an overall evaluation score, using an ordered scale of 1 (very poor) to 5 (very good). Data were analyzed using ordinal regression, estimating log odds ratios. The results show significant preferences for all treatments over the control. <b>Push</b> <b>pull</b> with IR and fertilizer had the highest log odds ratio (2. 93), so the odds of farmers preferring this treatment are 18. 7 times the odds that farmers prefer the control. The odds ratios for the other <b>push</b> <b>pull</b> combinations were generally highest (9 15), followed by the rotation systems with Crotalaria (3. 5 7. 0), and soybeans, especially with IR maize and fertilizer (odds ratio of 5. 7). In mono-cropping systems, IR maize was only appreciated in combination with fertilizer, and then only in 2004. <b>Push</b> <b>pull</b> and Crotalaria were more appreciated in 2004 than in 2003. Farmers in Vihiga had a stronger preference for <b>push</b> <b>pull,</b> and those in Busia for soybean rotations. Significant differences among farmers were observed, but the effects were small. Women appreciated <b>push</b> <b>pull</b> more than men, while other technologies were gender-neutral. Older farmers {{were more likely to}} prefer <b>push</b> <b>pull</b> and Crotalaria with fertilizer. Livestock ownership was not found to have an effect on technology preferences. Measured yield, stem borer and Striga infestation all had significant but small effects, although their inclusion did not eliminate the treatment effects, indicating that other factors are still important. OLS of the scores for different criteria on the overall score shows yield {{to be the most important}} criterion (coefficient of 0. 40), followed by soil fertility enhancement (0. 25) and Striga resistance (0. 13). Labor saving (0. 09) and stem borer resistance (0. 03) are relatively minor criteria. This research shows that scoring and analysis with ordinal regression is a convenient way to solicit and analyze farmers preferences for new technologies, with wide applicability in farming systems and participatory research. Its application here shows that farmers like the new technologies, especially <b>push</b> <b>pull,</b> but that there are substantial differences between years, sites and farmers. The use of this method can be very helpful to define and focus further research and formulate specific and targeted recommendations for agricultural extension. Peer-reviewe...|$|R

Unlike the KSRS network, we can find policies under which our <b>push</b> <b>pull</b> network works at full utilization, with both servers busy at all times, and without being congested. We perform an asymptotic analysis of the <b>push</b> <b>pull</b> network under these policies to quantify its behavior: We show that under fluid scaling the fluid model of the network is stable. We adapt the proofs of Dai, to show that as a result the queues of jobs waiting for pull operation are positive Harris recurrent.

The approximation shows that the two output streams are highly negatively correlated...|$|R
