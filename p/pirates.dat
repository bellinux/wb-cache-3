5|$|After the hijacking, Cofresí adopted Anne as his flagship. Although she is popularly {{believed}} to have been renamed El Mosquito, all official documents use her formal name. Anne was quickly used to intercept a merchant off the coast of Vieques who was completing a voyage from Saint Croix to Puerto Rico. Like others before it, the fate of the captured ship and its crew is unknown. The Spanish countered with an expedition from the port of Patillas. Captain Sebastian Quevedo commanded a small boat, Esperanza, to find the <b>pirates</b> but was unsuccessful after several days at sea. At the same time, de la Torre pressured the regional military commanders to take action against the <b>pirates</b> and undercover agents monitored maritime traffic in most coastal towns. The <b>pirates</b> docked Anne in Jobos Bay before sunset, a pattern reported by the local militia to southern region commander Tomás de Renovales. At this time the <b>pirates</b> sailed Anne towards Peñuelas, where the ship was recognized. Cofresí's last capture was on March 5, 1825, when he commanded the hijacking of a boat owned by Vicente Antoneti in Salinas.|$|E
