50|$|A {{pyrotechnic}} {{composition is}} a substance or mixture of substances designed {{to produce an}} effect by heat, light, sound, gas/smoke {{or a combination of}} these, as a result of non-detonative self-sustaining exothermic chemical reactions. <b>Pyrotechnic</b> <b>substances</b> do not rely on oxygen from external sources to sustain the reaction.|$|R
25|$|In {{contrast}} to <b>pyrotechnic</b> payloads, pyrophoric <b>substances</b> use the oxygen {{from the environment}} for oxidation. Hence specific energy density of pyrophorics is always higher as compared to any pyrotechnic; however, pyrophorics suffer from low oxygen partial pressure at greater heights.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{initiation}} of <b>pyrotechnic</b> <b>substances</b> by a laser light {{has been studied}} for more than 30 years. But until recently {{the use of this}} technology for defence applications encountered three main technical problems: the volume and the mass of lasers, the linear loss of optical fibres and their possible damage caused by the transport of strong laser power. Recent technical progress performed in the field of electrical and optical devices are now very promising for future opto-pyrotechnic functional chains. The objective {{of this paper is to}} present a demonstrator developed in order to initiate in a synchronous way four optical detonators and to measure the dispersion of their functioning times. It includes four compact Q-switched Nd:Cr:GSGG solid laser sources, pumped by flash lamp (energy ≃ 110 mJ, FWHM ≃ 8. 5 ns), two ultra-fast electro-optical selectors (based on RTP crystals) used to steer the laser beam and six optical fibre lines to transmit the laser pulses to the optical detonators. The set-up integrates also complex control and safety systems, as well as cameras allowing an optimal alignment of optical fibres. Experiments led us to initiate in a synchronous way four detonators with a mean scattering of 50 ns. The perspectives in this domain of initiation concern mainly the miniaturization and the hardening to the environments of electrical and optical components...|$|R

Hence specific energy density of pyrophorics is always higher as compared to any pyrotechnic; however, pyrophorics suffer from low oxygen partial pressure at greater heights.A typical liquid pyrophoric fuel is triethylaluminium. Upon combustion of triethylaluminium, a selective IR spectrum is obtained, which is mainly determined from carbon dioxide and water vapour. Any transient or permanent combustion product of aluminium are not IR-active in this region of the electromagnetic spectrum.|$|R
