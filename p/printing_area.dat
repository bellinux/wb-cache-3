5000|$|Solvent inks: The main {{ingredient}} of these inks are {{volatile organic compounds}} (VOCs), organic chemical compounds that have high vapor pressures. Color is achieved with pigments rather than dyes for excellent fade-resistance. The chief advantage of solvent inks {{is that they are}} comparatively inexpensive and enable printing on flexible, uncoated vinyl substrates, which are used to produce vehicle graphics, billboards, banners and adhesive decals. Disadvantages include the vapour produced by the solvent and the need to dispose of used solvent. Unlike most aqueous inks, prints made using solvent-based inks are generally waterproof and ultraviolet-resistant (for outdoor use) without special over-coatings. The high print speed of many solvent printers demands special drying equipment, usually a combination of heaters and blowers. The substrate is usually heated immediately before and after the print heads apply ink. Solvent inks are divided into two sub-categories: hard solvent ink offers the greatest durability without specialized over-coatings but requires specialized ventilation of the <b>printing</b> <b>area</b> to avoid exposure to hazardous fumes, while Mild or [...] "Eco" [...] solvent inks, while still not as safe as aqueous inks, are intended for use in enclosed spaces without specialized ventilation of the <b>printing</b> <b>area.</b> Mild solvent inks have rapidly gained popularity in recent years as their color quality and durability have increased while ink cost has dropped significantly.|$|E

From sampling factories review [1]-[5], there are three aspects of environment problem of productive process that are detailed as follow: air pollution, wastewater, and energy losses. This research has the purpose to identify the use of resources and pollution point of sources including the causes in processing of offset packaging printing factory in order to applies the principles of clean technology for air pollution reduction, standardization of waste water and electrical power reduction in a packaging and printing factory. The case study employed was a packaging and printing factory with a capacity of 2, 241. 2 Ton/Year. The proposal for cleaner technology is to apply an air-conditioning system with an Evaporative Cooling System that reduces power consumption of 149, 841. 79 kWh/year or 39. 66 % with saved costs equivalent to 14, 210. 49 USD/year. The energy saving air-conditioning system also reduces intensive inhalants in the air concentration of the production area (<b>printing</b> <b>area)</b> to reach the standard criteria. Waste water separation for appropriate water management helps save a total of 119. 69 USD/year and reduces waste water by 0. 56 m 3 /year or 0. 8 %. Construction of a waste water treatment system in the first year enhances the lawful processing which can save 6580 USD/year and reduce waste water by 4. 83 m 3 /year or 6. 96 %, and provides water recycling of 45. 201 m 3 /year. A year after cost expenditure for the system is 1246. 17 USD/year, with, when compared to delivering waste water for eradication, can save 241, 215. 03 Bath/year...|$|E
40|$|The project {{consists}} {{in the design}} of a concrete 3 D printer that would originally be used for manufacturing street furniture. It is divided into two main parts which are the frame and software design. The structure where the robot is attached to has to follow some requirements to make it as flexible as possible. Transportation and stiffness are probably the most important facts to take into account in the design as long as the <b>printing</b> <b>area</b> is also satisfied. The solution found is to design a frame made out of aluminum extrusion that is light, stiff and compact {{enough to be able to}} be moved and print without any preparation required. Regarding the software, it has been developed using the well known program MATLAB. In this platform a few steps have been followed to process STL 1 files and generate the RAPID code used on ABB Robotstudio. Once the STL files have been read and their data has been stored a slicing algorithm divides the CAD 2 design into many layers. Then all solid areas of the drawing are identified and an algorithm starts analyzing the Hamiltonian paths/cycles on every layer. Finally, the data collected is translated in RAPID and stored into a TXT file. An additional DOF 3 has also been added to increase the printing volume. It is a linear motion device which moves the robot along the x axis. The idea is that the control is done with a micro controller unit that interacts with the robot’s cabinet to indicate how far the robot platform should move. This new device would be called when the software detects the robot is reaching a singular point (a joint out of range) ...|$|E
40|$|Graphical gravure {{printing}} {{is a very}} reliable process to transfer smallest amounts of fluid droplets to a substrate. Nevertheless, enabling this printing technique to produce large-area, ultra-thin layers for applications such as {{organic light emitting diodes}} (OLEDs) is a challenging task. This application not only imposes strong requirements on the printing technology but also on large-area measurement methods. Characterizing the homogeneity of sub- 100 nm thin layers across the total <b>printing</b> <b>area</b> is one of the two central topics of the present investigation. Utilizing optical interference from the thin film samples I developed and evaluated a method which successfully determined the thickness of thin, organic semiconductor layers with an accuracy better than 5 nm. Sample sizes of up to 150 × 150 mm² could be characterized within seconds using two hardware setups. I enabled a microscope and a modified flatbed scanner to acquire conventional RGB-images of the thin film samples. These images were then compared to a corresponding physical model using MATLAB resulting in a laterally resolved thickness map. The method is predestinated for being part of an inline process control. In {{the second part of the}} thesis, I deduced a physical understanding of {{gravure printing}} to produce ultra-thin, homogeneous layers from low viscous ink solutions which are based on small molecules dissolved in toluene. To this purpose, I processed on two consecutively mounted 150 × 150 mm² ITO-coated glass substrates with varying process parameters, resulting in a total number of 128 different gravure printed fields, each 30 × 30 mm² in size. Applying the large-area characterization method developed in the first part, I measured the thicknesses of all sub- 100 nm printed layers (with a total area of ~ 1800 cm²). This thickness data was analyzed regarding several surface parameters, such as roughness, dominant lateral wavelength, skewness and kurtosis. These surface parameters were referred to the physical models of fluid and thin film dynamics with respect to the underlying process parameters. As a consequence, two distinct process windows for the gravure printing process to produce homogeneous, ultra-thin layers were identified. The process windows were defined by two types of ink transfer mechanisms, namely single cell transfer and film splitting transfer, as well as appropriate film leveling and drying times. The two process windows for producing homogeneous, ultra-thin layers using gravure printing have been reported in the literature and were demonstrated through the present experiments. By combining the two different topics, for the first time, these experimentally observed process windows were theoretically verified...|$|E
