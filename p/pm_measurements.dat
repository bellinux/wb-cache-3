40|$|We {{present a}} multi-epoch Hubble Space Telescope (HST) study of stellar proper motions (PMs) for four fields {{spanning}} 200 degrees along the Sagittarius (Sgr) stream: one trailing arm field, one field near the Sgr dwarf spheroidal tidal radius, and two leading arm fields. We determine absolute PMs {{of dozens of}} individual stars per field, using established techniques that use distant background galaxies as stationary reference frame. Stream stars are identified based on combined color-magnitude diagram and PM information. The results are broadly consistent with the few existing <b>PM</b> <b>measurements</b> for the Sgr galaxy and the trailing arm. However, our new results provide the highest PM accuracy for the stream to date, the first <b>PM</b> <b>measurements</b> for the leading arm, and the first <b>PM</b> <b>measurements</b> for individual stream stars; we also serendipitously determine the PM of the globular cluster NGC~ 6652. In the trailing-arm field, the individual PMs allow us to kinematically separate trailing-arm stars from leading-arm stars that are 360 degrees further ahead in their orbit. Also, in three of our fields we find indications that two distinct kinematical components may exist within the same arm and wrap of the stream. Qualitative comparison of the HST data to the predictions of the Law & Majewski and Penarrubia et al. N-body models show that the <b>PM</b> <b>measurements</b> closely follow the predicted trend with Sgr longitude. This provides a successful consistency check on the <b>PM</b> <b>measurements,</b> {{as well as on}} these N-body approaches (which were not tailored to fit any PM data).

The SCS projects followed the three major research areas called for by the U. S. EPA for the Supersites Program, i. e.

Intensive aerosol measurements, well beyond the traditional PM 2. 5 mass, sulfate and nitrate concentrations, were conducted in several areas of the LAB. These included particle number concentrations, size distributions, and detailed PM chemical composition as a function of particle size.

In this report the theory and design of the LIDAR PM system is emphasized. Measurements were made for three test vehicles, an Isuzu, a Ford van and a Ford pickup. The LIDAR <b>PM</b> <b>measurements</b> for both parking lot and freeway onramp conditions were highest for the Isuzu. Furthermore, <b>PM</b> <b>measurements</b> for the Ford pickup were higher for the Series 1 configuration than for the Series 2 configuration. The LIDAR particulate matter system continues to be improved. As configured for this field test, uncertainty in the measurements occurs when the PM and CO 2 beams detect different portions of the exhaust plume. This problem has since been solved by developing a CO 2 channel (separate {{from that of the}} RSD 3000) that is collinear with the LIDAR beam. A second limitation is that the sensitivity is not great enough.

40|$|Regulatory {{agencies}} {{are in the}} process of implementing an in-use testing program for heavy-duty diesel vehicles that will include testing with portable emissions measurement systems (PEMS) under in-use driving conditions. An important aspect of this regulation is the Measurement Allowance program where EPA, CARB, and the Engine Manufacturers Association (EMA) are working together to systematically evaluate various sources of error for gaseous and <b>PM</b> <b>measurements</b> with PEMS in comparison with laboratory measurements. This error is then accounted for in the regulatory standards as a “Measurement Allowance”. A comprehensive program has already been conducted for the gas-phase measurement allowance, with the PM measurement allowance program about to begin. The main objective of this work was to provide preliminary measurements from PM PEMS to assess the accuracy of <b>PM</b> <b>measurements</b> under in-use conditions and provide a basis for the development of the more comprehensive Measurement Allowance program. The MASC utilized the University of California, Riverside (UCR) Bourns College of Engineering – Center for Environmental Research and Technology’s (CE-CERT) Mobile Emissions Laboratory (MEL) to perform the initial in-use PM PEMS evaluation. For this program, PM PEMS were directly compared with the MEL over a series of different on-road driving conditions. Prior to the on-road testing, MEL underwent a 40 CFR Part 1065 self-audit focused on PM sampling. In-use measurements were made from a class 8 truck whose in-use PM emissions levels averaged 0. 043 g/hp-h, which is near the 0. 03 g/hp-h in-use threshold level. The goal was to test a vehicle at or slightly above the Not-To-Exceed (NTE) threshold to investigate sources of error for the PM instruments at levels where their performance is most critical. The on-road driving courses included segments near sea level, in coastal regions, in desert regions, and on longer uphill inclines. <b>PM</b> <b>measurements</b> in real-time were made with a variety of different PM instruments from manufacturers preparing for the PM Measurement Allowance program, as well as other commercially available instruments such as a Dekati DMM and TSI Dustrak. These measurements were directly compared with gravimetric PM mass measurements that were collected with the MEL under 1065 compliant sampling conditions. Measurements were made under conditions where NTE events would be expected (e. g., uphill driving segments) and for varying durations to provide a range of mass loadings. Comparisons of the performance of the instruments and PM mass measurements from 0. 02 to 0. 1 g/hp-h are be presented.

The implied Galactocentric velocity vectors for Draco and Sculptor have radial and tangential components: (V_rad,V_tan) _Dra = (- 88. 6, 161. 4) +/- (4. 4, 5. 6) km/s; and (V_rad,V_tan) _Scl = (72. 6, 200. 2) +/- (1. 3, 10. 8) km/s. We study the detailed orbital history of both Draco and Sculptor via numerical orbit integrations. Orbital periods of Draco and Sculptor {{are found to be}} 1 - 2 and 2 - 5 Gyrs, respectively, accounting for uncertainties in the MW mass. We also study the influence of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) on the orbits of Draco and Sculptor. Overall, the inclusion of the LMC increases the scatter in the orbital results. Based on our calculations, Draco shows a rather wide range of orbital parameters depending on the MW mass and inclusion/exclusion of the LMC, but Sculptor's orbit is very well constrained with its most recent pericentric approach to the MW being 0. 3 - 0. 4 Gyr ago.

40|$|The {{satellite}} galaxies of the Milky Way (MW) {{define a}} vast polar structure (VPOS), a thin plane {{perpendicular to the}} MW disc. Proper motion (<b>PM)</b> <b>measurements</b> are now available {{for all of the}} 11 brightest, `classical' satellites and allow an updated analysis of the alignment of their orbital poles with this spatial structure. The coherent orbital alignment of 7 to 9 out of 11 satellites demonstrates that the VPOS is a rotationally stabilized structure and not only a pressure-supported, flattened ellipsoid. This allows us to empirically and model independently predict the PMs of almost all satellite galaxies by assuming that the MW satellite galaxies orbit within the VPOS. As a test of our method, the predictions are best met by satellites whose PMs are already well constrained, as expected because more uncertain measurements tend to deviate more from the true values. Improved and new <b>PM</b> <b>measurements</b> will further test these predictions. A strong alignment of the satellite galaxy orbital poles is not expected in dark matter based simulations of galaxy formation. Coherent orbital directions of satellite galaxies are, however, a natural consequence of tidal dwarf galaxies formed together in the debris of a galaxy collision. The orbital poles of the MW satellite galaxies therefore lend further support to tidal scenarios for the origin of the VPOS and are a very significant challenge for the standard LCDM model of cosmology. We also note that the dependence of the MW satellite speeds on Galactocentric distance appear to map an effective potential with a constant velocity of approximately 240 km/s to about 250 kpc.

In this study, the accuracy of an instrument for <b>PM</b> <b>measurement</b> using the light scattering method was improved {{with the help of}} a linear regression analysis technique to continuously measure the PM 10 concentrations in subway stations. In addition, an air quality monitoring system based on environmental sensors was implemented to display and record the data of PM 10, CO 2, temperature, and humidity. Through experimental studies, we found that ventilation fans could improve air quality and decrease PM 10 concentrations in the tunnels effectively by increasing the air flow rate...|$|R
40|$|The FAG-Eberline 62 I-N {{automatic}} beta-dust monitors {{operate within}} the framework of the Netherlands National Air Quality Monitoring Network (LML) to carry out <b>PM</b> 10 <b>measurements.</b> A correction factor of 1. 33 is adopted to compensate the 25 % underestimation when using the beta-method compared to the PM 10 reference method (e. g. Klein Filter Gerat). Several series of laboratory and field experiments were performed to determine quality of the <b>PM</b> 10 <b>measurements</b> and to explain the use of the correction factor. Inlet heating and sampling on a relative warm filter causes some of the aerosol to vaporise. This seems to justify the compensation for the loss of ammonia nitrate aerosol and organic aerosol. However, the experiments also show the correction to be location dependent. The factor of 1. 33 is too high for agricultural areas, where ammonia levels are relatively high and organic aerosol levels relatively low, and too low for urban areas with considerable traffic. For this reason we have taken the happy medium. The differences found between the measurements and the models can thus be partially explained by this discrepancy between agricultural and urban areas...|$|R
