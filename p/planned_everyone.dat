Encouraged by Jim's argument that Jim has never had to pay out on a policy so that the marriage is a sure thing, Steve accepts. The upcoming marriage is jeopardized by Steve's ex-girlfriend, Mickey (Peggy Moran), and Cynthia's disapproving Aunt Kitty. The policy is underwritten by a nightclub owner, Roscoe (William Frawley), who sends two enforcers - Abbott and Costello - to ensure that the wedding occurs as <b>planned.</b> <b>Everyone</b> involved in the situation winds up sailing or flying to San Marcos (a fictional South American country), where another complication arises, when Lucky falls for Cynthia. Lucky winds up marrying Cynthia, but Roscoe does not have to pay the $1-million because Steve ends up marrying Mickey.|$|E

2500|$|Besides the {{argument}} {{over whether the}} returns on Social Security contributions should or {{can be compared to}} returns on private investment instruments, {{there is the question of}} whether the contributions are nonetheless analogous to pooled insurance premiums charged by for-profit commercial insurance companies to maintain and generate a return on a [...] "risk pool of funds". Like any insurance program, Social Security [...] "spreads risk" [...] as the program protects workers and covered family members against loss of income from the wage earner's retirement, disability, or death. For example, a worker who becomes disabled at a young age could receive a large return relative to the amount they contributed in FICA before becoming disabled, since disability benefits can continue for life. As in private insurance <b>plans,</b> <b>everyone</b> in the particular insurance pool is insured against the same risks, but not everyone will benefit to the same extent.|$|R
50|$|Dwight (Rainn Wilson), {{not wanting}} Jim as a boss, {{complains}} about {{the unfairness of}} Jim's decision despite being a salesperson, as do all the non-sales people.

Michael and Jim go back into the conference room to decide how to handle the raise issue. They ultimately decide that the raises should be performance-based, and decide to take turns placing beans on employee pictures, with each bean representing a small raise. When Michael and Jim leave the conference room, Dwight goes into the conference room and shows the employees their <b>plan.</b> <b>Everyone</b> gets upset at Michael and Jim for this, particularly Pam (Jenna Fischer), whose picture did not have any beans, as Jim was trying to remain unbiased.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{revolved}} around the idea that sound within light is the primary medium God used to bring all of creation into existence (creatio).

This simply means that nature is providentially geared to move in a specific direction, according to God’s overall <b>plan</b> for <b>everyone’s</b> benefit. [URL]...|$|R
50|$|These works did {{not present}} prophecies or scriptures in the {{ordinary}} sense: the Etrusca Disciplina foretold nothing itself.

50|$|An airline, rail or {{shipping}} company can book more customers onto a vehicle than {{can actually be}} accommodated by an aircraft, train or cruise ship.

Business travellers often cancel at the last minute, when their meetings take more time than <b>planned.</b> If <b>everyone</b> shows up, at least in the case of airlines, the overbooking will cause an oversale.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Ineffective {{meetings}} occur {{frequently and}} partic-ipants leave with different understandings {{of what has}} been decided upon. For meetings that require quick responses (e. g., disaster-response <b>planning),</b> <b>everyone</b> must leave the meeting on the same page to ensure the successful execution of the mission. Detecting patterns of weak agreements in planning meetings is the first step towards designing an intelligent agent that encourages team members to revisit decisions that may adversely affect the team’s performance, and to spur dialog that results in higher quality plans. This paper presents a statistical approach to learning patterns of strong and weak agreements without using domain-specific content or keywords, meaning the algorithm takes as input information about how the team plans but does not require potentially sensitive data on what is being planned. Our approach applies statistical machine learning to dialog features, which prior studies in cognitive psychology have shown qualitatively capture the level of joint commitment to plan choices. We analyze a real-world conversation dataset, the AMI corpus, to quantitatively verify that dialog features improve the estimation of strength of agreements over prior approaches. We show these results are consistent across a number of different supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms, and that can achieve up to 94 % average accuracy in estimating the strength of agreements.
