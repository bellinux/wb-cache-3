500|$|The Dovecote was {{probably}} {{built in the}} late 16th century. It has been designated as a Grade II* listed building and Scheduled Ancient Monument. It is approximately [...] high and [...] in diameter, with walls around [...] thick. In the 18th century the floor level and door were raised among several major alterations. The lower tiers of nest holes were blocked to protect against brown rats which {{had arrived in the}} Britain in 1720 and reached Somerset by 1760. A revolving ladder, known as a [...] "potence", was installed to allow the <b>pigeon</b> <b>keeper</b> to search the nest holes more easily. In the 19th century two feeding platforms were added to the axis of the revolving ladder. When the ladder was installed in the 16th century the base rests on a pin driven into a beam on the floor. The head of the pin sits in a metal cup in the base of the wooden pillar, which means the mechanism has never had to be oiled. When the Dunster Castle estate was sold the dovecote was bought by the Parochial church council and opened to the public. Extensive repairs were undertaken in 1989.|$|E
2500|$|There {{have been}} several portrayals of pigeon keeping and pigeon fanciers in the arts. [...] One of the more famous portrayals of this hobby was in the film On The Waterfront where the main character, Terry Malloy, is a <b>pigeon</b> <b>keeper.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Pigeon fanciers {{often have}} their pigeon lofts in {{suitably}} modified garden sheds. In Glasgow {{and other areas}} of Scotland {{there has been a}} tradition of <b>pigeon</b> <b>keepers</b> building their own freestanding urban pigeon lofts, or doocots, standing about 4m high in areas of waste ground close to housing estates. [...] In New York City, pigeon fanciers often build pigeon lofts {{on the roof of the}} building.|$|R
2500|$|Ten {{pairs of}} pigeons can produce eight squabs each month without being fed {{especially}} by the <b>pigeon</b> <b>keepers.</b> For a greater yield, commercially raised squab may {{be produced in}} a two-nest system, where the mother lays two new eggs in a second nest while the squabs are still growing in the first nest, fed by their father. [...] Establishing two breeding lines has also been suggested as a strategy, where one breeding line is selected for prolificacy {{and the other is}} selected for [...] "parental performance".|$|R

40|$|This is {{a memoir}} – a {{narrative}} work of creative nonfiction. This story takes place over a single day, {{during the summer}} of 1992, when the life of a thirteen-year old boy falls apart. Years of misbehaving culminate into something so devastating that his world has no other options but to explode. The day starts with his mother selling off his beloved pigeons, followed by his father’s stealing of a famous painter’s painting, all the while the boy is terrified by the possibility of having impregnated one of his cousins, who is five years his senior. During this transformative day, he experiences, like never before, the distress of living and an intense passion for the life yet to come. In this memoir, A Sentimental <b>Pigeon</b> <b>Keeper,</b> the narrator not only captures the life of a thirteen-year old boy in Jessore, Bangladesh, in the early 1990, but also sketches the beliefs and lifestyle of a complex and liberal family within the conservative social and cultural norms of the time. It is a glimpse into a boyhood consumed by extraordinary circumstances. This is ultimately a memoir of a grand transformation...|$|E
50|$|In the United States, some <b>pigeon</b> <b>keepers</b> {{illegally}} {{trap and}} kill hawks and falcons {{to protect their}} pigeons. In American pigeon-related organizations, some enthusiasts have openly shared their experiences of killing hawks and falcons, although this is frowned upon {{by the majority of}} fanciers. None of the major clubs condone this practice. It is estimated that almost 1,000 birds of prey have been killed in Oregon and Washington, and that 1,000-2,000 are killed in southern California annually. In June 2007, three Oregon men were indicted with misdemeanour violations of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act for killing birds of prey. Seven Californians and a Texan were also charged in the case.|$|R

The artist Zina Saunders has painted portraits of New York <b>pigeon</b> <b>keepers</b> {{as part of}} her Overlooked New York project.Photographer Zak Waters shot a black and white project documenting the lives of pigeon fanciers in the UK called Birdmen. Sydney-based {{photographer}} Ho Hai Tran recently debuted his work On Pigeons which chronicled more than a year spent with the Pigeon Fanciers Society of New South Wales in Australia. The work was also exhibited in early 2013 in a show entitled Fancy which showcased portraits {{of some of the most}} notable fancy breeds including the Pouter, Jacobin, King and Dragoon.|$|R
2500|$|Pigeons, {{unlike other}} poultry, form pair bonds to breed, and squabs must be brooded and fed by both parents {{until they are}} four weeks old; a pair of pigeons may produce 15 squabs per year. Ten pairs can produce eight squabs each month without being fed by their <b>keepers.</b> <b>Pigeons</b> which are {{accustomed}} to their dovecote may forage and return there to rest and breed. Industrially raised pigeons have young which weigh [...] when of age, as opposed to traditionally raised pigeons, which weigh [...]|$|R
50|$|The {{station was}} first {{established}} on 19 February 1872, a wooden pole structure of approximately 30 ft, holding a fixed kerosene wick burner which shone a fixed white light with an intensity of 1,000 cd. It was describe by {{a daughter of}} William Arnold, the first lighthouse keeper, as being shaped like a large meat safe, mounted on a wooden structure resembling a <b>pigeon</b> loft. The <b>keeper</b> had to row from the Tweed Heads Pilot Station each day and light the lantern at sunset, and a hut was constructed for him to stay in.|$|R
