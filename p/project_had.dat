5|$|Although the VB-13 <b>project</b> <b>had</b> {{not reached}} the testing stage {{by the end}} of World War II, it avoided being cancelled, {{proceeding}} as a low-priority project. Limited testing was conducted during 1948 and 1949; additional testing at Alamogordo, New Mexico in 1950 led to the Tarzon being approved for operational service in the Korean War.|$|E
5|$|An early plan {{conceived}} by British Rail {{in the early}} 1970s for a route passing through Tonbridge met considerable opposition on environmental and social grounds, especially from the Leigh Action Group and Surrey & Kent Action on Rail (SKAR). A committee {{was set up to}} examine the proposal under Sir Alexander Cairncross; but in due course environment minister Anthony Crosland announced that the <b>project</b> <b>had</b> been cancelled, together with the plan for the tunnel itself.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{years of}} heavy promotion, the Deseret {{alphabet}} was never widely adopted. This reluctance was {{partly due to}} prohibitive costs; the <b>project</b> <b>had</b> already cost the early church $20,000, with $6,000 going to Pratt as remuneration for his transcription effort {{and most of the}} rest going to cutting metal type featuring the new alphabet and printing costs. In 1859, Parley P. Pratt estimated that the cost of supplying all Utah Territory schoolchildren with suitable textbooks would cost over US$5,000,000.|$|E

5|$|Financing of the renovations {{came from}} local bonds, with {{approximately}} $3million per year {{coming from the}} general fund to pay the debt off.

The project was named as the top public project and was an honorable mention in the renovation category for 1998 by Northwest Construction magazine.|$|E
5|$|However, the <b>project</b> <b>had</b> {{neither a}} budget nor a script. On the former issue, Universal head Lew Wasserman thought the film {{could be made}} for $12 million; the filmmakers wanted $20 million. It would be {{impossible}} to settle on a specific amount without a screenplay to review, and after Mitch Glazer declined to help him, Aykroyd wrote one on his own.|$|E

5|$|In 1949, Hamilton hired Gordon Landsborough as an editor.

He also was joined at Hamilton by H.J. Campbell, who was hired as a technical editor. Campbell was a London science fiction fan; he had been brought on by Hulton Press (publisher of the very successful comic the Eagle) to create a science fiction magazine, but the <b>project</b> <b>had</b> been abandoned before seeing print.|$|E

5|$|Once the Space Telescope <b>project</b> <b>had</b> {{been given}} the go-ahead, work on the program was divided among many institutions. Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) was given {{responsibility}} for the design, development, and construction of the telescope, while Goddard Space Flight Center was given overall control of the scientific instruments and ground-control center for the mission. MSFC commissioned the optics company Perkin-Elmer to design and build the Optical Telescope Assembly (OTA) and Fine Guidance Sensors for the space telescope.

5|$|The Amateur Radio on the International Space Station <b>project</b> <b>had</b> {{the crew}} of the station to make brief windows to radio contact with schools and clubs on the ground. The first school to be {{contacted}} by the ISS was Luther Burbank School in southwest Chicago. The contact had been planned for 19 December 2000, but due to technical problems, it was delayed to 21 December 2000. Due to the speed of the space station, the window of radio contact only lasted for 5–10 minutes, which was usually enough for 10 to 20 questions.|$|E
