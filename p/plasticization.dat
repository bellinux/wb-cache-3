50|$|The {{mechanism}} by which phthalates and other molecules afford <b>plasticization</b> to polar polymers has been a subject of intense study since the 1960s. The mechanism is one of polar interactions between the polar centres of the phthalate molecule (the C=O functionality) and the positively charged areas of the vinyl chain, typically residing on the carbon atom of the carbon-chlorine bond. For this to be established, the polymer must be heated {{in the presence of}} the plasticizer, first above the Tg of the polymer and then into a melt state. This enables an intimate mix of polymer and plasticizer to be formed, and for these interactions to occur. When cooled, these interactions remain and the network of PVC chains cannot reform (as is present in unplasticized PVC, or PVC-U). The alkyl chains of the phthalate then screen the PVC chains from each other as well.|$|E

40|$|Penetrant-induced <b>plasticization</b> of gas {{separation}} membranes {{has been}} the subject of a number of recent investigations. The <b>plasticization</b> of the polymer matrix by penetrant gases can be attributed to the swelling stresses on the polymer network. It is well known that sorption of carbon dioxide in glassy polymers can facilitate the local segmental organization with a reduction in the permselectivity and substantially affect membrane morphological performance. Hence, <b>plasticization</b> is a phenomenon that most frequently encountered in polymerâ€“gas systems for commercial CO 2 /CH 4 separation applications where the membranes are exposed to high CO 2 concentration in the feed stream. This paper attempts to present an overview of the <b>plasticization</b> phenomenon and the alteration of physical properties resulting from the polymer <b>plasticization</b> by the sorbed penetrant molecules.

40|$|<b>Plasticization</b> is a {{phenomenon}} frequently encountered {{in the application of}} glassy polymeric materials for solution-diffusion membranes. Conventional methods for stabilizing the membrane are either annealing or cross-linking, which hardly influence the selectivity of the membrane, but decrease the permeability.

Most permeation experiments are carried out with pure CO 2, but {{little is known about the}} transport properties determined from mixed gas experiments. Stabilization of <b>plasticization</b> in mixed-gas experiments for polymer blends of the polyimide Matrimid and polysulfone is reported, as well as transport properties of a new homogeneous polymer blend based on Matrimid and the copolyimide P 84.

40|$|A typical {{effect of}} <b>plasticization</b> of glassy {{polymers}} in gas permeation is a minimum {{in the relationship}} between the permeability and the feed pressure. The pressure corresponding to the minimum is called the <b>plasticization</b> pressure. <b>Plasticization</b> phenomena significantly effect the membrane performance in, for example, CO 2 /CH 4 separation processes. The polymer swells upon sorption of CO 2 accelerating the permeation of CH 4. As a consequence, the polymer membrane loses its selectivity. Fundamental understanding of the phenomenon is necessary to develop new concepts to prevent it. In this paper, CO 2 -induced <b>plasticization</b> phenomena in 11 different glassy polymers are investigated by single gas permeation and sorption experiments. The main objective was to search for relationships between the <b>plasticization</b> pressure and the chemical structure or the physical properties of the polymer. No relationships were found with respect to the glass-transition temperature or fractional free volume. Furthermore, it was thought that polar groups of the polymer increase the tendency of a polymer to be plasticized because they may have dipolar interactions with the polarizable carbon dioxide molecules. But, no dependence of the <b>plasticization</b> pressure on the carbonyl or sulfone density of the polymers considered was observed. Instead, {{it was found that the}} polymers studied plasticized at the same critical CO 2 concentration of 36 ± 7 cm 3 (STP) /cm 3 polymer.

40|$|The {{degree of}} <b>plasticization</b> of the alloscutal cuticle of a 'hard' (ixodid) tick, Amblyomma hebraeum, and a 'soft' (argasid) tick, Ornithodoros moubata, was {{assessed}} throughout the blood-feeding period. Cuticle viscosity was calculated from rate of creep of cuticle under constant load using a Maxwell model. Feeding-related <b>plasticization</b> (i. e. increased rate of extension under a constant load) occurred in A. hebraeum {{but not in}} O. moubata. Maxwell viscosity of unfed A. hebraeum cuticle was relatively high (similar to 720. GPa. s) but was significantly lower in feeding ticks. Small partially fed ticks displayed a viscosity of similar to 108 GPa. s. Still lower values (42 GPa. s) were observed in {{the largest of the}} engorged ticks. Following cessation of feeding, there was a significant but limited reversal in viscosity back to similar to 100. GPas. The water content of cuticle of unfed A. hebraeum (23. 4 % of wet mass) rose sharply after the onset of feeding and reached a plateau value of 34. 0 % at a fed/unfed weight ratio of 3 and beyond. Ixodid ticks lay down new endocuticle during the feeding period. The observed increase in cuticle hydration suggests that both old and new cuticles are hydrated during feeding. Monoamines may {{play an important role in}} controlling cuticle viscosity. Dopamine (DA) injected into partially fed A. hebraeum caused <b>plasticization.</b> 5 -Hydroxytryptamine (serotonin, 5 -HT), which induces <b>plasticization</b> in the blood-sucking insect Rhodnius prolixus, had no statistically significant effect on tick cuticle. Octopamine (OA) and tyramine both caused cuticle stiffening (i. e. opposed <b>plasticization).</b> This suggests a possible inhibitory effect but co-injection of OA with DA did not reduce DA-induced <b>plasticization.</b> The mechanism leading to <b>plasticization</b> of tick cuticle may involve a change in cuticular pH. The viscosity of tick cuticle loops was highest at pH. 8. 0 (389 GPa. s) and fell precipitously in the acidic range to a low value of 2. 2. GPa. s at pH 5. 5 - 5. 7. A cuticular pH of similar to 6. 5 would account for the lowest viscosity observed under physiological conditions (42. 4 GPa. s for large, day 0, engorged ticks). The V-ATPase inhibitor, concanamycin A, was a potent inhibitor of DA-induced <b>plasticization.</b> These results are consistent with a model in which DA acts to cause <b>plasticization</b> through transport of H+ ions into the cuticle. Measurement of cuticular ion (Na+, K+, Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +) content did not suggest that <b>plasticization</b> is caused by any of these ions. Taken together, our results suggest that the mechanism of cuticular <b>plasticization</b> in feeding A. hebraeum is related to hydration, and involves the transport of H+ ions into the sub-cuticular space by cells in the hypodermis.

40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{the influence of}} a varying feed composition of CO 2 /CH 4 and CO 2 /N 2 mixtures on the gas separation performance of integrally skinned asymmetric PES/PI hollow fibers with an effective skin thickness of 0. 27 ¿m. Normally, thin membrane structures (< 3 ¿m) show accelerated <b>plasticization</b> behavior induced by CO 2 in pure gas measurements. This study shows that introducing an inert gas to the CO 2 feed mixture apparently suppresses <b>plasticization.</b> This effect is more pronounced at higher concentrations of inert gas, supported by a continuous drop in CO 2 permeance as a function of CO 2 fugacity. At a concentration of 80 % inert gas in the feed mixture, the CO 2 permeance reduces more than 35 % from its initial value, whereas the reduction is 8 ¿ 10 % with 2 % inert gas in the feed mixture. However, a mixed gas permeation model predicts for all experimentally used gas compositions similar decreases in CO 2 permeance. <b>Plasticization</b> effects seem to be counterbalanced by competitive sorption.

Combination of polymer blending and MMM approach {{could lead to}} <b>plasticization</b> resistant membranes with improved membrane performance. In this work, the gas separation performance of Matrimid® and PSF blend membranes containing ZIF- 8 nanoparticles, were studied. The effect of ZIF- 8 loading on the gas transport and <b>plasticization</b> behavior of the blend-MOF MMMs was investigated. Gas permeability measurements of PI/PSF-ZIF- 8 MMMs showed significant improvements in permeability of both CO 2 and CH 4, compared to pure reference polymer membrane. At a high loading of 30 wt% ZIF- 8, MMM showed an enhancement of 136 % in CO 2 permeability compared to the pure PI/PSF membrane, while the selectivity stayed constant. This increase in the permeability {{could be related to}} the moderate increase in sorption capacity and faster diffusion of gases through the ZIF- 8 nanoparticles. More detailed analysis of the gas transport performance of the MMMs showed that the CO 2 permeability and the CO 2 /CH 4 selectivity were mainly governed by the increase in CO 2 diffusion coefficient. Blend MMMs were considerably more resistant to <b>plasticization</b> phenomenon compared to the pure PI membrane. For pure gases, native PI/PSF blend membrane showed a <b>plasticization</b> pressure of ∼ 18 bar, which increased to ∼ 25 bar up to 30 wt% ZIF- 8 loading. Short and long CO 2 exposure time experiments, with different upstream pressures, showed that the permeability stayed constant in time at pressures below the <b>plasticization</b> pressure while a noticeable increase in permeability was recorded in time at higher pressures. Additionally, these experiments showed that the extent of dilation in the pure PI/PSF membrane was much higher compared to the PI/PSF-ZIF- 8 MMMs. In mixed gas (50 / 50 mol% CO 2 /CH 4) experiments, the pure PI/PSF membrane and the MMMs did not show <b>plasticization</b> over the pressure range investigated, as confirmed by a constant mixed gas CH 4 permeability and nearly constant selectivity with pressure.

The stability of the modified membrane is tested with permeation experiments with pure CO 2 as well as CO 2 /CH 4 gas mixtures. The original membrane shows a minimum in its permeability vs. pressure curves, but the modified membranes do not indicating suppressed <b>plasticization.</b> Membrane performances for CO 2 /CH 4 gas mixtures showed that the plasticizing effect indeed accelerates the permeation of methane. The modified membrane clearly shows suppression of the undesired methane acceleration. It was also found that just blending Matrimid and Thermid was not sufficient to suppress <b>plasticization.</b> The subsequent heat treatment that results in the s-ipn was necessary to obtain a stabilized permeability...|$|E
40|$|External <b>plasticization</b> is {{a widely}} applied {{technique}} to improve PLA processability and toughness. Keys to successful <b>plasticization</b> of PLA are the miscibility of the plasticizer and its permanence in the polymer structure to ensure long-term stability of the material. To provide rules for successful plasticizing of PLA, a brief reminder of physicochemical mechanisms behind <b>plasticization</b> is given and the main theories allowing for the calculation of solubility parameters are summarized. To make use of this approach, a number of solubility parameters were gathered for potential PLA plasticizers. This chapter provides furthermore a comprehensive overview of literature results on glass transition temperatures and mechanical properties obtained for PLA and PLA nanocomposites mixed with monomeric and polymeric plasticizers. Additionally, physical and chemical long-term stability of plasticized materials is detailed. Finally, novel strategies of compounding PLA with additives derived from by-products of agriculture and food industries are discussed...|$|E
30|$|The {{mechanical}} {{performance of}} composite material {{is influenced by}} the hygrothermal effect. High temperature and absorbed moisture cause expansion and <b>plasticization</b> of the matrix and degradation of the fiber/matrix interfaces, which change residual stresses, elastic moduli and the critical stresses for damage such as transverse cracking and delamination [147]. The possible causes for the reduction in strength are the adverse effect of a higher degree of thermal stress at the higher temperature, matrix <b>plasticization</b> due to moisture and temperature, swelling and induced internal stresses, cracking/crazing due to both osmosis [163 – 168].|$|E
40|$|The {{time-dependent}} permeation {{behavior of}} a glassy polyimide is studied {{above and below the}} <b>plasticization</b> pressure with carbon dioxide as the permeating gas. The work particularly focuses on the quantification of the slow increase in permeability at feed pressures above the <b>plasticization</b> pressure. Significant differences in permeation behavior were found for membranes with and without permeation history. Introducing the quantity conditioning time allows one to compare the results obtained for membranes with different permeation history. The concept of conditioning time furthermore allows one to quantify the aging of a membrane plasticized during previous permeation...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe thermal and {{mechanical}} properties of cassava starch films are analyzed {{in relation to}} the starch–kaolinite interactions. The kaolinite filler induces a lowering of the crystallinity in accordance with an increase <b>plasticization</b> of the starch matrix. The increase of <b>plasticization</b> induces a decrease of the elastic modulus and an increase of the elongation at break. A retardant effect to the starch matrix decomposition is observed. The filler–matrix interface at which the plasticizer infiltration is enhanced and the reduction of starch chain–chain interactions appears as keys of the observed properties changes...|$|E
40|$|Thermoplastic starch (TPS) was {{obtained}} from natural and acetylated cassava starch using a twin screw extruder and then conditioned at 25 ºC and 54 % of relative humidity. It {{was found that the}} crystallinity index, calculated as the ratio of the IR peaks at 1047 (crystalline phase) and 1022 cm¯¹ (amorphous phase), decreases due to the effect of a <b>plasticization</b> process. Also, as expected, SEM micrographs show that the <b>plasticization</b> process destroyed the starch granular structure almost completely and an amorphous mass {{was obtained}}. The TGA results indicated that the activation energy, Ea, was also reduced by the <b>plasticization</b> process. The acetylated TPS shows a decrease in Tg, in tensile strength and in the percentage of moisture absorption compared to natural TPS but a larger strain at the breaking point. This behavior suggests that the chemical modification reduces the secondary interactions between starch chains due to the substitution of the hydroxyl groups by acetates...|$|E
