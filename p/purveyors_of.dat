5|$|Experimental {{pop music}} {{developed}} concurrently with experimental jazz {{as a new}} kind of avant-garde, with many younger musicians embracing the practice of making studio recordings along the fringes of popular music. In the early 1960s, it was common for producers, songwriters, and engineers to freely experiment with musical form, orchestration, unnatural reverb, and other sound effects, and by the late 1960s, highly experimental pop music, or sounds that expanded the idea of the typical popular song, was positively received by young audiences. Throughout the ensuing decades, some <b>purveyors</b> <b>of</b> the style shared a literary-experimental tradition that balanced experimentation with populist cohesion.|$|E

25|$|Seeing a {{decrease}} in their exports to Spanish America caused by {{the growing popularity of}} aguardiente de cana, a brandy made locally from sugar cane, the large Spanish <b>purveyors</b> <b>of</b> spirits complained to the crown, and sought royal protection for their interests. In 1748, a royal cedula (decree) was issued instructing provincial governors to prohibit the production and consumption of aguardiente. The same year Benavides came into conflict with the council of Campeche over his use of Indian labor to work in rice paddies, and for the cutting of logwood trees (from the heartwood of which a valuable fabric dye was extracted) and other timber trees. Antonio Benavides' term in Yucatan ended in 1750 when he was appointed governor of Manila in the Philippines in September of that year.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} {{viticulture}} in Tuscany {{dates back to}} its settlements by the Etruscans in the 8th century BC. Amphora remnants originating in the region show that Tuscan wine was exported to southern Italy and Gaul {{as early as the}} 7th century BC. By the 3rd century BC, there were literary references by Greek writers about the quality of Tuscan wine. From the fall of the Roman Empire and throughout the Middle Ages, monasteries were the main <b>purveyors</b> <b>of</b> wines in the region. As the aristocratic and merchant classes emerged, they inherited the sharecropping system of agriculture known as mezzadria. This system took its name from the arrangement whereby the landowner provides the land and resources for planting in exchange for half ("mezza") of the yearly crop. Many Tuscan landowners would turn their half of the grape harvest into wine that would be sold to merchants in Florence. The earliest reference of Florentine wine retailers dates to 1079 and a guild was created in 1282.|$|E

500|$|Art pop {{emphasizes}} {{the manipulation of}} signs over personal expression, drawing on an aesthetic of the everyday and the disposable, in distinction to the Romantic and autonomous tradition embodied by art rock (also known as progressive rock). Sociomusicologist Simon Frith has distinguished the appropriation of art into pop music as having a particular concern with style, gesture, and the ironic use of historical eras and genres. Drawing on postmodernism's breakdown of the high/low cultural boundary, Frith says that art pop artists trouble issues of sociological interpretation and historical authenticity, instead exploring concepts of artifice. Central to particular <b>purveyors</b> <b>of</b> the style were notions of the self {{as a work of}} construction and artifice, as well as a preoccupation with the invention of terms, imagery, process, and affect. Cultural theorist Mark Fisher wrote that the development of art pop evolved out of the triangulation of pop, art, and fashion. Frith states that it was [...] "more or less" [...] directly inspired by Pop art.|$|E

[...] Chan is representative of a model minority, the good stereotype that counters a bad stereotype: [...] "Each stereotypical image is filled with contradictions: the bloodthirsty Indian is tempered with the image of the noble savage; the bandido exists along with the loyal sidekick; and Fu Manchu is offset by Charlie Chan."

500|$|There {{were two}} groups of guilds – first, those that {{supplied}} the raw materials; butchers, fishmongers, grain merchants, and gardeners. The second group were those that supplied prepared foods; bakers, pastry cooks, sauce makers, poulterers, and caterers. There were also guilds that offered both raw materials and prepared food, such as the charcutiers and rôtisseurs (<b>purveyors</b> <b>of</b> roasted meat dishes). They would supply cooked meat pies and dishes as well as raw meat and poultry. This caused issues with butchers and poulterers, who sold the same raw materials. [...] The guilds served as a training ground for those within the industry. The degrees of assistant-cook, full-fledged cook and master chef were conferred. Those who reached the level of master chef were of considerable rank in their individual industry, and enjoyed {{a high level of}} income as well as economic and job security. At times, those in the royal kitchens did fall under the guild hierarchy, but it was necessary to find them a parallel appointment based on their skills after leaving the service of the royal kitchens. This was not uncommon as the Paris cooks' guild regulations allowed for this movement.|$|E
500|$|During the Middle Ages, {{sexuality}} and lust were seen, by some, {{as evidence of}} humanity's fall from grace, and the most foul of the seven deadly sins. In {{the eyes of some}} viewers, this sin is depicted in the left-hand panel through Adam's, allegedly lustful, gaze towards Eve, and it has been proposed that the center panel was created as a warning to the viewer to avoid a life of sinful pleasure. According to this view, the penalty for such sins is shown in the right panel of the triptych. In the lower right-hand corner, a man is approached by a pig wearing the veil of a nun. The pig is shown trying to seduce the man to sign legal documents. Lust is further said to be symbolised by the gigantic musical instruments and by the choral singers in the left foreground of the panel. Musical instruments often carried erotic connotations in works of art of the period, and lust was referred to in moralising sources as the [...] "music of the flesh". There has also been the view that Bosch's use of music here might be a rebuke against traveling minstrels, often thought of as <b>purveyors</b> <b>of</b> bawdy song and verse.|$|E
