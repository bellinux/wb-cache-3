5000|$|The wooden Sailfish {{began as}} the 11' 7½" [...] (3.5 m) [...] "Standard" [...] model. Shortly after its {{inception}} a larger, 13' 7" [...] (4.2 m) [...] "Super" [...] model was made available. In {{the early years}} the spars were made from Sitka spruce and the sail was silk. Historic photos show sails {{with as many as}} 10 panels and even small battens inserted. Sails in those days were lashed to the spars with line in the traditional manner with a marlin hitch instead of being attached by the plastic sail clips that became another familiar characteristic of this boat in later years. One of Alcort's first innovations for the Sailfish was to create a <b>patented</b> <b>rudder</b> releasing mechanism that automatically released the rudder into a horizontal position for easy beaching. By the late 1950s the option of either a nylon or Dacron polyester sail in solid colors of red or blue became available to complement the previous white only sail.|$|R
