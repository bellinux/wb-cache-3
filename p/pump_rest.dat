40|$|SummaryHalorhodopsin is a light-driven {{chloride}} anion pump {{in which}} the trans→cis photoisomerization of a retinal chromophore triggers a photocyle resulting in the translocation of chloride across the plasma membrane. The mechanism of chloride transfer past the cis retinal is determined here by computing multiple pathways for this process. The calculations reveal two conditions of the valve mechanism. First, a lumen absent in the ground state structure is transiently opened by chloride passage. Second, this activated opening, {{which is achieved by}} flexible deformation of the surrounding protein, is shown to significantly raise the chloride translocation barrier between photocycles, thus preventing chloride backflow. Unlike macroscopic valve designs, the protein allows differential ion flows in the <b>pumping</b> and <b>resting</b> states that are tuned to match the physiological timescales of the cell, thus creating a “kinetic” valve...|$|R

40|$|The {{thermodynamic}} and kinetic properties {{associated with}} intrinsic uncoupling in a six-state {{model of a}} redox proton pump have been studied by computing the flow-force relations for different degrees of coupling. Analysis of these relations shows the regulatory influence of the thermodynamic forces on the extent and relative contributions of redox slip and proton slip. Inhibition has been introduced into the model in two different ways, corresponding to possible modes of action of experimental inhibitors. Experiments relating the rate of electron transfer to delta microH at static head upon progressive inhibition of the pumps have been simulated considering (1) the limiting case that the nonzero rate of electron transfer at static head is only due to intrinsic uncoupling (no leaks) and (2) the experimentally observed case that about 30 % of the nonzero rate of electron transfer at static head {{is due to a}} constant proton leakage conductance in parallel with the <b>pumps,</b> the <b>rest</b> being due to intrinsic uncoupling.

Comparison between simulated behavior and experimental results leads to the general conclusion that the typical relationship between rate of electron transfer and delta microH found in mitochondria at static head could certainly be a manifestation of some degree of intrinsic uncoupling in the redox proton pumps.

The contribution of edge damage to ionic permeability was eliminated, resulting in relatively high spontaneous ψ (- 97 ± 4 mv) and low electrical conductance g. Bidirectional Na fluxes were measured simultaneously. Unidirectional Cl fluxes were measured in paired hemibladders at ψ = 0 mv or - 97 mv. Net Na flux JNa, at ψ = 0 mv, was slightly less than short-circuit current (SCC). At ψ = - 97 mv, JNa averaged 17 % of SCC, and was sometimes zero. ΔJNa/Δψ (= g+) averaged 60 % of g between - 97 mv and + 75 mv; at - 150 mv, g+ fell, indicating rectification. Analysis of unidirectional Na fluxes indicates low passive conductance (1. 5 μmho/mg wet weight), a bidirectional, electrically neutral flux of approximately 0. 13 μa/mg, and relatively large conductance of the active transport path at ψ ≥ - 97 mv. The absence of appreciable transstimulation of serosal (S) -to-mucosal (M) Na flux (in response to increasing mucosal Na concentration) indicates that the electrically neutral flux is not exchange diffusion in the usual sense. Analysis of Cl fluxes indicates similar values for passive conductance and neutral flux, suggesting linked neutral flux of Na and Cl.

5000|$|While {{the pump}} {{performance}} {{is much better}} than the European designed family pumps that were installed prior to this new design, the India Mark II has several flaws. Many versions of the pump use cast iron riser mains (the pipe that carries water {{from the bottom of the}} borehole to the surface). These pipes rust quickly (sometimes in just 2 years), and either leak water or separate completely from the pump rendering it useless. The pump requires routine maintenance and will fall into disrepair if certain procedures are not followed. A <b>pump</b> cylinder <b>rests</b> at the bottom of the borehole and may needs to be replaced every two years. To remove the cylinder, the riser main also needs to be lifted from the borehole. As one can imagine, lifting up to 100 ft of iron pipe and cylinder from a well is no easy task and requires special tools, a tripod stand, the replacement parts, and most importantly, the know-how to do it. In many developing countries and remote villages, these requirements cannot be met and the pumps often remain broken. Some estimates put the number of broken pumps at 150,000. [...] Longer lasting materials can be retrofitted to the India Mark II. PVC riser mains are less expensive and can last longer. PVC is much lighter, easier to work with and significantly reduce the cost of ownership of the well. PVC has had its own set of issues. In deeper wells, the pumping action can flex the PVC and cause cracking. The connecting rods can also wear through the PVC if the rods are not centred in the riser main. Riser main stabilizer and connecting rod centralizers can be used to prvent this type of wear. Ministry of water officials have pushed back on the using of PVC citing the materials have not been tested thoroughly, though several countries have been using PVC successfully for years. Government corruption may be at the root of the decision. Iron replacement pipes are often paid for by the NGO. The sellers of the pipes are often the ministry members themselves, family or close friends.|$|R
50|$|Many {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that differences in the expression of threshold channels could account for the sensory-motor differences in strength-duration time constant. The differences in strength-duration time constant and rheobase of normal sensory and motor axons are thought to reflect differences in expression of a persistent Na+ conductance. Additionally, sensory axons accommodate more to long-lasting hyperpolarizing currents than do motor axons, suggesting a greater expression of the hyperpolarization-activated inward rectifier channels. Finally, the electrogenic Na+/K+-ATPase is more active in sensory nerves, which have a greater dependence on this <b>pump</b> to maintain <b>resting</b> membrane potential than do motor nerves. Increases in the strength-duration time constant are observed when this conductance is activated by depolarization, or by hyperventilation. However, demyelination, which exposes internodal membrane with a higher membrane time constant than that of the original node, can also increase strength-duration time constant. The strength-duration time constant of both cutaneous and motor afferents decreases with age, and this corresponds to an increase in rheobase. Two possible reasons for this age-related decrease in the strength-duration time constant have been proposed. First, nerve geometry might change with age because of axonal loss and neural fibrosis. Secondly, the persistent Na+ conductance might decrease maturation. Significant decreases in threshold for sensory and motor fibers have been observed during ischemia. These decreases in threshold were furthermore associated with significant increases in the strength-duration time constant, appreciably indicating a significant decrease in rheobase current. These changes are thought {{to be the result of}} non-inactivating, voltage-dependent Na+ channels, which are active at resting potential.|$|R

Gazella spekei and G. gazella showed higher RMR values than expected, while the RMR of N. soemmerringii was in the range of expected values. Our results indicate that not all mammals adapted to aridity have lower metabolic rates under conditions of unlimited resources and that in these cases other physiological adaptations might be of higher importance. Further extensions of the datasets could allow explaining which deviations of metabolic rate from the body mass regressions result from convergent adaptations. © 2015 Deutsche Gesellschaft für Säugetierkunde.
