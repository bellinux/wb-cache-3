The U spectra indicate (1) that the O atoms are incorporated as oxo groups at short (1. 75 A) U O distances consistent with U(VI) concomitant {{with a large}} range of U displacements that reduce the apparent number of U neighbors and (2) that the UO 2 fraction remains intact implying that these O defects interact to form clusters and give the heterogeneous structure consistent with the diffraction patterns. The PuO 2 +x system, which does not show a separate phase at its x 1 : 4 0 : 25 endpoint, also displays (1) oxo groups at longer 1. 9 A distances consistent with Pu(V+d), (2) a multisite Pu O distribution even when x is close to zero indicative {{of the formation of}} stable species with H 2 O and its hydrolysis products with O 2, and (3) a highly disordered, spectroscopically invisible Pu <b>Pu</b> <b>component.</b> The {{structure and}} bonding in AnO 2 +x are therefore more complicated than have previously been assumed and show both similarities but also distinct differences among the different elements.

40|$|Many {{articles}} of daily use {{are made of}} or contain polyurethane (PU), for instance clothes, mattresses, furniture filling, insulation materials or automotive interiors. Polyurethanes (PUs), as most synthetic materials can emit volatile organic compounds (VOC), some {{of which could be}} unpleasant odorous and may reduce the consumer acceptance or cause consumer anxiety. Therefore, the aim of the PU-industries was the development of low emission and low odor PU products. The prerequisite in order to do this was to reveal the odorant sources and to understand their formation pathways during manufacturing. In contrast to other plastics, PUs are not commercially available as pellets/granulate or semi finished products for subsequent processing. PUs are produced in situ in the PUfactory by the exothermal polyaddition reaction of a polyol and an isocyanate component in presence of catalysts and additives like blowing agents, cross linkers, surfactants, flame retardants, pigments or fillers in order to achieve specific end product properties. Therefore, PU properties and corresponding material emissions are influenced by both the main <b>PU</b> <b>components</b> (polyol and isocyante), additives and catalysts as well as by production conditions like the reaction temperature. In order to reveal the causes for odor formation during the PU manufacturing process, the raw materials and additives of a conspicuous odorous PU product were sensorially evaluated. The odor evaluation showed that exclusively low odor raw materials and additives were used...|$|R
40|$|Nuclear {{disarmament}} is {{a highly}} debated subject. Proponents argue that political conditions for nuclear disarmament are ripe. Opponents reason that dismantlement could create instability leading to a higher probability of nuclear war or large-scale conventional war. Verification of disarmament can help alleviate instabilities and as nuclear arsenals decrease, verifying actual warheads and not just delivery vehicles will become more important. Current techniques {{that could be used}} in warhead verification have the ability to reveal sensitive information about the warhead and thus require an information barrier. This research developed a proof-of-principle concept for a new technique to address the need of nuclear warhead verification for arms control treaties. Specifically, this technique uses fluorescence imaging to determine fissile material attributes in verifying, during the dismantlement process, an uncanned nuclear warhead or warhead component without revealing sensitive information. This could potentially reduce the need for an information barrier. Experiments were performed using a Princeton Instruments PIXIS: 1024 B/BUV back-illuminated CCD camera to image the fluorescence produced by the decay of nuclear material. The Monte Carlo simulation tool GEANT 4 was used to model the experimental setups and to compare with the experimental results. The results verified the proof-of-concept of fluorescence imaging for use in nuclear arms control treaty verification. Fluorescence imaging would be most beneficial for assessing the fissile material attributes of U enrichment (greater than a threshold) and symmetry. It also contributes valuable data for verifying the presence of fissile material, presence of Pu, presence of U, mass greater than a threshold, Pu age, and 239 Pu to 240 Pu ratio greater than a threshold. Fluorescence imaging may also be beneficial to the ?absence of oxide? attribute, but additional experiments are needed to confirm this assumption. Additionally, it was concluded that the only potential for revealing presumably sensitive information is the ability to provide too much image detail on external surfaces of <b>Pu</b> <b>components.</b> However, simple steps could be taken to prevent the imaging system from acquiring too much detail and thus eliminate the need for an information barrier...|$|R

40|$|Ac {{dielectric}} relaxation measurements, thermally stimulated depolarization currents (TSDC) measurements, and {{differential scanning calorimetry}} (DSC) measurements, {{were employed}} to investigate the dielectric properties {{in relation to the}} microphase separation in blends of an anion containing polyurethane (PU 1) and polyaminourethane (PU 2). The temperature at which alpha- and Maxwell-Wagner-Sillars relaxation appear in the TSDC plots and the magnitude of these relaxations are strongly affected by the degree of microphase separation (DMS) of the ionomer blends. The results, of the various techniques, were compared to each other with respect to their characteristic, and indicate that the DMS decreases on addition of the pure <b>component</b> <b>PU</b> 2 to the blends. Analysis of the alpha-relaxation, in terms of fragility, indicates that the systems under investigation are fragile. Results indicate a correlation between fragility and DMS.

40|$|Both viral and {{cellular}} genes have been directly implicated in pathogenesis of Friend viral erythroleukemia. The virus-encoded gp 55 glycoprotein binds to erythropoietin receptors to cause mitogenesis and differentiation of erythroblasts. However, if the provirus integrates {{adjacent to the}} gene for the PU. 1 transcription factor, the cell loses its commitment to terminally differentiate and becomes immortal, as indicated by its transplantability and by its potential for indefinite growth in culture (C. Spiro, B. Gliniak, and D. Kabat, J. Virol. 63 : 4434 - 4437, 1989; R. Paul, S. Schuetze, S. L. Kozak, and D. Kabat, J. Virol. 65 : 464 - 467, 1991). To test {{the implications of these}} results, we produced polyclonal antiserum to bacterially synthesized PU. 1, and we used it to analyze PU. 1 expression throughout leukemic progression and during chemically induced differentiation of Friend erythroleukemia (F-MEL) cell lines. This antiserum identified three electrophoretically distinct <b>PU.</b> 1 <b>components</b> in extracts of F-MEL cells and demonstrated their nuclear localization. Although PU. 1 proteins are abundant in F-MEL cells, they are absent or present in only trace amounts in normal erythroblasts or in differentiating erythroblasts from the preleukemic stage of Friend disease. Furthermore, chemicals (dimethyl sulfoxide or N,N'-hexamethylenebisacetamide) that overcome the blocked differentiation of F-MEL cells induce rapid declines of PU. 1 mRNA and PU. 1 proteins. The elimination of PU. 1 proteins coincides with recommitment to the program of erythroid differentiation and with loss of immortality. These results support the hypothesis that PU. 1 interferes with the commitment of erythroblasts to differentiate and that chemicals that reduce PU. 1 expression reinstate the erythropoietic program...|$|R
40|$|The {{possibility}} of polypropylene (PP) modification by regenerated polyurethane (PU), obtained after partial thermochemical decomposition of waste PU, has been studied. The degradation product was a thermoplastic mixture, applicable for reuse without any purification and fractionation. It was proved that regenerated PU could be reused {{as an effective}} polymeric plasticizer for PP and that the addition of regenerated PU did not decrease the thermal stability of PP. In order to improve further the elongation at break of PP modified by regenerated <b>PU,</b> a third <b>component</b> {{was added to the}} PP/(regenerated PU) blend. The influence of the third component on the mechanical properties and thermal stability of the blends was evaluated by using a universal testing machine (UTM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The data showed that the elongations of PP/ (regenerated PU) blends with styrene-ethylene-butylene-styrene polymer (SEBS) were obviously better than those of the PP/(regenerated PU) blend without the third component and with PP-g-MA or SEBS-g-MA (MA = maleic anhydride). In addition, the thermal stability of PP/(regenerated PU) blends with a third component was almost same as that of the PP/(regenerated PU) blend without a third component...|$|R
40|$|The high-af®nity {{receptor}} for IgG (FcgRI) is a myeloid cell-speci®c and IFN-g-induced gene, {{and thereby}} {{serves as a}} paradigm for cytokine-induced cell type-speci®c gene responses. The expression of FcgRI is regulated by PU. 1 and Stat 1 transcription factors. We established an experimental model to analyze the individual functions of Stat 1 and PU. 1 in cytokine-induced transcription of the natural FcgRI promoter in U 3 A cells lacking both factors. PU. 1 was required for both the basal activity and for the IFN-g-induced FcgRI promoter activation, while Stat 1 alone could not initiate transcription. In contrast, {{in the context of}} a heterologous promoter, PU. 1 inhibited the Stat 1 -mediated transcription. Systematic analysis of Stat 1 and PU. 1 mutants and FcgRI promoter elements revealed that activation of the promoter required the DNA binding, and the transactivation functions of both Stat 1 and PU. 1. PU. 1 and Stat 1 bound the promoter elements independently, and no physical interaction between the proteins was observed. The requirement of PU. 1 for FcgRI promoter activity was supported by demonstration of in vitro interaction between <b>PU.</b> 1 and <b>components</b> of the basal transcription machinery TBP and RNA polymerase II.

40|$|The Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF) will {{transition}} from Sludge Batch 5 (SB 5) processing to Sludge Batch 6 (SB 6) processing in late fiscal year 2010. Tests were conducted using non-radioactive simulants {{of the expected}} SB 6 composition to determine the impact of varying the acid stoichiometry during the Sludge Receipt and Adjustment Tank (SRAT) and Slurry Mix Evaporator (SME) processes. The work was conducted to meet the Technical Task Request (TTR) HLW/DWPF/TTR- 2008 - 0043, Rev. 0 and followed the guidelines of a Task Technical and Quality Assurance Plan (TT&QAP). The flowsheet studies {{are performed to evaluate}} the potential chemical processing issues, hydrogen generation rates, and process slurry rheological properties as a function of acid stoichiometry. These studies were conducted with the estimated SB 6 composition {{at the time of the}} study. This composition assumed a blend of 101, 085 kg of Tank 4 insoluble solids and 179, 000 kg of Tank 12 insoluble solids. The current plans are to subject Tank 12 sludge to aluminum dissolution. Liquid Waste Operations assumed that 75 % of the aluminum would be dissolved during this process. After dissolution and blending of Tank 4 sludge slurry, plans included washing the contents of Tank 51 to {approx} 1 M Na. After the completion of washing, the plan assumes that 40 inches on Tank 40 slurry would remain for blending with the qualified SB 6 material. There are several parameters that are noteworthy concerning SB 6 sludge: (1) This is the second batch DWPF will be processing that contains sludge that has had a significant fraction of aluminum removed through aluminum dissolution; (2) The sludge is high in mercury, but the projected concentration is lower than SB 5; (3) The sludge is high in noble metals, but the projected concentrations are lower than SB 5; and(4) The sludge is high in U and <b>Pu</b> - <b>components</b> that are not added in sludge simulants. Six DWPF process simulations were completed in 4 -L laboratory-scale equipment using two projections of the SB 6 blend simulant composition (Tank 40 simulant after Tank 51 transfer is complete). The more washed simulant (SB 6 -A) had a set of four SRAT and SME simulations at varying acid stoichiometry levels (90 %, 100 %, 120 % and 150 %) using the Koopman Acid Prediction Calculation. Two additional SRAT simulations were made using SB 6 -B blend simulant at 100 % and 120 % of acid stoichiometry. SME cycles were noted performed for the SB 6 B simulants to allow the SRAT products to be used for melt rate testing...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{shows that}} series {{capacitive}} compensation of transmission lines {{by a combination}} of Static Synchronous Series Compensator (SSSC) and dielectric capacitors lowers the cost of series compensation. The SSSC has two functions: (1) to provide some series capacitive reactance compensation; (2) to damp out incipient unstable Subsynchronous Resonance (SSR) modes. Digital simulation using HYPERSIM shows that for an overall capacitive depth of compensation of 0. 7 <b>pu,</b> the SSSC <b>component</b> is only about 1 / 3 of the capacitive Mvar. Based on the transient stability limit, the transmissibility of the line is increased by a factor of 2. 23 for a depth of compensation of 0. 7. A second objective of this thesis is to extend the application of the SSSC concept. This application is found in HVDC, where there is no synchronizing power. In the family of Voltage-Source Converter (VSC) HVDC, it is possible to embed the control of the SSSC in the converter station so that there is enhanced synchronizing power. The effectiveness of the synchronizing power (together with damping power) is demonstrated through digital simulations of a turbine-generator system which is connected to a VSC-HVDC Station. The thesis shows that the SSSC has two modes of operation: (1) the constant reactance mode, in which the SSSC voltage is proportional to the line current, and (2) the constant quadrature voltage mode, in which the SSSC voltage is a constant quadrature voltage independent of the line current. A comparison between the two modes shows that the constant reactance mode provides higher synchronizing power and has a higher transient stability limit. Eigenvalue analysis and digital simulations are the methodologies used...|$|R

40|$|The Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF) will {{transition}} from Sludge Batch 4 (SB 4) processing to Sludge Batch 5 (SB 5) processing in early fiscal year 2009. Tests were conducted using non-radioactive simulants {{of the expected}} SB 5 composition to determine the impact of varying the acid stoichiometry during the Sludge Receipt and Adjustment Tank (SRAT) and Slurry Mix Evaporator (SME) processes. The work was conducted to meet the Technical Task Request (TTR) HLW/DWPF/TTR- 2007 - 0007, Rev. 1 and followed the guidelines of a Task Technical and Quality Assurance Plan (TT&QAP). The flowsheet studies {{are performed to evaluate}} the potential chemical processing issues, hydrogen generation rates, and process slurry rheological properties as a function of acid stoichiometry. Initial SB 5 flowsheet studies were conducted to guide decisions during the sludge batch preparation process. These studies were conducted with the estimated SB 5 composition {{at the time of the}} study. The composition has changed slightly since these studies were completed due to changes in the washing plan to prepare SB 5 and the estimated SB 4 heel mass. Nine DWPF process simulations were completed in 4 -L laboratory-scale equipment using both a batch simulant (Tank 51 simulant after washing is complete) and a blend simulant (Tank 40 simulant after Tank 51 transfer is complete). Each simulant had a set of four SRAT and SME simulations at varying acid stoichiometry levels (115 %, 130 %, 145 % and 160 %). One additional run was made using blend simulant at 130 % acid that included additions of the Actinide Removal Process (ARP) waste prior to acid addition and the Modular Caustic Side Solvent Extraction (CSSX) Unit (MCU) waste following SRAT dewatering. There are several parameters that are noteworthy concerning SB 5 sludge: (1) This is the first batch DWPF will be processing that contains sludge that has had a significant fraction of aluminum removed through aluminum dissolution. (2) The sludge is high in mercury. (3) The sludge is high in noble metals. (4) The sludge is high in U and <b>Pu</b> [...] <b>components</b> that are not added in sludge simulants. Two SB 5 processing issues were noted during testing. First, high hydrogen generation rates were measured during experiments with both the blend and batch simulant at high acid stoichiometry. Also, the reflux time was extended due to the high mercury concentration in both the batch and blend simulant. Adding ARP will extend processing times in DWPF. The ARP caustic boil took approximately six hours. The boiling time during the experiment with added MCU was 14 hours at the maximum DWPF steam flux rate. This is comparable to the DWPF processing time for dewatering plus reflux without MCU at a 5000 lbs/hr boil-up rate, but would require significantly more time at boiling at 2000 - 2500 lbs/hr boil-up rate. The addition of ARP and MCU did not cause any other processing issues, since foaming, rheology and hydrogen generation were less of an issue while processing with ARP/MCU...|$|R
40|$|Analysis of the {{architecture}} and organization of protein structures is a major challenge to better understand protein flexibility, folding, functions and interactions with their partners and to design new drugs. Protein structures are often described as series of alpha-helices and beta-sheets, or {{at a higher level}} as an arrangement of protein domains. Due to the lack of an intermediate vision which could give a good understanding and description of protein structure architecture, we have proposed a novel intermediate view, the Protein Units (PUs). They are novel level of protein structure description between secondary structures and domains. A PU is defined as a compact sub-region of the 3 D structure corresponding to one sequence fragment, defined by a high number of intra-PU contacts and a low number of inter-PU contacts. The methodology to obtain PUs from the protein structures is named Protein Peeling (PP). For the algorithm, the protein structures are described as a succession of Ca. The distances between Ca are translated into contact probabilities using a logistic function. Protein Peeling only uses this contact probability matrix. An optimization procedure, based on the Matthews' coefficient correlation (MCC) between contacts probability sub matrices, defines optimal cutting points that separate the region examined into two or three PUs. The process is iterated until the compactness of the resulting PUs reaches a given limit. An index assesses the compactness quality and relative independence of each PU. Protein Peeling is a tool to better understand and analyze the organization of protein structures. We have developed a dedicated bioinformatic web server: Protein Peeling 2 (PP 2). Given the 3 D coordinates of a protein, it proposes an automatic identification of protein units (<b>PUs).</b> The interface <b>component</b> consists of a web page (HTML) and common gateway interface (CGI). The user can set many parameters and upload a given structure in PDB file format to a perl core instance.
