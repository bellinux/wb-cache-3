40|$|AbstractBased on the {{structure}} of a certain type of aviation axial-piston pump’s valve plate which adopts a <b>pre-pressurization</b> fluid path (consisting a damping hole, a buffer chamber, and an orifice) to reduce flow ripple, a single-piston model of the aviation axial-piston pump is presented. This single-piston model comprehensively considers fluid compressibility, orifice restriction effect, fluid resistance in the capillary tube, and the leakage flow. Besides, the instantaneous discharge areas used in the single-piston model have been calculated in detail. Based on the single-piston model, a multi-piston pump model has been established according to the simple hydraulic circuit. The single- and multi-piston pump models have been realized by the S-function in Matlab/Simulink. The developed multi-piston pump model has been validated by being compared with the numerical result by computational fluid dynamic (CFD). The effects of the <b>pre-pressurization</b> fluid path on the flow ripple and the instantaneous pressure in the piston chamber have been studied and optimized design recommendations for the aviation axial-piston pump have been given out...|$|E

40|$|An {{efficient}} {{version of}} a numerical gradient optimization procedure for the computation of solutions to periodic optimal control problems is presented. This procedure consists of a first order gradient method {{in combination with the}} Newton–Picard shooting method. The first order gradient method is able to compute the optimal control of a periodic process under one or more nonlocal constraints, such as a minimum purity constraint. The Newton–Picard method computes very efficiently periodic solutions to the state and adjoint equations. The presented numerical procedure is used to optimize a rapid pressure swing reactor and a rapid pressure swing adsorber. It is shown that the optimal cycle scheme consists of four steps: a no-inflow <b>pre-pressurization</b> step, a pressurization step, a no-inflow post-pressurization step, and a depressurization step...|$|E
40|$|A {{transient}} {{model of}} the Propulsion Test Article 1 (PTA 1) Helium Pressurization System was developed using the Generalized Fluid System Simulation Program (GFSSP). The model included feed lines from the facility interface to the engine purge interface and Liquid Oxygen (LOX) and Rocket Propellant 1 (RP- 1) tanks, the propellant tanks themselves including ullage space and propellant feed lines to their respective pump interfaces. GFSSPs capability was extended to model a control valve to maintain ullage pressure within a specified limit and pressurization processes such as heat transfer between ullage gas, propellant and the tank wall. The purpose of the model is to predict the flow system characteristics in the entire pressurization system during 80 seconds of <b>pre-pressurization</b> operation, 420 seconds of pressurization stand-by operation and 150 seconds of engine operation. Subsequent to the work presented here, the PTA 1 model has been updated to include the LOX and RP- 1 pumps, while the pressurization option itself has been modified to include the effects of mass transfer. This updated model will be compared with PTA 1 test data as it becomes available...|$|E
40|$|Composite feedlines {{with metal}} liners have the {{potential}} to reduce weight/cost while providing the same level of permeation resistance and material compatibility of all-metal feedlines carrying cryogenic propellants in spacecraft. The major technical challenges are the large difference in Coefficient of Thermal Expansion between the liner and the composite, and the manufacturing method required to make a very thin liner with the required strength and dimensional tolerance. This study investigates the use of autofrettage (compressive preload) to counteract Coefficient of Thermal Expansion when <b>pre-pressurization</b> procedures cannot be used to solve this problem. Promising materials (aluminum 2219, Inconel 718, nickel, nickel alloy) and manufacturing techniques (chemical milling, electroplating) are evaluated to determine the best liner candidates. Robust, autofrettaged feedlines with a low Coefficient of Thermal Expansion liner (Inconel 718 or nickel alloy) are shown to successfully counteract mismatch at LOX temperature. A new concept, autofrettage by temperature, is introduced for high Coefficient of Thermal Expansion materials (aluminum and pure nickel) where pressure cannot be used to add compressive preload...|$|E

Conference date: 27 – 29 January 2016 Location: Penang, Malaysia. The {{critical}} {{heat flux}} (CHF) levels that occurred due to exponential heat inputs for varying periods to a 1. 0 -mm diameter horizontal cylinder immersed in various liquids were measured to develop an extended database {{on the effect of}} various pressures and subcoolings by photographic study. Two main mechanisms of CHF were found. One mechanism is due to the time lag of the hydrodynamic instability (HI) which starts at steady-state CHF upon fully developed nucleate boiling, and the other mechanism is due to the explosive process of heterogeneous spontaneous nucleation (HSN) which occurs at a certain HSN superheat in originally flooded cavities on the cylinder surface. The incipience of boiling processes was completely different depending on <b>pre-pressurization.</b> Also, the dependence of pre-pressure in transient CHFs changed due to the wettability of boiling liquids. The objective of this work is to clarify the transient CHF phenomena due to HI or HSN by photographic...|$|E
40|$|The RL 10 -IIB engine, a {{derivative}} of the RLIO, {{is capable of}} multi-mode thrust operation. This engine operates at two low thrust levels: tank head idle (THI), which is approximately 1 to 2 percent of full thrust, and pumped idle (PI), which is 10 percent of full thrust. Operation at THI provides vehicle propellant settling thrust and efficient engine thermal conditioning; PI operation provides vehicle tank <b>pre-pressurization</b> and maneuver thrust for log-g deployment. Stable combustion of the RL 10 -IIB engine at THI and PI thrust levels {{can be accomplished by}} providing gaseous oxygen at the propellant injector. Using gaseous hydrogen from the thrust chamber jacket as an energy source, a heat exchanger can be used to vaporize liquid oxygen without creating flow instability. This report summarizes the design and analysis of a United Aircraft Products (UAP) low-rate heat transfer heat exchanger concept for the RL 10 -IIB rocket engine. The design represents a second iteration of the RL 10 -IIB heat exchanger investigation program.

40|$|The present {{series of}} {{experiments}} was designed to provide additional information on the mechanism of bubble formation in boiling liquids. In particular, knowing that a <b>pre-pressurization</b> treatment raises the boiling temperature of {{a body of water}} markedly, it was desired to determine the effect of such treatment on boiling from a metal heating surface immersed in the water. 	 A 0. 010 " nichrome wire was immersed in a vessel of water, the entire assembly having been cleaned, and subjected to a pressure of 15000 psi for periods of time in excess of 15 minutes. The pressure was reduced to atmospheric and the wire heated to burnout by electric current. It was concluded that the effect of the treatment on the maximum heat transfer was small and equivalent to degassing the water. 	 A second {{series of experiments}} was conducted in which the temperature of the wire at the onset of boiling in pre-pressurized water was measured. These experiments indicated that the wire reached a temperature considerably in excess of normal nucleation temperatures, dropping to normal at the instant of nucleation. This effect could be explained in terms of the theory which postulates bubble formation from pre-existing gas or vapor nuclei...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1968 The marine psychrophilic {{bacterium}} Vibrio marinus MP- 4 possessed a maximum temperature and hydrostatic pressure of 20 C and 425 atm for growth. The effects of temperatures of 21 and 25 C and hydrostatic pressures of 200, 400, 500, and 1, 000 atm on protein, RNA and DNA synthesis by V. marinus MP- 4 were determined. The lethal temperature of 21 C stimulated {{the synthesis of}} these 3 macromolecules, whereas 25 C stimulated RNA synthesis, stopping protein and DNA synthesis. The data indicate that the cessation of protein, RNA and DNA synthesis was not {{the primary cause of}} death of this psychrophile at temperatures above 20 C. A hydrostatic pressure of 1, 000 atm completely inhibited protein, RNA and DNA synthesis. At 200 atm the rates of protein and RNA synthesis decreased for approximately 60 min and then resumed the <b>pre-pressurization</b> 1 atm rates, whereas DNA synthesis was unaffected. Pressures of 400 and 500 atm immediately lowered the rate of protein synthesis, whereas RNA synthesis was unaffected by 400 atm. At 500 atm RNA synthesis continued at the 1 atm rate for 45 min and then shifted to a lower rate of synthesis. DNA synthesis, at 400 and 500 atm, continued at the 1 atm rate for approximately 60 min after pressurization, then gradually shifted to lower rates. Within the limits of these experiments, the pressure effects of 500 to 600 atm on protein, RNA and DNA synthesis were reversible, and these macromolecules resumed their 1 atm rates of synthesis upon pressure release. The data suggest that the primary effect of pressures from 400 to 600 atm was to lower the rate of protein synthesis, which in turn may have lowered the rates of RNA and DNA synthesis...|$|E
40|$|Until recently, the {{simultaneous}} detection {{and evaluation of}} multiple Space Transportation System (STS) element compartments for propellant leakage was not possible during the External Tank (ET) <b>pre-pressurization</b> (pre-press) phase of propellant loading; late in the loading sequence (T- 3 min to T- 0). There exist launch commit criteria (LCCS) designed to protect against leaks resulting in flammable mixtures in the intertank during the functional life of the ET; start of propellant loading through ET-Orbiter separation. However thus far, leak protection had relied {{on the premise that}} if a propellant supply system leak were to exist, it would be a leak of fixed area present at the start of propellant loading (dumb leak mode) and such a leak could be detected earlier in the loading sequence than the pre-press phase. No measures had ever been implemented which would protect against leaks potentially developing late in the loading sequence (smart leak mode), The STS community had baselined this situation as an accepted risk their decision supported by exhaustive hardware acceptance criteria and a history of many successful launches. With the recent development of improvements to the hazardous gas detection system (HGDS), an opportunity arose to monitor the intertank compartment for hazardous gas concentrations beyond the T- 3 minute mark. In this timeframe the propellant supply system is pressurized for flight and protection was sought against potential leaks generated by this pressurization process. The challenge at hand was to develop LCCs in this timeframe that were not too conservative to unnecessarily prohibit a launch, yet not too liberal to endanger crew safety and mission success. Since essentially no measurement history existed in this timeframe, the LCCs would have to rely on analysis alone. At NASA's direction, Lockheed Martin Michoud Space Systems (LMMSS) developed requirements that would protect against a smart leak during pre-press. A smart leak protection strategy is noteworthy from an STS main propulsion system (NWS) community perspective. This paper presents the resultant requirements as well as the technical and program issues involved with establishing hazardous gas LCCs for the ET intertank compartment...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of soil suction measuring techniques {{has been slow}} relative to the rapid progress in theories for unsaturated soils. The indirect measurements of soil suction generally suffer from such problems as long equalization time, poor accuracy, hysteresis, and equipment deterioration. The direct insitu measurements of matric suction have, in general, been confined to less than 100 kPa. It is highly desirable to extend the range of direct measurements to cover matric suction values normally encountered in geotechnical and geo-environmental engineering. The tensile strength of water was used to extend the range of direct measurement of matric suction. A tensiometer-type suction probe was developed using {{the principle of the}} high tensile strength of water. High positive pressures pre-applied to the suction probe were found to significantly increase the tension that could be sustained by the water in the suction probe. Various factors that may affect the tensile strength of the water in the suction probe were identified. The mechanism of cavitation in the suction probe was investigated. It was found that for a particular <b>pre-pressurization</b> procedure, a given suction probe has an approximate "cavitation threshold" of tension. If a tension does not exceed the cavitation threshold, the tension can be maintained for a relatively long period of time (e. g., several days). The cavitation threshold appears to be dependent {{on the nature of the}} ceramic used in the suction probe. The highest sustainable tension observed in this research program was about 1250 kPa. Measurements of matric suction on different soils proved that the suction probe can be used to measure matric suctions up to at least 1000 kPa with an accuracy of about ± 20 kPa. The principle of axis-translation was proved to be correct for negative pore-water pressures as low as at least $-$ 500 kPa. The suction probe appeared to be most suitable for measuring wet and clayey-type soils. Difficulties were encountered in measuring soils with a degree of saturation less than 40 %. The developed suction probe provides a direct means by which the measurements of soil suction made by other conventional methods can be evaluated. Reasonable agreements were observed among the measurements using the suction probe, and those made by the filter paper method and the thermal conductivity sensor for soils with a relatively high degree of saturation. The discrepancies became more pronounced with decreasing degree of saturation. On the other hand, the null-pressure plate gave higher values of matric suction than the suction probe for soils near or above the optimum water content. However, the discrepancies became relatively smaller as the degree of saturation was reduced. In addition, efforts were also made to investigate the possibility of using the ability of a saturated clay-water system to transfer high tensions for the measurement of soil suction. The results of this research, however, were less rewarding. The use of a saturated clay for the measurement of soil suction does not appear to be a feasible approach because of the considerable hysteresis in the mechanical behavior of the clay. Nevertheless, it may be possible to use the water-absorbing properties of other materials, such as certain water-absorbing polymers, in the measurement of soil suction...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{represents}} a laboratory-based experimental study into {{the rate of}} loading effect on the mechanical behaviour of an unsaturated pyroclastic soil. The study includes equipment design and laboratory testing which are addressed to analyze the rate of loading influence by means of equip-ment modification and suction controlled triaxial tests. The studied material, characterized by its very low density, {{is typical of the}} area around Naples where natural slopes are covered by loose silty sands of pyroclastic erupted by Vesuvius and by other volcanoes. The analyzed soil is a volcanic ash constituted by non plastic silty sand with pres-ence of pumices. The equipment design component of this research consists of the development of specialized de-vices: triaxial apparatusses and suctions probes. Two similar triaxial apparatuses capable of testing unsaturated samples under suction-controlled condition (USPv 2) were developed. The main new feature of the USPv 2 is the inclusion of a double drainage system to shorten the testing time. As two are the devices constructed, preliminary evaluation tests were performed on similar samples under similar stress conditions to assess the repeatability of tests independently of the apparatus used. On the other hand, two different types of high capacity tensiometers were developed. One of them is an integral strain-gauged tensiometer and the other one a commercial-transducer based ten-siometer. Both of them include solutions allowing the easy substitution of their parts. For each ten-siometer, a saturation process and a saturation system were designed; the main condition for these tasks was the application of relative low <b>pre-pressurization</b> pressure (800 kPa). To evaluate the per-formance of the tensiometers free evaporation tests, prolonged high suction measurements and pres-sure reversals tests were carried out. Based on the tests results, the commercial-transducer based probe was selected to be used with the USPv 2 triaxial apparatus in order to monitor pore-water pressure during suction-controlled isotropic compression tests. The laboratory-testing program of this study includes three series of tests. Isotropic compression (first serie) and deviator stage (second serie) at different stress-rate and strain-rate, respectively, were performed using the triaxial apparatus USPv 2. During isotropic compression stages the load-ing rates of 2, 8, 32, 128 kPa/h have been applied under several constant suction values (i. e. 0, 15, 45 and 300 kPa). The drained deviator stages were carried out at the same suctions levels under strain rates of 0. 25 and 2. 50 %/h. In order to study the effect of loading rate on pore-water pressure variations, a third serie of test was conducted. Suction-controlled isotropic compression tests with pore-water pressure measurement were carried out by means the USPv 2 triaxial apparatus used in combination with the commercial-transducer based tensiometer. The capacity to apply both fluid pressures to the top and the bottom of the sample significantly shortens the equalization stage. During isotropic compression stage, as the loading rate is increased the rigidity of the soil also increase, however, a loading rate value was identified from which no dif-ference was observed. The study also suggests that the excess pore-water pressure generated during isotropic loading process, that may reduce the suction value, is less significant than the creep phe-nomena for the pyroclastic soil studied. For the deformation velocities studied on deviator stage, non effect was observed on the soil behaviour. Finally, the control of pore-air pressure and pore-water pressure by both sample sides, accompanied by a short testing program addressed to deter-mine rational testing rates, reduce a lot the testing time...|$|E
