5|$|The terpenoids, {{sometimes}} referred to as isoprenoids, are organic chemicals similar to terpenes, derived from five-carbon isoprene units. There are over 10,000 known types of terpenoids. Most are multicyclic structures which differ from one another in both functional groups, and in basic carbon skeletons. Monoterpenoids, continuing 2 isoprene units, are volatile essential oils such as citronella, limonene, menthol, camphor, and pinene. Diterpenoids, 4 isoprene units, are widely distributed in latex and resins, and can be quite toxic. Diterpenes are responsible for making Rhododendron leaves <b>poisonous.</b> <b>Plant</b> steroids and sterols are also produced from terpenoid precursors, including vitamin D, glycosides (such as digitalis) and saponins (which lyse red blood cells of herbivores).|$|E
5|$|Emus {{were used}} {{as a source of}} food by {{indigenous}} Australians and early European settlers. Emus are inquisitive birds and have been known to approach humans if they see unexpected movement of a limb or piece of clothing. In the wild, they may follow and observe people. Aboriginal Australians used a variety of techniques to catch the birds, including spearing them while they drank at waterholes, catching them in nets, and attracting them by imitating their calls or by arousing their curiosity with a ball of feathers and rags dangled from a tree. The pitchuri thornapple (Duboisia hopwoodii), or some similar <b>poisonous</b> <b>plant,</b> could be used to contaminate a waterhole, after which the disoriented emus were easy to catch. Another stratagem was for the hunter to use a skin as a disguise, and the birds could be lured into a camouflaged pit trap using rags or imitation calls. Aboriginal Australians only killed emus out of necessity, and frowned on anyone who hunted them for any other reason. Every part of the carcass had some use; the fat was harvested for its valuable, multiple-use oil, the bones were shaped into knives and tools, the feathers were used for body adornment and the tendons substituted for string.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{a review of}} <b>poisonous</b> <b>plants,</b> their toxic agents and the {{symptoms}} of poisoning. <b>Poisonous</b> <b>plants</b> are plants, which as a whole or part thereof under all or certain conditions and in amount likely to be taken or into contact with an organism will exert harmful effects or causes death either immediately or by reason of cumulative action of toxic property due to presence of known or unknown chemical action. There are different types of diseases caused by some <b>poisonous</b> <b>plants.</b> <b>Poisonous</b> <b>plants</b> can reduce livestock productivity depending on the effect they have and the amount consumed. Since <b>poisonous</b> <b>plants</b> are potential threats to the livestock industry {{it is important that}} farmers are carefully to avoid contamination of rations prepared for livestock and removal of <b>poisonous</b> <b>plants</b> from grazing lands. Prevention and precautions are {{the best way to avoid}} any economic loss...|$|R

40|$|The dissertation's {{topic is}} <b>poisonous</b> <b>plants</b> {{and their use}} in {{instruction}} in an interdisciplinary context. This work provides information about plant psychotropic substances and their effects on human body. The dissertation seeks to highlight {{the importance of this}} topic in education and suggest its implementation in practice. The theoretical part is divided into chapters. The first chapter profiles current textbooks for elementary and high schools. It discusses <b>poisonous</b> <b>plants,</b> their substances, and, in some cases, warnings regarding their hazardousness. On these themes are localized also research of curriculum documents for elementary education and curriculum documents for high school. Chapter two contains more detailed information about <b>poisonous</b> <b>plants</b> that are most often mentioned in elementary and high school textbooks. The third chapter is about psychoactive plants, their possible use and misuse, and drug prevention in schools. This chapter resulted from the lack of information about first aid in textbooks. The practical part contains a questionnaire that assesses students' awareness of <b>poisonous</b> <b>plants</b> and drugs. The dissertation also contains suggestions for activities with <b>poisonous</b> <b>plants</b> in instruction...|$|R
500|$|Nebraska proved {{resistant}} to Meeker's sales pitch, and near Brady, the ox Twist died, possibly after eating a <b>poisonous</b> <b>plant.</b> [...] Meeker had to wire home to supporters for money. [...] He hired teams of horses {{to pull the}} wagon on a temporary basis, and an attempt with two cows was not successful. He was able to temporarily yoke Dave with a cow which proved more suitable. [...] At the Omaha Stockyards, Meeker found another ox, which he named Dandy, and broke him in {{on the way to}} Indianapolis, near where Meeker had once lived and [...] by road from Puyallup. Beginning in Nebraska, Meeker began to sell postcards from photos taken on the way—there was then a craze for postcards in the United States. He also arranged for the printing of a book about his 1852 trip, much of which he wrote during noontime halts on his 1906 trip. [...] The funds from the sales of these items allowed him to meet expenses on the road. Meeker's exploits were closely followed in newspapers on the West Coast as eastern and midwestern stories about him were reprinted there—when westerners perceived any slights towards Meeker, indignant editorials followed.|$|E

In 1840 he undertook an expedition to King George Sound, helping to identify a <b>poisonous</b> <b>plant</b> {{as the cause of}} many stock deaths in the area. In 1841 he went in search of good squatting land to the east of their land in Toodyay. The expedition, which included [...] Captain John Scully, Samuel Pole Phillips and Johnston Drummond, [...] discovered the vast tract of open pastoral land that is now known as the Victoria Plains. Following this expedition, Drummond put together what is now known as Drummond's 1st Collection.|$|E

60|$|I {{can only}} grope my way now through vague and {{baffling}} memories.

With full, vigilant eyes I am standing again a few paces {{from the brink of}} the pool, looking up into a moonlit bush of deadly nightshade, its noxious flowering over, and hung with its black, gleaming, cherry-like fruit. I cannot recall having ever given a thought to this <b>poisonous</b> <b>plant</b> in Wanderslore during my waking hours, though in my old happy reconnoitrings of the garden I had sometimes chanced on the coral-red clusters of the woody nightshade--the bittersweet, and had afterwards seen it in blossom.|$|E
60|$|I {{looked at}} Cordova from the bell-tower of the cathedral. The roofs, very lovely in their {{diversity}} of colour, were of rounded tiles, fading with every variety of delicate shade from russet and brown to yellow and the tenderest green. From the courtyards, here and there, rose a tall palm, or an orange-tree, like {{a dash of}} jade against the brilliant sun. The houses, plainly whitewashed, have from the outside so mean a look that it is surprising to find them handsome and spacious within. They are built, Moorish fashion, round a patio, which in Cordova at least is always gay with flowers. When you pass the iron gates and note {{the contrast between the}} snowy gleaming of the street and that southern greenery, the suggestion is inevitable of charming people who must rest there in the burning heat of summer. With those surroundings and in such a country passion grows surely like a <b>poisonous</b> <b>plant.</b> At night, in the starry darkness, how irresistible must be the flashing eyes of love, how eloquent the pleading of whispered sighs! But woe to the maid who admits the ardent lover among the orange-trees, her head reeling with the sweet intoxication of the blossom; for the Spanish gallant is fickle, quick to forget the vows he spoke so earnestly: he soon grows tired of kissing, and mounting his horse, rides fast away.|$|E
