5|$|Flight leader Lt. Charles C.

It was determined that Taylor had <b>passed</b> <b>over</b> the Bahamas as scheduled, and he did in fact lead his flight to the northeast over the Atlantic. The report noted that some subordinate officers did likely know their approximate position as indicated by radio transmissions stating that flying west would result in reaching the mainland.|$|E

5|$|Gale force winds {{affected}} the Delmarva Peninsula; on Poplar Island in Talbot County, Maryland, winds peaked at 1600UTC on September 3.

Fierce winds were observed in Cape Henlopen, Delaware, with the strongest gales occurring after the eye <b>passed</b> <b>over</b> the area.|$|E

5|$|Hilda {{gradually}} weakened over cool waters but {{maintained a}} rather large level of circulation. This caused its dissipation to be slower than normal. Tropical Depression Hilda dissipated on August 14. It large remnant circulation continued northwards and eventually <b>passed</b> <b>over</b> California. There were no casualties or damages attributed to this tropical cyclone. Hilda's remnants caused rain {{as far north as}} San Francisco.|$|E
5|$|Joan {{gradually}} strengthened as it <b>passed</b> <b>over</b> {{the southern}} Windward Islands on October 15. It continued heading west {{in response to}} a strong Ridge, and <b>passed</b> <b>over</b> the Guajira Peninsula on October 17. After entering the extreme southwestern Caribbean Sea, Joan strengthened into a hurricane. It then slowly executed a small counterclockwise loop, possibly in response to the nearby Tropical Depression Eighteen. Upwelling caused by the quasi-stationary hurricane weakened the system. As the nearby depression dissipated, Joan resumed its westward track. A strong anticyclone over the southwestern Caribbean Sea created an extremely favorable environment, and Joan underwent rapid deepening at a rate of 38millibars {{in the space of a}} day. With a minimum pressure of 932millibars, Joan was one of the strongest October hurricanes since 1961. At the time, it was located at 12°N, the southernmost Category 4 hurricane ever recorded at the time. That record has since been broken by Hurricane Ivan.|$|E
