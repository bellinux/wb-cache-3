50|$|Where {{colonies of}} Eriosoma lanigerum feed on twigs and roots the tree forms galls, which are small {{initially}} but increase in size {{over time and}} are most damaging when they are formed among the roots. Continued feeding in the roots can destroy the roots and consequently reduce {{the growth of the}} tree or kill it. The aphids are attracted to the sunken sites caused by the <b>perennial</b> <b>canker</b> fungus Cryptosporiopsis perennans and the galls are then the most frequent places on the tree for the fungus to re-infect it. The galls can also allow infection by Gloeosporium sp. The galls are more sensitive to cold weather than the surrounding tissue and burst at -18°C(0°F), the resulting damage providing the fungus with an entry site for reinfection. As the aphids feed they produce a honeydew which drips onto the fruit allowing the growth of sooty mould which has an impact on the saleability of the fruit. The honeydew can also create unpleasant conditions for orchard workers to work in due to high levels of sticky honeydew excreted. The honeydew can also cover the leaves allowing the mould to grow there too. The aphids can also infest the apples, especially on varieties with an open calyx when the aphis can feed on the apple core.|$|E

40|$|California is {{the second}} largest sweet cherry {{producer}} in the United States with annual revenues up to $ 200 million. The South Australian cherry industry generates about 10 % of Australia's overall production with approximately 1, 500 metric tons of cherries produced yearly. In California, <b>perennial</b> <b>canker</b> diseases and subsequent branch dieback are responsible for extensive damage throughout sweet cherry orchards, reducing annual yields and tree longevity. Surveys of cherry orchards and isolation work were conducted in California to identify the main canker-causing agents. Calosphaeria pulchella was the main fungus isolated from cankers, followed by Eutypa lata and Leucostoma persoonii, respectively. Preliminary surveys in cherry orchards in South Australia documented C. pulchella and L. persoonii in cankers. The pathogenicity of C. pulchella in sweet cherry was confirmed following field inoculations of 2 - to 3 -year-old branches. C. pulchella was able to infect healthy wood and produce cankers with as much virulence as E. lata or L. persoonii. Spore trapping studies were conducted in two sweet cherry orchards in California to investigate the seasonal abundance of C. pulchella spores. Experiments showed that rain and sprinkler irrigation were important factors for aerial dissemination. Finally, this study illustrates the symptoms and signs of the new disease Calosphaeria canker.

Older trees can survive initial attacks, but tend to succumb eventually after several seasons of infection.|$|R
40|$|Grapevine {{is among}} the most famous fruit crops grown in Taif {{governorate}} in Saudi Arabia that characterized with its special quality and test. Grapevine disease caused by botryosphaeriaceous fungi include leaf spots, fruit rots, shoot dieback, bud necrosis, vascular discoloration of the wood, and <b>perennial</b> <b>cankers</b> among the most dangerous Grapevine disease. However, there are no studies about the status (occurrence or absence) of these important diseases in KSA generally or in Taif region has been reported. Therefore, the resent study was aimed to use the modern molecular genetics tools to report the status of the Botryosphaeria spp and its associated diseases in Taif. In this respect, the symptoms of four diseases caused by Botryosphaeria spp (Black rot, Macrophoma rot, Black dead arm and Botryosphaeria canker) were monitored in the grapevine farms in Taif. Among the four diseases, only the symptoms of Black rot were observed in some farms. Subsequently, the symbiotic samples of the Black rot were collected and their associated fungus spp were isolated in the lab. Ten isolates were obtained, characterized and identified at the morphological level. However, the fungus of the black rot disease, G. bidwellii, was not identified. Alternatively, the phylogenetic analyses of ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions performed by conventional PCR. Sequencing analysis of the amplified fragment was obtained and aligned to the know...|$|R
40|$|Normal 0 MicrosoftInternetExplorer 4 Normal 0 MicrosoftInternetExplorer 4 Species in the Botryosphaeriaceae have a {{cosmopolitan}} distribution, and occur {{on a wide}} range of annual and perennial hosts including grapevines. To date, morphological and taxonomic studies, as well as analyses of nucleotide sequences of multiple genes, have allowed the identification of at least 21 different species in the Botryosphaeriaceae occurring in grapevines worldwide. Grapevine disease symptoms caused by members of this family include leaf spots, fruit rots, shoot dieback, bud necrosis, vascular discoloration of the wood, and <b>perennial</b> <b>cankers,</b> and their current status as pathogens is reviewed. Additionally, the disease name Botryosphaeria dieback is proposed here to describe the different grapevine trunk disease symptoms caused by species of Botryosphaeriaceae. Much has been written during the last decade about the association between species in the Botryosphaeriaceae and grapevine trunk diseases, which has contributed to a better understanding of the role that these fungal taxa play in grapevine diseases. Although virulence has been shown to vary between species and isolates of the same species in different countries, these fungi have become well-recognized as important grapevine pathogens worldwide. Latest and novel findings from studies conducted in different countries, on disease etiology and species distribution, epidemiology and biology are discussed. Much progress has been achieved in the development and implementation of novel diagnostic and detection techniques. Vineyard sanitation techniques, as well as chemical, biological, and cultural control strategies available at the present time to reduce the infection caused by botryosphaeriaceous fungi, are presented in this review.   </span...|$|R
40|$|Fungi {{belonging}} to the Botryosphaeriaceae family are well known as cosmopolitan pathogens, saprophytes and endophytes and occur {{on a wide range}} of hosts including grapevine. Grapevine disease symptoms caused by members of this family include leaf spots, fruit rots, shoot dieback, bud necrosis, vascular discoloration of the wood, and <b>perennial</b> <b>cankers</b> (1). The nature and appearance of wood symptoms caused by these pathogens suggest that phytotoxic metabolites could be involved in the host–pathogen interaction. For example phytotoxins such as (3 R, 4 R) -(-) and (3 R, 4 S) -(-) - 4 -hydroxymelleins, isosclerone and tyrosol has been isolated and identified from a strain of Neofusicoccum parvum isolated from symptomatic grapevines in Catalogna (2). Another species, N. australe involved in the aetiology of grapevine cordon dieback in Italy, showed to produce in vitro structurally different secondary metabolites. The main phytotoxin, named cyclobotryoxide, was characterized as a new cyclohexenone oxide (1). It was produced together with 3 -methylcatechol and tyrosol (3). In addition, the species Diplodia seriata showed to produce already known melleins as (3 S, 4 R) - 4 -hydroxymellein, (3 S) - 7 -hydroxymellein and a new one characterized as (3 S, 4 R) - 4, 7 -dihydroxymellein (4). More recently, a new species of Lasiodiplodia was isolated from declining grapevines in Sardinia (Italy). This still undescribed species showed to produce in liquid culture several phytotoxic secondary metabolites. In this communication the chemical and biological characterization of these bioactive secondary metabolites is discussed together with their role in the pathogenesis process. (1) ÚRBEZ-TORRES, J. R.

40|$|Graduation date: 1986 Anisogramma anomala {{causes a}} stem canker of filberts, Corylus avellana. This disease became {{a threat to}} the main U. S. filbert growing region when it was {{introduced}} into the Pacific Northwest around 1968. Various methods of artificially inoculating filbert trees and seeds were explored. Less than 1 % of potted filbert trees inoculated with ascospores produced symptoms after 4 years. The disease was not transmitted following graft inoculation of orchard trees with infected tissue. Ascospores had no effect on germination or growth of Corylus seedlings. Spread of existing cankers was compared on the susceptible cultivar 'Daviana' and the more resistant cultivar 'Barcelona'. There was no significant difference (t=. 05) in canker elongation between cultivars, or between spread up and down the stems. Vertical elongation of <b>perennial</b> <b>cankers</b> averaged 26. 2 cm/year. Methods for storing ascospores prior to germination, and conditions for germinating ascospores were explored. Spores exhibited no loss of viability after 2 months when cankered twigs were stored below 0 ° C. Ascospores remained viable for less than 14 days following discharge in water. Drying was lethal to hydrated spores. Ascospores commenced germination 24 hours after hydration when placed on a suitable medium in a proper atmosphere. Germination occurred between 5 ° and 25 ° C, with an optimum of 20 °. Optimum pH for germination was between 4. 2 and 5. 7. A direct relationship was detected between ascospore concentration and percent germination. Eight antibiotics were screened in an attempt to prevent bacterial contamination. 10 ppm Rifampicin or 100 ppm Kanamycin effectively inhibited bacterial contaminants without affecting ascospore germination. Germination was compared on many different complex and defined media, and with different amendments added to the media. Various Corylus extracts had no effect on spore germination. 1 % ethanol and 5 % sucrose increased germination. Casamino acids, cornmeal or peptone promoted growth beyond the initial germ tube. Several stages of ascospore germination and early hyphal growth are described...|$|R
