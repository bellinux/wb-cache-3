ADAGEN (<b>pegademase</b> bovine) manufactured by Enzon Pharmaceuticals, Inc., US {{was the first}} PEGylated protein approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in March 1990, to enter the market.

Since the introduction of ADAGEN, a large number of PEGylated protein and peptide pharmaceuticals have followed and many others are under clinical trial or under development stages. Sales of the two most successful products, Pegasys and Neulasta, exceeded $5 billion in 2011. All commercially available PEGylated pharmaceuticals contain methoxypoly(ethylene glycol) or mPEG.

40|$|ABSTRACf: Severe {{combined}} immunodeficiency (SCID) represents a syndrome characterized by abnormal function of cellular and humoral immunity. Of {{the various types}} of SCID, approximately one-fourth are associated with adenosine dearninase (ADA) deficiency. Treatment consists of bone marrow transplantation, red blood cell transfusions, enzyme replacement, and, more recently, gene therapy. <b>Pegademase</b> bovine is the sole agent available for enzyme replacement therapy of SCID associated with ADA deficiency. The drug is administered intramuscularly to infants from birth and to children of any age at time of diagnosis. At present, few adverse effects or drug interactions have been documented.

40|$|The {{chemical}} attachment of poly(ethylene glycol) [PEG] to therapeutic proteins produces several benefits, including enhanced plasma half-life, lower toxicity, {{and increased}} drug stability and solubility. In certain instances, pegylation of a protein can increase its therapeutic efficacy {{by reducing the}} ability of the immune system to detect and mount an attack on the compound. A PEG-protein conjugate is formed by first activating the PEG moiety so that it will react with, and couple to, the protein. PEG moieties vary considerably in molecular weight and conformation, with the early moieties (monofunctional PEGs; mPEGs) being linear with molecular weights of 12 kD or less, and later moieties being of increased molecular weights. PEG 2, a recent innovation in PEG technology, involves the coupling of a 30 kD (or less) mPEG to lysine that is further reacted to form a branched structure that behaves like a linear mPEG of much larger molecular weight. These compounds are pH and temperature stable, and this factor along with the large molecular weight may account for the restricted volume of distribution seen with drugs utilising these reagents. Three PEG-protein conjugates are currently approved for clinical use in the US, with more under clinical development. <b>Pegademase</b> is used in the treatment of severe combined immunodeficiency disease, pegaspargase for the treatment of various leukaemias, and pegylated interferon-α for chronic hepatitis C virus infections. As illustrated {{in the case of the}} 2 pegylated interferon-αs, all pegylated proteins are not equal. The choice of PEG reagent and coupling chemistry is critical to the properties of the PEG-protein conjugate, with the molecular weight of the moiety affecting its rate and route of clearance from the body, and coupling chemistry affecting the strength of the covalent attachment of PEG to therapeutic protein...|$|E
30|$|To date, {{numerous}} nanoparticles (NPs) delivery {{has been}} used to deliver drugs, including polymeric NPs, liposome, microspheres, cell and cell derivatives [1]. As potential drug delivery systems, cell and cell derivatives have been widely researched recently, such as erythrocyte (RBC), tumor cell, stem cell, macrophage, dendritic cell. [2 – 4]. Among them, erythrocyte widely attracted the attention of researchers. Comparing with other cell drug carriers, erythrocyte is easier to be separated, with better biological compatibility as well as the inherent biological degradation. Besides that, it also has the remarkable long life span of about 3  months in the body [5]. Therefore, small-molecule drugs (doxorubicin [6], dexamethasone sodium phosphate [7]), enzyme (<b>pegademase,</b> adenosine deaminase [8], L-Asprraginase [9]), nucleoside (FdUMP [10], antisense oligodeoxynucleotides [11]), and nanoparticles [12] have been encapsulated in erythrocyte. In recent years, nanoparticles derived from erythrocyte (Nano-RBCs), have strongly attracted the attention of investigators due to the virtue inherited from their parent cells. Besides that, nanoparticles contain therapeutic molecule which could camouflaged themselves with erythrocyte membrane to reduce toxicity [13]. Researches revealed that polymeric nanoparticles loaded in Nano-RBCs showed longer circulation time in blood than PEG-medicated nanoparticles [14]. Besides, coating with Nano-RBC membrane could protect the original nanoparticle from being uptake by macrophage [15]. 1 – 1.5 [*]×[*] 109 erythrocyte ghosts can split into 1.6 [*]×[*] 1012 nanoparticles without considering the loss of erythrocyte membrane. Nanoparticles derived from erythrocyte have high surface area-volume ratio, and its diameter can be small to 100  nm, which helps them easily transmit in vivo [16]. The popular method of Nano-RBC preparation is using hypotonic medium to make erythrocyte change to erythrocyte ghost and then split to smaller vesicles with ultrasonic bath, finally extrude the vesicles through polycarbonate membrane from different pore sizes to unified size gradually [14, 15]. Besides, tip sonicator could also split the Nano-RBCs to around 100  nm directly [16]. So far, a variety of nanoparticles [14, 15] and a small-molecule weight drug (Fasudil, paclitaxel, and doxorubicin) [17, 18] have been encapsulated into Nano-RBC, such as vaccine encapsulated in polymeric nanoparticles and coated with Nano-RBC was developed to prevent the melanoma [19]. Besides, the Nano-RBC with gold nanocages was prepared to improve the efficiency of the photothermal therapy [20].|$|E
