2500|$|When activated, some earlier ABS systems {{caused the}} brake pedal to pulse noticeably. As most drivers rarely {{or do not}} brake hard enough to cause brake lock-up, and drivers {{typically}} do not read the vehicle's owners manual, {{this may not be}} noticeable until an emergency. Some manufacturers have therefore implemented a brake assist system that determines that the driver is attempting a [...] "panic stop" [...] (by detecting that the brake pedal was depressed very fast, unlike a normal stop where the <b>pedal</b> <b>pressure</b> would usually be gradually increased, Some systems additionally monitor the rate at the accelerator was released) and the system automatically increases braking force where not enough pressure is applied. Hard or panic braking on bumpy surfaces, because of the bumps causing the speed of the wheel(s) to become erratic may also trigger the ABS, sometimes causing the system to enter its ice mode, where the system severely limits maximum available braking power. Nevertheless, ABS significantly improves safety and control for drivers in most on-road situations.|$|E

Systolic pressures were also measured at either the posterior tibial or dorsal pedal artery {{by using the}} Doppler technique with the ultrasound probe. Ankle pressures were obtained in normal subjects and in patients with peripheral vascular disease, particularly patients with calcified or incompressible vessels or with different posterior tibial and dorsal <b>pedal</b> Doppler <b>pressures.</b> Systolic pressures by oscillometry and by Doppler were equal in normal subjects and in functionally normal limbs of patients. In the presence of mild vascular disease, systolic pressure was decreased and mean and diastolic pressures were within normal limits. Measurements by Doppler and by oscillometry were similar. In patients with moderate disease, the systolic pressure by oscillometry, although decreased, was consistently higher than Dopper pressures, and the mean ankle pressure was decreased. In patients with different posterior tibial and dorsal <b>pedal</b> <b>pressures,</b> the systolic oscillometric pressure was closer to the highest Doppler pressure measured. In contrast, in patients with partially incompressible vessels, the systolic oscillometric pressure was consistently lower than Doppler pressures.

We investigated the response timing of drivers against navigator utterances and found that most overlapped with the preceding utterance due to the task characteristics and the features of Japanese. When comparing utterance length, speaking rate, and the filler rate of driver utterances in human-human and human-machine dialogs, we found that drivers tended to use longer and faster utterances with more fillers to talk with humans than machines. 1...|$|R

As a result, more powerful braking performance is obtained with less <b>pedal</b> <b>pressure</b> in emergency braking situations even when carrying a large payload.

40|$|Trauma, in {{the form}} of {{pressure}} and/or friction from footwear, is a common cause of foot ulceration in people with diabetes. These practical recommendations regarding the provision of footwear for people with diabetes were agreed upon following review of existing position statements and clinical guidelines. The aim of this process was not to re-invent existing guidelines but to provide practical guidance for health professionals on how they can best deliver these recommendations within the Australian health system. Where information was lacking or inconsistent, a consensus was reached following discussion by all authors. Appropriately prescribed footwear, used alone or in conjunction with custom-made foot orthoses, can reduce <b>pedal</b> <b>pressures</b> and reduce the risk of foot ulceration. It is important for all health professionals involved in the care of people with diabetes to both assess and make recommendations on the footwear needs of their clients or to refer to health professionals with such skills and knowledge. Individuals with more complex footwear needs (for example those who require custom-made medical grade footwear and orthoses) should be referred to health professionals with experience in the prescription of these modalities and who are able to provide appropriate and timely follow-up. Where financial disadvantage is a barrier to individuals acquiring appropriate footwear, health care professionals should be aware of state and territory based equipment funding schemes that can provide financial assistance. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders and people living in rural and remote areas are likely to have limited access to a broad range of footwear. Provision of appropriate footwear to people with diabetes in these communities needs be addressed as part of a comprehensive national strategy to reduce the burden of diabetes and its complications on the health system...|$|R

50|$|Also, {{drum brakes}} {{do not apply}} {{immediately}} when the wheel cylinders are pressurized, because {{the force of the}} return springs must be overcome before the shoes start to move towards the drum.

In practice, a metering valve prevents hydraulic pressure from reaching the front calipers until pressure rises enough to overcome the return springs in the drum brakes. If the metering valve were left out, the vehicle would stop only with the front discs until return spring pressure on the rear shoes were overcome.|$|E

40|$|The growing {{introduction}} of new technologies inside vehicles represents a set of extra information sources. Its use can interfere with the driving activity and induce performance decrements. An on-road experiment was conducted to investigate how drivers reacted to the simultaneous interaction with in-vehicle systems. Forty-eight subjects (elderly, reference and novice) participated in the tests. They were asked to interact with one (road guidance system) or two (road guidance system and mobile phone) on-board devices. Their performance was evaluated for the turn left manoeuvres and main effects of system conditions were revealed. The simultaneous interaction with both in-vehicle systems induced participants to some performance decrements on the driving task: higher number of late activations of the turning indicator; lower mean speeds before the intersection; lower values of instant speed {{at the beginning of}} the turn manoeuvre; higher steering wheel variability; activations of the braking <b>pedal</b> with less <b>pressure,</b> later, and performing a higher number of strokes; and also less glances towards important areas of the environment.

50|$|Brake fade is {{not always}} due to overheating. Water between the {{friction}} surfaces and the drum {{can act as a}} lubricant and reduce braking efficiency. The water tends to stay until heated sufficiently to vaporize, at which point braking efficiency returns. All friction braking systems have a maximum theoretical rate of energy conversion. Once that rate is reached, applying greater <b>pedal</b> <b>pressure</b> doesn't change it—in fact, the effects mentioned can substantially reduce it. Ultimately, this is what brake fade is, regardless of the mechanisms of its causes. Disc brakes are not immune to any of these processes, but they deal with heat and water more effectively than drums.|$|E

50|$|The air {{pressure}} system on a tire changer provides {{the air to}} inflate tires mounted on wheels. The {{air pressure}} system consists of 4 components: air hose, air inflation gauge, inflation <b>pedal</b> and manual <b>pressure</b> bleed valve. The air hose is located {{near the top of}} the tire changer, and it allows compressed air to travel into the tire. A specialized end is used on the air hose to clamp firmly onto valve stems of the wheels. The air inflation gauge displays the air pressure within the tire when the air hose is connected to the valve stem. The air inflation gauge displays the pressure in pounds per square inch (psi). Directly below the air hose on the side of the tire changer is the inflation pedal that enables the inflation of the tire. When the inflation pedal is raised, a burst of air is released from valves next to each rim clamp toward the bottom bead of the tire to help with inflation. The manual bleed valve is located next to the air hose and air inflation gauge. The manual bleed valve allows the manual release of air pressure from tire.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to analyse driving behaviour and to characterize the effectsof an efficient way of driving, termed eco-driving, that enables the driver to reduce fuelconsumption and CO 2 emissions. The approach used to assess driving style {{is a collection of}} data from a CAN bus of acar equipped with OBD-II (on-board diagnostic) system. The driving experiment wasperformed for nine drivers who drove in a normal way or regular driving style and onedriver was an eco-driver who drove in an economical driving style.

A hierarchical clustering algorithm also used to classify the drivers based on theaverage result of the signals. In the results, a driving difference between the eco-driver and the normal drivers is visi-ble, most of the normal drivers have more or less similar behaviour. The average speed ofthe eco-driver lower than the normal drivers and the accelerator (gas pedal) result is alsoshown less usage by the eco-driver than the normal drivers. On the other hand, the eco-driver has braked more often than the normal drivers, but gently.

2500|$|Cavaillé-Coll is {{responsible}} for many innovations that revolutionized organ building, performance and composition. Instead of the Positif, Cavaillé-Coll placed the Grand-Chœur manual as the lowest manual, and included couplers that allowed the entire tonal resources of the organ to be played from the Grand-Chœur. He refined the English swell box by devising a spring-loaded (later balanced) pedal with which the organist could operate the swell shutters, thus increasing the organ's potential for expression. He adjusted pipemaking and voicing techniques, thus creating a whole family of stops imitating orchestral instruments such as the bassoon, the oboe and the english horn. He popularized the harmonic flute stop, which, together with the montre, the gambe and the bourdon, formed the fonds (foundations) of the organ. He introduced divided windchests which were controlled by ventils. [...] These allowed the use of higher wind pressures and for each manual's anches (reed stops) to be added or subtracted as a group {{by means of a}} <b>pedal.</b> Higher wind <b>pressures</b> allowed the organ to include many more stops of 8' (unison) pitch in every division, so complete fonds as well as reed choruses could be placed in every division, designed to be superimposed on top of one another. Sometimes he placed the treble part of the compass on a higher pressure than the bass, to emphasize melody lines and counteract the natural tendency of small pipes (especially reeds) to be softer.|$|R
