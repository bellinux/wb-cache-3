40|$|The third-stage larvae {{of several}} genera of anisakid {{nematodes}} are important etiological agents for zoonotic human anisakiasis. The present {{study investigated the}} prevalence of potentially zoonotic anisakid larvae in fish collected on the coastal shelves off Madang and Rabaul in Papua New Guinea (PNG) where fish represents {{a major component of}} the diet. Nematodes were found in seven fish species including Decapterus macarellus, Gerres oblongus, <b>Pinjalo</b> lewisi, <b>Pinjalo</b> <b>pinjalo,</b> Selar crumenophthalmus, Scomberomorus maculatus and Thunnus albacares. They were identified by both light and scanning electron microscopy as Anisakis Type I larvae. Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of the ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and the mitochondrial cytochrome C oxidase subunit II (cox 2) gene identified all nematodes as Anisakis typica. This study represents the first in-depth characterisation of Anisakis larvae from seven new fish hosts in PNG. The overall prevalence of larvae was low (7. 6 %) and no recognised zoonotic Anisakis species were identified, suggesting a very low threat of anisakiasis in PNG...|$|E
40|$|A {{molecular}} {{approach was}} developed to distinguish species of red snappers among commercial salted fish products. The specific fragments of the mitochondrial 12 S rRNA gene, which were about 450 bp, were obtained using the semi-nested polymerase chain reaction (semi-nested PCR). Subsequently, PCR arnplicons were sequenced, aiming to select restriction endonucleases that generated species-specific {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} (RFLP) profiles. Discrimination of red snappers Lutjanus sanguineus, Lutjanus erythopterus from Lutjanus argentimaculatus, Lutjanus malabarius and other morphologically similar fishes such as Lethrinus leutjanus and <b>Pinjalo</b> <b>pinjalo</b> was feasible by one restriction digestion reaction with three endonucleases Hae III, Sca I and SnaB I, however, for discrimination of L. sanguineus and L. erythopterus, another restriction digestion reaction with single restriction endonuclease Mae II was needed. The semi-nested PCR-RFLP was demonstrated to be reliable in species identification of salted fish products in this study. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Survey were {{conducted}} in nine fish landing centres (Pamban South, Mandapam South, Keelakarai, Ervadi, Vembar, Tharuvaikulam, Thirespuram, Tuticorin and Amalinagar) along the Gulf of Mannar region to assess the diversity, catch rate of snappers and job fishes caught in different fishing gears. A total of thirty species of fishes belonging to the family Lutjanidae (snappers and job fishes) were identified which belonged to five genera viz., Lutjanus, <b>Pinjalo,</b> Aphareus, Etelis and Pristipomoides. Highest species diversity was observed in the gear, coral reef fish trap (24 species), followed by hook and line (21 species). Principal Component Analysis revealed four typical groups based on the fish species caught from five different gears. Fishes caught in hook & line, shrimp trawl net and fish trawl net formed individual group, whereas coral reef fish trap and bottom set gill net together formed another group. Mean CPUE values for the observed fishing practices varied significantly and the value {{were higher in the}} Fish trawl net (107 Â± 33. 5 kg/ fishing trip). Sharing pattern of the fishery resources among the crew members varied between fishing villages and fishing practices...|$|E
