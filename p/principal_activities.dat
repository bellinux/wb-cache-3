2500|$|Caledonian Airways was {{a wholly}} private, {{independent}} Scottish charter airline formed in April 1961. It {{began with a}} single 104-seat Douglas DC-7C leased from Sabena. Caledonian grew rapidly over the coming years to become the leading transatlantic [...] "affinity group" [...] charter operator {{by the end of}} the decade. During that period, passenger numbers grew from just 8,000 in 1961 to 800,000 in 1970. The latter represented 22.7% of all British non-scheduled passengers. It also became Britain's most consistently profitable and financially most secure independent airline of its era, never failing to make a profit in all its ten years of existence. By the end of 1970, Caledonian operated an all-jet fleet consisting of eleven aircraft and provided employment for over 1,000 workers. At that time, its <b>principal</b> <b>activities</b> included group charters between North America, Europe and the Far East using Boeing 707s, and general charter and inclusive tour (IT) activities in Europe utilising One-Elevens.

2500|$|The <b>principal</b> <b>activities</b> {{inside the}} park in summer are sport fishing as well as boat or canoe trips. Navigation by boat is in fact {{one of the best}} ways to explore the park, and the island of Sandön is {{particularly}} popular. The park also attracts many bird watchers in winter and spring, especially near Tinäset where the birdlife is the richest. However, the part of the road that enabled one to get there was closed because it traversed the park — which closing was decided during the park's creation. As a result, the number of tourists at this location diminished considerably. A visitor, information, and nature center was built inside an old barn (dating from 1814) of the Gysinge forge. At Skekarsbo, an observation tower [...] in height was constructed in 1995 and offers a panoramic view over the major part of the park. Several hiking trails exist {{inside the park}}, in particular in the north part: on the isle of Mattön (between Gysinge and Sevedskvarn), a part of Gästrikeleden across the park from Gysinge, and from Kyrkstigen up to Skekarsbo. In the southern part, a long trail leads to Tinäset.|$|E
