40|$|The paper {{concerns}} {{some elements}} {{of the construction of}} worlds represented on stage in recent Polish theatre. This may be seen as a comment on the state of democratic Poland after 1989 and, more generally, as an analysis of the peculiarities of the contemporary world. However, a deeper analysis shows recent theatre staging as structurally similar to the construction of dystopias. The worlds represented on stage are characterized by the presence of a nonlinear construction of time, by the absence of ending, of a horizon and of death, by the presence of ruins (intended literally, as an aesthetic paradigm, and metaphorically) and by the construction of dystopian characters. The analysis focuses {{on one of the most}} important performances for the Polish political theatre of the last two decades, H. (2004), a version of Hamlet directed by Jan Klata, performed in the historic and derelict Gdańsk Shipyard, a symbolic stage set which becomes at the same time the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>fulfilment</b> of dystopia and of the emergence of the desire for utopia.

40|$|GreenLife is {{the name}} of the retail {{interior}} design project that embodies this thesis. Using interior design as a medium to influence customers,I sought to create an environment that promotes a connection to nature and an awareness of creative possiblities within the context of a store. It addresses the problem of personal social responsiblity by using shopping, a dominant activity in the western world, as a tool for change. As a project, GreenLife attempts to answer three questions: How does design inform cultural experience? How can a connection with nature inform consumerism? Can a store transcend its purpose from filling materialistic needs to become a <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>fulfilment?</b> I theorize that if offered a desireable alternative to products that create excess waste and harm our surroundings, an individual will choose the green option, because it will satisfy both a materialistic want and an emotional desire to feel good by personally contributing to help our environment. If these options are presented with a sense of beauty, fun and exploration, it can change how we culturally perceive social responsibility, removing guilt and making it a matter of course. GreenLife is a store designed as a model home with all products set up in a testable format. The interactive nature of the design is intended to provide education and a sense of security within a pleasureable experience, allowing people to confidently choose to live green in their own homes, and to thoughtfully consider the possiblities in other aspects of their lives...|$|E

40|$|The house {{which appears}} {{at the end of}} the journey up the river Thames is the very core of the utopian topography: that token of human history {{belonging}} to ancient stages of civilization has survived «successive waves of degradation. » Ellen’s words emphasize the mythical nature of the house: that work of Beauty, untouched by the corrupting flux of time, has waited until the end of the machine age for the new birth of mankind. The immutability of «an old house amongst new folk» throughout the centuries reveals how deeply affiliated it is with an archetypal site, the locus amoenus where man enjoys freedom from toil and sorrow. The condition of oneiric suspension, even stasis, seems to prevail over the dynamic forces of change and mutability. The unproblematic relationship between man and nature in the new England may well be regarded as the projection of an ancestral desire for the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>fulfilment,</b> where, according to Morris’s utopian project, the opposite moods of energy and idleness have been reconciled in the cohesion between pleasurable work and rest within nature. More recent critical readings have focused on the author’s attempt to merge the atemporal, escapist element of the rural idyll with the dynamic process ruling the civilized world. Northrop Frye has observed that «to make craftsmanship the basis of industry implies an immense simplification of human wants – this is the pastoral element in Morris’s vision. [ [...] . ] The pastoral theme of the unity of man and physical nature is very prominent. » He suggests that Morris’s choice of the role of craftsman as the ideal occupation is clearly aimed at detaching man from sophisticated, superfluous habits while providing him with the ability to autonomously satisfy his primary needs. Not only does the land cover a wide range of demands with its spontaneous wealth, it has also been extensively explored and carved with human tools. By arguing that «Morris’s aesthetic response is not escape, but a kind of writing often mistaken for escape literature – the pastoral,» Blue Calhoun has analysed man’s pleasure in the enjoyment of natural environment, a paradigm traditionally ascribed to the genre of pastoral. He has demonstrated how the Victorian writers contributed to the nineteenth-century development of the genre by thematizing the dichotomy between the praise of country life and the disruptive power of industrialization. Influenced by the Victorian pastoral, where a dialectical confrontation is established between the natural rhythms and the frantic times imposed by the industrial process, in Nowhere Morris offers an integrated view of Nature and human architecture. In his utopian view, whenever man has cleverly employed the raw materials of the earth and worked them into comfortable dwelling places, his intervention has produced a strong impact which has enhanced rather than wasted the Beauty of the land. In Man acts as a creator, a craftsman whose central role is to design his living space according to a utopian project that requires his active participation rather than a passive enjoyment of natural resources...|$|E

Another takkanah was afterward issued which practically amounted to a confiscation, for the benefit of the halukkah, of the chattels, money, and accounts of a deceased Jew who left no resident heirs. There were many evasions, and in several instances the well-to-do, before taking up their residence in the Holy Land, stipulated a certain sum which was to be paid to the community upon their death in <b>place</b> <b>of</b> the <b>fulfilment</b> <b>of</b> the decree. This so-called [...] "inheritance tax" [...] was strenuously opposed by the richer classes, and it was spasmodically abolished and reenacted. The income from this tax, however, never amounted to one-third of the halukkah, and to supply the deficiency there was no alternative but to resort to the meshulachim, who as a result became so numerous, and such frequent visitors in the European congregations, that they were regarded as wandering tramps, a nuisance and a reproach.|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} the employment contract of low and unskilled workers in the underground coal mining industry in South Africa and aims to link the concepts of psychological contract, blue-collar workers, race and gender diversity. Due to the recent economic crisis, mining companies are under pressure to increase productivity and reduce cost. It is therefore important for mining companies to understand and manage the employment contract of blue-collar workers {{in order to improve}} labour productivity and effectiveness. Quantitative research was conducted among 179 low and unskilled workers in a major coal mining company by means of a modified Psycones psychological contract questionnaire. The following key results were obtained: • Employer obligations in the psychological contract for blue-collar workers in the underground coal mining industry are not fully met; • Significant differences were found in the level <b>of</b> <b>fulfilment</b> <b>of</b> the psychological contract of Black males, Females and White males. The level <b>of</b> <b>fulfilment</b> for Black males is significantly lower than White males. Females have the highest level of employer obligation expectations. • The level <b>of</b> <b>fulfilment</b> <b>of</b> the psychological contract decreases with length of tenure.
