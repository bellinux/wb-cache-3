50|$|Historically, {{photometry}} in the near-infrared through short-wavelength ultra-violet {{was done}} with a photoelectric photometer, an instrument that measured the light intensity of a single object by directing its light onto a <b>photosensitive</b> <b>cell.</b> These have largely been replaced with CCD cameras that can simultaneously image multiple objects, although photoelectric photometers are still used in special situations, such as where fine time resolution is required.|$|E
50|$|On {{the other}} side of the lens is the second humour, the aqueous humour, which is bounded on all sides by the lens, the ciliary body, {{suspensory}} ligaments and by the retina.

50|$|After the <b>photosensitive</b> <b>cell</b> region invaginated, {{there came}} a point when {{reducing}} {{the width of the}} light opening became more efficient at increasing visual resolution than continued deepening of the cup.

VPG is the most common way to assess vaginal blood flow and is widely used to measure genital sexual arousal in women. However, debate has arisen as to how reliable the technique is.

50|$|Owls {{have very}} large eyes for their size, 2.2 {{times greater than}} the average for birds of the same weight, and {{positioned}} {{at the front of the}} head. The eyes have a field overlap of 50-70%, giving better binocular vision than for diurnal birds of prey (overlap 30-50%). The tawny owl's retina has about 56,000 light-sensitive rods per square millimetre (36 million per square inch); although earlier claims that it could see in the infrared part of the spectrum have been dismissed.Adaptations to night vision include the large size of the eye, its tubular shape, large numbers of closely packed retinal rods, and an absence of cones, since cone cells are not sensitive enough for a low-photon nighttime environment.

50|$|In many ways, {{vision is}} the primary human sense. Light is taken in through each eye and focused {{in a way which}} sorts it on the retina {{according}} to direction of origin. A dense surface of <b>photosensitive</b> <b>cells,</b> including rods, cones, and intrinsically <b>photosensitive</b> retinal ganglion <b>cells</b> captures information about the intensity, color, and position of incoming light. Some processing of texture and movement occurs within the neurons on the retina before the information is sent to the brain.

50|$|Light {{entering}} the eye strikes three different photoreceptors in the retina: the familiar rods and cones used in image forming {{and the more}} newly discovered <b>photosensitive</b> ganglion <b>cells.</b> The ganglion cells give information about ambient light levels, and react sluggishly compared to the rods and cones.

40|$|Mammalian vision {{consists}} of the classic image-forming pathway involving rod and cone photoreceptors interacting through a neural network within the retina before sending signals to the brain, and a non image-forming pathway that uses a <b>photosensitive</b> <b>cell</b> employing an alternative and evolutionary ancient phototransduction system and a direct connection to various centers in the brain. Intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) contain the photopigment melanopsin, which is independently capable of photon detection while also receiving synaptic input from rod and cone photoreceptors via bipolar cells. These cells are the retinal sentry for subconscious visual processing that controls circadian photoentrainment and the pupillary light reflex.

40|$|Abstract. The main {{causes of}} {{uncertainty}} in measurement regarding long-stroke line scales are line detection errors and external factors, especially temperature effects. The number of calibration errors {{of this sort}} increases with the extension of calibration time. Therefore, a dynamic method of line scale detection for modern long-stroke line scale comparators is used [1, 2, 3]. The article discusses the dynamic method of line scale detection {{by means of an}} optical microscope equipped with a <b>photosensitive</b> <b>cell</b> matrix and a line scale detection algorithm. Advantages of the dynamic method of scale calibration in terms of rate, accuracy and throughput are presented. The method’s error (detection parameters) correlations with detection rate, number of nominal lines, measuring rate, exposition delay are analyzed and mathematical models are described. The optimal values of these parameters are estimated. We are particularly interested in the improvement of the dynamic calibration program algorithm and minimization of uncertainty in measurement.

40|$|Chlorophyll {{production}} {{involves the}} synthesis of photoreactive intermediates that, when in excess, are toxic due {{to the production of}} reactive oxygen species (ROS). A novel, activation-tagged barley (Hordeum vulgare) mutant is described that results from antisense suppression of a uroporphyrinogen III synthase (Uros) gene, the product of which catalyzes the sixth step in {{the synthesis of}} chlorophyll and heme. In homozygous mutant plants, uroporphyrin(ogen) I accumulates by spontaneous cyclization of hydroxyl methylbilane, the substrate of Uros. Accumulation of this tetrapyrrole intermediate results in <b>photosensitive</b> <b>cell</b> death due to the production of ROS. The efficiency of Uros gene suppression is developmentally regulated, being most effective in mature seedling leaves compared with newly emergent leaves. Reduced transcript accumulation of a number of nuclear-encoded photosynthesis genes occurs in the mutant, even under 3 % light conditions, consistent with a retrograde plastid-nuclear signaling mechanism arising from Uros gene suppression. A similar set of nuclear genes was repressed in wild-type barley following treatment with a singlet oxygen-generating herbicide, but not by a superoxide generating herbicide, suggesting that the retrograde signaling apparent in the mutant is specific to singlet oxygen...|$|E
40|$|Laser {{detection}} and ranging (LADAR) systems {{are commonly used}} to acquire real-time three-dimensional (3 D) images using the time-of-flight of a short laser pulse. A static unitary detector (STUD) -based LADAR system is a simple method for obtaining real-time high-resolution 3 D images. In this study, a switched 4 -to- 1 transimpedance combining amplifier (TCA) is implemented as a receiver front-end readout integrated circuit for the STUD-based LADAR system. The 4 -to- 1 TCA is fabricated using a standard 0. 18 μm complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology, and it consists of four independent current buffers, a two-stage signal combiner, a balun, and an output buffer in one single integrated chip. In addition, there is a switch on each input current path to expand the region of interest with multiple photodetectors. The core of the TCA occupies an area of 92 μm × 68 μm, and the die size including I/O pads is 1000 μm × 840 μm. The power consumption of the fabricated chip is 17. 8 mW for a supplied voltage of 1. 8 V and a transimpedance gain of 67. 5 dBΩ.

30|$|An {{overview}} of the stimulus configurations used in experiments, conducted {{in the order of}} listing, is depicted in Table  1. Displays consisted of square shaped OpenGL points of two point sizes subtending either 0.4  deg or 0.2  deg of visual angle depending on the experiment. As determined in pretests, the seal was able to detect points of the respective sizes and luminance. The mean luminance of the dots as measured on the projection screen in the empty pool with a luminance meter (Konica-Minolta LS 110) was between 70  cd/m 2 and 100  cd/m 2 depending on dot size. The speed of the dots was almost the same in all experiments. However, since we worked with a plane screen and large display areas subtending up to 80  deg of the horizontal visual field in some experiments the speed of the local motion signals varied between 5  deg/s and 10  deg/s depending on their position in the visual field of the animal. The self-written program computed and stored the actual rate at which the frames were rendered by the graphic hardware for adjusting the timing of the stimuli to the frame rate. Correct timing of the displays was confirmed by a <b>photosensitive</b> <b>cell</b> measuring the lifetime of individual dots. Depending on experiment, dot density was varied from 100 to 1000 dots per stimulus display area corresponding to dot densities of 0.15 dots/deg 2 to 1.54 dots/deg 2, and dot lifetime was set to 125  ms, 250  ms, 500  ms or 1000  ms.|$|E

40|$|Melanopsin is a <b>photosensitive</b> <b>cell</b> protein {{involved}} in regulating circadian rhythms and other non-visual responses to light. The melanopsin gene family {{is represented by}} two paralogs, OPN 4 x and OPN 4 m, which originated through gene duplication early {{in the emergence of}} vertebrates. Here we studied the melanopsin gene family using an integrated gene/protein evolutionary approach, which revealed that the rhabdomeric urbilaterian ancestor had the same amino acid patterns (DRY motif and the Y and E conterions) as extant vertebrate species, suggesting that the mechanism for light detection and regulation is similar to rhabdomeric rhodopsins. Both OPN 4 m and OPN 4 x paralogs are found in vertebrate genomic paralogons, suggesting that they diverged following this duplication event about 600 million years ago, when the complex eye emerged in the vertebrate ancestor. Melanopsins generally evolved under negative selection (v = 0. 171) with some minor episodes of positive selection (proportion of sites = 25 %) and functional divergence (hI = 0. 349 and hII = 0. 126). The OPN 4 m and OPN 4 x melanopsin paralogs show evidence of spectral divergence at sites likely {{involved in}} melanopsin light absorbance (200 F, 273 S and 276 A). Also, following the teleost lineage-specific whole genome duplication (3 R) that prompted the teleost fish radiation, type I divergence (hI = 0. 181) and positive selection (affecting 11 % of sites) contributed to amino acid variability that we related with the photo-activation stability of melanopsin.

40|$|In {{the present}} thesis I {{have worked with}} {{particle}} dispersion in water {{as well as in}} liquid crystal. As the first study of this thesis, I have studied the aggregation of isotropic (spherical) and elongated anisometric (pear-shaped) colloidal particles in aqueous medium, confined in two dimensions when subjected to perpendicular external alternating current (AC) electric fields. For low frequencies (f < 2. 5 kHz) the electrohydrodynamic flow is predominant, and particles tend to aggregate in clusters. On the contrary, for higher frequencies the repulsive dipolar interaction dominates, and particles disperse. Although both types of particles feature a similar behavior under AC field, pear-shaped particles present a richer phase diagram, that is, they have more phases than the spherical ones. I have also found that pear-shaped particles tend to form smaller and more elongated aggregates, with faster aggregation kinetics. I have also tested different ways to measure the strength of the colloidal aggregates using magnetic probes. The following studies of this thesis focus on colloidal dispersions in liquid crystals, which are widely used nowadays to clarify new fundamental concepts and original applications. (1 – 5) Nematic liquid crystals (NLC) are anisotropic organic fluids whose molecules exhibit the positional disorder of a liquid, but are aligned in a certain direction (called the director of the NLC) (6, 7). The director field is usually controlled by certain boundary conditions imposed on the plates of the experimental cell. As a novel way to determine the director orientation, I have demonstrated that paramagnetic anisometric inclusions can be used to locally control the in-plane orientation of the director field by means of external weak magnetic fields. To better understand the phenomenon I have also developed a theoretical model based on the free energy density of the NLC. Additionally, I have found that, by rotating the paramagnetic inclusions more than 100 º from their initial orientation, a target pattern of dark and light alternated circles appear. This phenomenon is also captured by the model proposed. In the third phase of this project, I have investigated the controlled motion of micrometer inclusions dispersed in a nematic liquid crystal, propelled by an alternating current (AC) electric field. Recently it has been reported in the literature that micrometric particles can be propelled in NLC by using AC fields, provided that these particles break the symmetry of the NLC director around them. The mechanism explaining this propulsion is called Liquid Crystal-Enabled Electrophoresis (LCEEP) (3). By taking advantage of this mechanism, I have demonstrated that aqueous microdroplets are also propelled by LCEEP. One can make these droplets transport solid polystyrene microparticles, or perform a chemical reaction by coalescing two microdroplets containing separate reactants. In addition, I have also demonstrated the control of the activation or deactivation of LCEEP by using photosensitive particles, which change the NLC director symmetry around them upon UV-visible irradiation. In the last part of this thesis I have developed a novel technique to separately control particle driving from steering under LCEEP. Using photo-induced patterns, I assemble and dynamically control ensembles of particles in a NLC medium. These swarms are assembled, transported and dynamically addressed by local irradiation of the <b>photosensitive</b> <b>cell</b> plate with UV light. With this technique I have demonstrated different potential applications: from the formation and reconfiguration of lattices composed of particle swarms, to segregation of particles with different sizes, as well as the storage and subsequent release of a swarm inside physical constraints, or the formation of particle jets. All these phenomena unveil novel possibilities in the field of collective transport of driven inclusions. References: (1) 	Koenig, G. M.; Lin, I. -H.; Abbott, N. L.

Durant aquesta tesi, he treballat amb dispersions de partícules en l'aigua, així com també amb dispersions en cristall líquid nemàtic (NLC). Com a primer estudi d'aquesta tesi, he investigat la influència de camps elèctrics en dispersions col·loïdals de partícules sòlides en un medi aquós. He estudiat l'agregació de partícules col·loïdals isotròpiques (esfèriques) i anisomètriques allargades (amb forma de pera) en un medi aquós confinat en dues dimensions, quan se sotmet a un camp elèctric de corrent alterna (AC) perpendicular a la superfície de confinament. En un segon estudi he demostrat que es poden utilitzar inclusions anisomètriques paramagnètiques per controlar localment l'orientació d’un NLC, per mitjà de camps magnètics febles. Per entendre millor el fenomen també he desenvolupat un model teòric basat en la densitat d'energia lliure del NLC. A més, he estat capaç de generar patrons complexos, que també s’expliquen amb model proposat. En la tercera fase d'aquest projecte, he investigat el moviment controlat d'inclusions micromètriques disperses en NLC, impulsades per un corrent altern (AC) a traves d’un mecanisme anomenat “electroforesi habilitada per cristall líquid” (LCEEP). He demostrat que microgotes aquoses es poden propulsar per LCEEP. Es pot fer que aquestes microgotes transportin micropartícules sòlides de poliestirè, o dur a terme una reacció química mitjançant la coalescència de dos microgotes que contenen reactius separats. A més, també he demostrat el control de l'activació o desactivació de la LCEEP mitjançant l'ús de partícules fotosensibles, en funció de la irradiació UV-visible. En l'última part d’aquesta tesi he desenvolupat una nova tècnica per a controlar separadament la propulsió i la direcció de moviment de les partícules transportades per LCEEP. Mitjançant l’ús de patrons fotoinduïts, es poden formar i controlar dinàmicament conjunts de partícules en un medi de NLC. Aquests eixams es formen, es transporten i es dirigeixen dinàmicament per irradiació local amb llum UV. Amb aquesta tècnica he pogut demostrat diferents aplicacions potencials: des de la formació i reconfiguració de xarxes cristal·lines compostes d'eixams de partícules, a la segregació de partícules de diferents mides, així com l'emmagatzematge i posterior alliberament d'un eixam dins d’un canal micromètric, o la formació de jets de partícules.
