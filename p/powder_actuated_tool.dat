40|$|Graduation date: 1966 The {{purpose of}} this work was to design a system for {{measuring}} the velocity of a powder actuated fastener or drivepin during penetration. This system would provide a tool for further investigation into drivepin penetration characteristics. The main characteristic of interest is the instantaneous acceleration from which the forces on the drivepin can be determined. This acceleration was determined by designing a transducer whose output is drivepin position versus time and calculating the instantaneous velocity and acceleration, graphically and numerically, from these data. A powder actuated drivepin is a special nail-like pin which is driven into hard materials {{by the force of}} a charge of gunpowder. The <b>powder</b> <b>actuated</b> <b>tool</b> is similar to a pistol except the projectile is the drivepin and the charge is in a separate brass jacket. The penetration velocity previously referred to is the velocity spectrum during the total time the drivepin is in motion. Some of the transducers that were considered are listed with comments which affected their evaluation. Among these transducers, the linear resistance potentiometer was selected for this measuring system. It has the following characteristics: a. Simplicity b. High frequency response c. Good linearity d. Marginal mechanical strength e. Low, but sufficient output With this potentiometric transducer, an oscilloscope and camera were added to provide a time base and a permanent record. The test results or data are recorded as photographs of the oscilloscope trace. Various techniques for differentiating these data are discussed. These techniques include graphical, approximating polynomials by the method of finite differences, and best fitting curve by the method of least squares. Additional mathematical presentations are included to show the measuring system's linearity and frequency response and the equations of motion of the <b>powder</b> <b>actuated</b> <b>tool</b> and piston. The final configuration of the measuring system is a battery energized slide wire mounted inside a barrel and a collector mounted opposite the slide wire. The head of the drivepin contacts the slide wire during penetration and transfers this voltage to the collector. The collector voltage is fed into an oscilloscope for display as a function of time. The external trigger signal for starting the display is obtained from the first motion of drivepin as it passes through a metal foil {{on the surface of the}} material to be penetrated. This potentiometric measuring system was found to be adequate for the purpose intended. However, some mechanical modifications are recommended...|$|E

5000|$|Powder-actuated tools come {{in either}} high {{velocity}} or low velocity types. In high velocity tools the propellant charge acts {{directly on the}} fastener.

(The piston is analogous to the bolt of a captive bolt pistol.) A powder-actuated tool is considered to be low velocity if the average test velocity of the fastener does not exceed 492 ft/s. High velocity tools may not be made or sold in the United States, however some made decades ago are still in use in shipbuilding and steel industries.

The ANSI / AISC 341 - 10 Seismic Provisions for Structural Steel Buildings define {{the ends of}} the beams in a SMRF as protected zones at the locations where large inelastic strains are expected. In the protected zone, AISC 341 - 10 prohibits any decking attachments that penetrate the beam flange and any welded, bolted, screwed, or shot-in attachments for other purposes. However, these restrictions are based primarily on a lack of data showing that such fasteners will not cause premature low cycle fatigue fracture in the moment connection.

40|$|Abstract — Magnetically <b>actuated</b> <b>tools</b> (MATs) that utilize {{rotating}} {{magnetic fields}} for propulsion, such as active capsule endoscopes and magnetic microrobots, have typically been controlled using either arrangements of electromagnets or permanent-magnet systems operated in limited configurations. It was recently {{shown that a}} rotating magnetic field for MAT actuation can be generated using a single rotating permanent magnet (RPM) from any position in space with a unique axis of rotation. The method has potential benefits for clinical systems, but it requires knowledge of the MAT position {{with respect to the}} RPM. In any application, MAT localization will be subject to uncertainty caused by sensor noise, slow update rates, and/or localization failure. In this paper, we develop and experimentally verify worst-case bounds on properties of the rotating dipole field, given a worst-case bound on localization error, which can be used to design operating procedures that mitigate undesired MAT behavior in the presence of known localization uncertainty. The results are important for the robust operation of rotating MATs actuated using a single rotating permanent magnet in a clinical setting. I...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Untethered {{magnetic}} devices, such as magnetic microrobots and magnetically actuated capsule endoscopes, {{stand to}} significantly impact {{the field of}} minimally invasive medicine. These devices, which we refer to as magnetically <b>actuated</b> <b>tools</b> (MATs), are often controlled using electromag-nets, which can be expensive to scale clinically. Due to their potential for low-cost and high strength, permanent magnets are being considered for MAT actuation. Great {{care must be taken}} for in vivo medical applications, however, as systems using single permanent magnets typically generate an attractive force, which may cause trauma if uncontrolled. In this paper, we present techniques for managing the attractive magnetic force. We find {{that in the case of}} rotating MATs actuated using a single rotating permanent magnet (RPM), for which magnetic torque is the primary form of actuation, the attractive magnetic force can be substantially reduced in magnitude and the time-averaged attractive component eliminated when operating the MAT such that magnetic torque is maximized. We provide experimental demonstration that validates and illustrates the force management strategies presented. I...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — It {{has been}} shown that when a {{magnetic}} dipole, such as a permanent magnet, is rotated around a fixed axis such that the dipole is perpendicular to the axis of rotation, the magnetic field vector at every point in space also rotates around a fixed axis. In this paper, we reformulate this phenomenon using linear algebraic techniques, which enables us to find the necessary dipole rotation axis to make the magnetic field at any desired point in space rotate about any desired axis. To date, untethered magnetically <b>actuated</b> <b>tools</b> (e. g., capsule en-doscopes, rolling spheres, and helical-propeller microswimmers) controlled with a single rotating permanent magnet have been constrained to operate in positions where the rotating field behavior is simple and easy to visualize. We experimentally demonstrate that the results of this paper can be used to control a variety of untethered, rotating magnetic devices in any position even while the rotating permanent magnet follows trajectories independent of the devices themselves. This method constitutes a substantial step toward making a great deal of prior laboratory research regarding rotating magnetic microrobots and capsule endoscopes clinically feasible. I...|$|R

40|$|The work {{presented}} here addressed {{the development of}} an electro-mechanical force-feedback device to provide more realistic and complete sensations to a laparoscopic surgery simulator than currently available. A survey of the issues surrounding haptic (touch) displays and training for laparoscopic or "keyhole" procedures was performed. A number of primary and secondary sources including surgeon consultation, operating room observations, and task analyses were used to accumulate a list of needs. Subsequent requirements analysis translated these into a set of specifications for the kinematics, dynamics and actuators, and configuration of the device. These suggested a design with five actuated axes (pitch and yaw about the entrance to the abdomen, insertion, rotation about the tool axis, and gripper feedback) amenable to a configuration including two <b>actuated</b> <b>tools</b> in a lifelike torso. These specifications were the basis for the generation and selection of design concepts. The PHANTOM haptic interface from Sensable Devices was chosen from among a number of existing devices and original designs to actuate the pitch, yaw, and insertion degrees of freedom. A separate end effector actuator was specified to supply feedback to the handle rotation and gripper. Mechanisms were proposed for each of these axes; a linear cable capstan was selected for the gripper and a cable capstan/drum for the rotation. The kinematics, bearings, transmissions, and user interface for both axes were designed in detail, and first- and second generation prototypes were built.

40|$|The main {{contribution}} {{of this paper}} is the development of a linearized model for describing the dynamic hysteresis behaviors of piezoelectrically <b>actuated</b> fast <b>tool</b> servo (FTS). A linearized hysteresis force model is proposed and mathematically described by a fractional order differential equation. Combining the dynamic modeling of the FTS mechanism, a linearized fractional order dynamic hysteresis (LFDH) model for the piezoelectrically actuated FTS is established. The unique features of the LFDH model could be summarized as follows: (a) It could well describe the rate-dependent hysteresis due to its intrinsic characteristics of frequency-dependent nonlinear phase shifts and amplitude modulations; (b) The linearization scheme of the LFDH model would make it easier to implement the inverse dynamic control on piezoelectrically actuated micro-systems. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed model, a series of experiments are conducted. The toolpaths of the FTS for creating two typical micro-functional surfaces involving various harmonic components with different frequencies and amplitudes are scaled and employed as command signals for the piezoelectric actuator. The modeling errors in the steady state are less than &# 177; 2. 5 % within the full span range which is much smaller than certain state-of-the-art modeling methods, demonstrating the efficiency and superiority of the proposed model for modeling dynamic hysteresis effects. Moreover, it indicates that the piezoelectrically actuated micro systems would be more suitably described as a fractional order dynamic system...|$|R

40|$|A new {{technique}} for strengthening reinforced concrete (RC) slabs using FRP composites is investigated. It {{is referred to}} as the mechanically fastened (MF) technique, which is based on fixing FRP materials to concrete using closely spaced powder-actuated fasteners. A special FRP material, known by the trade name SAFSTRIP ª, is used in this method. It is characterized by a high bearing strength as well as a high tensile strength. This {{new technique}} is very rapid compared to the conventional bonded FRP techniques. Furthermore, it allows for immediate use of the structure after completion of the installation process. In addition, unlike the bonded system, the use of the MF system results in a desirable ductile behaviour of the strengthened structure. The commonly used fasteners in this technique are embedded into the concrete using a <b>powder</b> <b>actuated</b> fastening"gun". The shot of this fastener is very strong and may sometimes cause initial cracking or concrete spalling or may locally damage the FRP if the fastener is overdriven. To overcome these problems we have proposed a new fastener based on screwing rather than shooting the fastener into the concrete. This screwed fastener has a better anchorage into the concrete, and displays a much better performance. This study attempts to investigate the behaviour of RC slabs strengthened in flexure with the mechanically fastened FRP system. Two series of large-scale reinforced concrete slabs are tested. The first series is comprised of five slabs without a cut-out, and measuring 2600 x 2600 x 120 mm; the second series consists of four slabs of the same dimensions with a central cut-out measuring 800 x 800 mm. In each series, one slab is left unstrengthened to serve as a reference while FRP strips are used to strengthen the remaining slabs. Different strengthening patterns are used with different spacings between fasteners. Also, the conventionally bonded strengthening technique is used for the sake of comparison. The mechanically fastened system is found to be an interesting alternative to the bonded system resulting in a rapid, economic, and effective system. The gained increases in ultimate capacities of the MF FRP-strengthened slabs range between 30 to 70 % over those of the unstrengthened specimens. Moreover, the use of the MF system shows a desirable pseudo-ductile mode of failure. As a complementary study, experimental results from 27 direct shear tests on FRP strips mechanically fastened to concrete blocks are reported. Based on the results from these tests, new analytical models that describe the interfacial behaviour between the MF FRP and concrete substrate are developed. These models are referred to as"bearing-slip" models. Finite element models are then introduced to address the interfacial behaviour between the FRP strips and the concrete substrate for the MF FRP/concrete direct shear specimens. Results are presented in terms of ultimate load capacities and load-slip relationships. The numerical predictions are verified against the experimental data, and very good agreement is obtained. Based on this verification, the proposed bearing-slip models are subsequently used in finite element analyses to simulate the cases of RC beams and slabs strengthened with the MF system. Also, the theoretical part of this study is extended to include finite element modelling of bonded FRP-strengthened slabs. The interfacial behaviour between the FRPs and the concrete substrate is accounted for by using appropriate interfacial models. It is shown that the numerical models can be applied to arbitrary FRP configurations, and can also accommodate both passive as well as prestressed FRP strengthening schemes. Results are presented in terms of load-deflection relationships, ultimate load capacities, failure modes, and interfacial slip and stress distributions. When compared to test results reported in the literature, the analysis is shown to lead to very good predictions...|$|R

40|$|As {{part of the}} NASA Exploration Technology Development Program, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory is {{developing}} a vehicle called ATHLETE: the All-Terrain Hex-Limbed Extra-Terrestrial Explorer. Each vehicle is based on six wheels {{at the ends of}} six multi-degree-of freedom limbs. Because each limb has enough degrees of freedom for use as a general-purpose leg, the wheels can be locked and used as feet to walk out of excessively soft or other extreme terrain. Since the vehicle has this alternative mode of traversing through or at least out of extreme terrain, the wheels and wheel actuators can be sized for nominal terrain. There are substantial mass savings in the wheel and wheel actuators associated with designing for nominal instead of extreme terrain. These mass savings are at least comparable-to or larger-than the extra mass associated with the articulated limbs. As a result, the entire mobility system, including wheels and limbs, can be lighter than a conventional all-terrain mobility chassis. A side benefit of this approach is that each limb has sufficient degrees-of freedom {{to be used as a}} general-purpose manipulator (hence the name "limb" instead of "leg"). Our prototype ATHLETE vehicles have quick-disconnect tool adapters on the limbs that allow tools to be drawn out of a "tool belt" and maneuvered by the limb. A power-take-off from the wheel <b>actuates</b> the <b>tools,</b> so that they can take advantage of the 1 + horsepower motor in each wheel to enable drilling, gripping or other power-tool functions...|$|R
