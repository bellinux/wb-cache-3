5|$|Some {{authors have}} {{suggested}} that the specimen was either a runt of either the yellow-breasted fruit dove or a Treron pigeon, or a hybrid instead of a unique species; however, these views are generally considered invalid {{due in part to the}} distinctiveness of the specimen, particularly in the bare skin around the eye, and no <b>proper</b> <b>evidence</b> has suggested that the Negros fruit dove is an invalid species. It is uncertain where the dove should be placed within the genus Ptilinopus as the male's plumage, a key feature used in organizing the Ptilinopus doves, is unknown. It has been suggested that the Negros fruit dove is either most closely related to the black-naped fruit dove or represents an early colonization of the Philippines by the genus that has left no surviving close relatives. It has no known subspecies and is also known as Ripley's fruit dove.|$|E
2500|$|These {{effects of}} the urban forest on ozone {{production}} have only recently been discovered by the scientific community, so extensive and conclusive research {{has not yet been}} conducted. [...] There have been some studies quantifying the effect of BVOC emissions on the formation of ozone, but none have conclusively measured the effect of the urban forest. Important questions remain unanswered. For instance, it is unknown if there are enough chemical reactions between BVOC emissions and NOx to produce harmful amounts of ozone in urban environments. It is therefore, important for cities to be aware that this research is still continuing and conclusions should not be drawn before <b>proper</b> <b>evidence</b> has been collected.

2500|$|Some sources {{state that}} Abel was ordained by Joseph Smith, while other records {{indicate}} that he was ordained to the priesthood by Zebedee Coltrin. Despite the incongruity of the sources, Abel's ordination to the Seventy was performed by Coltrin. In his own words Coltrin recounts [...] "I said I never would again Annoint another person who had Negro blood in him. [...] unless I was commanded by the Prophet to do so." [...] It is apparent that Coltrin acted voluntarily, but did so with another motive than to solely have him anointed. Coltrin made the claim that Abel had been ordained to the Seventy {{in exchange for his}} work on the Nauvoo Temple, but that later Joseph Smith had [...] "dropped" [...] Abel from the Quorum. John Taylor stated that Abel had been given the priesthood, but that it had later been removed. [...] Furthermore, another version of this encounter states that Joseph declared blacks could be baptized, but not have the priesthood. Neither version has <b>proper</b> <b>evidence</b> supporting it. In the end, the meeting of 1879 was not directly about Abel and his holding the priesthood, but resulted in the reaffirmation of the policy banning blacks from having the priesthood.|$|E

2500|$|The case {{failed because}} of lack of <b>proper</b> <b>evidence</b> thanks to Jatin's policy of a loose decentralised {{organisation}} federating scores of regional units, as observed by F.C. Daly more than once: [...] "The gang is a heterogeneous one, with several advisers and petty chiefs... From information we have on record we may divide the gang into four parts: (1) Gurus, (2) Influential supporters, (3) Leaders, (4) Members." [...] J.C. Nixon's report is more explicit : [...] "Although a separate name and a separate individuality have been given to these various parties in this account of them, and although such a distinction was probably observed amongst the minor members, it is very clear that the bigger figures were in close communication with one another and were frequently accepted members of two or more of these samitis. It may be taken that at some time these various parties were engaged in anarchical crime independently, although in their revolutionary aims and usually in their origins they were all very closely related." [...] Several observers pinpointed Jatin so accurately that the newly appointed Viceroy Lord Hardinge wrote more explicitly to Earl Crewe (H.M.'s Secretary of State for India): [...] "As regards prosecution, I (...) deprecate the net being thrown so wide; as for example in the Howrah Gang Case, where 47 persons are being prosecuted, of whom only one is, I believe, the real criminal. If a concentrated effort had been made to convict this one criminal, I think it would have had a better effect than the prosecution of 46 misguided youths." [...] On 28 May 1911, Hardinge recognised : [...] "The 10th Jats case was {{part and parcel of the}} Howrah Gang Case; and with the failure in the latter, the Government of Bengal realised the futility of proceeding with the former... In fact, nothing could be worse, in my opinion, than the condition of Bengal and Eastern Bengal. There is practically no Government in either province..." ...|$|E

60|$|In {{the event}} of these tales ever finding {{their way across the}} Border, it may be proper to apprise the {{southern}} reader that it is the practice in Scotland, on apprehending a suspected person, to subject him to a judicial examination before a magistrate. He is not compelled to answer any of the questions asked of him, but may remain silent if he sees it his interest to do so. But whatever answers he chooses to give are formally written down, and being subscribed by himself and the magistrate, are produced against the accused in case of his being brought to trial. It is true, that these declarations are not produced as being in themselves evidence properly so called, but only as adminicles of testimony, tending to corroborate what is considered as legal and <b>proper</b> <b>evidence.</b> Notwithstanding this nice distinction, however, introduced by lawyers to reconcile this procedure to their own general rule, that a man cannot be required to bear witness against himself, it nevertheless usually happens that these declarations become the means of condemning the accused, as it were, out of their own mouths. The prisoner, upon these previous examinations, has indeed the privilege of remaining silent if he pleases; but every man necessarily feels that a refusal to answer natural and pertinent interrogatories, put by judicial authority, is in itself a strong proof of guilt, and will certainly lead to his being committed to prison; and few can renounce the hope of obtaining liberty by giving some specious account of themselves, and showing apparent frankness in explaining their motives and accounting for their conduct. It, therefore, seldom happens that the prisoner refuses to give a judicial declaration, in which, nevertheless, either by letting out too much of the truth, or by endeavouring to substitute a fictitious story, he almost always exposes himself to suspicion and to contradictions, which weigh heavily {{in the minds of the}} jury.|$|E
