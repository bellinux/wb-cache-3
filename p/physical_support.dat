5|$|Home Health Aide: The home health, or hospice, aide {{is not a}} {{core service}} for a hospice patient; this means it is not {{required}} that every patient on hospice receive an aide. However, most patients do receive this service, and it is often the one most depended on by the patient and family. The hospice aide typically visits anywhere from 3–7 {{days a week for}} approximately 1–2 hours at each visit. His or her functions include providing respite to the primary caregiver and <b>physical</b> <b>support</b> to the patient, including bathing, dressing, or feeding. Many times it is the hospice aide who develops the closest relationship with the patient, due to the frequency of visits. The hospice aide is not a licensed nurse and therefore can not administer medications, treat wounds, handle IV's or similar treatments.|$|E
5|$|Newborns {{have black}} natal coats and bright pink skin. Females {{are the primary}} {{caregivers}} of infants, but males also play a role. In its first few days, the infant {{may be unable to}} stay attached to its mother and relies on her for <b>physical</b> <b>support.</b> However, its grasp grows stronger by its first week and it is able to cling to its mother's fur by itself. By two weeks, the infant begins to explore its surroundings for short periods, but stays near her. The distance the infant spends away from its mother increases the older it gets. In general, higher-ranking females are usually more relaxed parents than females of lower rank, which usually keep their offspring close to them. However, this difference only lasts for approximately the first eight weeks of an infant's life. Olive baboons do not seem to practice co-operative parenting, but a female may groom an infant that is not hers. Subadult and juvenile females are more likely to care for another's young, as they have not yet produced offspring of their own. One theory for why immature females tend to seek out infants is that they can prepare for their future roles as mothers. Infant baboons born to first-time mothers suffer higher mortality than those born to experienced mothers, which suggests that prior experience in caring for infants is important. Adult males in the groups also care for the infants, as {{they are likely to be}} related to them. Males groom infants, reducing the amount of parasites they may have, and calm them when they are stressed. They may also protect them from predators, such as chimpanzees. However, adult males exploit infants and use them to reduce the likelihood that other males will threaten them.|$|E
40|$|IntroductionActive {{commuting}} {{is associated}} with a reduced risk of several chronic diseases, but few studies have considered institutional factors that influence it. We examined the association between cultural and <b>physical</b> workplace <b>supports</b> for active commuting and employee active commuting behavior. MethodsData were collected from employees (N = 375) in Manhattan, Kansas, via an online survey. <b>Physical</b> and cultural <b>supports</b> for active commuting in the workplace were measured separately. Active commuting frequency was dichotomized as 0 trips versus at least 1 trip per week by foot or bicycle. Binomial logistic regression was used to predict the likelihood of commuting actively at least once per week, according to the number and type of cultural and <b>physical</b> workplace <b>supports.</b> Analyses were conducted by sex and age and for the full sample. ResultsAmong the full sample, employees who reported more <b>physical</b> and cultural <b>supports</b> in the workplace for active commuting were more likely to walk or bicycle to work at least once per week. Significant, positive relationships between cultural and <b>physical</b> <b>supports</b> and active commuting were observed for women but not for men. Both younger and older adults who reported 2 or more <b>physical</b> <b>supports</b> in the workplace were more likely to actively commute, but no relationship was observed for cultural supports. The most influential types of individual supports were perceiving that other coworkers actively commute and the presence of bicycle parking and a bicycle storage policy at the workplace. ConclusionThe presence of workplace <b>physical</b> and cultural <b>supports</b> is related to more active commuting behavior and may especially encourage active commuting among women...|$|R

25|$|Glial {{cells are}} {{necessary}} for supporting the growth and maintenance of neurons in the peripheral and central nervous system. Most glial cells are specific to either the peripheral or central nervous system. Schwann cells {{are located in the}} peripheral nervous system where they myelinate the axons of neurons.

25|$|Successful {{therapeutic}} {{relationships between}} nurses and patients {{need to have}} positive support. Different methods of providing patients with support include many active responses. Minor activities such as shopping, reading the newspaper together, or taking lunch/dinner breaks with patients can {{improve the quality of}} support provided. <b>Physical</b> <b>support</b> may also be used and is manifested through the use of touch. Patients described feelings of connection when the psychiatric nurses hugged them or put a hand on their shoulder. Psychiatric/mental health nurses in Berg and Hallberg's study described an element of a working relationship as comforting through holding a patient's hand. Patients with depression described relief when the psychiatric nurse embraced them. Physical touch is intended to comfort and console patients who are willing to embrace these sensations and share mutual feelings with the psychiatric nurses.|$|E
2500|$|A {{meta-analysis}} (2011) of the bystander effect {{reported that}} [...] "The bystander effect was attenuated when situations {{were perceived as}} dangerous (compared with non-dangerous), perpetrators were present (compared with non-present), {{and the costs of}} intervention were physical (compared with non-physical). This pattern of findings is consistent with the arousal-cost-reward model, which proposes that dangerous emergencies are recognized faster and more clearly as real emergencies, thereby inducing higher levels of arousal and hence more helping." [...] They also [...] "identified situations where bystanders provide welcome <b>physical</b> <b>support</b> for the potentially intervening individual and thus reduce the bystander effect, such as when the bystanders were exclusively male, when they were naive rather than passive confederates or only virtually present persons, and when the bystanders were not strangers." ...|$|E

40|$|Understanding {{the nature}} of part failure when using CastForm {{material}} for pattern generation is essential {{in the development of}} failure avoidance practices. Currently, many approaches employed in both research and industry rely on the use of <b>physical</b> <b>supports</b> to underpin the part, yet there is little research which explores their optimal implementation. In this paper, a detailed empirical investigation examines how the material characteristics of CastForm are affected during the thermal infiltration process, and how this may lead to part failure. Using Dynamic Mechanical Thermal Analysis, it is shown that increased temperature reduces the storage modulus of the material, leading to rubber-like behaviour at 60 C. The findings of this material investigation are used as input for the generation of a linear static FEA model, with which this research demonstrates how <b>physical</b> <b>supports</b> can be optimized in terms of the quantity used, and also their positioning relative to the part. Two industrial case studies illustrate this approach to part production, highlighting both the success of the FEA approach to eliminate part failures, and also the potential to improve knowledge for the process operators in the use of part supports...|$|R
