40|$|The {{covenant}} reading ceremonies in Joshua 8 : 30 - 35, 2 Kings 22 - 23, and Nehemiah 7 : 72 b- 8 : 18 betray {{a developing}} interplay {{between the people}} of Israel and {{the book of the}} law. These narratives are unique in the Hebrew Bible in presenting the oralization of a covenant document to a specific audience. Previous scholarship on these narratives has focused on reconstructing the source-critical history of each account and the historicity of the reported events. For the following study, Joshua 8 : 30 - 35 and 2 Kings 22 - 23 represent earlier pre-exilic and exilic traditions, while 2 Chronicles 34 - 35 and Nehemiah 8 illustrate later post-exilic perspectives. However, supplementing source-critical scholarship, narrative criticism is used to contribute a fresh view of the relationship that the narratives construct between the community of Israel and their authoritative text. This study analyzes the characterization of the people and the characterization of the book of the law, both within the broader context of ancient Near Eastern loyalty oaths and within the immediate context of the corpus of the Hebrew Bible. The sensory descriptions of the book of the law especially highlight how the textual artifact connects the particularized community of each respective narrative to the covenantal past of the Israelite people, while effectually executing that connection through differing loci of authority. This literary analysis reveals that each reading ceremony narrative manipulates the material functions of the text and its locus of authority according to its own ideology. The historical trajectory presented by these narratives portrays the people of Israel as progressively more exclusive, while portraying the book of the law as increasingly more written and less oral. Joshua 8 : 30 - 35 and 2 Kings 22 - 23 demonstrate that during the exilic period, the book of the law could be authorized either as Mosaic tradition or as a prophetic word from God. By the post- exilic <b>period,</b> <b>authorization</b> through Mosaic discourse became pervasive. 2 Chronicles 34 - 35 and Nehemiah 8 illustrate this well-documented post-exilic phenomenon. In these narratives, by providing continuity between a particularized community and the Mosaic covenant, the book of the law stakes a claim that the true people of Yahweh are limited to the covenant reading ceremony participants...|$|E

40|$|The Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA) {{was passed}} in 1991 with the {{objective}} of encouraging greater coordination and efficiency of transportation movement among modes. The Act issued a challenge to transportation professionals to shift the old paradigms and explore new opportunities to improve the integration of modes, as well as to ask new questions about coordinated freight and passenger movements. As public and private transportation providers deliberate {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} the first Act, it is important to record what has evolved in the area of intermodalism at the end of the six-year <b>authorization</b> <b>period.</b> This report examines some of the past challenges and requirements of ISTEA legislation. It reviews the meaning of intermodalism across modes for freight and passenger service. The report takes an in-depth look at public/private intermodal alliances that are working efficiently. These examples of intermodalism across the country are scanned, focusing on the state-of-the-industry. Documents are examined and synthesized to highlight these efforts. Elements identified as barriers to intermodalism are also identified. Recommendations to improve intermodalism are considered.

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{information}} that is available when marketing authorizations are approved is limited. Pharmacovigilance has an important role during the postauthorization period, and alerts published by national authorities allow health care professionals to be informed about new data on safety profiles. This study therefore sought to analyze all safety alerts published by the Portuguese National Authority of Medicines and Health Products I. P. (INFARMED). METHODS: We conducted an observational study of all alerts published on the INFARMED website from January 2002 through December 2014. From the data included in the alerts, the following information was abstracted: active substance name (and trade name), event {{that led to the}} alert, and the resulting safety measures. Active substances were classified according to the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) code. FINDINGS: A total of 562 alerts were published, and 304 were eligible for inclusion. The musculoskeletal system was the ATC code with more alerts (n = 53), followed by the nervous system (n = 42). Communication of the information and recommendations to the health care professionals and the public in general was the most frequent safety measure (n = 128), followed by changes in the Summary of the Product Characteristics and package information leaflet (n = 66). During the study <b>period,</b> 26 marketing <b>authorizations</b> were temporarily suspended and 10 were revoked. IMPLICATIONS: The knowledge of the alerts published during the postmarketing period is very useful to the health care professionals for improving prescription and use of medicines and to the scientific community for the development of new researches.

40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Federal Transportation Administration's (FTA) New Starts Program helps pay for designing and constructing rail, bus, and trolley projects through full funding grant agreements. The Transportation Equity Act for the 21 st Century (TEA- 21), authorized $ 6. 1 billion in "guaranteed" funding for the New Starts program through fiscal year 2003. Although the level of New Starts funding is higher than ever, the demand for these resources is also extremely high. Given this high demand for new and expanded transit facilities across the nation, communities need to examine approaches that stretch the federal and local dollar yet still provide high quality transit services. Although FTA has been faced with an impending transit budget crunch for several years, {{it is likely to}} end the TEA- 21 <b>authorization</b> <b>period</b> with $ 310 million in unused New Starts commitment authority if its proposed fiscal year 2003 budget is enacted. Bus Rapid Transit is designed to provide major improvements in the speed and reliability of bus service through barrier-separated busways, buses on High Occupancy Vehicle Lanes, or improved service on arterial streets. GAO found that Bus Rapid Transit was a less expensive and more flexible approach than Light Rail service because buses can be rerouted more easily to accommodate changing travel patterns. However, transit officials also noted that buses have a poor public image. As a result, many transit planners are designing Bus Rapid Transit systems that offer service that will be an improvement over standard bus service (see GAO- 02 - 603). ...|$|R
40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Since the early 1970 's, {{the federal government has}} provided a large share of the nation's capital investment in urban mass transportation. Much of this funding has come through the Federal Transit Administration's (FTA) New Starts Program, which helps pay for rail, bus, and trolley projects. The Transportation Equity Act for the 21 st Century authorized about $ 6 billion in "guaranteed" funding for the New Starts program through fiscal year 2003. FTA's evaluation process assigns candidate projects individual ratings for project justification and local financial commitments. The process also assigns an overall rating intended to reflect the project's merit. FTA recommended four projects for funding commitments for fiscal year 2003 in its New Starts report and budget proposal. FTA evaluated 50 proposed projects for fiscal year 2003 and developed ratings for 31 of them. Twenty-seven of these projects were rated as "highly recommended" or "recommended. " Although FTA has faced transit budget crunches for years, the agency will end the act's <b>authorization</b> <b>period</b> with $ 310 million in unused commitment authority. Proposals to limit the amount of New Starts funds would allow more projects to receive such funding, but could harm specific projects being developed and the local transportation planning process. For example, limiting New Starts funds to 60 percent of a project's cost for the 49 projects now in final design or preliminary engineering would "free up" $ 500 million for additional projects. However, only 20 percent of these projects plan to use New Starts funds for more than 60 percent of projected costs and would be affected by such a cap. ...|$|R

OBJECTIVES: To assess MRS results when not associated to other procedures. METHODS: The information from the Hospital Information System (SIH/DATASUS) made available online was submitted to analysis. The data include information on gender, age, hospital stay <b>period,</b> hospital admission <b>authorization</b> (AIH) costs, number of surgeries at each hospital, and in-hospital mortality rate. Only MRS with no associated procedures were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 63, 529 surgeries were performed in the period between 2005 and 2007 at 191 hospitals. Sixteen hospitals reporting very low surgery volume were excluded. The remaining total number of surgeries came down to 63, 272 for the final analysis. In-hospital mortality rate was 6. 22 %, with small surgery volume hospitals reporting higher rate than high volume hospitals (≥ 300 surgeries in the time period under study), 7. 29 % versus 5. 77 % (p< 0. 001). Average hospital stay time length was 12 days, with no difference having been reported between low (12. 08 ± 5. 52) and high volume (12. 15 ± 7. 70) hospitals. Males reported lower mortality rate than females - 5. 20 % versus 8. 25 % (p< 0. 001), similarly to younger individuals when compared to the elderly (≥ 65 years of age), 4. 21 % versus 9. 36 % (p< 0. 001).
