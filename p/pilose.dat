5|$|The {{specific}} name {{derives from the}} Latin word <b>pilose,</b> meaning 'covered with soft hair'. The ant was first identified in 1858 by British entomologist Frederick Smith in his Catalogue of hymenopterous insects {{in the collection of}} the British Museum part VI, under the binomial name Myrmecia pilosula from specimens he collected in Hobart in Tasmania. There, Smith described the specimens of a worker, queen and male. The type specimen is located in the British Museum in London. In 1922, American entomologist William Morton Wheeler established the subgenus Halmamyrmecia characterised by its jumping behaviour, of which the jack jumper ant was designated as the type species. However, John Clark later synonymised Halmamyrmecia under the subgenus Promyrmecia in 1927 and placed the ant in the subgenus in 1943. William Brown synonymised Promyrmecia due to the lack of morphological evidence that would make it distinct from Myrmecia and later placed the jack jumper ant in the genus in 1953.|$|E
500|$|Auricularia auricula-judae {{is similar}} to A.fuscosuccinea in colour and texture, and [...] "may be {{confused}} with it if only external features are considered". The spore and basidia sizes of the two species are slightly different, {{but this is not}} a reliable way to tell them apart. A.cornea is another similar species in the same genus, but has distinct internal differences, is normally more <b>pilose</b> (more covered in soft hair) and tends to fruit in larger numbers.|$|E
500|$|M. inquilina {{is a large}} species, {{though it}} is smaller than its host. The body length of the ant is , the head {{including}} the clypeus is , the antennal scape [...] and {{the diameter of the}} eyes are [...] The mandibles are slender with four to five acutely shaped teeth. The antennae are morphologically similar to M. vindex, but it is smaller in comparison; the petiole node is also longer and wider. The postpetiole is subtriangular and more narrow than those seen on M. vindex queens. The clypeus, legs and antennae are covered in punctulates (spots), and the postpetiole and gaster have less punctulates. M. inquilina can be distinguished from other ants due to its lack of <b>pilose</b> (long soft hairs); only small erect setae are mostly found on the mandibles and gastric apex, but short hair {{can be found on the}} legs, and on the dorsum, thorax and cervix. The ant has pubescence (soft short hair) finer and more abundant than M. vindex. The pubescence is greyish in colour, and it is shorter and more noticeable on the clypeus and appendages while it is conspicuous on the postpetiole and gaster.|$|E
