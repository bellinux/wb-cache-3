Crumple-forming {{results in a}} mesostructured system in which mechanical properties of the material are governed by complex cross-scale deformation mechanisms.

40|$|AbstractIn this <b>paper,</b> <b>stiffness</b> {{reduction}} of general symmetric laminates containing a uniform distribution of matrix cracks {{in a single}} orientation is analyzed. An admissible stress field is considered, which satisfies equilibrium and all the boundary and continuity conditions. This stress field {{has been used in}} conjunction with the principle of minimum complementary energy to get the effective stiffness matrix of a cracked general symmetric laminate. Natural boundary conditions have been derived from the variational principle to overcome the limitations of the existing variational methods on the analysis of general symmetric laminates. Therefore, the capability of analyzing cracked symmetric laminates using the variational approach has been enhanced significantly. It has been shown that the method provides a rigorous lower bound for the stiffness matrix of a cracked laminate, which is very important for practical applications. Results derived from the developed method for the properties of the cracked laminates showed an excellent agreement with experimental data and with those obtained from McCartney’s stress transfer model. The differences of the developed model with McCartney’s model are discussed in detail. It can be emphasized that the current approach is simpler than McCartney’s model, which needs an averaging procedure to obtain the governing equations.

40|$|A {{stiffness}} reduction {{method for}} the design of laterally restrained web-tapered steel structures fabricated through the welding of individual steel plates is presented in this <b>paper.</b> <b>Stiffness</b> reduction functions for welded members, accounting fully for the deleterious influence of the spread of plasticity and imperfections on the structural resistance, are developed. The method is implemented through (i) dividing tapered members into prismatic segments along their lengths, (ii) reducing the flexural stiffness of each segment by means of the developed stiffness reduction functions considering the first-order forces and cross-section properties of each segment, (iii) performing Geometrically Nonlinear Analysis and (iv) making cross-section strength checks. Essentially, it is proposed to replace the current typical approach to structural design of conducting a simple elastic (with nominal stiffness) structural analysis followed by elaborate member checks with an integrated process utilising more sophisticated second-order analysis (with stiffness reduction) but very simple design checks. The distribution of internal forces within the structure is captured more accurately due to the allowance for imperfections, residual stresses and plasticity through stiffness reduction and the allowance for frame and member instability effects through the use of second-order analysis. The need for determining effective lengths and for conducting member buckling checks is also eliminated. Verification of the proposed approach against the results obtained from nonlinear shell finite element modelling is presented for various tapering geometries, slenderness values and loading conditions. Assessment of the proposed method against the European and North American steel design codes for tapered steel structures is also provided...|$|E
