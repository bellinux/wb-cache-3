50|$|<b>Passing</b> <b>the</b> <b>buck</b> in {{international}} relations theory involves the tendency of nation-states to refuse to confront a growing threat {{in the hopes that}} another state will. The most notable example of this was the refusal of the United Kingdom, United States, France, or the Soviet Union to effectively confront Nazi Germany during the 1930s. With the Munich Agreement, France and the United Kingdom successfully avoided armed confrontation with Germany, <b>passing</b> <b>the</b> <b>buck</b> to <b>the</b> Soviet Union. The Soviet Union then <b>passed</b> <b>the</b> <b>buck</b> back to <b>the</b> western powers by signing the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact.|$|R

40|$|Shifting the {{responsibility}} for a necessary but costly action to someone else is often called <b>Passing</b> <b>the</b> <b>Buck.</b> Examples of such behavior in politics are environmental and budget problems which are left to future generations. Small group examples are (not) washing the dishes or (not) dealing with a difficult customer. Under the assumption of altruistic preferences, rational behavior in this game is derived and confronted with experimental data. By comparison, the sequence of possible decision makers in <b>the</b> normal <b>Passing</b> <b>the</b> <b>Buck</b> game is substituted with an expert who alone is competent to fix the problem. It {{turned out that the}} marginal probabilities of shifting {{the responsibility}} are in good accordance with the theoretical model, although with completely different parameter distributions for experts and non-experts. The structure of the individual decisions, however, is best described by a random parameter model (Cox et al., 2007) ...|$|R
