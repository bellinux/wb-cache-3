500|$|In 2002, Love began {{composing}} {{an album}} with songwriter Linda Perry of 4 Non Blondes, titled America's Sweetheart, also reuniting with drummer Patty Schemel. Love signed with Virgin Records to release it, and began recording it in France in 2003. America's Sweetheart {{was released in}} February 2004, and received mixed reviews from critics. Charles Aaron of Spin called it a [...] "jaw-dropping act of artistic will and a fiery, proper follow-up to 1994's Live Through This" [...] and awarded it eight out of ten stars, while The Village Voice said: [...] " [...] willing to act out the dream of every teenage brat who ever {{wanted to have a}} glamorous, high-profile hissyfit, and she turns those egocentric nervous breakdowns into art. Sure, the art becomes less compelling when you've been pulling the same stunts for a decade. But, honestly, is there anybody out there who fucks up better?" [...] The album sold less than 100,000 copies. Love has publicly expressed her regret over the record several times, reasoning that her drug issues at the time were to blame: [...] "America's Sweetheart was my one true <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>shit.</b> It has no cohesive thread. I just hate it", she said in a 2014 interview. Shortly after the record was released, Love told Kurt Loder on TRL: [...] "I cannot exist as a solo artist. It's a joke." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Harris, {{the head}} of the casting {{department}} refused to negotiate her salary, stating that she was a [...] "scale character who dies in the first twenty minutes." [...] This ultimately led to her dropping out of the project. [...] "People automatically assume I wanted some crazy amount of money, or something," [...] Harris commented in 2014, [...] " [...] it's not like I [...] demanding of anything, really... When you've been asked to do something and then they insult you by saying, [...] "You're a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>shit,</b> you die in the first act—I don't give a fuck that you were in two other Halloween movies, who cares?"...

Oddly enough, the song reminds me of Lars von Triers best works, which provoke actual emotional reactions while being, on paper, contrived <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>shit.</b> I Was Here, and 4 in general, is that kind of a work, objectively middling, subjectively magnificent."

2500|$|This is {{a normal}} guitar that resembles a GHI Guitar made in Japan in the 1960s. It has a 1950s Harmony pickup added with duct tape, and is tuned to G, G, and B (middle G is one octave higher than the bottom). This is how to set it up: Remove the low E string, put about a [...]049 string in the A string {{position}} tuned to G, remove the D string, put about a [...]028 string tuned to G in the G string position, put about a [...]018 string tuned to B in the B position, and remove the high E string. He was given the guitar by {{a friend who had}} had it nailed to his wall as a decoration, but at his gigs, he often tells the story that he bought it for US$75 in this condition from a man who later told him he only paid US$25 for it the day before, and claims to have vowed never to add another string, and that he would tour the world telling his story of how the seller ripped him off. [...] A lot of the time he also adds, while picking up or putting away the guitar, that it is the [...] "biggest <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>shit</b> in the world, I swear." [...] In a BBC interview Wold claimed that the guitar was found by a friend, just with the three strings on it, and he decided to keep it that way.|$|E
2500|$|Soon {{after his}} return in February 2000, at Bash at the Beach on July 9, Hogan was {{involved}} in a controversial work with Vince Russo. Hogan was scheduled to challenge Jeff Jarrett for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship. Before the match, there was a backstage dispute between Hogan and Russo; Hogan wanted to take the title, but Russo was going to have Jarrett win, and lose it to Booker T. Russo told Hogan {{that he was going to}} have Jarrett lie down for him, simulating a real conflict, although Jarrett was not told it was a work. When the bell rang, Jarrett lay down in the middle of the ring while Russo threw the WCW World Heavyweight Championship belt in the ring and yelled at Hogan from ringside to pin Jarrett. A visibly confused Hogan complied with a foot on Jarrett's chest after getting on the microphone and telling Russo, [...] "Is this your idea, Russo? That's why this company is in the damn shape it's in, because of bullshit like this!" [...] After winning and being announced as the new WCW World Heavyweight Champion, Hogan immediately took the WCW title belt. Moments later, Russo returned to the ring, angrily proclaiming, [...] "I can guarantee you that this is the last time you will ever see that <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>shit</b> in a WCW stadium!" [...] This is also when the public discovered, through Russo, the [...] "creative control" [...] clause that Hogan had, which meant that Hogan was able to control what would happen with his own character and be able to do so without anyone else being able to tell him no. In his Bash at the Beach shoot promo, Russo said that he was arguing with Hogan all day prior to the event in the back because he wanted to use the clause in the Jarrett match, saying, [...] "That means that, in the middle of this ring, when [...] knew it was bullshit, he beats Jeff Jarrett!". Since Hogan refused to job to Jarrett, a new WCW World Heavyweight Championship was created, setting the stage for a title match between Booker T and Jarrett later that night.|$|E
5000|$|The term <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>shit</b> is {{generally}} used to classify {{a product or}} service as being sufficiently below the writer's understanding of generally accepted quality standards to be of negligible and perhaps even negative value. The term <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>shit</b> has greater precision than shit or shitty in that <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>shit</b> identifies the low quality of a specific component or output of a process without applying a derogatory slant to the entire process. For example, if one said [...] "The inner city youth orchestra has been a remarkably successful initiative in that it has kept young people off the streets after school and exposed them to culture and discipline, thereby improving their self esteem and future prospects. The fact that the orchestra's recent rendition of Tchaikovsky's Manfred Symphony in B minor was pretty much a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>shit</b> should {{not in any way}} detract from this." [...] The substitution of shit or shitty for pretty much a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>shit</b> would imply irony and would therefore undermine the strength of the statement.|$|E
500|$|On December 24, 2008, Judge Gary A. Feess granted 20th Century Fox's {{claim to}} a {{copyright}} interest in the film. An attorney for 20th Century Fox said that the studio would seek an order to delay the release of Watchmen. Producer Lloyd Levin revealed in an open letter that in 2005 both Fox and Warner Bros. were offered {{the chance to make}} Watchmen. Fox passed on the project while Warner Bros. made a deal to acquire the movie rights and move forward with development. An internal Fox email documented that executives at Fox felt the script was [...] "one of the most unintelligible <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>shit</b> they had read in years". On January 15, 2009, the trade press reported that Fox and Warner Bros. had reached a settlement. Fox would receive a share of the box office, but no future ownership of the film. The settlement awarded Fox up to $10 million in development costs and legal fees, plus worldwide gross participation scaling from 5 to 8.5 percent.|$|R

5000|$|The {{members of}} Nirvana and Albini {{decided on a}} self-imposed two-week {{deadline}} for recording the album. Wary of interference by DGC, Albini suggested the band members pay for the sessions with their own money, which they agreed to. Studio fees totaled US$24,000, while Albini took a flat fee of $100,000 for his services. Despite the suggestions of Nirvana's management company Gold Mountain, Albini refused to take percentage points on record sales, even though he stood to earn about $500,000 in royalties. [...] While a common practice among producers in the music industry, Albini refused to take royalties because he considered it to be immoral and [...] "an insult to the artist".In February 1993, Nirvana traveled to Pachyderm Studio in Cannon Falls, Minnesota, to record the album.
