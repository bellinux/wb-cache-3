5|$|Clover, sorrel, nettle and thistle are common, {{and grow}} wild in Greater Manchester. Common heather (Calluna vulgaris) dominates the uplands, such as Saddleworth Moor, which lies within the South Pennines and Dark <b>Peak</b> <b>area</b> of the Peak District National Park. The Rochdale Canal {{harbours}} floating water-plantain (Luronium), an endangered aquatic plant. In 2002, Plantlife International launched its County Flowers campaign, asking {{members of the}} public to nominate and vote for a wild flower emblem for their county. Common cottongrass (Eriophorum angustifolium), a plant with fluffy white plumes native to wet hollows on high moors, was announced as the county flower of Greater Manchester. The house sparrow, common starling, and common blackbird are among the most populous bird species in Greater Manchester; Eurasian magpie and feral pigeon are common and breed in habitats across the county. The South Pennines support internationally important numbers of European golden plover, curlew, merlin and twite.|$|E

30|$|Extraction {{recoveries}} {{were evaluated}} at three QC levels (low, mid and high concentrations) {{by comparing the}} <b>peak</b> <b>areas</b> obtained from the samples with the analytes spiked before and after extraction.

The ratio (A/B ×  100) is defined as the matrix effect. The value of matrix effect less than 85  % represented ionization suppression, while more than 115  % represented ionization enhancement.|$|R

25|$|In 1861, when Confederate General Sibley {{organized}} {{his army}} to invade New Mexico, he commissioned Captain George Madison {{to go into}} Colorado with a two-fold mission: disrupt federal mail and communication lines, and to help organize Confederate recruitment there. At this time, Confederate recruits in Colorado were first sent to a camp in the Pikes <b>Peak</b> <b>area,</b> and then sent to the main Confederate encampment at Mace's Hole. In early 1862, Captain Madison and his men captured mail en route to Ft. Garland. Madison was also actively planning a raid on Ft. Garland. Federal soldiers learned of the encampment at Mace's Hole and broke up the regiment {{while many of the}} Confederates were away. The Federals captured forty-four Confederates and took them to Denver.|$|E
25|$|Until the Middle Ages, the <b>peak</b> <b>area</b> of Karkonosze {{remained}} untouched; {{the first}} people to explore it were treasure hunters looking for gold, and shepherds. Already in the 18th century ascents to the Sněžka/Śnieżka were fairly common, albeit the forms of organised tourism appeared {{in the second half of}} 19th century, along with railway access to Jelenia Góra, Szklarska Poręba and Karpacz. Before the rush time for Karkonosze, Śnieżka was climbed amongst others by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. In that period many shepherd's huts were built, called in German Baude and bouda in Czech. Some of them were developed later in mountain huts, which exist even now, e.g. Lucni Bouda. Due to the industrial revolution and the period of prosperity (which corresponds to Victorian times in England) tourism and hiking became popular. This was about the time, when the whole network of roads and trails, altogether ca 300km, was constructed in both Silesian and Bohemian parts of the mountains. The whole idea was conceived, implemented and managed by two mountain clubs, Austrian Riesengebirgenverein and German Riesengebirgenverein. All the main paths and trails, including these in the alpine area, had been constructed before World War I. The trail, later dubbed Polish-Czech Friendship Trail, was completed before the end of the 19th century. At the beginning of the 20th century the upper zones of the range were a busy tourist region with numerous huts and other facilities.|$|E

40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this work was to convert {{conventional}} HPLC method to the conditions of UFLC for determination of related substances of Quetiapine Fumarate tablet; new method should need less organic solvents, shorten the analysis time and be validated to guarantee its suitability. Methods: The new chromatographic conditions were assigned using an online method transfer calculator to convert HPLC parameters to UFLC parameters. The suitability of the new method was validated by system suitability test, linearity, quantification limit, detection limit, selectivity, precision and accuracy. Results: The method was shown to be suitable as the tailing factor of the peaks was kept within the limit range of 0. 8 - 1. 5 and the resolution {{of each of the}} <b>peak</b> <b>areas</b> was in all cases greater than 2. In linearity testing, the correlation coefficient obtained from the procedure was 0. 999, which showed that the two variables, the <b>peak</b> <b>areas</b> and the range of five different concentrations of the sample highly correlate with each other. The quantification limit obtained from the method was 0. 03 %, while the detection limit was 0. 01 %.

30|$|Given the {{differences}} in performance of the fully porous and core-shell columns, we proceeded to perform quantitative calibration to determine the linearity of concentration-dependent response and method detection limits for purposes of quantifying catechin and EGCG in tea samples. Calibration curves for the antioxidants catechin and EGCG were generated from fresh solutions and used for the quantification where each point in the calibration curve is the average of triplicate injection. The <b>peak</b> <b>areas</b> corresponding to each antioxidants were calculated automatically by the HPLC software (LabSolutions), and a linear relationship was established by plotting the average <b>peak</b> <b>areas</b> against concentration.|$|R

Wirksworth Wapentake was the Low <b>Peak</b> <b>area</b> of the King's Field. At different times there were liberties based on Wirksworth, Middleton-by-Wirksworth, Cromford, Brassington, Matlock, Elton, Middleton-by-Youlgreave, Bonsall, Hopton and Carsington, and from 1638 until 1654 there was a separate liberty for the Dovegang, [...] on Cromford Moor which had become extremely productive after being drained by the first of the Derbyshire drainage schemes, or soughs.|$|E

In 1910 three months were spent in the field [...] along the Colorado River to study the river's effect as a barrier {{in the distribution of}} desert mammals.

Eckert, a retired member and former officer of the Philadelphia #2 local. The 1899 ITU convention at Detroit approved the name Union Printers Home. The home, a hospital and sanatorium, was staffed by its own doctors, nurses and other medical technicians. The lands of the home grew to [...] to accommodate a dairy, farms, gardens, power plant, and workshops to help make the UPH self-sufficient. In 1944, Dowell Patterson (1899–1968), superintendent of the home, saw that the most modern of medical equipment was furnished to the UPH. In later years, the tubercular sanitoriums were razed. Today the home serves the people of Colorado Springs and El Paso County as a health care facility with assisted living and nursing care. The main building is a State of Colorado historical site.|$|E

40|$|Surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization (SELDI) time {{of flight}} (TOF) is a mass {{spectrometry}} technology for measuring the composition of a sampled protein mixture. A mass spectrum contains peaks corresponding to proteins in the sample. The <b>peak</b> <b>areas</b> are proportional to the measured concentrations of the corresponding proteins. Quantifying <b>peak</b> <b>areas</b> is difficult for existing methods because peak shapes are not constant across a spectrum and because peaks often overlap. We present a new method for quantifying <b>peak</b> <b>areas.</b> Our method decomposes a spectrum into peaks and a baseline using so-called statistical finite mixture models. We illustrate our method in detail on 8 samples from culture media of adipose tissue and globally on 64 samples from serum to compare our method to the standard Ciphergen method. Both methods give similar estimates for singleton peaks, but not for overlapping peaks. The Ciphergen method overestimates the heights of such peaks while our method still gives appropriate estimates. Peak quantification {{is an important step}} in pre-processing SELDI-TOF data and improvements therein will pay off in the later biomarker discovery phase. ...|$|R
