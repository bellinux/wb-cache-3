DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The method for partial forming of a work piece for interior high pressure form, comprises carrying out the forming process via a tool though which a discharge geometry of the work piece is approximated in a sub region of a work piece cross section of the interior high pressure form to create work piece geometries. The work piece cross section is changed by the forming process asymmetrically and symmetrically to a work piece axis (3). The work piece cross section is changed in different radial levels, which are spaced apart from each other in direction of a work piece axis. The tool has a <b>pressing</b> <b>roll</b> (5) with a surface section (4) and the <b>pressing</b> <b>roll</b> is subjected with a force in such a manner that the surface section with the work piece is brought into unit to transform the work piece in a partially transforming step. The <b>pressing</b> <b>roll</b> and the work piece are moved relatively to each other. The surface section of the <b>pressing</b> <b>roll</b> has multi regions of different geometry, by which a definite region is brought into the unit with the work piece by swiveling the <b>pressing</b> <b>roll</b> around a swivel axis (8). The tool has multi pressing rolls, which are aligned in radial direction around the work piece to change the work piece cross section. INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are included for: (1) a device for partial forming of a work piece for interior high pressure form; and (2) an interior high pressure- formed work piece produced from semi-finished product.

In the pulp washing machine and method therefore, pulp to be washed is fed between the rotating drum and the <b>pressing</b> <b>roll</b> inside it, so that pulp passes along a spiral-formed track around the <b>pressing</b> <b>roll,</b> being thereby pressed several times. Washing liquid is fed to the pulp at one or several points along its track of movement, between the pressings and/or at the pressing position. Washing thus takes place partly as diffusion and partly as a displacement washing process. Washing is efficient and reduces the breaking of pulp fibers down to a minimum...|$|E

40|$|A {{number of}} water flow {{problems}} in porous media are modelled by Richards’ equation [1]. There exist {{a lot of}} different applications of this model. We are concerned with the simulation of the pressing section of a paper machine. This part of the industrial process provides the dewatering of the paper layer by the use of clothings, i. e. press felts, which absorb the water during pressing [2]. A system of nips are formed in the simplest case by rolls, which increase sheet dryness by pressing against each other (see Figure 1). A lot of theoretical studies were done for Richards’ equation (see [3], [4] and references therein). Most articles consider the case of x-independent coefficients. This simplifies the system considerably since, after Kirchhoff’s transformation of the problem, the elliptic operator becomes linear. In our case this condition is not satisfied and we have to consider nonlinear operator of second order. Moreover, all these articles are concerned with the nonstationary problem, while we are interested in the stationary case. Due to complexity of the physical process our problem has a specific feature. An additional convective term appears in our model because the porous media moves with the constant velocity through the <b>pressing</b> <b>rolls.</b> This term is zero in immobile porous media. We are not aware of papers, which deal with such kind of modified steady Richards’ problem. The goal {{of this paper is to}} obtain the stability results, to show the existence of a solution to the discrete problem, to prove the convergence of the approximate solution to the weak solution of the modified steady Richards’ equation, which describes the transport processes in the pressing section.

40|$|Dust {{and fines}} are created {{throughout}} the ferromanganese metal production. These fines are collected from ventilation filters, screening operations and off-gas cleaning facilities. As the fines contain {{a substantial amount}} of manganese it would be beneficial to charge them to the SAF (submerged arc furnace). Due to furnace design, it is sensitive to fines of sizes smaller than 6 mm. These fines clog channels in the charge layer, trapping gas produced deep in the furnace and hazardous situations and unpredictable furnace operation arise. In this work, manganese containing fines collected and delivered by Eramet Norway has been agglomerated through briquetting in combination with different binders. The binders were; Lime/molasses, magnesium-lignosulfonate and low dosage bentonite, the two first are organic binders and bentonite inorganic. The organic binders were tested in different dosages and were the focus area of this thesis. Two briquetting techniques were performed; uniaxial <b>pressing</b> and <b>roll</b> <b>pressing.</b> The uniaxial pressing was used to compare binders directly in green state (made but untreated), where it was concluded that the highest dosages of lime/molasses and lignosulfonate gave the strongest green strength briquettes. The two high-dosage organic binder briquettes were then reproduced with the roll press technique, which is the production method which is considered for industry purposes, to investigate further furnace operation potential. They were strength tested in green state and treated at different temperatures; 105 °C, 300 °C, 500 °C and 800 °C prior to compression strength testing. The evolution of strength from heat treatment gave the results of strength gain when dried, then steady decrease in strength from 300 °C up to 800 °C, this most probably due to organic binder burn-off at around 300 °C. This leaves the briquettes weakened for a long temperature interval and strength gain from sintering is not believed to occur before 1200 °C is reached. From long-term storage, it was noted that none of the different binder briquette types decreased notably in strength from storage intervals of 5 weeks. It is believed that mold formation in stored briquettes will not be a problem if stored for less than 30 days in a humid environment, or if stored dry, longer storage times will be possible...|$|R

Recently {{the method}} for obtaining ultra-fine grained {{metallic}} materials has developed using severe plastic deformation (SPD), such as equal channel angular <b>pressing</b> (ECAP), accumulative <b>roll</b> bonding (ARB), torsion straining, and warm multiple deformation (WMD) etc. In order to enhance thermal stability of ultra-fine grained aluminum alloys manufactured by SPD process, {{the addition of}} Sc and Zr elements has been considered to devise fine Al 3 Sc, Al 3 Zr and Al 3 (Scx Zr 1 -x) precipitates for inhibiting the grain growth. In this study, the microstructure evolution has been investigated in Al-Mg alloys with and without Sc and Zr addition during the warm multiple deformation process. In addition Al-Mg alloys were compressed at a strain rate of 10 - 1 sec- 1 by two different routes, that is, route A and route B. Route A is to rotate the specimen throughout 90 o around the vertical axis of loading direction at every pass. Route B is to rotate the specimen throughout 90 o around the parallel axis of loading direction and then rotate it again as route A. The specimen deformed by route B had finer grain size and more uniform distribution of grains than those deformed by route A. When the warm multiple deformation process repeated up to 8 passes at 673 K, the specimen consisted of ultra-fine grained structure with the average grain size less than 3 µm. The superplastic behavior can also be observed at the high strain rate and low temperature regime...|$|R

40|$|The {{choice of}} furnish in {{newsprint}} production is {{dictated by the}} raw material costs, production cost and the final quality demanded by printers. In addition to the raw material costs, energy cost {{is a major factor}} in papermaking economy. Modern newsprint machines have combinations of roll and shoe presses to increase web dryness to approximately 50 % after wet pressing and thus keeping drying cost as low as possible. Thermomechanical pulp and deinked pulp are commonly used for producing newsprint nowadays. The increasing use of deinked pulp and filler in newsprint production has improved press dewatering. However, {{there is a lack of}} published research on the effects of the nip types, furnish and filler distribution in the web on sheet dewatering and sheet structure after wet pressing. The dynamic wet pressing simulator at NTNU-PFI was used for the pressing experiments. A single sided dewatering setting was used. The wet pressed samples were freeze dried in liquid nitrogen after pressing. The cross-sections of the freeze dried samples were imaged in a SEM and the cross-sectional structures were quantified. The cross-section images were split into top, middle and felt or dewatering side layers based on equal solids per layer per line length. The Euclidean distance maps generated by ImageJ software were used to quantify the distribution of fines, pores size, porosity and thickness of the sample. To understand the filler, fibre and MFC interactions, images for surface characterization were acquired using FE-SEM. 3 D images for DIP and TMP samples pressed with shoe pulse were acquired using x-ray micro-(computed) tomography (X-μCT) for visual assessment of the densification across the sheet’s thickness. In addition, the surface roughness was quantified. As expected, deinked pulp (DIP) dewaters more easily than thermomechanical pulp (TMP) when pressed with a roll pulse. The in-plane moisture flow (crushing) in DIP samples started at higher peak pressure and higher solids content compared to the TMP samples. The TMP samples showed higher springback after wet pressing compared to DIP samples. When both TMP and DIP samples were designed to have a higher amount of small pores at the dewatering side’s surface layers, the samples with the coarser TMP pulp could achieve similar dryness as DIP samples when pressed with higher nip pressure. In addition, the DIP samples with the higher number of small pores at the dewatering layer also yielded lower dryness after <b>pressing</b> with <b>roll</b> pulse. The effect of filler (ground calcium carbonate, GCC) distribution in the paper’s zdirection on final dryness and sheet structure after the wet <b>pressing</b> with a <b>roll</b> pulse was also studied. The distribution of filler did not affect the maximum dryness after wet pressing (40 %) for sheets containing identical (13 %) amount of filler. However, the samples with more filler in the dewatering layer dewater more easily and yield the 40 % maximum achievable dryness after wet pressing at a lower pressure. As a result, the samples with more filler in the dewatering layer yielded higher thickness as compared to samples with filler distributed evenly in the z-direction. In the study on wet-pressing using two different shoe press pulse profiles, the samples made from TMP and DIP yielded identical after-press solids content. More water was pressed out of the TMP samples as compared to DIP samples since TMP samples had lower initial solids content. The wet webs with more porous structure in the dewatering layer yielded higher dryness after wet-pressing. This is a major advantage, as higher dryness after wet-pressing implies a reduction of steam consumption in the dryer. This study also showed that the shoe press pulse with high peak pressure at the end yielded higher solids content and apparently higher bulk after the wet-pressing compared to the shoe press pulse with high peak pressure in the beginning. Higher filler content in newsprint increases the risk of linting at the printing press. Recent advances in technology and research in producing microfibrillated cellulose (MFC) should enable the production of MFC with acceptable energy cost in the near future. MFC can be used to improve the strength properties of the paper. Optimal selection of MFC quality and filler content can improve the optical properties while maintaining or enhancing the surface strength of the sheets. Different qualities of microfibrillated cellulose (MFC) were blended with TMP and ground calcium carbonate (GCC). The addition of MFC decreased the drainage rate of the pulp suspension but improved the strength properties. Wet pressing experiments showed that optimal use of MFC and filler could enhance the strength and optical properties without reducing the solids content after wet pressing. Field emission SEM revealed that the MFC particles adsorbed onto filler particles and fibres. The MFC binds the filler-MFC-fines aggregates to the fibre network, thus partly filled the pore network. As a result, MFC addition increased the air resistance and internal bonding of the sheet. PhD i kjemisk prosessteknologiPhD in Chemical Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|People {{have shown}} {{significant}} interest in metal air batteries throughout history {{due to their}} high energy storage capacities, safety, and low cost. These batteries do not require oxygen, one of their constituent fuels, to be stored inside the cell leading to high volumetric capacities. This is achievable due to the utilization of a unique gas diffusion electrode system that has a complex three phase interface regime. One of the safest and cheapest from the metal air family is the zinc air battery, zinc {{being one of the}} most abundant metals on earth. However, researchers have come across various challenges when dealing with these batteries and some of them include sluggish reaction rates, slow gas diffusion rates, and cell material degradation leading to poor power densities and charge-discharge cyclability. This work will address some of these issues via electrode and cell design optimization utilizing some of the proprietary technologies developed in the Applied Nanomaterials and Clean Energy Laboratory. In this work, it has been demonstrated that highly conductive and porous zinc electrodes can be developed that eliminate some of the detrimental dendrite formations usual in conventional zinc based batteries. These electrodes have been made by the use of nanomaterial templates and micellar voids as well as controlled temperature treatments to make strong porous structures making them ideal for use in commercial zinc air batteries. Novel gas diffusion electrodes have also been developed which have very slow rates of passivation in alkaline electrolyte compared to conventional carbon gas diffusion electrodes. These novel gas diffusion electrodes are made using a modified <b>roll</b> <b>pressing</b> method which has been optimized to account for low cost large scale production and porosity ideal for high gas diffusion rates without compromising electrode hydrophobicity and clogging by electrolyte. Cell designs have also been investigated and proposed, ideal for housing the proprietary anodes and cathodes that are leak proof, compact, and recyclable. Each cell benefits from ample cathode area exposure to oxygen and a stack design that makes sure there is sufficient flow of air to the cells to maximize power density. 1 yea...|$|R

The first problem, considered experimentally, is that of reverse roll coating with a liquid reservoir positioned directly above horizontally aligned rollers. Measurements of the film thickness {{as a function of the}} height of fluid in the reservoir and speed ratio are presented. When the wetting line is located downstream of the nip, either a decrease in the height of the associated hydrostatic head or an increase in the speed ratio causes a reduction in the thickness of the outgoing film. However, when the wetting line is located upstream of the nip the opposite is found to be true. The bead-break instability in forward meniscus coating is considered both experimentally and analytically. Agreement between predictions from a simple mathematical model of the stable bead and experimentally determined meniscus positions is seen to be excellent. A perturbation hypothesis is used to predict the onset of the bead-break instability, at which the upstream meniscus accelerates rapidly towards the downstream one, so the two collide and the bead collapses. The results from the model compare well with experiments. An outline of a method for using the bead-break instability as a design criterion is also presented. Typically in a slot, blade or knife coater the downstream meniscus is assumed to pin at a corner of the coating device. In chapter 5, a series of experiments and a corresponding computational study, are presented which illustrate that the meniscus can advance up the face of such coating devices (in this case a roll-flat plate system). Reducing the corner angle is seen to reduce the size of the climb region and the associated recirculation at this point at the downstream meniscus. It is also shown that the meniscus can detach from the corner and retreat into the gap, which can in turn give rise to the ribbing instability. An offset gravure coating arrangement is considered in chapter 6. The coating arrangement is split into two areas of study - the offset gravure nip and the kiss coating bead. An experimental investigation of the offset nip with the two rolls vertically aligned and running at the same speed in forward mode reveals two ways in which the metered film thickness can be influenced. Either increasing the nip force by <b>pressing</b> the two <b>rolls</b> together or decreasing the roll speeds causes a reduction in the metered film thickness. At higher speeds the metered film thickness is observed to asymptote to a limiting value, the value of which depends on the gravure pattern. The reverse mode kiss coating bead operating at speed ratios greater than one is also investigated. Experiments reveal that under these conditions, all the fluid is transferred from the roll surface to the web and the two make contact due to the generation of a sub-ambient pressure field within the bead. Two models based on lubrication theory are derived, one assuming an infinitely tensioned web and a second that incorporates the effect of web flexibility. The latter is found to give much better agreement with the experimental data. Finally a perturbation hypothesis is applied to these to models in order to predict the onset of the ribbing instability, both of which are found to give reasonable agreement with the experimental data. Finally, the results of a systematic experimental investigation of reverse mode direct gravure coating is reported, where the web runs directly over a gravure roll surface. This wide ranging parametric study illustrates the effect of the operating parameters on the final film thickness. Key findings are that speed ratio, fluid properties and cell shape and size can significantly influence the final film thickness. For a fixed roll speed it is observed that as the web speed is increased the gravure bead becomes unstable. This results in streaking on the web, and gives an upper limit to the speed ratio. ...|$|R
