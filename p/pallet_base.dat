30|$|To {{generate}} the pallet {{data from the}} information contained in a TPFDD line item, DALP-TS computes upper and lower bounds on the required number of pallets. The bounds indicate the smallest and largest number of pallets that could be created from the given cargo weight. In order to be a non-trivial load, pallets were assumed to have a lower weight bound of 2500  lb. The structural limitations of the <b>pallet</b> <b>base,</b> as well as most cargo aircraft, restrict the pallet upper weight limit to 10, 000  lb. Thus, if a TPFDD line item specified 63, 800  lb of cargo, the minimum number of possible pallets is: 63, 800 / 10, 000  =  7, and the maximum number of pallets is: 63, 800 / 2500  =  25. DALP-TS randomly selects an integer between these bounds (inclusive) as the total number of pallets and assigns a random weight between 2500 and 10, 000  lb to each pallet such that the sum of the pallet weights equals the specified weight by the TPFDD line item. Each pallet associated with a given TPFDD line item has identical temporal constraints.|$|E

We approach the problem by developing and solving integer linear models.

Then, we add progressively new conditions to consider the weight and volume of <b>pallet</b> <b>bases</b> and to include other desirable features for the solutions to be useful in practice, such as the position of the center of gravity and the minimization of the number of pallets. The models have been tested on a large set of real instances involving up to 46 trucks and kindly provided to us by a distribution company. The results show that in most cases the optimal solution can be obtained in small running times. Moreover, when optimality cannot be proven, the gap is very small, so we obtain high quality solutions for all the instances that we tested...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the influence}} of horizontal bracing restraints provided by the friction between <b>pallet</b> <b>bases</b> and rail beams on the static behaviour and design of steel drive-in storage racks. The pallet bracing restraints are shown to significantly influence the structural behaviour of the rack, and their effect on the bending moment distribution of the uprights is studied in the paper. The 2 D single upright model proposed by Godley is improved in this study by including the restraints provided by the plan flexural stiffness of the rail beams and the friction between the pallets and rail beams. The improved 2 D model was found to accurately reproduce the bending moment distributions obtained using 3 D advanced finite element analysis. The 2 D single upright model is used to analyse 36 drive-in racks under various load case combinations. The paper evaluates {{the influence of}} the pallet bracing restraints on the ultimate capacity of drive-in racks, clarifies the loading pattern(s) governing the structural design and determines the friction coefficient, or strength of a restraining device, required to prevent the pallets from sliding.

40|$|Purpose: We propose and {{demonstrate}} a concept development process (CDP) {{as a framework}} to solve a value stream mapping (VSM) related process layout design optimization problem. Design/methodology/approach: A case study approach was used to demonstrate the effectiveness of CDP framework in a portable fire extinguisher manufacturing company. To facilitate the CDP application, we proposed the system coupling level index (SCLI) and simulation to evaluate the process layout design concepts. Findings: As part of the CDP framework application, three process layout design concepts - current layout (CL), express lane layout (ELL) and independent zone layout (IZL) - were generated. Then, the SCLI excluded CL and simulation selected IZL as the best concept. The simulation was also applied to optimize the performance of IZL {{in terms of the}} number of <b>pallets.</b> <b>Based</b> on this case study, we concluded that CDP framework worked well. Research limitations/implications: The process layout design optimization issue has not been well addressed in the VSM literature. We believe that this paper initiated the relevant discussion by showing the feasibility of CDP as a framework in this issue. Practical implications: The CDP and SCLI are very practice-oriented approaches in the sense that they do not require any complex analytical knowledge.

This thesis presents a teaching job shop control system for running in assembly laboratories at {{colleges and universities in}} preparing Industrial Engineering students for challenges faced in real-world factories. Current techniques fail to encompass this idea of training for students like the proposed method does. Microsoft Access was used in creating a database that is the center point in this new system. Inventory is managed using this database system and added if parts are created in the manufacturing lab and moved to the assembly area. The system will stop if parts are low until new parts are created. In this new system, a pallet with an unfinished product on it moves down a conveyor system until it reaches the next workstation. At this station, the station operator scans a barcode on the pallet. This barcode contains what product is on this <b>pallet.</b> <b>Based</b> on this information, an ordered list of tasks appears on the workstation computer screen and must be done before the pallet can be moved on. When all tasks have been completed at a station, the station operator clicks “done ” on the screen and then can either move to the next pallet or end the run. Statistics are kept {{on the quality of the}} final products and parts as well as on work-in-process and on a goal percentage of good products out at the end of a one-hour time frame.

To fulfill production objectives and {{win in the}} competitive environment of mass customization, proper deign and control of handling and locating pallet systems have been highly concerned. Minimization of energy, waste, and time are important keys in a pallet system design according to the lean, green, and agile philosophies. This thesis work focuses on these objectives and establishes a framework to design and control a pallet system according to the mentioned philosophies. In this framework, evaluation and synthesis methods are combined to maximize precision and minimize time of the design stages. For the evaluation method, a pallet system universal model to evaluate {{a wide range of}} possible design architectures and control strategies is introduced and developed. The great number of configurable parameters in this model provides a precise insight on the system analysis in transition and steady states. However, the precise analysis is often paid by massive evaluation time. To reduce the time, furthermore, mixed integer linear programming models are employed to synthesize optimal initial values of the configurable parameters according to some design assumptions. A systematic approach to construct the linear mathematical constraints characterizing the universal model in steady states is established. Moreover, mathematical models of the lean structure and the drive unit energy consumption are derived and used as design objectives in the optimization models. Both optimization and universal models are devised in a case study where a pallet system is designed based on a specific technology called X 85. The results of this study indicate the crucial impact of the framework on lean, green, and agile design of pallet systems. This framework is also shown to be enhanced by resolving the time complexity, which may occur in the optimization models due to the binary characteristics of some decision variables and objective functions nonlinearity...|$|R

40|$|Modern {{manufacturing}} systems face ever-increasing {{pressure to}} maximize efficiency of production processes, minimize downtime due to unexpected deviations from normal operation, and maintain agility in dynamic market conditions. Detailed, real-time asset tracking {{is essential for}} achieving these goals. Pallets are widely-used for transporting raw materials, intermediate products, and final products in automated assembly and manufacturing lines. A sophisticated pallet monitoring system can provide possibilities for optimizing pallet routing in real time, enable dynamic scheduling changes, and historical traceability required for error diagnosis and repair. Traditionally, pallets are monitored by networks of sensors, such as RFID readers or proximity sensors to collect location data. These sensor networks are rarely dense enough to provide precise continuous data about pallet location. Real-time pallet tracking data is thus limited to recording timestamps at static checkpoints. This thesis presents an asset-aware management tool for continuous <b>pallet</b> location monitoring <b>based</b> on event logs obtained from intelligent wireless devices embedded in each pallet. Each wireless device, equipped with a 3 -axis accelerometer and a 3 -axis gyroscope, provides accurate information about pallet movement. The raw sensor data is pre-processed into an event stream, which is sent to a server over a 6 LoWPAN network. The software developed in this research implements an algorithm for processing event logs to determine exact pallet location using artificial intelligence techniques. Calculated pallet position can be provided to high-level enterprise systems, and to manufacturing execution systems for use in scheduling, routing, and visualization of the production line. Designing the SCADA system was also part of this thesis. The solution was successfully deployed in the FASTory, a 12 -cell light assembly line in the Factory Automation Systems and Technologies Laboratory (FAST-lab.) at Tampere University of Technology, as part of eSONIA, a European Commission-cofunded research project on using service-enabled embedded devices for realizing an asset-aware, self-recovering plant.

40|$|An {{automated}} {{material handling}} system {{is a collection of}} electro mechanical components, electronics, and computer-based devices that act together to maintain flow of parts and materials in a modern production environment. Material flow is a significant factor in the design of manufacturing plants. Failure to fully integrate handling devices in a manufacturing plant results in a huge waste of production time, space, resources, and energy. To prevent this failure, this thesis work establishes a framework to design and control an automated {{material handling system}} according to the sustainable production philosophy. Conceptual and detailed design activities are established in the framework to fulfill the philosophy objectives. In the conceptual design phase, an evaluation method and a synthesis method are combined to maximize precision and minimize time of the design procedure. For the evaluation method, a universal model to concurrently evaluate a wide range of possible design architectures and control strategies for an automated material handling system is introduced and developed in Colored Petri Net (CPN) tool. A great number of configurable parameters in this model provides a precise insight into transition and stationary analysis of an automated material handling mechanism. However, the precise analysis is often paid by massive evaluation time. To reduce the time, furthermore, mixed integer linear programming models are employed to synthesize initial values of the configurable parameters according to lean, green, and agile issues. In the detailed design phase, a sustainable design and control of pallet systems is the main concern in the thesis work. Given a complex pallet system, a procedure to decompose the system into some simple loops (zones) for the design analysis is introduced. Then, a generic design framework for a one-loop <b>pallet</b> system (zone) <b>based</b> on optimization models is established. The constraints in the models characterize conditions on smooth running, energy reduction, dynamic and cyclic behavior, parts scheduling, conservation of the number of pallets, and buffer capacities for a one-loop pallet system. Moreover, the objective functions realize sustainable design issues such as minimum energy consumption, minimal chain tension force, and minimum number of pallets and buffer sizes. Two examples are presented to show applications of the developed framework for sustainable design and control of pallet systems...|$|R
