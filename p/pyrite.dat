40|$|We report {{sensitive}} high mass resolution ion microprobe, stable isotopes (SHRIMP SI) multiple sulfur isotope analyses (32 S, 33 S, 34 S) {{to constrain}} {{the sources of}} sulfur in three Archean VMS deposits—Teutonic Bore, Bentley, and Jaguar—from the Teutonic Bore volcanic complex of the Yilgarn Craton, Western Australia, together with sedimentary <b>pyrites</b> from associated black shales and interpillow <b>pyrites.</b> The <b>pyrites</b> from VMS mineralization are dominated by mantle sulfur but include {{a small amount of}} slightly negative mass-indepen-dent fractionation (MIF) anomalies, whereas sulfur from the <b>pyrites</b> in the sedimentary rocks has pronounced positive MIF, with ∆ 33 S values that lie between 0. 19 and 6. 20 ‰ (with one outlier at – 1. 62 ‰). The wall rocks to the mineralization include sedimentary rocks that have contributed no detectable positive MIF sulfur to the VMS deposits, which is difficult to reconcile with the leaching model for the formation of these deposits. The sulfur isotope data are best explained by mixing between sulfur derived from a magmatic-hydrothermal fluid and seawater sulfur as represented by the interpillow <b>pyrites.</b> The massive sulfide lens <b>pyrites</b> have a weighted mean ∆ 33 S value of – 0. 27 ± 0. 05 ‰ (MSWD = 1. 6) nearly identical with – 0. 31 ± 0. 08 ‰ (MSWD = 2. 4) for <b>pyrites</b> from the stringer zone, which requires mixing to have occurred below the sea floor.

5|$|The {{process of}} pumping {{water from the}} mines {{introduces}} oxygen via aeration, thereby oxidising the rock's <b>pyrite.</b> <b>Pyrite</b> contains sulfur, and one consequence of its oxidation is the introduction of significant amounts of sulphates into mine water. This has had {{a negative impact on}} water quality in five lakes in the Kurtna Lake District. In some lakes, sulphate levels have increased tens of times compared to the pre-mining period. Suspended mineral matter in the mine water pumped into these lakes has changed the composition of the lakes' sediments. However, it has been found that this disturbance diminishes over time; studies show that sulphates and iron in mining water decrease to levels that meet drinking water quality standards about five years after mine closure.|$|E

40|$|Seventeenth-century {{physician}} Martin Lister is {{best known}} for his work in natural history and participation in the early Royal Society. However, little attention has been focused upon Lister's work in chemistry, the most salient examples being his analysis of <b>pyrites</b> or "fools' gold" near mineral springs in the De Fonbibus medicatis Angliae Exercitatio of 1684 (Exercises on the healing springs of England), his contributions to the Philosophical Transactions in the 1670 s and 1680 s, and his unpublished manuscript " A Method for the History of Iron, Imperfect. " He defined <b>pyrites</b> more specifically as " ironstone marcasites" which were "nothing else but a body of iron disguised under a vitriolic varnish"; "vitriol" referred to iron (II) sulfate which occurred as a weathering product of <b>pyrites.</b> This paper demonstrates that an understanding of Lister's work on <b>pyrites</b> and vitriol is best attained by placing him in the intellectual context of the seventeenth-century chemical debate about minerallogenesis. Lister believed that the volatile exhalations of <b>pyrites</b> and its vitriol in the air were important in the transformation of matter, and he subscribed to the sixteenth-and seventeenth-century theory of witterung (weathering) or ore exhalations as an explanation for the formation of minerals. Despite his allegiance to the theories of witterung, I will illustrate that Lister made use of his interests in natural history to go one step beyond them, postulating that the sulfurous exhalations from <b>pyrites</b> were responsible for the heating of hot springs, as well as meteorological and geological effects...|$|R
5|$|Cobalt in {{compound}} form {{occurs as}} a minor component of copper and nickel minerals. It is the major metallic component in combination with sulfur and arsenic in the sulfidic cobaltite (CoAsS), safflorite (CoAs2), glaucodot ((Co,Fe)AsS), and skutterudite (CoAs3) minerals. The mineral cattierite is similar to <b>pyrite</b> and occurs together with vaesite in the copper deposits of the Katanga Province. Upon contact with the atmosphere, weathering occurs and the sulfide minerals oxidize to form pink erythrite ("cobalt glance": Co3(AsO4)2·8H2O) and spherocobaltite (CoCO3).|$|E

5|$|More {{sophisticated}} classification {{arrangements were}} proposed by Pseudo-Geber (in the Geber corpus, c. 1310), Paracelsus (De Natura Rerum libri nonem, 1525–6; and later works), Basil Valentine (Conclusiones, 1624), and Boerhaave (Elementa Chemiæ, 1733).

5|$|Significant {{amounts of}} iron {{occur in the}} iron sulfide mineral <b>pyrite</b> (FeS2), but it is {{difficult}} to extract iron from it and it is therefore not used. In fact, iron is so common that production generally focuses only on ores with very high quantities of it.

Both of these are oxidized in aqueous solution and precipitate in even mildly elevated pH as iron(III) oxide.|$|E

5|$|However, the peels will degrade {{over time}} if they contain any iron sulfide (<b>pyrite</b> or marcasite). Shya Chitaley {{addressed}} {{this problem by}} revising the liquid-peel technique to separate the organic material preserved by the coal ball from the inorganic minerals, including iron sulfide. This allows the peel to retain its quality for a longer time. Chitaley's revisions begin after grinding {{the surface of the}} coal ball to a smooth finish. Her process essentially entails heating and then making multiple applications of solutions of paraffin in xylene to the coal ball. Each subsequent application has a greater concentration of paraffin in xylene to allow the wax to completely pervade the coal ball. Nitric acid, and then acetone, are applied to the coal ball. Following that, the process merges back into the liquid peel technique.|$|E
5|$|In 1863, the German chemists Ferdinand Reich and Hieronymous Theodor Richter were testing ores {{from the}} mines around Freiberg, Saxony. They {{dissolved}} the minerals <b>pyrite,</b> arsenopyrite, galena and sphalerite in hydrochloric acid and distilled raw zinc chloride. Reich, who was color-blind, employed Richter {{as an assistant}} for detecting the colored spectral lines. Knowing that ores from that region sometimes contain thallium, they searched for the green thallium emission spectrum lines. Instead, they found a bright blue line. Because that blue line did not match any known element, they hypothesized a new element was present in the minerals. They named the element indium, from the indigo color seen in its spectrum, after the Latin indicum, meaning 'of India'.|$|E
