The hammer is first driven down {{to strike the}} back and then back up to return the hammer to the original position to repeat the cycle. The effectiveness of the jackhammer is dependent on how much {{force is applied to}} the tool. It is generally used like a hammer to break the hard surface or rock in construction works and it is not considered under earth moving equipment, along with its accessories (i.e., <b>pusher</b> <b>leg,</b> lubricator).|$|E
40|$|The {{main focus}} of this diploma paper was {{to find out the}} {{connection}} between flat feet and the <b>pushing</b> <b>leg.</b> 158 students who go to Pirniče elementary school from the second to the ninth class are included in the research as the test group. We determined individual's level of flat feet using plantograms {{with the help of the}} Clark method. We determined the <b>pushing</b> <b>leg</b> using several variables which were: the length of the foot, the perimeter and the skin fold of the shin as well as jump and triple jump with one-leg push-off using the arms and not using them. We arranged all of the data into tables in Excel and then processed them statistically with SPSS. We calculated the frequency, relative frequency and the basic statistics. Using the chi-square test we gathered the data about the connection between the <b>pushing</b> <b>leg</b> and flat feet. The analysis of the variance showed the difference between the <b>pushing</b> <b>leg</b> and Clark angle of the right and left leg. We concluded that there are differences in flatness between the right and the left foot, whereby right feet were proven to be more healthy. After processing all the variables which determine the <b>pushing</b> <b>leg</b> it was shown that a few more individuals use the right <b>leg</b> to <b>push</b> off instead of the left leg. On the one hand, the analysis of the variance proved that among <b>pushing</b> <b>legs,</b> there exist statistically characteristic differences in the flatness of the right foot and the left one. One the other hand, the chi-square test showed that there are no major statistical differences which would point out the connection between the <b>pushing</b> <b>leg</b> and better feet considering Clark angle. ...|$|R

We edited the data obtained by using Excel and analyzed them with SPSS. For all variables were calculated frequencies and relative frequencies. Using the chi-square test, we determined the correlation between <b>pushing</b> <b>leg</b> and better feet by using Casino’s and Clark’s method.

50|$|The classic speedskating {{technique}} is an alternating cycle of inside-edge pushes and outer-edge glides. The cycle starts as the skater is gliding on one (let us suppose the right) leg with a bent knee. He then straightens (extends) the right knee and hip while leaning to the left. The {{direction of the}} push is therefore outwards (rightwards) {{from the center of}} mass. When the <b>pushing</b> <b>leg</b> reaches full extension he sets down the left (now support) leg and glides on it while picking up the right leg and bringing it back behind and underneath him (recovery) ready to be placed on the ground (set down) and become the new support <b>leg.</b> Once the <b>pushing</b> <b>leg</b> has been recovered, the support <b>leg</b> <b>pushes</b> out in the other direction and the cycle repeats. Note that the pushes are always in a lateral direction: the left <b>leg</b> <b>pushes</b> exclusively leftwards, and the right leg exclusively rightwards.|$|R

Thigh muscle volume of 68 independently living older women (mean age 77. 6 years) was measured via magnetic resonance imaging. Isometric strength was assessed for leg extension in a movement laboratory in sitting position with the knee flexed at 90 ° and for hand grip. Maximum and habitual gait speed was measured on an electronic walk way. Leg muscle power was measured during single <b>leg</b> <b>push</b> and during sit-to-stand performance. Thigh muscle volume was associated with sit-to-stand performance power (r = 0. 628), <b>leg</b> <b>push</b> power (r = 0. 550), isometric quadriceps strength (r = 0. 442), hand grip strength (r = 0. 367), fast gait speed (r = 0. 291), habitual gait speed (r = 0. 256), body mass index (r = 0. 411) and age (r = - 0. 392).

50|$|The {{basic body}} plan of a {{horseshoe}} crab {{consists of three}} parts: the prosoma, the opisthosoma and the telson. The prosoma is the dome-shaped part at the front. The marginally-spined middle is called the opisthosoma, and the rear extension {{that looks like a}} spike is the telson, which is commonly described as the tail. The telson is used to turn itself right side up when overturned. The mangrove horseshoe crab grows up to 40 centimeters in length (including the tail), and its whole body is protected by a hard, dark brown carapace. Uncommon for chelicerates, horseshoe crabs have two compound eyes. The main function of these compound eyes is to find a mate. In addition, they have two median eyes, two rudimentary lateral eyes, and an endoparietal eye on their carapace and two ventral eyes located on the underside by the mouth. Scientists believe the two ventral eyes aid in the orientation of the horseshoe crab when swimming. Each individual has six pairs of appendages. The first pair, the chelicerae, is used to place food in its mouth. The next pair of legs are the pedipalps, which are used for walking. The rest of the legs are used for locomotion and are known as <b>pusher</b> <b>legs.</b> Located behind their legs are book gills. These gills are used for propulsion to swim and to exchange respiratory gases.|$|R
