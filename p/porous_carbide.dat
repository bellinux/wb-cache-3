40|$|The {{simulation}} of infusion of molten reactive metals (e. g., yttrium) into a <b>porous,</b> <b>carbide</b> packed bed to create carbide and boride composites was studied at ultrahigh temperatures (3 ̆e 1700 °C). The infusion was investigated through a {{computational fluid dynamic}} (CFD) system of capillary pores and compared to a predicted analytical calculation formulated by Selmak and Rhines. Simulations of two-phase flow penetration of yttrium into a packed bed of B 4 C were investigated and compared with titanium, zirconium, hafnium, and samarium liquids. The non-reactive, liquid metal infusion was primarily driven by the surface tension and viscosity. The liquid metal depth and rate of penetration were determined and predicted at their respective melting temperature to 2450 °C. Along with these simulations and {{with the knowledge of}} the thermophysical properties of each element, titanium shows the highest rate of penetration and yttrium shows the lowest rate at their respective melting temperatures. However, once the temperature starts to increase and the elements are observed at the same isothermal temperature, yttrium begins to overtake the other elements in terms of depth and rate of penetration. ...|$|E
