2500|$|Sara starts {{stalking}} Emily. It {{is later}} revealed {{that on the}} night 'A' was revealed, after Emily punched Sara, Sara tried {{to stand up and}} <b>put</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> an electrical block, severely injuring her hands and making it difficult for her to touch or hold things. Eventually, a new 'A' rises, sending threatening messages with creep emojis to the Liars, determined to get answers on the night Charlotte was murdered. Convinced that Sara is 'Uber A', the girls search for answers. Ali reveals that she and Charlotte's doctor, Elliott, are dating. Later they are married by Aria. The girls initially suspect Aria killed Charlotte. The suspicion shifts to Ezra and then Byron. Later, the suspicion shifts to Melissa when Spencer discovers Melissa's suitcase is broken with the missing part matching the description of the alleged murder weapon. Emily eventually finds it and is nearly run over by a truck and the driver steals the weapon. To save Ezra from losing his book deal with Aria's publishing company, she decides to write and submit some chapters for Ezra's new book. She's forced to tell him and they finish it together.|$|E
60|$|Arthur {{came forward}} and Margaret <b>put</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> his shoulders.|$|E
60|$|Madeline {{went over}} to Alfred and <b>put</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> his shoulders.|$|E
60|$|Mary went out, and Mrs. Clibborn <b>put</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> Jamie's arm.|$|R
60|$|James got up, and <b>putting</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> his shoulders, {{she kissed}} him.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Merrill groaned. His wife {{rose and}} <b>put</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> his shoulder.|$|R
60|$|She {{came to him}} and <b>put</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> his shoulders, smiling bravely.|$|E
60|$|She <b>put</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> my {{shoulders}} and drew me down to kiss her.|$|E
60|$|She {{would stand}} {{up in front of}} him and <b>put</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> his {{shoulders}} and look into his face.|$|E
60|$|Fan moved near to her--near {{enough to}} <b>put</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> the other's arm.|$|R
60|$|Farnam {{presently}} {{went after}} him, and Mrs. Farnam <b>put</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> Agatha's arm.|$|R
60|$|There was no answer. Gwen {{went forward}} and <b>put</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> mother's knee.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Don't trouble then, I'll go. No, don't get up,' said Helena, {{trying to}} {{disengage}} herself. Louisa reached and <b>put</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> Helena's wrists.|$|E
60|$|The {{conversation}} languished. Ann <b>put</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> {{the top of}} the gate, {{and began}} a stationary hopping, a sort of ineffectual gymnastic experiment.|$|E
60|$|The {{mother looked}} down at the jagged, close-clipped head of her child. She <b>put</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> his hair, and stroked and fondled his head.|$|E
60|$|As I {{was turning}} away {{she got up}} quickly and <b>put</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> my shoulder.|$|R
60|$|Ruth {{rose from}} her seat to leave also, but Mysa <b>put</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> arm.|$|R
60|$|She <b>put</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> my mouth, {{and stopped}} me before I could say any more.|$|R
60|$|She paid no heed to me; {{she came}} back and <b>put</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> my {{shoulders}} and thoughtfully and sadly looked up in my face.|$|E
6000|$|Noel got up, and <b>put</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> her father's shoulders. [...] "Forgive me {{for all my}} badness, and all my badness to come, {{especially}} all my badness to come!" ...|$|E
60|$|Fan, without replying, {{sat down}} before her writing-case. The other {{paused at the}} door, and after hesitating a few moments came back and <b>put</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> the girl's shoulder.|$|E
60|$|MANGAN. But it isn't right. It--[Mrs Hushabye <b>puts</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> his mouth]. Oh, very well.|$|R
60|$|LAVINIA (<b>putting</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> {{the head}} of Androcles) The hand of God is on us three, Captain.|$|R
60|$|She shrank from him. Then {{she laughed}} and <b>put</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> his arm. He was merely a boy.|$|R
60|$|She had {{nodded to}} Andor, but by tacit consent {{they had not}} shaken hands. Klara now <b>put</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> her hips, and, like a young animal let free after days of captivity, she drew in deep breaths of sweet-scented air.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{have the}} arms of Louisa always round my neck,' came her voice, like the cry of a cat. She <b>put</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> her throat as if she must relieve an ache. He saw her lip raised {{in a kind of}} disgust, a revulsion from life. She was very sick after the tragedy.|$|E
6000|$|... "I will do {{anything}} you tell me," [...] she answered. [...] "If Mrs. Payson comes tomorrow, you won't let her take me away? Thank you. Goodnight." [...] She <b>put</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> his shoulders, with innocent familiarity, and lifted herself to him on tiptoe, and kissed him as a sister might have kissed him.|$|E
60|$|George gave a cry and {{sinking into}} a chair, burst into tears. Lucy <b>put</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> his shoulder.|$|R
60|$|LADY CICELY (rising {{quickly and}} <b>putting</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> his arm). Take care. You mustn't strike an old man.|$|R
60|$|Mrs George {{left alone}} with Hotchkiss and Soames, {{suddenly}} <b>puts</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> Soames's shoulders and bends over him.|$|R
60|$|Virginia said nothing. It was in {{her blood}} as well as his. The Colonel had left his young wife, to fight in Mexico; he had come home to lay flowers on her grave. She knew that he thought of this; and, too, that his heart was rent at leaving her. She <b>put</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> his shoulders, and he stooped to kiss her {{trembling}} lips.|$|E
6000|$|Kate's eyes {{suddenly}} grew dim. [...] "Morton, I {{brought this}} on you, and I'm beginning to doubt. I don't believe I {{want you to}} go with her, after all." [...] She <b>put</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> his shoulders and gave way to a feeling of loss and loneliness. [...] "I've always hoped--I've always looked forward to your having a splendid, dignified wife; and though I like her. I don't believe--she's up to you." ...|$|E
60|$|On {{our return}} from that {{expedition}} we came gliding {{into the old}} harbour so late that Dominic and I, making for the café kept by Madame Léonore, found it empty of customers, except for two rather sinister fellows playing cards together at a corner table near the door. The first thing done by Madame Léonore was to <b>put</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> Dominic’s shoulders and look at arm’s length {{into the eyes of}} that man of audacious deeds and wild stratagems who smiled straight at her from under his heavy and, at that time, uncurled moustaches.|$|E
6000|$|Nevertheless, {{he showed}} the signs of thought, and badly; for after dinner Sylvia, <b>putting</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> his forehead, said: ...|$|R
60|$|The {{expression}} of pain which had troubled him crossed her face again, and she <b>put</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> his shoulder.|$|R
60|$|After which valediction {{she slowly}} climbed the stairs, <b>putting</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> knee at each step, with the effort.|$|R
