40|$|During past decades, many {{automated}} software faults diagnosis techniques including Spectrum-Based Fault Localization (SBFL) {{have been}} proposed to improve the efficiency of software debugging activity. In the field of SBFL, suspiciousness calculation {{is closely related to}} the number of failed and <b>passed</b> <b>test</b> cases. Studies have shown that the ratio of the number of failed and <b>passed</b> <b>test</b> case has more significant impact on the accuracy of SBFL than the total number of test cases, and a balanced test suite is more beneficial to improving the accuracy of SBFL. Based on theoretical analysis, we proposed an PNF (<b>Passed</b> <b>test</b> cases, Not execute Faulty statement) strategy to reduce test suite and build up a more balanced one for SBFL, which can be used in regression testing. We evaluated the strategy making experiments using the Siemens program and Space program. Experiments indicated that our PNF strategy can be used to construct a new test suite effectively. Compared with the original test suite, the new one has smaller size (average 90 % test case was reduced in experiments) and more balanced ratio of failed <b>test</b> cases to <b>passed</b> <b>test</b> cases, while it has the same statement coverage and fault localization accuracy...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Statistical fault {{localization}} techniques {{analyze the}} dynamic program {{information provided by}} executing {{a large number of}} test cases to predict fault positions in faulty programs. Related studies show that the extent of imbalance between the number of <b>passed</b> <b>test</b> cases and that of failed test cases may reduce the effectiveness of such techniques, while failed test cases can frequently be less than <b>passed</b> <b>test</b> cases in practice. In this study, we propose a strategy to generate balanced test suite by cloning the failed test cases for suitable number of times {{to catch up with the}} number of <b>passed</b> <b>test</b> cases. We further give an analysis to show that by carrying out the cloning the effectiveness of two representative fault localization techniques can be improved under certain conditions and impaired at no time.

40|$|Software {{ships with}} known bugs {{because it is}} {{expensive}} to pinpoint and fix the bug exposed by a failing test. To {{reduce the cost of}} bug identification, we locate expressions that are likely causes of bugs and thus candidates for repair. Our symbolic method approximates an ideal approach to fixing bugs mechanically, which is to search the space of all edits to the program for one that repairs the failing test without breaking any <b>passing</b> <b>test.</b> We approximate the expensive ideal of exploring syntactic edits by instead computing the set of values whose substitution for the expression corrects the execution. We observe that an expression is a repair candidate if it can be replaced with a value that fixes a failing test and in each <b>passing</b> <b>test,</b> its value can be changed to another value without breaking the test. The latter condition makes the expression flexible in that it permits multiple values. The key observation is that the repair of a flexible expression is less likely to break a <b>passing</b> <b>test.</b> The method is called angelic debugging because the values are computed by angelically nondeterministic statements. We implemented the method on top of the Java PathFinder model checker. Our experiments with this technique show promise of its applicability in speeding up program debugging...|$|R
