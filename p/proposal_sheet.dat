40|$|Cut {{and fill}} works around the slopes are common scenes. Hence, slope {{stability}} analysis must {{be carried out}} in order to assure the slope is safe and prevent the slope failure. In this study, software application approach by GEOSTUDIO 2007 (SLOPE/W) is used for the case study, an under-going secondary school project which is located at Song, Sarawak. A portion of the slope where is being constructed on a cut and fill area has failed. The failed slope is modelled first by using SEEP/W (as parent file) and then, by SLOPE/W, to generate the Factor of Safety (FOS), which is obtained at 0. 854. The proposed remedial works are subsequently determined by using sheet piles and soil nails. The obtained FOS is at 1. 362 and 1. 021 respectively. Therefore, the <b>proposal</b> using <b>sheet</b> piles is more acceptable...|$|R

WMDH has supported Corey throughout his career, and I wanted to design a radio promotion that would help both WMDH and Corey reach a young audience. I {{was inspired by a}} national promotion by Verizon Wireless featuring country artist Taylor Swift. Therefore, I created the "Bring Corey Cox to My School" contest. Local high school students send text messages to the station to enter the contest. One winner is chosen, and Corey Cox will perform live in concert at the winner's high school. My attempt to execute this promotion is presented along with promotion <b>proposals,</b> sales <b>sheets,</b> various correspondences, project rationale, and a contest proposal and promotions checklist for WCRD.

50|$|Improving web {{presentation}} capabilities was a {{topic of}} interest to many in the web community and nine different style sheet languages were proposed on the www-style mailing list. Of these nine proposals, two were especially influential on what became CSS: Cascading HTML Style Sheets and Stream-based Style <b>Sheet</b> <b>Proposal</b> (SSP). Two browsers served as testbeds for the initial proposals; Lie worked with Yves Lafon to implement CSS in Dave Raggett's Arena browser. Bert Bos implemented his own SSP proposal in the Argo browser. Thereafter, Lie and Bos worked together to develop the CSS standard (the 'H' {{was removed from the}} name because these style sheets could also be applied to other markup languages besides HTML).|$|R
25|$|When Pauling and Corey first {{proposed}} the alpha sheet, {{they suggested that}} it agreed well with fiber diffraction results from beta-keratin fibers. However, since the alpha sheet {{did not appear to}} be energetically favorable, they argued that beta sheets would occur more commonly among normal proteins, and subsequent demonstration that beta-keratin is made of beta sheets consigned the alpha <b>sheet</b> <b>proposal</b> to obscurity. Recently the alpha strand conformation has been observed in isolated instances in native state proteins as solved by X-ray crystallography or protein NMR, although an extended alpha sheet was not identified in any known natural protein. Native proteins identified as containing alpha-strand regions or alpha-sheet-patterned hydrogen bonding include synaptotagmin, lysozyme, and potassium channels, where the alpha-strands line the ion-conducting pore.|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} {{goal of the}} EU - Water Framework Directive (WFD) is to achieve a good chemical status of surface waters. According to Article 1 (c) "specific measures for the progressive reduction of discharges, emissions and losses of priority substances" must be implemented. For the priority hazardous substances, discharges, emissions and losses must be stopped or phasedout. Therefore {{the goal of this}} project was, on the one hand, to analyse the emission situation of the 33 priority substances and to work out propositions to limit emissions, taking particular account of the situation in Germany. On the other hand, the goal was to technically monitor and support the ongoing work at EU-level, including a juridical examination of the EU-Commission's <b>proposals.</b> Substance-specific data <b>sheets</b> were compiled for the 33 priority substances in order to present the information and data in a compact form. The relevance of the substances for Germany was evaluated based on the existing monitoring data, current use and emission situation. The important emission paths were analysed in detail for those substances relevant in Germany. Subsequently, national options for action were then identified and described...|$|R
40|$|Produced in {{co-operation}} with Unipub AS. The {{thesis is}} produced by Unipub AS merely {{in connection with the}} thesis defence. Kindly direct all inquiries regarding the thesis to the copyright holder or the unit which grants the doctorate. Unipub AS is owned by The University Foundation for Student Life (SiO) The topic of this thesis is style sheet languages for structured documents on the web. Due to characteristics of the web – including a screen-centric publishing model, a multitude of output devices, uncertain delivery, strong user preferences, and the possibility for later binding between content and style – the hypothesis is that the web calls for different style sheet languages than does traditional electronic publishing. Style sheet languages that were developed and used prior to the web are analyzed and compared with style <b>sheet</b> <b>proposals</b> for the web between 1993 - 1996. The dissertation describes the design of a web-centric style sheet language known as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). CSS has several notable features including: cascading, pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements, forward-compatible parsing rules, support for different media types, and a strong emphasis on selectors. Problems in CSS are analyzed, and recommended future research is described. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The lower 200 m of the Tertiary lava pile on Mull, western Scotland, {{consists}} {{mainly of}} small volume (0. 01 – 1 km 3), high-magnesian basaltic lava flows. Eruption of these flows probably occurred from fissures or point-source vents, producing pahoehoe-textured sheets averaging about 5 m in thickness. Certain lavas cropping out in northwest Mull greatly exceed this average thickness and may represent inflated pahoehoe flows akin to those described at Kilauea, Hawai’i. Structural {{features of a}} 16 – 30 m thick lava at Port Haunn, northwest Mull, that conform to this <b>proposal</b> include sub-horizontal <b>sheets</b> of amygdales up to 14 cm thick separated by amygdale-poor zones, pipe amygdales {{at the base of}} the flow and a low-relief flow top. Alternating olivine-rich and olivine-poor bands in the Port Haunn lava are suggestive of lava pulses during a continuous eruption, also consistent with inflation. Elsewhere in western Mull, there is evidence for filled lava tubes and pahoehoe toes, both of which are characteristic of inflated sheet flows formed on gentle ground slopes (< 4) and perhaps < 0. 5)). Fluid dynamical considerations suggest that each sheet flow in the lower part of the Mull lava sequence probably was active for a short period, permitting the build up of small lava fields over several months or years. This is commensurate with the small volume and limited areal extent of the Tertiary Mull lavas when compared to basalts in igneous provinces such as the Columbia River and Deccan...|$|R
