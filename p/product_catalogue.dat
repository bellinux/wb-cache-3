40|$|<b>Product</b> <b>catalogues</b> {{are usually}} {{represented}} as tables. They are regularly updated with new variants and, over time, {{various forms of}} inconsistencies or undesirable properties can be introduced, especially when global changes are made. We argue that by compiling <b>product</b> <b>catalogues</b> into decision diagrams we can support a number of highlevel queries for detecting and checking for various forms of inconsistency, as well as verifying other properties relevant for user interaction. In particular, a class of functional dependency-based inconsistencies can be detected efficiently. An example is verifying properties such as: “each identical configuration of a product has the same price”. This paper presents a number of algorithmic advances. We illustrate the usefulness of our approach by evaluating these high-level properties over realworld publicly available <b>product</b> <b>catalogues...</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{functional}} dependency {{is a logical}} relationship amongst the attributes that define a table of data. Specifically, a {{functional dependency}} holds when the values of {{a subset of the}} attributes in a dataset determine the values of one or more other attributes. Uncovering such dependencies is utilized in many domains, such as database design. We demonstrate that it can also be utilized in a recommendation context when datasets represent <b>product</b> <b>catalogues.</b> State-of-the-art approaches to discovering functional dependencies require a tabular representation of the data. However, <b>product</b> <b>catalogues</b> can sometimes be defined implicitly, for example, as a set of solutions to a combinatorial problem. Such combinatorial catalogues can have {{a very large number of}} products, thus making standard approaches to uncovering functional dependencies inapplicable. In this paper we present the first approach to computing functional dependencies over compiled knowledge representations which can often be small even for huge catalogues. In particular, we develop efficient algorithms that operate over decision diagrams, which allow us to handle catalogues that are out of reach for current approaches. We apply our algorithms to tabular and combinatorial benchmarks and detect a number of properties that could be considered as anomalies in <b>product</b> <b>catalogues...</b>|$|R

40|$|Research in {{interoperability}} {{of electronic}} <b>product</b> <b>catalogues</b> has primarily focused on resolving semantic conflicts arisen from the heterogeneously designed electronic <b>product</b> <b>catalogues.</b> We argue that while existing integration strategies providing static connections between various heterogeneous catalogues over mediating ontologies, ontologies themselves exhibit heterogeneity {{and lack of}} evolvability. What’s more, reclassifying terms to link public ontologies {{is very difficult to}} avoid inaccuracy problem that is critical to electronic commerce. This paper highlights the problems of flexibility, exactness and evolvability that have received little attention in the literature and provides an overview of the concept exchange approach to interoperability. It illustrates why this is able to better solve the identified problems, presents the different features compared with other approaches and suggests how the concept exchange framework is working. 1...|$|R
