50|$|Conventional therapy {{aimed at}} tidal volumes (Vt) of 12-15 ml/kg (where the weight is ideal body weight rather than actual weight). Recent {{studies have shown}} that high tidal volumes can overstretch alveoli {{resulting}} in volutrauma (secondary lung injury). The ARDS Clinical Network, or ARDSNet, completed a trial that showed improved mortality when ventilated with a tidal volume of 6 ml/kg compared to the traditional 12 ml/kg. Low tidal volumes (Vt) may cause hypercapnia and atelectasis because of their inherent tendency to increase physiologic shunt. <b>Physiologic</b> <b>dead</b> <b>space</b> cannot change as it is ventilation without perfusion.

40|$|In the {{previous}} issue of Critical Care, {{a new study}} reports that elevated pulmonary dead space is superior to measures of oxygenation (arterial partial pressure of oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen, or PaO 2 /FiO 2) for predicting physiologic and clinical responses to the prone position in patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (PaO 2 /FiO 2 of less than 100 mm Hg) [1]. In addition, the authors found that a decrease in arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO 2) was superior to indices of oxygenation as a method for identifying responders to prone positioning. Also, the authors reported that a recently proposed method to estimate <b>physiologic</b> <b>dead</b> <b>space</b> {{did not have the}} same prognostic value as a direct measurement of <b>physiologic</b> <b>dead</b> <b>space</b> [2]...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Anatomic <b>dead</b> <b>space</b> (also called airway or {{tracheal}} <b>dead</b> <b>space)</b> is {{the part}} of the tidal volume that does not participate in gas exchange. Some contemporary ventilation protocols, such as the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Network protocol, call for smaller tidal volumes than were traditionally delivered. With smaller tidal volumes, the percentage of each delivered breath that is wasted in the anatomic <b>dead</b> <b>space</b> is greater than it is with larger tidal volumes. Many respiratory and medical textbooks state that anatomic <b>dead</b> <b>space</b> can be estimated from the patient’s weight by assuming there is approximately 1 mL of <b>dead</b> <b>space</b> for every pound of body weight. With a volumetric capnography monitor that measures on-airway flow and CO 2, the anatomic <b>dead</b> <b>space</b> can be automatically and directly measured with the Fowler method, in which <b>dead</b> <b>space</b> equals the exhaled volume up to the point when CO 2 rises above a threshold. METH-ODS: We analyzed data from 58 patients (43 male, 15 female) to assess the accuracy of 5 anatomic <b>dead</b> <b>space</b> estimation methods. Anatomic <b>dead</b> <b>space</b> was measured during the first 10 min of monitoring and compared to the estimates. RESULTS: The coefficient of determination (r 2) be-tween the anatomic <b>dead</b> <b>space</b> estimate based on body weight and the measured anatomic <b>dead</b> <b>space</b> was r 2 0. 0002. The mean SD error between the body weight estimate and the measured <b>dead</b> <b>space</b> was 60 54 mL. CONCLUSIONS: It appears that the anatomic <b>dead</b> <b>space</b> estimate methods were sufficient when used (as originally intended) together with other assumptions to identify a starting point in a ventilation algorithm, but the poor agreement between an individual patient’s measured and estimated anatomic <b>dead</b> <b>space</b> contradicts the assumption that <b>dead</b> <b>space</b> can be predicted from actual or ideal weight alone.

50|$|The {{success of}} <b>Dead</b> <b>Space</b> {{has led to}} {{additional}} games, films and print media. In September 2009, Dead Space: Extraction was released for the Wii, a prequel to <b>Dead</b> <b>Space.</b> <b>Dead</b> <b>Space</b> 2 was released on January 25, 2011, for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and Windows, with Isaac reprising {{his role as the}} protagonist. <b>Dead</b> <b>Space</b> for iOS was released on iTunes on Jan 14, 2011 and takes place 3 years after the first <b>Dead</b> <b>Space</b> game.

40|$|Increased {{pulmonary}} artery pressure, {{an increase in}} pulmonary vascular resistance {{and an increase in}} <b>physiologic</b> <b>dead</b> <b>space</b> are consistent findings in patients with post-traumatic respiratory distress. Since mannitol has been shown to decrease renal vascular resistance following trauma, the effect of a bolus injection of 100 ml of 25 % solution of this drug on pulmonary hemodynamics and <b>physiologic</b> <b>dead</b> <b>space</b> was investigated in 11 patients who had suffered multiple trauma. Five minutes after the injection, pulmonary vascular resistance fell (p less than. 01), cardiac index increased (p less than. 001) and <b>physiologic</b> <b>dead</b> <b>space</b> decreased (p less than. 05). In contrast, the administration of 40 mg of furosemide produced no significant change in any of these parameters. Mannitol rapidly equilibrates in the extracellular space and exerts an osmotic effect across cell membranes. We postulate that the beneficial response to mannitol on the pulmonary vascular resistance and the improved perfusion of ventilated regions of the lung is due to a reduction in cell swelling and is not explainable by its diuretic effect. Improvement in the distribution of perfusion of pulmonary blood flow by mannitol may be a useful aid in the treatment of the post-traumatic form of the respiratory distress syndrome...|$|E
40|$|We {{studied a}} 58 -year-old woman during an acute episode of cardiac {{pulmonary}} edema complicated by carbon dioxide (CO 2) retention. As pulmonary wedge pressure became greater, metabolic production of CO 2 increased by 38 ml/min and minute ventilation by 1. 53 L; by contrast, alveolar ventilation remained unchanged {{due to a}} concomitant rise in <b>physiologic</b> <b>dead</b> <b>space</b> and, as a result, arterial CO 2 tension increased up to 61 mm Hg. With treatment, all these variables returned to baseline values. Subsequent measurement of mouth occlusion pressure (p 0. 1) during a CO 2 rebreathing trial showed that neuromuscular inspiratory drive response to CO 2 was preserved, but that ventilatory response was markedly reduced, presumably because of the severe restrictive and obstructive ventilatory defect and {{of the loss of}} inspiratory muscle force demonstrated in the patient. We conclude that CO 2 retention in cardiac pulmonary edema involves a combination of: (1) increased CO 2 production, (2) rise in <b>physiologic</b> <b>dead</b> <b>space,</b> and (3) severe respiratory mechanical impairment.

40|$|Objective  To compare <b>physiologic</b> <b>dead</b> <b>space</b> (VD) and <b>physiologic</b> <b>dead</b> <b>space</b> to {{tidal volume}} (VT) ratio (VD/VT) {{obtained}} by an automated single breath test for carbon dioxide (CO 2) (method SBT) and a manual calculation (method MC) in ventilated healthy dogs. Study design  Prospective clinical study. Animals  Twenty client-owned dogs, ASA I and II undergoing anaesthesia for clinical purposes. Methods  Following pre-medication, induction of anaesthesia, and intubation of the trachea, intermittent positive pressure ventilation was commenced. Mixed expired CO 2 partial pressure (PēCO 2) {{was measured by}} two methods: method MC by analysis, using an infrared capnograph, of the expired gas collected in a mixing box and method SBT which calculated it automatically by a device consisting of a mainstream capnograph and a pneumotachograph. At four time points arterial partial pressure of CO 2 (PaCO 2) was measured. <b>Physiologic</b> <b>dead</b> <b>space</b> variables (VD and VD/VT) were calculated manually (method MC) or automatically (method SBT) using the Bohr–Enghoff equation. Method MC and SBT were compared using Bland–Altman plots and linear regression. Intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) {{was used to measure}} consistency of each method. Results  Four measurement pairs were obtained in all 20 dogs for method SBT and MC. The bias was − 1. 15 mmHg, 7. 97 mL and 0. 02 for PēCO 2, VD and VD/VT, respectively. Linear regression analysis revealed a correlation coefficient (r 2) of 0. 79, 0. 94, and 0. 83 for PēCO 2, VD and VD/VT, respectively. The ICC revealed an excellent consistency for both methods. Conclusions  The single breath test (SBT) can be used for clinical evaluation of VD and VD/VT in anaesthetized ventilated dogs. Clinical relevance  Through measuring VD and VD/VT important information about lung ventilation can be obtained and the SBT is an easy method to use for this purpose...|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of reticuloendothelial (RE) blockade on the pulmonary hemodynamic and gas exchange response to thrombin induced low-grade intravascular coagulation was studied in dogs during fibrinolytic inhibition. Neither saline infusion nor experimentally induced RE blockade significantly increased pulmonary vascular resistance, <b>physiologic</b> <b>dead</b> <b>space,</b> or pulmonary venous admixture. Intravascular coagulation {{in the absence}} of RE blockade resulted in a significant (p less than 0. 05) elevation in pulmonary vascular resistance which was transient and returned to prechallenge levels over a two to four hour period. This response was not associated with any significant change in physiological dead space. In contrast, intravascular coagulation in the presence of RE blockade resulted in significant (p less than 0. 05) hemodynamic and gas exchange abnormalities. These included an acute elevation in pulmonary vascular resistance, a decrease in arterial oxygenation, an increase in pulmonary venous admixture, and a sustained elevation in <b>physiologic</b> <b>dead</b> <b>space.</b> These events were associated with an elevation in the lung wet-to-dry weight ratios. Gas exchange and hemodynamic alterations afterthrombin infusion during RE blockade suggest a functional role for the reticuloendothelial system in the prevention of pulmonary injury during intravascular coagulation. Thus, this study suggests a possible role of the RES in minimizing pulmonary injury during states of increased microaggregate formation...|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{performed}} to elucidate the mechanism of improved oxygenation after surfactant replacement therapy in respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) of the newborn infants. In 26 newborns with RDS, end tidal-CO 2 tension (PetCO 2), arterial blood gas analysis and pulmonary function tests were measured at baseline, 30 min, 2 hr and 6 hr after surfactant administration. The changes in dead space/tidal volume ratio (VD/VT ratio=(PaCO 2 -PetCO 2) /PaCO 2), oxygenation index and arterial-alveolar partial pressure difference for oxygen ((A-a) DO 2) were elucidated and correlated with pulmonary mechanics. Oxygenation index and (A-a) DO 2 improved, and VD/VT ratio decreased progressively after surfactant administration, becoming {{significantly different from the}} baseline at 30 min and thereafter with administration of surfactant. Pulmonary mechanics did not change significantly during the observation period. VD/VT ratio showed close correlation with OI and (A-a) DO 2, but not with pulmonary mechanics. These results suggest that decreased <b>physiologic</b> <b>dead</b> <b>space</b> resulting from the recruitment of atelectatic alveoli rather than improvement in pulmonary mechanics is primarily responsible for the improved oxygenation after surfactant therapy in the RDS of newborn...|$|E
40|$|The {{diffusion}} of gases brings the partial pressures of O 2 and CO 2 {{in blood and}} alveolar gas to an equilibrium at the pulmonary blood-gas barrier. Alveolar PCO 2 (PACO 2) dependson the balance {{between the amount of}} CO 2 being added by pulmonary blood and the amount being eliminated by alveolar ventilation (V˙ A). In steady-state conditions, CO 2 output equals CO 2 elimination, but during nonsteadystate conditions, phase issues and impaired tissue CO 2 clearance make CO 2 output less predictable. Lung heterogeneity creates regional differences in CO 2 concentration, and sequential emptying raises the alveolar plateau and steepens the expired CO 2 slope in expiratory capnograms. Lung areas that are ventilated but not perfused form part of the dead space. Alveolar dead space is potentially large in pulmonary embolism, COPD, and all forms of ARDS. When PEEP recruits collapsed lung units, resulting in improved oxygenation, alveolar dead space may decrease; however, when PEEP induces overdistention, alveolar dead space tends to increase. Measuring <b>physiologic</b> <b>dead</b> <b>space</b> and alveolar ejection volume at admission or examining the trend during mechanical ventilation might provide useful information on outcomes of critically ill patients with ARDS...|$|E
40|$|Measured by {{a variety}} of techniques, the overall ventilation-perfusion {{relationship}} of the normal human lung is different in supine and upright positions, and in the upright position, the upper regions of the lung are relatively poorly perfused (1 - 4). Similarly, pulmonary diffusing capacity (DL) is reduced when normal subjects change from supine to upright positions (5, 6); in the upright position, carbon monoxide absorption is greater in the lower portions of the lung than in the upper portions (7). These differences are probably related to a gravity dependent gradient of perfusion and capillary filling caused by the inability of the normally low pulmonary arterial pressure to provide uniformly adequate perfusion against the hydrostatic gradient that must be present in the pulmonary vascular bed of normal adult humans in an upright position (2, 8). The present investigation was undertaken to determine a) whether the normal postural changes in <b>physiologic</b> <b>dead</b> <b>space</b> and diffusing capacity are present in patients in whom the pulmonary vascular pressure should be great enough to insure perfusion of the entire lung in the upright position and b) whether an acute increase in pulmonary vascular pressures affects the arterialalveolar CO 2 gradient and alveolar dead space of normal men in an upright position.

40|$|Expiratory capnogram {{provides}} qualitative {{information on}} the waveform patterns associated with mechanical ventilation and quantitative estimation of expired CO 2. Volumetric capnography simultaneously measures expired CO 2 and tidal volume and allows identification of CO 2 from 3 sequential lung compartments: apparatus and anatomic dead space, from progressive emptying of alveoli and alveolar gas. Lung heterogeneity creates regional differences in CO 2 concentration and sequential emptying contributes {{to the rise of}} the alveolar plateau and to the steeper the expired CO 2 slope. The concept of dead space accounts for those lung areas that are ventilated but not perfused. In patients with sudden pulmonary vascular occlusion due to pulmonary embolism, the resultant high V/Q mismatch produces an increase in alveolar dead space. Calculations derived from volumetric capnography are useful to suspect pulmonary embolism at the bedside. Alveolar dead space is large in acute lung injury and when the effect of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is to recruit collapsed lung units resulting in an improvement of oxygenation, alveolar dead space may decrease, whereas PEEP-induced overdistension tends to increase alveolar dead space. Finally, measurement of <b>physiologic</b> <b>dead</b> <b>space</b> and alveolar ejection volume at admission or the trend during the first 48 hours of mechanical ventilation might provide useful information on outcome of critically ill patients with acute lung injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome...|$|E
40|$|Diseases of the {{pulmonary}} vasculature are {{a cause of}} increased pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) in pulmonary embolism, chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH), and pulmonary arterial hypertension or decreased PVR in pulmonary arteriovenous malformations on hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, portal hypertension, or cavopulmonary anastomosis. All these conditions {{are associated with a}} decrease in both arterial PO 2 and PCO 2. Gas exchange in pulmonary vascular diseases with increased PVR is characterized by a shift of ventilation and perfusion to high ventilation-perfusion ratios, a mild to moderate increase in perfusion to low ventilation-perfusion ratios, and an increased <b>physiologic</b> <b>dead</b> <b>space.</b> Hypoxemia in these patients is essentially explained by altered ventilation-perfusion matching amplified by a decreased mixed venous PO 2 caused by a low cardiac output. Hypocapnia is accounted for by hyperventilation, which is essentially related to an increased chemosensitivity. A cardiac shunt on a patent foramen ovale may be a cause of severe hypoxemia in a proportion of patients with pulmonary hypertension and an increase in right atrial pressure. Gas exchange in pulmonary arteriovenous malformations is characterized by variable degree of pulmonary shunting and/or diffusion-perfusion imbalance. Hypocapnia is caused by an increased ventilation in relation to an increased pulmonary blood flow with direct peripheral chemoreceptor stimulation by shunted mixed venous blood flow. © 2011 American Physiological Society.
