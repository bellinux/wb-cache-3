500|$|While {{many fans}} were upset with this sudden change of direction, {{the album was}} {{generally}} well received by mainstream publications. Entertainment Weekly was highly positive, writing that [...] "This is the group at their best." [...] In his review of the album, Rolling Stone writer Barry Walters wrote [...] "On a Wire quivers with the anxieties that must have arisen as the Get Up Kids left behind what originally made them. Straining vocals, racing tempos and walls of distortion give way to softer singing, spacious guitars and prominent keyboards [...] [...] [...] The Get Up Kids dig deeper into themselves. What they find is often subtle, less visceral but far more tender." [...] The poor public reception of the album had a larger impact on the band's popularity as a whole. The band embarked on a tour to promote the album in the late spring soon after the album was released, {{only to find that}} they had far less support from both their fans and their record label. Using the financial and critical success of Something to Write Home About, Vagrant signed several other headlining emo bands such as Alkaline Trio, Dashboard Confessional, and Saves the Day. The Get Up Kids were no longer the label's top priority, and certainly not after the lukewarm reception of On a Wire. In an interview with Alternative <b>Press,</b> <b>lead</b> singer Matt Pryor considered the dramatic change in style on On a Wire seriously dented the momentum the band had built up since Something to Write Home About, allowing later bands such as Dashboard Confessional to take much of the fan base that The Get Up Kids had previously earned. In an interview, Pryor confessed that he did not think that [...] "anyone, including Vagrant, gave that record a chance". Even though they had avoided the term since its inception, it was at this point the band actively began trying to shed the term [...] "emo", a word that had defined them for years but had come to be associated with more pop-oriented acts. Pryor commented on the album, saying [...] "We really didn't give two shits if anyone liked the record or not, we were really confident {{that we were going to}} kill this 'emo' stigma that we had and take the people with open minds with us and leave everyone else in the dust." ...|$|E

50|$|The Hibbing Convention {{divided the}} group into three {{regional}} districts (alueet) for propaganda and organizational purposes — Eastern, Middle, and Western — each governed {{by its own}} seven member District Committee. The three districts each employed a full-time District Organizer, periodically sent out additional special organizers, and published their own daily newspaper — Raivaaja ("The Pioneer") in the Eastern District (circulation over 6,000 in 1912), Työmies ("The Worker") in the Middle District (circulation about 12,000 in 1912), and Toveri ("The Comrade") in the Western District (circulation around 4,000 in 1912). This regional separatism of the Finnish organization's apparatus and <b>press</b> <b>lead</b> over time to ideological differences, with the Eastern District tending towards a more reformist orientation, while the Western and particularly the Central Districts tended towards a more revolutionary perspective.|$|E

40|$|After the {{political}} rancor {{left by the}} XIX century country’s civil wars, especially by the One-Thousand-Days War, the “Reyista Press” was born. This press was President Rafael Reyes’s incense burner and an opposition instrument to the ‘Quinquenio regime’ characterized by a satiric, incendiary and polemic tone, which, at the same time, was the continuation of a rich tradition. Once the ‘Quinquenio regime’ was overthrown, three political forces gain momentum within the Liberal Press: The Republican Press–that supported the presidential nomination of journalist Carlos E. Restrepo–with Alfonso Villegas Restrepo, Eduardo and Enrique Santos Montejo, Enrique Olaya Herrera and the Cano family; the ‘Bloquista’ <b>Press,</b> <b>lead</b> by General Rafael Uribe Uribe; and the Opposite Press with Benjamín Palacio Uribe, founder of Gil Blas newspaper in 1910. Due to its investigative spirit, Gil Blas newspaper served as an inspiration for Colombian contemporary journalism of the Bicentennial. With this satirical poster, the saints of the Republican Press fell off their shelves in this so-called ‘Indigenous Athens. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{completion}} of several genome-sequencing projects has increased our need to assign functions to newly identified genes. The {{presence of a}} specific protein domain {{has been used as}} the determinant for suggesting a function for these new genes. In the case of proteins that are predicted to interact with mRNA, most RNAs bound by these proteins are still unknown. In yeast, several protocols for the identification of protein-protein interactions in high-throughput analyses have been developed during the last years leading to an increased understanding of cellular proteomics. If any of these protocols or similar approaches shall be used for the identification of mRNA-protein complexes, the integrity of mRNA is a critical factor. Results We compared the effect of different lysis protocols on RNA integrity. We report dramatic differences in RNA stability depending on the method used for yeast cell lysis. Glass bead milling and French <b>Press</b> <b>lead</b> to degraded mRNAs even in the presence of RNase inhibitors. Thus, they are not suitable to purify intact mRNP complexes or to identify specific mRNAs bound to proteins. Conclusion We suggest a novel protocol, grinding deep-frozen cells, for the preparation of protein extracts that contain intact RNAs, as lysis method for the purification of mRNA-protein complexes from yeast cells. </p...|$|E

According to ideomotor theory we can achieve goals in the environment by means of anticipating their outcomes.
