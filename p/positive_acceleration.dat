This was done with an inertially fixed attitude so that the interstage, only 1 meter from the outboard J-2 engines, would fall cleanly without contacting them.

2500|$|The {{intensity}} felt in Christchurch was MM VIII. The peak {{ground acceleration}} (PGA) in central Christchurch exceeded 1.8g (i.e. 1.8 times {{the acceleration of}} gravity), with the highest recording 2.2g, at Heathcote Valley Primary School, a shaking intensity equivalent to MM X+. This is the highest PGA ever recorded in New Zealand; the highest reading during the September 2010 event was 1.26g, recorded near Darfield. The PGA {{is also one of}} the greatest-ever ground accelerations recorded in the world, and was unusually high for a 6.3 quake. and the highest in a vertical direction. The central business district (CBD) experienced PGAs in the range of 0.574 and 0.802 g. In contrast, the 7.0 Mw 2010 Haiti earthquake had an estimated PGA of 0.5g. The acceleration occurred mainly in a vertical direction, with eyewitness accounts of people being tossed into the air. The upwards (<b>positive</b> <b>acceleration)</b> was greater than the downwards, which had a maximum recording of 0.9g; the maximum recorded horizontal acceleration was 1.7g The force of the earthquake was [...] "statistically unlikely" [...] to occur more than once in 1000 years, according to one seismic engineer, with a PGA greater than many modern buildings were designed to withstand. Although the rupture was subsurface, satellite images indicated that the net displacement of the land south of the fault was 50cm westwards and upwards; the land movement would have been greater during the earthquake. Land movement was varied around the area horizontally—in both east and west directions—and vertically; the Port Hills were raised by 40cm.|$|E

Statistically significant coefficients of product-moment correlation for various relations were obtained. The coefficient of multiple determination computed for the dependence of acceleration tolerance on heart-eye distance and systolic blood pressure at rest allows the explanation of almost 50 % of the variation of acceleration tolerance.

Spontaneous symmetry breaking of AdS$_ 4 $ spacetime provides a physical explanation for arising of the virtual particle and antiparticle pairs in vacuum. Interestingly, the energy of a pair and the time its particles moving along their geodesics can be related by a relation similar to Heisenberg uncertainty one pertaining quantum vacuum fluctuations. The sinusoidal geodesics of AdS$_ 4 $ spacetime can describe the world lines of the virtual particles and antiparticles.

The analysis of high quality tide gauge records of the Pacific spanning more than 100 yr permits to evidence the multi-decadal oscillations of sea levels and their influence on the sea level rate of rise that may be computed by a linear fitting with different time windows. Without at least 65 - 70 yr of recorded data, the computed sea level rate of rise differs considerably from the actual long-term sea level rate of rise.
