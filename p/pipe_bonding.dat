A finite element model (FEM) is presented with shell elements and multipoint constraint elements. With this FEM, nonlinear analyses are carried out. Analytical results show that integral failure of reinforced pipe is caused by yielding of original pipe inside. So {{it is not necessary}} to reinforce original pipe using steel <b>pipe</b> <b>bonded</b> outside with high yield strength. With the increase of length of <b>bonded</b> <b>pipe</b> outside, loading according to elastic stage and ultimate bearing loading increase, it is clear that the length of <b>bonded</b> <b>pipe</b> outside is an important factor which influences the bearing capacity...|$|R

This MEN Link is removable for installation testing purposes, but is connected during use by either a locking system (locknuts for instance) or two or more screws. In the MEN system, the integrity of the Neutral is paramount.

40|$|AbstractAdhesively <b>bonded</b> <b>pipe</b> joints are {{extensively}} used in pipelines. In {{the present}} work, cohesive zone model (CZM) based analytical solutions are derived for the <b>bonded</b> <b>pipe</b> joints under torsion. The {{concept of the}} minimum relative interface rotation ϕm is introduced and used as the fundamental variable to express all other parameters, such as external torsion load, distribution of interfacial shear stress, length of elastic zone and softening zone, etc. It is found that when the bond length of the pipe joint is longer than a certain value, further increase in bond length cannot bring any significant increase in torsion load capacity. Given that the bond length of the pipe joint is long enough, the torsion load capacity is indeed independent of the shape of cohesive laws and the bond length. Consequently, simplified expressions of the torsion load capacity are derived {{as a function of}} the interface fracture energy, torsion stiffness of the pipe, and the geometric properties of the pipe joints. Depending on the torsion stiffness ratio of the pipe and the coupler, the macroscopic-debonding can initiate at the right end, left end or both ends simultaneously. It is interesting to note that the maximum torsion load capacity is achieved when the torsion stiffness of the pipe and the coupler are identical. Good agreement with finite element analysis (FEA) result validates the accuracy of the current model. Fracture energy based formulas of the torsion load capacity derived in the present work can be directly used in the design of adhesively <b>bonded</b> <b>pipe</b> joints...|$|R

40|$|The {{dispersion}} {{relations and}} impulse response. are calculated for a geometry consisting of an arbitrary number of coaxial annuli surrounding a central cylinder. The annuli may be either solid or fluid. The formulation allows {{any number of}} solid and fluid layers in any sequence. The only restrictions are that the central cylinder is fluid and the outermost layer is solid. A propagator matrix method is used to relate stresses and displacements across layer boundaries. Fluid layers are handled by directly relating the displacements and stresses across these layers. A number of examples of dispersion curves and synthetic waveforms are given. The speciflc geometries used are those for a <b>pipe</b> not <b>bonded</b> to the cement and for the <b>pipe</b> well <b>bonded</b> to the cement but with the cement not bonded to the formation. The addition of an intermediate fluid layer can have a large effect on the calculated waveforms. More surprisingly, this additional layer may have only minor effects, indicating possible difficulties in establishing its presence. It the fluid layer lies between the steel and the cement (free pipe situation), the first arrival is from the steel. This is the case even for a very thin layer, or microannulus. If the fluid layer is between the cement and the formation,. the thicknesses of the cement and fluid layers become important in determining {{what will be the}} first arrival as well as the nature of the microseismogram. An intermediate fluid layer is shown to have the additional effect of introducing another Stoneley wave mode.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this thesis is to study the characteristics {{of different types of}} flexible pipes and summarize the existing analytical methods, and to establish the models in order to simulate dynamic stress behavior in bending. Comprehensive works have been reviewed before modelling. It is found that as opposed to non-bonded flexible <b>pipes,</b> <b>bonded</b> flexible <b>pipes</b> normally use vulcanized rubber as contact layer where the armor tendons are embedded, while in umbilicals, the armor layers are protected by filling of bitumen. In both cases, the dynamic stresses due to bending will be governed by the shear deformations and mechanical properties of the surrounding material rather than the friction between the layers as for non-bonded pipes. Assuming no slip behavior in the <b>bonded</b> flexible <b>pipes,</b> the strain-stress relationship in the material model can be described as linear elastic. As for the umbilicals, stick-slip behavior also applies, but different from the non-bonded flexible pipe, the shear stiffness will be independent from the radial compression When reviewing the analytical methods concerning the effect of internal pressure load, the concept Anti-deflection moment Mp is introduced to account for the increase of bending stiffness. In case of ovalization of pipe cross-section, the pressure force F¬p and the difference-induced pressure force Fv are not in balance, and the resultant acts as a moment to resist against the bending. This may be the main reason to account the increase of EI but shall be verified in further work. In chapter 3 the analytical methods in the analysis of the stress behavior due to axisymmetric loading and bending have been summarized so as to find the analytical solution as the evaluation of the numerical results. The analysis starts from the non-bonded case, where a typical non-bonded flexible pipe model has been established and its stick-slip behavior is simply presented. Before modelling of bonded case, the Pag-o-flex experimental test has been review to have the basis for the bonded model. Based on the basic components of the non-bonded model and the test sample <b>pipe,</b> the <b>bonded</b> model is established with two helical armor layers and a core pipe. As for the model using PIPE 31 3 D beam element as the core pipe, the results indicate that the radial expansion can not be properly picked up. This is improved by application of HSHEAR 363 3 D shell element. From the analysis of the numerical results, the <b>bonded</b> flexible <b>pipe</b> model demonstrates a linear moment-curvature relationship. The bending stiffness keeps constant and resembles the test sample pipe. Parameter study is implemented to see the influence of the contact material on the bending stiffness. Umbilical model is established later on. The helical tendons have small lay angel in order to gain tensile strength but {{at the expense of the}} radial strength. The numerical results indicate an extremely large initial bending stiffness corresponding to the stick phase. As the slip behavior gradually occurs until full-slip, the tangential bending stiffness decreases sharply to small quantity but stays stably around 10 kNm 2. The parameter study shows that the shear stiffness influences the initial bending stiffness, while the stick limit only affects the durations of the stick or slip hevavior and the transition between. Conclusions and further work are proposed in the end, indicating that the general properties of the <b>bonded</b> flexible <b>pipes</b> and the umbilical have been properly simulated, while more detailed structures shall be modelled and compared with the analytical solutions. In addition, the concept Anti-deflection moment shall be reviewed and verified. If needed, this effect shall be added into equilibrium iteration to get more accuracy...|$|R

30|$|The {{notion of}} the interorganizational network as a field of tension shows that pitfall of {{networks}} may emerge if negative repercussions of presumptive beneficial network strategies are neglected. For example, the control benefit notion in structural hole theory focuses {{on the power of}} actors provided by structural hole positions, however, neglecting the potential negative effects on future resource flows with dependent alters. This example illustrates that actions that benefit certain aspects of interorganizational networks may have negative consequences on others. Zaheer et al. (2010) have identified network mechanisms according to which firms form networks. In order to access resources, to establish trust, to gain power, or to signal quality to other firms, organizations may pursue different strategies. The proposed strategies most often rely implicitly on one of the underlying network models – flow or bond – which consider ties between nodes as conduits that facilitate the flow of something or as bonds that align and coordinate action respectively. The double-sided character of ties between actors serving as <b>pipes</b> and <b>bonds</b> often leads to contradicting effects on organizational outcomes. Hence, strategic decisions need to balance the opportunities and constraints of certain network ties and structures and consider the trade-offs.|$|R

NASA GRC is currently setting up a 55 kW(sub e) non-nuclear system ground test in thermal-vacuum to validate technologies required to transfer reactor heat, convert the heat into electricity, reject waste heat, process the electrical output, and demonstrate overall system performance. Reducing the radiator mass, size, and cost {{is essential to the}} success of the program. To meet these goals, Advanced Cooling Technologies, Inc. (ACT) and Vanguard Space Technologies, Inc.

A two-heat pipe radiator prototype, based on the single facesheet direct-bond concept, was fabricated and tested to verify the ability of the direct-bond joint to withstand coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) induced stresses during thermal cycling. The thermal gradients along the bonds were measured before and after thermal cycle tests to determine if the performance degraded.

40|$|The bonded axi-symmetric {{structures}} {{have been}} widely used in the steel and petroleum industries recent years. However, as is known that there is stress singularity at the end of interface for different materials, which may result in the failure of the joint. The intensity of singular stress field (ISSF) was discussed for bonded plate under arbitrary material combination, while few studies are available for the intensity of bonded structures in axi-symmetric problems, and no results with varying material combination. Thus this research focuses on the analysis of ISSF of different axisymmetric problems with arbitrary material combinations, which may contribute to evaluating the strength for axi-symmetric structures. And in addition, the analysis method in this study was applied in the analysis of a practical engineering problem to verify the significance of this study. This thesis is composed of total 6 chapters and organized as follows; Chapter 1 gives an introduction of composites and bonded structures applied to aviation industry, microelectronic packaging, and steel process equipment. Also the applications and importance of bonded axi-symmetric structure are investigated. For example the application in thermal spray coating roll used in continuous annealing furnace and bonded joint of riser pipe in offshore oil equipment. With the extensive application of the technology, structural failure problems are emerging, which requires further study. Then, the issues of the research on singularity in the bonded structures are reviewed, and it is found that there are only few papers focused on the ISSF for bonded axi-symmetric problems. Then, the research purpose of this thesis is introduced, focusing on the analysis of ISSF for bonded axi-symmetric structures. In chapter 2, the proportional method is discussed for axi-symmetric problems. It is known that FEM is not suitable for the solution of bimaterial problems due to the mesh dependence of singular stress near the end of interface. However, FEM is still useful in the analysis of singular stress problems since FEM error can be eliminated by applying the proportional method. This study extends the method to the bonded axisymmetric problems. However, the difference between bonded plane problems and axisymmetric problems makes the application of proportional method quite difficult. This is because non-singular stress appears due to non-zero circumferential strain εθ. Then, non-singular terms are derived explicitly and eliminated from the stress components calculated by FEM to extend this method to axi-symmetric problems. Finally the method is verified by numerical analysis. In chapter 3, the ISSF for the bonded cylinder is first calculated by changing the material combination systematically after extending of the proportional method to axisymmetric problems. Then, the results are compared with that of plane strain problem and the differences are elaborated. It is found that the ISSF of axi-symmetric problem can not be governed by the Dundurs’ parameters, therefore, the maximum and minimum values of the SIFs are considered and shown in tables and charts in the space of Dundurs’ parameters. Chapter 4 mainly focuses on another type of axi-symmetric <b>bonded</b> structure, <b>bonded</b> <b>pipe.</b> The effect of inner radius on ISSF is also discussed. Generally, it is thought that the <b>bonded</b> <b>pipe</b> with an infinite inner diameter is equivalent to the plane strain problem, but it is found that they are quite different. Therefore, the results of <b>bonded</b> <b>pipe</b> with infinite inner diameter are compared with the plane strain problem. As is done in analysis of bonded cylinder in chapter 3, the maximum and minimum values of the ISSF are considered and shown in tables and charts in the space of Dundurs’ parameters. Chapter 5 shows an example of the proposed method applied to a practical engineering problem. By using the aforementioned analysis proposed for bonded axisymmetric structures, a pipe shaped hearth roll used in continuous annealing furnace for producing steel sheet is investigated. Spraying coating is commonly used in the hearth roll. However, after long-term use under high temperature and thermal shock, the spray coating, which is a sandwich bonded structure, will peel off. Thus, Chapter 5 discusses how to improve the strength of the spray coating under thermal shock. It is found that thinner top coating always has better thermal shock resistance. And under fixed top coating thickness, the ISSF takes a minimum value when the coating thickness ratio H/h≅ 2, which is in accord with the previous research for plane strain state and experimental results in engineering. Here, H and h represent the top coating thickness and bond coating thickness, respectively. In the last chapter of this thesis, chapter 6, main conclusions of this study are summarized for bonded cylinder and boded pipe, and for the optimum design of thermal spray coating. 九州工業大学博士学位論文 学位記番号:工博甲第 421 号 学位授与年月日:平成 28 年 9 月 23 日 1 Introduction|Chapter 2 Extended proportional method and the basic reference problem for the analysis of axisymmetric problems| 3 Analysis on Intensity of Singular Stress for Cylinder in Comparison with Bonded Plate| 4 Analysis on Intensity of Singular Stress for <b>Bonded</b> <b>Pipe</b> in Comparison with Bonded Plate| 5 Analysis on singular stress intensity of ceramic spray coating on hearth roll| 6 Conclusion九州工業大学平成 28 年...|$|R

Panel radyatörün ısıl reaksiyonu;As {{the individual}} heating becomes a more preferred application within {{the beginning of}} natural gas usage at the heating systems in our country, there also have been increases in radiator using. Radiators of different materials and with different types are being used in individual and central heating. The most important creations in radiator selection is cost, thermal output per unit, life time, appropriateness to heating system and time constant. Time constant, appropriateness to the heating system chosen and thermal output per unit are very important {{in the case of}} saving energy. With this work, the thermal attitudes of heating equipment have been examined and the time constants of transfer functions found for the radiators of different types have been calculated. When hot water enters a panel radiator some mixing will occur between it and water already cooling in radiator's channels. The symptom of perfect mixing would be that the water temperature throughout the radiator. The equation for the thermal response of the panel radiator; CR =mwater cwater + mmetal cmetal Transfer function of systems is explained; The time constant of systems is explained; In some designs of low water content radiator, the radiator channels consist in fact of a small number of <b>pipes</b> <b>bonded</b> to the convector surface. Very little mixing would be expected to take place in such an arrangement. The equation for the thermal response of the aluminum radiator; Cm: Thermal capacity of metal = mmetal cmetal Transfer function of systems is explained; The time constant of systems is explained; In the much older column radiator the thermal mass of iron columns may not be correctly modeled by simply aggregating it with the water content as was inferred earlier for the steel panel radiator. In effect this gives two equations describing the radiator dynamics; Transfer function of systems is explained; The time constant of systems is explained; The risk of instability and system gain had been examined by comparing radiator output at different flow temperatures. The risk of instability therefore occurs at low load condition. The risk can be reduced by separately reducing the flow temperatures in accordance with external load. In addition to this it was given transfer function at fluctuations in water flow rate and fluctuations flow temperature by examining behavior of coils, embedded heating panels. For fluctuations in water flow rate: For fluctuations in water flow temperature: (? = ?c 0 / v) The BSRIA model estimates these time constants on the basis of length of tubes per circuit actively transferring heat, the number of tubes per header, the water velocity in the tube and the air velocity through the heat exchanger. It has been seen that the time constants of aluminum radiators are shorter than the other radiator types. Panel, iron and steel radiators are following aluminum radiators. Radiators, which have shorter time constant, will be adept to any changes in the systems. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|R

These mechanisms can be understood as the trigger for network operations and, as a matter of fact, are also implicitly considered in the flow or bond model of networks.|$|R

40|$|This thesis aims {{to develop}} novel {{applications}} of distributed fiber optic sensors for pipeline structural health monitoring. Specifically, this thesis aims {{to show that}} distributed fiber optic sensors can potentially detect the onset of out-of-roundness in pipes and monitor local stiffness changes on the out-of-round pipe, show the theoretical response of the distributed fiber optic sensor when instrumented on an out-of-round pipe subjected to axial and bending loads in addition to internal pressure and demonstrate the potential of distributed fiber optic sensors for monitoring pipe bursts in a laboratory-based burst test while highlighting the importance of sensor spatial and temporal resolution. The ability of distributed fiber optic sensors to detect out-of-roundness in pipes was demonstrated through an experimental program where fiber sensors were instrumented helically around a PVC pipe. The onset of out-of-roundness in the pipe was induced by filling it with water. Strain measurements made by the fiber sensor after the pipe was filled with water showed an oscillatory strain profile with maxima strains along the mid-line of the pipe and minima strains along the top and bottom. This suggested the onset of out-of-roundness. The measurements agreed with an analytical model derived by Brazier describing the deformation of a cylindrical shell due to a bending moment. Internal pressure was then applied to the filled pipe. Strain measurements made with the fiber sensors showed a mean increase in strain and an oscillatory strain profile with maxima strains {{at the top and}} bottom of the pipe and minimas along the mid-line. This agreed with an analytical model derived by Haigh describing the expansion of an out-of-round pipe under internal pressure. Local stiffness changes were introduced to the PVC <b>pipe</b> by <b>bonding</b> steel shims to its surface. The distributed fiber optic sensors were found to be capable of locating the shim when the out-of-round pipe was pressurized. These results demonstrate that distributed fiber sensors can potentially be used to detect the onset of out-of-roundness in pipes and monitor local wall stiffness changes in the out-of-round pipe. The theoretical response of the distributed fiber sensor when helically instrumented on an out-of-round pipe subjected to axial and bending loads in addition to internal pressure was investigated through finite element methods. An algorithm converting finite element point strains to distributed fiber sensor strains and a finite element model of the out-of-round pipe were developed. The strain distributions predicted by the combined algorithm and finite element pipe were found to show good agreement with the experimental results of Chapter 7. The validated algorithm and model were then used to study the theoretical response of the distributed fiber optic sensor when instrumented helically on an out-of-round pipe subjected to axial and bending loads in addition to internal pressure. The results of this study showed that the theoretical distributed fiber optic sensor strains of the out-of-round pipe subjected to internal pressure, internal pressure and axial loads and internal pressure and bending loads are different suggesting that a single strand of fiber sensor instrumented helically around the pipe can potentially distinguish between the three loading cases. The potential of distributed fiber sensors for monitoring pipe bursts was demonstrated in a laboratory-based study. Distributed fiber optic sensors were instrumented on a cast iron pipe. Various damages sizes were introduced to the pipe to initiate burst and the pipe was pressurized. It was observed that higher spatial and temporal distributed fiber optic sensor resolutions allowed the expansion of the burst site to be monitored until the pipe failed. Spatial and temporal resolutions that were too low however could not detect the burst site. The findings of this thesis are expected to contribute towards the development of smart pipes capable of relaying information on its structural health to pipeline operators...|$|R
40|$|A {{promising}} {{possibility to}} reduce corrosion resistant pipeline costs {{is the concept}} of Tight Fit Pipe, which is a double wall pipe where a Corrosion Resistant Alloy liner is mechanically fitted inside a carbon steel outer <b>pipe.</b> The mechanical <b>bonding</b> of the Tight Fit Pipe is made through a thermohydraulic manufacturing process. Problem definition Buckling of cylinders subjected to flexural loads (applied to Tight Fit Pipe during cost effective reeling) correlates in a number of respects to buckling of axially compressed cylinders: in both cases the critical stresses (or strains) are of the same order of magnitude and the failure modes have the same characteristics. Results from the axial compression tests provided better understanding of the buckling behaviour of Tight Fit Pipe during bending and results from this thesis study have been used as input for a bending rig construction. Research The main objective of this thesis is to investigate, theoretically and experimentally, the local buckling behaviour due to axial compression of the Corrosion Resistant Alloy liner, whilst fitted in the outer pipe of the Tight Fit Pipe configuration. The liner of the Tight Fit Pipe as tested is first analysed when not fitted in the outer pipe. Secondly the liner is analysed when fitted in the outer pipe of the Tight Fit Pipe. The liner has a higher capacity in stress and strain when the liner is placed in the outer pipe, i. e. mechanically fitted, compared with the liner alone. Results, Conclusions and Recommendations [a. ] Buckling of the liners (of Tight Fit pipes (TFP) used in the experiments), without the outer pipe, occurred outward in a single axi symmetrical wrinkle. [b. ] The liners in the tight fit pipes, confined in an outer 12 ¾ inch pipes used in the experiments, buckle inward in a non-symmetrical wrinkle. [c. ] Wrinkles (of liners confined in an outer 12 ¾ inch pipe) do not exceed 90 º of the circumference. The wrinkles have an axis which is circumferential. Wrinkles do not tend to connect with each other if more than one is present at about the same height. [d. ] The maximum force in the load - strain diagram was considered to be the point at which wrinkling occurred. There was a good agreement between the Finite Element (FEM) results and test results for the maximum force. The FEM results for the strain at the maximum force were much higher than in the tests. [e. ] Buckling of a liner in a 12 ¾ inch pipe has a larger critical buckling force than a liner which is not confined in an outer pipe. This is due to the resistance to outward buckling. Bigger wrinkles must fit in a smaller radius which costs more energy than free outward buckling. This could also be the reason why the wrinkles do not tend to form as one big wrinkle in a 360 degrees radius. Outward buckling tend to occur in one axi symmetrical wrinkle. [f. ] The buckling behaviour of the liner in the TFP is believed to be influenced by three different TFP properties: [f 1. ] Low or high fit (residual hoop stress), [f 2. ] Type of CRA (Material strength) and [f 3. ] Type of outer pipe used, seamless or UOE-pipe (Liner to outer pipe contact irregularities) [f 1] has been proven in the test results; [f 2] and [f 3] are still to be proven in future work.

40|$|If {{for high}} power {{applications}} the two-phase thermal loop has been highly investigated in the literature, thermal loops for power less than 1 kW has been scarcely studied. They could {{be divided into}} two main groups: high Bond number loops, where the capillary force can be neglected, and low Bond number loops, where the capillary forces cannot be neglected at all (Filippeschi & Franco, 2010). This paper deals with the effect of the geometry of the sections connecting the evaporator and the condenser, on the heat transfer rate in a low Bond number two-phase thermosyphon made of flexible <b>pipes.</b> A low <b>Bond</b> number loop two-phase thermosyphon is also referred in the literature as single turned Pulsating Heat Pipe. These loops are characterized by a natural circulation of mass flow inside. They consist of: an evaporator, a condenser and two adiabatic sections (the riser and the downcomer) which connect the two exchangers. In many applications like as PV solar cells cooling the condenser and the evaporator can be out of alignment, so that the use of the flexible pipes seems to be necessary. Several papers in the literature have experimentally shown that the heat transfer rate, which can be transferred from the evaporator to the condenser section, mainly depends on few parameters like as: the diameter of the tube, the working fluid, the adiabatic section length, the number of the turns and the operative orientation with respect to the gravity. However the thermal and hydraulic oscillations in these devices can not be accurately predicted and the heat and mass transfer phenomena is still unsolved problem. The use of flexible pipes for the adiabatic section introduce additional problems because the evaporator and the condenser sections cab be placed in any configuration, even out of alignment. In this configuration additional forces and additional pressure drops can decelerate or accelerate the motion. In addition the use of unconstraint pipes could develop damping pressure oscillations with different frequencies. In particular in this paper the authors wish to understand the effect of the geometry of these sections on the slugs and plugs motion inside the loop, and in particular of the bends and of the extension of the horizontal section. The experimental facility consists of a single closed loop of capillary dimensions. In particular the evaporator section is copper plate where a long circular hole has been realised (Internal Diameter: 2. 0 mm, OD: 4. 0 mm). The condenser section is a pipe made of brass (ID: 2. 1 mm,OD: 3. 0 mm). It is designed to facilitate parametric investigations as well as simultaneous flow-visualization. The condenser and the evaporator are connected with flexible pipes made of PTFE (ID: 2. 0 mm,OD: 3. 0 mm). The evaporator section is heated by two flat electrical heaters. The condenser section, made of a hollow copper chamber, is supplied with cooling water from a constant temperature bath. Adequate thermal insulation is provided on all sections. The working fluid is water. The motion of the plugs and the slugs is observed with a high-speed acquisition video-camera. The unstable two-phase flow of a single turned PHP has been qualitatively described in (Khandekhar et al, 2009) (Di Marco & Filippeschi, (2010). This paper shows the effect of the alignment distance on the thermal resistance in a upward heat transfer mode. Considerations on the increase of the instability and the reduction of the mass flow rate circulating with the flexible pipes have been drawn...|$|R
