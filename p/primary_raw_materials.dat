40|$|International audienceThis paper applies {{a simple}} model {{to examine the}} links between primary (extracted) and {{secondary}} (recycled) raw materials. The model serves to illustrate that in a growth-based economy, the reliance on <b>primary</b> <b>raw</b> <b>materials</b> is inevitable, let alone because of the residence time of the material in the economy, which generates a delay between the total production of raw material (primary and secondary) and the material that enters the waste stream and therefore becomes available for recycling. An examination of the underlying model hypotheses highlights the questionable nature of the "fixed stock" paradigm, which is not consistent with either geological knowledge of metal concentrations, or the continuous improvement of ore-treatment process efficiencies...|$|E
40|$|Production of {{non ferrous}} metals from {{secondary}} raw materials {{is far less}} costly than its production from <b>primary</b> <b>raw</b> <b>materials,</b> due to lower energy consumption. Besides, by recycling of non ferrous metals from secondary raw materials, the natural resources are saved {{and the amount of}} waste materials is reduced, directly protecting the environment. The secondary raw materials can originate in metal production and treatment, accompanied by their incorporation into the final product and its elimination due to amortization. The different methods of preparation and metallurgical treatment are used depending on secondary raw materials type. Some of them are very easy to be recycled by remelting in metallurgical furnace, while others must pass through complicated preparation before metallurgical treatment...|$|E

30|$|Secondary {{materials}} from recycling activities were not explicitly considered in this study, {{which focused on}} the material footprint of primary extraction. Recent estimates illustrate that there exist huge potentials to increase the degree of circularity in the European economy. The aggregated recycling rate, calculated as the amounts of recycled materials {{as a share of}} all processed materials, was only 12.6  % in 2005 (Haas et al. 2015). An ambitious implementation of the circular economy package would reduce the European demand for <b>primary</b> <b>raw</b> <b>materials</b> and thus would also decrease the material footprint as presented in this paper. Moving to a circular economy is therefore also closely connected to economic issues, such as import dependence and stable supply of raw materials for European industries (European Commission 2015).|$|E
