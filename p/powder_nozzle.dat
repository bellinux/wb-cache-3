40|$|Additive {{manufacturing}} (AM) is {{a general}} name used for manufacturing methods which have the capabilities of producing components directly from 3 D computeraided design (CAD) data by adding material layer-by-layer until a final componentis achieved. Included here are powder bed technologies, laminated object manufacturing and deposition technologies. The latter technology is used in this study. Laser Metal Powder Deposition (LMPD) is an AM method which builds components by fusing metallic powder together with a metallic substrate, using a laser as energy source. The powder is supplied to the melt-pool, which is created by the laser, through a <b>powder</b> <b>nozzle</b> which can be lateral or coaxial. Both the <b>powder</b> <b>nozzle</b> and laser are mounted on a guiding system, normally a computer numerical control (CNC) machine or a robot. LMPD has lately gained attentionas a manufacturing method which can add features to semi-finished components or as a repair method. LMPD introduce a low heat input compared to conventional arc welding methods and is therefore well suited in, for instance, repair of sensitive parts where too much heating compromises {{the integrity of the}} part. The main part of this study has been focused on correlating the main process parameters to effects found in the material which in this project is the superalloy Alloy 718.

The tolerances of the feeding rate are less then 3 percent. The on-line measurement of the powder mass flow rate enables the fast and precise setting, long time constancy and variable control of the feed rate during the whole treatment process to be achieved. Because of its compact design and low weight, the entire powder feeding device can easily be attached to a laser working head. For cladding with wide focal areas broad cladding tracs of good quality and low dilution can be produced using <b>powder</b> <b>nozzles</b> with large diameters. In addition, the adapted configuration of laser beam and powder supply results in high coupling rates and a high cladding efficiency. Furthermore, the experimental results show that by adaptive regulation of the laser output power the track shape and composition can be controlled in a wide range.

40|$|Laser {{cladding}} {{technology is}} widely used in industry to precisely apply tailored surface coatings, as well as three dimensional deposits for repair and additive layer-by-layer fabrication of metallic parts. However, the processing of larger components, like tools {{for oil and gas}} production, is economically challenging due to the conventionally low deposition rates. Consequently, industry is requesting more powerful technologies that maintain the quality advantages of the laser technology, but also make the process more productive and time effective. The modern highest power diode lasers offer practical solutions for applying of large-area laser cladding with significantly increased productivity. Using a fiber-coupled diode laser of 20 kW power and the accordingly developed laser cladding heads, real deposition rates of metal alloys, e. g. Inconel 625, could reach 14 kg/h.

Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV) was applied to the nozzle`s output to better understand the kinetic parameters (velocity and spatial density) of exiting particles. Optical scattering of the powder stream was used to measure the total mass flow into the nozzle. Different light scattering detector scenarios applied to the input powder stream were used to identify signals useful for mass flow feedback control. Both of these techniques have the advantages of being fast, noninvasive diagnostics of the powder flow characteristics, and with a well established theoretical framework. Together, or individually, these diagnostics can provide real-time control or post-process analysis of the powder stream...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis work {{presents}} the results of investigation of heating and laser acceleration of powder particles in the lasercladding conditions. The model of reactive particles motion developed by the authors made a base for the numerical analysis of the laser particles acceleration. At the laser cladding, the light-propulsion force may be quite high, and powder particles may be accelerated up to several tens of meters per second and more. Numerical studies were carried out for two types of coaxial laser-powder <b>nozzles.</b> <b>Powder</b> feeding ways (symmetrical and asymmetrical), particles size and flow rate were varied. CO 2 -laser radiation had the wavelength of 10. 6 μm, power up to 4. 5 kW. Stainless-steel and aluminum-oxide powders werestudied. Comparability of the model calculation and experimental data is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This study {{investigated}} the effect of scanning speed and gas flow rate on surface finish produced during the laser metal deposition process of Ti 6 Al 4 V, an important aerospace alloy. In this work, Nd-YAG laser was employed with coaxial <b>powder</b> deposition <b>nozzle</b> attached to the end effector of a Kuka robot. The laser power was maintained at 3. 0 kW and the powder flow rate at a value 2. 88 g/min. The scanning speed was varied between 0. 01 and 0. 05 m/s and the gas flow rate was varied between 1 and 5 l/min. A total of ten samples were produced and the surface roughness was measured using the average of five measurements from each sample. The microstructure was also studied with optical microscope to relate it to the surface roughness. The results showed that, the average surface finish increased as the scanning speed was increased. Conversely, as the gas flow rate was increased the average surface roughness was reduced. In optimizing the laser metal deposition process, the processing parameters need to be optimized. The {{results from this study}} will assist in choosing the right powder flow rate and scanning speed especially in applications such as repair and surface modification...|$|R
40|$|Direct Laser Deposition (DLD) is a blown-powder laser {{deposition}} process {{which can be}} used to quickly produce fully-dense metallic prototypes by a layered manufacturing method. DLD {{can also be used to}} repair or modify high-value components. In common with other laser {{deposition process}}es, variation in the process parameters (traverse speed, powder flow rates etc.) can cause height errors in the built part. Layer height control methods are therefore a continually investigated field. Research carried out at Liverpool University has resulted in a non-feedback layer height controlling process based on controlling the shape of the powder streams emitted from a four-port side feed nozzle. This method limits deposited layer height by causing a sharp reduction of catchment efficiency in the vertical plane at a fixed distance from the <b>powder</b> feed <b>nozzle,</b> and is therefore capable of depositing a consistent layer height in spite of power, powder flow or process velocity variation. This paper examines the effects of altering the configuration of a four port nozzle system on the shape of the emitted powder streams and demonstrates the benefits of using the derived `best' configuration in the production of test samples. In addition, the effects upon microstructure of parts generated in this fashion are discussed...|$|R
