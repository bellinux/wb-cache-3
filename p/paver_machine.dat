40|$|Now-a-days, {{the major}} {{challenge}} thatâ€™s being {{faced by the}} concrete industry is the cleaning of concrete handling equipment. Concrete consists of aggregates, which harden with time, and the transportation of concrete mixture within the plant is a significant problem. This will not only increase the overall maintenance cost, but will lead to loss of raw materials, affect the rate of production, and reduce the lifetime of concrete handling equipment. The present study focuses on the design and implementation of an adaptive cleaning mechanism in the concrete industry and its importance in achieving efficient cleaning, which is tested to verify its performance in the Paver production plant. The goal {{of this study is}} to provide practical evidence about the importance of adaptive cleaning mechanisms for industrial applications. The first chapter gives a detailed introduction about pavers and the production process, the cause of material loss that occurs during transportation of wet concrete mixture inside a paver plant, and its effect on handling equipment and work environment. The second chapter explains design and working of the <b>paver</b> <b>machine</b> push bar mechanism, which can be implemented in a hydraulic press production process of pavers. The third chapter includes analysis and results of the mechanism obtained using Solidworks and Autodesk Inventor followed by observations that are achieved based on practical application of this mechanism in a paver production plant...|$|E

The screed is a main work device of paver which is {{in direct contact with}} the road surface when the paver paving, so, it has a very important role in the quality of construction whether its performance is good or not. In this study, the dynamic model of the screed is established through the analysis of the principle of the paver, the virtual prototype model of paver screed is established and simulated by the simulation software-ADAMS. Dynamic characteristic of the mechanism are studied and the influence of parameter variety to the dynamic in the system are analyzed. The result can provides a reference for the design of paver screed and the adjustment of construction parameters...|$|R
