40|$|Abstract- As field {{programmable}} gate arrays {{and other}} reconfigurable logic devices are increasingly used for aerospace and terrestrial applications, fault tolerance methodologies {{have been developed}} to improve reliability. Applying fault tolerance to an entire design may incur <b>prohibitive</b> <b>area</b> and energy penalties, and a need exists for techniques that can trade fault tolerance for lower area penalties. However, selecting a circuit subset that minimizes both the area overhead and the vulnerability to faults remains an open topic. Area-Constrained Partial Fault Tolerance (ACPFT) is a unique approach that explicitly accepts the device resources as an input and attempts to find a maximally fault-tolerant subset within this constraint. While previous options in ACPFT determined this subset from different heuristics, this paper presents an extension called ACPFT-GA that uses genetic algorithms for subset selection. Testing shows an improvement of up to 31. 92 % more coverage than the previous version...|$|E
40|$|When Arthur Laffer {{and other}} ‘supply side advocates ’ plot total tax revenue as a {{function}} of a particular tax rate, they draw an upward-sloping segment called the normal range, followed by a downward-sloping segment called the prohibitive range. A brief literature review indicates that tax rates on the prohibitive range in theoretical and empirical models have been the result of particularly high tax rates, high elasticity parameters, or both. The labor tax rate which maximizes total revenue, for example, will depend on the assumed labor supply elasticity. This paper introduces a new curve which summarizes the tax rate and elasticity combinations that result in maximum revenues, separating the ‘normal area ’ from the ‘prohibitive area’. A generalpurpose empirical U. S. general equilibrium model is used to plot the Laffer curve for several elasticities, and to plot the newly introduced curve using the labor tax example. Results indicate that the U. S. could conceivably be operating in the <b>prohibitive</b> <b>area,</b> but that the tax wedge or labor supply elasticity would have to be much higher than most estimates would suggest. 1...|$|E
50|$|Effluent sewers also {{currently}} serve {{fewer people}} than septic systems, which also use septic tanks, but simply {{dispose of the}} effluent by draining it into a leach field. About one quarter of United States homes dispose of their wastewater with septic tanks. However, effluent sewers are being looked at as a sewage treatment solution in areas where gravity sewer systems are not well-suited or when the high capital cost to build a gravity system is <b>prohibitive.</b> <b>Areas</b> that are less than ideal for gravity systems include areas that are large, but extremely flat and areas that require long-distance pumping, such as where homes are widely spread out or when several small villages or towns connect their sewage systems so that a centralized plant can be built.|$|R
40|$|Background: Local control {{remains an}} {{important}} issue {{in the management of}} large soft tissue sarcomas. Radiation is the main adjuvant to surgery for local therapy of sarcomas, but it requires relatively high doses, hitherto considered <b>prohibitive</b> in <b>areas</b> such as the retroperitoneum. We developed a preoperative treatment approach to large soft tissue sarcomas that would deliver a high total dose of radiation administered in conjunction with the halogenated pyrimidine radiosensitizer idoxuridine (IdUrd) ...|$|R

The Extended Program of Immunization provides protection against six serious infections. However, this program is still not optimally implemented in all developing countries. The Extended Program of Immunization could benefit from the addition of several vaccines, but unfortunately the cost is <b>prohibitive</b> in many <b>areas</b> of the Tropics. For {{some of the most important}} infections, such as malaria and HIV, vaccines are not yet available. Novel strategies for vaccine development and policy implementation offer the best hope to combat the infections targeted by the World Health Organization as causing the highest annual death toll worldwide...|$|R
30|$|Since {{public school}} funding {{is based upon}} school enrollment, smaller districts {{generally}} receive less funds than larger districts (Gutierrez 2016). Rural schools often have smaller student populations than urban and suburban districts, but {{tend to be more}} widespread geographically. Many students in rural communities travel longer distances to the physical facilities, and a larger portion of funds must go towards transporting students to and from school, leaving less funding for instructional purposes (Gutierrez 2016). Building technical infrastructure that is fast enough to support the Internet in remote areas can be an expensive process that may be <b>prohibitive</b> in remote <b>areas.</b> Wheeler (2014) found that 41 % of rural schools, as compared with 31 % of urban schools, lack enough bandwidth to support connectivity.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{new test}} generation techniques {{for improving the}} average-case performance of the iterative logic array based deterministic sequential circuit test generation algorithms. To be able to assess {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed techniques, we have developed a new ATPG system for sequential circuits, called ATOMS, and we have incorporated these techniques into the test generator. ATOMS achieved very high fault coverages in {{a short amount of time}} for the ISCAS 89 sequential benchmark circuits, demonstrating the effectiveness of these techniques on the test generation performance. 1 Introduction Although scan based design for testability techniques can convert a sequential circuit into a combinational circuit for testing purposes, in some cases, the cost of full scan can be <b>prohibitive</b> in both <b>area</b> overhead and performance degradation. Therefore, efficient sequential circuit test generation algorithms are very important for producing high quality VLSI circuits. The prob [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the register}} requirements of software pipelined inner loops. When {{the number of}} functional units and/or the number of stages of individual functional units is increased, the number of registers required may be <b>prohibitive</b> in chip <b>area</b> and cycle time. We characterize lifetime of values in pipelined loops with their loop register locality (LRL). Based on this characteristic, we propose a new organization of the register file {{in order not to}} affect cycle time and also reduce area, while increasing the number of registers. This can be useful to minimize the frequency of spill at a reasonable cost. The spill code can increase the minimum initiation interval and decrease loop performance. This new organization consists of a small high bandwidth multiported register file and a low bandwidth port-limited register file called sack. A mechanism to assign values to the sack is presented. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by experimenting with a collection of [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Although {{many studies}} have {{demonstrated}} the utility of airborne lidar for forest inventory, the acquisition and processing of the data can be cost <b>prohibitive</b> for small <b>areas.</b> In such cases, {{it may be possible}} to emulate lidar metrics using more affordable optical data. This study explored processing methods for predicting lidar metrics using SPOT- 5 textural data. Multiple-linear regression (MLR) was compared with non-linear machine learning techniques including multi-layer perceptron (MLP) artificial neural networks (ANN), rational basis function (RBF) ANN and regression tree (RT). For this purpose, 11 grey level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) indices were calculated for bands, band ratios and principal components (PCs) of SPOT- 5 multispectral image. SPOT- 5 metrics were correlated with 25 lidar metrics collected over a Pinus radiata plantation. After dimensionality reduction, random forest feature selection was applied to select the most relevant SPOT- 5 textural attributes for inferring each lidar metric. The results showed that the non-linear methods including MLP and RBF methods are more promising for modelling lidar metrics using SPOT- 5 data than MLR and RT. * Corresponding author...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} decades, {{researchers}} focused {{their attention on}} using inverse analysis of empirical surface‐waves dispersion curves from microtremor measurements since it allows to keep the cost of investigation relatively low and to avoid the use of active sources that might be <b>prohibitive</b> in urban <b>areas.</b> In this study we reports the results and interpretations of the passive measurements carried out at a test site in Bevagna (Italy) near the BVG station of the Italian Accelerometric Network (RAN) {{within the framework of}} the DPC‐INGV S 4 Project (2007 ‐ 2009). Using two independent approaches, Rayleigh and Love wave dispersion characteristics were reproduced through two different inversion methods. At this site a cross‐hole test made nearby the seismic station offers the opportunity to compare the subsoil velocity profiles derived by seismic noise array data with independent geophysical information. The results obtained from the separated Love waves and Rayleigh wave inversions analyses showed that the two procedure provide consistent shear wave velocity profiles for the shallow part of the model in good agreement with the results of the nearby cross‐hole test. This case history shows the capabilities of surface wave analyses from passive source to adequately retrieve the S‐wave subsoil structure and suggests that more efforts should be devoted in exploiting the potential of coupled analysis of Rayleigh and Love waves from microtremor array measurements for site characterization...|$|R
40|$|The Metals are {{considered}} as most important toxic pollutants in the ecosystem. Metals are continuously {{released into the}} biosphere by natural processes like volcanoes, weathering of rocks and also by various anthropogenic activities, such as mining, combustion of fuels, industrial and urban sewage and agricultural practices. On a global scale there is evident that, through the anthropogenic activities surrounding environment has polluted heavy metals. Once metals were entered into the environment it goes on accumulation with the natural process. However, in general aspects {{it is very difficult}} to eliminate the metals from the environment. Traditional treatments for metal contamination in soils are expensive and cost <b>prohibitive</b> when large <b>areas</b> of soil are contaminated. In this present study the heavy metal pollution in industrial area of Mysore city has been taken and also heavy metal speciation, as well as abiotic and biotic factors affecting their bioavailability of heavy metal pollution was studied. The geochemical behavior of heavy metals was analyzed through speciation studies. The studies show that the heavy metals mobility is less in the Exchangeable metal fraction and Carbonate bound metal fractions. But in the Fe– Mn oxide metal fraction and Organic and sulfide metal fractions mobility of the metals is comparatively little higher than the other fraction. The final residual metal fraction has the non-mobile phase of the heavy metals. In this study period, the industrial surrounding area soil has become polluted and lost their natural fertility with the addition of some heavy metals by several processes taken up by the industries...|$|R
40|$|Metals are {{considered}} as important toxic pollutants {{and there is}} extensive literature concerning their accumulation in ecosystems. Metals are continuously released into the biosphere by natural processes like volcanoes, weathering of rocks and also by various anthropogenic activities, such as mining, combustion of fuels, industrial and urban sewage and agricultural practices. On a global scale there is now abundant evidence that anthropogenic activities has polluted the surrounding environment with heavy metals from the poles to the tropics and from {{the mountains to the}} depths of the oceans. Once metals are introduced and contaminate the environment, they will remain. Metals do not degrade like carbon-based (organic) molecules. The only exceptions are mercury and selenium, which can be transformed and volatilized by microorganisms. However, in general {{it is very difficult to}} eliminate metals from the environment.
