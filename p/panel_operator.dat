2500|$|Martin and Kavalee have {{discussed}} often that April 2007 be redesignated as [...] "Capril" [...] (a portmanteau {{of the words}} Cape and April), a month where all listeners should wear capes in public, conducting day to day activities. The tagline for the month was: [...] "Are you capable?". This activity has continued since the show's cancellation as an awareness and fundraising activity for depression, which claimed the life of <b>panel</b> <b>operator</b> Richard Marsland.|$|E
2500|$|A {{gas panel}} or gas {{manifold}} is the control equipment for supplying the breathing gas to the divers. Primary and reserve gas is supplied {{to the panel}} through shutoff valves from a low-pressure compressor or high-pressure storage cylinders ("bombs", [...] "quads", or [...] "kellys"). The gas pressure may be controlled at the panel by an industrial pressure regulator, or it may already be regulated closer to the source (at the compressor, or at the storage cylinder outlet). The supply gas pressure is monitored on a gauge at the panel, and an over-pressure valve is fitted in case the supply pressure is too high. The gas panel may be operated by the diving supervisor if the breathing gas is air or a fixed ratio premix, but if the composition must be controlled or monitored during the dive it is usual for a dedicated gas <b>panel</b> <b>operator,</b> or [...] "gas man" [...] to do this work.|$|E

40|$|According to Neff (1977), {{as cited}} by Bergh (1995), the westernised culture {{considers}} work important for industrial mental health. Most individuals experience work positively, which creates a positive attitude. Should this positive attitude be inhibited, workers could lose concentration and become bored, potentially resulting {{in some form}} of human error. The aim of this research was to determine the factors responsible for human error events, which lead to power supply failures at Eskom power stations. Proposals were made for the reduction of these contributing factors towards improving plant performance. The target population was 700 <b>panel</b> <b>operators</b> in Eskom’s Power Generation Group. The results showed that factors leading to human error can be reduced or even eliminated...|$|R

The candidate solutions, stops as they were called, were processed further to eliminate as many false stops as possible. Typically, there were many false bombe stops before the correct one was found.|$|R

50|$|The term <b>panel</b> <b>operator</b> {{generally}} {{relates to}} {{any person who}} is employed to operate a broadcast console. This term is more often used in the radio industry. In the U.S., insiders refer to a broadcast console as a 'board', and in turn, refer to those operating it as a board operator.|$|E

40|$|Touchscreen <b>operator</b> <b>panels</b> {{proved to}} be a {{convenient}} succesor for clasical <b>operator</b> <b>panels</b> for implementing human-machine interfaces (HMIs) in programmable logic controllers (PLC) systems. The paper introduces a new technique for HMIs design in such systems, based on the idea of touchscreens replication. This redundancy allow actions which are not possible within the menus and sub-menus of a single touchscreen. Its strenght is revealed especially in complex systems, where operators can easily be overwhelmed by the huge amount of process information. The technique was applied on a mill tube rolling installation. The results also proved an increase of system security and zero downtime for HMI maintenance activities...|$|R

50|$|For fun, bored programmers {{would create}} {{programs}} to display animated light shows. Front panels {{in the late}} 1960s and early 1970s were quite brightly colored. When bootstrap ROMs enabled computers to start themselves without operator intervention in the late 1970s and early 1980s, most computers were built without a front switch panel. High-powered calculators, such as the HP 9830 based on ROM, {{were among the first}} computers to do away with front <b>panels,</b> and <b>operators.</b>|$|R
