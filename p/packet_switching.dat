5|$|On October 29, 1969, {{the first}} {{connection}} {{on a wide}} area network to use <b>packet</b> <b>switching,</b> ARPANET, was established between nodes at Leonard Kleinrock's laboratory at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and Douglas Engelbart's laboratory at SRI using Interface Message Processors at both sites. The following year, Engelbart's laboratory installed the first TENEX system outside of BBN where it was developed. In addition to SRI and UCLA, University of California, Santa Barbara and the University of Utah {{were part of the}} original four network nodes. By December 5, 1969, the entire four-node network was connected. In the 1970s, SRI developed packet-switched radio (a precursor to wireless networking), over-the-horizon radar, Deafnet, vacuum microelectronics, and software-implemented fault tolerance.|$|E
5|$|On 11 September 1940, George Stibitz {{transmitted}} {{problems for}} his Complex Number Calculator in New York using a teletype, {{and received the}} computed results back at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire. This configuration of a centralized computer (mainframe) with remote dumb terminals remained popular well into the 1970s. However, already in the 1960s, researchers started to investigate <b>packet</b> <b>switching,</b> a technology that sends a message in portions to its destination asynchronously without passing it through a centralized mainframe. A four-node network emerged on 5 December 1969, constituting {{the beginnings of the}} ARPANET, which by 1981 had grown to 213 nodes. ARPANET eventually merged with other networks to form the Internet. While Internet development was a focus of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) who published a series of Request for Comment documents, other networking advancement occurred in industrial laboratories, such as the local area network (LAN) developments of Ethernet (1983) and the token ring protocol (1984).|$|E
40|$|Our work is {{motivated}} {{by the desire to}} design <b>packet</b> <b>switches</b> with large aggregate capacity and fast line rates. In this paper, we consider building a <b>packet</b> <b>switch</b> from multiple lower speed <b>packet</b> <b>switches</b> operating independently and in parallel. In particular, we consider a (perhaps obvious) parallel <b>packet</b> <b>switch</b> (PPS) architecture in which arriving traffic is demultiplexed over identical lower speed <b>packet</b> <b>switches,</b> switched to the correct output port, then recombined (multiplexed) before departing from the system. Essentially, the <b>packet</b> <b>switch</b> performs packet-by-packet load balancing, or inverse multiplexing, over multiple independent <b>packet</b> <b>switches.</b> Each lower speed <b>packet</b> <b>switch</b> operates {{at a fraction of the}} line rate. For example, each <b>packet</b> <b>switch</b> can operate at rate. It is a goal of our work that all memory buffers in the PPS run slower than the line rate.

2500|$|Donald Davies (1924–2000) {{independently}} invented {{and named}} {{the concept of}} <b>packet</b> <b>switching</b> in 1965 at the United Kingdom's National Physical Laboratory (NPL). In the same year, he proposed a national data network based on <b>packet</b> <b>switching</b> in the UK. After the proposal was not taken up nationally, during 1966 he headed a team which produced a design for a local area network to {{serve the needs of}} NPL and prove the feasibility of <b>packet</b> <b>switching.</b> [...] In 1967, a written version of the proposal entitled NPL Data Network was presented by a member of his team (Roger Scantlebury) at the ACM conference in Gatlinburg. The paper described how [...] equipment (nodes) used to transmit signals (packets) would be connected by electrical links to re-transmit the signals between and to the nodes, and interface computers would be used to link node networks to so-called time-sharing computers and other users. [...] The interface computers would transmit multiplex [...] signals between networks, and nodes would switch transmissions while connected to electrical circuitry functioning at a rate of processing amounting to mega-bits. Scantlebury suggested packet swithcing for use in the ARPANET; Larry Roberts incorporated it into the design and sought input from Paul Baran as well. Davies gave the first public demonstration of <b>packet</b> <b>switching</b> in 1968 and built the local area NPL network in England, influencing other research in the UK and Europe. The NPL network followed by ARPANET were the first two networks in the world to use <b>packet</b> <b>switching.</b> In 2012, Davies was inducted into the Internet Hall of Fame by the Internet Society.|$|E
40|$|This work employs an {{approximate}} Markov chain to analyze that a parallel <b>packet</b> <b>switch</b> (PPS) can emulate a first-come first-served (FCFS) output-queued (OQ) <b>packet</b> <b>switch</b> only operating {{slower than the}} external line rate. The PPS comprises multiple <b>packet</b> <b>switches</b> operating independently and in parallel. The PPS class is characterized by deployment of parallel center-stage switches with memory buffers running slower than the external line rate. Each lower speed <b>packet</b> <b>switch</b> operates {{at a fraction of}} the external line rate R. For example, each <b>packet</b> <b>switch</b> can operate at internal line rate R/K, where K is the number of center-stage switches. This work presents a proposed novel Markov chain model successfully exhibits these performance characteristics for throughput, cell delay and cell drop rate. This novel Markov chain model extends from our previous paper [Chia-Lung Liu, Woei Lin, Performance analysis of the sliding-window parallel <b>packet</b> <b>switch,</b> in: IEEE 40 th International Conference on Communications 2005, ICC 2005, May 16 - 20, 2005; Chia-Lung Liu, Woei Lin, Evaluation and analysis of the sliding-window parallel <b>packet</b> <b>switch,</b> in: IEEE 19 th International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications, AINA, vol. 2, 2005, pp. 355 - 358]. Simulation comparison demonstrates that the chains are accurate for practical network loads. With the proposed model, major finding are that: (1) it is theoretically possible for the throughput and cell drop rates of a PPS to emulate those of a FCFS-OQ <b>packet</b> <b>switch</b> when each lower speed <b>packet</b> <b>switch</b> operates at a rate of approximately R/K, and, (2) this work also demonstrates that it is theoretically possible for the cell delay of a PPS to emulate that of FCFS-OQ <b>packet</b> <b>switch</b> when each lower speed <b>packet</b> <b>switch</b> operates at a rate of approximately (3 R/cell delay of FCFS-OQ switch). Additionally, this work develops and investigates a novel PIAO PPS which distributes cells or variable-length <b>packets</b> to center-stage <b>switches</b> and uses multiplexers with push-in arbitrary-out (PIAO) queues.

Packet delays are in this case comparable to those in the output-queued <b>packet</b> <b>switches.</b> The drawback of such switches is the inability to differentiate among multiple service classes. On the other hand, by using a synchronous switching fabric, a 100 % switch throughput of cannot be achieved.
