40|$|Type 1 {{diabetes}} mellitus requires an exogenous supply of insulin that ideally mimics physiological insulin secretion. The treatment {{goal is to}} achieve normoglycaemia {{in order to prevent}} or delay chronic complications, while limiting the risk of hypoglycaemia. Numerous advances have been performed in the last 10 years, as far as nature of insulin formulations, home blood glucose monitoring devices and modes of insulin delivery. Among the latter, continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) using <b>portable</b> <b>pumps</b> represents the most sophisticated treatment capable of best mimicking normal insulin secretion. Such treatment provides better glucose control and glucose stability as compared to conventional multiple injection insulin therapy. However, it is essential to respect well defined indications and to organize a structured management by a multidisciplinary team {{in order to get the}} best metabolic results. The present paper describes recommendations, advantages and limits as well as cost of CSII with <b>portable</b> <b>pumps</b> in type 1 diabetic patients...|$|R
50|$|In the 1960s, the {{volunteer}} fire brigade was founded.

50|$|This {{incident}} saw {{possibly the}} largest fire brigade attendance in UK history: 78 different brigades (with over 200 appliances, 147 of which responded from London Fire Brigade) and 38 different military units spread detergent and pumped out contaminated water.

40|$|Background: A {{variety of}} anticancer agents are better tolerated and more {{effective}} if given as continuous compared to bolus administration. <b>Portable</b> <b>pump</b> devices are needed to allow outpatient continuous infusion. Different types of <b>portable</b> <b>pumps</b> are available and we tested patient preference in a randomized crossover design. Patients and methods: Patients on continuous infusion fluorouracil {{were randomly assigned to}} start treatment with an elastomeric infusor (Baxter) or a mechanical, electronically controlled pump (CADD- 1 ™, Pharmacia) and crossed over to the alternative model after three weeks. After exposure to both pump types patients were asked to indicate their preferred device. Results: After 10 patients the study was closed because all study participants preferred the elastomeric pump (P < 0. 01). Reasons were pump weight (100 %), smaller pump size (89 %), interference with daily activities (89 %), user friendliness (56 %), impact on sleep (44 %), and lack of technical problems (22 %). Although the mechanical pump required more handling time for the first two refillings, the learning curve suggested about equal time requirement thereafter. Conclusion: In the interest of patient comfort, the disposable elastomeric infusor is an acceptable alternative to the more accurate electronically controlled pumps especially for drugs with a short half-life and a favorable toxicity profil...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1974 The {{design and}} testing of a <b>portable</b> <b>pumping</b> system {{for use in the}} {{hydraulic}} excavation of commercial crab pots buried by ocean sediment was undertaken. The resulting portable system retained the four major components of the pumping systems presently used by commercial fishermen: engine, pump, fire hose, and nozzle. Because present systems are too heavy and unwieldy for use on smaller crab boats, a system of more modest proportions yet equivalent excavating capacity was sought. By using a more effective waterjet nozzle, it became possible to employ a one-cylinder pump-engine combination easily portable by two men. The <b>portable</b> <b>pump</b> and engine were purchased and a nozzle manufactured. The system package was assembled, tested for system flow characteristics, then field tested. The system performed well in a simulation experiment, digging a sizable hole on a sand flat. Limited testing aboard ship indicates that the system performs adequately there as well. Along with meeting the design criteria of performance, durability, portability, and corrosion resistance, the system may be simply fabricated using a metal lathe and basic welding equipment. The cost of the system is comparable to that of presently used systems. Analysis of phenomena associated with crab pot pumping, such as hose drag and nozzle reaction forces, was also performed...|$|R

40|$|Background: Anastomotic leakage {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{complications}} that can occur after an esophagectomy. We report on the advantages of a computer-controlled <b>portable</b> vacuum <b>pump</b> system, ThopazR, for intraluminal continuous decompression and drainage in the non-surgical management of cervical anastomotic leakage. Method: Continuous decompression with negative pressure of 20 cmH 2 O was set at the anastomotic leakage point by a naso-gastric tube or a trans-gastric decompression tube. The drainage effect was confirmed by swallowing contrast media under fluoroscopy. Results: Three successive cases with postoperative anastomotic leakage received this treatment. The treatments were successful without complication and the leakages were healed 7, 15, and 17 days after the treatments respectively. Conclusion: The management of anastomotic leakage using the <b>portable</b> <b>pump</b> system was beneficial in bringing about a prompt healing with minimum intervention. To further demonstrate the advantage of this procedure over conventional treatments, a larger data set and clinical trials are required...|$|R

25|$|In East Orleans, {{four more}} <b>portable</b> <b>pumps</b> {{were to be}} added in support of Pump Station 15 to {{increase}} the overall capacity to 1,100 cubic feet per second (31 m³/s). For the first time, the Jahncke Pump Station ran at its full capacity of 1,200 cubic feet per second (34 m³/s). Citrus Pump Station and St. Charles Pump Station each were running at half capacity because the Citrus Pump Station has to pull power from a generator {{at one of the}} other two stations.
