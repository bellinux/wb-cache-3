5|$|Silent Hill: Shattered Memories divides its {{gameplay}} {{between two}} different settings. The first section {{is set in}} a psychotherapist's office and the second in a town called Silent Hill. In the first section, the player interacts with Dr. Michael Kaufmann, a therapist who is a non-player character, from a first-person perspective. The player responds to Kaufmann's questions and completes a <b>psychological</b> <b>test,</b> fills in a questionnaire or colors pictures. The player's responses to these tests alters aspects of gameplay in the second setting, including the available areas, the physical appearance and behavior of characters encountered, and the physical appearance of the monsters. Shattered Memories returns to Kaufmann's office periodically throughout the game.|$|E
5|$|While waiting, {{he hears}} an {{explosion}} nearby, {{and leaves the}} room to investigate. He finds two men trapped by fallen components in a fire-engulfed room. Wesley helps to release one man wounded under a heavy pipe, and tries to coax the other man to leave the burning room, but the man refuses. Wesley is forced to leave the scared man inside and drags the other man to safety. Outside the room, he soon realizes this was the <b>psychological</b> <b>test.</b> Eventually, the cadets are told of the results, and Mordock is granted admission into Starfleet Academy, while Wesley is encouraged to try again next year. Mordock thanks Wesley for his help and wishes him future success. After Wesley returns to the Enterprise, Picard confides in him that he also failed the examination the first time.|$|E

40|$|M. Phil. (Industrial Psychology) Orientation: The aim of {{this study}} was to frame <b>psychological</b> <b>testing</b> in a {{specific}} and clear manner that is grounded in beneficence. This could potentially be used to positively contribute toward the development, control, and use of <b>psychological</b> <b>testing</b> in South Africa. This was attained by looking at <b>psychological</b> <b>testing</b> through a beneficence lens, so that it is grounded beyond the preventative stance of regulation, in beneficence. The principle of beneficence was explained to the participants, who were then encouraged to approach <b>psychological</b> <b>testing</b> from a beneficence perspective. Research purpose: Despite considerable literature existing on the moral principle of beneficence in various contexts, there is restricted research on its association with <b>psychological</b> <b>testing.</b> Hence, this study explored how to ground <b>psychological</b> <b>testing</b> in the moral principle of beneficence, for application in the South African workplace. This was formulated to explore the essence of beneficence as positively contributing to the welfare of others, from which actions were identified to promote understanding in grounding <b>psychological</b> <b>testing</b> in this regard...|$|R

25|$|Also {{known as}} the Corsi Span Test, this <b>psychological</b> <b>test</b> is {{commonly}} {{used to determine the}} visual-spatial memory span and the implicit visual-spatial learning abilities of an individual. Participants sit with nine wooden 3x3-cm blocks fastened before them on a 25- x 30-cm baseboard in a standard random order. The experiment taps onto the blocks a sequence pattern which participants must then replicate. The blocks are numbered on the experimenters' side to allow for efficient pattern demonstration. The sequence length increases each trial until the participant is no longer able to replicate the pattern correctly. The test can be used to measure both short-term and long-term spatial memory, depending on the length of time between test and recall.|$|E
25|$|U.S. {{head coach}} Herb Brooks had tryouts in Colorado Springs {{in the summer}} of 1979. Of the 20 players who {{eventually}} made the final Olympic roster, Buzz Schneider was the only one returning from the 1976 Olympic team. Nine players had played under Brooks at the University of Minnesota, which included Rob McClanahan, Mike Ramsey, and Phil Verchota; while four more were from Boston University: Dave Silk, Jack O'Callahan, goalie Jim Craig, and team captain Mike Eruzione. Boston University and Minnesota were perennial rivals in college hockey and the hostility carried over from some of the players on the Olympic team for the first few months. But part of Brooks' selection process was a 300-question <b>psychological</b> <b>test</b> that would give him insight on how every player would react under stress. Anyone who refused to take the test would be flunked. Brooks had to select from 68 players who started the tryout.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to his other teachings, {{he was able to}} teach a <b>psychological</b> <b>test</b> and measurement course. Because he loved the mathematical portion of the course, he changed the class to aptitude testing, which focused on scientific basis of vocational guidance. On the side, Hull also conducted research to build a machine that could perform all the correlational work for him automatically. After teaching the aptitude testing class, Clark went on to teaching an introductory class for premedical students. While teaching this class he particularly took notice of suggestion and hypnosis. This was the starting point of his experimental testing in this field in which Clark focused on the quantitative methodology in experimental psychology. After ten years of in-depth research, he wrote the book Hypnosis and Suggestibility in 1933. After writing the book, he decided to continue in experimental field by teaching this course in {{addition to}} the premedical course. Clark had a great desire to teach this course and felt as though this specific type of science was the foundation of true psychology. In 1929 he was called to the Institute of Psychology at Yale University as a research professor of psychology where he worked on the problems concerning systematic behavior theory. In 1930, he came to several conclusions about psychology: the first was that he believed that psychology is a true natural science. The second was that its primary laws are expressed quantitatively by moderate number equations and that all complex behavior or single individuals will be derived as second laws. The third was that the primary laws with the behavior (based on the condition) can also be derived as quantitative laws from the same primary equation. he and other psychologists (Neal E. Miller, John Dollard, and O.H Mower) looked into these ideas more, they sought to understand what underlined conditioned reflex and behavior while also seeking to understand Freud and others like him. This eventually led to his work that he is primarily known for: Principles of Behavior.|$|E

2500|$|The Rorschach test is a <b>psychological</b> <b>test</b> {{in which}} subjects' {{perceptions}} of inkblots are recorded and then analyzed using psychological interpretation, complex algorithms, or both. Some psychologists use this test {{to examine a}} person's personality characteristics and emotional functioning. It has been employed to detect underlying thought disorder, especially in cases where [...] patients are reluctant to describe their thinking processes openly. The test is named after its creator, Swiss psychologist Hermann Rorschach. In the 1960s, the Rorschach was {{the most widely used}} projective test.|$|E

2500|$|In psychology, the Stroop {{effect is}} a {{demonstration}} of interference in the reaction time of a task. When {{the name of a}} color (e.g., [...] "blue", [...] "green", or [...] "red") is printed in a color that is not denoted by the name (e.g., the word [...] "red" [...] printed in blue ink instead of red ink), naming the color of the word takes longer and is more prone to errors than when the color of the ink matches the name of the color. The effect is named after John Ridley Stroop, who first published the effect in English in 1935. The effect had previously been published in Germany in 1929. The original paper {{has been one of the}} most cited papers in the history of experimental psychology, leading to more than 700 replications. The effect has been used to create a <b>psychological</b> <b>test</b> (Stroop test) that is widely used in clinical practice and investigation.|$|E
2500|$|Clinical {{assessment}} can {{be characterized}} as a prediction problem where the purpose of assessment is to make inferences (predictions) about past, present, or future behavior. For example, many therapy decisions are {{made on the basis of}} what a clinician expects will help a patient make therapeutic gains. Once observations have been collected (e.g., <b>psychological</b> <b>test</b> results, diagnostic impressions, clinical history, X-ray, etc.), there are two mutually exclusive ways to combine those sources of information to arrive at a decision, diagnosis, or prediction. One way is to combine the data in an algorithmic, or [...] "mechanical" [...] fashion. Mechanical prediction methods are simply a mode of combination of data to arrive at a decision/prediction of behavior (e.g., treatment response). Mechanical prediction does not preclude any type of data from being combined; it can incorporate clinical judgments, properly coded, in the algorithm. The defining characteristic is that, once the data to be combined is given, the mechanical approach will make a prediction that is 100% reliable. That is, it will make exactly the same prediction for exactly the same data every time. Clinical prediction, on the other hand, does not guarantee this, as it depends on the decision-making processes of the clinician making the judgment, their current state of mind, and knowledge base.|$|E
