5|$|In these areas, a Bulgarian {{resistance}} emerged, {{taking advantage}} of the Byzantine civil wars after the death of Tzimiskes in 976, led by the four sons of a count (comes) Nicholas, who became known as the Cometopuli ("sons of the count"). The most capable amongst them, Samuel, revived the Bulgarian realm, now centered in Macedonia, and was crowned Tsar in 997. A formidable warrior, he led raiding campaigns into Byzantine territory as far south as the Peloponnese, and he engaged the Byzantine emperor Basil II (r. 976–1025) in a series of wars resulting in the final conquest of the Bulgarian state by the Byzantines in 1018. Nevertheless, due to the events of 971, the Byzantines would never regard him as anything other than a rebel against imperial authority, let alone concede the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>equality</b> enjoyed by the Bulgarian rulers before 971.|$|E
5|$|At {{the federal}} level, Scientology lost a {{complaint}} against continued surveillance by the BfV in November 2004. The federal court based its opinion on its judgment that the aims of Scientology, as outlined by L. Ron Hubbard in his writings, were incompatible with the German constitution. Lawyers acting for the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution pointed out that Hubbard had written that civil rights, for example, should be restricted to Scientologists, and they asserted that the Scientology organization was taking systematic steps to infiltrate society and government institutions {{in order to prevent}} anti-Scientology legislation. Opposing counsel acting for the Church of Scientology had contended that Scientology was non-political, its aims were the liberation of the human being, and that Hubbard's instructions were valid only within the Church of Scientology and were subject to interpretation, and at any rate there was no effort to implement these instructions in Germany. The court disagreed and ruled that many sources, some of them not accessible to the general public, indicated that the aims of the Church of Scientology did include the abrogation of the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>equality</b> and other essential human rights.|$|E

40|$|It is {{the aim of}} {{this article}} to analyse {{the true nature of the}} {{relationship}} between the <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>equality</b> and legal certainty in European law, in particular within harmonised fields of European taxation. This relationship has been at issue in a recent case of the Court of Justice on VAT, where it is manifest as a specification of the relationship between primary and secondary EU law. The Court's decision gives rise to difficult questions far beyond the rather intricate tax law problem ostensibly at the heart of the proceedings. Taking the decision of the Court as a starting point, the article examines these deeper questions and proposes a sustainable solution for situations where the <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>equality</b> and legal certainty point into different directions...|$|R

25|$|Another {{controversy}} {{involved the}} Reparations Agreement between Israel and West Germany. Should kibbutz members turn over income {{that was the}} product of a very personal loss? If Holocaust survivors were allowed to keep their reparation money, what would that mean for the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>equality?</b> Eventually, many kibbutzim made this one concession to inequality by letting Holocaust survivors keep all or a percentage of their reparations. Reparations that were turned over to the collective were used for building expansion and even recreational activities.|$|E
25|$|While {{the sword}} and scales are {{traditional}} attributes of Iustitia, the Bernese statue's blindfold is a novelty; only later did it become a common element in personifications of Justice {{and a general}} symbol for the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>equality</b> before the law. The blindfold implies that justice {{ought to be done}} without respect to rank or standing; that a just verdict is arrived at through introspection rather than with a view to outward looks. Gieng's Iustitia is a symbol of republican justice, and was a forceful public reminder of the Bernese Republic's authority through law.|$|E
25|$|The <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>equality</b> {{was taken}} {{extremely}} seriously {{up until the}} 1970s. Kibbutzniks did not individually own tools, or even clothing. Gifts and income received from outside were {{turned over to the}} common treasury. If a member received a gift in services—like a visit to a relative or a trip abroad paid for by a parent—there could be arguments at members' meetings about the propriety of accepting such a gift. Up until recently, members ate meals together in the communal dining hall. This was seen as an important aspect of communal life.|$|E

He asserted that the meeting was not for his legacy or for improving the popularity of the Kuomintang, but for the good of the next generation. Foreign Minister David Lin said the Ma–Xi meeting will focus on cross-strait peace and stability without involving any political negotiations nor leading to any downgrading of Taiwan's status, but that it would be held under the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>equality</b> and dignity with proper courtesy.|$|E
25|$|Changing {{religion}} on one's card {{is extremely}} difficult, {{especially for those}} who are converting from Islam. The Catholic charity Aid to the Church in Need, claims that conversion to Christianity remains prohibited in practise even though Article 46 of the Constitution says that the state guarantees freedom of belief and religion. Therefore, according to the Vital Statistics Office, a Muslim who is baptised a Christian is still a Muslim. This means that a former Muslim cannot change his or her identity papers to show a new religion or name. The charity claims that the lack of a law on conversion from Islam to another religion leaves the matter in the hands of judges who must choose between Sharia and the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>equality</b> of all citizens before the law.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1930s, changes and {{developments}} in world politics required Turkey to make multilateral agreements {{to improve its}} security. Mustafa Kemal strongly believed that a close cooperation between the Balkan states based on the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>equality</b> would have an important effect on European politics. These states had been ruled by the Ottoman Empire for centuries, and had formed a powerful force. While {{the origins of the}} Balkan agreement may date back as far as 1925, the Balkan Pact came to being in the mid-1930s. Several important developments in the Balkan Peninsula and in Europe helped the original idea to materialize, such as improvements in the Turkish-Greek alliance and the rapprochement between Bulgaria and Yugoslavia. The most important factor in driving Turkish foreign policy from the mid-1930s onwards was the fear of Italy. Benito Mussolini had frequently proclaimed his intention to make the entire Mediterranean Mare Nostrum. Both the Turks and the various Balkan states felt threatened by Italian ambitions.|$|E
25|$|Some kibbutzim {{have been}} {{involved}} in legal actions related to their status as kibbutzim. Kibbutz Glil Yam, near Herzliya, petitioned the court regarding privatization. In 1999, eight members of kibbutz Beit Oren applied to the High Court of Justice to order the registrar of cooperative societies to declassify Beit Oren as a kibbutz and reclassify it as a different kind of cooperative society. The petitioners argued that the Kibbutz had dramatically changed its life style, having implemented differential salaries, closing the communal dining room, and privatizing the educational system and other services. These changes did not fit the legal definition of a kibbutz, and in particular, the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>equality</b> in consumption. Consequently, the registrar of cooperative societies, who has the authority to register and classify cooperative societies, should change the classification of kibbutz Beit Oren. The kibbutz responded that it still maintained the basic principles of a kibbutz, but the changes made were vital to prevent a financial collapse and to improve the economic situation.|$|E
25|$|The {{capacity}} for suffering and enjoying things {{is a prerequisite}} for having interests at all, a condition that must be satisfied before we can speak of interests in any meaningful way. It would be nonsense {{to say that it was}} not in the interests of a stone to be kicked along the road by a schoolboy. A stone does not have interests because it cannot suffer. Nothing that we can do to it could possibly make any difference to its welfare. A mouse, on the other hand, does have an interest in not being tormented, because it will suffer if it is. If a being suffers, there can be no moral justification for refusing to take that suffering into consideration. No matter what the nature of the being, the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>equality</b> requires that its suffering be counted equally with the like suffering—in so far as rough comparisons can be made—of any other being. If a being is not capable of suffering, or of experiencing enjoyment or happiness, there is nothing to be taken into account.|$|E
