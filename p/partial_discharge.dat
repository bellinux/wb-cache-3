When two bodies are rubbed together to produce electricity in the usual way, one at least must be an insulator. During the act of rubbing, the particles of opposite kinds must be brought more or less closely together, the few which are most favourably circumstanced being in such close contact as to be short only of that which is consequent upon chemical combination. At such moments they may acquire by their mutual induction (1740.) and <b>partial</b> <b>discharge</b> to each other, very exalted opposite states, and when, the moment after, they are by {{the progress of the}} rub removed from each other's vicinity, they will retain this state if both bodies be insulators, and exhibit them upon their complete separation.|$|E

40|$|Power {{transformers}} {{are crucial}} in an electric power system. Failures in transformers {{can affect the}} quality and cause interruptions in the power supply. <b>Partial</b> <b>discharges</b> are a phenomenon that can cause failures in the transformers if not properly monitored. Typically, the monitoring requires high-cost corrective maintenance or even interruptions of the power system. Therefore, the development of online non-invasive monitoring systems to detect <b>partial</b> <b>discharges</b> in power transformers has great relevance since it can reduce significant maintenance costs. Although commercial acoustic emission sensors {{have been used to}} monitor <b>partial</b> <b>discharges</b> in power transformers, they still represent a significant cost. In order to overcome this drawback, this paper presents a study of the feasibility of low-cost piezoelectric sensors to identify <b>partial</b> <b>discharges</b> in mineral insulating oil of power transformers. The analysis of the feasibility of the proposed low-cost sensor is performed by its comparison with a commercial acoustic emission sensor commonly used to detect <b>partial</b> <b>discharges.</b> The comparison between the responses in the time and frequency domain of both sensors was carried out and the experimental results indicate that the proposed piezoelectric sensors have great potential in the detection of acoustic waves generated by <b>partial</b> <b>discharges</b> in insulation oil, contributing for the popularization of this noninvasive technique...|$|R
40|$|<b>Partial</b> <b>discharges</b> {{are known}} as {{indicators}} of degradation of insulation systems. In case of medium voltage overhead lines with covered conductors, the internal <b>partial</b> <b>discharges</b> indicate the degradation of insulation system, rupture or downfall of the line. The reliability and selectivity of methods to detect internal <b>partial</b> <b>discharges</b> in the covered conductors are mainly given by the level of background noise. The background noise distorts the pattern of <b>partial</b> <b>discharges</b> (PD-pattern) and decreases the capability of detection methods to recognize the features of PD-pattern corresponding to the degradation of an insulation system.
