Sensitivity and specifity in receiver operating characteristics, and positive and negative predictive value of CRP and white blood cell count were compared in 195 critically ill preterm and term newborns clinically suspected of infection. Blood cultures were positive in 33 cases. During the first 3 days after birth CRP elevation (sensitivity 75 %, specifity 86 %), leukopenia (67 %/ 90 %), neutropenia (78 %/ 80 %) and immature to total neutrophil count (I/T) ratio (78 %/ 73 %) were good diagnostic parameters, as opposed to band forms with absolute count (84 %/ 66 %) or percentage (79 %/ 71 %), thrombocytopenia (65 %/ 57 %) and toxic granulations (44 %/ 94 %). Beyond 3 days of age elevated CRP (88 %/ 87 %) was the best parameter. Increased total (84 %/ 66 %) or <b>percentage</b> <b>band</b> count (79 %/ 71 %) were also useful. Leukocytosis (74 %/ 56 %), increased neutrophils (67 %/ 65 %), I/T ratio (79 %/ 47 %), thrombocytopenia (65 %/ 57 %) and toxic granulations had a low specifity. The positive predictive value of CRP was 32 % before and 37 % after 3 days of age, that of leukopenia was 37 % in the first 3 days. CONCLUSION: During the first 3 days of life CRP, leukopenia and neutropenia were comparably good tests while after 3 days of life CRP was the best single test in early detection of neonatal septicaemia.

40|$|Pyometra is {{a common}} and lethal disease in bitches characterised by uterine {{bacterial}} infection leading to subsequent systemic illness. The objectives of the present thesis were to investigate the incidence of the disease in relation to breed and age, to assess bacteriological aspects of pyometra and to evaluate the involvement of endotoxin and prostaglandin F 2 α in the pathogenesis. Animal insurance data revealed age- and breed-dependent differences {{in the incidence of}} pyometra. On average 23 - 24 % of all bitches studied experienced pyometra before 10 years of age. Data presented in this study indicate that certain breeds have a genetic pre-disposition for pyometra. Bacteriological genotype examinations showed that pyometra is most likely caused by Escherichia coli clones originating from the normal flora of each dog, i. e. not by clones spreading between animals. The resistance among E. coli isolates from pyometra bitches against antimicrobials commonly used in canine practice was low and not likely to cause therapy failure. Data on antimicrobial resistance of E. coli from urinary tract infections were generally not suitable for selecting antimicrobial treatment of pyometra. Systemic endotoxemia was confirmed in bitches with pyometra. The plasma levels of endotoxin were correlated with concentrations of the prostaglandin F 2 α metabolite (PG-metabolite). This indicates the usefulness of PG-metabolite in the diagnosis of endotoxemia in bitches. Bitches with pyometra also had increased blood concentrations of PG-metabolite compared with bitches with cystic endometrial hyperplasia (CEH). The present study revealed that in bitches with fluid in the uterus, the analysis of PG-metabolite in combination with <b>percentage</b> <b>band</b> neutrophils can distinguish between pyometra and CEH. The levels of PG-metabolite are predictive of the severity of pyometra since they were correlated to criteria of a systemic inflammatory response and also to the length of hospitalisation. In summary, this thesis provides data on breed- and age-related differences in the incidence of pyometra, which will be helpful in future studies of the disease and breeding programmes. In addition, clarification of key bacteriological and pathophysiological characteristics of the development of pyometra can improve diagnostic and therapeutic strategies and increase survival rates...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Canine {{pyometra}} is {{a common}} disease in countries where routine spaying of young dogs is not common practice. This disease is known to lead to systemic inflammation potentially affecting multiple organs in the body, including the heart. Cardiac-specific Troponin I (cTnI) is a sensitive marker of myocardial cell damage, which can result from ischemia, trauma, toxins or inflammation. Dogs with pyometra are also exposed to anaesthesia which can potentially result in myocardial cell damage. The aims {{of the study were}} 1) to evaluate the occurrence of myocardial cell damage as indicated by increased serum concentrations of cTnI in dogs with pyometra and relate these to presence of systemic inflammation and 2) to evaluate the change in cTnI-concentrations after anaesthesia and surgery. Methods Serum cTnI concentration was measured preoperatively and one day after surgery in 46 female dogs with pyometra and 15 female dogs that underwent surgery for other reasons (ovariohysterectomy and mammary tumours). Results Forty-six female dogs of different breeds diagnosed with pyometra were included. The dogs had a median age of 8. 5 years (IQR 7. 5 – 10) and a median weight of 29 kg (IQR 9 – 32). Of the 46 dogs, 37 (80 %) fulfilled the chosen criteria for systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) at inclusion. Thirteen (28 %) of the dogs had increased cTnI concentrations (> 0. 2 μg/l) before surgery and 18 (39 %) had increased cTnI-concentrations the day after surgery. The cTnI concentrations in the 13 dogs with increased preoperative cTnI concentrations decreased in 8 dogs, increased in 4 dogs, and was unchanged in one dog. Seven dogs with nondetectable preoperative cTnI concentrations had increased postoperative concentrations. The only significant association between the studied laboratory or clinical variables (including SIRS) and cTnI concentration was preoperative <b>percentage</b> <b>band</b> neutrophils (PBN) and postoperative cTnI concentration (P = 0. 016). In total, 20 dogs (43 %) had increased pre- or postoperative cTnI concentrations. Seven dogs (15 %) had pre-or postoperative concentrations of cTnI of 1. 0 μg/l or higher. Conclusion Mild to moderate increases in cTnI appears to be common in dogs with pyometra before and after surgery, but the clinical importance of this finding is uncertain. None of the studied clinical variables were found to reliably predict increased preoperative cTnI concentrations. Because of the pre- and postoperative variation in cTnI concentrations, {{it was not possible to}} identify a negative effect of anaesthesia and surgery on myocardial cell integrity. </p...|$|R

The established sensitivity of EEG to drug intoxication and in particular to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) made that EEG has become useful as an objective measure for monitoring chronic AED therapy and in investigation of cognitive functions. Therapy with classical AEDs has become associated with slowing of EEG background rhythm and the EEG changes correlated to changes on cognitive measures. So far, {{it has not been}} tested whether the relatively new AED, levetiracetam (LEV) has a detrimental effect on the EEG background frequencies, too. MethodsDuring the time of 6 months 28 patients underwent EEG-recording and neuropsychological testing at the three timepoints: before initiating LEV therapy, after 2 months and again after 4 months after achieving plateau dosing of LEV. EEG background frequency was analysed by using the fast Fourier Transform (FFT). ResultsThe titration and the following treatment with LEV add-on showed no negative effect on any of the measures analysed. In particular it did not lead to the lower peak frequency within the alpha band, it neither decreased the <b>percentage</b> of alpha <b>band</b> nor increase the percentage of theta and delta band. In addition there could be noticed an increase of the <b>percentage</b> of beta <b>band.</b> ConclusionsOur findings demonstrate, that a LEV add-on therapy is not associated with a slowing of the EEG background frequency.

Felder alleged that from the 1994 Hell Freezes Over tour onward, Henley and Frey had [...]".. insisted that they each receive a higher <b>percentage</b> of the <b>band's</b> profits ...," [...] whereas the money had previously been split in five equal portions. Felder accused them of coercing him into signing an agreement under which Henley and Frey would receive {{three times as much}} of the Selected Works: 1972-1999 proceeds.|$|R
