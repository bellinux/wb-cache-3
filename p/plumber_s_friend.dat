Children 2 ̆ 7 s perceptions, however, may differ from those of their friends. In a sample of 369 children (second to fifth grade), the concordance between children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> and their <b>friends</b> 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of various relationship features was examined as a function of children 2 ̆ 7 s sociometric status. Rejected children 2 ̆ 7 s perceptions showed considerably lower correlations with their friends 2 ̆ 7 perceptions than did average and popular children 2 ̆ 7 s perceptions. Furthermore, rejected children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>friends</b> perceived their friendships, on average, less positively than rejected children themselves.

40|$|Using {{data from}} the UK Community Life Survey, we present the first study to examine the {{relationship}} between heterogeneity in one 2 ̆ 019 s friendship network and subjective wellbeing. We measure network heterogeneity by the extent to which one 2 ̆ 019 <b>s</b> <b>friends</b> are similar to oneself with regard to ethnicity and religion. We find that people who have friendship networks with characteristics dissimilar to themselves have lower levels of subjective wellbeing. Specifically, our two-stage least squares (2 SLS) estimates, using measures of ethnic and religious diversity based on the Herfindahl-type fractionalization index that are flipped between adjoining rural/urban areas as instruments, suggest that a standard deviation increase in the proportion of one 2 ̆ 019 <b>s</b> <b>friends</b> from different ethnic (religious) groups is associated with a decrease of 0. 276 (0. 451) standard deviations in subjective wellbeing...|$|R

The Zippy 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Friends</b> programme is designed to promote the emotional wellbeing of children aged five to eight years of age by increasing their repertoire of coping skills and by stimulating varied and flexible ways of coping with problems of day-to-day life. The programme is based around a set of six illustrated stories about a group of children, their families, friends and an imaginary stick insect called Zippy. Comprised of six modules, the programme addresses the following themes: feelings, communication, making and breaking relationships, conflict resolution, dealing with change and loss, and general coping skills. Structured into sessions, the programme is supported by a teacher 2 ̆ 7 s manual and an attractive set of teaching materials, which are designed to actively engage the children in a range of child-centered activities. Teachers participate in a structured training programme before implementing the programme in class...|$|R

40|$|Stealing thunder is a {{technique}} used in the courtroom that involves the defendant revealing self-incriminating negative information (2 ̆ 2 thunder 2 ̆ 2) before it is revealed by the prosecution {{in order to reduce}} its potential negative impact on the jury (Williams, Bourgeois, 2 ̆ 6 Croyle, 1993). The goal of the present research was to examine if stealing thunder would be useful in understanding relationship processes and address mechanisms that could account for its effectiveness. I examined whether stealing thunder with one 2 ̆ 7 s HIV+ status could affect an individual 2 ̆ 7 s dating potential. Responding to an online survey, 657 gay males read two online profiles, one written by an HIV+ romantic prospect (Alex) and one written by Alex 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>friend.</b> Participants were randomly assigned to revealer (i. e., who revealed HIV+ status: target, friend, both, or neither) and which profile (Alex 2 ̆ 7 s or Alex 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>friend)</b> they read first. Results indicated that among participants reading the Alex-written profile first, stealing thunder diminished the negative impact of his HIV+ status, resulting in a greater willingness to date and the effect was mediated by Alex 2 ̆ 7 s perceived honesty and credibility. These results support the honesty mechanism, while also contributing a real-world strategy for HIV+ males in meeting potential partners. Implications for theory and policy are discussed. ...|$|R

40|$|The CY-Pres Doctrine. -The {{court of}} {{chancery}} of New Jersey {{in the recent}} case of Brow et al. v. Condit et al. (Sept. 30, 1905), 61 Atl. Rep. 1055, refused to apply this doctrine under the following circumstances: The will of one Susan M. Corson, bearing date July 7, 1897, disposed of her residuary estate 2 ̆ 2 to the Hospital Fund for Sick Seamen at Navy Yard, Brooklyn, New York, care of Mr. John M. Wood, chaplain. 2 ̆ 2 It appears that neither {{at the time of}} the making of the will nor at any time thereafter was there a fund in existence at or in any way connected with the Brooklyn, New York, Navy Yard that could properly be designated as a 2 ̆ 2 fund for sick seamen. 2 ̆ 2 Nor was the said John M. Wood, {{at the time of the}} making the will or thereafter a chaplain at said navy yard in any proper sense of the term. He was, however, for several years previous to his death, which took place about a year after the date of the will and about the same time prior to the death of the testatrix, engaged more or less in missionary work at the said navy yard under the auspices of the American Seamen 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Friend</b> Society. His duties consisted chiefly in holding religious meetings, and although he had no official connection with the government hospital located at the said navy yard, he had, as stated in the opinion of the court, 2 ̆ 2 the privilege of ministering to the sick sailors in the hospital, presumably to such extent as his services were acceptable to them. 2 ̆ 2 Similar privileges were given to the representatives of other benevolent societies. On several occasions, whether before or after the making of her will does not appear, Mrs. Corson sent to Mr. Wood small sums of money with directions, in each instance, that he should with the money get delicacies and flowers for the sick sailors. The court found nothing in the evidence to show that the testatrix was ever interested in any charitable work at the said navy yard except as it was connected with Mr. Wood. After the death of the latter the American Seamen 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Friend</b> Society continued its work at the navy yard through other lay missionaries. It appeared, also, that the International Committee of Young Men 2 ̆ 7 s Christian Associations, one of the defendants in the case, in March, 1899, established a branch for charitable work among the sailors in the Brooklyn, New York, Navy Yard, their work being of the same kind as that carried on by the American Seamen 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Friend</b> Society, but apparently somewhat wider in its scope...|$|R

40|$|Friend {{recommendation}} {{is an important}} recommender application in social media. Major social websites such as Twitter and Facebook are all capable of recommending friends to individuals. However, most of these websites use simple friend recommendation algorithms such as similarity, popularity, or 2 ̆ 7 friend 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>friends</b> are friends, 2 ̆ 7 which are intuitive but consider few {{of the characteristics of}} the social network. In this paper we investigate the structure of social networks and develop an algorithm for network correlation-based social friend recommendation (NC-based SFR). To accomplish this goal, we correlate different 2 ̆ 7 social role 2 ̆ 7 networks, find their relationships and make friend recommendations. NC-based SFR is characterized by two key components: 1) related networks are aligned by selecting important features from each network, and 2) the network structure should be maximally preserved before and after network alignment. After important feature selection has been made, we recommend friends based on these features. We conduct experiments on the Flickr network, which contains more than ten thousand nodes and over 30 thousand tags covering half a million photos, to show that the proposed algorithm recommends friends more precisely than reference methods...|$|R
