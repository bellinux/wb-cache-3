5|$|As Vladimir Bukovsky and Semyon Gluzman <b>point</b> <b>out,</b> it is {{difficult}} for the average Soviet psychiatrist to understand the dissident's poor adjustment to Soviet society. This view of dissidence has nothing surprising about it—conformity reigned in Soviet consciousness; a public intolerance of non-conformist behavior always penetrated Soviet culture; and the threshold for deviance from custom was similarly low.|$|E

5|$|A.P. Hill has {{received}} some criticism for his ineffective performance. His actions caused {{the battle to}} begin and then escalate on July 1, despite Lee's orders not to bring on a general engagement (although historians <b>point</b> <b>out</b> that Hill kept Lee well informed of his actions during the day).

These works would soon become models for North Korean literature.
