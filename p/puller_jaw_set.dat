60|$|Dan {{looked at}} her with his <b>jaws</b> <b>set</b> grimly, and a steely gleam in his steady gray eyes.|$|R
60|$|Two {{days after}} this, when Arthur {{was in his}} consultingroom, Haddo's card was brought to him. Arthur's <b>jaw</b> <b>set</b> more firmly.|$|R
60|$|The candy man laughed harshly, {{and looked}} up, with his thin <b>jaw</b> <b>set,</b> while {{he wiped his}} {{forehead}} with a red-and-blue handkerchief.|$|R
60|$|The canoe ran alongside, and a {{half-breed}} handed up a dirty note. Grahame opened it, and his <b>jaws</b> <b>set</b> and {{a curious}} glint {{came into his}} eyes when he read Evelyn's message.|$|R
6000|$|And {{trotting}} by his side, {{with her}} <b>jaw</b> <b>set</b> very firm, his little bulldog looked up above her eyes, {{and seemed to}} say: 'It was time we left that man of action!' ...|$|R
60|$|Andre-Louis--his mind ever on Vilmorin, whose {{case was}} here repeated, {{even to the}} details--was swept by a gust of passion. He clenched his hands, and his <b>jaws</b> <b>set.</b> Danton's little eyes {{observed}} him keenly.|$|R
60|$|Harding sighed; but his <b>jaws</b> <b>set</b> determinedly. He {{had been}} taught, as a child, that the sweetest apples {{hang on the}} highest branches: they {{are not easy to}} reach, but, once secured, they are worth the having.|$|R
6000|$|... "Keep off," [...] she cried, [...] "you can't lead them! They don't want {{to cross}} the track, but they've got to if I <b>pull</b> the <b>jaws</b> off them." ...|$|R
50|$|This {{creates a}} forward 'pulling' force to <b>pull</b> the upper <b>jaw</b> forward.|$|R
60|$|The {{master of}} Oak Hall {{had gotten to}} his feet and the two men stood facing each other. Doctor Clay had his <b>jaw</b> <b>set,</b> and never had the {{students}} seen him look so determined. He was no longer a kindly schoolmaster, he was a judge, and a stern judge at that.|$|R
50|$|Having {{broken his}} jaw in a boxing match, he could pull {{grotesque}} faces by <b>pulling</b> his <b>jaw</b> over his upper lip. This {{is described in}} {{the first volume of}} Dawson's autobiography A Clown Too Many.|$|R
60|$|Rotherby, {{his great}} <b>jaw</b> <b>set,</b> his hands clenched and eyes blazing, stood irresolute {{between her and}} Mr. Caryll. Jenkins, in sheer terror, now sank limply to a chair, whilst Gaskell looked on--a perfect servant--as {{immovable}} outwardly and unconcerned {{as if he had}} been a piece of furniture. Then his lordship turned again to Caryll.|$|R
6000|$|FREDA turns {{slowly and}} looks up at SIR WILLIAM; he involuntarily [...] raises his hand to his mouth. Her eyes travel on to LADY [...] CHESHIRE, who faces her, but so deadly pale that she looks as if [...] she were going to faint. The girl's gaze passes on to BILL, [...] {{standing}} rigid, with his <b>jaw</b> <b>set.</b>|$|R
60|$|Hobson's square <b>jaw</b> was <b>set</b> {{a little}} tighter, and his narrow eyes flashed.|$|R
40|$|The dosimetric {{characteristics}} of a standard Varian 52 -leaf multileaf collimator (MLC) and BrainLAB m 3 micro-multileaf collimator (micro-MLC) have been investigated for square, rectangular, and irregular fields for 6 MV and 18 MV photon beams provided by a Varian Clinac 2300 C/D linear accelerator (linac). The percentage depth dose data and the conventional collimator factor are unaffected {{by the addition of}} MLC or micro-MLC shaped field unless, in the latter case, the tertiary field is much less than the <b>jaw</b> <b>setting.</b> However, relative dose factors for a given MLC or micro-MLC field size depend on the <b>jaw</b> <b>setting.</b> The penumbra is generally sharpest for fields defined by the micro-MLC and the least sharp for fields defined by the MLC. Average transmission values were found to be between 1. 5 % and 2. 5 %. Comparison and evaluation of two treatments, one delivered using the MLC and the other using the micro-MLC, for the same radiosurgical target volume are described...|$|R
6000|$|His film-image appeared, {{approaching}} Bradshaw. [...] "Now, Mr. Bradshaw," [...] {{his image}} said, [...] "this won't hurt you at all, and it'll help us a lot." [...] The image rotated the {{controls on the}} shock box. Bradshaw stiffened, and his <b>jaw</b> <b>set,</b> but otherwise he gave no sign. The image of Harris regarded him for a time and then {{stepped away from the}} controls.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Independent four-jaw chuck, {{with the}} <b>jaws</b> {{independently}} <b>set.</b> The key {{is used to}} adjust each jaw separately.|$|R
6000|$|Lambert, with quiet, upturned face, {{watched the}} master of the house descend slowly step by step, and Morton, {{contrasting}} the two men, awaited the collision with rising apprehension. The Western man seemed so small, so inoffensive in manner, in contrast with the grizzled, insolent face of the sullen old man approaching with heavy <b>jaw</b> <b>set</b> at a bull-dog angle. [...] "Well, sir, what is it?" [...] he contemptuously inquired.|$|R
6000|$|... "You have fooled me, animal," [...] he cried. His <b>jaw</b> <b>set,</b> and {{his eyes}} {{continued}} to regard me with an evil glow. Then he laughed terribly, shrugged his shoulders, and spoke again. [...] "After all, it shall avail you little." [...] He turned to the carnifex. [...] "Federigo, do your work," [...] said he, whereupon the fellow stepped behind me, and the halberdiers ranged themselves one {{on either side of}} me again.|$|R
60|$|She {{stood in}} front of the door, her <b>jaws</b> were <b>set</b> and there was a bright, hard light in her eyes.|$|R
60|$|Jeers and scornful {{laughter}} {{followed him}} out of the igloo, but his <b>jaw</b> was <b>set</b> and he went his way, looking neither to right nor left.|$|R
40|$|Simple tool used in {{conjunction}} with conventional vernier caliper to measure outside diameter of round post or tube to which lateral access limited. Chuck-like jaws closed gently onto end of post or tube. Tool slipped off without changing <b>jaw</b> <b>setting,</b> and distance between jaws measured with vernier caliper. In original application, posts are liquid-oxygen-injector posts surrounded by forest of many such posts on rocket engine. Used in other applications in which desire to measure diameters despite limited lateral access, provided there is longitudinal access...|$|R
6000|$|According to the Dyaks, {{the only}} animal the Orang {{measures}} his strength {{with is the}} crocodile, who occasionally seizes him on his visits to the water side. But {{they say that the}} Orang is more than a match for his enemy, and beats him to death, or rips up his throat by <b>pulling</b> the <b>jaws</b> asunder! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! At last you come! Elle vous attend!" [...] She passed him, and Soames went in {{with his}} {{noiseless}} step, his <b>jaw</b> firmly <b>set,</b> his eyes furtive.|$|R
60|$|General Lodge himself {{explained}} {{the difficulties of}} the situation and what the young surveyor was expected to do. Neale flushed with pride; his eyes flashed; his <b>jaw</b> <b>set.</b> But he said little while the engineers led him out {{to the scene of the}} latest barrier. It was a rugged gorge, old and yellow and crumbled, cedar-fringed at the top, bare and white at the bottom. The approach to it was through a break in the walls, so that the gorge really extended both above and below this vantage-point.|$|R
5000|$|Before <b>Jaws</b> <b>set</b> {{box office}} {{records in the}} summer of 1975, {{successful}} films, such as Quo Vadis, The Ten Commandments, Gone with the Wind, and Ben-Hur, were called blockbusters based purely on the amount of money earned at the box office. Jaws is regarded as the first film of New Hollywood's [...] "blockbuster era" [...] with its current meaning, implying a film genre. It also consolidated the [...] "summer blockbuster" [...] trend, through which major film studios and distributors planned their entire annual marketing strategy around a big release by July 4.|$|R
5000|$|If {{this were}} a photo session, you couldn't have asked for more. The model, {{long-haired}} with steely gaze and wispy guerrillero beard. Jacket zipped to the chin. Collar up and hair uncombed. <b>Jaw</b> <b>set</b> in anger. Beret at a perfect, rakish tilt. There's tension even in his pose: his shoulders turning one way, his face another. And those eyes, mournful but defiant, staring up {{and to the right}} as if at some distant vision of the future, or a giant, slow-approaching foe. [...] Ben Ehrenreich, The Los Angeles Times ...|$|R
50|$|The philosopher <b>pulled</b> {{the lower}} <b>jaw</b> of the hen.My sons have bought the mirrors of the Duke.The cat of my aunt is more treacherous than the dog of your uncle.|$|R
60|$|Some of {{the riders}} led the horses away toward the corrals. Bostil wheeled {{to face the}} north again. His brow was lowering; his cheek was pale and sunken; his <b>jaw</b> was <b>set.</b>|$|R
60|$|Vane, the Bison pitcher, surely had {{his work}} cut out for him. For one {{sympathetic}} moment I saw his part through his eyes. My Worcester veterans, long used to being under fire, were relentlessly bent on taking that game. It showed in many ways, particularly in their silence, because they were seldom a silent team. McCall hesitated a moment over his bats. Then, as he picked up the lightest one, I saw his <b>jaw</b> <b>set,</b> and I knew he intended to bunt. He was lame, yet he meant to beat out an infield hit. He went up scowling.|$|R
25|$|The pipe wrench, or Stillson wrench, is an {{adjustable}} wrench used for turning soft iron {{pipes and fittings}} with a rounded surface. The design of the adjustable jaw allows it to rock in the frame, such that any forward pressure on the handle tends to <b>pull</b> the <b>jaws</b> tighter together. Teeth angled {{in the direction of}} turn dig into the soft pipe. The pipe wrench was invented by Daniel C. Stillson in 1869.|$|R
60|$|We {{sat down}} to a hasty breakfast, {{in the middle of}} which the Celebrity arrived. His {{appearance}} was unexceptionable, but his heavy <b>jaw</b> was <b>set</b> in a manner which should have warned Mr. Cooke not to trifle with him.|$|R
500|$|<b>Jaws</b> <b>set</b> the {{template}} for many subsequent horror films, {{to the extent}} that the script for Ridley Scott's 1979 science fiction film Alien was pitched to studio executives as [...] "Jaws in space". Scott would later reveal in a 2017 interview that Jaws had made a lasting impression, [...] "I was always put off from swimming ever since I watched Jaws," [...] says Scott. [...] "I quite liked swimming, actually, and I'd occasionally dive, but once I saw Jaws there was no way I was ever going to learn to surf – no way! Because I can imagine my legs, my little pinkies hanging underneath the surfboard and I know I'm going to be the one." ...|$|R
50|$|After {{years of}} {{disorganization}} and scattered existence, American taxidermy witnessed a sudden rebirth {{in the early}} 1970s. Taxidermy schools opened, igniting hopes of success in prospective artists. In 1971, for instance, the National Taxidermy Association was formed after years of unsuccessful organization. Similarly, in 1974, a trade magazine called Taxidermy Review began sponsoring national competitions. For {{the first time in}} history, American taxidermists had a chance to collaborate and discuss specific processes in the taxidermy process such as gluing tongues into <b>jaw</b> <b>sets</b> or accurately measuring the carcass of a squirrel. The majority of such techniques are still used in taxidermy shops today, allowing practitioners to prepare specimens as realistically as possible.|$|R

6000|$|A sort of dumb anger showed {{itself in}} his face; his <b>jaw</b> was <b>set</b> so firmly {{that he did}} not seem able at once to open it. He asked, without the ceremonies of greeting, [...] "What does that {{one-armed}} Dutchman do on this book?" ...|$|R
