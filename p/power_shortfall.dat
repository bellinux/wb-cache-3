5000|$|The report {{opined that}} Ashraf's {{performance}} as minister was [...] "tainted by failures {{to overcome the}} <b>power</b> <b>shortfall</b> that continued to aggravate even after he was replaced" [...] and that his actions and responses {{both inside and outside}} the National Assembly had [...] "not been translated into actions" [...] Nevertheless, about 3,570 megawatts of power was added to the national grid during the PPP government, a major portion of which came during Ashraf's term in office. His term is said to have overseen relatively more megawatts being added to the national grid when compared to other ministers of power and energy since Benazir Bhutto's last government. He was accused of receiving kickbacks in the rental power projects, and of using illegal money to buy foreign property. Ashraf denied the charges, and as of June 2012, was defending himself before the Supreme Court. No official charges have been framed against him as no evidence could be presented so far.|$|E
50|$|An ongoing {{problem with}} the engines was their {{propensity}} for surging or stalling with 68 incidents reported between 2003 and October 2016 though this rate had reduced after {{the introduction of the}} Block 3 engine version. The US Naval Air Systems Command intends to award Rolls Royce two contracts to examine the effectiveness of proposed reliability improvements, the first is a software tweak to the engine management software for the compressor guide vanes that internal testing showed could improve surge margin by 0.8% at sea level and 3% at altitude. The second is the discovery that a temperature sensor at the inlet of the compressor sends incorrect readings leading to 2.5% out of 4% steady <b>power</b> <b>shortfall</b> at the compressors correct rotational speed again correctable with a software fix. In addition Bell-Boeing are developing an inlet barrier system to reduce the power loss from the engine ingesting dust and sand particles to supplement the engines existing centrifugal based particle separators as they {{can only do so much}} to improve the quality of air they receive.|$|E
40|$|This paper models {{the real}} {{investment}} and financial portfolio decisions of a regulated utility, selling power at fixed prices to consumers and buying power in an unregulated spot market. Consumer demand is stochastic {{and subject to}} large shocks. Utilities can either meet consumers' demand by buying power on the spot market or by adding capacity. The risk associated with a surge in consumer demand can be hedged by trading in a financial derivatives market. Solving for the optimal policy for an individual utility, we show that, as <b>power</b> <b>shortfalls</b> increase, the optimal hedge position is a nonlinear mixture of price risk and quantity risk hedging. We then examine the aggregate impact of these hedging positions and show that the spot price process shifts from a marginal-cost-based regime to a regime based on aggregate financial capacity of the power industry. Although individual utilities, acting as price takers, can lower their expected <b>power</b> <b>shortfalls</b> by hedging with derivatives, derivative demand in the aggregate increases spot price volatility when power default occurs, and may thus {{increase the number of}} power defaults. At the same time, punitive regulatory penalties for power defaults may actually increase aggregate defaults by encouraging utilities to hedge outage risks through derivative markets rather than through increased capacity...|$|R
30|$|On {{the other}} hand, a large remote area can host {{multiple}} isolated MGs, {{each with a}} different operator (owner). This is highly probable because of the incentives that the governments are offering to attract private investors, for building and operating renewable sources [8]. In such a case, to improve the reliability, resiliency and self-healing of isolated MGs, it is suggested in [9, 10, 11] that they {{have some sort of}} physical connections amongst themselves to support each other during emergencies. The concept of coupled MGs (CMGs) has been proposed in [12] in which two or more neighboring MGs of a remote area can interconnect provisionally, to support each other during emergencies, such as <b>power</b> <b>shortfalls,</b> excessive generation and short-circuit faults [13].|$|R

Smart windows with electrochromic characteristics {{can be one of}} the solutions for <b>power</b> <b>shortfall.</b> In this study ionic liquid BMIMBr is successfully synthesized by the reflux method. Ionogels comprising of ionic liquid and polymers Polyaniline and Polypyrrol were electrochemically deposited by galvanostatic methods. These films are structurally characterized by XRD and SEM. Concentration of monomer and ionic liquid was changed in order to study the effect on electrochemical and electrochromic properties. The electrochromic character was analyzed by optical studies and colour change was evident at different potentials. To further investigate the electron transport properties electrical conductivity studies were carried out. In a nutshell different parameters are studied with respect to concentration and temperature so that best material could be obtained showing high optical contrast and stability. Taking these studies in account an effective electrochromic device can be fabricated...|$|E
40|$|A {{projected}} <b>power</b> <b>shortfall</b> {{during the}} initial utilization flights of the International Space Station Alpha (ISSA) has prompted an inquiry into {{the use of the}} Tethered Satellite System (TSS) to provide station power. The preliminary design of the combined ISSA/TSS system is currently underway in the Preliminary Design Office at the Marshall Space Flight Center. This document focuses on the justification for using a tether system on space station, the physical principles behind such a system, and how it might be operated to best utilize its capabilities. The basic components of a simple DC generator are a magnet of some type and a conductive wire. Moving the wire through the magnetic field causes forces to be applied to the electric charges in the conductor, and thus current is induced to flow. This simple concept is the idea behind generating power with space-borne tether systems. The function of the magnet is performed by the earth's magnetic field, and orbiting a conductive tether about the earth effectively moves the tether through the field...|$|E
30|$|It {{is to be}} {{emphasized}} that, this paper has only focused on the SEC, which is an agent within the central controller of the remote area, as shown in Fig.  1. Hence, the central controller in the remote area is an entity that represents all MGs fairly and coordinates their operation during emergencies, such as <b>power</b> <b>shortfalls,</b> excessive generation and short-circuit faults, which have resulted in unacceptable voltage or frequency deviation. On top of the proposed SEC and independent from that, each MG has a secondary controller, {{which is owned by}} the respective operator of MG. And one of its functionalities is predicting the MG’s demand and the expected generation from NDDs in various horizons, e.g., year, season, month, day, 60 -min, 30 -min ahead, to be able to optimally operate the MG [61, 62, 63, 64].|$|R
40|$|Germany's nuclear {{phase-out}} and {{the strong}} increase of fluctuating generation from renewable sources put its power system reliability under stress. Besides grid expansion and additional generation capacities load management {{seems to be an}} appropriate measure for reducing the risk of <b>power</b> <b>shortfalls.</b> Load management adjusts electricity consumption to generation and thus has an effect on the electricity grid comparable to conventional energy storages. This study focusses on southern Germany and investigates whether and to what extent load management in industrial and commercial processes can {{have a positive impact on}} security of supply. For collecting the necessary data from industrial and commercial businesses an online survey (> 300 responses) and ten interviews have been carried out. As a result the load management potential for cross-sectoral technologies and energy-intensive processes is estimated to exceed one gigawatt in southern Germany. Moreover, it has been found that load management could be a cost-effective alternative to conventional peak-load power plants...|$|R
40|$|Growing {{concern about}} climate change has led to {{significant}} interest in renewable energy resources such as wind energy. However, such non-storable energy sources present a significant issue – how to maintain continuity of supply {{in the event of}} possible disturbances to power production. For example, in the case of wind energy, such disturbances can result from extreme weather events due to frontal systems or rapidly evolving low pressure systems. Such events cannot be avoided, but if they can be accurately forecast, their impact can be minimized by ensuring that alternative sources are available to make up any <b>power</b> <b>shortfalls.</b> Thus as wind energy makes up an ever greater component of our energy supply, there is greater interest in developing models to produce accurate, local scale, wind-focused forecasts for wind farm sites that push the boundaries of current weather prediction techniques. In this article we present a case study focusing on the Woolnorth wind farm on the northwest tip of Tasmania, to highlight some of the key challenges that will be involved in developing such forecasts...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the control and}} protection of a microgrid that is connected to utility through back-to-back converters. The back-to-back converter connection facilitates bidirectional power flow between the utility and the microgrid. These converters can operate in two different modes-one in which a fixed amount of power is drawn from the utility {{and the other in}} which the microgrid <b>power</b> <b>shortfall</b> is supplied by the utility. In the case of a fault in the utility or microgrid side, the protection system should act not only to clear the fault but also to block the back-to-back converters such that its dc bus voltage does not fall during fault. Furthermore, a converter internal mechanism prevents it from supplying high current during a fault and this complicates the operation of a protection system. To overcome this, an admittance based relay scheme is proposed, which has an inverse time characteristic based on measured admittance of the line. The proposed protection and control schemes are able to ensure reliable operation of the microgrid...|$|E
40|$|Pakistan {{energy demand}} has grown {{exponentially}} {{over the last}} 2 decades. Reason behind increasing energy demand is excessive mobility of rural population to cities, rapid progression in industrial and transport sector, lack of policy making and implementation on the developed policies and improvements in living style. At present, Pakistan witness 5000 - 7000 MW power deficit in summer. To reduce the demand and supply gap, power plants across Pakistan are planned to be installed while some are under development phase. Power expansion plans cannot cope with the current energy shortfall since several years are required {{for them to get}} fully operational. Effective energy policy is the only key to address the existing shortfall. This paper discusses the initiatives that may be taken to reduce the <b>power</b> <b>shortfall</b> using energy efficiency and conservation, deployment of microgrids, utilization of renewable energy resources and effective research and development in energy sector. Since another most important issue evaluated in the research regarding the energy crises is energy efficiency and lack of compliance to government regulations for energy efficiency and conservation. Implementation on the policies developed for energy efficiencies and conservation has not been witnessed. Possible solutions on short term basis to lessen the energy crises have also been discussed in the pape...|$|E
40|$|Pakistan {{has been}} {{experiencing}} energy crisis owing to its sole dependence on fossil fuels. Reduction in local fossil fuel reserves {{has led to}} an increase in their prices, thereby increasing the cost of electricity. Since the tariff remains the same, Pakistan is over-burdened with circular debts and observes a daily <b>power</b> <b>shortfall</b> of about 12 – 14  h. Being an Agra-economic country, many major and minor crops are produced and exported in large quantities. This results in a bulk of the agricultural waste which are not utilized. The waste can be utilized to meet the country’s energy demand while mitigating climate change and its impact. The study examines the electricity production potential and social benefits of rice husk in Pakistan. It is estimated in this study that if 70 % of rice husk residues are utilized, there will be annual electricity production of 1, 328  GWh and the cost of per unit electricity by rice husk is found at 47. 36  cents/kWh as compared to 55. 22  cents/kWh of electricity generated by coal. Importantly, the study will increase the awareness of the benefits of utilizing agricultural waste for useful products such as silica, with several social and environmental benefits such as a reduction of 36, 042 tCO 2 e/yr of methane, reducing carbon dioxide emissions, improving the air quality, and providing 4. 5  k new jobs.

50|$|By today's standards, the dam was {{unremarkable}} - a wall {{of granite}} and limestone, 65 feet high and 1,100 feet long, with no catwalk or floodgates. But Scientific America magazine was sufficiently impressed to feature the dam on its cover. However, structurally the dam was likely doomed from the start, as it was constructed on {{the spot where the}} Balcones Fault passes under the river. Silt had filled nearly half the lake by February 1900, and the dam's design failed to accommodate the force that could be created by a large volume of water. However, the flow of the Colorado proved to be far more variable than the project's promoters had claimed, and the dam was never able to produce the kind of steady power needed to drive a bank of mills. The manufacturers never came, periodic <b>power</b> <b>shortfalls</b> disrupted city services, Lake McDonald silted up, and, on April 7, 1900, the Austin Dam was dealt its final blow after a spring storm. At 11:20 am, floodwaters crested at 11 feet atop the dam before it disintegrated, with two 250-foot sections - almost half the dam - breaking away. In all, the flood drowned 18 people and destroyed 100 houses in Austin, at a total estimated loss of $1.4 million, in 1900 dollars.|$|R
30|$|For {{renewable}} applications, it {{is common}} to use ESS for energy time-shift and capacity firming. The energy time shift increases the value of energy and so profits are increased. Indeed, most renewable energy resources produce a significant portion of electric energy at off-peak periods which has a low financial value. As a result, ESS can be charged and used when demand is high and supply is tight [4, 5]. By contrast, capacity firming allows the use of intermittent electric supply as a nearly constant source. Such use may reduce power-related charges and/or offset the need for equipment. Likewise, for effective renewable integration, some requirements are identified and classified in two categories. The first one is the short duration applications including the reduction of power volatility and the improvement of power quality. The second one concerns the long duration applications embracing the reduction of output variability, the transmission congestion relief, the back-up for unexpected <b>power</b> generation <b>shortfalls</b> and the minimization of load violations.|$|R

However, the optimal use local power generation and energy storage is critically dependent on the load characteristics and location of the community. In this work we compare the simulated energy generation, consumption and independence of two model developments in Melbourne and Sydney. The analysis looked at 6 basic scenarios, from the default grid dependence through to a community approach with both individual and communal PV generation and battery energy storage. The results showed {{that a combination of}} household and community owned PV and storage can reduce grid electricity import by up to 93 % for Melbourne and 96 % for Sydney, but that neither development could independently meet all its <b>power</b> requirements without <b>shortfall.</b> The shortfall arises during the winter months when PV generation is at its lowest, and no practical amount of energy storage can mitigate this.
