25|$|The Japan model {{included}} a rear-view monitor which displays {{an image of}} the area {{at the rear of the}} vehicle while backing up to reduce the burden on the driver while parking. Also, the optional Intelligent Parking Assist system supports steering operations when parallel parking and backing into a parking space. Ultrasonic sensors installed on the front of the vehicle detect other parked vehicles and, based on the results, estimate the physical dimensions of a vacant parking space and set the target <b>parking</b> <b>position.</b>|$|E

25|$|There {{are more}} factors to {{consider}} when deciding between ceiling- and floor-mounted systems. Ceiling-mounted systems require substantial ceiling space and, therefore, reduce the options to install surgical lights or booms. Nonetheless, many hospitals choose ceiling-mounted systems because they cover the whole body with more flexibility and – most importantly – without moving the table. The latter is sometimes a difficult and dangerous undertaking during surgery with the many lines and catheters that must also be moved. Moving from a parking to a working position during surgery, however, is easier with a floor-mounted system, because the C-arm just turns in from the side and does {{not interfere with the}} anesthesiologist. The ceiling-mounted system, by contrast, during surgery can hardly move to a <b>parking</b> <b>position</b> at the head end without colliding with anesthesia equipment. In an overcrowded environment like the OR, biplane systems add to the complexity and interfere with anesthesia, except for neurosurgery, where anesthesia is not at the head end. Monoplane systems are therefore clearly recommended for rooms mainly used for cardiac surgery.|$|E
25|$|Turbine {{engines in}} use on today’s turbine-powered {{aircraft}} are very reliable. Engines operate efficiently with regularly scheduled inspections and maintenance. These units can have lives ranging {{in the thousands}} of hours of operation. However, engine malfunctions or failures occasionally occur that require an engine {{to be shut down}} in flight. Since multi-engine airplanes are designed to fly with one engine inoperative and flight crews are trained to fly with one engine inoperative, the in-flight shutdown of an engine typically does not constitute a serious safety of flight issue. Following an engine shutdown, a precautionary landing is usually performed with airport fire and rescue equipment positioned near the runway. Once the airplane lands, fire department personnel assist with inspecting the airplane to ensure it is safe before it taxis to its <b>parking</b> <b>position.</b> Turboprop-powered aircraft and turboshaft-powered helicopters are also powered by turbine engines and are subject to engine failures for many similar reasons as jet-powered aircraft. In the case of an engine failure in a helicopter, it is often possible for the pilot to enter autorotation, using the unpowered rotor to slow the aircraft's descent and provide a measure of control, usually allowing for a safe emergency landing even without engine power.|$|E

50|$|The main {{passenger}} terminal {{consists of three}} interconnected buildings totaling approximately 220000 ft2 m2. The central building consists of just under 120000 ft2 m2 of space while the western and eastern wings occupy slightly more than 50000 ft2 m2 each. The apron fronting the {{passenger terminal}} has ten aircraft <b>parking</b> <b>positions,</b> each able to accommodate a Boeing 747. Only eight of the positions are usable; two are used to provide eleven helicopter <b>parking</b> <b>positions</b> and there are just seven passenger loading bridges.|$|R
50|$|Loading bridges {{restrict}} aircraft parking to spots immediately {{adjacent to}} the terminal. Thus, airports use mobile staircases to facilitate disembarking at hardstands (remote <b>parking</b> <b>positions).</b>|$|R
50|$|A. N. R. Robinson International Airport has two terminals. The International Terminal {{was once}} both the {{regional}} and international passenger terminal for the airport but has been renovated {{to serve as an}} all-international terminal.
