40|$|Two Highveld inertinite-rich lump coals were {{utilized}} as feed coal samples {{in order to}} study their physical, chemical structural and petrographic variations during heat treatment in a packed-bed reactor unit combustor. The two feed lump coals were selected as it is claimed that Coal B converts at a slower rate in a commercial coal conversion process when compared to Coal A. The reason for this requires detailed investigation. Chemical structural variations were determined by proximate and coal char CO 2 reactivity analysis. Physical structural variations were determined by FTIR, BET adsorption methods, XRD and 13 C Solid state NMR analysis. Carbon particle type analysis was conducted to determine the <b>petrographic</b> <b>constituents</b> of the reactor generated samples, their maceral associations (microlithotype), and char morphology. This analysis was undertaken {{with the intention of}} tracking the carbon conversion and char formation and consumption behaviour of the two coal samples within the reactor. Proximate analysis revealed that Coal A released 10...|$|E
40|$|We review {{models of}} chondrite {{component}} transport in the gaseous protoplanetary disk. Refractory inclusions were likely transported by turbulent diffusion and possible early disk expansion, and required low turbulence for their subsequent preservation in the disk, possibly {{in a dead}} zone. Chondrules were produced locally but did not necessarily accrete shortly after formation. Water may have been enhanced in the inner disk because of inward drift of solids from further out, but likely not {{by more than a}} factor of a few. Incomplete condensation in chondrites may be due to slow reaction kinetics during temperature decrease. While carbonaceous chondrite compositions might be reproduced in a ``two-component'' picture (Anders 1964), such components would not correspond to simple <b>petrographic</b> <b>constituents,</b> although part of the refractory element fractionations in chondrites {{may be due to the}} inward drift of refractory inclusions. Overall, considerations of chondrite component transport alone favor an earlier formation for carbonaceous chondrites relative to their noncarbonaceous counterparts, but independent objections have yet to be resolved.

40|$|The Upper Hance {{coal seam}} in southeastern Kentucy {{was used as}} a {{template}} to examine the spatial distribution of ash yield, sulfur content and <b>petrographic</b> <b>constituents</b> relative to the geometry of the deposit. Geometric characteristics include thinning and splitting of the two main benches, leaders and riders. Analytical data showed the thick, non-split portions of the coal body to be low in ash and sulfur as well as vitrinite content, whereas the thinned and split margins were higher in ash, sulfur and vitrinite content. These relationships suggest that thick non-split portions of the Upper Hance peat accumulated in areas isolated from detrital influx while thinner marginal peat was subject to intermittent flooding from adjacent channels. Marginal peat was derived from larger trees which flourished at the mire 2 ̆ 7 s edge in the presence of adequate nutrients, whereas only stunted vegetation, subsisting in the nutrient-depleted center, contributed to interior peat accumulation. Ponds formed on the sparsely vegetated mature surface of the bog 2 ̆ 7 s interior. The petrographic and chemical character of the Hance coal body is analogous to ombrogenous (domed) peats which characteristically contain higher concentrations of inorganics at the periphery of the deposit...|$|E
40|$|The Lower Cretaceous Falher Member and Gates Formation of the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin {{provide an}} {{opportunity}} to investigate high resolution stratigraphic correlation in non-marine to marginal marine rocks. This is due to the large volume of high-quality data available from subsurface cores and wireline logs in the Elmworth area, corresponding outcrops in the adjacent Rocky Mountains foothills, and outcrop and continuous core data from the Bullmoose Mine area in northeastern British Colombia. A key component of the high resolution interpretation and correlation in this region is the abundant, thick coal seams that occur in fresh mine highwalls and also in cores from the mine sites and the Elmworth area. Using coal <b>petrographic</b> <b>constituent</b> analysis and derived parameters, we are able to identify systematic variations in coal properties that respond to changes in accommodation. In particular, these properties enable us to distinguish two types of peat (transgressive and regressive) characterized by wetting- and drying-upward behaviour linked to variations in the groundwater table. They also enable recognition of a range of non-marine stratigraphic surfaces that record responses to changing accommodation, including accommodation reversal surfaces, flooding surfaces, hiatal surfaces, paludification surfaces and terrestrialization surfaces. A combination of these coal parameters, together with the facies characteristics of the surrounding non-marine and marginal marine rocks, enables recognition of distinctive high-resolution stratigraphic signatures in the rocks. This in turn provides a previously unavailable ability to correlate stratigraphic units from their downdip marine position, through the shoreline zone and into the terrestrial realm. For the Falher/Gates unit, we recognize nine regionally correlatable cycles over a vertical distance of around 300 m and a lateral distance of 80 km downdip and 150 km along strike. The basis for this detailed correlation is the similarity of the accommodation trends as seen in both the organic and clastic facies. Results show that earlier concepts of parasequences and their flooding surface boundaries in marine rocks need to be significantly modified in the terrestrial realm. Sharp hiatal parasequence boundaries in the marine realm such as flooding surfaces and wave/tidal ravinement surfaces may correlate updip to packages of rocks that pass gradationally from transgressive to regressive units and preserve the transitions between the two. Non-marine sediments may accumulate during and following shoreline regression, and prior to and during shoreline transgression. The exact style and preservation of the non-marine stratigraphic package depends on the local balance between accommodation and sediment flux at the time of deposition. Coals occur in both regressive and transgressive styles and may initiate or terminate parasequences. Coals may also occur as compound coals that span more than one parasequence and contain internal discontinuity surfaces.

40|$|Variations in the {{distribution}} of major elements and stable oxygen isotopes in ODP Leg 113 pore water are not related to lithology and thus appear to be controlled by minor <b>constituents.</b> <b>Petrographic</b> observations and geochemical considerations indicate that alteration of calc-alkalic volcanic material dispersed in the sediment is an important process. A diagenetic reaction is constructed that involves transformation of volcanic glass into smectite, zeolite (represented by phillipsite), chert, and iron sulfide. Mass balance calculations reveal that alteration of less than 10 % (volume) of volcanogenic material may account for the observed depletion of magnesium, potassium, and 18 O and enrichment of calcium. Alteration of this amount of volcanic glass produces less than 4 % (volume) of smectite and zeolite. Hence, mass balance is obtained without having to invoke unreasonable large amounts of volcanic matter or interactions between seawater and basement...|$|R
40|$|More than 600 {{refractory}} inclusions in 22 thin {{sections of}} Allende and Mokoia were studied by optical and scanning-electron microscopy. Olivinerich inclusions and Ca, Al-rich inclusions (CAI 2 ̆ 7 s) are aggregates of various combinations of three fundamental <b>petrographic</b> <b>constituents</b> : rimmed concentric objects, Ca, Si-rich chaotic material, and mafic inclusion matrix. A new classification system for refractory inclusions is developed {{that is based}} on the size and abundance of these three fundamental constituents. Olivine-rich inclusions consist primarily of inclusion matrix and are divided into two textural varieties : unrimmed olivine aggregates (Type 1 A inclusions) and rimmed olivine aggregates (Type 1 B inclusions). Many Type 1 B inclusions contain Ca, Al-rich nodules that are aggregates of concentric objects. CAI 2 ̆ 7 s consist primarily of concentric objects and are divided into three varieties : unrimmed complex CAI 2 ̆ 7 s (Type 2 inclusions), rimmed complex CAI 2 ̆ 7 s (Type 3 inclusions), and simple CAI 2 ̆ 7 s (Type 4 inclusions). Simple and complex CAI 2 ̆ 7 s are divided into melilite-rich and melilite-poor varieties. Several varieties of refractory inclusions grade into each other chemically, mineralogically, and texturally. Our new classification system avoids several problems that are inherent to other classification systems, which use the term "coarse-grained" too restrictively for many simple CAI 2 ̆ 7 s and inaccurately for most melilite-rich complex CAI 2 ̆ 7 s...|$|E
40|$|The {{strength}} of rock is significantly affected by weathering and moisture content. Due to climate {{conditions in the}} tropics, rock is weathered significantly and produces a thick weathering profile. Designing structures in rock {{with varying degrees of}} weathering creates problems due to varying material properties. This study was carried out to investigate the effects of moisture content on weathered Malaysian granite of various grades, focusing on strength which is an essential parameter in designing engineering rock structures. Weathering identification tests, Schmidt hammer tests, and impact index tests were performed at the site as part of the field study. In the laboratory, samples were analyzed for durability, point load index, moisture content, density, and X-ray diffraction (XRD), and underwent petrographic analysis to examine the mi neralogy. The results revealed that the degree of feldspars weathering and the amount of clay minerals are good weathering grade identifiers. The amount of fresh feldspar decreased from 72 % in grade I specimens to 0 % in grade V specimens, with an increase of altered feldspar and clay minerals fr om 0 to 60 %. The presence of feldspar and mica minerals above 1 % tended to increase the susceptibility of rock to the influence of water. It was also found that the reduction in strength becomes great er with an increasing weathering grade. In addition, the discolouration of rock material from greyish to brownish red also can be a good indicator of strength reduction due to moisture content. Based on the re sults, the extent of strength reduction depends upon the weathering grade, <b>petrographic</b> <b>constituents</b> and duration of water immersion...|$|E
30|$|It is {{important}} to understand the variations in the <b>petrographic</b> <b>constituents</b> of Gujarat lignites along the lignite seam profiles, from bottom to top, in order to know their evolutionary history. In the Cambay basin, brown bands are more prevalent and are mostly unstratified and contain high matrix while only few black, thin bands (V- 5, VL- 6, R- 1, and T- 7; Tables  4, 5, 6; Fig.  2) are seen. The black bands in these lignites, are relatively more strongly gelified compared to the brownish bands. More gelification could be caused as a result of anaerobic processes (Iordanidis and Georgakopoulos 2003). Various shades of darkness could also result due to different degrees of plant decomposition (Hagemann and Wolf (1987). The black bands have very high detro-huminite content with little bit less amount of telo-huminite content. Since macerals directly relate to the plants and environment, they provide useful guide to characterize the paleomire. Certain macerals are indicative of paleo-depositional environment, through their presence or absence, (Teichmüller 1989). The characteristics imparted to coal differ with variation in the peat forming plant communities, nutrient supply, temperature, pH, bacterial activity, redox potential and types of deposition (Teichmüller et al. 1998 a, b, c; Lin and Tian 2011). Increase in the clastic mineral matter relates to the surface inundation in the basin (Singh and Singh 1996). Petrography based facies models have been used to discuss the evolutionary history of the paleomires of the Cambay basin. Using petrological tools a number of researchers have successfully performed paleoecological reconstructions and contributions have been made by Cohen and Spackman (1972), Styan and Bustin (1983), Cohen et al. (1987), Calder et al. (1991), Grady et al. (1993), Hawke et al. (1996), Singh and Singh (1996), Shearer and Clarkson (1998), Sun et al. (1998), Dai et al. (2007), Jasper et al. (2010), Singh et al. (2010 a, b), Deng and Sun (2011), and Singh et al. (2012 a, b, c, d). Detro-huminite is throughout high in the lignites of Cambay basin wherein densinite is more consistent. With decrease in the densinite content, there is concomitant increase in the respective attrinite content. Detro-huminite is normally generated in relatively aerobic condition (Teichmüller et al. 1998 b). Moreover, the activities of physical breakdown of plant to particulate matrix are observed at the margin of the peat beds (Kuder et al. 1998). To characterize the paleomires of the Australian Permian coals, Diessel (1986) introduced two indices, gelification index (GI) and tissue preservation index (TPI). Less humified structured and strongly humified unstructured tissue derived macerals indicate the degree of humification and the vegetation type (Diessel 1992). Accordingly, a high TPI value suggests a high subsidence rate of basin and dominance of wood derived tissues, and a low TPI suggests a low subsidence rate with high humification. The degree of gelification of huminite macerals is revealed by GI which distinguishes between gelified and ungelified macerals. For gelification to take place a continuous presence of water is necessary and fluctuation in water table is likely to affect the degree of gelification. However, these indices should be calculated and used carefully. Researchers like Calder (1993) and Collinson and Scott (1987) believe that the palynological and paleobotanical data provide higher precision in the determination of paleoenvironment. Several researchers have objected the usage of such indices for Tertiary or low rank coals (Lambersen et al. 1991; Crosdale 1993; Dehmer 1995; Wust et al. 2001; Scott 2000; Moore and Shearer 2003; Amijaya and Littke 2005). Few researchers have tried a combination of petrographic, organic geochemical and/or isotope data (Bechtel et al. 2002, 2003, 2007 a, b, 2008; Mayr et al. 2009; Savard et al. 2012; Singh et al. 2012 c) for the reconstruction of paleoenvironment. Kalkreuth et al. (1991), Petersen (1993), and Flores (2002) further modified these indices to make them useful for the low rank coals too. In the present investigation, the indices have been taken from Flores (2002) which is a modified version of Kalkreuth et al. (1991), for brown coals.|$|E
