50|$|A large <b>polytunnel</b> {{which has}} been built with used tyres was {{completed}} in spring 2011. It is the new home of the two species of bat found in Durrell. The new <b>polytunnel</b> is located near the organic farm and apple orchard.|$|E
50|$|A <b>polytunnel</b> (also {{known as}} a polyhouse, hoop {{greenhouse}} or hoophouse, grow tunnel or high tunnel) is a tunnel made of polyethylene, usually semi-circular, square or elongated in shape. The interior heats up because incoming solar radiation from the sun warms plants, soil, and other things inside the building faster than heat can escape the structure. Air warmed by the heat from hot interior surfaces is retained in the building by the roof and wall. Temperature, humidity and ventilation can be controlled by equipment fixed in the <b>polytunnel</b> or by manual opening and closing of flaps. Polytunnels are mainly used in temperate regions in similar ways to glass greenhouses and row covers. Besides the passive solar heating that every <b>polytunnel</b> provides, every variation of auxiliary heating (from hothouse heating through minimal heating to unheated houses) is represented in current practice. The nesting of row covers and low tunnels inside high tunnels is also common.|$|E
50|$|Every factor {{influencing}} a crop can {{be controlled}} in a <b>polytunnel.</b> Polytunnels are often used in floriculture and plant nurseries, as the revenue value of the plants can justify the expense.|$|E
50|$|For example, in India, the {{inability}} to grow tomatoes generates price spikes during the monsoon season. This {{is seen as an}} ideal time to grow tomatoes in <b>polytunnels,</b> since they providing the ideal climate for the crop. In India, the Abhinav Farmers Club grows flowers and organic vegetables in <b>polytunnels.</b>|$|R

50|$|<b>Polytunnels</b> {{are mainly}} used in {{temperate}} regions in similar ways to greenhouses and cloches (row covers). Modern designs allow sowing and harvesting machines to move inside the structures {{so as to}} automate production. <b>Polytunnels</b> have {{had a significant effect}} on the production of strawberries in the United Kingdom. Other soft fruits such as raspberries and blackberries are also cultivated in the same way.|$|R
50|$|Although some <b>polytunnel</b> {{sites are}} illegal, Herefordshire Council has {{turned a blind}} eye in the belief that {{agriculture}} must be allowed to innovate; otherwise it will stagnate and the county will suffer.|$|E
50|$|In {{recent years}} the true {{adaptability}} of <b>polytunnel</b> structures has been realised by adapting them to suit livestock housing. Its now common place in the UK to see polytunnels used for housing, Sheep, Alpaca's, Goats, Calves and poultry to name a few.|$|E
50|$|Edna's sister Lily {{returned}} to the village in 2007 and began growing cannabis in Home Farm's <b>polytunnel.</b> She found cannabis was more effective for her arthritis than prescription medicines but Eli Dingle (Joseph Gilgun) discovered what Lily was doing at Home Farm. He blackmailed her into splitting her crop with him in return for his silence but he was selling his share.|$|E

The exhibit is linked to butterfly projects run by the zoo in Kenya and Costa Rica. The zoo also supports work to protect the rare silky wave moth in Avon Gorge.|$|E
50|$|The most northerly grape vine of the UK {{is grown}} in a <b>polytunnel</b> {{on the island}} of Unst, Shetland - the most northerly of the Shetland isles. Unfortunately the label is lost but the vine {{produces}} many bunches of small green grapes every year and by leaving them as long as possible (Sept/Oct) they are usually sweet enough to eat straight from the bunch. The majority are turned into several jars of grape jelly.|$|E

50|$|Camas has {{an organic}} garden {{that over the}} years has been taken care of by {{different}} gardeners. The bottom garden has a <b>polytunnel</b> which inside grows lettuce, tomatoes and other vegetables. The bottom garden is also home to many different herbs and sometimes fruit. As you move up the garden there are seaweed beds which grow carrots and other hardy vegetables. There is also a garden shed and igloo made from willow and a small shed hidden within the trees.|$|E
50|$|Eli {{discovered}} that pensioner Lily Butterfield was using her <b>polytunnel</b> to grow cannabis {{to help with}} her arthritis. He began to blackmail her {{so that he could}} sell some of the cannabis for money. This led to Sam Dingle becoming unwittingly involved and arrested. Sam confessed and Eli was then arrested and named Lily. Luckily, Zak and Edna destroyed the evidence, and so the police were forced to drop the charges. Zak was disgusted with Eli and once again temporarily disowned him.|$|E

Jersey Opera House saw screenings of The Doors documentary When You're Strange with a Doors covers band, and 70s pop star and Jersey resident Gilbert O'Sullivan attended his portrait documentary Out on his Own for a Q&A.|$|E
30|$|In general, higher mean trap catches were {{observed}} in the Turkey trials than in the UK trials, and this may have occurred due {{to a number of}} reasons. Firstly, the temperatures recorded in the Turkey trials were much higher than those recorded in the UK trials. This may have increased thrips’ populations in the glasshouses in Turkey compared to the <b>polytunnels</b> in UK, resulting in a greater trap catches. Other environmental factors may have also contributed to the increased mean trap catches in turkey, including less wind in the enclosed glasshouses compared to open-ended <b>polytunnels</b> which may have effects thrips’ flight, greater amounts or different types of light reflecting off the sticky traps in the glasshouses compared to the <b>polytunnels</b> {{as a result of the}} comprising materials, or the fact that the infested crops in Turkey were better hosts for F.occidentalis, therefore resulting in higher population numbers within the plants. Additionally, the efficacy of the traps may have been reduced as a result of interference between treatments in the UK trials due to wind movement patterns through the open-ended <b>polytunnels.</b> As the glasshouses in the Turkey trials were enclosed, wind would movement would have been less likely to result in interferences between treatments.|$|R
50|$|In agriculture, season {{extension}} {{is anything}} {{that allows a}} crop to be cultivated beyond its normal outdoor growing season. Examples include greenhouses, <b>polytunnels,</b> row cover, and cloches.|$|R

5000|$|The RCHQ ran {{courses and}} {{activities}} celebrating and teaching {{the skills and}} values that Whittingstall learned in his five years as a Dorset smallholder. It focused in particular upon cooking {{in tune with the}} seasons, small scale local food production, and adding value to home grown produce for taking to local markets. The courses and events were hosted by different members of the River Cottage team, including some from the television series including Ray Smith (a freelance butcher) and Michael Michaud an organic <b>polytunnel</b> expert.|$|E
5000|$|The project {{investigates the}} {{similarities}} through creating an allotment of how zoos {{and people will}} deal with future resource shortages such as peak oil, food miles, climate change, sustainability, composting and recycling compared with the original wartime resource shortages of fuel rationing, food rationing and government salvage drives in many countries around the world. Food grown on the plot is used for animal feeding and scent enrichment, something also practised {{on a large scale}} in the market garden at Durrell Wildlife Park and the Verti-Crop [...] automated hydroponics <b>polytunnel</b> at Paignton Zoo.|$|E
50|$|In 2013, {{the school}} has opened a school farm, which was the UK's 100th school farm opened. The farm was opened by actor, Sean Wilson, who played Martin Platt in the soap opera, Coronation Street. The farm has three kunekune pigs and three Tamworth pigs, a few sheep, four quails, fifteen {{chickens}} and four pygmy goats. In 2014, the farm was vandalized by presumably, students from the school. One of the pigs {{were killed by the}} vandal and spray-painted and the vandal set fire to a <b>polytunnel.</b> The farm is used as a BTEC option for students.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Polytunnels</b> {{can be used}} {{to provide}} a higher {{temperature}} and/or humidity than that which is available in the environment but can also protect crops from intense heat, bright sunlight, winds, hailstones, and cold waves. This allows fruits and vegetables to be grown at times usually considered off season; market gardeners commonly use <b>polytunnels</b> for season extension. Beyond season extension, <b>polytunnels</b> are also used to allow cold-hardy crops to overwinter in regions where their hardiness isn't quite strong enough for them to survive outdoors. Temperature increases of only 5° to 15° above outdoor ambient, coupled with protection from the drying effect of wind, are enough to let selected plant varieties grow slowly but healthily instead of dying. The effect is to simulate [...] "moving the farm south by several hardiness zones", that is, to create a microclimate that simulates the temperatures of a location several hardiness zones south (and protects from wind as well).|$|R
5000|$|For {{seedling}} {{starting in}} commercial greenhouses or <b>polytunnels,</b> pots usually {{take the form}} of trays with cells, each cell acting as one small pot. These trays are often called flats.|$|R
40|$|Charlotte Smith hears a {{court ruling}} could mean more <b>polytunnels</b> in {{protected}} landscapes. The Wye valley in Herefordshire {{has become a}} battleground between The Wye Valley Action Association and Herefordshire County Council. The valley is an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty where <b>polytunnels</b> could not be built. But a court has decided that as the land is already used for crops, the structures can now be erected. The National Farmers' Union tells Farming Today {{this is good news}} for fruit growers, but the Campaign to protect Rural England warn it will now be easier to built <b>polytunnels</b> in National Parks. Government minister Jim Paice tells Farming Today why he plans to sell off some of England's forests. The Labour Peer Baroness Jan Royall warns that unless legislation changes, all of England's forests could end up in private hands. And a visit to the Warwick Crops Centre research reveals how crops are being future-proofed to manage the heat, drought and pests which could come with climate change. Presented by Charlotte Smith.

50|$|Edward Kelly {{moved from}} London to an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty in the Wye Valley {{in the mid}} 1980s. During the late 1990s {{increasing}} trend towards use of agricultural polytunnels have come to dominate the landscape {{in some parts of}} the Wye Valley, and in particular near the artist's residence. He launched the Campaign for <b>Polytunnel</b> Control which seeks that erection of polytunnels should be controlled by planning permission, owing to their massive scale and visual impact. In relation to the campaign Edward Kelly has been interviewed by national press and has appeared in national newspapers and on TV and presented at various government hearings and government reports.|$|E
50|$|In 2001, {{a company}} limited by {{guarantee}} was set up. Its intention was to seek charitable status and {{to raise money to}} convert the mill into a museum and visitor centre. There have been 3 unsuccessful attempts to win lottery money. However a log burning heating system has been installed after an application to the Mersey Basin project and several smaller amounts of money gained that have helped to pay for tools and a <b>polytunnel.</b> In 2007, a kitchen garden was set up {{on the site of the}} former smallholding. This is maintained by volunteers. A group made up of the volunteers and local interested parties and called 'Friends of Trafford Mill' has been set up.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} pilot design {{evolved into}} a lower cost solution using a lighter steel structure, similar to a multi-span <b>polytunnel.</b> This structure {{was designed to be}} cost effective and suitable for local sourcing. The design was first tested and validated through a second seawater greenhouse that was constructed on Al-Aryam Island, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates in 2000.The year 2004 saw the completion of a third pilot seawater greenhouse near Muscat, Oman in collaboration with Sultan Qaboos University, providing an opportunity to develop a sustainable horticultural sector on the Batinah coast. These projects have enabled the validation of a thermodynamic simulation model which, given appropriate meteorological data, accurately predict and quantify how the seawater greenhousewill perform {{in other parts of the}} world.|$|E
