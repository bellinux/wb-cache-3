40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. Several {{recent studies have}} {{suggested}} that cumulative Sound Exposure Level (SEL) is an important metric for assessment of the impact of exposure to anthropogenic sound sources by various marine receptors including marine mammals and fish. This metric allows the cumulative exposure of an animal to a sound field for an extended <b>period</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>assessed</b> against a predefined impact criteria. Two widely used mitigation strategies used by both industrial and military users to reduce potential impact on marine receptors are exclusions zones (zones from source where received levels exceed a certain threshold), a source is either not started or stopped if receptors are detected within this zone and ‘soft-starts’ or ‘ramp-ups’ (lower energy levels at the commencement of a noise source allowing a receptor {{to move out of the}} area). This paper discusses the relative effectiveness of these methodologies in terms of a cumulative exposure impact criteria. Cumulative exposure examples are given including typical marine piling operations for wind-farm construction and sub-surface piling operations for various receptor models, including, static, fleeing and transiting animals...|$|E
40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. The {{definitive}} version is available at: [URL] exposure level (SEL) {{has been suggested}} as an important parameter when considering the impact of anthropogenic noise on marine mammals (Southall et al, 2007). This metric allows the cumulative exposure of an animal to a sound field for an extended <b>period</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>assessed</b> against a predefined threshold for injury criteria. In many cases, this can become the dominant mechanism by which a marine mammal may suffer injury. In this paper, the SEL metric {{has been used to}} estimate the cumulative exposure of animals using two examples of sound sources: (i) an offshore Floating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSO) platform used in the oil and gas industry; and (ii) marine piling for offshore windfarm construction. The method has been used in a predictive manner using models for noise sources, and also using measured data of the noise radiated by the source. The method can be used to investigate the effect on the cumulative exposure of factors such as source level and transmission loss model. In addition, assumptions made about the behaviour of the animals have been assessed. Examples are provided of exposure estimates made for a static animal, a fleeing animal, or an animal in transit through the source region...|$|E

At the same time, the medicines monitoring unit collected data on whether and when prescriptions for ACE inhibitors were redeemed at community pharmacies, which enabled each patient's adherence over a prolonged <b>period</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>assessed.</b>  MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES—Routine collected serum ACE measurements were correlated with measured adherence with ACE inhibitor treatment.  RESULTS—In total, 18 % of CHF patients appeared to exhibit   12  u/l gave 91 % positive predictive accuracy that the patient was   85 % adherent with ACE inhibitor treatment.  CONCLUSIONS—Non-adherence with ACE inhibitor treatment {{was found to be}} common in patients with CHF. The simple, inexpensive test of serum ACE activity can be used in CHF patients to identify many, although not all, non-adherent patients so that adherence enhancing strategies can be targeted towards them. Further work is clearly required to explore the precise clinical use of this promising test.    Keywords: {{angiotensin converting enzyme}} inhibitors; heart failure; complianc...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{changes in}} the {{organisation}} of primary health care have increased the range of professionals that patients may encounter, leading to renewed interest {{in the importance of}} continuity of care. To assess whether organisational changes have had an impact on continuity, it is necessary to define and measure the term. Researchers seeking to assess continuity face many conceptual and practical difficulties. This article argues {{that it is important to}} distinguish between three distinct but related concepts: longitudinal continuity from a minimum number of health professionals, caring relationships between patients and professionals, and well-coordinated care between professionals. An evaluation of Advanced Access as a case study is used to illustrate how researchers need to make several value judgements in operationalising longitudinal continuity. These include whether continuity should be measured from the perspective of patient, doctor, or healthcare system, the types of professionals and consultations that should be considered, the time <b>period</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>assessed,</b> the measure to be used, and also practical considerations about data collection. It is argued that decisions about these issues should be based on an underlying hypothesis about why continuity may be important in the particular context. Distinguishing between longitudinal continuity, patient–professional relationships, and coordinated care makes it possible to examine interactions between these different concepts, and to examine relationships with outcomes such as patient satisfaction and quality of care. It will also give greater clarity to debates about whether new models of primary care reduce continuity...|$|E
40|$|Colombian biomes are reconstructed at 45 {{sites from}} the modern <b>period</b> {{extending}} <b>to</b> the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). The basis for our reconstruction is pollen data assigned to plant functional types and biomes at six 3000 -yr intervals. A reconstruction of modern biomes <b>is</b> used <b>to</b> check {{the treatment of}} the modern pollen data set against a map of potential vegetation. This allows the biomes reconstructed at past <b>periods</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>assessed</b> relative <b>to</b> the modern situation. This process also provides a check on the a priori assignment of pollen taxa to plant functional types and biomes. For the majority of the sites, the pollen data accurately reflect the potential vegetation, even though much of the original vegetation has been transformed by agricultural practices. At 18 000 14 C yr BP, a generally cool and dry environment is reflected in biome, assignments of cold mixed forests, cool evergreen forests and cool grassland-shrub; the latter extending to lower altitudes than presently recorded. This signal is strongly recorded at 15 000 and 12 000 14 C yr BP, the vegetation at these times also reflecting a relatively cool and dry environment. At 9000 14 C yr BP there <b>is</b> a shift <b>to</b> biomes thought to result from slightly cooler environmental conditions. This trend is reversed by 6000 14 C yr BP; most sites, within a range of different environmental settings, recording a shift to more xeric biome types. There is an expansion of steppe and cool mixed-forest biomes, replacing tropical dry forest and cool grassland-shrub biomes, respectively. These changes in biome assignments from the modern situation can be interpreted as a biotic response to mid-Holocene climatic aridity. At 3000 14 C yr BP the shift <b>is</b> mainly <b>to</b> biomes characteristic of slightly more mesic environmental conditions. There are a number of sites that do not change biome assignment relative to the modern reconstruction, although the affinities that these sites have to a specific biome do change. These anomalies are interpreted on a site-by-site basis. Spatially constant, but differential response of the vegetation <b>to</b> climatic shifts <b>are</b> related <b>to</b> changes in moisture sources and the importance of edaphic controls on the vegetation.

Mean age of the 16 children who completed the study was 10. 6 ± 0. 8 years. During the 12 -week intervention period, the multiplayer group played approximately twice as many minutes (901 min) as the home group (376 min, p = 0. 13). Dropout was significantly (p = 0. 02) lower in the multiplayer group (15 %) than in the home group (64 %).

40|$|There {{is ongoing}} debate {{regarding}} {{the shape of}} life-course trajectories in mental health. Many argue the relationship is U-shaped, with mental health declining with age to mid-life, then improving. However, I argue that these models are beset by the age–period–cohort (APC) identification problem, whereby age, cohort and year of measurement are exactly collinear and their effects cannot be meaningfully separated. This means an apparent life-course effect {{could be explained by}} cohorts. This paper critiques two sets of literature: the substantive literature regarding life-course trajectories in mental health, and the methodological literature that claims erroneously to have ‘solved’ the APC identification problem statistically (e. g. using Yang and Land's Hierarchical APC–HAPC-model). I then use a variant of the HAPC model, making strong but justified assumptions that allow the modelling of life-course trajectories in mental health (measured by the General Health Questionnaire) net of any cohort effects, using data from the British Household Panel Survey, 1991 – 2008. The model additionally employs a complex multilevel structure that allows the relative importance of spatial (households, local authority districts) and temporal (<b>periods,</b> cohorts) levels <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>assessed.</b> Mental health <b>is</b> found <b>to</b> increase throughout the life-course; this slows at mid-life before worsening again into old age, but {{there is no evidence of}} a U-shape – I argue that such findings result from confounding with cohort processes (whereby more recent cohorts have generally worse mental health). Other covariates were also evaluated; income, smoking, education, social class, urbanity, ethnicity, gender and marriage <b>were</b> all related <b>to</b> mental health, with the latter two in particular affecting life-course and cohort trajectories. The paper shows the importance of understanding APC in life-course research generally, and mental health research in particular...|$|R

We {{sought to}} {{evaluate}} the effects of intermittent transdermal nitroglycerin (TD-NTG) on the occurrence of ischemia during patch-off hours in patients with stable angina pectoris receiving a beta-adrenergic blocking agent or calcium antagonist, or both. Background. The current recommendations {{for the use of}} intermittent TD-NTG may be associated with the occurrence of rebound ischemia. Methods. This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial with three study <b>periods.</b> Tolerability <b>to</b> TD-NTG <b>was</b> <b>assessed</b> in <b>Period</b> I. Seventy-two patients <b>were</b> assigned <b>to</b> receive either double-blind transdermal placebo or maximally tolerated TD-NTG for 2 weeks (Period II) and were then crossed over to the alternative treatment for another 2 weeks (Period III). The patients <b>were</b> instructed <b>to</b> apply medication daily at 8 <b>am,</b> <b>to</b> remove it at 10 pmand to note symptoms and sublingual nitroglycerin (SL-NTG) use in a diary. The occurrence of ischemia <b>was</b> <b>assessed</b> from patient-perceived angina, symptom-limited exercise treadmill test (ETT) and 48 -h ambulatory electrocardiographic (AECG) monitoring. Results. Transdermal NTG (0. 2 to 0. 4 mg/h) significantly reduced the magnitude of ST segment depression at angina onset during ETT compared with placebo. Total angina frequency was not significantly different between TD-NTG (mean [±SD] 3. 2 ± 4. 2) and placebo (3. 3 ± 5. 2). During patch-off hours, angina frequency increased with TD-NTG (1. 1 ± 2. 1) compared with placebo (0. 7 ± 1. 6) (p = 0. 03). Similar trends for an increase in ischemia after TD-NTG were also observed from AECG analyses. Specifically, ischemia frequency tended <b>to</b> <b>be</b> lower during patch-off hours for placebo than with TD-NTG (0. 05 ± 0. 09 vs. 0. 08 ± 0. 20 episodes/h, respectively, p = 0. 08), even though frequency of ischemia tended <b>to</b> <b>be</b> higher during patch-on hours for placebo than with TD-NTG (0. 12 ± 0. 19 vs. 0. 07 ± 0. 15 episodes/h, respectively, p = 0. 11). During placebo, ischemia frequency decreased 58 % (patch-on to patch-off, p = 0. 01) compared with a 14 % increase with TD-NTG. These changes attenuate the usual circadian variation in ischemia. Conclusions. An increase in ischemia frequency during patch-off hours after use of intermittent TD-NTG was perceived by patients, and this subjective finding was supported by a corresponding trend for AECG ischemia to increase during these same hours...|$|R
40|$|Milan and University of California at San Francisco (UCSF) {{criteria}} <b>are</b> used <b>to</b> select {{patients with}} hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) for liver transplantation (LT). Recurrent HCC {{is a significant}} cause of death. There is no widely accepted pathological assessment strategy to predict recurrent HCC after transplantation. This study compares the pathology of patients meeting Milan and UCSF criteria and develops a pathological score and nomogram to assess the risk of recurrent HCC after transplantation. All explanted livers with HCC from our center over the 18 -yr <b>period</b> 1985 <b>to</b> 2003 <b>were</b> <b>assessed</b> for multiple pathological features and relevant clinical data were recorded; multivariate analysis <b>was</b> performed <b>to</b> determine features associated with recurrent HCC. Using pathological variables that independently predicted recurrent HCC, a pathological score and nomogram <b>were</b> developed <b>to</b> determine the probability of recurrent HCC. Of 75 cases analyzed, 50 (67 %) met Milan criteria, 9 (12 %) met only UCSF criteria and 16 (21 %) met neither criteria based on explant pathology. There were 20 cases of recurrent HCC and the mean follow-up was 8 yr. Recurrent HCC was more common (67 vs. 12 %; P 0. 001) and survival was lower (15 vs. 83 % at 5 yr; 15 vs. 55 % at 8 yr; P 0. 001) with those who met only UCSF criteria, {{compared to those who}} met Milan criteria. Cryptogenic cirrhosis (25 vs. 5 %; P 0. 015), preoperative AFP 1, 000 ng/mL (20 vs. 0 %; P 0. 001) and postoperative OKT 3 use (40 vs. 15 %; P 0. 017) were more common among patients with recurrent HCC. While microvascular invasion was the strongest pathological predictor of recurrent HCC, tumor size 3 cm (P 0. 004; odds ratio [OR] 7. 42), nuclear grade (P 0. 044; OR 3. 25), microsatellitosis (P 0. 020; OR 4. 82), and giant/bizarre cells (P 0. 028; OR 4. 78) also predicted recurrent HCC independently from vascular invasion. The score and nomogram stratified the risk of recurrent HCC into 3 tiers: low (5 %), intermediate (40 - 65 %), and high (95 %). In conclusion, compared to patients meeting Milan criteria, patients who meet only UCSF criteria have a worse survival and an increased rate of recurrent HCC with long-term follow-up, as well as more frequent occurrence of adverse histopathological features, such as microvascular invasion. Application of a pathological score and nomogram could help identify patients at increased risk for tumor recurrence, who may benefit from increased surveillance or adjuvant therapy.
