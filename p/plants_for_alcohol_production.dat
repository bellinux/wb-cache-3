30|$|The {{fermentation}} of bioethanol from pretreated {{water hyacinth}} biomass with mono and co-cultures of fungal strains along with P. stipitis {{is found to}} be an effective biofuel production process. The yield of ethanol recovered from WHB through enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation from simultaneous inoculation of co-cultures of fungal isolates with P. stipitis was significantly higher than that recovered through monocultures. The optimum parameters for bioethanol fermentation are as follows: time 60  h, temperature 35 °C, and WHB loading 100  g L− 1. The maximum yield of ethanol in the fermentation process was found to be 0.411  g g− 1 of WHB which is equivalent to a specific yield of 0.456  g g− 1 total sugar consumed. The use of crude fungal enzymes produced on-site would be a cost-effective approach towards enzymatic hydrolysis of alkali-pretreated WHB biomass instead of using commercial cellulases. The aquatic menace water hyacinth, which is currently being used in waste water treatment for its unique ability to absorb heavy metal pollutants, could also be utilized as abundant cheap feedstock for the production of fuel ethanol. This study proved that water hyacinth has a potential renewable and low-cost biomass <b>for</b> <b>alcohol</b> <b>production</b> on the commercial scale.

40|$|Studies of {{food and}} drink in {{archaeology}} are persistently focused on consumption and ingredient components (Parker Pearson 2003, 3 - 4). Notably, alcohol studies have often favoured identifying ingredients as representative of a large and complex sociocultural system in producing such a visceral product (McGovern 2009, 42 - 46). This interpretation simplifies the technical complexities behind <b>alcohol</b> <b>production,</b> and marginalises the sociality of technology throughout. Where {{it has been argued}} this cannot be understood due to the perishable nature of alcoholic products in the archaeological record (Hayashida 2008), instead distinct ‘signatures’ on material surfaces may be observed that can infer methods, techniques, and practices involved in the dynamic process of <b>alcohol</b> <b>production.</b> The role that use-wear analysis can have in establishing the technical gestures within the <b>alcohol</b> <b>production</b> chaîne opératoire presents a promising solution to cope with such an issue when used in conjunction with other bodies of evidence. The physical impacts of fermentation upon material surfaces have been suggested as one possible signature that could be observed through use-wear analysis (Skibo 2015, 194). Due to the prominence of ceramics in the archaeological record, this has been largely taken as true in most scales and contexts based on ethnographic data (cf. Arthur 2002; 2003). In this thesis, an application of ceramic use-wear analysis for understanding technical gesture within <b>alcohol</b> <b>production</b> is explored.

Bacteria and fungi secrete amylases to the outside of their cells to carry out extra-cellular digestion. When they have broken down the insoluble starch, the soluble end products such as (glucose or maltose) are absorbed into their cells. Amylases are classified based on how they break down starch molecules i. α-amylase (alpha-amylase) - Reduces the viscosity of starch by breaking down the bonds at random, therefore producing varied sized chains of glucose ii. ß-amylase (Beta-amylase) - Breaks the glucose-glucose bonds down by removing two glucose units at a time, thereby producing maltose iii. Amyloglucosidase (AMG) - Breaks successive bonds from the non-reducing end of the straight chain, producing glucose Many microbial amylases usually contain a mixture of these amylases.
