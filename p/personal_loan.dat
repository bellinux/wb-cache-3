The following month, Walsh learned that Fall had spent lavishly on expanding and improving his New Mexico ranch. Fall reappeared {{and stated that}} the money had come as a loan from Harding's friend and The Washington Post publisher Edward B. McLean, but McLean denied it when he testified. Doheny told the committee that he had given Fall the money in cash as a <b>personal</b> <b>loan</b> out of regard for their past association, but Fall invoked the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination when he was compelled to appear again, rather than answer questions.|$|E
5|$|Jennings's {{personal}} finances {{suffered from}} the panic of 1819, while the Indiana governorship continued to increase his financial burden. Jennings {{was never able to}} recover from his debts. One historian suggests that Jennings's financial situation may arisen from the expenses incurred during his political campaigns, his long-time service in state government, and being too busy to adequately manage his farm. Jennings and his wife frequently entertained visitors, legislators, and other dignitaries at their Corydon home. At a high-profile dinner in 1819, he hosted President James Monroe and General Andrew Jackson at a dinner held in their honor in Jeffersonville, when the two leaders were making a tour of the frontier states. In 1822 Jennings solicited a $1,000 <b>personal</b> <b>loan</b> from the Harmonists {{in a letter to his}} political ally, George Rapp, but his request was denied. Jennings was able to secure personal loans from friends by granting mortgages on his land. Earlier in his career as a land speculator at Vincennes, when land prices decreased significantly, he was forced to sell several tracts of land at a loss.|$|E

Individuals’ capital needs are often represented as housing mortgages, automobile loans, durables goods loans, medical service loans, home remodeling loans, education loans, etc. (Wang 2009).

25|$|Even {{after the}} {{approval}} of the property tax, the college's funds remained inadequate to allow it to operate and expand. As president, Patterson gained a reputation as unduly frugal, particularly with regard to faculty salaries and facilities expansion. He personally lobbied the federal congress to pass the Hatch Act of 1887, which allowed land-grant colleges to receive federal land grants to construct agricultural experiment stations, and the Morrill Act of 1890, which provided for further endowment of land-grant colleges by the federal government. In 1900, he secured funding from the General Assembly {{for the construction of a}} gymnasium and a hall for female students, and in 1904, the General Assembly increased its annual contribution to the college's endowment by $15,000. When all other fundraising methods had been exhausted, Patterson resorted to securing a <b>personal</b> <b>loan</b> to cover the college's operating expenses.|$|E
25|$|The {{conflict}} {{had been}} unforeseen, {{and no money}} could be appropriated for the expense. With the state's credit in ruins, the prospect of borrowing money for such purposes from out-of-state lenders was unlikely. With the legislature out of session and the state's coffers empty, Whitcomb had no funds for the enterprise. On May 26, Whitcomb took a <b>personal</b> <b>loan,</b> on his own credit, for $10,000 from the Bank of Indiana's Madison branch, which he used to purchase arms for the state's regiments. The same day he sent letters to other branches of the bank requesting equivalent loans from them, which allowed the state to muster the five regiments that had been requested by the Federal Government. Once the General Assembly convened, they repaid what he had paid from his own pocket and assumed his outstanding debts to the bank. For {{his role as a}} war-time governor, a bronze statue of Whitcomb was placed in Monument Circle in Indianapolis.|$|E

500|$|At {{the same}} time, Grant's son Ulysses Jr. had opened a Wall Street {{brokerage}} house with Ferdinand Ward. Ward {{was regarded as}} a rising star and the firm, Grant & Ward, was initially successful. In 1883, Grant joined the firm and invested $100,000 of his own money. To encourage investment, Ward paid investors abnormally high interest, by pledging the company's securities on multiple loans in a process called rehypothecation. Ward, in collusion with banker James D. Fish, kept secret from bank examiners, retrieved the firm's securities from the company's bank vault. When the trades went bad, multiple loans came due, all backed up by the same collateral. Historians agree that Grant was likely unaware of Ward's intentions, but it is unclear how much Buck Grant knew. In May 1884, enough investments went bad to convince Ward that the firm would soon be bankrupt. Ward told Grant of the impending failure, but assured Grant that this was a temporary shortfall. Grant approached businessman William Henry Vanderbilt, who gave him a <b>personal</b> <b>loan</b> of $150,000. Grant invested the money in the firm, but it was not enough to save it from failure. Essentially penniless, but compelled by a sense of personal honor, he repaid what he could with his Civil War mementos and the sale or transfer of all other assets. Vanderbilt took title to Grant's home, although he allowed the Grants to continue to reside there, and pledged to donate the souvenirs to the federal government and insisted the debt had been paid in full. Grant was distraught over Ward's deception and asked privately how he could ever [...] "trust any human being again." [...] In March 1885, as his health was failing, he testified against both Ward and Fish. Ward was convicted of fraud in October 1885, months after Grant's death, and served {{six and a half years}} in prison.|$|E

2500|$|Another scandal hit the DVLMF in 2007 when Lois Pope was sued by her son, Paul D. Pope. Tensions {{between mother}} and son had simmered for years, driven largely by {{financial}} issues. Paul Pope contended that his mother promised him a $1 million a year income {{as well as a}} home and luxury automobile, and then reneged on the promises. He claimed that his mother's support of the DVLMF was to blame for the broken agreement, and asserted that the memorial foundation had squandered $14 million on high staff salaries, parties, and expensive trinkets. He also alleged that the DVLMF had commissioned two reports from consultants, and that these reports accused the foundation of [...] "poor financial performance and a lack of accountability". Montgomery labelled his claims [...] "baseless".
