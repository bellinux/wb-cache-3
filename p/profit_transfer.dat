40|$|After {{the final}} {{agreement}} of the Maastricht treaty in 1992 a new chapter "Industrial policy" under article 130 has been adopted. With this new article the European Union and the Commission are allowed to pursue an active industrial policy with the government intervention. To explain how the present EU-industrial policy really works, the theoretical approach of strategic trade policy {{seems to be the}} right one. The theory of strategic trade policy, which was developed in the middle of 80 es from James Brander and Barbara Spencer, provides a starting point for the country's active engagement with subsidy as a tool. The aims of this policy are: first is to bring the domestic producer in an advantage position in the market and second to retain <b>profit</b> <b>transfer</b> within international market through government's intervention, but with the cost of other competitor. The application of strategic trade policy by the EU could be seen clearly in the sector of civil aircraft industry. Since the {{agreement of the}} Maastricht treaty, the Airbus-industry as high-tech sector became a center of gravity of the strategic trade policy of EU, mainly the European Airbus. Due to the Airbus condition as a new comer in the market and the financial need for research and development (R&D), the EU-governments provide subsidy for Airbus. However, the subsidy which was provided by European countries causes an interest conflict between the EU and the US. And if both the EU and the US protect their national champion and also apply their own strategic trade policy, the trade conflict will not end, therefore they are both involved in so called "prisoners dilemma". Because there are oligopoly profits in the long run, the EU-countries have a desire to strengthen their market position within their domestic industry in the international market. And because of the possibility of <b>profit</b> <b>transfer</b> and as a long as there is no free trade, then it is suitable for the EU to apply the strategic trade policy...|$|E

40|$|I {{received}} {{very positive}} {{comments and suggestions}} on how this work could be expanded, including empirical validations in Africa. The long-term effects of promotions on sales are increasingly linked to the supposed shift of economic power within channels from manufacturers to retailers. However, formal knowledge about how they influence channel decisions under different promotional arrangements {{and the distribution of}} channel profits remains very sparse. In this paper, I develop two 2 -period models to investigate the impact on channel decisions and profits of manufacturer-controlled and retailer-controlled promotions targeted at consumers. My findings indicate that retailers always invest in retailer promotions, while manufacturers may find it optimal to not invest in consumer promotions. Additionally, the distribution of channel profits is based on who undertakes promotions and the long-term effects of these promotions. Trade promotions or other forms of <b>profit</b> <b>transfer</b> mechanisms may be indispensable in easing conflicts over who should undertake promotions, especially when these promotions substantially increase future sales.

30|$|Further, I match {{individual}} auditors’ {{signatures of}} the consolidated IFRS financial statements with individual German GAAP {{balance sheet data}} of the parent company to estimate the more immediate tax relevant association between tax certified individual auditors and effective tax rates in Germany. Foreign subsidiaries’ efforts to reduce tax rates might {{be out of the}} reach of German individual auditors and distort the previously shown associations to some extent. Groups will, as already stated earlier, optimize their IFRS tax accounts to be competitive and provide information to investors. One way to do so is to optimize only tax statements. Since IFRS and tax law are not aligned in Germany, IFRS accounting earnings will not be affected by efforts to reduce tax payments but might be biased by earnings management. By contrast, German GAAP and tax law face a high book-tax conformity. Effective tax rates consistent with German GAAP will, therefore, provide measures that are closer related to tax avoidance implemented in tax statements. This holds especially as it can be assumed that German listed companies will use their individual German GAAP statements primarily for tax reasons because capital market relevant information is already provided by IFRS consolidated statements (Zinn and Spengel 2012). Earnings management can therefore be assumed to be rarely present. Moreover, most national companies within a group consolidate their accounts for tax reasons with <b>profit</b> <b>transfer</b> agreements (‘steuerliche Organschaft’) so that the profits of all German subsidiaries are still pooled in the individual German GAAP statement of the parent. These tax rates will consequently be a reflection of the group’s level of reported corporate effective tax rates in Germany.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{looks at}} some evolution {{aspects of the}} insurance amrket, namely foreign direct investment, mergers and existence and exercise of market power. The first essay investigates the effect of entry by more efficient firms into markets characterized by adverse selection. Or, {{in the context of}} the insurance market, the effect of entry of foreign firms more efficient than national ones, but which have less Knowledge about insures. Two main effects of entry of less informed but more efficinet firms are identified: demand diversion and demand creation. That is, There are buyers that will choose current sellers instead of new firms. Another possibility is the participation in the market of new buyers (consumers). Enry of new consumers, the demand by the presence of more efficient firms, even if less informed. For those consumers, the distortion cost in the relation with an uniformed seller, resulting from the asymmetry of information, is small. The second essay evaluates the existence and the exercice of market power in the Portuguese auto-insurance market. Two models of oligopolistic interaction are developed, accounting for both price-regulated and deregulated environments. Application of both models to the Portuguese insureance market (1982 - 88) for the price-regulated model; 1989 - 90 for the deregulated Model) are reported. Panel data on twenty-seven and thirty-four firms for the first and second period, respectively, were used. It was shown that a high degree of coordination prevailled before price liberalization. On the other hand, in the more recent past, characterized by freedom in rate behavior and by a strong entry trend in the market, a rather competitive conduct was found. Therefore, results suggest that a significant change in firms'behavior has occured after price liberalization. The third essay analyzes welfare effects of foreign entry in markets with imperfect competition and of merger policy in open economies. Entry of foreign firms into a domestic market with imperfect competition has two opposite effects: an increase in consumers' surplus and a <b>profit</b> <b>transfer</b> from existing firms to entrants. The relative strenght of these two effects determines if entry of foreign firm is beneficial from the point of view of the domestic welfare measure, which is simply the sum of consumers'surplus and domestic-firms'profits. Both entry and entry by acquisition are considered in their global and marginal effects on welfare. The second part of the essay looks at merger policy in open economies. We focus on the presentation of simple evaluation rules, based on market shares only, of the welfare effects of mergers in imperfectly competitive markets in open economies. The important issue of merger policy decentralization is also investigated with reference to a model of a common market (EC is the example that drives the analysis) Available from Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, Servico de Informacao e Documentacao, Av.
