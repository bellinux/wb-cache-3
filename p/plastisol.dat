40|$|Abstract. The {{rheological}} properties of <b>plastisols</b> based on low-toxicity plasticizers {{have been evaluated}} using a DV- 79 + pro coaxial cylinder viscometer by steady shearing. The effect of plasticizer and temperature on the shearing rate dependence of apparent viscosity, non-Newtonian index (n), as well as apparent activation energy (Ea) was investigated. The results indicate that all the <b>plastisols</b> prepared in this experiment show shear thinning pseudoplastic behavior before and after aging process. The <b>plastisols</b> prepared by DOTP shows an obvious shear thinning behavior than that of <b>plastisols</b> prepared by ATBC and DINCH. The dependence of viscosity properties on temperature of <b>plastisols</b> accord with Arrhenius formula except DOTP-based system, and the apparent activation energy of <b>plastisols</b> prepared by DINCH is bigger than that of <b>plastisols</b> prepared by ATBC...|$|R
40|$|International audienceOscillatory {{rheological}} experiments {{at different}} temperatures {{and over a}} wide range of frequencies have been used to investigate the gelation process and, more particularly, the sol-gel transition of various poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) <b>plastisols.</b> The sol-gel transition process was found to be universal with respect to the temperature and solid volume fraction according to the similarity of the fractal structure in PVC <b>plastisols.</b> The variation of the gel time (t gel) with temperature for any composition of PVC <b>plastisols</b> was predicted from the Dickinson's model (E. Dickinson, J Chem Soc Faraday Trans, 93 : 111 - 114, 1997). Dynamic viscoelastic properties of PVC <b>plastisols</b> have also been studied as a function of temperature that allowed us to follow the gelation process of various <b>plastisols.</b> Thus, the influence of the type and concentration of PVC resins in gelation process was investigated.

40|$|Polymeric foam {{production}} {{continues to}} grow at a rapid pace owing to its interesting features, such aslight weight, excellent strength/weight ratio, superior insulating abilities, and energy absorbingperformance and comfort. In the market, flexible PVC foam is widely used as a carpet backing and itsprocess involves addition of plasticizer to control flexiblity of the foam. A common plasticizer used inthe PVC foam is phthalic esters, which become increasingly concerned due to its chronic toxicity. Contamination of plasticized PVC has made the recycling of waste plastic material more difficult. Thereby, the current study focuses on using environmetally friendly plasticizers, such as dioctyladipate (DOA), diisononyl adipate (DINA), and epoxidized soybean oil (ESO) to produce the flexiblePVC foam and compares with the common types, dioctyl phthalate (DOP) and diisononyl phthalate(DINP). The amount of plasticizers was varied (50, 60 and 70 phr). The prepared <b>plastisols</b> alsocontained a chemical blowing agent, azodicarbonamide. The effect of chemical structure and contentof plasticizers on the cellular morphology and mechanical properties of the foams was investigated. The results showed that when the content of plasticizer was increased, viscosity of the <b>plastisols</b> wasdropped, and a slight change in blowing ratio was observed. By adding the aliphatic esters (DOA andDINA), the viscosity of the <b>plastisols</b> was reduced, whereas ESO plasticizer increased the plastisolviscosity, compared with DOP and DINP containing <b>plastisols.</b> SEM micrographs suggested that thecellular structure appeared to be smaller size when the amount of plasticizers was increased. Theresultant foams elongated more with increasing plasticizer content, while {{there was a small}} decrease inthe stress at break; thus the tensile strength of the foams was slightly decreased...|$|R

40|$|International audienceReactive poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) <b>plastisols</b> {{have been}} {{developed}} to substitute the hydrocarbon diluents generally used in low viscosity PVC <b>plastisols.</b> For this purpose, methacrylate monomers (5 - 15 %) were added in the PVC suspension (based on diisononyl phtalate plasticizer) to reduce the viscosity at room temperature and to polymerize (by radical polymerization initiated by an organic peroxide) during the gelation process. Both the reactive processing and the gelation process were carried out between the plates of a rheometer cell in the linear viscoelasticity domain (small deformation) and under increasing temperature from room temperature up to 160 °C (= 6. 283 rad s- 1, = 5 °C min- 1). A temperature criterion was proposed to define the right balance between the polymerization and the gelation to get the best mechanical properties (i. e., elongation and stress at break). The polymerization process must be slower than the gelation process as the polymerization must take place when PVC grains have fused together to form a homogeneous medium at least at the microscale. Actually, the polymerization kinetics can be controlled by the decomposition kinetics of the organic peroxide. Finally, triethylene glycol dimethacrylate and lauryl methacrylate monomers and dicumyl peroxide as initiator {{turned out to be the}} best reactive system for some potential industrial application...|$|R
