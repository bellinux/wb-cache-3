60|$|A curious {{example of}} a recent change of habits has {{occurred}} in Jamaica. Previous to 1854, the <b>palm</b> <b>swift</b> (Tachornis phænicobea) inhabited exclusively the palm trees in a few districts in the island. A colony then established themselves in two cocoa-nut palms in Spanish Town, and remained there till 1857, when one tree was blown down, and the other stripped of its foliage. Instead of now seeking out other palm trees, the swifts drove out the swallows who built in the Piazza of the House of Assembly, and took possession of it, building their nests {{on the tops of}} the end walls and at the angles formed by the beams and joists, a place which they continue to occupy in considerable numbers. It is remarked that here they form their nest with much less elaboration than when built in the palms, probably from being less exposed.|$|E

50|$|These swifts {{spend most}} of their lives in the air, living on the insects they catch in their beaks. <b>Palm</b> <b>swifts</b> often feed near the ground. They drink on the wing. It is a common {{resident}} breeder in tropical Africa. The down and feather nest is glued to the underside of a palm leaf with saliva, which is also used to secure the usually two eggs.

50|$|The Antillean <b>palm</b> <b>swift's</b> diet {{consists}} {{mainly of}} insects {{that it takes}} in from the air columns or {{from the surface of}} the water. These gregarious birds form small to medium-size flocks. They breed year-round in colonies around coastal areas in the dead fronds that hang from palms. While the nesting biology of this bird is poorly known, estimated incubation period by both sexes is 18 - 21 days. The altricial young are brooded by the female and stay in the nest for an estimated 20 - 28 days, being fed by both parents. They typically have 1 to 2 broods a year.|$|R
