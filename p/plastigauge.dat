5000|$|<b>Plastigauge</b> {{consists}} of a strip of soft material with precise known dimensions and deformation characteristics. This is sandwiched between a clean bearing surface on a shaft and the bearing shell itself. The <b>plastigauge</b> flattens after the bearing cap is tightened. The dimensional clearance is then determined by comparing the amount that the gauge material has flattened using a template. Letter designation describes the range of measurement use for each gauge.PL-A (0.001" [...] - 0.007 in. (0.025mm-0.175mm)), PL-B (0.004" [...] - 0.010 in. (0.100mm-0.250mm)), PL-C (0.007" [...] - 0.020 in. (0.175mm-0.500mm)), PL-D (0.020" [...] - 0.040 in. (0.500mm-1.00mm)), PL-E (0.030" [...] - 0.070 in. (0.75mm-1.75mm)), PL-X <b>Plastigauge</b> (0.018mm - 0.045mm) ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Plastigauge</b> is a {{measuring}} tool used for measuring plain bearing clearances, {{such as in}} engines. Other uses include marine drive shaft bearings, turbine housing bearings, pump and pressure system bearings, shaft end-float, flatness and clearance in pipe-flanges and cylinder heads. Wherever it is required to determine the separation between hidden surfaces. <b>Plastigauge</b> was introduced to US retail sales in 1948.|$|E
