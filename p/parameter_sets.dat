One very fundamental design concept of H.264 is to generate self-contained packets, to remove the header duplication as in MPEG-4's Header Extension Code (HEC). This was achieved by decoupling information relevant to more than one slice from the media stream. The combination of the higher-level parameters is called a <b>parameter</b> <b>set.</b> The H.264 specification includes two types of parameter sets: Sequence <b>Parameter</b> <b>Set</b> (SPS) and Picture <b>Parameter</b> <b>Set</b> (PPS). An active sequence <b>parameter</b> <b>set</b> remains unchanged throughout a coded video sequence, and an active picture <b>parameter</b> <b>set</b> remains unchanged within a coded picture. The sequence and picture <b>parameter</b> <b>set</b> structures contain information such as picture size, optional coding modes employed, and macroblock to slice group map.|$|R

2500|$|Limits of {{the method}} {{are related to the}} <b>parameter</b> <b>sets</b> used, and to the {{underlying}} molecular mechanics force fields. One run of an MD simulation optimizes the potential energy, rather than the free energy of the protein , meaning that all entropic contributions to thermodynamic stability of protein structure are neglected, including the conformational entropy of the polypeptide chain (the main factor that destabilizes protein structure) and hydrophobic effects (the main driving forces of protein folding). Another important factor are intramolecular hydrogen bonds, which are not explicitly included in modern force fields, but described as Coulomb interactions of atomic point charges. This is a crude approximation because hydrogen bonds have a partially quantum mechanical and chemical nature. Furthermore, electrostatic interactions are usually calculated using the dielectric constant of vacuum, although the surrounding aqueous solution has a much higher dielectric constant. Using the macroscopic dielectric constant at short interatomic distances is questionable. Finally, van der Waals interactions in MD are usually described by Lennard-Jones potentials based on the Fritz London theory that is only applicable in vacuum. However, all types of van der Waals forces are ultimately of electrostatic origin and therefore depend on dielectric properties of the environment. The direct measurement of attraction forces between different materials (as Hamaker constant) shows that [...] "the interaction between hydrocarbons across water is about 10% of that across vacuum". The environment-dependence of van der Waals forces is neglected in standard simulations, but can be included by developing polarizable force fields.|$|E

3000|$|If {{parameters}} {{satisfy the}} small divisor conditions, we can retain {{them in the}} original <b>parameter</b> <b>set</b> Π. If <b>parameters</b> do not satisfy these conditions, we throw them away. Generally, if Π is not big, such as [0, 1]^κ+b, then the measure of thrown <b>parameters</b> <b>set</b> is almost zero and the left “good” <b>parameters</b> <b>set</b> Π_ϵ possesses a positive measure. But if we choose Π=[0, 1]^κ+b in this paper, then Π_ϵ is too small and has a negative measure. So we select Π=[ε^- 1 / 12, 2 ε^- 1 / 12]^κ+b. There are two purposes. One is to obtain Π _ϵ with positive measure. The other is to ensure the smallness of vector field [...] X_P _r^∗. Although the thrown <b>parameters</b> <b>set</b> is big, the Π is also big and the “good” <b>parameters</b> <b>set</b> Π _ϵ still has a positive measure.

40|$|Three main {{models of}} <b>parameter</b> <b>setting</b> have been {{proposed}}: the Variational model proposed by Yang (2002; 2004), the Structured Acquisition model endorsed by Baker (2001; 2005), and the Very Early <b>Parameter</b> <b>Setting</b> (VEPS) model advanced by Wexler (1998). The VEPS model contends that <b>parameters</b> are <b>set</b> early. The Variational model supposes that children employ statistical learning mechanisms to decide among competing parameter values, so this model anticipates delays in <b>parameter</b> <b>setting</b> when critical input is sparse, and gradual <b>setting</b> of <b>parameters.</b> On the Structured Acquisition model, delays occur because parameters form a hierarchy, with higher-level <b>parameters</b> <b>set</b> before lower-level <b>parameters.</b> Assuming that children freely choose the initial value, children sometimes will mis-set parameters. However, when that happens, the input {{is expected to}} trigger a precipitous rise in one parameter value and a corresponding decline in the other value. We will point {{to the kind of}} child language data that is needed in order to adjudicate among these competing models. 11 page(s...|$|R
5000|$|The {{sequence}} and picture parameter-set mechanism decouples {{the transmission of}} infrequently changing information from the transmission of coded representations {{of the values of}} the samples in the video pictures. Each VCL NAL unit contains an identifier that refers to the content of the relevant picture parameter set and each picture parameter set contains an identifier that refers to the content of the relevant sequence parameter set. In this manner, a small amount of data (the identifier) can be used to refer to a larger amount of information (the parameter set) without repeating that information within each VCL NAL unit.Sequence and picture <b>parameter</b> <b>sets</b> can be sent well ahead of the VCL NAL units that they apply to, and can be repeated to provide robustness against data loss. In some applications, <b>parameter</b> <b>sets</b> may be sent within the channel that carries the VCL NAL units (termed [...] "in-band" [...] transmission). In other applications, it can be advantageous to convey the <b>parameter</b> <b>sets</b> [...] "out-of-band" [...] using a more reliable transport mechanism than the video channel itself.|$|E
