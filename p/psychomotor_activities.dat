Previous studies have been cross-sectional and only some have used objective measures. The aim was to investigate state-related differences in objectively-measured <b>psychomotor</b> <b>activity</b> in bipolar disorder. During a 12 weeks study, repeated measurements of heart rate and movement monitoring over several days were collected during different affective states from 19 outpatients with bipolar disorder. Outcomes included activity energy expenditure (AEE) and trunk acceleration (ACC).

In addition to provable positive benefi ts of physical activity on health, it is generally considered diffi cult to demonstrate the infl uence of physical education on diff erent ways of life. Results of studies indicate failure of education in physical education in practical and information process. Perceived physical competence, fun, the activity and monitoring individual progress are considered as positive correlates of the infl uence of physical education on lifestyle (Dobrý, 2007). OBJECTIVE: The aims {{of this paper is to}} point out that <b>psychomotor</b> <b>activities</b> could bring positive changes in teaching physical education. METHODS: This paper examined various studies, personal experiencies from abroad and practice. RESULTS: Physical activities and games in pedagogical concept of ps. development are intentionally aimed at the physical and motoric development in connection with mental processes and social relations, promote personal knowledge and personal development, self-activity and creativity, are fun and lead to the acquisition of key competencies. Using psychomotor teaching methods could support this impact of <b>psychomotor</b> <b>activities</b> and help to make positive changes in physical education.

40|$|Abstract Background Rating scale {{items in}} a 6 -week {{clinical}} trial of olanzapine versus placebo augmentation {{in patients with}} mixed bipolar disorder partially nonresponsive to ≥ 14 days of divalproex monotherapy were analyzed to characterize symptom patterns that could predict remission. At baseline, the two treatment groups were similar. Findings Factor analysis with Varimax rotation was performed post hoc on baseline items of the 21 -Item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS- 21) and Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS). Backwards-elimination logistic regression ascertained factors predictive of protocol-defined endpoint remission (HDRS- 21 score ≤ 8 and YMRS score ≤ 12) with subsequent determination of optimally predictive factor score cutoffs. Factors for <b>Psychomotor</b> <b>activity</b> (YMRS items for elevated mood, increased motor activity, and increased speech and HDRS- 21 agitation item) and Guilt/Suicidality (HDRS- 21 items for guilt and suicidality) significantly predicted endpoint remission in the divalproex+olanzapine group. No factor predicted remission in the divalproex+placebo group. Patients in the divalproex+olanzapine group with high pre-augmentation <b>psychomotor</b> <b>activity</b> (scores ≥ 10) {{were more likely to}} remit compared to those with lower <b>psychomotor</b> <b>activity</b> (odds ratio [OR] = 3. 09, 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 1. 22 - 7. 79), and patients with marginally high Guilt/Suicidality (scores ≥ 2) were less likely to remit than those with lower scores (OR = 0. 37, 95 % CI = 0. 13 - 1. 03). Remission rates for divalproex+placebo vs. divalproex+olanzapine patients with high <b>psychomotor</b> <b>activity</b> scores were 22 % vs. 45 % (p = 0. 08) and 33 % vs. 48 % (p = 0. 29) for patients with low Guilt/Suicidality scores.

At the end of the <b>psychomotor</b> <b>activities</b> the sample group has made the TEC, a Test of Emotion Comprehension. From the research we have seen that there is a correlation between corporeity and emotions. The experimental group has reached a much bigger consciousness of the body language right from the investigated emotions.

40|$|High {{density of}} {{cannabinoid}} receptors type 1 (CB 1) {{in the brain}} suggests that endocannabinoid system {{plays an important role}} in the functioning of the central nervous system. Natural and synthetic cannabinoids are known to attenuate learning and memory processes. The adverse effects of cannabinoids are reversed by SR 141716 A, at first reported to be a selective CB 1 receptor antagonist, later shown to possess also inverse agonist properties. The present study was performed in an attempt to determine the influence of different doses of AM 251, a member of the same cannabinoid group as SR 141716 A, on recognition memory evaluated in an object recognition test. Because cannabinoids may alter motor function and affect anxiety, the influence of AM 251 on <b>psychomotor</b> <b>activity</b> and anxiety was assessed in an “open-field ” test and elevated plus maze, respectively. While the lowest dose of AM 251 (1. 0 mg/kg) significantly improved recognition memory, higher doses (2. 5 mg/kg and 5. 0 mg/kg) did not have an influence on it. Moreover, AM 251 did not affect anxiety but in the highest dose significantly attenuated <b>psychomotor</b> <b>activity</b> in rats. The main finding of the present study indicates that AM 251, at the dose of 1. 0 mg/kg, improves recognition memory in rats without alteration of their <b>psychomotor</b> <b>activity</b> and anxiety.

40|$|Lateralisation {{associates}} the extremities and {{senses of}} {{one side of}} the body, which are connected by afferent and efferent pathways, with the primary motor and sensory areas of the hemisphere on the opposite side. Dominant laterality denotes the appearance of a dominant extremity or sense in the performance of complex <b>psychomotor</b> <b>activities.</b> Laterality is manifested both as right-handedness or left-handedness, which are functionally equivalent and symmetrical in the performance of activities. Right-handedness is significantly more common than left-handedness. Genetic theory is most widely accepted in explaining the onset of lateralisation. According to this theory, the models of brain organisation asymmetry (anatomical, functional, and biochemical) are strongly, genetically determined. However, the inability to clearly demonstrate the association between genetic factors and left-handedness has led researchers to investigate the effects of the environment on left-handedness. Of particular interest are the intrauterine environment and the factors influencing foetal development, of which hormones and ultrasound exposure are the most significant. It has been estimated that an extra five cases of nonright-handed lateralisation can be expected in every 100 males who were exposed to ultrasound in utero compared to those who were not. Socio-cultural pressure on left-handed individuals was much more severe in the past, which is confirmed by scientific findings that left-handedness is present in 13 % of individuals in their twenties, while in less than 1 % of individuals in their eighties...|$|E

Dominant lateralization implies {{the appearance of a}} dominant extremity, or a dominant sense during the performance of complex <b>psychomotor</b> <b>activities.</b> Hand dominance is usually defined as a tendency to use one hand rather than another to perform most activities and this is considered to be the most obvious example of cerebral lateralization and exclusive characteristic of humans. However, there are some exceptions in other species. The dominant hand is able to perform more complex and subtle manual tasks than the non-dominant hand, and this behavioral superiority is the absolute result of additional cerebral support. The asymmetry of brain organization was confirmed in rats, chimpanzees, dogs and birds, some fishes and lizards. The relationships between hand dominance with brain structure and function remain far from clear. For a long time, lateralization was considered unique to humans, but recently it has become clear that lateralization is a fundamental characteristic of the organization of brain and behavior in all vertebrates.

It shows basic skills that a child with blindness should acquire through a structured, methodical-didactic based approach as well as through an informal learning – an acquisition of concepts about the world around him and gaining knowledge on concepts that are associated with learning to read and to write. We`ve described the importance of early experiences in promoting sensory and psychomotor development and also the relevance of these experiences in gaining the motivation for learning to read and to write. We`ve described activities that help child develop tactile-kinesthetic sensitivity and the <b>psychomotor</b> <b>activities</b> that help child develop the appropriate movements, position and pressure of finger strength and flexibility in of the wrist. Before the beginning of learning to read and to write in Braille, child should have acquired knowledge about physical characteristic and lateralization of his body and needs to understand the concepts and spatial orientation of the micro and macro space. Child needs to be well acquainted with Braille machine – he must know its components and functions, he {{has to be able to}} insert the paper into the machine independently and press the required combination of points. Once the child has acquired and developed different functions such as: tactile-kinesthetic functions, fine motor skills, hearing and speech-language functions, an understanding of the parts of the body and space, an understanding of the concepts of the book, joined with his motivation for it, than he is ready to learn to read and to write in Braille. ...|$|E
