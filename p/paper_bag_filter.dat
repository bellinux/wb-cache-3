This study used various real-time aerosol detectors to investigate the presence of nanoaerosols in a laboratory used to manufacture titanium dioxide (TiO 2).

30|$|In hybrid ESP/BAGs, {{particles}} are pretreated through electrostatic elimination to eliminate certain particles, particularly large ones. The {{rest of the}} charged particles flow along with the gas into the <b>bag</b> <b>filters</b> and are eliminated through interception, inertial collision, and diffusion. Fibers capture fine particles in the <b>bag</b> <b>filter.</b> The advantage of hybrid ESP/BAGs is that the ESP part functions by working with the <b>bag</b> <b>filter</b> part. The ESP part has low energy cost. As most {{particles are}} eliminated, the load of the <b>bag</b> <b>filter</b> part is reduced and a smaller pressure difference is expected. Thus, {{the cost of the}} hybrid ESP/BAG system is reduced and the elimination efficiency for fine particles is increased. Given that ESPs have limited elimination efficiency for small particles as well as high specific resistivity particles, hybrid ESP/BAGs can increase the elimination efficiency for fine particles.|$|R
