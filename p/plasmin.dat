5|$|Eumenorrhea denotes normal, regular {{menstruation}} {{that lasts}} {{for a few}} days (usually 3 to 5 days, but anywhere from 2 to 7 days is considered normal). The average blood loss during menstruation is 35 milliliters with 10–80 ml considered normal. Women who experience Menorrhagia are more susceptible to iron deficiency than the average person. An enzyme called <b>plasmin</b> inhibits clotting in the menstrual fluid.|$|E
5|$|D-dimers are a fibrin {{degradation}} product, and {{an elevated}} level {{can result from}} <b>plasmin</b> dissolving a clot—or other conditions. Hospitalized patients often have elevated levels for multiple reasons. When individuals are at a high-probability of having DVT, diagnostic imaging is preferred to a D-dimer test. For those with a low or moderate probability of DVT, a D-dimer level might be obtained, which excludes a diagnosis if results are normal. An elevated level requires further investigation with diagnostic imaging to confirm or exclude the diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|Thrombolysis is enzymatic {{destruction}} of blood clots. This {{is achieved by}} the administration of a drug (such as urokinase or alteplase) that activates <b>plasmin,</b> an enzyme that occurs naturally {{in the body and}} digests clots when activated. Thrombolysis is an accepted treatment for heart attacks and stroke unrelated to dissection. In cervical artery dissection, only small case series are available. The thrombolytic drug is administered either intravenously or during cerebral angiography through a catheter directly into the affected artery. The data indicates that thrombolysis is safe, but its place in the treatment of VAD is uncertain.|$|E
25|$|<b>Plasmin</b> {{has been}} shown to {{interact}} with Thrombospondin 1, Alpha 2-antiplasmin and IGFBP3. Moreover, <b>plasmin</b> induces the generation of bradykinin in mice and humans trough high molecular weight kininogen cleavage.|$|E
25|$|<b>Plasmin</b> is a serine {{protease}} that acts to dissolve fibrin blood clots. Apart from fibrinolysis, <b>plasmin</b> proteolyses proteins in various other systems: It activates collagenases, some mediators of the complement system and weakens {{the wall of}} the Graafian follicle (leading to ovulation). It cleaves fibrin, fibronectin, thrombospondin, laminin, and von Willebrand factor. <b>Plasmin,</b> like trypsin, belongs to the family of {{serine protease}}s.|$|E
25|$|<b>Plasmin</b> is inactivated by {{proteins}} such as α2-macroglobulin and α2-antiplasmin. The {{mechanism of}} <b>plasmin</b> inactivation involves the cleavage of an α2-macroglobulin at the bait region (a {{segment of the}} aM that is particularly susceptible to proteolytic cleavage) by <b>plasmin.</b> This initiates a conformational change such that the α2-macroglobulin collapses about the <b>plasmin.</b> In the resulting α2-macroglobulin-plasmin complex, the active site of <b>plasmin</b> is sterically shielded, thus substantially decreasing the plasmin's access to protein substrates. Two additional events occur {{as a consequence of}} bait region cleavage, namely (i) a h-cysteinyl-g-glutamyl thiol ester of the α2-macroglobulin becomes highly reactive and (ii) a major conformational change exposes a conserved COOH-terminal receptor binding domain. The exposure of this receptor binding domain allows the α2-macroglobulin protease complex to bind to clearance receptors and be removed from circulation.|$|E
25|$|<b>Plasmin</b> {{cleavage}} produces angiostatin.|$|E
25|$|<b>Plasmin</b> is {{generated}} by proteolytic cleavage of plasminogen, a plasma protein synthesized in the liver. This cleavage is catalyzed by tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA), which is synthesized and secreted by endothelium. <b>Plasmin</b> proteolytically cleaves fibrin into fibrin degradation products that inhibit excessive fibrin formation.|$|E
25|$|Fibrinolysis is the {{physiological}} breakdown of blood clots by enzymes such as <b>plasmin.</b>|$|E
25|$|Aprotinin is a {{competitive}} inhibitor of several serine proteases, specifically trypsin, chymotrypsin and <b>plasmin</b> at {{a concentration of}} about 125,000 IU/ml, and kallikrein at 300,000 IU/ml. Its action on kallikrein leads to the inhibition {{of the formation of}} factor XIIa. As a result, both the intrinsic pathway of coagulation and fibrinolysis are inhibited. Its action on <b>plasmin</b> independently slows fibrinolysis.|$|E
25|$|PAI-1's main {{function}} entails the inhibition of urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA), an enzyme {{responsible for the}} cleavage of plasminogen to form <b>plasmin.</b> <b>Plasmin</b> mediates the degradation of the extracellular matrix either by itself or in conjunction with matrix metalloproteinases. In this scenario, PAI-1 inhibits uPA via active site binding, preventing the formation of <b>plasmin.</b> Additional inhibition is mediated by PAI-1 binding to the uPA/uPA receptor complex, resulting in the latter's degradation. Thus, PAI {{can be said to}} inhibit the serine proteases tPA and uPA/urokinase, and hence is an inhibitor of fibrinolysis, the physiological process that degrades blood clots. In addition, PAI-1 inhibits the activity of matrix metalloproteinases, which {{play a crucial role in}} invasion of malignant cells through the basal lamina.|$|E
25|$|<b>Plasmin</b> {{deficiency}} {{may lead}} to thrombosis, as clots are not adequately degraded. Plasminogen deficiency in mice leads to defective liver repair, defective wound healing, reproductive abnormalities.|$|E
25|$|Eventually, {{blood clots}} are reorganised and resorbed {{by a process}} termed fibrinolysis. The main enzyme {{responsible}} for this process (<b>plasmin)</b> is regulated by various activators and inhibitors.|$|E
25|$|Simultaneously, excess {{circulating}} thrombin {{assists in}} {{the conversion of}} plasminogen to <b>plasmin,</b> resulting in fibrinolysis. The breakdown of clots results in an excess of FDPs, which have powerful anticoagulant properties, contributing to hemorrhage. The excess <b>plasmin</b> also activates the complement and kinin systems. Activation of these systems leads {{to many of the}} clinical symptoms that patients experiencing DIC exhibit, such as shock, hypotension, and increased vascular permeability. The acute form of DIC is considered an extreme expression of the intravascular coagulation process with a complete breakdown of the normal homeostatic boundaries. DIC is associated with a poor prognosis and a high mortality rate.|$|E
25|$|Urokinase, {{also known}} as urokinase-type {{plasminogen}} activator (uPA), is a serine protease present in humans and other animals. The human urokinase protein was discovered, but not named, by McFarlane and Pilling in 1947. Urokinase was originally isolated from human urine, {{and it is also}} present in the blood and in the extracellular matrix of many tissues. The primary physiological substrate of this enzyme is plasminogen, which is an inactive form (zymogen) of the serine protease <b>plasmin.</b> Activation of <b>plasmin</b> triggers a proteolytic cascade that, depending on the physiological environment, participates in thrombolysis or extracellular matrix degradation. This cascade had been involved in vascular diseases and cancer progression.|$|E
25|$|Under homeostatic conditions, {{the body}} is {{maintained}} in a finely tuned balance of coagulation and fibrinolysis. The activation of the coagulation cascade yields thrombin that converts fibrinogen to fibrin; the stable fibrin clot being the final product of hemostasis. The fibrinolytic system then functions to break down fibrinogen and fibrin. Activation of the fibrinolytic system generates <b>plasmin</b> (in the presence of thrombin), {{which is responsible for}} the lysis of fibrin clots. The breakdown of fibrinogen and fibrin results in polypeptides called fibrin degradation products (FDPs) or fibrin split products (FSPs). In a state of homeostasis, the presence of <b>plasmin</b> is critical, as it is the central proteolytic enzyme of coagulation and is also necessary for the breakdown of clots, or fibrinolysis.|$|E
25|$|Days to weeks {{following}} the tick bite, the spirochetes spread via the bloodstream to joints, heart, nervous system, and distant skin sites, where their presence {{gives rise to}} the variety of symptoms of the disseminated disease. The spread of B. burgdorferi is aided by the attachment of the host protease <b>plasmin</b> {{to the surface of the}} spirochete.|$|E
25|$|The {{physiological}} target proteases of antithrombin {{are those}} of the contact activation pathway (formerly known as the intrinsic pathway), namely the activated forms of Factor X (Xa), Factor IX (IXa), Factor XI (XIa), Factor XII (XIIa) and, to a greater extent, Factor II (thrombin) (IIa), and also the activated form of Factor VII (VIIa) from the tissue factor pathway (formerly known as the extrinsic pathway). The inhibitor also inactivates kallikrein and <b>plasmin</b> , also involved in blood coagulation. However it inactivates certain other serine proteases that are not involved in coagulation such as trypsin and the C1s subunit of the enzyme C1 involved in the classical complement pathway.|$|E
25|$|The cause(s) of {{dry socket}} are not {{completely}} understood. Normally, following extraction of a tooth, blood is extravasated into the socket, and a blood clot (thrombus) forms. This blood clot is replaced with granulation tissue which consists of proliferating fibroblasts and endothelial cells derived from remnants of the periodontal membrane, surrounding alveolar bone and gingival mucosa. In time this in turn is replaced by coarse, fibrillar bone and finally by mature, woven bone. The clot may fail to form because of poor blood supply (e.g., secondary to local factors such as smoking, anatomical site, bone density and conditions which cause sclerotic bone to form). The clot may be lost because of excessive mouth rinsing, or disintegrate prematurely due to fibrinolysis. Fibrinolysis is the degeneration of the clot and {{may be caused by}} the conversion of plasminogen to <b>plasmin</b> and formation of kinins. Factors which promote fibrinolysis include local trauma, estrogens, and pyrogens from bacteria.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Plasmin</b> is an {{important}} enzyme (...) present in blood that degrades many blood plasma proteins, including fibrin clots. The degradation of fibrin is termed fibrinolysis. [...] In humans, the <b>plasmin</b> protein is encoded by the PLG gene.|$|E
2500|$|The fibrin {{is slowly}} {{dissolved}} by the fibrinolytic enzyme, <b>plasmin,</b> and the platelets are cleared by phagocytosis.|$|E
2500|$|In circulation, {{plasminogen}} {{adopts a}} closed, activation resistant conformation. [...] Upon binding to clots, {{or to the}} cell surface, plasminogen adopts an open form that can be converted into active <b>plasmin</b> {{by a variety of}} enzymes, including tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA), kallikrein, and factor XII (Hageman factor). Fibrin is a cofactor for plasminogen activation by tissue plasminogen activator. Urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) is a cofactor for plasminogen activation by urokinase plasminogen activator. [...] The conversion of plasminogen to <b>plasmin</b> involves the cleavage of the peptide bond between Arg-561 and Val-562.|$|E
2500|$|The PLAU gene encodes a serine {{protease}} (...) involved in {{degradation of the}} extracellular matrix and possibly tumor cell migration and proliferation. A specific polymorphism in this gene {{may be associated with}} late-onset Alzheimer disease and also with decreased affinity for fibrin-binding. The protein encoded by this gene converts plasminogen to <b>plasmin</b> by specific cleavage of an Arg-Val bond in plasminogen. This gene's proprotein is cleaved at a Lys-Ile bond by <b>plasmin</b> to form a two-chain derivative in which a single disulfide bond connects the amino-terminal A-chain to the catalytically active, carboxy-terminal B-chain. This two-chain derivative is also called HMW-uPA (high molecular weight uPA). HMW-uPA can be further processed into LMW-uPA (low molecular weight uPA) by cleavage of chain A into a short chain A (A1) and an amino-terminal fragment. LMW-uPA is proteolytically active but does not bind to the uPA receptor.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Plasmin</b> is {{released}} as a zymogen called plasminogen (PLG) from the liver into the systemic circulation. [...] Two major glycoforms of plasminogen {{are present in}} humans - type I plasminogen contains two glycosylation moieties (N-linked to N289 and O-linked to T346), whereas type II plasminogen contains only a single O-linked sugar (O-linked to T346). [...] Type II plasminogen is preferentially recruited to the cell surface over the type I glycoform. [...] Conversely, type I plasminogen appears more readily recruited to blood clots.|$|E
2500|$|High Lp(a) predicts risk {{of early}} {{atherosclerosis}} INDEPENDENTLY of other cardiac risk factors, including LDL. In patients with advanced cardiovascular disease, Lp(a) indicates a coagulant risk of plaque thrombosis. Apo(a) contains domains {{that are very}} similar to plasminogen (PLG). [...] Lp(a) accumulates in the vessel wall and inhibits binding of PLG to the cell surface, reducing <b>plasmin</b> generation, which increases clotting. This inhibition of PLG by Lp(a) also promotes proliferation of smooth muscle cells. These unique features of Lp(a) suggest Lp(a) causes generation of clots and atherosclerosis.|$|E
2500|$|Proteases {{are used}} {{throughout}} an organism for various metabolic processes. Acid proteases secreted into the stomach (such as pepsin) and serine proteases present in duodenum (trypsin and chymotrypsin) {{enable us to}} digest the protein in food. Proteases present in blood serum (thrombin, <b>plasmin,</b> Hageman factor, etc.) play important role in blood-clotting, as well as lysis of the clots, and the correct action of the immune system. Other proteases are present in leukocytes (elastase, cathepsin G) and play several different roles in metabolic control. Some snake venoms are also proteases, such as pit viper haemotoxin and interfere with the victim's blood clotting cascade. Proteases determine the lifetime of other proteins playing important physiological role like hormones, antibodies, or other enzymes. This {{is one of the}} fastest [...] "switching on" [...] and [...] "switching off" [...] regulatory mechanisms in the physiology of an organism.|$|E
5000|$|... tPA and <b>plasmin</b> {{are the key}} enzymes of the fibrinolytic pathway {{in which}} tPA {{mediated}} <b>plasmin</b> generation occurs. To be specific, tPA cleaves the zymogen plasminogen at its Arg561 - Val562 peptide bond, into the serine protease <b>plasmin.</b>|$|E
50|$|Alpha 2-antiplasmin (or α2-antiplasmin or <b>plasmin</b> inhibitor) is a serine {{protease}} inhibitor (serpin) responsible for inactivating <b>plasmin.</b> <b>Plasmin</b> {{is an important}} enzyme that participates in fibrinolysis and degradation of various other proteins. This protein is encoded by the SERPINF2 gene.|$|E
50|$|Lytic {{factors in}} the uterine cavity, as well as factors from the {{blastocyst}} itself are essential for this process. Mechanisms in the latter are indicated by that the zona pellucida remains intact if an unfertilized egg {{is placed in the}} uterus under the same conditions. A substance probably involved is <b>plasmin.</b> Plasminogen, the <b>plasmin</b> precursor, is found in the uterine cavity, and blastocyst factors contribute to its conversion to active <b>plasmin.</b> This hypothesis is supported by lytic effects in vitro by <b>plasmin.</b> Furthermore, <b>plasmin</b> inhibitors also inhibit the entire zona hatching in rat experiments.|$|E
50|$|Alpha 2-antiplasmin and alpha 2-macroglobulin {{inactivate}} <b>plasmin.</b> <b>Plasmin</b> {{activity is}} also reduced by thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI), which modifies fibrin {{to make it}} more resistant to the tPA-mediated plasminogen.|$|E
