25|$|The {{appearance}} of slight deviations {{within the same}} colour is called abrash (from Turkish abraş, literally, “speckled, piebald”). Abrash is seen in traditionally dyed oriental rugs. Its occurrence suggests that a single weaver has likely woven the carpet, {{who did not have}} enough time or resources to prepare a sufficient quantity of dyed yarn to complete the rug. Only small batches of wool were dyed from time to time. When one string of wool was used up, the weaver continued with the newly dyed batch. Because the exact hue of colour is rarely met again when a new batch is dyed, the colour of the <b>pile</b> <b>changes</b> when a new row of knots is woven in. As such, the colour variation suggests a village or tribal woven rug, and is appreciated as a sign of quality and authenticity. Abrash can also be introduced on purpose into a newly planned carpet design.|$|R

40|$|Pile {{retaining}} walls {{are widely used}} {{in the practice of}} anti-landslide construction. Underground sections of piles tend to bend under the pressure. Besides the landslide pressure, the pile is rebuffed by the soil below the retaining wall. When a slope section begins creeping due to the influence of gravitational forces and the pressure of bending piles, soil resistance alongside the <b>pile</b> length <b>changes</b> over the time. This phenomenon also contributes to bending. The question of how the bearing capacity of an anti-landslide <b>pile</b> <b>changes</b> under the influence of a steady viscous flow of the slope has not undergone any comprehensive research. In this study, the authors offer a number of analytical expressions that define the interaction between the piles with the sliding slope. Authors examine how piles work to stabilize the viscous soil environment over the time. The basis of the rheological calculation of the landslide mass is the integral correlation, which in particular cases leads to well-known solutions concerning the characteristics of the deformation and speed of the viscous flow in terms of the pressure-driven gravitational movement. When problems of interaction of flexible piles with the creeping slope are solved, approximation of the linear or non-linear theory of elasticity for the quasi-instantaneous state is regularly used. In this case, the time factor is identified by multiplying the degree of deformation by the time function (). In the event of a steady viscous flow moving away from the wall, the authors analyze resistance to bending over the time {{with the help of a}} triangular outline diagram (, 0). The authors welcome any corrections of their analytical solutions for cases of visco-plastic flows as well as the projected resistance caused by the extrusion of the landslide mass through spaces in-between piles.

40|$|Unsatisfactory {{performance}} of pile supported structures in liquefiable areas (ranging from tilting/settlement to complete collapse) is still observed after most major earthquakes. As a result, {{further research is}} required in this subject. This thesis therefore aims to study the response of pile supported structures during seismic liquefaction. The ground liquefies progressively in a top down fashion when the soil transform from solid material to liquid-like material. This {{is referred to as}} transient behaviour (from no-liquefaction to full liquefaction state) and is particularly focused in this work. In practice, piles are usually analysed as laterally loaded beams using Beam on Nonlinear Winkler Foundation model where earthquake loading is applied in a pseudo-static way. Therefore, this study reviews methods of analysis of laterally loaded pile. Six different field case records were analysed using different approaches and the results were compared. Large scale shake table experiments were also conducted consisting of four pile models (two single piles and two pile groups of 2 × 2) placed in a rigid soil container with energy absorbing boundaries. Redhill- 110 sand was used and earthquake motions were applied to liquefy the soil. It was observed that the bending moment along the <b>piles</b> <b>changed</b> with the progression of liquefaction and the maximum bending moment occurred in the transient phase. It was also observed that the time taken to reach liquefaction may affect the amplification of the bending moment. Design of piles requires soil parameters and as a result, a series of multi-stage soil element tests were carried out on four different types of sands; Redhill- 110 sand, Japanese silica sand No. 8, Assam sand, and Ganga sand where the sands were first liquefied and then tests were carried out to obtain stress-strain of liquefied sand (post-liquefaction). The results showed that the post liquefaction behaviour of sand depends on the soil relative density. Furthermore, the results from the Redhill- 110 sand were used to back analyse the shake table test results. Finally, a method has been proposed to incorporate transient behaviour of pile in liquefiable soils, based on an assessment of the estimated dynamics amplification factors in the shake table tests.

40|$|Drilled {{displacement}} (DD) piles (commonly {{known as}} „screw piles‟ in Europe) are being increasingly used as foundation elements for structures, particularly in projects requiring accelerated construction or involving {{the rehabilitation of}} foundations of existing, overstressed structures. Different types of DD piles are available in practice; each type is classified according {{to the design of}} the drilling tool and associated installation method. Installation of DD <b>piles</b> causes substantial <b>changes</b> {{in the state of the}} soil surrounding the <b>pile.</b> These <b>changes</b> result from the complex loading imposed on the soil by expansion of a cylindrical cavity to make room for the specially designed drilling tool, by torsional and vertical shearing as the drilling tool gradually moves down into the ground, and by the reversed vertical shearing caused by extraction of the drilling tool from the ground. This report consolidates the information available on DD piling technology, reviews and compares the empirical design methods typically used for these piles, and presents a numerical approach to model the shaft resistance of DD piles in sand. The installation of DD piles produces greater radial displacement of soil than that produced by nondisplacement piles (e. g., drilled shafts), particularly in the case of sandy soils which gain additional strength through densification. This radial displacement of soil around the pile shaft contributes to the high capacity obtained for DD piles. Accordingly, our focus has been on analyzing the shaft resistance of DD piles in sand and proposing a design procedure based on the results of the analyses. The analyses were done using the finite element (FE) method and an advanced constitutive model for sand. The constitutive model captures all the key features required for these analyses, and the FE analyses are 1 D analyses of shaft resistance that can handle the large deformations and displacements involved in pile installation. Design equations that can be used to calculate the lateral earth pressure coefficient acting on the pile shaft are proposed...|$|R

This paper explores the changes associated with exotic feral horse dung piles in relicts of natural grasslands in Argentine Pampas. We expected greater changes {{in the composition of}} plant communities and a greater facilitation effect on the establishment of invasive alien plants adjacent to the dung piles. Characteristics of the vegetation surrounding dung piles were recorded in 100  25 cm plots located 0 – 1. 5 m {{from the edge of the}} piles. We compared the immediate surroundings with reference plots at 5 m. The diversity of plant species increased as distance from the edge increased from 0 – 1. 5 m; however, species richness was significantly higher in the first meter next to dung piles than 5 m away. Percentage cover of bare ground decreased further from the dung piles at both scales. Percentage cover of woody plants was greater at greater distances from the manure, whereas percentage cover of exotic plants was significantly higher next to the dung <b>piles.</b> The reported <b>changes</b> could be related to concentration gradients of nutrients liberated from the manure and/or to behaviour patterns of the horses, which may avoid grazing in the immediate surroundings of dung <b>piles.</b> These <b>changes</b> result in invasion windows facilitating the establishment and subsequent dispersal of exotic plant species in grasslands.

40|$|Air {{pollution}} {{is one of}} the main environmental problems mankind faces in the 21 ^(st) century caused by to the extensive use of fossil fuels. One of the opportunities to overcome this problem is to develop new technologies and methods to profit from the energy stored in the ground. A promising high-efficiency technology for the thermal control of buildings is the shallow geothermal energy. This technology is growing rapidly because it consumes less conventional energy for operation, which in turn results in fewer CO_(2) emissions. This technology harnesses constant and moderate ground temperature for thermal control of a building using foundation piles. Outside air temperature changes with the season, while ground temperature remains moderate and constant. In summer, ground temperature is lower than air temperature, and so the ground may be used as a heat sink. The opposite is true in winter; the ground becomes a heat source. This technology is used efficiently in cold, heating dominated climates. Could this be true in hot, cooling dominated climates? To achieve the ultimate goal and answer the above question, this study considered the different elements of a full SGES, namely: soil, climate, energy pile, and ground source heat pump. First, The need for a new, easy, and quick in-situ method to thermally characterize soils lead to the development of the Thermal Cone Test. Second, the soil-climate interaction and its effect on the thermodynamic efficiency of energy piles was an important factor to consider, where the decrease in soil saturation leads to a decrease in the heat exchange rate of energy piles. Third, the thermal use of foundation <b>pile</b> <b>changes</b> the <b>pile</b> and surrounding soil temperature where both materials are temperature dependent. This change in temperature leads to a change in the mechanical behavior of energy piles.

The study presented in this dissertation found that integrating energy piles in heating and cooling systems in hot, cooling dominated climates could be economical and environmentally friendly solution, but attention should be paid to the thermodynamic efficiency of the system when unsaturated soil layer is encountered, and to the long term mechanical behavior of foundation piles in high plasticity clay where additional settlement could take place resulting from the increased creep rate caused by soil heating...|$|R

40|$|Understanding the {{mechanisms}} by which any engineering structure resists load is an essential requirement for its consistent and reliable design. The axial resistance which can be mobilised by piled foundations in liquefiable soils when subjected to strong shaking remains highly uncertain, {{and a number of}} piled foundations have failed in strong earthquakes as recently as 2011. The lack of visible foundation distress in many such cases indicates that failure can occur {{as a result of the}} loss of axial capacity during an earthquake, as opposed to the laterally-dominated failure modes which have been the focus of the research community for the last 20 to 30 years. In this thesis, a series of dynamic centrifuge experiments have been carried out to establish how the distribution of axial loads along the length of a <b>pile</b> <b>changes</b> during a strong earthquake. In each test, a 2 × 2 pile group was installed such that its tips were embedded in a dense sand layer which was overlain by liquefiable soil. The tests examine the effects arising from the hydraulic conductivity in the bearing layer, the influence of axial pile cap support and finally whether there are any differences in the behaviour of nominally jacked or bored piles under seismic loading. The pile cap has been shown to play a substantial role in supporting axial loads during strong shaking. In cases where the pile cap was unable to support axial load, the majority of the axial loading was carried as pile end bearing, with some shaft friction being mobilised in both the liquefiable and bearing soil layers as a result of relative lateral displacements between the soil and pile. However, where the pile cap is able to support axial loads, the settlement of the pile cap into the soil led to a dramatic transfer of axial load away from the piles and onto the pile cap. These results imply that where substantial excess pore pressures may be generated at the depth of the pile tip, then the pile caps must be able to support significant axial load. The increased effective stresses below the pile cap were responsible for the mobilisation of shaft friction on the section of pile within the liquefiable layer. However, these piles were unable to mobilise shaft friction in the bearing layer due to the reduced lateral loading on the piles. The axial behaviour of the piled foundations after the end of strong shaking is affected by the recovery of pile end bearing capacity and is therefore strongly dependent on the hydraulic conductivity of the bearing layer. The axial behaviour of nominally bored and jacked pile groups in liquefiable soil deposits are very different under seismic excitation, with the installation process of the latter substantially altering the soil conditions around the tips of the pile, such that in contrast to the bored pile groups, the jacked pile groups did not accumulate settlements until significantly after the strong shaking had commenced. These results imply that the method of installation is an important factor in the seismic response of a foundation, and may be more pronounced for real earthquakes where the number of strong shaking cycles may be more limited than those simulated in the experiments.

In situ quantitative mineralogical analysis will be combined with laboratory-scale comminution and magnetic separation tests to develop a framework for a geometallurgical model aiming to improve the process leading to the production of high-purity magnetite concentrates. Results from our preliminary petrographic study reveal that magnetite is preferentially associated with ilmenite, ferrochlorite and ferropargasite in response to magmatic and metamorphic processes. As the mineral abundance, attachments and composition vary greatly in the cumulate <b>pile</b> due to <b>changes</b> in rock type and metamorphic conditions, the chemical constancy of magnetite concentrates will inevitably be affected...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to determine how soil disturbance caused by the installation of piles (of differing types and geometries) in clay affect the short and long-term capacity of piles. Several types of piles were installed in lightly overconsolidated clay at three different test sites in Amherst, Massachusetts. Before and after pile installation, an in-situ testing program consisting of field vane shear tests was carried out around piles installed at one of the three testing sites. Undrained shear strength and water content profiles allowed for an approximate determination of changes in the behavior of the clay surrounding some of the piles installed at different aging periods. The excess pore pressures within the soil surrounding the piles was monitored during and after pile installation by means of collected representative samples located at various depths immediately adjacent to the <b>pile.</b> The <b>changes</b> in pore pressure during pile installation were indicators of the soil deformations caused by the pile installation. After allowing a recovery period following installation (at all sites), piles with differing geometries were loaded to failure under axial tensile loads. Load-settlement curves were generated for different piles at different aging times after installation. The Undrained Shear Strength of the clay adjacent to the pile was also monitored at different aging times after installation by performing field vane tests. Disturbed samples were collected after each test to monitor the water content. The determined water content at different aging times was used as an indicator of the distribution of excess pore pressures and distribution of soil deformations caused by pile displacement. The Undrained Shear Strengths and water content were used as principal parameters (controlling factors) for the correlation to the short and long-term capacity of the pile...|$|R
40|$|When piles are {{installed}} by jacking or driving, they cause substantial {{changes in the}} state of soil located near the <b>pile.</b> These <b>changes</b> result from the complex loading imposed on the soil by expansion of a cylindrical cavity {{to make room for the}} pile, by multiple cycles of shearing in the vertical direction as the pile gradually moves down into the ground, and by the slow drainage associated with clayey soils. If a pile is load-tested a short time after installation, it will develop an axial resistance that reflects the existence in the soil of the excess pore pressures caused by the installation process. After the excess pore pressures dissipate, the axial pile resistance will be different from that measured in the short term. This difference is referred to as pile setup (if the resistance increases) or relaxation (if the resistance drops). This report focuses on the pile setup observed in clayey soils, in which it can be quite significant. Pile setup in clays result primarily from shaft resistance gains with time after installation because the base resistance contributes proportionally much less in soft to medium stiff clays, which are the focus of the research. Accordingly, our focus has been on analyzing setup in shaft resistance, validating the equations resulting from these analyses and then proposing design and quality assurance procedures based on the results of the analyses. The analyses were done using the finite element method and an advanced constitutive model developed specifically for this project. The constitutive model captures all the key features required for these analyses, and the finite element analyses are 1 D analyses of shaft resistance that can handle the large deformations and displacements involved in pile installation. The results of the analyses compare well with load test data from the literature. Design equations for the unit shaft resistance are proposed. Equations for unit shaft resistance in the short term (for comparison with load tests) are also proposed...|$|R

The findings in this research are: first, the media group policy to integrate Media Indonesia and Metro TV, was just for the internal needs in the beginning. Second, Media Indonesia and Metro TV’s operational model, raises “unique convergent” model which never been done by any other media in the world, which is show integration between the analog Media Indonesia and the digital Metro TV. The convergent was not only done in Metro TV shows and Media Indonesia reports, but also by conducted “exchanging” and “re-cycling” the employee inside Media Indonesia and Metro TV. They’re not just getting the economical benefits, but they also could educate their employee to know and have double skills, writing in printed media and writing TV narration. Third, in order to survive, Media Indonesia and Metro TV try to balance the media idealism as the agent of <b>change</b> <b>pile</b> with the business interest, through several internal policies and also society enlighten...|$|R

Using micropiles for slope stabilization is a proven technique but there are many uncertainties with how load is transferred from the soil to the structural elements. A large-scale model was constructed to test model slopes while measuring slope movement, pore pressures and strains in the reinforcing members. Three groups of tests were performed with different reinforcement geometries for each group with two non-reticulated and none reticulated. <b>Pile</b> spacing was <b>changed</b> within each group. Micropiles were installed in a model slope and the testing device tilting until a slope failure occurred. Using soil-structure interaction techniques, modeling parameters for p-y and t-z analyses were back-calculated and compared to literature. Measured moments and axial loads were reduced and compared. Better estimates of soil modeling parameters from this work will help in estimating these modeling parameters and increasing the reliability of micropile design...|$|R

According to the slope of {{potential}} <b>changes,</b> <b>pile</b> foundation is general unequal height. Design of such buildings in superstructure and foundation when considered separately, is to meet under normal load bearing capacity and deformation of coordination requirements. Due to the Bank's Foundation often under the influence of water level fluctuations, resulting in uneven settlement of pile foundation. Uneven settlement of foundation will inevitably lead to additional stress redistributes and superstructure of secondary internal force increases. Degree of influence on the structure of settlement of single pile has been building {{on the slope}} considering effects of uneven settlement of pile on the structure studies. This article focuses on studying two piles at the same time on the effect of settlement on the structure. For ease of study, this article to a shore in 8 layers of pile foundation in the framework, for example, using finite element analysis software ANSYS to different parts of the effect of settlement on the structure of two piles.

40|$|Applied during pile driving, the Case Method {{offers an}} {{immediate}} {{estimate of the}} soil resistance to driving (SRD) after each hammer blow. It {{has been used in}} its original form both in the onshore and offshore piling industry for more than 40 years to provide an indication of the pile static capacity. The Case Method requires measurements of force and velocity near the pile head as the hammer strikes the pile and produces an analytical estimate of the SRD, using a number of assumptions. One of them requires the pile to be of constant impedance (or cross section) along its length. However, offshore driven piles are often composed of several sections of different cross sections. The Case Method provides in that case an inaccurate estimate of the SRD. This article presents an improved version of the original Case Method which takes into account possible variations of impedance along the pile. For <b>piles</b> displaying impedance <b>changes,</b> the modified Case Method presented herein provides an estimate closer to the actual SRD than the original Case Method. This implies a more accurate estimation of the pile capacity and thus tends to eliminate the use of an additional safety factor when designing the pile...|$|R

The effect provoked by locking the beam on the pile-caps when supported by the lateral socket walls was evaluated. Three-dimensional numerical analyses using software based on the finite element method (FEM) were developed considering the nonlinear physical behavior of the material. To evaluate the adopted software, a comparative analysis was made using the numerical and experimented results obtained from other software. In the pile caps studied, {{a variation in the}} wall thickness, socket interface, strut angle inclination and action on beam. The results show that the presence of a beam does not significantly <b>change</b> <b>pile</b> cap behavior and that the socket wall is able to effectively transfer the force from the beam to the pile caps. By the tensions on the bars of longitudinal reinforcement, it was possible to obtain the force on the tie and the strut angle inclination before the collapse of models. It was found that the angles present more inclinations than those used in the design, which was made based on a strut-and-tie model. More results are available at [URL]...|$|R
