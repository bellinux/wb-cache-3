40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the production of}} ERM®-AD 453 k/IFCC, which is a material certified for the catalytic activity concentration of lactate dehydrogenase (LD). This material was produced {{in collaboration with the}} International Federation for Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC) following ISO Guide 34 : 2009 [] and it is certified in accordance with ISO Guide 35 : 2006 []. The starting material was a recombinant form of human LD isoenzyme 1 expressed in E. coli. It was produced, purified, filled and lyophilised by Asahi Kasei Pharma Corporation (Tokyo, Japan). Between unit-homogeneity was quantified and stability during dispatch and storage were assessed in accordance with ISO Guide 35 : 2006 [2]. The material was characterised by an interlaboratory comparison of laboratories of demonstrated competence and adhering to ISO/IEC 17025 : 2005 []. Uncertainties of the certified values were calculated in accordance with the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM) [] and include uncertainties related to possible inhomogeneity, instability and characterisation. The material is intended for the assessment of method performance of the IFCC <b>primary</b> <b>reference</b> measurement <b>procedure</b> for the measurement of the catalytic activity concentration of LD at 37 °C. As with any reference material, it can be used for establishing control charts or validation studies. The certified reference material (CRM) is available in glass vials containing lyophilised material from 1 mL of LD solution. The minimum amount of sample to be used is 13 µL after reconstitution of the whole content in one vial. The CRM was accepted as European Reference Material (ERM®) after peer evaluation by the partners of the European Reference Materials consortium. JRC. F. 6 -Reference Material...|$|R

40|$|Background: <b>Reference</b> <b>procedures</b> are {{required}} for evaluating the accuracy of routine analytical systems for uric acid (UA). External quality assessment (EQA) for UA has only been conducted with quality controls in China, and the results have not been published. This {{study was designed to}} investigate both the trueness and inter-laboratory precision of UA measurements among routine analytical systems using a candidate reference method. Methods: We performed the HPLC method recommended by the Japan Society of Clinical Chemistry (JSCC). Next, we evaluated its analytical performance and validated its true-ness. The performance of 4 routine analytical systems (5 instruments per system, n= 20) for UA was assessed by using 4 frozen pooled serum samples measured by the HPLC method according to biologically relevant quality goals. Results: Within-run, between-run, inter-day, and total CV of the method were less than 0. 3 %, 0. 4 %, 1. 8 %, and 2. 6 %, respectively. The UA measurements were consistent with the target values of standard reference material (SRM) 909 b, the sixth ring trial for Refer-ence Laboratories (RELA- 2008) specimen, and national <b>primary</b> <b>reference</b> materials.

40|$|In {{laboratory}} medicine, {{the terms}} "standardization" and "harmonization" are frequently used interchangeably {{as the final}} goal is the same: the equivalence of measurement results among different routine measurement procedures over time and space according to defined analytical and clinical quality specifications. However, the terms define two distinct, albeit closely linked, concepts based on traceability principles. The word "standardization" is used when results for a measurement are equivalent and traceable to the International System of Units (SI) through a high-order <b>primary</b> <b>reference</b> material and/or a <b>reference</b> measurement <b>procedure</b> (RMP). "Harmonization" is generally used when results are equivalent, but neither a high-order <b>primary</b> <b>reference</b> material nor a <b>reference</b> measurement <b>procedure</b> is available. Harmonization is a fundamental aspect of quality in laboratory medicine as its {{ultimate goal is to}} improve patient outcomes through the provision of accurate and actionable laboratory information. Patients, clinicians and other healthcare professionals assume that clinical laboratory tests performed by different laboratories at different times on the same sample and specimen can be compared, and that results can be reliably and consistently interpreted. Unfortunately, this is not necessarily the case, because many laboratory test results are still highly variable and poorly standardized and harmonized. Although the initial focus was mainly on harmonizing and standardizing analytical processes and methods, the scope of harmonization now also includes all other aspects of the total testing process (TTP), such as terminology and units, report formats, reference intervals and decision limits as well as tests and test profiles, requests and criteria for interpretation. Several projects and initiatives aiming to improve standardization and harmonization in the testing process are now underway. Laboratory professionals should therefore step up their efforts to provide interchangeable and comparable laboratory information in order to ultimately assure better diagnosis and treatment in patient care...|$|R

40|$|Ultraprecision diamond {{machining}} processes require dimensional accuracy in the sub micrometer range. Besides {{the use of}} ultraprecision machine tools and diamond {{machining processes}}, the clamping and alignment of work pieces within the machine tool coordinate system is {{an essential step to}} accuracy. In most diamond milling and diamond shaping processes, the work piece {{does not have to be}} aligned to one specific point on the machine tool. It is rather the exact knowledge of the true work piece position which is essential to machine structures with sub micron precision. The so-called <b>referencing</b> <b>procedure</b> defines the relative position between the diamond tool and the surface of the work piece. Today, this <b>referencing</b> <b>procedure</b> is still done manually, either by machining and analyzing test samples or by aligning the tool via scratch marks on the work piece surface.

Percentages of very major errors were 2. 6 % between Vitek 2 and the EUCAST technique and 1. 6 % between Vitek 2 and the CLSI technique.

40|$|Abstract: A unified {{scale is}} {{recommended}} for reporting the NMR chemical shifts of all nuclei relative to the 1 H resonance of tetramethylsilane. The unified scale {{is designed to provide}} a precise ratio, Ξ, of the resonance frequency of a given nuclide to that of the <b>primary</b> <b>reference,</b> the 1 H resonance of tetramethylsilane (TMS) in dilute solution (volume fraction, ϕ < 1 %) in chloroform. <b>Referencing</b> <b>procedures</b> are discussed, including matters of practical application of the unified scale. Special attention is paid to recommended reference samples, and values of Ξ for secondary references on the unified scale are listed, many of which are the results of new measurements. Some earlier recommendations relating to the reporting of chemical shifts are endorsed. The chemical shift, δ, is redefined to avoid previous ambiguities but to leave practical usage unchanged. Relations between the unified scale and recently published recommendations for referencing in aqueous solutions (for specific use in biochemical work) are discussed, as well as the special effects of working in the solid state with magic-angle spinning. In all, nine new recommendations relating to chemical shifts are made. Standardized nuclear spin data are also presented in tabular form for the stable (and some unstable) isotopes of all elements with non-zero quantum numbers. The information given includes quantum numbers, isotopic abundances, magnetic moments, magnetogyric ratios and receptivities, together with quadrupol...|$|R
