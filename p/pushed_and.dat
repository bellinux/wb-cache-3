5|$|In August 1810, the French {{squadron}} on Isle de France (now Mauritius) {{achieved the}} most significant French naval victory of the Napoleonic Wars, when they captured or destroyed four Royal Navy frigates at the Battle of Grand Port. The battle was fought inside Grand Port, one of the harbours of Isle de France into which the French squadrons, dominant in the Indian Ocean during 1809, had been steadily <b>pushed</b> <b>and</b> blockaded by pressure from a British squadron under Commodore Josias Rowley. The British defeat had a noticeable galvanising effect on both the British and French naval commands: both recognised that the campaign would be won by the first to reinforce and resupply their forces. Although the French had achieved a significant victory, the naval bases on Isle de France lacked the military stores and food supplies to repair the battle damage to their ships or supply lengthy raiding voyages against British trade routes.|$|E

40|$|Although <b>pushing</b> <b>and</b> pulling is {{very common}} in {{occupational}} settings, this type of manual materials handling is less well studied than lifting and carrying. Several issues should be considered when obtaining exposure measures in epidemiological field studies on <b>pushing</b> <b>and</b> pulling. The {{purpose of this article}} is threefold: (i) to critically evaluate different methods to assess <b>push</b> <b>and</b> pull forces, (ii) to describe measures of exposure to <b>pushing</b> <b>and</b> pulling, and (iii) to consider measurement strategies for assessment of exposure to <b>pushing</b> <b>and</b> pulling. Firstly, information on the level of exerted forces with the accuracy needed for epidemiology can only be obtained from direct measurement methods. These methods are particularly required when <b>push</b> <b>and</b> pull tasks are biomechanically analysed, implying that also force direction and point of application relative to the worker have to be assessed. Secondly, to obtain a limited number of external exposure measures that reflect exposure to <b>pushing</b> <b>and</b> pulling over time, aggregation of various force measurements is suggested. Internal exposure measures and parameters corresponding to guidelines are also described. Thirdly, for truck drivers and refuse collectors a strategy of approximately five repeated measurements for each representative working situation is advised to obtain a reliable estimate of an individual's exposure to <b>pushing</b> <b>and</b> pulling. Relevance to industryAn overview is given of methods to assess forces accompanying <b>pushing</b> <b>and</b> pulling, which are very common activities in industry. Examples of exposure measures and measurement strategies in studies on adverse health effects of <b>pushing</b> <b>and</b> pulling are presented. Such studies should eventually stimulate prevention of work-related musculoskeletal disorders. Copyright (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B. V...|$|R
40|$|Objectives Low-back and {{shoulder}} complaints {{were examined in}} relation to self-reported and objectively assessed exposure to work-related <b>pushing</b> <b>and</b> pulling. Methods Workers from several companies (eg, nursing homes and flower auctions) with <b>pushing</b> <b>and</b> pulling tasks and, as reference, workers without physically demanding tasks were invited to participate. Altogether 829 workers initially received a questionnaire, of whom 459 responded both initially and after I year of follow-up. Initially, self-reported exposure to <b>pushing</b> <b>and</b> pulling was assessed by questionnaire. Furthermore, {{a representative sample of}} 131 workers was observed at work using TRAC (task recording and analysis on computer) to assess exposure to <b>pushing</b> <b>and</b> pulling objectively. For exposure to <b>pushing</b> <b>and</b> pulling, the workers were classified into a reference group and medium and high exposure groups. Initially and in the follow-up, the 12 -month prevalence of low-back {{and shoulder}} complaints was assessed. Complaints reported in the follow-up were separately used as dependent variables to calculate prevalence rate ratios (PR) in a Cox's proportional hazard regression analysis. Results The adjusted PR values were not significant for low-back complaints. For shoulder complaints, both the medium and high exposure groups showed significant adjusted PR values for self-reported exposure and observed duration of <b>pushing</b> <b>and</b> pulling when compared with the reference group (PR range 2. 18 - 4. 86). For the observed frequency of <b>pushing</b> <b>and</b> pulling, only the medium exposure group showed a significant PR, of 3. 95. Conclusions The findings suggest a rather strong relationship between <b>pushing</b> <b>and</b> pulling and shoulder complaints. The evidence for a relationship between <b>pushing</b> <b>and</b> pulling and low-back complaints is limite...|$|R
5|$|The Battle of Tabsor {{began with}} an intense {{creeping}} bombardment, during which three infantry divisions of the XXI Corps attacked the Tabsor defences; the only continuous trench-and-redoubt system on the Ottoman front line. As they advanced, their left flank was protected by the 60th Division, which advanced up the coast to the Nahr el Faliq, before capturing Tulkarm, {{the headquarters of the}} Eighth Army. Their right flank was secured by the 54th (East Anglian) Division, with the Détachment Français de Palestine et de Syrie pivoting on the Rafat salient. Defending the Ottoman front line against the attacks by the 3rd (Lahore), 7th (Meerut) and 75th Divisions were four divisions of the Ottoman Eighth Army: the 7th, 20th and 46th Infantry Divisions of the Ottoman XXII Corps and the 19th Division of the German Asia Corps. By {{the end of the first}} day of battle, the Ottoman 7th Division had ceased to exist and the Ottoman front line (which had previously stretched east-west from the coast) had been <b>pushed</b> <b>and</b> bent back to run north-south. The Seventh Army, further inland, was forced to withdraw when the Eighth Army was outflanked, to conform with the new Ottoman front line.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper was}} to perform a comprehensive review of psychophysically determined maximum acceptable <b>pushing</b> <b>and</b> pulling forces. Factors affecting <b>pushing</b> <b>and</b> pulling forces are identified and discussed. Recent studies show a significant decrease (compared to previous studies) in maximum acceptable forces for males but not for females when <b>pushing</b> <b>and</b> pulling on a treadmill. A comparison of <b>pushing</b> <b>and</b> pulling forces measured using a high inertia cart with those measured on a treadmill shows that the <b>pushing</b> <b>and</b> pulling forces using high inertia cart are higher for males but are about the same for females. It is concluded that the recommendations of Snook and Ciriello (1991) for <b>pushing</b> <b>and</b> pulling forces are still valid and provide reasonable recommendations for ergonomics practitioners. Regression equations as a function of handle height, frequency of exertion and pushing/pulling distance are provided to estimate maximum initial and sustained forces for <b>pushing</b> <b>and</b> pulling acceptable to 75 % male and female workers. At present {{it is not clear whether}} pushing or pulling should be favored. Similarly, it is not clear what handle heights would be optimal for <b>pushing</b> <b>and</b> pulling. Epidemiological studies are needed to determine relationships between psychophysically determined maximum acceptable <b>pushing</b> <b>and</b> pulling forces and risk of musculoskeletal injuries, in particular to low back and shoulders.

40|$|Multi-agent Pathfinding is a {{relevant}} {{problem in a}} wide range of domains, for example in robotics and video games research. Formally, the problem considers a graph consisting of vertices and edges, and a set of agents occupying vertices. An agent can only move to an unoccupied, neighbouring vertex, and the problem of finding the minimal sequence of moves to transfer each agent from its start location to its destination is an NP-hard problem. We present <b>Push</b> <b>and</b> Rotate, a new algorithm that is complete for Multi-agent Pathfinding problems in which there are at least two empty vertices. <b>Push</b> <b>and</b> Rotate first divides the graph into subgraphs within which it is possible for agents to reach any position of the subgraph, and then uses the simple <b>push,</b> swap, <b>and</b> rotate operations to find a solution; a post-processing algorithm is also presented that eliminates redundant moves. <b>Push</b> <b>and</b> Rotate can be seen as extending Luna <b>and</b> Bekris’s <b>Push</b> <b>and</b> Swap algorithm, which we showed to be incomplete in a previous publication. In our experiments we compare our approach with the <b>Push</b> <b>and</b> Swap, MAPP, and Bibox al-gorithms. The latter algorithm is restricted to a smaller class of instances as it requires biconnected graphs, but can nevertheless be considered state of the art due to its strong performance. Our exper-iments show that <b>Push</b> <b>and</b> Swap suffers from incompleteness, MAPP is generally not competitive with <b>Push</b> <b>and</b> Rotate, and Bibox is better than <b>Push</b> <b>and</b> Rotate on randomly generated biconnected instances, while <b>Push</b> <b>and</b> Rotate performs better on grids. 1...|$|R
40|$|Recent years’ {{terrorist}} attacks in Europe and the flow of foreign fighters joining the terrorist organisation Daesh, has made the understanding of radicalisation evermore crucial. This thesis investigates if <b>push</b> <b>and</b> pull factors leading into violent Islamic extremism differentiate between men and women. Furthermore, it assesses how preventive measures from The United Kingdom, Sweden <b>and</b> Denmark targets <b>push</b> <b>and</b> pull factors and if these are sensitive to sex. To fulfil this objective an exploratory thematic {{analysis was used to}} synthesise secondary qualitative research surrounding <b>push</b> <b>and</b> pull factors. The <b>push</b> <b>and</b> pull factor analysis revealed three trends: there were limited variation in the overall categories describing the <b>push</b> <b>and</b> pull factors present for men and women; what caused <b>push</b> <b>and</b> pull factors to manifest differed according to sex; and, there were differences in how much men and women were affected by these factors. The assessment of prevention measures showed that none of the measures explicitly mentioned <b>push</b> <b>and</b> pull factors, yet they all had the potential of targeting these. Sex was included in some aspects of the measures, but was not a consideration in relation to the targeting of <b>push</b> <b>and</b> pull factors. The thesis ends with a discussion of what implications the found results have for practice and offers suggestions to how prevention measures can be improved...|$|R

Data were collected from 228 visitors who were intercepted at various locations in a private park. The survey instrument assessed the reasons for visiting the park (<b>push</b> factors) <b>and</b> evaluated how well the park performed on a series of selected park attributes (pull factors). The results of a factor analysis revealed three <b>push</b> factors <b>and</b> three pull factors. Other analyses included an evaluation of the inter-relationship between these factors in terms of different sociodemographic subgroups and a general correlation analysis on the interrelationship among <b>push</b> <b>and</b> pull factors. This study provides useful managerial and practical implications for park managers, policymakers and communication strategists to gain an understanding of how <b>push</b> <b>and</b> pull factors affect tourists and their choice of private parks...|$|R

500|$|It is {{not just}} the women in his life that Lex has a {{difficult}} time maintaining a healthy relationship with, but his father as well. Rosenbaum characterizes the relationship between Lex and Lionel as a form of tug-of-war, and disagrees with John Glover's assessment that Lionel is merely testing Lex for the life he is going to take over. For Rosenbaum, Lex is being <b>pushed</b> <b>and</b> <b>pushed,</b> <b>and</b> Lex is afraid that he will reach the point that he knows he will {{no longer be able to}} come back from. In [...] "Vortex", Lex realizes that he forgot who he was in that moment that his father was trapped under the column, and he felt guilty over the situation. According to Rosenbaum, Lex realized that by letting his father die he would have been traveling down a dark path, and would have become all that his father was—evil. As Lex continues to live in his father's shadow, and as time progresses, he learns more about the [...] "monster" [...] that Lionel truly is. The breaking point comes when Lex learns that his father killed Lex's grandparents in a tenement fire. Rosenbaum sees this as the ultimate ethical dilemma—he likens it to parents learning that their child has murdered someone, and then having to decide if they should go to the authorities or not—and Lex, who can no longer take his father's abuse, decides to turn Lionel over to the FBI. According to Rosenbaum, the decision is justified to Lex, who sees that monster that Lionel really is from his actions—using electroshock therapy to erase Lex's memories, drugging Lex, killing his own parents, and the way he treated Lex's mother.|$|E
