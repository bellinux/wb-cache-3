60|$|Which {{leads me}} {{to say a few}} words of the petit jury, not forgetting Mr. Walters. I am assured by an eminent lawyer, that the power and office of a petit jury is judicial, that they only are the judges from whose {{sentence}} the indicted are to expect life or death. Upon their integrity and understanding the lives of all that are brought in judgment do ultimately depend; from their verdict there lies no appeal, by finding guilty or not guilty. They do complicately resolve both law and fact. As it hath been the law, so it hath always been the custom and practice of these juries (except as before) upon all general issues, pleaded in cases civil as well as criminal, to judge both of the law and fact. So it is said in the report of the Lord Chief Justice Vaughan in Bushell's case, That these juries determine the law in all matters where issue is joined and tried, in the <b>principal</b> <b>case</b> whether the issue be about trespass or debt, or disseizin in assizes, or a tort or any such like, unless they should please to give a special verdict with an implicate faith in the judgment of the Court, to which none can oblige them against their wills.|$|E
6000|$|The new {{government}} were {{not content with}} renouncing coercion for the present. They cast off all responsibility for its practice in the past. Ostentatiously they threw overboard the viceroy with whom the only fault that they had hitherto found, was that his sword was not sharp enough. A motion {{was made by the}} Irish leader calling attention to the maladministration of the criminal law by Lord Spencer. Forty men had been condemned to death, and in twenty-one of these cases the capital sentence had been carried out. Of the twenty-one executions six were savagely impugned, and Mr. Parnell’s motion called for a strict inquiry into these and some other convictions, with a view to the full discovery of truth and the relief of innocent persons. The debate soon became famous from the <b>principal</b> <b>case</b> adduced, as the Maamtrasna debate. The topic had been so copiously discussed as to occupy three full sittings of the House in the previous October. The lawyer who had just been made Irish chancellor, at that time pronounced against the demand. In substance the {{new government}} made no fresh concession. They said that if memorials or statements were laid before him, the viceroy would carefully attend to them. No minister could say less. But incidental remarks fell from the government that created lively alarm in tories and deep disgust in liberals. Sir Michael Hicks Beach, then leader of the House, told them that while believing Lord Spencer to be a man of perfect honour and sense of duty, “he must say very frankly that there was much in the Irish policy of the late government which, though in the absence of complete information he did not condemn, he should be very sorry to make himself responsible for.”(132) An even more important minister emphasised the severance of the new policy from the old. “I will tell you,” cried Lord Randolph Churchill, “how the present government is foredoomed to failure. They will be foredoomed to failure if they {{go out of their way}} unnecessarily to assume one jot or tittle of the responsibility for the acts of the late administration. It is only by divesting ourselves of all responsibility for the acts of the late government, that we can hope to arrive at a successful issue.”(133) ...|$|E
50|$|A {{provisional}} sentence simply entails {{that the}} judgment {{obtained by the}} plaintiff {{at this early stage}} is provisional and cannot prevent the defendant from proceeding to the <b>principal</b> <b>case.</b> The defendant may choose to satisfy the provisional judgment and subsequently, within two months, and by notification to the plaintiff, enter into the <b>principal</b> <b>case.</b>|$|E

Do refugee flows legitimate intervention? To answer such questions, <b>principal</b> <b>cases</b> of recent UN interventions are examined including Northern Iraq (to protect the Kurds), Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia and Rwanda. Substantial evidence is found in UN resolutions and related documents to infer a trend towards greater consideration of refugees when deciding about intervention. Yet, such consideration is less 'humanitarian' than security-focused. That refugees pose threats to others, not solely or principally their own suffering, continues to dominate multilateral decisions to intervene...|$|R
5000|$|It places an onus on the {{defendant}} at the preliminary sage {{to establish a}} defence by satisfying the court, on a balance of probabilities, that {{the defendant}} should not be made to pay the amount claimed by the plaintiff, and that the probability of success in the <b>principal</b> <b>case</b> does not favour the plaintiff.|$|E
50|$|The onus {{of proof}} is an {{important}} principle.

5000|$|In addition, {{the onus}} of proof at the trial is usually borne by the plaintiff, {{in terms of the}} rule that [...] "he who makes the averment or asserts the claim must prove it," [...] whereas during the provisional-sentence {{procedure}} the onus is on the defendant to satisfy the court that he will succeed in the <b>principal</b> <b>case.</b>|$|E
