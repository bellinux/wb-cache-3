6000|$|... "I am wondering, Sir Hugh," [...] he said, {{looking at}} him curiously, [...] "whether I saw certain things last night down yonder at the <b>Place</b> <b>of</b> <b>Arms</b> and in the boat, or whether I thought I saw them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What a <b>Place</b> <b>of</b> <b>Arms</b> for us!" [...] thinks Romanzow;--"though, indeed, for Campaign 1762, at {{this late}} time of year, it will not so much avail us." [...] No;--and for 1763, who knows if you will need it then! ...|$|E
60|$|Forward {{they went}} across the <b>Place</b> <b>of</b> <b>Arms,</b> past the timber stand ornamented with banners, which Murgh stayed to {{contemplate}} for an instant, until {{they came to the}} mouth of the street up which men had followed them, apparently with evil intent.|$|E
50|$|The International Arbitration and Peace Association (IAPA) was an {{organisation}} {{founded in}} London in 1880 with the stated objective of promoting arbitration and peace in <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>armed</b> conflicts and force. It published a journal, Concord.|$|R
25|$|The Hopfers prospered in Augsburg, and by 1505 Daniel owned a {{house in}} the city centre. He sat on the {{committee}} of the Augsburg guild of smiths, which at this time included painters and etchers, probably because these crafts were uniquely connected in the town, one of Europe's principal manufacturing <b>places</b> <b>of</b> <b>arms</b> and armour.|$|R
5000|$|The title phrase, idiot's delight (meaning [...] "solitaire" [...] in U.S. English), {{was reduced}} to insignificance in the film, perhaps to avoid the {{potential}} for religious controversy:Mr. Sherwood selected his title {{with a view to}} epitomizing his free notions of the motivation, in presumably high <b>places,</b> <b>of</b> <b>armed</b> conflict. His editorial instinct is highly emblazoned in the expression, in two words, of the only feasible basis that can exist for the precipitation of international slaughter.|$|R
60|$|Thus, slowly enough, {{for there}} were but three of them, two {{hampered}} by their mail, they bore Sir Geoffrey across the <b>Place</b> <b>of</b> <b>Arms.</b> Save {{for the dead}} and dying, and some ghoul-like knaves who plundered them, by {{this time it was}} almost deserted.|$|E
60|$|Hugh and Dick knew no Italian, {{yet they}} {{both of them}} understood, and with a shout leaped forward toward those hungry knives. But their holders never waited for them. Some sudden panic seized them all, so that they turned and ran--ran {{straight}} across the wide <b>Place</b> <b>of</b> <b>Arms</b> and vanished into the network of narrow streets by which it was surrounded.|$|E
6000|$|... "So {{once more}} we {{meet in a}} chapel, Father Nicholas. Say, how has it fared with you since you fled through the chancel door of that at Blythburgh Manor? No, I forgot, {{that was not the}} last time we met. A man in a yellow cap ripped off your mask in a by-street near the <b>Place</b> <b>of</b> <b>Arms</b> one night and said {{something}} which it did not please you to hear." ...|$|E
60|$|Half-an-hour {{later the}} second lamp went out. By {{the light that}} {{remained}} we made such arrangements as we could, knowing that soon darkness would be on us. They were few and simple: the fetching of a jar or two <b>of</b> water, the <b>placing</b> <b>of</b> <b>arms</b> and ammunition to our hands, and the spreading out of some blankets on which to lie down side by side upon what I for one believed would be our bed of death.|$|R
50|$|X-Terminator {{entered this}} series with a {{vertical}} flywheel in <b>place</b> <b>of</b> the axe/lifting <b>arm.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Tyr - Warrior {{from the}} planet Tyrraz with a bionic gun in <b>place</b> <b>of</b> his right <b>arm.</b>|$|R
60|$|At {{this moment}} an English lad of Sir Geoffrey's {{household}} chanced to pass by, having come to ask {{as to the}} feeding of the horse which Hugh should ride. Dick caught {{him by the arm}} and asked whether he could {{get them out of the}} house secretly, so that the Guards would not see them, and conduct them to the spot called the <b>Place</b> <b>of</b> <b>Arms,</b> where they understood they were to fight.|$|E
6000|$|Two fair arms closed tenderly round {{his neck}} as he stooped down. [...] "I am awake, George," [...] the poor child said, with a sob fit {{to break the}} little heart that nestled so closely by his own. She was awake, poor soul, and to what? At that moment a bugle from the <b>Place</b> <b>of</b> <b>Arms</b> began {{sounding}} clearly, and was taken up through the town; and amidst the drums of the infantry, and the shrill pipes of the Scotch, the whole city awoke.|$|E
60|$|After {{a journey}} that seemed long to Hugh, who wished to have this {{business}} over, {{they came to the}} <b>Place</b> <b>of</b> <b>Arms.</b> Their route there, however, was not the same which they had followed on the previous night. Leaving the short way through the low part of the town untraversed, they rowed from one of the canals into the harbour itself, where they were joined by many other boats which waited for them and so on to the quay. Hugh saw at once that the death ship, Light of the East, was gone, and incautiously said as much to Sir Geoffrey.|$|E

60|$|The {{history of}} Monterey {{has yet to}} be written. Founded by Catholic missionaries, a place of wise {{beneficence}} to Indians, a <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>arms,</b> a Mexican capital continually wrested by one faction from another, an American capital when the first House of Representatives held its deliberations, and then falling lower and lower from the capital of the State to the capital of a county, and from that again, by the loss of its charter and town lands, to a mere bankrupt village, its rise and decline is typical of that of all Mexican institutions and even Mexican families in California.|$|E
60|$|During this {{prosperity}} of the king's affairs his armies increased mightily in the western counties also. Sir William Waller, indeed, commanded for the Parliament in those parts too, and particularly in Dorsetshire, Hampshire, and Berkshire, where he carried on their cause but too fast; but farther west, Sir Nicholas Slanning, Sir Ralph Hopton, and Sir Bevil Grenvile had extended the king's quarters from Cornwall through Devonshire, and into Somersetshire, where they took Exeter, Barnstaple, and Bideford; and {{the first of these}} they fortified very well, making it a <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>arms</b> for the west, and afterwards it was the residence of the queen.|$|E
60|$|Having {{waited a}} while, {{they began to}} examine the spot where they found themselves, which Day told them was that <b>Place</b> <b>of</b> <b>Arms</b> where they must fight on the morrow. It was large and level, having {{been used as a}} {{drilling}} ground for generations. Perhaps it measured four hundred yards square, and almost in the centre of it rose a stand of painted timber roofed with canvas, and ornamented with gilded flagstaffs, from which hung banners. On this stand, David said, the Doge and nobles would take their seats to see the fray, for in front of it the charging knights must meet.|$|E

50|$|For most of {{its length}} the Highlands Highway {{is no more than}} a single {{carriageway}} two-lane road which is often hindered by potholes and land slips. It is also notorious, particularly in the Highlands region, for being the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> numerous <b>armed</b> hold-ups and robberies committed by local bandits called raskols.|$|R
50|$|The palace has, as described, two facades. The main facade on Piazza Broletto has a tall clocktower with an awkwardly <b>place</b> coat <b>of</b> <b>arms.</b> The niches {{hold the}} statue of Virgil and the Virgin. The palace shows the {{evidence}} of reconstruction across the centuries with walled up arches of prior windows, interrupted by newer construction.|$|R
60|$|Thus arrayed, {{taking no}} heed of the jests and chatter of the multitude, they {{were led to}} the front of the bedecked timber stand which they had seen on the {{previous}} night. In the centre of this stand, occupying a kind of tribune, sat the Doge Dandolo in state, and with him many nobles and captains, while to right and left the whole length of the course, for the stand was very long, were packed a countless number of the best-born men and women in Venice. These, however, were but a tithe of the spectators, who encircled the <b>Place</b> <b>of</b> <b>Arms</b> in one serried horde which was kept back by a line of soldiers.|$|E
60|$|Turning {{from this}} street, {{they made their}} way to the banks of a great canal that here ran into the harbour, that on which they had been rowed to the <b>Place</b> <b>of</b> <b>Arms.</b> Here by good luck they found a small boat {{floating}} keep uppermost, for it had been overturned by the number of people who crowded into it. This boat they righted with much toil and discovered within it a drowned lady, also an oar caught beneath the seat. After this their dreadful journey was easy, at least by comparison. For now all the gloom had rolled away, the sun shone out and a fresh and pleasant wind blew from the sea toward the land.|$|E
6000|$|The Russians {{have got}} into the Neumark of Brandenburg, on those bad terms; and are clearly aware that, without some Fortress as a <b>Place</b> <b>of</b> <b>Arms,</b> they are an {{overgrown}} Incompetency and Monstrosity {{in the field of}} War; doing much destruction, most of which proves self-destructive before long. But how help it? If the carrying of meal so far be difficult what will the carrying of siege-furniture be? A flat impossibility. Fermor, aware of these facts, remembers what happened at Oczakow,--long ago, in our presence, and Keith's and Munnich's, if the reader have not quite forgot. Munnich, on that occasion, took Oczakow without any siege-furniture whatever, by boldly marching up to it; nothing but audacity and good luck on his side. Fermor determines to try Custrin in the like way,--if peradventure Prussian soldiery be like Turk?-- ...|$|E
2500|$|Street {{believes}} that the Angel Inn, having been seized by the king, probably then became {{the property of the}} Knights Hospitallers. [...] He bases this conclusion on the presence <b>of</b> the <b>arms</b> <b>of</b> the Hospitallers on the East window of Grantham church in 1662 (as recorded by Gervase Holles in Notes <b>of</b> <b>Arms</b> in Grantham Church, a manuscript held in the British Museum), in <b>place</b> <b>of</b> the <b>arms</b> <b>of</b> the Templars that had been there, indicating that the Templars' property in Grantham had passed to the Hospitallers.|$|R
50|$|On December 17, 1990, a {{group of}} Christian youth {{assembled}} to protest the desecration and attack on St. John Vianney's Church in Peshawar. Prime Minister Mian Nawaz Sharif has directed all federal and provincial authorities to protect minorities and their <b>places</b> <b>of</b> worship. <b>Armed</b> police have been posted at the church since December 15, 1990.|$|R
50|$|Born without arms, {{she soon}} {{learned to use}} her strong legs, feet and toes, in <b>place</b> <b>of</b> her missing <b>arms</b> and hands; {{she was able to}} feed and groom herself, to write, draw and paint.|$|R
6000|$|Generals {{with their}} wheel mended, Margraves, Prince {{and now the}} Camp Equipage too, are all at Nurnberg; and start on the morrow; hardly a hundred miles now to be done,--but on slower terms, owing to the Equipage. Heilbronn, <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>arms</b> or central stronghold of the Reich's-Army, they reach on Monday: about Eppingen, next night, if the wind is westerly, one may hear the cannon,--not without interest. It was Wednesday forenoon, 7th July, 1734, on some hill-top coming down from Eppingen side, that the Prince first saw Philipsburg Siege, {{blotting}} the Rhine Valley yonder with its fire and counter-fire; and the Tents of Eugene stretching on this side: first view he ever had of the actualities of war. His account to Papa is so distinct and good, we look through it almost as at first-hand for a moment:-- ...|$|E
6000|$|In {{spite of}} these evil symptoms, a Greek oration and plenty of Latin plays were ready for Queen Elizabeth when she visited Oxford in 1566. The {{religious}} refugees, who had [...] "eaten mice at Zurich" [...] in Mary's time, had returned, and their influence was hostile to learning. A man who had lived on mice for his faith was above Greek. The court which contained Sydney, and which welcomed Bruno, {{was strong enough to}} make the classics popular. That famed Polish Count, Alasco, was [...] "received with Latin orations and disputes (1583) in the best manner," [...] and only a scoffing Italian, like Bruno, ventured to call the Heads of Houses THE DROWSY HEADS--dormitantes. Bruno was a man whom nothing could teach to speak well of people in authority. Oxford enjoyed the religious peace (not extended to [...] "Seminarists") of Elizabeth's and James's reigns, and did not foresee that she was about to become the home of the Court and a <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>arms.</b>|$|E
60|$|Fermor {{rose from}} Posen August 2d, almost three weeks ago; making daily for the Neumark and those unfortunate Oder Countries; nobody but Dohna to oppose him,--Dohna in {{the ratio of}} perhaps one against four. Dohna {{naturally}} laid hold of Frankfurt and the Oder Bridge, so that Fermor could not cross there; whereupon Fermor, as the next best thing, struck northward for the Warta (black Polish stream, last big branch of Oder); crossed this, at his ease, by Landsberg Bridge, August 10th [Tempelhof, ii. 216.] and after {{a day or two}} of readjustment in Landsberg, made for Custrin Country (his next head-quarter is at Gross Kamin); hoping in some accidental or miraculous way to cross Oder thereabouts, or even get hold of Custrin as a <b>Place</b> <b>of</b> <b>Arms.</b> If peradventure he can take Custrin without proper siege-artillery, in the Oczakow or Anti-Turk way? Fermor has been busy upon Custrin since August 15th;--in what fashion we partly heard, and will now, from authentic sources, see a little for ourselves.|$|E
50|$|The Flag of Bryansk Oblast {{represents}} a panel burgundy with {{a ratio of}} 1:1,5. In {{the center of the}} cloth is <b>placed</b> coat <b>of</b> <b>arms</b> <b>of</b> the Bryansk region. The coat <b>of</b> <b>arms</b> is a blue shield representing Slavic unity between the states of Russia, Belarus and Ukraine. In {{the upper part of the}} shield is a stylized golden spruce with a three-tiered crown representing the forests of Bryansk. The flag is burgundy in color, representing the color of the banners under which the army and guerrillas fought for the liberation of Bryansk.|$|R

5|$|Marking {{documents}} is {{the most}} common use <b>of</b> <b>arms</b> in the Church today. A Roman Catholic bishop's coat <b>of</b> <b>arms</b> was formerly painted on miniature wine barrels and presented during the ordination ceremony.
