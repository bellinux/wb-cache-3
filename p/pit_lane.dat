5|$|On lap 22 Adrian Sutil crashed at turn {{four and}} the safety car had to be deployed; Hamilton had pitted just before the incident. Thus the <b>pit</b> <b>lane</b> was closed but Alonso and Nico Rosberg were forced to pit {{in order to avoid}} running out of fuel, and were given ten-second stop-and-go penalties. When the <b>pit</b> <b>lane</b> was re-opened {{and the rest of the}} field pitted, Massa and Giancarlo Fisichella left the <b>pit</b> <b>lane</b> while the red light was still on. Both were later disqualified from the race on lap 51.|$|E

5|$|Felipe Massa {{tried to}} make up places after his pit lane-start, but was caught in midfield battles. He went into the <b>pit</b> <b>lane</b> {{simultaneously}} with Felipe Nasr in front and Pastor Maldonado behind him. A swift stop by the Lotus pit crew meant that Maldonado {{was able to get}} out ahead and gain two positions. Sauber driver Marcus Ericsson was running eighth when he came into the <b>pit</b> <b>lane</b> on lap 26. A 27-second pit stop due to problems with the front left tyre meant that he fell out of reach for a points finish. Carlos Sainz Jr. retired from the race right after exiting <b>pit</b> <b>lane</b> on lap 30, due to an issue with his front left wheel. His Toro Rosso teammate Max Verstappen joined him on the sidelines on lap 34 due to an electrical failure.|$|E

5|$|On lap 25, a man {{appeared}} {{beside the}} barriers of the circuit on the straight heading towards turn 2. He {{ran across the}} track to avoid being caught by marshals. The incident prompted the deployment of the safety car. Teams immediately brought their drivers into the <b>pit</b> <b>lane</b> {{to take advantage of}} the scenario with Trulli and de la Rosa the first to make pit stops. McLaren called in Häkkinen to the <b>pit</b> <b>lane</b> on lap 27 and Coulthard remained out on worn tyres. The Scot pitted on the following lap and emerged in sixth place. On the same lap, the man was caught and escorted off the circuit. Racing resumed on lap 29 when the safety car pulled into the <b>pit</b> <b>lane.</b> Trulli immediately came under pressure from Barrichello and withstood the Brazilian's attempts to pass him. Ralf Schumacher spun at turn 3 on lap thirty and Verstappen was forced wide in avoidance. Later on Alesi collided with Diniz and struck the barriers, having lost his car's two left wheels. The safety car was once again deployed as carbon fibre was scattered across the grass.|$|E

Set in 2116, Players control futuristic anti-gravity ships owned by racing corporations and pilot them on eight circuits (plus four hidden prototype tracks). Each craft is equipped with an energy shield that absorbs damage sustained on the track; if the shield is disabled, the player's craft can be knocked out of the race. Shields are regenerated in a <b>pit</b> <b>lane</b> that is set apart from the main course. The less {{time spent in the}} <b>pit</b> <b>lane,</b> the less the shield will regenerate.|$|E
5|$|Carlos Sainz Jr., who had {{qualified}} {{in eighth}} position, was adjudged to have missed {{a call to}} go to the weigh bridge during the first part of qualifying. Following the session, he was given a penalty which required him to start the race from the <b>pit</b> <b>lane.</b>|$|E

25|$|Higher Broadclough (at Broadclough Farm and Step Row) was {{originally}} the furthest {{point of the}} road that is now A671 before it turned 90 degrees and headed up through the farm yard, past the notable Step Row and up the road that is now Bacup Old Road. There is also an old bridge (extant but no longer in use) which probably predates the 18th century and which sits 10 yards south east of Dog <b>Pits</b> <b>Lane</b> having once served to connect Bacup Old Road to Todmorden Old Road before the turnpike was built.|$|R
5|$|Sebastian Vettel was {{the next}} one of the front runners to pit, coming in on lap 13, while {{teammate}} Kimi Räikkönen followed a lap later. Rosberg made a pit stop on lap 15 and emerged behind Bottas, overtaking him two laps later. Meanwhile, Hamilton went into the <b>pit</b> <b>lane</b> for a tyre change on lap 16. By lap 18, Hamilton was leading Vettel by 8.1 seconds, with Rosberg a further 3.8 seconds behind. Max Verstappen entered the point scoring ranks with a pass on Fernando Alonso into turn one on lap 26.

5|$|At {{the final}} {{meeting of the}} World Motorsports Commission in December 2011, a series of {{amendments}} to the sporting regulations were published. Chief among these is the re-introduction of a rule that will allow all lapped traffic under the safety car (which remained the Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG introduced in 2010) {{to be released from}} the queue before the car returns to <b>pit</b> <b>lane,</b> allowing the drivers to unlap themselves and to ensure a clean restart.|$|E
5|$|Häkkinen {{made his}} pit {{stop on the}} 26th lap and emerged behind Michael Schumacher, while Verstappen retired from the race with a {{mechanical}} problem. All of the leaders had taken their stops {{by the start of}} lap 28, the top ten were Michael Schumacher, Häkkinen, Ralf Schumacher, Barrichello, Coulthard, Button, Frentzen, Salo, Zonta and Wurz. Häkkinen set the fastest lap of the race on the same lap, a 1:24.470 as he started to close the gap to Michael Schumacher, as Ralf Schumacher again became under pressure by Coulthard in fourth. Eleven laps later, Coulthard entered the <b>pit</b> <b>lane,</b> triggering the second round of pit stops. Ralf Schumacher and Barrichello made a pit stop on the following lap and rejoined behind Coulthard. Michael Schumacher and Häkkinen both made their pit stops on the 41st lap, with Häkkinen emerging in front because Michael Schumacher's pit stop was problematic. Michael Schumacher's mechanics had started refulling after putting his tyres on causing him to be stationary for ten seconds longer than usual. Salo and Zonta went into the <b>pit</b> <b>lane</b> on lap 45, allowing Button into sixth.|$|E

The Anhembi Convention Center was used for support facilities and spectator attractions. The circuit was one of two IndyCar Series circuits (Baltimore the other) to have <b>pit</b> <b>lanes</b> not positioned at the start-finish line; São Paulo's was positioned after turn four.|$|R
5|$|KCMG's No 47 car had its {{qualifying}} lap times disallowed {{after it}} was discovered in post-qualifying scrutineering that the vehicle's skid block had insufficient rigidity and had been excessively flexible. The penalty meant Team SARD Morand's No. 43 car was promoted to second in LMP2 and the No. 47 entry was required to start from the <b>pit</b> <b>lane</b> with a 30-second time penalty.|$|E
5|$|Nakano lost grip in {{the front}} of his vehicle and went {{straight}} into the turn four wall on the same lap. He heavily damaged his car's right-hand side prompting a third caution. Nakano slid through the infield and stopped unhurt on the frontstretch. Bräck led the field back up to speed at the lap-70 restart, with Takagi in second. Green-flag pit stops began on lap 94, with Bräck stopping on the same lap and Franchitti became the leader. It was part of Franchitti's strategy, devised by his team manager Kyle Moyer, to drive in clean air. Andretti was required to serve a stop-and-go penalty, which he took on the 103rd lap, after he was observed speeding in the <b>pit</b> <b>lane.</b> Franchitti made his pit stop four laps later and Manning took over first place. Manning made his pit stop on lap 114 and Bräck reclaimed the lead. After starting from 16th, Dixon was running in sixth place by the 126th lap. He served two stop-and-go penalties because he was twice observed exceeding the <b>pit</b> <b>lane</b> speed limit, while Domínguez was similarly penalised.|$|E
5|$|Nine new garages {{were built}} {{at the end of}} the <b>pit</b> <b>lane,</b> {{replacing}} the four temporary garages that had been built a few years earlier. The additional garages allowed the ACO to increase the number of entries it could grant from 50 to 55. The paddock behind the garages was also re-organized with more facilities added for spectators, including more shops, new landscaping, and the Audi Tower monument.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the start, McLaren {{confirmed}} {{that they were}} unable to get Jenson Button's car to the grid, as the data indicated his earlier electrical issues continued. Felipe Massa's Williams did not get off the line {{at the start of the}} formation lap, so he had to start from <b>pit</b> <b>lane.</b> The start lights went on after a long delay, due to Pastor Maldonado being in the wrong grid position.|$|E
5|$|Roald Goethe {{was caught}} off guard as Hülkenberg lapped his No. 96 Aston Martin in Corvette Corner, causing Goethe to spin and heavily impact a {{concrete}} barrier leaving the turn. Goethe was conscious but needed aid in {{getting out of the}} Aston Martin requiring the intervention of a fourth safety car period. He was transported to a local hospital where he remained for several days and underwent surgery to two vertebra which had been fractured in the crash. Oliver Turvey had been the fastest driver in LMP2 at the time, bringing the Jota Gibson-Nissan into third place. The No. 64 Corvette came to the <b>pit</b> <b>lane</b> during the safety car period to change brakes, but was unable to get back out of <b>pit</b> <b>lane</b> in time before the exit was closed, forfeiting the class lead to the No. 51 AF Corse Ferrari. When racing resumed Webber was able to attack the No. 9 Audi after driving through traffic and take second position. The No. 42 Strakka Dome pulled off the track on the front stretch with gearbox issues and fluids leaked from his car, requiring a local slow zone. The No. 7 Audi of Lotterer made contact with Tandy's leading Porsche while both cars were in the slow zone, earning Lotterer a drive-through penalty. Viktor Shaitar overran the Indianapolis corner and became stuck in the gravel, losing two laps as it was extracted by recovery vehicles and went into the <b>pit</b> <b>lane</b> but remaining in second place in LMGTE Am.|$|E
5|$|The safety car was {{deployed}} {{an unprecedented}} four {{times during the}} course of the race.
