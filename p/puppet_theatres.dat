25|$|The Opera dei Pupi (Opera of the Puppets; Sicilian: Òpira dî pupi) is a {{marionette}} theatrical {{representation of}} Frankish romantic poems {{such as the}} Song of Roland or Orlando furioso {{that is one of}} the characteristic cultural traditions of Sicily. The sides of donkey carts are decorated with intricate, painted scenes; these same tales are enacted in traditional <b>puppet</b> <b>theatres</b> featuring hand-made marionettes of wood. The opera of the puppets and the Sicilian tradition of cantastorî (singers of tales) are rooted in the Provençal troubadour tradition in Sicily during the reign of Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor, in the first half of the 13th century. A great place to see this marionette art is the <b>puppet</b> <b>theatres</b> of Palermo. The Sicilian marionette theatre Opera dei Pupi was proclaimed in 2001 and inscribed in 2008 in the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists.|$|E

2500|$|Georges Méliès {{attended}} the Lycée Michelet from age seven {{until it was}} bombed during the Franco-Prussian War; he was then sent to the prestigious Lycée Louis-le-Grand. In his memoirs, Méliès emphasised his formal, classical education, in contrast to accusations {{early in his career}} that most filmmakers had been [...] "illiterates incapable of producing anything artistic." [...] However, he acknowledged that his creative instincts usually outweighed intellectual ones: [...] "The artistic passion was too strong for him, and while he would ponder a French composition or Latin verse, his pen mechanically sketched portraits or caricatures of his professors or classmates, if not some fantasy palace or an original landscape that already had the look of a theatre set." [...] Often disciplined by teachers for covering his notebooks and textbooks with drawings, young Georges began building cardboard <b>puppet</b> <b>theatres</b> at age ten and moved on to craft even more sophisticated marionettes as a teenager. Méliès graduated from the Lycée with a baccalauréat in 1880.|$|E
