30|$|When {{observing a}} {{municipality}} {{with more than}} one <b>pay</b> <b>date,</b> we use the earliest <b>pay</b> <b>date</b> to define the distance between payments and interviews. Though this criterion may introduce measurement bias, we also perform additional regressions using the last <b>pay</b> <b>date</b> within the municipalities to re-define temporal distance between payments and interviews. In Section 5.3, however, we perform an additional sensitivity analysis to check whether results hold when using exact payment dates.|$|R
30|$|For the {{empirical}} analysis, we construct four dummy variables {{according to the}} distance between the pay day and the reference week. Specifically, the first dummy variable is equal to one if the <b>pay</b> <b>date</b> takes place, at least, two weeks before the reference week, and zero otherwise. Similarly, the second dummy takes the value of one when the <b>pay</b> <b>date</b> occurs one week before the reference week, and zero otherwise. The third dummy variable is equal to one if the <b>pay</b> <b>date</b> happens some day during the reference week, and zero otherwise. Finally, the fourth dummy variable takes the value of one when the <b>pay</b> <b>date</b> takes place after the reference week, and zero if not 8.|$|R
3000|$|As {{an attempt}} to {{dissipate}} concerns related to measurement errors, we next construct a different measure of distance between <b>pay</b> and interview <b>dates.</b> Recall that our measure of [...] "recentness" [...] of the cash transfer {{is defined as the}} distance in weeks between the <b>pay</b> <b>date</b> and households’ interview dates within a given municipality. Nevertheless, a municipality could have more than one <b>pay</b> <b>date,</b> since Juntos payment schedule is defined at the village level. Up until now, we have used the earliest date to construct our measures of distance between <b>pay</b> <b>dates</b> and the reference week.|$|R
30|$|We {{divide the}} {{temporal}} distance between <b>pay</b> <b>dates</b> and interview dates {{in terms of}} weeks for two reasons. First, as pointed earlier, within a given municipality there exists a probability to observe more than one <b>pay</b> <b>date.</b> This is because administrative records on <b>pay</b> <b>dates</b> {{are available at the}} village level, which is the smallest geopolitical unit in Peru. Yet, ENAHO dataset contains geographical identifiers only at the municipality level (which may contain more than one village). This data limitation forces us to collapse administrative records containing payment dates by village at the municipality level in order to merge them with the ENAHO dataset. When doing so, almost all villages (99.8 % in our sample) within a given municipality are observed to have <b>pay</b> <b>dates</b> during the same week. Second, it has been observed that not all beneficiaries withdraw the money on the very same <b>pay</b> <b>date.</b> For this reason, we assume a rather more parsimonious definition of temporal distance which allows for some delay in order for beneficiaries to have the money.|$|R
3000|$|..., which {{measures}} {{the effect of}} the distance between <b>pay</b> <b>dates</b> and interview dates. Therefore, these parameters are recovered using across-municipalities variation in <b>pay</b> <b>dates</b> and within-municipality variation in interview dates. In what follows, the omitted category is that the payment takes place at least two weeks before the reference week (i.e., the first dummy variable).|$|R
40|$|The Hidden Cost of Buying on the Dividend <b>Pay</b> <b>Date</b> On the {{day that}} {{dividends}} are paid we find a significant positive mean abnormal return, followed by a reversal that negates most of this price appreciation. This temporary dividend <b>pay</b> <b>date</b> effect has grown in magnitude since the 1970 ’s, and is concentrated among high dividend yield stocks that offer dividend reinvestment plans (DRIPs). Since the mid- 1990 s, these stocks yield a mean abnormal return close to 0. 5 % on the dividend <b>pay</b> <b>date.</b> This temporary inflation is larger in magnitude for stocks subject to greater limits to arbitrage. Quarterly profits from a trading strategy to exploit this anomaly are economically significant, and positively related to time series movements in market sentiment, transaction costs, the dividend premium, and the VIX. For investors who reinvest their dividends on the <b>pay</b> <b>date,</b> this temporary inflation represents a substantial implicit transaction cost. JEL Classification: D 82, G 14, G 19.

30|$|Differences between Juntos <b>pay</b> <b>dates</b> and ENAHO’s {{interview}} dates {{within a}} given municipality constitute {{the basis of our}} empirical strategy. In particular, we will explore whether labor supply is reduced in the days near the <b>pay</b> <b>dates.</b> What we do in practice is to compare beneficiaries, within the same municipality, who are interviewed just after the payment to those who are not. Given that most households members are engaged in agricultural and highly-flexible occupations (i.e., independent workers), it is likely to observe that individuals reduce their working effort in days following the cash receipt.|$|R

30|$|Though {{distance}} between program’s <b>pay</b> <b>dates</b> and ENAHO’s interview dates is presumably exogenous, the estimates {{in the previous}} section may be capturing some confounding effects. First, the way we construct the temporal distance when observing more than one <b>pay</b> <b>date</b> in a given municipality could introduce measurement bias, attenuating our estimated effects. Second, there still some additional effects which have not been discarded in previous estimates, downwardly biasing our results. In particular, the way in which time spent in going to withdraw the money can affect the results has not been discussed, and can erroneously be interpreted as a disincentive effect to work. Third, results can be sensitive to the inclusion of non-poor beneficiaries in the sample. Finally, our measures of {{distance between}} <b>pay</b> and interview <b>dates</b> can be capturing effects other than income effects, affecting the interpretation of our results.|$|R

30|$|This article {{deviates}} {{from the}} previous literature in two subtle but important ways. On the one hand, this study represents the first attempt to analyze the transitory effects of welfare programs, namely CCTs, on labor supply. That is, we do not aim to estimate the average treatment effect of CCTs on labor supply. Instead, {{we are interested in}} exploring whether benefit recipients change their labor supply after they receive the cash transfer. On the other hand, we adopt a novel empirical strategy which exploits exogenous variation in the difference between the program’s <b>pay</b> <b>dates</b> and interview dates of a household survey. The combination of <b>pay</b> <b>dates</b> and interview dates allows us to compare beneficiaries’ labor supply before and after receiving the cash transfer. We think of these deviations as representing our contribution to the literature on the labor supply responses to cash transfers.|$|R
