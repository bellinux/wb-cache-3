5000|$|The terms false fruit, {{spurious}} fruit, and <b>pseudocarp</b> {{are older}} terms for accessory fruit {{that have been}} criticized as [...] "inapt", and are not used by some botanists today.|$|E
50|$|The tough leaves grow {{in large}} rosettes, arising basally from a crown. These leaves {{are long and}} {{lanceolate}} with a serrate or thorny margin. The flowers, arising {{from the heart of}} the rosette, each have their own sepals. They grow into a compact head on a short, robust stalk. The sepals become fleshy and juicy and develop into the well-known complex form of the <b>pseudocarp</b> fruit, crowned by a rosette of leaves.|$|E
50|$|An {{accessory}} fruit (sometimes called false fruit, spurious fruit, pseudofruit, or <b>pseudocarp)</b> is a {{fruit in}} which some of the flesh is derived not from the ovary but from some adjacent tissue exterior to the carpel. Examples of accessory tissue are the receptacle of the strawberry, pineapple, common fig, and mulberry, and the calyx of Gaultheria procumbens or Syzygium jambos. Pomes, such as apples and pears, are also accessory fruits, {{with much of the}} fruit flesh derived from a hypanthium. Other example could be the anthocarps specific to the family Nyctaginaceae, where most of the fruit comes from the perianth (floral whorls).|$|E
50|$|The name of {{the town}} was {{actually}} derived from alimodia or alimodias, the old Visayan name for Coix lachryma-jobi, a grain-bearing tropical plant of the grass family ubiquitous in the town. It is so called Job's tears because of the shape of its hard-shelled <b>pseudocarps</b> which are made by some into necklaces or rosary beads.|$|R
40|$|The inflorescences, {{flowers and}} the vascularization of floral parts of Hedycarya arborea and Laurelia novae-zelandiae were {{described}} and comparisons made {{with other members}} of the family in an attempt to determine the basic types of inflorescences, flowers and floral vascularization in the family. The vegetative, inflorescence and floral meristems of the two genera were compared. It was concluded that the vegetative apices of both had the tunica-corpus configuration typical of many other woody Ranales and other orders. The inflorescence apices were quite similar to the vegetative ones. The young floral apices are in a state of transition from a tunica-corpus to a mantle-core configuration and older floral apices had the mantle-core configuration, which is typical of the floral apices of many woody Ranales. Unusual features of the floral apices of Hedycarya and Laurelia were the lack of a pronounced rib meristem and the occurrence of relatively frequent divisions within vacuolate cells of the core. The ontogeny of the stamens of Hedycarya and Laurelia was described and comparisons were made. In both genera the micro-sporangium developed in a similar fashions: in Hedycarya 5 - 6 wall layers are formed inside the epidermis; in Laurelia there are 3 - 5 layers. Both genera had a typically thickened endothecium and a tapetum of the secretory type in which the tapetal cells become binucleate during the first meiotic division of the pollen mother cells. In Hedycarya the meiotic divisions of the pollen mother cells are of the successive type in which walls form by means of centrifugal cell plates Pollen grains remain in permanent tetrads in this genus. In Laurelia wall formation at the end of meiosis is of a modified simultaneous type, which may not have been hitherto described in the literature. Pollen grains are not in permanent tetrads. When the first division occurs in each microspore in Hedycarya, all four cells of a tetrad are at the same stage of division and the generative cell is cut off towards the distal face of the grain. Each microspore is in the two celled condition when shed. It was deduced that the generative cell is cut off against what represents a radial wall of the grain (with reference to the tetrad stage) in Laurelia. Pollen is shed in either the two or three celled condition. Comparisons were made with the development of microsporangia and male gametophytes in other woody Ranales. A study was made of the ontogeny, structure and function of the staminal appendages of Laurelia. It was found that the appendages function as nectaries, the nectar being predominantly sucrose. After a discussion of the various theories as to the morphological nature of the staminal appendages of the Laurales, it was concluded that they are morphologically staminodes. The carpels of Hedycarya and Laurelia have a basically similar ontogeny in which, as in the Lauraceae, the terminal stigmatic region develops from a solid terminal meristem in contrast to many woody Ranales in which the stigma-consists of crests which surround the external part of the cleft of the carpel. The ovules of Hedycarya and Laurelia resemble those of most other woody Ranales in being bitegmic, crassinucellate and anatropous with a monosporic 8 -nucleate embryo sac of the Polygonum type. Both linear and T-shaped megaspore tetrads were found in the two genera. Laurelia has <b>pseudocarps</b> which develop after anthesis and enclose plumose achenes, but in Hedycarya the fruits are drupes. It was concluded that Laurelia and Hedycarya belong to two subfamilies which have been separated from each other for a long time and have undergone considerable evolution in different directions. It was also concluded that the Monimiaceae are closely related to the Lauraceae...|$|R
5000|$|The {{fruit of}} the cashew tree is an {{accessory}} fruit (sometimes called a <b>pseudocarp</b> or false fruit). What {{appears to be the}} fruit is an oval or pear-shaped structure, a hypocarpium, that develops from the pedicel and the receptacle of the cashew flower. Called the cashew apple, better known in Central America as marañón, it ripens into a yellow and/or red structure about 5-11 cm long. It is edible and has a strong [...] "sweet" [...] smell and a sweet taste. The pulp of the cashew apple is very juicy, but the skin is fragile, making it unsuitable for transport. In Latin America, a fruit drink is made from the cashew apple pulp which has a very refreshing taste and tropical flavor that can be described as having notes of mango, raw green pepper, and just a little hint of grapefruit-like citrus.|$|E
40|$|Physical Quality of cashew (Anacardium occidentale) <b>pseudocarp</b> (the pear-shaped {{fruit of}} the cashew) Silage in Combination with Various Levels of Cassava Mill Addition and Length of Fermentation. The aim of this {{experiment}} was to evaluate physical quality of cashew <b>pseudocarp</b> silage in combination with various levels of cassava mill addition and length of fermentation. This study was designed with a factorial completely randomized design in two treatment factors with three replications. The first factor was various level of cassava mill i. e. L 1 : 0 %, L 2 : 3 %, L 3 : 6 %, and L 4 : 9 %, and the second factor was length of fermentation i. e. W 1 : 20 days, W 2 : 40 days and W 3 : 60 days. The result showed that the cassava mill levels {{and the length of}} fermentation did not affected to the damage and decrease level of cashew <b>pseudocarp</b> silage (P> 0. 05) but it affected to the level of acidity (P> 0. 01). The physical quality of cashew <b>pseudocarp</b> silage was very good with the damage level average was 1. 19 %, and the decrease level average was 6. 87 %. The level of acidity ranged from 3. 72 to 4. 14. The lowest acidity level was at L 4 W 1 (3. 72) and the highest one was at L 2 W 2 (4. 14) with the average of acidity was 3. 93. Thus, it can be concluded that the best physical quality of cashew <b>pseudocarp</b> silage was at 9 % level of cassava mill with 60 days of fermentation length. However, all treatment combinations of cassava mill level and fermentation length produced high physical quality of silage...|$|E
40|$|Fruit size is an {{important}} quality parameter determining fruit prices. Apart from the obvious genotype influence on fruit size, size is influenced by many other factors. In {{the case of the}} pear, the fruit is derived for the greater part from the floret receptacle and the base of the floral tube, sometimes referred to as <b>pseudocarp.</b> Therefore both the floral differentiation phase prior to anthesis as well as the development of the fruit after anthesis will determine eventual fruit size. During the phase prior to anthesis the number of cells that develop in the floral parts that will be incorporated in the fruit are of importance. These include climatic factors e. g., temperature, but also intraplant factors like crop load, bearing position etc. During the period following anthesis, final fruit size will be determined by two distinct periods, viz., the cell division stage followed by the cell enlargement stage. These stages are again influenced by a number of factors including climatic as well as intraplant factors which again can be influenced by horticultural practices...|$|E
40|$|Apple {{is one of}} {{the most}} worldwide-consumed fruits and a number of cultivars, differing in {{organoleptic}} and nutritional characteristics, are available for the market. Annurca apple is a regional variety from Southern Italy, which is known for crispness, excellent taste and long shelf life of fruits. These features have renewed the interest in the investigation of their genetic potential and different studies have lead to their partial genetic and metabolic characterisation. In this study, we present the analysis of the protein repertoire of the <b>pseudocarp</b> tissues of three accessions of Malus x domestica Borkh. cv. Annurca, as first example of the systematic annotation of the apple proteome. Proteins were extracted from fruit tissues and resolved on 2 -DE gels; commonly expressed proteins were in-gel digested and analysed by MALDI-TOF-MS and muLC-ESI-IT-MS/MS approaches. Peptide MS and MS/MS data were searched against publicly available protein and EST databases, and 44 spots were identified and associated to 28 different species. They were related to important physiological processes such as energy production, ripening and stress response. The occurrence of allergens causative of widespread food allergy syndromes was also detected. Integration of genomic, metabolomic and proteomic data will be indispensable for future molecular characterisation and hence full exploitation of the peculiar organoleptic, nutritional and agronomic traits of local cultivars of fruits...|$|E
