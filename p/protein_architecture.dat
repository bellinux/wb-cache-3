25|$|YadA is {{a protein}} domain found in Gram-negative {{bacteria}} such as Yersinia enterocolitica, Yersinia pestis, and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis. YadA stands for Yersinia adhesin protein A. This protein domain {{is an example}} of Trimeric Autotransporter Adhesins, {{and it was the first}} TAA to be discovered. Like other TAAs, YadA also undergoes homotrimerisation to form a stable collagen-binding protein. Homotrimerisation is a process whereby three of the same subunits, associate to make a complex of three identical YadA proteins. Furthermore, just like other TAAs, it has a head-stalk-anchor <b>protein</b> <b>architecture.</b> The majority of TAAs share strong similarity in the C-terminal membrane anchor region, the only member to differ across TAAs is the head, neck, and stalk regions. The head region of YadA is composed of beta-helices further folded to create a nine-coiled left-handed parallel beta-roll (LPBR).|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Conserved domains are {{recognized}} as {{the building blocks of}} eukaryotic proteins. Domains showing a tendency to occur in diverse combinations (‘promiscuous’ domains) are involved in versatile <b>architectures</b> in <b>proteins</b> with different functions. Current models, based on global-level analyses of domain combinations in multiple genomes, have suggested that the propensity of some domains to associate with other domains in high-level architectures increases with organismal complexity. Alternative models using domain-based phylogenetic trees propose that domains have become promiscuous independently in different lineages through convergent evolution and are, thus, random with no functional or structural preferences. Here we test whether complex <b>protein</b> <b>architectures</b> have occurred by accretion from simpler systems and whether the appearance of multidomain combinations parallels organismal complexity. As a model, we analyze the modular evolution of the PWWP domain and ask whether its appearance in combinations with other domains into multidomain architectures is linked with the occurrence of more complex life-forms. Whether high-level combinations of domains are conserved and transmitted as stable units (cassettes) through evolution is examined in the genomes of plant or metazoan species selected for their established position {{in the evolution of the}} respective lineages. Results Using the domain-tree approach, we analyze the evolutionary origins and distribution patterns of the promiscuous PWWP domain to understand the principles of its modular evolution and its existence in combination with other domains in higher-level <b>protein</b> <b>architectures.</b> We found that as a single module the PWWP domain occurs only in proteins with a limited, mainly, species-specific distribution. Earlier, it was suggested that domain promiscuity is a fast-changing (volatile) feature shaped by natural selection and that only a few domains retain their promiscuity status throughout evolution. In contrast, our data show that most of the multidomain PWWP combinations in extant multicellular organisms (humans or land plants) are present in their unicellular ancestral relatives suggesting they have been transmitted through evolution as conserved linear arrangements (‘cassettes’). Among the most interesting biologically relevant results is the finding that the genes of the two plant Trithorax family subgroups (ATX 1 / 2 and ATX 3 / 4 / 5) have different phylogenetic origins. The two subgroups occur together in the earliest land plants Physcomitrella patens and Selaginella moellendorffii. Conclusion Gain/loss of a single PWWP domain is observed throughout evolution reflecting dynamic lineage- or species-specific events. In contrast, higher-level <b>protein</b> <b>architectures</b> involving the PWWP domain have survived as stable arrangements driven by evolutionary descent. The association of PWWP domains with the DNA methyltransferases in O. tauri and in the metazoan lineage seems to have occurred independently consistent with convergent evolution. Our results do not support models wherein more complex <b>protein</b> <b>architectures</b> involving the PWWP domain occur with the appearance of more evolutionarily advanced life forms. </p...|$|R
50|$|In {{structural}} biology, a beta-propeller {{is a type}} of all-β <b>protein</b> <b>architecture</b> {{characterized by}} 4 to 8 blade-shaped beta sheets arranged toroidally around a central axis. Each sheet typically has four antiparallel β-strands twisted so that the first and fourth strands are almost perpendicular to each other. The enzyme's active site is often found in the cleft formed {{in the center of the}} propeller by loops connecting the successive four-sheet motifs. Murzin proposed a geometric model to describe the structural principles of the beta propeller. According to this model the seven bladed propeller was the most favoured arrangement in geometric terms.|$|E

The haem c groups, all bis-histidinyl coordinated, are structurally and functionally nonequivalent and present different redox potentials {{in the range}} 0 to -400 mV. The 3D structures {{of a number of}} cyt C3 proteins have been determined. The proteins consist of 4-5 alpha-helices and 2 beta-strands wrapped around a compact core of four non-parallel haems, which present a relatively high degree of exposure to the solvent.

50|$|ACAD enzymes {{have been}} {{identified}} in animals (of which there are 9 major eukaryotic classes), as well as plants, nematodes, fungi, and bacteria. Five of these nine classes are involved in fatty acid β-oxidation (SCAD, MCAD, LCAD, VLCAD, and VLCAD2), and the other four are involved in branched chain amino acid metabolism (i3VD, i2VD, GD, and iBD). Most acyl-CoA dehydrogenases are α4 homotetramers, and in two cases (for very long chain fatty acid substrates) they are α2 homodimers. An additional class of acyl-CoA dehydrogenase was discovered that catalyzes α,β-unsaturation reactions with steroid-CoA thioesters in certain types of bacteria. This class of ACAD was demonstrated to form α2β2 heterotetramers, rather than the usual α4 homotetramer, a <b>protein</b> <b>architecture</b> that evolved in order to accommodate a much larger steroid-CoA substrate.|$|E

40|$|The {{majority}} of protein architectures exhibit elements of structural symmetry, and “gene duplication and fusion” is the evolutionary mechanism generally hypothesized {{to be responsible}} for their emergence from simple peptide motifs. Despite the central importance of the gene duplication and fusion hypothesis, experimental support for a plausible evolutionary pathway for a specific <b>protein</b> <b>architecture</b> has yet to be effectively demonstrated. To address this question, a unique “top-down symmetric deconstruction” strategy was utilized to successfully identify a simple peptide motif capable of recapitulating, via gene duplication and fusion processes, a symmetric <b>protein</b> <b>architecture</b> (the threefold symmetric β-trefoil fold). The folding properties of intermediary forms in this deconstruction agree precisely with a previously proposed “conserved architecture” model for symmetric protein evolution.

This delocalization dramatically stabilizes the deprotonation of an active site tyrosine residue, resulting in a very large isotope effect on its acidity. When an intermediate analog is docked, it is incorporated into the hydrogen bond network, giving rise to extended quantum proton delocalization in the active site.
