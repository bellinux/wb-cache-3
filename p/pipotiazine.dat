5000|$|<b>Pipotiazine</b> (Piportil), {{also known}} as pipothiazine, is a typical {{antipsychotic}} of the phenothiazine class used in the United Kingdom and other countries {{for the treatment of}} schizophrenia. Its properties {{are similar to those of}} chlorpromazine. A 2004 systematic review investigated its efficacy for people with schizophrenia: ...|$|E
40|$|The {{long-term}} clinical effects ofpipotiazine palmitate {{were tested}} in 206 {{men and women who}} were either not responding well to their previous neuroleptic therapy or who were negligent about pursuing protracted oral drug therapy. Of the 206 patients, 130 were suffering from some form of chronic schizo-phrenia; the remainder presented with depression, psychoneurotic or behavioural disorders. <b>Pipotiazine</b> palmitate, a long-acting depot neuroleptic, was given as a monthly intramuscular injection for up to 23 months. The average starting dose was 50 mglinjection and the average final dose was 65 mglinjection. These doses were somewhat lower than those usually reported in the literature, however all but a few patients received oral neuroleptics or antidepressants concomitantly. Psychiatric testing using the BriefPsychiatric Rating Scale revealed that significant improvement was achieved over time in all diagnostic groups represented. Individual as well as cumulative scores improved steadily for 6 months at which time symptomatology was minimal in most patients. <b>Pipotiazine</b> palmitate was well tolerated, and only seven (3 Â· 4 %) ofthe 206 patients had to interrupt therapy because of unwanted effects. The most frequent side-effects were extrapyramidal symptoms, particularly tremor and rigidity, yet these effects led to the discontinuation of therapy in only five patients...|$|E
40|$|In the rat brain, {{destruction}} of dopaminergic cell groups by injections of 6 -hydroxydopamine into the ventral mesencephalic tegmentum results in large decreases {{in the number}} of neurotensin binding sites in the mesencephalon and the striatum. In contrast, these lesions produce an increase {{in the number of}} 125 I-labeled neurotensin binding sites in the lateral part of the prefrontal cortex despite a large decrease in cortical dopamine levels. Increases in the number of 125 I-labeled neurotensin binding sites in this cortical area as well as in the entorhinal cortex, the nucleus accumbens, and the central part of the striatum were also obtained after chronic blockade of dopamine neurotransmission by a long-acting neuroleptic <b>pipotiazine</b> palmitic ester. We propose that dopamine inputs regulate the density of postsynaptic neurotensin binding sites through cortical and subcortical dopamine receptors. Therefore, some of the clinical effects of neuroleptics in schizophrenic patients could be partly related to changes in neurotensin neurotransmission...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the outcome of}} 15 patients with chlorpromazine (CPZ) -induced abnormal skin pigmentation (ASP) in whom CPZ was replaced with other neuroleptics for three to 13 years. Complete resolution of ASP occurred {{over a period of}} six months to five years following substitution with haloperidol (four patients), levomepromazine (three patients), trifluoperazine (one patient), thioproperazine (one patient) as the sole neuroleptic, by a combination of two of the three phenothiazines (four patients) or haloperidol plus <b>pipotiazine</b> (one patient). Resolution was maintained during the remainder of the follow-up period. In one patient, at final follow-up, marked improvement was present three years after CPZ was replaced with levomepromazine. Bilateral lenticular pigmentary deposits persisted in all eight patients examined 3. 3 to 13 years after replacing CPZ and less than three months to nine years after resolution of ASP; improvement was noted in only one of these patients. Bilateral endothelial corneal deposits, present in five patients while on CPZ therapy, had disappeared in two patients seven and 13 years, respectively, after replacing CPZ; improvement was noted in two other patients. These findings indicate that: 1. CPZ-induced ASP is completely reversible in most, if not all, patients if CPZ is withdrawn; 2. a variety of neuroleptics including other phenothiazines can be used to replace CPZ without risk of re-emergence of ASP; 3. CPZ-induced lenticular changes persist whereas corneal changes may resolve slowly over a period of many years following replacement of CPZ; 4. ASP and ocular changes induced by CPZ may be subserved by two different pathophysiological mechanisms...|$|E
