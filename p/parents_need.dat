Although substantial research exists on SCI and sexuality in adults, very little exists on the ways in which it affects development of sexuality in young people. Injured {{children and adolescents}} need ongoing, age-appropriate sex education that addresses questions of SCI as it relates to sexuality and sexual function. Very young children become aware of their disabilities before their sexuality, but as they age they become curious just as able-bodied children do, and it is appropriate to provide them with increasing amounts of information. Caregivers help the child and family prepare for transition into adulthood, including in sexuality and social interaction, beginning early and intensifying during adolescence. <b>Parents</b> <b>need</b> education about the effects of SCI on sexual function so that they can answer their children's questions.|$|E

The Talmud and Oral Law are not considered canonical, and rabbinical opinions are not considered authoritative either, but every interpretation is held up to the same scrutiny, regardless of its source.

They can also have only one or two given names (religious names not included since they are not official, see above). Given names can be chosen by the parents from an official list of several thousand names (technically, one list for each gender). If the intended name is not on the list, the <b>parents</b> <b>need</b> to apply for approval. Applications are considered by the Research Institute for Linguistics of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences following a set of principles. Thus, names are approved if they are not derogatory or overly diminutive, can be written and pronounced easily, can be recognised as either male or female, etc. Approved names expand the official list, the newest edition of which is regularly published. A lot of recent additions are foreign names, which, however, must be spelled following Hungarian phonetics, e.g. Jennifer becomes Dzsenifer or Joe becomes Dzsó.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1996, Marshall University {{sociology}} professor Dr. William Westbrook was {{having a conversation with}} a recent Master's graduate. [...] The graduate inquired about Marshall's traditional admissions policy, which had a lower SAT/ACT apparent requirement than his undergraduate school, Shepherd University, with a [...] "selective" [...] admissions policy and higher SAT/ACT apparent requirement. The graduate made an incorrect inference from the averages and thought Shepherd was arbitrarily turning new students away below a higher fixed ACT or SAT score. Dr. Westbrook clarified the situation first by explaining that every university or college is going to meet its enrollment quota with the best students available, and asked where both Marshall University and Shepherd University got their students. Marshall typically recruited from Cabell, Logan, Wayne, and Putnam Counties, WV, and Lawrence County, OH. Shepherd typically recruited both from West Virginia, both locally in the Eastern Panhandle and in the interior of and elsewhere in the state, and from the comparatively wealthy Maryland and Virginia suburbs surrounding Washington D.C. Dr. Westbrook made the point that SAT and ACT scores are an indirect measure of socioeconomic status. [...] County kindergarten to twelfth-grade school boards are funded by property taxes assessed on home values. [...] At nearly the end of grade school, a college-bound student takes the SAT or ACT. The difference between Shepherd University and Marshall University is that Shepherd recruited more from areas whose home values were higher, whose homeowners paid more in property taxes, whose school systems were better funded, and whose students benefitted as a result, took the SAT or ACT, some of whom applied to Shepherd University and were accepted, and attended. Colleges and universities, then, have less control over setting their ACT and SAT requirements than the graduate assumed and than most parents might imagine. [...] <b>Parents</b> <b>need</b> to understand that large scale political and economic forces such as the level of Federal employment and commensurate income around Washington, or other regional differences in living standards, have more to do setting ACT and SAT requirements than the decisions of college committees trying to enroll the best students they can under the circumstances over which they have no control.|$|E

It should be allowed to amuse itself with cheap colours almost as soon as it has sense enough to wish for them. If it merely daubs the paper with shapeless stains, the colour-box may be taken away till it knows better: but as soon as it begins painting red coats on soldiers, striped flags to ships, etc., it should have colours at command; and, without restraining its choice of subject in that imaginative and historical art, of a military tendency, which children delight in, (generally quite as valuable, by the way, as any historical art delighted in by their elders,) it should be gently led by the parents to try to draw, in such childish fashion as may be, the things it can see and likes,--birds, or butterflies, or flowers, or fruit. In later years, the indulgence of using the colour should only be granted as a reward, after it has shown care and progress in its drawings with pencil.

40|$|Objective: Parenting {{confidence}} {{with regards}} to caring for their infants is crucial for the healthy adaptation to parenthood {{and the development of}} positive parent-infant relationships. The postpartum period is a tremendous transitional time for parents, so their unique needs should be considered. This study explored <b>parenting</b> confidence and <b>needs</b> in <b>parents</b> when their newborns are discharged from hospital, and explored the best predictors of <b>parenting</b> confidence and <b>needs.</b> Methods: A cross-sectional design with a questionnaire survey was used in this study. The questionnaire included three parts: Demographic, <b>Parenting</b> <b>Needs</b> and <b>Parenting</b> Confidence Questionnaire. We survey a convenience sample of 96 parents from a postnatal ward and a neonatal intermediate care unit of the medical central hospital in Taichung, Taiwan. Findings: The mean age of the subjects was 32 years and 67. 7 % of the subjects’ education level was college or above. Approximately one half of the subjects was multiparous, vaginal delivery and had planned pregnancy. The mean gestational age and birth weight of the newborns was 37. 7 weeks and 2902 g, respectively. Parents who had a planned pregnancy (t= 2. 1, P= 0. 04) or preterm infants (t= 2. 0, P= 0. 046) and those whose infants were delivered by cesarean section (t= 2. 2, P= 0. 03) had higher <b>parenting</b> <b>needs.</b> In addition, <b>parents</b> of low birth weight infants had higher <b>parenting</b> <b>needs</b> (r=- 0. 23, P= 0. 02). Regarding parenting confidence, multipara parents perceived higher confidence than primipara parents (t= 2. 9, P= 0. 005). Needs in psychosocial support were significantly correlated with parenting confidence (r= 0. 21, P< 0. 05). The stepwise multiple regression analysis showed that parity and needs in psychosocial support predict parenting confidence of 13. 8 % variance. Conclusion: The findings of this study help care providers to identify parents with low parenting confidence at an early postpartum stage. Health care teams should provide appropriate psychosocial support and health education based on <b>parents</b> <b>needs...</b>|$|R

40|$|In this study, we {{examined}} how adolescents compare monitoring efforts {{by their parents}} to those of a "good parent" standard and assessed {{the impact of these}} comparisons on adolescent self-disclosure and risk behavior and their perceptions of their parents' monitoring knowledge. Survey responses from 519 adolescents (12 - 17 years) at baseline of a larger, longitudinal study examining parental monitoring and adolescent risk were examined. Adolescents' "good parent comparisons" differed greatly by monitoring areas (e. g., telephone use, health, money); however, between 5. 5 % and 25. 8 % of adolescents believed their <b>parents</b> <b>needed</b> to monitor their activities more than they currently were monitoring. Alternatively, between 8. 5 % and 23. 8 % of adolescents believed their <b>parents</b> <b>needed</b> to monitor their activities less often. These perceptions significantly distinguished adolescents in terms of their level of disclosure, perceived monitoring knowledge, and risk involvement. Adolescents who viewed their <b>parents</b> as <b>needing</b> to monitor more were less likely to disclose information to their parents (p<. 001), less likely to perceive their parents as having greater monitoring knowledge (p<. 001), and more likely to be involved in a risk behaviors (p<. 001) than adolescents who perceived their <b>parents</b> <b>needed</b> no change. Adolescent disclosure to a parent is a powerful predictor of adolescent risk and poor health outcomes. These findings demonstrate that adolescents' comparisons of their parents' monitoring efforts can predict differences in adolescent disclosure and future risk.
