25|$|An {{essential}} {{problem when}} considering LEED patterns is {{the existence of}} symmetrically equivalent domains. Domains may lead to diffraction patterns which have higher symmetry than the actual surface at hand. The reason is that usually the cross sectional area of the <b>primary</b> <b>electron</b> beam (~1mm²) is large compared to the average domain size {{on the surface and}} hence the LEED pattern might be a superposition of diffraction beams from domains oriented along different axes of the substrate lattice.|$|E
25|$|The shown {{images are}} {{examples}} of LEED diffraction patterns. The difference between image 1 and 2 is remarkable; where image 1 is of a clean (100) platinum-rhodium single crystal, and image 2 of the same crystal with CO adsorbed on the surface. The original surface order of the clean crystal is clearly visible in image 1, it shows a C(1x1) structure; the extra spots in image 2 are caused by the CO {{on the surface and}} are an example of a C(2x2) structure. The diffraction spots are generated by acceleration of elastically scattered electrons onto a hemispherical fluorescent screen, a retarding field analyzer. In the middle one can see the bright spot of the electron gun which generates the <b>primary</b> <b>electron</b> beam.|$|E
25|$|Nonconducting {{specimens}} may be imaged {{without coating}} using an environmental SEM (ESEM) or low-voltage mode of SEM operation. In ESEM instruments the specimen {{is placed in}} a relatively high-pressure chamber and the electron optical column is differentially pumped to keep vacuum adequately low at the electron gun. The high-pressure region around the sample in the ESEM neutralizes charge and provides an amplification of the secondary electron signal. Low-voltage SEM is typically conducted in an FEG-SEM because field emission guns (FEG) are capable of producing high <b>primary</b> <b>electron</b> brightness and small spot size even at low accelerating potentials. To prevent charging of non-conductive specimens, operating conditions must be adjusted such that the incoming beam current is equal to sum of outcoming secondary and backscattered electrons currents a condition that is more often met at accelerating voltages of 0.3–4 kV.|$|E
40|$|The {{discharge}} parameters in Hall thrusters depend strongly on {{the yield}} of {{secondary electron emission}} from channel walls. Comparative measurements of the yield of secondary electron emission at low energies of <b>primary</b> <b>electrons</b> were performed for several dielectric materials used in Hall thrusters with segmented electrodes. The measurements showed that at low energies of <b>primary</b> <b>electrons</b> the actual energetic dependencies of the total yield of secondary electron emission could differ from fits, which are usually used in theoretical models. The observed differences might be caused by electron backscattering, which is dominant at lower energies and depends strongly on surface properties. Fits based on power or linear laws are relevant at higher energies of <b>primary</b> <b>electrons,</b> where the bulk material properties play a decisive role...|$|R
50|$|The Reverse Monte Carlo {{method for}} {{electron}} transport {{takes into account}} the energy deposition due to <b>primary</b> <b>electrons</b> and secondary photons.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to producing secondary <b>electrons,</b> <b>primary</b> <b>electrons</b> from the incident beam with sufficient energy {{to penetrate the}} resist can be multiply scattered over large distances from underlying films and/or the substrate. This leads to exposure of areas at a significant distance from the desired exposure location. For thicker resist, as the <b>primary</b> <b>electrons</b> move forward, they have an increasing opportunity to scatter laterally from the beam-defined location. This scattering is called forward scattering. Sometimes the <b>primary</b> <b>electrons</b> are scattered at angles exceeding 90 degrees, i.e., they no longer advance further into the resist. These electrons are called backscattered electrons and {{have the same effect}} as long-range flare in optical projection systems. A large enough dose of backscattered electrons can lead to complete exposure of resist over an area much larger than defined by the beam spot.|$|R
25|$|Figure 4 {{shows the}} Ewald's sphere {{for the case}} of normal {{incidence}} of the <b>primary</b> <b>electron</b> beam, as {{would be the case}} in an actual LEED setup. It is apparent that the pattern observed on the fluorescent screen is a direct picture of the reciprocal lattice of the surface. The size of the Ewald's sphere and hence the number of diffraction spots on the screen is controlled by the incident electron energy. From the knowledge of the reciprocal lattice models for the real space lattice can be constructed and the surface can be characterized at least qualitatively in terms of the surface periodicity and the point group. Figure 5.a shows a model of an unreconstructed (100) face of a simple cubic crystal and the expected LEED pattern. The spots are indexed according to the values of h and k.|$|E
25|$|When the <b>primary</b> <b>electron</b> beam {{interacts with}} the sample, the {{electrons}} lose energy by repeated random scattering and absorption within a teardrop-shaped volume of the specimen known as the interaction volume, which extends from less than 100nm to approximately 5µm into the surface. The size of the interaction volume depends on the electron's landing energy, the atomic number of the specimen and the specimen's density. The energy exchange between the electron beam and the sample results in the reflection of high-energy electrons by elastic scattering, emission of secondary electrons by inelastic scattering and the emission of electromagnetic radiation, each {{of which can be}} detected by specialized detectors. The beam current absorbed by the specimen can also be detected and used to create images of the distribution of specimen current. Electronic amplifiers of various types are used to amplify the signals, which are displayed as variations in brightness on a computer monitor (or, for vintage models, on a cathode ray tube). Each pixel of computer video memory is synchronized with the position of the beam on the specimen in the microscope, and the resulting image is therefore a distribution map of the intensity of the signal being emitted from the scanned area of the specimen. In older microscopes images may be captured by photography from a high-resolution cathode ray tube, but in modern machines they are digitised and saved as digital images.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study on}} near cathode space charge region in BETA (Basic Experiments in Toroidal Assembly), a toroidal plasma device with purely toroidal magnetic field. A charge cylinder {{has been found to}} be embedded in the plasma center corresponding to the hot filament cathode location in poloidal cross section. This charge cylinder has been created by the <b>primary</b> <b>electrons</b> emitted from the filament surface, which in turn, leads to the formation of a potential well in the core plasma. We have proposed a model, which shows that a tiny fraction of injected energetic electrons is sufficient to sustain the observed potential well. We have examined the equilibrium of the charge cylinder in poloidal cross-section and found that it exhibits equilibrium configuration by forming circulation pattern of <b>primary</b> <b>electrons.</b> The circulation pattern is formed by vertical drift due to toroidal magnetic field and self-consistent poloidal E×B drift. We have concluded that the self-consistency is in adjusting the poloidal drift to the vertical drift of the trapped <b>primary</b> <b>electrons...</b>|$|R
40|$|This work simulates multipaction in a 700 MHz {{elliptical}} SRF cavity. The cavity {{design is}} optimized using SUPERFISH. Then the electromagnetic field is re-computed with FEMLAB, {{a package that}} uses the finite element method, to obtain a more accurate field-mapping, {{and to make the}} field values available for computation of multipaction. In the multipacting subroutine, electrons are assumed to be released into the system from various points with different initial parameters. The electron trajectories are tracked until they hit the cavity surface. Leap-frog scheme is used to solve the Lorentz force equation for <b>primary</b> <b>electrons,</b> as it is easy to use and is accurate up to the second order. The position, velocity, phase and kinetic energy of <b>primary</b> <b>electrons</b> at each time step are calculated and stored. An interpolation function is used to calculate secondary emission yield (SEY) at different impact energies.

By repeating this process for large number of electrons, the multipacting trajectories and field levels are identified...|$|R
2500|$|In 1950, {{with the}} aid of a cloud chamber that {{contained}} lead plates, [...] Ney, together with Charles Critchfield and graduate student Sophie Oleksa, searched for primary cosmic ray electrons.

2500|$|The {{electron}} multiplier {{consists of a}} number of electrodes called dynodes. Each dynode is held at a more positive potential, by ≈100 Volts, than the preceding one. A <b>primary</b> <b>electron</b> leaves the photocathode with the energy of the incoming photon, or about 3eV for [...] "blue" [...] photons, minus the work function of the photocathode. A small group of primary electrons is created by the arrival of a group of initial photons. (In Fig. 1, the number of primary electrons in the initial group is proportional to the energy of the incident high energy gamma ray.) [...] The primary electrons move toward the first dynode because they are accelerated by the electric field. They each arrive with ≈100eV kinetic energy imparted by the potential difference. Upon striking the first dynode, more low energy electrons are emitted, and these electrons are in turn accelerated toward the second dynode. The geometry of the dynode chain is such that a cascade occurs with an exponentially-increasing number of electrons being produced at each stage. For example, if at each stage an average of 5 new electrons are produced for each incoming electron, and if there are 12 dynode stages, then at the last stage one expects for each <b>primary</b> <b>electron</b> about 512 ≈ 108 electrons. [...] This last stage is called the anode. This large number of electrons reaching the anode results in a sharp current pulse that is easily detectable, for example on an oscilloscope, signaling the arrival of the photon(s) at the photocathode ≈50 nanoseconds earlier.|$|E
2500|$|The other pathway, non-cyclic photophosphorylation, is a {{two-stage}} process involving {{two different}} chlorophyll photosystems. Being a light reaction, non-cyclic photophosphorylation {{occurs in the}} frets or stroma lamellae. First, a water molecule is broken down into 2H+ + 1/2 O2 + 2e− by a process called photolysis (or light-splitting). The two electrons from the water molecule are kept in photosystem II, while the 2H+ and 1/2O2 are left out for further use. Then a photon is absorbed by chlorophyll pigments surrounding the reaction core center of the photosystem. The light excites the electrons of each pigment, causing a chain reaction that eventually transfers energy {{to the core of}} photosystem II, exciting the two electrons that are transferred to the <b>primary</b> <b>electron</b> acceptor, pheophytin. The deficit of electrons is replenished by taking electrons from another molecule of water. The electrons transfer from pheophytin to plastoquinone, which takes the 2e− from Pheophytin, and two H+ atoms from the stroma and forms PQH2, which later is broken into PQ, the 2e− is released to Cytochrome b6f complex and the two H+ ions are released into thylakoid lumen. The electrons then pass through the Cyt b6 and Cyt f. Then they are passed to plastocyanin, [...] providing the energy for hydrogen ions (H+) to be pumped into the thylakoid space. This creates a gradient, making H+ ions flow back into the stroma of the chloroplast, providing the energy for the regeneration of ATP.|$|E
5000|$|If a {{monochromatic}} <b>primary</b> beam of <b>electrons</b> is {{incident on}} a solid surface, {{the majority of}} incident electrons lose their energy because they interact strongly with matter, leading to plasmon excitation, electron-hole pair formation, and vibrational excitation.

Furthermore, in the present analysis, the recombination factor for hydrogen atoms at the wall surface of a vacuum vessel is treated as another plasma parameter. The most significant point is that ion species ratios depend strongly not only on plasma parameters but also on the recombination factor. The proton ratio increases with decreasing the value of the recombination factor. <b>Primary</b> <b>electrons</b> also play an important role for ion species ratios, and the presence of <b>primary</b> <b>electrons</b> causes the proton ratio to decrease...|$|R
5000|$|In the 1977s, {{scientists}} Klevanik, Klimov, Shuvalov {{performed a}} series of experiments to demonstrate that it is pheophytin and not plastoquinone {{that serves as the}} <b>primary</b> <b>electron</b> acceptor in photosystem II.

This discovery was met with fierce opposition, since many believed pheophytin to be a byproduct of chlorophyll degradation. Therefore, more experiments ensued to prove that pheophytin is indeed the <b>primary</b> <b>electron</b> acceptor of PSII, occurring between P680 and plastoquinone (Klimov, Allakhverdiev, Shuvalov).

40|$|Abstract—We {{consider}} {{the influence of}} a non-dipolar magnetic field on the gamma-ray emission from the polar regions of a radio pulsar. The pulsar is treated in a Goldreich–Julian model with a free flow of charge {{from the surface of the}} neutron star. When finding the intensity of the gamma-ray radiation of the pulsar tube, both curvature gamma-ray radiation from the <b>primary</b> <b>electrons</b> and non-resonance inverse Compton scattering of thermal photons from the polar cap on <b>primary</b> <b>electrons</b> are taken into account. When finding the height of the upper plate of the pulsar diode, we included only positrons created by the curvature radiation of <b>primary</b> <b>electrons.</b> We assumed that the polar cap is heated by the return positron current. The influence on the gamma-ray emission of variations in both the radius of curvature of the magnetic force lines and in the electric field due to the non-dipolarity of the magnetic field were taken into account. The presence of even weak non-dipolarity of the magnetic field leads to a sharp decrease in the intensity of the gamma-ray emission from the pulsar tube at energies 1 − 100 MeV, while the intensity of the inverse Compton radiation (at energies 1 − 100 GeV) varies only relatively weakly...|$|R
