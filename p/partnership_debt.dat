40|$|Abstract- This paper extends our {{understanding}} of capital structure differences across organizational form. We build on existing capital structure literature concerning <b>partnership</b> <b>debt</b> use and suggest that high business risk, in combination with general partner (GP) unlimited liability, explains cross-sectional differences in corporate and limited partnership (LP) debt levels. We find that when considered concomitantly with the tax explanation, the risk explanation is a significant factor explaining capital structure differences between LPs and corporations. Our contribution to the literature is demonstrating the combined effect of business risk and GP unlimited liability on an LP’s capital structure across multiple industry groups...|$|E

40|$|The limited {{liability}} company (LLC) is gaining popularity and may become the major {{way of doing business}} for nonpublic companies. An LLC can be viewed as: 1. a general partnership where the partners have no personal liability, 2. a limited partnership where there is no general partner, and 3. a partnership surrounded by a corporate shell. In comparing an LLC with a limited partnership, a limited partnership must have at least one general partner who has un{{limited liability}} for <b>partnership</b> <b>debts.</b> However, with an LLC, every member has limited liability. Members of LLCs can participate in management and retain their limited liability. The Wyoming LLC statute was the first statute passed in 1977.

40|$|In this Article, {{the author}} {{analyzes}} {{the reactions of}} 147 New York City law firms to the 1994 enactment of the New York Limited Liability Partnership statute, which provided New York law firm partners with the first convenient mechanism to limit their personal liability for <b>partnership</b> <b>debts.</b> Using both quantitative and qualitative evidence, she evaluates whether the behavior of New York law firms supports the signaling theory of organizational form - that is, the theory that firms use the partnership form to signal to the marketplace that they provide high quality legal services, due to either superior monitoring or to profit sharing. She concludes that the quantitative data do not strongly support either signaling theory of partnership. In addition, both theories face substantial theoretical hurdles. At the same time, interviews with law firm partners suggest that signaling concerns did impact law firm choice of form, in some cases profoundly. The author proposes three modifications to the signaling theory of organizational form that render the theory both more theoretically persuasive and more consistent with the observed behavior of law firms. First, the relevant signal appears to be negative, rather than positive. Second, this negative signal is more costly to elite firms than to non-elite firms. Third, firms may attempt to signal something other than, or in addition to, quality through their choice of organizational form - namely, status...|$|R

50|$|To {{determine}} each partner's {{economic risk}} of loss, a constructive liquidation analysis must be performed. The $100,000 note is deemed to become due. The partnership's assets become worthless and are sold for no consideration. This {{results in a}} $120,000 loss to the partnership, which is split equally between A and B. As a result of each A and B taking a $60,000 distributive share of the loss, their respective capital accounts are decreased by $60,000 from $10,000 to ($50,000). To restore these negative capital account balances to $0.00 in a deemed liquidation of their partnership interests, A and B would have to contribute $50,000 each to the partnership. Hence, each A and B bears the economic risk of loss for $50,000 of the <b>partnership's</b> recourse <b>debt.</b> A and B's outside bases, therefore, are increased by $50,000 from $10,000 when AB becomes obligated on the $100,000 note, giving each partner an outside basis of $60,000.|$|R
40|$|Where {{large-scale}} {{investments are}} needed, especially for infrastructure projects, public-private partnerships (PPPs) have been touted as an option. With encouragement {{by the international}} financial institutions, PPPs have been promoted in developing countries, especially those facing large public sector debt burdens. PPPs can be very diverse and complex. Many developing country governments lack the institutional and human resource capacity to handle the complexities of PPPs, and hence, PPPs may not yield the results promised. Complex financial contracts, involving commitments to future payments, often reduce transparency. Thus, PPPs can suffer similar problems – such as corruption, cronyism, monopolies – faced in privatization. The transfer of risks to private contractors may be partial, with the government having to step in if something goes wrong. A further consideration is to ensure equitable access for poor and low income households to maintain political support for PPPs. Even when PPP contracts take investments off government balance sheets, and thereby seemingly improve the fiscal balance, commitments to pay for future service flows and other contingent liabilities have similar economic effects to public debt. PPPs do not necessarily entail lower capital costs than investments financed by public borrowing. Public-private <b>partnership,</b> public <b>debt,</b> privatization, developing countries...|$|R
40|$|Twenty years ago, the New York Limited Liability Company Law was enacted, {{including}} § 609 (a), which explicitly disclaims {{liability of}} members, managers, and agents for the debts and obligations of the LLC. However, New York courts {{have held that}} this limitation on liability is not absolute, and certain conduct {{on the part of}} the owners can erode the liability shield. The statute provides that the members will not have personal liability for LLC debts solely because of their role as owners in the LLC. The statute does not say that members will never have liability, just that any liability will not be as a result of their owner status, leaving open the question of when members will be liable for debts of the LLC. Neither the language of § 609 (a) itself or its legislative history offer any guidance on what factors a court should use to determine whether to pierce an LLC. Since LLCs are a blend of partnerships and corporation, the relevant inquiry is to determine whether, for purposes of owner liability, an LLC is more like a corporation, with its default rule of limited liability, or more like a partnership, where partners have unlimited personal liability for all <b>partnership</b> <b>debts.</b> Unlike the Model Business Corporation Act, and the states that have adopted it, New York’s Business Corporation Law has no statutory limitation on liability equivalent to § 609. However, New York has a well-established body of case law permitting courts to disregard shareholder limited liability based on shareholder conduct. New York courts, like others across the country, began by applying corporate principals of piercing the corporate veil when evaluating claims to pierce an LLC. The complete lack of statutory guidance on the factors necessary to pierce LLCs leaves judges with tremendous discretion, resulting in some uneven and sometimes insupportable results. This Article explores the history of LLC veil piercing doctrine, starting with an exploration of the approach set out in the Revised Uniform Limited Liability Company Act RULLCA and a brief look at the approaches states take to piercing the LLC veil, with a close examination of the NYLLCA. The Article then reviews the New York case law on piercing the corporate veil and the evolution of this doctrine by state and federal courts in the context of LLCs. The Article concludes with some suggestions for refining the continuing development of the LLC piercing doctrine in New York in a thoughtful and deliberate manner so as to avoid inconsistent and arbitrary results...|$|R
2500|$|However, {{consideration}} is a doctrine deriving {{from the common}} law, and can be suspended under the principles of equity. Historically, England had two separate court systems, and the Courts of Chancery which derived their ultimate authority from the King via the Lord Chancellor, took precedence over the common law courts. So does its body of equitable principles since the systems were merged in 1875. The doctrine of promissory estoppel holds that when one person gives an assurance to another, the other relies on it {{and it would be}} inequitable to go back on the assurance, that person will be estopped from doing so: an analogue of the maxim that nobody should profit from their own wrong (nemo auditur propriam turpitudinem allegans). So in Hughes v Metropolitan Railway Co the House of Lords held that a tenant could not be ejected by the landlord for failing to keep up with his contractual repair duties because starting negotiations to sell the property gave the tacit assurance that the repair duties were suspended. And in Central London Properties Ltd v High Trees House Ltd Denning J held that a landlord would be estopped from claiming normal rent during the years of World War II because he had given an assurance that half rent could be paid till the war was done. The Court of Appeal went even further in a recent debt repayment case, Collier v P J Wright (Holdings) Ltd. Arden LJ argued that a partner who had been assured he was only liable to repay one third of the <b>partnership's</b> <b>debts,</b> rather than be jointly and severally liable for the whole, had relied on the assurance by making repayments, and it was inequitable for the finance company to later demand full repayment of the debt. Hence, promissory estoppel could circumvent the common law rule of Foakes. Promissory estoppel, however, has been thought to be incapable of raising an independent cause of action, so that one may only plead another party is estopped from enforcing their strict legal rights as a [...] "shield", but cannot bring a cause of action out of estoppel as a [...] "sword". In Australia, this rule was relaxed in Walton Stores (Interstate) Ltd v Maher, where Mr Maher was encouraged to believe he would have a contract to sell his land, and began knocking down his existing building before Walton Stores finally told him they did not wish to complete. Mr Maher got generous damages covering his loss (i.e. reliance damages, but seemingly damages for loss of expectations as if there were a contract). Yet, where an assurance concerns rights over property, a variant [...] "proprietary estoppel" [...] does allow a claimant to plead estoppel as a cause of action. So in Crabb v Arun District Council, Mr Crabbe was assured he would have the right to an access point to his land by Arun District Council, and relying on that he sold off half the property where the only existing access point was. The council was estopped from not doing what they said they would. Given the complex route of legal reasoning to reach simple solutions, it is unsurprising that a number of commentators, as well as the Principles of European Contract Law have called for simple abandonment of the doctrine of consideration, leaving the basic requirements of agreement and an intention to create legal relations. Such a move would also dispense with the need for the common law doctrine of privity.|$|R
2500|$|The close {{relation}} between the papacy and the branch declined over the years, with the decline especially pronounced after 1464, with few to no branch managers being selected to be the [...] "depositary-general", the official who was essentially the fiscal agent for the Apostolic Chamber, or the Church's treasury. Pope Sixtus IV would repudiate the Medici's control of the alum trade and also his debts to them, as well as seizing Medici property in Rome following the Pazzi Conspiracy in 1478. The Pazzi's interlocked businesses and banks had captured the alum business after the Medici were removed from it, and were supplying the depositary-general from their ranks, indicating {{that they were trying}} to follow the Medici route of initially building up their empire through papal custom. The papacy would eventually agree to repay the debts, but did so extremely slowly; so slowly that the branch manager Giovanni Tornabouni agreed to take stocks of alum instead, despite the depressed market for alum. Tornabuoni would still be in charge when 1494 came and the edifice of the Medici came crashing down. Because the branch had been doing so poorly, it owed more than it was due, so the Roman government was satisfied to allow Tornabouni to assume the rest of the <b>partnership's</b> equity and <b>debts.</b>|$|R

5000|$|The Cascade {{estate was}} {{originally}} a saw milling operation, a partnership called Macintosh and Degraves Sawmills. The mills began operation in 1825 and the brewery was founded beside {{the clean water}} of the Hobart Rivulet in 1831 by Hugh Macintosh (1776-1834) with his nephews Henry and Charles Degraves while Peter Degraves was in Hobart prison serving a five-year jail term. Until 2011 the conventional history of Cascade Brewery held that the brewery, and the other enterprises at Cascade, had been founded by Peter Degraves however research by historian Greg Jefferys for his Masters thesis showed that the major partner in the Cascade Mills and Brewery had actually been Major Hugh Macintosh and that Degraves had falsified {{the history of the}} Brewery after Macintosh's death in 1834. Macintosh was a retired East India Company Officer who emigrated from England on his ship Hope in 1824 with his brother-in-law Peter Degraves (1778-1852). Degraves was an undischarged bankrupt and convicted thief. In 1826 charges were laid against Degraves for debts incurred in England and he was taken into custody until 1832. As a result of Degraves' arrest Macintosh dissolved the partnership, paid all of the <b>partnership's</b> outstanding <b>debts</b> and took over the running of the sawmills with his two nephews as well as expanding his farming interests near New Norfolk. [...] After his release in 1832 Peter Degraves took over running and expanding the Brewery on the property owned by himself and Macintosh. Macintosh moved to his farm on the banks for the Derwent River where he pursued his interests in viticulture and Merino sheep. He also, during this period, supported Henry Savery while he wrote Australia's first novel. After Macintosh's death in December 1834 his half share of the Cascade estate passed to his son William Macintosh who lived in Madras India. Degraves offered to buy William's share but never paid his nephew and William died a pauper in 1840, still owed a small fortune by his wealthy uncle Peter Degraves After Macintosh's death Degraves continued to expand both the milling and brewing operations at the Cascade, exporting both timber and beer to mainland Australia, particularly to Victoria where the gold rush created huge demands for both timber and beer. [...] After Degraves' death the Cascade passed into the control of his eldest son Henry Degraves however Henry died two years after his father and the management of the Brewery passed to Sir James Wilson, husband of Degraves' youngest daughter Deborah Hope Degraves. It is now owned by Foster's Group. Cascade produces a range of beers, homebrew, apple cider ('Mercury Cider' brand) and non-alcoholic beverages including apple juice, blackcurrant syrup & carbonated beverages.|$|R
