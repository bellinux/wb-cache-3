25|$|One of {{the most}} courageous efforts at the SCG was John Sattler's {{performance}} in the 1970 grand final between South Sydney and the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles. In the first ten minutes of the game, South's captain Sattler had his jaw broken by a punch from Manly forward John Bucknall in an off-the-ball incident. Sattler went down but <b>pulled</b> <b>himself</b> <b>up</b> on teammate Michael Cleary, asking the winger to help him so that the other players would not know he was hurt. In an act of supreme courage Sattler played on, refusing treatment at half time and pleas from teammates {{not to take the}} field again, to lead Souths to a famous 23–12 win. It was not until well after the game that he went to hospital. The Australian side to tour Britain was selected that night and, but for his injury, Sattler would have been picked as captain.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the fore}} {{part of the}} ship dipped below the surface and the water rushed towards them, Gracie jumped with the wave, caught a handhold, and <b>pulled</b> <b>himself</b> <b>up</b> {{to the roof of}} the bridge. The {{undertow}} caused by the ship's sinking pulled Gracie down; he freed himself from the ship and rose to the surface near the overturned Collapsible [...] "B". Gracie scrambled onto the overturned lifeboat along with a few dozen other men in the water. His friend Clinch Smith disappeared; his remains were never found. In his memoir, Gracie surmises Smith became entangled with the ropes and other debris on the ship, and could not free himself.|$|E
2500|$|In 1897, Professor William Libbey from Princeton University climbed Enchanted Mesa to {{disprove}} {{the existence of}} ruins. [...] His team used a cannon to shoot a rope over {{the end of the}} butte and using a pulley <b>pulled</b> <b>himself</b> <b>up</b> in a marine life-saving chair. [...] Libbey and a newspaperman climbed to the top, spent two to three hours exploring, and returned empty-handed. Libbey announced that he had seen no ruins or artifacts, saying [...] "Romantic Indian legend can never stand the acid test of scientific investigation." [...] Self-educated archaeologist Frederick Webb Hodge did not take Libbey's word for it. On a later 1897 expedition he reported evidence of occupation. [...] Although the main ruins had been washed over the edge by centuries of thunderstorms, he found plenty of arrow points, stone tools, beads and pottery fragments lodged in crevices.|$|E
60|$|The farmer made {{an abrupt}} movement, and then seemed to <b>pull</b> <b>himself</b> <b>up,</b> and stood still.|$|R
6000|$|... "But what the--what in thunder {{does it all}} mean?" [...] {{the captain}} demanded, <b>pulling</b> <b>himself</b> <b>up</b> as he glanced towards Katharine.|$|R
60|$|This {{was also}} evidently {{perfectly}} sincere, {{but he seemed}} to <b>pull</b> <b>himself</b> <b>up</b> abruptly, and laughed in a fashion that suggested embarrassment.|$|R
60|$|In the {{meantime}} Harry secured a rope thrown by Jack Broxton and <b>pulled</b> <b>himself</b> <b>up.</b>|$|E
60|$|There was {{an awkward}} silence. Then Dan Baxter <b>pulled</b> <b>himself</b> <b>up,</b> hesitated, {{and held out his}} hand.|$|E
60|$|Harry put {{his hands}} on the {{stonework}} and <b>pulled</b> <b>himself</b> <b>up,</b> and felt the bars within the window.|$|E
60|$|Painfully {{the young}} acrobat started to <b>pull</b> <b>himself</b> <b>up</b> on the rope. The ringmaster {{glared at him}} and then cracked his whip once more, taking the young {{performer}} in the arm.|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{explains}} something," [...] Thirlwell remarked, {{and then}} <b>pulling</b> <b>himself</b> <b>up,</b> added: [...] "If you take proper appliances, a prospecting expedition costs much. But did your father often {{talk about the}} lode?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not {{much fun}} {{in talking to}} that horsey fellow. I'm sorry for him, but I can't do {{anything}} to amuse him," [...] objected Thorny, <b>pulling</b> <b>himself</b> <b>up</b> from the sofa with a great yawn.|$|R
60|$|Fergusson <b>pulled</b> <b>himself</b> <b>up</b> {{a little}} annoyed. He {{had begun to}} talk about a subject of {{peculiar}} interest to him.|$|E
60|$|The slam of {{the front}} door woke Jack, and he <b>pulled</b> <b>himself</b> <b>up,</b> declaring that he {{believed}} he had been having a nap.|$|E
6000|$|He <b>pulled</b> <b>himself</b> <b>up,</b> for Gerald's coolness was steadying. [...] "However, I must understand. What {{will happen}} when the lender finds you cannot pay?" ...|$|E
6000|$|But his kinsman was too {{launched}} to <b>pull</b> <b>himself</b> <b>up.</b> [...] "Wasn't {{it enough}} {{that you should have}} plotted against my rights? Need you have come into my very house to intrigue with my sister?" ...|$|R
60|$|When he {{is three}} {{inches off the}} bridge, he <b>pulls</b> <b>himself</b> <b>up</b> straight, and the brickwork, as the train dashes through, kills a fly that was {{trespassing}} on {{the upper part of}} his right ear.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not so drunk as you fancied him," [...] Dominey said coolly, [...] "not so {{far gone}} in his course of {{dissipation}} {{but that he}} was able to <b>pull</b> <b>himself</b> <b>up</b> when the great incentive came." ...|$|R
60|$|Blunt <b>pulled</b> <b>himself</b> <b>up</b> short, but not {{so short}} as {{not to let the}} {{confused}} murmur of the word “adorable” reach our attentive ears.|$|E
60|$|Tom swore back. He {{thrust his}} hands {{deep in his}} pockets and sank into that {{attitude}} of dejection common to drunkards. Suddenly he <b>pulled</b> <b>himself</b> <b>up.</b>|$|E
60|$|He <b>pulled</b> <b>himself</b> <b>up</b> by Jukes' coat, {{taking that}} liberty with the {{greatest}} moderation, and only {{so far as it}} was forced upon him by the hurricane.|$|E
60|$|Then it {{occurred}} to him that he was speaking more familiarly than an Englishman would probably expect a yacht-hand to do, and, <b>pulling</b> <b>himself</b> <b>up</b> abruptly, he commenced to lay out the table and pour the coffee.|$|R
50|$|Sabah Homasi {{talks to}} Steve Montgomery about Araújo's accusations days earlier and Graves' unadmitted guilt over {{drinking}} the wine. They both believe that Graves is being weak {{at the moment}} and {{that he needs to}} <b>pull</b> <b>himself</b> <b>up.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Pull-ups, when one's grip is {{wide with}} the palms {{facing away from}} the user, are also common. One {{attempts}} to <b>pull</b> <b>himself</b> <b>up</b> and touch his chest to the pull-up bar. Pull-ups strongly involve the latissimus dorsi muscle.|$|R
6000|$|For a {{time they}} talked about the voyage, and then, with a half-embarrassed smile, Chisholm <b>pulled</b> <b>himself</b> <b>up.</b> [...] "I'm forgetting. There are things I ought to ask----" ...|$|E
6000|$|He <b>pulled</b> <b>himself</b> <b>up</b> in {{the hammock}} {{to get her}} face fully in view, and asked, [...] "How {{much do you think}} I've been able to average up to this time?" ...|$|E
60|$|He <b>pulled</b> <b>himself</b> <b>up</b> abruptly, but {{the colour}} {{was in his}} cheeks, and the little thrill in his voice again, while it seemed only natural that the girl should smile prettily.|$|E
6000|$|Almost {{unconscious}} {{of what he}} was doing, {{he caught}} the log again. But he was now too weak to <b>pull</b> <b>himself</b> <b>up.</b> [...] "It's the end," [...] he thought bitterly. Then a cry came to him, a cry that seemed half real, half imaginary.|$|R
60|$|Ramsden returns, {{followed}} by Ann. They come in quickly, with their former leisurely air of decorous grief changed {{to one of}} genuine concern, and, on Ramsden's part, of worry. He comes between the two men, intending to address Octavius, but <b>pulls</b> <b>himself</b> <b>up</b> abruptly as he sees Tanner.|$|R
60|$|The species last described, ascended a {{vertical}} stick by twining spirally and by seizing it alternately with its opposite tendrils, like a sailor <b>pulling</b> <b>himself</b> <b>up</b> a rope, hand over hand; the present species pulls itself up, like a sailor seizing {{with both hands}} together a rope above his head.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Kit, rather earnestly; [...] "since it's yours, it's {{no doubt}} good." [...] Then he <b>pulled</b> <b>himself</b> <b>up</b> and {{added with a}} twinkle: [...] "But I haven't heard it yet." ...|$|E
60|$|Slowly {{and with}} downcast face Bill Dangler crawled {{from the small}} cellar and <b>pulled</b> <b>himself</b> <b>up</b> {{to the floor of}} the cabin. He gazed reproachfully at the old man, who was again trembling.|$|E
6000|$|Wanhope {{had been}} lapsing {{deeper and deeper}} into the hollow of his chair; but he now <b>pulled</b> <b>himself</b> <b>up,</b> and turned quickly toward Rulledge. [...] "What made you think of that?" [...] he asked.|$|E
60|$|This {{was hard}} work, for the shelf {{was nearly as}} high as his chin. But Tot had already learned to climb the trees at home, so he managed {{in some way to}} <b>pull</b> <b>himself</b> <b>up,</b> with the result that he lost his balance and fell head {{foremost}} inside the house.|$|R
6000|$|... 'We {{do nothing}} so useful or profitable,' sighed poor Owen, striving to <b>pull</b> <b>himself</b> <b>up</b> by the table, but desisting on finding {{that it was}} more likely to overbalance than to be a support. 'My poor boy, you will have to work for me!' and he sadly stroked down the light hair.|$|R
60|$|He clung crying to the chain, <b>pulling</b> <b>himself</b> <b>up</b> {{from the}} burning of the cone. Each missile Horrocks flung hit him. His clothes charred and glowed, and as he {{struggled}} the cone dropped, and a rush of hot suffocating gas whooped out and burned round him in a swift breath of flame.|$|R
