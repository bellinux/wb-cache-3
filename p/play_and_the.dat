5|$|As Näslund's {{free agency}} {{approached}} on 1 July 2008, Näslund {{made it clear}} that the style of <b>play</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> player personnel of a team would be important factors in determining which team he would sign with after his contract with the Canucks expired. He was admittedly frustrated with Vigneault's defensive coaching style.|$|E
5|$|Count on Mr. Welles: he doesn't {{do things}} by halves....

Mr. Welles has put upon the screen a motion picture that really moves.|$|E

5|$|Creatures of Impulse is a stage {{play by the}} English dramatist W. S. Gilbert, {{with music}} by the composer-conductor Alberto Randegger, which Gilbert adapted from his own short story. Both the <b>play</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> short story concern an {{unwanted}} and ill-tempered old fairy who enchants people to behave in a manner opposite to their natures, with farcical results.|$|E
5|$|Critics praised Vanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike as {{a humorous}} {{adaptation}} of Chekhov themes that doesn't require familiarity with Chekhov. The original Broadway production {{proved to be}} a commercial success, recouping its $2.75 million investment in under four months. In 2013, it won the Tony Award for Best <b>Play</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Play, among other awards.|$|E
5|$|For the 2007–08 season, Bayern made drastic squad {{changes to}} help rebuild. They signed {{a total of}} eight new players and sold, {{released}} or loaned out nine of their players.

5|$|Brulé {{began the}} 2009–10 {{season as the}} Oilers' fourth-line centre out of {{training}} camp. With improved <b>play</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> injury of first-line winger Ales Hemsky, Brulé moved up the Oilers' depth chart and recorded his best statistical season in the NHL. However, after suffering from a recurring flu throughout the campaign, which sidelined him for a combined 11games, he suffered a high-ankle sprain during {{a game against the}} Dallas Stars on April2,2010; following a collision with opposing forward Brian Sutherby, his skate got jammed underneath goaltender Kari Lehtonen's pad. The injury sidelined him for the remaining week of the campaign. He finished the season with a career-high 17goals, 20assists and 37points in 65games, third in team-scoring. Becoming a restricted free agent in the 2010 off-season, Brulé filed for arbitration with the Oilers after failing to come to terms on a new contract. The two sides managed to avoid their arbitration hearing by signing a two-year, $3.7million deal on July27,2010.|$|E

5|$|Despite Arsenal being {{reduced to}} 10 men, the scores {{remained}} {{level as the}} game went into its final minute, when Diego Forlán went to ground in the penalty area under a challenge from Arsenal defender Martin Keown while trying to reach a Gary Neville cross. The referee deemed this a foul and awarded a penalty. Van Nistelrooy stepped up to take the penalty, despite having missed his previous two penalties for Manchester United. Lehmann tried to put him off by moving {{from side to side}} along the goal line, and it appeared to work: the shot hit the bar and rebounded back into <b>play,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Dutchman was immediately confronted by Keown. Within a minute, the final whistle blew and the match finished as a goalless draw.|$|E
5|$|Despite Queen's Park {{entering}} the match as favourites, it was Blackburn Rovers {{who won the}} game by two goals to one with goals from Jimmy Douglas and Jimmy Forrest; Robert M Christie scored for Queen's Park. The Scottish team had a goal disallowed during <b>play,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> referee later {{said that they had}} scored once more but as the players did not attempt to claim it, he had not bothered to award it. The two teams met once more in the final of the following FA Cup final in 1885.|$|E
5|$|Florida State's post-score kickoff {{sailed through}} the end zone for a touchback, and Tech's offense began its first drive of the quarter from its 20-yard line. Tech's first play of the quarter was a 15-yard {{completed}} pass by Noel for a first down. That was followed by an 11-yard run by Jones for another first down. After an incomplete pass, Noel ran for a first down at the State 41-yard line. Inside Florida State territory, gaining ground became much more difficult. The next three plays netted Tech only nine yards, setting up a critical fourth-and-one play. With Virginia Tech outside field goal range and trailing, the Hokies needed another first down to move within potential scoring range. But on fourth down, Jones was stopped for no gain on a running <b>play,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Hokies turned the ball over on downs. The play later was cited as the game's turning point.|$|E

5|$|In 1877, McGregor {{was invited}} to become a {{committee}} member of Aston Villa, a football club formed three years earlier. He also umpired matches for the club. At the time the club played at Aston Park, close to the premises of McGregor's business. He became interested in joining Villa due to the strong Scottish contingent in the club's ranks, the team's exciting style of <b>play,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> club's connection to a Wesleyan Chapel. He quickly assumed the post of club administrator, helping the impecunious club to survive its financial troubles. After some of Aston Villa's possessions were seized by bailiffs, McGregor allowed the club to use his shop as a store to prevent further seizures. Under McGregor's leadership, Aston Villa won their first trophy, the Birmingham Senior Cup, in 1880, shortly after which McGregor became the club's president.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, few {{professional}} football games took longer than {{two and a}} half hours to <b>play,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Jets–Raiders' three-hour time slot was thought to be adequate. A high-scoring contest, together with a number of injuries and penalties for the two bitter AFL rivals, caused the game to run long. NBC executives had originally ordered that Heidi begin at 7:00p.m. ET, but decided to allow the game to air to its conclusion. However, as 7p.m. approached, NBC's switchboards were jammed by viewers phoning to inquire about the night's schedule, preventing the planned change from being communicated. Heidi began as scheduled, preempting the final moments of the game and the two Oakland touchdowns in the eastern half of the country, to the outrage of viewers.|$|E
5|$|Keen to {{strengthen}} Bolton for a European push in the 2006–07 season, Allardyce signed France international striker Nicolas Anelka from Fenerbahçe for a club record £8million. He also signed Ivory Coast defender Abdoulaye Méïté from Marseille, {{and in an}} unusual sequence of events made a £400,000 profit on Dietmar Hamann, who {{changed his mind about}} joining Bolton and signed with Manchester City a day after signing a pre-contract agreement with Bolton; Manchester City agreed to pay Bolton £400,000 in compensation. However Allardyce's relationship with chairman Phil Gartside became increasingly strained as Gartside refused to sanction greater transfer spending to finance a push for UEFA Champions League qualification. On 29 April 2007, Allardyce resigned with the club in fifth place with two games of the season left to <b>play,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> following day his assistant Sammy Lee was announced as his replacement.|$|E

5|$|Once {{the regular}} season began, Ruth was a star pitcher who was also {{dangerous}} at the plate. The team performed well, yet received almost no attention from the Baltimore press. A third major league, the Federal League, had begun <b>play,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> local franchise, the Baltimore Terrapins, restored that city to the major leagues {{for the first time}} since 1902. Few fans visited Oriole Park, where Ruth and his teammates labored in relative obscurity. Ruth may have been offered a bonus and a larger salary to jump to the Terrapins; when rumors to that effect swept Baltimore, giving Ruth the most publicity he had experienced to date, a Terrapins official denied it, stating it was their policy not to sign players under contract to Dunn.|$|E
5|$|Philadelphia {{scored the}} first runs {{of the series}} when Chase Utley {{hit a home run}} with Jayson Werth on base {{in the top of the}} first inning. Tampa Bay loaded the bases in the bottom of the third inning; however, Upton {{grounded}} into an inning-ending double <b>play</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> score remained 20. The Phillies extended their lead when Carlos Ruiz batted in Victorino in the fourth inning. A solo home run from Carl Crawford pulled the Rays back within two runs. Tampa Bay added their second run the following inning on an RBI double by Akinori Iwamura. Philadelphia starter Cole Hamels pitched seven innings and allowed only two runs, while Brad Lidge recorded his 47th consecutive save in 2008.|$|E
5|$|Tennessee's kickoff {{went out}} of bounds, {{allowing}} Tech's offense to start at its 35-yard line. DeShazo threw an incomplete pass, then completed one for a nine-yard gain. Needing one yard for a first down, Tech fullback Bryan Edwards was stopped for a loss and the Hokies were forced to punt. Tennessee fair caught the ball at their 20-yard line, where the Volunteers' offense again began to work. A five-yard penalty pushed the Volunteers backward, but running back Jay Graham regained the lost five yards with a run on the next <b>play</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> clock ran out in the quarter. At {{the end of the}} first quarter, Tennessee led, 140.|$|E
