25|$|Havel's Civic Forum party {{played a}} major role in the Velvet Revolution that toppled {{communism}} in Czechoslovakia in 1989. He assumed the presidency shortly thereafter, and was reelected in a landslide the following year and after Slovak independence in 1993. Havel was instrumental in dismantling the Warsaw Pact and expanding NATO membership eastward. Many of his stances and policies, such as his opposition to Slovak independence, condemnation of the Czechoslovak treatment of Sudeten Germans after World War II, and granting of general amnesty to all those imprisoned under communism, were very controversial domestically. As such, at the end of his presidency, he enjoyed greater popularity abroad than at home. Havel continued his life as a public intellectual after his presidency, launching several initiatives including the <b>Prague</b> <b>Declaration</b> on European Conscience and Communism, the VIZE 97 Foundation, and the Forum 2000 annual conference.|$|E

2500|$|The {{genesis of}} the ECR dates back to 2005, and {{possibly}} earlier. A political group in the European Parliament cannot be officially recognised if it contains MEPs from only a single member state. Instead, it must meet the minimum threshold required by the European Parliament's Rules of Procedure. [...] Any party seeking to create a group must therefore seek partners. The last mixed group in the European Parliament was forcibly dissolved. Since then, groups have been required to demonstrate ideological coherence. This is usually done by publishing a document (sometimes called a constituent declaration) stating the principles to which each group member is expected to adhere. The constituent declaration of the ECR {{has become known as}} the <b>Prague</b> <b>Declaration.</b> That document outlines the following principles: ...|$|E

40|$|This book {{contributes}} to the theoretical and policy debates on the existence and development of a European public sphere. It presents a critical discussion of the links between media, history and politics in Europe {{by looking at the}} re-organization of ideological and political determinants (such as Left-Right or East-West) and debating the existence of a European editorial culture. The volume also examines how international crises have been debated in national media in Europe throughout the post war period. It looks empirically at the national media coverage of eight crisis events: the 1956 revolution in Budapest, the building of the Berlin Wall in 1961, the May 1968 youth revolt in Paris, the events of August 1968 in <b>Prague,</b> the <b>declaration</b> of a state of war in Poland in 1981, the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the outbreak of the Second Gulf War in 2003 and the Mohammed cartoons crisis in 2006...|$|R

A <b>declaration</b> {{was presented to the}} Presidium condemning the media as co-conspirators against the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact in their support of Dubcek’s liberalization measures. Finally, on 2 April 1969, the government adopted measures [...] "to secure peace and order" [...] through even stricter censorship, forcing the people of Czechoslovakia to wait until the thawing of Eastern Europe for the return of a free media.|$|R
5000|$|The Prague Process {{originated}} from the EU financed project [...] "Building Migration Partnerships", and was initiated during the Czech EU Presidency with {{the signature of}} the <b>Prague</b> Process Joint <b>Declaration</b> at the Ministerial Conference in April 2009.

40|$|In December 2007 {{the most}} {{successful}} and comprehensive international conventional arms control agreement, the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE), lost the support of its most relevant party – Russia. Moscow’s unilateral decision to suspend the treaty did not actually {{come as a surprise}} but merely marked the nadir of negative development that {{can be traced back to}} the 1999 Istanbul OSCE Summit where Russia agreed to withdraw its armed forces from independent Moldova and Georgia. Right up until today NATO States still refuse to ratify the Adapted CFE Treaty (ACFE), which was signed in Istanbul, because of Russia’s failure to fully withdraw its forces. Since NATO’s 2002 <b>Prague</b> Summit <b>Declaration</b> these so-called Istanbul Commitments of Russia are the sole justification for the Alliance not moving further in adapting the Cold War-style CFE Treaty to the current European security landscape. The present CORE Working Paper aims at highlighting the origins of the Istanbul Commitments in the U. S. Congress debate of the early and mid-nineties as well as their links to geostrategic and economic interests, structural anti-Russian and anti-arms control resentments within the Republican Party, and a deep mistrust between Capitol Hill and the Clinton Administration around handling NATO enlargement and Russia. The paper will not debate the question of Russia’s policy on the so-called near abroad. To overcome the current deadlock, however, harking back might be helpful in reminding possible future negotiators of the dangers of taking arms control ‘hostage’ to national agendas, which are to some degree confrontational...|$|R

There were isolated critiques of the <b>Prague</b> <b>Declaration</b> in 2009 by (in chronological order of appearance in print): Dovid Katz, formerly professor of Yiddish at Vilnius University, who founded the web journal Defending History in part to oppose the Prague Declaration; Israeli activist Efraim Zuroff, director of the Simon Wiesenthal Center's Israel office; British MP John Mann, who called it a [...] "sinister document", Anti-German political scientist Clemens Heni, and others. The <b>Prague</b> <b>Declaration</b> was also criticised by eurosceptic John Laughland, who has instead compared the EU to Nazism.

[...] In Zuroff's words, the <b>Prague</b> <b>Declaration</b> ...seeks {{recognition}} of the canard that the crimes of Communism are equivalent {{to those of the}} Nazis and calls for the rewriting of all European history textbooks in that spirit. Dovid Katz calls the argument contained in the <b>Prague</b> <b>Declaration</b> [...] "Holocaust obfuscation", which he defines as a form of Holocaust denial that, rather than denying the existence of the Holocaust, seeks to diminish its significance by equating it with crimes of smaller magnitude. Zuroff sees Holocaust obfuscation as even more insidious than outright Holocaust denial, which he points out, was always a fringe phenomenon that never permeated mainstream European society.|$|E
