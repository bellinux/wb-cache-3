40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the establishment of}} a framework for researching children’s decision-making skills in design and technology education through taking a grounded theory approach. Three data sources were used: (1) analysis of available literature; (2) curriculum analysis and interviews with teachers concerning their practice in relation to their respective national curricula; and (3) a study of classroom activity in order to gather children’s ’ perspectives. These three data sources provided triangulation, as well as supporting the validation of the data obtained. The main areas of interest for the literature search were children’s decision-making strategies, the implementation of decision-making in educational contexts and the roles of teachers and curriculum materials in the development of children’s decision-making skills. In this paper the key outcomes of this literature search are presented. Teachers in Cyprus, England and Iceland, were interviewed concerning their practice and the results of these interviews are presented. The exploratory study was conducted in a Cypriot classroom and the results found in this context are noted and compared with the literature sources and interview outcomes. The resulting framework illustrates the possible factors that affect children’s decision-making skills within design and technology education and is designed to be used in a subsequent research investigation using these possible factors as <b>preset</b> <b>codes.</b> Key words decision-making, design decisions, grounded theory, research framework. 1...|$|E

Error Correcting Output Coding (ECOC) is a multiclass {{classification}} technique, {{in which}} multiple base classifiers (dichotomizers) are trained using subsets {{of the training}} data, determined by a <b>preset</b> <b>code</b> matrix. While {{it is one of}} the best solutions to multiclass problems, ECOC is suboptimal, as the code matrix and the base classifiers are not learned simultaneously. In this paper, we show an iterative update algorithm that reduces this decoupling. We compare the algorithm with the standard ECOC approach, using Neural Networks (NNs) as the base classifiers, and show that it improves the accuracy for some well-known data sets under different settings. ...|$|R

A {{new kind of}} CSD <b>coded</b> <b>preset</b> equalizer is introduced according to the characteristic of HART channel distortion. Synchronization is divided into initialization stage and tracking stage.

50|$|The {{second stage}} of the {{wireless}} garage door opener system dealt with the shared frequency problem. To rectify this, multicode systems were developed. These systems required a garage door owner to <b>preset</b> a digital <b>code</b> by switching eight to twelve DIP switches on the receiver and transmitter. While these switches provided garage door systems with 28 = 256 to 212 = 4,096 different codes, they were not designed with high security in mind; the main intent was to avoid interference with similar systems nearby. Criminals were able to defeat the basic security of this system by trying different codes on a regular transmitter. They could also make code grabbers to record and re-transmit a signal, or code scanners, that would attempt every possible combination in a short time. Multicode openers became unpopular in areas where security was an issue, but due to their ease of programming, such openers are often used to operate {{such things as the}} gates in gated apartment complexes.|$|R
40|$|The Accounting Ethics {{is mainly}} {{introduced}} {{as if it}} were a small part of the business ethics in both domestic and foreignliteratures. In this case, the subject of accounting ethics naturally turns up to be a workspace governed by the ones whose subjectis not accounting. Nevertheless, the predominantly existence of the profit-based approaches in the business ethics and principlebasedapproaches in the accounting ethics is the contradiction of these studies. The most concrete evidence of these conflictingsituations is the Corporate Governance Principles, which is developed by CMB in Turkey, in which its content the accountant andethics is hardly existed, instead of the concept used as “Organization’s Code of Ethics” in the global applications. Theimportance of corporate accounting ethics education is primarily administered in the corporate educational institutions(university) and the learned vocational ethics habits are administrated in corporate in the governmental and private publicorganizations. That the organizations are deprived of ethics supporting systems will most probably make the ethical benefits tobe provided in the ethics education applications bootless. The accounting methodology which is the social and economical measuring system, the measuring instruments they haveused, methods and the reason for existence of the procedures realizes the ethical integrity. While the accounting carries out thesemeasurements, it depicts the financial facts, defines, classifies and describes its evaluation. Controls and auditing are availablealready at every stage of all these processes and procedures in principle of accounting essence. Therefore, it uses the accountingconcept and principles in defining the financial facts during the evaluation process, adapts these principles to legal rules and otherrules and selects the most convenient ones among the <b>preset</b> law <b>code</b> articles in describing the facts. When there are no lawcodes and rules existed, it develops its own rule/ruling systems according to the ethical overall acceptations or to be accepted asgeneral. He is the one who can perceive this function in linking the accounting system parts to each other is the account himself. Sustaining the accountant with the systems to provide ethical support in processing this function will turn the accounting and theaccountant to a position to render technical service intended for the objectives of the administration. It makes necessary to make a declaration against momentarily developing ethic / non-ethic application or behaviors in classesand encourage the ethical behaviors and impose sanctions to the non-ethical behaviors. However, the quality of the sanction to beapplied should be in such an attribution that it will provide a support to the student himself/herself to perceive that value of thestudent’s non-ethical behaviors in insinuation – which value parameters are violated - so that the student should not be penalizedin a non-ethical method. The Corporate Application out of exams: If the school rendering education is of an adapted official ethic education policy,then the policies of accounting ethic education should be arranged and implemented accordingly. If they have no such corporateeducation policies, an accounting ethic education programs should be prepared according to the overall principles of ethic valuesystem. Furthermore, the students should be encouraged to do ethic discussion among themselves in the out of class areas. ExamApplications: The objective to do testing is not only to test what the student knows or does not know and grade them, but alsodescribes the testing whether the student is gained target behaviors and information suitable to the education objectives. Thequality of the prepared questions should be distributed at the attribution to cover the ethic education targets and the targeteducation scope. During the execution of the testing, some of the students who cannot assign a meaning to the questions demand themeanings of the questions from the instructors of the lessons or the persons charged in the exams. Moreover, some of theinstructors come into the examination halls and openly ask if there are any questions which are not understood and give clues tothe student to make the questions clear. This sort of applications will damage the justice feeling not only avoiding the academic equitation in education, but leading the exams to divert from their objectives of being a competition and fair measuring andevaluation as well. Furthermore, they decrease the quality of the education significantly by causing to educate the students whocannot assign a meaning to answer the question and cannot make a choice among what they know. First of all, accounting ethiceducation encourages to make a choice and lets the decision maker act independently in this choice. While doing the evaluation of the student’s exam paper, the question that the student has answered without knowing shouldbe subjected to sanctioning and points should be downed out of the right answers within a certain percentage. This situation willbe able to push the student to make a research to what he/she does not know avoiding him/her to answer about the fields whathe/she does not know and provide a contribution to gain ethical behaviors. Unless the ethical behaviors are not supported with ethic control and auditing mechanisms, it will not go further than that ofbeing subjective applications. Righteous analyzing of the functional corporal mediums and developing control means and auditingprocedures congenial to these are required to remove the subjective applications and encourage the ethic behaviors. Not only thecontrol of the education targets and convenience testing of the course contents should be controlled with the accounting ethiceducation procedures, but also constantly controlled and audited whether it is developed as the part of the student’s personality(ethical perceiving sensation) or not with the behaviors of the student...|$|R

HART PSK physical layer (PHL) introduces C 8 PSK modulation on the basis of the existing FSK modulation, and can provide 8 - 10 faster digital communication rates than the existing HART. C 8 PSK signal is a more much complex modulated and can be distorted by the channel, while HART has strict requirement on low power. HART PSK MODEM has never been applied in practice. Base on the channel characteristics, we focus our attention on receiver part of the HART PSK PHL circuits and study key module algorithms in the reeiver to achieve low power and high performance requirements. The main contents and innovation points of this paper are as follows: 1. We conclude the key technologies involved in high performance and low power circuit design for HART PSK PHL, and related research achievements are introduced. We discuss the optimal reception criteria, the structure of the optimal receiver, and the algorithm characteristics of the related modules. 2. We develop theoretical transmission model and sectioned circuits simplified model of HART PSK channel. Simulations and the test data show consistency and accuracy of the two models. Using the channel models simulations, we study the frequency response, impulse response and relationships between the amplitude –frequency response and the phase-frequency response. The main noises in the channel and their characteristics are analyzed; their combination algorithms and consolidated characteristic are introduced. 3. Sychronzation is a key problem for C 8 PSK demodulation, and ordinary algorithms are difficult to meet the low power and fast convergence requirements. Two step, acquisition and tracking, are proposed for C 8 PSK Sychronzation. New algorithms and control strategies are put forward to improve the precision and speed of the synchronization system. For acquisition, fast data-aided (DA) algorithms are put forward, using addition window to make synchronizer stable fast, then their extended algorithms are presented based on their essence analysis. For tracking, we research 2 oversample rate decisions directed (DD) algorithms, using self-noise compensation to improve the precision of the parameters’ estimation. At the time low data rate of the DD algorithms decrease the equalizer operating frequency, reduing its power greatly. In carrier compensation, based on 8 quadrants judgment and fractional phase linearity approximation, we modify ordinary CORDIC algorithm, halving the iterative calculation while maintain the same precision; we analyze the big delay involved in the DPLL, and we propose a control strategy that based on sampling control theory to conquer the loop big delay. In timing compensation, an adaptive one order Kalman filter algorithm is put forward to conquer the noise and delay of the timing loop. 4. Adaptive receiveing modules, such as channel estimation and equalization, are high power consuming, multifunction module and new structure equalizer are proposed to improve profermance and low power. We study joint time-frequency analysis algorithm for HART PSK preambles signal, and deduce its optimal MMSE low pass filtering strategy to make time-frequency analysis converge fast and jitter little in stable state. Based on the time-frequency analysis and channel characteristics, a simple joint algorithm for channel estimation, automatic modulation classification (AMC) and AGC is proposed. Based on channel characteristics, AMC, and channel estimation, we propose a CSD <b>coded</b> <b>preset</b> fractional equalizer, reducing to power consumption greatly per one equalizing computation. 5.
