5|$|Finally, at the 30 Rock studios, after overhearing Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) impersonating Elmo from Sesame Street while <b>Pete</b> <b>was</b> {{encouraging}} {{his son to}} {{do better}} with his potty training, Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) compares Pete's relationship with his wife to that of Samson and Delilah. While working late at night in his office, Tracy enters with Grizz (Grizz Chapman) and Dot Com (Kevin Brown) {{and a couple of}} other people, which turns into a party. Pete is still working, while Tracy's entourage enjoy themselves. Tracy encourages Pete to loosen up, and asks one of the women, Vicki (April Lee Hernández), to look after him.

5|$|<b>Pete</b> <b>was</b> {{studying}} at the Collegiate Grammar School {{when he decided}} he wanted to be in a music group, so Mona bought him a drum kit from Blackler's music store and Best formed his own band; The Black Jacks. Chas Newby joined the group, as did Ken Brown, but only after he had left The Quarrymen. The reason for Brown's exit from the group was that he turned up on the seventh Saturday night of The Quarrymen residency at The Casbah with the flu, so Mona ordered him upstairs to the Best's living room to rest. This caused a massive quarrel {{with the rest of the}} group when Mona came to pay them, as they wanted Brown's money to be shared amongst the three of them, as Brown had not played. Mona refused, so The Quarrymen angrily cancelled their residency and stormed out. Colin Manley from The Remo Four was also given a booking to play in the club, which was the only venue that young amateur bands could play at the time. Other groups like The Searchers and Gerry & The Pacemakers later played in the club. The Black Jacks became the resident group at The Casbah, although The Quarrymen occasionally played there again and often visited. It was in The Casbah Club that Lennon and McCartney convinced Sutcliffe to buy a Hofner president bass guitar and join The Quarrymen.|$|E

The Wilson family settled in St. Louis, Missouri when <b>Pete</b> <b>was</b> in elementary school. He then attended the private, non-sectarian preparatory middle school John Burroughs (grades 7–9) in Ladue, and then St. Louis Country Day School, an exclusive private high school, where he won an award in his senior year for combined scholarship, athletics, and citizenship. In the fall of 1951, Pete Wilson enrolled at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, where he received a United States Navy Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) scholarship, majored in English, and earned his Bachelor of Arts degree. In his junior year he elected to join the Marine Corps upon his graduation.|$|E
25|$|Pete schooled {{with his}} {{neighbour}} and friend, Den Watts (Leslie Grantham); they remained close in adulthood. In his mid-teens, Pete had {{a one-night stand}} with prostitute Pat Harris (Pam St. Clement) who informed Pete she was pregnant. Pete did the chivalrous thing and married Pat when he was 16; however it transpired that the pregnancy was a false alarm and Lou always {{felt that it was}} a ploy to trap her son. During the marriage, Pat gave birth to two sons, David (Michael French) and Simon (Nick Berry), the latter of whom Pete believed to be his. Yet Pat could not settle down. She had various affairs, including a tryst with her former lover Frank Butcher (Mike Reid), a one-night stand with Den, and an affair with Pete's older brother Kenny (Michael Attwell). Lou found Pat and Kenny in bed together and banished Kenny abroad, but <b>Pete</b> <b>was</b> unaware of the affair. Pat was also having an affair with another man named Brian Wicks (Leslie Schofield). When Pete found out he left Pat - she was six months pregnant with Simon at the time - and then went into a relationship with local girl, Kathy Hills (Gillian Taylforth). There was a messy divorce and soon after, Pat married Brian and he took on responsibility of her two sons. Pete had little contact with his children following this.|$|E
25|$|For {{the purpose}} of writing The Manxman Caine rented Greeba Castle for six months, a {{castellated}} house in the Isle of Man overlooking the Douglas to Peel road. It was this book, published as one volume in August 1894 by Heinemann, that ended the outdated system of three-volume novels. It {{is the story of}} Pete, a fisherman, considered by Kate’s father as too poor to marry her. Pete leaves to make his fortune, and is reported dead. Kate falls in love with Philip, Pete’s cousin and friend. Pete returns, creating a dilemma. The character of <b>Pete</b> <b>was</b> based on the Peel fishermen Caine mixed with and Joseph Mylchreest, a Manxman who made his fortune diamond mining in South Africa. Caine took full advantage of the subsequent Press attention. He was photographed and interviewed for the monthly magazines. The British sales of The Manxman totalled nearly 400,000. It was translated into twelve languages, selling over half a million copies by 1913. While in London in June and July 1984, Caine wrote a dramatic version of The Manxman, with Philip as the main character. Caine offered it to Herbert Beerbohm Tree, who refused it as being unlikely to appeal to the Haymarket Theatre audiences. On 22 August 1894, three weeks after the book was published, Wilson Barrett’s adaptation opened at the Grand Theatre, Leeds. Caine bought the Greeba Castle estate in 1896 with part of his earnings from The Manxman.|$|E

25|$|Charles and Constance {{divorced}} when <b>Pete</b> <b>was</b> seven, and in 1932 Charles married his composition student and assistant, Ruth Crawford, now {{considered by many}} to be one of the most important modernist composers of the 20th century. Deeply interested in folk music, Ruth had contributed musical arrangements to Carl Sandburg's extremely influential folk song anthology the American Songbag (1927) and later created significant original settings for eight of Sandburg's poems. Pete's eldest brother, Charles Seeger III, was a radio astronomer, and his next older brother, John Seeger, taught in the 1950s at the Dalton School in Manhattan and was the principal from 1960 to 1976 at Fieldston Lower School in the Bronx. Pete's uncle, Alan Seeger, a noted poet ("I Have a Rendezvous with Death"), had been one of the first American soldiers to be killed in World War I. All four of Pete's half-siblings from his father's second marriage – Margaret (Peggy), Mike, Barbara, and Penelope (Penny) – became folk singers. Peggy Seeger, a well-known performer in her own right, married British folk singer and activist Ewan MacColl. Mike Seeger was a founder of the New Lost City Ramblers, one of whose members, John Cohen, married Pete's half-sister Penny – also a talented singer who died young. Barbara Seeger joined her siblings in recording folk songs for children. In 1935, Pete attended Camp Rising Sun, an international leadership camp held every summer in upstate New York that influenced his life's work. He visited it most recently in 2012.|$|E

500|$|Though Tim and <b>Pete</b> <b>was</b> {{his most}} {{controversial}} work, Boy Wonder {{is generally considered}} his magnum opus, and remains his most popular book.

Though it has been praised as [...] "one of the few novels from the last couple of decades that could justifiably be called a classic", reviewers have also pointed out that it is probably unfilmable due to its bitter cynicism regarding the movie industry.|$|E
500|$|Davies and Cornell {{debated whether}} {{it should have been}} Rose's plan all along to save her father; this is left {{ambiguous}} in the episode. Billie Piper felt that it did not occur to Rose until after she began travelling. In the original script, in the scene where the Doctor opens the TARDIS doors and discovers only a police box interior, the police box fell apart. This was changed for reasons of cost, and Cornell has stated that he thinks the change is an improvement. Cornell also states that the character of Pete Tyler is based on his own father, who attempted many different jobs and schemes (including, like Pete, selling health drinks) before eventually finding success running a betting shop. Pete's line [...] "I'm your dad, it's my job for it to be my fault" [...] is taken from something Cornell's father once said to him. Originally <b>Pete</b> <b>was</b> to take a swig of wine before sacrificing himself, but this was removed because a correlation between alcohol and bravery was not thought to be a positive message.|$|E
500|$|Paul McCartney finally stated, in his Wingspan {{documentary}} in May 2001, {{that the}} sacking of Pete Best {{had nothing to}} do with his ability as a drummer.

So he 'left' the band and we were looking for someone who would fit." [...] He told Mark Lewisohn, similarly, that when George Martin suggested [...] "changing their drummer" [...] the Beatles responded: [...] "Well, we're quite happy with him, he works great in the clubs," [...] but also that [...] "Pete had never quite been like the rest of us. We were the wacky trio and <b>Pete</b> <b>was</b> perhaps a little more sensible; he was slightly different from us, he wasn't quite as artsy as we were." ...|$|E
