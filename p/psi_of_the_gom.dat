By doing so, they gave birth to an informal regime for <b>the</b> Gulf <b>of</b> Maine (<b>GoM)</b> (i. e. <b>the</b> Gulf <b>of</b> Maine Council on the Marine Environment), which to date has withstood <b>the</b> test <b>of</b> time. <b>GoM</b> regime participants undertake transboundary cooperation on <b>the</b> basis <b>of</b> shared ecosystem goals and objectives, as well as through <b>the</b> implementation <b>of</b> quinquennial Action Plans. In doing so, regime participants have effectively cooperated on <b>the</b> basis <b>of</b> a generally informal framework consisting of soft principles, understandings, and processes reflecting their mutual expectations in the regime’s issue areas. <b>The</b> <b>GoM</b> regime has been <b>the</b> subject <b>of</b> several scholarly reviews in recent years. Chircop et al. noted that <b>the</b> <b>GoM</b> regime: may be viewed as novel in at least three ways. First, the Agreement and Action Plan represent the first attempt to develop a broad regional marine environmental protection regime in North America.... Second, the Agreement is a provincial and state initiative, not a bilateral treaty between two sovereign nations. The Agreement, signed by the governors and premiers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> jurisdictions concerned, is neither a diplomatic instrument, nor a formal document. It is, essentially, a non-binding, multilateral, political agreement and therefore the impetus to cooperate is moral, rather than as a result of any legal obligation or commitment. This is in contrast to most regional marine environmental arrangements... which involve countries, such as the 13 Regional Seas Programmes facilitated by the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) and the regional agreements for the Baltic and North-East Atlantic. Third, the Agreement and Action Plan are not limited in coverage to marine waters but adopt an ecosystem approach covering coastal areas and watersheds in the region. The Agreement explicitly provides for consideration of “the shoreline, seabed, waters and associated natural resources <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>GoM</b> region, including Georges Bank and <b>the</b> Bay <b>of</b> Fundy. ” <b>The</b> <b>GoM</b> regime has persisted for two decades and has grown to address increasingly more issues. It has evolved to respond to a changing biophysical and socio-economic operating environment in a different manner from other regional environmental regimes, and continues to do so with <b>the</b> release <b>of</b> its fourth and latest Action Plan for the period 2007 - 2012. Against this backdrop, this Article is an assessment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>GoM</b> regime, and further builds on the literature on the subject.

40|$|AbstractThe Loop Current and its shed eddies {{dominate}} the circulation and dynamics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gulf <b>of</b> Mexico (<b>GoM)</b> basin. Those eddies are strongly energetic and are <b>the</b> cause <b>of</b> intense currents that may penetrate several hundred meters deep. However, there are regions in <b>the</b> <b>GoM</b> and periods <b>of</b> {{time in which}} the local atmospheric forcing {{plays an important role}} in its dynamics and thermodynamics. The circulation on the shelves, and particularly on the inner shelf, is mainly wind-driven with seasonality, changing direction during the year with periods of favorable upwelling/downwelling conditions. The wind-driven circulation is associated with <b>the</b> transport <b>of</b> waters with different temperature and salinity characteristics from one region to another. <b>The</b> interannual variability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> circulation on the shelves is linked to the atmospheric variability. Intraseasonal variability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wind patterns considerably affects the likelihood and magnitude of upwelling and downwelling. <b>The</b> geometry <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>GoM</b> is such that large-scale winds may drive opposing upcoast/downcoast currents along different parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> curving coast, resulting in convergence or divergence zones. <b>The</b> width <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shelves in <b>the</b> <b>GoM</b> is variable;while <b>the</b> West Florida Shelf, the Texas-Louisiana shelf and the Campeche Bank are more than 200 km wide, they are narrower near Veracruz and Tabasco.

During autumn-winter (from September to April), <b>the</b> <b>GoM</b> is affected by cold fronts coming from the northwest United States, which are associated with strong, dry, and cold winds that mix its waters and generate large sensible and latent heat fluxes from the ocean to the atmosphere.

40|$|Variability in <b>the</b> {{circulation}} <b>of</b> coastal oceans must {{ultimately be}} driven by changes in the meteorological conditions that force currents in the coastal ocean, and by variability in the waters entering the coastal ocean from elsewhere.

Thus, some method <b>of</b> comparing <b>the</b> relative importance <b>of</b> various sources of circulation variability must be developed, {{so that there is}} confidence that the most important sources of variability are included in any analysis or modeling.

It is found that the variability forced by fluctuations in the winds and <b>the</b> volume <b>of</b> water entering from the Scotian Shelf to <b>the</b> <b>GoM</b> produce roughly comparable amounts of circulation variability. However, changes in <b>the</b> density structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>GoM</b> produce changes in time-integrated transport that are an order of magnitude larger, at least in <b>the</b> central <b>GoM.</b> <b>The</b> changes in the large-scale density gradients are governed by mixing processes in the Gulf and by changes in the water masses entering <b>the</b> <b>GoM</b> from <b>the</b> Scotian Shelf and the Northeast Channel.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} addresses large-scale {{trends in}} composition, density, taxonomic and functional diversity in deep-sea benthic polychaete communities in <b>the</b> Gulf <b>of</b> Mexico (<b>GoM).</b> <b>The</b> study includes samples from two major sampling programs: <b>the</b> Deep Gulf <b>of</b> Mexico Benthos (DGoMB) program (2000 ? 2002) (51 stations, 200 - 3700 m) and the SIGSBEE program (Universidad Nacional Aut?noma de M?xico), 2008 - 2010 (27 stations on the Sigsbee Abyssal Plain). Polychaete density decreased exponentially with depth. Alpha diversity {{did not show}} a mid-depth maximum and reached its peak near the Mississippi trough. Feeding guild diversity was also highest in the Mississippi trough. The environmental parameters that determine diversity and density of polychaete assemblages and species distribution ranges were examined. Depth, export flux of particulate organic carbon (POC), percent sand and silt were <b>the</b> best predictors <b>of</b> heterogeneity <b>of</b> polychaetes in <b>the</b> <b>GoM.</b> We performed an ecological niche modeling analysis (ENM) based on ?presence-only? data of four cosmopolitan species belonging to the Cirratulidae and Spionidae in <b>the</b> <b>GoM.</b> <b>The</b> <b>GoM,</b> being a semi-enclosed ocean basin, offers complex topographic features and hydrographic processes. Comparisons <b>of</b> <b>the</b> overall polychaete diversity and richness patterns from this study for this region indicate a strong geographic variation with increasing depth and distance from the shore. Additionally, the environmental gradients observed {{play a major role}} in shaping <b>the</b> spatial distribution <b>of</b> polychaete communities in this region...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAt {{least six}} morphospecies of vestimentiferan tubeworms are {{associated}} with cold seeps in <b>the</b> Gulf <b>of</b> Mexico (<b>GOM).</b> <b>The</b> physiology and ecology <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two best-studied species from depths above 1000 m in the upper Louisiana slope (Lamellibrachia luymesi and Seepiophila jonesi) are relatively well understood. <b>The</b> biology <b>of</b> one rare species from the upper slope (escarpiid sp. nov.) and three morphospecies found at greater depths in <b>the</b> <b>GOM</b> (Lamellibrachia sp. 1, L sp. 2, and Escarpia laminata) are not as well understood. Here we address species distributions and boundaries of cold-seep tubeworms using phylogenetic hypotheses based on two mitochondrial genes. Fragments <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mitochondrial large ribosomal subunit rDNA (16 S) and cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) genes were sequenced for 167 vestimentiferans collected from <b>the</b> <b>GOM</b> and analyzed in <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> other seep vestimentiferans for which sequence data were available. The analysis supported five monophyletic clades <b>of</b> vestimentiferans in <b>the</b> <b>GOM.</b> Intra-clade variation in both genes was very low, {{and there was no}} apparent correlation between the within-clade diversity and collection depth or location. Two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> morphospecies <b>of</b> Lamellibrachia from different depths in <b>the</b> <b>GOM</b> could not be distinguished by either mitochondrial gene. Similarly, E. laminata could not be distinguished from other described species of Escarpia from either <b>the</b> west coast <b>of</b> Africa or <b>the</b> eastern Pacific using COI. We suggest that the mitochondrial COI and 16 S genes have little utility as barcoding markers for seep vestimentiferan tubeworms. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Traditional {{road safety}} {{engineering}} work involves implementing relevant remedial measures at high accident locations. A {{new approach to}} road safety management is based on safety reviews of existing roads. Road safety review is aimed at identifying and solving risk factors, by trying to investigate how the road environment is perceived, and ultimately utilized by different road users. This approach overcomes the problems arising from poor quantity and quality <b>of</b> accident data. <b>The</b> paper describes <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> a Potential for Safety Improvement index that looks at factors impacting road safety and takes into account how safety measures can reduce accident frequency and severity. The methodology is based on safety reviews of existing roads. One consequence is that preliminary data are not needed. It allows Potential for Safety Improvement index calculation to be a flexible procedure, adoptable by every road agency. Moreover, safety reviews are spreading in many highways agencies {{around the world and}} the PSI index complements the review results in order to rank either the reviewed segments and the safety issues. Different PSI indexes are computed: the overall <b>PSI,</b> <b>the</b> <b>PSI</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> selected safety features and <b>the</b> <b>PSI</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> safety items, which are the characteristics that contribute to <b>the</b> global effect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> features. The specific indexes allow to point out safety concerns where improvements may be cost effective; the overall index provides a measure of potential for safety improvement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> road segments...|$|R

40|$|Manuscript {{submitted}} on the 26 / 09 / 2007) High-resolution {{models can}} reproduce mesoscale dynamics and {{the variability in}} <b>the</b> Gulf <b>of</b> Mexico (<b>GOM),</b> but cannot provide accurate locations of currents without data assimilation (DA). We use the computationally cheap Ensemble Optimal Inter-polation (EnOI) {{in conjunction with the}} HYCOM model for assimilating altimetry data. The covariance matrix extracted from a historical ensemble, is 3 -dimensional and multivariate. This study shows that the multivariate correlations with Sea Level Anomaly are coherent with <b>the</b> known dynamics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> area at two locations: <b>the</b> cen-tral part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>GOM,</b> and <b>the</b> upper slope <b>of</b> <b>the</b> northern shelf. The correlations in the first location are suitable for an eddy forecasting system, but the correlations in the second location show some limitations due to seasonal variability. The multivariate relationships between variables are reasonably linear, as assumed by the EnOI. Our DA set-up produces little noise that is dampened within two days, when the model is pulled strongly towards observations. Part of it is caused by density perturbations in the isopycnal layers, or artificial caballing. The DA system is demonstrated for a realistic case of Loop Current eddy shedding, namely Eddy Yankee (2006). ...|$|R
