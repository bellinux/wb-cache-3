Here a disk triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) with segmental structures is introduced as power source to achieve a special cathodic protection effect for steels. The output transferred charges and short-circuit current density of the TENG achieve 1. 41 mC/min and 10. 1 mA/m 2, respectively, when the rotating speed is 1000 revolutions per minute (rpm). The cathodic <b>protection</b> <b>potential,</b> Tafel polarization curves and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) measurements are measured to evaluate the corrosion protection effect for the 403 stainless steel (403 SS). The cathodic <b>protection</b> <b>potential</b> range from - 320 mV to - 5320 mV is achieved by changing rotation speeds and external resistance when the steel is coupled in a 0. 5 m NaCl solution to the negative pole of the disk TENG. The corrosion tests results indicate that the TENG can produce 59. 1 % degree of protection for Q 235 steels in 0. 5 m NaCl solution. Furthermore, an application of marine corrosion prevention is presented by mounting the TENG onto a buoy.
