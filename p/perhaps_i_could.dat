500|$|Afterwards, Lennox {{developed}} The SING Campaign which {{aimed to}} raise funds and awareness for issues surrounding HIV/AIDS. She also wrote on her official website that the song is about raising money and awareness for what she considers to be an HIV/AIDS genocide. Citing Mandela's speech in which he said, [...] "Let us use the universal language of music, to sing out our message around the world", Lennox wanted [...] "Sing" [...] to be an anthem and symbol of unity and empowerment, to help spread awareness in the world. [...] "Because the incidence of HIV AIDS {{is on the rise}} for women, especially in the pandemic across the whole of the African continent, I thought <b>perhaps</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> be of benefit by writing a song and empowering those women who do not have an international voice," [...] the singer clarified.|$|E
60|$|BLENKINSOP. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{overtake}} him--[he rushes {{into the}} hotel].|$|E
6000|$|... 'Good-bye, Maisie. Won't {{you tell}} me where you live? I must see you again; and <b>perhaps</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> help you. I--I paint a little myself.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps I {{feel about}} her--rather {{as if she}} was as strong as I am--in those ways. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>I</b> shouldn't. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> hardly endure myself, Sir--cut off from her. And a sort of blank. Nothing said." ...|$|R
60|$|Guy. To {{give for}} me both life and honour too, <b>Is</b> more, <b>perhaps,</b> than <b>I</b> <b>could</b> give for you. You {{have done much}} to cure my jealousy, But cannot perfect it unless both die! For since both cannot live, who stays behind Must be thought fearful, or, what's worse, unkind.|$|R
60|$|I {{thought of}} Holmes tossing upon his bed of {{sickness}} and counting the minutes, <b>perhaps,</b> until <b>I</b> <b>could</b> bring help to him. It {{was not a}} time to stand upon ceremony. His life depended upon my promptness. Before the apologetic butler had delivered his message I had pushed past him {{and was in the}} room.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, if {{you only}} want them for a short time, <b>perhaps</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> manage,' {{answered}} the asp; 'but I can't do without them for long.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Goodbye, Maisie. Won't {{you tell}} me where you live? I must see you again; and <b>perhaps</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> help you. I--I paint a little myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Isn't--isn't there {{anything}} I {{could do for}} you, then? I'll stay here in England to do it, if you like. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> come and see you sometimes.' ...|$|E
60|$|I {{have now}} named what I regard {{as the most}} {{necessary}} and important changes. These are <b>perhaps</b> all <b>I</b> <b>could</b> be expected to name for nothing; {{but there are other}} suggestions which I can and will make in case my proposed application shall result in my being formally employed by the government in the work of reforming the language.|$|R
6000|$|<b>Perhaps,</b> {{his peace}} <b>I</b> <b>could</b> destroy, [...] And spoil the blisses that await him; [...] Yet let my Rival smile in joy, [...] For thy dear sake, I cannot hate him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, it ain't {{so awful}} swell; {{but then you}} can't call it so terrible bad. <b>Perhaps</b> some time <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have got money enough to start a news-stand, an' then I'd been all right, you know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She'd {{read that}} {{interview}} of mine with the Comet man," [...] Mr. Coulson said, [...] "and she fancied that <b>perhaps</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> tell her something about Hamilton Fynes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not the least. But it's {{awkward to}} be stuck here all the same. I think I could jump across on to that girder. Then <b>perhaps</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> see what is wrong." ...|$|E
60|$|LIZA. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> make {{something}} of him. But I never thought of us making anything of one another; and you never think of anything else. I only want to be natural.|$|E
6000|$|... "--or {{perhaps you}} hadn't thought of me at all. I'm {{naturally}} quite a silent little dub, but I've been learning that it's silly {{to be silent}} in business. So I've been planning {{to get hold of}} you and ask you where and how you get those suits of yours, and what I ought to wear. You see, after you marry I'll still be earning my living, and <b>perhaps</b> if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> dress anything like you <b>I</b> <b>could</b> fool some business man into thinking I was clever." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My {{feeling on}} the subject was so strong that, as you may remember, I {{declined}} to act as your secretary. <b>I</b> am <b>perhaps</b> over-sensitive, but <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not have written your book as you would have dictated it to me, and as you did indeed dictate it to your various secretaries." ...|$|R
6000|$|The Boer laughed. [...] "Of course I don't, Oom Silas. Well, if {{you want}} to know, I will tell you what I mean. I mean that I alone can protect you and your place and people in the bad times which are coming. I have more {{influence}} in the land than you know of. <b>Perhaps</b> even, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> stave off the war, and if it suited me to do so I would do it. At the least <b>I</b> <b>could</b> keep you from being harmed, that I know. But I have my price, Oom Silas, as we all have, and it must be money down and no credit." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{want to make}} sure, too, {{that the}} girl is all right till she's over her trouble. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> use some of that--that other money, if mine is all tied up?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes,--yes. I didn't know--I thought <b>perhaps</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{catch him}} here. But it don't matter. I {{wish you would}} let some one go with {{me to get a}} carriage," [...] she begged feebly.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] said Maggie, hesitatingly. Then with {{a bright}} smile, [...] "I think <b>perhaps</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> if he were very conceited; and yet, if he got {{extremely}} humiliated afterward, I should relent." ...|$|E
60|$|The day was fine, and the {{landscape}} lay clean and sharply defined under the blue sky and white clouds. I sped along in a cheerful mood, well pleased with what my good cycle had so far done for me. Again I passed the open gate of the Putney estate, and glanced through it at the lodge. I saw no one, and was glad of it--better pleased, <b>perhaps,</b> than <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have given good reason for. When I had gone on {{a few hundred yards}} I was suddenly startled by a voice--a female voice.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{had better}} get him onto a sofa, sir," [...] whispered the attendant, presently. [...] "Not very heavy. <b>Perhaps</b> you and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> manage." [...] It {{was when he was}} being lifted that Savine first showed signs of intelligence. He glanced at Geoffrey and {{attempted}} to beckon towards the room they had left. When he seemed slightly better, Thurston said: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I find instead just {{a dreamy}} romantic little girl, much like my sisters at home, {{except that she}} is a great deal cleverer. And as a result I mean to stay a week at Plainfield and come to see you every day, if you will let me. And on my way back to the Bar N I mean to stop off at Plainfield again for another week, and then I shall tell you {{something}} more--something it would be a little too bold to say now, <b>perhaps,</b> although <b>I</b> <b>could</b> say it just as well and truly. All this if I may. May I, Sidney?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No--; no--" [...] He uttered {{these two}} negatives {{in a low}} voice, and with much deliberation. [...] "I couldn't give it. A man can't give what he hasn't got;--but <b>perhaps</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> get it." ...|$|E
6000|$|Maternally, [...] "I think it's {{extremely}} {{nice of you}} to want to {{be trained}} in--in enunciation by a stage-director. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> help you. I'm a thoroughly sound and uninspired schoolma'am by instinct; quite hopelessly mature." ...|$|E
6000|$|Askew {{looked at}} the water, {{measuring}} its height. [...] "The stepping stones are not far off. One or two may be covered, but <b>perhaps</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> help you across and it would save you a mile." ...|$|E
60|$|Paris! I {{have not}} {{been out of the}} house, except when I came into it. But to-day, Thursday, I mean to drive out a little with Robert. You know I have a {{weakness}} for Paris, and a passion for Italy; which would operate thus, <b>perhaps,</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> easily stay here when once here, if there was but a sun to stay with me. We are in admiration, all of us, at everything, from cutlets to costumes. On the latter point I shall give myself great airs over you barbarians presently--no offence to Zerlinda--and, to begin, pray draw your bonnets more over your faces.|$|R
60|$|Meanwhile the {{schooner}} gradually {{fell off}} and filled again upon another tack, sailed swiftly {{for a minute}} or so, and brought up once more dead in the wind's eye. Again and again was this repeated. To and fro, up and down, north, south, east, and west, the HISPANIOLA sailed by swoops and dashes, and at each repetition ended as she had begun, with idly flapping canvas. It became plain to me that nobody was steering. And if so, where were the men? Either they were dead drunk or had deserted her, <b>I</b> thought, and <b>perhaps</b> if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> get on board I might return the vessel to her captain.|$|R
6000|$|... "O King, <b>perhaps</b> because <b>I</b> loved Umbelazi; for was he {{not called}} the Handsome? Also {{you know that}} the Prince, your son, was one to be loved." [...] Here she paused, looking at poor Panda, who winced. [...] "Or, <b>perhaps,</b> because <b>I</b> wished to be great; for was he not of the Blood Royal, and, {{had it not been for}} Saduko, would he not one day have been a king? Or, <b>perhaps,</b> because <b>I</b> <b>could</b> no longer bear the {{treatment}} that the Princess Nandie dealt out to me; she who was cruel to me and threatened to beat me, because Saduko loved my hut better than her own. Ask Saduko; he knows more of these matters than I do," [...] and she gazed at him steadily. Then she went on: [...] "How can a woman tell her reasons, O King, when she never knows them herself?"--a question at which some of her hearers smiled.|$|R
6000|$|Margaret {{absolutely}} {{depended on}} the bright cheerful look of conviction. [...] "Yes," [...] she said, [...] "we {{will try to make}} papa take pleasure in the prospect. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do more if I made the attempt." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Nay, that is {{best known}} to yourself, though I think <b>perhaps</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> divine,' said she, with that archness and grace that always seemed to remove the {{unfavourable}} impression that her proceedings might have given. 'Shall I?' ...|$|E
6000|$|I was dreadfully frightened, and so giddy that I {{clung to}} him with both hands, and said, [...] "If you would kindly please to let me keep upright, sir, perhaps I shouldn't be sick, and <b>perhaps</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> attend more." ...|$|E
40|$|In 1995, when I {{began my}} {{doctoral}} studies on what I then called ‘cyborg theory’, {{it seemed as}} if I had found a new ‘outcast’ to champion. The shifting border and contamination between what I referred to as ‘humanity’ and ‘technology’, seemed like a suitably fresh and adventurous border-crossing for the skirmish I was planning. In the manner of all good budding academics, I had been searching for, and thought I had found, my ‘area of specialization’, my ‘object of study’, the cultural figure or character I was going to rescue from the margins of academic and cultural discourse. The cyborg. <b>Perhaps</b> here <b>I</b> <b>could</b> ‘make my mark’. Here I would take my stand...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sue--my own too {{suffering}} dear!--there's no evil {{woman in}} you. Your natural instincts are perfectly healthy; {{not quite so}} impassioned, <b>perhaps,</b> as <b>I</b> <b>could</b> wish; but good, and dear, and pure. And as I have often said, you are absolutely the most ethereal, least sensual woman I ever knew to exist without inhuman sexlessness. Why do you talk in such a changed way? We have not been selfish, except when no one could profit by our being otherwise. You {{used to say that}} human nature was noble and long-suffering, not vile and corrupt, and at last I thought you spoke truly. And now you seem to take such a much lower view!" ...|$|R
6000|$|My {{soul was}} full of disgust ere I got back. And yet the ships were {{beautiful}} to see, as they are always; and on the pier there was a clean cold wind that smelt {{a little of the}} sea, though it came down the Firth, and the sunset had a certain ECLAT and warmth. <b>Perhaps</b> if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> get more work done, I should be in a better trim to enjoy filthy streets and people and cold grim weather; but I don't much feel as if it was what I would have chosen. I am tempted {{every day of my life}} to go off on another walking tour. I like that better than anything else that I know. - Ever your faithful friend, ...|$|R
