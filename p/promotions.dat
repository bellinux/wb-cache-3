40|$|A {{formula is}} derived to {{indicate}} the marginal returns to nonprice <b>promotion</b> for a competitive industry that promotes in both the domestic and the export market and receives a subsidy for export <b>promotion.</b> Private returns to export <b>promotion</b> are an increasing function of the export <b>promotion</b> elasticity, the export share, and the <b>promotion</b> subsidy and a decreasing function of the domestic supply elasticity, the absolute values of the domestic and export demand elasticities, and opportunity cost.

Although academics and practitioners {{have been writing}} about ethics, and especially values, in health <b>promotion</b> for decades, health <b>promotion</b> ethics is now regaining attention within the broader literature on public health ethics. Health <b>promotion</b> is difficult to define, and this has implications for health <b>promotion</b> ethics. Health <b>promotion</b> can be approached in two complementary ways: as a normative ideal, and as a practice. We consider the normative ideal of health <b>promotion</b> to be that aspect of public health practice that is particularly concerned with the equity of social arrangements: it imagines that social arrangements can be altered {{to make things better}} for everyone, whatever their health risks, and seeks to achieve this in collaboration with citizens. This raises two main ethical questions. First: what is a good society? And then: what should health <b>promotion</b> contribute to a good society? The practice of health <b>promotion</b> varies widely. Discussion of its ethical implications has addressed four main issues: the potential for health <b>promotion</b> to limit or increase the freedom of individuals; health <b>promotion</b> as a source of collective benefit; the possibility that health <b>promotion</b> strategies might “blame the victim” or stigmatise those who are disabled, sick or at higher risk of disease; and the importance of distributing the benefits of health <b>promotion</b> fairly. Different people will make different moral evaluations on each of these issues {{in a way that is}} informed by, and informs, their vision of a good society and their understanding of the ends of health <b>promotion.</b> We conclude that future work in health <b>promotion</b> ethics will require thoughtfully connecting social and political philosophy with an applied, empirically informed ethics of practice.
