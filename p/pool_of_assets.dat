25|$|To {{facilitate}} the securitization of non-mortgage assets, businesses substituted private credit enhancements. First, they over-collateralised pools of assets; shortly thereafter, they improved third-party and structural enhancements.

A <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> <b>assets</b> second only to mortgages in volume, auto loans were a good match for structured finance; their maturities, considerably shorter than those of mortgages, made the timing of cash flows more predictable, and their long statistical histories of performance gave investors confidence.|$|E

If a fiduciary takes a bribe and that bribe is considered a debt then if the fiduciary goes bankrupt the debt will be left in his <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> <b>assets</b> to be paid to creditors and the principal may miss out on recovery because other creditors were more secured.

A question addressed is under what circumstances one would expect to observe pooling alone (as with traditional securitization) versus pooling and tranching combined (as with structured finance). It is argued that asymmetric information problems between an originator and investors can lead to <b>pooling</b> <b>of</b> <b>assets</b> and tranching <b>of</b> associated liabilities, as opposed to pooling alone. The more acute the problem of adverse selection, the more likely is value to be created through issuance of tranched assetbacked securities.

50|$|Due to {{the limited}} assets at the {{disposal}} of an average employer as compared to an insurance company, an employer could easily bankrupt itself if its employees incur a large number of high-dollar claims and the employer is unable to fund them all. This risk is where the concept of stop-loss insurance comes into play, as it provides the employer with an additional source for funding to pay for catastrophic losses. Smaller managed care organizations also may purchase stop-loss insurance to protect themselves from the risk of catastrophic claims loss, but larger insurance companies, such as those that more commonly provide fully insured policies to employers, typically have a large enough <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> <b>assets</b> to be able to assume all of the risk of paying claims.

40|$|I {{show that}} when an issuer has {{superior}} {{information about the}} value <b>of</b> its <b>assets,</b> it is better off selling assets separately {{rather than as a}} pool due to the information destruction effect <b>of</b> <b>pooling.</b> If, however, the issuer can create a derivative security that is collateralized by the assets, pooling and "tranching" may be optimal. If the residual risk <b>of</b> each <b>asset</b> is not highly correlated, tranching allows the issuer to exploit the risk diversification effect <b>of</b> <b>pooling</b> to create a low-risk and highly liquid security. In contrast, for an uninformed seller, pure pooling reduces underpricing and is preferred to separate asset sales. These results lead to a dynamic model of financial intermediation: originators sell <b>pools</b> <b>of</b> <b>assets,</b> some <b>of</b> which are purchased by informed intermediaries who then further pool and tranche them. Pooling and tranching allow intermediaries to leverage their capital more efficiently, enhancing the returns to their private information. Copyright 2005, Oxford University Press. ...|$|R
