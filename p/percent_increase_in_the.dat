Part-time enrollment exhibits similar anticyclical patterns. This link carries over in large part to degrees obtained. In contrast, state and local appropriations per student are procyclical. We interpret this funding pattern as a failure to integrate education policy sufficiently closely with labor market policy. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Many studies, {{based on}} the {{accounting}} identify {{of gross domestic product}} (GDP), found that the contribution of foreign trade to China’s economic growth over the past 20 years was very small. In this paper, we re-examine the issue and find that those studies underestimate the contribution of exports to GDP growth by overlooking the indirect impacts of exports on domestic consumption, investment, government expenditures and imports. We propose a new estimation method and find that a ten <b>percent</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> exports resulted <b>in</b> a one <b>percent</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> GDP <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1990 s <b>in</b> China, when both direct and indirect contributions are considered...|$|R

25|$|Brown et al. (1983) {{noted that}} time series studies {{to that point}} had found that for a 10 <b>percent</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> minimum wage, there was a {{decrease}} in teenage employment of 1–3 percent. However, the studies found wider variation, from 0 to over 3 percent, in their estimates for the effect on teenage unemployment (teenagers without a job and looking for one). In contrast to the simple supply and demand diagram, it was commonly found that teenagers withdrew from the labor force {{in response to the}} minimum wage, which produced the possibility of equal reductions in the supply as well as the demand for labor at a higher minimum wage and hence no impact on the unemployment rate. Using a variety of specifications of the employment and unemployment equations (using ordinary least squares vs. generalized least squares regression procedures, and linear vs. logarithmic specifications), they found that a 10 <b>percent</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> minimum wage caused a 1 percent decrease in teenage employment, and no change in the teenage unemployment rate. The study also found a small, but statistically significant, increase in unemployment for adults aged 20–24.|$|E

25|$|In 1951, CAC {{obtained}} a licence agreement {{to build the}} F-86F Sabre. In a major departure from the North American blueprint, {{it was decided that}} the CA-27 would be powered by a licence-built version of the Rolls-Royce Avon R.A.7, rather than the General Electric J47. In theory, the Avon was capable of more than double the maximum thrust and double the thrust-to-weight ratio of the US engine. This necessitated a re-design of the fuselage, as the Avon was shorter, wider and lighter than the J47. Because of the engine change the type is sometimes referred to as the Avon Sabre. To accommodate the Avon, over 60 percent of the fuselage was altered and there was a 25 <b>percent</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> size of the air intake. Another major revision was in replacing the F-86F's six machine guns with two 30mm ADEN cannon, while other changes were also made to the cockpit and to provide an increased fuel capacity.|$|E
