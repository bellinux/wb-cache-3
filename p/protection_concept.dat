40|$|Fraunhofer IPA present {{new ways}} to improve the {{sustainability}} and efficiency of UV stabilizers in automotive clear coatings. This new UV <b>protection</b> <b>concepts</b> are based on the combination of conventional organic UV protection products with inorganic components, such as nanoparticles and layer silicates with UV absorbent, -scattering and heat reflective functions. Flaky nanoparticles with barrier properties have distinguished themselves as very useful, as they inhibit the oxygen and water absorption of the coating as well suppress the migration of the organic UV protection agents. The effectiveness of this UV <b>protection</b> <b>concepts</b> have been qualitative and quantitative evaluated with the photo-oxidation index (POI) and with the local concentration index (LoCI) and are based on FTIR- and confocal Raman-microscope measurements...|$|R
40|$|Accident {{statistics}} show that injuries to the lower extremities are quite frequent in accidents. In most cases these injuries are not life-threatening, but the related treatment & convalescence costs are quite high. In this study different factors influencing lower extremity injuries were investigated. To define the relevant parameters, a baseline crash test under Euro NCAP conditions with instrumented hybrid III legs was performed. Using these test results, a simulation model and a sled test model were set up in parallel and validated {{with respect to the}} baseline crash test. The main areas for improvement to the lower extremities were defined and from these, six different <b>protection</b> <b>concepts</b> were investigated: 1.) Foot airbag 2.) Foam padding (toeboard) 3.) Active unlocking of brake pedal 4.) Reduction of translational toeboard intrusion 5.) Reduction of rotational toeboard intrusion 6.) Pop-up kneebolster In order to investigate different combinations of these six <b>protection</b> <b>concepts,</b> a Design of Experiments (DoE) matrix was created and 108 simulation runs were performed. Based on the simulation results, six different combinations of these <b>protection</b> <b>concepts</b> were tested on the sled. Finally, the performance of the best protection system combination was verified in a full scale crash test...|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the fraudulent uses described here, the term [...] "equity stripping" [...] also refers to the asset <b>protection</b> <b>concept</b> whereby the equity of an asset is encumbered, or stripped, to frustrate collection efforts by unsecured creditors.

50|$|The {{foundation}} of an IT baseline <b>protection</b> <b>concept</b> is initially not a detailed risk analysis. It proceeds from overall hazards. Consequently, sophisticated classification according to damage extent and {{probability of occurrence}} is ignored. Three protection needs categories are established. With their help, the protection needs of the object under investigation can be determined. Based on these, appropriate personnel, technical, organizational and infrastructural security measures are selected from the IT Baseline Protection Catalogs.|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} {{techniques for}} extracting protected software and data from smartcard processors. This includes manual microprobing, laser cutting, focused ion-beam manipulation, glitch attacks, and power analysis. Many {{of these methods}} have already been used to compromise widely-fielded conditional-access systems, and current smartcards offer little protection against them. We give examples of low-cost <b>protection</b> <b>concepts</b> that make such attacks considerably more difficult...|$|R

50|$|On March 16, 2005, ZEUS was {{deployed}} to Iraq {{to assist in}} explosive ordnance disposal activities there {{as part of a}} three-vehicle convoy <b>protection</b> <b>concept.</b> The Zeus laser was tested and used in Iraq along MSR Tampa by a team of EOD soldiers from the 319th Ord Co (EOD), Tacoma, Washington in February and March 2005. The HLONS(Zeus) was added into the Hunter/Killer Project in an attempt to integrate EOD and Engineer resources. The project illustrated the shortcomings of the system with Counter IED (C-IED) operations. Chief among the limitations of the system was the inability to penetrate concealment materials to heat the explosives inside the ordnance, and the tendency of non EOD personnel to utilize the HLONS on all ordnance even if doing so created a more dangerous situation.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe Fraunhofer Institute for Production Technology IPT {{has carried}} out {{numerous}} TRIZ projects in recent years. For SMEs {{as well as}} for large enterprises from branches such as automotive, aerospace, electronics, mechanical engineering or white goods, Fraunhofer IPT not only acts as a mediator between TRIZ and these companies but also as technology expert and development partner. Fraunhofer IPT now enters a new field for TRIZ applications: technological know-how protection, i. e. the avoidance of product piracy in technology-intensive markets by integrating new, technology-based protection mechanisms into products and processes. Within a research project, Fraunhofer IPT conducts TRIZ workshops with consortium partners from different branches to identify innovative <b>protection</b> <b>concepts</b> for specific products of the companies involved. Function analysis is conducted in a first step, while in a subsequent step, the application of suitable TRIZ tools such as “sabotage” or “ideality thinking” help to generate innovative <b>protection</b> <b>concepts.</b> Following the workshops, Fraunhofer IPT supports the respective companies in elaborating the identified concepts. This paper gives insight into the project “Technology Know-how Protection”. After illustrating the design and implementation of the TRIZ workshops, an evaluation of different TRIZ tools is presented concerning their applicability in the field of technology know-how protection as an innovation process...|$|R
