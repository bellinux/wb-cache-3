Meadow Lane in Hunslet was also home to Christ Church, an architecturally notable Gothic church, which has since been demolished.|$|E

5|$|The Ring of Pietroassa (or Buzău torc) is a gold torc-like {{necklace}} {{found in}} a ring barrow in Pietroassa (now Pietroasele), Buzău County, southern Romania (formerly Wallachia), in 1837. It formed <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> gold hoard (the Pietroasele treasure) dated to between 250 and 400 CE.

A repeat the next day resulted in a classic dogfight with F-100 Super Sabres and F-105s fighting with more MiG-17s. In total, the USAF lost eleven aircraft to air and ground forces, while the VPAF lost three of their fighters.|$|E

He {{said in an interview with}} Entertainment Weekly that he had been invited to audition for the role of the Eighth Doctor in 1995 before the production of the 1996 TV film, but did not go because he was unsure if he would get the part and did not wish to be <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> group of actors turned down for the role.|$|E

His mother {{died when he was}} a child. In July 1907, at age 17, Aiello emigrated to the United States to join family members already residing there. After arriving in New York City by boat, he worked a series of menial jobs in Buffalo and Utica, New York, before connecting with his father, brothers and cousins in Chicago. The family set up several businesses in both New York and Chicago, including the financially successful Aiello Brothers Bakery, and they become importers of such groceries as olive oil, cheeses and sugar.|$|E
5|$|Geologically the Sulphur Creek {{watershed}} {{was once}} <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> and shallow sea that covered most of southern California. As the San Joaquin Hills rose and river sediments were deposited, land gradually emerged {{to form the}} present-day Orange County coast. Sulphur Creek {{is located in a}} crumpled, hilly area {{in the southern part of}} this range, formed differently from the continuous mountain chain to the north. Historically, being south of Aliso Creek, the Sulphur Creek watershed was part of the territory of the semi-nomadic Acjachemen Indian group, conquered by Spanish conquistadors in the 17th and 18th centuries and renamed the Juaneño by them.|$|E

5|$|In 1925, Maeda became {{involved}} with helping settle Japanese immigrants near Tome-açú, a Japanese-owned company town in Pará, Brazil. This was <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> tract in the Amazon forest set aside for Japanese settlement by the Brazilian government. The crops grown by the Japanese were not popular with the Brazilians, and the Japanese investors eventually gave up on the project. Maeda also continued teaching judo, now mostly {{to the children of}} Japanese immigrants. Consequently, in 1929, the Kodokan promoted him to 6th dan, and on November 27, 1941, to 7th dan. Maeda never knew of this final promotion, because he died in Belém on November 28, 1941. The cause of death was kidney disease.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, {{plans to}} enhance the station's {{facilities}} were approved by the Department for Transport. The works, <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> transport scheme called the Weston Package, included expanded the car park by 320 spaces, better facilities for cyclists and motorcyclists, and a bus interchange. A bus link to the nearby Queensway retail park was {{also included in the}} scheme. The expansion took over unused land to the east and south of the station, and required the removal of slowworms and grass snakes to a nature reserve in Cheddar. The work, which started in April 2013, was completed later the same year with the new car park opening on 3 September 2013.|$|E

The emigrants had been <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> migration of Albanians to Italy following a popular uprising that began {{after the collapse of}} several large-scale pyramid schemes. In order to prevent the unauthorized entry of illegals migrants into Italy, the Italian Navy set up a procedure to board Albanian vessels whenever encountered, implementing a de facto blockade.|$|E
5|$|The {{bill was}} <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> reform {{movement}} to prevent equitable courts {{such as the}} Court of Chancery from undermining their business. It was far cheaper and faster than the older equivalents used by the Chancery and Common Pleas, leading to a drop in their business {{and an increase in}} that of the King's Bench. As such, the Chancery issued injunctions in an ineffective attempt to prevent its use. The Bill was finally abolished by the Uniformity of Process Act 1832.|$|E

5|$|The genus Sylvia, {{the typical}} warblers, forms <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> family of Old World warblers, the Sylviidae. Fossils from France {{show that the}} genus dates back at least 20million years. The garden warbler and its nearest relative, the blackcap, are an ancient species pair which diverged very early {{from the rest of}} the genus, between 12 and 16million years ago. In the course of time, these two species have become {{sufficiently}} distinctive that they have been placed in separate subgenera, with the blackcap in subgenus Sylvia and the garden warbler in Epilais. These sister species have a breeding range which extends farther northeast than all other Sylvia species except the lesser whitethroat and common whitethroat.|$|E
5|$|The {{very few}} remains of monastic {{architecture}} {{in the period}} are supplemented by brief documentary mentions. St Laurence's Church, Bradford-on-Avon appears to represent a unique near-complete monastic church of the period, and the angels in relief were probably <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> rood cross group. Generally the contemporary sources give much more detail on the valuable treasures in precious metal, rich embroidered cloth, and other materials which the monasteries were able to accumulate, largely from gifts by the elite. The few pieces to survive mostly did so outside England, and include the silver Brussels Cross and a walrus ivory figure from a Crucifixion.|$|E
5|$|Transcription {{is carried}} out by a DNA-dependent RNA {{polymerase}} that copies the sequence of a DNA strand into RNA. To begin transcribing a gene, the RNA polymerase binds to a sequence of DNA called a promoter and separates the DNA strands. It then copies the gene sequence into a messenger RNA transcript until it reaches a region of DNA called the terminator, where it halts and detaches from the DNA. As with human DNA-dependent DNA polymerases, RNA polymerase II, the enzyme that transcribes most of the genes in the human genome, operates as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> protein complex with multiple regulatory and accessory subunits.|$|E
