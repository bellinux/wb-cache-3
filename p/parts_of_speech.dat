40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{issues in}} <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>speech</b> disambiguation using finite-state transducers and presents two main {{contributions to the}} field. One {{of them is the}} use of finite-state machines for <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>speech</b> tagging. Linguistic and statistical information is represented in terms of weights on transitions in weighted finite-state transducers. Another contribution is the successful combination of techniques [...] linguistic and statistical [...] for word disambiguation, compounded with the notion of word classes. 1 Introduction Finite-state machines have been extensively used in several areas of natural language processing, including computational phonology, morphology, and syntax. Nevertheless, less has been done in the area <b>of</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>speech</b> disambiguation with finite-state transducers (Silberztein 1993; Roche and Schabes 1995; Chanod and Tapanainen 1995). <b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>speech</b> tagging consists <b>of</b> assigning to a word its disambiguated <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>speech</b> in the sentential context in which this word is [...] ...|$|R
50|$|Clipping is {{different}} from back-formation - back-formation may change the <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>speech</b> or the word's meaning, whereas clipping creates shortened words from longer words, but {{does not change the}} <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>speech</b> or the meaning of the word.|$|R
25|$|Affixally polysynthetic {{languages}} {{do not use}} noun incorporation or verb serialisation, {{since this}} violates the rule concerning the number of roots allowable per word.

25|$|Speech Awareness: The {{awareness}} of individual <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>speech</b> as {{they apply to}} individual written characters is crucial for understanding reading (as defined by translating written characters into spoken language). Phonological awareness, which includes the manipulation of rhymes, syllables, and onsets and rimes, is most prevalent in Alphabetic systems. The important part of speech depends on the Writing system employed.|$|E

50|$|In linguistics, determinans (from the Latin determinare, to fix {{the limits}} of something) is a <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>speech</b> that modifies another <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>speech.</b> In the noun phrase noun phrase, for example, noun is the determinans and phrase is the determinatum, i.e. that {{which is to be}} determined.|$|R
40|$|With {{the growing}} number of textual {{resources}} available, the ability to understand them becomes critical.

25|$|The {{arrangement}} of poems into couplets encouraged {{the use of}} parallelism: where for two lines of a poem it would be expected that the reader would compare and contrast the meaning of two lines, which would be specifically marked by the poet by using the same <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>speech</b> in each position, or in certain key positions in each line, or else within one line.|$|E
25|$|These morphemes {{contained}} both semantic and semiological information (non-base morphemes only contained semiological information). They {{could occur}} as either free bases, {{which did not}} need affixes, and bound bases, which only occurred with affixes. However, free bases could be designated different <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>speech</b> (verbs, nouns, etc.) based on the affixes attached, and sometimes can be used indifferently as any one with no change.|$|E
25|$|Other <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>speech</b> {{would be}} very unusual in this position. However, in verse, poetic {{inversion}} {{for the sake of}} meter or of bringing a rhyme word {{to the end of a}} line often results in abnormal syntax, as with Shakespeare's split infinitive (to pitied be, cited above), in fact an inverted passive construction in which the infinitive is split by a past participle. Presumably, this would not have occurred in a prose text by the same author.|$|E

25|$|Romániço (1991) is {{designed}} to be more intuitive for native speakers of English.

25|$|Theophrastus {{seems to}} have carried out still further the {{grammatical}} foundation of logic and rhetoric, since in his book on the elements of speech, he distinguished the main <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>speech</b> from the subordinate parts, and also direct expressions (κυρία λέξις kuria lexis) from metaphorical expressions, and dealt with the emotions (πάθη pathe) of speech. He further distinguished a twofold reference of speech (σχίσις schisis) to things (πράγματα pragmata) and to the hearers, and referred poetry and rhetoric to the latter.|$|E

25|$|In Fuzhou dialect, {{there are}} various kinds of initial assimilation, {{all of which are}} progressive. When two or more than two {{syllable}}s combine into a word, the initial of the first syllable stays unchanged while those of the following syllables, in most cases, change to match its preceding phoneme, i.e., the coda of its preceding syllable. As with the rime changes, initial assimilation is not as mandatory as tone sandhi in connected speech, and its presence and absence may indicate different <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>speech,</b> different meanings of a single word, or different relationships between groups of words syntactically.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the first}} type {{adjectives}} of the third declension are with the suffix -in-. These are easily made from other <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>speech</b> by adding the suffix -in-. When made from verbs, they are mostly made from a past passive participle: vìrti – to boil, vìrtas – boiled, virtìnis – which is boiled, made by boiling. Consequently, the suffix is -t-in- for such adjectives. Such variants of verbal derivation easily become nouns (declined in noun declension paradigm), {{in this case it}} is a noun virtìnis – dumpling (with mushrooms; curd; etc.; but dumplings with meat are called koldūnai).|$|E
25|$|Pāṇini's {{systematic}} approach to analysis includes components for: (a) forming grammatical rules, (b) {{an inventory of}} sounds, (c) a list of verbal roots organized into sublists, and (d) a list of classes of morphs. Bloomfield's approach to key linguistic ideas in his textbook Language reflect the influence of Pāṇini in his treatment of basic concepts such as linguistic form, free form, and others. Similarly, Pāṇini is the source for Bloomfield's use of the terms exocentric and endocentric used to describe compound words. Concepts from Pāṇini are found in Eastern Ojibwa, published posthumously in 1958, in particular {{his use of the}} concept of a morphological zero, a morpheme that has no overt realization. Pāṇini's influence is also present in Bloomfield's approach to determining <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>speech</b> (Bloomfield uses the term 'form-classes') in both Eastern Ojibwa and in the later Menomini language, published posthumously in 1962.|$|E

Each of the resulting clusters defines a new <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>speech</b> tag.
