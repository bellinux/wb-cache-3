The <b>pea</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>weevil</b> is native to Europe, but has spread to other places such as Alberta, Canada. They are about 3.5 mm—5.5 mm long and are {{distinguishable}} by three light-coloured stripes running length-wise down the thorax. The weevil larvae feed on the root nodules of pea plants, which {{are essential to the}} plants' supply of nitrogen, and thus diminish leaf and stem growth.

40|$|Crop traits {{can alter}} {{economically}} important interactions between plants, pests, and biological control agents. For example, a reduced waxy bloom {{on the surface}} of pea plants alters interactions between pea aphids and their natural enemies. In this study, we assess whether the effect of wax reduction extends beyond the 2 or 3 arthropod species closely associated with the plants and into the structure of the broader arthropod community of over 200 taxa at our site. We sampled arthropods on lines of peas with normal and reduced wax in Latah Co., Idaho using pitfall traps within randomly assigned pairs of 5 × 5 meter plots. During the 1998 and 1999 growing seasons, we collected 12, 113 individual arthropods from 221 unambiguously identified morphospecies. The number of individuals collected from each morphospecies responded idiosyncratically to the reduced wax peas. To test whether arthropod community structure differed between the collections from plots having peas with normal or reduced wax, we performed a randomization test. The collection from peas with reduced wax had higher species evenness and thus higher community diversity despite having lower species richness. Our results demonstrate the potential of a single plant trait, epicuticular wax, to affect a community of arthropods. Two pests of peas had opposite responses to peas with reduced wax. The number of pea aphids collected was greater from peas with normal wax peas than those with reduced wax. In contrast, the number of <b>pea</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>weevils</b> collected was greater from peas with reduced wax...|$|R

40|$|The <b>pea</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>weevil</b> {{is one of}} the few {{insect pests}} of field peas in {{southern}} Alberta and southwest Saskatchewan. Adults cause distinctive notching on seedlings which generally does not affect yield. Larval feeding on nitrogen-fixing root nodules may reduce yield if soil is nitrogen deficient. Only field peas and faba beans are at risk of damage. Other crops in the bean family may be fed on by adults but do not suffer significant damage from larvae. The economic threshold during the second to fifth node stages in field peas is 30 % of seedlings with damage to the terminal (clam) leaf. Seed treated with thiamethoxam has produced more consistent yield responses than application of foliar insecticides but additional farm-level trials are required. Trap cropping the <b>pea</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>weevil</b> can be done by planting a border in the fall with winter peas or adjacent, earlier planting of a spring cultivar. Close monitoring of the trap crop is needed to control the weevils in the trap crop area before they move to the rest of the field. Fields under no tillage regimes suffer less damage than those under conventional tillage. Biological control is a research area that should be pursued for sustainable management of this pest. Background The <b>pea</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>weevil,</b> Sitona lineatus L. (Fig. 1), belongs to the most speciose insect order, the Coleoptera, and the most speciose beetle family, the Curculionidae.

The experiment was conducted in the laboratory, in six replicates. Feeding intensity assessment was conducted by dipping leaves of broad bean in respective solutions of the extracts and determining the area of broad bean leaves, eaten by <b>pea</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>weevil</b> beetle in the 12 hour intervals. In addition, absolute deterrence index and palatability index were calculated. As a result of the observation no significant limiting effect of fennel seed aqueous extracts on the feeding of the <b>pea</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>weevil</b> females was shown. All of the used fennel extracts had inhibitory effect on the feeding of male S. linetaus and the strongest effect of extracts was observed in the first 36 hours of the experiment.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} the effect of aqueous extracts of dried mint (Mentha piperita L.) in concentrations of 2 %, 5 % and 10 %, and fresh parts of this plant, in concentrations of 10 %, 20 % and 30 % on feeding of <b>pea</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>weevil</b> (Sitona lineatus L.) and survival of black bean aphid (Aphis fabae Scop.) on the leaves of broad bean (Vicia faba L.) variety "Bartek". In the studies of the effects of aqueous extracts of mint on the dynamics of Sitona lineatus feeding on the beans leaves, 9 laboratory’s observations in 12 -hour intervals was made. Leaves injuries on their edge surface caused by adult individuals were measured. Observations were carried out in 6 replicates divided into males and females. In these researches on impact of water extracts from mint on mortality of wingless females and larvae of black bean aphids, 14 laboratory’s observations in the 8 -hour intervals was made. Aqueous extracts of dry and fresh peppermint significantly limited the feeding of <b>pea</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>weevil</b> females, and the extracts from dried material were more effective. Extracts from peppermint to a greater extent caused mortality of black bean aphid larvae compared to wingless females, and the higher the concentration of the extract the more beneficial effect was observed. An extract from dried material at a concentration of 2 % was too weak to effectively combat the larvae of A. fabae, while in the case of aphid females, an effectiveness was only demonstrated for the extracts at the highest concentrations, i. e., 10 % of dried and 30 % of fresh peppermint...|$|E

Adults were fed for 29 d in 1990 and 18 d in both 1991 and 1992. The mean cumulative consumption per adult was 27. 2 ± 1. 6 cm 2 and 92. 7 ± 3. 5 mg dry weight in 1991 and 24. 6 ± 0. 9 cm 2 and 87. 5 ± 2. 9 mg dry weight in 1992. The mean cumulative consumption pattern was curvilinear for both dry weight and leaf area consumption. Most consumption was within 11 d of adult eclosion.

Therefore, several controlled assays were performed {{in order to determine}} effects of a recently registered neonicotinoid, (thiamethoxam) on S. lineatus damage to foliage, weevil mortality, fertility, egg viability, larval mortality, and root nodule damage. Foliage damage was reduced by thiamethoxam relative to untreated controls during the seedling stage (2 nd – 5 th nodes), but weevil adult mortality was only 15 – 30 %. Fertility was reduced substantially through an extra seven-day delay in the pre-oviposition period and reduced egg-laying rate during the first 20 days of the study (92 % lower than controls). Overall egg viability was lower in females fed foliage grown from thiamethoxam-treated seeds. Larval survivorship and nodule damage were also lower, but only when eggs were added to treated plants at the 2 nd node stage.
