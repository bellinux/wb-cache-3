5|$|The larvae of inarticulates swim as {{plankton}} {{for months}} and are like miniature adults, with valves, mantle lobes, a <b>pedicle</b> that coils in the mantle cavity, and a small lophophore, which is used for both feeding and swimming—except that Craniids have no <b>pedicle.</b> As the shell becomes heavier, the juvenile sinks {{to the bottom and}} becomes a sessile adult. The larvae of articulate species live only on yolk, and remain among the plankton for only a few days. This type of larva has a ciliated frontmost lobe that becomes the body and lophophore, a rear lobe that becomes the <b>pedicle,</b> and a mantle like a skirt, with the hem towards the rear. On metamorphosing into an adult, the <b>pedicle</b> attaches to a surface, the front lobe develops the lophophore and other organs, and the mantle rolls up over the front lobe and starts to secrete the shell. In cold seas, brachiopod growth is seasonal and the animals often lose weight in winter. These variations in growth often form growth lines in the shells. Members of some genera have survived for a year in aquaria without food.|$|E

5|$|As a vespid wasp, P. exclamans nests are {{typically}} {{made up of}} paper with a single layer of cells with open combs. Although nest size varies, the upper limit is around 500 cells. Although many vespid wasp nests have an outer envelope of paper, P. exclamans nests do not. As indicated by Strassmann and Orgren, “Nests are approximately circular, and have a single off-center pedicel usually located towards {{the top of the}} nest. Cells near the <b>pedicle</b> are the oldest.” P. exclamans are particularly able to colonize new sites as foundresses often disperse into new territories. P. exclamans have often been found to have nests located near man-made structures and tend to more readily build nests in and near these man-made structures. Out of six wasp species, P. exclamans {{was the only one that}} occupied artificial nesting sites. It prefers well-lit, open sites.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from its}} long face, the large chest and the sharply sloping back {{differentiate}} the hartebeest from other antelopes. The hartebeest shares several physical traits with the sassabies (genus Damaliscus), {{such as an}} elongated and narrow face, {{the shape of the}} horns, the pelage texture and colour, and the terminal tuft of the tail. The wildebeest have more specialised skull and horn features than the hartebeest. The hartebeest exhibits sexual dimorphism, but only slightly, as both sexes bear horns and have similar body masses. The degree of sexual dimorphism varies by subspecies. Males are 8% heavier than females in Swayne's and Lichtenstein's hartebeest, and 23% heavier in the red hartebeest. In one study, the highest dimorphism was found in skull weight. Another study concluded that the length of the breeding season is a good predictor of dimorphism in <b>pedicle</b> (the bony structures from which the horns grow) height and skull weight, and the best predictor of the horn circumference.|$|E
5|$|Like other arthropods, spiders are coelomates {{in which}} the coelom is reduced to small areas round the {{reproductive}} and excretory systems. Its place is largely taken by a hemocoel, a cavity that runs most {{of the length of}} the body and through which blood flows. The heart is a tube in {{the upper part of the}} body, with a few ostia that act as non-return valves allowing blood to enter the heart from the hemocoel but prevent it from leaving before it reaches the front end. However, in spiders, it occupies only the upper part of the abdomen, and blood is discharged into the hemocoel by one artery that opens at the rear end of the abdomen and by branching arteries that pass through the <b>pedicle</b> and open into several parts of the cephalothorax. Hence spiders have open circulatory systems. The blood of many spiders that have book lungs contains the respiratory pigment hemocyanin to make oxygen transport more efficient.|$|E
5000|$|Gracilis {{muscle is}} widely used in {{reconstructive}} surgery (graciloplasty), either as a <b>pedicled</b> flap or as a free microsurgical flap.

25|$|After {{establishing}} {{the dimensions of}} the new nipple-areola complex, the surgeon de-epithelializes the medial <b>pedicle</b> skin-flap that provides the venous-arterial vascular system for the nipple-areola complex. The first incisions are through the parenchymal tissue, and separate the medial <b>pedicle.</b> The incision is effected to avoid undercutting the skin <b>pedicle</b> and so preserve the nipple-areola complex blood-supply vessels. Hence, the tissue volume of the <b>pedicle</b> flap is essential for {{establishing the}} adequate projection of the upper pole of the breast, where the breast originates from the chest. The surgeon resects (cuts and removes) an almost-triangular segment of tissue below the medial <b>pedicle.</b> Finally, for emplacing the nipple-areola complex, the incisions are completed by cutting the ellipse and the tissue adjacent to the medial <b>pedicle.</b>|$|E
25|$|Although the {{aforementioned}} descriptions {{are of the}} incisions used to address the breast skin envelope, the surgical management of the breast tissue (parenchyma) is a separate consideration, including maintenance of the neurovascular integrity of the nipple-areola complex. The degree of hemispheric elevation of the nipple-areola complex determines the type of <b>pedicle</b> (superior, inferior, medial) that will provide the best venous and arterial vascular supply to the nipple-areola complex. Therefore, {{the application of the}} superior <b>pedicle</b> approach affords the surgeon greater procedural flexibility in determining the incision site for emplacing the breast implant, but it limits the possible degree of elevation of the nipple. Application of the inferior <b>pedicle</b> approach affords a greater degree of nipple-areola complex elevation, but makes difficult emplacing the breast implant, and the subsequent contouring of the breast. Application of the medial <b>pedicle</b> approach preserves breast sensation with a reliable venous and arterial vascular supply, and avoids the technical and procedural limitations of the superior <b>pedicle</b> and the inferior <b>pedicle</b> approaches.|$|E
25|$|If the incisions to {{the breast}} are satisfactory, the patient’s {{homeostasis}} is feasible at that juncture of the mastopexy operation. The surgeon then evaluates the tissue-thickness of the medial <b>pedicle</b> flap, and its physical capability for rotating in a superomedial direction (above {{and to the}} center) with no resultant torsion tension to the tissue of the inferior portion of the pedicle; afterwards, the surgeon reduces the tissue thickness of the skin <b>pedicle.</b> Once positioned superiorly, the <b>pedicle</b> tissue thickness is reviewed to ascertain that it fits into the new position, without undue pressure or constriction; thus are assured the tissue viability of the medial <b>pedicle</b> and of the nipple-areola complex.|$|E
40|$|A patient {{presented}} with severe triple-vessel coronary artery disease, including multiple lesions {{on the left}} anterior descending coronary artery (LAD), which supplied a well-contracting myocardium. In approaching our patient, we judged that a <b>pedicled</b> left internal thoracic artery (LITA) would not provide enough length for sequential grafting of the multisegment-diseased LAD. We also considered that a <b>pedicled</b> right internal thoracic artery (RITA) conduit would not be long enough to provide a free segment that would form a tandem graft with a LITA and then arrive at the marginal branch, unless it was detached at its origin. Consequently, we decided to form a composite graft that would connect a free, short segment (6 – 7 cm) of <b>pedicled</b> LITA to the in situ <b>pedicled</b> RITA, in an end-to-end fashion. This new composite conduit enabled us to perform sequential grafting (3 sequential anastomoses, 2 with the LITA segment) of the multisegment-diseased LAD, following the route anterior to the aorta. The in situ remnant of the LITA was grafted to the marginal branch. Although many large series have reported resourceful solutions, {{to the best of}} our knowledge, tandem arterial sequential grafting (an in situ <b>pedicled</b> RITA plus a free, short segment of a <b>pedicled</b> LITA) has not heretofore been reported in application to the multisegmented-diseased LAD artery...|$|R
40|$|The {{posterior}} medial thigh {{is mainly}} vascularized by the {{profunda femoris artery}} (PFA), which nourishes the adductor magnus muscle and overlying skin, to supply a number of perforators that can potentially be used as <b>pedicles</b> for local perforator flaps. Here we present two cases utilizing the <b>pedicled</b> posteromedial thigh flap (PMT) to reconstruct the groin defects. Two patients underwent resection for metastatic malignant melanoma resulting in large defects of the groin with exposure of major inguinal vessels; {{the dimensions of the}} skin defects were 15 cm × 5 cm and 16 cm × 6 cm, two ipsilateral <b>pedicled</b> PMT flaps were designed to cover the defects. The <b>pedicled</b> PMT flaps were based on perforators arising from the PFA and were transposed through a submuscular tunnel into the defect. The postoperative course was uneventful and the wounds were reconstructed successfully.

40|$|PURPOSE: Experimental studies {{indicate}} that perioperative hypoperfusion impairs anastomotic healing. In bowel surgery, the part of bowel that will be anastomosed is often <b>pedicled,</b> leaving the blood supply dependent on the marginal artery only. Little {{is known about the}} blood supply in such a segment, and whether anastomotic strength is affected when flow would be reduced. This study describes oxygenation and blood flow in <b>pedicled</b> bowel segments in the rat and investigates whether early anastomotic strength changes with variations in blood flow. METHODS: In rats, <b>pedicled</b> segments were created in ileum and colon by successive ligation of the feeding arteries. Oxygenation and blood flow were measured in the distal part of this segment by use of near-infrared spectroscopy with indocyanine green as an intravascular tracer. In a second experiment, a short <b>pedicled</b> colonic segment was created and, after flow measurements, an anastomosis was constructed. Wound strength and hydroxyproline content were analyzed 2 and 5 days after operation. RESULTS: After creation of a <b>pedicled</b> segment, the concentration of oxygenated hemoglobin decreased significantly. Blood flow also significantly decreased to even less than 10 % of baseline. A very large variation was observed between animals, in particular, after ligation of the first arteries. The strength of colonic anastomoses was not significantly correlated with the blood flow in the <b>pedicled</b> segment before anastomotic construction. CONCLUSIONS: The creation of a <b>pedicled</b> bowel segment greatly reduces tissue oxygenation and blood flow to its distal part. Such impaired perioperative flow does not significantly affect early wound strength after anastomotic construction...|$|R
25|$|Based {{upon the}} {{available}} area of nasal skin, the surgeon selects the locale for the bilobed flap, and orients the <b>pedicle.</b> If the defect {{is in the}} lateral aspect of the nose, the <b>pedicle</b> is based medially. If the defect is at the nasal tip, or at the nasal dorsum, the <b>pedicle</b> is based laterally. An ideal location for the second flap is along the junction of the nasal dorsum and the lateral nasal wall.|$|E
25|$|The nasal wound is cut {{and shaped}} into a {{teardrop}} form, by the cutting {{out of a}} Burrow's triangle of flesh {{on the side of}} <b>pedicle</b> base.

25|$|The {{inferior}} <b>pedicle</b> (central mound) {{features a}} blood vessel supply (arterial and venous) for the nipple-areola complex (NAC) from an inferior, centrally-based {{attachment to the}} chest wall. The skin <b>pedicle</b> maintains the innervation and vascular viability of the NAC, which produces a reduced, sensitive breast with full lactational capability and function. The volume and size reduction of hypertrophied breasts is performed with a periareolar incision to the nipple-areola complex, which then extends downwards, following the natural curve of the breast hemisphere. After cutting and removing the requisite quantities of tissue (glandular, adipose, skin), the nipple-areola complex is transposed higher upon the breast hemisphere; thereby the inferior <b>pedicle</b> technique produces an elevated bust with breasts that are proportionate to the woman's person. Nonetheless, breast-reduction with an inferior <b>pedicle,</b> occasionally produces breasts that appear squared; yet, the technique effectively reduces the very enlarged breasts of macromastia and gigantomastia.|$|E
30|$|A {{total of}} 990 <b>pedicles</b> (198 <b>pedicles</b> at each {{vertebral}} level) were evaluated in this study.

40|$|<b>Pedicles</b> of skin which {{lacked a}} lymphatic {{drainage}} were {{raised on the}} backs of rats in order to study the importance of afferent lymphatics in sensitization by skin allografts. Although allografts transplanted to the alymphatic <b>pedicles</b> enjoyed a prolonged survival, they contracted progressively from about 3 wk after transplantation and were reduced eventually to small scars. In contrast, autografts survived unchanged in size for the life-span of the <b>pedicles</b> which carried them. The slow contracture of the allografts was associated with sensitization of the host because test allografts applied orthotopically were destroyed with a second-set tempo. No regeneration of lymphatics from the long-standing <b>pedicles</b> could be demonstrated, and it was concluded that sensitization had occurred eventually through the blood, presumably by the process of peripheral sensitization. Allografts on skin <b>pedicles</b> could be destroyed rapidly by active or adoptive immunization, so it is probable that the level of sensitization to which they themselves gave rise was a low one. Although it is not disputed that afferent lymphatics are essential for the rapid destruction of skin allografts, {{it is clear that the}} absence of a lymphatic supply does not permanently exempt them from immunological attack in the rat...|$|R

The horizontal-scar technique best applies to the woman whose oversized breasts are too large for a vertical-incision technique (e.g. the lollipop pattern); and it has two therapeutic advantages: no vertical incision-scar to the breast hemisphere, and better healing of the periareolar scar of the transposed NAC. The potential disadvantages are box-shaped breasts with thick (hypertrophied) incision scars, especially at the inframammary fold.|$|E

40|$|ObjectiveA pain {{syndrome}} {{related to}} intercostal nerve injury during {{internal thoracic artery}} harvesting causes significant morbidity after coronary bypass surgery. We hypothesized that its incidence and severity might be reduced by using skeletonized internal thoracic artery harvesting rather than <b>pedicled</b> harvesting. MethodsIn a prospective double-blind clinical trial, 41 patients undergoing coronary bypass were randomized to receive either unilateral <b>pedicled</b> or skeletonized internal thoracic artery harvesting. Patients were assessed 7 (early) and 21 (late) weeks postoperatively with reproducible sensory stimuli used to detect chest wall sensory deficits (dysesthesia) and with a pain questionnaire used to assess neuropathic pain. ResultsAt 7 weeks postoperatively, the area of harvest dysesthesia (percentage of the chest) in the skeletonized group (n = 21) was less (median, 0 %; interquartile range, 0 – 0) than in the <b>pedicled</b> group (n = 20) (2. 8 % [0 – 13], P =. 005). The incidence of harvest dysesthesia at 7 weeks was 14 % in the skeletonized group versus 50 % in the <b>pedicled</b> group (P =. 02). These differences were not sustained at 21 weeks, as the median area of harvest dysesthesia in both groups was 0 % (P =. 89) and the incidence was 24 % and 25 % in the skeletonized and <b>pedicled</b> groups, respectively (P = 1. 0). The incidence of neuropathic pain in the skeletonized group compared with the <b>pedicled</b> group was 5 % versus 10 % (P =. 6) at 7 weeks and 0 % versus 0 % (P = 1. 0) at 21 weeks. ConclusionsCompared with <b>pedicled</b> harvesting, skeletonized harvesting of the internal thoracic artery provides a short-term reduction in the extent and incidence of chest wall dysesthesia after coronary bypass, consistent with reduced intercostal nerve injury and therefore the reduced potential for neuropathic chest pain...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. – OBJECTIVE: The {{placement}} of osteosynthetic {{materials in the}} leg may be complicated by hardware exposure. Successful soft tissue reconstruction often provides a critical means for limb salvage in patients with hardware exposure in the leg. Free flaps are currently considered the standard surgical procedure for soft tissue coverage of the wounds with internal hardware exposure. However, to date, no conclusive literature shows the superiority of {{a specific type of}} flap. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The current review compares data from the literature concerning outcomes and complications of free and <b>pedicled</b> flaps for exposed osteosynthetic material preservation in the leg. RESULTS: A total of 81 cases from twelve different articles presenting internal hardware exposure of the leg were analyzed in our study. Thirty-two patients underwent immediate reconstructive surgery with <b>pedicled</b> flaps, while forty-nine patients underwent free flap reconstruction. The overall survival rate for <b>pedicled</b> flaps was 96. 77 %, while for free flaps it was 97. 77 %. The overall implant preservation rate was 78. 12 % for <b>pedicled</b> flaps and 53. 33 % for free flaps. With reference to postoperative complications, the overall complication rate was 46. 87 % for <b>pedicled</b> flaps and 10. 20 % for free flaps. CONCLUSIONS: No significant difference was found in terms of overall flap survival. However, a significant difference was found regarding successful implant preservation (78. 12 % in the <b>pedicled</b> flap group vs. 53. 33 % in the free flap group). In particular, the first observation appears to be in contrast with the current trend of considering the free flaps the first choice procedure for soft tissue coverage of the wounds with internal hardware exposure. Nevertheless, a higher occurrence of postoperative complications was observed in the <b>pedicled</b> flap group (46. 87 % vs. 10. 20 %). The choice of the most appropriate reconstructive procedure should take into account several issues including the size of the wounds with internal hardware exposure, the possibility of soft tissue coverage with <b>pedicled</b> flaps, the availability of recipient vessels, general conditions of the patients (such as age, diabetes, smoking history), patients’ preference and presence of a microsurgical team. However, according to the results of this review, we believe that <b>pedicled</b> flap reconstruction should be reconsidered as a valid alternative procedure for skin tissue loss with hardware exposure whenever it is possible...|$|R
40|$|Background: Vascularized periosteal flaps (VPFs) are {{flexible}} osteogenic flaps, {{suitable for}} the reconstruction of small skeletal defects. <b>Pedicled</b> VPFs, harvested near the recipient site, minimize donor-site morbidity and procedure duration. The donor sites and the potential recipient sites for <b>pedicled</b> VPFs of the distal forearm-hand were identified in this study.
