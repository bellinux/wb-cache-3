They were joined by Uruguayans <b>No</b> <b>Te</b> <b>Va</b> a Gustar and La Vela Puerca, giving rise to the term [...] "rioplatense" [...] rock (rock from the Río de la Plata region) to label all of the similarly inclined outfits. Rolinga rock has created many fine singles and albums, but critics argue many of the bands (specially second rate groups in the rolinga scene), simply repeated the same formula to sell albums. Another feature of rolinga rock is that it tends to shun overseas success: whether this is a conscious attitude or a simple limitation of the genre is an ongoing debate.|$|R
40|$|Este {{proyecto}} se propone abordar el estudio de la Memoria Colectiva desde un enfoque cognitivo constructivista cultural, lo cual implica centrarse en el estudio de los procesos de transformaci??n del conocimiento teniendo en cuenta la comprensi??n y el cambio conceptual implicado en los mismos. Para eso se hace necesario relevar las teor??as impl??citas existentes, ya que en este trabajo, el estudio de la memoria colectiva se realiza como proceso para interrogar las maneras en que las personas construyen un sentido del pasado. Tambi??n las diferentes formas y ??mbitos de ense??anza-aprendizaje, y los mecanismos involucrados. En tanto los objetos culturales tienen una relaci??n con los procesos de construcci??n de la memoria colectiva, este proyecto propone un estudio cualitativo, de campo, donde se propone abordar los aportes que dos bandas de m??sica uruguayas (???La Vela Puerca??? y ???<b>No</b> <b>Te</b> <b>Va</b> Gustar???) a trav??s de sus canciones, pueden aportar en la transmisi??n de la historia reciente sobre la ??ltima dictadura en Uruguay a j??venes de 15 a 20 a??os de edad, y en la formaci??n de una memoria colectiva. This proyect {{is focused}} {{in the study}} of Collective Memorie from a cognitive, constructivist and cultural angle, which jeans to focus on the proces of the transformation of the knwolodge, having in mind the comprehencion and conceptual changeithassufered. To do that we must unfold the theories that are implied but exist, because in this thesis the study of the colective memorie are the means to interrogate peroles way of making sense of the past, also the diferent ways of learning and teaching,and the mecanisms envolved inthis proces. On the other side the cultural objects are part of the proces that builds the collective memorie, this proyect proposes to trace what this two Uruguayan bands (???La Vela Puerca??? and ???<b>No</b> <b>Te</b> <b>Va</b> Gustar???) share through their songs transmiting the recent events about the last dictatorship era in Uruguay to people between 15 and 20 years old and {{in the creation of a}} collective memorie...|$|R
5000|$|Rock {{and roll}} first broke into Uruguayan audiences {{with the arrival}} of British band The Beatles in the early 1960s.
