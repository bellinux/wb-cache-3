40|$|In oxygen steelmaking, a high {{velocity}} oxygen jet is injected {{in to the}} steelmaking converter which contains the hot metal {{that is to be}} refined into steel with a defined chemistry. This injected oxygen oxidises the elements in the liquid metal (silicon, carbon, manganese, phosphorus and iron) and a slag layer is formed from these oxides and dissolving fluxes (lime and dolomite) over the liquid metal bath. This slag traps the gas produced by carbon oxidation producing foam. Slag foaming in steelmaking has attracted much attention among steelmaking researchers [1 - 6], because it can be detrimental when formed in extensive amounts. Developing predictive models <b>for</b> <b>foaming</b> height and <b>bath</b> chemistry of oxygen steelmaking have been the centre of concern of researchers in the field in recent decades.

5000|$|Preparations {{to produce}} a <b>foam</b> <b>bath</b> must be able at high {{dilution}} in water of common [...] "hardness" [...] {{to produce a}} foam and hold it for a useful duration. This is practically always done primarily {{by the action of}} an anionic, nonionic, or zwitterionic surfactant. Although cationic surfactants could theoretically be used, for various reasons they are not. Typically a mixture of different surfactants is used. Of the anionics, soap is not a common deliberate constituent of <b>bath</b> <b>foam</b> preparations because they react rapidly with [...] "hardness" [...] cations in water to produce lime soaps, which are anti-foams. Usually one or more ingredients is primarily a foam stabilizer—a substance which retards the breakage of foams; these may themselves be surfactants or film-stabilizing polymers. Some surfactants used in foaming preparations may have a combination of foam-producing and foam-stabilizing properties. Surfactants used in <b>bath</b> <b>foam</b> preparations may also be included for primarily non-foaming purposes: solubilization of other components in the manufacturing of a liquid product, or lime soap dispersion to prevent bathtub ring when used with soap.|$|R

50|$|It is {{possible}} to produce baths with bubbles simultaneously in {{and on top of}} the water (as in a poured beer), but the combination has not been popular. Mechanical aeration of a <b>foam</b> <b>bath</b> may produce much more foam than is sought—the Internet is replete with first hand accounts and sometimes photographs of such experiences—and many mechanically aerated baths are hot tubs which are shared and not drained between uses and so are desired to be kept free of non-maintenance materials. Mechanically aerated baths for tissue debridement of burn victims typically have added anti-foaming agents to counteract the film-forming properties that some medicinal additives have as a side effect, but the anti-foam is sometimes omitted or reduced for children to give them more of a pleasant distraction during debridement. Bath fizzies that also foam tend to produce disappointingly little foam when allowed to do so from their own fizz, and aeration of the water loses the gas from the fizz.|$|R
