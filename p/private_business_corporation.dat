25|$|It is {{interesting}} to note that, depending on your political point of view, such government payments for offsetting the housing charge could be considered a subsidy of the low-income members, or a contractual business arrangement {{between the government and the}} co-op, which helps to stabilize revenue to the co-op in exchange for accomplishing a social goal for the government for a specific period. This dichotomy is typical of the fact that a housing co-op is somewhere between a <b>private</b> <b>business</b> <b>corporation</b> and a social agency, and where one places it depends on one's viewpoint—and the collective viewpoint of each housing co-op.

50|$|The era was pro as {{entrepreneurs}} {{extended the}} range of their business around the globe. The South Sea Bubble was a business enterprise that exploded in scandal. The South Sea Company was a <b>private</b> <b>business</b> <b>corporation</b> set up in London ostensibly to grant trade monopolies in South America. Its actual purpose was to re-negotiate previous high-interest government loans amounting to £31 million through market manipulation and speculation. It issued stock four times in 1720 that reached about 8,000 investors. Prices kept soaring every day, from £130 a share to £1,000, with insiders making huge paper profits. The Bubble collapsed overnight, ruining many speculators. Investigations showed bribes had reached into high places—even to the king. Robert Walpole managed to wind it down with minimal political and economic damage, although some losers fled to exile or committed suicide.|$|E

This article looks at {{the provisions of the}} <b>Private</b> <b>Business</b> <b>Corporations</b> Act [Chapter 24 : 111 of Zimbabwe (Hereinafter referred to as the PBCA).

It is important to look at the provisions of the PBCA Chapter 24 : 11 to establish whether the provisions available offer any added advantages to the small businessman than what was currently on offer then. It is also necessary to compare these regulations with the law governing companies, partnerships and co-operatives in order to conclude whether there was an actual need for such new regulations {{in the form of a}} new Act or whether it would have been easier and even more advantageous to incorporate these rules or regulations in the Companies Act. The PBCA creates the latest business entity in Zimbabwe. 1 The intention of the Act is to provide a new form of enterprise which is most suitable for small businessman. This enterprise would enjoy liberalised regulations. It would be simpler to incorporate and at the same time enjoy the benefits of limited liability. Limited liability is a very important concept in business. It protects the investor from possible personal financial ruin if the business fails.

50|$|Corporate statism most {{commonly}} manifests {{itself as a}} ruling party acting as a mediator between the workers, capitalists and other prominent state interests by institutionally incorporating them into the ruling mechanism. Corporatist systems were most prevalent in the mid-20th Century in Europe and later elsewhere in developing countries. According to this critique, interests, both social and economic, are so diverse that a state cannot possibly mediate between them effectively through incorporating them. Social conflicts go beyond incorporated dichotomies of labor and capital to include innumerable groups. Furthermore, globalization presents challenges, both social and economic, that a corporate state cannot sufficiently address because these problems transcend state borders and approaches. It therefore differs from Corporate nationalism {{in that it is}} a social mode of organization rather than an economic nationalism through <b>private</b> <b>business</b> <b>corporations.</b>|$|R

40|$|We {{argue that}} the idea of ECC (Extended Corporate Citizenship) is more in line with libertarian than liberal thinking. The basic idea of ECC is the {{dislocation}} of the provider of citizenship rights from governments to corporations: corporations provide and administrate the same citizenship rights, which governments provided earlier, before the political processes started the privatization of these entitlements (since the 1980 ’s and 1990 ’s). According to John Rawls’ liberal viewpoint, citizens’ relations to the public structures of society are supposed to be fundamentally different from their relations to <b>private</b> associations like <b>business</b> <b>corporations.</b> In libertarian thinking (as with Robert Nozick), instead, citizens relations to public institutions do not significantly differ from their relations to <b>business</b> <b>corporations.</b> Both are based on voluntary agreements, bringing forth the idea of a contract-society. Since ECC is backed up by this kind of contract-society, it brings forth libertarian interpretations of the most central political matters - like the basic structure of society, and the concepts of freedom and democracy...|$|R

Two competitive project were launched: Prague Stock Exchange and RM-System. As investment funds collected investment vouchers and become important shareholders, large packages of shares were formed and new majority shareholders stepped into their rights and powers. The transfer of ownership finished, public markets lost their broad clientele and had to reduce number of titles traded substancially. Todays capital markets in the Czech Republic are mostly OTC markets, with some contribution of public markets (RMS and PSE), of which more important is the Prague Stock Exchange.

50|$|In {{response}} to these setbacks, Iran initiated its third economic development plan (1962-68) {{with an emphasis on}} industrialization. New economic policies significantly altered the role of the private sector. The expansion of private and public banks, as well as the establishment of two specialized banks, provided reliable credit markets for medium- and large-scale private manufacturing enterprises. Not limited to cheap credit, government programs also included a wide range of incentives to encourage investment in new industries by both Iranian and foreign businesses. Most new investment was a joint effort between either the public sector and foreign investors or <b>private</b> <b>businesses</b> and foreign <b>corporations.</b> Investment in roads, highways, dams, bridges, and seaports also increased. With government support, part of the agricultural sector also attracted significant investment.
