40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{discover}} the extent to which consumers are aware of air filling in food packaging, the extent to which deceptive packaging and slack filling – which often result from <b>package</b> <b>downsizing</b> – lead to cognitive dissonance, and the extent to which feelings of cognitive dissonance and being deceived lead consumers to engage in negative post purchase behaviours. Design/methodology/approach – The study analysed respondents’ reactions to a series of images of a specific product. The sample consisted of consumers of FMCG products in the UK. Five photographs served as the stimulus material. The first picture showed a well-known brand of premium chocolate in its packaging and then four further pictures each showed a plate with a different amount of chocolate on it, which represented different possible levels of package fill. Findings – Consumer expectations of pack fill were positively related to consumers’ post purchase dissonance, and higher dissonance was negatively related to repurchase intentions and positively related to both intended visible and non-visible negative post purchase behaviours, such as switching brand and telling friends to avoid the product. Furthermore, consumers with low product involvement were less likely to repurchase the brand and were more willing to engage in visible and non-visible negative behaviours. Research implications – The key message from this research is that consumer post purchase dissonance is likely to damage the firm. Although firms may initially achieve increased sales through deceptive packaging and slack filling, these practices risk damaging a brand’s reputation and consumer loyalty to the brand. Firms need to strike a balance between packaging size and content, and as consumer expectations are likely to vary across different products, individual companies should engage in market research and substantive market testing. Originality/value – To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study that investigates antecedents and consequences of cognitive dissonance experienced by consumers which was caused by perceived deceptive packaging and/or slack filling...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is composed}} of three empirical essays that involve rigorous analyses of important economic questions with implications to welfare, public policy and marketing. In particular, these essays contribute to the existing literature by further illuminating our economic understanding of generic dairy promotion programs, dairy co-cooperatives’ conduct and food manufacturing firms’ marketing strategy of reducing product package size. ^ In the first essay we estimate a dairy demand system to evaluate generic dairy advertising in the U. S. from 1990 to 2005. Previous empirical studies of generic dairy advertising focus only on the market of the advertised good, ignoring potential spillover and feedback effects. We specify an LA/AIDS model of dairy demand, which allows consistent estimation of cross-price and cross-advertising effects across dairy product markets, and is flexible and satisfies the axioms of consumer theory. We use the non-linear 3 SLS estimator to address endogenous prices and serial correlation, and conduct bootstrapping to generate empirical distributions of elasticity estimates. Results suggest that cross-market effects are economically and statistically important. Thus, econometric dairy demand models that ignore cross-advertising and cross-price effects are misspecified. Previous work that ignores substitution between fluid milk and cheese overstates producers’ returns to generic advertising for either product. ^ In the second essay we adopt a structural econometric model of the vertical relationship in U. S. dairy markets to identify pricing behavior in the supply chain for fluid milk. The model consists {{of a system of}} equations that allows estimation of oligopoly power of dairy co-operatives and downstream firms, exploiting Federal Milk Marketing Order regulations to identify co-operatives’ marginal cost. We take a Bayesian approach to estimate the model. The estimation framework incorporates inequality constraints on model parameters based on economic theory. A key finding is that co-operatives use their market power to raise the farm price of milk by almost 9 % above marginal cost, resulting in an income transfer of more than $ 600 million per year in markets regulated by Federal Milk Marketing Orders. Market power by processors–retailers results in a mark–up of 0. 5 % and an income transfer of $ 86 million per year. ^ In the third essay we estimate a random utility model of demand to measure consumer response to manufacturers’ <b>package</b> <b>downsizing.</b> We perform the analysis using Nielsen Homescan data on bulk ice cream purchases of a panel of households in Chicago, between 1998 and 2007. We adapt a Bayesian approach for estimation. The estimation framework involves modeling household heterogeneity, addressing price endogeneity and dealing with unbalanced choice alternatives. The main finding is that consumers are sensitive to package size changes, but on average the demand elasticity with respect to package size is approximately one-fourth of the demand elasticity with respect to price. This finding suggests that consumers are less sensitive to changes in package size than to changes in price. This result implies that manufacturers can use downsizing as a hidden price increase in order to pass through increases in production costs, i. e. cost of raw materials, and maintain, or increase, their profit margins. ...|$|E

He also aimed to improve departmental services to customers. He restructured 17 separate departmental units into four programs, and offered redundancy <b>packages</b> to <b>downsize</b> the department, reducing staffing numbers by more than 1000.

40|$|The {{study focused}} on {{the utility of the}} Strategic Human Resources Management model in the Civil Service Commissions. The SHRM model has for some time become an area of concern in the {{management}} of the Public Sector. It however, has not been explored by organisations with rigid structures. Since independence some reforms have been taking place but the implementation of Strategic Human Resources Management (SHRM) has remained untouched or less utilised. It was against this background that the researcher decided to undertake a study to dig dip into its utility in the Civil Service Commissions. The main objective was to analyse the effective of SHRM in the Civil Service Commissions (CSC). Different views by different authorities on SHRM were considered. Methodological pluralism was employed as different data collection methods such as indepth interviews, key informant interviews and questionnaires were used to come out with information on the utility of SHRM in the CSC. The paper managed to get information on the potential effectiveness. The study revealed that the CSC in terms of SHRM is still lagging behind and so far it has been cherry picking some tenets of SHRM once in a while. The top echelons are holding on to the power culture such that they are not entertaining full participation of line managers. Decision making is highly centralised and motivation is still at low note. This has resulted in a highly congested CSC with many employees than it requires and can afford to pay. The study recommends that the CSC mobilises funds for training and development to capacitate line managers with the required techniques, for retrenchment <b>packages</b> after <b>downsizing</b> as well as embark on a strategic restructuring programme...|$|R
