5|$|Joyce {{had begun}} his {{education}} at Clongowes Wood College, a Jesuit boarding school near Clane, County Kildare, in 1888 {{but had to}} leave in 1892 when his father could no longer pay the fees. Joyce then studied at home and briefly at the Christian Brothers O'Connell School on North Richmond Street, Dublin, before he was offered {{a place in the}} Jesuits' Dublin school, Belvedere College, in 1893. This came about because of a chance meeting his father had with a Jesuit priest who knew the family and Joyce was given a reduction in fees to attend Belvedere. In 1895, Joyce, now aged 13, was elected to join the Sodality of Our Lady by his <b>peers</b> <b>at</b> Belvedere. The philosophy of Thomas Aquinas continued to have a strong influence on him for most of his life.|$|E
5|$|For George III, Pitt's {{appointment}} {{was a great}} victory. It proved {{that he was able}} to appoint Prime Ministers on the basis of his own interpretation of the public mood without having to follow the choice of the current majority in the House of Commons. Throughout Pitt's ministry, George supported many of Pitt's political aims and created new <b>peers</b> <b>at</b> an unprecedented rate to increase the number of Pitt's supporters in the House of Lords. During and after Pitt's ministry, George III was extremely popular in Britain. The British people admired him for his piety, and for remaining faithful to his wife. He was fond of his children, and was devastated at the death of two of his sons in infancy in 1782 and 1783 respectively. Nevertheless, he set his children a strict regimen. They were expected to attend rigorous lessons from seven in the morning, and to lead lives of religious observance and virtue. When his children strayed from George's own principles of righteousness, as his sons did as young adults, he was dismayed and disappointed.|$|E

25|$|Hobgoblin is a 1981 {{novel by}} horror and {{suspense}} writer John Coyne that followed on the angst about the Egbert incident, D, and fantasy role-playing games in general. It {{is about a}} young man, Scott Gardiner, who is traumatized by {{the sudden death of}} his father and by his mother's decision to take a job as caretaker of an isolated estate called Ballycastle. Ostracized by his <b>peers</b> <b>at</b> the local high school, Scott takes refuge in Hobgoblin, a role-playing game based on Ancient Celtic cults.|$|E
25|$|Quicksilver Messenger Service {{initially}} {{held back}} from committing {{to a record}} deal but eventually signed to Capitol Records in late 1967, becoming {{the last of the}} top-ranked San Francisco bands to join a major label. Capitol was the only company that had missed out on signing a San Francisco “hippie” band during the first flurry of record company interest and, consequently, Quicksilver Messenger Service was able to negotiate a better deal than many of their <b>peers.</b> <b>At</b> the same time, Capitol signed the Steve Miller Band, with whom Quicksilver Messenger Service had appeared on the movie and soundtrack album Revolution, together with the group Mother Earth.|$|E

25|$|North Dakota was {{far away}} from the centers of the hippie {{movement}} on the coasts of the United States, but this did not mean that the local students did not {{know what was going on}} with their <b>peers</b> <b>at</b> schools such as UC-Berkeley. The combination of tension between the students and the established powers, and the local and state governments' lack of experience in dealing with large gatherings of angry and drunk protesters led to the riot that would put Zap, North Dakota across the headlines of the U.S. newspapers and make it the lead story on the CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite. What started out as a lark turned into a riot that resulted in thousands of dollars of damage.|$|E
25|$|The growth {{problem is}} even worse in the simple virilizing forms of CAH which are {{detected}} when premature pubic hair appears in childhood, because the bone age is often several years advanced {{at the age of}} diagnosis. While a boy (or girl) with simple virilizing CAH is taller than <b>peers</b> <b>at</b> that point, he will have far fewer years remaining to grow, and may go from being a very tall 7-year-old to a 62-inch 13-year-old who has completed growth. Even with adrenal suppression, many of these children will have already had central precocious puberty triggered by the prolonged exposure of the hypothalamus to the adrenal androgens and estrogens. If this has begun, it may be advantageous to suppress puberty with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist such as leuprolide to slow continuing bone maturation.|$|E

On 8 September 2002 Shefflin lined out in his third All-Ireland decider as Kilkenny faced first-round losers Clare. Shefflin and fellow forward D. J. Carey combined to score 2-13 between them, as Kilkenny secured a 2-20 to 0-19 victory. It was a second All-Ireland medal for Shefflin while he was later honoured with his second All-Star award.

25|$|The {{legislative}} session began on January 10. While the Republicans had a 35 to 25 majority in House, Geary {{was elected to}} the speaker position unanimously by his House <b>peers.</b> <b>At</b> the beginning of the session, the House decided to allow radio and television reporters inside the chambers for first time. However, live broadcasting was not authorized except with prior approval of the speaker. As speaker, Geary framed a number of important issues for House action. These issues included expanding unemployment insurance to cover all Oregon workers, raising the minimum wage for teachers across the state, and increasing the pay of Oregon Supreme Court judges. The legislature also passed a bill urging the United States Congress to admit Alaska as a state. The session ended on 4 May. It was the second longest {{legislative session}} in Oregon history, lasting a total of 115 days. While Geary was not a dynamic public politician, he proved to be an excellent behind-the-scene leader throughout the session. As a result, some newspapers began suggesting that he had potential for higher state office.|$|E
25|$|About {{eight million}} men {{surrendered}} and {{were held in}} POW camps during the war. All nations pledged to follow the Hague Conventions on fair treatment of prisoners of war, and the survival rate for POWs was generally much {{higher than that of}} their <b>peers</b> <b>at</b> the front. Individual surrenders were uncommon; large units usually surrendered en masse. At the siege of Maubeuge about 40,000 French soldiers surrendered, at the battle of Galicia Russians took about 100,000 to 120,000 Austrian captives, at the Brusilov Offensive about 325,000 to 417,000 Germans and Austrians surrendered to Russians, and at the Battle of Tannenberg 92,000 Russians surrendered. When the besieged garrison of Kaunas surrendered in 1915, some 20,000 Russians became prisoners, at the battle near Przasnysz (February–March 1915) 14,000 Germans surrendered to Russians, and at the First Battle of the Marne about 12,000 Germans surrendered to the Allies. 25–31% of Russian losses (as a proportion of those captured, wounded, or killed) were to prisoner status; for Austria-Hungary 32%, for Italy 26%, for France 12%, for Germany 9%; for Britain 7%. Prisoners from the Allied armies totalled about 1.4million (not including Russia, which lost 2.5–3.5 million men as prisoners). From the Central Powers about 3.3million men became prisoners; most of them surrendered to Russians. Germany held 2.5million prisoners; Russia held 2.2–2.9million; while Britain and France held about 720,000. Most were captured just before the Armistice. The United States held 48,000. The most dangerous moment was the act of surrender, when helpless soldiers were sometimes gunned down. Once prisoners reached a camp, conditions were, in general, satisfactory (and much better than in World War II), {{thanks in part to the}} efforts of the International Red Cross and inspections by neutral nations. However, conditions were terrible in Russia: starvation was common for prisoners and civilians alike; about 15–20% of the prisoners in Russia died and in Central Powers imprisonment—8% of Russians. In Germany, food was scarce, but only 5% died.|$|E

500|$|Half-Life is a first-person shooter that {{requires}} the player to perform combat tasks and puzzle solving to advance through the game. Unlike most of its <b>peers</b> <b>at</b> the time, Half-Life used scripted sequences, such as a Vortigaunt ramming down a door, to advance major plot points. Compared to most first-person shooters of the time, which relied on cut-scene intermissions to detail their plotlines, Half-Lifes story is told entirely by means of scripted sequences, keeping the player {{in control of the}} first-person viewpoint. In line with this, the game has no cut-scenes, and the player rarely loses the ability to control Gordon, who never speaks and is never actually seen in the game; the player sees [...] "through his eyes" [...] for {{the entire length of the}} game. Half-Life has no [...] "levels"; it instead divides the game into chapters, whose titles flash on the screen as the player moves through the game. Progress through the world is continuous, except for short pauses for loading.|$|E
