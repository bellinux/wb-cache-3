5|$|A pH {{indicator}} is a {{weak acid}} or weak base that changes colour {{in the transition}} <b>pH</b> <b>range,</b> which is approximately pKa±1. The design of a universal indicator requires a mixture of indicators whose adjacent pKa values differ by about two, so that their transition pH ranges just overlap.|$|E
5|$|When {{carbonate}} is added, uranium {{is converted}} {{to a series of}} carbonate complexes if the pH is increased. One effect of these reactions is increased solubility of uranium in the <b>pH</b> <b>range</b> 6 to 8, a fact that has a direct bearing on the long term stability of spent uranium dioxide nuclear fuels.|$|E
5|$|When the {{difference}} between successive pK values is less than about four there is overlap between the <b>pH</b> <b>range</b> of existence of the species in equilibrium. The smaller {{the difference}}, the more the overlap. The case of citric acid is shown at the right; solutions of citric acid are buffered over {{the whole range of}} pH2.5 to 7.5.|$|E
50|$|The pH of Pine Creek {{south of}} the {{community}} of Fountain ranges from 6.2 to 7.1.

50|$|At the {{confluence}} of Amos Run with Birch Island Run, the latter stream's <b>pH</b> <b>ranged</b> from 4.9 to 6.2 in 2002, {{with an average of}} 5.3. At {{the confluence}} of Little Birch Island Run with Birch Island Run, the latter stream's <b>pH</b> <b>ranged</b> from 4.7 to 5.7, with an average of 5.1. At the stream's mouth, the <b>pH</b> <b>ranged</b> from 4.8 to 5.5, with an average of 5.1. In the upper reaches of Birch Island Run, the pH is naturally low, as opposed to being low due to acid mine drainage. The alkalinity level of the upper parts of the stream is low.|$|R
5|$|Abundant and widespread, A.obovatus {{occurs on}} a wide range of soils, favouring soils in the acidic <b>pH</b> <b>range</b> 3.9–5.4. Like most Adenanthos species it is common on deeply leached {{siliceous}} sandplain sand. It also occurs on gravelly quartz sand derived from rock outcrops, such as on the rocky hillslopes of the Stirling Range. It is rarely found on gravelly lateritic soils. It is also one of the few Adenanthos species to grow well in moist environments; it will not tolerate seasonal waterlogging—that niche is filled by A.detmoldii—but thrives in damp soils not subject to waterlogging.|$|E
5|$|A {{peroxidase}} enzyme {{known as}} MroAPO (Marasmius rotula aromatic peroxygenase) is attracting research interest for possible applications in biocatalysis. In general, enzymes that catalyze oxygen-transfer reactions are of great utility in chemical synthesis since they work selectively and under ambient conditions. Fungal peroxidases can catalyze oxidations {{that are difficult}} for the organic chemist, including those involving aromatic substrates such as aniline, 4-aminophenol, hydroquinone, resorcinol, catechol, and paracetamol. The M.rotula enzyme is the first fungal peroxygenase that can be produced in high yields. It is highly stable over a wide <b>pH</b> <b>range,</b> and {{in a variety of}} organic solvents. The enzyme has other potential for use as a biosensor for aromatic substances in environmental analysis and drug monitoring.|$|E
5|$|Azotobacter can fix {{at least}} 10 μg of {{nitrogen}} per gram of glucose consumed. Nitrogen fixation requires molybdenum ions, {{but they can}} be partially or completely replaced by vanadium ions. If atmospheric nitrogen is not fixed, the source of nitrogen can alternatively be nitrates, ammonium ions, or amino acids. The optimal pH for the growth and nitrogen fixation is 7.0–7.5, but growth is sustained in the <b>pH</b> <b>range</b> from 4.8 to 8.5. Azotobacter can also grow mixotrophically, in a molecular-nitrogen-free medium containing mannose; this growth mode is hydrogen-dependent. Hydrogen is available in the soil, thus this growth mode may occur in nature.|$|E
50|$|The pH of Black Creek in {{its upper}} reaches ranges from 6.1 to 6.4. At the Hazleton High School it ranges from 4.9 to 6 {{and at the}} Hazleton Wastewater Treatment Plant from 5.5 to 6. Downstream of the plant the <b>pH</b> <b>ranges</b> between 6.4 and 7. At the bridge at Tomhicken it ranges from 6.1 to 6.7 and at the State Route 3020 bridge from 6.2 to 6.8. Above and below the Gowen Discharge, the creek's <b>pH</b> <b>ranges</b> from 6.3 to 6.8 and 4.6 and 6.2 respectively.

5|$|Banksia aculeata grows slowly, {{generally}} taking five to {{six years}} to flower from seed, {{though there is a}} report of it flowering in three years at Strathmerton in Victoria. Regarding its potential as an ornamental plant, Alex George observes that the flowers are brightly coloured but have a short life and are obscured by the foliage, which is quite prickly. He nonetheless considers both the new foliage and the infructescence attractive. This species can grow in a range of soil types so long as they provide good drainage. The nominal soil <b>pH</b> <b>range</b> is from 5.5 to 6.5. It prefers full sun, although it will grow in partly shaded situations, producing fewer flowers. It will tolerate light pruning.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, a {{study was}} done on the pH of the waters of Nescopeck Creek and its tributaries. At three sites, its pH {{averaged}} 5.06, 4.85, and 4.49. However, the pH at Nescopeck Creek's headwaters is between 6.5 and 7. The lowest pH level in the Nescopeck Creek watershed is 4.2, which is on some parts of Black Creek. Creasy Creek is the most alkaline tributary of Nescopeck Creek, with a pH ranging from 6.9 to 7.2. Other relatively alkaline streams in the creek's watershed include Long Run (6.6), Reilly Creek (6.4), Long Hollow (6.4), Oley Creek (6.4), Conety Run (6.2), and Little Nescopeck Creek A (5.8 to 7). Brook trout are able to tolerate pHs down to 4.8 and the ideal <b>pH</b> <b>range</b> for freshwater fish is 6.5 to 9.0.|$|E
5|$|Morpholinos are {{synthetic}} {{molecules that}} {{are the product of}} a redesign of natural nucleic acid structure. Usually 25 bases in length, they bind to complementary sequences of RNA or single-stranded DNA by standard nucleic acid base-pairing. In terms of structure, the difference between Morpholinos and DNA is that, while Morpholinos have standard nucleic acid bases, those bases are bound to morpholine rings linked through phosphorodiamidate groups instead of phosphates. The figure compares the structures of the two strands depicted there, one of RNA and the other of a Morpholino. Replacement of anionic phosphates with the uncharged phosphorodiamidate groups eliminates ionization in the usual physiological <b>pH</b> <b>range,</b> so Morpholinos in organisms or cells are uncharged molecules. The entire backbone of a Morpholino is made from these modified subunits.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the easier}} Western species to grow, Banksia lemanniana has some horticultural {{potential}} in its attractive chocolate buds, green-yellow hanging flower spikes and large grey spikes with prominent follicles. It generally grows quite quickly, but nevertheless takes {{five to six}} years to flower from seed. It prefers a more alkaline rocky or sandy soil, with a nominal <b>pH</b> <b>range</b> from 6 to 7.5. It favours a sunny position and good drainage, and has been successfully cultivated in more humid climates on Australia's east coast. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 27 to 43 days to germinate.|$|E
5|$|Seeds do {{not require}} any treatment, and take 23 to 50 days to {{germinate}} in cultivation. Banksia caleyi is a medium- to slow-growing plant, taking {{four to five years}} to flower from seed. The flowers are attractive but are obscured by the foliage. This species can grow in a range of soil types so long as they provide good drainage. The nominal soil <b>pH</b> <b>range</b> is from 6 to 7.5. It grows in full sun and partly shaded situations, and tolerates light pruning. Unlike many other Western Australian banksias, Banksia caleyi has had some degree of success in growing in more humid areas, such as Australia's east coast. It attracts pygmy and honey possums in the garden.|$|E
5|$|West Creek is less {{affected}} by episodic acidification {{than most of}} the rest of the upper Fishing Creek watershed, with the exception of Coles Creek. The pH of West Creek is at its lowest in late winter and spring, when it is typically around 6.3. During the rest of the year, it is above 7.0. The entire <b>pH</b> <b>range</b> of the creek ranges from just over 6.0 to 7.2 or 7.3. The concentration of dissolved aluminum in West Creek is under 70 micrograms per liter, considerably less than the concentration needed to kill fish. The aluminum concentration is, in fact, usually approximately zero and is often under 40 micrograms per liter. However, early in 2011, the concentration was observed twice to be nearly 60 micrograms per liter.|$|E
