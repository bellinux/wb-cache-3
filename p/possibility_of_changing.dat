Instead, {{the state of}} New York began {{to look into the}} <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>changing</b> the designations that were assigned to the Outer Loop. In one proposal submitted to the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials in the late 1970s, I-590 would be truncated to begin at the then-proposed junction with I-390 in Brighton. The rest of the loop south of I-490, meanwhile, would become part of an extended I-390, which would continue north past I-490 to the Outer Loop's northwestern end at the Lake Ontario State Parkway. NY47, the then-current designation for much of the Outer Loop, would be eliminated entirely.|$|E

Most of the plans went into effect when the NY47 designation was eliminated on March18, 1980. The southern half of the Outer Loop was signed as planned; however, I-390 and I-590 were modified to end at their junctions with I-490. The section of I-590 from Winton Road to I-390—as well as the interchange connecting the two—was completed [...]|$|E
500|$|In 2003, Underoath {{supported}} the album's release {{with their first}} inclusion on Warped Tour, however {{their participation in the}} tour came to an end when Taylor (under controversial conditions) was asked to leave the band. Keyboardist, Chris Dudley explained at that time that Taylor could no longer tour with Underoath for various reasons and left on his own decision. Under speculation of a potential break up, the band then went on a supporting tour with Atreyu in August 2003 with Matt Tarpey as the temporary lead vocalist, while at the time being a part of Winter Solstice. In October 2003, at the CMJ Fest in New York City, the band reappeared with Spencer Chamberlain, formerly of the band This Runs Through, as the new lead vocalist. Chamberlain had toured with Underoath when fronting his former band and at one time was roommates with Dudley; their previous friendship with Chamberlain was considered when making him lead vocalist. Gillespie explained that before Chamberlain had been in the band, the group members [...] "didn't really get along", however, after Chamberlain joined [...] "everything was just normal, we clicked". After Chamberlain became a permanent member, Underoath discussed the <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>changing</b> the name and becoming a new band. Ultimately, the members decided to remain as Underoath.|$|E

500|$|Pinter's last stage play, Celebration (2000), is {{a social}} satire set in an opulent restaurant, which lampoons The Ivy, a fashionable venue in London's West End theatre district, and its patrons who [...] "have just come from {{performances}} of either the ballet or the opera. Not that they can remember a darn thing about what they saw, including the titles. [...] gilded, foul-mouthed souls are just as myopic {{when it comes to}} their own table mates (and for that matter, their food), with conversations that usually connect only on the surface, if there." [...] On its surface the play may appear to have fewer overtly political resonances than some of the plays from the 1980s and 1990s; but its central male characters, brothers named Lambert and Matt, are members of the elite (like the men in charge in Party Time), who describe themselves as [...] "peaceful strategy consultants [...] we don't carry guns." [...] At the next table, Russell, a banker, describes himself as a [...] "totally disordered personality... a psychopath," [...] while Lambert [...] "vows to be reincarnated as ' more civilised, [...] gentler person, [...] nicer person'." [...] These characters' deceptively smooth exteriors mask their extreme viciousness. [...] Celebration evokes familiar Pinteresque political contexts: [...] "The ritzy loudmouths in 'Celebration'... and the quieter working-class mumblers of 'The Room'... have everything in common beneath the surface". [...] "Money remains in the service of entrenched power, and the brothers in the play are 'strategy consultants' whose jobs involve force and violence... It is tempting but inaccurate to equate the comic power inversions of the social behavior in Celebration with lasting change in larger political structures", according to Grimes, for whom the play indicates Pinter's pessimism about the <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>changing</b> the status quo. [...] Yet, as the Waiter's often comically unbelievable reminiscences about his grandfather demonstrate in Celebration, Pinter's final stage plays also extend some expressionistic aspects of his earlier [...] "memory plays", while harking back to his [...] "comedies of menace", as illustrated in the characters and in the Waiter's final speech: ...|$|E

She had known his faults and weaknesses, and was probably aware that he was inferior to herself in character and intellect. But, nevertheless, she had loved him. To her he had been, though not heroic, sufficiently a man to win her heart. He was a gentleman, pleasant-mannered, pleasant to look at, pleasant to talk to, not educated in the high sense of the word, but never making himself ridiculous by ignorance. He was the very antipodes of a Spooner, and he was,--or rather had been,--her lover. She did not wish to change. She did not recognise the <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>changing.</b> Though she had told him that he might go if he pleased, to her his going would be the loss of everything.

6000|$|While agreeing {{generally}} with Professor Huxley's remarks [...] respecting miracles, in [...] "The Agnostic Annual for 1892," [...] it [...] {{has seemed}} to me that one of his arguments at least requires [...] qualification. The Professor, in maintaining that so-called [...] miraculous events are possible, although the evidence [...] adduced is not sufficient to render them probable, refers to [...] the <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>changing</b> water into wine by molecular [...] recomposition. He tells us that, [...] "if carbon can be got out [...] of hydrogen or oxygen, the conversion of water into wine [...] comes within range of scientific possibility." [...] But in [...] maintaining that miracles (so-called) have a prospective [...] possibility, Professor Huxley loses sight--at least, so it [...] appears to me--of the question of their retrospective [...] possibility. For, if it requires a certain degree of [...] knowledge and experience, yet far from having been attained, [...] to perform those acts which have been called miraculous, it [...] is not only improbable, but impossible likewise, that they [...] should have been done by men whose knowledge and experience [...] were considerably less than our own. It {{has seemed to}} me, in [...] fact, that this question of the retrospective possibility of [...] miracles is more important to us Rationalists, and, for the [...] matter of that, to Christians also, than the question of [...] their prospective possibility, with which Professor Huxley's [...] article mainly deals. Perhaps the Professor himself could [...] help those of us who think so, by giving us his opinion.|$|E
