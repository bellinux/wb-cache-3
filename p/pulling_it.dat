5|$|The Millennium Group, {{a private}} investigative group, dispatches {{profiler}} Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) to the scene, where he meets Seattle detective Bob Bletcher (Bill Smitrovich). Black finds the house's alarm system, noticing {{that it did}} not go off until the killer left the house. He deduces that the killer stayed hidden in the house during the viewing, emerging that evening to kill the family. However, Black also notices something near an air vent; <b>pulling</b> <b>it</b> from the wall, he finds Patricia, alive but greatly disturbed.|$|E
5|$|Fruit eating, or frugivory, {{is found}} in both major suborders. Bats prefer ripe fruit, <b>pulling</b> <b>it</b> off the trees with their teeth. They fly back to their roosts to eat the fruit, sucking out the juice and {{spitting}} the seeds and pulp out onto the ground. This helps disperse the seeds of these fruit trees, which may take root and grow where the bats have left them, and numerous species of plants depend on bats for seed dispersal. The Jamaican fruit bat (Artibeus jamaicensis) has been recorded carrying fruits weighing 3–14g (0.11–0.49oz) or even as much as 50g (1.8oz).|$|E

25|$|Yield {{strength}} testing involves {{taking a}} small sample with a fixed cross-section area, and then <b>pulling</b> <b>it</b> with a controlled, gradually increasing force until the sample changes shape or breaks. This is called a Tensile Test. Longitudinal and/or transverse strain is recorded using mechanical or optical extensometers.|$|E
25|$|Steered {{molecular}} dynamics (SMD) simulations, or force probe simulations, apply forces to a protein {{in order to}} manipulate its structure by <b>pulling</b> <b>it</b> along desired degrees of freedom.

25|$|Note 1: According to Breton legend, St Thégonnec's cart was {{attacked}} by wolves who ate the stag <b>pulling</b> <b>it.</b> He was using the cart to carry stones used to build his church.

25|$|Two {{types of}} molds, namely single-piece mold and multi-piece mold, are {{frequently}} {{used to produce}} mold-blown vessels. The former allows the finished glass object to be removed in one movement by <b>pulling</b> <b>it</b> upwards from the single-piece mold and is largely employed to produce tableware and utilitarian vessels for storage and transportation. Whereas the latter is made in multi-paneled mold segments that join together, thus permitting {{the development of more}} sophisticated surface modeling, texture and design.|$|E
25|$|Henrietta Maria {{remained}} {{sympathetic to}} her fellow Catholics and, in 1632, began {{construction of a}} new Catholic chapel at Somerset House. The old chapel had been deeply unpopular amongst Protestants, and there had been much talk amongst London apprentices of <b>pulling</b> <b>it</b> down as an anti-Catholic gesture. Although modest externally, Henrietta Maria's chapel was much more elaborate inside and was opened in a particularly grand ceremony in 1636. The result was great alarm amongst many in the Protestant community.|$|E
25|$|The reach method, (or hose trace method), is {{the most}} {{reliable}} as it will work in all cases where the DV is not snagged somewhere. The diver reaches back over the right shoulder to the low pressure hose feeding the DV, and loops thumb and fingers round the hose, then slides the hand along the hose, <b>pulling</b> <b>it</b> forward and over the shoulder until the DV is in the right hand, at which stage it can be turned the right way round and replaced in the mouth.|$|E

25|$|The {{invention}} of the vacuum pump {{paved the way for}} the experiments of Robert Boyle and Robert Hooke into the nature of vacuum and atmospheric pressure. The first such device was made by Otto von Guericke in 1654. It consisted of a piston and an air gun cylinder with flaps that could suck the air from any vessel that it was connected to. In 1657, he pumped the air out of two conjoined hemispheres and demonstrated that a team of sixteen horses were incapable of <b>pulling</b> <b>it</b> apart. The air pump construction was greatly improved by Robert Hooke in 1658.|$|E
25|$|The French ship Scipion (80 guns), behind Rigny's Sirène (60), {{immediately}} {{came under}} intense attack, {{by a combination}} of Egyptian frigates on both sides, the shore batteries and a fireship. The latter was nearly fatal. The fireship jammed under Scipions bowsprit, the fore sails caught fire and the fire spread onto the upper gun-deck. Men flung themselves on the fire to prevent it spreading to the forward powder magazine, with inevitable horrendous burn injuries. Nevertheless, the gunners continued to fire on the attackers. Scipion was saved from destruction by her sister ship Trident (74), which succeeded in attaching a tow-line to the fireship and, with the assistance of Dartmouth and two other British boats, <b>pulling</b> <b>it</b> clear.|$|E
25|$|My first well-remembered {{intentional}} use of {{the double}} bind occurred in early boyhood. One winter day, with the weather below zero, my father led a calf {{out of the barn}} to the water trough. After the calf had satisfied its thirst, they turned back to the barn, but at the doorway the calf stubbornly braced its feet, and despite my father's desperate pulling on the halter, he could not budge the animal. I was outside playing in the snow and, observing the impasse, began laughing heartily. My father challenged me to pull the calf into the barn. Recognizing the situation as one of unreasoning stubborn resistance {{on the part of the}} calf, I decided to let the calf have full opportunity to resist, since that was what it apparently wished to do. Accordingly I presented the calf with a double bind by seizing it by the tail and <b>pulling</b> <b>it</b> away from the barn, while my father continued to pull it inward. The calf promptly chose to resist the weaker of the two forces and dragged me into the barn. Reprinted in Collected Papers Volume 3.|$|E

25|$|Prey {{is killed}} by hitting {{it with the}} hooked beak, aiming for the skull in vertebrates. If too large to swallow in {{one or a few}} chunks, it is transported to a feeding site by {{carrying}} it in the beak or (if too large) in the feet. The feet are not suited for tearing up prey, however. It is rather impaled upon a sharp point – thorns or the barbs of barbed wire – or wedged firmly between forking branches. Thus secured, the food can be ripped into bite-sized pieces with the beak. Orthoptera that the birds have recognized as containing noxious chemicals are left impaled in the larder for several days, until the chemicals that usually deter predators have been degraded. Great grey shrikes have also been observed to impale common toads (Bufo bufo) and skin them – by ripping open the back skin and <b>pulling</b> <b>it</b> over the head – to avoid contamination of the meat by the toxic skin secretions. Large bones and similar inedible parts of prey animals are usually not ingested, but smaller ones such as tiny bones or the elytra of beetles are eaten and later regurgitated as pellets.|$|E
500|$|After {{killing their}} prey, tigers {{sometimes}} drag it to conceal it in vegetative cover, usually <b>pulling</b> <b>it</b> by grasping with their mouths {{at the site}} of the killing bite.

[...] However, major Russian broadcasters rejected the ad due to concerns over its possible insinuation that the Whopper was better than drugs, as red poppies {{are in the same}} plant family as the source of heroin.

500|$|Broussard {{reported}} in a January 2006 interview that many of Duke Nukem Forevers elements had been finished; [...] "we're just basically <b>pulling</b> <b>it</b> all together {{and trying to make}} it fun". Later that year Broussard demonstrated samples of the game, including an early level, a vehicle sequence, and a few test rooms. Among the features seen was the interactive use of an in-game computer to send actual e-mails. The developer seemed contrite and affected by the long delays; while a journalist demoed the game Broussard referenced note cards and constantly apologized for the state of the game. In filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, Take-Two revealed they had renegotiated the Duke Nukem Forever deal, with the former publisher receiving $4.25million instead of $6million on release of the game. Take-Two offered a $500,000 bonus if Duke Nukem Forever was commercially released by December 31, 2006. However, Broussard denied the rumors that DNF would be released, saying that 3D Realms never cared for or asked for the bonus. He stated that he would [...] "never ship a game early." ...|$|E
