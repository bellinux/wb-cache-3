Literature still refers to <b>power</b> <b>meters</b> of bolometer type, instruments that are mainly used almost only in the primary laboratories. Definitions, procedures, and calibration techniques elaborated for this instrument type must be adjusted before being applied to actual <b>power</b> <b>meters,</b> which work on different principles. Otherwise, inconsistent calibration results may be produced. This paper is aimed to ease the work of the laboratories that perform <b>power</b> <b>meter</b> calibrations from dc to 50 GHz, by elaborating on some technical aspect not well considered in the specialized literature...|$|R

40|$|Virtualization {{is often}} used in cloud {{computing}} platforms for its several advantages in efficiently managing resources. However, virtualization raises certain additional challenges, {{and one of them}} is lack of <b>power</b> <b>metering</b> for virtual machines (VMs). Power management requirements in modern data centers have led to most new servers providing power usage measurement in hardware and alternate solutions exist for older servers using circuit and outlet level measurements. However, VM power cannot be measured purely in hardware. We present a solution for VM <b>power</b> <b>metering,</b> named Joulemeter. We build power models to infer power consumption from resource usage at runtime and identify the challenges that arise when applying such models for VM <b>power</b> <b>metering.</b> We show how existing instrumentation in server hardware and hypervisors can be used to build the required power models on real platforms with low error. Our approach is designed to operate with extremely low runtime overhead while providing practically useful accuracy. We illustrate the use of the proposed metering capability for VM power capping, a technique to reduce power provisioning costs in data centers. Experiments are performed on server traces from several thousand production servers, hosting Microsoft’s realworld applications such as Windows Live Messenger. The results show that not only does VM <b>power</b> <b>metering</b> allow virtualized data centers to achieve the same savings that non-virtualized data centers achieved through physical server power capping, but also that it enables further savings in provisioning costs with virtualization...|$|E

40|$|Abstract − Technical {{irregularities}} {{found in}} electrical <b>power</b> <b>meters</b> due to tampering, which {{are classified as}} fraud, {{are responsible for the}} most part of the energy loss experienced in the sector of electrical power distribution. The cost of energy theft is shared with all consumers in the form of non-technical losses. This work suits that context, by means of combating fraud in electric <b>power</b> <b>meters</b> in order to reduce losses due to the strengthening of effective punishment of cheaters. For that is proposed a systematization model of the process for verification of irregularities in electric <b>power</b> <b>meters</b> and the respective issuance of audit reports.

40|$|AC power meters {{require both}} {{voltage and current}} to be sampled {{concurrently}} to obtain real, reactive, and apparent power. Typically, the two measurements are taken in close physical proximity and fed into a single <b>power</b> <b>metering</b> device. In this paper, we explore the viability of decoupling the voltage and current channels, and placing them in physically disparate locations. Such decoupling could ease the installation of metering infrastructure and enable new sensing scenarios. However, decoupling the voltage and current channels raises a new question: how should they be recombined? Of the various approaches, we propose the voltage channel be virtualized: a voltage sensor measures the voltage magnitude, frequency, and phase, typically near the root of a circuit branch. The extracted phase is time-stamped relative to a global clock and disseminated wirelessly, along with the magnitude and frequency measurements, to power meters throughout the network. The power meters synthesize a suitably scaled replica of the voltage waveform locally, based on the parameters reported by the voltage sensor, and combine it with locally-measured current readings. This paper demonstrates – through empirical characterization of the line voltages, a proof-of-concept power meter implementation, and house-scale evaluation – that the design holds promise and offers substantially lower measurement errors than other distributed <b>power</b> <b>metering</b> approaches for non-resistive loads...|$|E

5000|$|<b>Power</b> <b>meters</b> provide instant {{feedback}} to the rider about their performance and measure their actual output; heart rate monitors measure the physiological effect of effort and therefore ramp up more slowly. Thus, an athlete performing [...] "interval" [...] training while using a <b>power</b> <b>meter</b> can instantly {{see that they are}} producing 300 watts, for example, instead of waiting for their heart rate to climb to a certain point. In addition, <b>power</b> <b>meters</b> measure the force that moves the bike forward multiplied by the velocity, which is the desired goal. This has two significant advantages over heart rate monitors: 1) An athlete's heart rate may remain constant over the training period, yet their power output is declining, which they cannot detect with a heart rate monitor; 2) While an athlete who is not rested or not feeling entirely well may train at their normal heart rate, they are unlikely to be producing their normal power—a heart rate monitor will not reveal this, but a <b>power</b> <b>meter</b> will. Further, <b>power</b> <b>meters</b> enable riders to experiment with cadence and evaluate its effect relative to speed and heart rate.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Power meters are {{critical}} for submetering loads in residential and commercial settings, but high installation cost and complexity hamper their broader adoption. Recent approaches address installation burdens by proposing non-invasive meters that easily clip onto a wire, or stick onto a circuit breaker, to perform contactless metering. Unfortunately, these designs require regular maintenance (e. g. battery replacement) or reduce measurement accuracy (e. g. work poorly with non-unity power factors). This paper presents Gemini, a new design point in the <b>power</b> <b>metering</b> space. Gemini addresses the drawbacks of prior approaches by decoupling and distributing the AC voltage and current measurement acquisitions, and recombining them wirelessly using a low-bandwidth approach, to offer non-invasive real, reactive, and apparent <b>power</b> <b>metering.</b> Battery maintenance is eliminated by using an energy-harvesting design that enables the meter to power itself using a current transformer. Accuracy is substantially improved over other non-invasive meters by virtualizing the voltage channel—effectively allowing the meter to calculate power {{as if it could}} directly measure voltage (since true power requires sample-by-sample multiplication of current and voltage measurements acquired with tight timing constraints). Collectively, these improvements result in a new design point that meters resistive loads with 0. 6 W average error and a range of reactive and switching loads with 2. 2 W average error—matching commercial, mains-powered solutions.
