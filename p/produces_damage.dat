25|$|There is {{a direct}} {{correlation}} between the geographic distribution of ultraviolet radiation (UVR) {{and the distribution of}} indigenous skin pigmentation around the world. Areas that receive higher amounts of UVR, generally located closer to the equator, tend to have darker-skinned populations. Areas that are far from the tropics and closer to the poles have lower intensity of UVR, which is reflected in lighter-skinned populations. Researchers suggest that human populations over the past 50,000 years have changed from dark-skinned to light-skinned and vice versa as they migrated to different UV zones, and that such major changes in pigmentation may have happened in as little as 100 generations (≈2,500 years) through selective sweeps. Natural skin color can also darken as a result of tanning due to exposure to sunlight. The leading theory is that skin color adapts to intense sunlight irradiation to provide partial protection against the ultraviolet fraction that <b>produces</b> <b>damage</b> and thus mutations in the DNA of the skin cells. In addition, it has been observed that adult human females on average are significantly lighter in skin pigmentation than males. Females need more calcium during pregnancy and lactation. The body synthesizes vitamin D from sunlight, which helps it absorb calcium. Females evolved to have lighter skin so their bodies absorb more calcium.|$|E

To differentiate between tornado damage and damage from a downburst, the term straight-line winds is applied to damage from microbursts.|$|R
40|$|Neutron induced {{ionisation}} {{damage in}} MOS capacitor and MOSFET structures {{has been studied}} As neutron radiation processes are always accompanied by gamma radiation, which <b>produces</b> <b>damage</b> on its own, {{it is necessary to}} account for the damage produced by the accompanying gamma rays from neutron radiation. Therefore, devices were subjected to neutron radiation in a swimming pool type of reactor and other samples from the same batch were exposed to an equivalent accompanying gamma radiation using a Co- 60 source. The difference in the damage observed was used to characterize the damage due to neutrons alone. It is observed that neutrons, even though uncharged, are capable of causing ionisation damage in the gate oxide which is significant when the radiation is performed under biased conditions. It is believed that neutron induced ionization damage is essentially due to secondary process of recoils...|$|E
30|$|The {{success of}} any {{laboratory}} corrosion experiments {{depends largely on}} the ability of simulating field damage through an accelerated corrosion regime. In the field, significant corrosion damage is generated as a result of small percentage steel loss. In the laboratory, however, only minimal corrosion damage is generated as a result of high percentage steel loss. An ideal accelerated corrosion regime will not only produce the necessary damage within the required time frame, but <b>produces</b> <b>damage</b> that is consistent with that found in the field. This paper presents the evaluation of two different accelerated corrosion regimes: constant voltage and constant current to identify which of the two techniques provides a closer damage simulation to that in the field. As research work on corrosion is still being conducted to date using both techniques, the outcome of the present study will impact future research work in this field.|$|E

40|$|The {{amphetamine}} analogue 3, 4 -methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or >Ecstasy>) is {{a popular}} drug of abuse which causes different neurotoxic effects in the mouse compared with the rat. In mice, MDMA <b>produces</b> <b>damage</b> to striatal dopamine terminals, having little long-term effects on serotonin (5 -HT) containing neurons. A relevant feature of the striatum is its striosome/matrix compartmental organization; defined by different connexions, and functions. In this study we examined the long-term effect induced by MDMA on tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and dopamine transporter (DAT) immunoreactivity in the striosomes and matrix compartments of mouse striatum. Mice given MDMA showed significant reductions in TH and DAT immunostaining in striatum compared with control animals. Interestingly, this effect was considerably more pronounced in striosomes than in the matrix. These data provide the first evidence that striosomes and matrix compartments of the mouse striatum have differential vulnerability to MDMA and that the long-term neurotoxicity induced by MDMA in mice is primarily associated {{with a loss of}} striosomal dopamine fibres. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

40|$|Abstract:The {{intrinsic}} {{relationships between}} energy dissipation, energy release, strength and abrupt structural failure {{are key to}} understanding the evolution of deformational processes in rocks. Theoretical and experimental studies confirm that energy {{plays an important role}} in rock deformation and failure. Dissipated energy from external forces <b>produces</b> <b>damage</b> and irreversible deformation within rock and decreases rock strength over time. Structural failure of rocks is caused by an abrupt release of strain energy that manifests as a catastrophic breakdown of the rock under certain conditions. The strain energy released in the rock volume plays a pivotal role in generating this abrupt structural failure in the rocks. In this paper, we propose criteria governing (1) the deterioration of rock strength based on energy dissipation and (2) the abrupt structural failure of rocks based on energy release. The critical stresses at the time of abrupt structural failure under various stress states can be determined by these criteria. As an example, the criteria have been used to analyze the failure conditions of surrounding rock of a circular tunnel...|$|E

40|$|International audienceStroke is a {{major cause}} of {{morbidity}} and mortality but the brain and other relevant tissues are often examined only cursorily when stroke patients come to autopsy. The pathological findings and clinical implications vary according to the type of stroke, its location and cause. Large ischaemic strokes are usually associated with atherosclerosis of extracranial or major intracranial arteries but can be caused by dissection. Most small cerebral infarcts are caused by arteriosclerosis or, in the elderly, cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). However, vasculitides and coagulopathies can cause a range of different patterns of ischaemic (and, occasionally, haemorrhagic) stroke. Global brain ischaemia, caused by severe hypotension or raised intracranial pressure, <b>produces</b> <b>damage</b> that is accentuated in certain regions and neuronal populations and may be confused with hypoglycaemic injury. The main cause of subarachnoid haemorrhage is a ruptured berry aneurysm but CAA, arteriovenous malformations and infective aneurysms are occasionally responsible. These can also cause parenchymal brain haemorrhage, although this most often complicates hypertensive small vessel disease. Sometimes the haemorrhage arises from a neoplasm. Performing an adequate autopsy in stroke requires proper preparation, awareness of the likely pathological processes, familiarity with intracranial vascular anatomy, careful gross examination and dissection, and appropriate use of histology...|$|E
40|$|Presented at the 47 th US Rock Mechanics/Geomechanics Symposium of the American Rock Mechanics Association (ARMA), San Francisco, CA, June 23 - 25 2013. Copyright © 2013 by the American Rock Mechanics AssociationA {{thermodynamic}} {{framework is}} proposed {{to model the}} coupled effects of mechanical and thermal stresses in rocks. The model is based on Continuum Damage Mechanics with damage defined as the second-order crack density tensor. The free energy of damaged rock is expressed {{as a function of}} deformation, temperature, and damage. The damage criterion controls mode I crack propagation, captures temperature-induced decrease of rock toughness, and accounts for the increase of energy release rate necessary to propagate cracks in a damaged medium. Two loading paths have been simulated: (1) increase of ambient temperature followed by a triaxial compression test, (2) triaxial compression test followed by a confined heating phase. Results show that: (1) under anisotropic mechanical boundary conditions, heating <b>produces</b> <b>damage,</b> (2) higher temperature induces larger damage and deformation, (3) degradation of rock toughness due to an increase in temperature affects the damage threshold. The proposed framework is expected to bring new insights in the design and reliability assessment of geotechnical reservoirs and repositories, such as nuclear waste disposals, geothermal systems, carbon dioxide sequestration systems, and high-pressure gas reservoirs...|$|E
40|$|Each of {{the four}} agents, ovomucoid, dextran, 48 / 80, and testis extract, when {{injected}} beneath {{the skin of the}} dorsa of the paws of rats produces a local vascular injury characterized by a protein-rich edema. Each agent also <b>produces</b> <b>damage</b> to mast cells. Either 5 -hydroxytryptamine or histamine produces a response similar in the gross to that elicited by the agents which damage mast cells; however, neither of these two agents produces mast cell damage. On a weight basis 5 -hydroxytryptamine is a much more potent edema-producing agent than histamine. The edema-producing action of 5 -hydroxytryptamine can be differentiated from the similar action of histamine by the use of specific antagonists; dibenamine is a 5 -hydroxytryptamine antagonist and pyrilamine a histamine antagonist. The edema produced by the mast cell-damaging agents is partially inhibited by dibenamine but is not diminished by pyrilamine. It is completely inhibited by treatment of rats with both drugs. The drugs which inhibit edema do not prevent mast cell damage by ovomucoid, dextran, 48 / 80, or testis extract. The observations are consistent with the hypothesis that agents which damage mast cells, "release" both 5 -hydroxytryptamine and histamine and that in the rat the edema associated with mast cell damage is mediated largely by 5 -hydroxytryptamine...|$|E
