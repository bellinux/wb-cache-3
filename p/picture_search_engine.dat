40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} <b>picture</b> <b>search</b> <b>engine</b> for life science {{literature}} and show {{how it can be}} used to improve literature preselection. This preselection is needed as a way to compensate for the vast amounts of literature that are available. While searching for DNA binding sites for example, we wanted to add the results of specific experiments (DNAse I footprint and EMSA) to our database. The preselection via abstract search was very unspecific (150 000 hits), but by looking for paper with images concerning the experiments, we could improve precision immensely. They are displayed like hits in a search engine, allowing easy and quick quality assessment without having to read through the whole paper. The images are found by their annotation in the paper: the figure caption. To identify that, we analyse the layout of the paper: the position of the image and the surrounding text. ...|$|E

Current articles about <b>search</b> <b>engine</b> optimization and Google are indicating that with the proper use of quality content, there is potential to improve <b>search</b> <b>engine</b> rankings. However, the existing <b>search</b> <b>engine</b> optimization literature is not noticing content at a sufficient level.

In this paper, we consider a different measure for <b>search</b> <b>engines,</b> namely the quality of the pages in a <b>search</b> <b>engine</b> index.

The more pages in an engine's index, the better was its claim for being the most comprehensive, and therefore the best, <b>search</b> <b>engine.</b> Because <b>search</b> <b>engine</b> size is a simple (and, especially in advertising, an effective) comparison metric, it is important to devise objective methods for determining, at least approximately, <b>search</b> <b>engine</b> sizes without depending on the figures provided by the <b>search</b> <b>engines</b> themselves.
