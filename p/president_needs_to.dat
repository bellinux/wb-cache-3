5000|$|As {{a result}} of this report, a {{petition}} was presented to the Chamber of Deputies by citizens Barbosa Lima Sobrinho and Marcelo Lavenère Machado, respectively the then President of the Brazilian Press Association and the then President of the Brazilian Bar Association, formally accusing President Collor of having committed crimes of responsibility (the Brazilian equivalent of [...] "high crimes and misdemeanors") warranting removal from office per the constitutional and legal norms regulating impeachment proceedings. In Brazil, the formal petition asking for the impeachment of the <b>President</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> be submitted by citizens, not by corporations or public institutions. On that formal petition, submitted on September 1, 1992, impeachment proceedings were initiated in the Chamber of Deputies, the lower house of Congress. A special committee of the Chamber of Deputies was constituted on September 3, 1992 to study the impeachment petition. On September 24, 1992, the committee voted (32 votes in favour, one vote against, one abstention) to approve a report accepting the impeachment petition and recommending that the full Chamber of Deputies should accept the charges of impeachment. Under the Constitution of Brazil, the impeachment process would only proceed if two thirds of the Chamber of Deputies voted to allow the charges of impeachment to be presented to the Senate. On September 29, 1992, Collor was impeached by the Chamber of Deputies, with more than two thirds of its members concurring. In the decisive roll call vote, 441 deputies voted for and 38 deputies voted against the admission of the charges of impeachment.|$|E

40|$|Vitalization of {{internal}} organization {{of a firm}} varies {{in terms of its}} concept and method depending on the adaptation of the firm's main products to the industrial environment. In the case where a firm is enjoying a steady growth with its main products adapted well to changes in the industrial structure, the firm may be vitalized by enhancing the employees' challenging spirit. There are many ways to do this: flat organization; `philosophy of praise' by the top management; improvement of personnel rating system, etc. There are other cases where the growth is stagnant even though the main products are well adapted to changes in the environment, probably {{because of the lack of}} proper management activity. In such a case the <b>president</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> take the lead in revolutionizing the awareness of the employees through infiltration of the sense of crisis, declaration of a lofty business goal, and president's visits at worksites. If a firm's growth is retarded due to the failure of its main products in adapting to changes in the industrial structure, restructuring of the firm is necessary.

40|$|The {{best thing}} Obama {{can do in}} this speech is to reassert his {{relevance}} by speaking frankly about the economy, stressing his awareness of the problems more than the bills he has passed since becoming president. He also can use this speech not as an opportunity to, yet again, recommit himself to reaching across the aisle {{and working with the}} Republicans, but to remind the Congress and the country that Obama is the one nationally-elected official and that he remains more popular than either party in congress. He can do this by challenging the Republican Party, not to support Obama's agenda, but to work with him in putting partisan interests aside in favor of doing what is good for the country. The <b>president</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> demonstrate to the American people and to Congress that he is a leader and is going to act like one.

40|$|When President Obama {{came to the}} White House and put his appointees in place, {{they faced}} a long to-do list. For the {{preceding}} eight years, the dominant view within the Executive Branch had been that health, safety, and environmental regulation was a nuisance to business, cutting into industry profits in service of objectives {{that had never been}} part of President George W. Bush’s agenda. By the time Bush II left office on January 20, 2009, little had been done and a lot of important safeguards had been rolled back. Crucial rules mandated by Congress were delayed or derailed, and enforcement was a shadow of its former self. The Obama Administration came to power promising to reinvigorate protections for public health, worker and consumer safety, and the environment; and, indeed, the Administration has made important progress on several fronts. But the President’s first term in office is more than half over, and too much remains to be done. To fulfill the promises he made to the American people, prevent further catastrophes, and save American industry from its own short-sighted opportunism, the <b>President</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> exhort his Cabinet, his political appointees, and the White House staff to get crucial things done. This report identifies 12 such regulatory safeguards, a collection that {{in the view of the}} authors represents the 12 most critical environmental, health, and safety regulations still in the pipeline. Too many of them are in serious danger of being stuck in the pipeline long after January 20, 2013. In particular, for nine of these 12 most critical rules, the Administration is currently on a trajectory that makes it possible, even likely, that it will not complete work on the regulation by the end of the President’s first term. Such an outcome would be particularly distressing because it would not be the consequence of congressional interference or other political opposition, but a flat out failure of the Administration to get its work done in a timely manner – a straightforward unforced error with potentially huge consequences. The report says that three factors will play an outsized role in whether the Administration finishes in time: delays from the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, needlessly protracted deliberations by the agencies themselves, and pressure from anti-regulatory interests...|$|E
50|$|Prior to World War II, {{overseas}} and cross-country presidential travel was rare.

Congress was constitutionally provided the power to declare the war, but if the <b>president</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> send the troops to other countries for emergency reasons, approved statutes required the notification of Congress within forty-eight hours.

40|$|This study {{attempts}} {{to analyze the}} success and failures of international technology transfer projects of Ministry of Agriculture. An international technology transfer concepts, supporting factors and how transfer is taking place has been reviewed comprehensively. An international technology transfer projects implemented {{in the past have}} not been very successful due to selection of inappropriate technology, selection of incorrect technology supplier and lack of commitment by the transferee. The author of this dissertation uses a combined conceptual model, which is a combination of the concepts of technology capability enhancement, polytrophic components of technology, stage- gate model and seven factors, and a model of technology diffusion to analyze the success and failures of the projects in detail and found that the application is successful. The transferor's dominant role in grant aid projects has prevented the opportunities of transferee to enhance the technological capabilities up to the required level. On the other hand, transferee has performed a very poor role in the acquisition process of the technology. Other main contributory factors for not reaching the required level had been lack of knowledge and capabilities in modern technologies, and low level of commitment and poor performance of the transferee. Inadequate technology transfer has made this situation further serious, as transferee is a dependent on the transferor for various components and they are very costly. It was also noted that the transferor is selling technologies belonging to other companies and acting as a "technology broker" rather than playing the role of committed transferor. Therefore, identification of a transferor, whose motivation and role in the foreign assisted international technology transfer projects, is much more important than simply making use of the funds offered. Present guidelines and regulations enforced for the procurement of goods and services do not focus on the technological aspects to guide for successful technological transfer. As such, National Procurement Agency, which is currently under the <b>President,</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> prepare a "comprehensive check list" for the evaluation and selection of technology suppliers and a "Steering Committee" to implement international technology transfer projects. This steering committee is in addition to the technical evaluation committee and the tender board. This concept would bring more successful and justifiable results for the investment. Any successful TT project does not necessarily produce effective knowledge transfer, unless it is effectively disseminate to stake holders, as they are independent processes. The data of Sri Lanka Integrated Survey confirms that by 1999 - 2000, only about 13 % of agricultural households received technical assistance from a government extension agent, and landless and marginal farmers appeared even more handicapped in accessing extension services. The conceptual model of technology transfer has three broad categories surrounding the core technology. Needs assessment {{is the first step in}} determining the needs and requirements of a new or modified technology to be transferred. Secondly, the implementation process elements are vehicles that facilitate technology transfer and is noted that many international technology transfers fail at the implementation stage. The diffusion process is the final stage where individuals or groups of people decide whether or not to adopt and use the new technology. In most developing nations, given their traditional and cultural orientations, the role of the government and opinion leaders is paramount to successful diffusion of any new technology. It is concluded that the linkages and interactions between technology developers, implementation process, and diffusion activity plan, mere producing an effective transfer of new technologies to grass root levels. Dissemination is a collaborative activity, which involves set of actors, activities, organizations and institutions. The end users are varied in terms of their age, gender, ethnicity, education level, income level, and farming activity, hence diffusion of knowledge is very critical. Therefore, technologies which are very close to the end users needs and wants are quickly diffused. Agricultural extension is a systematic process which transferring knowledge from researches to farmers on numerous matters...|$|E
