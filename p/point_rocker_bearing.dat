40|$|Steel <b>point</b> {{and line}} <b>rocker</b> <b>bearings</b> {{are used in}} civil engineering, {{especially}} in bridge construction. Technical literature does not provide any data of the rolling-off resistance in the rocker parts of such bearings. Therefore the experimental determination of this resistance was the main objective of this research project. Using a special tilting device, tests were conducted on <b>point</b> <b>rocker</b> sliding <b>bearings</b> with pressure contact plates of steel St 52 and stainless steel whereby the level of loading (Hertzian stress in the contact surfaces) and the thickness' of the contact components were varied. The rolling-off resistance at rocker's maximum rotation of tan a= 0. 01 were calculated from the measured results and presented in diagrams. Also permanent deformations of the contact plates were measured. In addition the Hertzian formulas and the material stress' for point contact were described in more detail. Rolling-off and rolling resistance were compared using empirically derived formulas. Test results show the following: The rolling-off resistance is influenced significantly by the Hertzian stress' in the contact surfaces, the material quality, the level of preloading, plastic deformations and thickness of the contact components {{as well as the}} rotation angle. Contrary to present regulations, not only the geometric excentricity but also the rolling-off resistance should be taken into account when Hertzian stress' in the contact surface are significantly higher than those at local yielding of the contact plates. According to the present state of knowledge, the permissible Hertzian stress' given in different standards should be reduced for <b>rocker</b> <b>bearings.</b> As for roller bearings, the permissible contact pressure should be correlated with the amount of the rolling-off resistance. At the tilting angles investigated, the rolling-off resistance of <b>rocker</b> <b>bearings</b> is significantly smaller than the rolling resistance of roller bearings. The rolling-off resistance was experimentally determined {{for the first time with}} the investigations presented here. In view of the numerous factors of influence, several questions could not be answered in a complete and final manner. (orig.)

50|$|A {{bridge bearing}} is a {{component}} of a bridge which typically provides a resting surface between bridge piers and the bridge deck. The purpose of a bearing is to allow controlled movement and thereby reduce the stresses involved. Movement could be thermal expansion or contraction, or movement from other sources such as seismic activity. There are several different types of bridge bearings which are used depending {{on a number of}} different factors including the bridge span. The oldest form of bridge bearing is simply two plates resting on top of each other. A common form of modern bridge bearing is the elastomeric bridge bearing. Another type of bridge bearing is the mechanical bridge bearing. There are several types of mechanical bridge bearing, such as the pinned bearing, which in turn includes specific types such as the <b>rocker</b> <b>bearing,</b> and the roller bearing. Another type of mechanical bearing is the fixed bearing, which allows rotation, but not other forms of movement.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Tension <b>rocker</b> <b>bearing</b> (TRB) cables {{installed}} at auxiliary piers were critical members {{to sustain the}} structural system in a prestressed concrete cable-stayed bridge. Once these cables fractured or broken, its structural system would be transferred. Based on diseases caused by fracture of TRB cables in Yonghe Bridge, corresponding maintenance or strengthening measures were described in detail. These measures included replacement of TRB cables, strengthening of the closure segment of main girder at each side span, and adjustment of stay cable forces. Monitoring results showed that, its structural system was finally and completely rehabilitated, and the safety factor of new TRB cables is enough under the most unfavorable load combination. Moreover, the line shape of main girder and the inclined displacement {{at the top of}} each pylon were improved effectively. Thus, Yonghe Bridge accumulated some valuable experience for maintenance or strengthening of existing prestressed concrete cable-stayed bridges, and also made a useful exploration...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} failure {{potential of}} U.

Particularly, seismic fragility curves are useful tools because they state the failure probability of structures conditioned on earthquake intensity levels. This study focuses on computationally efficient coupled bridge-soil-foundation (CBSF) analyses and develops fragility curves for multi-span continuous steel bridges (MSCS) typical of the central and eastern U. S. (CEUS) when exposed to earthquake-induced soil liquefaction. The resulting fragility curves show {{an increase in the}} vulnerability of <b>rocker</b> <b>bearings</b> and bent piles. Moreover, {{depending on the type of}} soil layer overlying the liquefiable sand, liquefaction either decreases or increases the fragility of columns, whereas the probability of unseating at the abutments increases when liquefaction is explicitly modeled. Lastly, bridge system fragilities are increased for extensive and complete damage...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{translational}} restraints {{associated to}} pin and <b>rocker</b> <b>bearings</b> are typically idealized {{in the form}} of fixed and free conditions. However, elastomeric bearings need to be represented with springs to reasonably predict the time- and frequency-domain response of bridges under traffic-induced vibrations. Therefore, changes in the response of these bearings are common as a result of aging, deterioration, variation in loading levels and/or environmental changes. The latter makes difficult to discern if changes in the frequency content of the structural response to ambient vibration are due to changes in temperature, changes in normal operational loads or the occurrence of damage. In this paper, the bridge is idealized by a beam model supported on a hysteretic translational sprung support. The purpose is twofold: (a) to gather {{a better understanding of the}} variations of the bridge response with bearing performance; and (b) to be able to quickly identify an anomaly in the bearing. Empirical Mode Decomposition and the Hilbert-Huang Transform are employed to capture changes in the bearing stiffness from the bridge response...|$|R

The pipe {{model is}} {{simplified}} as elastic foundation beam model of Euler-Bernoulli in the paper, the supported form of pin <b>rocker</b> <b>bearing</b> {{in the analysis}} of transverse vibration. Kelvin viscoelastic foundation model is adopted and the dynamic model of soil spring is regarded as nonlinearity. Applying the principle of Hamilton, the differential equation of vibration is deduced. By utilization of the first three-order modal and the orthogoality of main vibration mode, the equations are discreted and transformed into state formulas. The critical flow velocity is obtained using the Matlab software in a typical numerical example. Establishment of Physical Model Because buried pipeline is subjected to constraint of surrounding soil, the difference of dynamic characteristic between buried pipeline and structure is very large. Buried pipeline vibrates with surrounding soil, through stress transferred by soil. The soil is considered as excitation of pipe vibrating, meanwhile it can produce shear stress in the position of pipe interface to prevent pipe from vibrating. So there exists the coupling of two working principle in the pipe-soil system. In order to show that the soil stress under dynamic interaction is undertook by elastic restoring force and viscous damping force, Kelvin viscoelastic foundation model is adopted and the dynamic model of soil sprin...|$|R
40|$|The rapid {{expansion}} of the optical fiber telecommunication industry due to {{the explosion of the}} Internet has substantially driven down the cost of optical components, making fiber optic sensors more economically viable. In addition, the rapid development of fiber-optic sensors, particularly the fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors offers many advantages and capability that could not be achieved otherwise. In the past few years, fiber Bragg grating sensors have attracted a lot of interest and they are being used in numerous applications. This paper describes the FBG sensors developed for structural health monitoring, and were installed on Hong Kong's landmark Tsing Ma bridge (TMB), which is the world longest (1377 m) suspension bridge that carried both railway and regular road traffic. Forty FBG sensors divided into three arrays were installed on the hanger cable, <b>rocker</b> <b>bearing</b> and truss girders of the TMB. The objectives of the study are to investigate the feasibility of using the developed FBG sensors for structural health monitoring, via monitoring the strain of different parts of the TMB under both the railway and highway loads as well as comparing the FBG sensors' performance with the conventional structural health monitoring system - Wind and Structural Health Monitoring System (WASHMS) that has been operating at TMB since the bridge's commissioning in May 1997.

40|$|Historically, due to {{the high}} cost of optical devices, fiber-optics sensor systems were only {{employed}} in niche areas where conventional electrical sensors are not suitable. This scenario changed dramatically {{in the last few years}} following the explosion of the Internet which caused the rapid expansion of the optical fiber telecommunication industry and substantially driven down the cost of optical components. In recent years, fiber-optic sensors and particularly fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors have attracted a lot of interests and are being used in numerous applications. We have conducted several field trials of FBG sensors for railway applications and structural monitoring. About 30 FBG sensors were installed on the rail tracks of Kowloon¬Canton Railway Corp. for train identification and speed measurements and the results obtained show that FBG sensors exhibit very good performance and could play a major role in the realization of "Smart Railway". FBG sensors were also installed on Hong Kong's landmark TsingMa Bridge, which is the world longest suspension bridge (2. 2 km) that carries both trains and regular road traffic. The trials were carried out with a high-speed (up to 20 kHz) interrogation system based on CCD and also with a interrogation unit that based on scanning optical filter (up to 70 Hz). Forty FBGs sensors were divided into 3 arrays and installed on different parts of the bridge (suspension cable, <b>rocker</b> <b>bearing</b> and truss girders). The objectives of the field trial on the TsingMa Bridge are to monitor the strain of different parts of the bridge under railway load and highway load, and to compare the FBG sensors' performance with conventional resistive strain gauges already installed on the bridge.

40|$|The Georgia Department of Transportation {{has been}} {{installing}} steel pedestals on bridges, ranging in height up to 33 ?? (0. 85 m) {{to increase the}} vertical clearance of many multi-span simply-supported and multi-span continuous bridges in Georgia. But there is a concern about the performance of these steel pedestals as they are designed without seismic consideration and may perform poorly compared to high-type steel ?<b>rocker?</b> <b>bearings,</b> which {{were found to be}} unstable supports in previous earthquakes. This research models a candidate bridge using experimental data that captures the force-displacement hysteretic behavior of the steel pedestals. The results show how these steel pedestals behave when subjected to a range of ground motions. Nonlinear time history analysis is conducted using SAP 2000 software on a three-dimensional model of the candidate bridge. In addition, parametric studies of various critical parameters that can affect the seismic performance of the bridge are investigated, such as 1) varying the mass of the structure, 2) varying the stiffness of the deck joint, 3) varying column heights, and 4) seismic retrofitting using cable restrainers. The results show that these pedestals should not be used in regions of high seismicity, and in regions of low seismicity, it is likely {{that they need to be}} retrofitted. They can, although, be used safely in regions of low seismicity. In addition, it was shown that the mass of a superstructure and height of the columns significantly affect the behavior of these steel pedestals, and should be given a careful consideration before usage. It was also shown that the stiffness of the expansion joints does not significantly affect the displacement of the steel pedestals and the forces transmitted to them. However, if the expansion joints are too stiff compared to the adjacent bridge components, then the forces transferred during pounding of superstructure is increased significantly...|$|R

40|$|Steel bridge {{bearings}} {{are widely}} used in existing bridges in the United States to provide a load transfer mechanism and accommodate movements between the superstructure and substructure. Due {{to a lack of}} regular maintenance, the in-situ condition of these steel bearings is often severely corroded. Moreover, these steel bearings are not designed for seismic loads {{due to a lack of}} understanding of the seismic hazard posed to bridges in the Central and Eastern United States (CEUS) at the time that many of these bridges were built. As awareness of their susceptibility to corrosion and vulnerability to seismic loads increases among bridge owners and engineers, the seismic performance of steel bearings and their influence on the overall bridge system performance is of major concern, particularly given the importance the highway network plays in sustaining economic prosperity. For this reason, the goal of this study is to correlate corrosion level with the performance of steel bearings under seismic loads, thereby providing a means of more accurately assessing the vulnerability of in-situ bridges. An analytical and finite element study is first undertaken to gain a preliminary understanding of the mechanical behavior of the considered steel bearings. Corrosion loss quantification and large-scale experimental testing are then conducted on 25 salvaged steel bridge bearings aiming to provide an in-depth understanding of corrosion loss distribution and its influence on the cyclic behavior of steel bearings. Further, a portfolio of constitutive models that incorporate corrosion effects is created for the steel bridge bearings based on the experimental findings. The seismic performance of the steel bearings and the bridge systems is then numerically evaluated considering design basis earthquakes and maximum credible earthquakes. Overall, the findings of this study show that significant corrosion can develop on steel bearings over their service life, which can result in major changes to the cyclic behavior of steel bearings. The numerical simulations suggest that steel <b>rocker</b> <b>bearings,</b> when used in a continuous steel girder bridge, have the potential to topple in the longitudinal direction regardless of corrosion level. The bolster bearings also can lead to large forces transferred to the bridge wall piers...|$|R

40|$|Highway bridges {{function}} as the arteries of our society. Hence, {{it is essential that}} they remain operational following an earthquake. Unfortunately, a significant number of bridges worldwide, including in Canada, were constructed prior to the development of modern seismic design provisions. In many cases, such bridges are expected to perform poorly during earthquakes. According to a report published in 2000 by Ministry of Transportation of Ontario (MTO), in eastern Ontario alone, there are over 70 bridges that are structurally deficient. Current methods to retrofit these bridges to bring them into compliance with the existing codes would entail substantial structural modifications. Examples of such modifications include the replacement of existing <b>rocker</b> <b>bearings</b> with elastomeric bearings, structural strengthening of piers, and enlarging the bearing surfaces. These methods involve substantial cost, effort, and materials. An alternative means to retrofit structurally deficient bridges is investigated in this thesis. This method involves using a combination of elastomeric bearings and fluid dampers to retrofit highway bridges. In principle, these devices work {{in the same way as}} shock absorbers in automobiles. They absorb shock and dissipate the vibration energy to the environment as heat. In the case of bridges, earthquakes impart the shock to the structure. Before these devices can be implemented in practice, there are many issues that need to be understood with respect to their performance and modelling. Moreover, a comparative assessment between popular retrofit options employing isolation systems needs to be undertaken to verify and provide a benchmark to assess their performance. The Mississippi River Bridge near Ottawa is chosen as a test structure to conduct this study. This bridge already contains an advanced isolation system, and has an extensive documentation available for modelling and verification. Various retrofit options will be studied and compared with the existing isolation design for this bridge. In all cases, the effect of soil-structure interaction is included. A comprehensive set of performance indices are used to evaluate the performance of various retrofit options. All the models are constructed in the open source software, OpenSees. The research demonstrates that the proposed approach is a viable retrofit method for highway bridges. Moreover, compared to advanced isolation systems, retrofit using elastomeric bearings with viscous dampers was successful on transferring lower loads to the substructure, and resulted in lower superstructure displacements. Though this study involved one bridge, it has provided a computational test bed to perform further studies and has provided valuable insight into the modeling and performance of retrofit solutions...|$|R

The primary rocker arms are actuated by the secondary (drum attached) rocker arms. The drum will only rotate to advance or retard the position of the secondary rocker arms, to take advantage of their varying profiles. Thus, through varying the position of the drum about its axis, each cam profile is changed to an optimal height for maximum engine performance without sacrificing fuel efficiency at lower speeds.|$|R

5000|$|... "Over-arcing" [...] in this definition's context {{relates to}} one of two variables, {{dictated}} by which of two halves the rocker arm's pivotal axis resides in relation to the ensuing motion. In the strict definition, over-arcing pertains to the pivotal axis residing too low with regard to its starting point of motion, in providing a 90 degree relationship at exactly the mid-lift point of motion; whereby 90 degrees is reached (if ever) at some point AFTER the exact half way point of motion (mid-lift) occurs. In the opposite example to this definition, the rocker arm's pivotal axis sits too high with regard to the starting point (valve tip) of motion, thus effecting a sweep of its radial path that dominates beneath itself, whereby the 90 degree relationship of the linear component's axis (valve and push-rod, respectively) to the tangent <b>points</b> to the <b>rocker</b> arm's pivotal axis is acquired BEFORE the mid-lift point of movement is attained. In this example, the term used is under-arcing. As with over-arcing, the result in wasted motion is the same, but the consequences to the ever changing velocity delivered to the valve, which is dictated by where this 90 degree tangent point occurs, is opposite (in both symptoms and effect) to the phenomena of its counterpart. Although both terms are simple in principle, their consequences to the efficient design and implementation of high performance push-rod driven (and otherwise) valve trains is decisive.|$|R
