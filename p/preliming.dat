This is the first operation of physical and chemical cleaning of the raw juice in the case of it in optimum conditions enables the coagulation and transferred to precipitate a substantial portion of high-molecular non-sugars, poorly soluble calcium salts that provides the cleaning effect of 14 – 18 %, that is, up to half of the total effect on the whole station lime-carbon dioxide purification.

To improve the efficiency of the purification steps juice we have proposed a two-stage carbonation I cleaned juice. Holding two stages I saturation at high pH juice is justified in view of the efficiency of adsorption treatment with calcium carbonate. To quantify the proposed option saturation performed laboratory research on plant juices derived from beet varying quality, with the definition of quality indicators to be cleansed juice at all stages of processing the raw juice in warm <b>preliming,</b> the combined main liming, I and II carbonation. Indicators were evaluated for juice in the sugar industry accepted methods. In comparison with the standard version of the proposed two-stage version of I carbonation with intermediate filtration improves filtration performance carbonated juice on 24 – 26 %, reduce the color of the purified juice to 17 – 23 %, the content of calcium in the 22 – 24 %, improve the overall treatment effect 16 – 19 % (relative).  Improving the quality of the purified juice ensures the production of white sugar of standard quality, an increase in the cleaning effect of diffusion juice reduces the loss of sucrose in the molasses and increases the yield of the final commercial product.

40|$|Summary. According to {{the modern}} {{technology}} of sugar production normative expansion reducing substances in the cleaning diffusion juice, should {{be held in the}} main liming controlled temperature with an excess of lime alkalinity, followed by removal of the decay products have appeared due to the adsorption of calcium carbonate in the processing of juice carbon dioxide. Test data show the growth rate of thermochemical quantities of sucrose decay with increasing temperature, with the greatest degree in the experiments with a small share of reducing substances in solutions. With increase in the proportion of reducing substances to 0, 3 %, the rate is reduced to about twice, with a 80 ° C and found to decrease its rate of growth. Main liming process preceded progressive <b>preliming,</b> not only where the epimerization faster but less stable, and the decomposition of fructose in the composition of the reducing substances to produce reactive products influencing the alkalinity of the solution and the surface state of microparticles of calcium hydroxide. The presence on the surface OH-groups and the appearance of tumors in the working environment, having in their structures group (= CO), (= O), (- СОН) contributes to the appearance of induced hydrogen bonds and partial reduction of the specific surface of the mass transfer between the solid particles and the components of the solution. Carboxyl group reduce the level of active alkalinity, which as a result of blocking is limited, which reduces the pH of the environment and the decay constant reducing substances. When heated to about 85 °C decomposed 20 % of the reducing substances, and chromaticity increased by 83, 1 %, taking into account the heating and hot main liming chromaticity increased by 116, 9 %. That is, the more reducing substances remain in solution after the first stage of the main liming, the stronger chroma increases upon subsequent heating and hot workability...|$|E

40|$|Summary. Food {{production}} {{requires a}} significant consumption of energy derived from natural resources. The main direction of increase of competitiveness of production of sugar beet and sugar is reduction {{the consumption of}} energy resources, losses of sucrose and enforcement of existing environmental regulations. We conducted research on the reduction of energy consumption in obtaining sugar in various directions. We investigate the possibility of reducing energy consumption for drying of sugar beet pulp. One of the directions of hardening {{of the structure of}} the fabric during the extraction process is the preliminary chemical impact on beet chips. In our studies, it was found the effect of the method of preparation pulp press water on mechanical strength beet chips. One of the directions of energy saving is the reduction of scale formation and the related increase in the efficiency of water evaporation from the pure juice. With this purpose, we studied the different coating applied to the surface of the boiling tubes evaporating. The best results in reduction of scale formation has been observed when blueing heat transfer surface. Positive results can be obtained from the use of such technological operations as the ripening of juice after II carbonation. We analyzed the technology with the use of magnetic treatment to reduce the consumption of lime on the physical and chemical cleaning of diffusion juice. Determined that the rational conditions of processing <b>preliming</b> juice at pH 8, 5 pulsed magnetic field is the duration of its impact 8 sec and with the induction of 0, 25 T.

40|$|Lake Orta, a large Italian subalpine lake, has a {{long history}} of {{industrial}} pollution by acid, ammonia, and metals. A whole-lake liming treatment in 1989 - 1990 led to a gradual increase in pH (from 4. 4 to 7) and a concomitant decline in ammonia (from 2. 5 to 0. 05 mg L- 1) and metal concentrations (e. g., copper: from 35 to 3 &# 956;g L- 1). In this study, we examine the response of the littoral zone, in terms of chemistry and periphyton assemblages, to contamination and recovery of Lake Orta. We compare these findings with a long-term data set of chemistry and phytoplankton collected in the pelagic zone. We sampled periphyton at two sites from the liming period (1989) through 2010 when the lake approached chemical equilibrium. Chemical variables collected in the littoral zone near the periphyton samples followed the same temporal trends observed in the pelagic zone. Chlorophytes, the dominant algae in the <b>preliming</b> period, progressively waned after the calcium carbonate addition. Diatom importance gradually increased to reach up to 80 % of the total biovolume in the most recent years. There was a clear shift in the diatom taxonomic composition over the study period. Acidophilous Pinnularia subcapitata var. hilseana and metal-tolerant Achnanthes minutissima were dominant before liming. With the progressive increase in pH and decline in metal concentrations, there was successively the dominance of Fragilaria nanoides (formerly identified as Synedra tenera) and Cymbella microcephala in the transition period and of circumneutral Navicula cryptocephala, N. radiosa, and Synedra ulna in the most recent period. Pelagic diatoms were more affected than benthic diatoms by the industrial pollution and their recovery after the liming intervention was slower. Whereas present periphyton diatom assemblages are similar to those observed in nearby unpolluted Lake Mergozzo, pelagic assemblages are still in transition from severe disturbance towards characteristics reported before pollution. Our results suggest that the littoral zone may have acted as a refugium during contamination providing an inoculum for pelagic recolonization...|$|E
40|$|Malignant ovarian tumours pose a {{significant}} risk to women {{all over the}} world. Ovarian cancers are the fifth most common cancers among women in the UK. Mortality due to ovarian malignancies is unacceptably high and the disease is often called a “silent killer” as {{the early stages of}} ovarian malignancies present with a little to no symptoms. Ovarian cancer is therefore mostly diagnosed at a very late stage of tumour progression when treatment is hampered by metastastatic spread of the primary tumour. Ovarian tumours express and release a previously undescribed novel mucin-like protein (MLP), which is absent in normal ovarian tissue or benign ovarian cysts (Schwaeble, W and Walker, R unpublished results). This novel mucin-like protein is a glycoprotein composed of a protein backbone, which is highly glycosylated with O-linked oligosaccharides. The high degree of glycosylation accounts for most the molecular weight of the native glycoprotein. The aim of this project was to develop a reliable diagnostic assay for the early and non-invasive detection of ovarian malignancies using specific monoclonal antibodies for MLP detection. The early detection of ovarian malignancies poses a so far unmet clinical necessity. The presently used tumour-associated biomarkers (mainly based on the relatively non-specific tumour marker CA- 125) unfortunately all fail to detect ovarian malignancies at an early stage. Recombinant MLP was produced in a bacterial expression system, purified, analysed by Western blotting and used to raise polyclonal antibodies {{for the development of a}}n MLP- specific sandwich ELISA. Eight different hybridomas producing mouse monoclonal antibodies against recombinant human MLP were also grow up and supernatant tested. Three of the eight monoclonal antibodies were shown to recognise native, glycosylated MLP as well as the recombinant antigen. These three were characterised in detail by ELISA, immunohistochemical staining of tissue sections and Western blot analysis. <b>Preliming</b> experiments were performed using the three monoclonal antibodies and the goat anti-MLP antiserum to investigate the properties of the antibodies and their sutability for establishing a sandwish ELISA able to detect the presence of MLP in serum for the development of a test for the early diagnosis of ovarian cancer...|$|E
