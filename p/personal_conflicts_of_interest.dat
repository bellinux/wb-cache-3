50|$|Judges are {{supposed}} to recuse themselves from cases when <b>personal</b> <b>conflicts</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> may arise. For example, if a judge has participated in a case previously in some other judicial role he/she {{is not allowed to}} try that case. Recusal is also expected when one of the lawyers in a case might be a close personal friend, or when the outcome of the case might affect the judge directly, such as whether a car maker is obliged to recall a model that a judge drives. This is required by law under Continental civil law systems and by the Rome Statute, organic law of the International Criminal Court.|$|E
50|$|However, {{the problem}} may well extend beyond the FDA to the entire {{research}} oversight system, which depends heavily on a network of Institutional Review Boards to protect subjects. Critics argue that Institutional Review Boards are understaffed and under-qualified, that they are excessively bureaucratic, and that they attempt to restrict research outside their mandate and expertise. Many Institutional Review Boards, {{such as the one}} at the University of Minnesota, are staffed by colleagues of clinical investigators whose studies are being evaluated, raising concerns about <b>personal</b> <b>conflicts</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest.</b> Others, known as “independent” or “commercial” Institutional Review Boards, are funded by research sponsors themselves, an arrangement that arguably presents a financial conflict of interest. Two separate sting operations have found commercial IRBs willing to approve phony research studies deliberately designed to be risky or fraudulent.|$|E

40|$|Recusal, or {{judicial}} disqualification, {{occurs when}} a judge abstains from a particular legal proceeding because <b>of</b> a <b>personal</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest.</b> All levels <b>of</b> the judicial system and some administrative agencies in the United States apply the concept of recusal, but this study focuses on the United States Supreme Court. Title 28 of the United States Code provides standards (not obligatory by legal means) on when Supreme Court Justices should recuse themselves. But Supreme Court Justices are themselves the arbiters of their own recusal and often these substantive standards are not met. The method of study applied is theoretical, using both quantitative and qualitative data from past Supreme Court cases...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{assess the}} {{frequency}} with which editorial authors report <b>personal</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> and investigate a possible association between the presence <b>of</b> such <b>conflicts</b> and favorable opinion. Methods: Eligible studies were editorials of phase III clinical trials of antitumor drugs or symptom management published from January 2007 to December 2009 in four top oncology journals. Data from the editorials were collected and each editorial opinion was classified as favorable, neutral or unfavorable with respect to the experimental therapy. Results: Fifty-four editorials were included: 23 (43 %) reported at least one <b>conflict</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest,</b> with the most frequent one being consultancy fees. Conclusions of editorial authors were classified as favorable in 18 editorials (33 %). Sensitivity analysis found an association between self-reported <b>conflict</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> <b>of</b> the editorial author and editorial favorable opinion (RR: 2. 7; 95 % Cl 1. 2 - 6. 1; p = 0. 019). Discussion: Besides the high proportion <b>of</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> among editorial authors discussing phase Ill clinical trials, study interpretation may be influenced by their financial relationships with industry.

40|$|In a trio {{of recent}} cases, Padilla v. Kentucky, Missouri v. Frye, and Lafler v. Cooper, the U. S. Supreme Court has focused its {{attention}} on defense counsel 2 ̆ 7 s pivotal role during the plea bargaining process. At {{the same time that}} the Court has signaled its willingness to consider ineffective assistance of counsel claims at the plea stage, prosecutors are increasingly requiring defendants to sign waivers that include waiving all constitutional and procedural errors, even unknown ineffective assistance of counsel claims such as those that proved successful in Padilla and Frye. Had Jose Padilla and Galin Frye been forced to sign a waiver of any ineffective assistance of counsel claim as a condition of entering their pleas, and if the Supreme Court approved of such waivers, then neither Padilla nor Frye would have secured the relief the Court held that they deserved. Waivers of ineffective assistance of counsel claims pose both legal and ethical issues. Legally, the waivers serve to undermine a defendant’s due process rights — recognized by the Court in Gideon v. Wainwright — by requiring the defendant not only to waive what is unknown to them at the time of waiver, but to do so even when based upon bad advice of ineffective counsel. Ethically, a defense lawyer counseling a defendant to waive ineffective assistance of counsel claims has a <b>personal</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> with the client, because the lawyer has reputational and other interests in not having the lawyer’s representation of the client determined to be ineffective. Whether the Supreme Court would approve a waiver of an ineffective assistance claim that would negate the due process right to effective assistance of counsel is not yet resolved. Such a decision, however, would immunize much incompetent lawyering from any judicial scrutiny altogether. This article begins by examining the systemic barriers defense counsel face to provide meaningful advice to criminal defendants contemplating a guilty plea These barriers include the underfunding of defense services in many jurisdictions and the coerciveness of the plea bargaining process. Next, the article analyzes the law and ethics of waivers of ineffective assistance of counsel claims and whether such waivers should be permissible. We contend that such waivers should not be enforceable for both legal and ethical reasons. Permitting waivers of ineffective assistance of counsel claims not only constitutes judicial acceptance of a prosecutorial veto of the Court’s recent decisions regarding plea bargaining, but also ensures that more defendants never receive the effective assistance of counsel during plea bargaining...|$|R

5000|$|Regulating <b>conflict</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> in {{government}} {{is one of}} the aims of political ethics. Public officials are expected to put service to the public and their constituents ahead <b>of</b> their <b>personal</b> <b>interests.</b> <b>Conflict</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> rules are intended to prevent officials from making decisions in circumstances that could reasonably be perceived as violating this duty of office. Rules in the executive branch tend to be stricter and easier to enforce than in the legislative branch. Two problems make legislative ethics <b>of</b> <b>conflicts</b> difficult and distinctive. First, as James Madison wrote, legislators should share a [...] "communion of interests" [...] with their constituents. Legislators cannot adequately represent the <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> constituents without also representing some of their own. As Senator Robert S. Kerr once said, [...] "I represent the farmers of Oklahoma, although I have large farm interests. I represent the oil business in Oklahoma...and I am in the oil business...They don't want to send a man here who has no community <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> with them, because he wouldn't be worth a nickel to them." [...] The problem is to distinguish special interests from the general <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> all constituents. Second, the [...] "political interests" [...] of legislatures include campaign contributions which they need to get elected, and which are generally not illegal and not the same as a bribe. But under many circumstances they can have the same effect. The problem here is how to keep the secondary interest in raising campaign funds from overwhelming what should be their primary interest—fulfilling the duties of office.|$|R
40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Treasury has taken a number of actions since 2008, in part in response to recommendations we made, to establish a structured system to manage potential conflicts of interest involving its contractors and financial agents. The system {{is based on a}} formal regulation Treasury issued in interim form in 2009 and final form in 2011, which prohibits organizational or <b>personal</b> <b>conflicts</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> unless they have been waived or mitigated under a Treasury-approved plan. The regulation sets forth requirements to address actual and potential conflicts that may arise, establishes responsibilities for contractors and financial agents in preventing conflicts from occurring, and outlines Treasury's process for reviewing and addressing conflicts. Treasury has developed a multifaceted process to manage and oversee potential conflicts of interest, which is managed by OFS's Office of the Chief Compliance Officer. The process includes reviewing proposed contracts and financial agency agreements, approving contractor and financial agent mitigation plans, addressing conflicts of interest inquiries, reviewing conflicts of interest certifications, and preparing feedback reports for contractors and financial agents. In addition, because the monitoring of conflicts of interest was based to some degree on self-reported information submitted by contractors and financial agents, Treasury began conducting on-site design and compliance reviews in 2011 {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} its contractors' and financial agents' internal controls and procedures for conflicts of interest. Treasury has also established an internal database to document and track financial agent and contractor conflicts of interest certifications, inquiries, and requests for waivers. ...|$|E

40|$|I {{read with}} {{interest}} the article published by Kugler et al. [1]. Regarding the duplex ultrasound examination the author didn't consider the paper by Zamboni et al. [2] published in December 2011 on international angiology. In this document the authors noted that a high preva-lence ranging from 62 % to 100 % of obstructive lesions has been found by some teams in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) compared with a lower prevalence of 0 %- 25 % in controls. However, absence of such lesions or a lower prevalence (16 %- 52 %) has been reported by others. This variability could {{be the result of}} differences in technique, training, experience or criteria used. The current lack of a methodology shared among experts is a confounding element in epidemiologic studies, and does not permit further Bayesan or other kind of analysis. In order to ensure a high reproducibility of Duplex scanning with comparable accuracy between centers, a detailed protocol with standard methodology and criteria is proposed. This is also necessary for training. It has been shown that inter-rater variability increases post-training (from k= 0. 47 to k= 0. 80), while within-rater reproducibility in trained operators was k= 0. 75. Finally, the consensus document proposes a reporting standard of Duplex measurements, and future research to answer areas of uncertainty.

40|$|Traber (1) {{argued that}} 93 % {{of men and}} 96 % {{of women in the}} United States do not consume the {{recommended}} amount of vitamin E. However, the current US recommendation for vitamin E is based on peroxide-dependent erythrocyte hemolysis, a surrogate endpoint that has not been validated against any clinically relevant outcome (8, 9). Furthermore, according to the current nutritional recommen-dations, there is no evidence that, among free-living persons, dietary vitamin E intake may meaningfully correlate with plasma -tocopherol concentrations (8). We are not aware of any reasonable evidence indicating that 93 % of men and 96 % of women in the United States may suffer any harmful effect on health because of their “low ” vitamin E intake. In our opinion, the attitude toward vitamin E supplementation should be based on randomized controlled trials, which have not shown a benefit in preventing or treating chronic diseases, and not on observational studies, which are highly susceptible to biases that may remain even after statistical adjustment for confounders (5, 10). Although it is possible that some population groups may benefit from vitamin E supplementation, the evidence is so equivocal that it is inappropriate to make the sweeping recommendation for vitamin E supplementation in the United States that Traber makes. Implying health benefits of supplementation in the general population is con-trary to the evidence; moreover, it puts people at risk if excess use occurs and will benefit only the industry that produces, promotes, and protects the continued sale of supplement products.

40|$|Tacrolimus, the {{cornerstone}} of most immunosuppressive regimens in solid organ transplantation, {{is characterized by a}} narrow therapeutic window and high pharmacokinetic- and pharmacodynamic variability. Important sources of pharmacokinetic variability include the activity of intestinal and hepatic enzymes and transporters (namely cytochrome P 450 enzymes CYP 3 A 4, CYP 3 A 5 as well as P-glycoprotein (P-gp)). Therapeutic drug monitoring is part of routine clinical practice but cannot resolve several key issues, such as predicting the magnitude of drug interactions, longitudinal variation in tacrolimus disposition and individual susceptibility to tacrolimus toxicity, particularly its nephrotoxity. This project aims to develop a comprehensive pharmacologic model for tacrolimus in renal recipients that includes genetic polymorphisms relevant to drug metabolism, clinical parameters and functional assessment of in vivo CYP 3 A 4 and P-gp activity using validated drug probes. Additionally, the impact of kidney genotype on renal metabolism of tacrolimus (including metabolite generation) and the resulting nephrotoxicity will be assessed in vitro and in vivo. The in vitro model is based on conditionally immortalized human proximal tubular epithelial cells (ciPTEC) with varying CYP 3 A 5 and P-gp genotypes. In vivo assessment will be performed by prospectively evaluating the effects of genetic polymorphisms on production of tacrolimus metabolites in stable renal recipients, and correlating this with the occurrence of tacrolimus nephrotoxicity (assessed on renal allograft protocol biopsies).

This resulted in three overall objectives: 1) to study the documented effectiveness of fall prevention in nursing homes, 2) to gain insight into prevailing views and current practices and 3) to evaluate the feasibility of implementing a fall prevention practice guideline into the daily practice of nursing homes. Therefore, the follonwing research questions were formulated: RQ 1 : What is the currently available evidence on characteristics and effectiveness of single, multiple, and multifactorial fall prevention strategies for older persons admitted to nursing homes? RQ 2 : What is the predictive accuracy of the following fall risk screening methods to predict falls in nursing homes: the ‘Algorithm for classification of fall risk’, the ‘Care Home Falls Screen’ and healthcare workers’ clinical judgment? RQ 3 : Which fall prevention strategies are currently used by different healthcare workers in Flemish nursing homes? RQ 4 : Which variables predict whether or not healthcare workers perform fall prevention strategies? RQ 5 : Which barriers and facilitators influence the implementation of fall prevention in residential care facilities?
