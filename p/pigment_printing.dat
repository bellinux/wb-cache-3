40|$|This {{study reveals}} an exergetic {{analysis}} of the reactive and <b>pigment</b> <b>printing</b> processes. Exergy models of the printing processes were formed and each step examined in terms of exergetic parameters. In the printing machine, the reactive printing process led to a higher specific exergy use due to the penetration requirement of the printing paste. The exergy efficiency in the subsequent drying after printing {{was found to be}} independent of the print-ing method, but affected by the fabric structure, which was calculated to be between 3. 8 % and 4. 8 %. In the fixation step, <b>pigment</b> <b>printing</b> provided the highest exergy efficiency, calculated to be 2. 15 %, due to the direct heating of the fixation air. It was observed for the fixation step that the boiler unit of the steaming process and the burner of the hot air fixa-tion process led to the highest exergy destruction rates. The total exergy destruction rate in <b>pigment</b> <b>printing</b> was found to be higher than in the washing and final drying stages of reac-tive printing alone; thus, it was shown that the exergetic improvement of the post-washing and drying of reactive printing is of great importance.

40|$|Abstract: A {{series of}} {{acrylate}} latexes for <b>pigment</b> <b>printing</b> binder were prepared by semi-continuous pre-emulsifying emulsion polymerization, using lipophilic glycidyl meth-acrylate (GMA), ethylene glycol dimethyl acrylate (EGDMA) and hydrophilic HA (containing hydroxyl, acylamino), N-methylol acrylamide (NMA) as cross-linking monomer. The influences of cross-linker type on the particle size, viscosity and film-forming rate of latex, cross-linking degree and tensile properties of latex film were studied. It {{was found that}} the latex particle size, viscosity and film-forming rate were closely related with the hydrophile-lipophile property of cross linkers. The acrylate latex synthesized with hydrophilic cross-linkers always exhibits the characteristics of larger particle size, lower film-forming rate, higher viscosity and pseudoplastic fluid. The cross-linking degree and tensile properties of latex film generally depend on the crosslinking groups of cross-linkers and their reactivity...|$|E
40|$|There {{has been}} growing {{interest}} in using poly (lactic acid) (PLA) fibres because of its natural-based origin and good biodegradability; however its adoption within the textile industry has been limited to lower tem-perature wet and dry processing, because of its relatively lower glass transition temperature (Tg) and melting point (Tm). Here we report {{for the first time}} inkjet printing of heat-sensitive PLA fabrics using ambient temperature UV curable inks as a way of overcoming the potential degra-dation at higher temperature. The UV-cured inkjet printed PLA fabrics exhibited good performance characteristics such as acceptable colour fastness, relatively high colour strength, K/S, and comparable colour difference, ΔE, after washing to the thermally-cured ink system, without af-fecting the physical and mechanical properties of the fab-rics. In contrast thermally cured inkjet printed PLA fabrics exhibited significantly reduced bursting strength and stiffer handle attributed to the thermal degradation and lower fibre flexibility imparted at the higher temperature. Investigation of the radiation-cured printing approach indicates UV curable inkjet printing may be considered as an alternative to conventional thermally-cured <b>pigment</b> <b>printing</b> of heat sensitive biodegradable PLA-based fabrics...|$|E

The results of the project gave the mechanistic interpretation of surface structuring of fibrous material. These results open a wide field for application in polymer modelling. Especially surface structuring of yarns, webs and non-wovens can be performed systematically. Thus the prerequisites for a new area of uv-laser application has been opened.

40|$|Textile {{industry}} {{is obliged to}} adapt to ecological legislation because classical processes have a great environmental impact caused by operations included in preparation, dyeing and printing of textile materials, specially those containing cotton. Removal of hydrophobic impurities and starches, using surfactants, alkalis and oxidants at high temperatures is normally made with important consequences at ecological level, with problematic effluents and higher costs. CORONA is a non- pollutant technique based in physical means of production of plasma at ambience pressure, which {{can be applied to}} reduce ecological and economical cost factors in textile industry. The term plasma means an ionized gas, formed by a complex mixture of electrons, neutral particles, ions, photons and radicals produced by an electric discharge or by radiation in electromagnetic fields able to produce ionization. When the fabric runs betweenelectrodes and an electric discharge is made at ambience temperature and pressure, with a high voltage of more than 10 000 V and a frequency between 20 - 40 kHz, the treatment is known as CORONA. In the medium, free electrons lose energy when collide with neutral molecules. This energy transfer produces new very reactive particles and with capacity to be involved in other reactions, responsible for the formation of new compounds and changes of fibre’s superficial properties. CORONA technology is not industrially used in textiles yet, but it has a wide application in the case of other polymeric products like plastics in order to achieve a better degree of cohesion between printing inks and materials. Its application in textiles has been thought in order to take practical advantage of the possibility to work continuously at ambience conditions. CORONA effects in the structure of cotton’s surface were already studied and the creation of channels for water penetration was proved, together with the oxidation of fatty matters, which are the mechanisms responsible for the fast increase in hidrophility after CORONA treatment. This fact is decisive in what concerns all the chain of wet processes for cotton transformation. Studies were previously made about CORONA effects in textile printing. These studies led to very good results related to the reinforcement of links in the system fibre-pigment together with surface changes caused by the discharge which are responsible for an increase in the wet/dry rubbing fastness. It is possible to have a fastness improvement of one point, which means an optimal result for <b>pigment</b> <b>printing</b> quality. In the present work, the extension of these results to preparation and dyeing of cotton has been made. Shorter, cleaner and easier processes are possible, including direct dyeing of raw cotton materials. Depending on final use for textile dyed products, results for a completely “Green Process” are presented, where the presence of husks and seeds not removed by any chemical treatment {{can be seen as a}} kind of quality certification...|$|E
40|$|The present work {{deals with}} the {{preparation}} of nanosized copolymer latexes by the polymerization in miniemulsions prepared by the classical high energy and the low energy phase inversion concentration (PIC) methods. In addition, the encapsulation of various organic pigments with copolymer latex layers was carried out {{on the basis of}} miniemulsion polymerization. The obtained nanosized copolymer particles or encapsulated pigments have been successfully used as binders or hybrid binders for textile printing applications. The first part {{deals with the}} preparation of nanosized copolymer latexes in a diameter size range between (50 - 100 nm) by the classical miniemulsion polymerization method. The copolymer latexes composed mainly of a high content of the soft butyl acrylate monomer (BA) and a low content of the hard methyl methacrylate (MMA) monomer. The addition of small amounts of functional monomers such as methacrylic acid MAA and N-methylol acrylamide NMA to some miniemulsion recipes allowed to impart cross-linking sites and functionality to the copolymer chains. The particle size analysis, structure characterization and thermal properties of the latexes were investigated by many analytical techniques such as dynamic light scattering (DLS), small angle neutron scattering (SANS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), gel permeation chromatography (GPC), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The optimized miniemulsion latexes were applied successfully as binders for the <b>pigment</b> <b>printing</b> and inkjet printing of cotton fabrics. The main objective of this part was to examine the application of the miniemulsion latexes as binders in the textile printing processes {{in order to reduce the}} risk of agglomeration and cloaking of the printer screens and nozzles during the printing process. The evaluation of the printed fabrics showed that the miniemulsion binders with their smaller size offered technological advantages over the conventional processes for the conventional and inkjet printing processes as well as the better print properties. Accordingly by optimized use of the miniemulsion method one is not only able to control the particle size but also to improve the properties of these latexes for textile applications. In the second part, we studied the encapsulation of organic pigments with polymer latex layers by miniemulsion polymerization. Such polymer-encapsulated pigments then can be applied for inkjet printing without addition of separate binder additives, thereby reducing the risk of unfavorite interactions between the separate latex and pigment particles. The encapsulation of C. I. Pigment red 112 was systematically studied by a miniemulsion polymerization of pigment/butyl acrylate-co-methyl methacrylate (BA-MMA) or styrene-co-butyl acrylate (St-BA) copolymers. The ratio of monomer to pigment was varied in order to find optimum conditions for the preparation of self-curable hybrid pigment inks for the textile inkjet printing application. The particle size and polydispersity of the pigment dispersions and pigment hybrid latex particles were investigated by dynamic light scattering (DLS), disc centrifuge particle size analyzer and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The efficiency of the polymer encapsulation and the thermal properties of the hybrid inks were studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The evaluation of the inkjet printing of cotton fabrics with different encapsulated and non-encapsulated pigment colors showed that the encapsulated inks without addition of separate polymer latex binder generate fully satisfying values that compare favourably in terms of color strength, rubbing and washing fastness to the non-encapsulated conventional inks, while avoiding problems of clogging and colloidal instability. In the last part, the low energy phase inversion composition (PIC) method was used for the formation of monomer based nanoemulsions from a system composed of monomer/Brij 78 /water. These nanoemulsions were used as templates for generating polymer and copolymer nanoparticles. Styrene was used as monomer for studying the phase diagram, where parameters such as the O/S ratio and water addition rate influence the formation of the nanoemulsion and the structure of the final polymer particles. Hexadecane was added to the oil phase with a concentration 4 wt% (relative to the oil) to achieve stability against Oswald ripening. Nanoemulsions with a fixed water content of 80 wt% and O/S ratios from 0. 25 to 9 generated polymer particles with diameters between 30 to 110 nm as determined from dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscopy. The polydispersity of the polymer nanoparticles was found to be dependent on the O/S ratio. Different copolymer latexes based on styrene, butyl acrylate and methyl methacrylate were prepared with a fixed O/S ratio 9 and water content 80 %, applied successfully as binders for the inkjet printing of cotton fabrics and compared to corresponding copolymer latexes prepared by the high-energy methods or the conventional methods. The results indicated that PIC method constitutes a very interesting and innovative way to generate nanosized polymer latex particles using a simple setup of emulsification experiments. In der vorliegenden Arbeit wurden die Herstellung von Copolymer Latices durch die klassische Miniemulsionspolymerisation und die bisher hierfür noch wenig eingesetzte Phase Inversion Concentration (PIC) Methode untersucht. Zudem wurde die Verkapselung verschiedener Pigmentfarben über das Konzept der Miniemulsionspolymerisation durchgeführt. Die durch die verschiedenen Methoden hergestellten Copolymer Teilchen bzw. die verkapselten Pigmente wurden erfolgreich als Bindemittel für Textildruckanwendungen angewendet. Das erste experimentelle Kapitel beschäftigt sich mit der Herstellung von Copolymer Latices im Größenbereich von 50 - 100 nm hergestellt durch die klassische Miniemulsionspolymerisation. Diese Copolymer Latices bestehen hauptsächlich aus einem hohen Anteil an weichem Butylacrylat-Monomers (BA) und einem niedrigen Gehalt an hartem Methylmethacrylat (MMA) Monomer. Die strukturelle Charakterisierung und die thermischen Eigenschaften der Latex Teilchen erfolgte durch viele analytische Verfahren, wie dynamische Lichtstreuung (DLS), Kleinwinkelneutronenstreuung (SANS), Transmissionselektronenmikroskopie (TEM), Gel-Permeations-Chromatographie (GPC) und Registrierende Differentialkalorimetrie (DSC). Die optimierten Miniemulsion Latices wurden dann erfolgreich als Bindemittel für den Pigmentdruck und Tintenstrahldruck von Gewebe aus Baumwolle eingesetzt. Das Hauptziel dieser Teil der Arbeit war es, die Anwendung der Miniemulsion Latices als Bindemittel in Textildruckverfahren zu untersuchen, wobei diese das Risiko von Agglomeration und damit das Verstopfen der Düsen während des Druckprozesses verringern sollen. Dieser Nachteil resultiert meist aus unerwünscht hohen Partikelgrößen, der Form der herkömmlichen Bindemitteln oder auch anderen Bestandteilen. Die Auswertung der Druckexperimente ergaben, dass die Miniemulsion basierten Bindemittel mit ihrer geringeren Größe technologische Vorteile gegenüber den herkömmlichen Verfahren bieten, sowohl für das konventionelle Druckverfahren als auch für das Tintenstrahldruckverfahren und dabei auch zu verbesserten Druckeigenschaften führen. Der zweite Teil der Dissertation befasst sich mit der Verkapselung des organischen Pigments durch Polymerlatex Schichten, um die Agglomeration der Pigmentpartikel zu minimieren und ihre Stabilität und Dispergierbarkeit zu verbessern, was zu deren verbesserten Anwendbarkeit beitragen soll. Die Verkapselung der Pigmente wurde durch Miniemulsionspolymerisation mit verschiedenen Monomeren wie Styrol, Methylmethacrylat oder Butylacrylat durchgeführt. Die Analyse der Partikelgröße sowie der Einkapselungseffizienz der verkapselten Pigmente wurde mit Hilfe vieler analytischer Methoden untersucht und mit den nicht verkapselten Pigmenten verglichen. Die verkapselten Pigmente wurden dann erfolgreich als Tinten formuliert und ohne technische Probleme, wie das Verstopfen der Düsen der Druckmaschinen, für das Tintenstrahldrucken von Gewebe aus Baumwolle verwendet. Der letzte Teil des Projektes beschäftigte sich mit der Herstellung von Latex Teilchen mit einem Durchmesser von ca. 30 - 100 nm, die durch Nanoemulsionspolymerisation hergestellt wurden, wobei die Nanoemulsionen durch die Phase Inversion Concentration (PIC) Methode hergestellt wurden. Die monomerhaltigen Nanoemulsionen waren Systemen bestehend aus Wasser, Monomer und nichtionischen Tensids. Wir verwendeten Styrol als Monomer für die systematische Untersuchung des Phasenverhaltens und der Bildung der Monomer-Nanoemulsion sowie deren anschließender Polymerisation. Das Phasenverhalten des Systems aus Wasser / Brij 78 (Polyoxyethylen (20) Stearylether) / Styrol ergab den geeigneten Bereich, in dem mit Monomer Nanoemulsionen gebildet werden können. Die Polymerisation in den PIC Nanoemulsionen wurde dann mit verschiedenen Monomeren durchgeführt, um entsprechend unterschiedliche Copolymerpartikel zu synthetisieren. Die Nanoemulsion Latices wurden dann wiederum für die Anwendung als Bindemittel für die normale Bedruckung und den Tintenstrahldruck von Gewebe aus Baumwolle getestet und verglichen mit Copolymeranaloga die über das klassische Miniemulsionsverfahren erhalten worden waren. Diese zeigte, dass die Untersuchung solcher PIC Nanoemulsionen und deren anschließende Polymerisation eine sehr interessante und innovative Möglichkeit darstellt, um neuartige Nanopolymerlatexpartikel für Druckanwendungen zu erzeugen...|$|E
