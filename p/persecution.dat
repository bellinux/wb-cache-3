5|$|<b>Persecution</b> of Zoroastrians is the {{religious}} <b>persecution</b> inflicted upon {{the followers of}} the Zoroastrian faith. The <b>persecution</b> of Zoroastrians occurred throughout the religion's history. The discrimination and harassment began {{in the form of}} sparse violence and forced conversions. Muslims are recorded to have destroyed fire temples. Zoroastrians living under Muslim rule were required to pay a tax called Jizya.|$|E
5|$|The first <b>persecution</b> by an emperor {{occurred}} under Nero, and {{was confined}} {{to the city of}} Rome. Tacitus reports that after the Great Fire of Rome in AD64, some among the population held Nero responsible and that the emperor attempted to deflect blame onto the Christians. After Nero, a major <b>persecution</b> occurred under the emperor Domitian and a <b>persecution</b> in 177 took place at Lugdunum, the Gallo-Roman religious capital. A surviving letter from Pliny the Younger, governor of Bythinia, to the emperor Trajan describes his <b>persecution</b> and executions of Christians. The Decian <b>persecution</b> of 246–251 was a serious threat to the Church, but ultimately strengthened Christian defiance. Diocletian undertook what was to be the most severe <b>persecution</b> of Christians, lasting from 303 to 311.|$|E
5|$|The Diocletianic or Great <b>Persecution</b> was {{the last}} and most severe <b>persecution</b> of Christians in the Roman Empire. In 303, the Emperors Diocletian, Maximian, Galerius, and Constantius issued a series of edicts rescinding the legal rights of Christians and {{demanding}} that they comply with traditional Roman religious practices. Later edicts targeted the clergy and ordered all inhabitants to sacrifice to the Roman gods (a policy known as universal sacrifice). The <b>persecution</b> varied in intensity across the empireweakest in Gaul and Britain, where only the first edict was applied, and strongest in the Eastern provinces. Persecutory laws were nullified by different emperors at different times, but Constantine and Licinius's Edict of Milan (313) has traditionally {{marked the end of}} the <b>persecution.</b>|$|E

Marches typically involve participants holding signs and banners, devoting different sections of the parade to different aspects of the <b>persecution.</b> There is usually a section involving participants wearing only white (symbolizing mourning) and holding photos of those killed in China.|$|E

5|$|In July 1999, the Communist Party {{initiated}} {{a campaign to}} persecute Falun Gong, including {{through the use of}} extralegal imprisonment, torture and other coercive measures, and propaganda.

These tactics range from engagement with the media, lobbying of governments and NGOs, public protests and demonstrations, and attempts to seek legal redress. As the <b>persecution</b> in China progressed, overseas Falun Gong efforts increasingly tied their pleas for relief to Western human rights discourse, emphasizing the implications for freedom of speech, assembly, and conscience.|$|E
5|$|Not all of Diocletian's {{plans were}} successful: the Edict on Maximum Prices (301), {{his attempt to}} curb {{inflation}} via price controls, was counterproductive and quickly ignored. Although effective while he ruled, Diocletian's tetrarchic system collapsed after his abdication under the competing dynastic claims of Maxentius and Constantine, sons of Maximian and Constantius respectively. The Diocletianic <b>Persecution</b> (303–11), the empire's last, largest, and bloodiest official <b>persecution</b> of Christianity, did not destroy the empire's Christian community; indeed, after 324, Christianity became the empire's preferred religion under its first Christian emperor, Constantine.|$|E
5|$|Persecutory {{policies}} {{varied in}} intensity across the empire. Where Galerius and Diocletian were avid persecutors, Constantius was unenthusiastic. Later persecutory edicts, including {{the calls for}} universal sacrifice, were not applied in his domain. His son, Constantine, on taking the imperial office in 306, restored Christians to full legal equality and returned property that had been confiscated during the <b>persecution.</b> In Italy in 306, the usurper Maxentius ousted Maximian's successor Severus, promising full religious toleration. Galerius ended the <b>persecution</b> in the East in 311, but it was resumed in Egypt, Palestine, and Asia Minor by his successor, Maximinus. Constantine and Licinius, Severus's successor, signed the Edict of Milan in 313, which offered a more comprehensive acceptance of Christianity than Galerius's edict had provided. Licinius ousted Maximinus in 313, bringing an end to <b>persecution</b> in the East.|$|E

5|$|The unique {{position}} of the Christians and Jews of the empire became increasingly apparent. The Jews had earned imperial toleration {{on account of the}} great antiquity of their faith. They had been exempted from Decius's <b>persecution</b> and continued to enjoy freedom from <b>persecution</b> under Tetrarchic government. Because their faith was new and unfamiliar and not typically identified with Judaism by this time, Christians had no such excuse.

Africa's political elite were insistent that the <b>persecution</b> be fulfilled, and Africa's Christians, especially in Numidia, were equally insistent on resisting them. For the Numidians, to hand over scriptures was an act of terrible apostasy.
