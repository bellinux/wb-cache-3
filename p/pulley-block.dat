I jumped for it, but was too late, for the cord ran like lightning through the <b>pulley-block,</b> and the heavy mass fell forward from its own weight.|$|E

40|$|Adaptive cable-driven {{parallel}} robots are {{a special}} subclass of cable-driven systems {{in which the}} locations of the pulley blocks are modified {{as a function of the}} end-effector pose to obtain optimal values of given performance indices within a target workspace. Due to their augmented kinematic redundancy, such systems enable larger workspace volume and higher performance compared to traditional designs featuring the same number of cables. Previous studies have introduced a systematic method to optimize design and trajectory planning of the moving <b>pulley-blocks</b> for a given performance index. In this paper, we study the motions of the pulley blocks that optimize two performance indices simultaneously: stiffness and dexterity. Specifically, we present a method to determine the pulley blocks motions that guarantee ideal dexterity with the best feasible elastic stiffness, as well as those that guarantee isotropic elastic stiffness with the best feasible dexterity. We demonstrate the proposed approach on some practical cases of planar adaptive cable-driven parallel robots...|$|R
5000|$|On {{the lowest}} floor one finds {{exhibits}} {{related to the}} earliest cultures {{and the birth of}} human history. The visitor will find (among other things) an accessible Ancient Egyptian dwelling, a grave chamber and a labyrinth. Exhibits are not limited to physical anthropology. The physical sciences and mathematics of earliest antiquity are described and represented in experiments, exhibits and diagrams. The second floor concerns itself with the Middle Ages (500-1500). Here is represented antique world systems and medicine, simple machines and the science of early Arabia. Included in the interactive exhibits are <b>pulley-blocks,</b> a water wheel, and a human-powered impeller for pumping liquids. The third floor is devoted to the knowledge of the Renaissance to early modern times (1500-1750). Here the visitor finds exhibits on mechanics, vacuum, magnetism, mathematics, alchemy, medicine and conceptions of world change. Important wars, the important journeys of discovery and major inventions (e.g., the printing press, the telescope) are among the main topics. The fourth floor shows the period 1650-1859. The floor is divided into the levels 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3. Topics include medicine and chemistry, biology and sensory perception, as well as optics. Topics here include electricity, radio engineering, caloric theory, fixed star parallax, Doppler effect, space and time, as well as genetic engineering and the nuclear energy. Numerous experiments illustrate the topics. The fifth floor concerns itself with modern research in the natural sciences and medicine. Emphasis is on the general topics [...] "microcosm" [...] and [...] "macrocosm". The sixth floor houses the observation platform.|$|R

50|$|The Corbridge Hoard also {{contained}} bundles of spearheads still tied together with cord; artillery bolts; a sword scabbard; various tools and implements (including a <b>pulley-block</b> and a crusie lamp); items associated with carpentry, such as nails and joiner's dogs; {{a small wooden}} bucket or tankard. There were also fragmentary remains of feathers (possibly cushion stuffing or helmet plumes), wax writing tablets, and (almost uniquely in Roman Britain) fragments of papyrus.|$|E

This {{results in the}} 1862 purchase and demolition of Soho-located Smethwick Hall, {{on the site of}} which is built the Cornwall Works.1867: The patent for a new type of direct-acting steam pump is acquired, in 1869 Tangye Ltd is commissioned to design the hydraulic systems for the UK's first funicular cliff railway in Scarborough, North Yorkshire and in 1870 the company commences the manufacture of steam engines. Richard Tangye and his brother George found the Birmingham Art Gallery in 1885, which today has a collection of international importance covering fine art, ceramics, metalwork, jewellery, archaeology, ethnography, local history and industrial history. They also found the Birmingham School of Art.|$|E
5000|$|In March 1857, Richard Tangye, with {{brothers}} James and Joseph, {{started a}} manufacturing business in Mount Street {{under the title}} of James Tangye and Bros. Principally manufacturing hydraulic appliances and particularly lifting jacks, on 31 January 1858, their jacks were successfully employed in the launching of Brunel's steamship [...] Tangye said of the project: We launched the Great Eastern and she launched us In 1859, brothers Edward and George joined, together with George Price. The company acquired the patent of the differential <b>pulley-block</b> in 1861, and in 1862 James Tangye invented the Tangye Patent Hydraulic Jack. This resulted in the 1862 purchase and demolition of Soho-located Smethwick Hall, {{on the site of}} which was built the Cornwall Works.
