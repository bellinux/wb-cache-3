25|$|<b>Performance</b> <b>appraisal</b> or {{performance}} evaluation {{is the process}} in which an individual's or a group's work behaviors and outcomes are assessed against managers' and others' expectations for the job. <b>Performance</b> <b>appraisal</b> is frequently used in promotion and compensation decisions, to help design and validate personnel selection procedures, and f{{or performance}} management. Performance management {{is the process of}} providing performance feedback relative to expectations, and information relevant to improvement (e.g., coaching, mentoring).

40|$|Performance {{management}} and <b>performance</b> <b>appraisals</b> {{have long been}} regarded as key for effective strategic human resource management (SHRM) in the for-profit sector. When well- designed, performance management in general and <b>performance</b> <b>appraisals</b> in particular positively affect employees, managers, and organizations. Given the specific setup of nonprofit organizations, tools for performance management from the for-profit sector might not be easily applicable to nonprofit organizations. Nonprofit scholars have begun to study performance management, but to date the field lacks a comprehensive overview of this research.

25|$|When <b>performance</b> <b>appraisal</b> {{measures}} are run down, they typically {{need to be}} replaced by new measures. In the sciences, overlapping data is useful, in that it they can be used to confirm or disprove a given hypothesis. In management, however, overlapping measurements are considered redundant, rather than a useful indication of reliability. By the same token, new measures that lie in direct opposition to existing measures of performance are not helpful. For instance, if a retail company uses units of shoes sold in a month as a metric, adding units of shoes remaining unsold after a month as a new metric is not helpful. Since the company can derive the same information and draw the same conclusions from both metrics, it is more efficient to use only one of the two measures. In the interest of generating useful data, new performance measures should be orthogonal to existing metrics.|$|E
25|$|Negotiated {{performance}} appraisal: The negotiated <b>performance</b> <b>appraisal</b> (NPA) is {{an emerging}} approach for improving communication between supervisors and subordinates and for increasing employee productivity, {{and may also}} be adapted to an alternate mediation model for supervisor-subordinate conflicts. A facilitator meets separately with the supervisor and with the subordinate to prepare three lists. What employees do well, where the employee has improved in recently, and areas where the employee still needs to improve. Because the subordinate will present his or her lists first during the joint session, this reduces defensive behaviors. Furthermore, the subordinate comes to the joint session not only prepared to share areas of needed improvement, but also brings concrete ideas as to how these improvements can be made. The NPA also focuses very strongly on what employees are doing well, and involves a minimum of twenty minutes of praise when discussing what the employee does well. The role of the facilitator {{is that of a}} coach in the pre-caucuses, and in the joint sessions the supervisor and subordinate mostly speak to each other with little facilitator interference.|$|E

40|$|As {{a result}} of federal {{government}} pressure in the late 1980 ’s Australian universities now find themselves embracing managerial practices {{at the expense of}} their traditional collegial practices.

500|$|Around 1971, DEC {{employee}} David H. Ahl {{had written}} a version of The Sumer Game in the BASIC programming language. Unlike FOCAL, BASIC was run not just on mainframe computers and minicomputers, but also on personal computers, then termed microcomputers, making it a much more popular language. In 1973, Ahl published BASIC Computer Games, a best-selling book of games written in BASIC, which included his version of The Sumer Game. The expanded version was renamed Hamurabi and added an end-of-game <b>performance</b> <b>appraisal.</b> The popularity of both {{the book and the}} programming language itself meant that Ahl's version of the game became the more widely known version over the relatively obscure original, as evidenced by the 1973 French FOCAL version considering [...] "Hamurabi" [...] to be the more prominent name. BASIC Computer Games noted that the game was a modification of a game [...] "written in FOCAL at DEC", but listed the author as [...] "unknown." [...] The 1978 edition of the book, which was the first million-selling computer book, noted that the game's name was intended to be [...] "Hammurabi", the correct spelling of the Babylonian king, but not only was one [...] "m" [...] dropped in the file name to fit in an eight-character limit, but Ahl consistently misspelled the name inside of the game, leading to the generally accepted name of the game to be Hamurabi.|$|E

2500|$|The {{performance}} management process begins with leadership {{within the organization}} creating a {{performance management}} policy. [...] Primarily, management governs performance by influencing employee performance input (e.g. training programs) and by providing feedback via output (i.e. performance assessment and appraisal).

2500|$|Also {{referred}} to as contextual behavior, prosocial behavior, and extra-role behavior, organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) consists of employee behavior {{that contributes to the}} welfare of the organization but {{is beyond the scope of}} the employee’s job duties. [...] These extra-role behaviors may help or hinder the attainment of organizational goals. [...] Research supports five dimensions of OCB: altruism, conscientiousness, courtesy, sportsmanship, and civic virtue. [...] Researchers have found that the OCB dimensions of altruism and civic virtue can have just as much of an impact on manager’s subjective evaluations of employees’ performances as employees’ objective productivity levels. [...] The degree to which OCB can influence judgments of job performance is relatively high. [...] Controversy exists as to whether OCB should be formally considered as a part of <b>performance</b> <b>appraisal</b> (PA).|$|E
50|$|<b>Performance</b> <b>appraisals</b> {{also become}} {{ineffective}} because of employee reactivity to the evaluations themselves. The concept of reactivity explains that evaluations meant to assess performance are often rendered futile because they affect employee performances. In other words, many <b>performance</b> <b>appraisals</b> do not accurately measure performance because employees react to being observed and evaluated. Because {{they can only}} test an employee’s “test-taking” skills, not his or her objective accomplishments, evaluations appear unable to serve their purposes.
