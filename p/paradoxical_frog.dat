5000|$|In {{a review}} for JazzTimes Britt Robson says about Laubrock [...] "Her work in <b>Paradoxical</b> <b>Frog</b> and Anti-House marked {{her as a}} force to be {{reckoned}} with. Ubatuba ratifies that reputation with unique, tactile music that pricks the senses as much as it piques the intellect." ...|$|E
50|$|Pseudis paradoxa, {{known as}} the <b>paradoxical</b> <b>frog</b> or {{shrinking}} frog, is a species of hylid frog from South America. Its name refers to the very large—up to 25 cm long—tadpole (typical of the Pseudis genus), which in turn becomes an ordinary-sized frog, only {{about a quarter of}} its former length.|$|E
5000|$|The Point of Departure {{review by}} Troy Collins states [...] "The {{simultaneous}} release of Pool School and <b>Paradoxical</b> <b>Frog</b> {{make a strong}} case for Ingrid Laubrock as a major new player worthy of extra attention, and {{is a testament to the}} creative diversity of the Downtown scene and Clean Feed's efforts to document it." ...|$|E
50|$|In March 2008, {{scientists}} {{working from}} the Universities of Ulster and United Arab Emirates released findings of a study on pseudin-2, a skin compound which protects the <b>paradoxical</b> <b>frog</b> from infection. This work found that a synthetic version of this compound was able to stimulate the secretion of insulin in pancreatic cells under laboratory conditions without toxicity to the cells. As such, this synthetic medicine {{could be used in}} the treatment of Type 2 diabetes.|$|E
50|$|Anti-House is the eponymous {{debut album}} by German jazz saxophonist Ingrid Laubrock's band with guitarist Mary Halvorson, bassist John Hébert, drummer Tom Rainey and pianist Kris Davis, {{credited}} {{as a guest}} on about half the pieces. It was recorded in 2010 and released on the Swiss Intakt label. In the summer of 2008 Laubrock relocated from London to New York, where she participated in the collective trio <b>Paradoxical</b> <b>Frog,</b> but this was her first recording as leader in the US.|$|E
40|$|The genus Pseudis {{is unique}} amongst anuran {{amphibians}} in that body growth occurs mostly or {{entirely in the}} larval phase, with huge tadpoles metamorphosing into adult-sized frogs. Tadpole growth rate, metamorphic duration and tadpole habitat were studied in the <b>paradoxical</b> <b>frog</b> Pseudis paradoxa in Trinidad, West Indies, {{in order to assess}} the factors which may have led to the evolution of this unique life history. Growth rate was shown to be similar to other tropical tadpoles: Pseudis simply continued to grow, rather than progress to metamorphosis. Metamorphic duration fitted well with a model based on tadpole size. Sexual dimorphism in tadpole size was apparent, with females larger than males at metamorphosis. Pseudis tadpoles initially possess highly cryptic patterning, which is lost as they grow larger. The costs and benefits of continued growth in the larval phase in a permanent tropical swamp habitat are discussed in terms of potential predators and food availability to both Pseudis larvae and adults...|$|E
40|$|The genus Pseudis {{is unique}} amongst anuran {{amphibians}} in that body growth occurs mostly or {{entirely in the}} larval phase, with huge tadpoles metamorphosing into smaller but adult-sized frogs. Selected organ systems were studied in tadpoles of the <b>paradoxical</b> <b>frog</b> Pseudis paradoxa {{in order to determine}} whether they have any special features associated with their large size and unique life history. Testes of large tadpoles were well developed with spermatogenesis proceeding before metamorphosis; ovaries were also well developed in later stage tadpoles with large pre-vitellogenic oocytes. In later stage tadpoles, unusually for anuran larvae, the intestine had developed longitudinal internal ridges, increasing the internal surface area. Lungs of later stage tadpoles showed internal septation, again an unusual feature for anuran larvae. Finally, later stage tadpoles had a considerably thickened epidermis compared to earlier stages, though no sign of adult-type glands. Overall, these results suggest that as Pseudis tadpoles grow in size beyond the norm for conventional anuran larvae, a suite of features normally associated with adult anurans begins to develop before metamorphosis...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{search for}} new {{antibiotic}} agents is continuous, reflecting the continuous emergence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens. Among the new agents are the antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), which {{have the potential to}} become a leading alternative to conventional antibiotics. Studies for the mechanisms of action of the naturally occurring parent peptides can provide the structural and functional information needed for the development of effective new antibiotic agents. We therefore characterized pseudin- 2, an AMP isolated from the skin of the South American <b>paradoxical</b> <b>frog</b> Pseudis paradoxa. We found that pseudin- 2 organized to an aggregated state in aqueous solution, but that it dissociated into monomers upon binding to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), even though it did not neutralize LPS in Gram-negative bacteria. In addition, pseudin- 2 assumed an α-helical structure in the presence of biological membranes and formed pores in both bacterial and fungal membranes, through which it entered the cytoplasm and tightly bound to RNA. Thus, the potent antimicrobial activity of pseudin- 2 likely results from both the formation of pores capable of collapsing the membrane potential and releasing intracellular materials and its inhibition of macromolecule synthesis through its binding to RNA...|$|E
40|$|The <b>paradoxical</b> <b>frog</b> Pseudis tocantins is {{the only}} species in the Hylidae family with known {{heteromorphic}} Z and W sex chromosomes. The Z chromosome is metacentric and presents an interstitial nucleolar organizer region (NOR) on the long arm that is adjacent to a pericentromeric heterochromatic band. In contrast, the submetacentric W chromosome carries a pericentromeric NOR on the long arm, which is adjacent to a clearly evident heterochromatic band that {{is larger than the}} band found on the Z chromosome and justify the size difference observed between these chromosomes. Here, we provide evidence that the non-centromeric heterochromatic bands in Zq and Wq differ not only in size and location but also in composition, based on comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) and an analysis of the anuran PcP 190 satellite DNA. The finding of PcP 190 sequences in P. tocantins extends the presence of this satellite DNA, which was previously detected among Leptodactylidae and Hylodidae, suggesting that this family of repetitive DNA is even older than it was formerly considered. Seven groups of PcP 190 sequences were recognized in the genome of P. tocantins. PcP 190 probes mapped to the heterochromatic band in Wq, and a Southern blot analysis indicated the accumulation of PcP 190 in the female genome of P. tocantins, which suggests the involvement of this satellite DNA {{in the evolution of the}} sex chromosomes of this species...|$|E
