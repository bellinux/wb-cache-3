5000|$|Gloria Beaumont {{is a very}} effeminate {{person who}} cannot handle the violence, heat and {{mosquitoes}} of army life in India too well. He considers himself an artiste, and doesnt believe he {{should be in the}} Army, often trying to emphasize his show-business angle and ignore the [...] "soldier" [...] <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>job.</b> He has a passion for show business and always dresses up as famous film stars during the concert party shows, especially as Ginger Rogers. He later succeeded Bombardier Solomons rank when George Layton left the series. Despite Beaumonts effeminacy, he meets a nurse in the episode Ticket to Blightly and they announce they are to be wed.

25|$|The {{existence}} of Venona decryption became {{known to the}} Soviets {{within a few years}} of the first breaks. It is not clear whether the Soviets knew how much of the message traffic or which messages had been successfully decrypted. At least one Soviet penetration agent, British Secret Intelligence Service representative to the U.S. Kim Philby, was told about the project in 1949, as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>job</b> as liaison between British and U.S. intelligence. Since all of the duplicate one-time pad pages had been used by this time, the Soviets apparently did not make any changes to their cryptographic procedures after they learned of Venona. However, this information allowed them to alert those of their agents who might be at risk of exposure due to the decryption.|$|E
25|$|After {{studying}} theology for a while, Postel {{managed to}} return to medical service in 1995. Using his birth name, he obtained {{the position of a}} senior physician in a clinic specialized on neurology and psychiatry in Zschadraß near Leipzig. As a <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>job,</b> he issued psychiatric expertises and held lectures for medical doctors without raising suspicion with anyone. By chance, a co-worker recognised him on July 10, 1997, forcing him to go into hiding. At that time, an appointment was already set for an interview with Hans Geisler, then Saxony's Minister of State for social affairs, health and family, on the occasion of Postel's appointment to a professorship and to the position of chief of medicine at Saxony's hospital for psychiatry and neurology at Arnsdorf near Dresden.|$|E

40|$|Bartleby, the Scrivener recounts a {{story of}} a scrivener who would prefer not to do anything, whether that be <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>job,</b> {{changing}} <b>his</b> location, or eating his dinner. The narrator’s reaction to Bartleby’s lazy desires seem to be admirable, but his selfish motivation and false compassion are evident. The way the narrator views and treats Bartleby is consistent with the standards of philanthropy of the wealthy during the mid-nineteenth century. The narrator truly believes he has helped Bartleby to the best <b>of</b> <b>his</b> ability, yet fails to connect with Bartleby outside of offering him money and future assistance if required. This may be blamed on the narrator’s lack of relationship with God. People below the narrator’s socioeconomic status were viewed solely on how they could benefit him and his business and were expected to conform to the narrator’s standards. Bartleby the Scrivener, though a melancholy story leading to Bartleby’s death, can be used to see an accurate picture of philanthropy in the 1850 s...|$|R

Even {{if it had not been}} so disruptive, the court held, his record of insubordination and deception of several of the defendants was enough reason for him to have been disciplined and fired—indeed he had even admitted he believed his job to be in jeopardy before he had contacted the Times.|$|E

Longoria had the third highest votes out of players in the American League, but did not participate in the game due to an infection in his finger. Making the All-Star roster by means of player voting, was Carl Crawford, his third selection, and Jason Bartlett, his first selection.

The sound effects team was divided to address specific details; Tom Bible {{was in charge of}} creating sound for weapons and force powers, while Aaron Brown specialized in the spaceships.
