5000|$|Lake Anna is {{approximately}} 17 mi long from tip to tip, with 200 mi of shoreline. The lake {{is divided into}} two sides: the public side (also known as the [...] "cold" [...] <b>side)</b> and the <b>private</b> <b>side</b> (also known as the [...] "hot" [...] side). The public side is roughly 9000 acre, while the <b>private</b> <b>side</b> is roughly 4000 acre. The <b>private</b> <b>side</b> is formed of three main bodies of water, connected by navigable canals. The public and <b>private</b> <b>sides</b> are divided by three stone dikes. The <b>private</b> <b>side</b> has no marinas or public access ramps; only property owners and North Anna Power Station employees have access to the waters of the <b>private</b> <b>side.</b> The public side has several marinas and boat launches, including a boat ramp at the state park. The public side sees significantly higher boat traffic than the <b>private</b> <b>side,</b> especially on summer weekends.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} coalitional {{behavior in}} principal-multiagent relationships with moral hazard, and identifies {{cases where the}} principal prefers agents to form a coalition via <b>side</b> <b>contracting.</b> The paper first shows that when agents' efforts are mutually unobservable so that their <b>side</b> <b>contracts</b> cannot be contingent on their efforts, the possibility of mutual insurance through monetary <b>side</b> <b>contracts</b> never makes the principal better off. It is then shown that when the agents can monitor each other's efforts perfectly, coordination in effort choice through <b>side</b> <b>contracts</b> contingent on efforts and outputs enables the principal {{to reduce the cost}} of implementing given efforts. This result holds when no production externality exists and noise terms are independent, when there is team production and the agents are sufficiently homogeneous, or when production externalities such as mutual "help" are important and there is a pressure toward "egalitarianism. ...|$|R

40|$|In a team {{production}} {{problem with}} unverifiable effort, budget breaking {{is essential to}} implementing efficient levels of effort. This short paper considers {{the use of a}} third party, who does not exert effort, in a setting with general contracts that can include message games, as a way to remove resources from the team. We show that if <b>side</b> <b>contracting</b> can influence behavior in a message game in the original contract, the addition of the third party is not helpful. Additionally, we compare our view of <b>side</b> <b>contracting</b> with that of Baliga and Sjostrom (2009) to explore the nature of <b>side</b> <b>contracting</b> that is needed in order for the third party to be useful for budget breaking. ...|$|R
40|$|The bachelor’s {{thesis is}} divided {{in to the}} {{literary}} research and practical part. The content of the literary research {{is the issue of}} <b>side</b> <b>contracted</b> weirs, where occurs <b>side</b> <b>contracted</b> flow. The sudden change of the channel width and formation of upstream wake have direct influence on value of discharge coefficient. There are described types of the weirs, ways of computing discharge and discharge coefficients which are influenced by contraction. In the practical part of thesis is described measurement of the velocity field of <b>side</b> <b>contracted</b> flow by UVP Monitor, follow up by assessment of boundary of the upstream wake, which is situated in the approach channel in front of the weir...|$|R
5000|$|The public side {{is known}} as the [...] "cold" [...] side because it {{provides}} water to cool the generators at the power plant; the private or [...] "hot" [...] side receives warm water discharge from the power plant. The <b>private</b> <b>side</b> can be substantially warmer than the public side, especially near the discharge point, where it can be too hot for swimming. The <b>private</b> <b>side</b> has an extended water sports season. Some water circulates back out of the <b>private</b> <b>side</b> into the public side through underground channels; consequently, the public side is warmer in the southern area near the dam. In the winter, some fish migrate to these warmer waters.|$|R

40|$|Prediction markets {{add value}} when they produce {{unbiased}} forecasts. However, several prior studies find persistent biases when examining prediction market <b>sides</b> <b>contracts.</b> <b>Sides</b> <b>contracts</b> represent bets {{on whether the}} score differential between two teams in a contest will be greater or less than a stated value. We propose that inferences generated from examining Tradesports' <b>sides</b> <b>contracts</b> may be problematic because they are framed exclusively with respect to favorites. If a favorite-longshot (or reverse favorite-longshot) bias causes these deviations from rationality, {{it may be that}} non-sports-related (e. g., internal corporate) prediction markets assets do not suffer from the same shortcomings. To evaluate the generalizability of prior findings, we contrast the price efficiency of Tradesports' <b>sides</b> and totals <b>contracts.</b> In totals wagers, traders take a position on whether the combine score of both teams in a game will be above or below a stated value. We find that the fundamental structural differences between totals <b>contracts</b> and <b>sides</b> <b>contracts</b> partly determine differences in price efficiencies. Relative to those in the sides market, some price biases in the totals market are significantly smaller in magnitude, and others are absent altogether. Results indicate that contract structure plays {{a significant role in the}} ability of prediction markets to produce unbiased estimates. ...|$|R
