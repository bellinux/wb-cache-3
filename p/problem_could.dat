5|$|According to Nurkse, {{underdeveloped}} countries lack adequate {{purchasing power}}. Low purchasing power {{means that the}} real income of the people is low, although in monetary terms it may be high. If the money income were low, the <b>problem</b> <b>could</b> easily be overcome by expanding the money supply; however, since the meaning {{in this context is}} real income, expanding the supply of money will only generate inflationary pressure. Neither real output nor real investment will rise. It is to be noted that a low purchasing power means that domestic demand for commodities is low. Apart from encompassing consumer goods and services, this includes the demand for capital as well.|$|E
5|$|Essad Pasha Toptani, as {{minister}} {{of war and}} interior, was against a peaceful solution of the problem. He opposed the International Commission of Control which believed that the <b>problem</b> <b>could</b> be solved by diplomatic means. The Prince and his cabinet accepted Essad Pasha's proposals for a military solution. Several thousand Italian rifles and Austrian machine and mountain guns were purchased and distributed to the (predominantly Muslim) population of central Albania. They believed that the new regime was a tool of the (Christian) Great Powers and the landowners that owned half of the arable land. On the basis of those beliefs they revolted.|$|E
5|$|Hakim {{screened}} {{her first}} {{work as a}} producer, Daun di Atas Bantal (Leaf on a Pillow) during Un Certain Regard at Cannes ten years later. When producing the film, she chose young director Garin Nugroho, whom she perceived to be highly talented; she also took the leading role. During production, she made a mistake that required the reshooting of all footage. In an attempt to cut expenses, she had saved all cans of exposed film to send to the developing lab at once; the lab then notified her that a technical fault with the camera had rendered all of it unusable and that the <b>problem</b> <b>could</b> have been detected earlier had she sent each can as it was filmed.|$|E
30|$|There {{are many}} things that can go wrong: the {{instructions}} could be difficult to interpret, the questions, or their answer alternatives, could be unclear or not realistic, the feedback could be irrelevant, the sequence of <b>problems</b> <b>could</b> be wrong, the <b>problems</b> <b>could</b> be too difficult or easy, the <b>problems</b> <b>could</b> be measuring a different skill than intended, etc. However, when everything works well, {{we should be able to}} see learning curves similar to Fig. 1, and if we do not, we know that the learning material needs more work.|$|R

5|$|Blue whales may be wounded, {{sometimes}} fatally, after {{colliding with}} ocean vessels, {{as well as}} becoming trapped or entangled in fishing gear. Ship strikes in particular have killed many blue whales in California. In September 2007, three dead blue whales washed up in southern California after being killed by ship strikes. Ship strikes are also a serious problem in Sri Lanka, and scientists believe this <b>problem</b> <b>could</b> be nearly eliminated by moving the shipping lanes 15 nautical miles to the south. The ever-increasing amount of ocean noise, including sonar, drowns out the vocalizations produced by whales, which {{makes it harder for}} them to communicate. Blue whales stop producing foraging D calls once a mid-frequency sonar is activated, even though the sonar frequency range (1–8kHz) far exceeds their sound production range (25–100Hz). Research on blue whales in the Southern California Bight has shown that mid-frequency sonar use interferes with foraging behavior, sometimes causing the whales to abandon their feeding. Human threats to the potential recovery of blue whale populations also include accumulation of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) chemicals within the whale's body.|$|E
5|$|Studying {{the outcome}} of the events in Rolling Thunder, the Air Force and Navy came to very {{different}} conclusions on how to adapt. The Air Force noted that most of their air-to-air losses were due to unseen attacks from the rear, and thus the <b>problem</b> <b>could</b> be addressed through additional technology that would provide early warning of such attacks. They began modifying their aircraft with built-in M61 Vulcans for close-in use, adopted the Sidewinder and began upgrading them to improve their performance, and introduced new ground and air-based radars to provide an overall watch over the battlefield. The Navy concluded that the primary problem was that their pilots had not been given proper air combat maneuvering training, and were forced to rely on missiles that were not performing as expected. In 1968 they introduced the TOPGUN program, a move that was welcomed by the F-8 pilots who had been campaigning for this all along.|$|E

25|$|The Messerschmitt Bf 109 and Mitsubishi Zero had {{the exact}} {{opposite}} problem in which the controls became ineffective.

25|$|The proof {{shows that}} any problem in NP {{can be reduced}} in {{polynomial}} time (in fact, logarithmic space suffices) to an instance of the Boolean satisfiability problem.

40|$|We {{study how}} to solve semidefinite {{programming}} (SDP) relaxations for large scale polynomial optimization. When interior-point methods are used, typically only small or moderately large <b>problems</b> <b>could</b> be solved. This paper studies regularization methods for solving polynomial optimization problems. We describe these methods for semidefinite optimization with block struc-tures, and then apply them to solve large scale polynomial optimization problems. The performance is tested on various numerical examples. By regularization methods, significantly bigger <b>problems</b> <b>could</b> be solved on a regular computer, which is almost impossible by interior point methods...|$|R

25|$|A severe {{problem of}} phonetic or {{sensorimotor}} models of speech processing (like DIVA or ACT) {{is that the}} development of the phonemic map during speech acquisition is not modeled.

25|$|These time {{intervals}} {{would seem}} to be reversed; this is an area where public policy trumps science. The idea is that for women beyond age 35, every month counts and if made to wait another 6 months to prove the necessity of medical intervention, the <b>problem</b> <b>could</b> become worse. The corollary to this is that, by definition, failure to conceive in women under 35 isn't regarded with the same urgency as it is in those over 35.|$|E
25|$|The {{howitzer}} {{was designed}} to fire the same ammunition as the longer M2. However, {{it turned out that}} shorter barrel resulted in incomplete burning of the propelling charge.

The carriage was soon succeeded by the M3A1, which had trails made from thicker plate. Even stronger tubular trails were designed, but never reached production.|$|E

25|$|In 1978, {{astronomer}} A. J. R.

Prentice also suggested that the young Sun transferred some angular momentum to the protoplanetary disc and planetesimals through supersonic ejections understood to occur in T Tauri stars. However, his contention that such formation would occur in toruses or rings has been questioned, as any such rings would disperse before collapsing into planets.|$|E
