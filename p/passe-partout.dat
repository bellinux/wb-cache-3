He walked quietly into Genie Linderbeck's neat room, with its rose-hued comforter {{on a narrow}} brass bed, <b>passe-partouted</b> Copley prints, and a small oak table with immaculate green desk-blotter, and said good-by....

40|$|The ‘LIGHTVAN’ {{research}} aims {{to optimize}} the lighting design for healthy schools and modern senior housing and care homes {{with regards to the}} use of light as a cheap and important source of energy. A multi-functional mobile light laboratory was built into a delivery van, the LIGHTVAN. This LIGHTVAN has two clear aims: With this mobile light laboratory we can travel to the living environment of specific groups of people, such as children and seniors, so that they may be subject to specific age-dependent light studies. In this moving laboratory measurement equipment is present for this purpose and a table and chairs for the various subjects. Testing of luminance and color contrasts are possible, as well as the testing of 2 ̆ 2 light and shadow 2 ̆ 2 patterns. Even small eye tests can be performed. In addition, the rear side of the delivery van is adapted so that with opened doors all kinds of innovative facades can be tested. The LIGHTVAN travel to different locations to be accommodated and be positioned towards various sun directions. Several <b>passe-partouts</b> are available for building physics measurements of different facades sizes in order to allow test-subjects to indicate their preferences for specific facades in terms of comfort...|$|R
2500|$|As well as {{the very}} small and low-powered <b>Passe-Partout,</b> the de Marçay stand at the 1919 Paris Aero Salon {{displayed}} two touring aircraft, both powered by [...] Le Rhône 9Z nine-cylinder rotary engines. [...] One was a single-seater and the other, the rather larger Limousine, seated two. [...] Some recent sources refer to the latter as the de Marçay T-2. At {{the time of the}} show, neither had flown.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>Passe-Partout</b> had a {{monocoque}} fuselage of rounded rectangular cross-section. [...] Its {{engine was}} mounted, with cylinders exposed, {{in the upper}} nose. The pilot's open cockpit placed him just aft of the upper trailing edge but over the lower wing because of the stagger. [...] At the rear a plywood covered tailplane was mounted high on the fuselage and fitted with fabric covered elevators. Both the fin and rounded rudder were also ply covered. Its [...] fixed landing gear was of the conventional tailskid type with mainwheels on a single axle rubber rubber sprung from a frame consisting of two V-form struts from the lower fuselage with a single cross-member.|$|E
2500|$|Bingham {{sailed to}} the Cape of Good Hope, {{and spent the}} next couple of years {{operating}} in the Indian Ocean. On 14 January 1804 St Fiorenzo gave chase to the French naval chasse-marée and aviso <b>Passe-Partout</b> off Mount Dilly on the Malabar Coast. When the wind began to fail, Bingham sent three of his boats after the quarry. Once alongside, in two minutes the British had captured the French vessel, despite fire from two brass six-pounder guns, six brass swivel guns and small arms. Out of her 25-man crew, Passe-Portout had two dead and five seriously wounded, including the captain, who was mortally wounded; the British suffered only one man slightly wounded. [...] Bingham discovered that the French had outfitted Passe Partout to land three officers on the coast to incite the Mahratta states to attack the British. Bingham passed on the intelligence with the result that the British at Poona were able to capture the Frenchmen.|$|E
60|$|The consul at Cowes {{had been}} an old {{acquaintance}} at school some five-and-twenty years before, and an inquiry was set on foot for his residence. He was absent in France, but his deputy soon presented himself with an offer of services. We wished for our trunks, and it was soon arranged {{that there should be}} an immediate examination. Within an hour we were summoned to the store-house, where an officer attended on behalf of the customs. Everything was done in a very expeditious and civil manner, not only for us, but for a few steerage passengers, and this, too, without the least necessity for a douceur, the usual <b>passe-partout</b> of England. America sends no manufactures to Europe; and, a little smuggling in tobacco excepted, there is probably less of the contraband in our commercial connexion with England, than ever before occurred between two nations that have so large a trade. This, however, is only in reference to what goes eastward, for immense amounts of the smaller manufactured articles of all Europe find their way, duty free, into the United States. There is also a regular system of smuggling through the Canadas, I have been told.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Passe-partout</b> (or passepartout) is the French {{term for}} a mat, a paper or, more usually, {{cardboard}} sheet with a cutout, which is placed under the glass in a picture frame.
