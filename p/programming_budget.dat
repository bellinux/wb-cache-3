40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page 351) This thesis {{contains a}} methodology for {{implementation of a}} <b>program</b> <b>budget</b> applicable within institutions of higher education. The {{purpose of the study}} is to provide an applied example of <b>program</b> <b>budgeting</b> to an educational institution and show the resultant improvement in the decision-making process that takes place as a result of using these techniques. One study assumes that the institution has three primary outputs: instruction, research, and public service. All costs are expressed in terms of these outputs by allocating supportive costs to them. <b>Program</b> <b>budgeting</b> is defined as a planning and control technique which enables managers to plan and control their short-run and long-run goals better than traditional planning and control techniques would allow. The study is organized two chapters. Chapter I explains the nature of <b>program</b> <b>budgeting</b> by defining the term, providing a brief, history, and outlining the benefits that are to be derived from the use of <b>program</b> <b>budgeting.</b> Chapter II provides the techniques required in order to implement the <b>program</b> <b>budget</b> model. This includes a crossover matrix from the traditional accounting system to the program accounting system as well as the various allocation algorithms involved. Finally, recommendations are made in order to facilitate implementation of <b>program</b> <b>budgeting</b> and to make its results more meaningful...|$|R

On 5 March 2014 Hall announced a proposal to convert BBC Three to an online-only service, with an almost 50% cut in its <b>programming</b> <b>budget,</b> and a larger emphasis on short form content due to the cut in funding. These changes formed part of a package of proposals from the BBC, including extending CBBC's hours, respending £30m on BBC One audiences for drama, and launching a one-hour timeshift channel of BBC One. There was notable backlash against the measures, with celebrities including Greg James, Matt Lucas and Jack Whitehall speaking out.

While, organisations using <b>program</b> <b>budgeting</b> focus on the issues of performance, the accountability of management to an elected body, such as a local council has been given little attention. In this article three questions are posed: (1) Is the performance information available to enable councillors to form a judgment about management's performance?; (2) Is management involved in determining issues of policy, such as objectives, programs and performance measurement?; and (3) Are councillors confronted by a greater volume of budgetary documentation but with no increase in time to consider it?
