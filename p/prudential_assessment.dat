40|$|The last {{decades have}} been characterised by {{financial}} liberalisation and internationalisation of financial markets. Still, {{the financial sector}} has remained more tightly regulated than most others. Due to financial institutions‟, and especially banks‟, crucial position within financial markets and their systemic nature, financial liberalisation has walked {{hand in hand with}} stricter industry regulation. In the EU a certain overall level of harmonisation is sought in all Member States, also within the financial sector, extending to Norway through its EEA Membership and the EEA Agreement. An important part of this harmonisation, although often set aside in favour of the more pressing questions of capital adequacy and liquidity ratios, is the regulation of the taking-up of businesses and pursuit of holdings within the financial sector. Through a long line of Internal Market directives the European Commission has attempted to provide harmonised <b>prudential</b> <b>assessment</b> regulation and authorisation practices for the taking up and pursuit of businesses within the sector. This article discusses Norwegian private ownership regulation in regards to the taking up and pursuit of the businesses of credit institutions and (life) insurance undertakings and its legitimacy under EEA law. In chapters 2 and 3 we review the legal method of interpretation and the relevant regulatory scenery. Subsequently, chapter 4 discusses Norwegian assessment practice relating to pursuit of the business of financial institutions, while chapter 5 discusses the assessment practice relating to the taking up of these businesses, as well as the Norwegian public offering rules for credit institutions and insurance undertakings...|$|E
50|$|While it is {{generally}} assumed that EU/IMF bailout was mainly for the banks, this was not ever the intention, and not reflected in the facts. The original bailout agreement marked {{a portion of the}} loaned money for any bank recapitalisations - again, this reflects the uncertainty over whether the PCAR stress tests in early 2011 would reveal further large funding needs. However, the Irish government used none of the borrowed money for bank recapitalisation, at least directly. The close match between the amount of the EU/IMF loans (€67.5 billion) and the bank bailouts (€62.8 billion, but often cited as €64.5 billion) may foster this assumption. In fact, the bank bailout was funded through a combination of NPRF cash and promissory notes - the former required no borrowing, being cash to hand, while the latter was a promise to pay at a later date, which required no immediate borrowing. While the promissory notes were recorded on the national debt - because they would eventually require payment, and were thus a liability - they did not involve any expenditure at the time. The further re-capitalisations undertaken following the <b>Prudential</b> Capital <b>Assessment</b> Review stress tests in early 2011, amounting to €16.5 billion or 27% of the total bank costs, were met from a combination of Exchequer cash and National Pensions Reserve Fund cash, with the cost of the re-capitalisations defrayed by some €16 billion in haircuts on junior bondholders.|$|R
40|$|The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision has {{proposed}} linking capital requirements for bank loans to ratings by commercial credit rating agencies. Estimates for 20 emerging market economies show that sovereign ratings react procyclically to crisis indicators. Ratings deteriorate if the {{real effective exchange rate}} depreciates, {{in contrast with}} the positive effect on overall debt service capacity depreciations are normally supposed to have. Simulations show that linking capital requirements to ratings would have drastically increased these requirements during the crisis periods after decreasing them in the run up to the crises. Simulations suggest modest efficiency gains of using sovereign credit ratings for capital requirements on emerging market lending.
