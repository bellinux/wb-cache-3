40|$|PAPPA is a balloon-based {{experiment}} {{designed to}} measure the polarization of the Cosmic Microwave Background using candidate technology for an eventual Inflation Probe mission. It will survey a 20 x 20 degree patch of sky with 1 degree angular resolution covering 3 passbands centered at 100, 200 and 300 GHz. Detection will be accomplished via antenna-coupled transition edge sensors (TESs) with SQUID-based readouts. In the eventual flight <b>package,</b> <b>band</b> defining filters and MEMS-based polarization modulators will {{be incorporated into the}} superconducting microstrip transmission lines that terminate in resistors that are thermally coupled to the TESs. The MEMS switches will allow on-chip polarization modulation that is faster than significant detector gain variations. The initial configuration will incorporate a simplified focal plane augmented by quasioptical polarization modulation.

40|$|Between November 1989 and March 2013, 1033 Antarctic {{fur seals}} Arctocephalus gazella were {{observed}} entangled in marine debris at Bird Island, South Georgia. The majority of entanglements involved plastic <b>packaging</b> <b>bands</b> (43 %), synthetic line (25 %) or fishing net (17 %). Juvenile male seals {{were the most}} commonly entangled (44 %). A piecewise regression analysis showed that a single breakpoint at 1994 gave the best description of inter-annual variability in the data, {{with higher levels of}} entanglements prior to 1994 (mean = 110 ± 28) followed by persistent lower levels (mean = 28 ± 4). Records of entanglements from other sites monitored in the Scotia Sea are also presented. Legislation imposed by the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) has, to a certain extent, been effective, but persistent low levels of seal entanglements are still a cause for concern at South Georgia...|$|R

40|$|International audienceWe {{present a}} brief {{overview}} of the main results obtained in our group for the simulation of electronic and optical properties of semiconductor heterostructures. A short introduction is given on InAs quantum dots, grown on InP, GaAs and GaP substrates. It is shown that 1 -band k·p calculations can be used in the reciprocal space, {{in order to get a}} simulation of perfectly ordered array of quantum dots. A semianalytical modeling is also presented, including an axial approximation of the 8 * 8 band k·p calculations. Linear and nonlinear contributions to piezoelectricity are discussed. A complete 8 * 8 band k·p approach is then used to show the properties of InAs/InP quantum dots, with different substrate orientations. Finally, a study of the highly strained InAs/GaP interface is performed with a first principle modeling using ABINIT <b>packages.</b> <b>Band</b> lineups and evolution of gap energies are calculated, and compared to those found by Chuang et al.

40|$|Neck collars of {{man-made}} {{marine debris}} were seen on 208 Antarctic fur seals (and removed from 170) during the 142 {{days of the}} 1988 – 1989 pup-rearing season at Bird Island, South Georgia. This represents at least 0. 1 % of the total Bird Island population and a minimum of 0. 4 % of animals in the best covered areas; a maximum value might approach 1 %. Polypropylene straps (<b>packaging</b> <b>bands)</b> formed 59 % of collars, nylon string (16 %), fishing net (13 %) and six other materials comprised the rest. Males accounted for 71 % of entanglements, 88 % of which were of young (1 – 4 yr old) animals; females accounted for 64 % of animals older than this. Obvious physical injury was being caused to 30 % of animals and only on 19 % of animals was the collar loose enough potentially to come off. The {{magnitude of the problem}} at South Georgia is similar to that with northern fur seals at the Pribilof Islands, where a significant population decline has occurred concurrently. Antarctic fur seals are still increasing in numbers but stricter controls on the jettisoning of debris into the Southern Ocean ate needed if the entanglement problem is not to increase beyond the level of a potential threat...|$|R
50|$|Another major line-up {{change and}} the new EPs God Hour and As Friends Rust were {{released}} on Good Life Recordings Doghouse Records, which they had just signed to.
