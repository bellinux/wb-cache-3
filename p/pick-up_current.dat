40|$|The {{departure}} of the Jovian magnetosphere from rigid corotation is adequately explained by outward plasma transport at distances where L is greater than approximately 10. The {{departure of}} 5 % observed in the Io plasma torus, however, is too large to be accounted for simply by plasma transport. Local plasma production is proposed as the main factor determining the corotation lag in the torus. The outward <b>pick-up</b> <b>current</b> provided by ionization of neutral atoms is calculated and related to the current produced in the ionosphere by the corotation lag. This leads to an expression giving the corotation lag of the torus {{as a function of}} radial distance. Charge transfer is found to be an important process, allowing the majority of the torus mass to be ejected from the magnetosphere in a neutral state. Thus, the mass loading rate is found to be several times that inferred from examination of the corotation lag associated with outward plasma transport...|$|E
40|$|Enceladus is {{the most}} active moon of Saturn. Its south polar plume, {{composed}} mostly of water vapor and ice grains, {{is one of the}} groundbreaking discoveries made by the Cassini spacecraft. During Cassini’s E 2, E 3, E 5 and E 7 encounters with Enceladus, the Ion and Neutral Mass Spectrometer (INMS) measured high neutral water vapor densities up to ~ 10 ^ 9 cm- 3 (Waite et al., 2006; Teolis et al., 2010; Dong et al., 2011). We have constructed a physical model for the expected water density in the plumes, based on supersonic radial outflow from {{one or more of the}} surface vents. We apply this model to possible surface sources of water vapor associated with the multiple jets observed in the visible dust plumes (Spitale and Porco, 2007). Our model predictions fit well with the INMS measurements of neutral water vapor density along the E 3, E 5, and E 7 trajectories. The fit is optimized by values of outflow velocity in the range ~ 550 – 750 m/s and values of total source rate in the range ~ 1. 5 − 3. 5 10 ^ 28 H 2 O molecules/s ~ 450 – 1050 kg/s. The model can be extended to incorporate the jet features within the plume observed during the E 7 encounter. The dust (ice grain) plumes of Enceladus have been observed by multiple Cassini instruments. We propose a composite ice grain size distribution covering a continuous size range from nanometer to micrometers, by combining the CAPS (Cassini Plasma Spectrometer) nanograin size distributions (Hill et al., 2012) and the CDA (Cosmic Dust Analyzer) and RPWS (Radio and Plasma Wave Science) dust power-law size distribution (Kempf et al., 2008; Ye et al., 2012, 2013). We also study the grain charging process using the RPWS-LP (Langmuir Probe) data (Morooka et al., 2011). Based on the size distribution and charge per grain, the densities, source rate, motion, and currents of the ice grains can be calculated. We found that the grains ~ 2 - 20 nm dominate in both charge density and number density. The total grain mass density is likely to be ~ 1 - 10 times that of the water vapor, and the grain mass loading rate is ~ 100 kg/s. The motion of the charged grains in Saturn’s magnetosphere implies a transition from ion-like motion to neutral-like motion as the grain size increases from ~nm to ~μm. The grains carry a total current of ~ 10 ^ 5 A at Enceladus, which leads to a different current system from that of the ion pick-up and associated Birkeland currents. The grain current system may be dominant or at least comparable to the ion <b>pick-up</b> <b>current</b> system in accounting for the magnetic perturbations observed near Enceladus...|$|E

40|$|Purpose. The {{scientific}} paper {{focuses on}} {{development of a}} method for mechanical parameters control of the neutral relay of rail automatics by current analyzing in the coil and the relay contacts at switching based on wavelet transform. Methodology. The methodology was based on current analysis of the relay coil and contacts currents under its switching and analysis obtained results by using wavelet transform. Findings. The time dependences of the current in coil and in contacts under switching {{on and off for}} the operable relays and relays with certain defects have been measured at different voltages applied to coil (10, 12 и 14 V). When voltage applied to coil was increased the rate of coil current increased, but time constant of the circuit was changed with voltage slightly. The current value maximum at which the relay armature begun to move for the operable relays was depended on applied voltage slightly. For the time interval, at which armature was putted to the relay core fully, time constant of the circuit was changed with voltage slightly also. The maximum current value at which the armature starts to move to the relay serviceable little dependent on the applied voltage. For site based in which the anchor is completely dragged constant current rise time is also a little dependent on the applied voltage. Similar results were obtained for the current reduction time constant with turning off the voltage and current confinement. The <b>current</b> <b>pick-up</b> and the <b>current</b> release of the armature increases for the relay with the load anchor is proportional to the weight of cargo, {{as well as for the}} relay contact with the rear, bent down, while the flexural rear contact up these currents have smaller values.

40|$|Axisymmetric free-boundary {{equilibrium}} reconstructions of tokamak plasmas in the Lithium Tokamak eXperiment (LTX) {{are performed}} using the PSI-Tri equilibrium code. Reconstructions in LTX are {{complicated by the}} presence of long-lived non-axisymmetric eddy currents generated by vacuum vessel and first wall structures. To account for this effect, reconstructions are performed with additional toroidal current sources in these conducting regions. The source distributions are fixed poloidally, but their scale is adjusted as part of the full reconstruction. Eddy distributions are computed by toroidally averaging currents, generated by coupling to vacuum field coils, from a simplified 3 D filament model of important conducting structures. The full 3 D eddy current fields are also used to enable the inclusion of local magnetic field measurements, which have strong 3 D eddy <b>current</b> <b>pick-up,</b> as reconstruction constraints. Using this method, equilibrium reconstruction yields good agreement with all available diagnostic signals. An accompanying field perturbation produced by 3 D eddy currents on the plasma surface with primarily n= 2, m= 1 character is also predicted for these equilibria. Comment: 13 pages, 6 figure...|$|R
40|$|The CSR {{electron}} cooler will {{be employed}} both for phase space cooling {{and as a}} target for electron-ion collision experiments. Aligning the beams is essential for both applications and, therefore, the cooler features two rotating wire scanners for beam position determination. In {{the course of this}} work their design has been finalised. A scheme has been developed to calculate the transverse beam location from two measured rotation angles. This can be utilised to determine the centres of the electron and ion beams. While in the former case a signal is directly induced at the wires, identification of the latter depends on an increasing restriction of phase space with advancing rotation. A procedure is proposed to detect the decline in ion intensity with the CSR’s <b>current</b> <b>pick-up.</b> Furthermore, the electron collector of the cooler has been designed and assembled. A Wien filter is included to minimise backstreaming of secondary electrons, which will prolong the lifetime of the GaAs photocathode.

From this, among others, the electron density can be computed, which is necessary for rate coefficient calculations...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of different geometries (layouts) and structures of high-speed photodiodes in fully standard 0. 18 μm CMOS technology on their intrinsic (physical) and electrical bandwidths is analyzed. Three photodiode structures are studied: nwell/p-substrate, p+/nwell/p-substrate and p+/nwell. The photodiode bandwidths are compared for λ= 650 nm wavelength {{which is used}} in today's DVD optical <b>pick-ups.</b> Slow substrate <b>current</b> component limits the intrinsic bandwidth of nwell/p-substrate and p+/nwell/p-substrate photodiodes to 70 MHz and 100 MHz, respectively. The electrical bandwidth of these diodes in combination with typical transimpedance amplifiers, will be larger than the calculated intrinsic bandwidths. Thus, the parasitic diode capacitance has almost no influence on the total bandwidth of both photodiodes. By using only a p+/nwell photodiode (not connecting a substrate), the intrinsic diode bandwidth is 1 GHz. However, the electrical bandwidth limitation of this diode due to its parasitic capacitance is important and can limit the total diode bandwidth which is by approximation the lower of the physical and the electrical bandwidth. The calculated responsivity of p+/nwell photodiode is 10 dB lower than in other two defined diodes structures, requiring higher sensitivity of the subsequent electronic circuitry...|$|R

The first cryogenic operation of CSR in 2015 has been documented and characterized using a set of non-destructive beam diagnostic tools developed within this work. These are (1) the <b>current</b> <b>pick-up</b> system for {{the determination of the}} current of the stored ion beam and its velocity, (2) a position pick-up system for measuring the transverse position of the ion beam center at six symmetric locations of the storage ring circumference, and (3) a Schottky pick-up system for the monitoring of coasting ion beams. Despite the requirements imposed by the cryogenic operation, the developed diagnostic system demonstrated its full functionality. First characterizations of the storage ring properties and the performance of the diagnostic system are presented. Based on previous work, an electron cooling system for CSR has been developed and largely realized.

40|$|Longitudinal tomographic {{reconstruction}} on {{the basis}} of measured profiles is an important technique to measure the particle density distribution of a bunch in longitudinal phase space. This measurement technique, well established in all circular machines of the PS complex, has been applied to the SPS for the first time. Due to recent improvements of the data acquisition of the signals from the longitudinal pick-ups in the SPS and a new LHC type wall current monitor, the quality of the bunch profiles is now more appropriate for tomography. Longitudinal beam signals from the wall <b>current</b> <b>pick-ups</b> APWL- 10 and WC- 2 are used as input for the reconstruction algorithm. It is shown that, due to short bunches and long cables in the SPS, the correction of the signal with the transfer function of the transmission system is indispensable. The analysis of the longitudinal distribution of a batch of 48 bunches of an LHC type beam at injection into the SPS, averaged over more than ten cycles, showed that any systematic variation of the bunch parameters along the batch is shadowed by statistical errors due {{to the quality of the}} measured bunch profiles. Avoiding the long coaxial cables from the SPS tunnel to the surface is a crucial issue for improving the quality of the bunch profiles suitable for tomographic reconstruction...|$|R
40|$|The present {{accuracy}} {{requirements on}} ITER parameters to be obtained primarily from magnetic measurements are demanding and, in many situations, {{they might be}} approached but not necessarily achieved with the parameter estimation process currently foreseen. In such cases, it is desirable to improve the estimation process, where possible, to achieve adequate performance. Where the accuracy requirements are still not achieved, the requirements {{will need to be}} qualified. This could mean acceptance of increased errors for conditions not impairing machine performance unacceptably, a reduction in operational space of applicability of accuracy requirements (e. g. for the diamagnetic poloidal beta measurement), separation of acceptable dynamic from static errors (e. g. for plasma-wall gap measurements) and separation of acceptable systematic from random errors (e. g. random errors due to plasma generated noise). Modification of the parameter estimation process could include use of magnetic sensors with increased performance (implying increased development time and cost), optimization of the number and position of the magnetic sensors, partial compensation of pick-up from ferromagnetic materials, estimation and partial compensation of <b>pick-up</b> from eddy <b>currents.</b> The first step of improving the ITER magnetic diagnostic specification is an assessment of the plasma parameter estimation accuracies obtainable with the present design of the system.

40|$|Emerged as a {{solid state}} {{alternative}} to photo multiplier tubes (PMTs), single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) are nowadays {{widely used in}} the field of single-photon timing applications. Custom technology SPADs assure remarkable performance, in particular a 10 counts/s dark count rate (DCR) at low temperature, a high photon detection efficiency (PDE) with a 50 % peak at 550 nm and a 30 ps (full width at half maximum, FWHM) temporal resolution, even with large area devices, have been obtained. Over the past few years, the birth of novel techniques of analysis has led to the parallelization of the measurement systems and to a consequent increasing demand for the development of monolithic arrays of detectors. Unfortunately, the implementation of a multidimensional system is a challenging task from the electrical point of view; in particular, the avalanche <b>current</b> <b>pick-up</b> circuit, used to obtain the previously reported performance, has to be modified in order to enable high parallel temporal resolution, while minimizing the electrical crosstalk probability between channels. In the past, the problem has been solved by integrating the front-end electronics next to the photodetector, {{in order to reduce the}} parasitic capacitances and consequently the filtering action on the current signal of the SPAD, leading to an improvement of the timing jitter at higher threshold. This solution has been implemented by using standard complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technologies, which, however, do not allow a complete control on the SPAD structure; for this reason the intrinsic performance of CMOS SPADs, such as DCR, PDE, and afterpulsing probability, are worse than those attainable with custom detectors. In this paper, we propose a pixel architecture, which enables the development of custom SPAD arrays in which every channel maintains the performance of the best single photodetector. The system relies on the integration of the timing signal pick-up circuit next to the photodiode, achieved by modifying the technological process flow used for the fabrication of the custom SPAD. The pixel is completed by an external standard CMOS active quenching circuit, which assures stable timing performance at quite high count rate (> 1 MHz) ...|$|R
40|$|Closure dams are {{structures}} {{that are used}} to close off basins, usually from the sea. A sand closure is the construction of a closure dam made out of sand. During the last stage of a sand closure, there is a closure gap through which the tide forces a current with flow velocities up to five metres per second. The flow pattern that occurs during a sand closure is three-dimensional. Furthermore, the sediment transport does not reach an equilibrium due to the constantly changing flow conditions and gap geometry. During sand closures, large amounts of erosion occur. Because the main costs of a sand closure lie in the transportation of sand to the building site, {{it is important to know}} how much sand is needed for the sand closure and how much sand is loss during the closing process. The quantification of the sand loss still requires attention. The currently used models require calibration factors, which are not known beforehand, to give a reasonable prediction of the sand loss. A model that can be applied to any sand closure and does not require calibration factors is desirable. To achieve this, the different processes that occur during sand closures should be parameterized and need to be quantifiable by a model. In this study the important processes of a sand closure are identified. With the results of this study, the sand loss prediction can be improved by considering the processes that are expected to have the largest contributions to the sand loss. It was found that the amount of turbulence in the flow has a large impact on the erosion. There are two mechanisms that appear to have the largest impact on the erosion during a sand closure. The first mechanism is that during a sand closure, mixing layers originate from the heads of the dams. These have higher turbulence intensities than the main current, which causes strong vertical mixing, so the sediment particles are brought up higher into the water column. It was found that possibly, these higher turbulence intensities also lead to pick-up rates orders of magnitude larger than the ones predicted by the <b>current</b> <b>pick-up</b> equations, although it is not known if extrapolating the formula of the TKE method, designed for river flow, to higher turbulence intensities is justified. Because the magnitude of the turbulence intensities seems to have a large influence on the predicted erosion velocity, it may be important for the total erosion at the closure gap. The second mechanism is that the flow is contracted downstream of the closure gap. This increases the flow velocities of the main current. Unfortunately, it is unknown what the impact of these higher flow velocities is on the turbulence at the origin of the mixing layers. It is desirable to be able to model the important mechanisms that occur during sand closures in a numerical model. The contraction of the flow behind the closure gap is already modelled by most two-dimensional and three-dimensional numerical models. It is advised to look further into the pick-up rates of sediment at higher turbulence intensities. Since there is no satisfactory formulation for the pick-up of sediment that can be implemented into a numerical model directly and the erosion at the origin of mixing layers is found to be most influential, it is recommended to carry out a physical scale model to quantify the pick-up of sediments at the origin of a mixing layer. This will be the subject of a forthcoming MSc thesis. Civil Engineering and GeosciencesHydraulic Engineerin...|$|R
