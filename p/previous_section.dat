5|$|By refraining {{from the}} advance a2-a3 White tries {{to gain a}} tempo on {{the lines of the}} <b>previous</b> <b>section,</b> making it more {{difficult}} for Black to initiate the Re8–e6–h6 or Ra8–a6–h6 lifts. After the moves 6.Be2 0-0 7.0-0 Re8 8.Nc3 Ngxe5 9.Nxe5 Nxe5 White has tried two different plans.|$|E
5|$|Cylinder threads {{may be in}} {{two basic}} configurations: Taper thread and {{parallel}} thread. These thread specifications are detailed in a <b>previous</b> <b>section.</b> The valve thread specification must exactly match the neck thread specification of the cylinder. Improperly matched neck threads can fail under pressure and can have fatal consequences.|$|E
5|$|The {{derivation}} {{outlined in}} the <b>previous</b> <b>section</b> contains all the information needed to define general relativity, describe its key properties, and address a question of crucial importance in physics, namely how the theory {{can be used for}} model-building.|$|E
30|$|Let us {{quantify}} this {{using the}} tools of the <b>previous</b> <b>sections.</b>|$|R
30|$|Finally, {{we provide}} some {{examples}} {{to illustrate the}} conclusions in the <b>previous</b> <b>sections.</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{approximate}} solutions {{introduced in}} the <b>previous</b> <b>sections</b> will be illustrated with some examples.|$|R
5|$|As a result, most geysers form {{in places}} where there is {{volcanic}} rhyolite rock which dissolves in hot water and forms mineral deposits called siliceous sinter, or geyserite, along {{the inside of the}} plumbing systems which are very slender. Over time, these deposits strengthen the channel walls by cementing the rock together tightly, thus enabling the geyser to persist, as mentioned in the <b>previous</b> <b>section.</b>|$|E
5|$|Between the two {{unstable}} regimes {{mentioned in}} the <b>previous</b> <b>section,</b> and influenced by all the factors described above that contribute to balance (trail, mass distribution, gyroscopic effects, etc.), {{there may be a}} range of forward speeds for a given bike design at which these effects steer an uncontrolled bike upright. It has been proven that neither gyroscopic effects nor positive trail are sufficient by themselves or necessary for self-stability, although they certainly can enhance hands-free control.|$|E
5|$|Deck {{decompression}} chambers {{are used}} for surface decompression, described in a <b>previous</b> <b>section.</b> Most deck decompression chambers are fitted with built in breathing systems (BIBS), which supply an alternative breathing gas to the occupants (usually oxygen), and discharge the exhaled gas outside the chamber, so the chamber gas is not excessively enriched by oxygen, which would cause an unacceptable fire hazard, and require frequent flushing with chamber gas (usually air).|$|E
30|$|In this section, we list some {{definitions}} and theory {{used in the}} <b>previous</b> <b>sections.</b>|$|R
30|$|In this section, {{we provide}} {{an example to}} {{illustrate}} results from the <b>previous</b> <b>sections.</b>|$|R
30|$|All {{the results}} {{presented}} in <b>previous</b> <b>sections</b> remain true for d-multiple sequences as well.|$|R
5|$|Since exp(1) {{is equal}} to e and exp(x) {{satisfies}} this exponential identity, it immediately follows that exp(x) coincides with the repeated-multiplication definition of e'x for integer x, and it also follows that rational powers denote (positive) roots as usual, so exp(x) coincides with the e'x definitions in the <b>previous</b> <b>section</b> for all real x by continuity.|$|E
5|$|During 2011–14, {{the club}} sold all 36,000 of its {{allocated}} season tickets each season and experienced an average match attendance {{that is very}} close to its maximum seating capacity (see table in <b>previous</b> <b>section).</b> Consequently, during the 2014–15 season, an expansion of the stadium was undertaken. The South Stand was extended {{with the addition of a}} third tier which, in conjunction with an additional three rows of pitch side seating, increased stadium capacity to approximately 55,000. Construction commenced on the South Stand in April 2014 and was completed for the start of the 2015–16 season.|$|E
5|$|Special {{relativity}} {{is defined}} {{in the absence of}} gravity, so for practical applications, it is a suitable model whenever gravity can be neglected. Bringing gravity into play, and assuming the universality of free fall, an analogous reasoning as in the <b>previous</b> <b>section</b> applies: there are no global inertial frames. Instead there are approximate inertial frames moving alongside freely falling particles. Translated into the language of spacetime: the straight time-like lines that define a gravity-free inertial frame are deformed to lines that are curved relative to each other, suggesting that the inclusion of gravity necessitates a change in spacetime geometry.|$|E
30|$|In this section, we give {{an example}} to {{demonstrate}} the results obtained in <b>previous</b> <b>sections.</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{material}} {{proposed in}} the <b>previous</b> <b>sections</b> can be summarized for system implementation as follows.|$|R

5|$|M-45 was {{originally}} designated in the UP {{on what is}} now M-95 by July 1, 1919. The highway ran between M-12 in Sagola and M-15 in Humboldt Township. When the United States Numbered Highway System was created on November 11, 1926, US2 replaced most of M-12 through the UP. M-45 was extended south of Sagola to {{the north side of}} Iron Mountain. Along with this change, M-69 replaced another <b>previous</b> <b>section</b> of M-12 and all of M-90. M-69 ran concurrently with M-45 between Sagola and Randville to connect these two highway segments. By 1933, M-45 was extended concurrently along US2/US141 into Iron Mountain and then as an independent routing through Kingsford to the Wisconsin state line. Before the next year, the M-95 replaced M-45 in the UP.|$|E
5|$|The player's ship is {{protected}} by a shield which decreases when attacked by enemies. If the shield is fully depleted, the player dies and must start the game again from a <b>previous</b> <b>section</b> of the fight without any collected power-ups. Nevertheless, the player can reclaim the missing power-ups from {{the ruins of the}} destroyed ship. Shield, energy, and ammunition suppliers are dispersed among the levels to help players increase their resources. The player can also collect equipment items which grant special powers. For example, the Quad Laser modifies the laser weapons to fire four shots at once instead of the standard two, while the Cloaking Device renders the player invisible to enemies for 30 seconds. During the game, the player may also deploy the Guide-Bot, an assistant that keeps track of the next objective and shows the player the way to a specific target.|$|E
5|$|Within Mississauga, {{the freeway}} {{encounters}} its narrowest right-of-way, sandwiched between residential subdivisions {{on either side}} that prevent further expansion. It crosses the Credit River Valley, where a second bridge is under construction. The segment east of the Credit River is being examined for expansion possibilities, but, like the <b>previous</b> <b>section,</b> there is little room for more lanes without property acquisition. After crossing Etobicoke Creek, which forms the boundary between Mississauga / Peel Region and Toronto, the route curves eastward to meet Highway427 at a large sprawling interchange. The QEW formerly continued beyond this interchange to the old Toronto city limits at the Humber River; this section was downloaded from provincial to municipal ownership on April1, 1997, and {{became part of the}} Gardiner Expressway.|$|E

5|$|There {{are many}} Vithoba temples in Maharashtra, {{and some in}} Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. However, the main centre of worship is Vithoba's temple in Pandharpur. The temple's date of {{establishment}} is disputed, though {{it is clear that}} it was standing at the time of Dnyaneshwar in the 13thcentury. Along with Vithoba and his consorts—Rukmini, Satyabhama and Radha—other Vaishnava deities are worshipped. These include: Venkateshwara, a form of Vishnu; Mahalakshmi, a form of Vishnu's consort Lakshmi; Garuda and Hanuman (see <b>previous</b> <b>section).</b> Shaiva deities are also worshipped, such as: Ganesha, the elephant-headed god of wisdom and beginnings; Khandoba, a form of Shiva; and Annapurna, a form of Shiva's consort Parvati. The samadhis (memorials) of saints like Namdev, Chokhamela and Janabai, and of devotees such as Pundalik and Kanhopatra, are in and around the temple. Other significant temples in Maharashtra are located: at Dehu, the birthplace of Tukaram, which attracts visitors at all ekadashis of the year; at Kole (Satara district), in memory of Ghadge Bova, which has a fair on the fifth day of the bright fortnight (waxing moon) in Magha month; at Kolhapur and Rajapur, which host fairs on Shayani Ekadashi and Prabodini Ekadashi; Madhe— a refuge of the Pandharpur image when it was moved to protect from Muslim invaders and finally at the Birla Mandir in Shahad.|$|E

30|$|In the <b>previous</b> <b>sections,</b> we {{have assumed}} {{deterministic}} traffic rates for communications between VMs and constant power consumption for active servers; however, in practice these quantities are random and vary as functions of time. In this section, we extend the optimization {{problem of the}} <b>previous</b> <b>sections</b> to a more realistic model, where VM communication rates and server power consumption are considered as random variables.|$|R
