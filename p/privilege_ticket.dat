5000|$|Some railway employees, {{their spouses}} or {{partners}} and their dependent children {{are able to}} travel on the railway network free of charge or at a substantial discount on the standard adult or child fare, {{depending on the type}} of staff travel pass, privilege pass or staff identity card they possess. In cases where free travel is not available—either on certain routes or on all routes—the standard discount for adults is 75% of the full adult fare (i.e. a quarter-rate fare), although certain cheap-rate tickets (such as Off Peak Day Returns) are not available in conjunction with the discount. Such tickets are endorsed with status code PRIV. [...] Children travel at an 88% discount on the standard adult fare, usually subject to a maximum fare of £2.00. The status code for child privilege tickets is CHPRV. An [...] "Accompanied Animals and Articles" [...] ticket can be issued in conjunction with a <b>privilege</b> <b>ticket,</b> although as noted above such tickets are very rarely issued now; such a ticket would be endorsed with status code PRAAA, and would be at a discount of 88% to the standard adult fare, subject to a maximum fare of £1.00.|$|E

50|$|Another stock sale {{occurred}} late in 1997 {{and early}} in 1998. It added 105,989 new shareholders and raised over $24 million, money {{used for the}} Lambeau Field redevelopment project. Priced at $200 per share, fans bought 120,010 shares during the 17-week sale, which ended March 16, 1998.

Shares of stock include voting rights, but the redemption price is minimal, no dividends are ever paid, the stock cannot appreciate in value, and stock ownership brings no season <b>ticket</b> <b>privileges.</b>|$|R

That very same Ethics Committee would later reprimand Kelvin Sampson {{as a result of}} the NCAA findings, placing him on probation for three years during which he would not be eligible to serve in any official capacity for the NABC, be considered for Coach of the Year honors or receive Final Four <b>ticket</b> <b>privileges.</b>|$|R
25|$|If Not Now, When ? is {{an album}} that expresses sincere love, peace, and happiness. Each song taps {{into its own}} theme that speaks on love and “hailing halleluiah every day.” The songs speak on life and the process and journey to {{discovering}} happiness. Although much of the album takes on a very peaceful tone, Incubus also incorporates a political perspective in their song Thieves. The song thieves speak on “the paragon of civilization.” In this song, he poses the question “why should the thieves have all the fun, selling water by the river?” He references to “god fearing white Americans” and insinuates that in America, that <b>privilege</b> is the <b>ticket</b> to happiness.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{talks about}} the {{requirements}} of computer-mediated communication (CMC) for group support. An overview of CMC's historical evolution is presented. Advantages of CMC include opportunity for group to exhibit “collective intelligence”, asynchronous support of communication process, self-tailoring of communication structures by users and groups, and the integration into the communication system of other computer resources and information systems. The main advantage of using CMC is in the very fundamental nature of the communication medium. The asynchronous approaches to group problem solving free individuals to deal with problems in those cognitive processes at which they excel. Seven asynchronous group process factors are also presented. A CMC metaphor is also presented. The metaphor components discussed are conferences, messages, activities and notifications. A conference can be tailored according to activities. An activity can be attached to any communication item. When triggered, it will execute a program or procedure in the local or remote host. Notification functions include alerting, closure and tracking. The concepts of roles, <b>privileges,</b> and <b>tickets</b> are also discussed. Finally, the components of two CMC systems are presented. These components include an object-oriented database, distributed user and group agents, a master virtual machine, and a SGML interface specification language. ...|$|R

50|$|White House tours {{were often}} in high demand. By 1981, a Director of the White House Visitor Center {{was in charge}} of the operation. During the early 1980s, as many as 6,000 {{visitors}} were accommodated each day, with just as many turned away. Special pleas for tours coming from Washington officials had to be dealt with frequently. In 1981, there was a dispute between First Lady Nancy Reagan and New York U.S. Representative Thomas Downey over his free <b>tickets</b> <b>privileges</b> having been suspended. During the early 1980s recession, White House tours remained fully booked even when other Washington attractions saw declining attendance; the Visitor Center continued to process well over one million visits a year. White House Visitors Office personnel are constantly caught between trying to satisfy demands and expectations for tours and events, and preserving the dignity of the presidential office and setting.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper was}} {{prepared}} for the {{annual conference of the}} National Center for Philanthropy and Law, held at the NYU Law School, held October 24 - 25, 2013. The overall topic was “Tax Issues Affecting Colleges and Universities,” and I was asked to address specifically those issues relating to athletics. This paper considers two specific issues that have in common only that they involve college sports, and are plagued by egregiously bad, (in this case, egregiously generous), tax treatment: the failure of the IRS to regard any part of the revenue from college sports as unrelated business income, and the choice by Congress to allow taxpayers to deduct 80 % of contributions that they make to colleges or their “booster clubs,” even when those contributions entitle the donors to special <b>privileges</b> in purchasing <b>tickets</b> to college athletic events. Most readers are probably familiar with the general rules regarding charitable contributions deductions, but a word about the unrelated business income tax may be helpful. An organization may qualify (or continue to qualify) as a tax-exempt organization, eligible to receive tax-deductible contributions, if its activities are primarily charitable. However, if the organization regularly carries on trade or business activities that are unrelated to its exempt purpose, the income from those activities is subject to federal income taxation at the same rates applicable to for-profit corporations. Although those rates are low for small businesses (those earning less than $ 75, 000 per year), corporate earnings in excess of that amount are taxed at a rate of 34 % on up to ten million dollars of income, and 35 % beyond that amount. The unrelated business income tax raises very little revenue, but is thought to have an in terrorem effect, discouraging nonprofit organizations from engaging in unrelated business activities. While the unrelated business tax exists primarily because of Congressional concerns about unfair competition with for-profit businesses, a better description of its actual effect is that it discourages nonprofit organizations from pursuit of business activities that do not further any exempt purpose...|$|R
