30|$|To {{confront the}} {{aforementioned}} challenges, this paper proposes Security-first Architecture, a concept which enforces systematic and active defenses using Active Security <b>Processors.</b> In systems built {{based on this}} concept, traditional <b>processors</b> (i.e., Computation <b>Processors)</b> are monitored and protected by Active Security <b>Processors.</b> The two types of <b>processors</b> execute on their own physically-isolated resources, including memory, disks, network and I/O devices. The Active Security <b>Processors</b> are provided with dedicated channels to access all {{the resources of the}} Computation <b>Processors</b> but not vice versa. This allows the Active Security <b>Processors</b> to actively detect and tackle malicious activities in the Computation <b>Processors</b> with minimum performance degradation while protecting themselves from the attacks launched from the Computation <b>Processors</b> thanks to the resource isolation.|$|R

50|$|CNN <b>processors</b> {{have been}} {{implemented}} and are currently available as semiconductors and there are plans to migrate CNN <b>processors</b> to emerging technologies in the future. Semiconductor-based CNN <b>processors</b> can be segmented into analog CNN <b>processors,</b> digital CNN <b>processors,</b> and CNN <b>processors</b> emulated using digital <b>processors.</b> Analog CNN <b>processors</b> {{were the first to}} be developed. Analog computers were fairly common during the 1950 and 1960s, but they gradually were replaced by digital computers the 1970s. Analog <b>processors</b> were considerably faster in certain applications such as optimizing differential equations and modeling nonlinearities, but the reason why analog computing lost favor was the lack of precision and the difficulty to configure an analog computer to solve a complex equation. Analog CNN <b>processors</b> share some of the same advantages as their predecessors, specifically speed. The first analog CNN <b>processors</b> were able to perform real-time ultra-high frame-rate (>10,000 frame/s) processing unachievable by digital <b>processors.</b> The analog implementation of CNN <b>processors</b> requires less area and consumes less power than their digital counterparts. Although the accuracy of analog CNN <b>processors</b> does not compare to their digital counterparts, for many applications, noise and process variances are small enough not to perceptually affect the image quality.|$|R
5|$|From {{the advent}} of very-large-scale {{integration}} (VLSI) computer-chip fabrication technology in the 1970s until about 1986, speed-up in computer architecture was driven by doubling computer word size—the amount of information the <b>processor</b> can manipulate per cycle. Increasing the word size reduces the number of instructions the <b>processor</b> must execute to perform an operation on variables whose sizes are greater than {{the length of the}} word. For example, where an 8-bit <b>processor</b> must add two 16-bit integers, the <b>processor</b> must first add the 8 lower-order bits from each integer using the standard addition instruction, then add the 8 higher-order bits using an add-with-carry instruction and the carry bit from the lower order addition; thus, an 8-bit <b>processor</b> requires two instructions to complete a single operation, where a 16-bit <b>processor</b> would be able to complete the operation with a single instruction.|$|E
5|$|However, power {{consumption}} P by a chip {{is given by}} the equation P = C × V 2 × F, where C is the capacitance being switched per clock cycle (proportional {{to the number of}} transistors whose inputs change), V is voltage, and F is the <b>processor</b> frequency (cycles per second). Increases in frequency increase the amount of power used in a <b>processor.</b> Increasing <b>processor</b> {{power consumption}} led ultimately to Intel's May 8, 2004 cancellation of its Tejas and Jayhawk processors, which is generally cited as the end of frequency scaling as the dominant computer architecture paradigm.|$|E
5|$|In March 2005, Intel {{announced}} that it was working on a new Itanium <b>processor,</b> codenamed Tukwila, to be released in 2007.

5|$|There {{have been}} seven {{versions}} of the iPad. The first generation established design precedents, some of which, such as the home button placement, have persisted through all models. The 2nd-generation iPad (iPad 2) introduced a new thinner design, a dual-core Apple A5 <b>processor,</b> and VGA front-facing and 720p rear-facing cameras designed for FaceTime video calling. The third generation added a Retina Display, the new Apple A5X <b>processor</b> with a quad-core graphics <b>processor,</b> a 5-megapixel camera, HD 1080p video recording, voice dictation, and 4G (LTE).

The iPad Air added the Apple A7 <b>processor</b> and the Apple M7 motion coprocessor, and reduced the thickness {{for the first time}} since the iPad 2. The iPad Air 2 added the Apple A8X <b>processor,</b> the Apple M8 motion coprocessor, an 8-megapixel camera, and the Touch ID fingerprint sensor; and further reduced the thickness.
