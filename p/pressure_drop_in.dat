5|$|Early on September22, an {{aircraft}} fix located Vera 175km (110mi) north-northeast of Saipan. Throughout {{the course of}} the day, periodic reconnaissance flights into the storm indicated that Vera had begun to rapidly intensify. By 1800UTC later that day, data analysis concluded that the tropical cyclone had reached typhoon intensity. Rapid intensification continued into the following day, as the typhoon's maximum sustained winds and barometric pressure quickly rose and fell, respectively. Concurrently, Vera's size grew to a point at which it spanned 250km (155mi) across. At 0600UTC the following day, Vera achieved its minimum estimated barometric pressure at 895mbar (hPa; 26.43inHg). This indicated a 75mbar (hPa; 2.22inHg) <b>pressure</b> <b>drop</b> <b>in</b> the preceding 24hours. Upon reaching its minimum pressure, Vera was estimated to have attained winds equivalent to a Category5– the highest classification possible on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. The typhoon's winds continued to increase before peaking at 1200UTC on September23, when reconnaissance aircraft reported maximum sustained winds of 305km/h (190mph). Upon peaking in wind speed, Vera was located 645km (400mi) northeast of Guam. The tropical cyclone's ability to quickly intensify was attributed to conducive atmospheric divergence and highly sustainable sea surface temperatures.|$|E
