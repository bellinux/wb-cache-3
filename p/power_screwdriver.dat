40|$|Athletic {{health care}} {{professionals}} have been concerned about how to optimize the emergency care the cervical spine-injured football player receives on the field. Much of the discussion has centered on how to best expose and prepare the airway for rescue breathing in the quickest and safest manner possible. This study compared the time required and the extraneous motion induced at the cervical spine during three traditional and one new airway exposure and preparation technique. Twelve subjects wearing football helmets and shoulder pads were exposed to multiple trials of airway exposure via face mask repositioning using a manual screwdriver, <b>power</b> <b>screwdriver,</b> and the Trainer's Angel cutting device. Subjects also underwent airway preparation using the pocket mask insertion technique. Cervical spine motion was measured in two dimensions using an optoelectronic motion analysis system. Time and qualitative assessment were obtained through videotape analysis. Significant {{differences were found between}} the techniques with respect to time and cervical spine motion. The pocket mask allowed quicker activation of rescue breathing than the other three traditional techniques. There was no significant difference in the amount of extraneous motion induced at the cervical spine between the pocket mask, manual screwdriver, and <b>power</b> <b>screwdriver</b> techniques. The Trainer's Angel induced significantly more motion than the other three techniques in each of the four motions measured. Changes in traditional protocols used to treat cervical spine-injured football players on the field are recommended based on these data...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a survey of}} functional modeling approaches and describes a strategy to establish functional knowledge exchange between them. This survey is focused on a comparison of function meanings and representations. It is argued that functions represented as input-output flow transformations correspond to behaviors in the approaches that characterize functions as intended behaviors. Based on this result a strategy is presented to relate the different meanings of function between the approaches, establishing functional knowledge exchange between them. It is shown that this strategy is able to preserve more functional information than the functional knowledge exchange methodology of Kitamura, Mizoguchi, and co-workers. The strategy proposed here consists of two steps. In step one, operation-on-flow functions are translated into behaviors. In step two, intended behavior functions are derived from behaviors. The two-step strategy and its benefits are demonstrated by relating functional models of a <b>power</b> <b>screwdriver</b> between methodologies...|$|E

25|$|Several {{kinds of}} case {{trimmers}} are available. Die-based trimmers {{have an open}} top, and allow the case to be trimmed with a file during the loading process. Manual trimmers usually have a base that has a shellholder {{at one end and}} a cutting bit at the opposite end, with a locking mechanism to hold the case tight and in alignment with the axis of the cutter, similar to a small lathe. Typically the device is cranked by hand, but sometimes they have attachments to allow the use of a drill or <b>powered</b> <b>screwdriver.</b> <b>Powered</b> case trimmers are also available. They usually consist of a motor (electric drills are sometimes used) and special dies or fittings that hold the case to be trimmed at the appropriate length, letting the motor do the work of trimming.|$|R
5000|$|A {{wide variety}} of <b>power</b> <b>screwdrivers</b> range from a simple 'stick'-type with batteries, a motor, and a tip holder all inline, to {{powerful}} [...] "pistol" [...] type VSR (variable-speed reversible) Cordless drills that also function as screwdrivers. This is particularly useful as drilling a pilot hole before driving a screw is a common operation. Special combination drill-driver bits and adapters let an operator rapidly alternate between the two. Variations include impact drivers, which provide two types of 'hammering' force for improved performance in certain situations, and [...] "right-angle" [...] drivers for use in tight spaces. Many options and enhancements, such as built-in bubble levels, high/low gear selection, magnetic screw holders, adjustable-torque clutches, keyless chucks, 'gyroscopic' control, etc., are available.|$|R
50|$|The #6-32 UNC is a thicker screw {{with a more}} coarse thread. This {{makes it}} more {{suitable}} for fastening larger parts and thicker materials requiring increased holding strength. Its larger size and coarse thread {{make it easier to}} work with during assembly, with less risk of cross threading. The integrated flange provides greater holding strength with less risk of pull through. The hex head makes it easier to work with during assembly with <b>powered</b> torque <b>screwdrivers.</b>|$|R

40|$|This is {{an article}} from the journal, Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part H: Journal of Engineering in Medicine [© IMechE]. It is also {{available}} at: [URL] use of <b>power</b> <b>screwdrivers</b> and drills for tapping and screw insertion in surgery is becoming more common. It has been established from clinical observations {{that the use of}} a small air drill for inserting self-tapping screws provides improved coaxial alignment and precision, and that the drill should be stopped before the screw head is completely seated on the plate, presumably {{to reduce the risk of}} over-tightening. The risk of overrun and over-tightening during tapping and screw insertion is increased with the use of power tools. Prevention of over-tightening is dependent upon when the surgeon detects the onset of tightening, both visually and from the feel of the rapid increase in torque. If detection is too late, then over-tightening or stripping can occur. This study is concerned with using a mechatronic screwdriver to control the tapping depth and to prevent the over-tightening of screws. The effects of various parameters upon the torque profile during tapping and screw insertion have been investigated in synthetic bone and sheep tibia. An automated system is proposed for preventing over-tightening of pre-tapped and self-tapping screws when attaching a surgical plate to a sheep tibia in vitro. The system was used to attach a plate to a sheep tibia using self-tapping screws. The mean torque of the screws inserted using the automated system was 35 per cent of the stripping torque...|$|R
40|$|The {{electrical}} energy consumption of battery-operated screwdrivers, which {{are widely used}} in many industries, e. g. automotive, heavy, chemical, etc., can be considerably reduced. This would allow increasing the service life of a battery and reducing {{the time of its}} charging, thus increasing the productivity and decreasing the prime cost of this battery. It is shown that up to 17. 9 % of {{electrical energy}} could be saved at assembling fixed threaded joints by removing <b>power</b> from the <b>screwdriver</b> immediately after reaching the required tightening torque...|$|R
50|$|A rundown fixture, {{also known}} as a joint simulator, is used during the {{calibration}} process to help test <b>power</b> tools (electric <b>screwdrivers,</b> air screwdrivers, pulse tools, cordless screwdrivers, nutrunners, etc.). A joint simulator is placed on top of the transducers. An adapter bit is inserted into the power tool and is mated to top of the joint simulator. By using springs of different stiffness or stacking Belleville washers in set patterns, the joint simulator can replicate soft, medium, or hard joints. This is important when trying to repeat how a tool may be used on an actual process.|$|R
50|$|The {{demand for}} {{customizable}} e-cigarettes prompted some manufacturers to produce devices with interchangeable components {{that could be}} selected by the user. In 2009, Joyetech developed the eGo series which offered the <b>power</b> of the <b>screwdriver</b> model and a user-activated switch to a wide market. The clearomizer was invented in 2009. Originating from the cartomizer design, it contained the wicking material, an e-liquid chamber, and an atomizer coil within a single clear component. The clearomizer allows the user to monitor the liquid level in the device. Soon after the clearomizer reached the market, replaceable atomizer coils and variable voltage batteries were introduced. Clearomizers and eGo batteries became the best-selling customizable e-cigarette components in early 2012.|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} a Master Thesis in Industrial Design Engineering performed by two students at Luleå University of Technology, and it comprises 30 credits {{over a period}} of 20 weeks during the spring of 2015. The thesis describes a development project of a roof solution to a new railroad based logistics system called Turn Dumper, developed by Kiruna Wagon. The Turn Dumper wagon requires a cover since it has a closed bottom and no drains, and it is thus important to protect the bulk material from precipitation and prevent it from dusting out. The main premise for the cover is that it must be adapted to the Turn Dumper unloading station and wagon as well as enable loading with both wheel loader and silo. Further {{it is important that the}} opening and closing process of the cover can be performed in a safe manner with respect to the system as well as the user. To ensure that freight transport by the Turn Dumper system can be performed safely, the roof solution should have a locking mechanism to keep it closed. The process used in this project is a customised version of Kiruna Wagon’s own routine for product development. In addition to this routine, Kiruna Wagon has implied Lean Product Development in their work process and therefore Lean has been a basis for this thesis as well. The process this project has followed is divided into five steps; planning, literature review, feasibility study, creativity and realisation respectively final product development. During the feasibility study were, amongst others, benchmarking and user studies used to find the needs for a roof solution to Turn Dumper and from these be able to state a requirement specification. In the creativity and realisation phase different creative methods were used to generate as many concepts as possible. Thereafter the concepts were evaluated and the number of concepts was reduced until only one concept remained. This concept was detailed design in the final product development phase and the result for the Turn Dumper roof solution is a two-piece roof with a linkage system on the short ends of the wagon that is controlled by a hydraulic system. The linkage system consists of two four-bar linkages, each rotating one roof piece down along the long side of the loading body. The two linkages are connected by two rods and in their connecting point a hydraulic cylinder is mounted. The cylinder is pushed upward by the pressure created of a hydraulic pump, operated by a hand held <b>powered</b> <b>screwdriver.</b> The weight of the linkage and hydraulic system is approximately 550 kilograms and the feasibility of the concept was shown by building a function model in scale 1. 10 and a proof of concept prototype in scale 1 : 20.

50|$|Founded by the American {{inventor}} Albert J. Dremel in 1932, {{the company}} is located in Racine, Wisconsin. Albert J. Dremel held 55 patents across {{a wide range of}} inventions, including the electric eraser, electric fish scaler, electric shoe polisher, electric <b>screwdriver,</b> <b>power</b> sanders, scroll saws, a device to keep tabs on chicken's egg production and first design of the now standard walk behind rotary lawn mower. His first product released within the company was with an electric razor blade sharpener. This success was soon brought to a halt after popularity of cheap, disposable razors came into effect. This then forced Albert J. Dremel to come up with his next invention, seen as the most important of his career - the high speed rotary tool, later named the Dremel Multitool. Compact, lightweight and versatile, this invention was successful in the hobby and craft market.|$|R
