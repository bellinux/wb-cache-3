5|$|BART {{relies on}} unused ticket values on {{discarded}} low-value cards for additional revenue, {{as much as}} $9.9million. The <b>paper</b> <b>ticket</b> technology {{is identical to the}} Washington Metro's former paper fare card, though the BART system does not charge higher fares during rush hour.|$|E
5|$|Fares on BART are {{comparable}} to those of commuter rail systems and are higher than those of most subways, especially for long trips. The fare is based on a formula that takes into account both the length and speed of the trip. A surcharge is added for trips traveling through the Transbay Tube, to Oakland International Airport, to San Francisco International Airport, and/or through San Mateo County, a county that is {{not a member of the}} San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit District. Passengers can use refillable paper-plastic-composite tickets, on which fares are stored via a magnetic strip, to enter and exit the system. The exit faregate prints the remaining balance on the ticket each time the passenger exits the station. A <b>paper</b> <b>ticket</b> can be refilled at a ticket machine, the remaining balance on any ticket can be applied towards the purchase of a new one, or a card is captured by the exit gate when the balance reaches zero; multiple low value cards can be combined to create a larger value card but only at specific ticket exchange locations, located at some BART stations. The magnetic strip-based technology was developed by Cubic Transportation Systems with a contract awarded in 1974.|$|E
25|$|<b>Paper</b> <b>tickets</b> {{are charged}} {{on the same}} zone-based rules as for Underground and DLR <b>paper</b> <b>tickets,</b> which were {{expanded}} {{to take in the}} extra zones covered. Watford Junction has its own fare scale. <b>Paper</b> <b>tickets</b> are significantly more expensive than using Oyster PAYG.|$|R
50|$|E-tickets in {{the airline}} {{industry}} were devised in about 1994, and have now largely replaced the older multi-layered <b>paper</b> <b>ticketing</b> systems. Since 1 June 2008, it has been mandatory for IATA members to use e-ticketing. Where <b>paper</b> <b>tickets</b> are still available, some airlines charge a fee for issuing <b>paper</b> <b>tickets.</b>|$|R
50|$|The fare {{structure}} for <b>paper</b> single <b>tickets</b> was simplified in January 2006. Fares for single <b>paper</b> <b>tickets</b> {{have been set}} deliberately high {{in order to encourage}} users to use either Travelcards or Oyster pre-pay fares, which are substantially lower (by up to £2.50 per journey) than <b>paper</b> <b>tickets.</b>|$|R

25|$|A single-fare <b>paper</b> <b>ticket</b> is also {{available}} for infrequent travellers and visitors.|$|E
25|$|Most—but not all—public {{transport}} {{requires the}} purchase of a ticket to generate revenue for the operators. Tickets may be bought either in advance, or {{at the time of the}} journey, or the carrier may allow both methods. Passengers may be issued with a <b>paper</b> <b>ticket,</b> a metal or plastic token, or a magnetic or electronic card (smart card, contactless smart card). Sometimes a ticket has to be validated, e.g. a <b>paper</b> <b>ticket</b> has to be stamped, or an electronic ticket has to be checked in.|$|E
25|$|In November 2009, TransLink {{introduced}} cashless tickets {{during peak}} times, only accepting only go cards and pre-purchased <b>paper</b> <b>tickets</b> {{in an effort}} to improve service efficiency. In late 2009, TransLink scrapped monthly and weekly <b>paper</b> <b>tickets,</b> with plans to eliminate <b>paper</b> <b>tickets</b> by the end of 2010. On 4 January 2010, to encourage the use of the go card, off-peak discounts and a direct debit top-up option were introduced. At the same time, TransLink increased fares and also announced fares would increase by a further 45% over the following three years.|$|R

5000|$|As of July 1st, 2017, {{the fare}} zone system was {{eliminated}} [...] {{as part of}} a system-wide reorganization of fares, which included a fare increase and elimination of <b>paper</b> <b>tickets</b> and passes on YRT-operated buses. (Due to issues with the Presto card, <b>paper</b> <b>tickets</b> will still be used on TTC operated buses) ...|$|R
25|$|Originally, TransLink had {{proposed}} to scrap paper-based ticketing entirely, but following controversy over this proposal single-trip paper tickets were retained, whilst other <b>paper</b> <b>ticket</b> formats (weekly, monthly, daily and off-peak) were abolished. Apart from frequent user schemes, periodic ticketing formats {{have not been}} introduced for go card since its inception.|$|E
25|$|Single Journey Fares {{are valid}} only for single trip between any two points. They are issued on <b>paper</b> <b>ticket</b> by the bus conductor. All fare {{payments}} {{must be made}} in cash. The fare depends on distance of the destination. Single Journey fare are not valid for transfers. Ordinary and Limited bus service have same fares.|$|E
25|$|Tri-Rail {{participates in}} the EASY Card {{regional}} smartcard-based fare collection system along with Miami-Dade Transit. Purely paper tickets are also available for same-day or weekend use. A <b>paper</b> <b>ticket</b> or an EASY Card with a paper-based transfer receipt (created after a confirmed trip is completed) {{can be used to}} obtain transfer discounts when transferring to Broward County Transit as well as Palm Tran. Only EASY Cards may be used to obtain a transfer discount when transferring to Miami-Dade Transit.|$|E

25|$|In January 2010, {{in a move}} to {{encourage}} the use of the go card, TransLink changed the fare structure by increasing the price of <b>paper</b> <b>tickets</b> to make the go card cheaper than <b>paper</b> <b>tickets.</b> In some cases the increase was as much as 40%. Although more users were using the go card than before, the move created another issue given the limited number of train stations selling the go card at the time. Some users could not buy the go card and had to continue to use <b>paper</b> <b>tickets</b> with higher fares. In response, TransLink confirmed more stations would begin selling the go card.|$|R
25|$|Smartcard fares were {{slightly}} cheaper than standard single and return fares from ticket machines. For example, a journey {{within a single}} zone cost €1.25 with the card, compared to €1.50 (€1.60 during peak time) single with a <b>paper</b> <b>ticket,</b> or €2.80 return. Daily, 7-day and 30-day tickets generally worked out cheaper, unless used only rarely. Luas smartcards were unable to store multiple-journey tickets and these tickets were issued on paper only until May 2014, since all tickets have been loaded onto the new Leap cards.|$|E
25|$|The Oyster card is a {{contactless}} {{smart card}} system introduced for the public in 2003, {{which can be used}} to pay individual fares (pay as you go) or to carry various Travelcards and other passes. It is used by holding the card close to the yellow card reader. Card readers are found on ticket gates where otherwise a <b>paper</b> <b>ticket</b> could be fed through, allowing the gate to open and the passenger to walk through, and on stand-alone Oyster validators, which do not operate a barrier. Since 2010, Oyster Pay as you go has been available on all National Rail services within London. Oyster Pay as you go has a set of daily maximum charges that are the same as buying the nearest equivalent Day Travelcard.|$|E
25|$|Travelcards {{for seven}} days or longer are known as season tickets and allow travel {{at any time of}} the day. When bought at a London Underground station or other Transport for London agent, one day Travelcards are sold on a <b>paper</b> <b>ticket</b> with a {{magnetic}} stripe and Travelcards lasting seven days or more are loaded on to an Oyster Card. A monthly travelcard (valid for between 28 and 31 days depending on month) is sold for 3.84 times the price of a 7-day card, while annual travelcards are sold for the price of 40 7-day tickets. The price of a travelcard valid for between one month and one year will be the sum of the relevant number of months, plus a pro-rata monthly rate for the number of days in the final month. As 40 weekly tickets cost approximately the same as a 10-month-12-day ticket, it is not possible in practice to buy a travelcard for a period between 10M12D and 1 year, as an annual pass is cheaper and will be issued anyway.|$|E
5000|$|After February 2014, <b>paper</b> <b>tickets</b> for {{passengers}} on commuter services were abolished, and passengers {{were required to}} use Myki. <b>Paper</b> <b>tickets</b> remain for travel outside the Myki zone, such as to Warrnambool, Bairnsdale, Swan Hill, Shepparton or Albury. Passengers with Myki Pass who want to travel beyond the Myki area can purchase paper [...] "extension tickets" [...] to cover {{the rest of their}} journey.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{concerns}} {{the replacement of}} <b>paper</b> <b>tickets</b> with smart card tickets for public transportation. By contrasting the visibility of ticket information to users of <b>paper</b> <b>tickets</b> and smart card <b>tickets,</b> this <b>paper</b> describes the move from local information on <b>paper</b> <b>tickets</b> to distributed information on smart cards. Using the concept of ‘networked visibility’, this paper argues that this move has resulted in less informed travelers and more informed providers. In order to restore the accessibility of ticket information to users, we present one possible solution, ARTick, a mobile phone smart card reader app. ARTick shows that smart cards can make complete ticket information visible to the user, whenever and wherever this information is needed...|$|R

25|$|The Travelcard is an inter-modal travel {{ticket for}} {{unlimited}} {{use on the}} London Underground, London Overground, TfL Rail, Docklands Light Railway, Tramlink, London Buses and National Rail services in the Greater London area. Travelcards can be purchased {{for a period of}} time varying from one day to a year, from Transport for London, National Rail and their agents. Depending on where it is purchased, and the length of validity, a Travelcard is either printed on a <b>paper</b> <b>ticket</b> with a magnetic stripe or encoded onto an Oyster card, Transport for London's contactless electronic smart card. The cost of a Travelcard is determined by the area it covers and, for this purpose, London is divided into a number of fare zones. The Travelcard season ticket for unlimited travel on London Buses and the London Underground was launched on 22 May 1983 by London Transport. One Day Travelcards and validity on other transport modes were added from 1984 onwards. The introduction of the Travelcard caused an increase in patronage and reduced the number of tickets that needed to be purchased by passengers.|$|E

2500|$|In January 2004, on the {{day that}} the {{pay-as-you-go}} system went live on all Oyster cards, some season ticket passengers were prevented from making a second journey on their travelcard. Upon investigation each had a negative prepay balance. This was widely reported as a major bug in the system. However, the reason for the [...] "bug" [...] was that some season ticket holders were passing through zones not included on their tickets. The existing paper system could not prevent this kind of misuse as the barriers only checked if a <b>paper</b> <b>ticket</b> was valid in the zone the barrier was in.|$|E
2500|$|Passengers can {{purchase}} a single-journey <b>paper</b> <b>ticket</b> at the ticket booth in the shelter. In 2013, TransJakarta introduced {{the use of}} prepaid cards or e-tickets for passenger use. The prepaid cards that are eligible as ticket are bank-issued cards of BRI BRizzi, BCA Flazz, BNI Tapcash, Mandiri e-money, Bank DKI JakCard, and Bank Mega MegaCash. The prepaid cards can be purchased and topped-up at any ticket booth in the shelter throughout the system, or at the ATM of the issuing bank. The prepaid cards, except for Bank DKI JakCard and Bank Mega MegaCash, are also valid as ticket in the Jabodetabek Commuter Train system as of June 2014, easing the integration plan between the BRT and the commuter train system. In April and May 2014, the TransJakarta management started the compulsory use of the e-tickets at several terminus in the system, based on news said that the BCA Flazz Card {{can also be used}} in Jabodetabek Commuter Train. In mid-October 2014, 56 percent passengers have used e-tickets. Now, all TransJakarta corridors and shelters applied the compulsory use of the e-tickets, since February 21, 2015. August 17, 2016 marks the start of tap-out system trial in Corridor 1 (Blok M - Kota), while similar trial was started on September 9, 2016 in Corridor 2. The system is meant to control the flow of people {{going in and out of}} the shelters, discourage illegal entrance to and exit from the shelters, and to encourage sales and usage of the [...] "e-tickets". In October 2016, the system had been implemented in all corridors of TransJakarta.|$|E
