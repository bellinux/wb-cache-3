30|$|The {{purpose of}} network {{security}} {{is to provide}} a protection mechanism to prevent the <b>protected</b> <b>subject</b> from being attacked and illegally accessed by a malicious subject. In the traditional network security mechanism, the <b>protected</b> <b>subject</b> refers to the service provider, and the malicious subject generally comes from the service requester. This security mechanism has called hard security in the literature [15]. The trust mechanism provides the security protection measures which are obviously different from those provided by traditional security mechanisms. The file sharing system (FR) selects the most trusted one among multiple candidates FPs when downloading a file. FP is used as a download source. It can be seen that the trust mechanism is mainly to protect the security of FR, to avoid FR download to malicious files. The <b>protected</b> <b>subject</b> in the trust mechanism is the service requester; potential malicious users are the service providers. The security protection measures provided by the mechanism have referred to as soft security [16].|$|E
40|$|Intellectual {{property}} rights (IPRs) {{have recently been}} subject to numerous, sometimes highly controversial debates in Europe. An arcane technical matter prior to the 1990 s, the design of IPR systems now attracts attention, not only among the users of the respective IPR systems, but also more broadly among the citizens of Europe. It is generally accepted that IPRs {{can play an important}} role for fostering innovation, but the design choices for IPR systems remain contested. Some of the renewed interest is created by the perception that over the last decades, the IPR systems have strengthened the position of rights owners over those of the users of <b>protected</b> <b>subject</b> matter. This chapter argues that this perception is at least partly correct. In the field of copyright, technical and legal developments have contributed to a shift of control towards commerical content providers. In the area of patent rights, changes in the behavior of applicants have led to strong increases in the demand for patent protection, coupled with some signs of quality deterioration in the patent system. While Europe may have fared relatively well when compared to the US, problems are emerging in the EU as well. From an economic perspective, {{there is a need for}} harmonizing European adminstrative and legal practices in the area of IPRs while increasing the quality standards used in these system. Moreover, a new balance between the owners of rights and users of the <b>protected</b> <b>subject</b> matter needs to be found in many fields...|$|E

40|$|Although {{intellectual}} property rights do not automatically confer a dominant market position, they may put the right holder {{in the position to}} behave more or less independently of his or her competitors, customers, and ultimately consumers. The extent of the relative immunity from competition depends on a number of factors, from the specific characteristics of the <b>protected</b> <b>subject</b> matter through to the structure of the relevant market. In extreme cases, an {{intellectual property}} right will constitute an “essential facility” and therefore enable the right holder to control access to, and thus competition in, the market. In such cases, a refusal to license may lead to an abuse of market dominance within the meaning of Article 102 TFEU. Depending on the circumstances of the case, the abuse may consist in a discrimination of trading partners, an unjustified foreclosure of competitors, a negligence of market needs, or an expansion of market power to another related market. However, a compulsory licence is not always the appropriate remedy to stop the established abuse, its anti-competitive effects, and its recurrence. In principle, the European Commission asks the dominant company to cease and desist from the abusive conduct, but it does not grant compulsory licences...|$|E

40|$|Intellectual {{property}} law protects {{the owner of}} each patented invention or copyrighted work of authorship with a largely uniform set of exclusive rights. Historically, this uniformity may have been justified {{in light of the}} relative homogeneity of market conditions applicable to <b>protected</b> <b>subject</b> matter, such as books or mechanical inventions. Technological progress since the founding has led to considerable growth in the range of inventions and expressive works to which patent and copyright law apply, respectively. In the modern context, it is clear that innovators’ needs for intellectual property protection vary substantially across industries and among types of innovation. Applying a socially costly, uniform solution to problems of differing magnitudes means that the law necessarily imposes uniformity costs by underprotecting those who invest in certain costly innovations and overprotecting those with low innovation costs or access to alternative appropriability mechanisms. This Article argues that reducing uniformity cost is the central problem for intellectual property policymaking. There are three approaches for reducing uniformity costs: (1) granting real options to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights (such as renewable terms); (2) using standards rather than rules to define rights, thereby making their application more context-sensitive; and (3) tailoring rights legislatively or judicially. This Article focuses on the ways in which current law deploys these approaches to reduce uniformity cost and argues that recent changes in the law have exacerbated the problem of uniformity cost...|$|E

40|$|Overview and key {{findings}} The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) {{has identified}} four classes of copyright industries: 	 	Core – industries that exist {{only because of}} copyright and are primarily involved in the creation, manufacture, production, broadcast and distribution of copyrighted works. 	 	 	Partial – {{a portion of the}} industries’ activities are related to copyright through manufacture, performance, exhibition, broadcast, communication or distribution and sales. 	 	 	Interdependent – involved in the manufacture, performance, broadcast and communication in order to support and facilitate the creation of copyrighted works and other <b>protected</b> <b>subject</b> matter. 	 	 	Non-dedicated support – duties are included in this group where part of the activities are related to broadcast, communication, distribution and sales in <b>protected</b> <b>subject</b> matter and they are not included in the core copyright industries.   	 This common typology facilitates consistent analysis of the economic contribution of the copyright industries over time and across countries. Even where companies or individuals are somewhat reliant on copyright exceptions (e. g. the education sector, musicians, television producers, software companies, etc) they are still likely to be generators of copyright-protected material. Despite pressures caused by digitisation (which have challenged the delivery of traditional business models in a number of copyright industries, particularly in a high dollar environment — e. g. music, movies, games, software, books, newspapers, television, etc) and resultant piracy, copyright remains a key piece of infrastructure that supports the industries which comprise a modern economy. In the most recent year for which data is available (2013 - 14), Australia’s copyright industries:   	 	Employed just over 1 million people (specifically, 1, 000, 167 people), which constituted 8. 7 per cent of the Australian workforce. This level of employment intensity is relatively high in comparison to the USA (8. 4 per cent) and Canada (5. 6 per cent). The real average wage for people employed in the copyright industries has also increased from $ 59, 500 in 2004 - 05 to $ 68, 960 in 2013 - 14 per employee. 	 	 	Generated economic value of $ 111. 4 billion, the equivalent of 7. 1 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP), which is greater than the manufacturing and health care sectors. For comparison, the copyright industries comprised 11. 4 per cent of GDP in the United States and 5. 4 per cent in Canada. Over the period 2001 - 02 to 2007 - 08 the real (i. e. inflation adjusted) compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for value add generated by copyright industries was 3. 7 per cent, with the core copyright industries growing 3. 2 per cent per year. Over the subsequent period 2008 - 09 to 2013 - 14 the real value add CAGR for all copyright industries was zero per cent, and 0. 3 per cent for the core copyright industries. 	 	 	Generated just over $ 4. 8 billion in exports, equal to 1. 8 per cent of total exports. The relative value of copyright exports has declined as a proportion of total exports in recent years. 	 As the Australian Law Reform Commission noted in 2013, ‘It is clear that the economic contribution of Australia’s PwC copyright industries is significant. ’ (ALRC 2013, p 77).  ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{seeks to}} set the {{practical}} discipline of public interest intellectual property (IP) management in public health into its broader policy context. The most immediate and direct impact of IP systems on public welfare results not from international standards nor from national legislation – though these norms are fundamentally important- but rather from the accumulated impact of numerous practical choices {{whether or not to}} seek IP protection; where and where not; and how any exclusive rights are deployed, by whom, and to what end. IP management is the essentially practical exercise of limited exclusive rights over <b>protected</b> <b>subject</b> matter, the judicious use of those rights to leverage outcomes that advance an institution's or a firm's objectives. Exclusive rights are used to construct and define knowledge-based relationships, to leverage access to technology and other necessary resources, and to enhance market-based incentives. IP management choices range across a broad spectrum, spanning public domain strategies, open or exclusive licensing, and strong exclusivity. The idea of ‘exclusive rights’, as a specific legal mechanism, can run counter to expectations of greater openness and accessibility, but actual outcomes will depend very much on how these mechanisms are used in practice. For public interest or public sector institutions concerned with health research and development, particularly the development of new medicines, IP management choices can be just as critical as they are for private firms, although a predominant institutional concentration on advancing direct public interest objectives may lead to significantly different approaches in weighing and exercising practical choices for IP management: even so, a private sector approach should no...|$|E

40|$|Courts and {{commentators}} often treat intellectual property {{as if the}} private value of the rights stemmed entirely from the control legal rules conferred over the <b>protected</b> <b>subject</b> matter. While the literature has devoted {{an enormous amount of}} time, paper, and ink to the discussion of whether legal rules grant the optimal amount of exclusivity, it has not considered whether it has been examining all the functions of patents. This Article provides a new general framework for analyzing the function and effect of intellectual property rules. Rather than focusing on patents as a mechanism for privatizing information, this Article instead frames patents as a means of credibly publicizing information. Patents can reduce informational asymmetries between patentees and observers. Under some circumstances, the informational function of patents may be more valuable to the rights holder than the substance of the rights. The Article presents a model of patents as a signaling mechanism and considers the multiple equilibria that could result from using patents to convey information. If an easily measurable firm attribute such as patent counts is positively correlated with other less readily measurable firm attributes such as knowledge capital, then patent counts {{can be used as a}} means of conveying information about these other attributes. Knowing this, firms may choose to obtain and use a portfolio of patent rights to signal information about themselves that would be more expensive to do through other means. Alternatively, firms can use the patent document itself to convey information that would not be as credible when revealed in other contexts. Patent signals can be ambiguous, however, reducing information costs along some margins but raising them along others. The Article concludes by exploring the efficiency implications of patents as informational mechanisms...|$|E

40|$|When economists {{speak of}} an {{underlying}} legal structure that imposes an 2 ̆ 2 absolute permission 2 ̆ 2 requirement on access to, and use of, knowledge goods protected by {{intellectual property rights}} (IPRs), they typically have in mind the domestic patent and copyright laws. Under these and related intellectual property regimes, one cannot normally make use of a protected invention or creative work of authorship for specified purposes and for limited periods of time without prior authorization of the rights holder, typically {{in the form of}} a license. When economists speak of liability rules, in contrast, they envision an underlying legal structure that permits third parties to undertake certain actions without prior permission, provided that they compensate injured parties for all or part of the costs they inflict. While typical examples are found in tort laws regulating the abatement of nuisances, liability rules also abound in the realm of intellectual property law, where, however, their function has largely been overlooked or mischaracterized by legal and economic scholars. In this context, liability rules conjure up a regime built on a 2 ̆ 2 take and pay 2 ̆ 2 principle. Under such a regime, second comers can access and use the <b>protected</b> <b>subject</b> matter for specified purposes without permission, but they must compensate the first comer for these uses in one manner or another.

Our thesis is that a properly designed liability rule to protect small-scale innovation in developing countries would overcome investors 2 ̆ 7 fears of market failure with fewer social costs than would accrue either under a regime of unbridled copying or under a regime of hybrid exclusive property rights, such as those embodied in laws that protect utility models, industrial designs, plant varieties, or miscellaneous other subject matters in developed countries.

40|$|P 2 P {{technologies}} enable {{dissemination of}} content in an efficient way, especially if {{compared to the}} traditional techiques of content transmission over the Internet (by means of server-client network protocols, such as FTP, HTTP, etc). However, such efficiency must face the limits imposed by the law. In particular, file-sharing of <b>protected</b> <b>subject</b> matter is prohibited in all those cases where a prior authorization by right holders is absent. Such authorization is almost always missing, due to the extremely high transactive costs connected with its negotiation. This situation represents a huge market failure and restricts the freedom to access knowledge as granted by art. 27 sec. 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, with consequences that have a heavy {{negative impact on the}} cultural and economic development of our society. There has been few efforts in seeking mechanisms intended to ease the meeting between supply and demand of digital content. On the contrary, much effort has, in recent years, been put into limiting such a phenomena by leverage of the dissuasive power of criminal laws, and to involve access providers (ISP) in surveillance activities. This approach is clearly in contrast with fundamental and constitutional rights, and does not represent a solution to the market failure above mentioned. International and EU Community legislation allows for exceptions to the exclusive rights of reproduction and of making available to the public on-demand, provided that right holders are remunerated. This paper seeks {{to address the issue of}} file-sharing of copyrighted works, by analysing a variety of legal mechanisms and their compliance with international and European law. Among the possible solutions that can be taken (general taxation, special purpose tax, mandatory or voluntary licenses), we suggest that a system of collective extended licenses, if properly tuned, may solve the problems connected with the current situation of P 2 P, benefit the affected players economically, and increase the general welfare of society through a more efficient, fair, and open dissemination of culture and knowledge...|$|E
