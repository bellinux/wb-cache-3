40|$|The {{performance}} of electrical contacts, which are inevitable in the {{electricity distribution system}} will affects the power quality, reliability and hence the level of customer satisfaction. Making a successful contact depends {{on the design of}} a contact and proper workmanship. Thus, the knowhow on the behavior of a contact {{plays a major role in}} every aspect of making a successful electrical contact. The research undertaken was to study the behavior of electrical contacts having basic architectures and to develop a model to represent the resistance of contacts during loading. Basic architectures of current contacts were identified and resistance between two contacts members were measured against the load applied to it. A special testing apparatus was designed and fabricated for the study. This consists of a Compression Test Cell, Load Cell and a micro ohm meter. A Thermal imaging camera was used for observing Temperature Profiles. Rod tip architecture was initially examined under three basic tip angles 300, 600 and 900. Then <b>parallel</b> <b>rod</b> architectures were examined for the study and developed model for the resistance. An empirical model for the resistance for the <b>parallel</b> <b>rod</b> was developed and that was theoretically extended for the stranded wire.

40|$|While the {{tunneling}} conductance {{between two}} spherical-like conducting particles {{depends on the}} relative inter-particle distance, the wave function overlap between states of two rod-like particles, and so the tunneling conductance, depends also on the relative orientation of the rod axes. Modeling slender rod-like particles as cylindrical quantum wells of diameter D and length L≫ D, we calculate the matrix element of the tunneling between two rods for arbitrary relative orientations of the rod axes. We show that tunneling between two <b>parallel</b> <b>rods</b> is about L/√(Dξ) {{times larger than the}} tunneling matrix element for perpendicular rods, where ξ is the tunneling decay length. By considering the full dependence of the tunneling conductance on the angle between rod axes, we calculate within an effective medium theory the conductivity of dispersions of rods with different degrees of alignment. We find that for isotropically oriented rods, the effect of orientation in the tunneling processes is marginal for all rod concentrations. On the contrary, for systems of strongly aligned rods, the enhanced tunneling between nearly <b>parallel</b> <b>rods</b> increases significantly the system conductivity in a relatively large concentration range. Next, we consider systems in which short-range attraction between rods is added, as in dispersions of rods with depletion interaction. We find that the strongly anisotropic attraction promotes enhanced tunneling between neighboring <b>parallel</b> <b>rods,</b> increasing the effective medium conductivity by several orders of magnitude compared to the case in which the angular dependence of tunneling is ignored, even for relatively weak attractions.

40|$|A monumental {{task of the}} {{mammalian}} retina is {{to encode}} an enormous range (> 109 -fold) of light intensities experienced by the animal in natural environments. Retinal neurons carry out this task by dividing labor into many <b>parallel</b> <b>rod</b> and cone synaptic pathways. Here we study the operational plan of various rod- and cone-mediated pathways by analyzing electroretinograms (ERGs), primarily b-wave responses, in dark-adapted wildtype, connexin 36 knockout, depolarizing rod–bipolar cell (DBCR) knockout, and rod transducin alpha-subunit knockout mice [WT, Cx 36 (−/−), Bhlhb 4 (−/−), and Trα(−/−) ]. To provide additional insight into the cellular origins of various components of the ERG, we compared dark-adapted ERG responses with response dynamic ranges of individual retinal cells recorded with patch electrodes from dark-adapted mouse retinas published from other studies. Our {{results suggest that the}} connexin 36 -mediated rod–cone coupling is weak when light stimulation is weak and becomes stronger as light stimulation increases in strength and that rod signals may be transmitted to some DBCCs via direct chemical synapses. Moreover, our analysis indicates that DBCR responses contribute about 80 % of the overall DBC response to scotopic light and that rod and cone signals contribute almost equally to the overall DBC responses when stimuli are strong enough to saturate the rod bipolar cell response. Furthermore, our study demonstrates that analysis of ERG b-wave of dark-adapted, pathway-specific mutants can be used as an in vivo tool for dissecting rod and cone synaptic pathways and for studying the functions of pathway-specific gene products in the retina...|$|E

40|$|Due to {{the unique}} design of the <b>Parallel</b> <b>Rod</b> Test Object (PRoTO) and the {{associated}} semi-automated analysis program, {{it was necessary to}} test it extensively for precision and accuracy, and preliminarily for utility, before its distribution for wider use in MRI system quality control (QC). The test object and analysis program measured the desired quantities reproducibly and they accurately measured predicted changes from intentionally adjusted imaging system parameters, yielding sensitivity of the various test measures to deviation in the system operating parameters. From a single scan of the most recent revision of the test object, multiple quantitative quality control measures were obtained throughout the scanning volume on two MR imaging systems over periods of six and twelve months, respectively. From these and earlier trials, an initial indication was obtained of which performance measures are worth monitoring for QC. This experience suggests that signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and distortion (including display scale) should be monitored but not necessarily the resolution. The latter was only found to alter at the same time or later than other parameters such as SNR had changed. Slice thickness was found to vary on some units and this measure was also used in normalizing the SNR by voxel volume. SNR, distortion, and resolution measurements using field-echo sequences were less stable than those using spin-echo sequences. Use of this QC program to test a wide variety of image quality measures allowed timely assessment of the long-term variability of the units tested. Long-term variability may become among the most important measures for comparison of system performance and maintenance. Results are still inconclusive on the importance of tracking measures from sequences that are potentially most sensitive to small system misadjustments...|$|E

50|$|The {{gridiron}} pendulum was a temperature-compensated clock pendulum {{invented by}} British clockmaker John Harrison around 1726 and later modified by John Ellicott. It {{was used in}} precision clocks. In ordinary clock pendulums, the pendulum rod expands and contracts with changes in temperature. The period of the pendulum's swing depends on its length, so pendulum clocks rate varied with changes in ambient temperature, causing inaccurate timekeeping. The gridiron pendulum consists of alternating <b>parallel</b> <b>rods</b> of two metals with different thermal expansion coefficients, such as steel and brass.

In addition, the size of the system plays an important role: although tendentially more fragile, large systems are able to redistribute and absorb the effects of damage even with low complexity.

For stiff constraints, all the interaction potentials between {{the different types of}} rods are attractive and proportional to L/d. Two of the four types of rods are then equivalent, which yields six universal Casimir amplitudes. Repulsion can occur between different rods for soft constraints. Numerical results obtained for all ranges of d/L show that the attraction potential reaches kT for d/L≃ 0. 2. At separations smaller than d_c ≈ L(L/l_p) ^(1 / 3), where l_p is the rod persistence length, two rods with fixed ends will bend toward each other and finally come into contact because of the Casimir interaction.
