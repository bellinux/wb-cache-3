We also used event-related fMRI in the same subjects to localize neural activity related to action preparation and selection that was influenced by the reward.

40|$|A {{real-time}} visual proces:sing {{theory is}} used to analyze real and illusory contour formation, contour and:brightness interactions, neon color spreading, complementary color induction, and filling-in of discounted illuminants and s<;otomas. The theory also physically interprets and generalizes Land's retinex theory. These phenomena are traced to adaptive processes that overcome limitations of visual uptake to synthesize informative visual representations of the external world. Two parallel contour sensitive proces:ses interact to generate the theory's br:ightness, color, and form estimates. A boundary contour process is sensitive to orientation and amount of contrast but not to direction of contrast in scenic c~dges. It synthesizes boundaries sensitive to the global configuration of scenic elernents. A feature contour process is insensitive to orientation but sensitive to both amount of contrast and to direc 1 :ion of contrast in scenic edges. It triggers a diffusive filling-in of featural quality within perceptual domains whose boundaries are determined by completed boundary contours. The boundary contour process is hypothesized to include (:ortical interactions initiated by hypercolumns in Area 17 of the visual cortex. The feature contour process is hypothesized to include cortical interactions initiated by the cytochrome oxydase staining blobs in Area 17.

40|$|A {{neural network}} theory of : 3 -D vision, called FACADE Theory, is described. The theory proposes a {{solution}} of the classical figure-ground problem for biological vision. It does so by suggesting how boundary representations and surface representations are formed within a Boundary Contour System (BCS) and a Feature Contour System (FCS). The BCS and FCS interact reciprocally to form 3 -D boundary and surface representations that arc mutually consistent. Their interactions generate 3 -D percepts wherein occluding and occluded object completed, and grouped. The theory clarifies how preattentive processes of 3 -D perception and figure-ground separation interact reciprocally with attentive processes of spatial localization, object recognition, and visual search. A new theory of stereopsis is proposed that predicts how cells sensitive to multiple spatial frequencies, disparities, and orientations are combined by context-sensitive filtering, competition, and cooperation to form coherent BCS boundary segmentations. Several factors contribute to figure-ground pop-out, including: boundary contrast between spatially contiguous boundaries, whether due to scenic differences in luminance, color, spatial frequency, or disparity; partially ordered interactions from larger spatial scales and disparities to smaller scales and disparities; and surface filling-in restricted to regions surrounded by a connected boundary. Phenomena such as 3 -D pop-out from a 2 -D picture, DaVinci stereopsis, a 3 -D neon color spreading, completion of partially occluded objects, and figure-ground reversals are analysed. The BCS and FCS sub-systems model aspects of how the two parvocellular cortical processing streams that join the Lateral Geniculate Nucleus to prestriate cortical area V 4 interact to generate a multiplexed representation of Form-And-Color-And-Depth, or FACADE, within area V 4. Area V 4 is suggested to support figure-ground separation and to interact. with cortical mechanisms of spatial attention, attentive objcect learning, and visual search. Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART) mechanisms model aspects of how <b>prestriate</b> visual <b>cortex</b> interacts reciprocally with a visual object recognition system in inferotemporal cortex (IT) for purposes of attentive object learning and categorization. Object attention mechanisms of the What cortical processing stream through IT cortex are distinguished from spatial attention mechanisms of the Where cortical processing stream through parietal cortex. Parvocellular BCS and FCS signals interact with the model What stream. Parvocellular FCS and magnocellular Motion BCS signals interact with the model Where stream. Reciprocal interactions between these visual, What, and Where mechanisms arc used to discuss data about visual search and saccadic eye movements, including fast search of conjunctive targets, search of 3 -D surfaces, selective search of like-colored targets, attentive tracking of multi-element groupings, and recursive search of simultaneously presented targets.

Some optical imaging studies have found small clusters of red-green colour selective cells in V1 and V2, but not any blue-yellow colour selective cells. Other studies have shown that V2 is activated by colour stimuli, but not colour after images.8 V4 also has feedback on V2, suggesting that there is a defined network of communication between the multiple areas of the visual cortex.

40|$|Regional {{cerebral}} {{blood flow}} was measured with positron-emission tomography during two encoding and two retrieval tasks that were designed to compare memory for object features with memory for object locations. Bilateral increases in regional {{cerebral blood flow}} were observed in both anterior and posterior regions of inferior temporal cortex and in ventral regions of <b>prestriate</b> <b>cortex,</b> when the condition that required retrieval of object locations was subtracted from the condition that required retrieval of object features. During encoding, these changes were less pronounced and were restricted to the left inferior temporal cortex and right ventral <b>prestriate</b> <b>cortex.</b> In contrast, both encoding and retrieval of object location were associated with bilateral changes in dorsal prestriate and posterior parietal cortex. Finally, the two encoding conditions activated left frontal lobe regions preferentially, whereas the two retrieval conditions activated right frontal lobe regions. These findings confirm that, in human subjects, memory for object features is mediated by a distributed system that includes ventral <b>prestriate</b> <b>cortex</b> and both anterior and posterior regions of the inferior temporal gyrus.

40|$|Visual evoked {{potentials}} {{have been}} traditionally triggered with flash or reversing checkerboard stimuli and recorded with electroencephalographic techniques, largely but not exclusively in clinical or clinically related settings. They have been crucial {{in determining the}} healthy functioning or otherwise of the visual pathways {{up to and including}} the cerebral cortex. They have typically given early response latencies of 100 ms, the source of which has been attributed to V 1, with the <b>prestriate</b> <b>cortex</b> being secondarily activated somewhat later. On the other hand, magnetoencephalographic studies using stimuli better tailored to the physiology of individual, specialized, visual areas have given early latencies of < 50 ms with the sources localized in both striate (V 1) and <b>prestriate</b> <b>cortex.</b> In this study, we used the reversing checkerboard pattern as a stimulus and recorded cortical visual evoked magnetic fields with magnetoencephalography, to establish whether very early responses can be traced to (estimated) in both striate and <b>prestriate</b> <b>cortex,</b> since such a demonstration would enhance considerably the power of this classical approach in clinical investigations. Our results show that cortical responses evoked by checkerboard patterns can be detected before 50 ms post-stimulus onset and that their sources can be estimated in both striate and <b>prestriate</b> <b>cortex,</b> suggesting a strong parallel input from the sub-cortex to both striate and prestriate divisions of the visual cortex...|$|E
40|$|Neuropsychological {{evidence}} indicates that the global aspect of complex visual scenes is preferentially processed by the right hemisphere, and local aspects are preferentially processed by the left hemisphere. Using letter-based hierarchical stimuli (Navon figures), we recently demonstrated, in a directed-attention task, lateralized neural activity (assessed by positron emission tomography) in the left <b>prestriate</b> <b>cortex</b> during local processing, and in the right <b>prestriate</b> <b>cortex</b> during global processing. Furthermore, temporal-parietal cortex was critically activated bilaterally in a divided-attention task that involved varying the number of target switches between local and global levels of letter-based hierarchical stimuli. Little is known about whether such stimulus categories influence such hemispheric lateralization. We now present data on brain activity, derived from positron emission tomography, in normal subjects scanned during either local or global processing of object-based hierarchical stimuli. We again observe attentional modulation of neural activity in <b>prestriate</b> <b>cortex.</b> There is now greater right-sided activation for local processing and greater left-sided activation for global processing, which {{is the opposite of}} that seen with letter-based stimuli.

40|$|An {{important}} task of vision is the segregation of {{figure and ground}} in situations of spatial occlusion. Psychophysical {{evidence suggests that the}} depth order at contours is defined early in visual processing. We have analysed this process in the visual cortex of the alert monkey. The animals were trained on a visual fixation task which reinforced foveal viewing. During periods of active visual fixation, we recorded the responses of single neurons in striate and <b>prestriate</b> <b>cortex</b> (areas V 1, V 2, and V 3 /V 3 A). The stimuli mimicked situations of spatial occlusion, usually a uniform light (or dark) rectangle overlaying a grating texture of opposite contrast. The direction of figure and ground at the borders of these rectangles was defined by the direction of the terminating grating lines (occlusion cues). Neuronal responses were analysed with respect to figure-ground direction and contrast polarity at such contours. Striate neurons often failed to respond to such stimuli, or were selective for contrast polarity; others were non-selective. Some neurons preferred a certain combination of figure-ground direction and contrast polarity. These neurons were rare both in striate and <b>prestriate</b> <b>cortex.</b> The majority of neurons signalled figure-ground direction independent of contrast polarity. These neurons were only found in <b>prestriate</b> <b>cortex.</b> We explain these responses in terms of a model which also explains neuronal signals of illusory contours.

40|$|A left {{occipital}} stroke {{may result}} in alexia for two reasons, which may coexist depending {{on the distribution of}} the lesion. A lesion of the left lateroventral <b>prestriate</b> <b>cortex</b> or its afferents impairs word recognition ("pure" alexia). If the left primary visual cortex or its afferents are destroyed, resulting in a complete right homonymous hemianopia, rightward saccades during text reading are disrupted ("hemianopic" alexia). By using functional imaging, we showed two separate but interdependent systems involved in reading. The first, subserving word recognition, involved the representation of foveal vision in the left and right primary visual cortex and the ventral <b>prestriate</b> <b>cortex.</b> The second system, responsible for the planning and execution of reading saccades, consisted of the representation of right parafoveal vision in the left visual cortex, the bilateral posterior parietal cortex (left > right), and the frontal eye fields (right > left). Disruption of this distributed neural system was demonstrated in patients with severe right homonymous hemianopia, commensurate with their inability to perform normal reading eye movements. Text reading, before processes involved in comprehension, requires the integration of perceptual and motor processes. We have demonstrated these distributed neural systems in normal readers and have shown how a right homonymous hemianopia disrupts the motor preparation of reading saccades during text reading...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to analyze the {{projections}} from visually related areas of the cerebral cortex of rhesus monkey to subcortical nuclei involved in eye-movement control; i. e., the pretectal nuclear complex, the terminal nuclei of the accessory optic system (AOS), and the superior colliculus (SC). The anterograde tracer H- 3 -leucine was pressure injected bilaterally into the cortex of six monkeys (for a total of 12 cases) involving the primary visual cortex (area 17); the medial <b>prestriate</b> <b>cortex</b> (medial 18 / 19); dorsomedial area 19; the caudal portion of the cortex of the superior temporal sulcus, upper bank (cytoarchitectural area OAa) and lower bank (area PGa); the lower bank of the caudal lateral intraparietal sulcus (area POa); and the inferior parietal lobule (area 7). The results revealed that the pretectal nucleus of the optic tract received inputs from medial <b>prestriate</b> <b>cortex,</b> dorsomedial part of area 19, OAa, and PGa. The posterior pretectal nucleus received sparse projections from area 7 and the cortex lining the intraparietal sulcus (dorsomedial part of area 19 and POa). The pretectal olivary nucleus was targeted by neurons in cortex of dorsomedial area 19, and the anterior pretectal nucleus was targeted by neurons in both dorsomedial 19 and area 7. The nuclei of the AOS (dorsal terminal; lateral terminal; and interstitial nuclei of the superior fasciculus, posterior and medial fibers) received projections exclusively from areas OAa and PGa. Furthermore, in one case with PGa injection, the medial terminal nucleus, dorsal portion, was also labeled. The visual cortical areas studied projected differentially upon the SC laminae. The primary visual area 17 projected only to the superficial laminae, i. e., stratum zonale (SZ), stratum griseum superficiale (SGS), and stratum opticum (SO). On the other hand, the medial portion of the <b>prestriate</b> <b>cortex</b> and caudal OAa and PGa targeted the superficial and intermediate laminae, i. e., SZ, SGS, SO, and stratum griseum intermediale (SGI), whereas caudal area POa projected primarily to the intermediate layer SGI.

The task demands in the two experiments were identical, but the stimuli in Experiment II were constructed to equalize stimulus complexity across all three tasks. The old subjects performed more slowly than the young subjects in both experiments, and showed significantly slower reaction times during location matching compared to face matching in Experiment II.

The same animals were not impaired in learning visual object discriminations in which spatial position was irrelevant, nor in learning spatial discriminations in which object identity was irrelevant. The results were compared with previously reported results from fornix transection in the same tasks; the deficit following dorsal prestriate ablation in visuospatial configural discrimination learning was similar in severity to that which followed fornix transection.

40|$|The paper {{distinguishes the}} use of visual cues to guide {{reaching}} and grasping, {{and the ability to}} learn to associate arbitrary sensory cues with movements. Using positron emission tomography (PET), we have shown that the arbitrary association of visual cues and movements involves the ventral visual system (prestriate, inferotemporal and ventral prefrontal cortex), the basal ganglia and the dorsal premotor cortex. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we have shown that the evoked haemodynamic responses in the ventral visual system are time-locked to the presentation of the visual cues, that the response in the motor cortex is locked to the time of response, and that the response in the dorsal premotor cortex shows cuerelated, movement-related and set-related components. Using PET we have shown that there are learning-related changes in activation in both the ventral <b>prestriate</b> <b>cortex</b> and the basal ganglia (globus pallidus) when subjects learn a visuomotor associative task.

40|$|THE perceptual {{world is}} {{organized}} hierarchically: the forest consists of trees, {{which in turn}} have leaves. Visual attention can emphasize the overall picture (global form) or the focal details of a scene (local components) 1. Neuropsychological {{studies have indicated that}} the left hemisphere is biased towards local and the right towards global processing. The underlying attentional and perceptual mechanisms are maximally impaired by unilateral lesions to the temporal and parietal cortex 2, 3. We measured brain activity of normal subjects during two experiments using 'hierarchically' organized figures. In a directed attention task, early visual processing (prestriate) areas were activated: attention to the global aspect of the figures activated the right lingual gyrus whereas locally directed attention activated the left inferior occipital cortex. In a subsequent divided attention task, the number of target switches from local to global (and vice versa) covaried with temporal–parietal activation. The findings provide direct evidence for hemispheric specialization in global and local perception; furthermore, they indicate that temporal–parietal areas exert attentional control over the neural transformations occurring in <b>prestriate</b> <b>cortex...</b>|$|E

Both Statistical Parametric Mapping and regions of interest-based analyses revealed an increase of rCBF in the area surrounding the principal sulcus (PS), the superior convexity, the anterior bank of the arcuate sulcus (AS), the lateral orbitofrontal cortex (lOFC), the frontal pole (FP), the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), the lateral bank of the intraparietal sulcus (lIPS) and the <b>prestriate</b> <b>cortex.</b> In the prefrontal cortex (PS, superior convexity, AS, lOFC and FP), rCBF values correlated positively with ODR task performance scores. From the hippocampus, rCBF values correlated negatively with ODR task performance. From the AS, superior convexity, lOFC, FP, ACC and lIPS, rCBF values of the PS correlated positively with rCBF values and negatively with hippocampus rCBF values.

In {{the top half of the}} display was a sinusoidal-luminance grating of the same spatial frequency and 95 % contrast that drifted in the opposite direction. Observers, while fixating a point in the display center, adjusted the speed of this upper comparison grating so that it appeared to match the velocity of the chromatic grating below. At low spatial frequencies, equiluminous gratings were appreciably slowed and sometimes stopped even though the individual bars of the grating could be easily resolved. The amount of slowing was proportionally greatest for gratings with slow drift rates. Blue-yellow sine-wave gratings showed similar effects. When luminance contrast was held con-stant, increasing chrominance modulation caused further decreases in apparent velocity, ruling out the possibility that the slowing was simply due to decreased luminance contrast. Perceived velocity appears to be a weighted av-erage of luminance and chrominance velocity information.

40|$|In a {{previous}} study we showed that fast moving stimuli activate V 5, an area specialized for motion, at very short latencies through a pathway that reaches it without passing through VI. Using the same technique of visual evoked responses, we have tested our conclusions by studying patient GY, whose VI is damaged but whose V 5 is intact. In spite of the contralateral hemi-blindness due to his VI lesion, GY has a residual visual capacity {{that allows him to}} perceive, consciously, fast but not slow moving stimuli presented in his affected hemifield. By stimulating GY's 'blind ' hemifield and comparing the responses with those obtained from normal subjects, we were able to study the relative contribution of VI and V 5 to the visual evoked response to motion in normal subjects. We found that GY's early response to fast motion is preserved and correlates with activity elicited in control subjects over area V 5, while slow motion, pattern offset, and pattern reversal stimuli failed to elicit responses in GY. The results confirm our previous conclusions: namely, that {{the early part of the}} motion evoked response is generated in area V 5 and that signals reach this area through a dynamically parallel pathway that bypasses area VI. They go on to demonstrate that neurophysiological activity in the <b>prestriate</b> <b>cortex</b> correlates with the conscious visual perception of motion...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} the functional anatomy involved in sustaining or switching visual attention between different perceptual levels, using functional imaging measures of neural activity. Two experiments {{were carried out}} using hierarchically organized letters (i. e. large letters made out of small letters). In a divided-attention task, subjects were required to switch attention between local and global levels. The number of successive stimuli for which subjects had to sustain attention to either the global or local level co-varied significantly with temporal-parietal activations bilaterally. Other activations were also observed in the right orbitofrontal cortex, the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and the right middle temporal gyrus. The number of switches between levels co-varied significantly with activations in the left supplementary motor area and the left medial parietal cortex. In the directed-attention task, subjects were required to attend to either the global or local level of the stimuli throughout all trials; attention to the global aspect resulted in significant activation of the right lingual gyrus while attention to the local aspect significantly activated the left inferior occipital cortex. We suggest that left hemisphere activations with increasing numbers of switches between perceptual levels reflect increased demands on an executive attentional system, while sustained attention to either level activates a predominantly right hemispheric network involving temporal-parietal and dorsolateral prefrontal regions. Overall, the results provide evidence for relative hemispheric specialization for global and local processing in accordance with previous neuropsychological studies. In addition, the findings demonstrate that early visual processing mechanisms in the <b>prestriate</b> <b>cortex</b> are influenced by an attentional system in temporal-parietal areas...|$|E
40|$|Magnetoencephalography (MEG) {{can be used}} to {{reconstruct}} neuronal activity with high spatial and temporal resolution. However, this reconstruction problem is ill-posed, and requires the use of prior constraints in order to produce a unique solution. At present there are a multitude of inversion algorithms, each employing different assumptions, but one major problem when comparing the accuracy of these different approaches is that often the true underlying electrical state of the brain is unknown. In this study, we explore one paradigm, retinotopic mapping in the primary visual cortex (V 1), for which the ground truth is known to a reasonable degree of accuracy, enabling the comparison of MEG source reconstructions with the true electrical state of the brain. Specifically, we attempted to localize, using a beamforming method, the induced responses in the visual cortex generated by a high contrast, retinotopically varying stimulus. Although well described in primate studies, it has been an open question whether the induced gamma power in humans due to high contrast gratings derives from V 1 rather than the <b>prestriate</b> <b>cortex</b> (V 2). We show that the beamformer source estimate in the gamma and theta bands does vary {{in a manner consistent with}} the known retinotopy of V 1. However, these peak locations, although retinotopically organized, did not accurately localize to the cortical surface. We considered possible causes for this discrepancy and suggest that improved MEG/magnetic resonance imaging co-registration and the use of more accurate source models that take into account the spatial extent and shape of the active cortex may, in future, improve the accuracy of the source reconstructions...|$|E
40|$|Several {{human and}} monkey studies have {{demonstrated}} a close relationship between motion perception and activation of area V 5, leading to the general view that activity in this area correlates with the subjective experience of motion. In the present study, we investigate whether the responses of this area are still governed by the motion percept when the latter is {{in conflict with the}} reality of the physical visual stimulation. We simultaneously presented two different, specially designed random-dot kinematograms, one to each eye. These stimuli either both had a single direction of motion and worked in synergy, or had opposite motion directions and thus cancelled each other out perceptually. In this way, we were able to pit the visual stimulus (one vs. two stimulating directions) against the reported perception (directional motion vs. motion noise) of human volunteers during fMRI experiments. We found that a strong motion stimulus that is weakly perceived is more effective in activating V 5 (as well as V 3) than a weaker motion stimulus, which is nevertheless robustly perceived. Thus, contrary to the prevailing view of perception being the correlate of activity in higher visual areas, we show here that activity is instead dominated by the properties of the physical stimulus, raising the question of whether there is a subpopulation of cells in V 5 whose activity is critical for generating the motion percept. In addition, our results provide the first robust evidence for the presence of directionally selective neuronal populations in human <b>prestriate</b> <b>cortex...</b>|$|E
40|$|Neurones {{tuned for}} second-order stimuli—those which have edges defined by {{properties}} other than luminance and colour—have been frequently observed in <b>prestriate</b> <b>cortex</b> and in area V 2 there are neurones which explicitly and unambiguously signal {{the orientation of}} purely subjective contours, i. e. contours with no Fourier components at {{the orientation of the}} perceived edge [von der Heydt, R. 2 ̆ 6 Peterhans, E. (1989) Journal of Neuroscience, 9, 1731 – 1748]. No neurones in area V 1 showed similar tuning characteristics. In addition, it has been demonstrated that like real contours, purely subjective test contours are subject to tilt aftereffects following prolonged viewing of an adapting stimulus, whether that stimulus is real or subjective [Paradiso, M. A., Shimojo, S. 2 ̆ 6 Nakayama, K. (1989) Vision Research, 29, 1205 – 1213]. This result supports the assertion that the cortical processes responsible for real contour perception are also those giving rise to subjective contour perception. The data reported here further examined this hypothesis. Four experiments show that purely subjective contours exhibit both direct and indirect tilt aftereffects and tilt illusions like those observed with real contours. Further, they provide evidence that direct and indirect subjective contour effects, like direct and indirect real contour effects, arise via the operation of two mechanisms: a low level process, possibly lateral inhibition between orientation channels, and a second “higher-order” process. The data suggest that processing of orientation information beyond the striate cortex is similar to that which occurs in area V 1 and the data are consistent with models of contour processing which assume that all perceived contours, both real and subjective, arise from a common mechanism...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis {{study was}} {{undertaken}} to learn whether {{the principle of}} functional specialization that is evident {{at the level of}} the prestriate visual cortex extends to areas that are involved in grouping visual stimuli according to attribute, and specifically according to colour and motion. Subjects viewed, in an fMRI scanner, visual stimuli composed of moving dots, which could be either coloured or achromatic; in some stimuli the moving coloured dots were randomly distributed or moved in random directions; in others, some of the moving dots were grouped together according to colour or to direction of motion, with the number of groupings varying from 1 to 3. Increased activation was observed in area V 4 in response to colour grouping and in V 5 in response to motion grouping while both groupings led to activity in separate though contiguous compartments within the intraparietal cortex. The activity in all the above areas was parametrically related to the number of groupings, as was the prominent activity in Crus I of the cerebellum where the activity resulting from the two types of grouping overlapped. This suggests (a) that, the specialized visual areas of the <b>prestriate</b> <b>cortex</b> have functions beyond the processing of visual signals according to attribute, namely that of grouping signals according to colour (V 4) or motion (V 5); (b) that the functional separation evident in visual cortical areas devoted to motion and colour, respectively, is maintained at the level of parietal cortex, at least as far as grouping according to attribute is concerned; and (c) that, by contrast, this grouping-related functional segregation is not maintained {{at the level of the}} cerebellum...|$|E
40|$|Visual {{attention}} can {{be primarily}} allocated to either where an object is in space (with little {{emphasis on the}} structure of the object itself) or to the structure of the object (with little emphasis on where in space the object is located). Using PET measures of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) to index neural activity, we investigated the shared and specific functional anatomy underlying both of these types of visual attention in a controlled non-cueing non-blocked paradigm that involved identical stimuli across the conditions of interest. The interaction of eye movements with these attentional systems was studied by introducing fixation or free vision as an additional factor. Relative to the control condition, object-based and space-based attention showed significant activations of the left and right medial superior parietal cortex and the left lateral inferior parietal cortex, the left prefrontal cortex and the cerebellar vermis. Significant differential activations were observed during object-based attention in the left striate and <b>prestriate</b> <b>cortex.</b> Space-based attention activated the right prefrontal cortex and the right inferior temporal-occipital cortex. Differential neural activity due to free vision or fixation was observed in occipital areas only. Significant interactions of free vision/fixation on activations due to object-based and space-based attention were observed in the right medial superior parietal cortex and left lateral inferior parietal cortex, respectively. The study provides direct evidence for the importance of the parietal cortex in the control of object-based and space-based visual attention. The results show that object-based and space-based attention share common neural mechanisms in the parietal lobes, in addition to task specific mechanisms in early visual processing areas of temporal and occipital cortices...|$|E
40|$|We {{have used}} {{positron}} emission tomography to study the functional anatomy of motor sequence learning. Subjects learned sequences of keypresses {{by trial and error}} using auditory feedback. They were scanned with eyes closed under three conditions: at rest, while performing a sequence that was practiced before scanning until overlearned, and while learning new sequences at the same rate of performance. Compared with rest, both sequence tasks activated the contralateral sensorimotor cortex to the same extent. Comparing new learning with performance of the prelearned sequence, differences in activation were identified in other areas. (1) Prefrontal cortex was only activated during new sequence learning. (2) Lateral premotor cortex was significantly more activated during new learning, whereas the supplementary motor area was more activated during performance of the prelearned sequence. (3) Activation of parietal association cortex was present during both motor tasks, but was significantly greater during new learning. (4) The putamen was equally activated by both conditions. (5) The cerebellum was activated by both conditions, but the activation was more extensive and greater in degree during new learning. There was an extensive decrease in the activity of <b>prestriate</b> <b>cortex,</b> inferotemporal cortex, and the hippocampus in both active conditions, when compared with rest. These decreases were significantly greater during new learning. We draw three main conclusions. (1) The cerebellum is involved in the process by which motor tasks become automatic, whereas the putamen is equally activated by sequence learning and retrieval, and may play a similar role in both. (2) When subjects learn new sequences of motor actions, prefrontal cortex is activated. This may reflect the need to generate new responses. (3) Reduced activity of areas concerned with visual processing, particularly during new learning, suggests that selective attention may involve depressing the activity of cells in modalities that are not engaged by the task...|$|E
40|$|Visual search {{data are}} given a unified {{quantitative}} explanation by a model of how spatial maps in the parietal cortex and object recognition categories in the inferotemporal cortex deploy attentional resources as they reciprocally interact with visual representations in the <b>prestriate</b> <b>cortex.</b> The model visual representations arc organized into multiple boundary and surface representations. Visual search in the model is initiated by organizing multiple items that lie within a given boundary or surface representation into a candidate search grouping. These items arc compared with object recognition categories to test for matches or mismatches. Mismatches can trigger deeper searches and recursive selection of new groupings until a target object io identified. This search model is algorithmically specified to quantitatively simulate search data using a single set of parameters, {{as well as to}} qualitatively explain a still larger data base, including data of Aks and Enns (1992), Bravo and Blake (1990), Chellazzi, Miller, Duncan, and Desimone (1993), Egeth, Viri, and Garbart (1984), Cohen and Ivry (1991), Enno and Rensink (1990), He and Nakayarna (1992), Humphreys, Quinlan, and Riddoch (1989), Mordkoff, Yantis, and Egeth (1990), Nakayama and Silverman (1986), Treisman and Gelade (1980), Treisman and Sato (1990), Wolfe, Cave, and Franzel (1989), and Wolfe and Friedman-Hill (1992). The model hereby provides an alternative to recent variations on the Feature Integration and Guided Search models, and grounds the analysis of visual search in neural models of preattentive vision, attentive object learning and categorization, and attentive spatial localization and orientation.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{the case of}} a 58 -years-old right-handed women suffering from an occipital-parietal lesion. The administration of a cognitively based assessment tool for limb praxis (Batterie d'Evaluation des Praxies, B. E. P. Peigneux and Van der Linden, 1998) demonstrated bilateral visuo-imitative apraxia. Gesture production was mainly characterised by spatial, errors, and imitation of meaningful gestures was worse than their pantomime on verbal command. Moreover, the imitation of meaningless gestures and their reproduction on a manikin were worse than imitation of their matched meaningful gestures. In a cognitive perspective, adapted from the Rothi et al. (1997) and Goldenberg (1995) contributions to our understanding of limb praxis, this configuration of performance suggests deficits occurring at multiple levels. On one hand, it suggests either access difficulties or alteration of the output praxicon, i. e. the lexicon for visuo-kinesthetic engrams of meaningful gestures. On the other hand, the simultaneous deficit for meaningless gesture reproduction on the subject's own body and on a manikin favors an alteration of the structural descriptions of the human body (i. e. human body knowledge), underlying the mental transposition processes occurring between the visual analysis of a meaningless gestural configuration and its effective reproduction on oneself or on a manikin, thus contradicting the classic view of a direct pathway linking visual analysis and motor planning in meaningless gesture imitation. Finally, due to the output praxicon deficit, imitation of meaningful gestures is partly processed {{in the same way as}} meaningless gestures (also impaired in this case), leading to an interference effect between both degraded memory-based and visually-transposed traces, which account for imitation of meaningful gestures being worse than their pantomime on verbal command. We also assess regional cerebral metabolism using positron emission tomography (PET). Comparison with 41 healthy subjects (SPM 96) demonstrated a statistically significant hypometabolism in the left intraparietal sulcus and superior parietal lobule, and in the right dorsal <b>prestriate</b> <b>cortex.</b> These results, together with a review of the other studies of visuo-imitative apraxia, suggest that the left intraparietal sulcus may be associated with access or integration of information from the output praxicon. The left superior parietal and the right dorsal prestriate deficits functionally impaired a bilateral dorsal network implied in the mental transformations of the body, thus suggesting that these mental transformations are underlined by knowledge of the human body, which may subsequently explain the deficit for the reproduction of meaningless and meaningful configurations.
