5000|$|The {{process of}} using an English wheel {{is known as}} wheeling. Panels {{produced}} this way are expensive, due to the highly skilled and labour-intensive production method, but it has the key advantage that it can flexibly produce different panels using the same machine. It is a forming machine that works by surface stretching and is related in action to <b>panel</b> <b>beating</b> processes. It is used wherever low volumes of compound curved panels are required; typically in coachbuilding, car restoration, spaceframe chassis racing cars that meet regulations that require sheetmetal panels resembling mass production vehicles (NASCAR), car prototypes and aircraft skin components. English wheel production is at its highest in low-volume sports car production, particularly when more easily formed aluminium alloy is used.|$|E
50|$|Before the 1940s, body solder {{was often}} used to repair large {{imperfections}} prior to painting. Solder repairs were conducted using a flame and wooden paddles covered in tallow or motor oil, which prevented the half-molten lead from sticking. After the war, automotive panels became thinner and larger, with a greater susceptibility to warping. The earliest 'plastic solder' {{can be traced to}} around 1940, a do-it-yourself solution to <b>panel</b> <b>beating.</b> This gave the consumer the ability to attempt reasonably priced and long lasting repairs. These early fillers were epoxy-based and one part, drying by out gassing. The most notable early filler was called Black Magic (body filler), and was popular before Bondo's introduction. Bondo, a two-part (resin with hardener added) mix of talc and plastic, was introduced in 1955. It was developed by World War II veteran and automotive repair shop owner Robert Merton Spink of Miami, Florida.|$|E
50|$|If rust {{is present}} on a body panel, the panel was damaged by a collision, or other damage is present, {{there are several}} options for repair: fix the damaged panel (minor damage), {{replacement}} (excessively damaged panels), or cutting out and replacing {{a portion of the}} panel (moderate damage - for many makes of vintage car, small partial patch panels are available and designed to be welded into place after the damaged portions are cut out). Although this may seem simple in principle, in practice it is highly skilled work. One of the highest skills in restoration is the use of the English Wheel or Wheeling Machine to fabricate complete compound curvature panels from scratch. Many panels, (especially if from different sources), may be a problem to fit together and need reshaping to fit together properly. Variation in panel size and shape and 'fettling' by skilled metalworkers on the factory production line to make panels fit well used to be common practice, especially with British and Italian sports cars. Even genuine New Old Stock factory panels may require <b>panel</b> <b>beating</b> skills to fit.|$|E

5000|$|The {{operator}} {{of the machine}} passes the sheet metal between the anvil wheel and the rolling wheel. This process stretches the material and causes it to become thinner. As the material stretches, it forms a convex surface over the anvil wheel. This surface is known as [...] "crown". A high crown surface is very curved, a low crown surface is slightly curved. The rigidity and strength in {{the surface of a}} workpiece is provided by the high crown areas. The radius of the surface, after working, depends on the degree that the metal {{in the middle of the}} work piece stretches relative to the edge of the piece. If the middle stretches too much, the operator can recover the shape by wheeling the edge of the piece. Wheeling the edge has the same effect in correcting mis-shape due to over-stretching in the middle, as does shrinking directly on the overstretched area by the use of heat shrinking or Eckold-type shrinking. This is because the edge holds the shape in place. Shrinking the edge prior to wheeling aids the formation of shape during wheeling, and reduces the amount of stretching and thinning needed to reach the final shape. Shrinking processes reduce the surface area by thickening the sheet metal. Shrinking by hand is harder to do and slower than stretching using <b>panel</b> <b>beating</b> tools or wheeling, because of this it should only be used when absolutely necessary. Aluminium sheet should be annealed before wheeling because rolling at the mill during its production work hardens it.|$|E

Manual forming of sheet metal parts through traditional <b>panel</b> <b>beating</b> is a highly skilled profession used in many industries, particularly for sample manufacturing or repair and maintenance. However, this skill is becoming gradually isolated mainly due to the high cost and lack of expertise. Nonetheless, a cost-effective and flexible approach to forming sheet metal parts could significantly assist various industries by providing a method for fast prototyping sheet metal parts. The development of a new fixtureless sheet metal forming approach is discussed in this article. The proposed approach, named Mechatroforming®, consists of integrated mechanisms to manipulate sheet metal parts by a robotic arm under a controlled hammering tool. The method includes mechatronics-based monitoring and control systems for (near) real-time prediction and control of incremental deformations of parts.

40|$|Bibliography: pages 145 - 152. This thesis {{examines}} manufacturing {{small and}} medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) from the Western Cape, drawn from three leading industries in the manufacturing sector: clothing, furniture, and <b>panel</b> <b>beating</b> and metal works. The aim of the study is to analyze factors that contribute to the success of black manufacturing enterprises. To this end, the study isolated a group of black SMEs regarded as successful in terms of comparative studies in other countries. A sample of 20 SMEs was selected and detailed interviews formed the basis of the analysis. The information gathered during this process was analysed using Porter's model of competitiveness. A central finding of the survey is that the profile of a successful enterprise would include an entrepreneur with post-school training, a motivation for independence and enhancement of self-esteem, a participative relationship between workers and management, and a good relationship with customers. Most of these entrepreneurs attained competitiveness independent of support institutions (private or public). Entrepreneurs interviewed mentioned that their performance could be enhanced by effective support in marketing and exporting, finance, training, information and, technology, and subcontracting. The conclusion is therefore that the support envisaged in terms of the national strategy for SMEs' advancement, would assist the individual enterprise's quest for competitiveness...|$|E
40|$|The {{volume of}} {{automotive}} plastic waste entering landfill {{created by the}} collision repair and steel recycling industries is {{in the vicinity of}} 200, 000 tons per annum. This research analyses this volume with a view to exploring strategies for its reduction. Statistics were gathered onsite from collision repair centres for the measurement of consumable plastic waste, insurance quote centres for ascertaining the percentages of damaged plastic components replaced, and a steel recycling centre for its volumes of generated automotive plastic waste. A national postal survey directed to head teachers of TAFE <b>panel</b> <b>beating</b> sections explored the present depth of knowledge and skill available on the subject of automotive plastic welding and repair training for the collision repair industry. The research indicated that an improvement in industry training would result in only a modest reduction of the total waste stream but the economic benefits could be considerable. A national training policy aimed at up-skilling the collision repair industry in plastic repair skills could create additional fulltime employment for 200 – 300 personnel and offer ongoing saving on insurance repair costs in the vicinity of 35 million dollars per annum. A literature search produced information for a subjective view on the subject of pyrolysis. Pyrolysis could be one potential methodology capable of converting plastic wastes from landfill to useful by-products such as activated carbons and petrochemicals. The findings on pyrolysis were positive and justify further research...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (PhD (Education)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 1989. There {{is growing}} {{need for more}} {{technically}} skilled manpower in the Republic of South Africa. This implies, inter alia, that more pupils should be trained at school level in technical subjects such as Technical Drawing, Electrician Work, Radiotrician Work, Cabinetmaking, Bricklaying and Masonry Work, Plumbing and Sheet-metal Work, Motor Mechanics, Welding and Metalwork, <b>Panel</b> <b>Beating,</b> and Fitting and Turning. These subjects are taught at technical high schools, ordinary high schools, special secondary schools and schools of industry. In order to provide the necessary training in technical subjects to {{a growing number of}} pupils, a large corps of qualified technical teachers is needed. A shortage of qualified technical teachers has, however, developed over the years. This study has endeavoured to determine the causes for this shortage {{and at the same time}} to establish at which institutions in the RSA these teachers are trained, and what the entrance requirements and curricula are. Apart from studying the development and the practical application of the training of technical teachers in countries abroad such as England and Wales, Scotland, the Netherlands, West Germany, Israel and Taiwan, the corresponding historical development in the RSA was investigated and compared to the above. Particular attention was given to the entrance requirements and curricula used for the training of technical teachers.

40|$|Police {{service is}} one of the most {{critical}} in a community and society at large. To limit crime and ensure that the law is upheld, resources need to be readily available to the South African Police Service (SAPS). A full fleet of well-maintained police vehicles is one such crucial resource. Depots performing regular maintenance services and repairs and <b>panel</b> <b>beating</b> are available to the SAPS. Despite the availability of these depots in various regions, vehicles booked in for services spend a prolonged time at the depot. The longer a vehicle is at the depot, the less efficient it is in crime prevention. One such SAPS depot can be found in the Silverton area. This report focuses on the Silverton depot where a challenge contributing to under-performance has been identified: a lack of established Key Performance Indicators. Key Performance Indicators (KPI) are one of the most important aspects of an organization as they reflect how the company is performing. Even inaccurate information regarding KPIs is dangerous due to the fact that critical decisions would be made based on this incorrect information. KPIs and the manner in which they are measured for the SAPS are thus all the more important as it {{is one of}} the basic and very key services that are provided in this country. This document explains how the student will explore ways in which one can improve the state of the depots in terms of their performance measures through the use of Industrial Engineering principles such as surveys, research and the Balanced Scorecard.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Die-based forming is a technology used by many industries to form metal panels. However, this method of forming lacks flexibility and cost effectiveness. In such cases, manual <b>panel</b> <b>beating</b> is typically undertaken for incremental forming of metal panels. Manual panel forming is a highly skilled operation with very little documentation and is disappearing due to non-observance {{and a lack of}} interest. Confederation of British Metal forming (CBM) and Institution of Sheet Metal Engineering (ISME) have realised the need for capturing and understanding manual skills used by panel beaters to preserve the knowledge. At the same time, industries seek for alternative panel forming solutions to produce high quality and cost-effective parts at low volume and reduce the repetitive, yet adaptive parts of the panel forming process to free up skilled workers to concentrate on the forming activities that are more difficult to automate. Incremental forming technologies, currently in practice, lack adaptability as they require substantial fixtures and dedicated tools. In this research a new proof-of-concept fixtureless automated sheet metal forming approach was developed on the basis of human skills captured from panel beaters. The proposed novel approach, named Mechatroforming®, consists of integrated mechanisms to form simple sheet metal parts by manipulating the workpiece using a robotic arm under a repetitive hammering tool. Predictive motion planning based on FEA was analysed and the manual forming skills were captured using a motion capture system. This facilitated the coordinated hammering and motion of the part to produce the intended shape accurately. A 3 D measurement system with a vertical resolution of 50 μm was also deployed to monitor the formation of the parts and make corrections to the forming path if needed. Therefore, the developed mechatronic system is highly adjustable by robotic motion and was closed loop via the 3 D measurement system. The developed automated system has been tested rigorously, initially for bowl shape parts to prove the principle. The developed system which is 98...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the issue of}} succession planning and business survival in family controlled businesses which is a topic of growing interest among scholars and policy makers given the increasingly volatile employment climate that prevails in many African settings today. With the use of social constructionist inquiry, it posits that succession planning is not a purely reflective process but occurs in a social context which it is contingent. It further demonstrates how as an intractable social interaction it generates new power and status configurations, multiple identities and meanings to the relationships between actors; primarily business founders or owner managers, successors and other participating family members. The thesis recognizes the multidimensional nature and definitional challenges associated with â€˜familyâ€™ and â€˜businessâ€™ as both social institutions and instruments of accessing both economic and non economic benefits. The connection between these two and the resultant expectations and experiences from ensuing social interactions render the succession process very unpredictable and conflict ridden. The micro politics of inclusion and exclusion is at play in this thesis. I conclude that the involvement of family members in management of the business and ensuing succession debates following {{the departure of the}} founder need reshaping. Family involvement is both a myth and ideology often utilized by both founders and successors to control other family members. A qualitative analysis is made of the specific cases of twenty family businesses all based in Harare and selected through purposive availability sampling of at least two firms from each of the ten sectors; passenger transport; retail and general dealing, vehicle repair and <b>panel</b> <b>beating,</b> hair dressing, driving schools, bottle store and bars, security firms, hardware, construction and manufacturing. The thesis concludes that the relationship between succession and business survival is a very strong one although not fixed and straight forward. However the thesis used only the continuity rate of the business and persistence of â€˜familinessâ€™as measures of â€˜survivalâ€™ and I propose for further research perhaps by use of longitudinal methods to interrogate more performance related dimensions like productivity and market share. The findings of this study are consistent with observations made by other scholars on businesses decline over generations but provide an enriched and novel explanation on the contribution of â€˜intergenerational congruityâ€™. It is however paradoxical that even though owner managers recognized the role played by succession planning in ensuring post succession durability and continuity they still did not put in place such plans. In all its forms and content, succession planning is an outcome of a messy and complicated process that is historically determined and socially constructed. Succession is also a source of both cooperation and conflict and this renders its relationship to business survival a bit paradoxical and substantively at crossroads...|$|E
