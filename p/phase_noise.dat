The Q specifies how long resonators continue to ring after drive to them is stopped, or equivalently when viewed as filters how narrow their pass-bands are. In particular, the Q times f, or Qf product, determines the near-carrier <b>phase</b> <b>noise.</b> Early MEMS resonators showed unacceptably low Qf products for reference. Significant theoretical work clarified the underlying physics while experimental work developed high Qf resonators.

40|$|The first <b>phase</b> of <b>noise</b> mapping {{and action}} {{planning}} in Ireland, {{in accordance with}} EU Directive 2002 / 49 /EC, is now complete. In total this included one agglomeration, one airport and approximately 600 km of major roads outside the agglomeration. These noise maps describe the level of noise exposure of approximately 1. 25 million people. The first <b>phase</b> of <b>noise</b> mapping was dealt with by five noise mapping bodies while 26 action planning authorities {{were involved in the}} development of the associated action plans. The second <b>phase</b> of <b>noise</b> mapping, due to be completed in 2012, sees a reduction in the defined thresholds describing the required agglomerations, roads and railways that have to be mapped. This will have a significant impact on the extent of mapping required. In Ireland this will result in an increased number of local authorities being required to develop strategic noise maps for their area along with the further development of associated action plans. It is appropriate at this point to review the work process and results from the first <b>phase</b> of <b>noise</b> mapping in Ireland in order to establish areas that could be improved, throughout the noise mapping project. In this paper a review of the implementation procedures focussing on (dominant) road traffic noise is presented.
