30|$|Most {{existing}} industrial {{tools that}} are placed inside pipelines for ultrasonic inspection adopt acoustic beams propagating at normal incidence, which {{is suitable for}} inspecting the flaws caused by changes in the pipe wall thickness. However, these methods are insensitive to cracks, particularly small cracks. In light of this shortcoming, numerous ultrasonic inspection tools {{have been developed for}} improving inspection performance. For example, GE has developed a tool, called UltraScan Duo, with an ultrasonic phased array transducer for inspecting defects in pipe walls, including cracks and defects caused by changes of thickness [7]. The UltraScan Duo can detect cracks that are at least 1  mm deep and 25  mm long [8, 9]. However, the UltraScan Duo requires a CPU to control its phased-beam forming accurately to obtain the best beam characteristics, which complicates matters. A pipeline inspection tool from the German company ROSEN uses an electromagnetic acoustic transducer (EMAT); this tool is named RoCD EMAT-C. It is specialized for pipeline crack and anticorrosive coating inspection; it can detect cracks that are at least 1  mm deep and 40  mm long [9 – 12]. However, its sensitivity level is lower than those of other ultrasonic inspection methods. Another ultrasonic pipeline crack inspection tool, called EVO Series UC 1.0, developed by the German NDT Global Company, can detect cracks that are at least 1  mm deep and 40  mm long [13 – 15]. However, the transducers on the EVO Series UC 1.0 are mounted on a <b>pigging</b> <b>tool</b> and operate at a circumferential angle of incidence, which is limited to the detection of transversely oriented cracks.|$|E

40|$|Water {{injection}} is {{a practical}} and widely employed method to promote production for oil industry especially for mature oil reservoirs. For this seawater, aquifer water and produced water (water recovered from crude oil) are most commonly used. Typically the water injection pipelines (WIP) are carbon steel and are not cathodically protected. The potential for pipeline failure caused by internal corrosion is an on-going concern for the industry. Corrosion mitigation methods include deoxygenation, corrosion inhibitors, biocides, and pigging. The most serious corrosion problem is channelling corrosion, known also as 6 o’clock corrosion or bottom of line corrosion, although it does not occur in all pipelines, for reasons not fully understood. It shows as aggressive corrosion at the bottom part of pipelines and is much more severe than corrosion elsewhere in WIPs. Recent assessment and monitoring of several water injection pipelines from the North Sea continental shelf obtained either by intelligent <b>pigging</b> <b>tools</b> or onsite bio-coupons has indicated that microbiologically influenced corrosion (MIC) and under-deposit corrosion {{are likely to be}} involved in channelling corrosion. Despite occasional industrial reports and conference papers, the comprehensive interpretation of this type of corrosion is still limited. The present paper outlines an experimental pilot study of under-deposit corrosion of mild steel model pipeline coupons exposed to deoxygenated natural seawater in simulated field conditions. Identical test rigs and different test scenarios were established to ascertain the influence of the presence of deposits, of water quality, surface roughness and nitrate addition. SEM observations of changes in surface topography for the first set of samples after 12 days exposure are reported.

5000|$|Background and {{origin of}} the term [...] "pig":In the field, a device that travels inside a {{pipeline}} to clean or inspect it is typically known as a pig. PIG is an acronym for [...] "Pipeline Inspection Gauge". The acronym PIG came later as the nickname for [...] "pig" [...] originated from cleaning pigs (first designed pigs) that actually sounded like squealing or screeching pigs when they passed through the lines scraping, scrubbing and [...] "squeegeeing" [...] the internal surface. The name serves as common industry jargon for all <b>pigs,</b> both intelligent <b>tools</b> and cleaning <b>tools.</b> <b>Pigs,</b> in order to fit inside the pipeline, are cylindrical and are necessarily short {{in order to be}} able to negotiate bends in the pipeline. Many other short, cylindrical objects, such as propane storage tanks, are also known as pigs and it is likely that the name came from the shape of the devices. In some countries a pig is known as a [...] "Diablo", literally translated to mean [...] "the Devil" [...] relating to the shuddering sound the tool would make as it passed beneath people's feet. The pigs are built to match the diameter of a pipeline and use the very product being carried to end users to transport them. Pigs have been used in pipelines for many years and have many uses. Some separate one product from another, some clean and some inspect. An MFL tool is known as an [...] "intelligent" [...] or [...] "smart" [...] inspection pig because it contains electronics and collects data real-time while travelling through the pipeline. Sophisticated electronics on board allow this tool to accurately detect features as small as 1 cm by 1 cm, dimensions of the wall of a pipeline as well as depth or thickness of wall (helps indicate potential wall loss).|$|R

40|$|More {{than three}} million {{kilometers}} of high pressure liquid and gas pipelines are installed around the world. Generally steel pipelines {{provide the most}} safe means to transport large quantities of oil, oil related products and natural gas. However, {{just like any other}} technical component they can deteriorate. As a result flaws can appear and grow until the pipeline fails. Besides metal loss caused by corrosion, the appearance of stress corrosion cracking is of increasing concern.

Traditionally, RVA has been considered the primary cause of diarrhea in pigs, and RVB and RVC had been described sporadically in pigs until recently. Qualitative porcine RVA, RVB, and RVC RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) assays were designed and 7508 porcine diarrheic samples, submitted to University of Minnesota, were tested to estimate the percentage of RVA, RVB, and RVC over a period of approximately 2 years (from 2009 to 2011). The individual RVA and RVC RT-qPCR assays were multiplex into a single RT-qPCR while the RVB RT-qPCR assay remained as an individual RT-qPCR. In total, 83 % of the samples were positive for RVA, RVB, or RVC. As expected, RVA was detected at the highest overall percentage (62 %). However, 33 % and 53 % of the samples were positive for RVB and RVC, respectively, indicating that both RVB and RVC are also epidemiologically important in the swine population.

To evaluate {{the consequences of}} chronic non-occlusive coronary artery (CA) stenosis on myocardial function, perfusion and viability, we developed a closed-chest, closed-pericardium pig model, using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as quantitative imaging <b>tool.</b> <b>Pigs</b> underwent a percutaneous copper-coated stent implantation in the left circumflex CA (n = 19) or sham operation (n = 5). To evaluate the occurrence of myocardial infarction, cardiac troponin I (cTnI) levels were repetitively measured. At week 6, CA stenosis severity was quantified with angiography and cine, first-pass and contrast-enhanced MRI were performed to evaluate cardiac function, perfusion and viability. In the stenting group, cTnI values significantly increased at day 3 and day 5 (P = 0. 01), and normalized at day 12. At angiography, 13 / 19 stented pigs had a stenosis > 75 %. Mean degree of CA stenosis was 91 +/- 4 %, range 83 - 98 %. At contrast-enhanced MRI, mean infarct size was 7 +/- 6 %, range 0. 7 - 18. 4 %.

We had observed that pigs infected with Trichuris suis for 21 days showed significant changes in the proximal colon microbiota. In this study, interactions between worm burden and severity of disruptions to the microbial composition and metabolic potentials in the porcine proximal colon microbiota were investigated using metagenomic <b>tools.</b> <b>Pigs</b> were infected by a single dose of T. suis eggs for 53 days. Among infected pigs, two cohorts were differentiated that either had adult worms or were worm-free. Infection resulted in a significant change in the abundance of approximately 13 % of genera detected in the proximal colon microbiota regardless of worm status, suggesting a relatively persistent change over time in the microbiota due to the initial infection. A significant reduction in the abundance of Fibrobacter and Ruminococcus indicated a change in the fibrolytic capacity of the colon microbiota in T. suis infected pigs. In addition, ∼ 10 % of identified KEGG pathways were affected by infection, including ABC transporters, peptidoglycan biosynthesis, and lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis as well as α-linolenic acid metabolism. Trichuris suis infection modulated host immunity to Campylobacter because there was a 3 -fold increase in the relative abundance in the colon microbiota of infected pigs with worms compared to naïve controls, but a 3 -fold reduction in worm-free infected pigs compared to controls. The level of pathology observed in infected pigs with worms compared to worm-free infected pigs may relate to the local host response because expression of several Th 2 -related genes were enhanced in infected pigs with worms versus those worm-free. Our findings provided insight into the dynamics of the proximal colon microbiota in pigs in response to T. suis infection...|$|R
40|$|The {{basic problem}} of main {{pipelines}} non-destructive examination is {{reliability and validity}} of obtained parameters of flaws (including stress-corrosion cracks). One of the most rapid and efficient NDT techniques for main pipelines is the method of magnetic flux leak (MFL) over defect. In accordance with magnetic method canon- the examination reliability (that is probability of crack detection starting from some preset threshold level) is a multiparameter task. The MFL technique is widely used for detection of internal and external stress-corrosion. The instruments implementing MFL method provide magnetization of pipeline wall material up to the technical saturation level; after that the magnetic filed flux leak is registered by magnetic field sensors. Stress-corrosion and corrosion like defects present in the pipeline wall are detected based on information picked up from those sensors. The difficulty in this case is the fact that basic measured parameter is subjected to impacts of numerous factors including material sensitivity towards magnetization, types of sensors and there location, pipeline wall thickness, the gap between pipeline surface and measuring element, etc. The magnetic instruments, as a rule, comprise: magnetic module inducing magnetic field in the pipeline wall; sensors placed between magnets at certain distance from each other. If it is required to evaluate the depth of the stress-corrosion crack the number of sensors and distance between them should be determined. Also it is necessary to evaluate and determine the distance between neighboring stress-corrosion cracks making it possible to differentiate them. In the paper posed is the problem and discussed are approaches of its solution, i. e. how to define the sufficient number of sensors to detect peak signal amplitude that can be correlated to the depth of stress-corrosion crack and how to determine minimal distances between cracks for which the last ones can be differentiated.

40|$|African {{swine fever}} (ASF) is an {{economically}} devastating disease for the pig industry, especially in Africa. Identifying what supports infection on pig farms {{in this region}} remains the key component in developing a risk-based approach to understanding the epidemiology of ASF and controlling the disease. Nigeria was used for this matched case-control study, because there is perpetual infection in some areas, while contiguous areas are intermittently infected. Risk factors and biosecurity practices in pig farms were evaluated in association with ASF infection. Subsets of farms located in high-density pig population areas and high-risk areas for ASF infection were randomly selected for analysis. Most plausible risk factor variables from the univariable analysis included in the multivariable analysis include: owner of farm had regular contact with infected farms and other farmers, untested pigs were routinely purchased into the farm {{in the course of}} outbreaks, there was an infected neighbourhood, other livestock were kept alongside pigs, there was a presence of an abattoir/slaughter slab in pig communities, wild birds had free access to <b>pig</b> pens, <b>tools</b> and implements were routinely shared by pig farmers, there was free access to feed stores by rats, and feed were purchased from a commercial source Only the presence of an abattoir in a pig farming community (OR = 8. 20; CI 95 % = 2. 73; 24. 63; P < 0. 001) and the presence of an infected pig farm in the neighbourhood (OR = 3. 26; CI 95 % = 1. 20; 8. 83; P = 0. 02) were significant. There was a marginally significant negative association (protective) between risk of ASF infection and sharing farm tools and equipment (OR = 0. 35; CI 95 % = 0. 12; 1. 01; P = 0. 05). Of the 28 biosecurity measures evaluated, food and water control (OR = 0. 14; CI 95 % = 0. 04, 0. 46; P < 0. 001), separation/isolation of sick pigs (OR = 0. 14; CI 95 % = 0. 04, 0. 53; P = 0. 004) and washing and disinfection of farm equipment and tools (OR = 0. 27; CI 95 % = 0. 10, 0. 78; P = 0. 02) were negatively associated (protective) with ASF infection. Consultation and visits by veterinarian/paraveterinarians when animals were sick (OR = 8. 11; CI 95 % = 2. 13, 30. 90; P = 0. 002), and pest and rodent control were positively associated with ASF infection of Nigerian farms (OR = 4. 94; CI 95 % = 1. 84, 13. 29; P = 0. 002). The presentation of sick and unthrifty pigs for slaughter at abattoirs, farmers’ inadvertent role, an infected neighbourhood, a pig to pig contact, rodents and wild birds may contribute to infections of farms, whereas washing, disinfection of tools, food and water control, and separation of sick pigs reduces the likelihood of infections. Underlying reasons for these observations and strategies for control are discussed. [URL]...|$|R
40|$|Aging {{natural gas}} {{pipeline}} infrastructure {{is becoming an}} increasingly large problem in the United States. There are more than 2. 4 million miles of pipelines currently in use, all of which require regular maintenance and inspection to ensure safety. It is estimated that 70 % of these lines were installed prior to {{the widespread use of}} the most common inspection <b>tool,</b> <b>pigs,</b> and therefore require some other tool to carry out tasks such as direct line inspection, pipeline mapping, gas quality monitoring, and cleaning. This has prompted a large growth in the area of robotic inspection devices to fill this market gap. However, many of the robots developed either fall short of true autonomy, are unable to operate in live flow conditions, or are designed for only a specific pipe size. This thesis details the design of a robotic platform called MARPI, or Miniature Autonomous Robot for Pipeline Inspection, which addresses the weaknesses of both pigs and previous robots. MARPI is a wheeled robot that was developed to include several key features: energy harvesting, wireless communication, onboard navigation system, and a small profile and footprint in the pipe. The robot uses two 150 : 1 micro gear motors for its drive mechanism and features a permanent Neodymium magnet to make the robot adhere to the surface of steel pipes. The energy harvesting system was characterized through a series of wind tunnel experiments which showed that to maximize the power generated it is best to have a turbine with a high number of buckets/blades, streamlined bucket geometry, and a relatively large offset from a bluff body below. To carry out the design of MARPI, a statics model was developed and used to predict the magnetic force required to adhere to and avoid sliding in the pipe, and the motor torque required to propel the robot. This model was used to analyze the performance of the robot as a function of robot size. Key results show that to minimize power consumption, the robot should travel vertically with the flow, and to maximize range per day, a small robot with a large turbine is best...|$|R
40|$|Bovine virus {{diarrhea}} (BVD) is {{a complicated}} disease to discuss as it {{can result in a}} wide variety of disease problems from very mild to very severe. BVD can be one of the most devastating diseases cattle encounter and one of the hardest to get rid of when it attacks a herd. The viruses that cause BVD have been grouped into two genotypes, Type I and Type II. The disease syndrome caused by the two genotypes is basically the same, however disease caused by Type II infection is often more severe. The various disease syndromes noted in cattle infected with BVD virus are mainly attributed to the age of the animal when it became infected and to certain characteristics of the virus involved. Diseases caused by BVD infection Fetal BVD infections (infection of the unborn calf) : The result of a fetal infection with the BVD virus is usually determined by the age of the fetus at the time of infection. The virus is capable of passing from an infected cow to the unborn fetus which is particularly vulnerable to the BVD virus during the first 6 months of pregnancy. Death of the fetus is common if the infection occurs during the first 120 days of pregnancy and the cow will lose the pregnancy. However, if the fetus survives an early infection, it will be born without a detectable antibody titer and be persistently infected (PI) with the BVD virus. During the first 120 days of gestation, the fetus has an underdeveloped immune system and does not recognize the BVD virus as foreign. The fetus does not mount an immune response against the virus, remains infected, and does not have a detectable anti-BVD titer. It is not uncommon for the surviving fetus to be malformed; blindness, skeletal abnormalities and under-developed brains are common defects noted in such calves. A BVD PI calf may appear normal, be weak at birth, grow poorly, be susceptible to respiratory diseases, and die before they can be weaned. They may also grow normally, reach breeding age, and produce more persistently BVD infected calves (The virus is passed from generation to generation). PI carriers can only be created by infection with BVD virus during the first 110 - 120 days of pregnancy. These animals shed billions of virus particles every day in their urine, feces, and saliva, and are a source of infection for other animals in the herd. If the fetus becomes infected after 120 days of pregnancy, there may be an abortion but usually, because this aged fetus has a more developed immune system and can elicit an immune response against the BVD virus, a healthy calf is born that has a good level of BVD antibody titer. Subclinical BVD infections: Most animals that become infected with BVD never show signs of disease caused by the virus; however infection can lower the animal’s resistance to other infections, which could result in illness. For example, in feedlot calves, BVD infection may go unnoticed, but the lungs become susceptible to infection with bacteria such as Mannheimia haemolytica (previously called Pasteurella haemolytica) and other agents that cause “shipping fever”. Some people believe that BVD is one of the most significant disease organisms involved with respiratory disease of cattle. Severe acute BVD infections: This disease syndrome is usually (but not always) associated with Type II BVD virus infection. The affected animals will exhibit high fevers (107 - 110 F), occasional diarrhea, respiratory disease, and they will not eat. Peracute BVD can affect cattle of all ages and often results in death of the animal within 48 hours of disease onset regardless of age. Acute BVD infections: The classic, acute form of BVD is characterized by a fever of 104 - 106 F, discharge from the nose and eyes, erosions of the muzzle and in the mouth, and diarrhea that may contain mucus and blood. Diarrhea is usually present in every herd that has an outbreak of acute BVD, but diarrhea is not present in every animal that has acute BVD. The percentage of the herd exhibiting clinical disease and dying can vary extremely; however, if "secondary infections" are controlled, most animals survive the acute disease. This syndrome usually occurs in cattle 6 to 24 months of age. Acute Mucosal disease: An animal persistently infected with BVD virus is not able to mount any defense against becoming subsequently infected with a different BVD virus. When a BVD infection is superimposed on a PI animal, mucosal disease usually results. Acute mucosal disease is characterized by fever, profuse, watery diarrhea, erosions of the mouth, lack of appetite, discharge from the eyes and nose, and occasionally lameness. Secondary infections, such as pneumonia and mastitis, are common. Cattle with acute mucosal disease usually die within 3 to 10 days. Chronic Mucosal disease: Some cattle that develop mucosal disease do not die as soon as expected but rather become chronically infected. Cattle with chronic mucosal disease are poor doers, and may have persistently loose stools or intermittent diarrhea, chronic bloat, decreased appetite, weight loss, erosions between the claws, or non-healing skin lesions. Discharge from the eyes and nose, bald spots due to loss of hair, and long-term lameness are also common. Cattle with chronic mucosal disease rarely survive beyond 18 months and ultimately die. Treatment and Prevention of BVD infections There is no effective treatment for infection with BVD, but most cases are subclinical and self-limiting. Antibiotics, fluid and supportive therapy may be indicated to control secondary infections. Offering highly palatable feed could tempt sick animals to eat needed nutrients. Vaccination of susceptible cattle has been the principal approach to the prevention and control of BVD. However, preventing the introduction of BVD into your herd and identifying and eliminating PI animals from your herd are important steps to take to control the disease. Vaccinate calves: Calves should be vaccinated twice with a modified live virus (MLV) vaccine before leaving the herd of origin. Ideally, BVD vaccinations should be completed in the calves at least 30 days prior to weaning, but whatever program you initiate needs to fit with your management system. Check with your veterinarian for specific recommendations for your herd. Vaccinate the cow herd: It is difficult to provide blanket recommendations for vaccinating the cow herd, but some general guidelines can be given. Unvaccinated heifers and cows should be properly vaccinated before breeding to ensure protection for the fetus. All bulls should be properly vaccinated before putting them out with the cows or heifers and new additions should be properly vaccinated before adding them to the herd. Modified live virus vaccines can be safely used in open cows (there are new MLV vaccines safe for pregnant cows if the cows have been previously vaccinated with certain products) and provide long-lasting protection. Killed vaccines are safe for all cattle, but usually don’t provide as strong an immune response and may need more frequent booster vaccinations. Again, check with your veterinarian for specific recommendations. Prevent introduction of BVD into your herd: BVD virus is shed from cattle in the feces and in secretions from the nose and mouth. BVD is also readily transmitted by aerosol droplets and direct contact. Avoiding contact with other cattle is therefore an important step to take to prevent infection from entering your herd. “Good fences make good neighbors”. It is especially important to keep pregnant cows less than 120 days pregnant separated from other cattle. New introductions into your herd need to be tested for PI status. Eliminate PI animals from your herd: Until recently, testing cattle for PI infection was prohibitively expensive but now there are tools available making it feasible to test for and eliminate these “typhoid Mary” animals from the herd. There are two types of test available, one using a skin sample and one using a blood sample: Immunohistochemistry – for this test, a small notch of skin is taken from the edge of the ear, easily done using a <b>pig</b> ear-notching <b>tool.</b> The triangular piece of skin removed should be ¼ to ½ inches per side. Depending on the laboratory the sample will be sent to, the removed skin is placed either in a vial containing formalin or an individual plastic bag. All samples must be clearly labeled with the animals’ identification number. PCR – this test requires that a blood sample in a “purple top” tube be taken and submitted. Again, all samples must be clearly labeled with the individual animal ID. Samples can be sent to a number of different laboratories; three are listed below. Be sure to contact the lab and talk to your veterinarian before taking and sending samples – if you take the wrong samples, all your work may be wasted. Be aware that it is possible to have “false positive” results – some animals may test positive when they are not truly persistently infected, and may need to be re-tested.
