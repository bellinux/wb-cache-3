30|$|The current {{practice}} of seismic microzonation {{in most of}} the countries is to transfer the bedrock motion to the surface using 1 D S-wave response of a soil column. Based on the theoretical studies, it was inferred that 1 D response was inadequate to explain the observed damages in the Santa Monica during the 1994 Northridge earthquake [4] and in the Kobe basin during the 1995 Kobe, Japan earthquake [9]. To incorporate the 2 D/ 3 D complex site effects in seismic microzonation, Chavez-Garcia and Faccioli [19] have proposed the term aggravation factor (aggravation factor is simply the extra spectral amplification due to the complex 2 D/ 3 D site effects over the 1 D response of a soil column). The differential ground motion (DGM) caused by surface waves has an important effect on the response of lifelines, such as <b>pipelines,</b> <b>bridges</b> and communication transmission systems. The DGM induces significant additional stresses in the structures than the ones induced if the motions at the supports were considered to be identical. In the basins, an important cause for the spatial variation of seismic ground motions is the basin generated surface wave.|$|R

40|$|Rayleigh, Brillouin and Raman scatterings in fibers {{result from}} the {{interaction}} of photons with local material characteristic features like density, temperature and strain. For example an acoustic/mechanical wave generates a dynamic density variation; such a variation may be affected by local temperature, strain, vibration and birefringence. By detecting changes in the amplitude, frequency and phase of light scattered along a fiber, one can realize a distributed fiber sensor for measuring localized temperature, strain, vibration and birefringence over lengths ranging from meters to one hundred kilometers. Such a measurement {{can be made in}} the time domain or frequency domain to resolve location information. With coherent detection of the scattered light one can observe changes in birefringence and beat length for fibers and devices. The progress on state of the art technology for sensing performance, in terms of spatial resolution and limitations on sensing length is reviewed. These distributed sensors can be used for disaster prevention in the civil structural monitoring of <b>pipelines,</b> <b>bridges,</b> dams and railroads. A sensor with centimeter spatial resolution and high precision measurement of temperature, strain, vibration and birefringence can find applications in aerospace smart structures, material processing, and the characterization of optical materials and devices...|$|R

40|$|The immune {{response}} to viral infection is regulated by an intricate network of many genes and their products. The reverse engineering of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) using mathematical models from time course gene expression data collected after influenza infection {{is key to}} our understanding of the mechanisms involved in controlling influenza infection within a host. A five-step pipeline: detection of temporally differentially expressed genes, clustering genes into co-expressed modules, identification of network structure, parameter estimate refinement, and functional enrichment analysis, is developed for reconstructing high-dimensional dynamic GRNs from genome-wide time course gene expression data. Applying the pipeline to the time course gene expression data from influenza-infected mouse lungs, we have identified 20 distinct temporal expression patterns in the differentially expressed genes and constructed a module-based dynamic network using a linear ODE model. Both intra-module and inter-module annotations and regulatory relationships of our inferred network show some interesting findings and are highly consistent with existing knowledge about the {{immune response}} in mice after influenza infection. The proposed method is a computationally efficient, data-driven <b>pipeline</b> <b>bridging</b> experimental data, mathematical modeling, and statistical analysis.
