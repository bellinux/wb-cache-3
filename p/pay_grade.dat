5|$|Sometimes {{in areas}} where the new wages were applied, {{factories}} would struggle to recruit workers for important tasks because the reform had given a low <b>pay</b> <b>grade</b> to a task that was considered to require a lower level of skill. For example, machine-tool operation was given a low <b>pay</b> <b>grade,</b> and at one factory in Kotlyakov some 30 machine-tools sat unused as factory managers were unable to recruit workers to operate them.|$|E

50|$|The {{commissioned}} officer {{ranks of the}} U.S. Navy are divided into three categories: junior officers, senior officers, and flag officers. Junior officers are those officers in <b>pay</b> <b>grades</b> O-1 to O-4, while senior officers are those in <b>pay</b> <b>grades</b> O-5 and O-6, and flag officers are those in <b>pay</b> <b>grades</b> of O-7 and above.|$|R
50|$|The {{commissioned}} officer {{ranks of the}} USAF are divided into three categories: company grade officers, field grade officers, and general officers. Company grade officers are those officers in <b>pay</b> <b>grades</b> O-1 to O-3, while field grade officers are those in <b>pay</b> <b>grades</b> O-4 to O-6, and general officers are those in <b>pay</b> <b>grades</b> of O-7 and above.|$|R
50|$|<b>Pay</b> <b>grades</b> {{are divided}} into three groups: enlisted (E), warrant officer (W), and officer (O). Enlisted <b>pay</b> <b>grades</b> begin at E-1 and end at E-9; warrant officer <b>pay</b> <b>grades</b> {{originate}} at W-1 and terminate at W-5; and officer <b>pay</b> <b>grades</b> start at O-1 and finish at O-11. Not all of the uniformed services use all of the grades; for example, the Navy and Coast Guard (USCG) do not use the grade W-1 (the USCG also does not use W-5), and the Air Force (USAF) discontinued appointing new warrant officers in 1959 (although the last USAF warrant officer did not retire until 1992).|$|R
25|$|Suites {{include a}} {{separate}} bedroom with king size {{bed and a}} full bath, living area with two queen size sofa beds, and an additional full bath.

25|$|Since the {{education}} level of Rettungsassistent {{could be obtained}} by own expenses, the working market was very employer friendly. With the new Notfallsanitäter system, the number of paramedics in the system is restricted to {{a smaller number of}} paid and employed apprentices finishing their education. So a more employee friendly work market could be expected, influencing the <b>pay</b> <b>grade</b> in a positive way.|$|E
25|$|These {{differences}} {{are not merely}} external, but a core aspect of military life. Children of enlisted personnel often believe that children of officers receive specialized treatment because non-officers are afraid to upset the officers. The physical separation and differences between available activities make it very difficult. Most military brats {{on a personal level}} do not let this affect their social interactions, and in most cases it is frowned upon to treat others by their parent's <b>pay</b> <b>grade</b> or rank.|$|E
50|$|In the U.S. Army and U.S. Air Force, {{recipients}} of the Meritorious Service Medal (MSM) are typically field <b>grade</b> officers in <b>pay</b> <b>grades</b> O-4 through O-6 (major, lieutenant colonel, colonel), senior U.S. Army chief warrant officers in <b>pay</b> <b>grades</b> W-3 through W-5 (CW3 to CW5), and senior non-commissioned officers (E-7 to E-9) in both the Army and the Air Force. Award of the MSM may be for meritorious performance while serving in a staff position as a field grade officer, senior chief warrant officer, or senior non-commissioned officer, or, {{in the case of}} field grade officers, for successful completion of a command tour at the battalion (Army) or squadron (Army or Air Force) level. Award of the MSM to company <b>grade</b> officers in <b>pay</b> <b>grades</b> O-1 through O-3 (2d lieutenant, 1st lieutenant, captain), junior warrant officers/chief warrant officers in <b>pay</b> <b>grades</b> W-1 and W-2 (WO1 and CW2, Army only), and junior NCOs in <b>pay</b> <b>grades</b> E-6 and below is rare and typically by exception.|$|R

25|$|After {{returning}} to active duty, Hathcock helped establish the Marine Corps Scout Sniper School, at the Marine base in Quantico, Virginia. Due to his extreme injuries suffered in Vietnam, {{he was in}} nearly constant pain, but he continued to dedicate himself to teaching snipers. In 1975, Hathcock's health began to deteriorate, and {{he was diagnosed with}} multiple sclerosis. He stayed in the Marine Corps, but his health continued to decline. And, just 55 days short of the 20 years that would have made him eligible for regular retirement pay, he received a permanent disability separation. Being medically discharged, he received 100 percent disability pay. He would have received only 50 percent of his final <b>pay</b> <b>grade</b> had he retired after 20 years. He fell into a state of depression when he was forced out of the Marines, because he felt as if the service had kicked him out. During this depression, his wife Jo nearly left him but decided to stay. Hathcock eventually picked up the hobby of shark fishing, which helped him overcome his depression.|$|E
500|$|A United States Navy enlisted rate {{indicates}} {{where an}} enlisted Sailor stands within {{the chain of}} command, and also defines one's <b>pay</b> <b>grade.</b> An enlisted sailor's rate is similar conceptually to a naval officer's rank. Only Naval Officers carry the term [...] "rank". The word rate refers to an enlisted sailor's <b>pay</b> <b>grade,</b> while the word rating refers to one's area of occupational specialization within the enlisted Navy. Associated with the enlisted pay grades is a numbering system from the most junior enlisted sailor ("E-1") to the most senior enlisted sailor ("E-9"). This enlisted numbering system is the same across all five branches of the U.S. Military. All E-1 through E-3 are known as Seamen. E-4 through E-6 are called Petty Officers. All E-7s are called Chief Petty Officer, E-8s Senior Chief Petty Officer, and E-9s Master Chief Petty Officer. Rates are displayed on a rating badge, which {{is a combination of}} rate and rating. E-2s and E-3s have color-coded group rate marks based on their career field. Personnel in <b>pay</b> <b>grade</b> E-1, since 1996, do not have an insignia to wear.|$|E
500|$|A brevet {{promotion}} or brevet is {{the advancement}} in rank without the advancement in either <b>pay</b> <b>grade</b> or position. Typically, a brevetted officer {{would be given}} the insignia of the brevetted rank, but not the pay or formal authority. [...] Brevet promotions were originally authorized for the United States Army in 1775 by the Second Continental Congress. In 1778 a resolution was passed stating brevets would only be authorized [...] "..to officers in the line or in case of very eminent services...".|$|E

500|$|In {{the later}} Empire, the dignitas ("worth, esteem") that {{attended}} on senatorial or equestrian rank was refined further with titles such as vir illustris, [...] "illustrious man". The appellation clarissimus (Greek lamprotatos) {{was used to}} designate the dignitas of certain senators and their immediate family, including women. [...] "Grades" [...] of equestrian status proliferated. Those in Imperial service were ranked by <b>pay</b> <b>grade</b> (sexagenarius, 60,000 sesterces per annum; centenarius, 100,000; ducenarius, 200,000). The title eminentissimus, [...] "most eminent" [...] (Greek exochôtatos) was reserved for equestrians who had been Praetorian prefects.

2500|$|There {{is a small}} {{percentage}} of Lieutenants and Sergeants who work as Investigative Supervisors (approximately equal to 10% of their respective ranks) and are granted the prestigious <b>pay</b> <b>grade</b> designations of [...] "Sergeant—Supervisor Detective Squad" [...] (SDS), or Lieutenant—Commander Detective Squad (CDS) therefore assuming full Investigative command responsibility as opposed to operational supervision. Their <b>pay</b> <b>grade</b> rises to an approximate midpoint between their normal rank and the next highest rank's <b>pay</b> <b>grade,</b> and similar to a Detective's [...] "grade", is also a discretionary promotion. This <b>pay</b> <b>grade</b> designation is achieved by assignment to Investigative units, i.e. Detective Bureau, Internal Affairs Bureau, Counter-Terrorism Bureau, Intelligence Bureau, and Organized Crime Control Bureau. Lieutenants and Sergeants in non-investigatory assignments can be designated Lieutenant-Special Assignment or Sergeant-Special Assignment, pay equivalent to their investigative counterparts.|$|E
5000|$|The sixth pay commission, in a {{departure}} from earlier pay commission, created 20 distinct <b>pay</b> <b>grades</b> or ranks in the Government hierarchy, with intent to [...] determine the status, and the Seniority of a post.

50|$|Although the Air Force {{had been}} an {{independent}} service since 1947, the rank of chief master Sergeant did not come into being until the authorization of the Military Pay Act of 1958.
