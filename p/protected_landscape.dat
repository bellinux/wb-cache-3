25|$|The {{region is}} located in the {{south-western}} part of Slovakia and has an area of 2,053km² and a population of 622,706 (2009). The region is split by the Little Carpathians which start in Bratislava and continue north-eastwards; these mountains separate two lowlands, the Záhorie lowland in the west and the fertile Danubian Lowland in the east, which grows mainly wheat and maize. Major rivers in the region are the Morava River, the Danube and the Little Danube; the last of these, together with the Danube, encircle the Žitný ostrov in the south-east. There are three <b>protected</b> <b>landscape</b> areas in the region: the Little Carpathians, Záhorie and Dunajské luhy.

40|$|Over {{the past}} few years, the function, purpose, and even {{legitimacy}} of <b>protected</b> <b>landscapes</b> and seascapes {{has been the subject}} of a surprisingly intense debate. <b>Protected</b> <b>landscapes</b> are not natural or near-natural ecosystems, such as rainforests or mangrove swamps, but areas that have been culturally defined by human management, often over periods of hundreds or thousands of years, which retain and often develop important natural, aesthetic, spiritual, and cultural values. IUCN (the International Union for the Conservation of Nature) sums them up as places “where the interaction of people and nature over time has produced an area of distinct character with significant ecological, biological, cultural and scenic value ” (Dudley 2008). On the one hand, more and more countries are designating <b>protected</b> <b>landscapes</b> (defined by IUCN as protected area category V, see below) and promoting these as major contributions to national conservation strategies. But this success has resulted in a background grumbling of concern about the efficacy of the approach, culminating in an influential paper (Locke and Dearden 2005), which argued that designations such as <b>protected</b> <b>landscapes</b> or extractive reserves (IUCN category VI) have little to do with biodiversity conservatio...|$|R
