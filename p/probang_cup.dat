40|$|Following {{contact with}} {{foot and mouth disease}} virus (FMDV), cattle can become {{persistently}} infected {{regardless of the}} preexisting of immune status of the animal and whether it develops clinical disease. The cellular site(s) of FMDV persistence has not been determined. Using in situ hybridisation in combination with tyramide signal amplification (TSA), we provide the first direct evidence that the FMDV RNA is localized within the epithelial cells of the soft palate/pharynx during persistent infection, indicating that these cells remain persistently infected following contact with FMDV. MATERIALS AND METHODS Samples Four cattle were infected in high containment animal accommodation with the FMDV C Oberbayern by intradermolingual inoculation with 107 TCID 50. Samples of soft palate and pharynx were collected at post-mortem from cattle killed at 7, 42, 72 and 82 days after infection. Tissues were immediately fixed in 10 % formal-FIXX (Shandon, UK) for 16 hours, washed with PBS and embedded in paraffin wax. Negative controls included similar tissue sections from an uninfected animal processed identically to those taken from the FMDV infected cattle. Oropharyngeal fluid (OPF) was collected approximately weekly {{for the duration of the}} study using a <b>probang</b> <b>cup.</b> The infectivity of each OPF was determined by inoculation of monolayers of primary bovine thyroid (BTY) cells. Oligo probe and labelling Oligonucleotide (oligo) sequences (Table 1) were chosen from the highly conserved regions of the FMDV non-structural genes and synthesized by Crunchem (Crunchem, UK).
