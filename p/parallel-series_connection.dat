50|$|The {{locomotive}} {{is equipped}} with six LKb-635 (though some sources give LKa-635) engines which are mounted on the bogies with a tram system. The engines propel the axles with a 85:24 transmission. There are three ways of connecting the engines: series connection (all six engines in one series), series-parallel connection (three engines in one series - two groups) and <b>parallel-series</b> <b>connection</b> (two engines in one series - three groups).9 Four-step reduction of engine excitation (up to 50%) is made by bypassing parts of main pole's windings with shunts and resistors. Shunts and resistors are in parallel connection with main pole's winding. Each engine has four steel main poles, isolated with varnish and four commutation poles made of one steel block.|$|E
40|$|Brune’s {{tests are}} well known in circuit theory. They are two simple voltage tests used to {{ascertain}} whether the over- all component stemming from the parallel–parallel, series–series, series–parallel, or <b>parallel–series</b> <b>connection</b> of two four-terminal components has a two-port matrix that {{is equal to the}} sum of the appropriate individual two-port matrices. What is less known is that Brune’s tests only are necessary and sufficient for reciprocal components and that all the extensions that are available in litera- ture to also cover the nonreciprocal components are inaccurate. In this brief, a rigorous and thorough unified analysis of the four connections is carried out. It provides the complete characterization of the overall component under a two-port operation in the general case and, most importantly, the exact parameter conditions and voltage/current tests for the validity of the matrix sum rule...|$|E
40|$|As {{the price}} of solar panels decrease, the use of Photovoltaic (PV) arrays to {{generate}} power will greatly increase. Due to location constraints many of these arrays will be installed in locations where the array receives partial shading during part {{or all of the}} day due to trees or other structures. Many purchasers of PV arrays will research the efficiency of the solar panels but give very little attention to the configuration of the PV array. The order of series and parallel connections of the array to increase voltage and current respectively greatly affects the overall efficiency of the PV array when it is partially shaded. ^ In this thesis, the effects of partial shading on PV arrays are modeled and simulated using MATLAB Simulink®®. A model for a solar cell and panel is developed and simulated. The series and parallel connection of panels to boost array voltage and current is discussed. The effects of shading on the array and the use of bypass diodes are explored. Maximum power point tracking algorithms are created using the Perturb and Observe process and DC-DC converters to optimize power and match current and voltage for series and parallel connected panels are developed. PV arrays comprised of different connection combinations of nine PV panels such as series, parallel, series-parallel and parallel-series are modeled and simulated to predict the effect of partial cell shading on array efficiency. The simulation results demonstrate that under parallel and <b>parallel-series</b> <b>connections</b> the losses due to partial shading are greatly reduced relative to series and series-parallel connections. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an interleaved resonant converter with a <b>parallel-series</b> transformer <b>connection</b> {{in order to}} achieve ripple current reduction at the output capacitor, zero voltage turn-on for the active switches, zero current turn-off for the rectifier diodes, less voltage stress on the rectifier diodes, and less current stress on the transformer primary windings. The primary windings of the two transformers are connected in parallel in order to share the input current and to reduce the root-mean-square (rms) current on the primary windings. The secondary windings of the two transformers are connected in series {{in order to ensure that}} the transformer primary currents are balanced. A full-wave diode rectifier is used at the output side to clamp the voltage stress of the rectifier diode at the output voltage. Two circuit modules are operated with the interleaved PWM scheme so that the input and output ripple currents are reduced. Based on the resonant behavior, all of the active switches are turned on under zero voltage switching (ZVS), and the rectifier diodes are turned off under zero current switching (ZCS) if the operating switching frequency is less than the series resonant frequency. Finally, experiments with a 1 kW prototype are described to verify the effectiveness of the proposed converter...|$|R
