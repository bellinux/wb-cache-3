25|$|At school, Close {{was a good}} {{all-around}} sportsman, and {{an excellent}} cricketer: Aireborough went unbeaten in the six cricketing summers while Close was there. Close dominated junior level cricket in the area, {{both within and outside}} schools. He joined Rawdon Cricket Club in 1942, when he was eleven years of age, and was almost immediately selected to play for the under-18 side and for the Second XI. However, he also excelled as a pupil, and seriously considered becoming a doctor. His headmaster at Aireborough believed that he could have been accepted into Cambridge or Oxford universities had he not opted to become a <b>professional</b> <b>sportsman.</b>|$|E

25|$|Wells himself matured in {{a society}} wherein the merit of an {{individual}} was not considered as important as their social class of origin. His father was a <b>professional</b> <b>sportsman,</b> which was seen as inferior to 'gentle' status; whereas {{his mother had been}} a domestic servant, and Wells himself was, prior to his writing career, apprenticed to a draper. Trained as a scientist, he was able to relate his experiences of struggle to Darwin's idea of a world of struggle; but perceived science as a rational system, which extended beyond traditional ideas of race, class and religious notions, and in fiction challenged the use of science to explain political and social norms of the day.|$|E
500|$|In May 1866, the MCC's {{minute book}} {{featured}} an unusual request: Roland Newbury, the club's pavilion keeper, wanted [...] "use {{of the ground}} for two days... for purpose of a match with the native black eleven". It was the first intimation of a cricket match between the MCC and an Aboriginal team from Victoria's Western District. The motive behind the match, scheduled for late December, was a financial one, and in August, Wills agreed to coach the Aborigines. Wills' reasons for accepting the role remain a mystery, but his need for money was likely a factor. This was to {{mark the beginning of}} his transition from amateur to <b>professional</b> <b>sportsman.</b>|$|E
500|$|Miller {{had only}} been back in Australia for a week when he faced Wally Hammond's visiting English team in the touring side's match against Victoria. His fielding and batting were rusty after the long layoff, and the media {{constantly}} probed him about the contract he had signed with Rawtenstall Cricket Club in the Lancashire League a few months earlier, to start in 1947. Miller said nothing in the press, but the Victorian Cricket Association made public appeals for an employer to give Miller a job {{so that he would}} not leave the state and become a <b>professional</b> <b>sportsman</b> in England. In the match against Hammond's men, Miller struggled while scoring 32 in the first innings before being dismissed by leg spinner Doug Wright. In the Victorian second innings he was bowled by James Langridge for eight. [...] Victorian captain Lindsay Hassett was not willing to ask Miller to bowl, given his lack of thorough preparation for the season; the tourists won the match by 244 runs.|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the {{accounting}} and tax legislation with focus on professional sport {{not only from the}} perspective of sport clubs but also of individual sportsmen. The aim of the thesis is to identify accounting and tax specificities of professional sport, including the definition of differences in keeping accounts of non-profit organisations and business entities, and to analyse {{the current state of the}} income taxation of <b>professional</b> <b>sportsmen</b> in selected countries of the EU and in the Czech Republic. Significant differences were found not only in the keeping accounts of non-profit organisations and business entities but also in the area of the income taxation of <b>professional</b> <b>sportsmen.</b> In the Czech Republic <b>professional</b> <b>sportsmen</b> are considered to be an independent profession while in the other selected countries of the European Union they are classic employees.

2500|$|In 1979, Cruyff was {{reaching}} {{the twilight of}} his career in Barcelona. He began to imagine creating a range of footwear himself to challenge the technical and luxury qualities of those on the market beforehand. After a few years of trying and failing to encourage big sportswear brands to take his idea seriously, after all this was quite an unusual ambition of a <b>professional</b> <b>sportsman</b> at the time. Eventually he combined with his close friend, Italian designer Emilio Lazzarini, and using his knowledge he set out to create a technical shoe which managed to balance functionality with elegance. Initially the range was filled with [...] "luxury" [...] indoor football shoes, but they quickly became used as a fashion shoe due to their attractive appearance. And so Cruyff Classics brand was born.|$|E

2500|$|While Hotham abided by the ruling, Carlton {{was heavily}} censured {{for refusing to}} enter the field in its next {{arranged}} match, against Melbourne, unless Coulthard was allowed to play. Melbourne would only accept their demand if Carlton [...] "assumed the responsibility of defying the association". Carlton rejected the offer, and the match was abandoned. By this stage, Carlton was in talks to secede from the VFA, but later decided to play out the season. It still sought to exonerate Coulthard, and at the VFA's next meeting, the case was reconsidered. In a move that quickly turned public opinion against the VFA, Tankard's suspension was uplifted while Coulthard's remained in place. The Australasian accused the VFA of basing its decision on [...] "various jealousies and petty personal interests", and called for the governing body to be completely restructured. It was said that Coulthard's status as a lower class <b>professional</b> <b>sportsman</b> made him a convenient scapegoat.|$|E

Woosnam was a finalist in the 1919 All England Plate tournament, a tennis competition held at the Wimbledon Championships, consisting of players who were defeated in {{the first or second}} rounds of the singles competition. Following a defeat of Woosnam while representing Cambridge University in a tennis match against Queen's Club in April 1919, the Times remarked that [...] "Woosnam is a player of many games, and he could excel at tennis if he could devote enough time to the game.....tennis is a mistress who must be constantly wooed." [...] However, Woosnam continued to divide his attention; he played football for Chelsea either side of the Queen's Club match, captaining the team. His performance for Chelsea led to selection for a North versus South international trial match. Once the football season finished, Woosnam took part in several tennis tournaments. He won both the singles and doubles titles in the Cambridge University tournament, and entered Wimbledon for the first time. His tennis form in 1919 led The Times correspondent to describe his partnership with Noel Turnbull as a [...] "doubles team of promise". Woosnam declined the opportunity to become a <b>professional</b> <b>sportsman,</b> finding the idea 'vulgar'.|$|E
