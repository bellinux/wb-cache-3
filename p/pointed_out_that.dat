They also noted that if Mascarinus was confirmed to be embedded within the Coracopsis genus, the latter would become a junior synonym, since the former name is older. In 2012, Hume expressed surprise at these findings due to the anatomical similarities between the Mascarene parrot and other parrots from the Mascarene islands that {{are believed to be}} psittaculines.

He also mentioned that Alexander's (1989) formula to calculate speed by bone strength was only partly reliable. He suggests that the formula is overly sensitive to bone length; making long bones artificially weak. He also <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> the lowered risk of being wounded in combat may have been worth the risk of Tyrannosaurus falling while running.|$|E

He reiterated that the reason for not installing the chicane was purely that it had never been tested and was thereby deemed unsafe. He <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> the alternatives that the FIA suggested were feasible, and wondered why the teams did not use the pitlane as an alternative, especially when, with only six Bridgestone cars, the Michelin teams could still compete for the points scoring seventh and eighth places.|$|E
