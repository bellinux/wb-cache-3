5|$|Based on {{the success}} of Cryptonomicon, a New York Times bestseller with sales of about 300,000 copies, the initial <b>print-run</b> for Quicksilver was 250,000 copies. Five months before the release date, a web {{campaign}} was initiated to advertise the work. The novel was originally published in a single volume; in 2006 HarperCollins republished the books in three separate paperback volumes.|$|E
5|$|The {{paper was}} {{launched}} {{with an initial}} <b>print-run</b> of 60,000, and was edited by a skeleton staff during the trial run, with plans to employ more journalists if it became a permanent publication. Initial contributors included Sunday Herald journalists Jamie Maxwell and Peter Geoghegan, as well as freelance reporter Sarah Cooper. During the initial week of publication, Walker spoke of his belief that The National would continue beyond the trial period, but said the decision was {{in the hands of}} its publishers. Following healthy sales in the first few days, Newsquest executives decided on 27 November to continue printing the newspaper, and to allocate it additional resources. On the same day, Neil Mackay, The Nationals news editor, confirmed that the paper would be published on a permanent basis. Publication then continued on weekdays until the introduction of a Saturday edition in May 2015.|$|E
5|$|Without fully {{endorsing}} the de Montesquiou explanation, Michael Coleman carefully examined the story and, in particular, the two published {{versions of the}} ladies' accounts (the earlier-written of which, from November 1901, had only previously {{been published in the}} second, small <b>print-run,</b> edition of An Adventure in 1913). Coleman concluded that the more widely available texts, as published in the 1911 and later editions, had been considerably embroidered well after the events described and after the ladies had begun their investigations, while the original accounts had little or nothing to suggest a supernatural experience. He also questioned the rigour and reliability of the ladies' subsequent researches, pointing out that few, if any, of their informants are named and that most of their literary and historical references were taken from unreliable sources.|$|E

5|$|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is {{the fifth}} book in the Harry Potter series. The first book in the series, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone was first {{published}} by Bloomsbury in 1997 with an initial <b>print-run</b> of 500copies in hardback, three hundred of which were distributed to libraries. By the end of 1997, the UK edition won a National Book Award and {{a gold medal in}} the 9to11year-olds category of the Nestl√© Smarties Book Prize. The second novel, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, was published in the UK on 2 July 1998. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was published a year later in the UK on 8 July 1999 and in the US on 8 September 1999. Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire was published on 8 July 2000 simultaneously by Bloomsbury and Scholastic.

25|$|The {{sales and}} {{marketing}} stage is closely intertwined with the editorial process. As front cover images are produced, or chapters are edited, sales people may start talking about the book with their customers to build early interest. Publishing companies often produce advanced information sheets that may be sent to customers or overseas publishers to gauge possible sales. As early interest is measured, this information feeds back through the editorial process and may affect the formatting {{of the book and}} the strategy employed to sell it. For example, if interest from foreign publishers is high, co-publishing deals may be established whereby publishers share printing costs in producing large print runs thereby lowering the per-unit cost of the books. Conversely, if initial feedback is not strong, the <b>print-run</b> of the book may be reduced, the marketing budget cut or, in some cases, the book is dropped from publication altogether.|$|E

40|$|Electronic {{publishing}} {{has transformed}} the business model of publishing houses in Spain {{in such a way}} that two models currently co-exist. There are, on the one hand, traditional publishers of mostly paper-based volumes, whose business models are based on having large catalogues of titles and large <b>print-runs,</b> though <b>print-runs</b> are increasingly smaller and returns increasingly larger. Intermediary agents operating under this model, for instance booksellers, are subject to ever-greater economic pressures, especially in the current crisis. On the other hand, digital publishing models are on the rise in Spain, at least partly as a result of digital projects by traditional publishers who are either digitalizing their catalogues or who are creating entirely new digital catalogues. However, within the rising digital sector, independent publishers have a significant share of the market. They have launched entirely new collections, use cloud-based business models and use sales and distribution systems fully in tune with a constantly-changing readership that increasingly values social networking and collaborative reading. In a rigorous and thorough study, the specificities of each of these models were studied and the consequences of each model for the future of electronic publishing in Spain were analyze...|$|R

Richard Hakluyt's Divers Voyages touching the Discovery of America, which the Society had intended for its inaugural publication, was postponed until 1850. Meanwhile, Sir Robert Schomburgk's edition of Ralegh's voyage to Guiana had appeared (1849), together with Cooley's Sir Francis Drake his Voyage (1849), Thomas Rundall's Voyages towards the North-West, and Major's Historie of Travaile into Virginia Britannia.

500|$|Bloomsbury {{accepted}} the book, paying Rowling a ¬£2,500 advance, and Cunningham sent proof copies to carefully chosen authors, critics and booksellers {{in order to}} obtain comments that could be quoted when the book was launched. He was less concerned about the book's length than about its author's name, since the title sounded like a boys' book to him, and he believed boys preferred books by male authors. Rowling therefore adopted the nom de plume J.K. Rowling just before publication. In June 1997, Bloomsbury published Philosopher's Stone with an initial <b>print-run</b> of 500 copies in hardback, three hundred of which were distributed to libraries. Her original name, [...] "Joanne Rowling", can be found in small print on the copyright page of this first British edition. (The 1998 first American edition would remove reference to [...] "Joanne" [...] completely.) The short initial print run was standard for first novels, and Cunningham hoped booksellers would read the book and recommend it to customers.

He initially worked as production director of Adprint, a business established by fellow Viennese √©migr√© Wolfgang Foges. Neurath and Foges went on to pioneer the concept of what is today known as book packaging, in which book ideas are conceived, commissioned, produced, and sold to publishers in different markets in their own languages and under their own imprints (co-editions) in order to create large <b>print-runs</b> and lower unit production costs. Neurath‚Äôs concept was the first sign of many innovations that through Thames & Hudson he would later introduce to the world of publishing.|$|R

At their Glastonbury property, which they called the Chalice Orchard, they established a guest house and a social centre which was open in the summer, and where lectures were also carried out. In October 1927 they began production of a magazine, The Inner Light, with the initial <b>print-run</b> of 500 selling out in a fortnight. The magazine gained a wide readership, with many subscribers located outside of Britain.

Progress through these degrees could be fairly rapid, with the only requirement being that an individual remain in one degree for at least three months before entering the next. Training in these three degrees was referred to as the 'Lesser Mysteries', allowing a practitioner to ascend into the 'Greater Mysteries'.
