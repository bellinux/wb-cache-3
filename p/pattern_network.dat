Many mobile applications recommend nearby restaurants, transportations or new places based on user's profile. However, considering the privacy protection, customers are less willing to provide detailed information, such as age, status, habits etc [...] Only moving trajectories may be accessible by telecom service providers. Mining in trajectories is one of strategies to understand customer's behaviors. Therefore, how to discover user's mobility patterns as well as making accurate mobility prediction become two critical issues for location based services. Moreover, trajectories that are updated frequently from massive people behave as streaming data, which require pattern mining and prediction algorithms to be efficient as well. In this thesis, we introduce our methods to conquer the above challenges. Our first work is to find atomic mobility patterns from trajectories. Since moving trajectory usually consists of many tandem repeats, the proposed pattern mining algorithm is able to perform repeating sub-sequence mining and tandem structure detection concurrently. With a pipeline framework, we can discover various patterns in an online manner. Next, we transform a location sequence to a novel pattern-based network by connecting all discovered patterns. The <b>pattern</b> <b>network</b> models user's historical movements from location level to pattern level, which not only provides a graph presentation for investigating user's mobility, but {{also serves as a}} mobility model for better prediction. Our <b>pattern</b> <b>network</b> model is trained by three steps including prediction, verification and weight propagation. Through online tunning the parameters of <b>pattern</b> <b>network,</b> user's next location can be predicted in real time. Finally, we focus on the mobility prediction of unusual behavior. The motivation is that many locations in our daily life are visited infrequently or only once. Usually, these locations are hard to be predicted successfully by traditional methods. We introduce the concept of mobility change, called Point of Change (POC), to describe people's new and unusual mobility behaviors. Our <b>pattern</b> <b>network</b> model is extended to include spatial-temporal information for learning and predicting possible POCs in a user's trajectory. In general, our experiments show that the <b>pattern</b> <b>network</b> model outperformed other Markov models on location prediction and unusual mobility prediction. Moreover, people's mobility behaviors can be further analyzed according to the structure of <b>pattern</b> <b>network.</b> Department of ComputingPh.

We prove that when a <b>pattern</b> <b>network</b> has at least two active edges, then the resulting network has an average distance at most logarithmic in the number of nodes. This suggests that real-world networks based on a similar growth mechanism are likely to have small average distance. We provide an estimate of the clustering coefficient and verify its accuracy using simulations. Using numerous examples of simple patterns, our simulations show various ways to generate small-world networks.

40|$|An {{important}} tool for analyzing metabolic pathways {{is being able}} to do homology searches, that is, for a given <b>pattern</b> <b>network</b> one would like to find occurrences of similar (sub) networks within a set of host networks. In the context of metabolic pathways, Pinter et al. [Bioinformatics, 2005] recently proposed to solve this computationally hard problem by restricting it to the case where both the pattern and host network are trees. This restriction, however, severely limits the applicability of their algorithm. Here, we propose a novel algorithm that does not restrict the topology of the host or <b>pattern</b> <b>network</b> in any way; instead, we exploit a natural property of metabolic networks that we call “local diversity property, ” which allows us to obtain a very fast and simple algorithm for the alignment of metabolic pathways. Experiments on a testbed of metabolic pathways extracted from the BIOCYC database indicate that our algorithm is much faster than the restricted algorithm of Pinter et al. and yet has a wider range of applicability and yields new biological insights. 1...|$|E

The general picture that emerges from these reports indicates that <b>patterned</b> <b>networks</b> with uniform connectivity do not exhibit unique activity patterns. Rather, their activity is very similar to that of unpatterned uniform networks. However, by breaking the connectivity homogeneity, using a modular architecture, it is possible to introduce pronounced topology-related gating and delay effects.

40|$|Abstract Background Localized <b>network</b> <b>patterns</b> {{are assumed}} to {{represent}} an optimal design principle in different biological networks. A widely used method for identifying functional components in biological networks is looking for network motifs – over-represented <b>network</b> <b>patterns.</b> A number of recent studies have undermined the claim that these over-represented patterns are indicative of optimal design principles and question whether localized <b>network</b> <b>patterns</b> are indeed of functional significance. This paper examines the functional significance of regulatory <b>network</b> <b>patterns</b> via their biological annotation and evolutionary conservation. Results We enumerate all 3 -node <b>network</b> <b>patterns</b> in the regulatory network of the yeast S. cerevisiae and examine the biological GO annotation and evolutionary conservation of their constituent genes. Specific 3 -node patterns {{are found to be}} functionally enriched in different exogenous cellular conditions and thus may represent significant functional components. These functionally enriched patterns are composed mainly of recently evolved genes suggesting that there is no evolutionary pressure acting to preserve such functionally enriched patterns. No correlation is found between over-representation of <b>network</b> <b>patterns</b> and functional enrichment. Conclusion The findings of functional enrichment support the view that <b>network</b> <b>patterns</b> constitute an important design principle in regulatory networks. However, the wildly used method of over-representation for detecting motifs is not suitable for identifying functionally enriched patterns. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — There {{exist in}} the {{literature}} today many contributions dealing with the incorporation of fuzzy logic in expert systems. However, unfortunately, much of what has been proposed can only be applied to small-scale expert systems; that is, when the number of rules is in the dozens as opposed to in the hundreds. The more traditional (nonfuzzy) expert systems are able to cope with large numbers of rules by using Rete networks for maintaining matches of all the rules and all the facts. (A Rete network obviates the need to match the rules with the facts on every cycle of the inference engine.) In this paper, we present a more general Rete network that is particularly suitable for reasoning with fuzzy logic. The generalized Rete network consists of a cascade of three networks: the <b>pattern</b> <b>network,</b> the join network, and the evidence aggregation network. The first two layers are modified versions of similar layers for the traditional Rete networks and the last, the aggregation layer, is a new concept that allows fuzzy evidence to be aggregated when fuzzy inferences are made about the same fuzzy variable by different rules.
