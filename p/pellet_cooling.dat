40|$|This master thesis uses process {{modelling}} to investigate energy efficiency {{measures in the}} grate-kiln process for iron ore production; specifically, how waste heat contained in flue gas could be recirculated {{in order to achieve}} a decrease in specific fuel consumption. Consequently, fossil carbon emissions would be reduced as the grate-kiln units are fired with coal or oil. The implementation of flue gas recirculation is simulated with a process model in EBSILON Professional 10. 0. Process concepts which make use of available waste heat are developed and their impact on fuel usage, pellet temperature profiles and the magnetite oxidation process is evaluated. Aside from partial flue gas recirculation, a heat recovery concept is investigated. Both concepts are applied to decrease the fuel consumption by increasing the temperature and oxidation on the grate and to recover heat at a high temperature. To minimize the effect of recirculation and heat recovery on the pellet heat treatment process, concepts that use intercooling before the grate are also evaluated. The implementation of heat recovery affects the performance of the pellet cooler. The cooler’s operation is studied in detail with a cooler model developed in MATLAB. The cooler model is evaluated, and a sensitivity analysis is made to determine which parameters have a crucial impact on the <b>pellet</b> <b>cooling.</b> The results indicate that waste heat utilization can reduce the fuel consumption by up to 30 % if a heat exchanger is used. It was revealed that increased temperature into the cooler’s hottest section elevates the temperature levels on the grate, which lowers the fuel usage. Direct flue gas recirculation lowers the oxygen content in the air passing the kiln and grate, which has a negative impact on the oxidation process and the overall heat balance. The cooler model showed that to maintain adequate <b>pellet</b> <b>cooling,</b> the mass flow through cooler zones C 3 and C 4 should be increased by 70 %, or the area of the C 3 and C 4 sections should be increased by 40 % when heat recovery is used. The direct flue gas recirculation concepts requires a 40 % and 25 % increase for the two measures, respectively. The thesis recommends three process designs, based on indirect heat recovery from the flue gases...|$|E

The ice water component of the mixture will expand 9% on freezing, so rubber, foam or foam lined casting materials work best to combat the water to ice expansion problem not encountered with wax, cement, casting plaster or metal casting materials.|$|R

The collected mango stones are washed with well-water soon after collection. After washing, the seeds are sun dried to reduce the moisture content to 12-15%. The dried seed stone is roasted in a drum roaster and the hull is removed mechanically, or manually by beating with wooden clubs. The separated kernels are crushed into small pieces in a hammer mill. The mango kernel pieces are conveyed to a pellet making machine and pellets are formed.

40|$|An {{economic}} {{analysis of a}} non-woody biomass pelleting process was performed for conditions in the Republic of Ireland. The analysis considered the establishment, harvest, storage and drying costs of the feedstock’s on-farm, together with transportation costs to the processing plant and {{the costs associated with}} the pelleting process. Capital and operating costs of the pelleting process were estimated at several plant capacities – 6 t / h, 8 t / h and 10 t / h. The pellet production cost for the base case scenario of 8 t / h was 102 / t of pellets produced. By decreasing production capacity to 6 t / h an increase in the production cost of 10 / t was experienced while increasing capacity to 10 t / h resulted in a decrease of 6 / t in the production cost of pellets. The cost of the raw material is the largest cost component (66 %) of the total pellet production cost. Other major cost factors include <b>pelleting</b> and <b>cooling</b> plant (11 %), straw grinding plant (10 %) and personnel costs (9 %). Considering current energy prices the equivalent energy cost of 7 / GJ (excluding profit margins) the potential production of non-woody biomass pellets competes favourably with oil and gas and was found to be economically viable...|$|R
40|$|Prompt runaway {{electron}} bursts, generated by rapidly cooling DIII-D plasmas with argon killer pellets, {{are used to}} test a recent knock-on avalanche theory describing the growth of multi-MeV {{runaway electron}} currents during disruptions in tokamaks. Runaway current amplitudes, observed during some but not all DIII-D current quenches, are consistent with growth rates predicted by the theory assuming a pre-current quench runaway electron density of approximately 10 {sup 15 } m{sup {minus} 3 }. Argon killer pellet modeling yields runaway densities of between 10 {sup 15 } [...] 10 {sup 16 } m{sup {minus} 3 } in these discharges.

40|$|Swine Industry Day, 2014 {{is known}} as Swine Day, 2014 A 3 -wk study was {{conducted}} at a commercial feed mill in northwest Iowa to determine where the formation of fines occurs during pelleted feed manufacturing and if differences are present in nutrient composition between fines and pellets. During the study, 1, 781 pelleted feed samples were collected from 4 swine and 2 turkey diets. Samples were collected from 4 different locations throughout the mill to determine progression of fines formation during the manufacturing process. These locations included the <b>pellet</b> mill, <b>pellet</b> <b>cooler,</b> fat coater, and at load-out. Samples were taken on 7 to 10 different runs for each diet throughout the 3 -wk period. Pellet durability index (PDI) and percentage fines were determined for all samples, and nutrient analysis was determined on a pooled sample from each run within diet. Nutrient analysis was determined via near-infrared spectroscopy (NIR) at the processing site and via wet chemistry at a commercial lab. Overall, PDI was different (P < 0. 05) between locations in the mill. Pellet durability index increased from the pellet mill to the fat coater but then decreased between the fat coater and load-out. The largest increase in PDI was seen between the cooler and fat coater. Percentage fines decreased (P < 0. 05) from the pellet mill to the cooler, but then increased as pellets went to the fat coater and then to load-out. The largest increase in fines {{was found between the}} cooler and fat coater and between the fat coater and loadout (5. 6 and 6. 5 %). Dry matter and crude fiber were greater (P < 0. 05) and fat tended to be greater (P < 0. 08) in fines than in pellets as determined by NIR, whereas CP was significantly lower (P < 0. 05) in the fines than in pellets. These differences were verified by wet chemistry results. Wet chemistry also found that fines tended to be higher (P < 0. 05) in ADF, but fines were similar in Ca and P compared with pellets. In conclusion, fines increased as pellets were moved from the pellet mill to the load-out area. Pellet durability index improved from the pellet mill to the fat coater due to the removal of moisture in the pellet but then worsened at load-out, most likely due to the addition of fat, which may have started to soften the pellets. Both NIR and wet chemistry found that fines were higher in fiber and fat but lower in CP than pellets. These differences in nutrient content of the pellets compared with fines and the possibility of fines refusal at the feeder may lead to poorer pig performance. More {{research is needed to determine}} if fines formation can be reduced in the mill and if differences in nutrient composition of fines compared with pellets could lead to performance differences in pigs...|$|R

This paper suggests a method to ensure pellets moisture optimization and process energy saving. An experimental testbed was arranged in order to validate the performance of the proposed strategy. It is based on a closed-loop control system that regulates material moisture and flow rate, but its robustness is affected by the control-loop delay (the actuator delay is about 10 minutes) and by the random arrangement of the <b>pellets</b> inside the <b>cooler</b> that strongly affects product moisture (the measurement errors are not negligible). To overcome those problems, a robust statistical approach was adopted to reach the best trade-off between estimation accuracy and computational effort. It was derived by the well-known Random Close Packing model and statistical estimator. Experimental results prove the effectiveness of the proposed approach that provides moisture errors less than 7. 2...|$|R

As {{part of this}} recent knowledge preservation effort, improved documentation of the sample preparation and electrical testing procedures for lead magnesium niobate [...] lead titanate (PMN/PT) qualification pellets was completed. The qualification pellets are fabricated from the same parent powders used to produce PMN/PT lightning arrestor connector (LAC) granules at HWF&T. In our report, the procedures for fired pellet surface preparation, electrode deposition, electrical testing and data recording are described. The dielectric measurements described in our report are an information only test. Technical reasons for selecting the electrode material, electrode size and geometry are presented. The electrical testing is based on measuring the dielectric constant and dissipation factor of the <b>pellet</b> during <b>cooling</b> from 280 C to 220 C. The most important data are the temperature for which the peak dielectric constant occurs (Curie Point temperature) and the peak dielectric constant magnitude. We determined that the peak dielectric constant for our procedure would be that measured at 1 kHz at the Curie Point. Both the peak dielectric constant and the Curie point parameters provide semi-quantitative information concerning the chemical and microstructural homogeneity of the parent material used {{for the production of}} PMN/PT granules for LACs. Finally, we have proposed flag limits for the dielectric data for the pellets. Specifically, if the temperature of the peak dielectric constant falls outside the range of 250 C {+-} 30 C we propose that a flag limit be imposed that will initiate communication between production agency and design agency personnel. If the peak dielectric constant measured falls outside the range 25, 000 {+-} 10, 000 we also propose that a flag limit be imposed...|$|R
40|$|Cladding {{failure is}} one of the major {{considerations}} in analysis of fuel-pin behavior during hypothetical accident transients since time, location, and nature of failure govern the early post-failure material motion and reactivity feedback. Out-of-pile thermal transient tests of both irradiated and unirradiated fast-reactor cladding show that local plastic instability, or bulging, often precedes rupture and that the extent of local instability limits the initial rip length. To investigate the details of bulge formation and growth, a perturbation analysis of the equations governing large deformation of a cylindrical shell has been developed, resulting in a set of linear differential equations for the bulge geometry. These equations have been solved along with appropriate constitutive equations and various constraints on the ends of the cladding. Sources for bulge formation that have been considered include initial geometric imperfections and thermal perturbations due to either eccentric fuel <b>pellets</b> or non-symmetric <b>cooling.</b> Of these, only the first is relevant to out-of-pile burst tests. Here it has been found that the most likely imperfection that will grow unstably to failure leads to a bulge around half the circumference with an axial length 1. 1 times the deformed diameter. This is in general agreement with burst-test results. For the case of in-reactor fuel pins, it has been found that thermal perturbations can significantly affect local instability, particularly if the deformation process is thermally activated with a high activation energy...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} in this thesis covers the design and implementation of a depleted uranium (DU) powder production system and the initial results of a DU-Zr-Mg alloy alpha phase sintering experiment where the Mg is a surrogate for Pu and Am. The powder production system utilized the uranium hydrogen interaction in order to break down larger pieces of uranium into fine powder. After several iterations, a successful reusable system was built. The nominal size of the powder product was {{on the order of}} 1 to 3 mm. The resulting uranium powder was pressed into pellets of various compositions (DU, DU- 10 Zr, DU-Mg, DU- 10 Zr-Mg) and heated to approximately 650 ?C, just below the alphabeta phase transition of uranium. The dimensions of the pellets were measured before and after heating and in situ dimension changes were measured using a linear variable differential transducer (LVDT). Post experiment measurement of the pellets proved to be an unreliable indicator of sintering do the cracking of the <b>pellets</b> during <b>cool</b> down. The cracking caused increases in the diameter and height of the samples. The cracks occurred in greater frequency along the edges of the pellets. All of the pellets, except the DU- 10 Zr-Mg pellet, were slightly conical in shape. This is believed to be an artifact of the powder pressing procedure. A greater density occurs {{on one end of the}} pellet during pressing and thus leads to gradient in the sinter rate of the pellet. The LVDT measurements proved to be extremely sensitive to outside vibration, making a subset of the data inappropriate for analysis. The pellets were also analyzed using electron microscopy. All pellets showed signs of sintering and an increase in density. The pellets will the greatest densification and lowest porosity were the DU-Mg and DU- 10 Zr-Mg. The DU-Mg pellet had a porosity of 14 +or- 2. %. The DU- 10 Zr-Mg porosity could not be conclusively determined due to lack of clearly visible pores in the image, however there were very few pores indicating a high degree of sintering. In the DU- 10 Zr-Mg alloy, large grains of DU were surrounded by Zr. This phenomena was not present in the DU- 10 Zr pellet where the Zr and DU stayed segregated. There was no indication of alloying between the Zr and DU in pellets...|$|R
40|$|Disruptions are {{dangerous}} instabilities in tokamaks {{that should be}} avoided or mitigated. One possible disruption mitigation method is to inject impurities into the plasma to shut it down in a controlled way. Runaway Electrons (REs) can be generated after the plasma is cooled down by the impurities and these electrons can damage the tokamak. In this work a simulation code is developed to investigate different disruption mitigation scenarios. The response of the bulk plasma, more precisely the temperature evolution of electrons, deuterium and impurity ions are described by energy balance equations in a 1 D cylindrical plasma model. The induction and resistive diffusion of electric field is calculated. RE generation rates are {{used to calculate the}} runaway current. The Dreicer, hot-tail and avalanche effect is taken into account and a simple model for RE losses is also included. RE generation is studied in JET-like plasmas during pellet injection. Carbon <b>pellets</b> cause effective <b>cooling</b> but these scenarios are prone to runaway generation. A mixture of argon and deuterium gas could be used for safe shutdown without RE generation. In ITER the hot-tail RE generation process becomes important, and the simulation is therefore extended to take this into account. Shutdown scenarios with different concentration of neon and argon impurities were tested in ITER-like plasmas. To simplify the problem the impurity injection into the plasma is not modeled in these cases, only the response of the bulk plasma. The avalanche process cannot be suppressed in a simple way and would produce high runaway current. It can be avoided if some runaway loss phenomenon is included in the simulations, like diffusion due to magnetic perturbations...|$|R
40|$|Transportation {{costs can}} be a {{prohibitive}} step in bringing biomass to a preprocessing location or biofuel refinery. One alternative to transporting biomass in baled or loose format to a preprocessing location, is to utilize a mobile preprocessing system that can be relocated to various locations where biomass is stored, preprocess and densify the biomass, then ship it to the refinery as needed. The Idaho National Laboratory has a full scale 'Process Demonstration Unit' PDU which includes a stage 1 grinder, hammer mill, drier, <b>pellet</b> mill, and <b>cooler</b> with the associated conveyance system components. Testing at bench and pilot scale has been conducted to determine effects of moisture on preprocessing, crop varieties on preprocessing efficiency and product quality. The INLs PDU provides an opportunity to test the conclusions made at the bench and pilot scale on full industrial scale systems. Each component of the PDU is operated from a central operating station where data is collected to determine power consumption rates for each step in the process. The power for each electrical motor in the system is monitored from the control station to monitor for problems and determine optimal conditions for the system performance. The data can then be viewed to observe how changes in biomass input parameters (moisture and crop type for example), mechanical changes (screen size, biomass drying, pellet size, grinding speed, etc.,), or other variations effect the power consumption of the system. Sorgum in four foot round bales was tested in the system using a series of 6 different screen sizes including: 3 / 16 in., 1 in., 2 in., 3 in., 4 in., and 6 in.

40|$|Wood pellet {{production}} in the southern United States {{has more than doubled}} in the past three years, surpassing western Canada as the region in North America with the greatest production. Most of this increase is caused by a few large plants being built specifically for export to Europe where the pellets are burned for electricity. The economics for producers in the region are helped by the decline in manufacture of traditional wood products including structural panels, lumber, and pulp and paper. Demand for wood pellets is set to continue its rapid rise though some of the traditional wood products are also set to rebound. Of concern for pellet producers is both U. S. made pellets? future position in the world energy market as well as their place in the fiber market of the southern United States. In addition, when pellets are stored in large volumes, there is a heating effect. This effect is exacerbated by a hot and humid subtropical climate as well as the feedstock of choice of large producers (Southern Yellow Pine). This heating can cause great expense to producers who are shipping overseas as bulk carriers and European buyers usually have a threshold temperature for biological materials shipped overseas. In addition, this heating often exacerbates convection currents and water deposition inside storage piles before loading. This water can quickly degrade pellets. The first chapter of this thesis looks at the pellet markets worldwide as well as the state of the wood fiber markets in the southern U. S. which made it possible for wood pellet production to get a foothold in the region. It is concluded that use of wood pellets worldwide will grow, with most growth localized in northern Europe and North America. Production in the Southeast will continue to expand, taking much of the fiber that would have been taken by the now shrinking pulp and paper industries though also utilizing residues from sawmilling and possibly harvest residues. The second chapter is a factorial analysis in which production factors such as drying temperature and aging are varied between different production runs at the plant of a large wood pellet producer. Quality attributes such as bulk density, durability, and moisture content of pellets going into storage were also monitored. It was then assessed whether these factors had any effect on the temperatures attained in storage. It was found that the most significant factor in the self heating of pellets was the starting temperature of pellets. Therefore, wood pellet producers may do well by investing in consistent and effective methods of <b>cooling</b> <b>pellets</b> after the production runs. Drying temperature also seemed to have a negative correlation to temperature increase though more research is needed as to whether this effect remains when controlling for start temperature...|$|R
40|$|Iron {{is usually}} {{produced}} from its ores using coke in a blast furnace (BF). Coke, a hard and macroporous carbon material, is produced from special coals (coking coals) and acts as fuel, smelting agent, and the permeable {{support for the}} charge to the BF. No material can completely replace coke in a BF. Coking coals are becoming harder (and more expensive) to obtain. Victorian brown coal (VBC) is accessible, cheap, with low mineral concentrations, which is favourable for iron production in a BF. However, as-mined, it does not form coke, but a char which is too reactive {{to be used in}} a BF. The objective of this project is to produce a substitute for BF coke from VBC by physical and chemical treatments and to investigate the use of cementing agents to reduce the reactivity and strengthen the product finally formed. VBC from Loy Yang open cut, and its commercial products, briquettes and char, which were obtained from Australian Char Pty Ltd in lump form, were used as starting materials. VBC tar, coking coal tar pitch, and asphaltene (hexane insolubles from VBC tar) were used as binders. Some of the starting material was pre-treated by acid washing (0. 5 M H₂SO₄), hydrothermal dewatering (HTD; 320 °C- 35 min) or alkali treatment (KOH (aq), 185 °C- 10 h). The elemental analysis and NMR of these materials were determined. Before pelleting, raw VBC, pre-treated VBC, or briquettes were dried at 105 °C under N₂, ground to < 0. 15 mm, then mixed with the binder in tetrahydrofuran (THF). THF was removed and the mixture was pelleted by a conventional hydraulic press at ambient temperature or using an INSTRON 5569 series Mechanical Tester applying a range of forces, temperatures and times. Some samples were pelleted under N₂ (350 °C- 30 min) by “Hot Press Carbonization” (HPC). In some cases, samples were air cured at 200 °C for 2 h. Finally, the samples were carbonised at a range of temperatures and times under N₂ flow, at a low heating rate to minimise cracking of the <b>pellet,</b> then <b>cooled</b> under N₂. The measurements used to evaluate the suitability of the products as substitutes for BF coke were compressive strength and reactivity. The compressive strengths of pellets were measured by using an INSTRON 5569 series Mechanical Tester. Reactivity was measured using a thermogravimetric balance. The sample was heated to 1000 °C at 20 °C /min under N 2 and held at 1000 °C for 1 h in a flow (70 ml/min) of 1 : 1 CO₂:N₂. The reactivity, R 60 CO₂, was calculated from the weight loss. Physical properties of the products were measured in order to understand what factors controlled the compressive strength and reactivity. Initially, VBC or commercial briquettes were impregnated with tar, pelleted at ambient temperature and carbonized. Products from VBC showed higher compressive strengths (40 - 60 MPa) and slightly lower reactivity (R 60 CO₂ 87 - 89 %) and surface areas (790 - 800 m²/g) than those from briquettes. The effects of carbonization time, temperature (900 or 950 °C) and tar addition were relatively small. The high reactivity of the samples compared to that of coke (R 60 CO₂ 13 %) is probably related to their higher surface areas and the smaller extent and greater disorder of their graphitic structure as shown by XRD. The poor results of ambient pelleting and recent literature suggested that hot pelleting of VBC would be advantageous. Therefore, VBC-tar mixture was hot pelleted (150 °C- 20 kN for 10 or 30 min), optionally air cured then carbonized (950 °C for 3 h). Products showed higher compressive strength (90 - 200 MPa) and bulk density (1. 17 - 1. 27 g/cm³) than those obtained following ambient pelleting. A high concentration of tar (10 - 15 wt%) and air curing increased the compressive strength by a further factor of two. The compressive strength was higher than that of a BF coke (20 MPa), but the surface area remained high and the surface was rough (SEM) and the proportion of graphitic structure was small (Raman spectroscopy). These factors probably contributed to the high reactivity of even the strongest products. VBC treated by HTD resembles a higher rank coal (e. g. lower O content), suggesting that HTD coal might carbonize to a less reactive product, like a higher rank coal. HTD treatment reduced the reactivity of the carbonization products, without an unacceptable lowering of the compressive strength. More severe briquetting conditions, acid washing before HTD, air curing and severe carbonization conditions (1200 °C- 8 h) all together reduced the reactivity to R 60 CO₂ 34 %, still much higher than that of a BF coke. The surface area was reduced, but only to 100 m²/g, (cf. 18 m 2 /g for BF coke) and the proportion of graphitic structure was smaller than in BF coke, so that the higher reactivity may be due to these structural factors. Alkali treated VBC (ATC) appears to melt and fuse upon carbonization, like a coking coal, suggesting that carbonised product might be similar to a BF coke. The ATC with pitch and air curing had a high compressive strength (up to 230 MPa) after carbonization (1200 - 1300 °C for 2 - 8 h). The small surface area (as low as 20 m³/g) and smooth surface (SEM) of the products under some conditions suggests that fusion occurred during carbonization. However, the proportion of graphitic structure (Raman and TEM) was lower than for a BF coke and the reactivity of the carbonized products did not fall below R 60 CO₂ 30 %. Possibly the alkali treatment changed the chemical structure and inhibited graphitisation. Suitable pore structure is necessary for low reactivity, but the chemical structure is also important. Empirical treatments, modifying the structure of brown coal in the direction of higher rank coals, give carbonised products which approach BF coke in reactivity, surface area and the proportion of graphitic structure while maintaining compressive strength...|$|R
40|$|Future human {{exploration}} {{of the solar system}} is likely to include establishing permanent outposts {{on the surface of the}} Moon. These outposts will require reliable sources of electrical power in the range of 10 's to 100 's of kWe to support exploration and resource utilization activities. This need is best met using nuclear reactor power systems which can operate steadily throughout the long ~ 27. 3 day lunar rotational period, irrespective of location. Nuclear power systems can potentially open up the entire lunar surface for future exploration and development. Desirable features of nuclear power systems for the lunar surface include passive operation, the avoidance of single point failures in reactor cooling and the integrated power system, moderate operating temperatures to enable the use of conventional materials with proven irradiation experience, utilization of the lunar regolith for radiation shielding and as a supplemental neutron reflector, and safe post-operation decay heat removal and storage for potential retrieval. In addition, it is desirable for the reactor to have a long operational life. Only a limited number of space nuclear reactor concepts have previously been developed for the lunar environment, and these designs possess only a few of these desirable design and operation features. The objective of this research is therefore to perform design and analyses of long operational life lunar reactors and power systems which incorporate the desirable features listed above. A long reactor operational life could be achieved either by increasing the amount of highly enriched uranium (HEU) fuel in the core or by improving the neutron economy in the reactor through reducing neutron leakage and parasitic absorption. The amount of fuel in surface power reactors is constrained by the launch safety requirements. These include ensuring that the bare reactor core remains safely subcritical when submerged in water or wet sand and flooded with seawater in the unlikely event of a launch abort accident. Increasing the amount of fuel in the reactor core, and hence its operational life, would be possible by launching the reactor unfueled and fueling it on the Moon. Such a reactor would, thus, not be subject to launch criticality safety requirements. However, loading the reactor with fuel on the Moon presents a challenge, requiring special designs of the core and the fuel elements, which lend themselves to fueling on the lunar surface. This research investigates examples of both a solid core reactor that would be fueled at launch as well as an advanced concept which could be fueled on the Moon. Increasing the operational life of a reactor fueled at launch is exercised for the NaK- 78 cooled Sectored Compact Reactor (SCoRe). A multi-physics design and analyses methodology is developed which iteratively couples together detailed Monte Carlo neutronics simulations with 3 -D Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and thermal-hydraulics analyses. Using this methodology the operational life of this compact, fast spectrum reactor is increased by reconfiguring the core geometry to reduce neutron leakage and parasitic absorption, for the same amount of HEU in the core, and meeting launch safety requirements. The multi-physics analyses determine the impacts of the various design changes on the reactor’s neutronics and thermal-hydraulics performance. The option of increasing the operational life of a reactor by loading it on the Moon is exercised for the Pellet Bed Reactor (PeBR). The PeBR uses spherical fuel <b>pellets</b> and is <b>cooled</b> by He-Xe gas, allowing the reactor core to be loaded with fuel pellets and charged with working fluid on the lunar surface. The performed neutronics analyses ensure the PeBR design achieves a long operational life, and develops safe launch canister designs to transport the spherical fuel pellets to the lunar surface. The research also investigates loading the PeBR core with fuel pellets on the Moon using a transient Discrete Element Method (DEM) analysis in lunar gravity. In addition, this research addresses the post-operation storage of the SCoRe and PeBR concepts, below the lunar surface, to determine the time required for the radioactivity in the used fuel to decrease to a low level to allow for its safe recovery. The SCoRe and PeBR concepts are designed to operate at coolant temperatures ≤ 900 K and use conventional stainless steels and superalloys for the structure in the reactor core and power system. They are emplaced below grade on the Moon to take advantage of the regolith as a supplemental neutron reflector and as shielding of the lunar outpost from the reactors’ neutron and gamma radiation. The SCoRe and PeBR concepts are designed with cores divided into six and three sectors, respectively. The sectors are thermally and neutronically coupled but hydraulically decoupled. Each sector is served by a separate cooling loop(s), with independent energy conversion and heat rejection radiator panels. This combination of a sectored core and power system integration with multiple loops avoids single point failures in reactor cooling, energy conversion, and heat rejection. These unique attributes would allow the reactor power system to continue operation, but at lower power, in the event one of the sectors experiences a Loss of Coolant (LOC) or a Loss of Cooling (LOCo). The power system could thus maintain a vital supply of electrical power to the lunar outpost for crew life support. The performed multi-physics design and performance analyses of the SCoRe show that increasing the diameter of the UN fuel rods increases the core excess reactivity. The larger diameter rods, however, increase the NaK- 78 coolant flow bypass near the walls of the core sectors. Scalloping the dividing walls of the core sectors produces a more even flow distribution. The use of 151 Eu spectral neutron poison additive to the UN fuel ensures subcriticality during a water submersion accident, for the compact SCoRe core, with the highest excess reactivity and lowest mass. The redesigned Solid-Core Sectored Compact Reactor (SC-SCoRe) with a monolithic solid core of Oxide Dispersion Strengthened Molybdenum (ODS-Mo) achieves a long operational life of 21 years at a nominal power of 1, 000 kWth. The high thermal conductivity ODS-Mo core structure allows the reactor to continue safe operation in the event that one of the core sectors experiences a LOC of LOCo. The ODS-Mo solid core readily conducts heat generated in that sector to the adjacent core sectors, to be removed by the flowing liquid metal coolant. The SCoRe power system with SiGe energy conversion is fully passive and load following. In addition, the decay heat is removed safely and passively following shutdown of the reactor at end of life. Neutronics and analyses show that the PeBR can achieve a very operational life of 66 years at a nominal thermal power of 471 kWth by fueling the reactor core on the Moon. This full power operational life is beyond what is possible with a reactor fueled at launch like the SC-SCoRe. Neutronics safety analysis of the fuel pellets transport canisters for the PeBR shows that they are made highly subcritical in a water submersion accident. This is achieved using a combination of favorable geometry and neutron absorbers. The DEM fuel loading simulation of the PeBR on the lunar surface demonstrates that the PeBR core sectors can be successfully fueled in lunar gravity. Post-operation storage analyses of the SC-SCoRe and PeBR concepts show that the radioactivity in the fuel decays away to a sufficiently low level within 300 years. The radiation field around the post-operational reactor at that time is low enough to allow humans to safely handle and retrieve the cores, for potential recovery of the valuable quantities of 235 U remaining in the fuel.

40|$| {{that are}} being {{passaged}} are unable {{to adjust to the}} pH of the medium for an amount of time prior to attachment and re-initiation of metabolic activity. The passage time is a particularly critical period that can be achieved by prewarming the flask that contains growth medium in a CO 2 incubator or aseptically gassing each flask with 5 % CO 2. - Mitomycin-C should be stored in the dark since it is readily decomposed by light. - Caution: i. Appropriate protection must be done while working with mitomycin-c. Wearing suitable protection is recommended. - Mounting media - Slides are mounted in PBS/glycerol (1 : 1). - Caution: First, check components for auto fluorescence. Residual auto fluorescent mounting medium can be removed by the offset of imaging software. Once aqueous mounting media is made, it should be stored in small (10 - 30 ml) screw-capped bottles or vials made of transparent glass or plastic. - Preparation of thymidine - ii. Dissolve 0. 1816 g of thymidine powder in 10 ml PBS to give a 75 mM thymidine solution (stock solution). - iii. Add 100 µl of stock solution to 3 ml of culture medium (final thymidine concentration is 2. 5 mM). ### Procedure mESC culture medium preparation: General culture conditions are well established 11 and usually require ES (embryonic stem) cells to be grown on a Mit-C (M 0503; Sigma, Germany) treated mitotically-inactive mouse embryonic fibroblast cells (mEF) as feeder cell layer in a gelatin (G 2500; Sigma) -coated tissue culture flask (90025; TPP) [Fig. 1]. mESC line RB 1 12 maintained in ES cell medium consisted of Knockout-DMEM (10829 - 018; Gibco, UK) supplemented with 15 % ES-qualified FCS (10439 - 024; Gibco), 2 mM L-glutamine (15039 - 027; Gibco), 0. 1 mM 2 -mercaptoethanol (M 7522; Sigma), 1 % nonessential amino acid stock (11140 - 035; Gibco), 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 µg/ml streptomycin (15070 - 063; Gibco). Tip: Mouse embryonic fibroblast cells (mEF) are used in co-cultures to provide secreted factors (paracrine element), extracellular matrix (juxtacrine signaling) and cellular contacts for the maintenance of stem cells in an undifferentiated state without losing their pluripotency. Thus, they are also called feeder cells. Subculture of the cells - i. Prewarm all reagents. - ii. Aspirate all medium from the culture vessel. - iii. Rinse the culture twice with 2 ml PBS-, gently rock the vessel for 30 sec and remove the buffer to dispose of all traces of medium containing FBS. - iv. Add the appropriate amount of trypsin to each flask to cover the entire surface of the flask. Incubate the culture at room temperature for approximately 1 minute. Rock the flask for 4 - 5 times quickly back and forth such that the trypsin coats the cells. After 1 minute incubation, wash the culture vigorously by pipetting the trypsin solution up and down over the cells such that the small amount of fluid in the flask shears the loosely attached cells off and dissociates the clumps. - v. Inactive the trypsin by adding fresh, complete medium. Be sure to triturate thoroughly to achieve a single cell suspension before inactivating. Replate as desired. Synchronization protocol for mESCs - i. Add 2 mM thymidine for 16 hours at 25 - 30 % confluency of the stem cell culture. - ii. Remove thymidine by washing with 1 x PBS. Add fresh KO-DMEM complete medium for 4 hours to release cells. Cells progress synchronously through the G 2 - and mitotic phases. Hypotonization Based on criteria by Fenech 13 for the selection of bi-nucleate cells suitable for scoring MNi, a bi-nucleate cell can be scored only if the nuclear boundaries of each nucleus are distinguishable. In addition, the cytoplasmic membrane of bi-nucleated cells must be intact and clearly distinct from adjacent cells. Thus, it is important that mESCs harvested properly without any damage to the cytoplasmic membrane. Micronucleus assay in isolated lymphocyte or cell lines culture does not require hypotonic treatment during harvesting. Hypotonic treatment may destroy necrotic and apoptotic cells, making them unavailable for assay 13. On the other hand, mESCs have a large nucleus surrounded by a narrow rim of cytoplasm. According to the all above items mentioned it seems the hypotonic treatment of mESCs is necessary and cannot be omitted. Harvest & slide making - i. Treat ES cells grown on mEF with 4 µg/ml cyt-B (c- 6762; Sigma) for 14 hours. - ii. Trypsinize the cells and spin them down at 800 g for 6 minutes. - iii. Resuspend the cell pellet gently by tapping the tube. Add about 4 ml of hypotonic solution. - iv. After a 10 minute incubation at room temperature, spin down the cells again and fix the <b>pellet</b> with <b>cool</b> Carnoy`s fixative (methanol: acetic acid; 3 : 1) for 15 minutes at room temperature. Disperse cells before the addition of fixative. - v. Change the fixative twice. - vi. Drop the suspension on wet slides previously cleaned with ethanol. - vii. Air-dry the slides. Stain with Hoechst 33258 (Calbiochem; 382061) and rhodamin B (Sigma; R 6626). - viii. Examine slides under a microscope equipped with fluorescent optic (Olympus Bx 51). Cells are scored blindly for MN presence. In our study, the frequency was expressed as number of MNi per one bi-nucleated cell (mean± SD). Critical: Do not air-dry slides for longer than 10 minutes, otherwise cell and molecular morphology become altered, it makes difficult to score the slides. Store the slides in a microscope slide box in a cool, dry and dust-free cupboard. Scoring: We examined one thousand bi-nucleated cells to measure MN formation in each slide prepared per sample (treated and control). For more details, we followed the Fenech 13. Pause point: Fluorescent stained slides can be stored at 4 ºC for 1 month. Criteria of micronuclei screening MNi are morphologically identical to, but smaller than nuclei and have the following characteristics: - (a) The diameter of MNi in human lymphocytes usually varies between 1 / 16 and 1 / 3 of the mean diameter of the main nuclei, which is corresponded to 1 / 256 and 1 / 9 of the main nuclei area in a BN cell, respectively. - (b) MNi are non-refractile and therefore, can be readily distinguished from artifacts such as staining particles. - (c) MNi are not linked or connected to the main nuclei. - (d) MNi may touch but not overlap the main nuclei. The micronuclear boundary should be distinguishable from the nuclear boundary. - (e) MNi usually have the same staining intensity as the main nuclei [Fig. 2], but occasionally their staining may be more intense 13 (For review see Fenech, 2007). Statistical analysis: We used the t-test to evaluate MN formation induced by genotoxic agents. ### Timing - Monday (8 am- 8 pm); during this period mESCs seeded on mEF and make small colonies. - Monday-Tuesday (8 pm- 12 am); inoculate thymidine to each flask and incubate for 16 h to achieve synchronized mESCs. - Tuesday (12 am- 4 pm); Wash to release from the thymidine block and incubate for 4 hours with fresh medium. - Tuesday-Wednesday (4 pm- 8 am) in which cells are cultured for 14 h in media containing Cyt-B. - Note: Cells that suffer any type of cytotoxic and genotoxic shock may go into cell cycle arrest, thus bi-nucleate cells become less than expected. It must be borne in mind that after any treatment, the cell cycle becomes longer than before. ### Troubleshooting - Screening criteria - To keep mESCs growing with maintenance of differentiation potency, they definitely need to grow on a feeder layer (mitotically inactivated mEF). Therefore, at the time of screening the slides, how should one distinguish between mESCs and feeder cells? - There is a tremendous difference between the nuclei of these two cell types that cannot be overlooked. The nuclei of mESCs are smaller than fibroblastic cells and are round, too. Feeder cells have oval nuclei which are sometimes fragmented. The ratio of nucleus to cytoplasm in mESCs is larger than feeder cells. - At the time of feeder layer preparation from fibroblastic cells, they must become mitotically inactivated by mitomycin-c treatment or gamma irradiation; therefore these cells do not undergo further proliferation. During screening, there will not be any telophasic mEF cells in prepared slides, thus all the bi-nucleated cells are stem cells. - Slides crowded with cells that clumped - Excessive amount of cell suspension was used. - Dilute the cell suspension with additional fixative. - Cell pellet was not dispersed before the addition of fixative. - Loosen final cell pellet vigorously either before or just after addition of fixative. - Too few/no bi-nucleated cells; - Thymidine was inadequately removed. - Continue washing cells with fresh medium. - Cell Lysis was occurred during fixation steps. - Do not vortex or vigorously shake the cell pellet in fixative. - The Cells progressed through telophase. - Increase cytochalasin-B concentration or incubation time. - Cells membrane lysis occurred. - Do not vortex or vigorously shake the cell pellets during fixation steps. Re-suspend the cells gently by tapping the tube. - Add cool fixative drop wise during first fixation step. - Micronucleus boundary is overlapped with the nuclear boundary; - Cells were insufficiently swollen. - Check the KCl hypotonic solution. Increase the time/temperature of incubation in hypotonic solution. - Existence of three or more nucleated cells; - The time of incubation with cyt-B was too long. - Adjust the culture time until bi-nucleated cells appear. ### Anticipated Results The cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay (CBMn) is a reliable and relatively easy method used for many years by scientists for biological assessments. Relative accuracy, simplicity, multi-potentiality, large tissue applicability of CBMn assay technology and its potency to become automated have made it a fascinating technology during last decades and will {{play a key role in}} mutagenicity assessment in the future. This technique is mostly used for lymphocytes and it has been not provided for embryonic stem cells study. In our study, routine CBMn led to unacceptable, substandard, unexplainable results. Although the entire process was based on the standard methods, however most of the mESCs population underwent DNA fragmentation [Fig. 3]! To avoid occurrence of this problem, factors that might contribute to DNA fragmentation of mESCs in some circumstances such as attachment factors 14 - 16, LIF concentration 17, cyt-B concentration 18, 19 were considered, however no significant effect were found. It has been showed that incubation of mESCs with cytochalasin-B (an anti-actin drug) caused marked alterations in cell shape and cytoskeletal organization 19. We observed same results in our study, that after treatment of mESCs colonies with Cyt-B, the cell attachment to each other and feeder layer (mEF) were essentially reduced, cells rounded up, and consequently cells were disaggregated. It has been postulated that single cell suspensions of mESCs lead to leakage oxidative phosphorilation components from mitochondria, these cells finally become committed to apoptosis, whereas this process was suppressed when they proliferated in aggregates 20. According to above descriptions, modification of the timing of the standard protocol of CBMn assay for mESCs is the best way to solve this problem because reducing the incubation time, decrease the chance of detachment of cells from substrate. Tauchi et al. showed that the best time for apoptosis analysis is 16 hours after treatment with toxic agents when there is a raise in the apoptosis rate and approximately most of the apoptotic cells are in the late stage of apoptosis 21. We have observed the same outcome in mESCs (Results not showed). ...|$|R
