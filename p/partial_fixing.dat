40|$|In {{satellite}} navigation, {{the key to}} {{high precision}} is {{to make use of}} the carrier-phase measurements. The periodicity of the carrier-phase, however, leads to integer ambiguities. Often, resolving the full set of ambiguities cannot be accomplished for a given reliability constraint. In that case, it can be useful to resolve a subset of ambiguities. The selection of the subset should be based not only on the stochastic system model but also on the actual measurements from the tracking loops. This paper presents a solution to the problem of joint subset selection and ambiguity resolution. The proposed method can be interpreted as a generalized version of the class of integer aperture estimators. Two specific realizations of this new class of estimators are presented, based on different acceptance tests. Their computation requires only a single tree search, and can be efficiently implemented, e. g., in the framework of the well-known LAMBDA method. Numerical simulations with double difference measurements based on Galileo E 1 signals are used to evaluate the performance of the introduced estimation schemes under a given reliability constraint. The results show a clear gain of <b>partial</b> <b>fixing</b> in terms of the probability of correct ambiguity resolution, leading to improved baseline estimates...|$|E

Efficiency is determined by measuring the investment, such as the monetary and biological cost, against what is gained, such as functional restoration and durability. If one's goal is to save tooth tissue in the restorative process, it is interesting to compare the conventional <b>fixed</b> <b>partial</b> denture with the adhesive <b>fixed</b> <b>partial</b> denture. The mean survival rate of conventional <b>fixed</b> <b>partial</b> dentures clearly exceeds the mean survival rate of adhesive <b>fixed</b> <b>partial</b> dentures but there are biological risks. Loss of vitality of the abutment teeth and the occurrence of caries are more prominent with conventional <b>fixed</b> <b>partial</b> dentures than with adhesive <b>fixed</b> <b>partial</b> dentures. Consequently, the possibility of replacing a conventional <b>fixed</b> <b>partial</b> denture with a new conventional <b>fixed</b> <b>partial</b> denture is limited.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{optimize}} the surface electric field of the traditional AlGaN/GaN high electron mobility transistor and improve the breakdown voltage and reliability, a new AlGaN/GaN high electron mobility transistor is proposed with the <b>partial</b> <b>fixed</b> positive charges in the Si 3 N 4 passivation layer in this paper. The <b>partial</b> <b>fixed</b> positive charges of the Si 3 N 4 passivation layer do not affect the polarization effect of the AlGaN/GaN heterojunction. The surface electric field tends to the uniform distribution due to the new electric field peak formed by the <b>partial</b> <b>fixed</b> positive charges, which modulates the surface electric field by applying the electric field modulation effect. The high electric fields near the gate and drain electrode decrease due to the new electric field peak. The breakdown voltage is improved from the 296 V for the traditional structure to the 650 V for the new structure proposed. The reliability of the device is improved due to the uniform surface electric field. The effect of the electric field modulation is explained by the horizontal and vertical electric field distribution between the Si 3 N 4 and AlGaN interface, which provides a scientific basis for designing the new structure with the <b>partial</b> <b>fixed</b> positive charges in the Si 3 N 4 layer. Because of the fixed positive charge compensation, the two-dimensional electron gas concentration increases, and the on-resistance decreases.

40|$|PURPOSE. The aim of {{this article}} is to analyze the {{preference}} for treatment modality of dentists. MATERIAL AND METHODS. Data of 20, 038 patients was involved. Data analysis were done by distribution according to the various kinds of prosthesis, including complete denture, removable <b>partial</b> denture, <b>fixed</b> <b>partial</b> denture, implant-supported dental prosthesis as well as distribution according to the professional titles of the dentists finishing the treatment, including resident and professors. RESULTS. The number of cases of dental prosthesis increased year by year. 61. 06 % of the patients accepted <b>fixed</b> <b>partial</b> denture restoration. The number of patients who accepted implant supported restoration is also increasing year by year. The number of complete denture, implant-supported dental prosthesis finished by professors was larger than that done by residents, while it was contrary for removable <b>partial</b> denture, <b>fixed</b> <b>partial</b> denture, and the difference was statistically significant (P<. 05).

40|$|A resin-bonded <b>fixed</b> <b>partial</b> denture is a {{prosthetic}} construction which can replace I or several teeth in an occlusal system and which comprises a pontic element which is adhesively attached to 1 or more abutment teeth. To {{compensate for the}} limited shear strength of the adhesive layer, the Jixed partial denture is occlusally supported by the abutment(s). A direct resin-bonded <b>fixed</b> <b>partial</b> denture is made of composite, reinforced or not by a frame of flexible metal or fiber material. For an indirect resin-bonded <b>fixed</b> <b>partial</b> denture, a metal, fibre-reinforced composite or ceramic substructure is fabricated in a dental laboratory. The basic principle of a resin-bonded <b>fixed</b> <b>partial</b> denture is minimal invasiveness. However, a restoration in an abutment tooth requires a certain occlusal space which is realized by tooth preparation. Resistance preparations may be performed to improve the longevity of resin-bonded <b>fixed</b> <b>partial</b> dentures. Both financially and biologically, a resin-bonded bridge is a cost-effective prosthetic construction. The longevity is limited, but when the construction fails the negative consequences for the abutments are generally limited, which leaves open several types of other treatments...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{demand for}} all-ceramic restorations has {{increased}} substantially {{because of their}} esthetics and biocompatibility. However, the indication for a <b>fixed</b> <b>partial</b> denture has been limited by numerous problems such as low breaking strength of conventional dental ceramic and complex manufacturing techniques. Procera AllCeram is a CAD/CAM system for complete ceramic restorations with a dry-sintered high-purity aluminium oxide core. Purpose: The {{aim of this study}} was to determine whether the Procera ceramic <b>fixed</b> <b>partial</b> denture is an acceptable treatment modality. Material and methods: Nine patients were treated with a total of ten <b>fixed</b> <b>partial</b> dentures of three units. The restorations were constructed with bilateral support and one pontic, according to the Procera AllCeram technique. The California Dental Association quality evaluation system was used for assessment of marginal integrity and esthetics after two years. RESULTS: Nine of ten <b>fixed</b> <b>partial</b> dentures (90 %) showed no defects and were functioning well after two years. No caries or signs of gingivitis or periodontitis exceeding those found.
