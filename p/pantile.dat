25|$|Baines Flour Mill, which {{supplied}} {{water to}} the basin, is a red-brick building, dating from around 1800, with hipped <b>pantile</b> roofs. The main section has three storeys, {{and there is a}} two storey office range. Adjacent to the mill was the works of the Louth Gaslight Company, which were built in 1826. Baines erected a stone to define the boundary between his land and that of the Gaslight Company in 1878, following a dispute over encroachment. Soon the site of the top lock is reached. This {{has been replaced by a}} tilting weir, which controls water levels in the basin.|$|E
25|$|The Navigation {{begins at}} a large basin near the centre of Louth, which runs in a north-easterly direction. At the end are two Grade II listed warehouses. To the west is Navigation Warehouse, a {{rectangular}} building with five bays and three storeys, constructed of red brick with a <b>pantile</b> roof. It is little altered from when {{it was built in}} 1790. It was used to store grain and wool, which was then shipped down the navigation. It was largely open-plan, but has since been converted into offices, although most of the original features are still visible. To the east is Jackson's Warehouse, with ten bays, two storeys and an attic. It was converted into a dwelling in 2003, which resulted in minor changes to the doors and windows, but the open-plan interior has been retained. The two buildings are complemented by the Woolpack Inn, also Grade II listed.|$|E

6000|$|Defoe was at {{this time}} twenty-eight years old, married, {{and living in a}} house at Tooting, where he had also been active in {{foundation}} of a chapel. From hose factor he had become merchant adventurer in trade with Spain, and is said by one writer of his time to have been a [...] "civet-cat merchant." [...] Failing then in some venture in 1692, he became bankrupt, and had one vindictive creditor who, according to the law of those days, had power to shut him in prison, and destroy all power of recovering his loss and putting himself straight with the world. Until his other creditors had conquered that one enemy, and could give him freedom to earn money again and pay his debts-- when that time came he proved his sense of honesty to much larger than the letter of the law--Defoe left London for Bristol, and there kept {{out of the way of}} arrest. He was visible only on Sunday, and known, therefore, as [...] "the Sunday Gentleman." [...] His lodging was at the Red Lion Inn, in Castle Street. The house, no longer an inn, still stands, as numbers 80 and 81 in that street. There Defoe wrote this Essay on Projects." [...] He was there until 1694, when he received offers that would have settled him prosperously in business at Cadiz, but he held by his country. The cheek on free action was removed, and the Government received with favour a project of his, which is not included in the Essay, [...] "for raising money to supply the occasions of the war then newly begun." [...] He had also a project for the raising of money to supply his own occasions by the establishment of <b>pantile</b> works, which proved successful. Defoe could not be idle. In a desert island he would, like his Robinson Crusoe, have spent time, not in lamentation, but in steady work to get away.|$|E
