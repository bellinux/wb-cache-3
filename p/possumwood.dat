50|$|The grey <b>possumwood</b> is a {{small to}} {{medium-sized}} tree to 17 m tall and a stem diameter of 30 cm. It may be distinguished from the related <b>possumwood</b> (Quintinia sieberi) by the smoother bark and the branchlets being paler. The <b>possumwood</b> has minute reddish glands under the leaf where the grey <b>possumwood</b> has clear glands. The flowers of the <b>possumwood</b> are in panicles, where the grey <b>possumwood</b> has flowers on racemes.|$|E
50|$|The {{specific}} epithet honours {{the politician}} George Frederic Verdon. The plant {{was described by}} Ferdinand Mueller in 1861, from specimens collected by Hermann Beckler at the Manning and Hasting Rivers. It is sometimes referred as the smooth <b>possumwood</b> due to the bark, which contrasts to the rougher bark of the related <b>possumwood.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The {{adjacent}} forest contains {{very tall}} Antarctic Beech trees, some {{as old as}} 2000 years. Mosses and ferns are prominent. Other tree species near the lake include Golden Sassafras, Soft Corkwood, Prickly Ash, <b>Possumwood</b> and Mountain Walnut.|$|E
50|$|Quintinia verdonii, {{commonly}} known as the grey <b>possumwood,</b> is a tree of eastern Australia. It is mostly found in rainforests at high altitude. The range of natural distribution is between the Barrington Tops region of New South Wales and the Blackall Range in the state of Queensland.|$|E
50|$|Quintinia sieberi, {{known as}} <b>possumwood,</b> is a {{rainforest}} tree of eastern Australia. It is mostly found in rainforests at high altitude. The range of natural distribution {{is between the}} Clyde River, New South Wales (35° S) and the McPherson Range (28° S) just over the border {{in the state of}} Queensland.|$|E
50|$|Hura crepitans, {{the sandbox}} tree, {{also known as}} <b>possumwood</b> and jabillo, is an {{evergreen}} tree of the spurge family (Euphorbiaceae), native to tropical regions of North and South America, including the Amazon Rainforest. It is recognized by the many dark, pointed spines and smooth brown bark. These spines have caused it to be called Monkey no-climb.|$|E
50|$|The {{rainforest}} is categorised as warm temperate rainforest, (not cool temperate), {{with the}} canopy dominated by trees such as Golden Sassafras, Coachwood, Lilly Pilly, Native Daphne, <b>Possumwood,</b> Beefwood, Featherwood and Blackwood. Genuine cool temperate rainforest trees such as Pinkwood and Black Olive Berry are either absent or inconspicuous. A common tree species is the Brown Beech, {{usually associated with}} tropical or sub-tropical rainforests.|$|E
50|$|Cryptocarya nova-anglica, the {{mountain}} laurel, is a rainforest tree growing in eastern Australia. The habitat is a restricted distribution in cool temperate rainforest mostly over 1,100 metres in altitude. The range of natural distribution {{is from the}} upper Hastings River to near {{the border of the}} state of Queensland. It is an understorey tree, associated with the Antarctic beech, <b>possumwood,</b> golden sassafras and black olive berry trees.|$|E
50|$|The {{bulk of the}} {{vegetation}} in the wilderness is dry open forest and woodland, dominated by Eucalyptus sieberi and E. piperita above 800 m altitude with Eucalyptus oblonga, E. globoidea, E. agglomerata and Angophora costata becoming dominant at lower altitudes. Plateau areas have thinner or waterlogged soils and generally support heath or low open woodland communities. Within the sheltered and well watered canyon environments closed forests commonly occur, with typical species being coachwood, sassafras and <b>possumwood.</b> On the isolated basalt caps the fertile soils support taller eucalypt forests of E. viminalis, E. blaxlandii and E. fastigata. A small area of alluvial sediments deposited in the upper Grose Valley during the Quaternary supports a tall moist open forest dominated by E. deanei, E. oreades, E. notabilis and E. cypelocarpa. The Blue Gum Forest is included in this forest type.|$|E
