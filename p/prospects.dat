30|$|Considering that {{different}} geophysical <b>prospecting</b> approaches {{have their own}} characteristics on detection accuracy and scope and integrating with the geological condition of research area, the time-lapse geophysical monitoring of this project has chosen three geophysical <b>prospecting</b> methods, i.e. 3 D seismic <b>prospecting,</b> electrical <b>prospecting</b> and ground penetrating radar <b>prospecting,</b> among which 3 D seismic <b>prospecting</b> mainly aims at studying the structural changes of coal measure data (Peng et al. 2013), electrical <b>prospecting</b> aims at studying water bearing changes of strata (Han 2009) and ground penetrating radar aims at studying water bearing changes of shallow surface strata. It is helpful to improve the detection accuracy of geological results by organically integrating 3 D seismic <b>prospecting,</b> electrical <b>prospecting</b> and ground penetrating radar <b>prospecting</b> and fully taking advantage of strengths of each <b>prospecting</b> approach.|$|R

In October he wrote another report on the practicality of an atomic bomb. For this report, he worked with Fermi on calculations of the critical mass of uranium-235.

Some experiments by Lola Lopes are re-analyzed, and are demonstrated to favor cumulative <b>prospect</b> theory over <b>prospect</b> theory.
