40|$|AbstractThe PEEK/PEI/PES plastic alloys were {{processed}} by twin-screw extruder at 370 °C with five mass ratios of 70 / 30 / 0, 70 / 25 / 5, 65 / 30 / 5, 60 / 30 / 10, and 60 / 35 / 5, respectively. Their thermal properties and crystallization behavior were {{investigated by the}} differential scanning calorimetry. The measured results showed that all the plastic alloys had a single glass-transition temperature (Tg), which revealed good compatibility among the three members of PEEK, PEI and PES. For the alloy with the mass ratio of 70 / 30 / 0, the minimum Tg of 160. 6 °C was obtained, but the alloy of 60 / 35 / 5 had the maximum Tg of 164. 5 °C, which indicate that PEI, PES and the amorphous plastics could increase Tg of the PEEK alloys and was 20 °C {{higher than that of}} pure PEEK. The melting points (Tm) of these alloys were from 334. 4 °C to 336. 3 °C and their crystallinity degrees were from 35. 8 % to 37. 8 %, whereas both were slightly higher than that of pure PEEK. However, the cold crystallization temperatures of the alloys were lower than that of pure PEEK, which could be attributed to the reason that the rheological properties of the alloys were improved by PEI. Tensile strength of the <b>plastic</b> <b>alloy</b> with the ratio of 60 / 30 / 10 presented the maximum value of 108 MPa and was higher than that of pure PEEK. After thermal ageing at 158 °C (below Tg) or 178 °C (above Tg) respectively for 168 h, their tensile strengths decreased only slightly, but elongation rates at break reduced significantly, of which thermal ageing above Tg would recede the elongation at break more severely. The <b>plastic</b> <b>alloy</b> of 60 / 30 / 10 could be used as the cable insulating jacketing for nuclear power station...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe <b>plastic</b> <b>alloys</b> of PEEK/PEI/PES were {{prepared}} with extrusion molding at 370 °C in ratios of 70 / 30 / 0, 70 / 25 / 5, 65 / 30 / 5, 60 / 30 / 10, 60 / 35 / 5 (w/w). Friction and wear {{behaviors of the}} alloys were investigated under dry sliding contact condition. And wear resistances of PEEK/PEI/PES alloys were considerably improved than pure PEI and PES. The friction coefficients of the alloys were higher than the pure PEEK for 0. 2 - 0. 3. The specific wear rates of the pure PEI or PES were 4 - 6 times {{as large as the}} specific wear rate for the alloys of PEEK/PEI/PES, and the specific wear rate for the alloys of PEEK/PEI/PES is 7 ∼ 9 times as large as the specific wear rate of the pure PEEK. The <b>plastics</b> <b>alloys</b> would produce the transferred film containing PEEK on the steel counterface. However, the transferred film of pure PES or PEI was not found on the steel ring surface.

40|$|Engineering systems {{frequently}} involve complex morphological patterns, {{arising from}} either instability or growth phenomena. These morphologies manifest themselves either at an interface (typically owing to an interfacial instability process) or within the microstructure of materials (such as crystalline morphologies, grain structures, etc.). The morphologies are geometrically complex, and {{depending upon the}} application, the morphological patterns range in length scales from the macroscopic (on the order of mm to m) down to the nanoscale. In almost all applications, the morphological patterns strongly influence the performance or properties. Examples include the dependence of the overall properties of engineered materials (<b>plastics,</b> <b>alloys,</b> composites) on their microstructural morphologies, and the transport behavior (e. g., mixing and chemical reactions) at a fluid-fluid interface being governed by the interfacial morphology. ^ Prediction {{of the evolution of}} such morphologies, and relating the morphological characteristics to the engineering properties, are therefore imperative for an effective analysis and design of engineering systems, and this forms the overall focus of the thesis. Specifically, morphological evolution is considered in the context of two applications: (1) the interfacial fluid instability phenomenon of viscous fingering that occurs in a rectilinear Hele-Shaw cell, and (2) spherulitic crystal growth process (on the order of μm) during the solidification step of thermoplastic-matrix composites processing. Parametric effects of processing parameters on the respective morphological evolution in both applications are elucidated. The morphology-property relationship is studied by considering the problem of determining the mechanical properties of semicrystalline thermoplastics in terms of their lamellar level (on the order of nm) morphologies. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{presence of}} cadmium {{in the environment}} is mainly due to its use in electroplating, paint pigments, <b>plastics,</b> <b>alloy</b> preparation, mining, ceramics and silver–cadmium batteries. The chronic exposure to Cd can lead to damages to humans both directly or indirectly throughout the food chain, thus this metal and its compounds are considered as carcinogens. The most common methods used to remove heavy metals from wastewater are ion-exchange, reverse osmosis and chemical precipitation, {{but all of them}} are too expensive. In recent years, a number of studies were carried out to search for alternative, less expensive sorbents such as living or dead organisms. Our studies on Cd removal, which are reviewed in this paper, focused on the application of living microorganisms ubiquitous in wastewaters, specifically Sphaerotilus natans and Zoogloea ramigera, or dead microbial biomass of Arthrospira (Spirulina) platensis or even cellulosic biomass such as Agave americana fibers. Under the best operating conditions, Cd biosorption by dry biomass of A. platensis was very effective ranging from 149 to 357 mg g− 1. As far as living biomass is concerned, Z. ramigera and S. natans were able to remove up to 91 and 93 % of initial Cd concentration, respectively, whilst fibers of A. americana were able to remove only up to 12. 5 mg g- 1 of Cd. FT-IR spectroscopy as well as scanning electron and metallographic microscopy allowed us to get information on the mechanisms involved in Cd biosorption.
