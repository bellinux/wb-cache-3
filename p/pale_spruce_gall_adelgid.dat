5000|$|The {{spruce gall adelgid}} (Adelges lariciatus Patch) {{occurs in}} {{alternate}} years on spruce and larch from Alberta to the Maritimes and in adjacent parts of the United States. The <b>pale</b> <b>spruce</b> <b>gall</b> <b>adelgid</b> (Adelges strobilobius Kaltenbach) has a similar range but prefers black spruce or red spruce to white spruce.|$|E
2500|$|Similar galls are {{produced}} by other aphids: on Sitka spruce, by the Cooley <b>spruce</b> <b>gall</b> <b>adelgid,</b> Gilletteela cooleyi, some generations of which migrate to Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga taxifolia); and on spruce by Cnaphalodes sp., which is heteroecious with larch. The Cooley <b>spruce</b> <b>gall</b> <b>adelgids</b> form a larger gall, [...] long, which usually covers the entire tip of infested new growth.|$|R
5000|$|Balsam twig aphids (Mindarus abietnus) {{are another}} type of tree pest which affects fir and spruce trees in the spring. The aphids can cause stunted growth in trees with heavy infestations {{rendering}} badly damaged trees unsellable. Other species of adelgids also infest fir trees, those include the pine bark <b>adelgid,</b> the Cooley <b>spruce</b> <b>gall</b> <b>adelgid</b> (Adelges cooleyi), and the eastern <b>spruce</b> <b>gall</b> <b>adelgid</b> (Adelges abietis). Another serious pest are bagworms. These pests can defoliate a tree completely if present in large enough numbers. Additionally, {{the damage caused by}} the silk of bagworms can last years.|$|R
40|$|Cooley <b>spruce</b> <b>gall</b> <b>adelgid</b> {{damage was}} found on a White spruce (Picea glauca) at the University of Idaho Plant Science farm just outside Moscow, Idaho. The {{diagnosis}} was made from the observation of galls {{at or near the}} terminal ends of the branches (see Figure 1). Only new growth from the current year was affected. Galls were first observed early in the summer on terminal new growth as soft swollen tissue surrounding the needles. Some of these galls were green; others were beginning to turn a brownish purple. Figure 1 shows the appearance of the gall in late summer and fall. The plant itself was growing well, but damage from previous infestations was visible in slightly distorted growth caused by the loss of the terminal branch ends which induced lateral bud formation and branching and thereby formation of “shrubby ” branches and asymmetrical growth habit. <b>Spruce</b> <b>galls</b> are caused by the Cooley <b>spruce</b> <b>gall</b> <b>adelgid</b> (Adelges cooleyi). A small aphid-like insect, the Cooley <b>spruce</b> <b>gall</b> <b>adelgid</b> alternates its life cycle between Picea species and Douglas Fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii).

25|$|The eastern <b>spruce</b> <b>gall</b> <b>adelgid</b> (Adelges abietis Linnaeus) is an {{introduced}} species that feeds only on spruce. At least in 1985, the species {{was found in}} Canada from Ontario eastward and in adjacent parts of the United States.|$|R
50|$|The major {{types of}} {{conifers}} cultivated, pines, Douglas-firs, true firs, and spruce trees, are all affected by {{some types of}} insect pests. Douglas-firs are most vulnerable to the Cooley <b>spruce</b> <b>gall</b> <b>adelgid.</b> The true firs are most susceptible to insects such as the balsam gall midge (Paradiplosis tumifex), and the balsam twig aphid. Species of spruce trees face assault from insects such as the white pine weevil (Pissodes strobi), Cooley <b>spruce</b> <b>gall</b> <b>adelgid,</b> and the pine needle scale (Chionaspis pinifoliae). The final category of Christmas trees, pines, are commonly susceptible to insect infestation and damage from the pine root collar weevil (Hylobius radicis), Zimmerman pine moth (Dioryctria zimmermani), pine needle scale, and white pine weevil.|$|R
25|$|The {{pineapple}} <b>gall</b> <b>adelgid</b> is {{endemic to}} Europe, {{belonging to the}} 'woolly adelgid' group; it is also widely distributed in the north-eastern United States. <b>Spruce</b> <b>gall</b> aphid, eastern <b>spruce</b> pineapple <b>gall</b> adelges and eastern <b>spruce</b> <b>gall</b> aphid are alternative names. This insect belongs to the superfamily Aphidoidea, and family Adelgidae. It is the primary pest of Norway Spruce. Another similar species, the Cooley <b>spruce</b> <b>gall</b> <b>adelgid,</b> is indigenous to North America. This adelgid usually affects Colorado Blue, Sitka, Englemann, and Oriental spruces.|$|R
50|$|Excepting galls {{formed by}} the <b>spruce</b> <b>gall</b> midge, galls are caused by aphid-like insects of the family Phylloxeridae (Adelgidae) {{commonly}} known as the <b>spruce</b> <b>gall</b> <b>adelgids.</b> They have complex life cycles, some species feeding exclusively on spruce, others feeding on spruce and an alternate conifer. However, galls characteristic of each species are formed only on spruce. Six generations are usually needed to complete the 2-year cycle, {{and in the case of}} species having an alternate host, winged adults about 2 mm long are formed only in the generations that move from one host to the other.|$|R
50|$|The {{blue spruce}} is {{attacked}} by {{two species of}} Adelges, an aphid-like insect that causes galls to form. Nymphs of the pineapple <b>gall</b> <b>adelgid</b> form <b>galls</b> {{at the base of}} twigs which resemble miniature pineapples and those of the Cooley's <b>spruce</b> <b>gall</b> <b>adelgid</b> cause cone-shaped <b>galls</b> at the tips of branches. The larva of the spruce budworm eat the buds and growing shoots while the spruce needle miner hollows out the needles and makes them coalesce in a webbed mass. An elongated white scale insect, the pine needle scale feeds on the needles causing fluffy white patches on the twigs and aphids also suck sap from the needles and may cause them to fall and possibly dieback. Mites can also infest the blue spruce, especially in a dry summer, causing yellowing of the oldest needles. Another insect pest is the spruce beetle (Dendroctonus rufipennis) which bores under the bark. It often first attacks trees which have blown over by the wind and when the larvae mature two years afterwards, a major outbreak occurs and vast numbers of beetles attack nearby standing trees.|$|R
25|$|Amongst the invertebrates, typical insects of the Moist Mixed Grassland {{ecoregion}} are monarch (Danaus plexippus), mosquito (Anopheles quadrimaculatus), rose curculi, yellow jacket wasp (Vespula pennsylvanica), sow bug (Malacostraca isopoda), bumblebee (Bombus ternarius), blue-winged olive (Ephemerella cornuta), {{daddy longlegs}} (Opiliones), dragonfly, grasshopper (Melanoplus differentialis), harvester ant (Pogonomyrmex), and two-spotted lady beetle (Adalia bipunctata). Gardeners and horticulturists have identified various hemipterans {{during the growing}} season affecting their cash crop such as aphids, including the pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum), English grain aphid (Macrosiphum avenae), and green peach aphid (Myzus persicae), <b>spruce</b> <b>gall</b> <b>adelgid</b> (Adelges cooleyi), pine needle scale (Chionaspis pinifoliae), tomato psyllid (Bactericera cockerelli), greenhouse whitefly (Trialeurodes vaporariorum), aster leafhopper (Macrosteles quadrilineatus) alfalfa plant bug (Adelphocoris lineolatus), tarnished plant bug (Lygus lineolaris), and black grass bug (Labops hesperius). Freshwater invertebrates of Saskatchewan typically consist of clams (Pelycypoda) (Mollusca Bivalvia), mollusca (Gastropoda and Pelecypoda), leech (Hirudinea), freshwater earthworm Oligochaeta, virile crayfish (Orconectes virilis), Scud (Amphipoda), fairy shrimp (Anostraca), Copepod, water flea (Cladocera), clam shrimp (Conchostraca), water mite (Hydrachnida) caddisfly (Trichoptera), damselfly (Zygoptera), mayfly (Ephemeroptera), alderfly (Megaloptera), seed shrimp (Ostracod), and tadpole shrimp (Notostraca).|$|R

50|$|According to data {{collected}} in 1993 and 1994 during an outbreak in Alberta and the Northwest Territories, galled current-year shoots caused by <b>spruce</b> <b>gall</b> midge displayed a {{negative binomial distribution}} described by the mean kp = 5.3333, the variance kpq = 83.0828, and the dispersion parameter k = 0.3007. The data were used to derive a sequential sampling plan for the classification of damage cause by <b>spruce</b> <b>gall</b> midge, of use to foresters and pest managers (Brandt 2000). Tiny parasitic wasps usually keep midge populations sufficiently in check to render control measures unnecessary.|$|R
2500|$|Only {{females of}} the {{pineapple}} <b>gall</b> <b>adelgid</b> are known. In spring, the newly hatched nymphs formed from over-wintered eggs feed at {{the bases of}} the growing needles; the induced swellings eventually coalesce to form the pseudocone structure, each cell of which contains about twelve nymphs.

50|$|The {{lifecycle}} of the <b>gall</b> <b>adelgid</b> requires six {{generations to}} complete, {{only two of}} which cause damage (nymph stages) and has two migration phases between the spruce and the Douglas fir. On Douglas fir, adults are about 0.1 cm long, oval, and light to dark brown in colour. At maturity, they are completely covered with white, waxy wool and appear, from spring to fall, as stationary wool tufts {{on the underside of}} needles.|$|R

2500|$|The Pineapple <b>gall</b> <b>adelgid</b> (Adelges abietis) {{is a type}} of conifer-feeding insect {{that forms}} pineapple-shaped plant galls on its host species, {{commonly}} Norway and Sitka spruce. The adelgids (genus Adelges) are pear-shaped, soft-bodied green insects with long antennae, closely related to the aphid. [...] "Adelges" [...] lays up to one hundred eggs at a time, one on each needle. Adelges abietis (Linnaeus, 1758) {{is one of the most}} common species; synonyms are A. gallarum-abietis, Chermes abietis and Sacciphantes abietis.|$|R
25|$|There are {{no known}} {{effective}} parasites or predators of Adelges abietis. Specimen trees in gardens may be afforded {{a degree of}} protection by hanging up fat balls to encourage tits which will also feed on the <b>adelgid</b> <b>gall</b> formers.|$|R
50|$|An {{outbreak}} of <b>spruce</b> <b>gall</b> midge occurred in northern Alberta and adjacent {{areas in the}} Northwest Territories in 1992 (Brandt 2000). The infestation was widespread in white spruce stands, with 84% of surveyed sites infested and twig mortality as high as 81% among current-year shoots. Earlier, Rose and Lindquist (1985) had noted that severe injury to spruce is unusual, and had been recorded only {{from a number of}} locations in Yukon Territory. Levels of damage in the 1992 outbreak decreased at most sites in 1994, and by spring 1995 the outbreak had collapsed. About 15 million ha were affected at the peak. Other outbreaks have occurred in Yukon Territory in 1968 and 1969 (Tripp et al. 1970), in Connecticut in the early 1970s (Stephens 1985), and in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia in 1981 and 1982 (Magasi 1983). Typically, outbreaks have been localized and of short duration.|$|R
50|$|<b>Spruce</b> <b>gall</b> midges overwinter as orange larvae in galled current-year shoots (Felt 1926). Larvae {{are about}} 1.5 mm long when fully grown. The pupa is {{formed in the}} larval cell in early spring, often {{protruding}} from the cell before the adult emerges. Pupation usually occurs from mid-May to early June, and the 2-winged reddish-brown adult midge emerges through a conspicuous hole in the gall formed in the previous year’s shoot. Mating occurs shortly thereafter, and eggs are laid on the newly developing shoots {{at the base of}} the needles (Smith 1952). As many as 100 larvae per shoot have been reported. Larvae bore immediately into the twig and form cells, the galls forming by the swelling of tissues surrounding the larval cells. Gall formation becomes noticeable within 10 days as a series of small, semi-globose swellings, which render the infected twig twice its normal diameter. Galled twigs usually remain on branches for several years.|$|R
2500|$|Removal and {{destruction}} of newly formed <b>galls</b> will reduce <b>adelgid</b> populations. Although old galls can be unsightly, their removal will not affect adelgid populations because the organisms have already emerged from these galls. On small trees, galled shoot tips can be pruned, but generally, this is a pest that can be tolerated.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In 1989 and 1990, spruce cones were {{harvested}} at 29 sites distributed {{over the}} five main geographic regions of Switzerland, i. e. Jura, Central Plateau, North, Central and South Alps. The presence of insects and the species-spe-cific consumption of seeds was determined for each cone by {{examination of the}} median longitudinal section. Seven seed-feeding species (Assara terebrella, Cydia strobilella, Dioryctria abietella, Eupithecia abietaria, Megastigmus strobi-lobius, Plemeliella abietina, Strobilomyia anthracina) and the <b>spruce</b> cone <b>gall</b> midge Kaltenbachiola strobi {{were found in the}} samples. The proportions of infested cones ranged from 36 to 100 %. The regions did not show significant dif-ferences in terms of infestation rates, whereas differences between sites within the regions were highly significant. Seed loss ranged from 2 to 100 %, its geographical distribution exhibiting a similar pattern to the infestation rates. Considering the number of infested cones, C. strobilella was the most abundant species, followed by K. strobi and P. abietina. Cones infested by conospermatophagous species (C. strobilella, D. abietella, E. abietaria) showed higher seed losses than those infested by spermatophages (M. strobilobius, P. abietina). Due to the ubiquitous occurrence of C. strobilella, its high infestation rates and the resulting seed losses caused by its offspring, this species has to be con-sidered as the most important insect seed predator in Switzerland. A multiple linear regression analysis was carried out for each region to simultaneously explore the impact of site and tree variables as well as the effect of insect attack on the yield of viable seeds. The results indicate that site and tree conditions contributed more to the variability of seed yield than insect presence in a cone. The model predicted significant effects of insect attack mainly for cones with total seed numbers that were higher than the average. ...|$|R
