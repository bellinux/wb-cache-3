40|$|This thesis aims {{to chart}} {{and explain the}} {{evolution}} of credit practices and the law’s reaction to them vis-à-vis the protection of borrowers between 1700 and 1974. The cat-and-mouse game played out between the credit industry and the legislature, and the longstanding tension between the credit needs of the commercial community {{and those of the}} small <b>private</b> <b>borrower</b> are of central importance. This thesis is primarily historical rather than theoretical; it seeks to describe and explain legal developments over time. But, in order to illuminate this development, the law will be viewed through the lens of a simple analytical framework based on the dichotomy between public law regulation, on the one hand, and the private law of contract, on the other. Viewed through this lens, {{it should be possible to}} position the law at any given stage of its development at a particular point on a scale of ‘regulatoriness’. The framework within which these rules were originally developed was, of course, neither intentionally nor self-consciously theoretical, but that is not to say that a theoretical framework lacks utility in legal historical inquiry...|$|E

By analyzing nearly 31, 000 syndicated loans to <b>private</b> <b>borrowers</b> in 65 countries over the period 2005 - 2009, we find that banks not only cut lending during a crisis but also increase their screening and monitoring. Lending standards are tightened in particular for uncollateralized loans, loans to first-time borrowers, and financial-sector borrowers in developed countries. While in developed countries screening and monitoring increases less for loans to rated borrowers and for loans structured by well-known arrangers, we show that the attenuating impact of credit ratings and arranger reputation does not extend to emerging markets. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper models the Tequila effect (triggered by the {{collapse}} of the Mexican peso in December 1994) as a temporary increase in the risk premium faced by domestic <b>private</b> <b>borrowers</b> on world capital markets. The effects of this shock are studied in an intertemporal optimizing framework where firms’ demand for working capital is financed by bank credit. Under the assumption that the perceived duration of the shock is sufficiently long, the model is capable of reproducing some of the main features of Argentina’s economic downturn in the aftermath of {{the collapse}} of the Mexican peso: the rise in domestic interest rates, the reduction in net private capital inflows and the drop in official reserves, the reduction in bank deposits and credit supply, the fall in private consumption, the contraction in output, and the increase in unemployment. ...|$|R
40|$|When {{financial}} markets freeze in fear, borrowing costs for solvent governments may fall towards zero in {{a flight to}} quality – but credit-worthy <b>private</b> <b>borrowers</b> can be starved of external funding. In Kiyotaki and Moore (2008), where liquidity crisis is captured by the effective rationing of private credit, tightening credit constraints have direct effects on investment. If prices are sticky, the effects on aggregate demand can be pronounced – as reported by FRBNY for the US economy using a calibrated DSGE-style framework modified to include such frictions. In such an environment, two factors stand out. First the recycling of credit flows by central banks can dramatically ease credit-rationing faced by private investors: this is the rationale for Quantitative Easing. Second, revenue-neutral fiscal transfers aimed at would-be investors can have similar effects. We show these features in a stripped- down macro model of inter-temporal optimisation subject to credit constraints. ...|$|R

40|$|For many {{developing}} countries, {{alternative forms of}} external finance—all forms of finance that are not guaranteed by or mediated through the public sector— have become increasingly important as traditional financing to the public sector has ebbed. Yet {{a survey of the}} literature reveals few recent analytical insights about alternative financing, which includes foreign direct investment, project lending, portfolio investment, closed-end equity funds, private nonguaranteed debt, licensing, joint ventures, quasi-equity contracts, and other forms of private, nonrecourse lending to <b>private</b> <b>borrowers.</b> The literature offers little solid guid-ance for distinguishing between alternative and traditional financing with re-spect to country risk, for establishing the most appropriate and efficient incentive structures and restrictions in the host country, or for identifying the optimal fi-nancing modes for international firms investing in developing countries. This gap in the analytical literature has important implications for policy formula-tion.

40|$|I {{examine whether}} a benevolent {{government}} can improve {{on the free}} market allocation by setting capital requirements for <b>private</b> <b>borrowers</b> in a stochastic model with collateral constraints. Previous theoretical {{studies have found that}} when asset prices enter into bor- rowing constraints, pecuniary externalities between atomistic agents can make the laissez faire equilibrium constrained ine¢ cient. For reasonable parameter values, I find that, quan- titatively, the answer is 'no', private and government leverage choices coincide. Limiting private leverage by imposing capital requirements has the beneficial e¤ect of dampening the effects of the collateral amplification mechanism. This reduces fire sales in recessions and limits the negative externality that individual asset sales have on other credit constrained borrowers. However, we find that capital requirements are a blunt tool. They tax the activities of highly productive entrepreneurs and reduce the amount they produce in equilibrium. This reduces total factor productivity and steady state consumption. In the end, society faces a choice between high but unstable consumption in the free borrowing world and low but stable consumption in the regulated world. The government chooses the former. ...|$|R
40|$|The paper elicits a {{mechanism}} by which private leverage choices exhibit strategic complementarities through the reaction of monetary policy. When everyone engages in maturity transformation, authorities have little choice but facilitating refinancing. In turn, refusing to adopt a risky balance sheet lowers the return on equity. The key ingredient is that monetary policy is non-targeted. The ex post benefits from a monetary bailout accrue {{in proportion to the}} number amount of leverage, while the distortion costs are to a large extent fixed. This insight has important consequences. First, banks choose to correlate their risk exposures. Second, <b>private</b> <b>borrowers</b> may deliberately choose to increase their interest-rate sensitivity following bad news about future needs for liquidity. Third, optimal monetary policy is time inconsistent. Fourth, macro-prudential supervision is called for. We characterize the optimal regulation, which {{takes the form of a}} minimum liquidity requirement coupled with monitoring of the quality of liquid assets.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a framework for}} analyzing optimal government bailout policy in a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model where financial crises are exogenous. Important elements of the model are that <b>private</b> <b>borrowers</b> only internalize {{part of the social}} cost of foreign borrowing in the emerging market and that the private sector is illiquid {{in the event of a}} crisis. The distinguishing feature of our paper is that it addresses the optimal bailout policy in an environment where there are both costs and benefits of bailouts, and where bailout guarantees potentially distort investment decisions in the private sector. We show that it is always optimal to commit to a bailout policy that only partially protects investment against inefficient liquidation, both in a centralized economy and a market economy. Due to overinvestment in the market economy, the government’s optimal level of bailout guarantees is lower than in the social optimum. Further, we show that, in contrast to a social planner, the government in the market economy should optimally bail out a smaller fraction of private investments when the probability of a crisis increases. financial crisis; government bailout; emerging markets...|$|R
40|$|The {{international}} banking {{crisis that}} began in 2007 has brought the relationship between international banking activities and financial crises to the forefront. The growing reliance on foreign interbank funding by domestic banks has been recognized as a crucial factor in explaining the banking and sovereign debt crisis currently affecting several peripheral European countries. This article shows that the link between financial crisis and international interbank lending {{is not a new}} phenomenon; a similar trend can be observed in the Mexican banking sector during the run-up to its 1982 debt crisis. I explore the international activities of Mexican commercial banks in the years preceding the country's default and demonstrate that they became involved in international lending which was funded largely through heavy short-term interbank foreign borrowing. I provide new archival evidence which shows that in intermediating foreign finance with local public and <b>private</b> <b>borrowers,</b> Mexican banks incurred maturity, interest rate and currency mismatches and dangerously increased their risk position.

40|$|Major {{changes have}} taken place in the U. S. economy within the past quarter century. Changes with {{implications}} that are at least potentially important for the effect of monetary policy on real economic activity include the elimination of Regulation Q interest ceilings and the development of the secondary mortgage market, the greater openness of the U. S. economy including both goods markets and financial markets, and the rapidly increasing indebtedness of <b>private</b> <b>borrowers</b> including especially nonfinancial business corporations. Examination of relationships between monetary policy and economic activity at a detailed, disaggregated level indicates several changes within the past quarter century that are broadly consistent with these changes in the underlying economic environment: First, the elimination of major episodes of credit rationing in the mortgage market has clearly rendered housing less sensitive to restrictive monetary policy; moreover, there is no solid evidence of change in the sensitivity of homebuilding to mortgage interest rates. Second, business fixed investment has become more sensitive to financial market conditions, {{at least in the short}} run. Third, consumer spending has become less sensitive to interest rate increases and stock price declines, at least in situations that persist for lengthy periods of time. Fourth, although foreign trade has clearly grown relative to aggregate U. S. economic activity, both exports and imports exhibit less sensitivity to exchange rate changes, and hence presumably less sensitivity to monetary policy actions, than in earlier years. ...|$|R
40|$|An earlier {{paper by}} the author {{investigated}} the quantitative implications, for the effectiveness of fiscal and monetary policies, of a model treating the determination of long-term interest rates by explicitly imposing the market clearing equilibrium condition that the quantity of bonds issued by <b>private</b> <b>borrowers</b> equal the quantity purchased by lenders. One incomplete aspect of that investigation, however, was the failure to allow explicitly for the government budget constraint. This paper reports results based on an expanded model that also imposes an analogous market clearing condition in the U. S. government securities market. The explicit imposition of the government budget constraint makes a major difference for the simulated effectiveness of both fiscal and monetary policies -indeed, a greater difference than that due simply to using the supply-demand representation of {{the determination of the}} private bond rate in the earlier paper. As is to be expected on the basis of familiar economic theory, the effect of imposing the government budget constraint is to make the real-sector effects of fiscal policy appear smaller and the real- sector effects of monetary policy appear greater. The main message of these results is that, when relative asset stock effects are the heart of the issue -as is the case in analyzing the implications of the government budget constraint -models that are implicitly consistent with the relevant economic behavior {{are not the same as}} models that explicitly represent it. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the integration of}} domestic financial markets in Western Pacific economies – an unexamined issue {{in the literature of}} international financial integration – by exploring the relationship between money market interest rates and deposit and loan interest rates. Rules for setting interest rates on deposits and loans are derived, and these are shown to be consistent with commercial banking practice and to capture recent key developments in the banking sectors of the region. An error-correction model is used to show that the integration of domestic institutional financial markets has increased substantially over the past decade, due to pervasive liberalisation and, more recently, growing competitiveness. The adjustment of domestic institutional rates to changes in money market rates has increased, often significantly, and by {{the first half of the}} 1990 s the speed and pattern of adjustment of institutional rates in most of the developing/newly developed economies of East Asia had become similar to that in economies with developed financial systems. There is also a difference between the adjustment of deposit and loan rates, with the former adjusting more rapidly. This may be explained by differences in the maturity, substitutability and transactions costs associated with loans and deposits. The riskiness of <b>private</b> <b>borrowers</b> and the poor health of the banking system were shown to have a significant, deleterious effect on the level of loan rates in the region. Country differences are analysed and implications for monetary policy, competition policy and supervision policy are noted. ...|$|R
50|$|Another {{reason for}} the {{instability}} of the Argentine currency was the fragility of domestic financial institutions. The Argentine banking crisis of 1990 underlined this point, as the Central Bank moved to confiscate the deposits of commercial banks to overcome a liquidity crunch, exchanging certain types of time deposits for BONEX bonds. Tightening domestic credit became increasingly limited to the public sector: only US$17 billion of loans outstanding (45% of the total) were accounted for by <b>private</b> sector <b>borrowers,</b> and this declined to US$7 billion during the 1989 crisis. Accordingly, the nation's money supply (M2) fell by nearly identical figures, while affluent Argentine nationals held over US$50 billion overseas.|$|R
