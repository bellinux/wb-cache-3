5|$|The Provisional Government also {{included}} a judiciary. The forerunner of the Oregon Supreme Court consisted of a single Supreme Judge and two justices of the peace. The Supreme Judge was elected by the people, but the legislature could select someone as presiding judge as a replacement if needed.

Some judges under the Provisional Government were Nathaniel Ford, Peter H. Burnett, Osborne Russell, Ira L. Babcock, and future United States Senator James W. Nesmith.|$|E

40|$|This Article {{examines}} {{the sources of}} the contemporary problems associated with the adjudication of parental rights matters in Maine 2 ̆ 7 s <b>probate</b> <b>courts</b> and identifies specific reforms to address both the structural and substantive law problems.

It traces the expansion of jurisdiction over children and families from a limited role incidental to the administration of a decedent 2 ̆ 7 s estate to the current scope—a range of matters that may result in the limitation, suspension, or termination of the rights of living parents. Maine 2 ̆ 7 s <b>probate</b> <b>courts</b> not adjudicate questions implicating parental rights {{in a wide range of}} scenarios. However, the basic structure of Maine 2 ̆ 7 s <b>probate</b> <b>courts</b> has remained unchanged since 1855.
