40|$|Flexography is a {{printing}} technique {{widely used in}} the packaging production. The main feature of flexography {{is the use of}} a <b>printing</b> <b>plate</b> elastically deformed during the reproduction process. The <b>printing</b> <b>plate</b> is made of an elastic material, rubber or nowadays of mainly different types of photopolymer. The elasticity of the <b>plate</b> enables the <b>printing</b> {{on a wide range of}} printing substrates, which is one of its advantages compared to other printing techniques. On the other hand, deformations of the <b>printing</b> <b>plate</b> in the <b>printing</b> process caused by the pressure between the <b>printing</b> <b>plate</b> and the substrate present a major limitation of flexography. Apart from the functional properties of the <b>printing</b> <b>plate</b> in the <b>printing</b> process, the <b>plate</b> making process, including photo polymerization, considerably influences the value of halftones on the <b>printing</b> <b>plate,</b> and consequently on the final product. The aim of this paper is to examine the influence of screen ruling on the formation of printing elements and the adjustment of the <b>printing</b> <b>plate</b> making process in order to achieve optimal quality of the <b>printing</b> <b>plate</b> and, therefore, the final product. The results have shown that the use of different screen rulings is of great significance in the processes of <b>printing</b> <b>plate</b> curve adjustment. It was proven that the use of different screen ruling has a considerable influence upon relief depth and a cross-section of the printing elements (3 D analysis), which again have a significant impact on the quality of the final product, but cannot be detected in 2 D analysis...|$|R

5|$|In 2010, all of Potter's 23 small format {{books were}} still in print, and some, {{including}} The Flopsy Bunnies, were available in formats such as audiobook and Kindle. All 23 tales were available in a 400-page single volume, as individual volumes, and in complete collections of individual volumes offered in presentation boxes. First editions were available through antiquarian booksellers. The English language editions of the little books still bear the Frederick Warne imprint though the company was bought by Penguin Books in 1983.

5|$|The Echo {{moved from}} Bridge Street to a {{purpose-built}} newspaper office at Echo House, Pennywell Industrial Estate, in 1976. The move brought {{an end to}} the traditional methods of printing using hot molten metal to produce type and <b>printing</b> <b>plates,</b> and introduced computer technology. The £4million development saw the Echo become the first daily newspaper in the North East to be completely produced by photo-composition and web-offset printing. It also saw a change in the Echos appearance, with a new shape, bolder typefaces and clearer printing. The first new-look Echo was printed at Pennywell on 26 April 1976 and was issue number 32,512.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{challenges}} in mass printing is repeatability and stability of the ink transfer from the <b>printing</b> <b>plate</b> onto the <b>printing</b> substrate. The pad printing is characterised by indirect ink transfer from a gravure <b>printing</b> <b>plate.</b> Beside area of the printing elements, on the pad <b>printing</b> <b>plate</b> one should take into account their depth as it is a factor which directly influences the printing ink quantity, i. e. overall quality of the printed product. The photopolymer pad <b>printing</b> <b>plate</b> production includes two exposures with UV irradiation, first to make difference between printing and nonprinting areas and second to form partitions (walls) in the printing elements. The duration of the second exposure directly influences the final depth of the printing elements. The aim {{of this paper is to}} determine influence of the second exposure on the depth of the printing elements, consequently on the reproduction of the pad <b>printing</b> <b>plate</b> elements. For this purpose four pad <b>printing</b> <b>plate</b> samples with various coverage tone value fields will be made by variation of the second exposure duration. Results have shown that second exposure duration significantly influences the printing elements size and therefore should be defined precisely in order to form printing elements of desired depth...|$|R

Modern <b>printing</b> <b>plates</b> have a brushed or roughened texture and are covered with a photosensitive emulsion. A photographic negative of the desired image is placed {{in contact with the}} emulsion and the plate is exposed to ultraviolet light. After development, the emulsion shows a reverse of the negative image, which is thus a duplicate of the original (positive) image. The image on the plate emulsion can also be created through direct laser imaging in a CTP (Computer-To-Plate) device called a platesetter. The positive image is the emulsion that remains after imaging. For many years, chemicals have been used to remove the non-image emulsion, but now plates are available that do not require chemical processing.|$|E

40|$|Recently printed {{electronic}} field is significantly growth. Printed electronic {{is to develop}} electrical devices by printing method. Conventional printing method that has been studied {{for this kind of}} printed electronic such as flexographic, micro contact printing, screen printing, gravure and ink jet. In flexographic and microcontact <b>printing,</b> a <b>printing</b> <b>plate</b> is used to transfer the designed and desired pattern to substrate through conformed contact. Therefore <b>printing</b> <b>plate</b> is play a big role in this area. <b>Printing</b> <b>plate</b> making by photopolymer which used in flexographic have limitation in achieving a micro-scale of pattern size. However, <b>printing</b> <b>plate</b> of microcontact <b>printing</b> have an advantages in producing micro, even nano-scale size by PDMS (Polydimethylsiloxane). Hence, rapid prototyping 3 D printer was used for developing a PDMS micro-scale <b>printing</b> <b>plate</b> which will be used in reel to reel (R 2 R) flexographic due to high speed, low cost, mass production of this type of printing process. The flexibility of 3 D printer in producing any shape of pattern easily, contributed the success of this study. A nickel plating and glass etching master pattern was used in this study too as master pattern mould since 3 D printer has been reached the micro size limitation. The finest multiple solid line array with 1 mm width and 2 mm gap pattern of <b>printing</b> <b>plate</b> was successfully fabricated by 3 D printer master mould due to size limitation of the FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling) 3 D printer nozzle itself. However, the micro-scale multiple solid line array of 100 micron and 25 micron successfully made by nikel platting and glass etching master mould respectively. Those types of <b>printing</b> <b>plate</b> producing method is valueable since it is easy, fast and low cost, used for micro-flexographic in printed {{electronic field}} or biomedical application...|$|R

25|$|Those {{engraved}} {{images on}} the 2 and 3 cent Washington-head issues that appear similar but whose lines vary significantly are referred to and often cataloged as types. Type I occurs on flat plate printings only while types II & III also occur mostly in rotary press printings and in offset printings as they were produced from photo plates made from the former <b>printing</b> <b>plates.</b> The 2-cent Type II stamp does not occur on a flat plate stamp. Because the commonly used denominations of the Washington-Franklin issues were printed in greater quantities the worn <b>printing</b> <b>plates</b> {{would have to be}} replaced in the process from time to time. Though each new plate was made from the same die transfer, the plates would still differ slightly from the previous plate in use due to the bending process to fit the plate around the rotary press printing cylinder. Plates would also differ because the transfer die itself would wear from repeated image transfers to the printing plate.|$|E
