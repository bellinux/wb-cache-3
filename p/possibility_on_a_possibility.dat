40|$|Abstract. In this {{editorial}} article I {{review the}} first decade of published papers in Theory & Psychology, particularly noting several tensions and problems manifested in contemporary theory. One of these is the tension between the universal and the particular, another is captured by {{the way in which the}} work of James Gibson and Ludwig Wittgenstein is in a limited sense representative of the kinds of problems articulated in the journal. I discuss the changing social context of the academy and the publishing industry and how these are likely to influence journal publishing, and Theory & Psychology, in the next decade. Finally I introduce the papers that make up this special issue and that bring together a broad set of concerns that will likely define the problems of theory for the future.
