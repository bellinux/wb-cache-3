40|$|OBJECTIVES : In the past, {{platelet}} morphology during normal pregnancy has {{not been}} given much attention. METHODS : Electron microscopy analysis of platelets from 60 pregnant individuals (30 early <b>pregnancy</b> (<b>weeks</b> 8 - 14) participants and 30 late <b>pregnancy</b> (<b>weeks</b> 36 - 40) participants which were followed up 6 - 8 weeks post-partum) were compared to platelets from 30 non-pregnant individuals as well as each other to establish whether differences in platelet morphology exist during pregnancy. RESULTS : Ultrastructural changes pertaining to the external and internal arrangements of platelets were visible. Fixated platelets showed pseudopodia formation and membrane blebbing. Increased and enlarged open canalicular system pores, pseudopodia formation, platelet spreading, and membrane blebbing were visible in vital platelets. Platelets from pregnancy were tightly packed and internal structures were different from the non-pregnant group. The internal granules showed modification in their occurrence within the cell. The α- and lysosomal granule counts were significantly increased during pregnancy while dense granule and mitochondrial numbers were significantly decreased. DISCUSSION : This may point to a pregnancy-specific modification. The changes in platelet ultrastructure discerned in this study attribute to the hypercoagulable state associated with pregnancy. All ultrastructural alterations associated with pregnancy persist for at least 2 months after birth. National Research Foundation (NRF) of South Africa[URL]...|$|R
50|$|Parvovirus {{infection}} in pregnant women {{is associated with}} hydrops fetalis due to severe fetal anemia, sometimes leading to miscarriage or stillbirth. The risk of fetal loss is about 10% if infection occurs before <b>pregnancy</b> <b>week</b> 20 (especially between weeks 14 and 20), but minimal after then. Routine screening of the antenatal sample would enable the pregnant mother to determine the risk of infection. Knowledge of her status would allow the mother to avoid contact with individuals suspected or known to have an ongoing infection, however, at the present time, antenatal testing for immunity is not recommended, {{since there is no}} good means to prevent the infection, there is not specific therapy and there are no vaccines available. It may increase maternal anxiety and fear without proven benefit. The best approach would be to recommend all pregnant women to avoid contact with children with current symptoms of infection, as described above. The risk to the fetus will be reduced with correct diagnosis of the anemia (by ultrasound scans) and treatment (by blood transfusions). There is some evidence that intrauterine Parvovirus B19 infection leads to developmental abnormalities in childhood.|$|E
40|$|Pregnant {{women and}} infants {{are at risk}} for {{selenium}} deficiency, which is known to have negative effects on immune and brain function. We have investigated selenium levels in 158 healthy never-pregnant women and in 114 pregnant and lactating women and their infants at age 6 months and related this to clinical outcomes during the first 6 months of life. Neurodevelopment was assessed with the parental questionnaire Ages and Stages (ASQ) at 6 months. A maternal selenium level ≤ 0. 90 µmol/L in <b>pregnancy</b> <b>week</b> 18 was negatively related to infant neurodevelopment at 6 months (B = − 20, p = 0. 01), whereas a selenium level ≤ 0. 78 µmol/L in <b>pregnancy</b> <b>week</b> 36 was associated with an increased risk (odds ratio 4. 8) of having an infant infection during the first 6 weeks of life. A low maternal selenium status in pregnancy was found to be associated with an increased risk of infant infection during the first 6 weeks of life and a lower psychomotor score at 6 months. We suggest a cutoff for maternal serum selenium deficiency of 0. 90 µmol/L in <b>pregnancy</b> <b>week</b> 18 and 0. 78 µmol/L in <b>pregnancy</b> <b>week</b> 36. This should be reevaluated in an intervention study...|$|E

The associations of <b>pregnancy</b> <b>week</b> at delivery with shoulder dystocia were estimated as crude and adjusted odds ratios using logistic regression analyses. We repeated the analyses in pregnancies with and without maternal diabetes. |Shoulder dystocia at delivery. |The overall incidence of shoulder dystocia was 0. 73 % (n = 14, 820), and the incidence increased by increasing <b>pregnancy</b> <b>week</b> at delivery. Birthweight was strongly associated with shoulder dystocia. After adjustment for birthweight, induction of labour, use of epidural analgesia at delivery, prolonged labour, forceps-assisted and vacuum-assisted delivery, parity, period of delivery and maternal age in multivariable analyses, the adjusted odds ratios for shoulder dystocia were 1. 77 (1. 42 - 2. 20) for deliveries at 32 - 35 weeks of gestation, and 0. 84 (0. 79 - 0. 88) at 42 - 43 weeks of gestation, using weeks 40 - 41 as the reference. In pregnancies affected by diabetes (n = 11, 188), the incidence of shoulder dystocia was 3. 95 %, and after adjustment for birthweight the adjusted odds ratio for shoulder dystocia was 2. 92 (95 % CI 1. 54 - 5. 52) for deliveries at weeks 32 - 35 of gestation, and 0. 91 (95 % CI 0. 50 - 1. 66) at 42 - 43 weeks of gestation. |The risk of shoulder dystocia was associated with increased birthweight, diabetes, induction of labour, use of epidural analgesia at delivery, prolonged labour, forceps-assisted and vacuum-assisted delivery, parity and period of delivery but not with post-term delivery.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{purpose of}} this study was to confirm that women with latent {{toxoplasmosis}} have developmentally younger fetuses at estimated <b>pregnancy</b> <b>week</b> 16 and to test four exclusive hypotheses that could explain the observed data. Methods In the present retrospective cohort study we analysed by the GLM (general linear model) method data from 730 Toxoplasma -free and 185 Toxoplasma -infected pregnant women. Results At <b>pregnancy</b> <b>week</b> 16 estimated from the date of the last menstruation, the mothers with latent toxoplasmosis had developmentally younger fetuses based on ultrasound scan (P = 0. 014). Pregnancy of Toxoplasma -positive compared to Toxoplasma -negative women was by about 1. 3 days longer, as estimated both from the date of the last menstruation (P = 0. 015) and by ultrasonography (P = 0. 025). Conclusion The most parsimonious explanation for the observed data is retarded fetal growth during the first weeks of pregnancy in Toxoplasma -positive women. The phenomenon was only detectable in multiparous women, suggesting that the immune system may play some role in it. </p...|$|E
40|$|Postpartum {{depression}} is a psychiatric disorder affecting a substantial proportion of newly delivered women, and remains a significant cause of childbirth-related morbidity. The {{aim of the}} present thesis was to examine psychological, endocrine and genetic aspects of postpartum depression in a large, population-based sample of women in Uppsala, Sweden. All included studies were undertaken as parts of the BASIC-project, a longitudinal study on psychological wellbeing during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Study participants were screened for depressive symptoms in <b>pregnancy</b> <b>week</b> 17 and 32 {{as well as at}} six weeks and six months postpartum, mainly by use of the Swedish version of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Furthermore, personality was assessed with the Swedish universities Scale of Personality (SSP) in <b>pregnancy</b> <b>week</b> 32. Evening cortisol levels in saliva were measured in <b>pregnancy</b> <b>week</b> 36 and at six weeks postpartum. Blood samples were obtained to measure corticotropin-releasing hormone levels (CRH) and to perform genetic analyses. The results of this thesis demonstrate that neuroticism is a strong and independent predictive factor of depressive symptoms at six weeks and six months postpartum, and has a significant mediatory role in the association between a single nucleotide polymorphism in the hydroxysteroid (11 -beta) dehydrogenase 1 gene (HSD 11 B 1) and postpartum depression. Furthermore, women with postpartum depressive symptoms present with a dysregulated hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity in terms of elevated cortisol levels postpartum, as well as elevated CRH levels in mid-gestation. In conclusion, this thesis develops current knowledge on several attributes of postpartum depression. Further studies are required to replicate and expand on these results, which would further contribute to early identification of women at risk of postpartum depression and adoption of proper interventions that may moderate the short- and long-term consequences of the disorder...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Normal {{pregnancy}} {{is characterized by}} significant alterations in the haemostatic system accompanied by an augmented risk of thrombosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The fibrin network ultrastructure of different phases of pregnancy, namely early <b>pregnancy</b> (<b>week</b> 8 – 14), late <b>pregnancy</b> (<b>week</b> 36 – 40) as well as post-partum (week 6 – 8 after birth) were compared to non-pregnant fibrin networks as well as each other to establish whether differences in fibrin network morphology exist during pregnancy. Scanning electron microscopy was employed to analyse fibrin network morphology. RESULTS: The fibrin networks from all phases of pregnancy appeared similar to each other, exhibiting prominent coagulant formation, {{an increase in the}} formation of minor, thin fibers, and the presence of granular globules. Al three phases however differ from the typical fibrin network ultrastructure exhibited by the fibrin networks from non-pregnant individuals. The increase in estrogen associated with pregnancy may cause the increase in coagulation factors and ultimately the pro-thrombotic state characteristic of pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: Since no differences were apparent between the different phases of pregnancy it suggests that activation of the coagulation system commences with pregnancy and this pro-thrombotic state continues till at least 8 weeks after birth. These results may shed light on possible pathological mechanisms employed in the development of abnormal or ailing pregnancy. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|Blood flow {{variables}} obtained via Doppler ultrasound (US) waveform estimation {{have been}} investigated for prediction of fetal distress. The umbilical flow was assessed using a number of waveform summary statistics {{in addition to the}} currently used resistance indices. We examined the relationship between umbilical artery waveform patterns and intrauterine growth restriction, preterm delivery and hypertensive disorders. To enhance prediction, we defined waveform skewness profiles based on pivotal points of the umbilical waveform that appeared {{to be related to the}} incidence of preterm delivery and that facilitated construction of IUGR prediction models. The data comprised 204 unselected pregnancies with the umbilical artery images recorded at 18 <b>pregnancy</b> <b>weeks.</b> The sample was divided into 114 pregnancies used to estimate model parameters and 90 pregnancies to validate the model. Logistic prediction models for detection of abnormal velocity waveforms associated with intrauterine growth restriction were derived, based on the waveform information. The estimated model sensitivity and specificity on the training data were 74 % and 84 %, respectively. Validation of the model on independent data yielded a sensitivity of 57 % and specificity of 84 %. The logistic IUGR prediction model appears to have significant predictive ability and potential for clinical use, even at this early gestational age. Our data suggest that prediction of IUGR at 18 <b>pregnancy</b> <b>weeks</b> can be much improved when the waveform shape is captured with a number of summary statistics in addition to resistance indices...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{estimate}} {{the association between}} regular exercise before and during pregnancy and excessive newborn birth weight. METHODS: Using data from the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study, 36, 869 singleton pregnancies lasting at least 37 weeks were included. Information on regular exercise was based on answers from two questionnaires distributed in <b>pregnancy</b> <b>weeks</b> 17 and 30. Linkage to the Medical Birth Registry of Norway provided data on newborn birth weight. The main outcome measure was excessive newborn birth weight, defined as birth weight {{at or above the}} 90 th percentile. Logistic regression analyses were used to {{estimate the}} associations separately for nulliparous (n= 16, 064) and multiparous (n= 20, 805) women, and the results are presented as adjusted odds ratios (aORs) with 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CIs). RESULTS: Excessive newborn birth weight was observed in 4, 033 (10. 9 %) newborns, 56. 1 % (n= 2, 263) of whom were born to multiparous women. An inverse association between regular exercise (at least three times per week) and excessive newborn birth weight in <b>pregnancy</b> <b>weeks</b> 17 and 30 was observed in nulliparous women, aOR 0. 72 (95 % CI 0. 56 - 0. 93) and aOR 0. 77 (95 % CI 0. 61 - 0. 96), respectively. Regular exercise performed before pregnancy did not affect the probability of delivering newborns with an excessive birth weight in nulliparous or multiparous women. CONCLUSION: Regular exercise during pregnancy reduces the odds of giving birth to newborns with excessive birth weight by 23 - 28 %...|$|R

40|$|Background: Women {{with high}} levels of {{physical}} exercise have increased demand for oxygen and nutrients. Thus, in pregnancies of women {{with high levels}} of exercise it is conceivable that the supply of oxygen and nutrients to the placenta is sub-optimal, and growth could be impaired. Objective: To study the association of frequency of exercise during pregnancy with placental weight and placental to birthweight ratio. Study design: A prospective study of 80, 515 singleton pregnancies in the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study. Frequency of exercise was self-reported by a questionnaire at pregnancy weeks 17 and 30. Information on placental weight and birthweight was obtained by linkage to the Medical Birth Registry of Norway. Results: Placental weight decreased with increasing frequency of exercise (tests for trend, P< 0. 001). For non-exercisers in <b>pregnancy</b> <b>week</b> 17, crude mean placental weight was 686. 1 g compared to 667. 3 g in women exercising ≥ 6 times weekly (difference 18. 8 g; 95 % CI: 12. 0 to 25. 5). Likewise, in non-exercisers in <b>pregnancy</b> <b>week</b> 30, crude mean placental weight was 684. 9 g compared to 661. 6 g in women exercising ≥ 6 times weekly (difference 23. 3 g; 95 % CI: 14. 9 to 31. 6). The largest difference in crude mean placental weight were seen between non-exercisers at both time points and women exercising ≥ 6 times weekly at both time points (difference 31. 7 g; 95 % CI: 19. 2 to 44. 2).

The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the former WHO and a simplified version of the new International Association for Diabetes in Pregnancy Study Group (IADPSG) criteria as to prevalence of and risk factors for GDM in a Nordic Caucasian population. Methods. A 75 g oral glucose tolerance test was performed in 687 women at 18 - 22 and 32 - 36 <b>pregnancy</b> <b>weeks.</b> GDM was defined according to the WHO criteria as fasting plasma glucose >= 7. 0 mmol/L and/or 2 -hour plasma glucose >= 7. 8 mmol/L and by a simplified version of the IADPSG criteria as either fasting glucose >= 5. 1 mmol/L and/or 2 -h plasma glucose >= 8. 5 mmol/L. One-hour glucose values were not available and were thus not included in the diagnosis of GDM by IADPSG. Prevalence of GDM during pregnancy and risk factors for GDM at 18 - 22 weeks were studied in retrospect according to each of the two criteria. Results. The total prevalence of GDM during pregnancy was 6. 1 % (42 / 687) for the WHO criteria and 7. 4 % (51 / 687) for the simplified IADPSG criteria. High maternal age and short stature were independently associated with WHO GDM.

The {{aim of this}} study was to investigate alcohol consumption among partners of pregnant women, their motives for changing drinking patterns when becoming a parent and their perception of the midwife’s counseling about alcohol. Method: The study was conducted at 30 antenatal care centers across Sweden in 2009 - 2010.  All partners who accompanied a pregnant women in <b>pregnancy</b> <b>week</b> > 17 were asked to participate. The questionnaire included questions on alcohol consumption. Results: Questionnaires from 444 partners were analyzed. Most, 95 %, of the partners reported alcohol consumption before pregnancy; 18 % were binges drinking (6 standard drinks or more/occasion, each drink containing 12 grams of pure alcohol) at least once every 1 month during the last year. More than half, 56 %, of all partners had decreased their alcohol consumption since pregnancy recognition and a higher proportion of frequent binge drinkers (every month or more often) decreased their alcohol consumption compared to non-frequent binge drinkers (p= 0. 025). Their motives varied; the pregnancy itself, fewer social gatherings (potentially involving drinking) and a sense of responsibility for the pregnant partner were reported. Of the partners, 37 % reported support for decreased drinking from others (pregnant partner, parents, friend or workmates). Most partners appreciated the midwife’s counseling on alcohol. Conclusion: A majority of partners decreased their alcohol consumption in transition to parenthood, which seems to be a crucial time for changing alcohol-drinking patterns. The partners with higher AUDIT-C scores reported more support for decreased drinking. Most partners appreciated the midwife ́s talk about alcohol and pregnancy and those who filled out AUDIT in early pregnancy reported that the counseling was more engaging. During pregnancy it is possible to detect partners with high alcohol consumption, and promote interventions for decreased drinking during pregnancy and parenthood, also for the partners.
