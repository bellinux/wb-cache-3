40|$|Venous leg ulcers {{represent}} a significant {{public health problem}} that will increase as the population ages. Numerous herbs and their extracts are potentially conducive to wound healing, including the ability to serve as antimicrobial, antifungal, astringent etc. The aim {{of the study was}} to establish the in-vivo antimicrobial effects of herbal hydrogel formulation DermaplantG. The major components of the DermaplantG were the extracts of Allii bulbus, Hyperici herba and extract of Calendulae flos. A total of 12 patients with non-infected venous leg ulcers were treated twice daily, for 5 weeks, with new hydrogel formulation. All ulcers showed clinical signs of contamination or colonization without signs of systemic infection. <b>Premoistening</b> the swab with sterile saline was considered when the surface of the wound was dry. The tip of the swab was rolled on its side in a zigzag pattern for at least one full rotation. Standard methods for isolation and identification of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were used. On baseline assessment, a large number of different types of bacteria were detected in all venous leg ulcers. S. aureus and P. aeruginosa were isolated from almost all controls. On baseline, mixed bacterial flora (50 %) was isolated in six venous leg ulcers (five ulcers with S. aureus-P. aeruginosa and one ulcer with E. coli-Enterobacter spp-P. aeruginosa). At the end of the treatment in DermaplantG group in 8 venous ulcers were detected S. aureus (66. 66 %) and P. aeruginosa (16. 66 %), and one venous leg ulcers was detected as sterile (8. 33 %). The number of different types of isolated bacterial species decreased significantly (P< 0. 05) after the use of DermaplantG herbal preparations. Therapy in DermaplantG group was administered without any side effects. The preliminary results of this pilot study demonstrate potential antimicrobial effects of herbal therapy on non-infected venous leg ulcers...|$|E
40|$|Four swab {{materials}} were evaluated for their efficiency in recovery of Bacillus anthracis spores from steel coupons. Cotton, macrofoam, polyester, and rayon swabs {{were used to}} sample coupons inoculated with a spore suspension of known concentration. Three methods of processing {{for the removal of}} spores from the swabs (vortexing, sonication, or minimal agitation) and two swab preparations (<b>premoistened</b> and dry) were evaluated. Results indicated that <b>premoistened</b> swabs were more efficient at recovering spores than dry swabs (14. 3 % vs. 4. 4 %). Vortexing swabs for 2 min during processing resulted in superior extraction of spores when compared to sonicating them for 12 min or subjecting them to minimal agitation. <b>Premoistened</b> macrofoam and cotton swabs that were vortexed during processing recovered the greatest proportions of spores with a mean recovery of 43. 6 % (standard deviation [SD] 11. 1 %) and 41. 7 % (SD 14. 6 %), respectively. <b>Premoistened</b> and vortexed polyester and rayon swabs were less efficient, a...|$|R

40|$|The {{results of}} a {{laboratory}} investigation on the early autogenous shrinkage of high strength concrete, and the possibilities of its reduction, are presented. Such concrete demonstrates significant autogenous shrinkage, which should, however, be limited {{in the early stages}} of its development in order to prevent the occurrence of cracks and/or drop in the load-carrying capacity of concrete structures. The following possibilities for reducing autogenous shrinkage were investigated: the use of low-heat cement, a shrinkage-reducing admixture, steel fibres, <b>premoistened</b> polypropylene fibres, and presoaked lightweight aggregate. In the case of the use of presoaked natural lightweight aggregate, with a fraction from 2 to 4 [*]mm, the early autogenous shrinkage of one-day-old high strength concrete decreased by about 90 %, with no change to the concrete's compressive strength in comparison with that of the reference concrete...|$|R

Their ability to assimilate alkylbenzenes (toxic environmental pollutants) enhances their growth in harsh conditions, including on railway ties. Samples were collected using cotton swabs, <b>premoistened</b> with physiological saline, from 658 oak and concrete railway ties at six train stations in Turkey at altitudes ranging between 1026 and 1427 m.

40|$|Despite the {{overwhelming}} importance of earthworm {{activity in the}} soil system, there are {{a limited number of}} studies that have examined the impact resulting from biochar addition to soil. Biochar is part of the black carbon continuum of chemo-thermal converted biomass. This review summarizes existing data pertaining to earthworms where biochar and other black carbon substances, including slash-and-burn charcoals and wood ash, have been applied. After analyzing existing studies on black carbon, we identified that these additions have a range from short-term negative impacts to long-term null effects on earthworm population density and total biomass. Documented cases of mortality were found with certain biochar-soil combinations; the cause is not fully understood, but hypothesized to be related to pH, whether the black carbon is <b>premoistened,</b> affects feeding behaviors, or other unknown factors. With wood ashes, negative impacts were overcome with addition of other carbon substrates. Given that field data is limited, soils amended with biochar did not appear to cause significant long-term impacts. However, this may indicate that the magnitude of short-term negative impacts on earthworm populations can be reduced with time...|$|R

40|$|Introduction. Emergence of MRSA infections among {{previously}} healthy {{persons in}} community settings (without exposure {{to health care}} facilities) has been noted recently. MRSA infections are now classified as health care-associated MRSA (HA-MRSA) and community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA) infections. Its colonization is an important risk factor for subsequent MRSA infection. Aims and Objectives. The aim was to screen patients and health care workers for staphylococcal carriage, identify risk factors for MRSA colonization, and determine the sensitivity pattern. Materials and Methods. A total of 200 subjects were screened for nasal carriage after obtaining verbal consent. These were both healthy subjects attending various outpatient departments and health care workers. Specimens were collected from the anterior nares using <b>premoistened</b> sterile cotton swabs and inoculated onto blood agar and mannitol salt agar and incubated at 37 °C for 24 – 48 [*]h. Results. Staphylococcus aureus colonisation {{was found to be}} 12 % (n= 24). MRSA was identified in 5 % (n= 10) which represents 41. 66 % of SA. A total of 10 strains of MRSA were isolated from 200 subjects, giving an overall positivity rate of 5 %. Discussion. Staphylococcal colonization was found to be 12 % (MRSA 5 %).

40|$|Bigtooth maple (Acer grandidentatum) has {{potential}} as a small, water conserving landscape tree in western landscapes. This potential has been hindered {{in part by the}} difficulty in asexually propagating superior accessions. The ability of etiolation to enhance rooting of softwood cuttings of selected wild accessions was determined by grafting six accessions onto seedling rootstocks to use as stock plants. Etiolation was applied to stock plants by placing open-ended, black, velour, drawstring bags over the end of pruned shoots at bud swell allowing new shoots to develop and grow out the end of the bag while leaving the base of the shoot covered. In 2009 and 2010, cuttings from etiolated and nonetiolated shoots were treated with 4000 ppm indole- 3 -butyric acid (IBA) + 2000 ppm naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA), stuck in a <b>premoistened</b> 3 perlite: 1 peat (by volume) rooting substrate and placed under intermittent mist. After 4 weeks, 89 % (2009) and 85 % (2010) of the etiolated cuttings rooted and only 47 % (2009) and 17 % (2010) of the nonetiolated cuttings rooted. Etiolated cuttings produced on average 11. 3 (2009) and 7. 2 (2010) roots per cutting and nonetiolated 2. 1 (2009) and 0. 5 (2010) roots per cutting.

40|$|OBJECTIVE We {{sought to}} {{determine}} whether the bacterial burden in the nares, as determined by the cycle threshold (CT) value from real-time MRSA PCR, is predictive of environmental contamination with MRSA. METHODS Patients identified as MRSA nasal carriers per hospital protocol were enrolled within 72 hours of room admission. Patients were excluded if (1) nasal mupirocin or chlorhexidine body wash was used within the past month or (2) an active MRSA infection was suspected. Four environmental sites, 6 body sites and a wound, if present, were cultured with <b>premoistened</b> swabs. All nasal swabs were submitted for both a quantitative culture and real-time PCR (Roche Lightcycler, Indianapolis, IN). RESULTS At study enrollment, 82 patients had a positive MRSA-PCR. A negative correlation of moderate strength was observed between the CT value and the number of MRSA colonies in the nares (r=− 0. 61; P< 0. 01). Current antibiotic use was associated with lower levels of MRSA nasal colonization (CT value, 30. 2 vs 27. 7; P< 0. 01). Patients with concomitant environmental contamination had a higher median log MRSA nares count (3. 9 vs 2. 5, P= 0. 01) and lower CT values (28. 0 vs 30. 2; P< 0. 01). However, a ROC curve was unable to identify a threshold MRSA nares count that reliably excluded environmental contamination. CONCLUSIONS Patients with a higher burden of MRSA in their nares, based on the CT value, were more likely to contaminate their environment with MRSA. However, contamination of the environment cannot be predicted solely by the degree of MRSA nasal colonization...|$|R
40|$|Helicopter-borne {{observations}} {{of the impact of}} turbulent mixing and cloud microphysical properties in shallow trade wind cumuli are presented. The measurements were collected during the Cloud, Aerosol, Radiation and Turbulence in the Trade Wind Regime over Barbados (CARRIBA) project. Basic meteorological parameters (3 D wind vector, air temperature, and relative humidity), cloud condensation nuclei concentrations, and cloud microphysical parameters (droplet number, size distribution, and liquid water content) are measured by the Airborne Cloud Turbulence Observation System (ACTOS), which is fixed by a 160 -m-long rope underneath a helicopter flying with a true airspeed of approximately 20 m s(- 1). Clouds at different evolutionary stages were sampled. A total of 300 clouds are classified into actively growing, decelerated, and dissolving clouds. The mixing process of these cloud categories is investigated by correlating the cloud droplet number concentration and cubed droplet mean volume diameter. A significant tendency to more inhomogeneous mixing with increasing cloud lifetime is observed. Furthermore, the mixing process and its effects on droplet number concentration, droplet size, and cloud liquid water content are statistically evaluated. It is found that, in dissolving clouds, liquid water content and droplet number concentration are decreased by about 50 % compared to actively growing clouds. Conversely, the droplet size remains almost constant, which {{can be attributed to the}} existence of a humid shell around the cloud that prevents cloud droplets from rapid evaporation after entrainment of <b>premoistened</b> air. Moreover, signs of secondary activation are found, which results in a more difficult interpretation of observed mixing diagrams...|$|R
40|$|Greater {{care and}} a more {{thorough}} approach to intravenous catheter site disinfection may be important {{for the prevention of}} catheter related sepsis, especially with coagulase negative staphylocci in preterm infants. The efficacy of skin disinfection was evaluated in preterm infants using a skin swabbing technique after disinfectant exposure. In {{the first part of the}} study, 25 peripheral intravascular catheter sites were quantitatively sampled immediately after routine cannula insertion. Bacterial counts greater than 100 colony forming units/cm 2 were observed from 10 (40 %) sites. In the second part, sampling for bacterial colony counts was done after skin cleansing with various durations of exposure of chlorhexidine/alcohol swabs or povidone iodine. The overall mean reduction in bacterial colony counts after skin cleansing ranged from 90 - 99 %. Skin sterilisation was achieved in 33 - 92 % of cases. The use of two consecutive 10 second exposures resulted in a significantly improved reduction in colony counts compared with a single 10 second wipe. A longer 30 second exposure also resulted in a greater reduction of bacterial numbers compared with a shorter duration of 5 or 10 seconds. Repopulation of disinfected sites occurred within 48 hours. This effect was delayed by occluding the cleansed site with a semipermeable dressing. There were no significant differences between povidone iodine and the chlorhexidine swabs in reducing bacterial numbers. This study has demonstrated that a brief exposure with a <b>premoistened</b> disinfectant swab is not sufficient for complete elimination of resident skin flora of newborn infants. The use of two consecutive cleanings, or a longer duration of cleansing is recommended for more effective skin sterilisation...|$|R
40|$|The water-drop method (WDM) is a {{long-established}} {{and excellent}} means of measuring soil aggregate stability. While the WDM is very reliable, {{it has a}} drawback in that it requires manual observation of aggregate breakdown and a manual count {{of the number of}} water drops required to disperse a soil aggregate. This makes the method inconvenient and prone to error. To avoid this drawback, we propose a procedure that utilizes digital observations of aggregate breakdown and electronic recording of the water-drop count. In this procedure, water drops from a Mariotte’s tube pass through an electronic device that records the passage of each drop. The impact of water drops on the soil aggregate is digitally recorded with a camcorder. From the drop count and aggregate breakdown records, the number of water drops that strike an aggregate until it is dispersed can be determined. This procedure was evaluated using soil samples from the surface of four different soils. With the automated method, we determined the number of 4. 3 -mm-diam. water drops, each having energy of 1. 67 mJ, required to destroy a 4. 00 - to 4. 75 -mm-diam. aggregate, <b>premoistened</b> to a matric suction of 10 kPa, until it passed through a 2. 8 -mm sieve. The WDM was conducted both manually and with the automated method and the results were compared using analysis of variance (ANOVA). Twenty aggregates were used for each soil in both methods. There were no significant differences (P < 0. 10) between the automated and manual methods in the mean energy required to break an aggregate.

40|$|The {{most common}} cause of {{significant}} intra-operative bleeding is inadequate surgical hemostasis. Nearly all reviews of intra-operative and early post-operative bleeding point that 75 % to 90 % of all bleeding is technical in nature. Whatever the cause, uncontrolled bleeding can lead to a combination of factors which may further exacerbate the problem of a vicious bloody circle. Dilutional thrombocytopenia, platelet dysfunction and consumption of clotting factors present a difficult problem to address as continual blood loss continue to compound the problem while blood component replacement therapy attempts to correct the deficiency. Our study aims to compare haemostatic efficacy of different grades of chitosan compared to the common haemostatic surgical hemostats. We hypothesize that chitosan based hemostats are superior to the common surgical hemostats in inducing platelet aggregation, affecting Prothrombin Time and Partial Thromboplastin Time and red cell aggregation. There were two parts to the study. In the in vitro study blood sample was obtained from the blood bank. Blood sample was collected utilizing the CP 2 D/AS- 3 systems with additive solution (AS- 3,Nutricel®) to maintain red blood cell viability. Collected whole blood was separated into four separate components (whole blood, heparinized whole blood, platelet rich and platelet poor plasma). In the platelet aggregation test, stirred citrated PRP was contacted with 3. 5 mg of each haemostatic agent <b>premoistened</b> with 100 micro liter of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) in a test tube (as would be used in traditional platelet aggregometry). Aliquots of supernatant (100 micro liter) were removed every 5 minute for a total of 15 minutes and the platelet count was measured in triplicate utilizing an electronic cell counter (XT 2000 i Sysmax Analyzer, Sysmex America Inc., Mundelein, Illinois); platelet counts from each experimental aliquot were normalized using counts from unreacted PRP. For each haemostatic agent three independent sets of experiments were performed. A similar set of platelet aggregation experiments was performed using the haemostatic sponge agents (3 Different grades of Chitosan, Lyostypt®, and Surgicel®) <b>premoistened</b> with PBS. In the PT/PTT test, each haemostatic agent was reacted with platelet rich and platelet poor plasma. The serum was centrifuged to remove possible deposition. Six parallel experiments were conducted to measure PT and APTT of the serum using a hemostasis analyzer (Stago STA Compact Haemostatic Analyzer, Diamond Diagnostics, MA. USA) In the red cell aggregation test, each haemostatic agent was reacted with whole blood, heparinized blood and platelet poor blood. The blood with haemostatic agents were left to stand and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate was measured with the Sedy 400 sedimentation analyzer. In the animal experiment, 36 Sprague-Dawley rats were utilized. Under general anesthesia, via a midline laparotomy the right and left kidneys were isolated. Heminephrectomies were carried out and hemostats were applied to the cut surface and time taken to hemostasis was tabulated. In the platelet aggregation test, no definite trend in platelet aggregation was observed. No CMC 36 3 % showed the lowest platelet count of all haemostatic agents at 5 minutes. Lyostypt® and Surgicel® were superior compared to chitosan hemostats at 10 minutes of contact. In the coagulation test (PT/PTT) mean prothrombin time for Chitosan (NoCMC 8 %) was the shortest in platelet rich plasma. Mean partial thromboplastin time was the shortest for Chitosan (NoCMC 3 %) in platelet rich plasma. In platelet poor plasma, the shortest prothrombin time was seen in both the Chitosan hemostats(NoCMC 3 % and NoCMC 8 %). Partial thromboplastin time was shortest for Chitosan (NoCMC 3 %) hemostat. In the red cell aggregation test, Chitosan hemostat(NoCMC 3 %) demonstrated the highest erythrocyte sedimentation ratio in platelet poor blood as well as heparinized blood specimens. Chitosan hemostat (NoCMC 8 %) demonstrated the highest erythrocyte sedimentation ratio in heparinized whole blood. In the animal experiment, there was no statistical difference between the hemostats in arresting bleeding from heminephrectomy specimens. The Chitosan hemostat(NoCMC 36 3 %) however demonstrated the shortest time to hemostasis compared to the otherhemostats. From the study we concluded that Chitosan hemostats causes platelet to aggregate the earliest compared to other hemostats. They shorten prothrombin and partial thromboplastin time. They have been also found to aggregate red blood cells the most compared to other haemostatic agents...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: we {{compared}} {{the effectiveness of a}} 3 -in- 1 perineal care washcloth versus standard of care (water and pH neutral soap) to prevent and treat incontinence-associated dermatitis (IAD). The product under study was a soft, <b>premoistened</b> washcloth, including a 3 % dimethicone formula, with cleansing, moisturizing, and barrier protection properties. Design: randomized, controlled clinical trial. Subjects and setting: the study sample comprised a random sample of 11 nursing home wards (6 experimental and 5 control) in a convenience sample of 4 nursing homes in Belgium. The sample included nursing home residents at risk for and/or affected by IAD defined as incontinent of urine, feces, urine/feces, and/or having erythema of the perineal skin (not caused by pressure/shear), and/or having an edematous skin in the genital area. Methods: participants in the experimental group were treated according to a standardized protocol, including the use of a 3 -in- 1 perineal care washcloth impregnated with a 3 % dimethicone skin protectant. Participants in the control group received perineal skin care with water and pH neutral soap, the standard of care in Belgian nursing homes. The study period was 120 days. Data were collected between February and May 2010. Incontinence-associated dermatitis prevalence and severity were assessed using the IAD Skin Condition Assessment Tool. The surface (cm 2), redness, and depth of the perineal lesion were assessed daily by the nurses. This tool generates a cumulative severity score (maximum score = 10) based on area of skin affected, degree of redness, and depth of erosion. Results: four hundred sixty-four nursing home residents were assessed and 32. 9 % (n = 141) met the criteria for inclusion, including 73 subjects in the experimental group and 68 in the control group. Baseline IAD prevalence was comparable in both groups (experimental: 22. 3 % vs control: 22. 8 %, P =. 76). Baseline IAD severity was 6. 9 / 10 in the experimental group and 7. 3 / 10 in the control group. A significant intervention effect on IAD prevalence was found (experimental: 8. 1 % vs control: 27. 1 %, F = 3. 1, P =. 003). A nonsignificant effect on IAD severity could be determined (experimental: 3. 8 / 10 vs control: 6. 9 / 10, F = 0. 8, P =. 06). Conclusion: the use of a 3 -in- 1 washcloth, impregnated with a 3 % dimethicone formula, resulted in a significantly reduced prevalence of IAD and a trend toward less severe lesions. These findings provide indicative evidence for the use of 3 -in- 1 perineal care washcloth as an effective intervention against the use of water and a pH neutral soap to prevent and/or treat IA...|$|R
