5|$|More than $200,000 {{was spent}} between August 24 and September 26 {{inspecting}} the structure. The National Park Service {{said that it}} would soon begin sealing the exterior cracks on the monument to <b>protect</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> rain and snow.|$|E
5|$|A {{distinct}} {{group of}} DNA-binding proteins is the DNA-binding proteins that specifically bind single-stranded DNA. In humans, replication protein A is the best-understood {{member of this}} family and is used in processes where the double helix is separated, including DNA replication, recombination, and DNA repair. These binding proteins seem to stabilize single-stranded DNA and <b>protect</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> forming stem-loops or being degraded by nucleases.|$|E

5|$|Gas metal {{arc welding}} (GMAW) – {{commonly}} termed MIG (metal, inert gas), uses a wire feeding gun that feeds wire at an adjustable speed and flows an argon-based shielding gas or a mix of argon and carbon dioxide (CO2) over the weld puddle to <b>protect</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> atmospheric contamination.|$|E
5|$|Stainless steel {{provided}} {{many benefits}} over traditional wood and hardened steel for railroad carbodies; {{it was a}} lighter and stronger material, and its natural silver appearance and resistance to corrosion meant {{that it would not}} have to be painted to <b>protect</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> the weather. Since the carbody was much lighter than similar cars, it would be able to carry a higher revenue load for the same cost.|$|E
5|$|Trees {{much older}} than 10,000 years would be {{practically}} impossible in Sweden, because until around 11,000 years ago the area was {{in the grip of}} a world-wide ice age. Nature conservancy authorities considered putting a fence around the tree to <b>protect</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> possible vandals or trophy hunters.|$|E

5|$|After the war, the Boy Scout Association bought {{adjoining}} land {{to increase the}} estate and <b>protect</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> rapidly approaching new developments. These areas are called The Quick, New Field, and Hilly Field. An additional purchase and a donation from South Africa in the early 1950s brought the estate to its present size. This began an era of expanding camping facilities for Scouts which lasted until the early 1960s. Training and sleeping facilities were added through the early 1970s. The Boy Scout Association was renamed The Scout Association in 1967.|$|E
5|$|Although {{ytterbium}} {{is fairly}} stable chemically, it {{is stored in}} airtight containers and in an inert atmosphere such as a nitrogen-filled dry box to <b>protect</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> air and moisture. All compounds of ytterbium are treated as highly toxic, although studies appear {{to indicate that the}} danger is minimal. However, ytterbium compounds cause irritation to human skin and eyes, and some might be teratogenic. Metallic ytterbium dust can spontaneously combust, and the resulting fumes are hazardous. Ytterbium fires cannot be extinguished using water, and only dry chemical class D fire extinguishers can extinguish the fires.|$|E
5|$|An {{elephant}} uses mud as a sunscreen, protecting {{its skin}} from ultraviolet light. Although tough, an elephant's skin is very sensitive. Without regular mud baths to <b>protect</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> burning, insect bites and moisture loss, an elephant's skin suffers serious damage. After bathing, the elephant will usually use its trunk to blow dust onto its body and this dries into a protective crust. Elephants have difficulty releasing heat {{through the skin}} because of their low surface-area-to-volume ratio, which is many times smaller {{than that of a}} human. They have even been observed lifting up their legs, presumably in an effort to expose their soles to the air.|$|E

5|$|Burying beetles are {{attentive}} parents, {{and participate}} in cooperative care and feeding of their offspring. Both parents work to bury small animal carcass {{to serve as a}} food resource for their young and build a brood chamber around it. The parents prepare the carcass and <b>protect</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> competitors and from early decomposition. After their eggs hatch, the parents keep the larvae clean of fungus and bacteria and help the larvae feed by regurgitating food for them.|$|E
5|$|Calabria was {{designed}} for use in Italy's colonial empire, rather than the earlier vessels intended as fleet scouts. As such, her steel hull was sheathed with wood and then a layer of zinc to <b>protect</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> fouling during lengthy tours in the overseas colonies. Additionally, she was equipped with less powerful though more efficient engines than the earlier cruisers. The ship was otherwise similar to preceding designs like the Regioni class, having a displacement only slightly lower and a nearly identical gun battery.|$|E
5|$|Filmed in full scale, {{the school}} {{explosion}} used drywall around {{the interior of}} the set to <b>protect</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> the fire. Physical effects supervisor Gary Monak oversaw the explosion. The destruction surprised the cast as they were more used to optical effects in the series. Costume designer Robert Blackman created the Vedek costumes. Crew-members suggested that Blackman based his Vedek hats on the form of the Sydney Opera House, but Blackman denied the design was deliberate.|$|E

5|$|Heraclius {{abandoned}} Syria {{with the}} holy relic of the True Cross which was, along with other relics held at Jerusalem, secretly boarded on ship by Parthia of Jerusalem, just to <b>protect</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> the invading Arabs. It is said that the emperor had a fear of water. and a pontoon bridge was made for Heraclius to cross the Bosphorus to Constantinople. After abandoning Syria, the Emperor began to concentrate on his remaining forces for the defence of Anatolia and Egypt instead. Byzantine Armenia fell to the Muslims in 638–39, after which Heraclius created a buffer zone in central Anatolia by ordering all the forts east of Tarsus to be evacuated.|$|E
5|$|Hill {{called the}} {{attention}} of the Nebraska State Historical Society (NSHS) to the site and, in 1924, joined representatives of the Society in conducting further excavations, showing that a village of considerable size had existed there. In 1925, to ensure archaeological access to the site and to <b>protect</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> relic-hunting, he bought the two farms on whose land it lay. Between 1924 and 1930, he excavated two lodges and over fifty graves.|$|E
5|$|In November 2015, Varian {{announced}} {{that she would be}} working with the California Rangeland Trust to place her ranch into a conservation easement to <b>protect</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> development. She had begun the project with the intent that her longtime ranch manager, Angela Alvarez, would operate the horse breeding program after Varian was no longer able to do so, and then once Alvarez was no longer able to run the ranch, the property would be gifted to the Trust to be sold, the conservation easement running with the land, and attempts made to find a buyer that would also be interested in maintaining the Arabian horse breeding program.|$|E

5|$|Ludlow Castle {{was in the}} {{wardship}} of King Henry IV, {{when the}} Owain Glyndŵr revolt broke out across Wales. Military captains were appointed to the castle to <b>protect</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> the rebel threat, {{in the first instance}} John Lovel and then Henry's half-brother, Sir Thomas Beaufort. Roger Mortimer's younger brother, Edmund, set out from the castle with an army against the rebels in 1402, but was captured at the Battle of Bryn Glas. Henry refused to ransom him, and he eventually married one of Glyndŵr's daughters, before dying during the siege of Harlech Castle in 1409.|$|E
5|$|Mari is not {{considered}} a small settlement that later grew, but rather a new city that was purposely founded during the Mesopotamian Early Dynastic period I c. 2900 BC, to control the waterways of the Euphrates trade routes that connect the Levant with the Sumerian south. The city was built about 1 to 2 kilometers away from the Euphrates river to <b>protect</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> floods, and {{was connected to the}} river by an artificial canal that was between 7 and 10 kilometers long depending on which old meander it used to be attached with, which is hard to identify today.|$|E
5|$|No. 71 Maintenance Unit RAF in Slough {{came under}} {{control of the}} Ruislip depot in January 1941. The {{increase}} in personnel lead to {{an extension of the}} station canteen in May. Additionally, a Navy, Army and Air Force Institutes (NAAFI) canteen was built on the RAF Blenheim Crescent site on 6 May. In order to <b>protect</b> <b>it</b> <b>from</b> potential enemy bombing, the majority of the Records Office was moved to a temporary base in Gloucester on 10 May.|$|E
