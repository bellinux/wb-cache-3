40|$|Background: Available {{restorative}} {{space and}} bar height {{is an important}} factor in stress distribution of implant-supported overdentures. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of different vertical restorative spaces and different bar heights on the stress distribution around implants by 3 D finite element analysis. Materials and Methods: 3 D finite element models were developed from mandibular overdentures with two implants in the interforaminal region. In these models, four different bar heights from gingival crest (0. 5, 1, 1. 5, 2 mm) with 15 mm occlusal <b>plane</b> <b>height</b> and three different occlusal <b>plane</b> <b>heights</b> from gingival crest (9, 12, 15 mm) with 2 mm bar height were analyzed. A vertical unilateral and a bilateral load of 150 N were applied to the central occlusal fossa of the first molar and the stress of bone around implant was analyzed by finite element analysis. Results: By increasing vertical restorative space, the maximum stress values around implants were found to be decreased in unilateral loading models but slightly increased in bilateral loading cases. By increasing bar height from gingival crest, the maximum stress values around implants were found to be increased in unilateral loading models but slightly decreased in bilateral loading cases. In unilateral loading models, maximum stress was found in a model with 9 mm occlusal <b>plane</b> <b>height</b> and 1. 5 mm bar height (6. 254 MPa), but in bilateral loading cases, maximum stress was found in a model with 15 mm occlusal <b>plane</b> <b>height</b> and 0. 5 mm bar height (3. 482 MPa). Conclusion: The reduction of bar height and increase in the thickness of acrylic resin base in implant-supported overdentures are biomechanically favorable and may result in less stress in periimplant bone...|$|R

40|$|Numerical {{simulations}} of fire-induced smoke {{movement in the}} stairwell of a high-rise building are conducted using FDS, version 6. 0. 1, with default settings. Twelve scenarios are considered. The required fineness of the grid has been determined in earlier work by considering both the fire source and the vent flow, and by assessing the velocity profile at the bottom opening and the vertical distribution of temperature in the stairwell. In the present study, the results including the airflow velocity at the bottom opening, vertical distribution of temperature, the temperature at the middle opening, pressure distribution, and neutral <b>plane</b> <b>height</b> in the stairwell, are compared to experimental data. For the average velocity through the bottom opening, a maximum deviation of 16. 23 % is obtained. Good agreement is achieved for the vertical temperature inside the stairwell (maximum relative deviation of 12. 3 %). By analyzing the temperature at the middle opening, {{it is found that}} the smoke moves faster than in the experiment. The influence of the staircase on the pressure distribution is demonstrated by comparing two cases: one with and one without staircase. The difference between the pressure inside the stairwell and the pressure outside increases with height, due to fire-induced buoyancy. However, the pressure difference evolution is non-monotonic when there are staircases inside the stairwell. The neutral <b>plane</b> <b>height</b> value, as obtained by post-processing the simulation results, is too high in the simulations, compared to experimental data and the corresponding analytical expression.

40|$|Objective. Intertester {{reliability}} {{is imperative}} during the sonographic assessment of patellar tendinopathy because hypoechoic areas can change over time, and repeated examination may involve multiple examiners. Given that, to our knowledge, {{it has not}} been reported in the literature, the objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the intertester reliability of sonography for the detection and measurement of hypoechoic areas associated with patellar tendinopathy. Methods. The study cohort comprised 8 patients with clinically diagnosed patellar tendinopathy and 4 patients with bilateral asymptomatic patellar tendons. Two equally experienced musculoskeletal radiologists imaged both patellar tendons from each patient (n = 24). All 24 tendons were assessed on the same day with the use of identical sonography machines. Results. The radiologists had 100 % chance-corrected agreement for detecting 12 normal (hypoechoic free) and 12 abnormal (hypoechoic) tendons. All measurement data were normally distributed (P >. 05), and a range of hypoechoic area sizes was evident. No statistically significant differences were found for the measurements of hypoechoic area, axial <b>plane</b> <b>height</b> and width, and sagittal <b>plane</b> <b>height</b> (P >. 05). In addition, these measurements were equally highly correlated (Pearson r > 0. 87; P <. 01). Conclusions. The results reported in this study suggest that the intertester reliability of sonography for the assessment of patellar tendinopathy is high. Although these results are encouraging, a small sample was analyzed, and this increases the probability of type II measurement error. Larger studies are therefore required to confirm these findings. High intertester reliability indicates that multiple experienced radiologists can reliably assess the same tendon and provides researchers with a necessary foundation for furthering research in tendon rehabilitation. <br /...|$|R

40|$|Numerical {{simulations}} {{are conducted}} {{to investigate the}} accuracy of the fire dynamics simulator (FDS 6. 0. 1) for under-ventilated enclosure fires with external flaming. The accuracy is discussed first in terms of mass balance at the steady-state stage for the enclosure volume. The required fineness of the grid is determined by analyzing the mass balance using two non-dimensional length scales. The first considers the ratio of the ventilation factor to the grid cell size, and the second considers the ratio of the hydraulic diameter of the opening to the grid cell size. When these two length scales are larger than 10, the corresponding mass balance error as obtained from post-processing the output is lower than 4 %. The simulation results, including flow through the vertical opening, heat release rate inside the enclosure, gas temperature inside the enclosure, neutral <b>plane</b> <b>height,</b> and external flame height are compared with experimental data and empirical correlations. The air inflow rate through the opening is found to correlate linearly to the ventilation factor as m˙= 0. 41 *A*H^(1 / 2). For the heat release rate inside the enclosure, the predictions follow the empirical correlation Qin= 1131 *A*H^(1 / 2). This {{is directly related to the}} air inflow rate and incomplete combustion with the inflowing oxygen. Time-averaged gas temperatures inside the enclosure are under-predicted by maximum 13. 1 % compared with experimental data at the corner near the opening. Neutral <b>plane</b> <b>height</b> values at the opening, determined from the velocity profile of the vent flow, show good agreement with empirical estimations (Zf= 0. 4 ⋅H).

When {{large-scale}} images acquisition {{conducted on}} an Integrated Circuit (IC) chip {{by using an}} optical microscope, multi-layer routing structure and transparent inter-layer dielectric of IC chips can interfere with auto-focusing of an optical microscope, which significantly increases the images’ acquisition time.

50|$|When {{using the}} AFM to image a sample, the tip {{is brought into}} contact with the sample, and the sample is raster scanned along an x-y grid (fig 4).

As long as the tip remains in contact with the sample, and the sample is scanned in the x-y <b>plane,</b> <b>height</b> variations in the sample will change the deflection of the cantilever.

In this situation, the feedback output equals the sample surface topography to within a small error.|$|R
