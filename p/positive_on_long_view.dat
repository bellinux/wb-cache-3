Using district level panels for 42 years from India and dynamic panel estimation procedure we estimate the impact of weather risk on cropping intensity. Our non-stationary and dynamic panel model results suggest that the impact of weather risk on cropping intensity, in rural India, is negative on short run, while it is <b>positive</b> <b>on</b> <b>long</b> run. Additionally, we found a negative effect of education on cropping intensity.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{establish}} a hindfoot alignment measurement technique based on low-dose biplanar radiographs and compare with hindfoot alignment measurements <b>on</b> <b>long</b> axial <b>view</b> radiographs, {{which is the}} current reference standard. MATERIALS AND METHODS: <b>Long</b> axial <b>view</b> radiographs and low-dose biplanar radiographs of a phantom consisting of a human foot skeleton embedded in acrylic glass (phantom A) and a plastic model of a human foot in three different hindfoot positions (phantoms B 1 -B 3) were imaged in different foot positions (20 ° internal to 20 ° external rotation). Two independent readers measured hindfoot alignment <b>on</b> <b>long</b> axial <b>view</b> radiographs and performed 3 D hindfoot alignment measurements based on biplanar radiographs on two different occasions. Time for three-dimensional (3 D) measurements was determined. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were calculated. RESULTS: Hindfoot alignment measurements <b>on</b> <b>long</b> axial <b>view</b> radiographs were characterized by a large positional variation, {{with a range of}} 14 °/ 13 ° valgus to 22 °/ 27 ° varus (reader 1 / 2 for phantom A), whereas the range of 3 D hindfoot alignment measurements was 7. 3 °/ 6. 0 ° to 9. 0 °/ 10. 5 ° varus (reader 1 / 2 for phantom A), with a mean and standard deviation of 8. 1 °[*]±[*] 0. 6 / 8. 7 °[*]±[*] 1. 4 respectively. Interobserver agreement was high (ICC[*]=[*] 0. 926 for phantom A, and ICC[*]=[*] 0. 886 for phantoms B 1 -B 3), and agreement between different readouts was high (ICC[*]=[*] 0. 895 - 0. 995 for reader 1, and ICC[*]=[*] 0. 987 - 0. 994 for reader 2) for 3 D measurements. Mean duration of 3 D measurements was 84 [*]±[*] 15 / 113 [*]±[*] 15  s for reader 1 / 2. CONCLUSION: Three-dimensional hindfoot alignment measurements based on biplanar radiographs were independent of foot positioning during image acquisition and reader independent. In this phantom study, the 3 D measurements were substantially more precise than the standard radiographic measurements...|$|R

40|$|This {{analysis}} {{offers a}} contingency model of mayoral leadership based <b>on</b> a <b>long</b> <b>view</b> of a city’s institutional context and substantive interests. This model generates four distinct governance types or styles of mayoral administration—populism, progressivism, constitutionalism, and managerialism. The author uses empirical evidence drawn from familiar mayoral administrations to analyze shifts {{within and across}} these governance types. By integrating normative public administration into the dynamics of urban governance, this model yields robust findings con-cerning mayoral–regime relationships. The author concludes that the renewal of a fiscally stressed big city is in facilitative governance. Facilitative governance blends managerialism and constitutionalism, whereas its normative basis is democratic conservatorship. By activating the ethos of public administration, a mayoral conservator facilitates the regime conditions necessary for economic, political, and social inclusion...|$|R

Ambidexterity, which {{is defined as}} the ability of an organisation to simultaneously engage in exploitation of current organisational capabilities and exploration of future opportunities, is said to have a <b>positive</b> impact <b>on</b> <b>long</b> term financial performance and innovations among many other firm level outcomes. However, review of extant literature shows that the linkage between ambidexterity and firm outcomes is not linear and its study warrants further investigation in order to develop deeper insights. Theory building in the ambidexterity literature from a Human Resource Management perspective, is hampered by lack of clarity on several issues such as- level of analysis, specific HRM variables, as well as the role of antecedent and intervening variables. This paper reviews past research and proposes a model in order to explain ‘why’ and ‘how’ Ambidextrous Human Resource practices impact performance at an individual level. In doing so, it proposes causal linkages between key constructs namely, ‘Ambidextrous HR practices, Organisational Culture, Middle manager’s ambidextrous behavioral orientation, and Individual Ambidexterity and their impact on employee level performance outcomes...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the effect of macroeconomic conditions on capital structure choices of listed South African firms. Three variables were identified to be of interest, namely: real gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate, inflation rate, and unemployment rate. The sample consisted of 230 listed firms, and analysis was done through fixed-effect regression. Macroeconomic variables were found to have an effect on capital structure choice of firms. Real GDP growth was found to have a <b>positive</b> influence <b>on</b> <b>long</b> term and overall leverage. Whilst inflation was found to have a negative effect <b>on</b> <b>long</b> term and overall leverage. Unemployment rate, on the other hand, was found to positively influence long term leverage, short term leverage and overall leverage. The findings from this study on the influence of both real GDP growth and inflation on leverage suggest that firm management make decisions on issuance of short term debt in a different manner to long term debt. The same was not true with unemployment rate though, this variable influenced both types for leverage in a similar manner. These findings have some implications for how managers should think about macroeconomic changes when making decisions on their firm‟s capital structure.
