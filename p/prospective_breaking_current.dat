50|$|A {{modified}} version of the interrupter was produced by Henry Letheby which could output only the make, or only the <b>break</b> <b>currents</b> by a mechanism consisting of two spoked wheels.

Both designs suffered from the disadvantage that automatic operation was lost and the interrupter had to once again be hand-cranked. Nevertheless, this arrangement remained a cheaper option than electromagnetic generators for some time.|$|R

40|$|Abstract – The {{results of}} {{electro-discharge}} proc-esses in vacuum arc interrupters on the developed and constructed synthetic test stand are described. The stand ensures a current amplitude up to 100 kA {{with a duration}} of 10 ± 1 ms at a voltage up to 5 kV and an amplitude of transient recovery voltage up to 40 kV. It contains two circuits working synchro-nously: a current pulse generator with the total capacity of 0. 073 F (with a power of ~ 0. 9 MJ at 5 kV) and a voltage pulse generator with an operating volt-age 40 kV (with the power equal to 0. 32 MJ at 40 kV). There is also a complex of control and measuring equipment which allows one to register current through the circuit-breaker being tested, measure arc voltage when the circuit-breaker contacts are opened and determine the form of the transient recovery voltage curve. The research carried out has allowed constructing a vacuum arc interrupter with a rated voltage of 10 kV, a rated current of 3, 150 A, a rated short-circuit <b>breaking</b> <b>current</b> of 40 kA and a vacuum circuit breaker VVE-(S) M- 10 - 40 / 3150 on its basis.

Bird's (and Page's) interrupter had the medically disadvantageous feature that current was supplied in opposite directions during the make and break operations, although the current was substantially less during the make operation than the <b>break</b> (<b>current</b> is only supplied at all while the switch is dynamically changing).
