40|$|Abstract — Today’s Push-to-talk (PTT) {{services}} are infrastructure based and require stable end-to-end paths for successful communication. However, users with PTT enabled mobile devices may roam in challenged environments where infrastructure is not available. In such cases the traditional PTT services may exhibit poor performance or even fail completely. Delay-Tolerant Networking (DTN) {{is a research}} area which addresses the communication requirements specific to challenged networks. In this paper, we apply the DTN concept of asynchronous message forwarding to transmit voice messages. We present an implementation of the DT-Talkie for heterogeneous clients such as Maemo, Symbian and Android based <b>personal</b> <b>handheld</b> devices. We also demonstrate {{the use of a}} DTN throwbox with large storage capacity to improve message forwarding. I...|$|R

To determine the appropriate click points and their order, the user needs some hint information transmitted only to her handheld device.

However, the same reference clock property introduces a new challenge {{for the design of}} joint carrier and sampling clock synchronization, where the frequency offsets have relationship with the sampling frequency offset besides the Doppler shift. It is seen that most research on joint sampling and frequency synchronization [11 – 15] have only considered the sampling clock frequency synchronization but ignored the STE. In addition, they view the synchronization of sampling clock frequency all at once whereas neglecting the permanent drift of sampling clock frequency.|$|R
40|$|Multiple {{wireless}} technologies are converging {{to run on}} <b>personal</b> <b>handhelds.</b> The plethora of communication standards next to the cost issues of deeper submicron processing require handheld platforms to shift from sets of multiple application specific ICs (ASICs) to multi-purpose Multi-Processor System-on-Chip (MPSoC) on which Software Defined Radios (SDR) are run. SDR design faces hard real-time processing and data transfer latency constraints. Designing SDR under stringent time-to-market (cost), energy and real-time processing constraints requires the help of advanced Electronic System-Level (ESL) design methodologies. This paper demonstrates an integrated ESL design flow built on advanced ESL tools to design SDR platforms for handhelds.

40|$|While {{appropriate}} as {{an initial}} focus, {{it is time}} that the educational community move beyond an emphasis on 1 : 1 computing (each child having his/her own personal computer) to {{a vision of a}} handheld-centric classroom, where each child not only has his/her own <b>personal,</b> <b>handheld</b> computer, but also has access to networked PCs, probeware, digital cameras, etc. Such a classroom digital infrastructure, we argue, uniquely supports project-based learning, where children can engage in multi-week, multi-media, multi-subject, collab-orative efforts. With the rapid emergence of low-cost handheld devices, the realization of this vision—and its associated educational affordances— is literally possible tomorrow in our children’s classrooms. Thus, it is imper-ative that the educational community engages in extended conversations, now, about the range of teaching and learning opportunities that the handheld-centric classroom makes possible.

We subsequently extract writer information at the character level from online handwritten documents and present a fuzzy c-means approach to cluster and classify the character prototypes for writer identification.
