30|$|Most {{macroscopic}} {{surfaces are}} considered to be rough and fractal [1, 2]. The contact behavior between rough surfaces is much more complicated than that of <b>perfectly</b> <b>smooth</b> <b>surfaces</b> [3, 4]. The real contact area is formed by a large ensemble of discrete contact regions (clusters), which is much smaller than the apparent surface area. The normal force and the size, shape, and distribution of the contact clusters are key to revealing the contact behavior, which is essential for the following studies on friction [5 – 7].|$|R

When the doors were shut and locked, Clewe moved a lever, and a disk of light three feet in diameter immediately appeared upon the ground. It was a colorless light, but it seemed to give a more vivid hue to everything it shone upon--such as the little stones, a piece of wood half embedded in the earth, grains of sand, and pieces of mortar. In a few seconds, however, these things all disappeared, and there revealed itself to the eyes of Clewe a <b>perfectly</b> <b>smooth</b> <b>surface</b> of brown earth. This continued for some little time, now and then a rounded or a flattened stone appearing in it, and then gradually fading away.|$|E
60|$|These pyramids and wedges split vertically, {{or nearly}} so, giving smooth faces of rock, either {{perpendicular}} or very steeply inclined, which {{appear to be}} laid against the central wedge or peak, like planks upright against a wall. The surfaces of these show close parallelism; their fissures are vertical, and cut them smoothly, like the edges of shaped planks. Often groups of these planks, if I may so call them, rise higher than those {{between them and the}} central ridge, forming detached ridges inclining towards the central one. The planks are cut transversely, sometimes by graceful curvilinear fissures; sometimes by straight fissures, which are commonly parallel to the slope of one of the sides of the peak, while the main direction of the planks or leaves is parallel to that of its other side, or points directly to its summit. But the universal law of fracture is--first, that it is clean and sharp, having a <b>perfectly</b> <b>smooth</b> <b>surface,</b> and a perfectly sharp edge to all the fissures; secondly, that every fissure is steeply inclined, and that a horizontal line, or one approaching to it, is an impossibility, except in some turn of a curve.|$|E

As the glass flows along the tin bath, the temperature is gradually reduced from 1100 °C until at approximately 600 °C the sheet can be lifted from the tin onto rollers. The glass ribbon is pulled off the bath by rollers at a controlled speed. Variation in the flow speed and roller speed enables glass sheets of varying thickness to be formed. Top rollers positioned above the molten tin may be used to control both the thickness and the width of the glass ribbon.|$|R
50|$|Friction is an ever plaguing problem {{regardless}} of the scale of a device. It becomes all the more prominent when a device is scaled down. In the nano scale it can wreak havoc if not accounted for because the parts of a Nano-Electro-Mechanical-Systems (NEMS) device are sometimes only a few atoms thick. Furthermore, such NEMS devices typically have a very large surface area-to-volume ratio. Surfaces in the nanoscale resemble a mountain range, where each peak corresponds to an atom or a molecule. Friction at the nanoscale {{is proportional to the}} number of atoms that interact between two surfaces. Hence, friction between <b>perfectly</b> <b>smooth</b> <b>surfaces</b> in the macroscale is actually similar to large rough objects rubbing against each other.|$|R
30|$|These dynamic {{phenomena}} may generate corrugation of {{the rails}} and the wheels {{and they can}} also cause the formation {{of different types of}} irregularities. This results in poor vehicle dynamics (when passing on a worn rail) and consequently higher contact forces, vibrations, and noises. Also in the case of <b>perfectly</b> <b>smooth</b> rail <b>surface,</b> this phenomenon appears {{as a consequence of the}} track discontinuities for the sleepers present (regularly spaced).|$|R

30|$|The {{strength}} of an adhesive contact between two bodies can strongly {{depend on the}} macroscopic and microscopic shape of the surfaces. In the past, the influence of roughness has been investigated thoroughly. However, even {{in the presence of}} <b>perfectly</b> <b>smooth</b> <b>surfaces,</b> geometry can come into play in form of the macroscopic shape of the contacting region. Here we present numerical and experimental results for contacts of rigid punches with flat but oddly shaped face contacting a soft, adhesive counterpart. When it is carefully pulled off, we find that in contrast to circular shapes, detachment occurs not instantaneously but detachment fronts start at pointed corners and travel inwards, until the final configuration is reached which for macroscopically isotropic shapes is almost circular. For elongated indenters, the final shape resembles the original one with rounded corners. We describe the influence of the shape of the stamp both experimentally and numerically.|$|R

40|$|International audienceResearch in elastohydrodynamic {{lubrication}} (EHL) was, at {{its very}} beginning, essentially numerical, and even analytical. This area has, however, significantly evolved {{due to the}} necessity of validating the first models experimentally. Moreover, {{it soon became clear}} that the elastohydrodynamic (EHD) problem would be a topic of much more complex nature than the basic one involving <b>perfectly</b> <b>smooth</b> <b>surfaces,</b> Newtonian fluid, isothermal flow, etc. The experimental approach was the natural choice to make progress in offering the possibility of comparisons, first at the global level of the contact and, over time, at higher and higher spatial resolutions. The in situ analysis of elastohydrodynamic contacts was launched and everyone knows how much its contribution to the field has been and remains important. The present paper takes the task of reviewing the different in situ experimental techniques that have proven to be able to map the key-parameters in living EHD contacts. They are presented both in chronological order and according to the physical mechanism behind them, namely electrical, optical and acoustic methods.

40|$|International audienceVariation of {{directional}} emissivity upon emission angle can be deduced theoretically from the complex refractionindex. Nevertheless, theoretical relations are only valid for <b>perfectly</b> <b>smooth</b> <b>surfaces</b> and homogeneous materials. Directional emissivity is generally nearly constant for emission angles lower than 60 {{degrees from the}} normalincidence, but strong variations are expected for angles higher than 60 degrees either for dielectric materials or forconducting ones. Many experimental devices were developed to determine {{directional emissivity}} of materials. Generally, these devices are quite complex and fail in measuring directional emissivity for angles greater than 80 degrees. Thus, it is still difficult to point out deviations between theoretical and experimental values for highemission angles. Current work concerns {{the development of a}} device (SPIDER Instrument) allowing to determinedirectional emissivity of dielectric or conducting materials. The rear face of the sample is heated periodically. Temperature variations are recorded using a thermocouple. Sample surface temperature variations are recordedusing an infrared camera. By comparing at several frequencies and emission angles, the temperature amplitudesrecorded, it is possible to determine relative variations of directional emissivity. If directional emissivity is known ata given emission angle, then directional emissivity can be calculated at any emission angl...|$|R

5000|$|In 1848, the Rev. Dr. Robert Adams Paterson (sometimes spelled Patterson) {{invented the}} {{gutta-percha}} ball (or guttie, gutty). The guttie {{was made from}} dried sap of the Malaysian sapodilla tree. The sap had a rubber-like feel and could be made round by heating and shaping it in a round mold. Because gutties were cheaper to produce, could be re-formed if they became out-of-round or damaged, and had improved aerodynamic qualities, they soon became the preferred ball for use. Accidentally, {{it was discovered that}} nicks in the guttie from normal use actually provided a ball with a more consistent ball flight than a guttie with a <b>perfectly</b> <b>smooth</b> <b>surface.</b> Thus, makers began intentionally making indentations into the surface of new balls using either a knife or hammer and chisel, giving the guttie a textured surface. Many patterns were tried and used. These new gutties, with protruding nubs left by carving patterned paths across the ball's surface, became known as [...] "brambles" [...] due to their resemblance to bramble fruit.|$|E
50|$|It is hard, {{durable and}} quick drying, but unless the varnish is {{carefully}} made it {{is liable to}} crack. Varnishes for inside work, or cabinet varnishes, are made {{with a variety of}} resins dissolved in linseed oil and turpentine. The resultant gives a hard, lustrous surface, somewhat less durable than that of carriage varnishes. Turpentine varnishes are made from soft gums, such as dammar, common resin and mastic; they are light in color, cheap and not very durable. Lacquers or spirit varnishes are made from very soft gums, such as shellac and sandarach, dissolved in methylated spirit. They are used for internal work, drying quickly, and becoming hard and very brilliant. Surfaces formed with such varnishes are liable to chip easily and scale off. Oil paint is very much improved by the addition of some varnish; it causes it to dry harder and more quickly and with a fine lustrous surface. The driers used for varnish are generally acetate of lead or litharge. An excess of driers makes the varnish less durable and causes cracking. There are many kinds of French polishes, mixed in different ways, but most are composed of shellac and sandarach dissolved in spirit. It is applied to the <b>perfectly</b> <b>smooth</b> <b>surface</b> of hard woods with a pad of flannel or wadding wrapped in linen, and well rubbed in with a circular motion.|$|E
40|$|We quantitatively {{characterized}} the effect surface roughness has on extreme ultraviolet radiation. This {{was done by}} taking {{the ratio of the}} reflectance of a surface with random roughness and the reflectance from a <b>perfectly</b> <b>smooth</b> <b>surface</b> of the same composition and size. The reflectance was calculated by numerically solving the exact integral equations for the electric and magnetic fields for s polarization. The surfaces had low spatial-frequency noise in one direction and were invariant in the other. The reflectance for the rough surface was averaged from many different random surfaces. In order to determine the parameters that affect this ratio, we varied angle of incidence, rms height of the roughness, thickness of the substance, real and imaginary parts of the index of reflection, and frequency cut-off for the random noise on the surface. We determined that in the extreme ultraviolet only the angle and rms height mattered. We did a fit to create a correction factor and compared it to Debye-Waller and Nevot-Croce correction factors...|$|E

40|$|Skin {{friction}} drag reduction {{is one of}} the most promising paths in the investigation of the reduction of aircraft fuel burn. 40 ? 50 % of overall drag comes from the surfaces of the wings and stabilizers. Natural laminar flow airfoils can extend the region of laminar flow and reduce skin {{friction drag}}. However, real-world aircraft wings do not have <b>perfectly</b> <b>smooth</b> <b>surfaces,</b> and therefore the tolerances for step and gap excrescences on these airfoils must be investigated. Previous work has focused on excrescences on flat plates, and only recently included pressure gradient effects. A new three-dimensional swept wing airfoil with an actuated leading edge (SWIFTER) has been constructed, and will extend the body of knowledge of step and gap excrescences to a more real-world configuration and higher Reynolds numbers. An integrated control system for the leading edge actuation system is proposed, including both interface hardware and control code. A heating system for the test surface is also discussed, and the controller hardware, sensors, and code specified. For wind tunnel testing, a proposed set of wall liners are developed from zero-lift condition streamlines and divided into parts suitable for manufacturing, assembly, and installation. Finally, preliminary wind tunnel step excrescence tests using an existing swept-wing model and applique step material were conducted, and the results are discussed with relevance to testing on the new model...|$|R

40|$|We investigate, by {{extensive}} {{molecular dynamics}} simulations {{as well as}} a simplified single-chain model, the influence of steric hindrance on the dynamic properties of nonentangled chains in polymer melt due to confining surfaces. We extend the Rouse model to also include wall effects, using an additional potential that results from the assumption that chain conformations have reflected random-walk statistics, as first advocated by Silberberg. Results for end-to-end vector and Rouse mode correlation functions of chains end-tethered to the surface compare well with those obtained from molecular dynamics simulations of a multichain system using the Kremer–Grest bead–spring model (KG MD). Even though the additional single-chain potential is parameter-free, we show that the accuracy of the model for surface chains is comparable to that of the Rouse model for bulk chains. An analytic dumbbell model accurately describes the longest Rouse mode correlation function of surface-tethered “mushroom” chains immersed in a polymer melt at low grafting density. In addition, we find that a <b>perfectly</b> <b>smooth</b> <b>surface</b> enhances the influence of hydrodynamic viscoelastic coupling on the center-of-mass motion near the surface...|$|E
