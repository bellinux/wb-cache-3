40|$|AbstractThe study compares {{accidents}} at {{passive and}} active railway level crossings, and both immediate and background risk factors are considered. Passive railway level crossings have no warning devices, although {{there might be}} a static warning sign. Active level crossings are equipped with automatic devices warning road users of approaching trains. The data covers all fatal motor vehicle accidents at level crossings in Finland during the years 1991 to 2011 (n= 142). All these accidents have previously been investigated in detail by Road Accident Investigation Teams. Most of the accidents took place at <b>passive</b> <b>level</b> <b>crossings.</b> Compared to active level crossings, and related to the number of fatal accidents, <b>passive</b> <b>level</b> <b>crossings</b> have become proportionally more risky during the study period. Almost all the immediate risk factors in the accidents were of the human error type. Observation errors {{on the part of the}} road user were typical at <b>passive</b> <b>level</b> <b>crossings,</b> and risk taking at active level crossings. The environment did not support safe crossing in most of the accidents at <b>passive</b> <b>level</b> <b>crossings.</b> The speed limits of both the road and rail were high, visibility was insufficient, and the level crossing was often situated uphill. Active warning devices are effective in preventing accidents due to road user errors. Equipping the most dangerous <b>passive</b> <b>level</b> <b>crossings</b> with warning devices – low cost or conventional – would increase safety. Alternatively, some level crossings could be removed altogether. A minimum requirement is that the environmental factors at <b>passive</b> <b>level</b> <b>crossings</b> support safe crossing...|$|E
30|$|There are {{currently}} 23, 500 level crossings in Australia [11], broadly divided {{into one of}} two categories: active level crossings with flashing lights; and <b>passive</b> <b>level</b> <b>crossings</b> controlling traffic solely with stop and give way signs. Crashes at level crossings continue to result in significant human and financial cost to society. According to the ATSB, there were 601 road vehicle collisions at Railway Level crossing (RLX) between July 2002 and June 2012 [1]. Many of these collisions between road vehicles and trains occur at level crossings with passive controls.|$|E
40|$|There are {{currently}} 23, 500 level crossings in Australia, broadly divided {{into one of}} two categories: active level crossings which are fully automatic and have boom barriers, alarm bells, flashing lights, and pedestrian gates; and <b>passive</b> <b>level</b> <b>crossings,</b> which are not automatic and aim to control road and pedestrianised walkways solely with stop and give way signs. Active level crossings {{are considered to be}} the gold standard for transport ergonomics when grade separation (i. e. constructing an over- or underpass) is not viable. In Australia, the current strategy is to annually upgrade <b>passive</b> <b>level</b> <b>crossings</b> with active controls but active crossings are also associated with traffic congestion, {{largely as a result of}} extended closure times. The percentage of time level crossings are closed to road vehicles during peak periods increases with the rise in the frequency of train services. The popular perception appears to be that once a level crossing is upgraded, one is free to wipe their hands and consider the job done. However, there may also be environments where active protection is not enough, but where the setting may not justify the capital costs of grade separation. Indeed, the associated congestion and traffic delay could compromise safety by contributing to the risk taking behaviour by motorists and pedestrians. In these environments it is important to understand what human factor issues are present and ask the question of whether a one size fits all solution is indeed the most ergonomically sound solution for today’s transport needs...|$|E

30|$|Each {{participant}} {{took part}} in two sessions taking approximately 2  h each. During each session, the participant was performing a repetitive succession of simulated driving tasks consisting of driving an itinerary from start to end.

40|$|AbstractThere are {{currently}} 23, 500 level crossings in Australia, broadly divided active level crossings with flashing lights; and <b>passive</b> <b>level</b> <b>crossings</b> controlled by stop and give way signs. The current {{strategy is to}} annually upgrade <b>passive</b> <b>level</b> <b>crossings</b> with active controls within a given budget, but the 5, 900 public passive crossings are too numerous to be upgraded all. The rail industry is considering alternative options to treat more crossings. One of them is to use lower cost equipment with reduced safety integrity level, but with a design that would fail to a safe state: in case of the impossibility for the system to know whether a train is approaching, the crossing changes to a passive crossing. This is implemented by having a STOP sign coming {{in front of the}} flashing lights. While such design is considered safe in terms of engineering design, questions remain on human factors. In order to evaluate whether such approach is safe, we conducted a driving simulator study where participants were familiarized with the new active crossing, before changing the signage to a passive crossing. Our results show that drivers treated the new crossing as an active crossing after the novelty effect had passed. While most participants did not experience difficulties with the crossing being turned back to a passive crossing, a number of participants experienced difficulties stopping in time at the first encounter of such passive crossing. Worse, a number of drivers never realized the signage had changed, highlighting the link between the decision to brake and stop at an active crossing to the lights flashing. Such results show the potential human factor issues of changing an active crossing to a passive crossing in case of failure of the detection of the train...|$|E
30|$|The ALCAM {{model is}} {{designed}} to apply for both active and passive grade crossings, whereas the Risk Assessment of Accident and Incident at Level crossings (RAAILc) model {{can be used for}} predicting accidents at <b>passive</b> <b>level</b> <b>crossings</b> only. A review by Little [22] has categorized ALCAM under a simple weighted factor, and RAAILc as a statistically driven approach. Note that the ALCAM model is different from the All Level Crossings Risk Model (ALCRM) that was developed in the United Kingdom and was categorized as a complex weighted factor model in that review. Interestingly, Little, in the same review, found only four operational models that take into account the number of pedestrians using the crossing. Newer approaches based on simulation methods such as Petri nets are still developing [16].|$|E
30|$|Several {{analyses}} {{have demonstrated}} that errors or violations {{on the part of}} the road user represent the largest contributor to RLX crashes [1, 12, 19], indicating the need for innovative interventions targeted at drivers to complement current railway interventions. The rail industry is therefore interested in new approaches to reduce the number of crashes at <b>passive</b> <b>level</b> <b>crossings.</b> One of them is to use Vehicle to Infrastructure (V 2 I) and Vehicle to Vehicle (V 2 V) communications to warn drivers about the approach of a train directly in their vehicles. Significant research has been conducted to study driver behaviour and responses to various traditional road-based interventions at different types of RLX. This resulted in some evidence to suggest the effectiveness of traditional approaches to level crossing safety, however, much more research is required to properly evaluate emerging technologies. Emerging technologies might be optimally used as a comparatively low-cost approach to increasing safety at passively protected crossings.|$|E
40|$|The {{paper is}} based on the {{question}} whether the existing (legislation determined) method for determining the visibility length on <b>passive</b> protected <b>level</b> railroad <b>crossings</b> insures the relevant level of traffic safety. It has been recognised that using of such method does not provide stopping of road driver vehicles in front of railroad crossing in all conditions. Based on such conclusion a new approach to determining visibility length on <b>passive</b> protected <b>level</b> railroad crossing is proposed. The new approach {{is based on}} the assumption that it is necessary, primarily on <b>level</b> railroad <b>crossings</b> with local roads to recognize the worst possible and expected road and weather conditions. The testing of the proposed method in the real environment has shown that at lower speeds of road vehicles there is almost no difference, and that important benefits are recognised for the speeds of 30 and 50 km/h where longer stopping distances of road vehicles have been detected (road vehicle can stop safely in front of a rail crossing) with almost the same visibility lengths. The use of the proposed method could have important impact on the increase of traffic safety on <b>passive</b> protected <b>level</b> railroad <b>crossings...</b>|$|R

Several issues {{are discussed in}} this paper including safety at <b>passive</b> <b>level</b> railway <b>crossings,</b> human factors considerations associated with unavailability of a warning device, and a conceptual model for how safety could be compromised at railway <b>level</b> <b>crossings</b> following prolonged or frequent unavailability. The research plans to quantify safety risk to motorists at <b>level</b> <b>crossings</b> using a Human Reliability Assessment (HRA) method, supported by data collected using an advanced driving simulator. This method aims to identify human error within tasks and task units identified {{as part of the}} task analysis process. It is anticipated that by modelling driver behaviour the current study will be able to quantify meaningful task variability including temporal parameters, between participants and within participants. The process of complex tasks such as driving through a level crossing is fundamentally context-bound. Therefore this study also aims to quantify those performance-shaping factors that contribute to vehicle train collisions by highlighting changes in the task units and driver physiology. Finally we will also consider a number of variables germane to ensuring external validity of our results. Without this inclusion, such an analysis could seriously underestimate risk...|$|R
40|$|A {{computer}} based choice reaction time task {{was used to}} investigate the knowledge and the association strength of n= 57 participants {{with regard to the}} St. Andrew’s cross. Within three conditions, it was compared to the stop sign and a combination sign (stop sign + St. Andrew’s cross) as second and third target sign. Participants had to react as fast and correctly as possible to three series of traffic signs that were presented to them on a computer screen. In each of three conditions, participants showed significantly more incorrect judgments with regard to the meaning of the St. Andrew’s cross compared to the stop sign as well as the combination sign. With regard to the choice reaction time, participants reacted significantly slower to the St Andrews cross compared to the stop sign and the combination sign {{in the second and third}} condition. The retrieval of the correct schemata in case of the St. Andrew’s cross appeared to be more difficult than in the case of the stop sign and the combination sign.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} major obstacles for {{the adoption}} of low cost level crossing warning devices (LCLCWDs) in Australia and reviews those trialed in Australia and internationally. The argument {{for the use of}} LCLCWDs is that for a given investment, more <b>passive</b> <b>level</b> <b>crossings</b> can be treated, therefore increasing safety benefits across the rail network. This approach, in theory, reduces risk across the network by utilizing a combination of low-cost and conventional level crossing interventions, similar to what is done in the road environment. This paper concludes that in order to determine if this approach can produce better safety outcomes than the current approach, involving the incremental upgrade of level crossings with conventional interventions, it is necessary to perform rigorous risk assessments and cost-benefit analyses of LCLCWDs. Further research is also needed to determine how best to differentiate less reliable LCCLWDs from conventional warning devices through the use of different warning signs and signals. This paper presents a strategy for progressing research and development of LCLCWDs and details how the Cooperative Research Centre (CRC) for Rail Innovation is fulfilling this strategy through the current and future affordable level crossing projects...|$|E
40|$|Improving {{safety at}} rail level {{crossings}} {{is an important}} part of both road and rail safety strategies. While low in number, crashes between vehicles and trains at level crossings are catastrophic events typically involving multiple fatalities and serious injuries. Advances in driving assessment methods, such as the provision of on-road instrumented test vehicles with eye and head tracking, provide researchers with the opportunity to further understand driver behaviour at such crossings in ways not previously possible. This paper describes a study conducted to further understand the factors that shape driver behaviour at rail level crossings using instrumented vehicles. Twenty-two participants drove an On-Road Test Vehicle (ORTeV) on a predefined route in regional Victoria with a mix of both active (flashing lights with/without boom barriers) and passively controlled (stop, give way) crossings. Data collected included driving performance data, head checks, and interview data to capture driver strategies. The data from an integrated suite of methods demonstrated clearly how behaviour differs at active and <b>passive</b> <b>level</b> <b>crossings,</b> particularly for inexperienced drivers. For example, the head check data clearly show the reliance and expectancies of inexperienced drivers for active warnings even when approaching passively controlled crossings. These studies provide very novel and unique insights into how level crossing design and warnings shape driver behaviour...|$|E
40|$|The recent {{development}} of new technologies has attracted {{the interest of the}} rail industry as a way to increase driver awareness at railway level crossings by providing new ways to display information to drivers as they approach crossings. While such ideas have been predominantly trialed in driving simulators, there is a growing interest for live trials of such interventions on the road. While most studies have demonstrated that errors or violations {{on the part of the}} road user are the largest contributor to level crossing crashes, the understanding of driver behavior at level crossings is poorly understood due to the limited number, focus and period of time of studies conducted at level crossings. This highlights the lack of manageable methods for studying driver behavior at level crossings on a long term basis in naturalistic conditions, particularly for <b>passive</b> <b>level</b> <b>crossings,</b> which are often located in remote areas. We propose a new, practical and affordable application of pneumatic tubes to evaluate over the long term both the compliance of drivers at level crossings and their speed during the approach of level crossing with low road traffic volume. We tested our methodology at two railway level crossings in the Brisbane region and recorded over 10, 000 vehicle movements for each site during a 5 months observation...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This {{study was}} {{designed}} to investigate how drivers assess safety issues at passive railway-road level crossings. The study was limited to traditional and relatively inexpensive safety measures. Fifty-six car and van drivers were interviewed after <b>passive</b> <b>level</b> <b>crossings</b> with low traffic volume. Both key requirements of safe behaviour (i. e. decrease of speed and looking for trains) were indicated by 36 - 71 % of drivers depending on the classification of responses. This result suggests that a substantial percentage of drivers have no proper concept of safe behaviour at level crossings. Another important result was that drivers found the crossing of main roads to be more difficult than crossing passive railway-road level crossings — {{despite the fact that they}} considered the latter to be more dangerous. This suggests that the drivers estimated the crash risk at railway-road level crossings to be relatively low, although they know that it is dangerous in general. Furthermore, the drivers suggested that the conspicuity of level crossings could be improved by increasing lateral visibility early enough and with advance warning signs. The drivers also suggested that caution could be increased with the use of STOP signs, improving the visibility of road signs and increasing the lateral visibility of tracks. The results suggest that there are several potential safety measures that could support drivers...|$|E
40|$|Intelligent Transport System (ITS) {{technology}} {{is seen as}} a cost-effective way to increase the conspicuity of approaching trains and the effectiveness of train warnings at level crossings by providing an in-vehicle warning of an approaching train. The {{technology is}} often seen as a potential low-cost alternative to upgrading <b>passive</b> <b>level</b> <b>crossings</b> with traditional active warning systems (flashing lights and boom barriers). ITS platforms provide sensor, localization and dedicated short-range communication (DSRC) technologies to support cooperative applications such as collision avoidance for road vehicles. In recent years, in-vehicle warning systems based on ITS technology have been trialed at numerous locations around Australia, at level crossing sites with active and passive controls. While significant research has been conducted on the benefits of the technology in nominal operating modes, little research has focused on the effects of the failure modes, the human factors implications of unreliable warnings and the technology adoption process from the railway industry’s perspective. Many ITS technology suppliers originate from the road industry and often have limited awareness of the safety assurance requirements, operational requirements and legal obligations of railway operators. This paper aims to raise awareness of these issues and start a discussion on how such technology could be adopted. This paper will describe several ITS implementation cenarios and discuss failure modes, human factors considerations and the impact these scenarios are likely to have in terms of safety, railway safety assurance requirements and the practicability of meeting these requirements. The paper will identify the key obstacles impeding the adoption of ITS systems for the different implementation scenarios and a possible path forward towards the adoption of ITS technology...|$|E
