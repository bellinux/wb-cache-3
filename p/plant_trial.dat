30|$|No {{particular}} {{effect of}} the red-oils on the demulsification times, even at 2  % concentration, was observed. However, after full demulsification, {{a significant increase in}} the turbidity values for the vessels containing red-oils was noticed (up to 26  % increase), even at low red-oils concentration. Since the separate addition of 2  % red-oils to an isolated water phase does not lead to a turbidity increase, this effect can only be explained by an enhanced emulsification phenomenon. The role of red-oils in enhancing the emulsion phenomenon was thus proven. The <b>plant</b> <b>trial</b> using TX-cut instead of PyGas as aromatic wash was thus performed to evaluate if the emulsifying {{effect of the}} red-oils could be minimized.|$|E
40|$|<b>Plant</b> <b>trial</b> {{evaluations}} {{have been}} completed for two zirconium-based, non-chromium passivation systems previously identified as possible alternatives to cathodic dichromate (CDC) passivation for electrolytic tinplate (ETP). These trials were done on a commercial electrolytic tin plating line at Weirton Steel and extensive evaluations of the materials resulting from these trials {{have been completed}}. All this was accomplished as a collaborative effort under the AISI Technology Roadmap Program and was executed by seven North American Tin Mill Products producers [Bethlehem Steel (now acquired by International Steel Group (ISG)), Dofasco Inc., National Steel (now acquired by U. S. Steel), U. S. Steel, USS-Posco, Weirton Steel, and Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel] with funding partially from the Department of Energy (DOE) and partially on an equal cost sharing basis among project participants. The initial phases of this project involved optimization of application procedures for the non-chromium systems in the laboratories at Bethlehem Steel and Betz Dearborn followed by extensive testing with various lacquer formulations and food simulants in the laboratories at Valspar and PPG. Work was also completed at Dofasco and Weirton Steel to develop methods to prevent precipitation of insoluble solids {{as a function of}} time from the zirconate system. The results of this testing indicated that sulfide staining characteristics for the non-chromium passivation systems could be minimized but not totally eliminated and neither system was found to perform quite as good, in this respect, as the standard CDC system. As for the stability of zirconate treatment, a method was developed to stabilize this system for a sufficient period of time to conduct <b>plant</b> <b>trial</b> evaluations but, working with a major supplier of zirconium orthosulfate, a method for long term stabilization is still under development...|$|E
30|$|To study such influence, a <b>plant</b> <b>trial</b> using a nonreactive {{aromatic}} wash (i.e., TX-cut) as aromatic wash for the caustic {{tower was}} then performed {{to probe the}} effect of red-oil structures on emulsion stability in the QWT. Quality of the red-oil during this trial was monitored using a method newly developed in-house for the complex analysis of red-oil species using UPLC-QTOF. This method allows to qualitatively estimate the amount of species {{with respect to the}} number of Oxygen vs Carbon atoms, or Oxygen vs Double Bond Equivalent (DBE). DBE is a value corresponding to the amount of double bonds and ring structures a molecule possesses.

The study started with a verification of the flows and polluting loads generated within the catchment followed by a review of the treatment technologies available. The purpose of examining the available technologies was to ascertain the land areas required. Different technologies had different land requirements, and it was important to evaluate this for the site selection stage. Inevitably, conventional activated sludge treatment processes required the greater land take, but it was the only proven technology as far as the client was concerned.
