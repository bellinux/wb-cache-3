40|$|The {{present study}} tested the {{applicability}} of a sexual and nonsexual violence <b>perpetrator</b> <b>typology</b> outlined by Monson and Langhinrichsen-Rohling (1948) using empirically-derived (i. e., cluster analysis) and theoretically-derived (i. e., subtypes formed based on depressive symptomatology, type and generality of violence) techniques. A number of intrapersonal, interpersonal, and personality characteristics of a large sample (N = 670) of college-aged individuals were assessed and {{used to test the}} typology. Two hundred and sixty-seven of the participants (N = 87 men, N = 178 women) reported some act of sexual and/or physical dating violence perpetration in their lifetime. Both the empirically- and theoretically-derived approaches to testing the typology provided support for at least three perpetrator types. There was a large group of perpetrators (approximately 50 %), labeled Relationship-only perpetrators, who perpetrated primarily low levels of physical violence within their dating relationship(s), evidenced minimal psychopathology. Half of these perpetrators were men, and half were women. There were few differences between this type and the non-perpetrators across the assessed characteristics. Support was also found for two more severe types of perpetrators, namely the Generally Violent/Antisocial and Dysphoric/Borderline or Emotionally Dysregulated types. The pattern of assessed characteristics for these two types of perpetrators was mostly consistent with previous research. More men than women were found to be classified as Generally Violent/Antisocial. There was some limited support found in the theoretically-driven approach for a Sexually Obsessed type. Overall, these findings indicate that different factors may cause or maintain the intimate violence perpetrated within this heterogeneous population. The clinical implications of these findings are discussed with regard to prevention, assessment, and matching treatment to perpetrator types. ...|$|E
40|$|Restricted until 12 Feb. 2010. The study s {{purpose was}} twofold: (i) {{identify}} subtypes for adolescent {{male and female}} perpetrators of dating violence, and (ii) examine distal and proximal risk factors of adolescent dating violence for differing male and female typologies. A cluster {{analysis was used to}} develop perpetrator typologies: 3 -clusters emerged for males [...] generally violent; situational violent; and non-violent; and 4 -clusters emerged for females [...] depressed attention seeker; hostile controller; undifferentiated controller; and non-violent. Two separate MANCOVA were conducted, one for males and one for females, using age and SES as covariates, to test whether the typologies differed by risk factors (dependent variables). Overall, adolescent <b>perpetrator</b> <b>typologies</b> differed by distal and proximal risk factors. Typologies differed from one another within their gender as well as between gender groups (e. g. males vs. females). Generally violent males had higher scores on parent-child violence and witnessing inter-parental violence, compared to situational violent and non-violent males. Generally violent males had higher scores on acceptance of violence, school/community violence, alcohol/drug use, and number of dating partners compared to non-violent males. Compared to non-violent females, the depressed attention seeker females had higher scores on school/community violence, seriousness of relationship, number of dating partners, and length of time dating. The hostile controller females and undifferentiated controller females had higher scores on parent-child violence, alcohol/drug use, and number of dating partners compared to non-violent females. This study suggests a need for clinical findings to be included in initial assessments and treatment matching for adolescent <b>perpetrator</b> <b>typologies...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Perpetrator</b> <b>typologies</b> {{have been}} useful in {{understanding}} other crimes, such as do-mestic violence, and serve a similar purpose in enhancing our knowledge base about human trafficking. Typologies of human traffickers {{can be useful}} in improving our understanding about elements needed for successful investigations and prosecu-tions; developing appropriate services for victims and survivors; preventing human trafficking; and increasing community awareness. The goal of this project is to explore the types of traffickers based on key characteris-tics found in the literature and in prosecuted cases. The initial two phases of this re-search, reported here, involve a review of literature, government reports, and media reports of prosecuted cases related to human trafficking and in-depth interviews with prosecutors and national experts who have experience working cases involving human trafficking crimes. In a future phase (using non-OVC funds), interviews will be conducted with offenders who have been convicted on charges related to human trafficking. This phase of the study addresses the following research questions: 1) what types of traffickers and trafficking crimes exist?, and 2) how can they be cate-gorized into criminal typologies...|$|R
40|$|My diploma thesis {{deals with}} the {{behavioural}} analysis and perpetrators of serial, mass and sexually motivated murders issue. The behavioural analysis is built upon bases of different methods of criminal profiles formation - psychological profiling. Following the historical outset of the criminal profile, the method of the behavioural analysis and its particular components are introduced and discussed. The components are described through optic {{of the most commonly}} used <b>typologies,</b> e. g. <b>perpetrators</b> <b>typologies,</b> scenes of delict, victims and murders. Hereafter I pursue issue of criminal profiling utilization in practise, particularly perpetrator profile creation, crime linking and threat assessment. The last part dedicated to the behavioural analysis consists of behavioural analysis historical development in the Czech Republic and reflection of potential future development of this issue. The second part of my diploma thesis is focused on serial murder and serial perpetrator. The definition of multiple murder and differentiation from its individual types is given. The following part comprises of introduction of the most common myths and stereotypes ingrained in the society and through statistics their creation and falseness is explained. The phenomenon of the hypothetical murderer is reached through [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Perpetrators of {{intimate}} partner violence (IPV) {{are considered a}} heterogeneous group of men. This has resulted in several attempts to classify IPV perpetrators into subtypes. Although a well-explored topic, the existing IPV typologies are not suitable for the police due to its reliance on clinical information. The present study aimed at constructing a <b>typology</b> of IPV <b>perpetrators,</b> based on information available to the police. Method. Data from 235 risk assessments conducted by police officers in Sweden, using the Spousal Assault Risk Assessment guide: Short Version (SARA:SV), was analyzed through Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA). Results. Three subtypes of IPV perpetrators were identified: the generally violent/antisocial (GV/A) perpetrator, the family only (FO) perpetrator, and the high risk (HR) perpetrator. Also, a fourth subtype emerged reflecting a victim profile, labeled the rational victim (RV). Discussion. Besides validating previously found IPV subtypes, we also identified two subtypes not previously described in the literature. Furthermore, the results demonstrated that clinical information concerning the perpetrator's mental health was not decisive in identifying the perpetrators constituting the highest risk for IPV. Noteworthy, the importance of considering victim vulnerability factors in an IPV risk assessment context {{was supported by the}} identification of the RV. However, the proposed typology needs to be validated in subsequent research.

40|$|Cyberbullying {{is often}} defi ned as {{aggression}} conducted through mobile phones and the Internet. This phenomenon is predominantly {{understood as a}} kind of peer aggression, when both the perpetrator(s) and the victim belong to the same group (class or online community). However, the Internet extends and facilitates harassment not only of peers. The paper focuses on different kinds of electronic aggression identifi ed through qualitative research (interview, e-mail interviews and focus groups with students and teachers). The results have shown that except cyberbullying one can indicate fi ve further types of electronic aggression. They are: aggression against celebrities (e. g. actors, singers, etc.), aggression against the vulnerable (e. g. alcoholics, etc.), aggression against school staff, aggression against groups/ideas (when the victim is not a particular, identifi able person) and free-fl oating (random) aggression (often when the victim is totally anonymous to the <b>perpetrator).</b> This <b>typology</b> has been positively verifi ed in a survey on a representative sample of Polish adolescents (N = 2143). The paper presents the typology with the examples from the qualitative stage of research, also discussing potential socialization risks for each kind of electronic aggression. It shows also (on the basis of quantitative research) the prevalence of perpetration and victimization of different kinds of electronic aggression as well as their co-occurrence. It demonstrates the factors that infl uence such involvement. It must be stated that although peer aggression cyberbullying seems to be predominant, other kinds of electronic aggression have also been frequently conducted by the respondents. For example, a signifi cant percentage of perpetrators attacked through new media the following groups of victims: random Internet users (30. 3 %), groups of people (19. 7 %), celebrities (13. 9 %), and vulnerable victims (13. 3 %). The conclusions underline the need to extend prevention educational tools to different kinds of electronic aggression, not restricting them to cyberbullying understood as an extension of traditional bullying...|$|R
40|$|Domestic {{violence}} is a vast and grave social problem which pervades the whole society. In my diploma thesis, I follow it up because of its complexity as well, since it comes not only under the field of law and criminology but also psychology and sociology. It was necessary to define domestic violence as a term {{in the first part}} of the thesis, and to describe its characteristics which are constancy of aggressor and victim roles, escalation, cyclicity, continuation and repeatability. I deal with impacts of domestic violence on the society as a whole, and present a brief perspective on coping with this issue abroad. Furthermore I look into myths floating around about domestic violence because they show the public's attitude to domestic violence, and in my opinion, that plays an important role for setting the prevention appropriately. The second chapter of the diploma thesis relates to criminological aspects of domestic violence. Successively it concentrates on incidence of domestic violence, its <b>typology,</b> <b>perpetrators</b> and victims, emphasizing exactly the victimological part including the specifics of particular victim groups. The next chapter of the thesis contains an overview of previous development of the legislation in the field of protection against domestic violence. In the fourth part of the diploma [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{concentrates on}} the phenomenon called hate crimes. At first, the attention {{is given to the}} definition of this concept. The thesis also explains another terms connected with hate crimes and comes with possible translation of this term to Czech. Furthermore, it mentions forms of hate crimes and some of the real cases in brief. It also describes types of hate crimes. One of the chapters discusses the <b>perpetrator,</b> his motives, <b>typology</b> of the offender and hate crimes committed by groups. As the thesis wants to capture the complete dynamics of the phenomenon, it also {{concentrates on the}} victims of hate crimes {{at the end of the}} theoretical part. The proposition of research is connected with the perpetrators sentenced for committing hate- or bias- motivated bodily harm or grievous bodily harm in the Czech Republic. The first aim of the research is to compare these perpetrators' social skills to social skills of normal population and to social skills of perpetrators of other than hate- or bias-motivated bodily harm or grievous bodily harm. The second aim of the research is to find out which components of social skills seem to be the most problematic for perpetrators of hate crime. Powered by TCPDF (www. tcpdf. org...|$|R
