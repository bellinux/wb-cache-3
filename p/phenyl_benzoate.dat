40|$|In this paper, {{we report}} on the {{reaction}} of phenol benzoylation with benzoic acid, which was carried out in the absence of solvent. The aim of this reaction is the synthesis of hydroxybenzophenones, which are important intermediates for the chemical industry.

The product distribution was greatly affected by the presence of Lewis-type acid sites in H-beta; it was suggested that the interaction between the aromatic ring and the electrophilic Al 3 + species led to the preferred formation of o-hydroxybenzophenone, because of the decreased charge density on the C atom at the para position of the phenolic ring.

The influence of the ortho substituents on the carbonyl carbon 13 C NMR chemical shift, δ CO, {{was found to be}} described by a linear multiple regression equation containing the inductive, resonance and steric substituent constants. For all the ortho -substituted esters containing substituents in acyl part as well as phenyl part the substituent–induced reverse inductive effect (ρ I ∠ 0), the normal resonance effect (ρ R ≥ 0), and the negative steric effect (δ ortho ∠ 0) with the E s B were observed. In the case of ortho substituents in phenyl part the resonance effect was negligible. Due to inductive effect the ortho electron-withdrawing substituents showed upfield shift or shielding of the carbonyl carbon, while the electron-donating substituents had an opposite effect. Because of the sterical consequences ortho substituents revealed deshielding effect on the 13 C NMR chemical shift of the carbonyl carbon. For all the meta - and para -substituted esters the reverse substituent-induced inductive and resonance effects (ρ I ∠ 0, ρ R ∠ 0) were found to be significant.
