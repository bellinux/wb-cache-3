After all, it is easy for each one of us to see that other people are 'blocked' about certain questions, so that without being aware of it, they are avoiding the confrontation of contradictions in certain ideas that may be extremely dear to them. The very nature of such a 'block' is, however, that {{it is a kind of}} insensitivity or 'anesthesia' about one's own contradictions. Evidently then, what is crucial is to be aware of the nature of one's own 'blocks'. If one is alert and attentive, he can see for example that whenever certain questions arise, there are fleeting sensations of fear, which push him away from consideration of those questions, and of pleasure, which attract his thoughts and cause them to be occupied with other questions. So, one is able to keep away from whatever it is that he thinks may disturb him. And as a result, he can be subtle at defending his own ideas, when he supposes that he is really listening to what other people have to say. When we come together to talk, or otherwise to act in common, can each one of us be aware of the subtle fear and pleasure sensations that 'block' the ability to listen freely? ...|$|E

While developing the Kulczyński's theory, own concept of hydrological classification of wetlands is presented, which distinguishes four types of wetlands on the basis of hydrological alimentation of site and nine kinds of wetlands on the basis of hydroecological conditions in the site...|$|E
40|$|As the world's largest ocean, the Pacific is {{intricately}} {{linked to}} {{major changes in}} the global climate system. Throughout the Cenozoic, Pacific plate motion has had a northward component. Thus, the Pacific is unique in that the thick sediment bulge of biogenic-rich deposits from the currently narrowly focused zone of equatorial upwelling is slowly moving away from the Equator. Hence, older sections are not deeply buried and can be recovered by drilling. Previous drilling in this area during Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Legs 138 and 199 was remarkably successful in giving us new insights into the workings of the climate and carbon system, productivity changes across the zone of divergence, time-dependent calcium carbonate dissolution, bio- and magnetostratigraphy, the location of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), and evolutionary patterns for times of climatic change and upheaval. Together with older Deep Sea Drilling Project drilling in the eastern equatorial Pacific, both legs also helped to delineate the position of the paleoequator and variations in sediment thickness from ~ 150 °W to 110 °W. The Pacific equatorial age transect (<b>PEAT)</b> <b>science</b> program is based on Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Proposal 626 and consists of Expeditions 317 and 319, grouped into one science program. The goal is to recover a continuous Cenozoic record of the equatorial Pacific by drilling at the paleoposition of the Equator at successive crustal ages on the Pacific plate. Records collected from Expeditions 317 and 319 are to be joined with records of previous drilling during ODP Legs 138 and 199 to make a complete equatorial Pacific record from 0 to 55 Ma. Previously, ODP Legs 138 and 199 were designed as transects across the paleoequator in order to study the changing patterns of sediment deposition across equatorial regions at critical time intervals. As we have gained more information about the past movement of plates and when in Earth's history "critical" climate events took place, it becomes possible to drill an age transect ("flow-line") along the position of the Pacific paleoequator. The goal of this transect is to target important time slices where calcareous sediments have been best preserved and the sedimentary archive will allow us to reconstruct past climatic and tectonic conditions. Leg 199 enhanced our understanding of extreme changes of the calcium carbonate compensation depth (CCD) across major geological boundaries during the last 55 m. y. A very shallow CCD during most of the Paleogene makes it difficult to obtain well-preserved sediments during these stratigraphic intervals, but the strategy of site locations for the current two expeditions is designed to occupy the most promising sites and to obtain a unique sedimentary biogenic sediment archive for time periods just after the Paleocene/Eocene boundary event, Eocene cooling, the Eocene–Oligocene transition, the "one cold pole" Oligocene, the Oligocene–Miocene transition, and the Miocene. These new cores and data will significantly contribute to the objectives of the IODP Extreme Climates Initiative and will provide material that the previous legs were not able to recover. For logistical reasons, the <b>PEAT</b> <b>science</b> program is composed of two expeditions but is being implemented as a single science program to best achieve the overall objectives of Proposal 626. Participants on both expeditions (as well as approved shore-based scientists) will comprise a single science party with equal access to data and materials from both cruises. Sampling aboard the ship will be minimal, and the bulk of the sampling will be completed postcruise. The operational plan is to occupy eight sites along the age transect with the goal of recovering as complete a sedimentary succession as possible. This will probably require three holes to be cored at each site with wireline logging operations in one hole. Basement will be tagged in {{at least one of the}} holes. Expedition 317 will be directed primarily to sample the Neogene sites (proposed Sites PEAT- 2 C, 6 C, and 7 C, in priority order). The second expedition (319) will primarily sample the Paleogene sites (proposed Sites PEAT- 1 C, 3 C, 4 C, and possibly 5 C, in priority order) ...|$|E
50|$|The lake is geologically {{important}} {{because it has been}} {{at the edge of the}} Pleistocene glacier. In the 1870s the lake was drained to accommodate the <b>peat</b> industry, giving <b>science</b> a chance to examine its bogs and historians and prehistorians a chance to examine the artifacts and human remains. A late Pleistocene period of warm climate (an interstadial) was named for the lake based on evidence gathered here (see Bølling oscillation).|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the present report has been to provide a critical examination of various key papers which have increasingly come to inform the debate about peat and carbon in recent years. The report attempts to clarify the nature and origins of the evidence presented in these papers, and tries to explain why sometimes apparently-conflicting evidence emerges when comparing aspects of these and associated papers. The work seeks {{to look at the}} current state of <b>peat</b> carbon <b>science</b> with a view to identifying key messages relevant to policy. In the process of undertaking this study, the sources of many apparently contradictory lines of evidence have been identified. It is hoped that this work can draw together the science of what is undoubtedly a highly complex subject and render the various technical, confusing and sometimes plainly contradictory elements of the subject into a form which clarifies the issues and makes them more accessible. The present study has also highlighted a number of issues where further research is needed...|$|R
40|$|The subsoil {{conditions}} of Surfers Paradise in Southeast Queensland of Australia {{have been examined}} in terms of soil stiffness by using geographic information system (GIS). Peat is a highly organic and compressible material. Surfers Paradise (as a study area) has problematic peat layer due to its high water content, high compressibility, and low shear strength. This layer has various thicknesses at different locations ranging between R. L.. 10 to R. L. - 19. 6 m. Buildings in Surfers Paradise are using piled foundations to avoid the high compressibility and low shear strength peat layer. Spatial Analyst extension in the GIS ArcMap 10 has been utilised to develop zonation maps for different depths in the study area. Each depth has been interpolated as a surface to create Standard Penetration Test SPT-N value GIS-based zonation maps for each depth. In addition, 8 interpolation techniques have been examined to evaluate which technique gives better representation for the Standard Penetration Test (SPT) data. Inverse Distance weighing (IDW) method in Spatial Analyst extension gives better representation for the utilised data with certain parameters. Two different cross sections have been performed {{in the core of}} the study area to determine the extent and the depth of the peat layer underneath already erected buildings. Physical and engineering properties of the Surfers Paradise peat have been obtained and showed that this peat falls within the category of tropical <b>peat.</b> Griffith <b>Sciences,</b> Griffith School of EngineeringFull Tex...|$|R
