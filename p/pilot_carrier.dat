30|$|Receivers for {{wireless}} Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) systems usually {{perform the}} channel estimation based on <b>pilot</b> <b>carriers</b> in known {{positions of the}} channel spectrum. Interpolation between <b>pilot</b> <b>carriers</b> is applied to determine the channel transfer function in all carrier frequencies. Channel variations along time are compensated by means of interpolation between successive channel estimates on the same carrier frequency. However, not rarely, the fast channel variations exceed the time interpolator capability, {{as is the case}} for mobile operation. In this article we present a new channel compensation technique based on the concurrent operation of two stochastic gradient timedomain algorithms, one which minimizes a cost function that measures the received signal energy dispersion and other which minimizes the Euclidean distance between the received digital modulation symbols and the ones in the reference constellation assigned to each OFDM sub-channel. Results show that the new technique advantageously improves the system robustness to fast channel variations since, with a low computational cost, it dramatically reduces the demodulator symbol error rate even when the receiver is operating in an intense dynamic multipath scenario.|$|R

40|$|Abstruct- The {{effect of}} fiber {{polarization}} mode dispersion (PMD) on a {{coherent optical system}} with <b>pilot</b> <b>carrier</b> is twofold. First, the PMD causes state of polarization (SOP) mismatch between the message signal and <b>pilot</b> <b>carrier.</b> Second, the degrees of polarization (DOP) of the message signal and <b>pilot</b> <b>carrier</b> are degraded by PMD. Because coherrnt reception relies both on the SOP’S and DOP’s of the waves, system performance is degraded by PMD. The effect of SOP mismatch causes interme-diate frequency (IF) signal amplitude degradation whereas DOP variation not only results in IF signal amplitude degradation but further induces IF noises. Here we derive analytical expressions to evaluate the performance degradation. It is shown {{that there is no}} performance degradation if only one principle state of polarization is excited and maximum degradation occurs when both principle states of polarization are equally excited.
