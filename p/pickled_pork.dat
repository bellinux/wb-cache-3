500|$|In 1836 the Poor Law Commission {{distributed}} six diets for workhouse inmates, one {{of which}} was to be chosen by each Poor Law Union depending on its local circumstances. [...] Although dreary, the food was generally nutritionally adequate, and according to contemporary records was prepared with great care. [...] Issues such as training staff to serve and weigh portions were well understood. [...] The diets included general guidance, as well as schedules for each class of inmate. [...] They were laid out on a weekly rotation, the various meals selected on a daily basis, from a list of foodstuffs. [...] For instance, a breakfast of bread and gruel was followed by dinner, which might consist of cooked meats, <b>pickled</b> <b>pork</b> or bacon with vegetables, potatoes, yeast dumpling, soup and suet, or rice pudding. [...] Supper was normally bread, cheese and broth, and sometimes butter or potatoes.|$|E

[...] "Cattle, hogs, sheep or goats," [...] said Matthews, [...] "were either driven or shipped to us on [...] cars, and usually butchered {{on the banks of}} a creek into which the offal was dumped."

6000|$|We {{were to have}} {{a superb}} dinner, {{consisting}} of a leg of <b>pickled</b> <b>pork</b> and greens, {{and a pair of}} roast stuffed fowls. A handsome mince-pie had been made yesterday morning (which accounted for the mincemeat not being missed), and the pudding was already on the boil. These extensive arrangements occasioned us to be cut off unceremoniously in respect of breakfast; [...] "for I ain't," [...] said Mrs. Joe,--"I ain't a going to have no formal cramming and busting and washing up now, with what I've got before me, I promise you!" ...|$|E
60|$|The cooking {{was done}} {{altogether}} out of doors. For this essential comfort, le Bourdon had made very liberal provision. He {{had a small}} oven, a sufficiently convenient fire-place, and a storehouse, at hand; all placed near the spring, and beneath {{the shade of a}} magnificent elm. In the storehouse he kept his barrel of flour, his barrel of salt, a stock of smoked or dried meat, and that which the woodsman, if accustomed in early life to the settlements, prizes most highly, a half-barrel of <b>pickled</b> <b>pork.</b> The bark canoe had sufficed to transport all these stores, merely ballasting handsomely that ticklish craft; and its owner relied on the honey to perform the same office on the return voyage, when trade or consumption should have disposed of the various articles just named.|$|E

5000|$|Focused on {{shipping}} {{as well as}} production, New England {{conducted a}} robust trade within the English domain in the mid-18th century.

60|$|In a {{place where}} viands that would {{elsewhere}} be deemed great luxuries were so abundant, no one was excluded from their enjoyment. The meanest individual at Oswego habitually feasted on game that would have formed the boast of a Parisian table; {{and it was no}} more than a healthful commentary on the caprices of taste, and of the waywardness of human desires, that the very diet which in other scenes would have been deemed the subject of envy and repinings got to pall on the appetite. The coarse and regular food of the army, which it became necessary to husband on account of the difficulty of transportation, rose in the estimation of the common soldier; and at any time he would cheerfully desert his venison, and ducks, and pigeons, and salmon, to banquet on the sweets of <b>pickled</b> <b>pork,</b> stringy turnips, and half-cooked cabbage.|$|E
60|$|On {{the very}} first evening after our arrival, Mr. Barkis {{appeared}} in an exceedingly vacant and awkward condition, and with a bundle of oranges tied up in a handkerchief. As he made no allusion of any kind to this property, {{he was supposed to}} have left it behind him by accident when he went away; until Ham, running after him to restore it, came back with the information that it was intended for Peggotty. After that occasion he appeared every evening at exactly the same hour, and always with a little bundle, to which he never alluded, and which he regularly put behind the door and left there. These offerings of affection were of a most various and eccentric description. Among them I remember a double set of pigs' trotters, a huge pin-cushion, half a bushel or so of apples, a pair of jet earrings, some Spanish onions, a box of dominoes, a canary bird and cage, and a leg of <b>pickled</b> <b>pork.</b>|$|E

60|$|When {{the wedding}} come off, I mounted a coat (blue, and bright buttons), {{for the first}} and last time in all my days, and I give Sophy away with my own hand.

Pigeon-pie, a leg of <b>pickled</b> <b>pork,</b> a pair of fowls, and {{suitable}} garden stuff. The best of drinks. I give them a speech, and the gentleman give us a speech, and all our jokes told, and the whole went off like a sky-rocket. In the course of the entertainment I explained to Sophy that I should keep the Library Cart as my living-cart when not upon the road, and that I should keep all her books for her just as they stood, till she come back to claim them. So she went to China with her young husband, and it was a parting sorrowful and heavy, and I got the boy I had another service; and so as of old, when my child and wife were gone, I went plodding along alone, with my whip over my shoulder, at the old horse's head.|$|E
60|$|As for the soil, on {{examination}} Mark {{found it}} had beer, greatly improved by the manure, tillage and water it had received. The hogs were again let in {{to turn it}} over with their snouts, and this they did most effectually in the course of two or three days. By this time, in addition to the three grown porkers our young man possessed, there were no less than nine young ones. This number was getting to be formidable, and he saw the necessity of killing off, in order to keep them within reasonable limits. One of the fattest and best he converted into <b>pickled</b> <b>pork,</b> not from any want of that article, there being still enough left in the ship to last him several years, but because he preferred it corned to that which had been in the salt so long a time. He saw the mistake he had made in allowing the pigs to get to be so large, since the meat would spoil long before he could consume even the smallest-sized shoats. For their own good, however, he was compelled to shoot no less than five, and these he buried entire, in deep places in his garden, having heard that earth which had imbibed animal substances, in this way, was converted into excellent manure.|$|E
6000|$|It is {{a little}} {{singular}} that neither the questions, nor the manner of Pigeonswing, awakened any distrust in the bee-hunter. So far from this, the latter regarded all that had passed as perfectly natural, and as likely to arise in conversation, {{in the way of}} pure speculation, as in any other manner. Pigeonswing intended to be guarded in what he said and did, for, as yet, he had not made up his mind which side he would really espouse, in the event of the great project coming to a head. He had the desire, natural to a red man, to avenge the wrongs committed against his race; but this desire existed in a form a good deal mitigated by his intercourse with the [...] "Yankees," [...] and his regard for individuals. It had, nevertheless, strangely occurred to the savage reasoning of this young warrior that possibly some arrangement might be effected, by means of which he should take scalps from the Canadians, while Peter and his other followers were working their will on the Americans. In this confused condition was the mind of the Chippewa, when he and his companion threw down their loads, near the place where the provision of game was usually kept. This was beneath the tree, near the spring and the cook-house, in order that no inconvenience should arise from its proximity to the place where the party dwelt and slept. For a siege, should there be occasion to shut themselves up within the [...] "garrison," [...] the men depended on the <b>pickled</b> <b>pork,</b> and a quantity of dried meat; of the latter of which the missionary had brought a considerable supply in his own canoe. Among these stores were a few dozen of buffaloes' or bisons' tongues, a delicacy that would honor the best table in the civilized world, though then so common among the western hunters, as scarce to be deemed food as good as the common salted pork and beef of the settlements.|$|E

50|$|Colombian pasteles {{are called}} pastel de arroz cartagenero (rice pasteles) {{and are more}} of a tamale than a typical pastel.

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 6 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, South Africa, 30 June - 2 July, 2008. A conical solar cooker is build based on concentrating solar radiation into heat. The radius of focus and opening of conical concentrator are 0. 15 m and 0. 362 m. It is made of polished, reflective stainless steel. The solar incidence angle can also be changed according to solar times and seasonal factors. Experiments were conducted by cooking rice, boiling the eggs and boiling the <b>pickled</b> mustard green <b>pork.</b> Cooking 300 grams of rice with 900 cm 3 of water, the rice was softened within 30 minutes and the rice was fully cooked within 2 hours at 91 ¬∞C to boil the four eggs completely. Boiling 321 grams of pork with 1 liter of water, after 2 hours the temperature reach to 81 ¬∞C. The experiments revealed that the solar cooker performed efficiently at a solar intensity of 350 W/m 2 and higher. The solar intensity affected the cooking performance. Therefore, for the best results, cooking should be conducted between 9 : 30 am to 3 : 30 p. m. vk 201...|$|R
60|$|Mrs Varden {{opined that}} if he did, {{he ought to be}} ashamed of himself; such sentiments being more {{consistent}} (so she argued) with a benighted Mussulman or wild Islander than with a stanch Protestant. Arguing from this imperfect state of his morals, Mrs Varden further opined that he had never studied the Manual. Hugh admitting that he never had, and moreover that he couldn't read, Mrs Varden declared with much severity, that he ought to be even more ashamed of himself than before, and strongly recommended him to save up his pocket-money for the purchase of one, and further to teach himself the contents with all convenient diligence. She was still pursuing this train of discourse, when Hugh, somewhat unceremoniously and irreverently, followed his young master out, and left her to edify the rest of the company. This she proceeded to do, and finding that Mr Willet's eyes were fixed upon her with an appearance of deep attention, gradually addressed the whole of her discourse to him, whom she entertained with a moral and theological lecture of considerable length, in the conviction that great workings were taking place in his spirit. The simple truth was, however, that Mr Willet, although his eyes were wide open and he saw a woman before him whose head by long and steady looking at seemed to grow bigger and bigger until it filled the whole bar, was to all other intents and purposes fast asleep; and so sat leaning back in his chair with {{his hands in his pockets}} until his son's return caused him to wake up with a deep sigh, and a faint impression that he had been dreaming about <b>pickled</b> <b>pork</b> and greens--a vision of his slumbers which was no doubt referable to the circumstance of Mrs Varden's having frequently pronounced the word 'Grace' with much emphasis; which word, entering the portals of Mr Willet's brain as they stood ajar, and coupling itself with the words 'before meat,' which were there ranging about, did in time suggest a particular kind of meat together with that description of vegetable which is usually its companion.|$|E
6000|$|My {{guests were}} no sooner gone, than I sent for the landlady, to inquire if any court-dresses {{were to be}} had in the neighborhood. She told me plenty might {{certainly}} be had, that were suited to the monikin dimensions, but she much doubted {{whether there was a}} tail in all Leaphigh, natural or artificial, that was at all fit for a person of my stature. This was vexatious; and I was in a brown study, calling up all my resources for the occasion, when Mr. Poke entered the inn, carrying in his hand two as formidable ox-tails as I remember ever to have seen. Throwing one towards me, he said the lord high admiral of Leaphigh had acquainted him that there was an invitation out for the prince and himself, {{as well as for the}} governor of the former, to be present at court within an hour. He had hurried off from what he called a very good dinner, considering there was nothing solid (the captain was particularly fond of <b>pickled</b> <b>pork),</b> to let me know the honor that was intended us; and on the way home, he had fallen in with Dr. Reasono, who, on being acquainted with his errand, had not failed to point out the necessity of the whole party coming en habit de cour. Here was a dilemma, with a vengeance; for the first idea that struck the captain was, [...] "the utter impossibility of finding anything in this way, in all Leaphigh, befitting a lord high admiral of his length of keel; for, as to going in an ordinary monikin queue, why, he should look like a three-decked ship, with a brig's spar stepped for a lower mast!" [...] Dr. Reasono, however, had kindly removed the embarrassment, by conducting him to the cabinet of natural history, where three suitable appendages had been found, viz., two fine relics of oxen, [Footnote: Cauda Bovum.--BUF.] and another, a capital specimen, that had formerly been the mental lever, or, as the captain expressed it, [...] "the steering oar" [...] of a kangaroo. The latter had been sent off, express, with a kind consideration for the honor of Great Britain, to Prince Bob, who was at a villa of one of the royal family, in the neighborhood of Aggregation.|$|E

We also took on board both our vessels forty hogs alive, which served us for fresh provisions, having abundance of food for them, such as the country produced, such as guams, potatoes, and a sort of coarse rice, good for nothing else but to feed the swine. We killed one of these hogs every day, and found them to be excellent meat. We took in also a monstrous quantity of ducks, and cocks and hens, the same kind as we have in England, which we kept for change of provisions; and if I remember right, we had no less than two thousand of them; so that at first we were pestered with them very much, but we soon lessened them by boiling, roasting, stewing, &c., for we never wanted while we had them.|$|R
