40|$|This paper {{provides}} a comprehensive {{analysis of the}} role that financial constraints play in shaping firms' export activities. We use custom information on cross borders transactions for Italian firms, together with an informative measure of financing constraints based on an official credit rating issued by an independent institution. Controlling for potential selection bias our results confirm that limited access to external capital narrows the scale of foreign sales, the exporters' product scope {{and the number of}} trade partners. We enrich previous analyses showing that financial problems influence firms' strategies of switching among <b>products</b> or <b>destinations,</b> and also affect firms' pricing decisions. Constrained firms have a reduced probability of adding new <b>products</b> or <b>destinations</b> and a higher probability of dropping <b>products</b> or <b>destinations.</b> Moreover, they attempt to offset, via higher prices, the negative impact on foreign revenues induced by the decreased physical quantity associated with financial constraints...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how prices set by multinational firms vary across arm's-length and related-party customers. Comparing prices within firms, <b>products,</b> <b>destination</b> countries, modes of transport and month, {{we find that}} the prices U.

This price wedge is smaller for commodities than for differentiated goods, is increasing in firm size and firm export share, and is greater for goods sent to countries with lower corporate tax rates and higher tariffs. We also find that changes in exchange rates have differential effects on arm's-length and related-party prices; an appreciation of the dollar reduces the difference between the prices. ...|$|R

The teamster who {{picks up the}} merchandise is contractually bound to ensure its delivery to the <b>products</b> <b>destination.</b> Using Short Sea Shipping adds two more legs to the shipping equation. The first teamster carries the goods from its point of origin to the port authority, from there by barge or ship to the second port authority. a second teamster then collects the cargo and delivers it to the final destination. This forces the business owner to either work with a single large trucking company working in both ports, or coordinate with two owner-operators independently, and possibly have the cargo sitting on a pierside holding area until a second trucking contract can be agreed upon.|$|R

METHODS: We formed a national consortium (Global TravEpiNet) of 18 US clinics registered to administer yellow fever vaccination. We collected data regarding demographic and health characteristics, <b>destinations,</b> <b>purpose</b> of travel, and pretravel healthcare from 13235 international travelers who sought pretravel consultation at these sites from January 2009 through January 2011. RESULTS: The destinations and itineraries of Global TravEpiNet travelers differed from those of the overall population of US international travelers. The majority of Global TravEpiNet travelers were visiting low- or lower-middle-income countries, and Africa was the most frequently visited region. Seventy-five percent of travelers were visiting malaria-endemic countries, and 38...|$|R

40|$|We use highly {{disaggregated}} firm-level {{export data}} from Costa Rica, Ecuador, and Uruguay {{over the period}} 2005 - 2008 to provide a precise characterization of firms' export margins, across <b>products,</b> <b>destination</b> countries, and crucially customers. We show that a firm's number of buyers {{and the distribution of}} sales across them systematically vary with the characteristics of its destination markets. While most firms serve only very few buyers abroad, the number of buyers and the skewness of sales across them increases with the size and the accessibility of destinations. We develop a simple model of selection with heterogeneous buyers and sellers consistent with these findings in which tougher competition induces a better alignment between consumers' ideal variants and firms' core competencies. This generates an additional channel through which tougher competition leads to higher productivity and higher welfare and hints at an additional source of gains from trade as long as freer trade fosters competition...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To collate and {{synthesize}} current {{knowledge of}} components of urban agriculture (UA) with a thematic emphasis {{on human health}} impact and a geographic emphasis on East Africa. DATA SOURCES: Data management followed a structured approach in which key issues were first identified and then studies selected through literature search and personal communication. DATA EXTRACTION: Evidence-based principles. DATA SYNTHESIS: Urban agriculture is {{an important source of}} food security for urban dwellers in East Africa. Descriptors of UA are location, areas, activities, scale, <b>products,</b> <b>destinations,</b> stakeholders and motivation. Many zoonotic and food-borne diseases have been associated with UA but evidence on human health impact and management is lacking. Major constraints to UA are illegality and lack of access to input and market; policy options have been developed for overcoming these. CONCLUSION: Urban agriculture is an important activity and likely to remain so. Both positive and negative human health impacts are potentially important but {{more research is needed to}} understand these and set appropriate policy and support levels...|$|R
