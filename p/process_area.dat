500|$|Justice Harlan {{advocated}} a broad {{interpretation of the}} Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause. He subscribed to the doctrine that the clause not only provided procedural guarantees, but also protected {{a wide range of}} fundamental rights, including those that were not specifically mentioned in the text of the Constitution. (See substantive due process.) However, as Justice Byron White noted in his dissenting opinion in Moore v. East Cleveland, [...] "no one was more sensitive than Mr. Justice Harlan to any suggestion that his approach to the Due Process Clause would lead to judges 'roaming at large in the constitutional field'." [...] Under Harlan's approach, judges would be limited in the Due <b>Process</b> <b>area</b> by [...] "respect for the teachings of history, solid recognition of the basic values that underlie our society, and wise appreciation of the great roles that the doctrines of federalism and separation of powers have played in establishing and preserving American freedoms".|$|E

40|$|Abstract. SPI and in {{particular}} CMMI is being widely use by several organiza-tions to improve their product quality. However, the SMEs are reluctant in adopting it and {{in particular}} maturity level 2 of CMMI, {{because they think that}} achieving this level is too expensive and do not see a clear benefit on it. Our so-lution to captivate the interest of SMEs in CMMI is the anticipation of some <b>process</b> <b>areas</b> of maturity level 3 considered as a benefit by the organization and implement those <b>process</b> <b>areas</b> at the same time of maturity level 2 of CMMI. In this paper, we identify the dependencies among all the <b>process</b> <b>areas</b> of CMMI and between all the <b>process</b> <b>areas</b> of each maturity level. Our study was con-ducted to identify the impact on the dependencies of maturity level 2 when we introduce some <b>process</b> <b>areas</b> of maturity level 3 in the implementation effort...|$|R

The (100) surface of single crystal silicon was processed by using the mechanism of friction force microscope (FFM). A <b>processed</b> <b>area</b> was protuberated in the condition where normal load is less than 372 μN. The sample processed in this condition was etched by KOH solution. After the etching process, convex structure was made on <b>processed</b> <b>area.</b> The effect of processing condition on etch rate of <b>processed</b> <b>area</b> was studied. It was found that etch rate was changed with normal load, pitch of processing line and number of processing. Also, mechanism of height change was investigated under those conditions and some 3 D microstructure were fabricated by these results...|$|R

The low height protuberance created inside the mechanically <b>processed</b> <b>area</b> was formed by anodizing.|$|R

30|$|For {{sequential}} processing, the resistivity increases by electrical processing {{because of}} anodic oxidation. Then, {{it is possible}} to recover the conductivity of the electrically <b>processed</b> <b>area</b> because of removal of the oxide layer by mechanical processing without vibration. The protuberance composed of the oxidation layer processed by the electrical processing can be removed by an appropriate mechanical processing without vibration. The electric resistance of the mechanically <b>processed</b> <b>area</b> can then be increased because of oxidization by additional electrical processing. Repeatable changes of electrical resistance can be performed.|$|R

The distribution of deposited Pt, Ga from the ion beam itself, and C from the precursor gas was obtained at and nearby the deposited areas by micro-RBS spectra and RBS mapping. All of the beam <b>processed</b> <b>areas</b> showed a uniform Pt distribution at the deposited areas. The amount of Pt atoms increased {{with the increase in}} ion or electron dose due to the decomposition of precursor gas. The thickness or Pt layer by EB is considerably less than that by FIB due to the reduced deposition rate. Ga atoms from the center of <b>processed</b> <b>areas</b> partly redeposited at and nearby the FIB <b>processed</b> <b>areas</b> within 3 mu m. The Ga incorporation by dual beam processing was reduced compared with that by FIB processing.

Using the ground-based LIDAR DEM and the mapped starting zones of the event, the <b>process</b> <b>areas</b> of the debris flows were modelled using a 2 D friction model.
