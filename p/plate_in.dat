40|$|Abstract]: Steel <b>plates</b> <b>in</b> {{double skin}} {{composite}} (DSC) panels are restrained by a concrete core and welded stud shear connectors at discrete positions. Local buckling of steel <b>plates</b> <b>in</b> DSC panels may {{occur in a}} unilateral mode between stud shear connectors when subjected to combined states of stresses. This paper studies the local and postlocal buckling strength of steel <b>plates</b> <b>in</b> DSC panels under biaxial compression and in-plane shear by using the finite element method. Critical local buckling interaction relationships are presented for steel plates with various boundary conditions that include the shear stiffness effects of stud shear connectors. A geometric and material nonlinear analysis is employed to investigate the postlocal buckling interaction strength of steel <b>plates</b> <b>in</b> biaxial compression and shear. The initial imperfections of steel plates, material yielding, and the nonlinear shear–slip behavior of stud shear connectors are considered in the nonlinear analysis. Design models for critical buckling and ultimate strength interactions are proposed for determining the maximum stud spacing and ultimate strength of steel <b>plates</b> <b>in</b> DSC panels...|$|R

They completed his signing after the U15 Sudamericano in which Ocampos excelled for Argentina, signing him on a 50% co-ownership deal with Quilmes.|$|E
5|$|Paradox (18821890) was a British Thoroughbred racehorse and sire. In {{a career}} that lasted from October 1884 until October 1885 he ran eight times and won six races.

His only defeat came when he was narrowly beaten by Melton in The Derby.|$|E

5|$|The Adriatic Sea {{sits on the}} Apulian or Adriatic Microplate, which {{separated}} from the African <b>Plate</b> <b>in</b> the Mesozoic era. The plate's movement contributed {{to the formation of}} the surrounding mountain chains and Apennine tectonic uplift after its collision with the Eurasian <b>plate.</b> <b>In</b> the Late Oligocene, the Apennine Peninsula first formed, separating the Adriatic Basin {{from the rest of the}} Mediterranean. All types of sediment are found in the Adriatic, with the bulk of the material transported by the Po and other rivers on the western coast. The western coast is alluvial or terraced, while the eastern coast is highly indented with pronounced karstification. There are dozens of marine protected areas in the Adriatic, designed to protect the sea's karst habitats and biodiversity. The sea is abundant in flora and fauna—more than 7,000 species are identified as native to the Adriatic, many of them endemic, rare and threatened ones.|$|E

The house was designed by the architect William Buckland in 1773–74 for wealthy farmer Matthias Hammond of Anne Arundel County, Maryland. It was modeled on the design of the Villa Pisani in Montagnana, Italy in Book II, Chapter XIV of I Quattro Libri dell’Achitettura.|$|E

5|$|Beryllium oxide {{is useful}} for many {{applications}} that require the combined properties of an electrical insulator and an excellent heat conductor, with high strength and hardness, and a very high melting point. Beryllium oxide is frequently used as an insulator base <b>plate</b> <b>in</b> high-power transistors in radio frequency transmitters for telecommunications. Beryllium oxide is also being studied for use in increasing the thermal conductivity of uranium dioxide nuclear fuel pellets. Beryllium compounds were used in fluorescent lighting tubes, but this use was discontinued because of the disease berylliosis which developed in the workers who were making the tubes.|$|E
5|$|Douglas {{published}} no {{writings of}} his own and left no records of his ideas and thoughts. The only publication with which he was associated was the Abbey Square Sketch Book, which he edited. The book appeared in three volumes, the first dated 1872 and the others undated; it consisted of sketches and drawings (with some photographs in the third volume) by many contributors. The pictures depicted buildings and furniture, mainly dating from the late medieval period and the 16th and 17thcenturies, and mostly from Cheshire and northwest England. Douglas's only contribution was a jointly ascribed <b>plate</b> <b>in</b> the third volume. It is likely that he designed the title pages, or at least the drawing incorporated in it, of the Abbey Gateway in Chester.|$|E
