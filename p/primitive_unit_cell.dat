The presence of the previously identified Cs 4 linear unit was confirmed; in the present study, the different synthetic route leads to a higher concentration of the tetramer than previously reported, approaching one per <b>primitive</b> <b>unit</b> <b>cell.</b> Detailed structural analysis, using powder neutron diffraction, magnetic susceptibility, and electron spin resonance (ESR) studies, points to the formulation Cs 42 + rather than the previously reported Cs 43 +.

There are indications from the ESR g shift that this paramagnetism may originate from hole-based localized states, perhaps arising out of some partial charge fluctuation in an (otherwise) filled Cs 42 + electronic band.
