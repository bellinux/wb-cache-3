40|$|Strains of the Gram-negative {{bacterium}} Klebsiella pneumoniae secrete <b>pullulanase,</b> a maltose-inducible starch {{debranching enzyme}} that exists as a cell surface bound intermediate. Three classes of secretion mutants {{were obtained by}} transposon In 10 mutagenesis. Class I and class III mutants carry Tn 10 insertions in <b>pullulanase</b> secretion genes. Class II mutants carry insertions in regulatory loci that are required for the high level expression of <b>pullulanase</b> and other maltose-inducible genes (the maltose regulon). One such locus appears to correspond to a previously unknown locus. The phenotypes of the secretion mutants and the analysis of E. coli expressing <b>pullulanase</b> and/or cloned <b>pullulanase</b> secretion genes suggest that <b>pullulanase</b> secretion functions are involved in translocating <b>pullulanase</b> across the outer membrane and in releasing it from the cell surface. Most if not all <b>pullulanase</b> secretion genes are located to {{both sides of the}} structural gene for <b>pullulanase</b> (pu 1 A). <b>Pullulanase</b> was found to be a lipoprotein. Surprisingly, secreted <b>pullulanase</b> also carried lipid. However, strain K 21 differed from other strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae by its ability to secrete not only acylated <b>pullulanase</b> but also a second, unacylated form of <b>pullulanase.</b> Strain K 21 is also unusual because of its ability to secrete most <b>pullulanase</b> during logarithmic growth.

40|$|The use of <b>pullulanase</b> (EC 3. 2. 1. 41) has {{recently}} {{been the subject of}} increased applications in starch-based industries especially those aimed for glucose production. <b>Pullulanase,</b> an important debranching enzyme, has been widely utilised to hydrolyse the α- 1, 6 glucosidic linkages in starch, amylopectin, pullulan, and related oligosaccharides, which enables a complete and efficient conversion of the branched polysaccharides into small fermentable sugars during saccharification process. The industrial manufacturing of glucose involves two successive enzymatic steps: liquefaction, carried out after gelatinisation by the action of α-amylase; saccharification, which results in further transformation of maltodextrins into glucose.

CH_ 3 COONH_ 4 was the most effective nitrogen source for the production of extracellular <b>pullulanase.</b> Liquefied potato starch was found to be the most suitable carbon source in both cases of the intra- and extra-cellular <b>pullulanase</b> production. Mono- and di-saccharides could hardly produce <b>pullulanase</b> which may be an “induced enzyme”. KC 1 was not necessary for <b>pullulanase</b> production.

Both enzymes tested positive for bound sugar by the periodic acid-Schiff technique and are therefore glycoproteins.

Each of these enzymes was able to hydrolyze, in addition to the α- 1, 6 linkages in pullulan, α- 1, 4 linkages in amylose and soluble starch. Neither enzyme possessed activity against maltohexaose or other smaller α- 1, 4 -linked oligosaccharides.

The biodegradation of this cellulosic material is achieved by enzymatic activities of the cellulose degrading microorganisms. These organisms usually express a complex extracellular or a membrane bound cellulolytic system comprising combination of several cellulase enzymes. Cellulases are the group of hydrolytic enzymes capable of hydrolysing insoluble cellulose to glucose. Phlebia gigantea is an aggressive white rot basidiomycete with ability to tolerate resinous extracts on freshly cut wood and higher growth rate. This helps the fungus to colonise the sapwood preventing other fungi from becoming established. Early research on the cellulase system of this organism reported {{the presence of a}} cellulase system composed of β-glucosidase, endoglucanase and a cellobiohydrolase. Based on these unpublished studies, our aim was to obtain a complete sequence of putative cellobiohydrolase I (CbhI) from this organism. Attempts to identify and isolate the cellulase gene resulted in an incomplete cDNA sequence of 1154 bp. To understand the cellulase system, expression and regulation of the cellulase enzymatic activity was examined for incubation of P. gigantea on substrates glucose, xylose, Avicel, carboxymethyl cellulose and cellobiose. The pH, total protein and biomass production results indicated that the capacity of P. gigantea to degrade cellulose is dependent upon the nature of the carbon source and the regulation of the cellulase synthesis is repressed in the presence of simple sugars like glucose and xylose. The study employed the highly effective method of purification by affinity adsorption and purified cellulase complex in large quantity. Characterisation of the kinetic properties of this cellulase complex revealed that the rate of cellulase catalysis were optimum at pH 5. 0 and temperature 50 GC. The purified complex was comprised of multiple proteins and demonstrated significant CMCase and CBHase activity on zymogram analysis. The purified cellulase complex was characterised by 2 D gel electrophoresis and by peptide mass finger printing using MALDI-TOF massspectrometry analysis. The 2 D gel analysis of the purified cellulase complex showed 15 spots within the range of pI 3. 5 to pI 7 and the molecular weight between 20 KDa to 100 KDa. Three protein spots were selected based on the IEF and SDS zymogram and identified using MALDI-TOF MS analysis. These proteins were identified based on the peptide mass data belonging to the 6 -phospho-α-glucosidase, β-glucosidase and glycosyl hydrolase family 13 a-amylase or <b>pullulanases,</b> suggesting the divergent evolution of specific cellulase proteins.

The neopullulanase (<b>pullulanase</b> II) is a 70 -kDa soluble protein which cleaves alpha(1 [...] 4) -D-glucosidic bonds in pullulan to produce panose. The neopullulanase also cleaved alpha(1 [...] 4) bonds in amylose and in oligosaccharides of maltotriose through maltoheptaose in chain length. An alpha-glucosidase from B. thetaiotaomicron 95 - 1 was characterized. The alpha-glucosidase was partially purified to a preparation containing three proteins of 80, 57, and 50 kDa. Pullulan and amylose were not hydrolyzed by the alpha-glucosidase. alpha(1 [...] 4) -D-Glucosidic oligosaccharides from maltose to maltoheptaose were hydrolyzed to glucose by the alpha-glucosidase. The alpha-glucosidase also hydrolyzed alpha(1 [...] 6) -linked oligosaccharides such as panose (the product of the <b>pullulanase</b> II action on pullulan) and isomaltotriose...|$|E
40|$|The <b>pullulanase</b> gene (pul) of Klebsiella aerogenes was cloned into a pBR 322 vector in Escherichia coli. Deletion {{analysis}} of the recombinant plasmid showed that the pul coding sequence, probably with the regulator gene, was located entirely within a 4. 2 -kilobase segment derived from the chromosomal DNA of K. aerogenes. E. coli cells carrying the recombinant plasmids produced about three- to sevenfold more <b>pullulanase</b> than did the wild-type strain of K. aerogenes W 70. When the cloned cells of E. coli were grown with pullulan or maltose, most <b>pullulanase</b> was produced intracellularly, whereas K. aerogenes produced <b>pullulanase</b> extracellularly. Transfer of the plasmid containing the pul gene into K. aerogenes W 70 resulted in about a 20 - to 40 -fold increase in total production of <b>pullulanase,</b> and the intracellular enzyme level was about 100 - to 150 -fold {{higher than that of}} the parent strain W 70.

40|$|Clostridium thermohydrosulfuricum mutant Z 21 - 109 {{produced}} intracellular thermostable <b>pullulanase</b> and glucoamylase activities. The glucoamylase {{activity was}} inactivated by treating C. thermohydrosulfuricum cells with 10 % (v/v) propan- 1 -ol at 85 degrees C {{in the presence}} of 5 mM-CaCl 2. <b>Pullulanase</b> activity was selectively solubilized from cells by treatment with detergent and lipase. The solubilized <b>pullulanase</b> was purified by treatment with streptomycin sulphate and (NH 4) 2 SO 4 and by DEAE-Sephacel, octyl-Sepharose and pullulan-Sepharose chromatography. <b>Pullulanase</b> was purified 3511 -fold and displayed homogeneity on SDS/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis. The <b>pullulanase</b> was a monomeric glycoprotein with an apparent Mr of about 136, 500, and it displayed a pI of 5. 9. The enzyme was enriched in both acidic and hydrophobic amino acids. The purified <b>pullulanase</b> was stable and optimally active at 90 degrees C. The optimum pH for activity and pH-stability ranges were 5. 0 - 5. 5 and 3. 0 - 5. 0 respectively. The enzyme was inhibited by cyclodextrins, EDTA and N-bromosuccinimide, but not by p-chloromercuribenzoate and acarbose. The <b>pullulanase</b> displayed a relative substrate specificity for hydrolysis of pullulan (100 %) versus 75 % for glycogen and 50 % for soluble starch. The apparent Km, Vmax. and Kcat. values for enzyme activity on pullulan at 60 degrees C were 0. 675 mg/ml, 122. 5 mumol of reducing sugar formed/min per mg of protein and 16, 240 min- 1 respectively.

40|$|<b>Pullulanase</b> is a starch-debranching enzyme {{produced}} by the gram-negative bacterium Klebsiella pneumoniae. In this organism, the enzyme is first exported to the outer membrane and is subsequently released into the growth medium. Evidence reported here indicates that <b>pullulanase</b> is a lipoprotein. It is apparently synthesized as a precursor with a 19 -residue-long signal sequence and modified by the covalent attachment of palmitate to the cysteine residue which becomes the amino terminus after cleavage of the signal sequence. In this respect, <b>pullulanase</b> is similar to some penicillinases {{produced by}} gram-positive bacteria which are initially exported to the cell surface and subsequently released into the medium. However, <b>pullulanase</b> and the penicillinases differ in one important aspect, namely, that the extracellular <b>pullulanase</b> still carries the covalently attached fatty acyls, whereas extracellular penicillinases lack the modified amino-terminal cysteine together with {{a limited number of}} other residues from the amino terminus...|$|E

In this present study the enzyme was isolated by the extremophilic strains of Streptococci isolated from extreme conditions. <b>Pullulanase</b> enzyme 98 KDa was successfully produced and purified by the isolated strains. In this process to study enzyme activity the enzyme substrate reaction was performed based on various parameters temperature 50 Â°C, time 72 hours, and pH 6.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} optimization of {{fermentation conditions}} {{for the production of}} thermostable <b>pullulanase</b> from a new strain Bacillus cereus FDTA 13, isolated from tapioca soil. By using one-factor-at-a-time and orthogonal array method, a simple medium with effective and minimal components was optimized for maximal <b>pullulanase</b> production. The optimized medium containing (in g/L) : starch 20, yeast extract 5, NaCl 2, MgSO 4 0. 1 and K 2 HPO 4 0. 17 gave nearly 3. 6 -fold increase in <b>pullulanase</b> activity. Addition of Mn 2 + ions in the optimized medium further enhanced the production by 1. 4 -fold. Effects of proteolytic inhibitors on stability of <b>pullulanase</b> in the medium were studied. A mutant Bacillus cereus FDTA 13 /NTG 04 -B 4, obtained by chemical mutation of the parent strain, further increased the <b>pullulanase</b> production by 2 -fold in optimized medium, and gave similar yield as the parent strain in a medium with lower levels of carbon source...|$|E
40|$|Enzyme {{has been}} used widely in {{industries}} today due to its capability in catalyzing various types of biochemical reactions. However, {{the high cost of}} enzyme gives problems to the enzyme industries. A research was done to optimize the <b>pullulanase</b> activity from Bacillus Acidopullulyticus using experimental design. Two level Full Factorial design was applied in the screening process of four parameters for <b>pullulanase</b> activity and only three parameters were recognized as significant and effective factors for <b>pullulanase</b> activity. The three significant parameters were pH, enzyme and substrate concentration. Thus the three parameters were selected for further optimization studies using response surface methodology (RSM) in Design Expert version 7. 1. 6 software with Central Composite Design (CCD) mode. Thirty four sets of experiments with different parameter values were suggested. The predicted optimum values with R 2 of 0. 8729 for pH, enzyme concentration, substrate concentration and <b>pullulanase</b> activity were 6. 60, 11. 11 U/ml, 4. 44 % (w/v) and 3. 17 U/ml respectively. One validation experiment was run using the optimized parameter and resulted 3. 05 U/ml <b>pullulanase</b> activities as compared to the suggested values of 3. 17 U/ml.

40|$|The {{product of}} the Klebsiella pneumoniae gene pulS, which is located {{downstream}} from the <b>pullulanase</b> structural gene (pulA), {{is essential for the}} cell surface localization and extracellular release of <b>pullulanase</b> in Escherichia coli K- 12. pulS is transcribed in the opposite direction to pulA, from which it is separated by a region of 624 nucleotides. Although this latter region contains a new component of the maltose regulon, pulB, which is transcribed from the pulA promoter, it is not required for <b>pullulanase</b> synthesis or secretion. Unlike pulA and all other <b>pullulanase</b> secretion genes characterized so far, the expression of pulS is not induced by growth in the presence of maltose and is unaffected by mutations in the maltose regulator gene malT. The pulS gene product was identified as a ca. 12 -kilodalton outer membrane lipoprotein.
