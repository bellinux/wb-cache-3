Travelling {{salesman}} problem (TSP) finds its application in many real world industrial applications including the areas such as logistics, transportation, and semiconductor industries. few potential applications of TSP includes finding an optimized scan chains route in integrated chip testing, <b>parcels</b> <b>collection</b> and sending in logistics companies, and transportation routing problem. This paper gives {{a brief overview of}} the various approaches that have been implemented to solve TSP and specifically bee colony optimization (BCO) for solving TSP. The BCO model is constructed algorithmically based on the collective intelligence shown in bee foraging behavior. Keywords- bee colony optimization, foraging behavior, heuristic search, travelling salesman problem, waggle dance I...|$|E

40|$|Geographic Information Systems {{can offer}} rural land {{managers}} an improved means of capturing, storing analysing and communicating {{large quantities of}} varied information in a timely fashion. Land use planning seeks to promote reasonable and equitable patterns of growth to prevent resource depletion or degradation and to offer options for dirrent land use based on the physical capability of the land <b>parcel.</b> The efficient <b>collection,</b> interpretation and dissemination of land resource information for rural land users provides several important benefits. This paper provides a brief explanation of research and the developed concepts involved in proposing a land boundary re-arrangement scheme. This paper also draws on recent expereinces in developing a small Geographic Information System in a rural landscape over a watershed catchment using a modern technogical approach...|$|R

Asks Davall's opinion of "English Botany", which he now claims as his own and its aim "to make botany pleasing & popular, so [Davall] must pardon trifling". Took more pains with "Flora Lapponica", especially the synonyms as he means to correct citation, so it requires more serious criticism. Sends [James] Dickson's third and fourth dried plant fascicules which completes the work, relieved {{to be free from}} its drudgery. Sends pamphlets on the slave trade, "a matter much talked of now".

40|$|In the Walloon Region of Belgium, a commlttee of Intervention {{has been}} created to Investigate {{problems}} of pesticide contamination of various catchments use for drinking water production. This commlttee Involves the Agricultural Research centre - Wallonla (CRA-W, project coordinator) and sorne University experts. It ls funded by the Société Publique de Gestion des Eaux (SPGE). The diagnosis method, base on the AQUAPLAlNE method (Arvalis - France), conslsts of 4 steps. The first step Is the preparation of diagnosls (at the office) {{that takes into account}} the paper r 1 sk of active ingredients. and thelr uses, the identification of the agrtcultural <b>parcels,</b> the <b>collection</b> of cartographie and numeric data, the description of the hydrogeological and pedological contexts and the study of the meteorologlcal data ln relation with the period of pollution. The second step conslsts of maklng a plot diagnosls (on the field) ta Identify the way of transfer inside the plot and collecting data. At the thlrd step, the people who can apply ppp treatment close to the catchment are met (farmers and city services). Information are coJ!ected on treatments applied and on the state of parcels. Based on the hypathesls of pollution cause, the committee proposes solution to solve the problem. One of the catchment that has been investigated by the commlttee is located at Biesmerée, (Namur province, ln Belglum). A temporally contamination was caused by 4 pesticides: chlortoluron, isoproturon, trifluralln and diflufenlcan. After Investigations, it seems that the pollution was probably due ta the hydrogeologlcal context. As the river Is locally perched over the aqulfer, the presence of Poly-aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) could be due ta the Infiltration of surface water inside the catchment or/and to the presence of a sinkhole temparaHy activated durlng river flood period. Infiltration rate has ta be assessed and river bank Impermeabilization Is recommendedPeer reviewe...|$|R
