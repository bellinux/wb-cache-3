40|$|Commercial lettuce, grown principally in the West, is {{produced}} continuously {{throughout the year}} but in different areas with growing periods of various lengths. These various growing periods are due to different seasonal climatological patterns among producing areas. Weekly lettuce shipments are generally dominated by a few growers or grower-shippers with large acreages. Shippers have control over 85 percent of all lettuce planted for some harvesting periods and 65 percent for others, through coordination arrangements with growers. Due to the perishable (non-storable) nature of lettuce, the amount harvested is the amount shipped to consumption centers. The lettuce subsector appears to behave in a coercive (<b>predatory)</b> manner. This <b>conduct</b> {{is evident in the}} long periods of relatively low prices and the short periods of high lettuce prices experienced in the subsector. Lettuce prices are characterized by wide intraseasonal variation largely because of an increasing overlap of harvest periods among producing areas, production expansion to new areas, and weather conditions.

The lack of adequate information about lettuce acreage planted each week contributes to additional uncertainty regarding the decision grow-ers and shippers make about lettuce acreage to be planted at a given time in a particular area.

Symmorphus cristatus exhibits aggressive territorial behavior over nesting and mating sites, but does not respond aggressively to kleptoparasitism by cuckoo wasps Chrysis nitidula. We also compared prey use, nest provisioning and nest architecture of wasps at Big Pine Creek and at Sebastopol, near the central California coast. Using trap-nests we identified two new prey species for S. cristatus at Sebastopol: Plagiodera califomica and Chrysomela schaefferi (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae). There were significant differences in nest architecture for the two allopatric wasp populations and, although they do not use the same prey species, populations did not differ in the mean mass of prey provided for each offspring. Five other cavity-dwelling insect species pre-empted nest sites in Sebastopol. Prey species in Sebastopol differ in the chemistry of their larval secretion. The main component of C. schaeffersi ecretion is salicylaldehyde, which is derived from the willow host plants. Plagiodera califomica secretion contains (epi) plagiolactone, an autogenously produced monoterpene-based defensive secretion.

40|$|The {{showing of}} <b>predatory</b> or exclusionary <b>conduct</b> is a {{necessary}} element to prove an attempted monopolization claim under section 2 of the Sherman Act. Predatory hiring {{as a form of}} exclusionary conduct has not been extensively analyzed from legal or economic perspectives. Most litigated cases have followed Universal Analytics, Inc. v. MacNeal-Schwendler Corp., where the court held that unlawful predatory hiring occurs when talent is acquired not for purposes of using that talent, but for purposes of denying it to a competitor. An anticompetitive act by a single firm is an act that is not profit maximizing but for the monopoly rents the act creates or maintains, but that is profit maximizing inclusive of those monopoly rents. However, a monopolist likely will use and derive profits from important labor talent once acquired, even if the effect of the hiring is anticompetitive. Thus, the current legal standard for proving predatory hiring as an element of an attempted monopolization claim may prevent plaintiffs from successfully prosecuting cases in which antitrust impact and injury exist. Therefore, we argue that the current legal standard required to prove a predatory-hiring claim should be revised. We use a recently litigated matter in the ambulance industry, ICare-EMS v. Rural/Metro, as a case study to make our argument. This case study is particularly revealing because, unlike most litigated matters, internal company documents and deposition testimony from plaintiff and defendant firm witnesses were not designated confidential.

40|$|Coral reef fish coexist in a {{state of}} high {{diversity}} that has not been successfully explained by niche diversification, larval supply, differential mortality, or a suite of other proposed factors. These processes are all occurring on a diverse substrate that would be expected to affect the abundance and distribution of fish by directing habitat preferences as well as affecting competitive and <b>predatory</b> success. I <b>conducted</b> correlational studies on healthy and degraded Caribbean reefs that addressed fish abundances at the levels of community, species, and age class. I also experimentally tested habitat preferences in two ways: choice experiments on adults of common species that determined preferences for live coral and rugosity in an isolated environment, and monitoring of artificial reefs differing in live coral cover that tested habitat selection of adults and juveniles in the field. These observations all show that live coral had no effect on community parameters such as abundance or diversity, but that rugosity was positively related to species richness. However, these measures of the community masked differences at the species and age class level. A handful of species exhibited positive or negative preferences for live coral, but these selections did not follow a taxonomic or trophic-level classification. Species within the genus Stegastes, for example, could either aggregate towards or avoid live coral. One species even reversed its habitat preference as it matured. Field distributions were not determined solely by these habitat preferences, but inclusion of competitive interactions into a multi-factorial model explained distribution of some species. Results suggest that changes in live coral cover, an increasingly common phenomenon, would not affect fish at a community level, but could affect a few species through changes to recruitment or alteration of competitive interactions.

40|$|Two {{major issues}} have led courts and {{antitrust}} enforcers {{to take a}} highly skeptical view when assessing claims of anticompetitive predation. First, predation is an inherently dynamic and strategic phenomenon but the practical tools available to identify predatory behavior {{are based on a}} static, competitive view of markets. Second, there is understandable concern about the potential distortionary implications of punishing firms for competing too intensely. This paper analyzes these problems {{in the context of the}} U. S. airline industry, where there have been frequent allegations of <b>predatory</b> <b>conduct.</b> I first argue, via an explicit dynamic industry model, that certain features of the industry do make it fertile ground for predatory incentives to arise. Specifically, di¤erences in cost structures between large, hub and spoke carriers and small, low cost carriers give incentives for the large carriers to respond aggressively to low cost carriers. I estimate the model parameters and use it to quantify the welfare and behavioral implications of predation policy for a widely discussed case: U. S. vs. American Airlines (2000). To do this, I solve and simulate the model under a menu of counterfactual antitrust predation policies, similar to those employed in practice. I find, for the example of the American case, the potential problems of predation policy are not as severe as the problem of predatory behavior itself...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{developments}} in US anti-trust can be characterised as reflecting the uneasy interaction of two quite separate phenomena: first, the {{increased emphasis on}} economic analysis as the overriding organising principle of anti-trust policy and on economic efficiency as the primary (perhaps only) relevant goal for anti-trust; second, the long-standing reluctance of the federal judiciary to involve itself in any substantive economic analysis, and the preference, instead, for simple rules of thumb or ‘pigeon holes’ to sort out lawful from unlawful conduct. The result has been that while economics has played a major role, it has not influenced American anti-trust as thoroughly or as uniformly as might have been imagined; rather the extent {{and the nature of}} its influence have depended on {{the degree to which the}} relevant economics could be reduced to the kind of simple rules or pigeon holes that the judiciary favours. The present paper will illustrate that theme, first by reporting on the two developments separately and then by illustrating their joint influence with reference to two important areas of American anti-trust: <b>predatory</b> <b>conduct</b> and so-called vertical restraints. Finally, a contrast will be made between judicial development in those two areas and recent American merger policy which, it is argued, is carried out largely independently of the judiciary, and hence the opportunities for economics to influence the process are less inhibited by the judicial reluctance to undertake extensive economic analysis...|$|E

40|$|The wounded {{condition}} of several major American industries, including steel and textiles, resulting from foreign ‘predatory’ conduct has generated much commentary. At the same time, private spokesmen for our institutionalized business interests, including the financial community, have bemoaned American {{balance of trade}} figures, blaming them on such ‘impediments 2 ̆ 7 to our export trade as foreign trade barriers and domestic antitrust laws. The two trade problems suggest a common theme: foreign governments have been unfairly aiding their business interests by protecting monopolized or cartelized foreign markets from American business penetration while also subsidizing, directly or indirectly, foreign invasion of certain targeted American markets. While recognizing subsidized imports and the resulting foreign trade imbalances as trade policy problems, scholars, judges, and governmental officials have also expressed interest in resolving a related domestic competition issue which could help to eliminate <b>predatory</b> <b>conduct</b> in international as well as domestic trade. Through a modest judicial or, if necessary, legislative route, these people seek a clarification of the attempt offense in section 2 of the Sherman Act to bring the law defining attempt to monopolize {{in line with the}} common law and Model Penal Code definitions of criminal attempt. Many circuit courts currently require a showing that the defendant is dangerously close to monopolization before finding an attempt to monopolize. A clarification of the attempt offense would emphasize that victimized American corporations may bring private attempt to monopolize cases against state controlled or subsidized foreign manufacturers that have penetrated American markets through predatory means while their domestic markets remain monopolized. These suits should be allowed even where, as a practical matter, the foreign competitors are not ‘dangerously close’ to monopolizing American markets. This article, in Part I, will review the background and existing state of the law of attempt to monopolize in the Supreme Court and lower federal courts, with particular attention given to the prevailing requirement that the plaintiff show that the defendant is dangerously close to successful monopolization. Part II will focus upon the two major attempt to monopolize cases brought in the last decade by the Department of Justice. The practices challenged in those cases constitute domestic counterparts of some of the alleged predatory practices of foreign competitors, and the cases make clear that the Department has, as a matter of domestic antitrust enforcement, been strongly supportive of the clarification of the attempt offense advocated herein. Part III will review the common law of criminal attempt, which the Supreme Court seems to have recognized as applicable to the Sherman Act, and suggest that it is parallel to the proposal contained in the 1979 National Commission Report to the President concerning the attempt to monopolize provision. That proposal does not require independent proof that a defendant is likely to achieve monopoly power. The article will conclude that a clarification of the attempt to monopolize provision, which would not require independent proof that a defendant is dangerously close to successful monopolization, will resolve an issue of glaring ambiguity in our domestic competition law. The clarification could provide a legitimate weapon for our domestic industries to use against truly predatory foreign competition, while not directly involving United States foreign trade policy and avoiding traditional forms of economic retaliation damaging to world markets...|$|E
40|$|D. Comm. Economic {{conditions}} in deregulated {{domestic air transport}} markets developed differently from what was originally anticipated and the commercial conduct of airlines also differed from the conduct foreseen {{at the time of}} deregulation. The result was also different from what governments that had implemented air transport policies based on economic deregulation had expected. The overall result in such deregulated market was more consolidation and less competition than had originally been anticipated. It has been established that market access by means of economic deregulation is not sufficient to ensure a competitive domestic air transport market. Certain regulatory steps need to be taken to promote competition in the domestic air transport industry. It was established that competition in the airline industry differs from competition in many other industries in the following respects: •Airlines compete over networks. •Airlines compete using multiple competitive tools. •The air transport industry, as a network industry, has fundamentally different characteristics from those of the other industries on which traditional classic microeconomic models have been based. Apart from supply side efficiencies that are central in the traditional microeconomic models, the demand side effects within the airline industry have given rise to many of the commercial practices that the airlines have perfected (like loyalty programmes, including FFPs). These commercial practices have been designed to raise the switching costs for users of air services to change suppliers and to reduce the level of competition for the preferred customers. This would have {{to be taken into account}} in the formulation of policy. It was found that certain economic features of network industries, however, are also applicable in the airline industry and that this creates competition concerns as a result of the following features: •The bigger the network of an airline, the more useful it is. •The demand for air services on a particular airport-pair, city-pair, or even country-pair is derived from a multitude of separate origin/destination markets - a fact which creates a need for complex market definitions in airline competition. •The “indivisibility” of seating capacity on aircraft and of the deployment of aircraft within route networks can result in extremely low short-run marginal costs, with consequent difficulties in applying competition law to cases involving allegations of predatory pricing. •Many of the costs are sunk and unrecoverable once they are committed. •There is a history relating to cyclical provision of an overall excess capacity in the industry. Economies of scope in the airline industry clearly indicate that a larger network of services would be more attractive to the traveller, since the traveller will have more destinations and frequency of services to choose from and have a larger probability of finding a suitable connection from the passenger’s particular origin to any given destination. In particular, on a firm level, it has been found that economies of scope on the demand side are intensified by certain airline marketing practices including: •Frequent flyer programmes (FFPs). •Travel agent overriding commission agreements (TACOs). •Corporate discount schemes. The above create synthetic economies of scope on the demand side of the airline industry as they make it more attractive for passengers and travel agents to concentrate their demand on one airline and increase the loyalty of the customers towards the airline through an artificial increase in the switching costs. Predatory behaviour in the airline industry differs from such behaviour in other industries, where it mostly revolves around the approach of predatory pricing, as the increase of the provision of capacity cannot normally be implemented or dispersed as rapidly in other industries as in the airline industry. The air transportation industry was found to be especially susceptible to predatory responses of dominant airlines compared to dominant firms in other industries owing to the following factors: •Mobility of aircraft, as incumbents incur virtually no additional sunk costs when they increase capacity on challenged routes, while new entrants can be readily induced to depart because of their ability to move their equipment out of particular routes. As a result, network airlines can shift resources between markets much more readily to increase service frequency and capture a disproportionate share of traffic. •Access of airlines to comprehensive, “real time” information on their competitors’ activities through booking and other data generated by computer reservations systems (CRS). •Extreme sophistication of the yield-management practices of the major airlines using CRS, which enables such airlines to increase sharply the availability of deeply discounted fares on individual routes in response to competitive challenge and to withdraw them when the challenge disappears. •Ability of a major airline to price-discriminate to a much greater extent and to adjust its prices much faster in advance of flights actually taking place. As a result, airlines can respond to competitive initiatives more precisely and swiftly than enterprises in other industries, which implies that the competition rules should take cognisance of the differences in the commercial practices of airlines in the air transportation industry compared to those of enterprises in other industries. A number of problems relating to the competition policy and legislation in South Africa have been identified. They included the following: •Prohibited agreements are not immediately void in terms of the South African Competition Act. •Applying a narrow cost based standard of marginal or average variable cost is inappropriate for the airline industry in South Africa when compared to the principle of avoidable cost. •No specific guidance currently exists in the domestic air transport industry in South Africa relating to the particular forms of conduct that would be regarded as having an anti-competitive effect. •No measures currently exist in South Africa that enable the competition authorities to respond timeously (as required in the airline industry) to prevent anti-competitive or <b>predatory</b> <b>conduct,</b> to stop such conduct (in contravention of those guidelines) by means of cease and desist orders and effective interim orders where there is a danger that competition will be eliminated. •The dominant airline in South Africa, South African Airways (SAA), which is owned by the State, has not achieved an adequate return on assets and has received substantial financial state aid without any published conditions that would mitigate the anti-competitive effect of such state aid and promote competition in the air transport market. The risk of such state aid could enable the dominant state-owned airline, SAA, to: Deploy too much capacity on an uneconomical basis. Operate many services (frequency) at a lower income level than the cost of providing such services. Dump excess capacity on competitive routes at a lower fare than needed to provide a reasonable return on assets, and Conduct operations with the objective of earning a lower return on investment than would be required as a reasonable return on assets by competitors that are subject to normal financial markets and do not receive state financial aid. This study specifically dealt with: •The specific commercial practices adopted by airlines in domestic passenger air transport markets as well as the use of a combination of commercial practices in an anti-competitive or predatory manner. Some measures adopted elsewhere to mitigate the anti-competitive effect of such commercial practices and to stimulate competition following economic deregulation or liberalisation of such domestic air transport markets were identified. •Most importantly, the occurrence of anti-competitive conduct as well as predatory behaviour by airlines was investigated: generally, and specifically in the United States of America (USA) as well as in Canada. It was found that, in particular, <b>predatory</b> <b>conduct</b> in the airline industry that involves price cuts combined with significant capacity expansion by dominant incumbent airlines appears to be the most troublesome in domestic air transport industries in respect of a number of jurisdictions. In addition, it was established that incumbent airlines also conduct predatory actions in response to new entry by using tools other than price and quantity. An important recommendation is that a policy objective approach should be adopted to enhance or promote competition as criteria for regulatory consideration in the South African domestic air transport market. In this regard, the recommendations include an active involvement by the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) in matters affecting competition in the South African domestic air transport market and that the Competition Commission, the Commissioner of Competition and the Competition Tribunal be given greater authority to specifically deal with particular aspects of concern relating to the air transport market. Recommendations have also been made relating to competition policy, competition legislation and some commercial practices within the domestic air transport industry in order to promote competitiveness in the South African domestic air transport industry.
