40|$|Total {{reflection}} X-ray fluorescence (TXRF) {{is becoming}} more and more popular for elemental analysis in academia and industry. However, simplification of the procedures for analyzing samples with complex compositions and residual matrix effects is still needed. In this work, the effect of an inorganic (CaCl 2) and an organic (tetraalkylphosphonium chloride) matrix on metals quantification by TXRF was investigated for liquid samples. The samples were spiked with up to 20 metals at concentrations ranging from 3 to 50 mg L– 1 per element, including elements with spectral peaks near the peaks of the matrix elements or near the Raleigh and Compton scattering peaks of the X-ray source (molybdenum anode). The recovery rate (RR) and the relative standard deviation (RSD) were calculated to express the accuracy and the precision of the measured element concentrations. In samples with no matrix effects, good RRs are obtained regardless of the internal standard selected. However, in samples with moderate matrix content, the use of an optimum internal standard (OIS) at a concentration close to that of the analyte significantly improved the quantitative analysis. In samples with high concentrations of inorganic ions, using a Triton X- 100 aqueous solution to dilute the sample during the internal standardization resulted in better RRs and lower RSDs compared to using only water. In samples with a high concentration of organic material, pure ethanol gave slightly better results than when a Triton X- 100 –ethanol solution was used for dilution. Compared to previous methods reported in the literature, the new sample-preparation method gave better accuracy, precision, and sensitivity for the elements tested. Sample dilution with an OIS and the surfactant Triton X- 100 (inorganic media) or ethanol (organic media) is recommended for fast routine elemental determination in matrix containing samples, as it does not require special equipment, experimentally derived case-dependent mathematical corrections, or <b>physicochemical</b> <b>removal</b> of interfering elements. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{possibility}} to use low-pressure, nonequilibrium plasma discharges for decontamination and sterilization of surfaces of medical equipment is nowadays gaining increased attention. The primary interest {{of this technique}} is related mainly to its capability to inactivate effectively infectious microorganisms including highly resistant bacterial spores [1 - 3] without using toxic substances and at low-temperature process conditions required {{for the treatment of}} heat degradable materials. Moreover, recent results revealed the ability of plasma discharges to inactivate or also eliminate other kinds of biological pathogens such as bacterial endotoxins [3 - 5] or proteins [3, 6 - 8]. Especially, the latter makes the plasma treatment a real alternative to the commonly used decontamination techniques that are in many cases insufficient to assure complete elimination of residual biological contamination. '' Naturally, distinct characteristics of biological pathogens imply different strategies for their destruction: living microorganisms can be readily inactivated by intense UV radiation emitted by plasma discharges [1], in contrast to the elimination of pathogenic biomolecules from surfaces, where <b>physicochemical</b> <b>removal</b> is needed [l 0]. However, it is clear that any process that is intended to be effective and universal for complete elimination of biological contamination has to combine both pathways. Recently, {{it has been suggested that}} this can be fulfilled by using an inductively coupled plasma (ICP) discharge sustained in a ternary Ar/ 02 /N 2 discharge mixture combining high emission of UV radiation in the spectral range suitable for the sterilization of bacterial spores with fast erosion and removal of biomolecules [11, 12]. Nevertheless, the latter has been, up to now, demonstrated solely on bovine serum albumin and no effort has been devoted to test whether it is possible to eliminate a wider range of biological agents, that is, an aspect important for the demonstration of the universality of this sterilization/decontamination approach. Therefore, in this study to fill this experimental gap, the feasibility of low-pressure Ar/ 02 /N 2 ICP discharge to remove other biological systems differing significantly in their properties, namely, bacterial spores and biomolecules in general, is investigated. Moreover, to highlight the advantageous properties of Ar/ 02 /N 2 mixture, the results are compared directly with the results obtained by using Ar and Ar/Oz plasma treatment. JRC. DG.

50|$|In many cases, as {{in various}} {{high-temperature}} catalytic applications of Au, {{the removal of}} the capping ligands produces more desirable <b>physicochemical</b> properties. The <b>removal</b> of ligands from colloidal gold while maintaining a relatively constant number of Au atoms per Au NP can be difficult due to the tendency for these bare clusters to aggregate. The removal of ligands is partially achievable by simply washing away all excess capping ligands, though this method is ineffective in removing all capping ligand. More often ligand removal achieved under high temperature or light ablation followed by washing. Alternatively, the ligands can be electrochemically etched off.|$|R
40|$|Background and Objectives: Contamination of {{drinking}} water sources with nitrate may cause adverse effects on human health. Due to operational and maintenance problems of <b>physicochemical</b> nitrate <b>removal</b> processes, using biological denitrification processes have been performed. The {{aim of this study}} is to evaluate nitrate removal efficiency from drinking water using autotrophic denitrifying bacteria immobilized on sulfur impregnated activated carbon in a fluidized bed bioreactor. Materials and Methods: After impregnating activated carbon by sulfur as a microorganism carriers and enrichment and inoculation of denitrifying bacteria, a laboratory-scale fluidized bed bioreactor was operated. Nitrate removal efficiency, nitrite, turbidity, hardness and TOC in the effluent were examined during the whole experiment under various conditions including constant influent nitrate concentration as 90 mg NO 3 [...] N/l corresponding to different HRT ranging from 5. 53 to 1. 5 hr. Results: We found that  the denitrification rates was depended on the hydraulic retention time and the nitrate removal efficiency was up to 98 %  and nitrite concentration was lower than 1 mg/l at optimum HRT= 2. 4 hr respectively. Moreover, there was no difference in hardness between influent and effluent due to supplying sodium bicarbonate as carbon source for denitrifying bacteria.   However pH, TOC, hardness, and turbidity of the effluent met the W. H. O guidelines for drinking water.   Conclusion: This study demonstrated that an innovative carrier as sulfur impregnated activated carbon could be used as both the biofilm carrier and energy source for treating nitrate contaminated drinking water in the lab-scale fluidized bed bioreactor...|$|R
