50|$|The AAW team {{knew that}} the car would not last the whole race, so they fueled it for only ten laps {{in order to make}} a quick press run. This {{compensated}} the overweight of their TS16 and Kinnunen managed to overtake five cars in eight laps before a spark plug problem forced him to retire. Kinnunen later told that one spark <b>plug</b> <b>thread</b> in the cylinder head had been stripped. A Ferrari mechanic loaned them a threaded insert kit to fix it but the Finns did not master the method and the plug never seated properly.|$|E
5000|$|Over {{the years}} {{variations}} on the basic spark plug design have attempted to provide either better ignition, longer life, or both. Such variations {{include the use of}} two, three, or four equally spaced ground electrodes surrounding the central electrode. Other variations include using a recessed central electrode surrounded by the spark <b>plug</b> <b>thread,</b> which effectively becomes the ground electrode (see [...] "surface-discharge spark plug", below). Also there is the use of a V-shaped notch in the tip of the ground electrode. Multiple ground electrodes generally provide longer life, as when the spark gap widens due to electric discharge wear, the spark moves to another closer ground electrode. The disadvantage of multiple ground electrodes is that a shielding effect can occur in the engine combustion chamber inhibiting the flame face as the fuel air mixture burns. This can result in a less efficient burn and increased fuel consumption.|$|E
5000|$|The metal case/shell (or the jacket, as {{many people}} call it) of the spark plug withstands the torque of {{tightening}} the plug, serves to remove heat from the insulator and {{pass it on to}} the cylinder head, and acts as the ground for the sparks passing through the central electrode to the side electrode. Spark <b>plug</b> <b>threads</b> are cold rolled to prevent thermal cycle fatigue. It's important to install spark plugs with the correct [...] "reach," [...] or <b>thread</b> length. Spark <b>plugs</b> can vary in reach from 0.0375 to 1.043 in, such for automotive and small engine applications. Also, a marine spark plug's shell is double-dipped, zinc-chromate coated metal.|$|R
50|$|<b>Threaded</b> <b>plug</b> valves {{are used}} {{significantly}} in air-sensitive chemistry {{as well as}} when a vessel must be closed completely {{as in the case}} of Schlenk bombs. The construction of a <b>threaded</b> <b>plug</b> valve involves a <b>plug</b> with a <b>threaded</b> cap which are made so that they fit with the threading on a corresponding piece of female glass. Screwing the plug in part-way first engages one or more O-rings, made of rubber or plastic, near the plug's base, which seals the female joint off from the outer atmosphere. Screwing the plug valve all the way in engages the plug's tip with a beveled constriction in the glass, which provides a second seal. This seal separates the region beyond the bevel and the O-rings already mentioned.|$|R
5000|$|Both tools {{can be used}} {{to clean}} up a thread, which is called chasing. However, using an {{ordinary}} tap or die to clean threads will generally result in the removal of some material, which will result in looser and weaker threads. Because of this, threads are typically cleaned using special taps and dies made for this purpose, which are known as [...] "chasers". Chasers are made of softer materials and are not capable of cutting new threads, however they are still tighter fitting than actual fasteners and are fluted like regular taps and dies (to provide a means for debris like dirt and rust to escape). One particularly common use is for automotive spark <b>plug</b> <b>threads,</b> which often suffer from corrosion and a buildup of carbon.|$|R

50|$|Valves {{are used}} to {{redirect}} flows through pipes. Two types of valves used in laboratory glassware are the stopcock valve and the <b>threaded</b> <b>plug</b> valve. These and other terms used below are defined in detail since they are bound to conflict with different sources.|$|R
50|$|A plug fits {{inside the}} pipe segment or fitting {{to which it}} is mated. In a <b>threaded</b> {{plumbing}} system, <b>plugs</b> have male <b>threads.</b> There are a number of plug types: mechanical, pneumatic-disk, single-size pneumatic rubber, multi-size pneumatic and flow-through, and high-pressure. Special temporary plugs, usually made of flexible rubber, may be installed into a plumbing system to allow pressure testing for leakage.|$|R
50|$|Simple BFAs {{for these}} {{firearms}} {{consist of a}} metal <b>plug</b> with screw <b>threads.</b> The adapter {{is attached to the}} muzzle of the firearm, and may attach to or replace the muzzle brake if there is one. A means is provided to allow some of the powder gases to escape. This can be adjustable, allowing it to regulate the amount of pressure used to rechamber the next round.|$|R
5000|$|On 4 October 2005, a team {{of track}} {{maintenance}} staff was working {{by a set of}} points at Kelvedon when the 13:30 passenger train from [...] to Liverpool Street passed through the station. The team had taken refuge in a place of safety as the train passed, but one of them was injured by a steel <b>threaded</b> <b>plug</b> which flew off the moving locomotive, which was travelling at speed. The worker suffered a fracture to his skull and injury to his hand.|$|R
50|$|On {{reassembly}} {{care should}} be taken that the <b>threaded</b> <b>plugs</b> are replaced in their original holes: the tapers can vary {{as a result of}} rethreading. The mudhole door gaskets, if of asbestos, should be renewed but those made of lead may be reused; special instructions are in force for the disposal of these harmful materials. At large maintenance facilities the boiler would have been both washed and refilled with very hot water from an external supply to bring the locomotive back to service more quickly.|$|R
5|$|A fusible <b>plug</b> is a <b>threaded</b> metal {{cylinder}} usually of bronze, brass or gunmetal, with a {{tapered hole}} drilled completely through its length. This hole is sealed {{with a metal}} {{of low melting point}} that flows away if a pre-determined, high temperature is reached. The initial use of the fusible plug was as a safety precaution against low water levels in steam engine boilers, but later applications extended its use to other closed vessels, such as air conditioning systems and tanks for transporting corrosive or liquefied petroleum gasses.|$|R
40|$|Abstract This paper {{describes}} a novel optical <b>thread</b> <b>plug</b> gauge (OTPG) for internal thread inspection using machine vision. The OTPG {{is composed of}} a rigid industrial endoscope, a charge-coupled device camera, and a two degree-of-freedom motion control unit. A sequence of partial wall images of an internal thread are retrieved and reconstructed into a 2 D unwrapped image. Then, a digital image processing and classification procedure is used to normalize, segment, and determine {{the quality of the}} internal thread. The proposed OTPG provides an orientation-free and convenient method for detecting defects such as scratches, collapses, and flaws in an internal thread. Keywords Internal thread.

40|$|A low {{pressure}} loss injector element is disclosed {{for the main}} combustion chamber of a rocket engine which includes a lox post terminating in a cylindrical barrel. Received within the barrel is a lox <b>plug</b> which is <b>threaded</b> in the lox post and includes an interchangeable lox metering sieve which meters the lox into an annular lox passage. A second annular gas passage is coaxial with the annular lox passage. A cylindrical sleeve surrounds the annular gas passage and includes an interchangeable gas metering seive having metering orifices through which a hot gas passes into the annular passage. The jets which emerge from the annular lox passage and annular gas passage intersect in a recessed area away from the combustion area. Thus, mixing and combustion stability are enhanced...|$|R
40|$|The article {{presents}} a methodology for modelling {{the control of}} a <b>threaded</b> <b>plug</b> gauge. There had been examined works of scientists who had studied the aspects of the average thread diameter control and studied the problems of providing and {{improving the quality of}} threaded joints. At a modern machine-building enterprise, threaded gauges are important in controlling threaded joints of parts. There had been built a functional model of the caliber life-cycle. The article shows possible applications of threaded gauges and examines the method of automating the average thread diameter control on a universal three-axis measuring video microscope. The application of this method is expedient in the conditions of modern production, since that usage reduces time expenses and requirements for the operators' qualification, as well as increases the reliability {{of the results of the}} average thread diameter control...|$|R
50|$|Older, green coloured, {{suspension}} spheres typically last between 60,000 and 100,000 km. Spheres {{once had}} a <b>threaded</b> <b>plug</b> on top for recharging. Newer spheres do not have this plug, {{but it can be}} retrofitted enabling them to be re-gassed. The sphere membrane has an indefinite life unless run at low pressure, which leads to rupture. Timely recharging, approximately every 3 years, is thus vital. A ruptured membrane means suspension loss at the attached wheel, however, ride height is unaffected. With no springing other than the (slight) flexibility of tyres, hitting a pothole with a flat sphere can bend the suspension parts or dent a wheel rim. In the case of main accumulator sphere failure, the high pressure pump is the only source of braking pressure for the front wheels. Some older cars had a separate front brake accumulator on power steering models.|$|R
5000|$|For {{situations}} where more firepower was necessary, the concealable pistol was modified {{to accept a}} barrel extension with hand-grip and silencer, a Phantom Bushnell pistol scope, an extended magazine and a collapsible shoulder stock. The bird cage suppressor, silencer and barrel extension were attached by <b>threaded</b> <b>plugs.</b> Though a sophisticated weapon on screen, the U.N.C.L.E. Special Carbine in reality could not shoot real bullets, only blanks. However the pistol alone was still a working firearm. It was also modified by the studio {{to allow it to}} fire in full automatic [...] "machine gun" [...] mode. Unfortunately, this caught the attention of the US Treasury Department- the manufacture of automatic weapons without a license is very illegal, and the show nearly had the guns confiscated. In the end MGM was fined $2000 and the matter was closed.|$|R
50|$|Gauge blocks {{are usually}} made either from {{hardened}} alloy tool steels or from cemented carbides (such as tungsten carbide or tantalum carbide). Often the carbide has a hardness of 1500 Vickers hardness. Long series blocks {{are made from}} high-quality steel having cross section (35 × 9 mm) with holes for clamping two slips together. These are also available in carbon steel material. Steel blocks are hardened and tempered. The hardness {{is important because it}} slows down the gauge's rate of wear during use (this is why other kinds of gauges, such as pins, <b>thread</b> <b>plugs,</b> and rings, are also hardened.) The cutting of the blocks to size is accomplished with grinding followed by lapping. Usually no plating or other coating is involved. Blocks are kept very lightly oiled, and are stored and used in dry climate-controlled conditions; unplated, uncoated steel gauge blocks can last for decades without rusting.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} Mk 2 grenade had a 3/8-inch (9.6 mm) <b>threaded</b> <b>plug</b> in its base, which {{covered the}} opening used {{to place the}} explosive filling, either 1.85 oz (52 g) of TNT, 2.33 oz (66 g) of Trojan explosive (a mixture of 40% nitrostarch, ammonium nitrate, and sodium nitrate), 1.85 oz (52 g) of a 50/50 amatol/nitrostarch mixture, or 1.85 oz (52 g) of Grenite (a mixture of 95% nitrostarch and binders). Some early Mk 2 grenades were filled with 0.74 oz (21 g) of smokeless EC powder. The improved [...] "Mk 2A1" [...] (a designation used informally by armorers, historians, and collectors but was never officially by the US military) introduced in 1942 was filled through the fuse well instead. The Mk 2A1 was initially filled with 0.74 oz (21 g) of EC powder. In 1944, the EC powder filling was replaced with 1.85 oz (52 g) of TNT.|$|R
50|$|A helical insert is {{an insert}} made of coiled wire. The {{helically}} formed coils of diamond shaped stainless steel or phosphor bronze wire screw into a threaded hole {{to form a}} mating internal thread for a screw or stud. These inserts provide a convenient means of repairing stripped-out threads and are also used to provide stronger threads in soft materials such as aluminium, zinc die castings, wood, magnesium etc. than {{can be obtained by}} direct tapping of the base metal involved. Another common generic name is screw thread insert (STI), although many users persist in calling them all by a prominent brand name, the registered trademark Heli-Coil. Applications include engine cylinder head repair after unintentional over-torquing or cross-threading of spark <b>plugs</b> strips the <b>thread</b> of the socket. Kits with matched tap and coil exist for this. The straight radial piece in the photo is the driver tang which is used as a key to grip with pliers for driving the coil into place and is discarded after installation.|$|R
40|$|Design {{with rubber}} (elastomer) - metal {{elements}} (futter- RME) successfully {{used for the}} construction machine. Due to the continual development of machinery and equipment, are ever increasing in intensity and dynamic load requirements {{of the components of}} the relative position accuracy. Detail the relative position variation (such as radial, sharp and angular displacement transmission shafts, bearings sitting inaccuracies, delays <b>threaded</b> <b>plugs,</b> etc.) May result from deficiencies in the assembly, temperature changes and deformation forces, process constraints. To analyze the RME construction work need to know elastomer mechanical modules. In work it is offered to define factor of Poisson's ratio from experiments on axial compression of multilayered packages from thin-layer elastomer layer. To exclude influence of ruggedness of experimental installation on the indication of devices, it is offered to select number of layers in a package and geometrical parameters elastomer layers so that deposit of a layer at the expense of change of its form and compressibility elastomer, were one order. For processing of experimental data it is offered to use analytical decisions ("force-settlement") for a package from thin elastomer layers. The calculation example confirms applicability of the considered technique for definition of factor of Poisson's ratio for elastomer...|$|R
5000|$|Hemostasis {{occurs when}} blood is present {{outside of the}} body or blood vessels. It is the instinctive {{response}} for the body to stop bleeding and loss of blood. During hemostasis three steps occur in a rapid sequence. Vascular spasm is the first response as the blood vessels constrict to allow less blood to be lost. In the second step, platelet plug formation, platelets stick {{together to form a}} temporary seal to cover the break in the vessel wall. The third and last step is called coagulation or blood clotting. Coagulation reinforces the platelet <b>plug</b> with fibrin <b>threads</b> that act as a [...] "molecular glue". Platelets are a large factor in the hemostatic process. They allow for the creation of the [...] "platelet plug" [...] that forms almost directly after a blood vessel has been ruptured. Within seconds of a blood vessel's epithelial wall being disrupted platelets begin to adhere to the sub-endothelium surface. It takes approximately sixty seconds until the first fibrin strands begin to intersperse among the wound. After several minutes the platelet plug is completely formed by fibrin. Hemostasis is maintained in the body via three mechanisms: ...|$|R
50|$|The {{engine block}} {{is made from}} high {{pressure}} die-cast aluminum which results in considerable weight savings - the entire engine with a manual gearbox only weighs 82.4 kg. The main block features a ladder frame construction for structural stiffness while its cylinders are fitted with cast-iron liners for improved abrasion durability. Additional weight was shaved off by integrating the engine support bracket with the timing chain cover. The shape of the piston skirt was optimized to reduce its size while the compression height of the piston was also reduced, resulting in weight savings. The optimized piston skirt is also treated with molybdenum disulfide. A highly sophisticated process of Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD) is used to apply an ultra-thin layer of Chromium Nitride to the piston’s oil ring. Chromium Nitride-coated piston rings using PVD is an innovative technology borrowed from the Hyundai Tau engine introduced earlier. Friction between the oil ring and cylinder wall has been further minimized by reducing the oil ring tension. The Kappa engine is the first Hyundai engine to be fitted with an accessory drive belt which {{does not require a}} mechanical auto-tensioning adjustment device, reducing the hardware and further lowering weight and cost. Because it is designed to maintain an ideal tension setting, the belt runs quieter and with proper preventative maintenance and care, the belt will last 100,000 mi/160,000 km. For ignition, the Kappa engine uses a new, longer reach spark plug which enabled engineers to enlarge the size of the water jacket to promote more efficient engine cooling around the critically important spark plug and exhaust port area. The long reach spark <b>plug</b> (M12 <b>thread)</b> also enabled engineers to enlarge the valve diameter for increased airflow and combustion efficiency. A lightweight, heat-resistant engineering plastic was used for the intake manifold. The fuel delivery pipe assembly is a returnless type (to eliminate evaporative fuel emissions) and is made of SUS (steel use stainless) with a specially designed inner structure for the reduction of pulsation noise.|$|R
2500|$|The {{manufacturing}} process {{was similar to}} that used for artillery shells, except that actual pieces of coal were used as patterns for iron castings.

40|$|A {{multistage}} electrophoresis apparatus {{has been}} invented {{for use in}} the separation of cells, protein molecules, and other particles and solutes in concentrated aqueous solutions and suspensions. The design exploits free electrophoresis but overcomes the deficiencies of prior free-electrophoretic separators by incorporating a combination of published advances in mathematical modeling of convection, sedimentation, electro-osmotic flow, and the sedimentation and aggregation of droplets. In comparison with other electrophoretic separators, these apparatuses are easier to use and are better suited to separation in relatively large quantities characterized in the art as preparative (in contradistinction to smaller quantities characterized in the art as analytical). In a multistage electrophoretic separator according to the invention, an applied vertical steady electric field draws the electrically charged particles of interest from within a cuvette to within a collection cavity that has been moved into position of the cuvette. There are multiple collection cavities arranged in a circle; each is aligned with the cuvette for a prescribed short time. The multistage, short-migration-path character of the invention solves, possibly for the first time, the fluid-instability problems associated with free electrophoresis. The figure shows a prototype multistage electrophoretic separator that includes four sample stations and five collection stages per sample. At each sample station, an aqueous solution or suspension containing charged species to be separated is loaded into a cuvette, which is machined into a top plate. The apparatus includes a lower plate, into which 20 collection cavities have been milled. Each cavity is filled with an electrophoresis buffer solution. For the collection of an electrophoretic fraction, the lower plate is rotated to move a designated collection cavity into alignment {{with the opening of the}} cuvette. An electric field is then applied between a non-gassing electrode in the collection cavity and an electrolyte compartment, which is separated from the cuvette by a semipermeable membrane. The electrolyte is refreshed by circulation by use of a peristaltic pump. In subsequent steps, the lower plate is rotated to collect other electrophoretic fractions. Later, the collected fractions are removed from the collection cavities through ports that have <b>threaded</b> <b>plugs.</b> The base of the apparatus contains power supplies and a computer interface. The design includes provisions for monitoring and feedback control of cavity position, electric field, and temperature. The operation of the apparatus can easily be automated, as demonstrated by use of software that has already been written for this purpose...|$|R
