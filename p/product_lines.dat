40|$|Software <b>product</b> <b>line</b> {{engineering}} is a proposed methodology that enables software products and software-intensive systems {{to be developed}} at lower cost, higher quality and less time to market. The structured and managed artifacts reuse among different products in development is the main target of software <b>product</b> <b>line</b> engineering. As a key-method of the <b>product</b> <b>line</b> engineering approach, the commonality and variability analysis is a technique that identifies the potential artifacts for reuse. But the reuse poses challenges for delivering safety-critical products from the <b>product</b> <b>line</b> and achieving <b>product</b> <b>line</b> functional safety. In order to analyze the <b>product</b> <b>line</b> and provide more valuable information for its safety analysis, we make use of established <b>product</b> <b>line</b> modeling techniques, which model the <b>product</b> <b>line</b> commonality and variability from different perspectives. In this report, we investigate the <b>product</b> <b>line</b> modeling techniques. The product modeling analysis process covers two aspects: 1. Study different <b>product</b> <b>line</b> modeling techniques and find the ones suitable for <b>product</b> <b>line</b> modeling. We choose the modeling techniques that can be implemented to discuss in detail. 2. We implement the industrial wheel loader <b>product</b> <b>line</b> with two modeling techniques.

Manufacturers have reacted to the growing trend of artists transforming dolls by hiring reborn artists to become doll sculptors and design doll molds and kits. When newborning from a kit, the first several steps of the process are completed by reborn sculpt artists and doll manufacturers. The kits come with an already disassembled baby and select supplies. Other supplies not provided in the kit can be purchased separately. The Secrist doll company started making Reborn Doll Kits in 2005. In 2009, they began producing supplies, tools, and tutorial videos specifically for reborning or newborning.

5|$|Attempting {{to combine}} his two main <b>product</b> <b>lines,</b> cars and stereos, Muntz invented the Muntz Stereo-Pak 4-track tape cartridge. 4-track was the direct {{predecessor}} of the Stereo 8 cartridge, {{also known as}} the 8-track, later developed by American inventor Bill Lear. The Stereo-Pak cartridge was based on the endless-loop Fidelipac cartridge, which was being used by radio stations, designed by inventor George Eash. Muntz chose stereo recording as a standard feature because of its wide availability. Before Muntz developed the Stereo-Pak, the only in-car units capable of recorded playback were phonograph-based players, such as the Highway Hi-Fi invented by Peter Goldmark. These units played special 16 rpm records or 45 rpm records, however they tended to skip whenever the vehicle hit a bump in the road, and attempts to alleviate this by increasing the pressure on the arm caused discs to wear out prematurely.|$|E
