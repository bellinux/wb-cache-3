40|$|AIMS—To {{evaluate}} {{the claim that}} topical <b>proxymetacaine</b> produces little or no discomfort on instillation by comparing it against topical amethocaine.  METHODS—This randomised, masked, double blind, prospective study involved 53  consecutive patients. Each patient received one drop of amethocaine 0. 5 % in one eye and one drop of <b>proxymetacaine</b> 0. 5 % in the other. The duration of the stinging sensation and degree of discomfort (using descriptive and a linear analogue method) for each topical anaesthetic was assessed.  RESULTS—The mean duration of stinging was 3. 2  seconds for <b>proxymetacaine</b> and 22. 1  seconds for amethocaine the difference being statistical significant (p < 0. 001). The mean descriptive discomfort score was 2. 6  for <b>proxymetacaine</b> and 14. 2  for amethocaine (p= 0. 01). The mean linear analogue score was 5. 8  for <b>proxymetacaine</b> and 35. 6  for amethocaine (p< 0. 001). <b>Proxymetacaine</b> had a successful tonometry rate of 93 % and amethocaine 98 %.  CONCLUSION—This clinical study confirms that <b>proxymetacaine</b> is more comfortable on instillation than amethocaine.

40|$|Anaesthetic eye drops for {{children}} in casualty departments across south east England It is a common practice to use topical anaesthetic drops to provide temporary relief and aid in {{the examination of the}} eyes when strong blepharospasm precludes thorough examination. Ophthalmology departments usually have several types of these—for example, amethocaine, oxybuprocaine (benoxinate), and <b>proxymetacaine.</b> The dura-tion and degree of discomfort caused by amethocaine is significantly higher than <b>proxymetacaine,</b> 1 2 whilst the difference in the discomfort between amethocaine and oxybuprocaine is minimal. 2 When dealing with children, therefore, it is recommended to use <b>proxymetacaine</b> drops. 1 It was my experience that Accident & Emergency (A&E) departments tend to have less choice of these drops. This survey was done to find out the availability of different anaesthetic drops, and the preference for paediatric use given a choice of the above three. Questionnaires were sent to 40 A&E departments across south east England. Thirty nine replied back, of which one department did not see any eye casualties. None of the 38 departments had proxymeta-caine. Twenty units had amethocaine alone and 10 units had oxybuprocaine alone. For paediatric use, these units were happy to use whatever drops were available within the unit. Eight units stocked amethocaine and oxybuprocaine, four of these were happy to use either of them on children and four used only oxybuprocaine. One of the latter pre-ferred <b>proxymetacaine</b> but had to contend with oxybuprocaine due to cost issues. Children are apprehensive about the instillation of any eye drops. Hence, it is desirable to use the least discomforting drops like <b>proxymetacaine.</b> For eye casualties, in majority of District General Hospitals, A&E departments are the first port of call. Hence, A&E units {{need to be aware of}} the benefit of <b>proxymetacaine</b> and stock them for paedia-tric use...|$|E
40|$|A novel {{ophthalmic}} {{drug delivery}} system (NODS) has been developed to give precise and controlled delivery of a drug to the eye. The drug is incorporated into a polyvinyl alcohol flag attached to a carrier. When applied to the eye the flag detaches and gradually dissolves, releasing the drug. We investigated corneal anaesthesia produced by different concentrations of <b>proxymetacaine</b> NODS, and conventional eye drops. Subjects consisted of 28 normal males (mean age 25. 3 (SD 3. 9) years). Corneal touch sensitivity was measured with a biomicroscope mounted Cochet-Bonnet aesthesiometer. Each subject attended for two visits separated by 7 days. On each visit each eye randomly received one of four <b>proxymetacaine</b> preparations: 44 micrograms, 74 micrograms, 124 micrograms NODS, or 35 microliters of 0. 5 % <b>proxymetacaine</b> drops (175 micrograms). Corneal touch sensitivity was measured before, and at 1, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 45, and 60 minutes following instillation. Complete anesthesia was achieved {{in the majority of}} subjects within 1 minute of instillation. The lowest NODS dose (44 micrograms) produced longer lasting anaesthesia than the 35 microliters drop (175 micrograms) (p < 0. 05). Higher NODS doses produced a correspondingly greater increase in the duration of anaesthesia. The greater bioavailability achieved by this vehicle allows much lower drug concentrations to be used, reducing the likelihood of systemic adverse reactions...|$|E
40|$|The anesthetics {{effects of}} aqueous extract of Ottonia martiana leaves were studied on the ocular surface of healthy beagle dogs. The dogs were divided in three groups (n= 15) : control group (CG), <b>proxymetacaine</b> group (PG) and Ottonia group (OG), which {{were treated with}} 0. 9 % saline, 0. 5 % <b>proxymetacaine</b> {{hydrochloride}} ophthalmic solution and O. martiana extract respectively. An oftalmic evaluation was performed before the treatments. Eye drops were instilled at time 0 (T 0) and 3 minutes later (T 3). Axial corneal sensitivity was evaluated by esthesiometry 5 and 10 minutes after T 0. Tear production and intraocular pressure were evaluated 10 minutes after T 0. Slit lamp biomicroscopy was performed 10 and 20 minutes after T 0 and the eyes were stained with fluorescein 20 minutes after T 0. The STT was reduced in PG. Conjunctival hyperemia was observed in 13 animals from PG and constituted the only ocular alteration observed during the study. Esthesiometry revealed a decreased corneal sensitivity for PG and OG. Those {{results show that the}} O. martiana extract acts reducing corneal sensitivity in dogs. Moreover, its use does not decrease the tear production and does not cause any clinical ophthalmic alteration...|$|E
40|$|We have {{investigated}} the relationship between corneal sensitivity and blinking patterns. Using a group of 9 young normal subjects, measurements were made of blink patterns, central and peripheral corneal sensitivity and lid margin sensitivity {{both before and after}} use of topical corneal anaesthetic, <b>proxymetacaine</b> hydrochloride (Alcaine). Blink patterns were recorded through concealed filming and were later analysed in terms of blink frequency and the type of blinks (proportion of complete, incomplete, twitch and forced blinks). Blink rate was significantly lower following anaesthetic administration, but the relative proportion of blink types remained unchanged. We speculate that one of the factors responsible for normal involuntary blinks is the imminent break-up of the tear film which is sensed by the cornea...|$|E
40|$|Uveal cysts are fluid filled {{structures}} arised {{from the}} iris or ciliary body commonly presented in certain breeds such as Golden retriever, Labrador retriever and Boston terrier. This report describes the clinical signs, the laser technique and the postoperative aspect for a Flat Coated Retriever with iris cysts. A 6 year-old, neutered male Flat Coated Retriever {{was referred to}} the Animal Medical Centre {{with a history of}} two pigmented masses in the anterior chamber. Ophthalmic examination of the right eye showed the presence of two highly pigmented iris cysts attached at the pupillary margin to the posterior iris. Nonsteroidal eye drops (ketorol tromethamine) and a course of oral meloxicam were initiated a week before the procedure. Under general anaesthesia the diode laser was used with an indirect ophthalmoscope headset and a 20 diopter lens. Preoperative atropine and <b>proxymetacaine</b> eye drops were applied. Diode laser was used to deflate the cysts. Initial pigment dispersion in the anterior chamber and {{on the surface of the}} lens was noted.

40|$|SUMMARY The {{uncomplicated}} {{removal of}} a tick, Ixodes ricinus, from the lid is described. Methods of removal of ticks, their natural history, and potential complications are discussed. An 11 -month-old girl presented to the Casualty Department of the hospital after being irritable during the previous night; she {{was found to have}} a swelling of the left lower lid the next morning. She lived on a farm with her parents and had been previously healthy, with normal development. Examination revealed erythema of the left lower lid, at the centre of which was a dark raised lesion. The preauricular lymph nodes were not enlarged and the globe itself was normal, with no conjunctival injection. Closer examination of the lesion showed it to be the body of a tick, which was pulsating, and the head parts were buried in the skin of the lid (Fig. 1). The patient was wrapped in a blanket, the eye was anaesthetised with Ophthaine (<b>proxymetacaine</b> Hll with chlorbutol, benzalkonium chloride, and glycerol), and a chalazion clamp was placed over the body of the tick. A drop of isopropyl alcohol was applied to the body of the tick and the clamp slowly tightened. The tick was gradually extruded and n...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} {{analgesic}} effectiveness and aesthetic appearance associated with topical, subconjunctival, and peribulbar anesthesia for intravitreal bevacizumab injection. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty consecutive patients undergoing their first intravitreal bevacizumab injection were randomized to receive {{one of three}} forms of anesthesia: <b>proxymetacaine</b> eye drops, subconjunctival injection of 2 % xylocaine, and peribulbar injection of 2 % xylocaine. Pain associated with the intravitreal injection and with the entire procedure (including anesthesia administration) was recorded using a Visual Analog Scale 15 minutes after intravitreal injection. Anterior segment evaluation was performed 24 hours after injection to measure the number of clock hours of subconjunctival hemorrhage. RESULTS: Median injection-related pain score was significantly lower in the peribulbar group compared with the topical and subconjunctival groups (P <. 05). Median entire procedure pain score was significantly higher In the peribulbar group compared with the topical and subconjunctival groups (P <. 05). The median extent of subconjunctival hemorrhage was significantly lower in the topical group compared with the other groups (P <. 05). CONCLUSION: Among the three anesthetic techniques, peribulbar anesthesia was associated with greater effectiveness in controlling injection-related pain but was least effective in controlling entire procedure pain. There {{was no significant difference}} in pain scores between the topical and subconjunctival groups, and topical anesthesia was associated with less subconjunctival hemorrhage...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: Ocular akinesia, {{the use of}} anticoagulants, {{and patient}} {{collaboration}} {{are some of the}} factors that must be taken into consideration when choosing the appropriate anesthesia for phacoemulsification cataract surgery. The satisfaction of patients with the use of topical anesthesia and conscious sedation for this procedure has not been enough described in Brazil. Conscious sedation allows patient walk and answer a voice command. To assess the satisfaction, pain, and perioperative hemodynamic alterations of patients subjected to phacoemulsification under conscious sedation and topical anesthesia supplemented with intracameral lidocaine. METHODS: Prospective cohort non-controlled study that included patients treated by the same surgical team over a 70 -day period. Sedation was performed with midazolam at a total dose of 3 mg and topical anesthesia with 0. 5 % <b>proxymetacaine</b> chlorhydrate and 2 % lidocaine gel combined with 2 % lidocaine by intracameral route. The intraoperative vital parameters, scores based on the Iowa Satisfaction with Anesthesia Scale (ISAS), and the pain visual analog scale (VAS) were recorded at several time points after surgery. RESULTS: A total of 106 patients were enroled in study (73. 6 % female), the mean age was 65. 9 years. The surgical procedures lasted 11. 2 minutes on average. The hemodynamic parameters did not exhibit significant changes at any of the investigated time points. The average ISAS score was 2. 67 immediately after surgery and 2. 99 eight hours after the surgery; this increase was statistically significant (p< 0. 0001). More than two-thirds (68. 9 %) of the participants (73 patients) did not report any pain in the transoperative period, and 98. 1 % of patients denied the occurrence of pain after surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Patients that received topical anesthesia supplemented by intracameral lidocaine combined with sedation for phacoemulsification cataract surgery reported adequate level of satisfaction with the anesthetic choice. Furthermore, the patients exhibited hemodynamic parameter stability and pain control...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{the use of}} in vivo toluidine blue (TB) dye in the diagnosis of ocular surface squamous neoplasia and to correlate staining intensity with the histopathological diagnosis. Methods: A prospective study was performed at the Federal University of São Paulo, Brazil. Patients with conjunctival epithelial lesions were examined by slit-lamp biomicroscopy, with and without 1 % TB eye drops, {{and the results were}} photodocumented. Before the instillation of the dye, 1 % <b>proxymetacaine</b> HCl eye drops were used. All patients were submitted to surgery and histopathological analysis to confirm the diagnosis. the patients were grouped according to the histopathological aspects of the lesions into 3 groups: group 1 -patients with ocular surface squamous neoplasia; group 2 -patients with premalignant lesions; and group 3 -patients with pterygium. the digital images were analyzed by 2 masked examiners who had no previous access to the histopathological results. the photographs were classified according to the positivity and intensity of the staining. the statistical analysis method chosen depended on the type of data, with the level of significance set as P < 0. 05. Results: Forty-seven patients were included in the study: 10 had benign lesions (pterygium), 10 had premalignant lesions (actinic keratosis), and 27 had malignant lesions (conjunctival intraepithelial neoplasia and conjunctival squamous cell carcinoma). Agreement between observers regarding the analysis of the digital photographs was 100 % for positivity and 82. 9 % for intensity of staining (kappa = 0. 938). Ninety percent of patients with premalignant lesions and all patients with malignant lesions showed positive staining with 1 % TB. One patient had positive staining, but histopathological examination revealed a benign lesion (false positive). Conclusions: the use of 1 % TB eye drops is an efficient method for the clinical diagnosis of ocular surface squamous neoplasia and premalignant lesions. Nevertheless, the intensity of the staining does not correlate with the degree of malignancy of these tumors.

40|$|Studies were {{conducted}} to examine the analgesic and toxic effects of topical morphine on corneal abrasion. For the toxicity study, rabbits were anaesthetized and epithelial cells {{were removed from the}} cornea and limbus. Animals were randomised and treated topically as follows: (1) saline (control); (2) morphine sulphate (MS, 0. 5 %); and (3) <b>proxymetacaine</b> hydrochloride (proparacaine) (PH, 0. 5 %). Two drops of the solution were instilled in the eyes at 4 hour intervals for 6 consecutive days and the progression of corneal wound healing was assessed. Results showed that repeated topical MS had no adverse effects on corneal wound closure. The rates of wound healing were similar in both saline and MS treated groups. Eyes treated with MS showed wound closure in a symmetrical fashion starting on day 2 following abrasion. The progression of epithelial wound healing was completed by day 4 in one eye, by day 5 in three eyes, and by day 7 in five eyes. In contrast, repeated topical PH application delayed corneal wound closure. Eyes treated with PH showed signs of corneal wound closure on the third day, but only two eyes out of six had completed wound closure by the eighth day after corneal abrasion. In a subsequent masked study, the analgesic efficacy of topical MS was assessed in seven patients with unilateral corneal abrasion. In all cases, a baseline response was first established. Subsequently, saline was instilled in both eyes and the patient's corneal response to pain pressure was determined 10 and 20 minutes later. Finally, MS was applied and the analgesic effect on the cornea was assessed. Results showed that saline had no effect compared with the baseline response. In contrast, MS showed an analgesic effect as early as 10 minutes after application in the eye with corneal abrasion. MS showed an analgesic efficacy of 4. 3 -fold and 5. 5 -fold greater than the baseline or saline on the eye with corneal abrasion. However, MS had no analgesic effect on the intact corneal. Collectively, these data indicate that opioids do have a desirable analgesic property with out irritating or causing any adverse effect on ocular structures...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{considers}} the question: What roles do the tear film and corneal nerves {{play in the}} normal blink mechanism. The hypothesis proposed is that tear film thinning, which occurs prior to full break-up, allows increased evaporation of the tear film. The evaporation produces a localised reduction in the tear film temperature, which is then detected by the temperature sensitive nerves in the corneal epithelium. To test this hypothesis, a series of experiments was completed. The first study, which investigated the pattern of diurnal change in corneal sensitivity, revealed that corneal sensitivity increases during the day following post-sleep eyelid opening to reach a plateau approximately five hours after eye opening (Kruskall-Wallis, 0. 05). The second study assessed corneal nerve function under anaesthesia produced by 0. 5 % <b>Proxymetacaine</b> Hydrochloride. Onset of anaesthesia was observed within 2 minutes (Wilcoxon matched pairs test, > 0. 05), with a maximum of anaesthesia reached at 15 minutes post-instillation (Wilcoxon matched pairs test, > 0. 05). Corneal sensitivity {{did not return to}} pre-instillation levels at 60 minutes post-instillation (Wilcoxon matched pairs test, 0. 05). The third study assessed the effect of iris colour and ethnic origin on corneal sensitivity, skin sensitivity, tear film stability and blink rate. The study showed that corneal sensitivity for a cooling stimulus was affected by iris colour and ethnic origin (Kruskall-Wallis, > 0. 05) : as iris pigmentation increases, corneal sensitivity decreases. Although statistically tear film stability was found to be influenced by iris colour, no clear pattern of change was associated with iris colour (Kruskall-Wallis, p> 0. 05). Tear film stability was not affected by ethnic origin (Kruskall-Wallis, p> 0. 05). Blink rate was significantly correlated to tear film stability (Spearman, r = - 0. 536, > 0. 05). The fourth study considered the relationship between blink rate, corneal sensitivity, tear film stability, anaesthesia, ocular surface temperature and ocular surface evaporation. Tear film stability was strongly correlated to blink rate, with the blink rate increasing as tear film stability decreases (Spearman, r = 0. 926, > 0. 05). Corneal sensitivity was significantly correlated to corneal sensitivity, but only at low corneal sensitivity levels. Blocking corneal sensitivity by anaesthesia, the blink rate was significantly reduced, suggesting that corneal sensitivity is involved in the mechanism controlling normal involuntary blinking (Wilcoxon matched pairs test, > 0. 05). Tear film evaporation from the ocular surface was not correlated to the blink frequency (Spearman, r = - 0. 381, p> 0. 05). The amount of temperature cooling at the inter-blink interval was not correlated to blink rate (Spearman, r = 0. 241, p> 0. 05). The final experimental study examined involuntary blinking with contact lens wear discomfort. There was {{a significant increase in the}} blink rate with increasing discomfort (Kruskall-Wallis, p 0. 05) and without (Mann Whitney test, > 0. 05) contact lens wear, and had an elevated blink-rate compared to subjects experiencing comfort (Mann Whitney test, > 0. 05). Ocular surface discomfort was not related to an elevated corneal sensitivity (Mann-Whitney test, p> 0. 05). These series of studies showed that tear film stability and corneal sensitivity are involved in the blink mechanism, providing strong evidence that normal involuntary blinking is affected by sensory stimuli arising from the exposed ocular surface...|$|E
