50|$|The <b>Pale</b> <b>Western</b> <b>Cutworm</b> (Agrotis orthogonia) is a moth of the Noctuidae family.

40|$|This NebGuide {{describes}} {{the life cycle}} of the army cutworm and <b>pale</b> <b>western</b> <b>cutworm,</b> and provides recommendations for management. The army cutworm, Euxoa auxiliaris, and the <b>pale</b> <b>western</b> <b>cutworm,</b> Agrotis orthogonia, are sporadic pests that are distributed throughout the Great Plains. The army cutworm can be found throughout Nebraska, but is more common in the western half of the state. Because of the drier environment, the <b>pale</b> <b>western</b> <b>cutworm</b> is found only in the western third of Nebraska. Both cutworms can feed on a vast array of crops and weeds. Their major economic impact is limited to winter wheat and alfalfa, because these are the vulnerable crops growing in the early spring when larval feeding activity occurs. However, they can also cause substantial damage to early spring row crops (sugarbeets and corn), especially in areas where winter cereal cover crops are used...|$|E

40|$|<b>Western</b> bean <b>cutworm,</b> Striacosta albicosta (Smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), is {{a native}} pest of dry beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) and corn (Zea mays L.). Historically, the <b>western</b> bean <b>cutworm</b> was {{distributed}} in the western United States, but since 1999 eastward expansion has been observed. In corn, economic impact is caused by larval ear feeding. Information on <b>western</b> bean <b>cutworm</b> biology, ecology, and economic impact is relatively limited, {{and the development of}} economic injury levels (EILs) and economic thresholds (ETs) is required for more effective management. Studies during 2008 Ð 2011, across three ecoregions of Nebraska, sought to characterize <b>western</b> bean <b>cutworm</b> survival and development of EILs and ETs. Calculations of EILs and ETs incorporated the dynamics of corn price, management cost, and pest survival. The results from the current study demonstrated low larval survival of this species (1. 51 Ð 12. 82 %). The mean yield loss from one <b>western</b> bean <b>cutworm</b> larva per plant was 945. 52 kg/ha (15. 08 bu/acre), based on 74, 100 plants per ha. Economic thresholds are expressed as a percentage of plants with at least one egg mass. This study is the first study that explicitly incorporates variable management costs and crop values into <b>western</b> bean <b>cutworm</b> EIL calculations, and larval survival into ET calculations...|$|R

40|$|The <b>western</b> bean <b>cutworm,</b> Striacosta albicosta (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), is {{native to}} North America. It was first {{reported}} as a pest of Colorado pinto beans in 1915. In 1935 adults were captured in western Nebraska (Hagen, 1963) and later, in 1954, it {{was identified as a}} pest of corn in southern Idaho (Blickenstaff, 1979). Since its discovery in the late 1880 s, it has slowly and steadily expanded its known distribution eastward from Arizona to Iowa (Rice, 2000) and Minnesota (O’Rourke and Hutchison, 2000). The <b>western</b> bean <b>cutworm</b> was known to occasionally occur in western Iowa prior to 1970, {{but it was not until}} 2000 that an economically damaging population was found in field corn. Since then, it has become an annual economic pest in western and central regions of the state.

40|$|Since {{the year}} 2000 {{it has been}} {{observed}} in the United States that genetically engineer-ed corn (maize) plants expressing the Bt toxin classified as Cry 1 Ab are being infested by the larvae of the <b>western</b> bean <b>cutworm</b> (Striacosta albicosta). Originally this pest only occurred within narrowly confined regions and caused no major problems in corn. For several years now, however, this pest has been spreading into more and more regions within the North American Corn Belt and causing substantial economic dam-age. There are empirical findings that the new pest has been caused by large scale culti-vation of genetically engineered plants expressing Cry 1 Ab. This {{is considered to be a}} specific case of 'pest replacement'. In this case the corn earwom (Helicoverpa zea), a naturally occurring competitor of the <b>western</b> bean <b>cutworm</b> has been accidentally eli-minated by the extensive cultivation of Bt corn. Under these circumstances the new pest is able to spread on a large scale and to infest crops heavily. This contribution reviews facts and findings and discusses possible strategies to counteract this new pest and serves as an overview on recent pest management problems in Bt crops.

40|$|<b>Western</b> bean <b>cutworm,</b> Striacosta albicosta (Smith), has {{undergone}} a recent eastward expansion from the western U. S. Corn Belt to Pennsylvania and parts of Canada. Little is known about its ecology and behavior, particularly during the early instars, on corn (Zea mays L.). There is a narrow treatment window for larvae, and early detection of the pest {{in the field is}} essential. An understanding of <b>western</b> bean <b>cutworm</b> larval feeding and early-instar dispersal is essential to understand larval survival and establishment in corn. Studies were conducted in 2009 through 2011 in Nebraska to determine the feeding and dispersal of early-instar <b>western</b> bean <b>cutworm</b> on corn. The treatment design was a factorial with three corn stages (pretassel, tassel, and posttassel) and five corn plant zones (tassel, above ear, primary ear, secondary ear, and below ear) in a randomized complete block design. The effects of different corn tissues on larval survival and development were investigated in laboratory studies in a randomized complete block design during 2009 and 2011. Treatments were different corn tissues (leaf alone, leaf with developing tassel, pollen, pollen plus silk, and silk alone). Results demonstrated that neonate larvae move to {{the upper part of the}} plant, independent of corn stage. Larval growth was optimal when fed on tassel tissue.

40|$|<b>Western</b> bean <b>cutworm,</b> Striacosta albicosta (Smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), is {{a native}} pest of dry beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) and corn (Zea mays L.), and {{historically}} distributed in the western United States. The insect 2 ̆ 7 s recent expansion eastward is documented since 1999. The species is univoltine, the adults typically emerge {{in the middle of}} July, lay eggs on corn leaves, and the larvae feed on different corn tissues. In the fourth instar, larvae start colonization of the ear where they feed on kernels. There is a narrow window for management and early detection of the pest in the field is essential. Larval feeding and dispersal of early larval instar studies of <b>western</b> bean <b>cutworm</b> are necessary to improve the understanding about how feeding requirements affect larval survival and establishment on the corn plant. A refinement of economic injury levels (EIL) and economic thresholds (ET) are also required for management decision-making. Studies during 2008 – 2011, across three ecoregions of Nebraska, had the following objectives: (1) developing a binomial sequential sampling plans for egg masses, (2) determine the feeding behavior and dispersal of the early instars on corn, and (3) development of EILs and the ETs that incorporate the dynamics of corn price, management cost, and pest survival. The results from the present study demonstrated that the binomial sequential sampling plans developed significantly reduce the effort required for effective management of this pest, reducing sampling effort from 100 plants sampled to an average of 38 to 41 plants sampled per field. The results indicate low larval survival of this species and that the early instars of <b>western</b> bean <b>cutworm</b> are the critical stage for establishment in corn. A behavior of initial larval movement toward the tassel was observed. The overall mean yield loss one <b>western</b> bean <b>cutworm</b> larva per plant was 945. 52 kg/ha (15. 08 bu/acre), based on 74, 100 plants/ha.
