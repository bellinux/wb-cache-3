25|$|Other {{types of}} UDDTs exist which are {{essentially}} {{variations of the}} single-vault type, but which are more self-contained, {{sometimes referred to as}} portable, mobile or stand-alone units and identifiable by their one-piece molded plastic shells or, in the case of DIY versions, simple <b>plywood</b> <b>box</b> construction. Most users of self-contained UDDTs rely upon a post-treatment process to ensure pathogen reduction. This post-treatment may consist of long-term storage or addition to an existing or purpose-built compost pile or some combination thereof. A post-treatment step is unnecessary in the case of very modest seasonal use.|$|E
2500|$|This DeLorean {{is later}} badly damaged (Marty crashes the DeLorean into a {{billboard}}, and after Marty gets out, the DeLorean falls through the billboard and crashes onto the ground) and then restored by an alternate version of Doc Brown {{who has never}} developed time travel technology, having access to limited notes about the flux capacitor. As such, the chronal circuits of the duplicate DeLorean become even more glitchy, accumulating errors as severe as the interval of time traveled, with increasing damage with every attempt: as such, Citizen Brown, the Alternate Doc, has to install a diagnostic console made of materials available in 1931 (appearing as a <b>plywood</b> <b>box</b> with a lightbulb and several similar bulbs placed on the coils on the outer body).|$|E
50|$|Unable {{to drive}} the giant {{chrome-plated}} flashing trucks they coveted, children instead built <b>plywood</b> <b>boxes</b> around their bikes and attached chrome plating and lights. Almost all current Dekocharis have elaborate light displays and many include hi-fi audio systems and cup-holders.|$|R
5000|$|The Red River Lumber Company's {{electric}} mill at Westwood made wooden Venetian blinds, <b>plywood,</b> <b>boxes,</b> {{doors and}} windows which were shipped all over the U.S. and the world. [...] The Westwood mill set a world record in 1942 by sawing 212 million board feet.|$|R
40|$|Iced seer fish (Scomberomorus sp.) was {{transported by}} rail in {{expanded}} polystyrene insulated <b>plywood</b> <b>boxes</b> from Kakinada to Calcutta in round and fillet forms. While both withstood {{the rigors of}} transportation squarely, the fillets fetched only half the price of round fish in the auction conducted at the Calcutta market...|$|R
2500|$|The wings almost {{identical}} {{to those of the}} Streak. [...] They were built up around a pair of spruce and <b>plywood</b> <b>box</b> section spars, carrying three-ply and spruce ribs and skinned with stressed three-ply sheet. [...] They were gently tapering in plan with rounded tips. There was 5Â° dihedral outboard, but none on the centre section. Mass balanced ailerons, narrower than those of the Streak filled {{more than half of the}} trailing edge. [...] The mass balances were conspicuously mounted on extended upward arms from near the aileron root. The tailplane and split elevators were also of spruce and plywood, but fabric covered. [...] The rounded fin and rudder, though fabric covered had a steel tube structure. [...] The elevators and rudder were mass balanced, with external weights like those on the ailerons. [...] The rudder extended to the bottom of the fuselage, operating in a cut-out between the elevators.|$|E
2500|$|When {{the band}} settled into Morgan Studios, Lane and Anderson {{proceeded}} {{to decorate the}} studio like a farmyard. Squire believed Lane did so as a joke on Anderson as he wished to record in the country. Anderson brought in flowers, pots of greenery, and cut out cows and sheep to make the studio resemble a garden as a typical studio did not [...] "push the envelope about what you're trying to create musically". Wakeman recalled the addition of white picket fences and his keyboards and amplifiers placed on stacks of hay. At the time of recording, heavy metal group Black Sabbath were recording Sabbath Bloody Sabbath (1973) in the adjacent studio. Singer Ozzy Osbourne recalled the Yes studio also had a model cow with electronic udders fitted and a small barn to give the room an [...] "earthy" [...] feel. [...] "About halfway through the album", said Offord, [...] "The cows were covered in graffiti and all the plants had died. That just kind of sums up that whole album". At one point during the recording stage, Anderson wished for a [...] "bathroom sound" [...] effect on his vocals and asked the band's lighting engineer, Michael Tait, to build him a <b>plywood</b> <b>box</b> with tiles stuck onto it. After Tait explained to Anderson that the idea would not work, Tait [...] "built it anyway". Sound engineer Nigel Luby recalled that tiles would fall off the box during recording takes.|$|E

40|$|The torsion of box {{beams of}} {{rectangular}} section, {{the edges of}} which are strengthened by flanges, and of which one side is lacking, is analyzed by the energy method. The torsional stresses are generally {{taken up by the}} bending of the two parallel walls, the rigidity of which is augmented by the third wall. The result was checked experimentally on duralumin and <b>plywood</b> <b>boxes.</b> The torsion recorded was 10 to 30 percent less than that given by the calculation, owing to self-stiffening...|$|R

40|$|A {{comparative}} study of the insulation efficiencies of expanded polystyrene slabs and multi-layer gunny fabric in long distance transportation of fresh iced fish was made. Used <b>plywood</b> <b>boxes</b> (second hand tea chests) were employed as containers and the experiments conducted between Kakinada and Calcutta. All the three insulants tried, namely, 25. 4 mm thick expanded polystyrene slab, four and two layer gunny (jute) fabric, all sealed in 150 gauge polythene sheets, showed comparable insulation efficiencies, considering total bacterial counts, organoleptic qualities and TMA and TVN values of the transported fish as parameters...|$|R
50|$|Designed by Gaz Transport, {{the tanks}} {{consists}} of a primary and secondary thin membrane made of the material Invar which has almost no thermal contraction. The insulation {{is made out of}} <b>plywood</b> <b>boxes</b> filled with perlite and continuously flushed with nitrogen gas. The integrity of both membranes is permanently monitored by detection of hydrocarbon in the nitrogen. An evolution is proposed by NG2, with the replacement of nitrogen by argon as the flushed inert and insulation gas. Argon has a better insulation power than nitrogen, which could save 10% of boil-off gas.|$|R
5000|$|The {{concrete}} counterweights {{continued to}} hang over the road, and {{as time went}} on, they began to decay and drop chunks of concrete on the road below. [...] Initially, they were encased in <b>plywood</b> <b>boxes,</b> but eventually, it was deemed necessary to remove them. In 1983, the bridge was closed to traffic and a contractor {{was brought in to}} lower, then break up the counterweights. The closure caused significant traffic issues, and after a period of time, the City of Welland decided to temporarily change the adjacent Division Street Bridge to two way traffic ...|$|R

30|$|The main {{utility of}} M. azedarach is its {{high-quality}} timber. Seasoning is relatively simple in that planks which dry without cracking or warping and {{are resistant to}} fungal infection. The wood is used to manufacture agricultural implements, furniture, <b>plywood,</b> <b>boxes,</b> poles, and tool handles [1]. It is also used in cabinet making {{as well as in}} construction [4]. Besides, M. azedarach is a multi-purpose tree species. Its leaves can be used as green manure and insecticides. It is often planted for fuel supply in Middle East and in Assam (India), where it is grown on tea estates for fuel [1]. In Vietnam, most of the M. azedarach were planted in short rotation around 5 â 6 Â years with the purpose to supply raw material for pulp and particleboard industries.|$|R
5000|$|Designed to {{show off}} the {{multiple}} physical effects that can be bolstered with the AGEIA card, CellFactor: Combat Training features some of the objects seen in FPS games: barrels and boxes. There are large amounts of both on the demo's only level, the difference being that these are not exploding barrels and flimsy <b>plywood</b> <b>boxes</b> as normally featured in most FPS games. Barrels and boxes are solid, heavy, and deadly. Thanks to a character's psychic powers, the player can lift and toss any of these small items and watch as they interact with one another - bumping and slamming into one another and spreading across the ground. If enough power is built up, the player can force-push through a pile of debris and use that to take out enemies, called a [...] "PhysX Kill" [...] by the game.|$|R

50|$|By 1964, Yagan's {{head was}} badly decomposed, and the {{decision}} was made to dispose of it. The head was placed in a <b>plywood</b> <b>box,</b> along with a Peruvian mummy and a MÄori head, and buried in Everton Cemetery's General Section 16, grave number 296. In later years, a number of burials were made around the grave, and in 1968 a local hospital buried 20 stillborn babies and two babies who had lived less than twenty-four hours, directly over the museum box.|$|E
50|$|Portable urine-diversion {{dehydration}} toilets are self-contained dry toilets, {{sometimes referred}} to as mobile or stand-alone units. They are identifiable by their one-piece molded plastic shells or, in the case of DIY versions, simple <b>plywood</b> <b>box</b> construction. Most users of self-contained UDDTs rely upon a post-treatment process to ensure pathogen reduction. This post-treatment may consist of long-term storage or addition to an existing or purpose-built compost pile or some combination thereof.

50|$|Its {{one piece}} {{cantilever}} wing had spruce <b>plywood</b> <b>box</b> spars and ribs and was okoumÃ© plywood covered. It {{was attached to}} the upper fuselage longerons at six points and had a 4 m centre section of constant chord and thickness. Beyond, the wing thinned from its underside, creating positive dihedral and became semi-elliptical in plan. Long (2.8 m, more than 60% of the half-span) ailerons, unusually mounted inboard and gently decreasing in chord outboard, produced an overall wing plan close to the ideal ellipse.|$|E
50|$|This type of {{structure}} {{is still in}} use in many lightweight aircraft using welded steel tube trusses.A box truss fuselage structure can also be built out of woodâoften covered with <b>plywood.</b> Simple <b>box</b> structures may be rounded {{by the addition of}} supported lightweight stringers, allowing the fabric covering to form a more aerodynamic shape, or one more pleasing to the eye.|$|R
40|$|Polythene lined thermocole {{insulated}} <b>plywood</b> <b>boxes</b> (second-hand tea chests) {{could be}} successfully used for transport of fresh iced fish. It {{was found that}} a minimum of 25 mm thermocole insulation was necessary during summer (April to June) and 15 mm during winter (Nov. to March). By using these insulated boxes the initial fish to ice ratio could be brought down to 1 : 0. 75 and still further to 1 : 0. 5 {{at the height of}} winter in Jan. and Feb. These second-hand tea chests are robust and are able to stand a minimum of 5 trips to and fro. The moulded polystyrene boxes are not suited for long distance transport. Another redeeming feature in the entire operation was that there was practically no loss of fish due to spoilage in transit. 100 % of the fish transported was in acceptable condition and could be marketed. In the non-insulated boxes used by the trade, the loss due to spoilage ranged from 10 % to 25 %, and this could be completely eliminated by the use of these insulated boxes...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} reduce costs and achieve {{schedules}} for Closure of the Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site (RFETS), the Waste Requirements Group has implemented a number of cost saving initiatives aimed at integrating waste volume reduction with the selection of compliant waste packaging methods for the disposal of RFETS low level radioactive waste (LLW). Waste Guidance Inventory and Shipping Forecasts indicate that over 200, 000 m 3 of low level waste will be shipped offsite between FY 2002 and FY 2006. Current projections indicate {{that the majority of}} this waste will be shipped offsite in an estimated 40, 000 55 -gallon drums, 10, 000 metal and <b>plywood</b> <b>boxes,</b> and 5000 cargo containers. Currently, the projected cost for packaging, shipment, and disposal adds up to $ 80 million. With these waste volume and cost projections, the need for more efficient and cost effective packaging and transportation options were apparent in {{order to reduce}} costs and achieve future Site packaging a nd transportation needs. This paper presents some of the cost saving initiatives being implemented for waste packaging at the Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site (the Site). There are many options for either volume reduction or alternative packaging. Each building and/or project may indicate different preferences and/or combinations of options...|$|R
50|$|The {{fuselage}} of the Polyt V is a <b>plywood</b> covered <b>box</b> structure, {{the pilot}} sitting over the wing {{under a single}} piece, rearward-sliding canopy. An electrically driven winch at the rear retrieves the launch cable, which exits the aircraft at the narrow extreme stern of the fuselage, {{at a rate of}} about 1 m/s. The engine installation is unusual in having a 16 blade adjustable intake cooling fan in the cowling immediately behind the propeller, for low speed high power flight.
