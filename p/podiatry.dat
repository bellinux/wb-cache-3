There is also active research in the field of Ecology and marine microbiology by several of the professors. The Chemistry and Physics department is one of the smaller departments at St. Francis College and most of its graduates go into the Chemical or Pharmaceutical Industries. The focus of the department is mostly in inorganic and physical chemistry. A famous graduate of the department was Donald J. Metz, a long-time nuclear engineer for Brookhaven National Laboratory.

Following {{the opening of the}} new Forth Valley Royal Hospital, the Falkirk and District Royal Infirmary was renamed Falkirk Community Hospital with many of the main services, including the accident and emergency unit being transferred. [...] Falkirk Community Hospital will still provide many services like <b>podiatry</b> and palliative care. [...] The Community Hospital continues to have a Minor Injury Unit, to treat emergency cases of a non life-threatening nature.

2500|$|St. Francis College confers Associate's Degrees, Bachelor's Degrees and Master's Degree. In {{addition}} to these degrees, the College grants certifications for teaching, project management and nursing.

For students that excel academically and participate in extracurricular activities that demonstrate the [...] "Franciscan spirit", St. Francis College established the Duns Scotus Honor Society. It was founded in 1935 by Reverend Dr. James A. Sullivan and is named for John Duns Scotus, a Franciscan scholar.|$|E
2500|$|Gravesend Hospital {{was opened}} in 1854, {{following}} the donation of a site by the 6th Earl of Darnley in 1853; {{it had its}} origin on 2 December 1850, as a dispensary on the Milton Road [...] "to assist the really destitute poor of Gravesend and Milton and vicinities ... unable to pay for medical aid". By 1893, 4,699 such people had benefited by its presence. [...] In 2004 the original building, {{and parts of the}} newer buildings were demolished {{to make way for a}} new community hospital. Gravesend Community Hospital provides a Minor Injury Unit, Dental services, Speech and Language therapy and Physiotherapy. It also has a Stroke Ward and offers inpatient care.

2500|$|Chiropractors {{emphasize}} the conservative {{management of the}} neuromusculoskeletal system {{without the use of}} medicines or surgery, with special emphasis on the spine. Back and neck pain are the specialties of chiropractic but many chiropractors treat ailments other than musculoskeletal issues. There is a range of opinions among chiropractors: some believed that treatment should be confined to the spine, or back and neck pain; others disagreed. For example, while one 2009 survey of American chiropractors had found that 73% classified themselves as [...] "back pain/musculoskeletal specialists", the label [...] "back and neck pain specialists" [...] was regarded by 47% of them as a least desirable description in a 2005 international survey. Chiropractic combines aspects from mainstream and alternative medicine, and there is no agreement about how to define the profession: although chiropractors have many attributes of primary care providers, chiropractic has more of the attributes of a medical specialty like dentistry or <b>podiatry.</b> It has been proposed that chiropractors specialize in nonsurgical spine care, instead of attempting to also treat other problems, but the more expansive view of chiropractic is still widespread.|$|E
2500|$|Canada lies {{somewhere between}} British and American {{usage of the}} degree and {{terminology}} of [...] "doctor". Research doctorates – PhDs and ScDs – are entitled to use the title [...] "doctor". Healthcare professions for which members may be called by the title of doctor are: medicine, dentistry, clinical psychology, optometry, chiropractic, veterinary medicine, <b>podiatry</b> and, more recently, pharmacy. In Alberta, Registered Nurses or Nurse Practitioners with an earned doctoral degree may use the title [...] "doctor" [...] in conjunction with professional practice. Members of these professions generally complete a minimum of 2 years of undergraduate studies, followed by a four- to six-year professional program (considered, despite {{the name of the}} degree, to be at bachelor's-level) to earn the Doctor of Medicine (M.D.), Doctor of Dental Surgery (D.D.S.), Doctor of Psychology (Psy.D.), Doctor of Optometry (O.D.), Doctor of Chiropractic (D.C.) or Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (D.V.M.). In some provinces it is also possible to earn the Doctor of Podiatric Medicine (D.P.M) or Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm.D.). In some provinces, such as Ontario, psychologists take a PhD in Psychology rather than the PsyD degree. In Ontario, only chiropractors, dentists, medical doctors, optometrists and psychologists can use the title [...] "doctor", when offering or purporting to offer health related services, while registered naturopathic doctors (N.D.) may only use the title [...] "doctor" [...] in written format if they also use the phrase, [...] "naturopathic doctor" [...] immediately following their name. A 2006 amendment that would allow practitioners of Traditional Chinese Medicine to use the title has not, as of 1 August 2016, entered into force.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{currently}} nine universities in Australia (plus one in New Zealand) offering {{varying degrees of}} podiatric medicine from a Bachelor of Podiatry/Podiatric Medicine (BPod), a Masters of Podiatric Medicine (MPod) and the Doctor of Podiatric Medicine (DPM) (DPM is a master-level degree). All <b>podiatry</b> schools are accredited by the Australian and New Zealand <b>Podiatry</b> Accreditation Council (ANZPAC). ANZPAC is an independent body comprising members consisting of the <b>Podiatry</b> Registration Boards in Australia and New Zealand. The Board of Management comprises registered podiatrists (nominated by the Registration Boards), nominees from the professional associations (Australasian <b>Podiatry</b> Council and <b>Podiatry</b> New Zealand), nominees from the educational institutions offering <b>podiatry</b> programs and community representation. ANZPAC has been assigned the accreditation functions for the <b>Podiatry</b> Board of Australia under the National Registration and Accreditation Scheme for Health Professions.

50|$|In Australia, <b>podiatry</b> is {{considered}} as an allied health profession, and is practised by individuals {{licensed by the}} <b>Podiatry</b> Board of Australia. The current issue is however though with the <b>Podiatry</b> associations in Australia believing {{that it is a}} profession distinct from allied health because it shares little in common with the allied health group, the evidence points to {{the fact that in the}} Health Insurance Act 1973, <b>podiatry</b> is one of three including dentistry and medicine as the providers of 'professional attention' as well as the only three professions that are able to administer injections and operate surgically on patients. <b>Podiatry</b> scope of practice also far outweighs all other allied health professions.|$|E
