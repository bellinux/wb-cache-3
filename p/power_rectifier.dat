40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{analysis and}} design of high efficiency microwave <b>power</b> amplifiers and <b>rectifiers.</b> The focus of this body of work is to optimize narrow band power amplifiers for maximization of Power-Added-Efficiency (PAE) and rectifiers for maximization of RF-DC power conversion efficiency. A power amplifier performs DC-RF conversion while a rectifier performs RF-DC conversion, therefore a strong analogy exists between the two. Design with non-linear devices suffers from lack of accurate models characterizing large signal behavior, therefore measurement based techniques are often adopted {{in order to create}} high performance designs. The theoretical analysis presented in this thesis provides the microwave circuit designer intuition concerning performance expectations of design options rather than a recipe for creating a successful design. The complexity of non-linear device physics results in behavior which is often limited to qualitative description, complicating accurate model development. The presented theoretical analysis is applied to load-pull based design of S-Band and X-Band power amplifiers and S-Band <b>power</b> <b>rectifiers.</b> The measured circuits exhibit high efficiency consistent with the analysis. An implementation of a high efficiency pulsed S-band AM radar transmitter is presented along with measured results. An extension of the presented analysis is investigated {{in the form of a}} harmonic injection amplifier, which conceptually allows realization of a high power, high efficiency broadband amplifier. In summary, this thesis details 1) the load-pull measurement based design technique applied to microwave <b>power</b> amplifiers and <b>rectifiers,</b> 2) a theoretical analysis technique characterizing the performance limitations of harmonically terminated power amplifiers which may be applied to <b>power</b> <b>rectifiers</b> as well, 3) the design and measurement of several successful high efficiency <b>power</b> amplifiers and <b>rectifiers</b> and 4) interesting implementations of the presented theory in a system context...|$|R
40|$|Diode and {{thyristor}} <b>power</b> <b>rectifiers,</b> {{often used}} as grid connected power electronic supplies, usually behave as non linear loads, disturbing ac line currents and injecting low order harmonics. To minimise harmonic pollution and voltage distortion, recent international standards recommend or impose the allowed number injection and respective amplitude. Modern power semiconductors, driven by pulse with modulated signals, allow the synthesis of <b>power</b> <b>rectifiers,</b> with almost sinusoidal input currents and near unity power factor. Among the boost, buck and buck-boost unity <b>power</b> factor <b>rectifier</b> topologies, the boost rectifier presents higher efficiency, easy implementation and control. However, the boost topology can not limit both the turn-on inrush current and the short circuit current. This thesis proposes two new buck-boost rectifier topologies (single phase and three phase), which are able to limit both currents and present optimised efficiencies, when compared with existing topologies, by reducing on state and switching losses. Control methods for both topologies are also original, allowing near unity factors (0. 99) and Dc output voltage robustness to load and line disturbances. Theoretical results are compared with simulation ones obtained using detailed non linear dynamic models.
