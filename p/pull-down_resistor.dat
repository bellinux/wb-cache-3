5|$|A USB device pulls one of {{the data}} lines high with a 1.5kΩ resistor. This overpowers {{one of the}} <b>pull-down</b> <b>resistors</b> in the host and leaves the data lines in an idle state called J.|$|R
5|$|The host {{includes}} 15kΩ <b>pull-down</b> <b>resistors</b> on each data line. When no {{device is}} connected, this pulls both data lines low into the so-called single-ended zero state (SE0 in the USB documentation), and indicates a reset or disconnected connection.|$|R
5000|$|PxREN : Port x {{resistor}} enable ('2xx & '5xx only). Bits set in this register enable weak pull-up or <b>pull-down</b> <b>resistors</b> on {{the corresponding}} I/O pins {{even when they}} are configured as inputs. The direction of the pull is set by the bit written to the PxOUT register.|$|R
5000|$|Pull-down {{resistors}} can {{be safely}} used with CMOS logic gates because the inputs are voltage-controlled. TTL logic inputs that are left un-connected inherently float high, and require a much lower valued <b>pull-down</b> <b>resistor</b> to force the input low. A standard TTL input at logic [...] "1" [...] is normally operated assuming a source current of 40 µA, and a voltage level above 2.4 V, allowing a pull-up resistor {{of no more than}} 50 Kohms; whereas the ttl input at logic [...] "0" [...] will be expected to sink 1.6 mA at a voltage below 0.8 V, requiring a <b>pull-down</b> <b>resistor</b> less than 500 ohms. Holding unused TTL inputs low consumes more current. For that reason, pull-up resistors are preferred in TTL circuits.|$|E
50|$|The {{high-impedance}} {{state of}} a given node in a circuit cannot be verified by a voltage measurement alone. A pull-up resistor (or <b>pull-down</b> <b>resistor)</b> {{can be used as}} a medium-impedance source to try to pull the wire to a high (or low) voltage level. If the node is not in a high-impedance state, extra current from the resistor will not significantly affect its voltage level.|$|E
50|$|If data packets contain four or 16 words, {{some of the}} {{overhead}} is eliminated. So on a single channel, data bursts of four words per packet can deliver an effective throughput of 133 Mbit/s. With 16 words per packet, the throughput goes up to 178 Mbit/s. With the maximum eight channels, an effective throughput of over 1400 Mbit/s can be achieved with 16 words per packet. Both the direction and clock source may be software configurable be device dependent. Software may {{also be used to}} set the internal clock speed be device dependent. Unused clock lines are held high via an internal pull-up. Unused RX or TX lines may require an external 47k <b>pull-down</b> <b>resistor</b> be device dependent. Software selectable internal pull-downs for signals may be provided on some devices.|$|E
50|$|UMC UM3567 is a 100% {{software}} compatible chip, {{with the}} same pinout as the U3567 but a slightly enhanced DAC output. It requires the same pin-to-pin adapter, but the different DAC output will also require the two <b>pull-down</b> <b>resistors</b> of the audio output pins {{to be removed from}} the motherboard.|$|R
50|$|MSP430 {{devices have}} up to 12 digital I/O ports implemented. Each port has eight I/O pins. Every I/O pin can be {{configured}} as either input or output, and can be individually read or written to. Ports P1 and P2 have interrupt capability. MSP430F2xx, F5xx and some F4xx devices feature built-in, individually configurable pull-up or <b>pull-down</b> <b>resistors.</b>|$|R
5000|$|When outputs are tri-stated (in the Hi-Z state) their {{influence}} {{on the rest of}} the circuit is removed, and the circuit node will be [...] "floating" [...] if no other circuit element determines its state. Circuit designers will often use pull-up or <b>pull-down</b> <b>resistors</b> (usually within the range of 1-100 kΩ) to influence the circuit when the output is tri-stated.|$|R
5000|$|Pull-up {{resistors}} {{may be used}} at logic outputs {{where the}} logic device cannot source current such as open-collector TTL logic devices. Such outputs are used for driving external devices, for a wired-OR function in combinational logic, or for a simple way of driving a logic bus with multiple devices connected to it. For example, the circuit shown on the right uses 0V logic level inputs to actuate a relay. If the input is left unconnected, <b>pull-down</b> <b>resistor</b> R1 ensures that the input is pulled down to a logic low. The 7407 TTL device, an open collector buffer, simply outputs whatever it receives as input, but as an open collector device, the output is left effectively unconnected when outputting a [...] "1". Pull-up resistor R2 thus pulls the output {{all the way up}} to 12 V when the buffer outputs a [...] "1", providing enough voltage to turn the power MOSFET all the way on and actuate the relay.|$|E
5000|$|With {{two or more}} base {{resistors}} (R3 and R4) {{instead of}} one, the inverter becomes a two-input RTL NOR gate (see the figure on the right). The logical operation OR is performed by applying consecutively the two arithmetic operations addition and comparison (the input resistor network acts as a parallel voltage summer with equally weighted inputs and the following common-emitter transistor stage as a voltage comparator with a threshold about 0.7 V). The equivalent resistance of all the resistors connected to logical [...] "1" [...] and the equivalent resistance of all the resistors connected to logical [...] "0" [...] form the two legs of a composed voltage divider driving the transistor. The base resistances {{and the number of}} the inputs are chosen (limited) so that only one logical [...] "1" [...] is sufficient to create base-emitter voltage exceeding the threshold and, as a result, saturating the transistor. If all the input voltages are low (logical [...] "0"), the transistor is cut-off. The <b>pull-down</b> <b>resistor</b> R1 biases the transistor to the appropriate on-off threshold. The output is inverted since the collector-emitter voltage of transistor Q1 is taken as output, and is high when the inputs are low. Thus, the analog resistive network and the analog transistor stage perform the logic function NOR.|$|E

The low 140 mV dropout voltage at 200 mA load improves efficiency and allows operation over a wide input voltage range. Using an innovative circuit topology, the ADP 151 achieves ultralow noise performance without {{the necessity of a}} {{bypass capacitor}}, making it ideal for noise-sensitive analog and RF applications. The ADP 151 also achieves ultralow noise performance without compromising PSRR or transient line and load performance. The low 265 μA of quiescent current at 200 mA load makes the ADP 151 suitable for battery-operated portable equipment. The ADP 151 also includes an internal <b>pull-down</b> <b>resistor</b> on the EN input...|$|E
5000|$|In {{the middle}} of the transition, the {{resistor}} R3 limits the current flowing directly through the series connected transistor V3, diode V5 and transistor V4 that are all conducting. It also limits the output current in the case of output logical [...] "1" [...] and short connection to the ground. The strength of the gate may be increased without proportionally affecting the power consumption by removing the pull-up and <b>pull-down</b> <b>resistors</b> from the output stage.|$|R
50|$|The DIP switch package {{also has}} socket pins or {{mounting}} leads {{to provide an}} electrical path from the switch contacts to the circuit board. Although circuits can use the electrical contacts directly, it is more common to convert them into high and low signals. In this case, the circuit board also needs interface circuitry for the DIP switch, consisting {{of a series of}} pull-up or <b>pull-down</b> <b>resistors,</b> a buffer, decode logic, and other components. Typically, the device's firmware reads the DIP switches when the device is powered on.|$|R
50|$|These chips {{will receive}} 1 or 2 SGPIO streams and drive LEDs accordingly; the latest chip from AMI, the MG9077, can be {{configured}} by pull-up and <b>pull-down</b> <b>resistors</b> to adopt to 16 different configurations of SGPIO buses {{and drive the}} LEDs accordingly. Since the availability of these chips from AMI, major OEMs including NEC, Hitachi, Supermicro, IBM, Sun Microsystems, and others are using them on their backplanes to receive the SGPIO streams {{from a variety of}} HBA vendors and on-board controller chips to consistently drive LEDs with a pre-determined blinking pattern.|$|R

40|$|The 74 ALVCH 16373 is 16 -bit D-type {{transparent}} latch featuring separate D-type inputs for each latch and 3 -state outputs for bus oriented applications. Incorporates bus hold data inputs which {{eliminate the need}} for external pull-up or <b>pull-down</b> <b>resistors</b> to hold unused inputs. One latch enable (LE) input and one output enable (OE) are provided per 8 -bit section. The 74 ALVCH 16373 consists of 2 sections of eight D-type {{transparent latch}}es with 3 -state true outputs. When LE is HIGH, data at the nDn inputs enter the latches. In this condition the latches are transparent, therefore a latch output will change each time its corresponding D-input changes. When LE is LOW, the latches store the information that was present at the nDn inputs at a set-up time preceding the LOW-to-HIGH transition of LE. When OE is LOW, the contents of the eight latches are available at the outputs. When OE is HIGH, the outputs go to the high-impedance OFF-state. Operation of the OE input does not affect the state of the latches. 2.

40|$|The 74 AVCH 16245 is a 16 -bit {{transceiver}} featuring non-inverting 3 -state bus compatible outputs in both {{send and}} receive directions. The device features two output enable inputs (nOE) for easy cascading and two send/receive inputs (nDIR) for direction control. Inputs nOE control the outputs so that the buses are effectively isolated. This device {{can be used as}} two 8 -bit transceivers or one 16 -bit transceiver. The 74 AVCH 16245 is designed to have an extremely fast propagation delay and a minimum amount of power consumption. To ensure the high-impedance output state during power-up or power-down, tie pins nOE to VCC through a pull-up resistor (Live Insertion). A Dynamic Controlled Output (DCO) circuitry is implemented to support termination line drive during transient (see Figure 4 and Figure 5) The 74 AVCH 16245 has active bus-hold circuitry to hold unused or floating data inputs at a valid logic level.

50|$|Multiple devices may share a level-triggered {{interrupt}} line if {{they are}} designed to. The interrupt line must have a <b>pull-down</b> or pull-up <b>resistor</b> so that when not actively driven it settles to its inactive state. Devices actively assert the line to indicate an outstanding interrupt, but let the line float (do not actively drive it) when not signalling an interrupt. The line is then in its asserted state when any (one or more than one) of the sharing devices is signalling an outstanding interrupt.|$|R
40|$|Hardwired {{interlock}} card provides {{signal conversion}} between RS 422 inputs and TTL outputs. The failsafe design {{will be made}} by using additional <b>pull-down</b> and pull-up <b>resistors</b> on the RS 422 inputs. An additional function is the glitch suppression on the inputs to avoid HW interlock malfunction. The input signals should have some minimal duration (~ 0. 1 ms). The output signals are low active, i. e. low level = power channel is active. Two input connectors, one for 12 signals (25 -pin D-SUB male) and second one for one VCSEL interlock signal (9 -pin D-SUB male), are mounted on the crate rear panel.

50|$|Multiple devices may {{share an}} edge-triggered {{interrupt}} line {{if they are}} designed to. The interrupt line must have a <b>pull-down</b> or pull-up <b>resistor</b> so that when not actively driven it settles to one particular state. Devices signal an interrupt by briefly driving the line to its non-default state, and let the line float (do not actively drive it) when not signalling an interrupt. This type of connection is {{also referred to as}} open collector. The line then carries all the pulses generated by all the devices. (This is analogous to the pull cord on some buses and trolleys that any passenger can pull to signal the driver that they are requesting a stop.) However, interrupt pulses from different devices may merge if they occur close in time. To avoid losing interrupts the CPU must trigger on the trailing edge of the pulse (e.g. the rising edge if the line is pulled up and driven low). After detecting an interrupt the CPU must check all the devices for service requirements.|$|R
40|$|Fig. 10. Simulated delay versus load {{capacitance}} at 1 mW/gate for the JFET pull-down ECL circuit and the conventional ECL circuit (FI = FO = 3). Notice that the pull-down current {{of the new}} circuit has a sharper peak. The pull-down current contours of the new and conventional ECL circuits versus output voltage during transitions are shown in Fig. 9 for both the high-power (4 mW/gate) and low-power (0. 5 mW/gate) cases. As expected, the contours for the JFET pull-down circuit show that a higher current modulation is obtained at 0. 5 mW/gate than at 4 mW/gate due to the longer delay in the output stage. The superior load driving capability of the new ECL circuit is illustrated in Fig. 10. As can be seen, at 1 mW/gate, the pull-up capability is essentially identical while {{the slope of the}} pull-down delay for the new circuit is 610 ps/pF, an improvement of 53 % compared with 1290 ps/pF for the <b>resistor</b> <b>pull-down</b> circuit. 4 V. CONCLUSION In conclusion, an active pull-down ECL circuit using a “free ” p-channel JFET in n-p-n bipolar technologies has been described. The JFET pull-down output stage operates as a push-pull follower stage and enhances both the speed and driving capability. For a loaded gate at 1 -mW power consumption, the enhancement is about 24 % and 53 %, respectively. Because the JFET pull-down ECL circuit will neither degrade the circuit density nor complicate the fabrication process, it is suited for low-power high-speed applications. The JFET pull-down technique can also be applied to other logic circuits such as NTL circuits and, more broadly, to any emitter-follower drivers. ACKNOWLEDGMENT The {{authors would like to thank}} M.
