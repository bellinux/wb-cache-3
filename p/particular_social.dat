Despite modern influences, Iban still observe many of their traditional rituals such as Gawai Antu (festival of the dead) and Gawai Dayak (Harvest Festival).|$|E
5|$|Rather than become president, Noriega {{preferred}} to remain behind the scenes, {{and avoid the}} public scrutiny {{that came with the}} post. He did not have a <b>particular</b> <b>social</b> or economic ideology, and used military nationalism to unify his supporters. The Partido Revolucionario Democrático (Democratic Revolutionary Party, PRD), which had been established by Torrijos, was used by Noriega as a political front for the National Guard. Noriega compelled the Panamanian Congress to pass Law 20, which was supposedly aimed at protecting the Panama Canal from communists, and allowed a huge influx of U.S. weapons to the Panamanian military. The law also tripled the size of the military forces, and gave the National Guard control over immigration, customs, commercial transportation, railroads, and airports. Noriega's period in power saw significant capital flight from Panama; according to Kempe, this was at least in part because wealthy individuals worried their wealth would be seized by Noriega's administration.|$|E

25|$|In his {{monograph}} Managerial Ideologies in the Age of Rationality, Shenhav {{argued that}} Max Weber's concept of bureaucracy which gathered {{momentum in the}} 19th century and was elaborated in the 20th century, is not rational in the ontological sense, {{but in fact the}} opposite. Shenhav argued that despite its claim for precision, non-arbitrary and universal, that system's foundations are not necessarily more efficient than others and are certainly not universal, but rather of a <b>particular</b> <b>social,</b> economic and historic context.|$|E
25|$|The African {{beliefs and}} {{practices}} certainly influenced Cuba's music. Polyrhythmic percussion is an inherent part of African music, as melody is part of European music. Also, in African tradition, percussion is always joined to song and dance, and to a <b>particular</b> <b>social</b> setting. The result of the meeting of European and African cultures is that most Cuban popular music is creolized. This creolization of Cuban life has been happening for a long time, and by the 20th century, elements of African belief, music and dance were well integrated into popular and folk forms.|$|E

25|$|Variations of dancehall {{continued}} to be popular into the mid-1990s. Some of the performers of the previous decade converted to Rastafari, and changed their lyrical content. Artists like Buju Banton experienced significant crossover success in foreign markets, while Beenie Man, Bounty Killer and others developed a sizable North American following, due to their frequent guest spots on albums by gangsta rappers like Wu-Tang Clan and Jay-Z. Some ragga musicians, including Beenie Man, Shabba Ranks and Capleton, publicly converted to a new lyrical style, {{in the hope that}} his new style of lyrics would not offend any one <b>particular</b> <b>social</b> group.|$|E
25|$|Claims from {{scientific}} research on {{sex differences in}} intelligence, quite independently of their scientific validity, can have self-fulfilling effects and therefore sustain the very sex differences they seek to explain. Psychologist Barry Schwartz extended the concept of idea technology to convey {{the point that the}} ideas and concepts produced by science and technology, just like the tangible products, can affect our lives. This notion is also described as looping effects or feedback effects in cognition and culture, whereby the causal understanding of a <b>particular</b> <b>social</b> group changes the very character of the group, leading to further change in the phenomenon under investigation.|$|E
25|$|This {{variation}} between 'I' and 'me' (nominative and accusative) in object {{position has}} been linked to the social concerns of politeness and elevated language. This non-standard use of the nominative case in object position carries a certain linguistic prestige. People using this form are often perceived as educated and articulate. This variation shows up frequently in newspapers, magazines and political speeches as well as in daily conversation. Conversely, the use of the standard variant 'my wife and me' may seem to signal casualness or lack of sophistication. This illustrates how case marking is not only a system to be followed, but one that can be used creatively to encode <b>particular</b> <b>social</b> meanings.|$|E

25|$|Doxa {{refers to}} the learned, fundamental, deep-founded, {{unconscious}} beliefs, and values, taken as self-evident universals, that inform an agent's actions and thoughts within a particular field. Doxa tends to favor the <b>particular</b> <b>social</b> arrangement of the field, thus privileging the dominant and taking their position of dominance as self-evident and universally favorable. Therefore, the categories of understanding and perception that constitute a habitus, being congruous with the objective organization of the field, tend to reproduce the very structures of the field. A doxic situation may {{be thought of as}} a situation characterized by a harmony between the objective, external structures and the 'subjective', internal structures of the habitus. In the doxic state, the social world is perceived as natural, taken-for-granted and even commonsensical.|$|E

25|$|In 1986 an Immigration Judge {{agreed not}} to send Fidel Armando-Alfanso back to Cuba, based on his {{membership}} in a <b>particular</b> <b>social</b> group (gay people) who were persecuted and feared further persecution {{by the government of}} Cuba. The Board of Immigration Appeals upheld the decision in 1990, and in 1994, then-Attorney General Janet Reno ordered this decision to be a legal precedent binding on Immigration Judges and the Asylum Office, and established sexual orientation as a grounds for asylum. However, in 2002 the Board of Immigration Appeals “suggested in an ambiguous and internally inconsistent decision that the ‘protected characteristic’ and ‘social visibility’ tests may represent dual requirements in all social group cases.” The requirement for social visibility means that the government of a country from which the person seeking asylum is fleeing must recognize their social group, and that LGBT people who hide their sexual orientation, for example out of fear of persecution, may not be eligible for asylum under this mandate.|$|E
