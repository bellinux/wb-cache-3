5000|$|<b>Polar</b> <b>mounts</b> {{are popular}} with home {{television}} receive-only (TVRO) satellite systems {{where they can}} be used to access the TV signals from many different geostationary satellites. They are also used in other types of installations such as TV, cable, and telecommunication Earth stations although those applications usually use more sophisticated altazimuth or fix angle dedicated <b>mounts.</b> [...] <b>Polar</b> <b>mounts</b> can use a simplified one axis design because geostationary satellite are fixed in the sky relative to the observing dish and their equatorial orbits puts them all in a common line that can be accessed by swinging the satellite dish along a single arc approximately 90 degrees from the <b>mount's</b> <b>polar</b> axis. This also allows them to use a single positioner to move the antenna {{in the form of a}} [...] "jackscrew" [...] or horizon-to-horizon gear drive. <b>Polar</b> <b>mounts</b> work in a similar way to astronomical equatorial mounts in that they point at objects at fixed hour angles that follow the astronomical right ascension axis. Like equatorial <b>mounts,</b> <b>polar</b> <b>mounts</b> require <b>polar</b> alignment. They differ from equatorial mounts in that the objects (satellites) they point at are fixed in position and usually require no tracking, just accurate fixed aiming.|$|R

50|$|Construction of the 150 ft {{telescope}} {{started in}} the spring of 1964. The concrete base weighed 300 tons, the steel dish and the its rotating mount another 900 tons. An equatorial mount in the base, only five feet high, positioned the instrument. The telescope was designed to operate at higher frequencies than existing instruments, requiring much of it to be constructed of flat plates instead of an open mesh in order to accurately focus these signals. The surface was built to be accurate to 1/5 of a centimeter, allowing it to accurately focus wavelengths to around 1.5 cm. Construction was completed in early 1966, and the telescope started operations in May 1966. Work was also completed a <b>polar</b> <b>mounted</b> paraboloid microwave horn and an 11 m equatorial mount dish north of the main antenna complex.|$|R

5000|$|The dishes {{worked by}} {{receiving}} a low-power C-Band (3.7-4.2 GHz) frequency-modulated analog signal {{directly from the}} original distribution satellite - the same signal received by cable television headends. Because analog channels took up an entire transponder on the satellite, and each satellite had a fixed number of transponders, dishes were usually equipped with a modified <b>polar</b> <b>mount</b> and actuator to sweep the dish across the horizon to receive channels from multiple satellites. Switching between horizontal and vertical polarization was accomplished by a small electric servo motor that moved a probe inside the feedhorn throat at the command of the receiver (commonly called a [...] "polarotor" [...] setup). Higher-end receivers did this transparently, switching polarization and moving the dish automatically as the user changed channels.|$|E
5000|$|Declination angle - The {{declination}} angle or just [...] "declination", {{from the}} astronomical term declination for the vertical value (north/south) on the celestial sphere, is a [...] "tipping down" [...] {{of the dish}} on the mount {{to allow it to}} observe geostationary satellites. When observed from any latitude other than the equator the observer is actually looking [...] "down" [...] on the satellite making it look as if it is just below the celestial equator, an angle from the celestial equator that increases with latitude. Polar mounts have mechanisms that allow the dish to be tipped down in a permanently fixed angle to match the declination angle. Mounts may also have a variable declination control to allow them to point at geosynchronous satellites in inclined orbits since those satellites have a constantly changing declination. (Adding such a declination axis to a <b>polar</b> <b>mount</b> results in an equatorial mount).|$|E

40|$|AbstractTracking {{systems for}} {{parabolic}} troughs are already well designed for industrial processes, but the challenges can be different concerning small-scale low cost systems. Considering cost limitations, some flexibility and error margin on tracking accuracy may be tolerated, {{due to the}} imperfections of the parabola or the inaccuracy of the tracking. The objective {{of this study is}} to compute the efficiency losses when changing the sun rays incident angles and conclude about the error margin tolerable for a small-scale parabolic trough. Starting from an ideal case, the evolution of the trough efficiency regarding the tracking angle is observed in the plane perpendicular to the axis of a <b>polar</b> <b>mounted</b> trough.

5000|$|Declination offset - Because {{satellites}} {{toward the}} Eastern and Western sky are {{further away from}} the observing antenna, there {{is a change in}} the declination angle: towards the eastern and western limits the satellites get closer to the celestial equator because they are further out along the lines of perspective. To aim at this apparent shift in the arc of geostationary satellites <b>polar</b> <b>mounts</b> incorporate a slight offset in the angle of their polar axis towards the equator, called a declination offset, to more closely follow this arc. Slewing around a fixed axis which is not parallel with the earth's rotation axis causes the dish to aim at a track in the equatorial plane which is (unless the dish is on the equator) an ellipse rather than a circle. Since the geostationary orbit is circular, the mount does not aim precisely at satellites at all longitudes. These slight differences in tracking have negligible effect on home C band and [...] TVRO dishes since they have relatively wide-beam designs.|$|R

40|$|This PhD thesis {{focuses on}} the {{development}} and testing of a small scale concentrating parabolic dish with heat storage for low to medium temperature applications. The system consists of a parabolic dish solar concentrator that concentrates solar radiation, a fibrous mat solar absorber that captures concentrated solar rays and converts them to thermal energy and a packed bed with pebble rock as a thermal energy storage unit. Air {{is used as a}} heat transfer medium between the absorber and the heat storage unit. This research has targeted several issues {{in which there is a}} lack of knowledge on small scale concentrating solar energy technologies, with the work summarized in eight papers. Paper 1 concerns experimental measurement of the dynamic temperature profiles along a rock bed heat storage unit during thermal charging and degradation. The study examined both finned and non-finned types of rock bed storages. The effects of the long fins, which are incorporated to transport heat from the bottom to the top surface of the heat storage, were investigated in relation to temperature distribution. As an extension of Paper 1, the performance of a rock bed fitted with long fins was studied as a heat storage unit and a cooking device. The bed charging efficiency, as well as the capacity to store thermal energy and extract heat for boiling of water was discussed. Paper 3 describes the implementation of a 1 D numerical model in the MATLAB environment to simulate the transient temperature profiles of rock bed heat storage units. Conservation equations were formulated for the air, rock pebble and fins. The equations were solved on a staggered grid, and the model predicts the experimental results reasonably well. The thesis also investigates two types of volumetric solar absorbers (a fibrous wire mesh and a ceramic) that could be incorporated with a small scale solar concentrating parabolic dish system. Both the fibrous mesh and ceramic type absorbers display a better performance, as discussed in Paper 4. Another contribution of the PhD work is to investigate a 1 D sun tracking system that could be integrated with a small scale concentrating parabolic dish. This includes the design and testing of a <b>polar</b> <b>mounted</b> electronic-based analogue and digital type sun tracking system. A PhotoVoltaic (PV) based direct sun tracking system that actuates the tracking motor based on the shading effect was also developed and tested. As described in Paper 5, the direct type of sun tracking system was found to be a very simple system which provided a sufficient tracking accuracy. Paper 6 describes ray tracing program simulations to study the optical performance of concentrating solar reflections and absorption systems. The program is used to study the effect of the tracking error, the size of the receiver and flux distribution on different absorbers that could possibly be integrated with a parabolic dish,. The program was further extended to study the possibility of transporting concentrated solar rays from the focus of a parabolic dish to an application area via a mirror channel guide (Paper 7). Finally, an overall test was conducted to investigate the performance of prototype for the small scale parabolic dish solar concentrator with rock bed as a heat storage unit, with the results presented in Paper 8. They show that the small scale system can capture and store solar thermal energy. As a heat transfer medium, air requires careful design and construction of the receiver, circulating fan and heat transport pipe. The small scale system yields modest storage temperatures.

Satellite-based observations provide atmospheric composition data with extensive spatial and temporal coverage, but these need to be validated and integrated by ground-based networks like GAW (Global Atmospheric Watch) and NDACC (Network for Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change). This contribution presents a new ground-based spectrometer for the observation of middle atmospheric humidity profiles being currently developed at INGV - Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia. The instrument will detect the water vapour spectral line at 22. 235 GHz by using the balanced beam-switching observation technique. The receiver antenna system has a parabolic mirror and a corrugated horn with an overall HPBW of 3. 5 °. Preliminary tests of the horn performed at the Table Mountain Facility of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California are presented. An uncooled GaAsFET low-noise amplifier was custom-assembled for the receiver front-end. The back-end will be a FFT spectrometer with a 1 GHz bandwidth and a 63 kHz resolution which, given the pressure broadening coefficient of the H 2 O line, will allow to retrieve concentration profiles from about 15 to 80 km altitude. Since the retrieval altitude range is also limited by the spectral signal-to-noise ratio and baseline artifacts, special care is taken in minimizing receiver noise temperature. Low noise temperatures will imply integration times short {{enough to be able}} to observe diurnal changes in the lower stratosphere. In order to extend unmanned operation time and limit LN 2 supplies at remote stations, calibrated noise sources will be used as cold load reference on a daily basis.
