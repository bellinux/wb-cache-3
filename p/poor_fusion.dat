40|$|The {{number of}} gene {{products}} available for structural and functional study is increasing at an unprecedented rate {{as a result}} of the successful whole genome sequencing projects. Systematic structure determination of proteins on a genomic scale, called structural genomics, can significantly contribute to the field of protein science and to functional annotation of newly identified genes. This thesis covers different aspects of protein production in Eschericiha coli for structural studies in the context of structural genomics. Protocols have been downscaled and standardized to allow for a rapid assessment of the production characteristics for multiple proteins in parallel under a number of different conditions. Foremost, the ability of different proteins and peptide tags to affect the solubility of the recombinant protein when produced as fusion proteins has been systematically studied. Large differences in the success-rate for production of soluble protein in E. coli were found depending on the fusion partner used, with a more than two-fold increase in the number of proteins produced as soluble when comparing the best and the <b>poorest</b> <b>fusion</b> tags. For different constructs with a histidine tag, commonly used to facilitate protein purification, large differences in yield depending on the design of the expression vector were found. When comparing different fusion proteins produced from identical expression vectors, fusions to the GB 1 domain were found to result in the highest yield of purified target protein, on average 25 % higher than any of the other fusions. The suitability for further structural studies was tested at an intermediate scale for proteins that were identified as soluble in the expression screening. For this purpose, protocols for rapid purification and biophysical characterization using nuclear magnetic resonance and circular dichroism spectroscopy were developed and tested on 19 proteins, of which four were structured.

30|$|Involuntary patient motion {{between the}} CT and the PET data {{acquisition}} of a PET/CT study can lead to <b>poor</b> data <b>fusion,</b> making correct localisation of focal uptake impossible especially in smaller lesions and in the supraclavicular area (see “Increased FDG thyroid gland uptake”). In addition, respiratory mismatch or vigorous swallowing can also influence the quality of PET/CT images as head and neck cancer patients often present with major dyspnoea, coughing or swallowing problems. In order to optimise PET/CT image fusion, the respiratory levels during the PET and CT data acquisition should be similar. Therefore, in most institutions, patients are asked to breathe in a shallow fashion during the neck acquisition and refrain from vigorous inspiratory or expiratory manoeuvres. In addition to adequate patient instruction, immobilisation during scanning often prevents motion artefacts. Nevertheless, {{it is important to}} point out that mis-coregistration artefacts from patient motion are a lesser problem in head and neck PET/CT studies compared with PET/CT scans of the chest or abdomen.|$|R

Objectives: To assess {{the effectiveness of}} the cage-instrumented posterior lumbar interbody fusion in multilevel lumbar spinal stenosis associated with degenerative scoliosis. Summary of literature Review: Degenerative lumbar scoliosis with the problems of neurogenic claudication, mechanical back pain and spinal deformity present a challenge for treatment. Materials and Methods: We reviewed 18 surgical cases of multilevel lumbar spinal stenosis with degenerative scoliosis from March 1995 to April 2000 with an average follow up period of 2. 9 years. We assessed the radiographic results of scoliotic angle correction and sagittal angle correction of the maximum curve and fused segment and disc height restoration. Clinical results were evaluated according to the Kirkaldy-Willis criteria. Results: Mean scoliotic angle at preoperative, postoperative and final follow-up (maximum curve/fused segment) was 17. 7 - 6. 1 - 7. 3 。/ 15. 0 - 5. 8 - 6. 1 。respectively.

40|$|Friction stir welding (FSW) is a {{solid state}} welding process used widely in the {{manufacturing}} industry, mainly with soft materials with <b>poor</b> <b>fusion</b> weldability such as aluminium. In this investigation the material behaviour of dissimilar friction stir welded 5 XXX and 6 XXX series aluminium alloys was examined. Both alloys are used extensively in the transport industry, however exhibit different properties. 5 XXX series are non-heat treatable, hard alloys with poor cold working ability. In contrast, 6 XXX series are softer, heat treatable alloys with better formability. FSW {{can be used to}} take advantage of these differences in mechanical properties to fuse dissimilar metals. It was found that the overall mixability of the two materials was low, with all of the non-solutionised dissimilar samples failing the bend test. However, with the pre-weld heat treated (solutionised) samples one of the dissimilar welds passed the bend test. This suggests greater mixing between the two materials when the Al- 6060 is in the solutionised and softened state. It was also found that the hardness profile of the solutionised samples was more uniform across the weld compared to the non-solutionised; {{this is due to the}} complete dissolution of precipitates before welding, meaning overaging in the HAZ does not occur. It was also found the pre-weld heat treated samples show the same grain structure as the non-heat treated, which differs from what has been found with post weld heat treatment...|$|E

Although {{this class of}} composite clearly perform better than the matrix alloy itself, the successful application of such particulate-reinforced materials depends {{on the availability of}} proven joining techniques that can produce high quality joints. Due to the high chemical reactivity of titanium that may lead to a chemical interaction with the reinforcing material a <b>poor</b> <b>fusion</b> welding performance is commonly observed in these materials making solid-state diffusion bonding and rotary friction welding potential processes to produce complex structural components. Despite recent advances in processing and manufacturing technology of Ti 6 Al 4 V 10 wt. % TiC there is still a lack of understanding in the solid state joining possibilities and its microstructural changes and mechanical properties. The main objective of this work is to investigate and analyse the feasibility of joining the particulate-reinforced composite alloy by rotary friction welding and diffusion bonding processes. It is also aimed the determination and establishment of the microstructure/properties relationships of the resultant welds as well as to investigate the bonding mechanisms and understand the weldability aspects of friction welded and diffusion bonded Ti 6 Al 4 V 10 wt. % TiC. Metallurgical characterization of both base material and welded joints was performed using Optical and Scanning Electron Microscope. Mechanical assessment was accomplished using tensile, microflat tensile and fracture toughness tests. A microstructural examination of the friction-welded joints has revealed two distinct welding zones (transformed and recrystallized zone as well as heat affected zone); while no metallurgical transformation has occurred in the diffusion bonding process. In the case of rotary friction welding best results were associated with low rotational speed and low friction pressure; while in the diffusion bonding process the best results were associated with a bonding temperature and pressure of 1000 C and 5 MPa together with bonding times ranging from 35 and 60 minutes...|$|E
30|$|Some {{surgeons}} {{have reported}} <b>poor</b> outcomes and <b>fusion</b> rates secondary {{to a high}} rate of cage subsidence and pseudoarthrosis. They believed that this phenomenon occurred as a result of insufficient fixation power of cage alone. Allowing postoperative micro-motions to continuously occur between the contact surfaces of the cage and vertebra, these continuous micro-motions prevent the induction of bone fusion [6]. Internal fixation using anterior cervical plate (ACP) has been developed in order to enhance the stability provided by the intervertebral cages, to help prevent graft dislodgement, and ultimately to promote mature bony fusion of the spinal segment. Some authors reported lesser graft dislocations or collapse and higher fusion rates after ACDF with internal fixation compared with ACDF alone [7].|$|R

Our results show that fusion order is important for MBP binding affinity and HepA activity, while the linker sequences at domain junctions have significant effects on protein expression level, HepA activity and thermostability as well as GFP fluorescence.

Methods. A scoring method based on the assessment of increased signal denoting bone marrow edema on T 2 -weighted STIR sequences was used. MRI films were assessed blindly in random order at 2 sites by multiple readers. Intra- and interreader reliability was assessed by intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC); the 24 -week response of patients with AS randomized to placebo: infliximab (3 : 8) was assessed by effect size and standardized response mean. The reliability and responsiveness of the scoring method were compared for STIR and gadolinium diethylenetriaminepentaacetic (GdDTPA) -enhanced MRI sequences. Results. We scanned 11 patients with AS with clinically active disease and 11 additional patients randomized to the trial of infliximab therapy. ICC for total sacroiliac joint STIR score ranged from 0. 90 to 0. 98 (P < 0. 00001) and interobserver ICC for combined readers from the 2 sites was 0. 84 (P < 0. 0001). ICC for change scores was lower for STIR (ICC 0. 53) than for Gd-DTPA-enhanced sequences (ICC 0. 79). Responsiveness was <b>poor,</b> although <b>fusion</b> was evident in one-third of patients who received treatment (placebo:infliximab) and inflammation scores were low. Conclusion.

This method is based on two distinct polypeptide linkers which self-assemble in the presence of a specific peptide staple allowing on-demand and irreversible combination of protein domains. Here we show that linkers can either be expressed or be chemically conjugated to proteins of interest, depending on the source of the proteins.

Methods: The authors reviewed 18 patients (13 women and 5 men) over 70 years of age who underwent PLF with a minimum 2 -years follow-up at a single institution. The parameters for analysis were clinical outcome, intraoperative bleed-ing, operating time, transfusion amount, fusion rate, decreased disc height at the operated level, and the incidence of adjacent disc degeneration. Results: The mean age and follow-up duration were 74. 1 years and 44. 7 months, respectively. The mean fusion level was 2. 5 levels. 12 patients (66. 7 %) reported good or excellent outcomes, and 4 patients complained of <b>poor</b> outcomes. The <b>fusion</b> rate was 61. 1 %.

Twenty-two had been operated on before. Patellar displacement, present in 27 % of the cases, was the most frequent cause of complaint: pain or instability, proportional to the severity of displacement, made re-operation necessary in 10 % of the patients. Addition of a patellar prosthesis was the most successful treatment as far as pain is concerned: it is probably advisable as a primary procedure. Deep infections occurred in 8. 3 % of the cases, infrequently after 2 years. Healing was obtained in all cases either by revision or by removal and arthrodesis: but functional results were <b>poor</b> except when <b>fusion</b> was achieved, in half of the cases of arthrodesis. Loosening occurred in 16 % of the cases, mainly as a consequence of inadequate technique. It was frequently tolerated: re-operation was necessary in 6 % of the total.

40|$|Big {{gains in}} {{productivity}} {{are found in}} tandem and dual tandem pipeline welding but require highly skilled operators who have to control {{the position of the}} torch very accurately for long periods. This leads to high demands on the skills and stamina of the operators of mechanised pipeline welding systems. There is a very strong motivation to fully automate the welding process {{in order to reduce the}} required skills and to improve consistency. This project focuses on the use of through-the-arc sensing for seam following and contact-tip-workpiecedistance (CTWD) control. A review of literature reveals very little development work on arc sensing for Pulsed Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW-P) in narrow grooves. GMAW-P is often used to achieve optimum properties in weld quality and fusion characteristics and also positional welding capability, all of which are important factors for pipeline welding. The use of through-the-arc sensing for narrow groove pipe welding applications poses specific challenges due to the steep groove sidewalls and the use of short arc lengths, producing very different behaviour compared to V-groove arc sensing techniques. Tandem welding is also quite different from single wire techniques with both wires working in close proximity producing mutual interferences in arc signals. An investigation was conducted in order to assess GMAW-P arc signals and it was found that improved consistency, higher sensitivity and less noise was present in voltages in the peak current period (peak voltages) used for torch position control. As a result of this investigation, a CTWD and cross-seam control system was developed and tested for single and tandem GMAW-P, using a 5 º narrow groove. The test results have revealed accuracies for both controls of better than 0. 2 mm. CTWD control was developed by following the existent welding procedure voltage average and cross-seam control by peak voltage comparison between maximum torch excursions. Experiments were also performed to evaluate the influence of torch oscillation frequency on arc voltage behaviour and sensitivity, along with weld bead characteristics and fusion profiles. The resultant arc signal sensitivity was consistent with the results found in the literature for conventional GMAW. For GMAW-P, although no data was available from the literature for comparison, the results have shown no increase in sensitivity with the increase of oscillation frequency with the welding setup used. Bead profile analysis performed at different sidewall proximities indicated that optimum wire to sidewall proximities can be found between 0 mm and + 0. 2 mm, measured from the outer edge of the wire to the sidewall corner. Accurate control is required since + 1 mm proximity produced <b>poor</b> sidewall <b>fusion</b> and no signal differentiation for control recognition of groove width. This work showed that negative proximities or wire proximity beyond the sidewall produce wire burn back and hence very long arc lengths, resulting in poor depths of penetration and shallower beads, with major undercut defects. In addition, this work has also shown the importance of torch oscillation width control, in order to produce accurate cross-seam control. A method is proposed to achieve torch oscillation width control by a continuous peak voltage comparison between centre and sidewall torch positions, using the optimum values of wire to sidewall proximity found and the resultant peak voltage value. This control will also provide a clear indication of actual groove width. Clearly this data can also be used to implement a system which adapts welding parameters to groove width.

The use of proximal soil sensors and geostatistical techniques is highly recommended worldwide to detect spatial variation not only in fields but also within-field (micro-scale). This study involves, as a first step, the use of visible and near infrared (vis-NIR) spectroscopy to estimate soil key properties (6) and obtain high resolution maps that allow us to model the spatial variability in the soil. Different calibration models were developed using partial least square regression (PLSR) for different soil properties. These calibration models were evaluated by both cross-validation and independent validation. Results show good to excellent calibration models for most of soil properties under study in both cross-validation and independent validation. The on-line maps created using the collected on-line spectra and the calibration models previously estimated for each soil property were compared with three different maps (measured, predicted, error). The second step uses multivariate geostatistical analysis to develop three different geostatistical models (soil, spectral, fusion). The soil model includes 8 soil properties, spectral model includes 4 soil properties and the fusion model includes 12 soil properties. The three models were evaluated by cross-validation and the results show that the goodness of fitting can be considered as satisfactory for the soil model, whereas the performance of the spectral model was quite <b>poor.</b> Regarding the <b>fusion</b> model, it performed quite well, though the model generally underestimated the high values and overestimated the low values. An independent validation data set was used to evaluate the performance of the three models calculating three statistics: mean error (ME), as an indicator of bias; mean standardized squared error (MSSE), as an indicator of accuracy, and root mean squared error (RMSE), as an indicator of precision of estimation. Synthetically, the two, soil and fusion, models performed quite similarly, whereas the performance of the spectral model was much poorer. With regard to delineation of management zones (MZs), the factor cokriging analysis was applied using the three different models. The first factor (F 1) for the soil and fusion models was related to soil properties that affect soil fertility, whereas for the spectral model was related to P (- 0. 88) and pH (- 0. 42). Based on the first factor of the soil and fusion models, three management zones were delineated and classified as low, medium and high fertility zones using isofrequency classes. Spatial similarity between the yield map and delineated MZs maps based on F 1 for the soil and fusion models was calculated. The overall accordance between the two maps was 40. 0...|$|R
