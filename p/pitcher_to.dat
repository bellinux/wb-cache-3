5|$|At {{the time}} of his retirement, Wilhelm had pitched in a then major league record 1,070 games. He is {{recognized}} as the first <b>pitcher</b> <b>to</b> have saved 200 games in his career, and the first <b>pitcher</b> <b>to</b> appear in 1,000 games. Wilhelm {{is one of the oldest}} players to have pitched in the major leagues; his final appearance was 16 days short of his 50th birthday.|$|E
5|$|He was {{the first}} {{starting}} <b>pitcher</b> <b>to</b> throw a complete game without giving up an earned run against the Yankees in Game1 of a postseason series.|$|E
5|$|Koufax was {{the first}} major league <b>pitcher</b> <b>to</b> pitch four no-hitters and the eighth <b>pitcher</b> <b>to</b> pitch a perfect game in {{baseball}} history. Despite his comparatively short career, Koufax's 2,396 career strikeouts ranked 7th in history as of his retirement, trailing only Warren Spahn (2,583) among left-handers. Koufax, Randy Johnson, Pedro Martínez, and Nolan Ryan are the only four pitchers elected to the Hall of Fame who had more strikeouts than innings pitched.|$|E

5|$|Koufax was {{the first}} <b>pitcher</b> <b>to</b> win {{multiple}} Cy Young Awards, {{as well as the}} first <b>pitcher</b> <b>to</b> win a Cy Young Award by a unanimous vote. He is also the only <b>pitcher</b> <b>to</b> win three Cy Young Awards in the era in which the award was presented to one pitcher across the board, rather than one in each major league, and one of three Dodgers pitchers to win the one-across-the-board Cy Young Award. (The others were Don Newcombe, the first Cy Young winner in 1956, and Don Drysdale in 1962.) Each of Koufax's three Cy Young Awards were by unanimous vote. Koufax and Juan Marichal are the only two pitchers in the post-war era (1946-date) to have more than one 25-win season, with each pitcher recording three.|$|E
5|$|In an oddity, Greinke {{became the}} first <b>pitcher</b> <b>to</b> start three {{straight}} games in the Majors in 95 years. On July 7, he was ejected from the game after just 4 pitches for angrily throwing {{the ball into the}} ground following a close play at first base. The following day, Greinke started again, but lasted only until the third inning. The All-Star break followed, and Greinke was the Brewers' starter on July 13, the team's next game. Greinke's third start ended after 5 innings. Before this, the most recent <b>pitcher</b> <b>to</b> start three consecutive games was Red Faber in the 1917, who started both games of a September 3 doubleheader, throwing just six innings in total, followed by a complete game win the following day. Overall, Grienke finished the 2011 year with a 16-6 record, a 3.83 ERA, and 201 strikeouts in 28 starts.|$|E
5|$|On July 31, 2015, Hamels {{was traded}} to the Texas Rangers along with Jake Diekman in {{exchange}} for Matt Harrison, Nick Williams, Jorge Alfaro, Jake Thompson, Alec Asher, and Jerad Eickhoff. Hamels became the first <b>pitcher</b> <b>to</b> be traded during a regular season after pitching a no-hitter in his final start with the team that traded him. Bert Blyleven had been the last <b>pitcher</b> <b>to</b> pitch a no-hitter in his final start with the team that traded him; after pitching a no-hitter for the Rangers in his final start of the 1977 season, he {{was traded to}} the Pittsburgh Pirates that offseason.|$|E
50|$|On May 29, 1970, Mike Cuellar {{became one}} of only 20 American League <b>pitchers</b> <b>to</b> throw a four strike-out inning.|$|R

5|$|On October 20 at AT Park, in a 6-5 {{win over}} the Philadelphia Phillies in Game 4 of the National League Championship Series, Bumgarner became the third-youngest <b>pitcher</b> <b>to</b> start an LCS Game, {{according}} to Fox. Only Bret Saberhagen (20 years and 175 days) and Fernando Valenzuela (20 years, 347 days) were younger.|$|E
5|$|Shuey {{was honored}} as an All-American {{as a college}} {{baseball}} pitcher for the North Carolina Tar Heels baseball team. The Indians selected Shuey with the second overall selection of the 1992 MLB draft. Envisioned as a comparable <b>pitcher</b> <b>to</b> Cincinnati Reds closer Rob Dibble, Shuey had more success as a setup reliever than closer.|$|E
5|$|Steve Carlton in 1982 {{became the}} first <b>pitcher</b> <b>to</b> win more than three Cy Young Awards, while Greg Maddux in 1994 {{became the first}} to win at least {{three in a row}} (and {{received}} a fourth straight the following year), a feat later repeated by Randy Johnson.|$|E
50|$|Vogelsong and Barry Zito {{were the}} only <b>pitchers</b> <b>to</b> go undefeated in the postseason amongst all Giants' {{starting}} pitchers. Vogelsong posted a 3-0 record with a 1.09 ERA, allowing three runs through 24.2 innings, the lowest ERA among all Giants' starting pitchers. Vogelsong's postseason ERA was the best since Orel Hershiser's 1.05 in 1988 (minimum 24 innings). Vogelsong joined Christy Mathewson as the only <b>pitchers</b> <b>to</b> start their postseason careers with four consecutive starts of five or more innings giving up one run or fewer.|$|R
50|$|After losing four {{starters}} (Liván Hernández, Tony Armas, Ramón Ortiz and Pedro Astacio) from the prior year, the Nationals invited an extraordinary 36 <b>pitchers</b> <b>to</b> spring training.|$|R
50|$|During the season, Paul Derringer and Bucky Walters {{became the}} last <b>pitchers</b> <b>to</b> win at least 25 games {{in one season}} for the Reds in the 20th century.|$|R
5|$|When Ruth {{signed with}} the Yankees, he {{completed}} his transition from a <b>pitcher</b> <b>to</b> a power-hitting outfielder. His fifteen-season Yankee career consisted of over 2,000 games, and Ruth broke many batting records while making only five widely scattered appearances on the mound, winning all of them.|$|E
5|$|While on the Cubs, Lieber {{became the}} only Major League <b>pitcher</b> <b>to</b> give up a hit to a one handed player when he gave up not just one hit, but two to Jim Abbott, also {{allowing}} Abbott to drive in three RBIs.|$|E
5|$|After {{pitching}} to a 4-13 {{record and}} a 4.86 ERA, with a 5.71 ERA in the second half, the Yankees removed Hughes from the rotation on September 4, replacing him with David Huff. Hughes went 1–10 in home starts in 2013, making him just the second MLB <b>pitcher</b> <b>to</b> win fewer than two games when making at least 15 home starts in a season; the other being Phil Huffman of the Toronto Blue Jays in 1979. He has the third-highest ERA in Yankee history among pitchers with at least 500 innings pitched.|$|E
50|$|During the season, John Burkett and Bill Swift {{would be}} the last <b>pitchers</b> <b>to</b> win at least 20 games in one season for the Giants in the 20th Century.|$|R
50|$|Some {{baseball}} pitchers {{believe they}} can throw harder after ulnar collateral ligament reconstruction than they did beforehand. As a result, orthopedic surgeons have reported that parents of young <b>pitchers</b> have come <b>to</b> them {{and asked them to}} perform the procedure on their un-injured sons in the hope that this will increase their sons' performance. However, many people—including Dr. Frank Jobe—believe any post-surgical increases in performance are most likely due to the increased stability of the elbow joint and pitchers' increased attention to their fitness and conditioning. Jobe believed that, rather than allowing <b>pitchers</b> <b>to</b> gain speed, the surgery and rehab protocols merely allow <b>pitchers</b> <b>to</b> return to their pre-injury levels of performance.|$|R
50|$|Pan {{represented}} Chinese Taipei in the 2004 Olympic Game. He, {{along with}} Wang Chien-Ming, {{were the only}} two Taiwanese <b>pitchers</b> <b>to</b> have wins in the tournament. He was credited with two wins.|$|R
5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the finals series, the winner of two awards were announced. Matthew Blackmore won both the Pitcher of the Year award and the Finals Series MVP award. At the Baseball Australia Diamond Awards, held on 6 March at the Hotel Grand Chancellor, Adelaide, Wayne Lundgren was announced as the 35th winner of the Helms Award; the Claxton Shield's Most Valuable Player award. Lundgren was the first <b>pitcher</b> <b>to</b> win since 1986. Runners-up by two votes were Paul Mildren and Michael Collins.|$|E
5|$|Cueto walked Murphy {{with two}} outs in the ninth before getting Cespedes to fly out to right to finish the {{complete}} game, becoming the first AL <b>pitcher</b> <b>to</b> accomplish this feat in the World Series since Jack Morris in Game 7 of the 1991 World Series, as the Royals defeated the Mets and took a two games to zero lead in the series. Cueto became the first AL pitcher since Jim Lonborg in the 1967 World Series to throw a World Series complete game while allowing two hits or fewer.|$|E
5|$|Fernández's {{rookie season}} has been {{considered}} historic as his 4.2 Wins Above Replacement places him in the Top 10 player seasons among those under 21 years old since 1900. Fernández's Adjusted ERA+ of 174 on the season also places him in the Top 10 all-time for pitchers {{under the age of}} 21, and he is only the fourth <b>pitcher</b> <b>to</b> record this feat in the past 100 years. His strikeout rate is the highest in his league, pacing the National League at 9.81 strikeouts per nine innings.|$|E
50|$|In 2007, Pauly began {{coaching}} with at Spartanburg Methodist College and mentored <b>pitchers</b> <b>to</b> a deep postseason {{run at the}} Division I NJCAA National Tournament. In 2009, {{she joined}} the Charleston Cougars staff.|$|R

5|$|In 1974, Mike Marshall won the award, {{becoming}} the first relief <b>pitcher</b> <b>to</b> win the award. In 1992, Dennis Eckersley was the first modern closer (first player to be used almost exclusively in ninth-inning situations) to win the award, and since then only one other relief pitcher has won the award, Éric Gagné in 2003 (also a closer). A total of nine relief pitchers have won the Cy Young Award across both leagues.|$|E
5|$|In a 4–0 {{win over}} the Los Angeles Dodgers on May 21, Bumgarner paired up and beat Clayton Kershaw {{for the third time}} that season, {{becoming}} the first <b>pitcher</b> <b>to</b> hit a home run off of Kershaw. The home run made Kershaw the second Cy Young Award winner to surrender a home run to Bumgarner after Zack Greinke. He became the first reigning World Series MVP to homer off the defending League MVP.|$|E
5|$|In recent decades, {{pitchers}} {{have rarely}} won the award. When Justin Verlander won the AL award in 2011, {{he became the}} first pitcher in either league to be named the MVP since Dennis Eckersley in 1992. Verlander also became the first starting <b>pitcher</b> <b>to</b> win this award since Roger Clemens had accomplished the feat in 1986. The National League went even longer without an MVP award to a pitcher—after Bob Gibson won in 1968, no pitcher in that league was named MVP until Clayton Kershaw in 2014.|$|E
50|$|On August 15, Hernández {{threw the}} first perfect game in Mariners history and 23rd in MLB history. He {{recorded}} 12 strikeouts, five {{of which were}} {{in the last two}} innings, against the Tampa Bay Rays in a 1-0 victory. It was the fourth no-hitter in team history and Hernández joined Randy Johnson and Chris Bosio as the only Mariners <b>pitchers</b> <b>to</b> throw individual no-hitters. One of their no-hitters were combined, needing six <b>pitchers</b> <b>to</b> do so on June 8 against the Dodgers. His perfect game was the last no-hitter thrown in the American League for the next three years, until his Japanese teammate, Hisashi Iwakuma succeeded him on August 12, 2015.|$|R
50|$|On October 19, 2015, Jones {{announced}} his retirement, following 38 years in baseball. During {{his tenure as}} pitching coach, Jones coached two Tigers <b>pitchers</b> <b>to</b> Cy Young Awards, Justin Verlander in 2011, and Max Scherzer in 2013.|$|R
50|$|I didn't {{go along}} with it... I never {{believed}} in throwing at a guy, Raffensberger said, after Phillies manager Ben Chapman had instructed his <b>pitchers</b> <b>to</b> throw the ball at Jackie Robinson {{when there was a}} 3-0 count.|$|R
