50|$|Generally speaking, a <b>projectile</b> {{with greater}} volume faces greater air resistance, {{reducing}} {{the range of}} the <b>projectile.</b> (And see Trajectory of a <b>projectile.)</b> Air resistance drag can be modified by the <b>projectile</b> shape: a tall and wide, but short <b>projectile</b> will face greater air resistance than a low and narrow, but long, <b>projectile</b> of the same volume. The surface of the <b>projectile</b> also must be considered: a smooth <b>projectile</b> will face less air resistance than a rough-surfaced one, and irregularities on the surface of a <b>projectile</b> may change its trajectory if they create more drag {{on one side of the}} <b>projectile</b> than on the other. However, certain irregularities such as dimples on a golf ball may actually increase its range by reducing the amount of turbulence caused behind the <b>projectile</b> as it travels. Mass also becomes important, as a more massive <b>projectile</b> will have more kinetic energy, and will thus be less affected by air resistance. The distribution of mass within the <b>projectile</b> can also be important, as an unevenly weighted <b>projectile</b> may spin undesirably, causing irregularities in its trajectory due to the magnus effect.|$|R
5|$|Enomoto's fleet joined Sendai harbour on August 26. Although the Northern Coalition was numerous, it was poorly equipped, and {{relied on}} {{traditional}} fighting methods. Modern armament was scarce, and last-minute {{efforts were made}} to build cannons made of wood and reinforced with roping, firing stone <b>projectiles.</b> Such cannons, installed on defensive structures, could only fire four or five <b>projectiles</b> before bursting. On the other hand, the daimyō of Nagaoka managed to procure two of the three Gatling guns in Japan and 2,000 modern French rifles from the German weapons dealer Henry Schnell.|$|E

5|$|Donkey Kong's kidnapped friends become playable {{characters}} {{after the}} player rescues them. Each {{of the five}} characters begin with basic abilities and receive additional, unique abilities as the game progresses, including abilities needed to solve some puzzles.

The characters are also unique in the <b>projectiles</b> they shoot and the musical instruments they play. For example, some doors can only be opened with Donkey Kong's coconut <b>projectiles</b> and others can only be opened with Diddy Kong's guitar. There are more special abilities than face buttons on the controller, so button combinations are needed to trigger some abilities.|$|E
5|$|Given {{that element}} 120 fills the 2f5/2 proton orbital, much {{attention}} has been given to the compound nucleus 302Ubn and its properties. Several experiments have been performed between 2000 and 2008 at the Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions in Dubna studying the fission characteristics of the compound nucleus 302Ubn. Two nuclear reactions have been used, namely 244Pu+58Fe and 238U+64Ni. The results have revealed how nuclei such as this fission predominantly by expelling closed shell nuclei such as 132Sn (Z=50, N=82).

50|$|The above example {{illustrates}} the central problem fixed drag curve models have. These models will only yield satisfactory accurate predictions {{as long as}} the <b>projectile</b> of interest has the same shape as the reference <b>projectile</b> or a shape that closely resembles the reference <b>projectile.</b> Any deviation from the reference <b>projectile</b> shape will result in less accurate predictions. How much a <b>projectile</b> deviates from the applied reference <b>projectile</b> is mathematically expressed by the form factor (i). The form factor can be used to compare the drag experienced by a <b>projectile</b> of interest to the drag experienced by the employed reference <b>projectile</b> at a given velocity (range). The problem that the actual drag curve of a <b>projectile</b> can significantly deviate from the fixed drag curve of any employed reference <b>projectile</b> systematically limits the traditional drag resistance modeling approach. The relative simplicity however makes that it can be explained to and understood by the general shooting public and hence is also popular amongst ballistic software prediction developers and bullet manufacturers that want to market their products.|$|R

5000|$|Since these {{standard}} <b>projectile</b> shapes {{differ significantly}} the Gx BC will also {{differ significantly from}} the Gy BC for an identical bullet. [...] To illustrate this the bullet manufacturer Berger has published the G1 and G7 BCs {{for most of their}} target, tactical, varmint and hunting bullets. Other bullet manufacturers like Lapua and Nosler also published the G1 and G7 BCs for most of their target bullets. How much a <b>projectile</b> deviates from the applied reference <b>projectile</b> is mathematically expressed by the form factor (i). The applied reference <b>projectile</b> shape always has a form factor (i) of exactly 1. When a particular <b>projectile</b> has a sub 1 form factor (i) this indicates that the particular <b>projectile</b> exhibits lower drag than the applied reference <b>projectile</b> shape.

5000|$|The <b>projectile</b> {{continues}} to accelerate {{as long as}} the pressure behind it is sufficient to overcome bore friction and <b>projectile</b> weight. The excess energy will continue to accelerate the <b>projectile</b> until it exits the muzzle. If the pressure behind the <b>projectile</b> drops sufficiently before the <b>projectile</b> leaves the bore, the <b>projectile</b> can and will slow while still within the barrel, despite residual bore pressure behind the <b>projectile.</b> A light charge with insufficient pressure to expel the <b>projectile</b> will result in a [...] "squib", or <b>projectile</b> lodged in the bore. [...] This pressure is reduced by the increasing barrel volume the gas has to fill, and in order to achieve maximum muzzle velocity with the shortest barrel length, the <b>projectile</b> should exit the barrel as the gas pressure reduces to {{a small fraction of the}} maximum, although unlike chamber maximum chamber pressure, the small fraction desired is impossible to measure. In modern guns, increased muzzle velocities can be produced by altering powder composition and/or using duplex charges containing two different powders in order to extend the [...] "pressure curve" [...] further down the bore.
