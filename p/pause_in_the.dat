40|$|A recent {{controversy}} has emerged concerning {{the existence of}} long pauses, presumably refl ecting bistability of membrane potential, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cerebellar Purkinje cells (PC) of awake animals. It is generally agreed that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> anesthetized animals and in vitro, these cells switch between two stable membrane potential states: a depolarized state (the ‘up-state’) characterized by continuous fi ring of simple spikes (SS) and a hyperpolarized state (the ‘down-state’) characterized by long <b>pauses</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> SS activity. To address the existence of long <b>pauses</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> neural activity of cerebellar PCs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> awake and behaving animal we used extracellular recordings in cats and fi nd that {{approximately half of the}} recorded PCs exhibit such long <b>pauses</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> SS activity and transition between activity – periods with uninterrupted SS lasting an average of 1300 ms – and pauses up to several seconds. We called these cells pausing Purkinje cells (PPC) and they can easily be distinguished from continuous fi ring Purkinje cells. In most PPCs, state transitions in both directions were often associated (25 % of state transitions) with complex spikes (CSs). This is consistent with intracellular fi ndings of CS-driven state transitions. In sum, we present proof for the existence of long <b>pauses</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> PC SS activity that probably refl ect underlying bistability, provide the fi rst in-depth analysis of these pauses and show for the fi rst time that transitions in and out of these pauses are related to CS fi ring <b>in</b> <b>the</b> awake and behaving animal...|$|R
5|$|In mid-February, Wellington's army {{broke out}} of its small area of conquered {{territory}} near Bayonne. Moving east, the Allies drove the French back from several river lines. After a <b>pause</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> campaign, the western-most Allied corps surrounded and isolated Bayonne. Resuming their eastward drive, the remaining two Allied corps pushed Soult's army back to Orthez where the French marshal offered battle. In subsequent operations, Soult decided to abandon the large western port of Bordeaux and fall back east toward Toulouse. The next action was the Battle of Toulouse.|$|E
5|$|The British {{policy as}} stated in the {{declaration}} was to face numerous challenges to its implementation in the following years.

5|$|After Henry's death {{there was}} a <b>pause</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{conflict}} with France, during which {{many of the new}} fortifications were alllowed to deteriorate. There was little money available for repairs and the garrisons were reduced in size. East Cowes was abandoned around 1547 and fell into ruin, while the bulwarks along the Downs were defaced and their guns removed; they were formally removed from service in 1550. In 1552 the Essex fortifications were decommissioned, and several were subsequently pulled down. The expense of maintaining the fortifications in Hull led the Crown to agree a deal with the town authorities to take over management of them. Milton and Higham were demolished between 1557 and 1558. Mersea Fort was temporarily decommissioned, before being brought back into active service.|$|E
5|$|The Second Sino-Japanese War {{caused a}} <b>pause</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{conflict}} between the CPC and the KMT. The Second United Front was established between the CPC and the KMT to tackle the invasion. While the front formally existed until 1945, all collaboration {{between the two parties}} had ended by 1940. Despite their formal alliance, the CPC used the opportunity to expand and carve out independent bases of operations to prepare for the coming war with the KMT. In 1939 the KMT began to restrict CPC expansion within China. This led to frequent clashes between CPC and KMT forces but which subsided rapidly on the realisation on both sides that civil war was not an option. Yet, by 1943, the CPC was again actively expanding its territory {{at the expense of the}} KMT.|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that RNA polymerase <b>pausing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> leader region of the tryptophan (trp) operon of Escherichia coli {{is responsible for the}} synchronization of transcription and translation essential to attenuation control. In this report we use an in vitro coupled transcription/translation system to study the effect of trp leader peptide synthesis on RNA polymerase <b>pausing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> trp leader region. Wild-type and translation-defective trp leader templates of E. coli and Serratia marcescens were employed, and pause RNA synthesis and paused complex release (activation) were quantified relative to synthesis of the terminated leader transcript. It was observed that <b>pausing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> trp leader region was prolonged when translation of the leader transcript was reduced by mutations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> leader region or by addition of the translation inhibitor kasugamycin or chloramphenicol. Experiments with S- 30 extracts from a mutant strain that is inefficient <b>in</b> translating <b>the</b> tryptophan codons <b>in</b> <b>the</b> leader transcript indicated that ribosome movement to these codons also releases the paused transcription complex. These findings indicate that the paused trp leader transcription complex resumes transcription when released by ribosome movement over the leader peptide coding region. This release would facilitate the coupling of transcription and translation essential to attenuation control...|$|R

25|$|Owing {{to supply}} {{problems}} during the advance from Beersheba, Allenby had left Philip W. Chetwode's XX Corps {{in the rear}} close to {{the lines of communication}} where they could be easily supplied and refitted. After 10 days rest, these fresh troops were ordered to the front in the Judean Hills to take over the offensive against the Ottoman Seventh Army. On 23 November, the 60th (London) Division, commanded by Major General John Shea, arrived at Latron from Huj and relieved the seriously depleted 52nd (Lowland) and the 75th Divisions, without much of a reduction in fighting ability on 28 November. On the same day, the 74th (Yeomanry) Division, commanded by Major General E. S. Girdwood, arrived at Latron from Karm, and two days later the 10th (Irish) Division, commanded by Major General J. R. Longley, also arrived at Latron from Karm. The movement of such large formations made a <b>pause</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fighting unavoidable, and so the attack was discontinued, but von Falkenhayn and his Ottoman Army took notice of the temporary cessation of hostilities.|$|E

Deploying men to {{both sides of the}} Quaker Road, Chamberlain, on horseback, led a charge up the Quaker Road toward the Confederate strong point, a large sawdust pile that provided cover for many Confederate soldiers. Chamberlain got ahead of his men and became an obvious target. He was wounded in the arm and his horse was wounded in the neck. Chamberlain slumped on his horse, initially unconscious, but regained consciousness in time to respond to General Griffin who had come up to check on Chamberlain's condition. Then Chamberlain rallied his Pennsylvania regiment who were retreating from a Confederate charge. When his wounded horse could not continue, Chamberlain went to the front of his line on foot. Several Confederate soldiers soon appeared and demanded Chamberlain's surrender. Chamberlain had lost his hat and was wearing a faded coat, almost gray in color. Pretending to be a Confederate officer, he led the Confederates back toward Union soldiers who promptly captured them.|$|E
25|$|According to Jean Jacques Pelet, one of Masséna's staff officers, Loison was an intriguer. On {{at least}} one {{occasion}} Loison expressed his dissatisfaction with Ney, while another time the marshal unfairly blamed Loison for exposing his artillery to capture. On 22 March, when the army had nearly reached a safe position, Ney flatly refused to obey Masséna's orders and was dismissed. Command of the VI Corps passed to Loison, who led the corps at the Battle of Fuentes de Onoro on 3 to 5 May 1811. During the battle he supervised 17,406 troops in three divisions led by Jean Gabriel Marchand, Julien Augustin Joseph Mermet, and Ferey. On 3 May Ferey battered at the village of Fuentes de Onoro in vain. After a day's <b>pause</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> action, Masséna ordered Ferey to attack the village again on the 5th, supported by IX Corps. Meanwhile, Loison's other two divisions, {{the bulk of the}} French cavalry, and a third infantry division attempted an envelopment of the Anglo-Portuguese right flank. After some tough fighting, the French attacks were stopped. Soon after the battle Marshal Auguste Marmont replaced Masséna and did away with the corps organization, leaving Junot, Marchand, Mermet, and other generals without employment.|$|E
25|$|Before the offensive, Falkenhayn had {{expected}} that French artillery {{on the west}} bank would be suppressed by counter-battery fire but this had failed. The Germans set up a specialist artillery force to counter French artillery-fire from the west bank but this also failed to reduce German infantry casualties. The 5th Army asked for more troops in late February but Falkenhayn refused, due to the rapid advance already achieved on the east bank and because he needed the rest of the OHL reserve for an offensive elsewhere, once the attack at Verdun had attracted and consumed French reserves. The <b>pause</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> German advance on 27 February led Falkenhayn to have second thoughts to decide between terminating the offensive or reinforcing it. On 29 February, Knobelsdorf, the 5th Army Chief of Staff, prised two divisions from the OHL reserve, with the assurance that once the heights {{on the west bank}} had been occupied, the offensive on the east bank could be completed. The VI Reserve Corps was reinforced with the X Reserve Corps, to capture a line from the south of Avocourt to Côte 304 north of Esnes, Mort-Homme, Bois des Cumières and Côte 205, from which the French artillery on the west bank could be destroyed.|$|E
25|$|An {{additional}} function {{provided by}} <b>the</b> carrier <b>in</b> standard AM, {{but which is}} lost in either single or double-sideband suppressed-carrier transmission, is that it provides an amplitude reference. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> receiver, the automatic gain control (AGC) responds to the carrier so that the reproduced audio level stays in a fixed proportion to the original modulation. On the other hand, with suppressed-carrier transmissions there is no transmitted power during <b>pauses</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> modulation, so the AGC must respond to peaks of the transmitted power during peaks <b>in</b> <b>the</b> modulation. This typically involves a so-called fast attack, slow decay circuit which holds the AGC level {{for a second or}} more following such peaks, in between syllables or short <b>pauses</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> program. This is very acceptable for communications radios, where compression of the audio aids intelligibility. However it is absolutely undesired for music or normal broadcast programming, where a faithful reproduction of the original program, including its varying modulation levels, is expected.|$|R
