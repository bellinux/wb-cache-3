5000|$|<b>Proportional</b> <b>Band</b> is {{the band}} of Controller Output over which the Final Control Element (a Control Valve, for instance) will move from one extreme to another. Mathematically, it can be {{expressed}} as: ...|$|E
50|$|In real systems, {{there are}} {{practical}} {{limits to the}} range of the manipulated variable (MV). For example, a heater can be off or fully on, or a valve can be closed or fully open. Adjustments to the gain simultaneously alter the range of error values over which the MV is between these limits. The width of this range, in units of the error variable and therefore of the PV, is called the <b>proportional</b> <b>band</b> (PB). While the gain is useful in mathematical treatments, the <b>proportional</b> <b>band</b> is often used in practical situations. They both refer to the same thing, but the PB has an inverse relationship to gain - higher gains result in narrower PBs, and vice versa.|$|E
50|$|The {{integral}} term magnifies {{the effect}} of long-term steady-state errors, applying ever-increasing effort until they reduce to zero. In {{the example of the}} furnace above working at various temperatures, if the heat being applied does not bring the furnace up to setpoint, for whatever reason, integral action increasingly moves the <b>proportional</b> <b>band</b> relative to the setpoint until the PV error is reduced to zero and the setpoint is achieved.|$|E

40|$|Metal Auger line {{intensity}} ratios {{were shown}} by Rao {{and others to}} be {{directly related to the}} occupancy of valence states. It is now shown that these intensity ratios are more generally related to the effective charge on the metal atom. The Auger intensity ratios are also directly <b>proportional</b> to valence <b>band</b> intensities of metals. Correlations of the intensity ratios with Auger parameters have also been examined...|$|R
40|$|Observations of the quasar PG 1211 + 143 are {{presented}} and its continuum is modelled {{in terms of}} an accretion disk and an underlying power law. The X-ray spectrum in the Einstein imaging <b>proportional</b> counter <b>band</b> is well described by a power law with the very steep spectral index 2. 2 + or - 0. 4. The overall continuum spectral energy distribution can be described as a power law with alpha roughly 1. 2 from the infrared to about 1 keV, with the optical, ultraviolet, and soft X-rays forming a large excess above this power law. If the soft X-ray excess is attributed to emission from a physically thin, optically thick accretion disk, then the implied accretion rate is super-Eddington, from which it is concluded that the application of this simple model is not valid. The observed broad-line ratios in PG 1211 + 143 imply broad-line cloud densities that are somewhat higher than those usually derived for quasars...|$|R
5000|$|So if , the Proportional Gain, is very high, the <b>Proportional</b> <b>Band</b> is very small, {{which means}} that the Band of Controller Output, over which the final Control Element, like a Control Valve, will go from minimum to maximum (or vice versa) is very small. This is the case with ON-OFF Controllers, where [...] is very high and hence, for even a small error, the Controller Output is driven from one extreme to another.|$|E
50|$|In {{the furnace}} example, suppose the {{temperature}} is increasing towards a set point at which, say, 50% of the available power will be required for steady-state. At low temperatures, 100% of available power is applied. When the process value (PV) is within, say 10° of the SP the heat input begins to be reduced by the proportional controller (note that this implies a 20° <b>proportional</b> <b>band</b> (PB) from full to no power input, evenly spread around the setpoint value). At the setpoint the controller will be applying 50% power as required, but stray stored heat within the heater sub-system and in {{the walls of the}} furnace will keep the measured temperature rising beyond what is required. At 10° above SP, we reach the top of the <b>proportional</b> <b>band</b> (PB) and no power is applied, but the temperature may continue to rise even further before beginning to fall back. Eventually as the PV falls back into the PB, heat is applied again, but now the heater and the furnace walls are too cool and the temperature falls too low before its fall is arrested, so that the oscillations continue.|$|E
50|$|Suppose {{that the}} gain {{of the control}} system is reduced {{drastically}} and it is restarted. As the temperature approaches, say 30° below SP (60° <b>proportional</b> <b>band</b> (PB)), the heat input begins to be reduced, the rate of heating of the furnace has time to slow and, as the heat is still further reduced, it eventually is brought up to set point, just as 50% power input is reached and the furnace is operating as required. There was some wasted time while the furnace crept to its final temperature using only 52% then 51% of available power, but at least no harm was done. By carefully increasing the gain (i.e. reducing {{the width of the}} PB) this overdamped and sluggish behavior can be improved until the system is critically damped for this SP temperature. Doing this is known as 'tuning' the control system. A well-tuned proportional furnace temperature control system will usually be more effective than on-off control, but will still respond more slowly than the furnace could under skillful manual control.|$|E

The cover width (B) is preferably more than 200 mm and more than ten times {{the width of the}} gaps (b). DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The width of the covers is therefore proportional to the wavelength of the sound signals to be absorbed and the width of the gaps is <b>proportional</b> to their <b>band</b> width. This increases the sound absorption of the porous absorber layer at deep frequencies. The absorber layer can be of glass wool, mineral wool or foam. USE - As a {{sound absorber}}.

40|$|A simple model which {{combines}} tight-binding (TB) approximation with parameters derived from first principle calculations is developed {{for studying the}} influence of edge passivation and uniaxial strain on electron effective mass of armchair graphene nanoribbons (AGNRs). We show that these effects can be described within the same model Hamiltonian by simply modifying the model parameters i. e., the hopping integrals and onsite energies. Our model reveals a linear dependence of effective mass on band gap for H-passivated AGNRs for small band gaps. For large band gap, the effective mass dependence on band gap is parabolic and analytic fits were derived for AGNRs belonging to different families. Both band gap and effective mass exhibit a nearly periodic zigzag variation under strain, indicating that the effective mass remains <b>proportional</b> to the <b>band</b> gap even when strain is applied. Our calculations {{could be used for}} studying carrier mobility in intrinsic AGNRs semiconductors where carrier scattering by phonons is the dominant scattering mechanism...|$|R
40|$|Many {{experiments}} {{require a}} fast and cost-effective method to monitor {{nucleic acid sequence}} diversity. Here we describe a method called diversity visualization by endonuclease (DiVE) that allows rapid visualization of sequence diversity of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products based on DNA hybridization kinetics coupled with the activity of a single-strand specific nuclease. The assay involves {{only a limited number}} of steps and can be performed in less than 4 h, including the initial PCR. After PCR, the homoduplex double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) is denatured and reannealed under stringent conditions. During the reannealing process, incubation with S 1 nuclease removes single-stranded loops of formed heteroduplexes and the resulting digest is visualized on agarose gel. The sequence diversity is inversely <b>proportional</b> to the <b>band</b> intensities of S 1 nuclease surviving dsDNA molecules of expected size. As an example, we employed DiVE to monitor the diversity of panning rounds from a single-framework, semisynthetic single-chain antibody fragment (scFv) phage display library. The results are in good agreement with the observed decrease in diversity in phage display panning rounds toward the selection of monoclonal scFv. We conclude that the DiVE assay allows rapid and cost-effective monitoring of diversities of various nucleotide libraries and proves to be particularly suitable for scaffold-based randomized libraries...|$|R

40|$|Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. In this review, {{we discuss}} our recent {{theoretical}} {{work on the}} nonlinear optical response of graphene and its sister structure in terahertz (THz) and near-infrared frequency regime. Due to Dirac-like linear energy-momentum dispersion, the third-order nonlinear current in graphene is much stronger than that in conventional semiconductors. The nonlinear current grows rapidly with increasing temperature and decreasing frequency. The third-order nonlinear current can be {{as strong as the}} linear current under moderate electric field strength of 104 V/cm. In bilayer graphene (BLG) with low energy trigonal warping effect, not only the optical response is strongly nonlinear, the optical nonlinearity is well-preserved at elevated temperature. In the presence of a bandgap (such as semihydrogenated graphene (SHG)), there exists two well separated linear response and nonlinear response peaks. This suggests that SHG can have a unique potential as a two-color nonlinear material in the THz frequency regime where the relative intensity of the two colors can be tuned with the electric field. In a graphene superlattice structure of Kronig-Penney type periodic potential, the Dirac cone is elliptically deformed. We found that not only the optical nonlinearity is preserved in such a system, the total optical response is further enhanced by a factor <b>proportional</b> to the <b>band</b> anisotropy. This suggests that graphene superlattice is another potential candidate in THz device application...|$|R
40|$|The key {{on-board}} calibrators (OBCs) of MODIS {{include a}} solar diffuser (SD) for the reflective solar bands calibration and a blackbody (BB) for the thermal emissive bands calibration. MODIS {{also has a}} space view (SV) port through which the detectors can view the dark space to provide background signal and the Moon during lunar calibration. As a whisk-broom scanning spectroradiometer, the spectral bands of MODIS are spread on its focal plane assemblies (FPA) in the along-scan direction. The images of these bands are spatially co-registered by delaying the observations of individual band according to their location on the FPA {{to account for the}} along-scan motion needed to view the same target. While this co-registration works well for the “far field ” Earth view (EV) target, significant band-to-band image misregistration in the along-scan direction has been observed when the detectors view “near field ” targets, such as the OBCs. In this paper, this “near field ” misregistration phenomenon is presented and analyzed, using the OBC images acquired when the electric sector rotation is applied. It is shown that the amount of the misregistration is <b>proportional</b> to the <b>band</b> location and the linear coefficient is inversely proportional to the distance between the object and the scan mirror. The root cause of the misregistration is provided. Also discussed in this paper is the calibration impact due to the “near field” misregistration for MODIS and sensors with MODIS-like scanning mechanism...|$|R
5000|$|When {{subjected}} to a high enough voltage, insulators suffer from the phenomenon of electrical breakdown. When the electric field applied across an insulating substance exceeds in any location the threshold breakdown field for that substance, the insulator suddenly becomes a conductor, causing a large increase in current, an electric arc through the substance. Electrical breakdown occurs when the electric field in the material {{is strong enough to}} accelerate free charge carriers (electrons and ions, which are always present at low concentrations) to a high enough velocity to knock electrons from atoms when they strike them, ionizing the atoms. These freed electrons and ions are in turn accelerated and strike other atoms, creating more charge carriers, in a chain reaction. Rapidly the insulator becomes filled with mobile charge carriers, and its resistance drops to a low level. In a solid, the breakdown voltage is <b>proportional</b> to the <b>band</b> gap energy. The air in a region around a high-voltage conductor can break down and ionise without a catastrophic increase in current; this is called [...] "corona discharge". However, if the region of air breakdown extends to another conductor at a different voltage it creates a conductive path between them, and a large current flows through the air, creating an electric arc. Even a vacuum can suffer a sort of breakdown, but in this case the breakdown or vacuum arc involves charges ejected from the surface of metal electrodes rather than produced by the vacuum itself.|$|R
40|$|The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) {{instruments}} aboard Terra and Aqua satellites are radiometrically calibrated on-orbit {{with a set}} of onboard calibrators (OBCs), {{including a}} solar diffuser, a blackbody, and a space view port through which the detectors can view the dark space. As a whisk-broom scanning spectroradiometer, thirty-six MODIS spectral bands are assembled in the along-scan direction on four focal plane assemblies (FPAs). These bands capture images of the same target sequentially with the motion of a scan mirror. Then the images are coregistered onboard by delaying the appropriate band-dependent amount of time, depending on the band locations on the FPA. While this coregistration mechanismis functioning well for the far-field remote targets such as earth view scenes or the moon, noticeable band-to-band misregistration in the along-scan direction has been observed for near field targets, particularly in OBCs. In this paper, the misregistration phenomenon is presented and analyzed. It is concluded that the root cause of the misregistration is that the rotating element of the instrument, the scan mirror, is displaced from the focus of the telescope primary mirror. The amount of the misregistrationis <b>proportional</b> to the <b>band</b> location on the FPA and is inversely proportional to the distance between the target and the scan mirror. The impact of this misregistration on the calibration of MODIS bands is discussed. In particular, the calculation of the detector gain coefficient m 1 of bands 8 - 16 (412 nm 870 nm) is improved by up to 1. 5 % for Aqua MODIS...|$|R
40|$|Intrinsic long {{wavelength}} (lambda {{greater than}} or equal to 10 microns) infrared (IR) detectors are currently made from the alloy (Hg, Cd) Te. There is one parameter, the alloy composition, which can be varied to control the properties of this material. The parameter is chosen to set the band gap (cut-off wavelength). The (Hg, Cd) Te alloy has the zincblend crystal structure. Consequently, the electron and light-hole effective masses are essentially inversely <b>proportional</b> to the <b>band</b> gap. As a result, the electron and light-hole effective masses are very small (M sub(exp asterisk) /M sub o approx. M sub Ih/M sub o approx. less than 0. 01) whereas the heavy-hole effective mass is ordinary size (M sub hh(exp asterisk) /M sub o approx. 0. 4) for the alloy compositions required for intrinsic long wavelength IR detection. This combination of effective masses leads to rather easy tunneling and relatively large Auger transition rates. These are undesirable characteristics, which must be designed around, of an IR detector material. They follow directly from the fact that (Hg, Cd) Te has the zincblend crystal structure and a small band gap. In small band gap superlattices, such as HgTe/CdTe, In(As, Sb) /InSb and InAs/(Ga,In) Sb, the band gap is determined by the superlattice layer thicknesses as well as by the alloy composition (for superlattices containing an alloy). The effective masses are not directly related to the band gap and can be separately varied. In addition, both strain and quantum confinement can be used to split the light-hole band away from the valence band maximum. These band structure engineering options can be used to reduce tunneling probabilities and Auger transition rates compared with a small band gap zincblend structure material. Researchers discuss the different band structure engineering options for the various classes of small band gap superlattices...|$|R
