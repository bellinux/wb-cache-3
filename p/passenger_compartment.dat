5|$|In Arizona v.

5|$|In response, SMRT {{announced}} it was replacing important engineering components on all C151 trains by 2019. This included changing the existing Mitsubishi Electric propulsion system for the newer Insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) and Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (PMSM) propulsion system by Toshiba, technology currently used in the Tokyo Metro's 1000 series and 16000 series trains {{as well as the}} Kyushu 305 series and Hankyu 1000 series trains. As of July 2015, train sets 055/056 and 131/132 are trialed with the new propulsion system. In tandem with the replacement of the signalling system on the East-West Line and North-South Line with the newer Thales SelTrac signalling system, new equipment are installed in the <b>passenger</b> <b>compartment</b> of the trailer cars.|$|E

5|$|On the {{afternoon}} of October 19, 2013, a BART employee and a contractor, who were inspecting tracks, were struck and killed near Walnut Creek by a train being moved for routine maintenance. A labor strike by BART's two major unions was underway at the time, which cause BART to use an undertrained operator. Instead of the usual 14 weeks of the training, the operator only received four. The BART trainer {{was not in the}} cab with the operator at the time of impact but was instead in the <b>passenger</b> <b>compartment.</b> BART was fined $600,000 for the incident.|$|E
25|$|Siren speakers, or {{mechanical}} sirens, {{should always}} be mounted ahead of the <b>passenger</b> <b>compartment.</b> This reduces the noise for occupants and makes two-way radio and mobile telephone audio more intelligible during siren use. It also puts the sound {{where it will be}} useful. Studies in some agencies operating emergency vehicles show sound levels over 120dB(A) in the <b>passenger</b> <b>compartment.</b> In one study, a specific vehicle's engine sounds and the siren produced sound levels over 123dB(A) in the <b>passenger</b> <b>compartment.</b>|$|E

These features included a heater, theft-proof locks, rotary door-latches, defroster vents, dual horns, full-wheel covers, ashtray, and a lighted ignition switch that were typical extras on the competing makes. While the inclusion of a <b>passenger</b> <b>compartment</b> heater as standard may be unusual to present day car users, even the high-priced Cadillac still counted a <b>passenger</b> <b>compartment</b> heater as extra in 1953, at an option cost of US$199.|$|E

5000|$|In normal use, the <b>passenger</b> <b>compartments</b> are {{ventilated}} by microprocessor controlled ceiling ducts. Emergency ventilation can {{be achieved}} by tilting open the upper parts of some of the side windows. Heating elements are fitted to the sidewalls. Interior lighting is provided by fluorescent lamps, and the <b>passenger</b> <b>compartments</b> also have visual information systems, with multilingual acoustic stop announcements. All members of the class have been liveried since new in a red, white and grey design.|$|R
50|$|At a maximum, three Dm12 units can be coupled into a {{train to}} {{increase}} capacity. Each car has two <b>passenger</b> <b>compartments,</b> two entrance vestibules and a driver's cabin {{at each end of}} the car. The driver cabins have air conditioning. There are two places for wheelchair-using passengers, the unit has lifting platforms for wheelchair access and the toilet is designed to be accessible to the disabled. The heating of the <b>passenger</b> <b>compartments</b> uses waste heat from the diesel engines.|$|R
50|$|The <b>passenger</b> <b>compartment's</b> layout {{was derived}} from the {{so-called}} Silberling (silverling) polished stainless steel short-line passenger coaches, with open-plan compartments. The trains had oil heating.|$|R

25|$|Photovoltaic modules {{are used}} commercially as {{auxiliary}} power units on passenger cars {{in order to}} ventilate the car, reducing {{the temperature of the}} <b>passenger</b> <b>compartment</b> while it is parked in the sun.

25|$|The SNCASE S.E.2010 Armagnac {{was a large}} French {{airliner}} of {{the late}} 1940s built by SNCASE (Sud-Est).

50|$|Just after 7pm on 23 June 1917, {{in light}} mist, a train bound for Box Hill {{smashed into the}} rear of a {{stationary}} train heading for Kew, while approaching Richmond station. The locomotive of the Box Hill train penetrated the guard's <b>compartment</b> and three <b>passenger</b> <b>compartments</b> of the rear carriage of the Kew train. No-one was travelling in the three <b>passenger</b> <b>compartments,</b> and the guard of the Kew train was thrown clear by the impact, sustaining a broken leg.

25|$|The Amtrac on {{the right}} manoeuvred itself off the road into a little {{depression}} and as it did so, disembarked the Marines inside (including one wounded, Private Horacio Tello) out of view. This encouraged the Royal Marines to think that Marine Mark Gibbs had scored a direct hit on the <b>passenger</b> <b>compartment</b> of the APC.|$|E
25|$|Heaters {{are also}} {{available}} for engine oil so that warm oil can immediately circulate throughout the engine during start up. The easier starting results from warmer, less viscous engine oil and less condensation of fuel on cold metal surfaces inside the engine; thus an engine block heater reduces a vehicle's emission of unburned hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide; also heat is available more instantly for the <b>passenger</b> <b>compartment</b> and glass defogging.|$|E
25|$|A {{few minutes}} after 2:00p.m. CST (20:00 UTC), Kennedy's remains were taken from Parkland Hospital to Love Field. His casket was then loaded onto Air Force One through the rear door, where it {{remained}} {{at the rear of}} the <b>passenger</b> <b>compartment</b> in place of a removed row of seats. Johnson had accompanied Kennedy to Dallas and was riding two cars behind the President in the motorcade. The new President refused to leave for Washington without the remains of Kennedy and his widow Jacqueline.|$|E

50|$|The {{popularity}} of the touring car began to wane in the 1920s when cars with enclosed <b>passenger</b> <b>compartments</b> became more affordable, and began to consistently out-sell the open cars.|$|R
50|$|These {{cars were}} built with hinged {{doors to the}} <b>passenger</b> <b>compartments,</b> an {{arrangement}} that caused delays during station stops, as each door had to be manually checked before the train departed.|$|R
25|$|The yellow New York City taxi {{has become}} iconic {{in its use}} {{in the arts and}} media. Some artists have used the taxis as a medium for their artwork. In 2011 artist Amir Baradaran {{conducted}} Transient an art instillation using the taxis’ <b>passenger</b> <b>compartment</b> TV screens to broadcast a 40-second video of the driver’s eyes as they reflect from the rearview mirror. The video was meant to confront the rider with a presence that is typically ignored and to create a moment of introspection.|$|E
25|$|The {{modifications}} to the Concord started with a two-door sedan monocoque (unitized) body. To add strength to the platform after the removal of its roof, fourteen steel reinforcements were welded to the undercarriage and a steel targa roll bar was welded to the door pillars for rigidity, as well as additional <b>passenger</b> <b>compartment</b> protection. The front section of the roof (ahead of the targa bar) was a removable lightweight fiberglass hatch, while the rear section of polyvinyl material folded and included a tonneau cover {{for use in the}} down position.|$|E
25|$|In 1980, AMC {{entered into}} an {{agreement}} with the Griffith Company for a convertible body style Eagle, and a prototype version was developed. The cars were marketed during the 1981 and 1982 model years as the Sundancer conversion. The Eagle's monocoque (unibody) body was reinforced and a steel targa roll bar was welded to the door pillars for <b>passenger</b> <b>compartment</b> protection. The front portion of the roof was a removable lightweight fiberglass hatch, while the rear section of polyvinyl material and the back window folded down and had a boot cover when in the down position.|$|E
