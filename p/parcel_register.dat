40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} {{a framework for}} developing the Exploration and Mining Cadastre System (EMCS), which involves all activities related to exploration areas, including registration and subsequent legal issues in a broader sense. It is built with two main purposes in mind: (1) enable necessary surveys, observe applicant 2 ̆ 7 s reserved <b>parcel,</b> <b>register</b> the parcel online, and issue and follow up necessary permits/licenses {{in the field of}} exploration, (2) provide a mutual platform for data exchange among various service systems in the field of exploration and mining in Iran. The EMCS model is designed in Unified Modeling Language (UML) with three main sets of classes: (1) RegisterObject (2) ActivityLicense, and (3) Person. Other relevant features of the model are also specified at the class level. These include: conditional registered parcels, unregisterable areas such as prohibited or protected areas, legal borders around registered or serving parcels, reference documents such as legal survey results documents, responsibilities, and restrictions. The model also considers issues related to exploration cost, parcel code, tax, royalty, commodity, priorities, facilitations, evaluation, transfer of ownership, changing parameters, and temporal registration. The temporal aspects of the classes are also supported by the model {{to take care of the}} time periods that involve the general procedures in the registration of exploration and mining properties. We anticipate that the framework and model structure provide a platform for data storage, improve the supervision of exploration and mining process, change manual into online registration system, prevent administrative corruption, and reduce bureaucracy...|$|E

40|$|The present paper {{tends to}} give {{information}} on territorial cadastre, {{as well as}} of the cadastral registración of the rights on the real estate, and theirs essential documents in Argentina. The land registration is carried out by the Territorial Cadastre and Land Registry, taking to the parcel as the unit of registration. They are managed by the respective provincial rules. In the Territorial Cadastre the <b>parcels</b> are <b>registered</b> with reference to the state of right contained in the public document or possession exercised.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the plans {{being made in}} Albania to establish an immovable property registration system in the most efficient way. It considers not only technically modern equipment and computer-related problems but also social and economic feasibility. In Albania, the immovable property registration system is {{necessary in order to}} face successfully the new conditions of the free market-oriented economy. For about 50 years, property ownership in Albania was restricted to the State. The 1991 land reform in Albania advanced quickly, and at present over 90 percent of agricultural land is distributed to farmers, though in highly fragmented holdings (totaling an average area average of 2 hectares), creating about 1. 8 million new <b>parcels</b> <b>registered</b> in the cadastral district offices. In urban areas, housing privatization was also completed quickly, creating about 300, 000 new properties in cities, which are being registered in the Hipoteka (deed registry) district offices. Although market transactions in agriculture land are not yet allowed (though enabling legislation is expected to be passed soon), many land transactions have taken place. The housing market is already very active. Conflicts exist, especially in urban areas, between ex-owners of the land and buildings, and the state or present occupants. Therefore, it is highly desirable to establish a property registration system in Albania quickly and yet with careful planning. This paper {{presents the}} registration information system model.

When collecting <b>parcels</b> or <b>registered</b> post, the name seal serves as an identification, akin to a signature. In banks, traditionally the method of identification was also by a seal. Seals remain the customary form of identification on cheques in mainland China and Taiwan but not in Hong Kong where signatures are required. Today, personal identification is often by a hand signature accompanied by a seal imprint. Seals can serve as identification with signatures because they are difficult to forge (when compared to forging a signature) and only the owner has access to his own seal.|$|R

40|$|The {{vision of}} a {{spatially}} enabled government involves establishing an enabling infrastructure to facilitate use of place or location to organise information about activities of people and businesses, and about government actions, decisions and polices. Once the infrastructure is built, spatial enablement allows government information and services, business transactions and community activities to be linke d to places or locations. Given the potential of new technologies, use of place or location will facilitate the evaluation and analysis of both spatial and non-spatial relationships between people, business transactions and government. Most governments already have considerable infrastructure and administrative systems for better management of land and resources. Basic information creating processes are cadastral surveying that identifies land and running a digital cadastral database (DCDB) providing the spatial integrity and unique land <b>parcel</b> identification, <b>registering</b> land that supports simple land trading (buying, selling, mortgaging and leasing land); running land information systems (LIS); and geographic information systems (GIS) that provide mappin g and resource information.

40|$|The {{residence}} {{time of a}} tracer in a control domain is usually computed by releasing tracer <b>parcels</b> and <b>registering</b> the time when each of these tracer parcels cross the boundary of the control domain. In this Lagrangian procedure, the particles are discarded or omitted {{as soon as they}} leave the control domain. In a Eulerian approach, the same approach can be implemented by integrating forward in time the advection diffusion equation for a tracer. So far, the conditions to be applied at the boundary of the control domain were uncertain. We show here {{that it is necessary to}} prescribe that the tracer concentration vanishes at the boundary of the control domain to ensure the compatibility between the Lagrangian and Eulerian approaches. When we use the Constituent oriented Age and Residence time Theory (CART), this amounts to solving the differential equation for the {{residence time}} with boundary conditions forcing the residence time to vanish at the open boundaries of the control domain. Such boundary conditions are likely to induce the development of boundary layers (at outflow boundaries for the tracer concentration and at inflow boundaries for the residence time). The thickness of these boundary layers is of the order of the ratio of the diffusivity to the velocity. They can however be partly smoothed by tidal and other oscillating flows...|$|R

40|$|Helmert's {{variance}} component {{estimation method}} {{based on a}} least-squares adjustment of condition equations is presented, in which the registered area and the coordinates of a cadastral parcel {{are assumed to be}} different and independent types of observations with errors in the cadastral parcel area adjustment. The Helmert method is employed for the estimation of variance components of these two types of observations, thus providing a determination of accurate weights between them. At the same time, inconsistencies between the registered and digitized areas of the parcels are adjusted through a least-squares adjustment. The mathematical models for adjusting the boundaries of the parcel areas are derived, incorporating both the area conditions and geometric conditions. An empirical test is conducted and the results are compared to those obtained from the conventional method, assuming that the digitized coordinates are treated as observations while the <b>registered</b> <b>parcel</b> areas are not. The analysis of the results demonstrates that the least-squares adjustment, when based on Helmert's variance component estimates, refinds the weights of the observations more accurately, improves the accuracy of the adjusted coordinates in parcel digitization, and resolves the inconsistencies between the registered areas and digitized areas of the parcels more rigorously.

40|$|In {{this paper}} a least squares-based method is {{proposed}} for adjusting {{the boundaries of}} area objects in a GIS that is designed particularly for solving inconsistencies between the areas of digitized and <b>registered</b> land <b>parcels.</b> The principle {{of this approach is}} taking the size of the registered area of a land parcel as its true value and to adjust the geometric position of the boundaries of the digitized parcel. First, a generic area adjustment model is derived by incorporating the following two categories of constraints: (a) attribute constraint: the size of the true area of the parcel, and (b) geometric constraints: such as, straight lines, right angles and certain distances. Second, the methods used to adjust the areas of the parcels for different cases are presented. Third, the implementation of the proposed model is illustrated using several case studies. The results of the application and the corresponding analysis demonstrate that the proposed approach is able to maintain a consistency between the areas of the digitized and <b>registered</b> <b>parcels.</b> This study has solved {{one of the most critical}} problems in developing a land/cadastral information system, and this solution has been adopted in the processing of real world cadastral data in Shanghai and other cities in China.
