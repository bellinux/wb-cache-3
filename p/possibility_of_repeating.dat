40|$|This paper investigates {{experimentally}} how the endogenous group formation {{combined with}} the <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>repeated</b> interaction impacts cooperation levels and surplus distribution. We developed a Surplus Production Distribution Game where the cooperation of four agents is needed to produce a surplus. In case of cooperation, {{two of the four}} subjects, the distributors, decided how much of surplus each of them wanted to give to the two other agents, the receivers. This game was played repeatedly with different matching procedures. In the Re-match Treatment (RT) the subjects got randomly re-matched every round, while in the Endogenous-match Treatment (ET) a group was maintained as long as its members cooperated. There was also a Base treatment (BT) where cooperation was exogenously enforced. We found that the distributor's contributions were higher in the ET and the RT than in the BT - unsurprisingly, receivers' possibility to refuse cooperation led to more equal surplus distributions. But contrary to commonly hold beliefs, the <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>repeated</b> interaction did not lead to higher cooperation levels and more equal allocations of the surplus. Instead, endogenous group formation {{combined with the}} <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>repeated</b> interaction led to self-selection of the subjects in the ET. The endogenous group duration varied drastically between different groups in the ET, with long-lived groups exhibiting contributions and cooperation levels higher than in the RT, while short-lived groups showed contributions and cooperation levels lower than in the RT. Furthermore, for given contribution levels, receivers were more likely to refuse cooperation when their average relationship length was short. This shows that long-lived groups consisted of generous distributors and not so demanding receivers, while ungenerous distributors and demanding receivers formed short-lived groups. Hence, the <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>repeated</b> interaction does not necessarily increase cooperation and efficiency levels when combined with endogenous group formation. Rather, such a situation might lead to self-selection of agents. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

This issue provides basis in order to estimate {{the thickness}} of the layer by understanding the morphology and the value of the conductivity.

40|$|Abstract: Data Provenance {{refers to}} the lineage of data {{including}} its origin, key events that occur {{over the course of}} its lifecycle, and other details associated with data creation, processing, and archiving. We believe that tracking provenance enables users to share, discover, and reuse the data, thus streamlining collaborative activities, reducing the <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>repeating</b> dead ends, and facilitating learning. It also provides a mechanism to transition from static to active conceptual modeling. The primary goal of our research is to investigate the semantics or meaning of data provenance. We describe the W 7 model that represents different components of provenance and their relationships to each other. We conceptualize provenance as a combination of seven interconnected elements including “what”, “when”, “where”, “how”, “who”, “which ” and “why”. Each of these components may be used to track events that affect data during its lifetime. A homeland security example illustrates how current conceptual models can be extended to embed provenance. ...|$|E

The complexity of the data analyses will be a key factor for finding eventual new phenomena.

Also particularly important is the <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>repeating</b> the determination of the parameters by applying the procedure on several simulated samples, which are generated using Monte Carlo techniques and the knowledge of the probability density functions of the input variables.

40|$|Purpose – This papers aims to {{deal with}} {{enterprise}} networks and clusters dynamics, as well as inter-firm joint efforts and collaborations, in order to study their evolution and possible effects when radical innovation occurs inside them. Design/methodology/approach – In order to study these dynamics, with the optimal balancing among different strategies {{and the importance of}} exogenous parameters in cluster creation, a model is presented. It follows the agent-based paradigm, particularly suited for describing complex social systems in which many parts interact among them. This allows one to create simulations of the studied system, and to test different hypotheses. Besides, it is the only paradigm in which the emergent features of complex systems can arise spontaneously, thanks to the bottom-up design. A model is introduced and described in detail. Findings – Qualitative results are described, reflecting current state-of-the art theories. The results show how clusters emerge and evolve among enterprises, and how radical innovation can trigger this phenomenon. Different managerial behaviour (externally or internally focused) is discussed as well. Originality/value – The most important feature of a model based on agent is the <b>possibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>repeating</b> the experiment several times, by changing one or few variables at a time, by leaving the others unchanged. It constitutes for social sciences the equivalent of lab experiments for such disciplines as physics or chemistry.
