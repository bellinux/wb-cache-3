40|$|Retinal bipolar {{cells are}} known to form a complex, {{interconnecting}} network through electrical synapses that are either heterologous (with amacrine cells) or homologous (with other bipolar cells). These electrical synapses can be functionally as important as chemical synapses because their distinct properties provide a different character for the network. Much less is known, however, about electrical synapses in retinal bipolar cells than about chemical synapses. Here we report the molecular basis for electrical synapses in retinal bipolar cells, particularly <b>ON</b> <b>cone</b> bipolar cells. We have found variable connexin 36 (cx 36) expression in different types of <b>ON</b> <b>cone</b> bipolar cells: cx 36 message was found in some, but not all, <b>ON</b> <b>cone</b> bipolar cells (4 of 14 cells). In one specific type of <b>ON</b> <b>cone</b> bipolar cell (BPGus-GFP), however, cx 36 was detected in 17 of 19 cells. Moreover, we have located cx 36 puncta at the axonal terminals of BPGus-GFP cells, and {{we have found that}} these BPGus-GFP-associated cx 36 puncta always colocalized with AII amacrine cell processes. Molecular and immunocytochemical evidence obtained in this study also shows that connexin 45 (cx 45) is not present in BPGus-GFP cells. Taken together, our results suggest that connexins are expressed in bipolar cells in a neuronal subtype-specific manner and that cx 36 /cx 36 gap junctions form the heterologous electrical synapses between AII amacrine cells and BPGus-GFP cells. Our findings imply that visual information can be differently processed by distinct subtypes of <b>ON</b> <b>cone</b> bipolar cells via electrical synapses...|$|R
