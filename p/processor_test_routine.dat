40|$|Several constant-time {{parallel}} algorithms for {{fault diagnosis}} {{have been given}} for the classical static-fault model. We extend those algorithms to tolerate intermittent faults. 1. Static Fault Diagnosis Imagine a robot surveying a nuclear accident. As it collects data in radioactive hot spots, its processors tend to get fried. Before too many processors fail, the robot retreats to a safe spot in order to heal. During the healing process, the robot’s <b>processors</b> <b>test</b> each other and communicate test results (some correct, some incorrect) to an external controller in a very safe location {{as far as possible}} from the accident. The controller determines which processors are really faulty and sends instructions to deactivate them. Then the robot may return to its mission. The robot’s “healing ” process is called system level fault diagnosis, as proposed initially by Preparata, Metze, and Chien [9]. In their model, when a good <b>processor</b> <b>tests</b> another <b>processor</b> it reports the testee’s status correctly to the controller. But when a faulty <b>processor</b> <b>tests</b> another <b>processor</b> it may report the testee’s status correctly or incorrectly.
