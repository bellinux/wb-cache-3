40|$|In this article, we {{demonstrate}} that planning tasks enhance recall when {{the context of}} <b>planning</b> (<b>a)</b> is self-referential and (b) draws on familiar scenarios represented in episodic memory.

We discuss the implications of these findings for planning tasks and their relation to episodic memory...|$|R
