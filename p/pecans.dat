50|$|Tuber lyonii, {{also known}} as the American Brown Truffle or the <b>Pecan</b> Truffle, is a species of truffle native to North America. The <b>pecan</b> truffle is so named because it is most {{commonly}} found in <b>pecan</b> orchards, in association with the <b>pecan</b> tree, however the <b>pecan</b> is not its only symbiote. Formerly considered nothing more than a nuisance by <b>pecan</b> farmers, the <b>pecan</b> truffle has been gaining in popularity as an edible mushroom in recent years and can fetch over $160 per pound at market.|$|R
50|$|The Elliot <b>Pecan,</b> or Elliott <b>Pecan,</b> is a <b>pecan</b> variety planted predominately in Georgia and Florida.

5|$|The {{indigenous}} {{people of the}} Eastern U.S.A. domesticated numerous crops. Sunflowers, tobacco, varieties of squash and Chenopodium, as well as crops no longer grown, including marsh elder and little barley, were domesticated. Wild foods including wild rice and maple sugar were harvested. The most common varieties of strawberry were domesticated from Eastern North America. Two major crops, <b>pecans</b> and Concord grapes, were utilized extensively in prehistoric times but {{do not appear to}} have been domesticated until the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|Applesauce cake is {{a dessert}} cake {{prepared}} using apple sauce, flour and sugar as main ingredients. Store-bought or homemade applesauce {{may be used}} in its preparation. Additional ingredients include eggs, butter, margarine or oil, raisins and plumped raisins, dates, chopped apple, chopped nuts (such as walnuts and <b>pecans),</b> cocoa powder, and spices such as cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg and allspice. Some versions include dried or fresh, finely grated ginger. After baking, applesauce cake is sometimes topped with an icing, frosting or glaze, such as a caramel glaze. It also may be served topped with a dusting of confectioner's sugar or whipped cream. Gluten-free applesauce cake can be prepared using rice flour.|$|E
5|$|On September 24, the {{southern}} two-thirds of Georgia was declared a disaster by President Bush. The state lost 50percent of its pecan crop due to Frances, {{which led to}} a price rise in <b>pecans</b> by late October. Lost peach trees were expected to lower output during 2005, and increase peach prices. A disaster declaration was made for the northeast section of South Carolina on October 7. On September 10, President Bush declared 34 counties within North Carolina a disaster area, making them eligible for US$6.5million (2004 dollars) in public assistance. A Wildlife Commission removed its North Carolina Mountain State Fair exhibit due to Frances midway through the fair. Over 100,000 trout were lost due to the storm in the Pisgah, Table Rock, Marion, and Armstrong state fish hatcheries. Red Cross volunteers distributed over 200,000 gallons of water by its 600 volunteers in four days. After Frances and Hurricane Ivan, Asheville determined that it needed $14million in order to buy out willing businesses and homes within the floodplain.|$|E
50|$|Cladosporium caryigenum is {{a synonym}} of Fusicladium effusum, the plant {{pathogen}} which causes <b>pecan</b> scab. <b>Pecan</b> scab {{is the most}} economically significant disease of <b>pecan</b> (Carya illinoinensis) in the southeastern United States.

5|$|Trees are {{the source}} of many of the world's best known fleshy fruits. Apples, pears, plums, {{cherries}} and citrus are all grown commercially in temperate climates and a wide range of edible fruits are found in the tropics. Other commercially important fruit include dates, figs and olives. Palm oil is obtained from the fruits of the oil palm (Elaeis guineensis). The fruits of the cocoa tree (Theobroma cacao) are used to make cocoa and chocolate and the berries of coffee trees, Coffea arabica and Coffea canephora, are processed to extract the coffee beans. In many rural areas of the world, fruit is gathered from forest trees for consumption. Many trees bear edible nuts which can loosely be described as being large, oily kernels found inside a hard shell. These include coconuts (Cocos nucifera), Brazil nuts (Bertholletia excelsa), <b>pecans</b> (Carya illinoinensis), hazel nuts (Corylus), almonds (Prunus dulcis), walnuts (Juglans regia), pistachios (Pistacia vera) and many others. They are high in nutritive value and contain high-quality protein, vitamins and minerals as well as dietary fibre. Walnuts are particularly beneficial to health and contain a higher level of antioxidants than do other nuts. A variety of nut oils are extracted by pressing for culinary use; some such as walnut, pistachio and hazelnut oils are prized for their distinctive flavours, but they tend to spoil quickly.|$|E
5|$|Due to the storm's slow {{movement}} just offshore the Louisiana coast, {{the hurricane}} became the wettest tropical cyclone in state history, with numerous locations reporting record rainfall across the state. Of the state's ten highest official rainfall measurements associated with tropical cyclones, the two highest were measurements {{taken during the}} hurricane. Precipitation peaked at 37.5in (953mm) on Miller Island. For any given 20,000mi2 (50,000km/h2) area of Louisiana, the maximum rainfall averaged 12.1in (307.3mm). Thirteen official weather stations in the state reported monthly 24-hour rainfall total records. The highest of these was in Crowley, where 19.76in (501.9mm) of precipitation fell on August9; the station would record 33.71in (856.2mm) of rain {{over the course of}} the storm. The torrential rainfall submerged the city under 2ft (0.6m) of floodwater. In Cameron, the storm dropped 21in (533mm) of rain was reported. In St. Landry Parish, bayous flowed over their banks, causing refugees to evacuate to Opelousas. In the Acadiana region of southern Louisiana, the resulting floods were considered worse than the floods that resulted from the Sauvé's Crevasse in 1927. There, whooping crane populations were severely impacted by the rainfall, and only one was known to be alive by 1947. The floods inundated roughly 2,000,000acres (800,000hectares) of land in Louisiana. Much of the lowland areas remained underwater until October1940. As a result, cotton and corn crops experienced significant losses, as well as <b>pecans.</b> Livestock also saw large losses. Impassable areas caused by rising floodwaters prevented firefighters from extinguishing a fire which burned down much of the Shell Oil Company's offices and supply warehouses in the town of Iowa. Across the state, the hurricane caused $9million in damages, though only six fatalities resulted, relatively less than most storms of similar scale. The low death count was attributed to large evacuation procedures which underwent prior to the storm, as well as guidance provided from the newly opened Weather Bureau east of Lake Charles.|$|E

50|$|<b>Pecan</b> oil is an edible {{pressed oil}} {{extracted}} from the <b>pecan</b> nut. <b>Pecan</b> oil is neutral in flavor and takes on the flavor of whatever seasoning is being used with it. <b>Pecan</b> oil contains 9.5% saturated fat, which is less than in olive oil (13.5%), peanut oil (16.90%) or corn oil (12.70%). It is also used as a massage oil and in aromatherapy applications.|$|R
50|$|The Elliot <b>Pecan</b> is now {{among the}} most popular <b>pecan</b> {{varieties}} in the Southeastern United States. Growers prefer the variety because of its drought tolerance, high level of scab resistance, and consistent nut quality. The Elliot <b>Pecan</b> fetches a premium price from consumers due to the nut's attractive symmetry and exceptional flavor. It is often served with hors d’oeuvres at social functions and weddings. The buttery, hickory taste of the Elliot <b>pecan</b> also makes the nut a popular addition to specialty snacks and desserts, such as <b>pecan</b> pie.|$|R
50|$|It {{is closely}} related to the <b>pecan,</b> sharing similar leaf shape and being {{classified}} in the same section of the genus Carya sect. Apocarya, but unlike the <b>pecan,</b> it does not have edible nuts. It is most readily distinguished from the <b>pecan</b> by the smaller number of leaflets, with many leaves having only 7 leaflets (rarely fewer than 9, and often 11-13, in the <b>pecan).</b> Hybrids with the <b>pecan</b> are known, and named Carya × brownii. A hybrid between the shagbark hickory (C. ovata) is also recognized, and is known as Laney's hickory (Carya ×laneyi).|$|R

40|$|Problem statement: <b>Pecan</b> Weevil is {{a widely}} found pest among <b>pecan</b> trees and these pests are known to cause {{significant}} damage to the <b>pecan</b> trees resulting in enormous annual losses to <b>pecan</b> growers. Traditional identification techniques for <b>pecan</b> weevil include traps with pheromones to detect the infestation of these pests. However, these traditional methods require expensive labor hours to set-up the traps and their monitoring. These techniques are also unreliable for early detection of <b>pecan</b> weevil infestation. Early detection of these pests is essential in minimizing the potential losses to the <b>pecan</b> trees. Approach: In this study, we develop a neural network-based identification system for <b>pecan</b> weevils. The neural networks require 3 - 9 image descriptors as input for successful recognition of <b>pecan</b> weevil. The nine image descriptors originate from standard image processing techniques such as Regional Properties (RP) and Zernike Moments (ZM). For training purposes, a comprehensive database was assembled comprising of 205 images of <b>pecan</b> weevil and 75 other insects commonly found in the same habitat. The networks were trained by two algorithms and several training ratios were studied to investigate the efficacy and robustness of the developed neural networks. Results: The neural networks developed {{in this study are}} capable of 100 % recognition of <b>pecan</b> weevil as well as 100 % recognition of other insects in the database. These recognition rates were achieved by using 75 % of the data for training and using the Scaled Conjugate Gradient (SCG) algorithm and nine image descriptors as input. The average training times for these networks with the SCG algorithm was only 2 - 4 sec. and the testing time for a single image was only 0. 16 sec. Conclusion: The neural network-based <b>pecan</b> weevil identification system developed in this study provides a reliable and robust method to identify <b>pecan</b> weevils and the proposed system should prove useful in designing an automated, wireless sensor network for detecting <b>pecan</b> weevil in the field...|$|R
