40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} whether <b>permanent</b> <b>workers</b> with standard employment that is protected, and casual workers with long-term employment that is not protected but performing the same core jobs, along with <b>permanent</b> <b>workers</b> side-by-side in the same work setting, exhibit different work-related outcomes. Design/methodology/approach – <b>Permanent</b> <b>workers</b> and casual workers holding core jobs with long-term employment responded to the survey questionnaire. Logistic regression was used for the data analysis. Findings – Job satisfaction, procedural justice and work performance were found to be important work-related outcomes that discriminate between <b>permanent</b> and casual <b>workers.</b> Originality/value – Although consequences of different employment arrangements would be of interest to many organisations world wide, on the one hand, little empirical research has compared work-related outcomes of <b>permanent</b> <b>workers</b> with casuals (holding the same core functions with long-term employment) or <b>permanent</b> <b>workers</b> with workers in any form of nonstandard employment arrangement. On the other hand, the literature on the use of labour flexibility strategies is mainly concentrated on developed market economies. If organisations use casual <b>workers</b> alongside <b>permanent</b> <b>workers</b> in core jobs, there is a need for examining implications of such practices.

40|$|Purpose – To {{investigate}} {{the level of}} organizational commitment in agency <b>workers</b> compared with <b>permanent</b> <b>workers</b> by taking into account {{relations between the two}} groups. Design/methodology/approach – A mixed methods design was employed comprising of a quantitative survey of 157 call centre workers followed by 29 qualitative interviews with <b>permanent</b> <b>workers,</b> agency workers and employers. Findings – Agency workers had a significantly lower level of organizational commitment compared with <b>permanent</b> <b>workers</b> once the relation between agency and <b>permanent</b> <b>workers</b> was controlled. Significant correlations were found within the sample between organizational commitment, being valued and job satisfaction further supported by a hierarchical multiple linear regression. Research limitations/implications – As with all cross‐sectional research causality cannot be confirmed and difficulty accessing call centre workers led to a restricted sample size. The measurement of worker relations needs developing. Further research is proposed to address these limitations and extend the findings. Practical implications – The implication for human resource management is that employers must be aware of the possible adverse influence that agency workers may have on <b>permanent</b> <b>workers</b> and as such try to incorporate agency workers within the organization to support their commitment. Originality/value – Previous studies have found inconsistent variations in the relative organizational commitment of permanent and temporary employees; a counter‐intuitive finding given the precarious employment contract held by temporary workers. This study casts light on these results by controlling for the relation between agency <b>workers</b> and <b>permanent</b> <b>workers...</b>|$|R

40|$|My {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} effect of growth of temporary employment on earnings inequality. In the first essay, I find that {{during a time when}} there was a nearly 10 percentage points increase in the share of temporary workers in the Korean labor market (but prior to the global recession), the rise in temporary employment can account for a substantial part (20 - 30 percent) of the growth in overall wage inequality. These results appear to be robust to alternative ways of performing the decomposition, including using the recently developed recentered influence function approach of Firpo, Fortin and Lemieux. In addition, the rise of temporary employment mainly affects the lower-tail of the distribution and fattens the very bottom; female temporary workers in sales and service or doing elementary occupations are the people who suffered from the change the most. In the second essay, joint with Peter Skott, we use an extension of a standard efficiency wage model to explain the wage gap between temporary and <b>permanent</b> <b>workers.</b> Temporary workers have a chance to become permanent; this possibility [...] combined with the existence of an employment rent for <b>permanent</b> <b>workers</b> [...] gives short-term workers an incentive to work hard. Thus, a high wage to <b>permanent</b> <b>workers</b> serves a dual purpose: it affects the effort of both <b>permanent</b> and temporary <b>workers.</b> Applying the model to the Korean experience, we discuss how institutional changes have contributed to increasing earnings inequality. My third essay explores wage effects of the use of temporary employment upon <b>permanent</b> <b>workers</b> 2 ̆ 7 wage. I propose an idea; as temporary employment grows, the fear of job loss is getting higher and the probability of getting a similar job is getting lower for <b>permanent</b> <b>workers.</b> This lower job insecurity tends to lower their bargaining power, and thus their pay level. Using a firm-level panel, I find that wages for <b>permanent</b> <b>workers</b> decrease as the share of temporary workers increases. The analysis also shows that wages for <b>permanent</b> <b>workers</b> in non-union and small/medium-sized firms have greater negative impacts; this helps explain the evolution of inequality in Korea...|$|R
40|$|There is {{a global}} trend of substituting <b>permanent</b> <b>workers</b> by workers on fixed term contracts, job {{outsourcing}} and production subcontracting. Labour institutions and globalisation are often taken to be causally related to this phenomenon, but the evidence remains inconclusive. In India, {{there has been an}} increasing use by firms in the formal manufacturing sector of temporary workers employed through contractors (contract workers) who are not represented by trade unions and do not fall under the purview of the labour laws that are applicable to directly employed workers on long-term contracts (<b>permanent</b> <b>workers).</b> We develop a model of labour demand where firms choose a mix of contract <b>workers</b> and <b>permanent</b> <b>workers</b> rather than <b>permanent</b> <b>workers</b> alone, essentially to counter the bargaining power of <b>permanent</b> <b>workers.</b> Our model predicts that greater import penetration will cause an increase in the employment of contract workers, while greater export orientation will have the opposite effect on contract labour usage. Our model also predicts that greater worker bargaining power will increase contract labour usage. We then test the model using state-industry-year panel data for Indian manufacturing. Consistent with our theoretical model, we find that increased import penetration leads to greater use of contract labour in Indian manufacturing, and that the effect of trade exposure on contract labour usage is stronger in states with pro-worker labour institutions. © 2013 Elsevier B.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} a type of employment contract on starting wage and short-term wage growth. I estimate the differences in starting wage and wage growth patterns between temporary and permanent workers by using a dataset from the Netherlands. The data contain new graduates from post-secondary schools in the Netherlands. As in the continental European countries, the use of temporary employment is common in the Netherlands, especially among young workers. Those who just graduate from school have less experience in the labor market. It is rather difficult for an employer to find a qualified worker. Because of high firing costs for a <b>permanent</b> <b>worker,</b> an employer has to bear more costs if employing an under-qualified worker. To avoid this, an employer engages in a more intensive search processes when hiring a worker on a <b>permanent</b> <b>worker,</b> which increase search costs. If such costs are passed on to a <b>permanent</b> <b>worker,</b> the starting wage is expected to be lower for a <b>permanent</b> <b>worker</b> than a temporary worker. The empirical comparisons of the starting wage shows evidence of a lower starting wage, but this is not robust to differences in estimation structure. The comparison of the wage growth between the two types of contract shows that wage growth is more suppressed for a temporary worker than for a <b>permanent</b> <b>worker.</b> Since the observations are those who have little job experience, training upon employment is important. As a matter of fact, almost all relevant observations receive training at the beginning, regardless of type of contract. Employers could recoup the costs of training by suppressing the wage growth relative to underlying productivity growth. An employer suppresses wage growth more for a temporary worker than a <b>permanent</b> <b>worker</b> as the shorter employment period of a temporary worker leaves the employer with less time to recoup the costs. The empirical results confirm this hypothesis, and these findings are robust. The empirical strategy in this paper takes into consideration the fact that the type of contract is presumably determined endogenously even after controlling for observable individual characteristics. The empirical results indeed indicate that this selectivity issue is necessary to be considered. ...|$|E

However, certain negative effects are associated with unemployment at the career start. Moreover, this effect is larger when the duration of the period of unemployment is longer. Several other hypotheses – about macro-economic effects and about the effects for groups with a weak labour market position – are refuted. Overall, the data show that early career unemployment can work as a trap, but that early career non-standard work can work as a stepping stone towards a better labour market position. ...|$|E

The thesis {{was concerned about the}} job satisfaction of agency workers on two counts. Firstly, what contributed towards the job satisfaction of this unique type of worker? Secondly, what differences in job satisfaction and related variables arise between agency <b>workers</b> and <b>permanent</b> <b>workers?</b> Preliminary research along with a literature review on job satisfaction and agency workers formulated two sets of hypotheses, those variables relating to agency worker job satisfaction (relational hypotheses), and differences between <b>permanent</b> <b>workers</b> and agency workers (differential hypotheses). Both sets of hypotheses were tested by a quantitative survey, which surveyed 96 agency workers for the relational hypotheses and 157 call centre workers for the differential hypotheses. For the differential hypotheses a control group was used to address the possible influence that the employment of agency workers may have on <b>permanent</b> <b>workers</b> that hitherto has not been controlled for in studies of a similar nature.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} government policy to secure jobs in times of recession. In the Netherlands firms can choose to dissolve <b>permanent</b> <b>worker</b> contracts either through court or by requesting special permission from a public employment service. When permission is granted the firm is relieved from the obligation of severance pay. Severance pay lenience for firms in distress is a unique feature of the Dutch labor market. A simple theoretical equilibrium model is presented to study the policy’s effects. The model predicts {{that as long as}} the wage elasticity of labor demand does not exceed the inverse of the replacement ratio a system of severance payment exemption is less costly than the alternative of additional unemployment benefits. The likelihood that this condition holds increases when a firm is hit by a negative shock. A novel data set on individual dismissal cases for the period 2006 - 2009 identifies key differences in procedural durations and firing costs distributions between the two firing options. These differences result from the severance pay exemption policy and form the main reasons to explain the outstanding performance compared to EU countries of the Dutch labor market during the past decade...|$|E

The former objective is obtained by estimating discrete choice models and the latter by estimating a wage growth equation correcting for selectivity bias through the two-step method developed by Trost and Lee (1984). The data are obtained from the second and third waves of the Spanish Household Panel Survey (INE 1996) conducted over the period 1995 – 1996.
