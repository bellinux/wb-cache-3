Upon landfall, the hurricane's forward motion slowed, executing a brief clockwise loop before maintaining an eastward drift. Gradually weakening, the hurricane was only a tropical depression by the afternoon of September29. Two days later, Georges fully dissipated near the Atlantic coast of Florida.|$|E

5|$|By {{the early}} morning hours of August4, the NHC {{upgraded}} Tropical Depression Eight-E to Tropical Storm Felicia, the seventh named storm of the season. Located within an area of low wind shear and high sea surface temperatures, averaging between 28 and 29°C (82 and 84°F), the storm quickly developed, with deep convection <b>persisting</b> around the center of circulation. These conditions were anticipated to persist for at least three days; however, there was an increased amount of uncertainty due to possible interaction with Tropical Storm Enrique. Several hours later, the storm began to undergo rapid intensification, following the formation of an eye. Around 2:00pm PDT (2100UTC), Felicia intensified into a hurricane.|$|E
5|$|Glaciation {{has played}} an {{important}} but incompletely understood role in the park.

Glacial ice that filled Mill Creek (whose canyon is mostly post-glacial), Blue Lake Canyon, Kings Creek Meadows, Flatiron Ridge, Warner Valley and the valley of Manzanita, Hat and Lost Creeks originated from there. Indeed, Lassen Peak appears to be sitting in the depression carved by the Lost Creek Glacier.|$|E
5|$|Later on August 11, {{the center}} of Etau became {{partially}} devoid of convection, with only a narrow band of shower and thunderstorm activity <b>persisting</b> to the southeast of the center.

Early the following day, the JTWC issued their final advisory on Etau as they reported it had weakened to a tropical depression well {{to the east of}} Japan. Roughly 24hours later, the JMA also downgraded the system to a tropical depression. The final advisory on Etau was issued by the JMA early on August14 as it slowly tracked northward.|$|E

5|$|The {{origins of}} Hurricane Jeanne {{were from a}} {{tropical}} wave that moved {{off the coast of}} Africa on September 7. Containing a scattered area of moderate convection, the wave tracked westward at 12–17mph (19–28km/h), located to the south of a large ridge. The system initially showed no signs of development, with unfavorably dry air <b>persisting</b> across the region. On September 11, convection became slightly better organized, and the next day broad cyclonic turning became evident. However, overall development was hindered by upper-level wind shear from Hurricane Ivan in the Caribbean Sea, as well as from an upper-level low {{to the north of the}} wave.|$|E

Two subspecies are recognised, although Tasmanian and southern mainland populations of the southern subspecies xanthanotus may be distinct enough from each other to bring the total to three.

The feathers of the head, neck and underparts are fluffier overall.

5|$|A {{mesoscale}} convective complex, {{or large}} circular area of thunderstorms, {{developed in the}} Ethiopian Highlands of Africa on July28. The complex moved west-southwestward through the continent, waxing and waning until <b>persisting</b> along a tropical wave on August2. The next day, the wave emerged into the Atlantic Ocean from Guinea. Once over the open Atlantic Ocean, the wave quickly developed and became Tropical Depression Three later that day. The depression moved to the west-northwest and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Alberto early on August 4. Alberto continued to strengthen, but moved to cooler waters late on August 5 and weakened briefly. However, the storm strengthened again early on August 6, and it was upgraded to hurricane status as an eye became visible. The upgrade was accompanied with a brief westward turn. However, Alberto continued {{to move to the}} west-northwest later that day, reaching its first peak intensity of 90mph (150km/h) on August 7.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on August 14, 1998. It traveled westward, and on August 19 spawned the tropical depression that eventually became Hurricane Bonnie. The wave continued westward across the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea, and crossed Central America into the eastern Pacific Ocean on August 25. The wave decreased its forward speed while approaching a large low-level circulation over southern Mexico. A broad area of disturbed weather formed in association with the wave and the low-level circulation, and after <b>persisting</b> for several days developed a smaller low-level circulation on August 29 about 575miles (925km) south-southeast of Cabo San Lucas. On August 31, the two primary areas of convection were well-removed from the center. By early on September 1, despite a lack of convective organization, the low-cloud circulation was sufficiently well-defined that the National Hurricane Center designated it as Tropical Depression Ten-E, or the tenth tropical depression of the season, about 350miles (565km) south of Cabo San Lucas. In real time, the National Hurricane Center first upgraded the system 21hours later.|$|E
