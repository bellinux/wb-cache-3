40|$|Purpose. Determination of {{improvement}} ways of admissible speeds of train {{movement on the}} difficult sections of а railroad plan. Methodology. Mathematical modeling of the train traffic is used to achieve the purpose of research. The average weighted speed and elevation of outer rail is predicted on this basis. Findings. The case analysis of the speeds determination in curved sections of track was carried out. The above mentioned track sections adversely affect the ride comfort {{and the intensity of}} the way disorder, as well as the reasons that contribute to the speed limits traffic on the railways of Ukraine. The technique of performing the calculations for determining the <b>permissible</b> train <b>speeds</b> was developed and tested on real curves of railways, were the accelerated movement of trains was introduced. Proposals on automate calculations in distances and services by way of determining the <b>permissible</b> <b>speeds</b> in curves were developed. Originality. Methodology of determining the <b>permissible</b> motion <b>speeds</b> and elevation of outer rails on the difficult sections of the railway plan was developed. This approach allows you to get a rational decisions on reorganization of plan based on local conditions. Practical value.

40|$|Purpose. Studies of {{the effect}} of {{aerodynamic}} pressure on the maximum <b>permissible</b> <b>speeds</b> of a high-speed train on the existing railway infrastructure. Methodology. The study of the magnitude and direction of the aerodynamic pressure, its effect on the maximum speeds of a high-speed train was carried out on a train model composed of axisymmetric bodies with conical forms of head and tail parts. Findings. Determined the values of the aerodynamic pressure at different distances from the train are, when the high-speed train moves at a speed of 200 km/h or more. The maximum speeds of a high-speed train are determined taking into account the state of the infrastructure of the existing railway, ensuring the safe operation of a high-speed railway. Originality. Theoretical studies of aerodynamic pressure from secondary air currents formed during the movement of high-speed trains are performed on a model of a train composed of identical axisymmetric bodies with conical forms of head and tail moving in a compressible medium. The results of the research allow the regularity of the change in aerodynamic pressure during the movement of a high-speed train. Practical value. The obtained results allow to establish: 1) the maximum <b>permissible</b> <b>speeds</b> of a high-speed train taking into account the technical condition of permanent devices and structures of the existing railway infrastructure; 2) technical parameters of individual objects and structural elements of the infrastructure of high-speed iron subjected to the effect of aerodynamic pressure for a given maximum speed of high-speed trains...|$|R

30|$|To better {{explain the}} last issue, we have focused, for example, on the Ancona-Foligno line (circled in {{red in the}} bottom-right map) by {{downloading}} and analysing better the timetable and the schematic plan [38] available on the RFI (Rete Ferroviaria Italiana, i.e. Italian Infrastructure Manager) website. It has been noticed that, despite the corridor is characterized by single-track segments (bottlenecks) with distances between consecutive stations (e.g. Albacina, Genga and Serra S. Quirico) of around 7.5  km and low <b>permissible</b> <b>speeds</b> (max 95  km/h), {{the total number of}} trains indicated in the integrated database ETISPLUS/UNECE is related to the whole corridor. In reality on the specific single-track segments, the number of operating trains is significantly less (around 50 from the analysis of the 2016 timetable); this shows that the corridor, even being ‘weak’ due to its characteristics, is not over-congested.|$|R
40|$|It is {{suitable}} to reduce thickness of circular saw {{when trying to}} enhance usability of wood raw material, but reducing thickness also causes reduction of <b>permissible</b> rotational <b>speed</b> which reduces sawing speed. If one increase circular saw rotational <b>speed</b> over <b>permissible</b> one the quality of machined surfaces will reduce because of enhanced vibrations. <b>Permissible</b> rotational <b>speed</b> can be calculated from critical rotational speed which can be defined from natural frequencies of the saw. In this article critical rotational speeds of standard clamped saws (with flat disk surface and without slots) are calculated by using finite element method and classical theory of thin plates on annular plates. Mode shapes and natural frequencies of annular plates are determined by using Bessel functions and by using polynomial functions. Obtained results suggest that standard clamped circular saws without slots and with relatively small teeth can be determined from classical theory of thin plates for annular plates with accuracy depending on clamping ratio...|$|R

The co-pilot also suggested to wait and orbit for 10 minutes as the cell could be observed to be moving already, but the Captain did not respond to the suggestion. The Captain visually spotted the runway at 12:54.

50|$|The {{station was}} built between 1900 and 1902 {{according}} to a design by Czesław Domaniewski on the broad gauge Warsaw-Kalisz Railway. In 1914 the line rebuilt to standard gauge and in 1916, the line became double track. The section from Błonie to Sochaczew was electrified in 1959 and in 1961 the next section to Kutno was electrified. The electrification of the E20 line was completed in 1988. In 1992 the modernisation of the section Warsaw - Poznan started, with the task to adapt the E20 route to a driving speed of 160 km/h.

2500|$|All lines but the Yellow Line are {{equipped}} with automatic train control. Generally, the train operator does the closing of doors and starts the DA (Départ automatique, automatic departure), and then the train drives itself. The train operator can also drive the train manually {{at his or her}} discretion. Signalling is effected through coded pulses sent through the rails. Coded speed orders and station stop positions transmitted through track beacons are captured by beacon readers mounted under the driver cabs. The information sent to the train's electronic modules conveys speed information, and {{it is up to the}} train automatic control system computer to conform to the imposed speed. Additionally, the train computer can receive energy-saving instructions from track beacons, providing the train with four different economical coasting modes, plus one mode for maximum performance. In case of manual control, track speed is displayed on the cab speedometer indicating the maximum <b>permissible</b> <b>speed.</b> The wayside signals consist of point (switch/turnout) position indicators in proximity to switches and inter-station signalling placed at each station stop. Trains often reach their maximum speed of [...] in 16 to 26 seconds depending on grade and load.|$|E
2500|$|In France, the duplex type {{was made}} famous by the ten 2-4-6-2 (151A) {{compound}} locomotives built in 1932 for the Paris-Lyons-Marseilles company (P.L.M.) to haul heavy freight trains on the 0.8% grade between Les Laumes and Dijon. The performance was so good, the company wanted to order more engines, but the nationalization of the railways in 1938 stopped all projects. These duplex engines were fitted with Lenz-Dabeg rotary cam valve motion and soon thereafter with double exhaust. The low-pressure cylinders drove the first coupled axle, and the high pressure cylinders {{the second set of}} axles.

2500|$|Pilots {{soon learned}} that the Me 262 was quite maneuverable despite its high wing loading and lack of {{low-speed}} thrust, especially if attention was drawn to its effective maneuvering speeds. The controls were light and effective {{right up to the}} maximum <b>permissible</b> <b>speed</b> and perfectly harmonised. The inclusion of full span automatic leading-edge slats, something of a [...] "tradition" [...] on Messerschmitt fighters dating back to the original Bf 109's outer wing slots of a similar type, helped increase the overall lift produced by the wing by as much as 35% in tight turns or at low speeds, greatly improving the aircraft's turn performance as well as its landing and take off characteristics. As many pilots soon found out, the Me 262's clean design also meant that it, like all jets, held its speed in tight turns much better than conventional propeller-driven fighters, which was a great potential advantage in a dogfight as it meant better energy retention in maneuvers. Luftwaffe test pilot and flight instructor Hans Fey stated, [...] "The 262 will turn much better at high than at slow speeds and, due to its clean design, will keep its speed in tight turns much longer than conventional type aircraft." ...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. In this paper, it is {{necessary}} to examine the dynamic properties of the gondola car with bogies, model 18 - 1711 when it moves on straight and curved sections of a track. Methodology. The calculations were performed using the object-oriented programming on the program "Dynamics of Rail Vehicles" ("DYNRAIL" Myamlin S. V. registered 20. 03. 2003). Mathematical models of a gondola car and bogies 18 - 100 and 18 - 711 were created for the calculations. Findings. Dynamic performances comparison of the gondola car with bogies 18 - 1711 and the gondola car with bogies 18 - 100, obtained by calculation method was carried out. Originality. Firstly calculations {{in order to determine the}} dynamic properties of the gondola car with bogies 18 - 1711 when it moves on straight and curved sections of track were performed. At the same time an assessment of the dynamic characteristics of the gondola car was made. The following dynamic standards were determined: the coefficient of vertical dynamics (Cdv), the coefficient of horizontal dynamics (Cdh), and the safety factor against derailment (SFd). Track irregularities in vertical and horizontal transverse planes were assigned as perturbations. They should be so that the dynamic indexes of the widely used in operation gondola car on bogies model 18 - 100 keep in admissible range of speeds up to 80 km / h for the empty gondola car and at speeds up to 90 km / h for the loaded gondola cars. Practical value. As a result of the calculations and comparisons of their results, we have findings that the use of bogies with bilinear characteristic of the central suspension will improve the dynamic performances of gondola cars, currently operating on bogies, model 18 - 100. And by improving the dynamic performances it is possible to increase the <b>permissible</b> <b>speeds</b> of these cars motion...|$|R
50|$|In {{the past}} dive brakes were mostly used on dive bombers, which needed to dive very steeply, but without {{exceeding}} their red line speed, {{in order to}} drop their bombs accurately.

40|$|Ballast is most {{commonly}} used as a structural component of rail track due to its high load bearing capacity, resiliency and rapid drainage. However, ballast along coal freight corridors often becomes fouled due to spilling of coal from moving wagons, in addition to further track deterioration attributed to particle breakage and pumping of soft subgrade. Highly fouled ballast needs to be cleaned or replaced to maintain the desired track resiliency, load bearing capacity and the track alignment. In order to identify the risk associated with fouling, {{it is important to}} accurately assess the amount of fouling. In this paper, the use of Void Contaminant Index (VCI) compared to other mass-based indices is critically examined. A series of isotropically consolidated drained triaxial tests using a large scale cylindrical triaxial apparatus have been conducted on both clean and fouled ballast with varying VCI to assess the stress-strain and degradation characteristics. In accordance, a non-linear shear strength envelope for clean and fouled ballast is presented in a non-dimensional form. The maximum <b>permissible</b> train <b>speed</b> under different level of fouling is also proposed...|$|R

40|$|Purpose. Modern {{scientific}} research has repeatedly cited practical {{examples of the}} dynamic effects of railway track operation that go beyond the static calculation schemes. For the track sections where the train speed is approaching to the velocity of wave propagation in the slab track layers such issues are of particular relevance. An adequate tool {{for the study of}} such issues can be the use of the wave theory of stress propagation. The purpose of the article is the creation of a mathematical description of the basic principles of the stress propagation wave model in the railway track, which {{can be used as a}} basis for the practical development of the relevant calculation system. Methodology. The model of stress-strain states of the railway track on the basis of the stress wave propagation theory is to bring together the equations of the geometry of the outline of the space systems that is involved in the interaction at a given time, and the dynamic equilibrium equations of deformation. The solution is based on the use of the laws of the theory of elasticity. The wave front is described by an ellipsoid equation. When determining the variation in time of the surface position of the ellipsoid a vector approach is used. Findings. The geometry equations of the wave motion determine the volumes of material layers of the slab track involved in the interaction at a given time. The dynamic equilibrium determination of the deformed condition of the space bounded by the wave front makes it possible to calculate both the stresses and strains, and their changes during the time of the load perception. Thus, mathematical descriptions of the processes that occur in the perception of the load by the elements of railway track at high speeds were obtained. Originality. The simulation tasks of the track and rolling stock interaction, in particular taking into account the dynamic deflection of slab track were further developed. For the first time the article presents the basics of the mathematical description of the wave stress propagation model in the railroad track, which can be used to perform practical calculations. Practical value. The obtained data can be used to justify the track construction or establishing appropriate values of <b>permissible</b> <b>speeds</b> for the introduction of train motion with high speeds...|$|R
