5|$|On October20, the {{government}} of Cuba issued {{an appeal to the}} international community for assistance. The Red Cross provided $1.6million to the country, and various departments of the United Nations provided $80,000. The government of Japan sent about $104,000 worth of medical equipment, and Italy sent about $526,000 worth of medical supplies. The Canadian Red Cross donated a water <b>purification</b> <b>unit,</b> and the Spanish Red Cross sent blankets and cots. The German Red Cross also sent mattresses and blankets. The American Red Cross sent 9.5tons of food. Several other countries sent assistance, including the European Commission which sent $750,000 worth of supplies. There were early difficulties in transporting the relief supplies due to fuel shortages. Due to storm damage, 66,881people resided in shelters until their houses were rebuilt, or until they moved elsewhere. By March 1997, most people had returned to their homes, although some did so without a roof. There was a threat for water-borne diseases due to stagnant waters, although no such outbreaks occurred. The storm decreased the supply of the banana crop in 1997, coupled with a drought.|$|E
500|$|On May12, Malagasy Prime Minister Jacques Sylla {{issued an}} appeal to the {{international}} community for assistance. Due to the damage from Manou, the French Red Cross activated its office in Réunion, providing one ton of medicine. The Malagasy Red Cross had pre-positioned emergency supplies earlier in the cyclone season, and after Manou struck, the agency distributed a water <b>purification</b> <b>unit,</b> medicine, and tents to the affected areas. Due to road damage, supplies had to be delivered by boat, which arrived in Vatomandry on May13. The delivery included [...] of supplies. Workers quickly made repairs to power systems. The Malagasy government provided $147,000 to restore health centers in Vatomandry and Andevoranto. Japan provided $80,000 worth of supplies, including tents and jerrycans. Japan, the United States, Norway, and Germany donated about $1.27million to Madagascar for relief. The World Food Programme initially provided 90tons of rice, although ongoing drought conditions and storms caused the agency to continue providing food to residents in southern Madagascar for several months.|$|E
