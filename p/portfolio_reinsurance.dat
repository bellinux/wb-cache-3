40|$|Today’s {{reinsurance}} manager has {{to balance}} many diverging interests. Most prominent {{among these are}} the risk-return objectives of the company owners and the security requirements of the policyholders. Performance measurement issues and {{the sheer number of}} available reinsurance and capital market solutions further complicate the decision-making process. Given the complexity of the problem, it has been our experience that a quantitative approach can help in understanding the risks and the cost of financing them. This leads to more informed decisions. In this article, we guide the reader through the steps of restructuring an existing traditional reinsurance program using quantitative models of the risks. This is done by means of a case study in which concrete insurance lines are analyzed in a sample <b>portfolio.</b> <b>reinsurance,</b> alternative risk transfer, asset liability management, dynamic financial analysis...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} actuarial {{applications of}} modern statistical methods that are ap-plied to detailed, micro-level automobile insurance records. We consider 1993 - 2001 data con-sisting {{of policy and}} claims files from a major Singaporean insurance company. A hierarchical statistical model, developed in prior work Frees and Valdez (2008), is fit using the micro-level data. This model allows us to study the accident frequency, loss type and severity jointly and to incorporate individual characteristics such as age, gender and driving history that explain heterogeneity among policyholders. Based on this hierarchical model, one can analyze the risk profile of either a single policy (micro-level) or a portfolio of business (macro-level). This paper investigates three types of actuarial applications. First, we demonstrate the calculation of the predictive mean of losses for individual risk rating. This allows the actuary to differentiate prices based on policyholder char-acteristics. The nonlinear effects of coverage modifications such as deductibles, policy limits and coinsurance are quantified. Moreover, our flexible structure allows us to “unbundle ” contracts and price more primitive elements of the contract, such as coverage type. The second application concerns the predictive distribution of a portfolio of business. We demonstrate the calculation of various risk measures, including value at risk and conditional tail expectation, that are use-ful in determining economic capital for insurance companies. Third, we {{examine the effects of}} several reinsurance treaties. Specifically, we show the predictive loss distributions for both the insurer and reinsurer under quota share and excess-of-loss reinsurance agreements. In addition, we present an example of <b>portfolio</b> <b>reinsurance,</b> in which the combined effect of reinsurance agreements on the risk characteristics of ceding and reinsuring company are described. ∗Keywords: Long-tail regression, copulas, risk measures, reinsurance...|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{two different}} <b>portfolios</b> of proportional <b>reinsurance</b> {{of the same}} pool of risks. This contribution is concerned with Gaussian-like risks, which means that for large values the survival function of such risks is, up to a multiplier, {{the same as that}} of a standard Gaussian risk. We establish the tail asymptotic behavior of the total loss of each of the <b>reinsurance</b> <b>portfolios</b> and determine also the relation between randomly scaled Gaussian-like portfolios and unscaled ones. Further we show that jointly two portfolios of Gaussian-like risks exhibit asymptotic independence and their weak tail dependence coefficient is non-negative.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how insurance companies participating in delivery of crop insurance would change patterns of <b>portfolio</b> allocation across <b>reinsurance</b> funds {{in reaction to}} the 2005 Standard Reinsurance Agreement. The returns of insurance companies under the SRA are calculated using a simulation model. An heuristic allocation rule is introduced in order to imitate portfolio allocation strategies of participating companies. The main conclusion of the analysis is that the bulk of changes in portfolio allocations are likely to be caused by the introduction of "retained net book quota share" reinsurance rather than adjustments in the cession limits and retention requirements for the Assigned Risk Fund. crop insurance, <b>portfolio</b> allocation strategies, <b>reinsurance</b> funds, Standard Reinsurance Agreement, Risk and Uncertainty,...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn {{parallel}} to the action of States and international organizations, the insurance sector is one {{that contributes to the}} resilience of human societies against the occurrence of natural disasters such as weather events, seismic ones and other ones. The action principle of this sector is characterized by at least three mechanisms: prevention for concerned people, compensation and <b>portfolios</b> <b>reinsurance.</b> The risk of meteor fall is not valued appropriately by this sector yet. However, our planet receives meteors every day, some of which could cause significant damages on urban areas or economic ones (industrial, shopping centres, recreation places etc.). From the analysis of the data concerning the asteroids that have impacted the Earth and which have a likelihood to do so, we present here a methodology to estimate the damages resulting from the impact of objects of sizes up to the maximum threshold for regional damages (a few hundreds of meters) on some given territory. The French territory is chosen as an example because we can describe its area with the appropriate spatial databases (population density, building location etc.). This approach is based on an initial definition phase of collision scenarios. Then, a second phase consists in the accurate modelling of the territory taking into account the land-use, the spatial distribution of insurance company stakes, and the characterization of the biophysical vulnerability of the stakes using thresholds of dangerous phenomena (overpressures, thermal radiations etc.). The third phase is related to the impact simulation on the territory and the estimation of the stakes potentially exposed...|$|R

40|$|Index-based hedging {{instruments}} such as industry loss warranties are increasingly recognized as effective hedging tools for insurance and <b>reinsurance</b> <b>portfolios.</b> However, wider adoption of these instruments is inhibited by basis risk, {{the difference between}} the index-based payoff and the buyer's actual loss.

We examine two measures of basis risk: (i) hedging effectiveness and (ii) conditional payoff shortfall. Many existing measures such as hedge volatility and correlation are special cases of the hedging effectiveness measure. Next, we study the tradeoffbetween basis risk and the cost of hedging. Finally, we present a robust numerical algorithm designed to optimize an index-based hedging program consisting of multiple index-based contracts. 24...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} {{rationale}} for financial reinsurance in the casualty insurance business. As opposed to regular reinsurance, financial reinsurance refers to an investment strategy that uses the financial markets to hedge insurance risk. The casualty insurer takes positions in derivatives on underlying assets whose prices are highly positively or negatively correlated with specific insurance risks. We formulate the asset liability management problem for a mutually owned casualty insurer, {{in the context of}} a dynamic stochastic portfolio selection model. Using numerical studies of the resulting large-scale nonlinear program, we compare properties of optimal portfolios with and without the possibility of financial reinsurance. We let an alleged representative policyholder, endowed with a linear plus negative exponential utility function, evaluate the various optimal portfolios. When policyholders' utility functions exhibit reasonable levels of risk aversion, we find that <b>portfolios</b> reflecting financial <b>reinsurance</b> dominate <b>portfolios</b> that are not financially reinsured...|$|R

40|$|The risk of <b>reinsurance</b> <b>portfolios</b> {{covering}} globally occurring natural catastrophes, such as {{earthquakes and}} hurricanes, is quantified by employing simulations. These simulations are computationally intensive and require {{large amounts of}} data to be processed. The use of many-core hardware accelerators, such as the Intel Xeon Phi and the NVIDIA Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), are desirable for achieving high-performance risk analytics. In this paper, {{we set out to}} investigate how accelerators can be employed in risk analytics, focusing on developing parallel algorithms for Aggregate Risk Analysis, a simulation which computes the Probable Maximum Loss of a portfolio taking both primary and secondary uncertainties into account. The key result is that both hardware accelerators are useful in different contexts; without taking data transfer times into account the Phi had lowest execution times when used independently and the GPU along with a host in a hybrid platform yielded best performance.

40|$|The {{secondary}} market for life insurance has demonstrated spectacular {{growth in the}} past few decades. Although the market has observed less funding since the most recent economic crisis and there have been fewer players in the market during the economic recovery, there are still new participants who are poised to enter the {{secondary market}}. One of the many reasons is that the performance of this asset class is less correlated with the equity market. As most already know, the current form of the market has many inefficiencies, such as high transaction fees, tax disadvantages, and poor control of underwriting risks etc. This research explains the economics behind the policy purchase and focuses on improving the efficiency in the management of a life insurance portfolio in the secondary market, and in turn improving the liquidity and desirability of this asset class. A dynamic valuation technique is proposed in this research which produces a more stable earning pattern. The mortality unlocking approach used in the proposed dynamic valuation also serves as the basis for a proposed reinsurance strategy which can be used to improve the tail risk protection for a <b>portfolio.</b> The proposed <b>reinsurance</b> strategy is designed to help reinsurers better control the longevity risk and allows reinsurers to provide coverage at an affordable price. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{fluctuations}} of {{the foreign}} exchange (FX) rates {{are a source of}} additional risk, but also an opportunity for further profits for internationally operating reinsurers. A DFA model that includes FX rates can be a means for measuring the potential impact of FX rate fluctuations on <b>portfolios</b> of ceded <b>reinsurance</b> and internationally invested assets. Moreover, such a DFA model can also be a means for testing different strategies for managing FX risk. We start by surveying the empirical properties of FX rate data and introduce some simple approaches for generating FX scenarios. We then study the different ways in which reinsurers are exposed to FX risk, and possible strategies for managing these risks. The emphasis is on so-called on-balance sheet currency hedging techniques, i. e. on offsetting FX risks on reinsurance contracts by investing appropriate amounts of money in the respective foreign currency. The theoretical reasonings are accompanied by a DFA study on an international loss portfolio. This study shows that FX fluctuations can {{have an impact on the}} reinsurer's business, and that the optimal strategy may not be a full hedge depending on the type of business and on the economic circumstances.

40|$|Political risk {{insurance}} {{is concerned with}} the risk associated with government intervention and restriction of trade into emerging markets. It may encompass long-term perils (investment related), such as the confiscation, expropriation or nationalization of an infrastructure project in an emerging market or short term perils (export trade related), such as contract frustration, embargo or currency inconvertibility. Today exposure to the political will of a host country is being challenged by economic events blurring the landscape for political risk, which is creating a growing need for better informed econometrics, and advanced analysis of risk vs. reward, as well as a broader interpretation of covered perils and events. The need for reinsurance capacity in Political Risk is higher {{than it has been in}} a decade. However, more and more reinsurers are either restricting the coverage or entirely leaving the practice. This paper proposes an objective reinsurance pricing methodology to assess the risk of writing a large political risk <b>reinsurance</b> <b>portfolio</b> based on country risk ratings, sovereign ceilings, political risk default rates and severity assumptions based on historical data. The paper also incorporates a mechanism to indicate the effects of regional and trade correlations based on the advanced credit modeling. Having such an objective methodology to assess the risk of reinsuring political risk should broaden support from traditional reinsurance markets and attract risk capital from the capital markets...|$|R

S-stable laws in insurance and finance and generalization to nilpotent Lie groups. J. Theoret. Probab. 12 (4), 1089 - 1107], the authors interpreted s-stable motions on the real line as limits of total amount of claims processes (up to a deterministic premium) of a <b>portfolio</b> of excess-of-loss <b>reinsurance</b> contracts and showed that they led to Erlang's model or to Brownian motion. In [Neuenschwander, D., 2000 b. On option pricing in models driven by iterated integrals of Brownian motion. In: Mitt. SAV 2000, Heft 1, pp. 35 - 39], we considered stochastic integrals whose integrand and integrator are both independent Brownian motions, thus modelling a stochastic volatility; as a result we got an analogue of the Black-Scholes formula in this model, confirming a result of Hull and White [Hull, J., White, A., 1987. The pricing of options on assets with stochastic volatility. J. Finance XLII (2), 281 - 300]. In the present paper, {{we will look at}} a common generalization of these processes, namely s-stable motions on the real line perturbed by a stochastic integral whose integrand and integrator are both (not necessarily independent) s-stable motions. The main result will be that if we can observe the distribution of such so-perturbed s-stable motions (together with the values of the perturbing processes) at time t= 1, then we can identify the whole model (including the perturbation) among all models with Lévy processes perturbed by an iterated stochastic integral of two Lévy processes (in the gaussian case) resp. among all models with a compound Poisson process with drift perturbed by an iterated stochastic integral of two compound Poisson processes (in the completely non-gaussian case if the perturbing processes have no drift) without knowing anything about the history or about its distribution during 0...|$|R
