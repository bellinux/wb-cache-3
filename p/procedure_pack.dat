40|$|This study, is {{a result}} of a {{collaboration}} between Uddevalla hospital, Västra Götalandsregionen, and Chalmers University of Technology. The purpose of the study is to designing a new materials supply process of surgical material for the operation clinic at Uddevalla hospital which enables for decreased changeover time between surgeries. The study is conducted at Uddevalla hospital, a hospital which provides elective patient care. The flow of surgical material towards the part of the operation clinic that performs hip surgery is investigated. In order to map out the flow of surgical material towards the operation clinic, the project team follows the material from contamination during surgery, to it being back in the operation clinic storage, sterilised and packed. Data is collected through literature search, and a combination of structured observations and semi-structured interviews at Uddevalla hospital, NÄL hospital, and Mölndal hospital. During the data collection and the description of the current situation at Uddevalla hospital, it is made clear that material handling activities take place at the operation clinic which could be performed elsewhere by other personnel. Further, handling of separate disposable articles is identified as time consuming, and the operation table setting is appointed as the activity that effect the changeover time the most. A new materials supply process is suggested in which the activities operation cart packing and disinfection are externalised from the changeover process at the operation clinic to the central sterilisation department. Further, the project team recommends the introduction of operation table setting rooms. The project team also suggests the introduction of <b>procedure</b> <b>packs,</b> which are packages in which all disposable material needed for a type of surgery are combined in a single package. The new materials supply process, through externalisation of material handling activities, freesup time for the operation clinic personnel, and enables for more patient care, hence reduced changeover time between surgeries. The operation table setting rooms allow the operation table setting to be performed during ongoing surgery. The <b>procedure</b> <b>packs</b> simplify the cart packing by reducing the number of articles to collect, and they speed-up the operation table setting since fewer packages have to be opened. The externalisation of the disinfection process and the operation cart packing require a new ITsystem in which orders can be placed and information sharing between the central sterilisation department and the operation clinic is enabled. To further improve the communication between the two units, it would be beneficial if they could be located on the same floor, which requires a new operation building...|$|R

40|$|Packed columns or air {{stripping}} columns {{are widely}} used for the treatment and removal of Volatile Organic Chemicals (VOC's) or Synthetic Organic Chemicals (SOC's) contaminating ground or surface waters. The applications of such packed towers can be costly unless a proper design is considered.

Trauma patients with liver injury were retrospectively evaluated. The patients who had undergone adequate packing were classified as Group A, and the patients who had undergone inappropriate packing, as Group B. Over a five-year period, nineteen patients underwent perihepatic packing. Thirteen of these patients were referred by other hospitals. Of 13 patients, 9 with inappropriate <b>packing</b> <b>procedure</b> due to insertion of intraabdominal drainage catheter (n= 4) and underpacking (n= 5) were evaluated in Group B, and the others (n= 10) with adequate packing were assessed in Group A. Mean 3 units of blood were transfused in Group A and unpacking procedure was performed in the 24 th hour. Only 3 (30 %) patients required segment resection with homeostasis, and the mortality rate was 20 % (2 / 10 patients). In Group B, 4 patients required repacking in the first 6 hrs. Mean 8 units of blood were transfused until unpacking procedure. The mortality rate was 44 % (4 / 9 patients). The length of intensive care unit stay and requirement of blood transfusion were statistically significantly lower in Group A (p < 0. 05). The mortality rate of this group was also lower. However, the difference between the groups for mortality rates was not statistically significant.

50|$|Other {{advantages}} of monoliths conferred by their individual construction include greater column to column and batch to batch reproducibility. One technique of creating monolith columns is to polymerize the structure in situ. This involves filling the mold or column tubing {{with a mixture}} of monomers, a cross-linking agent, a free-radical initiator, and a porogenic solvent, then initiating the polymerization process under carefully controlled thermal or irradiating conditions. Monolithic in situ polymerization avoids the primary source of column to column variability, which is the <b>packing</b> <b>procedure.</b>|$|R

40|$|A custom pack {{combines}} {{medical disposable}} items {{into a single}} sterile package that is used for surgical <b>procedures.</b> Although custom <b>packs</b> are gaining importance in hospitals due to their potential benefits in reducing surgery setup times, little is known on methodologies to configure them, especially {{if the number of}} medical items, procedure types and surgeons is large. In this paper, we propose a mathematical programming approach to guide hospitals in developing or reconfiguring their custom packs. In particular, we are interested in minimising points of touch, which we define as a measure for physical contact between staff and medical materials. Starting from an integer non-linear programming model, we develop both an exact linear programming (LP) solution approach and an LP-based heuristic. Next, we also describe a simulated annealing approach to benchmark the mathematical programming methods. A computational experiment, based on real data of a medium-sized Belgian hospital, compares the optimised results with the performance of the hospital’s current configuration settings and indicates how to improve future usage. Next to this base case, we introduce scenarios in which we examine to what extent the results are sensitive for waste, i. e. adding more items to the custom pack than is technically required for some of the custom <b>pack’s</b> <b>procedures,</b> since this can increase its applicability towards other procedures.

40|$|Abstract-The {{ability to}} {{manipulate}} previously unseen objects under visual control {{is one of}} the key tasks in the successful implementation of robotic, automated assembly and adaptive material handling systems. The automation of such complex industrial environments will require the development of machine vision systems that are highly adaptable and capable of dealing with a wide range of variable products. An important group of applications of this type is found in the automated packing and nesting of arbitrary shapes. The aim of this work has been to produce an efficient packing strategy that is flexible enough for a wide variety of industrial uses and which can be implemented using fast moderately priced hardware. A systems approach, as distinct from a purely algorithmic one, has been deliberately adopted since the work is concerned with industrial vision applications in which significant problem constraints exist. This paper also outlines the background to this research, and reviews a selection of industrial packing applications. The <b>packing</b> <b>procedure</b> that has been devised, consists of two major components. The first is a geometric packing technique that is based on morphological image processing operations. This is used in conjunction with a Prolog based heuristic <b>packing</b> <b>procedure.</b> Some of the factors considered at the heuristic level include shape ordering and shape orientation, both of which must be carried out prior to the implementation of the geometric packer. The heuristic procedures deal with problem constraints that are specific to a given application. I...|$|R

40|$|Objective The {{syndrome}} {{of inappropriate}} secretion of antidiuretic hormone {{is a rare}} disorder in dogs characterised by hypo-osmolality and persistent arginine vasopressin production {{in the absence of}} hypovolaemia and/or hypotension. The study describes the efficacy and safety of the nonpeptide selective arginine vasopressin V 2 receptor antagonist OPC- 31260 in a dog with the naturally occurring syndrome. Design The detailed case history of a dog with spontaneous syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone that received long-term therapy with oral OPC- 31260 is presented. Effects of the first dose of OPC- 31260 and of a dose administered after a continuous dosing period of 12 days are reported. <b>Procedure</b> <b>Packed</b> cell volume, plasma sodium, total protein, arginine vasopressin, renin activity, atrial natriuretic peptide, urine specific gravity, urine output, heart rate and body weight were monitored for 2 h before, and for 4 h after, the first dose of OPC- 31260. The same parameters plus plasma osmolality and urine osmolality were monitored when an identical dose was administered after 12 days of therapy. Results Oral administration of OPC- 31260 at 3 mg/kg body weight resulted in marked aquaresis with increased urine output and decline in urine specific gravity within 1 h. Corresponding increases in concentrations of plasma sodium, plasma osmolality and plasma renin activity were recorded over a 4 h period. Arginine vasopressin concentration remained inappropriately elevated throughout the study. Results were similar when the trial procedure was repeated after a stabilisation period of 12 days. Long-term therapy with OPC- 31260 at a dose of 3 mg/kg body weight orally every 12 h resulted in good control of clinical signs with no deleterious effects detected during a 3 -year follow-up period. Despite sustained clinical benefits observed in this case, plasma sodium did not normalise with continued administration of the drug. Conclusions Treatment of a dog with naturally occurring syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone with OPC- 31260 at 3 mg/kg body weight orally every 12 h resulted in marked aquaresis and significant palliation of clinical signs with no discernible side-effects detected over a 3 -year period. Thus, OPC- 31260 appears to offer a feasible medical alternative to water restriction for treatment of dogs with syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone. Higher doses of OPC- 31260 may be required to achieve and maintain normal plasma sodium in dogs with this syndrome...|$|R

To match the detection limits of the immunoassay approaches (such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western Blot (WB)), LC columns with narrow inner diameter are preferable. The goal of this work was to establish a simple and low cost slurry <b>packing</b> <b>procedure</b> to obtain 50 µm inner diameter (ID) x 150 mm particle packed nanoLC columns with comparable performance to a 75 µm ID x 150 mm commercial nanoLC column. Slurry packing with 2. 6 µm solid-core reversed phase particles was performed with an in-house made pressure bomb system (< 200 bar). Column efficiency was measured as peak capacity (number of peaks separated in a gradient window, PC), calculated using peptides from tryptic digest of human serum albumin (HSA). To maintain sedimentation of particles, heat or magnetic stirring was needed. 80 / 20 % acetonitrile (ACN) /water as slurry solvent was found to give both the fastest packing and the most efficient columns measured as PC (89 ± 11 at 10 % of the peak height for columns packed with magnetic stirring). Nevertheless, the column performance was quite similar for all slurry solvents and packing approaches. “Pico Frit” column housings from New Objective and two frit-making procedures (polymerization and sintering of silica particles) for standard column housings were compared, but none outperformed the others. The PC of the commercial column packed with the same material as the in-house packed columns, was approximately 30 % higher than the best performing in-house packed column (102 vs 136). However, the retention time repeatability between replicates was equal to the commercial column for most columns packed with 80 / 20 % ACN/water.
