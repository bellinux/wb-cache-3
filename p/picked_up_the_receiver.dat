50|$|The fourth Argentine series added a {{telephone}} {{in the living}} room. This telephone rang {{once a week for}} ten seconds, and <b>the</b> person to <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>receiver</b> was given an order or news from Big Brother (which typically no other housemate could hear). The order could be beneficial or detrimental, but a refused order resulted in nomination for eviction. If nobody <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> call, the whole house would be nominated for eviction.|$|R
60|$|A {{bell rang}} at his elbow, {{and one of}} the {{telephones}} began to tinkle. He <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>receiver</b> and waved them out of the room. Virginia followed her guide upstairs, feeling more and more with every step she took that she was indeed a wanderer in some new and enchanted land of the Arabian Nights.|$|E
5000|$|On 23 July, Republican forces {{captured}} Moscardó's 16-year-old son, Luis. They {{called the}} Alcazar {{on the telephone}} and Moscardó himself <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>receiver.</b> The political officer of the Republican force informed him that unless he surrendered the Alcazar, Luis would be shot. Moscardó asked to speak to his son. He then told Luis, [...] "Commend your soul to God and die like a patriot, shouting 'Long live Christ the King' and 'Long live Spain.'" [...] "That," [...] answered his son, [...] "I can do." [...] Although a legend has grown up that Luis was immediately shot, some historians {{believe that he was}} in fact shot a month later [...] "in reprisal for an air raid".|$|E
50|$|The {{driver of}} the Basingstoke train was {{standing}} by the telephone when his train was pushed forward several feet by the collision. He <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>receiver</b> and spoke to the signalman, informing him of the collision and asking him to call the emergency services. The signalman immediately switched all the signals he could to 'danger', and signalled to the adjacent signal boxes he had an obstruction on the line. However he had no control over automatic signals, and was not able to stop the fourth train. He then called the Clapham Junction station manager and asked him to call the emergency services. The accident had tripped the high-voltage feed to the traction current. The operator in the nearby Raynes Park electrical control room suspected there had been a derailment and re-configured the supply so that the nearby Wimbledon line trains could still run.|$|E
50|$|A hotline is a {{point-to-point}} {{communications link}} {{in which a}} call is automatically directed to the preselected destination without any additional action by the user when the end instrument goes off-hook. An example would be a phone that automatically connects to emergency services on <b>picking</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>receiver.</b> Therefore, dedicated hotline phones do not need a rotary dial or keypad. A hotline can also be called an automatic signaling, ringdown, or off-hook service.|$|R
6000|$|Ting-aling-ling! It was the {{telephone}} in the hall. With a start Walter {{came back to}} earth and the present. He went to answer <b>the</b> call. <b>Picking</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>receiver</b> he called, [...] "Hello." [...] For a moment there was no response, but he caught a sound as of voices and something {{that sounded like a}} laugh. Then over the wire came a rich brogue that caused Walter to nearly drop the 'phone.|$|R
5000|$|Toni is on {{the phone}} with a 16-year-old boy named [...] "Lil Wilson" [...] and hangs when Madea enters. Madea <b>picks</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>receiver</b> and after {{learning}} about how young all of his family gets pregnant, she advises her not to talk to him anymore. She spends the rest of her time with Toni giving her advice about being what she wants to be, not caring about others' opinions of her, as well as giving Toni her interpretations of the Bible, when Toni reveals that she doesn't know how to pray. After leaving the room, she asks Jeremy to teach her about prayer. (Jeremy sing his number at this point) ...|$|R
5000|$|Then Dorothy is {{doling out}} candy to Wheezer {{when the phone}} rings. It's the chain store representatives, who want to {{increase}} their offer. Wheezer <b>picks</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>receiver</b> but does not speak to the representatives, because he is distracted by Dorothy. Thinking she's not giving him enough candy (and therefore not hearing their offer), Wheezer shouts at Dorothy [...] "T'aint enough!", then into the phone, [...] "Call later!" [...] The chain store reps think that [...] "T'aint enough" [...] was also meant for them and they decide to call back. This gag takes place repeatedly through the scene, with the chain store guys increasing their price and finally making a [...] "flat offer of $5,000.00." ...|$|R
50|$|Someone {{knocks on}} the front door. Excited to see Steve, Gail {{opens the door and}} sees it's Allison's boyfriend, Phil Lawver, who stopped by. Phil asks if Allison is around because she {{said she was going to}} come by, and Gail {{responds}} she isn't there. Phil then asks to use the phone to call Allison's house. Phil <b>picks</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>receiver</b> and dials <b>the</b> number but then puts his finger on the receiving end to cancel the call, and then pretends to be on the phone with Allison's mother while pulling out a handkerchief wiping off the phone. Gail looks over and sees him wiping the phone and he looks back at her before dropping the phone on the ground.|$|R
5000|$|On {{board the}} ship, [...] "Mlle. Cookie, Show Boat Star" [...] readies herself for a {{performance}} & blows a kiss to a picture of Captain Buddy; in the next room, the bruiser-villain perfumes himself and similarly blows a kiss, but to a picture of Cookie. Buddy <b>picks</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>receiver</b> of a ship telephone and rings Cookie's room; she <b>picks</b> <b>up,</b> and they exchange kisses. Having spied the event, <b>the</b> bruiser <b>picks</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> phone, blows Cookie a kiss, but receives, instead, a punch in the face. Buddy and Cookie perform a rendition of [...] "Under my Umbrella," [...] after which Buddy introduces, to his pleased crowd, an Aboriginal performer called [...] "Chief Saucer-lip", who, upon the captain's departure, immediately becomes a caricature of Maurice Chevalier, who recites [...] "So I Married the Girl," [...] with a kangaroo at the piano.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> man <b>picks</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> {{telephone}} <b>receiver</b> and dials. We {{only hear}} {{his side of}} the following phone conversations.

50|$|Second, {{the tight}} man bump and run {{technique}} typical of blitz scheme cornerbacks can be defeated with aggressive wide receiver release moves. Once this happens, the cornerback is {{at a disadvantage}} and must regain ground and position quickly to prevent a catch.

5000|$|Upstairs, Angel is {{left alone}} with Cordelia, who confesses that the Powers That Be owed her one. Angel says he doesn't {{understand}} {{and she said she}} got what she wanted. Cordelia tells Angel that she is now on a different path and must leave. She heads out the door but then runs back to Angel, and they kiss passionately. This was their first real kiss, though they did kiss while under a mystical influence in the third season [...] "Waiting in the Wings." [...] A ringing telephone interrupts, and as Angel <b>picks</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>receiver</b> after Cordelia sadly tells him he needs to, Cordelia says, [...] "Oh, and you're welcome."

He hangs <b>up</b> <b>the</b> telephone and says, [...] "Thank you." ...|$|R
40|$|By {{offering}} us a {{voice that}} is both at a distance and inside one's own head, the telephone causes interference in thinking and writing. But despite the multiple telephones that echo in and across Jacques Derrida's work, and specifically his writing to and with Hélène Cixous, it is only since Derrida's death that critical interest in the phone has fully emerged, with work by Royle (2006), Prenowitz (2008), Bennington (2013) and Turner (2014) stressing the value of staying on the line. Engaging with Derrida, however, {{is not simply a}} matter of <b>picking</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>receiver.</b> For <b>the</b> telephone is also, Derrida insists in H. C. for Life (2006), a 'poetico-technical invention', that is, the telephone is 'thought itself'. This paper is about how the telephone 'thinks' Derrida, about how it remembers Derrida, and about how it offers us a line for re-imagining his voice. Bound <b>up</b> with <b>the</b> uncanny mechanisms of the telephone, it invites readers to participate in long-distance calling–listening across species, texts and worlds...|$|R
2500|$|When an {{emergency}} {{happened in the}} pre-dial (or [...] "manual") telephone era, <b>the</b> user simply <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> telephone <b>receiver</b> {{and waited for the}} operator to answer [...] "number, please?"

40|$|The {{ability of}} people to guess who is calling on the {{telephone}} has recently been tested experimentally in more than 850 trials. The results were positive and hugely significant statistically. Participants had four potential callers in distant locations. At {{the beginning of each}} trial, remote from the participant, the experimenter randomly selected one of the callers by the throw of a die, and asked the chosen caller to ring the participant. When the phone rang, the participant guessed who the caller was before <b>picking</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>receiver.</b> By chance, about 25 % of the guesses would have been correct. In fact, on average 42 % were correct. The present experiment was an attempt to replicate previous tests, and was filmed for television. The participant and her callers were all sisters, formerly members of the Nolan Sisters band, popular in Britain in the 1980 s. We conducted 12 trials in which the participant and her callers were 1 km apart. Six out of 12 guesses (50 %) were correct. The results were significant at the p= 0. 05 level...|$|R
50|$|In the {{earliest}} days of telephone technology, prior {{to the development of the}} rotary dial telephone, all telephone calls were operator-assisted. To place a call, the caller was required to <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> telephone <b>receiver,</b> sometimes turn a magneto crank, and wait for the telephone operator to answer. The caller would then ask to be connected to the number they wished to call, and the operator would make the required connection manually, by means of a switchboard.|$|R
50|$|The next morning, the café {{gang and}} some {{resistance}} girls are {{dressed as a}} rowing eight and row down the canal. Meanwhile, colonel Von Strohm, lieutenant Gruber and captain Bertorelli are sitting in a small motorboat nearby and cannot get the motor running. Captain bertorelli then starts pushing the boat, like the gondoliers of Venice. The British airmen are walking down the canal under their tin bath and the British submarine is also there, sending out a mechanical goose. The café gang are soon joined by Michelle and Monsieur Alfonse, in his funeral boat. As the goose is approaching them, it starts ringing. Michelle <b>picks</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>receiver</b> fitted into its back. The submarine captain asks where the airmen are and Michelle says {{they are trying to}} locate them. However, she is forced to hang <b>up</b> when <b>the</b> Germans are approaching. Michelle and Monsieur Alfonse head toward the shore, while the Germans urge the café gang to clear the area, since they are investigating strange occurrences. The submarine crew are wondering what is happening and <b>the</b> captain sends <b>up</b> <b>the</b> periscope - right through the bottom the Germans' boat, which capsizes.|$|R
50|$|Delgado {{then headed}} {{down to the}} first floor where he rang at {{apartment}} 101, again pretending that he needed to call the fire department. The apartment was occupied by four women, Mrs. Berta Gómez, who saved her life by jumping out into the courtyard, as well as students Matilde Rocío González, Mercedes Gamboa, and María Claudia Bermúdez Durán, who were all shot. González, who had already <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> telephone <b>receiver,</b> and Gamboa both died at the scene, while Maria Bermúdez died a few hours later in Hospital San José.|$|R
50|$|One {{timeslot}} (TS16) {{is often}} reserved for signalling purposes, to control call setup and teardown {{according to one}} of several standard telecommunications protocols. This includes channel-associated signaling (CAS) where a set of bits is used to replicate opening and closing the circuit (as if <b>picking</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> telephone <b>receiver</b> and pulsing digits on a rotary phone), or using tone signalling which is passed through on the voice circuits themselves. More recent systems use common-channel signaling (CCS) such Signalling System 7 (SS7) where no timeslot is reserved for signalling purposes, the signalling protocol being transmitted on a different physical channel.|$|R
50|$|In radio reception, {{noise is}} the {{superposition}} of white noise and other disturbing {{influences on the}} signal, caused either by thermal noise and other electronic noise from receiver input circuits or by interference from radiated electromagnetic noise <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> by <b>the</b> <b>receiver's</b> antenna. If no noise were <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> with radio signals, even weak transmissions could be received at virtually any distance by making a radio receiver that was sensitive enough. In practice, this doesn't work, and a point is reached where {{the only way to}} extend the range of a transmission is to increase the transmitter power.|$|R
50|$|In a TOFD system, {{a pair of}} {{ultrasonic}} probes sits {{on opposite}} sides of a weld. One of the probes, the transmitter, emits an ultrasonic pulse that is <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> by <b>the</b> probe on the other side, <b>the</b> <b>receiver.</b> In undamaged pipes, <b>the</b> signals <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> by <b>the</b> <b>receiver</b> probe are from two waves: one that travels along the surface and one that reflects off the far wall. When a crack is present, there is a diffraction of the ultrasonic wave from the tip(s) of the crack. Using the measured time of flight of the pulse, the depth of a crack tips can be calculated automatically by simple trigonometry.|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} a cheap-talk setting that mimics {{the situation where}} an incumbent firm (the sender) is endowed with incentives to understate the true size of the market demand to two potential entrants (<b>the</b> <b>receivers).</b> Although our experimental data reveals that senders' messages convey truthful information and this is <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> by <b>the</b> <b>receivers,</b> this overcommunication (relative to standard theoretical prediction) does not enhance efficient entry levels (and payoffs) to beyond what can be achieved without any communication. The reason is that receivers fail to optimally translate the information received in their entry decision, possibly due to overcautiousness...|$|R
40|$|Voice over IP (VoIP) {{is a key}} {{enabling}} technology for the migration of circuit-switched PSTN architectures to packetbased networks. The problem of spam in VoIP networks has to be solved in real time compared to e-mail systems. Many of the techniques devised for e-mail spam detection rely upon content analysis {{and in the case}} of VoIP it is too late to analyze <b>the</b> media after <b>picking</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>receiver.</b> So we need to stop the spam calls before the telephone rings. From our observation, when it comes to receiving or rejecting a voice call people use social meaning of trust and reputation of the calling party. In this paper, we describe a multi-stage spam filter based on trust, and reputation for detecting the spam. In particular we used closed loop feedback between different stages in deciding if the incoming call is a spam or not. For verifying the concepts, we used a laboratory setup of several thousand soft-phones and a commercial grade proxy server. We verified our filtering mechanisms by simulating the spam calls and measured the accuracy of the filter. Results show that multistage feedback loop fares better than any single stage. Also, the larger the network size, the harder to detect a spam call. Further work includes understanding the behavior of different controlling parameters in trust and reputation calculations and deriving meaningful relationships between them. 1...|$|R
50|$|The {{caretaker}} {{tries to}} telephone the remote cabin, but nobody answers. He tries {{to hide his}} concern, but nobody's fooled. While Takashi takes over trying to ring the cabin, Machiko {{stares out the window}} into the deepening storm. She catches sight of a shadowy figure shambling toward the lodge. A fur-clad young woman named Chika (Akemi Negishi), who lives in a remote village somewhere deep in the mountains. Chika is none too pleased to see so many visitors in the lodge, since the people of her village shun all contact with outsiders. However, the night is so brutal that she has little choice but to join them if she wants to stay warm. There is still no response from the cabin; and the little group is horrified to hear the sound of an avalanche thundering down a nearby slope. The lodge telephone starts ringing. Machiko runs to the phone; but no sooner has she put it up to her ear when she throws it back down again in horror. Through the earpiece comes the sound of screams, followed by a single gunshot. There is a moment of silence. Takashi <b>picks</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>receiver,</b> he hears another agonized scream and the line goes dead. Chika puts her furs back on and slips away, unnoticed by the others.|$|R

50|$|Bearing {{corrections}} {{are transmitted}} to the missile via the Agrion 15 radar and are <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> by <b>the</b> rearward-facing <b>receiver</b> units {{in two of the}} wing pods. The directional nature of <b>the</b> <b>receivers</b> makes jamming <b>the</b> command link difficult. On final approach to the target (about 1000 ft remaining to target), the missile descends to an altitude of around two meters. Its powerful warhead is able to perforate a 40 mm thick steel armoured hull.|$|R
40|$|A {{microwave}} emitter "E" that produces 3 -cm microwaves is fixed in space, and a receiver "R" {{is mounted on}} a rotating platform, as shown in Figure 1. A bar graph of red light-emitting diodes located in front of <b>the</b> <b>receiver</b> provides a graph of length proportional to the intensity of <b>the</b> signal <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> by <b>the</b> <b>receiver.</b> When <b>the</b> <b>receiver</b> is {{directly in front of}} the emitter, the bar graph indicates a strong signal; as <b>the</b> <b>receiver</b> is rotated away from a line {{directly in front of the}} emitter the signal decreases, as indicated in the video by the length of the bar graph.

She <b>picks</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> telephone <b>receiver</b> and pleads for help. Tony tells her not to do anything until he arrives home. When he returns to the flat, he calls the police and sends Margot to bed. Before the police arrive, Tony moves what he thinks is Margot's latchkey from Swann's pocket into her handbag, plants Mark's letter on Swann, and destroys Swann's scarf, replacing it with Margot's own stocking in an attempt to incriminate her.|$|R
50|$|Panels of RAM are {{typically}} {{installed on the}} walls of an EMC test chamber with the tips pointing inward to the chamber. Pyramidal RAM attenuates signal by two effects: scattering and absorption. Scattering can occur both coherently, when reflected waves are in-phase but directed away from <b>the</b> <b>receiver,</b> or incoherently where waves are <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> by <b>the</b> <b>receiver</b> but are out of phase and thus have lower signal strength. This incoherent scattering also occurs within the foam structure, with the suspended carbon particles promoting destructive interference. Internal scattering can result in as much as 10 dB of attenuation. Meanwhile, the pyramid shapes are cut at angles that maximize the number of bounces a wave makes within the structure. With each bounce, the wave loses energy to the foam material and thus exits with lower signal strength.|$|R
30|$|There are {{two types}} of {{acoustic}} trackers: time of flight and phase coherent [113]. The time of flight acoustic trackers has an emitter and at least three <b>receiver</b> pairs. <b>The</b> emitter produces a sound wave which is then <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> by <b>the</b> <b>receivers.</b> <b>The</b> time of flight determines how far each <b>receiver</b> is from <b>the</b> emitter. Then, with triangulation, you can determine the position of the object being tracked. The phase-coherent acoustic tracker uses the same setup as the time of flight tracker. However, instead of using time of flight, the difference in phase is used to determine the distance from the emitter. Acoustic trackers allow for a relatively inexpensive way to track objects. However, the acoustic tracking has issues with line of sight and is easily distorted with acoustic interference from echoes or other noise.|$|R
