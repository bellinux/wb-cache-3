In 1987 he started producing house music in Italy with his brother Marco under the name The Rapino Brothers. It was, however, a song that featured Charlie as MC rather than behind the <b>production</b> <b>desk</b> - Tingo Tango - was to prove a turning point in their career, earning extensive UK radio airplay and a recommendation from Culture Club's Jon Moss for the duo to further their burgeoning profile in London. In 1988/89 The Rapino Brothers moved to the English capital to establish themselves as hit pop producers.|$|E
50|$|The {{second half}} of the series {{primarily}} revolves around Musashino Animation's production of an anime series called The Third Aerial Girls Squad, which is adapted from the manga by Takezō Nogame. With the <b>production</b> <b>desk</b> left severely understaffed, Aoi is promoted to production manager and has to take it upon herself to mentor new production assistants, including Daisuke Hiraoka, who is extremely bitter and jaded. He complicates the production by bringing in unreliable animators and studios for Musashino's outsource work. In addition, Musashino is unable to establish proper communication with Nogame due to his incompetent editor, which stalls production even further. Meanwhile, Ema is promoted to assistant general animation supervisor, Misa finds a new job at a CGI animation studio cooperating with Musashino in its project, and Midori finds a job as Musashino's setting instructor through Aoi. However, Shizuka is turned down while auditioning for one of The Third Aerial Girls Squads characters, which discourages her as she is the only girl in the group unable to participate in the project. As she tries to narrow down the reasons behind Hiraoka's behavior, Aoi learns from Musashino's president Masato Marukawa that the company's predecessor, Musashino Pictures, was the studio that produced Andes Chucky, which gives her resolve to finish the production. Finally, Seiichi is able to have a personal conversation with Nogame about their conflicting views over the anime's ending, and they work out a compromise. This leads to Shizuka being hired to voice a character in the new ending, thus fulfilling the girls' promise of working on an anime together.|$|E

5000|$|A small boom {{in office}} work and <b>desk</b> <b>production</b> {{occurred}} {{at the end of}} the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th with the introduction of smaller and less expensive electrical presses and efficient carbon paper coupled with the general acceptance of the typewriter. Steel desks were introduced to take heavier loads of paper and withstand the pounding meted out on the typewriters. This also gave rise to the Typewriter Desk; a platform, sometimes on wheels and with expandable surface via flaps, that was built to a specific height to make typing easier and more comfortable than when using a standard or traditional desk. The L-shaped desk also became popular, with the [...] "leg" [...] being used as an annex for the typewriter.|$|R

This is where its {{satellite}} headquarters are located, inside the home city of RecordTV, its rival network since Globo's founding in 1965. Nevertheless, its main news shows, such as Jornal Nacional and Fantástico, {{as well as its}} own news channel Globo News, remain broadcast from the main headquarters in Rio de Janeiro. This is where Globo's news headquarters, the Globo Journalism Center (now the Globo News and Sports Broadcasting Center) is located. Rede Globo is part of the Grupo Globo group of companies, a major media conglomerate in Brazil. Its associated companies are: Globo Filmes (motion picture company), Globo International Network (international broadcasting), Globo Marcas (branding and advertising), Globo Video (internet video) and the network's owned and operated stations: Globo Minas (television station at Belo Horizonte), Globo Brasília (television station at Brasília), Globo Nordeste (television station at Recife), Globo Rio de Janeiro (television station at Rio de Janeiro) and Globo São Paulo (television station at São Paulo).|$|R
5000|$|The {{album was}} officially {{released}} on 25 May 2015 by the band's own label Peatbog Records. However, copies were sent a week prior to those pre-ordering the album from the band's website. It was released to very positive reception from critics. Tim Carroll of FolkWorlds said {{the album is}} [...] "at times inspiring, sometimes mysterious and at others disconcerting", adding [...] "this is visceral music that digs itself deep under your skin." [...] Alan Morley of UK Folk Music said the album was [...] "an amazing and delightful piece of work from a top band of adventurous musicians and record producers. Listen this {{with an open mind}} and let the sound flow over you and around you. A sonically stunning album and essential listening." [...] Neil McFadyen of Folk Radio said that [...] "with Calum MacLean at the <b>production</b> <b>desk</b> again, we’re assured of that familiar, joyful affirmation that trad and trance is a marriage made in heaven; but that doesn’t mean it’s more of the same for Peatbog Faeries. Almost twenty years since their first release, Mellowosity, with Blackhouse they’ve proven, yet again, that their music, while staying in the same musical vein that keeps live audiences on their feet (and probably brings them to their knees {{by the end of the}} night), they can still move the music forward, provide a fresh approach, and keep that audience coming back time and again." [...] Simon Jones of Spiral Earth said that [...] "Blackhouse is swagger and sweat, a monumental homage to home, a sumptuous cavalier shot of bravado and experiment, which has undoubtedly assured the Peatbog Faeries individualism and taken them to the borders of lands unknown. Dazzling." ...|$|E
40|$|New {{technology}} has created {{new opportunities for}} journalists working with web TV. Changes in the work processes have led to new professional roles. According {{to the theory of}} media logic such events become news that suits media organizations and working conditions. How does the media logic affect the editorial workflow and how does it affect professional roles? In light of my own experience in various roles in television journalism, I examine how the web TV format shapes the work of journalists. Based on previous research in this area, this thesis also examines the professional role video reporters play and what this new role means in relation to other professional roles in journalism. Previous research shows that the video reporter role offers both opportunities and threats to journalism. (Brännström 2008, Wallace 2009, Nygren & Zuiderveld, 2011, and others). This study, based on participant observation at a web TV editorial desk, shows that the media logic of the format of web TV affects the work process in several ways. First, in terms of how news is produced in the field, and how news is created and re-created from existing material at the <b>production</b> <b>desk.</b> Inasmuch that consumers are increasingly becoming potential producers with cellphone cameras, there is a potential video journalist in every cellphone owner. The pace of work drives journalists to publish at a faster pace, which in turn means less time for reflection. Often the job of the video reporter is to select an in-point and out-point in an interview quickly and publish! This survey also highlights the video reporter’s role in relation to other journalists that work at a web editorial desk. The result shows that {{there is a difference between}} video reporters and writing reporters and also that there are differences within the group of video reporters. The study also provides an insight into the journalistic challenges at hand with new differentiations and combinations of roles in journalism within the field of web TV. In light of the observations derived from the material, one can say that the work of the video reporter at a web TV editorial desk is very much molded into a shape, the shape of practice governing the work, or in other words, the media logic controls what kind of video journalism reporters exercise in the production of online web TV...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: The Belgian {{third-party}} payer {{wishes to}} set reimbursement tariffs {{at a level}} that reflects the costs of orthotic braces. This article aims to calculate production and distribution costs of a prefabricated hard neck and knee brace and to explore whether Belgian tariffs and actual retail prices correspond with estimated costs of these two braces. METHODS: The cost model considered manufacturing costs, general overheads, research and development costs, warehousing costs, profit and distribution margins. Data were gathered from manufacturers, a <b>production</b> site visit, <b>desk</b> research, a decomposition of finished products and stakeholder interviews. The price year was 2007. RESULTS: The cost model estimated a retail price of euro 55 -euro 150 for the neck brace, depending on assumptions. The estimated retail price for the neck brace was lower than the reimbursement tariff of euro 194 and the actual retail price of euro 241. The estimated retail price of euro 331 -euro 694 for the knee brace was lower than the actual retail price of euro 948. CONCLUSIONS: Actual retail prices and reimbursement tariffs for a neck brace and a knee brace exceeded prices based on estimated costs. Therefore, there appears to be scope for reducing tariffs. status: publishe...|$|R
5000|$|Smith {{had over}} forty patents for his inventions with the United States Patent Office. The Smithsonian Institution {{describes}} Smith as having taken the woodworking business from hand tools to mechanized. His business (which he incorporated in 1878 {{under the name}} [...] "H.B. Smith Machine Company") In addition to the woodworking tools which were the staple of his business, he also manufactured the American Star Bicycle. This bicycle differed from others of its time by having a larger back wheel, where the rider sat, and a smaller front wheel for steering. The Star was driven by ratchet drive, had a hand brake and a sprung leather seat. The Star sold for $150 {{at a time when}} the average person earned $500 a year. Not the greatest of commercial successes, it was however fast, and a great stunt bike, winning many track races, endurance rides, and stunt exhibitions, as well as being a great advertising tool for the Smith Machine Co. He also manufactured the first steam-driven vehicle operated in New Jersey, although only one was ever manufactured as he died before it could go into regular <b>production.</b> On his <b>desk</b> at the time of his death was a prototype of an autogiro.|$|R
