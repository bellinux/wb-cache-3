5|$|Meanwhile, in November 2004 {{engineers}} identified {{cracks in}} the terrace supporting the Memorial Gardens, and they were {{closed to the public}} as a <b>potential</b> <b>hazard.</b> Eventually in 2009 work began on renovating the gardens. Lutyens's memorial was dismantled and cleaned, and reassembled at a higher level to be visible from the street; it was also rotated 180° to face City Hall, rather than the market. The terrace was strengthened, and the gardens were landscaped around a new sculpture by Paul de Monchaux on the original site of the memorial.|$|E
5|$|More violent eruptions are {{possible}} only in unique circumstances, {{such as an}} eruption into a lake. Any future eruption {{is most likely to}} affect only a limited area downslope from the volcano. Poisonous substances, such as volcanic gas, includes a variety of substances. These include gases trapped in cavities (vesicles) in volcanic rocks, dissolved or dissoclated gases in magma and lava, or gases emanating directly from lava or indirectly through ground water heated by volcanic action. The volcanic gases that pose the greatest <b>potential</b> <b>hazard</b> to people, animals, agriculture, and property are sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide and hydrogen fluoride. Locally, sulfur dioxide gas can lead to acid rain and air pollution downwind from the volcano.|$|E

5|$|Outer {{space is}} sparsely filled with several dozen types of organic {{molecules}} discovered to date by microwave spectroscopy, blackbody radiation {{left over from}} the big bang and the origin of the universe, and cosmic rays, which include ionized atomic nuclei and various subatomic particles. There is also some gas, plasma and dust, and small meteors.

5|$|Meteorologists use the {{location}} {{of some of the}} jet streams as an aid in weather forecasting. The main commercial relevance of the jet streams is in air travel, as flight time can be dramatically affected by either flying with the flow or against, which results in significant fuel and time cost savings for airlines. Often, the airlines work to fly 'with' the jet stream for this reason. Dynamic North Atlantic Tracks are one example of how airlines and air traffic control work together to accommodate the jet stream and winds aloft that results in the maximum benefit for airlines and other users. Clear-air turbulence, a <b>potential</b> <b>hazard</b> to aircraft passenger safety, is often found in a jet stream's vicinity, but it does not create a substantial alteration on flight times. These are a narrow belt.|$|E
5|$|Volcanic gas {{includes}} {{a variety of}} substances.

The volcanic gases that pose the greatest <b>potential</b> <b>hazard</b> to people, animals, agriculture, and property are sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide and hydrogen fluoride. Locally, sulfur dioxide gas can lead to acid rain and air pollution downwind from the volcano. Globally, large explosive eruptions that inject a tremendous volume of sulfur aerosols into the stratosphere can lead to lower surface temperatures and promote weakening of the Earth's ozone layer. Because carbon dioxide gas is heavier than air, the gas may flow into low-lying areas and collect in the soil. The concentration of carbon dioxide gas in these areas can be lethal to people, animals, and vegetation.|$|E

25|$|A {{closely related}} metric is the San Marino Scale for {{quantifying}} <b>potential</b> <b>hazard</b> of deliberate transmissions from Earth.

The San Marino Scale was first proposed in 2005 and was adopted by the IAA SETI Permanent Study Group in September 2007.|$|E
25|$|A {{synthetic}} ETF has counterparty risk, {{because the}} counterparty is contractually obligated {{to match the}} return on the index. The deal is arranged with collateral posted by the swap counterparty. A <b>potential</b> <b>hazard</b> is that the investment bank offering the ETF might post its own collateral, and that collateral could be of dubious quality. Furthermore, the investment bank could use its own trading desk as counterparty. These types of set-ups are not allowed under the European guidelines, Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (UCITS), so the investor should look for UCITS III-compliant funds.|$|E

Written individualized task analyses, incorporating specific behavioral steps for correcting hazards that participants had failed to remediate during the checklist phase, were used to prompt appropriate responding when necessary. These were subsequently faded to transfer stimulus control to the natural conditions. A multiple probe technique across participants and settings was used. Results indicated that the checklist alone was sufficient to increase appropriate responses {{to many of the}} <b>potential</b> <b>hazards.</b> Individualized task analyses, when needed, resulted in appropriate remediation of all <b>potential</b> <b>hazards.</b> Generalization to untrained <b>potential</b> <b>hazards</b> occurred to some degree for all participants.
