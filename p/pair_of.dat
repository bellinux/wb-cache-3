5|$|A single <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> {{long and}} slender {{antennae}} is present, the segments {{of which are}} relatively few and elongated. They were most probably used as sensory organs, with most segments possessing small setae (bristles). A <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> short lobed structures (possible antennules) are also present, their position corresponding {{to the location of}} the second <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> antennae in modern-day crustaceans. In between them is a small triangular rostral plate with a narrow and sharp central ridge.|$|E
5|$|Biological {{structures}} or sequences {{in different}} taxa are homologous {{if they are}} derived from a common ancestor. Homology thus implies divergent evolution. For example, many insects (such as dragonflies) possess two pairs of flying wings. In beetles, the first <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> wings {{has evolved into a}} <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> hard wing covers, while in Dipteran flies the second <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> wings has evolved into small halteres used for balance.|$|E
5|$|The Ganeshida have a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> small oral lobes and a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> tentacles. The body is {{circular}} {{rather than}} oval in cross-section, and the pharynx extends over the inner {{surfaces of the}} lobes.|$|E
50|$|The colony is {{regarded}} as important {{because of the large}} numbers of birds. A 1988 survey found 70 <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> Phalacrocorax carbo; around 50 <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> Phalacrocorax aristotelis; 5000 to 10,000 <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> Rissa tridactyla; about 600 <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> Uria aalge; 25 <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> Uria lomvia; about 2500 <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> Alca torda; and about 50,000 <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> Fratercula arctica. The 1988 survey also found Sula bassana nests.|$|R
50|$|It has 78 {{chromosomes}} {{in total}} (27 <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> microchromosomes, six <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> medium-sized chromosomes, and six <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> large chromosomes).|$|R
50|$|The Îles Nuageuses, {{including}} Île Clugny, {{have been}} identified as a 240 km2 Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International. At least 25 bird species breed on the islands. Penguins include 7500 <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> gentoos, 35,000 <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> northern rockhoppers and up to 50,000 <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> macaronis. Of albatrosses, there are 1800 <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> black-browed, 7800 <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> grey-headed, 50 <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> Indian yellow-nosed, about five <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> wandering and some light-mantled albatrosses. Other birds breeding on the islands include Antarctic prions, Kerguelen, white-chinned, Wilson's storm and common diving petrels, and black-faced sheathbills. There are also small numbers of northern giant petrels, Kerguelen shags, Eaton's pintails and Kerguelen terns.|$|R
5|$|The abdomen has ten segments, {{each with}} a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> spiracles for respiration. Segment ten bears a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> cerci, a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> anal styles, the anus and the {{external}} genitalia. Males have an aedeagus through which they secrete sperm during copulation and females have spermathecae for storing sperm and an ovipositor through which the ootheca is laid.|$|E
5|$|The {{differences}} between millipedes and centipedes {{are a common}} question from the general public. Both groups of myriapods share similarities, such as long, multi-segmented bodies, many legs, a single <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> antennae, {{and the presence of}} postanntennal organs, but have many differences and distinct evolutionary histories, as the most recent common ancestor of centipedes and millipedes lived around 450 to 475 million years ago in the Silurian. The head alone exemplifies the differences; millipedes have short, elbowed antennae for probing the substrate, a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> robust mandibles and a single <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> maxillae fused into a lip; centipedes have long, threadlike antennae, a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> small mandibles, two pairs of maxillae and a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> large poison claws.|$|E

5000|$|Herons {{traditionally}} breed {{here and}} a mixed colony with spoonbills was formed in 1998. In that year there were 47 <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> great egret (Egretta alba), 33 <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> grey heron (Ardea cinerea), 27 <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> purple heron (Ardea purpurea) and 60 <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> Eurasian spoonbill (Platalea leucorodia).|$|R
50|$|The {{location}} of Bhopal Junction {{is such that}} the trains for almost every Indian state (excluding Himachal, Assam and North East) are available. The station halts five <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> Rajdhani Express, two <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> Garibrath Express, Shatabdi Express, Duronto Express and about 210 <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> express, while 13 <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> passenger trains.|$|R

5|$|A {{solution}} to the minimax path problem between the two opposite corners of a grid graph {{can be used to}} find the weak Fréchet distance between two polygonal chains. Here, each grid graph vertex represents a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> line segments, one from each chain, and the weight of an edge represents the Fréchet distance needed to pass from one <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> segments to another.|$|E
5|$|At {{the tip of}} {{the abdomen}} is a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> long cerci (paired {{appendages}} on rearmost segment), and in females, the ovipositor is cylindrical, long and narrow, smooth and shiny. The femora (third segments) of the back <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> legs are greatly enlarged for jumping. The tibiae (fourth segments) of the hind legs are armed with a number of moveable spurs, the arrangement of which is characteristic of each species. The tibiae of the front legs bear one or more tympani which are used for the reception of sound.|$|E
5000|$|At least 29 {{bird species}} breed on the island, {{which has been}} {{identified}} by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA). It has an exceptionally high density of seabirds, including a million <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> macaroni penguins, 300 <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> black-browed albatrosses, four <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> Salvin's albatrosses (for which {{it is the only}} breeding site in the Indian Ocean) and 30 <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> light-mantled albatrosses, as well as several thousand <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> medium-billed prions and white-chinned petrels.|$|R

5|$|Between {{the head}} and thorax is the {{membranous}} neck or cervix. It comprises a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> lateral cervical sclerites and is composed of both cephalic and thoracic elements. Between {{the head and}} the thorax is a tufted scale called the pronotum. On either side is a shield-like scale called a scapula. In the Noctuoidea, the metathorax is modified with a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> tympanal organs.|$|E
5|$|Chelicerate nervous {{systems are}} based on the {{standard}} arthropod model of a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> nerve cords, each with a ganglion per segment, and a brain formed by fusion of the ganglia just behind the mouth with those ahead of it. If one assume that chelicerates lose the first segment, which bears antennae in other arthropods, chelicerate brains include only one <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> pre-oral ganglia instead of two. However, there is evidence that the first segment is indeed available and bears the cheliceres.|$|E
5|$|Diptera {{have one}} <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> fore wings on the {{mesothorax}} and a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> halteres, or reduced hind wings, on the metathorax. A further adaptation for flight is {{the reduction in}} number of the neural ganglia, and concentration of nerve tissue in the thorax, a feature that is most extreme in the highly derived Muscomorpha infraorder. Some species of flies are exceptional {{in that they are}} secondarily flightless. The only other order of insects bearing a single <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> true, functional wings, in addition to any form of halteres, are the Strepsiptera. In contrast to the flies, the Strepsiptera bear their halteres on the mesothorax and their flight wings on the metathorax. Each of the fly's six legs has a typical insect structure of coxa, trochanter, femur, tibia and tarsus, with the tarsus in most instances being subdivided into five tarsomeres. At the tip of the limb is a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> claws, and between these are cushion-like structures known as pulvilli which provide adhesion.|$|E

5|$|During the Evacuation of Greece, Formidable {{provided}} {{air cover}} for Convoy GA-15 on 29 April. A Fulmar from 803 Squadron {{was forced to}} ditch on 2 May before the carrier returned to Alexandria the next day. She put to sea on 6 May to provide air cover for the convoys involved in Operation Tiger. On the morning of 8 May, a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> Fulmars claimed to have shot down a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> Z.1007s searching for the fleet; one Fulmar failed to return. Later that afternoon, the fighters shot down four German Heinkel He 111 bombers {{at the cost of}} one Fulmar forced to crash-land. Two Albacores and a Fulmar crashed due to non-combat causes during the day. The next day a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> Fulmars from 806 Squadron badly damaged a Ju 88 reconnaissance bomber that crash-landed at its base in Sicily. As the fleet and the Tiger convoy approached Alexandria on 11 May, a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> Fulmars attacked a formation of Ju 88s, damaging one bomber; one Fulmar and another Ju 88 were seen falling together towards the sea. Many of the Fulmars had been rendered unserviceable during the operation and Formidable was unable to provide air cover until they were repaired.|$|E
