30|$|Exercise is {{considered}} {{an important component of}} a healthy lifestyle but there remains controversy on effects of exercise on non-exercise physical activity (PA). The present study examined the prospective association of aerobic and resistance exercise with total daily energy <b>expenditure</b> and <b>PA</b> in previously sedentary, young men. Nine men (27.0  ±  3.3  years) completed two 16 -week exercise programs (3 exercise sessions per week) of aerobic and resistance exercise separated by a minimum of 6  weeks in random order. Energy <b>expenditure</b> and <b>PA</b> were measured with the SenseWear Mini Armband prior to each intervention as well as during week 1, week 8 and week 16 of the aerobic and resistance exercise program. Body composition was measured via dual x-ray absorptiometry. Body composition did not change in response to either exercise intervention. Total daily energy expenditure on exercise days increased by 443  ±  126  kcal/d and 239  ±  152  kcal/d for aerobic and resistance exercise, respectively (p <  0.01). Non-exercise moderate-to-vigorous PA, however, decreased on aerobic exercise days (− 148  ±  161  kcal/d; p =  0.03). There was no change in total daily energy <b>expenditure</b> and <b>PA</b> on non-exercise days with aerobic exercise while resistance exercise was associated with an increase in moderate-to-vigorous PA during non-exercise days (216  ±  178  kcal/d, p =  0.01). Results of the present study suggest a compensatory reduction in PA in response to aerobic exercise. Resistance exercise, on the other hand, appears to facilitate non-exercise PA, particularly on non-exercise days, which may lead to more sustainable adaptations in response to an exercise program.|$|R

Budgetary discipline can be achieved by commitment to numerical targets, or by procedural strategic dominance of a party that is sympathetic to the efficient use of public resources (like a Minister of Finance on the national level). As for the ED-budget, at this moment a range of numerical targets is used, such as the VAT-call-up-rate and -ceiling, the own resources ceiling, and the agricultural guideline. As a result of Agenda 2000 these targets have been supplemented by rules concerning the structural policies, and regarding <b>pre-accession</b> and accession <b>expenditure.</b> In addition to these numerical rules, various procedural rules are used, mostly relating to the division of budgetary competence between Commission, Council, and Parliament, in stead of rules that institute strategic dominance of one of these parties.

Less is known regarding the association between PA level and HRQL among healthy adults. Our objective was to analyse the relationship between PA level and HRQL among a sample of 573 employees aged 20 - 68 taking part in a workplace intervention to promote PA. Measures included HRQL (using a single item) and PA (i. e. Godin Leisure-Time Questionnaire). The Modified Canadian Aerobic Fitness Test (MCAFT) was also completed by 10 % of the employees. MET-minute scores (assessing energy expenditure over one week) were compared across HRQL categories using ANOVA. A multiple linear regression analysis was conducted to further examine the relationship between HRQL and PA, controlling for potential covariates. Participants in the higher health status categories were found to report higher levels of energy expenditure (one-way ANOVA, p < 0. 001). In the multiple linear regression model, each unit increase in health status level translated in a mean increase of 356 MET-minutes in energy expenditure (p < 0. 001). This single-item assessment of health status explained six {{percent of the variance in}} energy expenditure.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To explore {{physical}} activity (PA) in adolescents with {{juvenile idiopathic arthritis}} (JIA) compared with a healthy population and to examine associations between PA and disease-related factors. METHODS: Total energy expenditure (TEE), activity-related energy <b>expenditure</b> (AEE), <b>PA</b> level, and PA pattern were assessed with a 3 -day activity diary. Aerobic capacity was assessed using a Symptom Limited Bicycle Ergometry test. Functional ability was assessed with the Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire. Disease activity was assessed using Paediatric Rheumatology International Trials Organisation core set criteria. Overall well-being was measured using a visual analog scale, and time since diagnosis was assessed by retrospective study from patients' charts. We used a cross-sectional study design. Reference {{data were collected from}} healthy Dutch secondary school children. RESULTS: Thirty patients and 106 controls were included (mean +/- SD age 17. 0 +/- 0. 6 and 16. 7 +/- 0. 9 years, respectively). TEE, AEE, and PA level were significantly lower in the JIA group. The JIA group spent more time in bed and less time on moderate to vigorous PA. Only 23 % of the JIA patients met public health recommendations to perform >/= 1 hour daily moderate to vigorous PA compared with 66 % in the reference group. Higher PA was associated with higher levels of well-being and maximal oxygen consumption. CONCLUSION: Adolescents with JIA have low PA levels and are at risk of losing the benefits of PA. Low PA is not related to disease activity, and control over the disease does not restore previous PA levels.

Then, type {{and duration of}} each activity undertaken during the past week were estimated. Total energy expenditure (TEE) estimated by the PAFQ was compared with data derived from two criterion methods: heart-rate monitoring (HRM) and a 24 h PA recall (24 h-R), both collected during a 3 d period including one weekday and two weekend days. Setting: Two elementary schools and two high schools of the most developed and urbanized area, Greater Tunis.

A total of 164 randomly selected office employees, out of which 97 (52 females and 45 males) from one mobile company and 67 (37 females and 30 males) from a bank, participated in this study. An Albanian modified and adapted version of the an International Physical Activity Questionnaire was used to assess some indicators dealing with all kinds of PA jobs, everyday life and leisure and time <b>expenditure</b> on <b>PAs</b> of different intensity. The weekly activity level was measured through time, frequency and intensity, expressed in MET*minute/week. The subjects were classified in 3 main PA categories: HIGH (1500 - 3000 MET*min), MODERATE (600 - 1300 MET*min) and LOW (< 600 MET*min). The results show that both groups declared an average PA Level classified under the LOW category. The values of the mobile company group was around 950 MET*min with a difference between the genders of 280 MET*min (1070 in males and 790 in females); while the bank group revealed lower values, i. e. 890 MET*min as average and a difference of 220 MET*min between the two genders (980 in males against 760 of females). The {{differences between the two groups}} under investigation can be explained through various factors such as the general PA gender differences, type of sedentary work, type of different work position/role and working spaces.

Patients with {{juvenile}} idiopathic arthritis (JIA) {{are less}} physically active than healthy peers. Therefore, we developed an Internet-based intervention to improve physical activity (PA). The {{aim of this study}} was to examine the effectiveness of the program in improving PA. Methods. PA was determined by activity-related energy <b>expenditure,</b> <b>PA</b> level, time spent on moderate to vigorous PA, and the number of days with > 1 hour of moderate to vigorous activity, and was assessed with a 7 -day activity diary. Aerobic exercise capacity was assessed by means of a Bruce treadmill test and was recorded as maximum endurance time. Disease activity was assessed by using the JIA core set. Adherence was electronically monitored. Results. Of 59 patients, 33 eligible patients were included and randomized in an intervention (n _ 17, mean _ SD age 10. 6 _ 1. 5 years) or control waiting-list group (n _ 16, mean _ SD age 10. 8 _ 1. 4 years). All patients completed baseline and T 1 testing. PA significantly improved in both groups. Maximum endurance time significantly improved in the intervention group but not in the control group. In a subgroup analysis for patients with low PA (intervention: n _ 7, control: n _ 5), PA improved in the intervention group but not in the control group. The intervention was safe, feasible, and showed a good adherence. Conclusion. An Internet-based program for children with JIA ages 8 – 12 years directed at promoting PA in daily life effectively improves PA in those patients with low PA levels. It is also able to improve endurance and it is safe, feasible, and has good adherence. INTRODUCTION Children and adolescents with {{juvenile idiopathic arthritis}} (JIA) have reduced aerobic and anaerobic exercise capacity (1 – 3). There is also evidence that they are less physically active as compared with healthy peers (4, 5). As a result, they may perceive difficulties in joining regular sport activities and in social interaction. It is unclear if this is the cause of the low exercise capacity or the result of it. Physical activity (PA) and physical fitness are interrelated (6). PA can be described as all leisure and non-leisure body movements resulting in an increased energy output from the resting condition (7). To become and remain physically fit, it is necessary to become physically active and to adopt and maintain a physically active lifestyle (8). Evidence is accumulating that PA is effective in the primary and secondary prevention of several chronic conditions (9 – 11). PA is also associated with a reduction in all-cause mortality (11). There is evidence that in youth ages 6 – 16 years, PA controls body weight; reduces blood pressure in hypertensive youth; improves aerobic capacity, muscular strength, endurance, and skeletal health; reduces anxiety and depression; and improves self-concept (12). PA also has a positive effect on academic performance, concentration, memory, and classroom behavior (12). For children with JIA and other chronic diseases, it is recognized that they could take advantage of the same health benefits (13, 14). Evidence supports the fact that PA. 1 Otto T. H. M.

40|$|This study {{examines}} the associations of socioeconomic status (SES) with intensity {{of different types}} of physical activity (PA) in Chinese adults, aimed at outlining and projecting socioeconomic disparities in PA among the population undergoing a rapid nutrition transition. A community-based survey was conducted among 3, 567 residents aged 30 - 65 years old in Jiaxing, China, in 2010. SES and PA were assessed by a structured questionnaire. SES was assessed as socioeconomic index (SEI) score based on self-reported educational attainment, household income and occupation. Metabolic equivalents (METs) were calculated for each subject to quantify the total amount of PA from occupation, exercise, transportation and housework. Intensity of overall PA in this population was 165 MET-hours/week, in which energy <b>expenditure</b> in occupational <b>PA</b> accounted for 82 %. Both types and intensity of PA were significantly different by SES: middle SES groups had higher intensity of occupational activities; lower SES subjects engaged in more household work; whereas higher SES subjects were more likely to exercise, more active during commuting and had longer sedentary time. All the three components of SES, education attainment, income and occupation, contributed to socioeconomic disparities in PA in this population. Our results suggest an overall insufficiency and socioeconomic inequalities in PA among Chinese adults in Jiaxing, a typical city experiencing a rapid urbanization in China. There is an urgent need to promote leisure-time activities in this population...|$|R
40|$|In {{countries}} where {{local governments are}} heavily involved in financing {{health care for the}} indigent, regional disparities in local revenues may adversely affect the access of the poor to medical care. It is thus important to examine how central governments provide funds for such local medical needs. In Japan, local governments finance all medical costs for the poor through their Public Assistance (PA) programs. Using the unique mechanism of the Japanese system of central grants, I construct a measure of "transfer deficit" which shows the portion of the <b>PA</b> <b>expenditures</b> that fails to be secured by the central grants. The distribution of such a measure provides important information to assess the regional equity in financing local programs. The results suggest a compromise on the regional equity in financing medical care for the indigent. Then, I explore the determinants of the deficit measure by performing a quantile regression analysis. Since no effects of potential determinants imply that the central grants well accommodate changes in local needs, finding such effects helps evaluate the performance of the transfer system. The results shows that, among others, the number of PA households and the factors related to mental illness of PA recipients have positive impacts that attenuate toward the top of the conditional quantile of the transfer deficit. I will elaborate on plausible causes of such attenuating responses...|$|R
30|$|Results of {{the present}} study also {{indicate}} that higher cardiorespiratory fitness is associated with smaller compensatory adaptations in response to exercise. This has been attributed to a higher exercise tolerance, which would mitigate the negative effects of exercise on non-exercise PA (Donnelly and Smith 2005). Less discomfort during the exercise and faster recovery post-exercise may further contribute to higher non-exercise PA. Higher fitness levels are also associated with a better coupling of energy intake and energy expenditure (Cook and Schoeller 2011), which facilitates maintenance of energy balance. Further, there is evidence for an increase in energy intake in response to exercise interventions, which has been used to explain the smaller than anticipated weight loss observed in most exercise interventions (Blundell et al. 2015; Hopkins et al. 2014). A smaller energy gap in response to an exercise intervention, however, could allow for less pronounced changes in non-exercise PA. Unfortunately, the small sample size {{of the present}} study did not allow to statistically test for differences in compensatory adaptations by fitness level or by improvement in fitness. Similarly, {{it was not possible to}} examine participants separately by change in energy balance or change in body composition. While the small sample size certainly limits generalizability of the results, the strong adherence to the exercise protocol and the fact that all exercise sessions were supervised is a considerable strength of the study. In addition, compliance with the measurement protocol was high as indicated by weartime of the activity monitors. Using multiple time points also allowed for an evaluation of change in energy <b>expenditure</b> and <b>PA</b> throughout a 16 -week exercise period, rather than only comparing pre- and post-intervention measurements. Further, the differentiation between exercise and non-exercise days provided new insights into the association between exercise and non-exercise PA in previously sedentary adults. Future studies, however, should track motivation to exercise and exercise intensity more closely throughout the intervention period, as participants tended to work at the lower end of their respective exercise intensity towards the end of the intervention, particularly during resistance exercise. This problem may also be addressed by including strength related measures, such as an assessment of grip strength and 1 -repetition maximum for the various exercises in addition to the assessment of aerobic capacity.|$|R

The intervention consisted of six educational sessions for each of the following: physical activity (PA), healthy nutrition, prevention of tobacco smoking, prevention of substance abuse, bone health, and sun protection. Both groups were assessed before and after the intervention in weight measurements, physical fitness, PA by accelerometry in a subsample, and self-reported behaviours. The self-reported behaviours included PA, dietary behaviours, tobacco smoking, substance abuse, and sun exposure and protection. In addition, the knowledge of each health topic was assessed immediately before the session and a week after. A mixed model repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used for analysis following an intention-to-treat approach. Results: Physical fitness including flexibility, abdominal muscles strength, body balance and cardiorespiratory endurance (VO 2 max) were significantly improved in the intervention group compared to the control group. The intervention group also had significantly increased energy <b>expenditure,</b> light <b>PA,</b> walking time, moderate PA, and moderate-to-vigorous PA, while had decreased sedentary time and elevator use. They also had improved a range of dietary practices by increasing consumption of breakfast, dairy, and water. Furthermore, their health knowledge of each topic was significantly increased. Weight measurements did not show any significant change. Tobacco smoking and substance abuse were scarcely reported which could be due to cultural sensitivity. Conclusion: A health promotion intervention in school was successful in increasing physical activity and physical fitness, and improving dietary practices in adolescent females in Kuwait. Thus, such interventions are promising and should be invested in and expanded in this population. These interventions should also be supported by socio-environmental changes including families, youth organisations, and health policies...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{develop and}} {{validate}} a short questionnaire to estimate physical activity (PA) practice and sedentary behavior for the adult population. METHODS: The short questionnaire was developed {{using data from}} a cross-sectional population-based survey (n = 6352) that included the Minnesota leisure-time PA questionnaire. Activities that explained {{a significant proportion of}} the variability of population PA practice were identified. Validation of the short questionnaire included a cross-sectional component to assess validity with respect to the data collected by accelerometers and a longitudinal component to assess reliability and sensitivity to detect changes (n = 114, aged 35 to 74 years). RESULTS: Six types of activities that accounted for 87 % of population variability in PA estimated with the Minnesota questionnaire were selected. The short questionnaire estimates energy <b>expenditure</b> in total <b>PA</b> and by intensity (light, moderate, vigorous), and includes 2 questions about sedentary behavior and a question about occupational PA. The short questionnaire showed high reliability, with intraclass correlation coefficients ranging between 0. 79 to 0. 95. The Spearman correlation coefficients between estimated energy expenditure obtained with the questionnaire and the number of steps detected by the accelerometer were as follows: 0. 36 for total PA, 0. 40 for moderate intensity, and 0. 26 for vigorous intensity. The questionnaire was sensitive to detect changes in moderate and vigorous PA (correlation coefficients ranging from 0. 26 to 0. 34). CONCLUSION: The REGICOR short questionnaire is reliable, valid, and sensitive to detect changes in moderate and vigorous PA. This questionnaire could be used in daily clinical practice and epidemiological studies...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Physical {{inactivity}} {{increases the}} risk of obesity, but the relations between reported levels of physical activity (PA) and measures of body fatness (BF) in children are remarkably inconsistent. OBJECTIVE: We examined the relation between objective measures of PA and body-composition indexes in nonobese children. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study was conducted in 100 children aged 6 - 8 y who were recruited according to their risk of future obesity: high-risk children had >/= 1 obese parent [body mass index (BMI; in kg/m(2)) : > 30] and low-risk children had 2 nonobese biological parents (BMI: < 30). Free-living activity energy <b>expenditure</b> (AEE) and <b>PA</b> level were calculated from 7 -d doubly labeled water measurements, time spent in light-intensity activity was assessed by heart rate monitoring, and body composition was determined from isotopic dilution. To adjust for body size, fat mass and fat-free mass were normalized for height and expressed as fat mass index (FMI) and lean mass index (LMI), respectively. RESULTS: High-risk children had significantly higher BMI, LMI, and FMI than did low-risk children, but no group differences in PA were found. AEE and PA level were positively associated with LMI and, after adjustment for sex and fat-free mass, negatively associated with FMI but not with BMI. Boys who spent more than the median time in light-intensity activities had significantly higher FMI than did less sedentary boys. This difference was not observed in girls. CONCLUSIONS: AEE and PA level were negatively associated with BF in nonobese children. Accurate measures of body composition are essential to appropriate assessment of relations between PA and obesity risk...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{describe}} {{physical activity}} (PA) and sedentary behavior (SB) patterns {{before and during}} pregnancy among Chinese, Malay and Indian women. In addition, to investigate determinants of change in PA and SB during pregnancy. METHODS: The Growing Up in Singapore Towards healthy Outcomes cohort recruited first trimester pregnant women. PA and SB (sitting time and television time) before and during pregnancy were assessed {{as a part of}} an interview questionnaire at weeks 26 - 28 gestational clinic visit. Total energy <b>expenditure</b> (TEE) on <b>PA</b> and time in SB were calculated. Determinants of change in PA and SB were investigated using multiple logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: PA and SB questions were answered by 94 % (n = 1171) of total recruited subjects. A significant reduction in TEE was observed from before to during pregnancy [median 1746. 0 - 1039. 5 metabolic equivalent task (MET) min/week, p < 0. 001]. The proportion of women insufficiently active (< 600 MET-min/week) increased from 19. 0 to 34. 1 % (p < 0. 001). Similarly, sitting time (median 56. 0 - 63. 0 h/week, p < 0. 001) and television time (mean 16. 1 - 16. 7 h/week, p = 0. 01) increased. Women with higher household income, lower level of perceived health, nausea/vomiting during pregnancy and higher level of pre-pregnancy PA were more likely to reduce PA. Women with children were less likely to reduce PA. Women reporting nausea/vomiting and lower level of pre-pregnancy sitting time were more likely to increase sitting time. CONCLUSIONS FOR PRACTICE: Participants substantially reduced PA and increased SB by 26 - 28 weeks of pregnancy. Further research is needed to better understand determinants of change in PA and SB and develop effective health promotion strategies. <br/...|$|R
40|$|Background: Optimal dose of {{physical}} activity {{in the prevention of}} atherosclerosis remains unclear. The {{purpose of the study was}} to investigate the influence of leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) on selected indices of atherosclerosis in the working-age population of men. Materials and Methods: The study was carried out in a cohort of asymptomatic men participating in follow-up examinations in the Healthy Men Clinic, Medical University of Lodz. Of the 132 men who responded to the invitation to participate in this study, 101 men were eligible for the non-invasive assessment of subclinical atherosclerosis indices. Self-reported PA was assessed by interviewer-administered validated questionnaires. During the latest follow-up subclinical atherosclerosis was measured by assessing the coronary artery calcification (CAC), the carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) and the reactive hyperemia index (RHI) using peripheral arterial tonometry (EndoPAT 2000). Results: Preliminary results have been elaborated in the group of 60 men (mean age: 61. 3 ± 8. 85 years). The participants were predominantly white collar workers with low occupational LTPA. The cohort was divided into 3 groups according to the LTPA level. Both dose and energy <b>expenditure</b> of recreational <b>PA</b> significantly correlated with CA, IMT and RHI in the whole cohort. The majority of men maintained their baseline PA throughout the observation period. Men with the highest LTPA level had significantly lower mean CAC, IMT (p < 0. 01), and significantly higher mean RHI (p < 0. 05) compared to the least active group. On final examination men with high PA had also the most favorable cardiovascular profile. Conclusions: The preliminary results indicate the protective effect of high LTPA level in the context of subclinical atherosclerosis in men. Med Pr 2013; 64 (6) : 785 – 79...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Patients with {{juvenile}} idiopathic arthritis (JIA) {{are less}} physically active than healthy peers. Therefore we developed an internet-based intervention to improve physical activity (PA). The aim {{of the study was}} to examine the effectiveness of the program in improving PA. Relevance: Evidence is accumulating that PA is effective in the primary and secondary prevention of several chronic conditions. PA is also associated with a reduction in all-cause mortality. There is evidence that in youth aged 6 - 16 years, PA controls body weight, reduces blood pressure in hypertensive youth, improves aerobic capacity, muscular strength, endurance and skeletal health, reduces anxiety and depression and improves self concept. PA also has a positive effect on academic performance, concentration, memory and classroom behavior. For children with JIA and other chronic diseases it is recognized that they could take advantage of the same health benefits. Participants: All patients with JIA, registered in the University Medical Center Groningen, the Netherlands and aged 8 - 12 years, were selected for this study. Inclusion criteria were a diagnosis of JIA, a good comprehension of the Dutch language and the availability of a home-based computer with an internet connection. Methods: PA was determined by activity-related energy <b>expenditure</b> (AEE), <b>PA</b> level, time spent on moderate to vigorous PA and the number of days with 1 hour or more of moderate to vigorous PAand was assessed with a 7 -day activity diary. Aerobic exercise capacity was assessed by means of a Bruce treadmill test and recorded as maximum endurance time. Disease activity was assessed by using the JIA core set. Adherence was electronically monitored. Analysis: Descriptive statistics were used for patient's characteristics. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to test variables for normality of distribution. Paired samples t-test was used for within group differences. Results: Out of 59 patients 33 eligible patients were included and randomized in an intervention (n = 17, mean±SD age 10. 6 ± 1. 5 years) and control waiting list group (n = 16, mean±SD age 10. 8 ± 1. 4 years). All patients completed baseline and t = 1 testing. PA significantly improved in both groups. Maximum endurance time significantly improved in the intervention but not in the control group. In a subgroup analysis for patients with low PA (intervention n = 7 and control n = 5), PA improved in the intervention but not in the control group. The intervention was safe, feasible and showed a good adherence. Conclusions: An internet-based program for children with JIA, aged 8 - 12 years, directed at promoting PA in daily life, effectively improves PA in those patients with low PA levels. It can also improve endurance while it is safe, feasible and has a good adherence. Implications: PA in JIA can be improved through internet based interventions. Similar programs can be developed for other chronic conditions...|$|R
40|$|PhD (Human Movement Science), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 The {{dose-response}} relationship between physical activity (PA), disease and mortality has primarily been obtained from self-report questionnaires in Western populations. A major limitation of self-reported PA is {{the likelihood of}} measurement error and these recordings cannot account for all 24 -h activities, thus negating the influence of sedentary time and daily light intensity activity. Modern-day studies using objective measures of PA are highly controversial {{in the description of}} PA, as well as reliable wear time of these objective devices to accurately assess PA behaviour. The aim of the research presented in this thesis was to ascertain the associations between seven-day objectively measured PA (expressed as time spent in four different metabolic equivalent of task (MET) categories), cardiovascular disease risk factors (24 -h ambulatory blood pressure and central obesity), chronic stress (General Health Questionnaire total score and serum cortisol) and DNA damage (leukocyte telomere length) in a cohort of African and Caucasian school teachers recruited from the Dr Kenneth Kaunda Education District in the North West Province of South Africa. All parameters were objectively measured (the GHQ was only added for thoroughness on measures of cognitive perceived stress) in the study population. The Africans (n= 96) were younger than the Caucasians (n= 107) (48. 33 versus 51. 06 years, p= 0. 024), but presented with slightly higher waist circumferences, significantly higher 24 -h ambulatory systolic blood pressure (SBP, p≤ 0. 000), diastolic blood pressure (DBP, p≤ 0. 000) and mean arterial pressure (MAP, p≤ 0. 000); significantly higher perceived stress scores (GHQ total scores, p= 0. 001) and significantly shorter telomeres (p≤ 0. 000). The hypertensive participants in the total group (Africans and Caucasians combined) recorded 2. 2 hours (12. 4 %) more daily awake sedentary time than the normotensive participants (p= 0. 004) and sedentary time was also a slightly better predictor of hypertension than moderate and vigorous activity time (Odds ratio= 1. 00, p= 0. 006). Irrespective of race and sex, 24 -h SBP and DBP measurements were respectively associated with daily awake sedentary time (ß= 0. 17, p= 0. 018 and ß= 0. 18, p= 0. 020), light activity time (ß=- 0. 15, p= 0. 043 and ß=- 0. 16, p= 0. 041), waist circumference (ß= 0. 45, p≤ 0. 000 and ß= 0. 33, p≤ 0. 000) and log serum gamma glutamyl transferase (γ-GT, alcohol use) (ß= 0. 18, p= 0. 018 and ß= 0. 24, p= 0. 004). An older age (ß=- 0. 28, p≤ 0. 000), higher alcohol consumption (ß=- 0. 21, p= 0. 003) and increased central obesity (ß=- 0. 17, p= 0. 017) were associated with shorter telomeres. Attenuated cortisol levels (ß=- 0. 12, p= 0. 068) showed a tendency towards associations with longer telomeres that may indicate possible cortisol down regulation to protect against DNA damage. Time spent in the different MET-categories showed no direct associations with either cortisol or telomere length. However, a sensitivity analysis indicated that daily light intensity activity time was significantly correlated with lower waist circumference (r=- 0. 21, p= 0. 004); a parameter associated with both cortisol (ß=- 0. 22, p= 0. 003) and telomere length (ß=- 0. 17, p= 0. 017). The thorough recording of PA during the true awake time of 24 -h cycles over a period of seven days ensured that the beneficial effect of light intensity activities, as well as the detrimental effect of sedentary time, was highlighted by this study. The average awake time of all ethnic and sex groups were around 17 hours per day, which was more than most previous studies using objective measures of PA. The exclusion of participants who did not comply through wearing the Actiheart for a full seven days (n= 143, 40 %) did, however, {{have a negative impact on}} sample size that may have affected the statistical power for uncovering some significant associations and the high participant burden of the Actiheart device became clear. Therefore, the researchers used the data of the full seven-day recordings to also determine the minimum number of consecutive days the Actiheart device could be worn to accurately estimate energy <b>expenditure</b> and <b>PA.</b> The two-day combination of Wednesday-to-Thursday did not differ from the weekly average TEE, as well as for all MET-categories in all ethnic and sex groups. This two-day combination is practically convenient and would lessen participant burden. Future researchers are urged to test this combination in other populations to standardize Actiheart wear time. It can be concluded from the findings in this study that less daily awake sedentary time, more light intensity activity time, as well as lower alcohol consumption favour improved health as it is beneficial to 24 -h ambulatory blood pressure and helps to maintain a healthy waist circumference, which ultimately influence telomere shortening. Furthermore, the two-day combination of Wednesday-to-Thursday seems to be sufficient to accurately estimate weekly energy <b>expenditure</b> and habitual <b>PA</b> with the Actiheart apparatus.

40|$|Exercise-induced {{cardiovascular}} (CV) events, particularly sudden {{cardiac death}} (SCD), attract considerable media attention {{in the context of}} the safety of exercise for the general population. As a result, concern about the safety of exercise participation is a common topic during routine office checkups and with the prescribed recommendation of increased physical activity (PA). In reality, it is estimated that only 4 % to 17 % of myocardial infarctions in men are linked to physical exertion, with much lower rates observed for women. 1, 2 Of these exercise-related events, it is also true that few occur in the absence of preexisting cardiovascular disease (CVD), for which risk factors might (or might not) have already been evident. This article provides an executive summary of findings from a systematic review of the risks of PA in apparently healthy individuals. 3 It is one in a comprehensive series of reviews examining the risks of PA in healthy individuals and patients with various chronic diseases. The evidence thus obtained provides the foundation for new tools that will simplify the tasks of exercise clearance and prescription: the revised Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire (PAR-Q+) and the electronic Physical Activity Readiness Medical Examination (ePARmed-X+) procedure. 4 We present background evidence and mechanistic pathways regarding the risks of exercise in apparently healthy patients. The intention of this article is to facilitate the family physician's tasks of screening patients for PA participation and providing risk-appropriate PA prescriptions. Growing evidence indicates that a range of PA confers some benefit in a dose-response pattern, demonstrating a continuum of increasing benefit and risk reduction as one progresses from low-intensity to more vigorous PA. In healthy individuals, low-intensity exercise performed regularly (3 to 5 times per week) can elicit substantial improvements in measures of quality of life, body composition, and CVD risk factors. More vigorous PA has been associated with pronounced reductions in risk and all-cause mortality rates in individuals with various chronic diseases. Energy <b>expenditure</b> through vigorous <b>PA</b> of at least 1000 kcal per week, but optimally closer to 2000 kcal per week, has yielded the greatest risk reductions for CVD. 5,...|$|R
40|$|There is {{evidence}} that physical activity (PA) levels are declining in English children. Sedentary screen based media activities, including computer use and video game play {{have been linked to}} low PA levels and unhealthy energy intake (EI). These behaviours appear to be particularly prevalent in boys during mid-to-late childhood. Recent laboratory-based studies have found active video games can increase children’s energy <b>expenditure</b> (EE) and <b>PA</b> levels to moderate to vigorous levels, in comparison to matched conditions such as resting and seated video game play and so could increase children’s PA. However, the previous active video gaming studies have utilised various protocols that probably do not accurately reflect the real life active video gaming practices of children. Recently it has been established that there is EI in adolescents during active video gaming. If this is so, the EI during active video gaming could potentially counteract the EE from active video game play. The purpose of this thesis therefore, was to establish the acute appetite, EI and PA responses to active video gaming, in 8 - 11 y boys. There is sparse information regarding the habitual active video gaming behaviours of children during mid-to-late childhood. Consequently, in study one a questionnaire was designed specifically, to understand the real-life active video gaming practices of 40 7 - 11 yr-olds. By utilising the survey findings, in study two an acute intervention was designed to investigate the subjective appetite sensations (hunger, prospective food consumption and fullness), EI and PA in response to active video gaming in 21 8 - 11 yr-old boys. Each boy completed four individual 90 min gaming bouts in a randomised order which were; 1) seated video gaming no food or drinks, 2) active video gaming no food or drinks, 3) seated video gaming, food and drinks offered ad libitum and 4) active video gaming, food and drinks offered ad libitum. The study determined that there were no differences in acute sensations of hunger, prospective food consumption and fullness, or EI (MJ) between the seated and active video gaming bouts during which foods and drinks were offered ad libitum (bouts 3 and 4). Physical activity levels due to active video gaming were light and from seated video gaming were sedentary. Energy intake during both bouts was greater than the estimated EE, thus producing a positive relative energy balance state in the boys. As subjective appetite findings did not explain the high EI during both seated and active video gaming, the objective study of appetite was necessary. A previous adult study had established good reproducibility in GLP- 17 - 36, glucagon, leptin and insulin by using the less invasive fingertip capillary sampling. Since fingertip capillary sampling had not been utilised to measure plasma concentrations of the above mentioned hormones in children during gaming, in study three, preliminary testing established good reliability for fasting plasma GLP- 17 - 36 and blood glucose in 8 - 11 yr-old boys. Enabling study three to compare acute satiety related signalling, subjective appetite, EI and PA in 21 8 - 11 yr-old boys, in response to one bout of active video gaming and one bout of seated video gaming, during which food and drinks were offered ad libitum. The satiety-related signals, namely plasma GLP- 17 - 36 and blood glucose were measured alongside subjective appetite sensations and EI during active and seated video game play and in a post-gaming test meal. A significant increase in glucose showed the boys had consumed a greater proportion of carbohydrate (CHO) during active video gaming. However, as more total energy was consumed during seated video gaming, and plasma GLP- 17 - 36 was higher during active video gaming, according to the ‘glucostatic theory’, {{there may have been a}} satiety response. The satiety signals may not have been strong enough to override the hedonic response to food intake, especially as fullness sensations were higher during active video gaming. Physical activity levels were light due to active video gaming and sedentary from seated video gaming and so on cessation of both bouts, the relative energy balance of the boys was positive. The positive relative energy balance state was then not compensated for by a reduction in EI in a post-gaming test meal. Instead, the additional EI resulted in an increase in the positive relative energy balance state, of the 8 - 11 yr-old boys. The overall findings of this thesis established that EI appears to be commonplace in the majority of 8 - 11 yr-old children during active video gaming. Parents should encourage their children to play active, rather than seated video games to reduce sedentary time and also discourage EI during game play...|$|R
