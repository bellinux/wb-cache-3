Smaller bags are typically {{used to hold}} a few items such as spare inner tubes, <b>puncture</b> <b>repair</b> <b>kit,</b> tools, rain gear, food, first-aid kit, etc. Seat bags are common on touring bicycles, racing bicycles, and cross country mountain bikes.|$|E

50|$|For basic {{maintenance}} and repairs cyclists can carry a pump (or a CO2 cartridge), a <b>puncture</b> <b>repair</b> <b>kit,</b> a spare inner tube, and tire levers {{and a set of}} allen keys. Cycling can be more efficient and comfortable with special shoes, gloves, and shorts. In wet weather, riding can be more tolerable with waterproof clothes, such as cape, jacket, trousers (pants) and overshoes and high-visibility clothing is advisable to reduce the risk from motor vehicle users.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} multi-item inventory systems that contain <b>repair</b> <b>kits</b> of spare parts and tools and may include {{an inventory of}} spare machines as well. Demands occur {{in the form of}} field repair jobs, each requiring some collection of parts and tools for completion. If any required part or tool is not in the <b>repair</b> <b>kit,</b> the <b>repair</b> job is "broken. " The penalty or inconvenience cost is assumed to be proportional to the number of broken jobs, regardless of the number of items short. Previous work on job completion based systems is summarized and new results for the optimal solutions are derived. A more general job completion based system is also analyzed, which allows a pool of spare machines to be used to satisfy demands which cannot be met with the <b>repair</b> <b>kits.</b> Techniques are presented for optimizing the trade-off between the inventory cost of <b>repair</b> <b>kits</b> plus spare machines and the overall level of service. inventory control, <b>repair</b> <b>kits,</b> spares...|$|R
50|$|The Arts Lab's theatre {{programme}} was controversial {{from its}} start in 1969, with a nude open-air {{performance on the}} Arts Lab's roof by the theatre company Sweetness and Light attracting headlines in the Birmingham Post.

50|$|A character-based street theatre which {{developed}} in the 1960s and 1970s was developed by groups like Lumiere and Son, John Bull <b>Puncture</b> <b>Repair</b> <b>Kit,</b> Exploded Eye and Natural Theatre Company. The performances were unannounced and featured characters who acted out a pre-arranged scenario, looking beautiful or surreal or simply just involving passers by in conversation. They did not seek to trick in a Candid Camera way, but rather invited the audience to pretend along with them. No amount of planning or rehearsal could dictate what would happen.|$|E

Edgar was co-founder of such a group that took the name The General Will Theatre Company which specialised in a [...] "crude and cartoonish" [...] style of political commentary presented with generous dollops of music hall and burlesque for comedic effect. General Will took several of Edgar's works on tour including The National Interest (1971), a series of sketches showing how the mythical concept of 'The National Interest' {{can be used to}} justify sacrifices by the many on behalf of the self-interested few; The Rupert Show (1971) a one-act play set in a church during a service conducted by among others a vicar who also plays Superman, Lord Longford and Judge Argyle, the judge in the Oz obscenity trial, which the title mocks, and State of Emergency (1972), which toured with General Will and also appeared at the Edinburgh Festival and at the Royal Court Theatre Upstairs, all in 1972, was a one-act documentary with songs about industrial resistance to the Conservative government. General Will came to a halt when the only gay member of the company took exception to the heterosexual slant of the material and went on strike in mid-performance. They did, however, lead to Edgar's first foreign premiere.|$|E

50|$|A <b>repair</b> <b>kit</b> {{or service}} kit {{is a set}} of items used to repair a device, {{commonly}} comprising both tools and spare parts. Many kits are designed for vehicles, such as cars, boats, airplanes, motorbikes, and bicycles, and may be kept with the vehicle in order to make on-the-spot repairs. Some are considered essential safety equipment, and may be included survival kits. In the military, personnel crossing large water bodies in aircraft may be equipped with a raft and raft <b>repair</b> <b>kit.</b> Other kits, such as those for watch repair or specific engine components, are used by professionals. Depending on the type, a <b>repair</b> <b>kits</b> may be included when buying a product, or may be purchased separately.|$|R

40|$|The <b>Repair</b> <b>Kit</b> Problem {{is about}} {{determining}} {{the stock of}} service parts carried by field service engineers for on-site product support. Models that optimise cost or service performances {{have appeared in the}} literature, but two important managerial decisions have not received enough attention. They are the maximum amount of stock to be carried on the vehicle (referred to as inventory budget) and the number of times per week the <b>repair</b> <b>kit</b> should be restocked (replenishment frequency). In this paper we propose a solution method based on the sequential use of optimization and simulation that addresses these issues. The application study was inspired by a real case of an equipment provider and tested on real data. The method allows defining the <b>repair</b> <b>kit</b> and assessing the impact on the overall cost of combinations of inventory budget and replenishment frequency values. The proposed method aims at improving the managerial understanding on how these decisions interact and at bridging a literature gap. In particular, it supports managers in (i) defining the <b>Repair</b> <b>Kit</b> to be carried by each Service Engineer; (ii) identifying the levels of inventory budget and replenishment frequency minimising the overall cost in correspondence of different combinations of exogenous (cost) parameter...|$|R

40|$|Background. Mechanical {{complications}} {{in the use}} of indwelling central venous catheters (CVCs) such as the Broviac catheter (BC) include kinking, occlusion, dislocation or leaking. We {{report on}} a mechanical complication after using a <b>repair</b> <b>kit</b> for the BC. Method. A 4 -year old boy, suffering from multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 a (MEN 2 a), intestinal aganglionosis (Hirschsprung&# 39;s disease), and short bowel syndrome, required a BC for home parenteral nutrition. Result. Due to recurrent leakage of the BC, 5 subsequent repairs were necessary within seven months. During one repair a metallic tube belonging to the <b>repair</b> <b>kit</b> was found to have migrated proximally to the skin entrance level within the BC and requiring surgical removal. Conclusion. To our knowledge, this is the first report focusing on such a serious complication using a BC and its <b>repair</b> <b>kit.</b> The proximal migration of this metallic tube constitutes a distinct theoretical risk of endothoracic foreign body embolization...|$|R
