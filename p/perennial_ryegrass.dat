25|$|Loline bioactivities {{show some}} {{unexpected}} variability with variation in their concentration in grass tissues. For example, the tall fescue endophyte, N. coenophialum, {{has been associated}} with enhanced resistance to the migratory root-endoparasitic nematode, Pratylenchus scribneri. Interestingly, at low concentrations, N-formylloline serves as a chemoattractant for P. scribneri, but acts as a repellant at higher concentrations. However, ergot alkaloids also have repellent and immobilizing effects on P. scribneri, and an endophyte of <b>perennial</b> <b>ryegrass</b> lacking lolines, and genetically engineered to produce no ergot alkaloids, exhibits resistance to this nematode. Therefore, the relative importance of the loline and ergot alkaloids to nematode resistance remains unclear.|$|E
25|$|Some {{chemical}} defenses {{once thought}} to be produced by the plant have since been shown to be synthesized by endophytic fungi. The chemical basis of insect resistance in endophyte-plant defense mutualisms has been most extensively studied in the <b>perennial</b> <b>ryegrass</b> and three major classes of secondary metabolites are found: indole diterpenes, ergot alkaloids and peramine. Related compounds are found across the range of endophytic fungal associations with plants. The terpenes and alkaloids are inducible defenses which act similarly to defensive compounds produced by plants and are highly toxic {{to a wide variety of}} phytophagous insects as well as mammalian herbivores. Peramine occurs widely in endophyte-associated grasses and may also act as a signal to invertebrate herbivores of the presence of more dangerous defensive chemicals. Terpenoids and ketones have been linked to protection from specialist and generalist herbivores (both insect and vertebrate) across the higher plants.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1985 Seed yield in {{ryegrass}} (Lolium spp.) is {{the product}} of the number of fertile tillers per unit area and seed weight per spike at maturity. These components of yield develop through a series of growth stages beginning with tiller bud initiation and finishing with seed filling. Environmental conditions during plant growth control potential yield development and the efficiency with which it is utilized. Lodging in ryegrass can have dramatic effects upon the utilization of potential yield. It occurs when culm strength is inadequate to maintain the spike in its vertical position. High moisture and fertility stimulate vegetative growth, stem elongation, and produce premature or early lodging. The timing and severity of lodging directly determine its impact upon seed yield and its components. In these experiments, the effects of the plant growth regulator paclobutrazol upon tillering, lodging, dry matter partitioning, and seed yield were investigated under controlled environment and field conditions. Linn and Pennfine <b>perennial</b> <b>ryegrasses</b> under dry conditions (1982) lodged after anthesis with no significant effect upon yield. In 1983, Caravelle and Pennfine <b>perennial</b> <b>ryegrasses</b> lodged prior to the completion of anthesis which resulted in yield reductions when compared to unlodged plants. The plant growth regulator paclobutrazol delayed lodging by restricting stem elongation. This effect was concentrated in the basal internodes where both internode length and weight were reduced. In Pennfine and Caravelle <b>perennial</b> <b>ryegrasses</b> the strength of the internodal segments were found {{to be related to the}} dry weight per unit length of stem. Paclobutrazol increased the dry weight per unit length of stem, stem strength, and seed yield. Yield increases were attributed to increased number and weight of seeds per spike and larger number of fertile tillers. Paclobutrazol was found to influence plant growth in several ways. Paclobutrazol applied to annual ryegrass at the vegetative growth stage increased tiller number, decreased leaf length, and decreased leaf area. Treatment at the floret initiation stage decreased tiller length and increased the number of florets in the top spikelet. Tiller number was not significantly increased. This indicates that paclobutrazol had a variety of potential effects upon ryegrass development depending upon the growth stage at application and the rate applied...|$|R

50|$|<b>Perennial</b> <b>ryegrass</b> {{staggers}} {{is caused}} by the ingestion of grass that is infected by the endophyte fungus Epichloë festucae var lolli, and this fungus produces a variety of toxins such as peramine, a pyrrolopyrazine alkaloid, and lolitrem B, an indole-diterpene compound. There is no external sign when <b>perennial</b> <b>ryegrass</b> is infected by this fungus. The Argentine stem weevil (Listronotus bonariensis) feeds on <b>perennial</b> <b>ryegrass.</b> When the grass on which they are feeding is infected by the fungus, the larvae of the weevil fail to develop fully. In an effort to breed <b>perennial</b> <b>ryegrass</b> that was resistant to the weevil, researchers in New Zealand inadvertently selected strains that were susceptible to the fungus.

30|$|In conclusion, rural biorefineries {{have been}} {{identified}} as a potential means to facilitate social and economic regeneration in regions where a low GDP affects communities (Charlton et al. [2009]). Here we demonstrate the possibility of generating bioethanol and probiotic yeast biomass from agriculturally-sourced grass juice. Breeding for bio-ethanol production using L. perenne L. with higher water-soluble carbohydrate content is already underway in the United Kingdom (Farrar et al. [2012]) and results from the present study highlight further opportunities for integrated microbial biotechnology and large scale biorefining using high sugar <b>perennial</b> <b>ryegrasses</b> (Charlton et al. [2009]; Martel et al.[2010]; Martel et al. [2011]). The experiments described can be a base towards extraction of maximum value from grass as proteins and chlorophyll are some of the other products that can be envisaged. The grass cellulosic fibre could also be fermented after appropriate enzymological and process treatments. Increased content of water soluble carbohydrates in breeding processes and engineering solutions to concentrate the juice to generate higher concentrations of bioethanol for distillation are also avenues that need to be explored. Finally it is evident S. boulardii could be used in other bioethanol processes if a use for biomass on that scale was desirable as in reducing methane emissions.|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{within the}} European Union several legislative, {{monitoring}} and coordinating actions have been undertaken to encourage sustainable use of resources, {{reduction in the}} use of chemicals and improvement of the urban environment. In this respect, two concepts that are strictly related to most of the aspects above are: ‘‘precision agriculture’’ and ‘‘precision conservation’’ and more specifically ‘‘precision turfgrass management. ’’ Optical sensing has become a crucial part of precision turfgrass management and spectral reflectance in particular has been an active area of research for many years. However, while turfgrass status evaluation by proximity-sensed spectral reflectance appears to be an established and reliable practice, much more could be achieved in terms of monitoring of large turfgrass areas through remote sensing, and in particular through satellite imagery.

Identifying renewable sources of target molecules currently produced from fossil fuels is one of these, which will ultimately {{have a positive impact on}} climate change. Another driver is identifying potential uses for land masses, where a low GDP is affecting communities in those areas. From a UK perspective, a decline in total income generated from farming in Wales has had a detrimental impact on many communities right across the Principality. There is a considerable body of data to argue that with effective land use and the use of a range of enzymic and chemical processing technologies, the utilisation of lignocellulosic biomass as feedstock for a biorefining industry would result in both social and economic regeneration of these rural communities. In order to create a sustainable biorefining in Wales, alongside regeneration of the rural economy there is a requirement for expansion of the high technology skill base, in areas such as chemistry, biotechnology and engineering. The key to developing this sustainable and economically viable biorefining industry within Wales and ultimately in the UK is based on several technical issues which need to be addressed. These include ensuring that the feedstocks can be grown on marginal land which will not therefore compete with traditional food crops, the need to create local supply chains linking regions together, but which can also feed into the rapidly expanding networks of biomass-based industrial activity in other areas of the UK, and ensuring that the existing transport infrastructure can absorb this increase in activity.
