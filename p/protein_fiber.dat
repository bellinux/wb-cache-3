25|$|Silk is {{a natural}} <b>protein</b> <b>fiber,</b> some forms {{of which can be}} woven into textiles. The <b>protein</b> <b>fiber</b> of silk is {{composed}} mainly of fibroin and is produced by certain insect larvae to form cocoons. The best-known silk is obtained from the cocoons of the larvae of the mulberry silkworm Bombyx mori reared in captivity (sericulture). The shimmering appearance of silk is due to the triangular prism-like structure of the silk fibre, which allows silk cloth to refract incoming light at different angles, thus producing different colors.|$|E

40|$|Biological {{mineralization}} {{of tissues}} in living organisms relies on proteins that preferentially nucleate minerals and control their growth. This process {{is often referred}} to as “templating,” but this term has become generic, denoting various proposed mineral–organic interactions including both chemical and structural affinities. Here, we present an approach using self-assembled networks of elastin and fibronectin fibers, similar to the extracellular matrix. When induced onto negatively charged sulfonated polystyrene surfaces, these <b>proteins</b> form <b>fiber</b> networks of ≈ 10 -μm spacing, leaving open regions of disorganized protein between them. We introduce an atomic force microscopy-based technique to measure the elastic modulus of both structured and disorganized protein before and during calcium carbonate mineralization. Mineral-induced thickening and stiffening of the <b>protein</b> <b>fibers</b> during early stages of mineralization is clearly demonstrated, well before discrete mineral crystals are large enough to image by atomic force microscopy. Calcium carbonate stiffens the <b>protein</b> <b>fibers</b> selectively without affecting the regions between them, emphasizing interactions between the mineral and the organized <b>protein</b> <b>fibers.</b> Late-stage observations by optical microscopy and secondary ion mass spectroscopy reveal that Ca is concentrated along the <b>protein</b> <b>fibers</b> and that crystals form preferentially on the fiber crossings. We demonstrate that organized versus unstructured proteins can be assembled mere nanometers apart and probed in identical environments, where mineralization is proved to require the structural organization imposed by fibrillogenesis of the extracellular matrix...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Protein</b> <b>fibers</b> play {{a crucial}} role in many disease related {{phenomena}} and biological systems. A structural analysis of fibrous proteins often requires labeling approaches or disruptive sample preparation while it lacks chemical specificity. Here we demonstrate that the technique of vibrational sum-frequency scattering (SFS) provides a label-free pathway for the chemical and structural analysis of <b>protein</b> <b>fibers</b> in solution. By examining collagen, the most abundant protein in mammals, we demonstrate that the SFS signal of fibers can be detected in the NH, CH stretching and bending, and amide I regions. SFS spectra were found to depend on the scattering angle, which implies the possibility to selectively probe various features of the fibers. The fitting of the data and maximum entropy method analysi...|$|R

50|$|The “wool” {{model is}} the more {{important}} model of the two as the composition of natural protein resembles wool rather than silk. This type of fiber is stabilized through cross-linkages as it provides strength and prevents plastic flow resulting from slippage of protein chains. Wool is much less crystalline due to its greater bulkiness of its side chains. About 50% of the weight is composed of side chains. Due to the abundance of hydrophobic groups, wet wool fibers are considerably stronger than other synthetically made <b>protein</b> <b>fibers.</b> This {{is the result of}} stabilizing through disulfide linkages. When these bonds are broken at elevated temperature through hydrolysis or reduction, the wet wool fibers lose its unique strength and act like typical synthetic <b>protein</b> <b>fibers.</b>|$|R
