Although it was an elaborate chair having both armrests and leg rests, the design still had shortcomings since it did not feature an efficient <b>propulsion</b> <b>mechanism</b> and thus, requires assistance to propel it.

50|$|Janus sphere micromotors usually {{consist of}} a {{titanium}} dioxide surface layer and a strong reducing agent inner layer.

50|$|Based on {{analysis}} of the wreck, the ferry was 62 ft long, and had a beam of 15 ft. It had a maximum height of 4 ft, with a hold depth of 3 ft. The hull was double-ended, with a curved stempost and straight sternpost. Its <b>propulsion</b> <b>mechanism</b> followed a design patented in 1819 by Barnabas Langdon of Whitehall, New York. A central turntable, mounted at a level below the main deck, was connected by a gearing system to a sidewheel. Horses walked on the turntable, whose resulting rotation moved the sidewheel, providing forward motion through the water.|$|E
50|$|Manoeuvring {{thruster}} (bow thruster or stern thruster) is {{a transversal}} propulsion device built into, or mounted to, either the bow or stern, {{of a ship}} or boat, {{to make it more}} maneuverable. Bow thrusters make docking easier, since they allow the captain to turn the vessel to port or starboard side, without using the main <b>propulsion</b> <b>mechanism</b> which requires some forward motion for turning; indeed, the effectiveness of a thruster is curtailed by any forward motion due to the Coandă effect. A stern thruster is of the same principle, fitted at the stern. Large ships might have multiple bow thrusters and stern thrusters.|$|E

5000|$|Protosuchus is an extinct genus of {{carnivorous}} crocodylomorph {{from the}} Early Jurassic. The name Protosuchus means [...] "first crocodile", and {{is among the}} earliest animals that resemble crocodilians. Protosuchus was about 1 m in length and about 40 kg in weight.As an early crocodile relative, its skull featured more crocodilian characteristics than its earlier ancestors; it had short jaws that broadened out {{at the base of}} the skull, providing a large surface to which its jaw muscles could attach. This increased the maximum gape of the animal's mouth and the force with which the jaws could be closed. The dentition of the animal also resembled modern crocodiles, including the teeth in the lower jaw that fitted into notches on either side of the upper jaw when the mouth was closed. It also possessed a powerful tail which later developed into a <b>propulsion</b> <b>mechanism</b> through water in its descendants.|$|E

40|$|Micro {{unmanned}} underwater vehicles (UUVs) need {{to house}} <b>propulsion</b> <b>mechanisms</b> that are small in size but sufficiently powerful to deliver on-demand acceleration for tight radius turns, burst-driven docking maneuvers, and low-speed course corrections. Recently, small-scale hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) <b>propulsion</b> <b>mechanisms</b> have shown great promise in delivering pulsatile thrust for such acceleration needs. However, {{the need for}} robust, high surface area nanocatalysts that can be manufactured {{on a large scale}} for integration into micro UUV reaction chambers is still needed. In this report, a thermal/electrical insulator, silicon oxide (SiO 2) microfibers, is used as a support for platinum nanoparticle (PtNP) catalysts. The mercapto-silanization of the SiO 2 microfibers enables strong covalent attachment with PtNPs, and the resultant PtNP–SiO 2 fibers act as a robust, high surface area catalyst for H 2 O 2 decomposition. The PtNP–SiO 2 catalysts are fitted inside a micro UUV reaction chamber for vehicular propulsion; the catalysts can propel a micro UUV for 5. 9 m at a velocity of 1. 18 m/s with 50 mL of 50 % (w/w) H 2 O 2. The concomitance of facile fabrication, economic and scalable processing, and high performance—including a reduction in H 2 O 2 decomposition activation energy of 40 – 50 % over conventional material catalysts—paves the way for using these nanostructured microfibers in modern, small-scale underwater vehicle propulsion systems...|$|R
