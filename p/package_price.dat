40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{investigate}} the impact of <b>packaging,</b> <b>price</b> and brand awareness on brand loyalty. Rationale: The study sought to extend empirical evidence on the association between brand loyalty and product-related factors: <b>packaging,</b> <b>price</b> and brand awareness. Methodology: The study adopted a quantitative survey approach and was conducted in a paint retailing environment. Data were elicited from a conveniently selected sample of 212 consumers who purchased various brands of paint. Regression analysis and the one-way analysis of variance test were conducted to investigate the impact of <b>packaging,</b> <b>price</b> and brand awareness on brand loyalty. Findings: <b>Packaging,</b> <b>price</b> and brand awareness showed significant positive relationships with brand loyalty, which implied their significant predictive influence on brand loyalty. The results suggest that management should, inter alia, initiate and implement effective <b>packaging,</b> <b>pricing</b> and brand awareness in order to enhance consumers’ brand loyalty to the company’s products. Value of research: The research provides valuable insights to managers of companies on the need to continuously enhance their products’ <b>packaging</b> with competitive <b>pricing</b> strategies in order to improve brand awareness and brand loyalty and remain competitive in the market. The study also provides evidence of the relationship between brand loyalty and <b>packaging,</b> <b>price</b> and brand awareness in a South African context. Conclusion: The marketing success of businesses depends on their ability to continuously enhance their products’ <b>packaging</b> with competitive <b>pricing</b> and brand awareness strategies in order to improve brand loyalty. Future studies should be extended to other retailing environments and product categories. </p...|$|R

50|$|Opaque pricing {{of dynamic}} {{packages}} hide {{the price of}} the included components. This has several benefits. Suppliers of travel products often impose a minimum selling price for their products.

With dynamic packaging, the customer is not presented with the room price, only the overall <b>package</b> <b>price,</b> so hotels typically allow the wholesaler to discount the (hidden) price of the hotel more.|$|E

5000|$|Bundled payment, {{also known}} as episode-based payment, episode payment, episode-of-care payment, case rate, {{evidence-based}} case rate, global bundled payment, global payment, <b>package</b> <b>pricing,</b> or <b>packaged</b> <b>pricing,</b> {{is defined as the}} reimbursement of health care providers (such as hospitals and physicians) [...] "on the basis of expected costs for defined episodes of care." [...] It has been described as [...] "a middle ground" [...] between fee-for-service reimbursement (in which providers are paid for each service rendered to a patient) and capitation (in which providers are paid a [...] "lump sum" [...] per patient regardless of how many services the patient receives), given that risk is shared between payer and provider. Bundled payments have been proposed in the health care reform debate in the United States as a strategy for reducing health care costs, especially during the Obama administration (2009-2016). Commercial payers have shown interest in bundled payments in order to reduce costs. In 2012, it was estimated that approximately one-third of the United States healthcare reimbursement used bundled methodology.|$|R
40|$|In {{a number}} of African countries, the trophy hunting of large felids is an {{important}} revenue generator for landholders, governments {{and in some cases}} communities. The hunting of large felids is especially profitable but they are sensitive to harvest, as the killing of prime-aged, dominant males can lead to infanticide and lowered reproductive success. In an attempt to limit the negative impacts of trophy hunting on large felids, the scientific community has proposed {{a number of}} interventions, including age restrictions on the animals that may be hunted. Such interventions are theoretically complementary to trophy hunting, as hunters typically seek large trophies, and older animals are normally larger than younger ones in large felids. If trophy size results in an increase in trophy price, then interventions that improve average trophy size could confer elevated earnings. This is particularly true if such interventions increased the number of failed hunts such that the same tag can be sold more than once. However, if trophy size {{is not one of the}} most important factors determining the desirability of a hunt (which we judge by the price paid for a trophy hunt package), it may be more difficult to implement such schemes. It is therefore important to evaluate potential determinants of trophy hunt package price; and we examine that here for leopards (Panthera pardus) in Africa, at both the country and outfitter level. We show that Tanzania and Botswana have the most expensive package prices while South Africa has the cheapest packages. At the country level, we found no statistical relationships between <b>package</b> <b>price</b> and leopard trophy size (either through advertised website or Safari Club International (SCI) leopard trophy size), country GDP, relative hunt success, or quota size. Contrastingly, the number of charismatic species offered within a package and an index of outfitter reputation (as measured by total SCI trophy records) were positively associated with <b>package</b> <b>price.</b> Interestingly, SCI leopard trophy size was inversely correlated with <b>package</b> <b>price.</b> Our results suggest that hunters do not value leopard trophy size above other factors, which could hinder the implementation of more sustainable, age-based leopard hunting regulations.

40|$|The {{automotive}} industry is increasingly affected by digitalization and servitization. In the {{after sales service}} sector, original equipment manufacturers are developing information technology systems {{to be used in}} multiple international markets as a means for providing more efficient customer service. For instance, Volkswagen has introduced an information technology system called <b>Package</b> <b>Price</b> System where the ongoing rapid international rollout has been a priority rather than ensuring that the system is being properly adopted and used in the markets where the rollout has occurred. The aim of this thesis is to analyze how Volkswagen can ensure the adoption and long-term usage of their <b>Package</b> <b>Price</b> System across markets. This thesis is based on a qualitative case study conducted in three different European countries. It was found that the organizational setup of the {{automotive industry}} (original equipment manufacturers, importers and dealerships) results in information asymmetry constraining Volkswagen’s ability to ensure the proper implementation and usage of their system. Also, to make matters more complex, markets differed more than expected. The main outcome of the study suggests that original equipment manufacturers must consider the long-term usage of the system in their initial rollout strategy by putting in place an operational concept following the implementation of the system to further support the markets. This can only be successful if those involved at the original equipment manufacturer continue to further develop relationships with their importers. This will require more regular communication and face-to-face meetings with those involved in the adoption and usage of the system. MSc in International Business and Trad...|$|E
