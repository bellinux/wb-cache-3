Vibratory conveyors are commonly used in industry to carry {{a wide variety of}} particulate and granular materials. Application of electromagnetic vibratory drive com-bined with power converters provides flexibility during work. The use of a silicon-controlled rectifier (SCR) implies a <b>phase</b> <b>angle</b> <b>control,</b> which is very easy, but with many disadvantages (fixed frequency which is imposed by ac mains supply, poor power factor, mechanical retuning, etc.). Switching converters overcomes these disadvantages. Only then, driving for EVA does not depend on mains frequency.
