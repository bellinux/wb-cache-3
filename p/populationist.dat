They will bring such attitude in their adult life, when they will desire social repression and will form docile subjects for society. Michel Foucault, in his systematic study of sexuality, argued that rather than being merely repressed, the desires of the individual are efficiently mobilized and used, to control the individual, alter interpersonal relationships and control the masses. Foucault believed organized religion, through moral prohibitions, and economic powers, through advertising, make use of unconscious sex drives. Dominating desire, they dominate individuals. According {{to the analysis of}} Michel Foucault, in the west: the conjugal family organization, precisely {{to the extent that it}} was insular and heteromorphous with respect to the other power mechanisms, was used to support the great [...] "maneuvers" [...] employed for the Malthusiancontrol of the birthrate, for the <b>populationist</b> incitements, for the medicalization of sex and the psychiatrization of its nongenital forms.

40|$|William Coleman : Hygiene and {{the state}} {{according}} to Montyon. The <b>populationist</b> programme contained in Montyon 's Recherches et considérations sur la population de la France was essentially sociopolitical. But behind his call for action lay a conception of man's nature and his interaction with the environment based on the ancient medical doctrine of the influence on human well-being of the «six things non-natural ». In turn, the non-naturals provided a vocabulary and a theoretical framework for exploring and expressing factors which the state might use to increase its population. Montyon's bold demographic investigation was thus heavily invested with contemporary medical belief, at precisely the point where his discussion passed from analysis of population movement to considerations of action intended to direct that movement.

From the Renaissance to the mid- 17 th Century, <b>populationist</b> mercantilism reigned virtually unchallenged in France. However, {{at the end}} of the 17 th Century there appeared the first signs of pre-Malthusian concepts and even behaviour (economic analyses in terms of supply of the means of subsistence, minimum salary and declining productivity; demographic analyses in terms of geometrical progression and destructive obstacles; the search for the maximum of comfort and happiness; and later marriage, even permanent celibacy). But by retaining an optimistic perspective and substituting artificial for moral restraint, both theo¬ rists and French couples finally demonstrated the failure of pre-Malthusianism in France.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to demonstrate the need for an historical approach to the sociological and demographic study of marriage and the family. A particular focus is placed on the transition from adolescence into marriage of French young adults born after 1900. Data are taken from two surveys of assortative mating developed by the French demographic institute, INED. The first, Le choix du conjoint—The choice of a spouse—was undertaken in 1959. The second, La formation des couples—The process of union formation—in 1984. Two parallel investigations are conducted. First, theories used to construct the two surveys are re-examined. Second, empirical evidence from the two surveys helps delineate major changes in the routes taken by young adults into union. The first survey had been influenced by sociological preoccupations that preceded W. W. II or immediately followed it. They are derived from eugenics, <b>populationist</b> concerns, social morphology and anthropology. The study of cohabitation outside marriage was left unexplored by French scientists after 1890. Concepts of strategies and habitus developed by Pierre Bourdieu were instrumental in the development of new approaches to the understanding of this phenomenon. Empirical evidence can be assembled from the two INED surveys. The paths to enter union have continuously diversified during this century. Individuals born after 1914 started dating while still in school. For individuals born after 1948, cohabitation sharply increased, and delayed childbearing became more frequent. The lengthening of schooling offered women an alternative to marriage and a chance to acquire social status. Two conclusions can be derived: new evidence can be gained from old data; survey research is embedded in social theories that cannot be ignored at a time when more data are made available to social scientists. ...|$|E
40|$|Habsburg monarchs, {{starting}} from {{the second half of}} the 17 th, under the influence of mercantilist and <b>populationist</b> theories, consider the social politics to be increasingly important. This politic approach aims, firstly, to increase the number of inhabitants in the Empire through different measures such as: colonization of less densely populated areas of the Monarchy, medical assistance and better nutrition, protection of peasants against the abuses of feudal aristocracy. The Habsburgs tried, after Transylvania was united to the Monarchy, to implement a similar politic attitude. They were confronted, as in other initiatives, with the opposition of the recognized nations of the Principality. The measures applied by the Viennese court to increase the number of inhabitants in Transylvania, which will be analyzed in this paper, were, basically, bringing colonists to Transylvania, offering “Transylvanian citizenship” to a number of foreigners, and the control of migratory movement over the boundaries of the Principality. Measures taken by the Habsburgs to bring more colonists in Transylvania were not so successful compare to the vast initiative to colonize the Hungarian Plain and the Banat in the 18 th century. The only important colonization was the movement by force, from 1734 and 1776 of 4000 protestant citizens from the hereditary Austrian provinces to Transylvania, which had mostly a confessional aim. Another measure to increase the number of inhabitants of Transylvania could be considered the initiative to offer „Transylvanian citizenship” to some foreigners. We are speaking, firstly, about administrative and military personnel, who served the Monarchy in the Principality. In 1777 the „Transylvanian citizenship” was given to the Greek merchants, who, in fact, were living and working in Transylvania for a long time. An important role in the regulation and control of the migratory flux play the Habsburg measures to decrease and even stop the emigration of the inhabitants of Transylvania, especially Romanian peasants, towards Wallachia and Moldavia. These measures aimed at least maintaining the number of the inhabitants of Transylvania at the existing level...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} conceptualization, promotion and diffusion of {{the norm of}} population control at international and domestic levels, as well as adoption and implementation in Egypt. It also offers a critique of mainstream constructivism, an increasingly popular analytical approach to norm diffusion. Constructivists present convincing evidence that nonstate actors change state preferences through the promotion and diffusion of norms, or "shared expectations about appropriate behavior held by a community of actors" (Finnemore 1996, 22). To emphasize the independent influence of social factors, and to downplay material factors, however, constructivists select cases in which norm diffusion occurred before state sponsorship. Constructivist research answers the question, 'How are norms diffused {{in the absence of}} material constraint?' Aside from its censorship of material factors, additional constructivist shortcomings include its proclivity for examining only liberal or progressive norms, and its inattention to domestic political process and elites' broader decision-making options. This dissertation demonstrates that diffusion of the norm of population control depended on a combination of material and social factors related to an alliance among strange bedfellows, namely the United States and allied donors and INGOs, UN agencies, <b>populationist</b> and liberal feminist NGOs, and international financial institutions. In this case, the 'norm cascade' of formal state adoptions of population control followed formal social and material support by the United States and, subsequently, the United Nations. This research seeks to demonstrate that relationships of social and material inequality strongly condition the norms that are selected or rejected by international society and states, {{and the ways in which}} opponents conceptualize and mobilize for change. The case of population control suggests interesting answers to a different question, namely: How and why are certain international norms, and not others, successfully promoted, diffused and adopted by states? This dissertation also examines the mechanics of norm mutation, or efforts by the international women's health movement to substitute the original population control paradigm, family planning, with the new reproductive health paradigm. This new paradigm was adopted at the 1994 UN International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD), and the final chapter examines the current prospects for paradigm change in Egypt...|$|E
