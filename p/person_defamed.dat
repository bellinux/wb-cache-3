25|$|Under common law, to {{constitute}} defamation, a claim must generally be false {{and must have}} been made to someone other than the <b>person</b> <b>defamed.</b>|$|E
25|$|Defamation is the {{communication}} {{of a statement}} that makes a claim, expressly stated or implied to be factual, that may give an individual, business, product, group, government or nation a negative image. It is usually—but not always, a requirement that this claim be false and that the publication be communicated to someone other than the <b>person</b> <b>defamed</b> (termed the claimant).|$|E
5000|$|The {{plaintiff}} must plead {{and prove}} {{that he is the}} <b>person</b> <b>defamed.</b> This presents no problem if the plaintiff is named or readily identifiable. The test, again, is objective: Would the ordinary reasonable person hearing or reading the statement understand the matter to refer to the plaintiff? ...|$|E
5000|$|... {{included}} {{a response from}} the <b>defamed</b> <b>person,</b> except where this was seen as not practical or was unnecessary ...|$|R
50|$|Any <b>person</b> who has <b>defamed</b> {{any other}} <b>person</b> by alleging openly facts through {{information}} and communications networks stating true comments by internet and email {{with the purpose}} of slandering him shall be subject to imprisonment with or without prison labor for not more than 3 years or by a fine not exceeding 20 million won.|$|R
50|$|The {{question}} about libeling {{asked by the}} Freedom of the Press Index concerns existing penalties for libeling officials or the state. The MSI relates more to the <b>person</b> who is <b>defamed</b> {{and what they can}} do to prevent libeling (e.g. public officials are held to higher standards, must prove falsity). Furthermore the MSI question contains the aspect of the civil law against libeling.|$|R
50|$|Under common law, to {{constitute}} defamation, a claim must generally be false {{and must have}} been made to someone other than the <b>person</b> <b>defamed.</b> Some common law jurisdictions also distinguish between spoken defamation, called slander, and defamation in other media such as printed words or images, called libel.|$|E
5000|$|Le Secret du jour J (1964) (Secrets of D-Day, 1974) won a prize {{from the}} Comité d'action de la Résistance {{and was an}} {{international}} bestseller. L'Orchestre rouge (1967) was even more successful. In 1969 Perrault published a spy novel, Le dossier 51. In 1978, Gilles Perrault published Le Pull-over rouge, a novel in which he criticized the method of investigation done by the French police around the 1974 death of an 8-year-old girl. Christian Ranucci, a French citizen, was executed by guillotine for the murder on 28 July 1976. Perrault's case, calling Ranucci's guilt into question, held a great influence in the debate upon capital punishment in France. It has reportedly had a notable impact upon a part of public opinion, having sold over 1 million copies. Perrault was condemned twice, however, for his claims and papers about this case: in 1990 for having talked in a TV program of [...] "abuse of authority" [...] about the policemen {{in charge of the}} investigation (fined 40,000 francs to each <b>person</b> <b>defamed</b> at first instance, and 70,000 francs to each of the five plaintiffs on appeal, as well as the presenter); and in 2008 he and his publisher Fayard were found guilty of defamation toward the Marseille police in the book L'Ombre de Christian Ranucci (fined 5,000 euros and his editor an equal sum, a decision confirmed on appeal in 2009 and granted 10,000 euros in damages to each of the four policemen defamed).|$|E
40|$|Defamatory {{statements}} of fact published in mass media {{give rise to}} a legal problem of particular difficulty. When a defamatory statement of fact is published by mass media, the breadth of the statement’s dissemination is likely to maximize the harm to the <b>person</b> <b>defamed.</b> Yet in recent decades there has been an increasing consciousness among legislators and the judiciary of the importance of freedom of expression in democratic societies. Defamation cases are free speech cases in microcosm. Judicial appreciation of the important values at stake on both sides of cases involving defamatory {{statements of}} fact in mass media has led to recognition that the publication of such statements, when they relate to subjects of legitimate public interest, should in some circumstances be legally protected. As a result, Canadian law as to the availability of a defence of privilege for mass media has been in a state of evolution for many years. This article surveys the history of that evolution, which has led to a restatement of libel law in terms of free expression the ory. A cornerstone of that restatement is the recent recognition by the Supreme Court, in Grant v. Torstar, of a new defence of responsible communication on matters of public interest...|$|E
25|$|Most {{defendants}} in defamation lawsuits are newspapers or publishers, which {{are involved in}} about twice as many lawsuits as are television stations. Most plaintiffs are corporations, businesspeople, entertainers and other public figures, and people involved in criminal cases, usually defendants or convicts but sometimes victims as well. In no state can a defamation claim be successfully maintained if the allegedly <b>defamed</b> <b>person</b> is deceased.|$|R
50|$|Any <b>person</b> who has <b>defamed</b> {{any other}} <b>person</b> by alleging openly false facts via {{information}} and communications networks stating false {{comments on the}} internet and email with the purpose of slandering him/her shall be subject to imprisonment with prison labor for not more than 7 years or the suspension of disqualification for not more than 10 years, or by a fine not exceeding 50 million won US$50,000. In addition to this criminal law, in Korea you can also sue for damages with civil actions. Generally, criminal actions proceed civil ones with Korean police as judicial investigators..|$|R
25|$|According to § 194 {{the charge}} of insult (slander) can only be prosecuted if the <b>defamed</b> <b>person</b> chooses to press charges. False {{imprisonment}} can be charged if the victim—when applying an objective view—can {{be considered to be}} impaired in his or her rights of free movement. According to § 228 of the German criminal code a person inflicting a bodily injury on another person with that person's permission violates the law only in cases where the act can be considered to have violated good morals in spite of permission having been given. On 26 May 2004 the Criminal Panel No. 2 of the Bundesgerichtshof (German Federal Court) ruled that sado-masochistically motivated physical injuries are not per se indecent and thus subject to § 228.|$|R
50|$|There are {{records of}} several visitations {{of this house}} in the episcopal registers. In 1297 it came under the notice of Bishop Sutton. He had heard that the apparitor of Dunstable had cited 'certain persons of both sexes living in the priory of Markyate' for immorality, whereby these <b>persons</b> had been <b>defamed,</b> and the house had {{incurred}} scandal. Evidently the bishop thought the evidence against them insufficient, for he ordered the archdeacon {{to see that they}} were not further molested. It seems improbable from the description that the persons alluded to were religious: they were perhaps boarders taken in during the great necessity of the house. At about the same time the prioress and convent were ordered to repair the chancel of one of their appropriate churches.|$|R
40|$|In the past, {{jurisdiction}} {{issues in}} defamation cases were easily resolved because territory was definable. However, jurisdiction is now questionable as anyone {{with access to}} the Internet knowingly or unknowingly defames another through blogs or social networking sites downloadable anywhere in the world. Even with the peculiar cross-border nature of cyberspace, Gutnick vs. Dow Jones has shown that defamation litigation can be successful. On the other hand, not every <b>defamed</b> <b>person</b> could get redress for his grievances {{as in the case of}} Philippine society columnist Jose Delfin 2 ̆ 2 DJ 2 ̆ 2 Montano - the object of Australian blogger Brian Gorrell 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 s defamatory writings. Montano 2 ̆ 7 s case illustrates the vulnerability of private individuals to cyber defamation and the difficulty of getting redress because there is no appropriate approach to cross-border Internet defamation that would serve both parties fairly. The Montano-Gorrell case illustrates the need for 2 ̆ 2 global consistency 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 unifying principles 2 ̆ 2 in handling internet defamation...|$|R
5000|$|The {{eldest son}} of Sir John Gascoigne of Cardington, Bedfordshire, Gascoigne was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, and on leaving the {{university}} {{is supposed to have}} joined the Middle Temple. He became a member of Gray's Inn in 1555. He has been identified without much show of evidence with a lawyer named Gastone who was in prison in 1548 under very discreditable circumstances. There is no doubt that his escapades were notorious, and that he was imprisoned for debt. George Whetstone says that Sir John Gascoigne disinherited his son on account of his follies, but by his own account he was obliged to sell his patrimony to pay the debts contracted at court. He was MP for Bedford in 1557-1558 and 1558-1559, but when he presented himself in 1572 for election at Midhurst he was refused on the charges of being [...] "a <b>defamed</b> <b>person</b> and noted for manslaughter", [...] "a common Rymer and a deviser of slaunderous Pasquelles", [...] "a notorious rufilanne", and a constantly indebted atheist.|$|R
5000|$|This case, however, and {{a series}} of {{following}} cases, failed to produce a clear statement of the operative principle which commanded the support of a majority of the Court. But in 1997 in Lange v Australian Broadcasting Corporation which involved the alleged defamation of a former Prime Minister of New Zealand a unanimous Court did state the operative principle. It rejected the [...] "constitutional defence" [...] of the migration-bias case just discussed, and instead expanded the scope of [...] "qualified privilege", requiring the defendant to have actively taken reasonable steps to verify the accuracy of the published material, and also, in most circumstances, to have given the <b>defamed</b> <b>person</b> an opportunity to respond. On the other hand, the Court {{made it clear that the}} qualified privilege may extend to discussion concerning the United Nations and other countries, even where there is no direct nexus with the exercise of political choice in Australia. In McCloy v New South Wales,the High Court further endorsed the view that a qualified freedom of political communication exists and provided an updated and more detailed legal test.|$|R
5000|$|To {{fulfill the}} charge of coercion, the use of {{violence}} or the threat of a [...] "severe mistreatment" [...] must involve an endangerment to life and limb. In cases where the continued application of the treatment could be ended {{through the use of a}} safeword, neither coercion nor sexual coercion may be charged. In the case of charges of sexual abuse of people incapable of resistance, similar principles apply. In this case, taking advantage of a person's inability to resist in order to perform sexual acts on that person is considered punishable. The potential use of the safeword is considered to be sufficient possibility for resistance, since this would lead to the cessation of the act, and so a true inability to resist is not considered to be in effect. The charge of insult (slander) can only be prosecuted if the <b>defamed</b> <b>person</b> chooses to press charges, according to §194. False imprisonment can be charged if the victim—when applying an objective view—can be considered to be impaired in his or her rights of free movement.|$|R
40|$|Research on "Defamation Through Mass Media Seen From the Perspective Juridical Act No. 40 of 1999 " aims to {{find out}} and {{understand}} more about the mechanisms of accountability to the press before the court and also to know and understand more deeply about who should be responsible if {{there are those who}} feel defamed his name. The information conveyed by the press to the public, can be taken vary according to the responsiveness of each individual. A <b>person</b> can feel <b>defamed</b> because seeing the terms used by the press, while the press and media is not intended to defame someone with those terms it uses, only to draw the attention of the public. The clas between press and the public may occur {{as a result of a}} dish that is considered detrimental to a person or a certain group. This requires a fair settlement and accepted by the parties concerned. Phenomenon is the friction surfaced in the form of public or individual lawsuits against the press and vigilante actions against journalists such as the beating of journalists, seizure of the camera, and so forth...|$|R
40|$|Both, {{reputation}} {{and freedom of}} speech are constitutional rights. But whether we want it or not, they regularly meet and are in conflict with one to another. But, as many judgments show, courts rather rarely reach a judgment, what is excellent within its juridical construction. That’s why the target of this job was to examine as many judgments it’s possible and to inspect cases of defamation in the U. S. A. (as it has the most higher degree of speech protection, after Sullivan case), together with the praxis of the European Court of Human rights and of national courts. Author {{wanted to create a}} test for the courts. This work consists of seven main chapters. The second one looks at the statutory regulation about {{reputation and}} freedom of speech. The next – what is absolute and qualified privileges (for Latvian jurisdiction has no similar concept), fourth will go on and try to define different possible status of persons; fifth will examine, how an opinion might be defended; sixth will consider about factual basis and standards of liability, but the last chapter will lay down the borders to criticize persons. Finally, the test is built up from three categories of criteria – id est it includes the public interest, what varies from political questions till just private. Then, the test weighes out, whether the factual basis is true and if not, what kind of liability (malice, actual malice, bona fide) is to apply, taking into account, what is the status of the <b>defamed</b> <b>person</b> – public official, public figure, quasi-public official figure or private person. So, the most ample protection is intended for a private person (even strict liability), but the less – for public official/figure. But the protection of opinion varies from the status of the person and the interest the case involved...|$|R
