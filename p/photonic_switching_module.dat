40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a new petabit <b>photonic</b> packet <b>switch</b> architecture, called PetaStar. Using a new multidimensional photonic multiplexing scheme that includes space, time, wavelength, and subcarrier domains, PetaStar {{is based on}} a three-stage Clos-network <b>photonic</b> <b>switch</b> fabric to provide scalable large-dimension switch interconnections with nanosecond reconfiguration speed. Packet buffering is implemented electronically at the input and output port controllers, allowing the central <b>photonic</b> <b>switch</b> fabric to transport high-speed optical signals without electrical-to-optical conversion. Optical time-division multiplexing technology further scales port speed beyond electronic speed up to 160 Gb/s to minimize the fiber connections. To solve output port contention and internal blocking in the three-stage Clos-network switch, we present a new matching scheme, called c-MAC, a concurrent matching algorithm for Clos-network switches. It is highly distributed such that the input–output matching and routing-path finding are concurrently performed by scheduling modules. One feasible architecture for the c-MAC scheme, where a crosspoint switch is used to provide the interconnections between the arbitration modules, is also proposed. With the c-MAC scheme, and an internal speedup of 1. 5, PetaStar with a switch size of 6400 6400 and total capacity of 1. 024 petabit/s can be achieved at a throughput close to 100 % under various traffic conditions.

40|$|Abstract — We {{consider}} a <b>switch</b> <b>module</b> routing problem for symmetrical-array field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA’s). This problem {{was first introduced}} in [21]. They used it to evaluate the routability properties of <b>switch</b> <b>modules</b> which they proposed. Only an approximation algorithm for the problem was proposed by them. We give an optimal algorithm for the problem based on integer linear programming (ILP). Experiments show that this formulation leads to fast and efficient solutions to practical-sized problems. We then propose a precomputation that eliminates the need to use ILP on-line. We also identify special cases of this problem that reduce to problems for whom efficient algorithms are known. Thus, the <b>switch</b> <b>module</b> routing problem can be solved in polynomial time for these special cases. Using our solution to the <b>switch</b> <b>module</b> routing problem, we propose a new metric to estimate the congestion in each <b>switch</b> <b>module</b> in the FPGA.
