40|$|Unsteady forces {{generated}} by fluid {{flow through the}} impeller shroud leakage path of a centrifugal pump were investigated. Different <b>pump</b> <b>shroud</b> geometries were compared, {{and the effect of}} leakage path inlet swirl (pump discharge swirl) on the rotordynamic forces was examined for various ratios of fluid flowthrough velocities to impeller tip speed. A short axial length leakage path reduced the measured forces, while curvature appeared to increase the destabilizing forces when inlet swirl was present. It was observed that changing the inlet swirl velocity does not appear to significantly affect the measured forces for a given leakage flow coefficient, but any nonzero inlet swirl is destabilizing when compared to cases with no inlet swirl...|$|E
30|$|In an {{impeller}} with balance holes of the double-sealing ring structure in a centrifugal pump, the hub plate crown of the impeller {{is divided into}} a shroud cavity and a hub cavity by the sealing ring. The calculation of round disk friction loss and axial thrust {{is closely related to}} the flow in the hub plate crown. Research on the shroud cavity, hub cavity, and sealing ring leakage has revealed the mechanism of the internal round disk friction loss and axial thrust of the centrifugal pump. Yang et al. [1] pointed out that disc friction loss calculated by the conventional method would produce more errors since it only considered the friction torque of the impeller at its periphery but ignored the major part at the hub plate crown and sealing ring. In the derivation of the axial thrust calculation formula, under the assumption that no fluid leakage flow exists in the hub plate crown and the fluid rotational angular velocity within the shroud cavity is half of the impeller rotational angular velocity, no rotating motion of the hub cavity fluid exists within the sealing ring [2 – 4]. Salvadori et al. [5] pointed out that the cavity flow behavior is a key parameter for the pressure field evaluation and then for the thrust calculation. Over the pump operating range the main contribution to the axial thrust is due to the impellers flow fields, the leakage flows through sealing rings and the pressure distribution that occurs inside the cavities between impeller shrouds and pump stationary walls. Test results on disk friction loss or axial thrust calculated in terms of the theoretical formula in fluid flow velocity in the shroud cavity did not match the results of practical tests [6]. To calculate the axial thrust of centrifugal pump with higher accuracy, Liu et al. [7, 8] developed a mathematical model of the shroud cavity liquid pressure on the design condition by simplifying the Navier–Stokes equations for the movement of cavity fluid. The results of liquid pressure test verified the reliability of the model. The study of Mu et al. [9] showed that the pump clearance leakage flow has significant influence on the flow field in the hub plate crown. The angular velocity of the fluid in the back shroud cavity is less than 0.5 times the angular velocity of impeller. Besides, compared with the experiment result, the axial thrust was found underestimated by the conventional formula. Research has shown that both cavities velocity field in the shroud and hub and the axial changing laws in the centrifugal pump are similar to the velocity field in the enclosed cylinder body [10 – 12]. That is, in the fluid flow velocity of the shroud and hub cavities, a turbulent boundary layer exists near the outer wall of the rotating impeller back shroud. Near the internal wall of the fixed motionless <b>pump</b> <b>shroud,</b> a flow core zone exists along the axial direction without significant changes between two boundary layers [13 – 15]. The flow core zone is the main region of fluid within the shroud and hub cavities. It occupies over two-thirds of the axial distance, whereby the fluid flow conditions within the shroud and hub cavities can be reflected.|$|E

40|$|The {{following}} {{equipment is}} commonly used to mix fluids: mechanical agitators, jets (<b>pumps),</b> <b>shrouded</b> axial impeller mixers (Flygt mixers), spargers, pulsed jet mixers, boiling, static mixers, falling films, liquid sprays, and thermal convection. This discussion will focus on mechanical agitators, jets, shrouded axial impeller mixers, spargers, and pulsed jet mixers, as these devices {{are most likely to}} be employed in Savannah River Site (SRS) Closure Business applications. In addressing mixing problems in the SRS Tank Farm, one must distinguish between different mixing objectives. These objectives include sludge mixing (e. g., Extended Sludge Processing), sludge retrieval (e. g., sludge transfers between tanks), heel retrieval (e. g., Tanks 18 F and 19 F), chemical reactions (e. g., oxalic acid neutralization) and salt dissolution. For example, one should not apply sludge mixing guidelines to heel removal applications. Mixing effectiveness is a function of both the mixing device (e. g., slurry pump, agitator, air sparger) and the properties of the material to be mixed (e. g., yield stress, viscosity, density, and particle size). The objective of this document is to provide background mixing knowledge for the SRS Closure Business Unit personnel and to provide general recommendations for mixing in SRS applications...|$|R

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. This study provides laser velocimetry measurements of the flow field within a centrifugal pump. The <b>pump</b> had a <b>shrouded</b> impeller of 254 mm diameter with five blades of backswept design. Measurements were made using a laser-two-focus (L 2 F) velocimetry system, both within the rotating impeller passages and in the pump volute. Both design operating conditions and off-design conditions were investigated. A comparison was made with a previous study, wherein measurements of the flow field were completed within the same pump, with an open face impeller. The absolute velocity, relative velocity, and turbulence kinetic energy levels were measured. The flow field within the impeller passages for the shrouded case was notably more uniform than for the unshrouded case. In addition, the turbulence kinetic energy within the passages was substantially lower. The efficiency of the <b>shrouded</b> <b>pump</b> was, however, lower than the unshrouded version. This was attributed primarily to losses due to leakage in the clearance region between the impeller <b>shroud</b> and the <b>pump</b> casing; a rather large passage was necessary to permit optical access. Velocimetry measurements were successfully made in the clearance region, and a leakage flow calculation was made...|$|R
40|$|The {{investigation}} was undertaken {{to analyze the}} effectiveness of devices for artificially destratifying lakes. A criterion for the effectiveness of mixing was selected. This criterion was applied {{to a number of}} variations of mechanical mixing devices in an attempt to indicate trends in optimization of designs. Experiments were performed in a vertically exaggerated scale model of Ham's Lake. Destratification was accomplished by a jet of water from two different sizes of propellers in different configurations (shrouded, skirted, and free) miXing the top water with the bottom water. Data taken from the experiments included density profiles as a function of time. The data obtained were analyzed determining the progression of the stability index with time. Adequate simulation of the prototype destratification experi-ments of Steichen (10) was achieved with the present model. The appropriate non-dimensional parameters are the overall Richardson number J • g~pH/pU 2. and a characteristic time obtained from the volume of the lake divided by the volume flow rate of the pump. AnalyZing the effects of varying propeller size and geometrical con-straints on mixing efficiency revealed the following facts: Operation of a <b>pump</b> with a <b>shrouded</b> propeller resulted in a shorter destrati-fication time and higher destratification efficiency than an unshrouded propeller when both pumps had the same power consumption rates. For the pump system operating with an unshrouded propeller increasing propeller size resulted in increased destratification efficiency over the shaft input power range studies.

40|$|Pumps {{are among}} the most spread {{machines}} in industrial facilities. In this work a comparative CFD analysis using different software is presented. The three-dimensional flow in the semi-open impeller and volute of a centrifugal pump is numerically simulated. The main advantage of semi-open impeller centrifugal pump is its efficiency which can be considered constant thanks to the clearance adjustment. In addition this kind of impeller is less likely to clog with solid bodies (important in case of slurry-processing). The open impeller has all the parts visible, so it is easier to inspect for wear and damages. Eventually it is lighter than a shrouded impeller: it can spin faster. The stress due to centrifugal force is indeed a limit for the speed of this machines. On the other hand its main disadvantage if compared to a <b>shrouded</b> <b>pump</b> is its lower efficiency due to the heavier tip leakage. In addition it cannot be employed in case of explosive products: the risk of contact between impeller and volute causing sparks is not negligible. The simulations have been carried out using both open-source and proprietary software: OpenFOAM®, PumpLinx ® and ANSYS-CFX ®. The performance of the machine handling both Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids are also investigated. The numerical models and the results of the different computational strategies were compared with the experimental data and the accuracy of different software is evaluated in the case of Newtonian model. It is well known that the performance of a centrifugal pump drops processing a viscous fluid. Even so the behavior during the pumping of non-Newtonian fluids has not been investigated so far. The non-Newtonian fluid processed is a shear-thinning fluid (the apparent viscosity decreases with an increase stress). The slurries which are usually processed in the food industries, chemical plants and oil&gas processes show a usual behavior which correspond to this kind of model...|$|R
40|$|An {{analysis}} is developed for a compressible bulk-flow {{model of the}} leakage path between a centrifugal compressor's impeller shroud and housing along {{the front and back}} side of the impeller. This is an extension of analysis performed first by Childs (1989) for a <b>shrouded</b> <b>pump</b> impeller and its housing considering an incompressible fluid, and then later by Cao (1993) using a compressible bulk flow model for the shroud of a cryogenic fluid pump. The bulk-flow model is used to develop a reaction force and moment model for the shroud of a centrifugal compressor by solving the derived governing equations and integrating the pressure and shear stress distribution. Validation is done by comparing the results to published measured moment coefficients by Yoshida et al. (1996). The comparison shows that the shroud casing clearance flow and the fluid force moment can be simulated by the bulk flow model fairly well. An Iwatsubo-based labyrinth seal code developed by Childs and Scharrer (1986) is used to calculate the rotordynamic coefficients developed by the labyrinth seals in the compressor. Tangential force and transverse moment components acting on the rotor are found to have a destabilizing influence on the rotor for a range of precession frequencies. Rotordynamic coefficients are derived for a single stage of a multistage centrifugal compressor, and a comparison is made to stability predictions using Wachel's coefficient using the XLTRC (rotordynamic FEA code). For the model employed, Wachel's model predicts a slightly lower onset speed of instability. The results also show that leakage that flows radially inwards on the back shroud has a greater destabilizing influence than leakage flow that is radially outwards. Seal rub conditions are simulated by increasing the clearance and simultaneously decreasing the tooth height, which increased the leakage and the swirl tothe eye seal inlet; and therefore reduced stability. Calculated results are provided for different seal clearances and tooth height, for seal and shroud forces and moments...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{the authors}} compare {{optimized}} pump per-formance of a spiral groove viscous <b>pump</b> with a <b>shrouded</b> Rayleigh-step viscous <b>pump</b> {{as well as}} with. the semicircular multilobe viscous pump (Etsion and Yaier, 1988). Their {{results show that the}} spiral groove and Rayleigh-step viscous pumps are comparable to each other and that both pumps produce higher flow rates than the multilobe viscous pump for the operating conditions (as represented by AP/A) investigated. The optimization of the multilobe viscous pump performed by Etsion and Yaier (1988) is limited and is revised in Mainland and Green (1991). Figure A-l duplicates Fig. 10, the pump performance curve, and shows that the revised multilobe op-timization still results in less pumping capability than the spiral groove viscous pump. An improvement to the multilobe vis-cous pump is the V-lobe viscous pump of Mainland and Green (1991). Still, the best possible V-lobe pump, which has nine lobes for the operating conditions shown, is outperformed by the spiral groove pump as shown in Fig. A-l. Note, however, that the pumps are compared for a relatively large value of the operating conditions parameter, AP/A. These large values correspond for example to those that would be encountered in gas applications. For liquid applications, the operating con-ditions parameter could be much smaller due to the relatively larger viscosity. Optimization of the spiral groove viscous pump (Eq. (1)) was reproduced by the discussers and was extended over a larger range of AP/A as shown in Fig. A- 2. Figure A- 2 also shows a comparison of the viscous pumps over the larger range of the operating conditions parameter. The pumping capabilities of the semicircular lobe is consistently lower than the spiral groove and V-lobe viscous pumps. Although the comparison between spiral groove and V-lobe pumps depends on the number of lobes selected for the V-lobe, in general it can be concluded that at relatively large values of the operating conditions parameter (e. g., gas applications) the spiral groove performs the best. At lower values of the operating condition...|$|R
40|$|Lecturepg. 1 For {{applications}} that involved fluids {{with a high}} rate of change of vapor pressure or low specific heat, it was found that there could be inadequate flow through the thrust bearing. This effect was compounded by the heat generation due to the eddy currents that occur in magnetic drive pumps with metallic shells. This paper describes a computer simulation to predict the flows, pressures, and temperatures in magnetic drive sealless pumps. The program has been developed using both theoretical and test work. The objective of the program was to provide reliable selection of magnetic drive pumps; this was accomplished by taking into account the effects of viscosity, vapor pressure, and other liquid properties on the local pressures in the pump. The goal of this program was thus to simulate a customer?s desired application of a particular fluid at an operating pressure, temperature, NPSH, and speed. The resulting conclusion would be whether the customer?s fluid and operating conditions were applicable for sealless pumps. Warnings are output through the graphical user interface of the program at the various points, should flashing occur using the particular fluid. The testing involved a wide range of pump sizes. Within each size, an extensive matrix involved running at different speeds, different cut impeller diameters, and from shutoff through runout condition. The units were tested with different shell configurations and different materials. These included polyetheretherketone (known as PEEK), Alloy C- 276, and a dual containment consisting of both materials. The design of the back shroud influences the magnitude of the hub factor. This is because the traditional affinity laws cannot be applied to the calculation of the axial load for semiopen impeller with a scalloped back <b>shroud,</b> <b>pump</b> out vanes, or pump out slots. One of the important findings was that the impeller hub factor, which is required for the computation of the axial load, changed as a function of speed and cut impeller diameter. It was also found that pump out vanes or pump out slots significantly enhanced the lubrication through the bearings and across magnets. Part of the verification involved performing tests with different bushing clearances and grooving configurations. These were analyzed empirically to confirm the coefficients that were obtained from experimental methods. In order to examine the possible operation of the pump when handling the user?s particular fluid, the flow is simulated in the program using a graphical user interface. A graphical output is given of all the pertinent locations in the systems, such as the thrust collar face or the gap between the driven magnets and the shell. The program currently calculates the pressure, flow, and temperature within the flowpath, along with the axial thrust, at five pump operating flow conditions expressed {{as a percentage of the}} best efficiency point...|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} the computational steps involved in executing a finite-element-based perturbation model for computing the rotor dynamic coefficients of a <b>shrouded</b> <b>pump</b> impeller or a simple seal. These {{arise from the}} fluid/rotor interaction in the clearance gap. In addition to the sample cases, the computational procedure also applies to a separate category of problems {{referred to as the}} 'seal-like' category. The problem, in this case, concerns a shrouded impeller, with the exception that the secondary, or leakage, passage is totally isolated from the primary-flow passage. The difference between this and the pump problem is that the former is analytically of the simple 'seal-like' configuration, with two (inlet and exit) flow-permeable stations, while the latter constitutes a double-entry / double-discharge flow problem. In all cases, the problem is that of a rotor clearance gap. The problem here is that of a rotor excitation {{in the form of a}} cylindrical whirl around the housing centerline for a smooth annular seal. In its centered operation mode, the rotor is assumed to give rise to an axisymmetric flow field in the clearance gap. As a result, problems involving longitudinal or helical grooves, in the rotor or housing surfaces, go beyond the code capabilities. Discarding, for the moment, the pre- and post-processing phases, the bulk of the computational procedure consists of two main steps. The first is aimed at producing the axisymmetric 'zeroth-order' flow solution in the given flow domain. Detailed description of this problem, including the flow-governing equations, turbulence closure, boundary conditions, and the finite-element formulation, was covered by Baskharone and Hensel. The second main step is where the perturbation model is implemented, with the input being the centered-rotor 'zeroth-order' flow solution and a prescribed whirl frequency ratio (whirl frequency divided by the impeller speed). The computational domain, in the latter case, is treated as three dimensional, with the number of computational planes in the circumferential direction being specified a priori. The reader is reminded that the deformations in the finite elements are all infinitesimally small because the rotor eccentricity itself is a virtual displacement. This explains why we have generically termed the perturbation model the 'virtually' deformable finite-element category. The primary outcome of implementing the perturbation model is the tangential and radial components, F(sub theta) (sup *) and F(sub r) (sup *) of the fluid-exerted force on the rotor surface due to the whirling motion. Repetitive execution of the perturbation model subprogram over a sufficient range of whirl frequency ratios, and subsequent interpolation of these fluid forces, using the least-square method, finally enable the user to compute the impeller rotor dynamic coefficients of the fluid/rotor interaction. These are the direct and cross-coupled stiffness, damping, and inertia effects of the fluid/rotor interaction...|$|R
