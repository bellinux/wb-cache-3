40|$|Intake {{system is}} one of the crucial sub-systems in engine which can inflict {{significant}} effect on the air-fuel mixing, combustion, fuel consumption, as well as exhaust gases formation. There are many parameters that will influence engine performances. Good engine breathing is required to get better air flow rate to the engine. One of the methods includes the improvement of intake system by modifying the intake port design. This paper presents the application of Computational Fluid Dynamics analysis on two engines with different intake <b>port</b> <b>shapes.</b> Dimensionless parameters like discharge coefficient and flow coefficient are used to quantify the changes in intake flow at different valve lifts variation. Results show that when valve lift increases, this inflicted the increase in discharge coefficient because of greater mass flow rate of induction air. Both flow and discharge coefficient is dependent on valve lift. Flow analysis proved the relationship by computing the increase of flow coefficient as valve opening increase. The computed analysis shows that different intake <b>port</b> <b>shapes</b> does bring significant effect on discharge coefficient and flow coefficient...|$|R

These were simply short sections of metal pipe attached to the exhaust <b>ports,</b> <b>shaped</b> so that they would interact with the airstream to produce a jet of air that produced forward thrust.

Collectively these are known as stealth technology. Aircraft and ships can be shaped to reflect radar impulses away from the sender, and covered with radar-absorbing materials, to reduce their radar signature. [...] The use of heat-seeking missiles has also led to efforts to hide the heat signature of aircraft engines. Methods include exhaust <b>ports</b> <b>shaped</b> to mix hot exhaust gases with cold surrounding air, and placing the exhaust ports on the upper side of the airframe. Multi-spectral camouflage attempts to hide objects from detection methods such as infra-red, radar, and millimetre-wave imaging simultaneously.|$|R
5000|$|The head {{used during}} this time was the {{so-called}} [...] "rectangle port", named after its exhaust <b>port</b> <b>shape.</b> The 290 heads use smaller valves, 1.787 in intake and 1.406 in exhaust, {{in order to prevent}} problems with the small bore.

50|$|Measurement of the {{interior}} of the ports is difficult but must be done accurately. Sheet metal templates are made up, taking the shape from an experimental port, for both cross-sectional and lengthwise shape. Inserted in the port these templates are then used as a guide for shaping the final port. Even a slight error might cause a loss in flow so measurement must be as accurate as possible. Confirmation of the final <b>port</b> <b>shape</b> and automated replication of the port is now done using digitizing. Digitizing is where a probe scans the entire shape of the port collecting data that can then be used by CNC machine tools and CAD/CAM software programs to model and cut the desired <b>port</b> <b>shape.</b> This replication process usually produces ports that flow within 1% of each other. This kind of accuracy, repeatability, time has never before been possible. What used to take 18hrs. or more now takes less than 3hrs.|$|E
50|$|Until recently, CNC {{machining}} {{was used}} only {{to provide the}} basic shape of the port but hand finishing was usually still required because {{some areas of the}} port were not accessible to a CNC tool. New developments in CNC machining now allow this process to be fully automated with the assistance of CAD/CAM software. 5-Axis CNC controls using specialized fixtures like tilting rotary tables allow the cutting tool full access to the entire port. The combination of CNC and CAM software give the porter full control over the <b>port</b> <b>shape</b> and surface finish.|$|E

This novel water-pump could achieve change in-phase between flow rate and the passage areas of the intake and outlet ports. In order to completely achieve the in-phase change, the pressure that is assigned a fixed value in the piston chamber is optimized. On these grounds, the optimum shapes of the intake and outlet ports {{have been found to}} be rectangular according to theoretical analysis. The simulation results indicated that the optimum intake and outlet <b>port</b> <b>shapes</b> keeps the pressure in the piston chamber constant, and there is almost no pressure surge except for a very small pressure wave in the piston chamber.

2500|$|Scott's first {{experiments}} with a two-stroke {{were in a}} motor boat, where {{he was able to}} make tests and obtain 'diagrams' under working conditions. His first attempt at a motor cycle was fitting an engine of his own design to a Premier bicycle in 1901. This twin cylinder engine had steel cylinders with shrunk on aluminium radiator 'flanges', and drove the front wheel via friction directly to the tyre. He described the drive system as 'useless in the wet', and he could not prevent the cylinders from scoring. His next engine had cast iron cylinders of 2 1/4" [...] bore, and eventually drove by belt to clutch countershaft and then by chain to the rear wheel. Various ingenious ignition arrangements were used including link work driven by a pin placed mid-way on the connecting rod. In parallel to this he continued work on a 4" [...] bore, 4" [...] stroke marine engine which developed 10HP at 800rpm, fitted with a large water-cooled brake wheel (a dynamometer). By recording brake and indicator readings he was able to experiment with <b>port</b> <b>shapes</b> and piston shapes, developing the 'curved top' (deflector) piston.|$|R

50|$|The third-generation engine {{uses the}} (enthusiast-dubbed) Toyota CT20b turbo, which {{was of the}} same design as the second-generation but with a {{slightly}} improved turbine housing and larger compressor wheel. A factory BPV is installed on all applications. The intake charge is cooled by a water-to-air top-mounted intercooler similar in shape to the ST185RC WTA. One {{can tell the difference}} as the ST205 WTA is black while the ST185 WTA is silver with a black centre. This generation does away with T-VIS and uses a normal 4 runner intake with the same <b>port</b> <b>shape</b> and size as the NA engine (but with larger injector holes for side feed). The Air Flow Meter is also removed in favor of a MAP sensing system (prior generations used a MAP sensor only for the purpose of the factory boost gauge and determining overboost fuel cut). Various increases included injector size (540cc), boost (13psi), overboost fuel cut limit (18psi), intake cam lift (8.7mm), throttle body size (60mm), and a 10mm increase in exhaust ports. Exhaust valve lift is retained at 8.2mm. In late 1997, the block casting was revised with added support around the head to prevent block cracking problems. The CT20b turbo found in this generation is backwards compatible with the second generation motors, however not the first generation. Further improvements include a factory oil catch can. Compression is reduced down to 8.5:1 however power is improved to 245-255PS(242-251HP) and 304 N·m (224 lb-ft).|$|E
5000|$|In 1969 Pontiac created four {{versions}} of the Ram Air V engine: a 303 cuin L short deck version for SCCA Trans-Am racing, a 366 cuin L variant for NASCAR, a 400 cuin L version for street use in GTOs and Firebirds, {{as well as a}} 428 cuin L adaptation for drag racing. The cylinder head design is similar to the Ford FE tunnel-port head used in the GT40 and Can-Am series racing. So large are the intake ports that the pushrods run through the center of each port via pressed-in tubes, in addition to streamlined airfoils over the tubes themselves to improve <b>port</b> <b>shape,</b> and increase flow velocity. The 303 had shorter connecting rods, smaller 2.5 in journals and a solid lifter version of the Ram Air IV camshaft. It shared the 4.121 in bore of the 400, but with a 2.84 in stroke for a displacement of 303 cu in. The short deck engine weighed about 40 lb less than the other variants and had an 8000 rpm redline. Pontiac’s SCCA Trans-Am program was promising, with race-ready engines producing [...] to , however the series’ General Competition Rules required the manufacturer to produce no less than 250 vehicles with the 303. Plans were made to produce Firebirds and GTOs with advertised ratings of [...] and [...] respectively but concerns about emissions, the response of the automobile safety lobby, and the warranty implications of a high-revving street engine led to cancellation of the program [...] The total number of Ram Air V engines produced is not known and a handful of Ram Air V 303's may have made their way onto the Pontiac Firebird Trans Am assembly line. Only about 25 303 cu in engines were produced and about a dozen 428s and 366s. More 400 cu in engines were produced by Pontiac than the other versions - estimates range from 80 to 200 units. Quite a few 400s were dealer installed. Ram Air V engines are extremely rare and parts are not readily available.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The present research describes {{an investigation of the}} flow through the inlet port and the cylinder of an internal combustion engine. The principal aim of the work is to interpret the effects of the <b>port</b> <b>shape</b> and valve lift on the engine's "breathing" characteristics, and to develop a better understanding of flow and turbulence behaviour through the use of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), using a commercial available package STAR-CD.

Predictions have been carried out for both steady and transient flows. For steady flow, the influence of valve lift and <b>port</b> <b>shape</b> on discharge coefficient and the in-cylinder flow pattern has been examined. Surface static pressures predicted using the CFD code, providing a useful indicator of flow separation within the port/cylinder assembly, are presented and compared with experimental data.

When fully developed this propulsion technology has the potential to act as a "drop in " replacement for propulsion system utilizing hazardous propellants such as hydrazine.

Using FDM overcomes multiple technical issues frequently associated with hybrid propulsion systems. Issues include low-output-rate manufacturing, a lack of system restartability, and poor volumetric efficiency. FDM reduces development and production costs by supporting high production rates across a wide range of form factors. Using FDM, thermoplastic fuel grains can be fabricated with <b>port</b> <b>shapes</b> that enhance burn properties and increase volumetric efficiencies. Most significantly, because FDM-processing builds the specimen one layer at a time, most thermo-plastic materials fabricated via FDM possess unique electrical breakdown properties that greatly enhance system ignitability and restartabilty. When FDM-processed fuel materials are subjected to a high-voltage inductive charge, an electrical-arc develops along the layered material surface and Joule heating produces a small amount of pyrolized vapor.

40|$|People have {{redesigned}} coastlines, creating <b>ports,</b> <b>shaping</b> waterfronts, {{and building}} cities to connect water and land. Specialists from many disciplines have explored the function {{and design of}} the water–land transition over many centuries. Among them is planning, a discipline that engages both with the functionality of working ports and {{the design of the}} waterfront for the urban public. In order to explore the development of working ports and the revitalization of abandoned inner-city waterfronts since the 1960 s, this paper reviews planning and planning history literature in regard to the specific appreciation of water. It first examines the planning of ports and its focus on improving the speed, safety, and logistics, assigning water an industrial role. Second, it reflects on the design of post-industrial waterfront spaces, which ascribes a more aesthetic and symbolic as well as leisure-related role to water. Third, it points to the recent reconnection of cruise shipping with inner-city waterfront redevelopment and the coastline in general. In conclusion, the paper underscores localized perceptions of water in planning literature and the need to recognize how interconnected water systems connect otherwise separated areas along the same coastline. It argues for the integrated planning of port, waterfront, and city in conjunction with a comprehensive study of the environmental and ecological role of water in each of those places, both as a resource they share and, with climate change, a risk to which they must collectively respond.
