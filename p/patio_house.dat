40|$|GENE_ARCH is a Generative Design System that {{combines}} Pareto Genetic Algorithms with an advanced building energy simulation engine. This work explores its integration with a Shape Grammar, acting as GENE_ARCHís shape generation module. The urban <b>patio</b> <b>house</b> typology is readdressed in a contemporary context, both by improving its energy-effi ciency standards, and by rethinking {{its role in}} the genesis of high-density urban areas, while respecting its specifi c spatial organization and cultural grounding. Field work was carried out in Marrakesh, surveying a number of patio houses which became the Corpus of Design, from where a Shape Grammar was extracted. The computational implementation of the <b>patio</b> <b>house</b> grammar was done within GENE_ARCH. The resulting program was able to generate new, alternative patio houses designs that were more energy effi cient, while respecting the traditional rules captured from the analysis of existing houses. After the computational system was fully implemented, it was possible to complete different sets of experiments. The first experiments kept more restrained rules, thus generating new designs that closer resembled the existing ones. The progressive relaxation of rules and constraints allowed for a larger number of variations to emerge. Analysis of energy results provide insight into the main patterns resulting from the evolutionary search processes, namely in terms of form factors of generated solutions, and urban densities achieved...|$|E

On the basis of field survey and analysis on prescribed regulations, this paper points out {{the findings of the}} most representative ordinances. Both cities share similar features as the location of the most important religious and political buildings and infrastructures; Royal Street as a main road of colonial city and <b>patio</b> <b>house</b> as the most representative example of colonial housing. Even though, both cities are based on the same design regulation, they show different forms of blocks layout where no one of them exactly followed the established dimensions.

50|$|In 1955 {{work began}} on the Gleadless Valley housing estate and would {{continue}} until 1962. Farmland was bought up by Sheffield City Council by compulsory purchase order and the three districts of the new Gleadless Valley estate were named after the former farms of Herdings, Hemsworth and Rollestone. The project was planned to accommodate 17000 residents and was overseen by the city architect J.L. Womersley. The housing is diverse and includes tower blocks, maisonettes of various designs, three storey <b>patio</b> <b>houses</b> and more conventional houses with flat roofs as well as apartments for the elderly. One of the main challenges for Womersley when designing the scheme was the rolling terrain of the area, with slopes averaging 1 in 8 and reaching 1 in 4 in places. He overcame this by using <b>patio</b> <b>houses,</b> chalet-type housing and blocks of cluster houses which could be varied in design to suit the slope. The way that the housing was built impressively on {{the contours of the}} land and the retention of the ancient woodland is the reason that the Gleadless Valley project is held in such high esteem.|$|R

40|$|The {{goal of the}} {{described}} {{research is}} an interactive computer system {{for the design of}} customized mass housing. Shape grammars are the formalism proposed to systematize the design rules required for such a system. A shape grammar for Alvaro Siza's <b>patio</b> <b>houses</b> at Malagueira, a 1200 -unit development still being designed and constructed today, is presented. The grammar is based on the corpus of thirty-five houses designed between 1977 and 1996. The generation of houses in the grammar proceeds by the recursive dissection of rectangles locating four different functional zones (patio, living, services, and sleeping) and the key placement of the staircase. The schematic generations of two existing houses and the detailed generation of a novel one illustrate the grammar. ...|$|R
50|$|Mary-Jane Buschlen, a {{resident}} of Cottage Grove quoted in the Houston Chronicle {{said that there were}} no new townhouses being built in Cottage Grove in 1995. She also said that flooding had never occurred before the early 1990s. As of 2005 the neighborhood had not yet been completely built out, contrasting with other area neighborhoods. Due to an increase in demand, around that year, developers began building new houses in Cottage Grove. The new <b>housing</b> styles included <b>patio</b> <b>houses</b> and townhouses. In a two-year period ending in May 2005, land prices increased from $9 ($ in current money) per square foot to $20 ($ in current money) per square foot. This would be an increase in $100,000 for a 5000 sq ft lot. In 2005 some houses were priced up to $280,000 ($ in current money).|$|R

50|$|The Casa de los Once <b>Patios</b> (<b>House</b> of Eleven Courtyards) was {{constructed}} in 1742 for Dominican nuns {{of the order of}} Santa Catarina de Sena. They gradually expanded the initial building by buying adjacent houses, which is why the complex once had eleven courtyards, but now that is down to only five. In the west corridor, the oldest part of the complex, there is a fountain and a Baroque portal leading to a room that had a bathtub with hot and cold running water, a rare luxury at the time. In the 1960s, the complex was restored and since then has functioned as workshops and stores for local crafts. The workshops include those that make shawls and lacquered items. Behind the Casa de los Once Patios is the Pila de San Miguel. According to legend, the devil was bothering the women who were coming here to get water. To scare the devil away, Vasco de Quiroga put the image of the Archangel Michael there.|$|R

40|$|The {{first thing}} we did was to push up a leaf of paper to form a {{continuous}} roof. "Fold, make creases, but don't cut" is the topological credo. Then, {{in an effort to}} follow a natural dynamic, which is [in] the leaf, we tried to get close to the triangular site conditions, also by making a few sketches at the side. Individual houses are fit in, as if they were hung from our continuous roof. On can read this in the jumps of the floors. The overall building takes the shape of a square in a triangle. One may wonder whether such a form ranges under the category of 'non-things' or 'antinomy'. It is how philosopher Emmanuel Kant labeled 'things that can't be imagined'. In the same category we already shaped an office building by projecting a square into a circle (Amersfoort, The Netherlands). Because the building takes on arbitrary wedge-shaped forms around a square (with a parking beneath) we have trimmed the individual houses. Their proportion changes from shallow and wide to narrow and deep (<b>patio)</b> <b>houses</b> at opposite sides of the wedge. status: publishe...|$|R

The first {{generation}} houses, which were {{constructed in the}} late 1970s, include contemporary <b>house</b> and <b>patio</b> <b>houses.</b> In 2003 Nancy Scott, {{a real estate agent}} of John Daugherty, Realtors West Houston, stated that these houses had [...] "more-modern kitchens and baths than most houses had" [...] in the late 1970s and that [...] "they were very innovative in their designs". 1980s-built <b>houses</b> included traditional <b>patio</b> and [...] "soft contemporary houses". Houses built in the early 1990s included two-story traditional brick houses. The 1990s houses were priced from $140,000 ($ according to inflation) to $200,000 ($ according to inflation), or beginning at $70 ($ according to inflation) per square foot; these houses were more inexpensive compared to those in the nearby gated [...] "Parkway" [...] communities.

40|$|In the Mediterranean area, {{since the}} early civilizations, the {{courtyard}} house was the most prevalent architectural typology. Also known as <b>patio</b> <b>houses,</b> spatial organization in these dwellings is defined by a central open-air space from which the living rooms are generated. The house has an introverted layout; the rooms are disposed surrounding an internal courtyard, the overriding architectural feature. The courtyard is the generator space of all the residential cells, opened toward it, and represents the central core of the house, its principal unit. Still the courtyard allows the natural ventilation and enlightenment of the house's internal space. Courtyards {{have been used in}} several dwelling types according to each climatic region and to the local culture it belongs; the architecture of the courtyard house varies depending upon geography, religion, or ethnic culture, economic conditions, the extension and morphological structure of the site and the regularity of the urban system. Its widespread acceptance is due to its capacity of response to various environmental, social and cultural requirements. The architectural layout of the courtyard house provides the dwelling with an inner open space that functions as a distribution element, as well as a cloister opened to the sky while protecting it from environmental threats. The essay provides a recognition of the typologies usage from the origin to the roman Domus, to the islamic courtyard house, to the main variants of the courtyard house in the Mediterranean Region, till the courtyard house as a model for future resilient housing...|$|R
