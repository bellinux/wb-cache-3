The CONWIP <b>pull</b> <b>production</b> <b>system</b> is an alternative to pure push and pure pull systems that lowers and controls inventory levels and reduces production lead time. In this study, a CONWIP <b>pull</b> <b>production</b> <b>system</b> was simulated {{in place of the}} current push production system at a food packaging company. ARENA 12. 0 simulation software was used and a production system with two dedicated production lines was proposed to reduce the current system's complexity. A method for obtaining the optimum CONWIP level was determined. Various advantages of the CONWIP <b>pull</b> <b>production</b> <b>system</b> were analyzed and it was found that besides a reduction in planning complexity, the proposed two dedicated lines with CONWIP <b>pull</b> <b>production</b> <b>system</b> can also help the company to greatly reduce their total WIP and achieve inventory holding costs savings of over S$ 38, 000 per month. In addition, the total customer lead time can also be reduced from 12 days to 10 days while still meeting customer demand. by Jean Jingying Liu. Thesis (M. Eng.)

Since the problem is NP-hard, a modified memetic algorithm is proposed for solving the models. In this algorithm, the method of generating the initial population, the local search procedures, the selection, crossover and mutation operators are newly designed.

40|$|A low {{inventory}} {{with high}} availability {{is the primary}} objective for make-to-stock production plants. Thus, production plants must choose between two approaches, a push production system or a <b>pull</b> <b>production</b> <b>system.</b> Despite {{the simplicity of the}} pull system, and numerous reports of successful implementation, the push system remains prevalent. Interviews with local managers reveal two obstacles to implementing pull systems: (1) lack of a precise definition for pull systems, and a general ignorance among managers regarding the concept of pull systems. As a result, some managers may believe they are running a pull system when they are actually using a push system; (2) lack of confidence in the ability of a pull system to handle significant demand variability. This study designs a make-to-stock production plant game to enable managers to determine whether: (1) they are using a push or a pull system; and (2) a pull system is superior to a push system, even under significant demand variability. The results support our belief that most participating managers still use a push system, and demonstrate that a pull system is superior. We anticipate that {{the results of this study}} will increase the willingness of make-to-stock companies and make-to-order companies (especially fashion product manufacturers) to re-examine the potential benefits of implementing a pull system, and encourage them to assess whether such a move is suitable...|$|E

This study defines the factors influencing the success of electronic kanban systems and describes how they should be taken into account in the planning process. First the differences of traditional kanban and electronic kanbans are analyzed from a theoretical point of view.

The electronic kanban system planning principles and ideas defined are analyzed and described in more detail in the practical case context. The case study presented describes the electronic kanban systems basic ideas, the planning process and problems found. In addition, the user centered design (UCD) process utilized and its influence on the outcome are described more closely.

A {{variety of}} {{production}} systems {{appearing in the}} literature are reviewed {{in order to develop}} a classification scheme for production systems. A number of pull production systems appearing in the classification are found to be equivalent to a tandem queue so that accurate tandem queue decomposition methods can be used to find the performance of such systems. The primary concern of this dissertation is to model and analyze non-tandem queue equivalent periodic pull production systems. In this research, an exact performance evaluation model is developed for a singleitem periodic <b>pull</b> <b>production</b> <b>system.</b> The processing and demand interarrival times are assumed to be Markovian. For large systems, which are difficult to evaluate exactly because of large state spaces involved, an approximate decomposition method is proposed. A typical approximate decomposition procedure takes individual stages or pairs of stages in isolation to analyze the system and then it aggregates the results to obtain an approximate performance for the whole system. An experiment is designed in order to investigate the general behavior of the decomposition. The results are worth attention. A second aspect {{of this study is to}} investigate an allocation methodology to achieve the maximum throughput rate with providing two sets of allocation parameters regarding the number of kanbans and the workload at each stage of the system. Together with some structural properties, the experimental results provide some insight into the behavior of pull production systems and also provide a basis for the proposed allocation methodology.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to formulate a mathematical model for a <b>pull</b> <b>production</b> <b>system,</b> and to obtain the optimal, or near-optimal, arrangement of its workstations. The proposed system is a flow shop type production line with a limited number of products. It includes N number of workstations and N - 1 interstage buffers. Workstations may be allocated to any stage (position) in the production line, and have a different processing rate at each stage. The size of interstage buffers also varies within different arrangements of workstations. The production line is an open system, where all items enter at the first workstation and leave only at the last workstation. It is an unbalanced production line with finite interstage buffers and unreliable workstations in a pull manufacturing environment. The mathematical model defines the expected total cost of production per item of the finished product. It refers to the allocation of workstations for the proposed system. Costs considered in the model relate to the position of workstations, and include operational, inventory holding, and production shortage costs. Other costs, such as those for materials, and management are not considered because they remain constant for different allocations of workstations. This research uses two search algorithms, genetic algorithm and simulated annealing, to search for a near-optimal allocation of workstations in the production line. These two search algorithms will be applied, and their performances will be compared and studied. Dept. of Industrial and Manufacturing Systems Engineering.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a unified framework for <b>pull</b> <b>production</b> control mechanisms in multi-stage manufacturing <b>systems.</b> A <b>pull</b> <b>production</b> control mechanism in a multi-stage manufacturing {{system is a}} mechanism that coordinates the release of parts into each stage of the system {{with the arrival of}} customer demands for final products. Four basic <b>pull</b> <b>production</b> control mechanisms are presented: Base Stock, Kanban, Generalized Kanban, and Extended Kanban. It is argued that on top of any of these basic coordination mechanisms, a local mechanism to control the work-in-process in each stage may be superimposed. Several cases of basic stage coordination mechanisms with stage work-in-process control are presented, and several <b>production</b> control <b>systems</b> that have appeared in the literature are shown to be equivalent to some of these cases...|$|R
40|$|Companies doing {{individual}} production face special challenges: {{high number}} of variants with low production quantities each combined with late modification by the customers. Therefore the production of materials and intermediate products differs from standards in mass production. Classic MRP II (reducing setup time by merging orders to batches) causes long storage time, high inventory costs and long lead times. Lean <b>production</b> <b>pull</b> <b>systems</b> do not work for individual production because they base upon a stable repetitive environment which is in conflict with individual production. Therefore in many cases a specialized Just-in- Time (JIT) production is preferable. Currently there is no suitable tool to support JIT production in individual production. This article describes the fundamental problem as well a solution approach...|$|R

This paper describes multiple ways to model <b>pull</b> <b>production</b> control and compares them on measures related to model construction and execution. A kanban workstation module significantly reduces the time required to develop a <b>pull</b> <b>production</b> model, which makes simulation more useful as a decision-making tool in rapid improvement events. ...|$|R
