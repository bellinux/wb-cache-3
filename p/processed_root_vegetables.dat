40|$|The use of {{suitable}} sanitizers {{can increase}} the quality of fresh-cut produce and {{reduce the risk of}} foodborne illnesses. The objective {{of this study was to}} compare the washing effects of 100 mg/L sodium hypochlorite (SH) and 500 mg/L acidified sodium chlorite (ASC) on the prevention of enzymatic browning and the growth of micro-bial populations, including aerobic plate counts, E. coli, and coliforms, throughout storage at 4 oC and 10 oC. Fresh-cut zucchini, cucumbers, green bell peppers, and root vegetables such as potatoes, sweet potatoes, carrots, and radishes were used. Compared to SH washing, ASC washing significantly (p 0. 05) reduced microbial con-tamination on the fresh-cut produce and prevented browning of fresh-cut potatoes and sweet potatoes during storage. More effective inhibition of aerobic plate counts and coliforms growth was observed on fresh-cut produce treated with ASC during storage at 10 oC. Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity of fresh-cut potatoes and sweet pota-toes was more effectively inhibited after washing with ASC. The use of 500 mg/L ASC can provide effective antimicrobial and anti-browning treatments of fresh-cut produce, including <b>processed</b> <b>root</b> <b>vegetables...</b>|$|E

5000|$|The Fore diet {{consists}} of pigs, small animals, insects, wild plants, and <b>root</b> <b>vegetables</b> such as taro. [...] <b>Root</b> <b>vegetables</b> are cultivated on land cleared by slash-and-burn farming. After {{the introduction of}} the sweet potato roughly 150 years ago, food production increased, as the crop could be grown in harsher conditions than existing <b>root</b> <b>vegetables.</b> Around the same time, the Fore began domesticating pigs, replacing the need to hunt wild ones. The sweet potato not only became a staple food, but was used as feed for domesticated pigs.|$|R
40|$|Chlordecone, an {{organochlorine}} insecticide, {{continues to}} pollute soils in the French West Indies. The {{main source of}} human exposure to this pollutant is food. <b>Root</b> <b>vegetables,</b> which are staple foods in tropical regions, can be highly contaminated and are thus a very effective lever for action to reduce consumer exposure. We analyzed chlordecone contamination in three <b>root</b> <b>vegetables,</b> yam, dasheen and sweet potato, which are among the main sources of chlordecone exposure in food in the French West Indies. All soil types {{do not have the}} same potential for the contamination of <b>root</b> <b>vegetables,</b> allophanic andosols being two to ten times less contaminating than non-allophanic nitisols and ferralsols. This difference was only partially explained by the higher OC content in allophanic soils. Dasheen corms were shown to accumulate more chlordecone than yam and sweet potato tubers. The physiological nature of the <b>root</b> <b>vegetable</b> may explain this difference. Our results are in good agreement with the hypothesis that chlordecone uptake by <b>root</b> <b>vegetables</b> is based on passive and diffusive processes and limited by transport and dilution during growth.

50|$|Jains make {{considerable}} efforts not {{to injure}} plants {{in everyday life}} as far as possible. Jains only accept such violence inasmuch as it is indispensable for human survival, and there are special instructions for preventing unnecessary violence against plants. Strict Jains don’t eat <b>root</b> <b>vegetables</b> such as potatoes, onions, roots and tubers, because such <b>root</b> <b>vegetables</b> are considered ananthkay. Ananthkay means one body, but containing countless lives. A regular vegetable such as cabbage has number of leaves and lives as could be counted by a layman. However, a <b>root</b> <b>vegetable</b> such as potato, though {{from the looks of}} it is one article, is said to contain multiple lives ('ekindriya') in it. Also, tiny life forms are injured when the plant is pulled up and because the bulb is seen as a living being, as it is able to sprout. Also, consumption of most <b>root</b> <b>vegetables</b> involves uprooting and killing the entire plant, whereas consumption of most terrestrial vegetables doesn't kill the plant (it lives on after plucking the vegetables or it was seasonally supposed to wither away anyway).|$|R
