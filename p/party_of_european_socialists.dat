5|$|Given {{that the}} Parliament does not form the {{government}} in the traditional sense of a Parliamentary system, its politics have developed along more consensual lines rather than majority rule of competing parties and coalitions. Indeed, for much of its life it has been dominated by a grand coalition of the European People's Party and the <b>Party</b> <b>of</b> <b>European</b> <b>Socialists.</b> The two major parties tend to co-operate to find a compromise between their two groups leading to proposals endorsed by huge majorities. However, this does not always produce agreement, and each may instead try to build other alliances, the EPP normally with other centre-right or right wing Groups and the PES with centre-left or left wing Groups. Sometimes, the Liberal Group is then in the pivotal position. There are also occasions where very sharp party political divisions have emerged, for example over the resignation of the Santer Commission.|$|E

500|$|There {{have been}} a number of {{proposals}} designed to attract greater public attention to the elections. One such innovation in the 2014 elections was that the pan-European political parties fielded [...] "candidates" [...] for president of the Commission, the so-called Spitzenkandidaten (German, [...] "leading candidate). However, European Union governance is based on a mixture of intergovernmental and supranational features: the President of the European Commission is nominated by the European Council, representing the governments of the member states, and there is no obligation for them to nominate the successful [...] "candidate". The Lisbon Treaty merely states that they should take account of the results of the elections when choosing whom to nominate. The so-called Spitzenkandidaten were [...] Jean-Claude Juncker for the European People's Party, Martin Schulz for the <b>Party</b> <b>of</b> <b>European</b> <b>Socialists,</b> Guy Verhofstadt for the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party, Ska Keller and José Bové jointly for the European Green Party and Alexis Tsipras for the Party of the European Left.|$|E
