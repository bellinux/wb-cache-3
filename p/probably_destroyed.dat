5|$|Finucane's {{first victory}} was scored on 12 August 1940 during the Battle of Britain. During the campaign, he was {{credited}} with two enemies destroyed, two <b>probably</b> <b>destroyed</b> and one damaged. Promoted to acting flight lieutenant in April 1941, he joined No. 452 Squadron flying offensive patrols over France—known as the Circus offensive. During this period, Finucane had his most successful period of operations, destroying 20 German aircraft, sharing {{in the destruction of}} three, with two damaged and another two <b>probably</b> <b>destroyed</b> from 4 January to 13 October 1941.|$|E
5|$|Lock {{continued}} to shoot enemy aircraft down regularly. On 14 September he recorded two victories over Bf 109s {{and the following}} day shared {{in the destruction of}} a Dornier Do 17 before destroying a Bf 109 on 15 September 1940—the Battle of Britain Day—over Clacton-on-Sea. Two rest days followed. On 18 September he claimed a Bf 109 <b>probably</b> <b>destroyed</b> on his first patrol then another destroyed plus one <b>probably</b> <b>destroyed</b> in the afternoon over Gravesend.|$|E
5|$|Historian Alfred Price {{credited}} McKellar with 17 air victories, three shared destroyed, five <b>probably</b> <b>destroyed</b> {{and three}} damaged. Historians Christopher Shores and Clive Williams credit him with 21 air victories, three <b>probably</b> <b>destroyed</b> and three damaged as does E.C.R Baker. In his last combat they credit {{him with a}} possible 22nd victory, since a Bf 109 crashed {{in the area of}} his last combat and no RAF pilot made a claim. John Foreman credits him with at least 17 victories and acknowledges the unclaimed Bf 109 that crashed on 1 November 1940 near to McKellar might have been his last victory. Chaz Bowyer, another prolific historian and writer on RAF personnel credits McKellar with at least 20 victories.|$|E
2500|$|The unit also {{resisted}} the Allied invasion of Sicily, <b>probably</b> <b>destroying</b> the U.S. Liberty ship [...] on 11 July. [...] made constant night attacks against Allied Naval forces from 10 July - 25 August 1943.|$|R
50|$|The 367th {{participated in}} seven campaigns. It had flown 14,175 combat sorties {{destroying}} 432 enemy aircraft, <b>probably</b> <b>destroying</b> another 28 and damaging 344. They had also destroyed or damaged 384 locomotives, 4,672 motor vehicles and 8,288 railroad cars.|$|R
5000|$|Critics have {{regularly}} questioned Plimer {{about his}} commercial {{interests in the}} mining industry, but he defends the independence of his views, saying that these commercial interests do not colour his arguments, {{which are based on}} pure science. Critics note that Plimer has opposed a carbon trading scheme in Australia, saying that [...] "it would <b>probably</b> <b>destroy</b> mining industry totally".|$|R
5|$|Astronomers did not observe {{large amounts}} of water {{following}} the collisions, and later impact studies found that fragmentation and destruction of the cometary fragments in an 'airburst' probably occurred at much higher altitudes than previously expected, with even the largest fragments being destroyed when the pressure reached , well above the expected depth of the water layer. The smaller fragments were <b>probably</b> <b>destroyed</b> before they even reached the cloud layer.|$|E
5|$|Plagis {{finished}} {{the war with}} a tally of 16 enemy aircraft confirmed destroyed (including two shared victories counted as half a kill each), two shared <b>probably</b> <b>destroyed,</b> six damaged and one shared damaged. This made him Southern Rhodesia's highest-scoring ace of the war, {{as well as the}} top-scoring ace of Greek origin. He was one of the most-decorated Southern Rhodesian servicemen of the war.|$|E
5|$|By the {{conclusion}} of his combat tour in July 1942, Brennan had flown a total of twenty-two operational sorties and was credited with destroying 10 Axis aircraft over Malta, with one <b>probably</b> <b>destroyed</b> and a further 6 damaged. For his efforts {{in the destruction of}} Axis aircraft during this period, Brennan was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. The notification of the decoration was published in a supplement to the London Gazette on 6 October 1942.|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't {{give you}} much hopes of recovery," [...] said the officer in charge. [...] "Dollar bills {{are very much}} alike, and if the thief finds that he cannot put the letters to account he will <b>probably</b> <b>destroy</b> them.

5000|$|Boudica leads a {{rebellion}} of the Iceni against Roman rule in {{alliance with the}} Trinovantes, Cornovii, Durotriges and Celtic Britons. The Iceni and Trinovantes first destroy the Roman capital Camulodunum (Colchester), wipe out the infantry of the Legio IX Hispana (commanded by Quintus Petillius Cerialis) {{and go on to}} burn Londinium (London) (<b>probably</b> <b>destroying</b> London Bridge) and Verulamium (St Albans), in all cases massacring the inhabitants in the thousands.|$|R
5000|$|The {{possible}} existence of, say, [...] consistent different vacuum {{states for}} superstring theory <b>probably</b> <b>destroys</b> {{the hope of}} using the theory to predict anything. If one picks among this large set just those states whose properties agree with present experimental observations, it is likely there still will be such {{a large number of}} these that one can get just about whatever value one wants for the results of any new observation.|$|R
5|$|Finucane was {{credited}} with 28 aerial victories, five <b>probably</b> <b>destroyed,</b> six shared destroyed, one shared probable victory, and eight damaged. Included in his total were 23 Messerschmitt Bf 109s, four Focke-Wulf Fw 190s and one Messerschmitt Bf 110. Official records differ over the exact total. After the war, two of Finucane's victories that were credited as probables had, in fact, been destroyed, but were not officially included. His total victory count {{could be as high}} as 32. Some sources credit him this figure.|$|E
5|$|Leigh-Mallory {{claimed the}} Big Wings had {{destroyed}} entire formations of enemy aircraft upon seeing them. He even claimed the RAF outnumbered their opponents in several engagements. In the afternoon battle, {{he claimed that}} the Wing could not get into position {{to break up the}} bombers in time and was intercepted by German fighters. Still, while that was true he also claimed his units had shot down 105 enemy aircraft and <b>probably</b> <b>destroyed</b> a further 40. He claimed another 18 damaged for the loss of 14 and six pilots.|$|E
5|$|Most of the equipment, arms, and {{machinery}} at the Little Rock Arsenal was removed to {{east of the}} Mississippi River by order of Maj. Gen. Earl Van Dorn in April and May 1862, and accountability for it is lost at that point. By all appearances, the equipment was sent down the river to Napoleon, Arkansas, {{and from there to}} Jackson Mississippi, where it was <b>probably</b> <b>destroyed</b> during the Vicksburg campaign in the early summer of 1863.|$|E
50|$|Tuval claims Zygor was {{destroyed}} when the Zygons enemies, the Xaranti caused a stellar explosion, <b>probably</b> by <b>destroying</b> its sun.|$|R
5000|$|It {{has been}} {{observed}} that a TECO command sequence more closely resembles transmission line noise than readable text. One of the more entertaining games to play with TECO is to type your name in as a command line and try to guess what it does. Just about any possible typing error while talking with TECO will <b>probably</b> <b>destroy</b> your program, or even worse - introduce subtle and mysterious bugs in a once working subroutine.|$|R
5000|$|The Bierpinsel {{has been}} closed since April 2006. The new owner wants to rebuild the entire area with a new {{entrance}} building. The plans have been criticized as they will also rework the tower restaurant, with a golden exterior that will <b>probably</b> <b>destroy</b> the traditional pop-art appearance that made it famous. Likewise the name will change back to a neutral variant - the building first opened as [...] "Turmrestaurant Steglitz" [...] (Tower Restaurant Steglitz).|$|R
5|$|The {{authenticity}} of the casket letters has {{been the source of}} much controversy among historians. It is impossible now to prove either way. The originals, written in French, were <b>probably</b> <b>destroyed</b> in 1584 by Mary's son. The surviving copies, in French or translated into English, do not form a complete set. There are incomplete printed transcriptions in English, Scots, French, and Latin from the 1570s. Other documents scrutinised included Bothwell's divorce from Jean Gordon. Moray had sent a messenger in September to Dunbar to get a copy of the proceedings from the town's registers.|$|E
5|$|In May 1940 his {{squadron}} {{took part}} in the Battle of France, during which Dundas claimed his first two victories. Dundas remained with his squadron throughout the Battle of Britain, claiming nine German aircraft shot down. On 9 October he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC) for 10 victories. At the time of his last battle Dundas had been credited with 12 aircraft destroyed, two shared destroyed, four <b>probably</b> <b>destroyed</b> and five damaged. During a battle over the English Channel on 28 November 1940, Dundas is believed to have engaged and shot down Helmut Wick, the highest scoring ace of the Luftwaffe at that time. Moments later Dundas was also shot down into the sea. Both pilots vanished and remain missing in action.|$|E
5|$|A {{company of}} R-2s was {{assigned}} to the Popescu Armoured Detachment after King Michael's Coup and Romanian's defection from the Axis at the end of August 1944. The Detachment was tasked with preventing the German units stationed around Ploiești from breaking out to the north and finding refuge in Hungary. They accomplished their task and the R-2s were withdrawn from combat operations until the following year. Romania had concentrated all of its remaining tanks and armoured fighting vehicles in the 2nd Armoured Regiment in early 1945 as the unofficial Soviet arms embargo began to have effect. It had five R-2s on hand in early February 1945 when it was sent to the front, but the Soviets confiscated most of them when it arrived. Both R-2s were serviceable when the regiment entered Bratislava on 4 April 1945, but these were <b>probably</b> <b>destroyed</b> when the regiment was virtually surrounded in Austria on 10 April because they are no longer listed among the regiment's vehicles afterwards.|$|E

I will see him again, {{and bring him}} up with me: but now, my dear Mr. Armsworth, do {{remember}} one thing; {{that if you go}} on with him at your usual rate of hospitality, the man will as surely be drunk, as his nerves and brain are all but ruined; and if he is so, he will most <b>probably</b> <b>destroy</b> himself to-morrow morning." ...|$|R
5|$|Llywelyn {{responded by}} {{intervening}} {{with his own}} forces but outright conflict was prevented by the diplomatic efforts of Henry III. De Clare continued building work and in 1270 Llywelyn responded by attacking and burning the site, <b>probably</b> <b>destroying</b> the temporary defences and stores. De Clare began work again the following year, raising tensions and prompting Henry to send two bishops, Roger de Meyland and Godfrey Giffard, {{to take control of}} the site and arbitrate a solution to the dispute.|$|R
50|$|In 1965, Gill taught {{painting}} at the University of Idaho. His work {{in these years}} was often depressing and bleak in tone and mood. Main themes were {{the social and political}} affairs such as the Vietnam War. Gill created a series of anti-war paintings which dealt with civil and military leaders. The playwright William Inge described the men in these paintings as “figures of high public reputation, momentarily caught in some nefarious act that will <b>probably</b> <b>destroy</b> their political or professional reputations”.|$|R
5|$|After 600, {{information}} on the Britons of Alt Clut becomes {{more common in the}} sources. In 642, led by Eugein son of Beli, they defeated the men of Dál Riata and killed Domnall Brecc, grandson of Áedán, at Strathcarron. The kingdom suffered a number of attacks from the Picts under Óengus, and later the Picts' Northumbrian allies between 744 and 756. They lost the region of Kyle in the south-west of modern Scotland to Northumbria, and the last attack may have forced the king Dumnagual III to submit to his neighbours. After this, little is heard of Alt Clut or its kings until Alt Clut was burnt and <b>probably</b> <b>destroyed</b> in 780, although by whom and what in what circumstances is not known, Historians have traditionally identified Alt Clut with the later Kingdom of Strathclyde, but J. E. Fraser points to the fact there is no contemporary evidence that the heartland of Alt Clut was in Clydesdale and the Kingdom of Strathclyde may have arisen after Alt Clut's decline.|$|E
5|$|On 22December 1940, as the Allies {{advanced}} {{along the}} Libyan coast to Bardia, Rawlinson's rank of flying officer was made substantive; {{it would be}} the highest permanent rank he received during the war. Four days later, he was among a formation of eight Gladiators that attacked ten Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 bombers and their escort of twenty-four CR.42s; the Australians claimed two CR.42s destroyed, and five damaged including one <b>probably</b> <b>destroyed,</b> which was credited to Rawlinson. On 22January 1941, Rawlinson and Flying Officer Wilfred Arthur were despatched in Gladiators to attack an Italian schooner reported off Tobruk; they machine-gunned the vessel, setting it on fire. Three days later, Rawlinson claimed two Fiat G.50 fighters damaged after five of the Italian monoplanes attacked a formation of five Gladiators patrolling near Mechili. He was notified of his promotion to temporary flight lieutenant, effective from New Year's Day, on 27January.|$|E
5|$|After {{a period}} of air-to-air {{exercises}} and practice the Wing undertook a Circus operation on 3 August 1941. In the evening the Wing crossed out over Manston at 18,000ft and then dropped to 13,000ft over the coast at Gravelines and set course for Saint Omer. Near Ambleteuse five Bf 109Fs were sighted one thousand feet above and in front travelling past the Spitfires. The German fighters shadowed the flight before three detached and dived to attack, curving in from behind. The Spitfires turned into them. Finucane missed with his first burst of fire and chased the leading Bf 109 into cloud while following the Bf 109's condensation trail. Hitting the enemy with another burst from 200 yards the Bf 109 burst into flames. He sighted another formation of 18 Bf 109s above and climbed to attack supported by six Spitfires. Finucane scored hits on the tail unit of one which went down vertically and into a cloud layer at 2,000ft at which point contact was lost. Finucane claimed one destroyed and one <b>probably</b> <b>destroyed.</b> The operation elevated his tally to 7. The day was best remembered in Fighter Command {{for the loss of}} Flight Lieutenant Eric Lock who was shot down by ground-fire in the morning patrol.|$|E
50|$|As with flood {{insurance}} or insurance on damage from a hurricane or other large-scale disasters, insurance companies {{must be careful}} when assigning this type of insurance, because an earthquake strong enough to destroy one home will <b>probably</b> <b>destroy</b> dozens of homes in the same area. If one company has written insurance policies on {{a large number of}} homes in a particular city, then a devastating earthquake will quickly drain all the company's resources. Insurance companies devote much study and effort toward risk management to avoid such cases.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{might make}} YOU one," [...] the editor hinted. [...] "Don't trouble yourself; I shall <b>probably</b> <b>destroy</b> them." [...] With this Peter Baron took his departure, waiting however just afterwards, {{in the street}} near the house, {{as if he had}} been looking out for a stray hansom, to which he would not have signalled had it appeared. He thought Mr. Locket might hurry after him, but Mr. Locket seemed to have other things to do, and Peter Baron {{returned}} on foot to Jersey Villas.|$|R
500|$|During the North African {{campaign}} in late 1940, Turnbull undertook {{close air support}} in Gloster Gauntlets and fighter missions in Gloster Gladiators. He was credited with <b>probably</b> <b>destroying</b> a Fiat CR.42 during the Battle of Bardia on 26December, and with damaging a Fiat G.50 on 25January 1941, the last sortie No.3 Squadron flew with the Gladiator before converting to Hawker Hurricanes. On 3April, he claimed four Messerschmitt Bf110 heavy fighters in a single sortie flying a Hurricane he had christened Ortogo; his commanding officer praised him as [...] "quick to the kill".|$|R
5|$|Finucane claimed {{three more}} successes in the spring, one Fw 190 on 26 March escorting 24 Douglas A-20 Havocs from 88 and 107 squadrons to attack Le Havre docks; another on 28 March and one Bf 109 and another Fw 190 on 17 May 1942. Four {{aircraft}} were claimed as shared, two <b>probably</b> <b>destroyed</b> and four damaged. Life magazine filmed the squadron's sortie on 26 March, as the fighters {{took off and}} landed. This operation was significant as Finucane's unit was also making use of gun camera footage to help verify combat claims. Finucane used footage to verify two claims on 2 April. Despite two clear images of two Fw 190s being hit he was credited only with one damaged. 602 was prompted to use the cameras because the Command thought the squadron's claims were excessive and the pilots were over stating their success. The Air Ministry also accelerated a plan to introduce the Spitfire IX to restore qualitative parity with the Fw 190 which was inflicting heavy losses on British fighter formations; primarily through German pilots taking full advantage of its superior performance over the Spitfire V. Finucane took at least one flight in the Spitfire IX. He flew the personal aircraft of commanding officer W. G. G. Duncan Smith, 64 Squadron, on 26 June 1942.|$|E
5|$|Here Pattle was {{to enjoy}} {{significant}} success. On 19 November 1940, Pattle with eight other pilots from 80 Squadron, attacked Fiat CR.42s and Fiat G.50bis near the Italian airfield at Korçë. In this combat, the RAF claimed nine and two <b>probably</b> <b>destroyed</b> while 160o Gruppo Autonomo (Independent Group) lost three Fiat CR.42s and one damaged while 355a Squadriglia, 24o Gruppo Autonomo, lost one G.50. Four Italian pilots were killed, while the RAF lost a Gladiator. Pattle claimed two CR.42s {{in the battle}} — his wingman Heimar Stucky (himself wounded in action later on) witnessed both catch fire and crash {{in the vicinity of}} Korçë with the pilots killed. Pattle's guns jammed during the battle and he was forced to break off combat. Pattle also noted the inferior speed of the Gladiator against the Fiat G.50. The Italian pilots could easily outrun the Gladiators if outnumbered. His combat reports also noted the ineffective fire of the Italians who fired and broke away from too far away. Having regained pressure in his guns, he encountered a lone G.50. Though respectful of its advantages, he was convinced of his own flying ability. He placed the Gladiator below and in front of the Italian fighter to tempt the enemy pilot, but could not persuade it to accept battle. Between 27–29 November, Pattle made four claims. Flying as escort for Bristol Blenheims, Pattle engaged three SM.79s and shared two destroyed with 11 other pilots. On 29 November, he shared with William Vale with both claiming two shared damaged.|$|E
5|$|On 11 July 1941 Fighter Command {{conducted}} Circus Number 44. 12 Group flew as {{the lower}} echelon with Spitfire squadrons 452, 65 and 266. Two 11 Group wings from RAF Biggin Hill encompassing 72, 92 and 609 Squadrons and the incomplete RAF Kenley wing with 485 and 602. There {{was so much}} competition in the squadron to fly on its first Circus operation that Finucane had to draw lots. The squadron re-fuelled at West Malling after staging down to the coast through England. Flying as the middle-squadron at 18,000ft Finucane's flight crossed the coast east of Dunkirk at 14:45 GMT. Over Poperinghe the wing split into four groups and headed to Cassel. The sole charge was a Bristol Blenheim of No. 60 Group RAF which was {{to act as a}} decoy. Five miles west of Lille at 15:00 GMT they were engaged by elements of Jagdgeschwader 2 and JG 26. Finucane engaged 8 Bf 109s and other units engaged three flights of 10 Bf 109s in total. Finucane was able to position himself behind a straggler after firing 90 rounds the Bf 109 was hit and the pilot bailed out. Fighter Command claimed seven destroyed, two <b>probably</b> <b>destroyed</b> and seven damaged for three Spitfires. Circus 45 took place 40 minutes later. Finucane's success was the first victory for the squadron.|$|E
500|$|Cullen was [...] "" [...] on 9October 1940, {{after being}} {{detailed}} to search single-handedly {{for a missing}} Allied truck. Failing to locate the vehicle, he spotted five Italian Breda Ba.65 ground-attack aircraft south of Sidi Barrani and immediately engaged them, gaining credit for <b>probably</b> <b>destroying</b> one, although the Italians reported all aircraft as returning to base. No.80 Squadron redeployed to Greece the following month, to assist in resisting the Italian invasion. There Cullen achieved his first confirmed victory, over a Savoia-Marchetti SM.81 three-engined bomber near the Kassandra Peninsula on 30December. He was promoted to flight lieutenant the next day.|$|R
5000|$|As this occurred, {{the initial}} {{element of the}} rescue force—a pair of A-1E [...] "Sandies"—arrived to locate the {{position}} of the downed crewmen before calling in the waiting HH-53 Jolly Green helicopters orbiting at a holding point over Laos. Thorsness, with only 500 rounds of ammunition left, turned back from the tanker to fly RESCAP (rescue combat air patrol) for the Sandies and update them on the situation and terrain. As Thorsness approached the area, briefing the Sandies, he spotted MiG-17s in a wagon wheel orbit around him and attacked, <b>probably</b> <b>destroying</b> another that flew across his path.|$|R
50|$|The {{bark beetle}} (Scolytus quadrispinosus) attacks mockernut hickory, {{especially}} in drought years and where hickory species are growing rapidly. The hickory spiral borer (Argilus arcuatus torquatus) and the pecan carpenterworm (Cossula magnifica) are also serious insect enemies of mockernut. The hickory bark beetle <b>probably</b> <b>destroys</b> more sawtimber-size mockernut trees {{than any other}} insect. The hickory spiral borer kills many seedlings and young trees, and the pecan carpenterworm degrades both trees and logs. The twig girdler (Oncideres cingulata) attacks both small and large trees; it seriously deforms trees by sawing branches. Sometimes these girdlers cut hickory seedlings near ground level.|$|R
