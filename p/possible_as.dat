5|$|As England had {{a strong}} batting lineup, Bradman wanted a large range of {{specialist}} bowlers in the Tests, and this was made <b>possible</b> <b>as</b> his preferred bowlers were skillful with the bat. Australia's bowling line-up consisted of Miller, McCool (leg spin), Johnson (off spin), Lindwall, George Tribe (both left arm orthodox and unorthodox) and Toshack. The only deviations were Lindwall missing one Test due to chickenpox, and leg spinner Dooland replacing left-arm spinner Tribe in two Tests.|$|E
5|$|Chronic {{health effects}} from {{volcanic}} ash fall are <b>possible,</b> <b>as</b> exposure to free crystalline silica {{is known to}} cause silicosis. Minerals associated with this include quartz, cristobalite and tridymite, which may all be present in volcanic ash. These minerals are described as ‘free’ silica as the SiO2 is not attached to another element {{to create a new}} mineral. However, magmas containing less than 58% SiO2 are thought to be unlikely to contain crystalline silica.|$|E

5|$|Low-pressure {{deposition}} of thin films of cubic boron nitride is <b>possible.</b> <b>As</b> in diamond growth, {{the major problem}} is to suppress the growth of hexagonal phases (h-BN or graphite, respectively).

5|$|The {{management}} of {{low back pain}} often includes medications for the duration that they are beneficial.

5|$|At first, human {{activity}} had not posed a significant {{threat to the}} Puerto Rican amazon. The Taíno hunted the parrot but without much effect on its population. In the past two hundred years, however, many factors {{have led to a}} drastic decrease in the birds' numbers: agricultural development, the construction of roads, hydroelectric development, and the adoption of young chicks as pets. Especially during {{the latter half of the}} 19th century, most of Puerto Rico's virgin forests, a historical habitat of the species, were cleared for agricultural development, primarily for the production of sugar, cotton, corn and rice. The amazon quickly came to rely on these crops as its main food source and so became seen as a pest; local farmers repelled or hunted the bird if <b>possible.</b> <b>As</b> agriculture expanded, the amazon's habitat disappeared further and its population declined.|$|E
5|$|By 2017, sauropod fossils {{had been}} {{recovered}} from a total of 32 localities within the Nemegt Formation, and possibly belong to either Opisthocoelicaudia or Nemegtosaurus. At least two finds from the Nemegt locality — a fragmentary tail (MPD 100/406) {{and a pair of}} claws – show features diagnostic for Opisthocoelicaudia and can be referred to the latter. Field crews led by Philip Currie attempted to relocate the Opisthocoelicaudia holotype quarry in 2006 and 2008, but became successful only in 2009 thanks to additional data provided by Gradziński. Although a prospection for additional bone material was not <b>possible</b> <b>as</b> the quarry had been filled by windblown sand, the quarry could be determined to fall within the lower portion of the Nemegt Formation.|$|E

5|$|By noon, {{the rebels}} of the 108th Infantry Regiment were {{approaching}} Bjelovar, and {{were joined by}} elements of the 42nd Infantry Regiment and other units of the division. The leader of the rebels in Bjelovar was Kapetan Ivan Mrak, a reserve aviator. When 4th Army commander Armijski đeneral Petar Nedeljković {{became aware of the}} rebels' approach, he ordered the local gendarmerie commander to maintain order, but was advised this would not be <b>possible,</b> <b>as</b> local gendarmerie conscripts would not report for duty. His headquarters reported the presence of the rebels to the headquarters of the 1st Army Group, suggesting that the Royal Yugoslav Air Force could bomb the rebel units. The 8th Bomber Regiment at Rovine was even warned to receive orders to use its Bristol Blenheim Mk I light bombers to bomb the 108th Infantry Regiment, but the idea was subsequently abandoned. Instead, it was decided to request that the leader of the Croatian Peasant Party, Vladko Maček intervene with the rebels.|$|E
5|$|Carbon dating {{carried out}} at the University of Edinburgh dated the skull to between 1650 and 1880, while {{the fact that it}} had been {{deposited}} on top of a layer of Victorian tiles suggested that it belonged to the end of this era. The skull had fracture marks consistent with Webster's account of throwing Thomas down the stairs, and it was found to have low collagen levels, consistent with it being boiled. In July 2011, the coroner concluded that the skull was indeed that of Thomas. DNA testing was not <b>possible</b> <b>as</b> she had died childless and no relatives could be traced; in addition, there was no record of where the rest of her body had been buried.|$|E
5|$|Christologically Maximus {{insisted on}} a strict dyophysitism, which {{can be seen as}} a {{corollary}} of the emphasis on theosis. In terms of salvation, humanity is intended to be fully united with God. This is possible for Maximus because God was first fully united with humanity in the incarnation. If Christ did not become fully human (if, for example, he only had a divine and not a human will), then salvation was no longer <b>possible,</b> <b>as</b> humanity could not become fully divine.|$|E

5|$|Dominican missionaries {{were active}} in Verapaz and the {{southern}} Petén from the late 16th century through the 17th century, attempting non-violent conversion with limited success.

The constant flow of escapees fleeing the Spanish-held territories to find refuge with the Itza was a drain on the workforce managed by the encomienda system.|$|E
5|$|During battle, players cast spells {{using an}} {{assigned}} Persona: each spell drains a character's Spell Point meter. Each Persona has different elemental strengths and weaknesses, and different Personas {{can be used}} for defense, healing or elemental attacks. While a Persona is originally quite weak, if it is used enough, it will achieve a higher rank, with Rank 8 being the highest <b>possible.</b> <b>As</b> the Persona's rank is raised, that Persona is able to cast more powerful spells. In addition to individual actions, the player can align characters to trigger a Fusion Spell: when two or more party members use a certain sequence of spells, they will automatically summon multiple Personas to generate a powerful attack. During battles, both characters and Personas earn experience points. The player has the option to activate an Auto-battle option, having combat play out without player interaction.|$|E
5|$|Growing {{the star}} will {{increase}} its gravitational force, {{which increases the}} number of planets the solar system can have. They will {{also be able to}} attract solar systems composed of stars with lower mass than that of the player, or being attracted to stars with bigger mass. If both stars collide, they will be reduced to a lesser size within the same type of object. For example, if the player controls a small star and collides against a medium star, the player will be disintegrated while the AI-controlled star will be reduced to a small star. Being reduced from small star to life planet is not <b>possible,</b> <b>as</b> well as being reduced from small planet to asteroid. In these cases, the player is respawned, with random mass, close to the place where they collided.|$|E

5|$|However, {{the remnant}} low {{associated}} with Josephine {{began to show}} signs of redevelopment during the afternoon on September7. Convection around the system increased significantly and the low was no longer exposed. On September8, wind shear took over the system again. Convection around the remnant low was torn away and the low was exposed once more. The National Hurricane Center did not state the chance of regeneration once the low became exposed. Finally, on September 9, wind shear and dry air led to the remnants of Josephine deteriorating into an open wave. However, on September10, the remnants of Josephine redeveloped and global models picked up on the reformed system. Once more, the chance of regeneration was <b>possible</b> <b>as</b> the remnants of Josephine headed towards the Bahamas. However, on September14, dry air and wind shear caused the remnants to dissipate entirely.|$|E

5|$|In 1929 the USSR had 70 {{psychiatric}} hospitals and 21,103 psychiatric beds. By 1935 this had increased to 102 {{psychiatric hospitals}} and 33,772 psychiatric beds, and by 1955 there were 200 psychiatric hospitals and 116,000 psychiatric {{beds in the}} Soviet Union. The Soviet authorities built psychiatric hospitals at a rapid pace and increased the quantity of beds for patients with nervous and mental illnesses: between 1962 and 1974 the number of beds for psychiatric patients increased from 222,600 to 390,000. Such an expansion {{in the number of}} psychiatric beds was expected to continue in the years up to 1980.
