The <b>percentage</b> <b>response</b> in ADG per percent added fat in the university studies was greater for the first 2. 5 % added fat than for higher fat levels, indicating a diminishing return.

For lighter weight pigs (70 to 120 lb), the net return to added fat is almost always positive, with feed cost per unit of gain being increased and deceased 50 % of the time. However, the net return to added fat for heavier weight pigs (230 to 265 lb) fluctuates, with feed cost per unit of gain being increased in most scenarios.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Randomised {{controlled}} trials (RCTs) {{evaluating the}} efficacy of antagonists to tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) showed high <b>response</b> <b>percentages</b> in the groups treated with active drugs. OBJECTIVE: To compare {{the efficacy of}} anti-TNF treatments for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients in RCTs and in daily clinical practice, {{with an emphasis on}} the efficacy for patients eligible and not eligible for RCTs of anti-TNF treatments. METHODS: First, randomised placebo-controlled trials written in English for etanercept, infliximab and adalimumab for patients with RA were selected by a systematic review. Second, the DREAM (Dutch Rheumatoid Arthritis Monitoring) register with patients starting {{for the first time on}} one of the TNF-blocking agents was used. Patient characteristics, doses of medication and co-medication as well as the ACR 20 <b>response</b> <b>percentages</b> were compared between RCTs and DREAM data, stratified for trial eligibility. RESULTS: In 10 of 11 comparisons, the ACR 20 <b>response</b> <b>percentages</b> were lower in daily clinical practice than in the RCT active drug group, which was significant in five of 11 comparisons. Only 34 - 79 % of DREAM patients fulfilled the selection criteria for disease activity in the several RCTs examined. DREAM patients eligible for RCTs had higher <b>response</b> <b>percentages</b> than ineligible DREAM patients. ACR 20 <b>response</b> <b>percentages</b> of eligible DREAM patients were comparable with the ACR 20 <b>response</b> <b>percentages</b> of the RCT active drug group in 10 of 11 comparisons. CONCLUSION: The efficacy of TNF-blocking agents in RCTs exceeded the efficacy of these drugs in clinical practice. However, in clinical practice more patients with lower disease activity were treated with TNF-blocking agents compared with those treated in RCTs. For daily practice patients who were eligible for RCTs, responses were more similar to responses reached in RCTs...|$|R

40|$|This study {{attempts}} to consider, {{in the light}} of two surveys, the development of attitudes of Sixth Form pupils in certain selected schools in Cumbria over a specific period. The surveys contain questions relating to attitudes in respect of: Sixth Form studies, life and relationships within the Sixth Form; behaviour as manifest in attitudes to authority and the use of authority; values in school. Initially, the study examines attitude formation and change in general terms and in relation to the present research. A section of the work appraises the research into and the writing about the development of education in the Sixth Form; a further section establishes areas of common ground between the work on attitudes and the work concerned with Sixth Formers. Next, the results of each survey have been compiled and analysed. In each case, the main directions of the responses have been made clear, particular trends and developments being stressed where appropriate. The <b>percentage</b> of <b>responses</b> to each question has, in both cases, been recorded, the responses having been classified into broad groups or categories.

30|$|The ESI {{is based}} on monthly surveys to {{consumers}} and entrepreneurs about their future perceptions for variables that are of interest for them. They express their opinion about whether these variables will increase, decrease or remain in the same value for the next month. Therefore, the ESI corresponds to expectations of agents about different economic variables. The ESI is composed by fifteen categories that can be grouped into five economic sectors. These are industry, services, consumption, construction, and sales with the weights 40, 30, 20, 5, and 5 %, respectively. <b>Percentage</b> <b>responses,</b> i.e. increase, decrease or remain in the same value, are expresses as a balance, i.e. <b>percentage</b> of favorable <b>responses</b> minus unfavorable responses.

This indicator considers different sectors of the economy, which makes it more representative of the economic activity compared to other monthly indicators that only take into account one economic sector, e.g. the industrial production index.|$|R

Typical examples include regression models for percentage outcomes and the analysis of ratings that are measured on a bounded scale. In this paper, we consider beta regression, which is a generalization of logit models to situations where the response is continuous on the interval (0, 1). Consequently, beta regression is a convenient tool for analyzing percentage responses. The classical approach to fit a beta regression model is to use maximum likelihood estimation with subsequent AIC-based variable selection. As an alternative to this established - yet unstable - approach, we propose a new estimation technique called boosted beta regression.
