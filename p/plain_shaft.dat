500|$|The Chrysler Building did {{not have}} the {{standard}} 1920s-skyscraper design of columns with a decorative base, <b>plain</b> <b>shaft</b> and decorative capitals; instead, the entire skyscraper contains ornate ornamental features. The building's height and the legally mandated setbacks influenced Van Alen toward this design. The walls of the lowermost sixteen floors rise directly from the sidewalk property lines, except for a hole on one side that gives the building a [...] "U"-shaped floor plan above the fourth floor. There are setbacks on floors 16, 18, 23, 28, and 31, making the building compliant with the Zoning Law of 1916. This gives the building the appearance of a ziggurat {{on one side and a}} U-shaped palazzo on the other. Above the 31st floor, there are no more setbacks until the 60th floor, upon which the structure funnels into a Maltese cross shape that [...] "blends the square shaft to the finial", according to author and photographer Cervin Robinson. The façade of the building is mostly covered in white brick, while dark gray brick is used mostly as a horizontal decoration to highlight the rows of windows.|$|E

50|$|Drills are {{tools that}} “serve as rotary {{perforating}} implements.” (Irwin and Wormington 1970) Types of drill found are <b>plain</b> <b>shafted</b> drills, flanged, and modified flakes. <b>Plain</b> <b>shafted</b> drills aren’t well documented and were projectile points that were reworked. They {{were most likely}} used for simple tasks and probably cannot be used as horizon markers. Flanged drills are the most typical drill in prehistoric sites. They were most likely manufactured from a flake blank and were handheld. The modified flakes were probably used as a hafted tool and had steep edge retouch. The modified flakes were {{the only one to}} demonstrate drill wear in that rings are noticeable on the drills with actual use as a drill.|$|R

50|$|The Temple of the Delians is a “peripteral” Doric order temple, {{the largest}} of three {{dedicated}} to Apollo {{on the island of}} Delos. It was begun in 478 BC and never completely finished. During their period of independence from Athens, the Delians reassigned the temple to the island of Poros. It is “hexastyle”, with six columns across the pedimented end and thirteen along each long face. All the columns are centered under a triglyph in the frieze, except for the corner columns. The <b>plain,</b> unfluted <b>shafts</b> on the columns stand directly on the platform (the stylobate), without bases. The recessed “necking” in the nature of fluting {{at the top of the}} shafts and the wide cushionlike echinus may be interpreted as slightly self-conscious archaising features, for Delos is Apollo's ancient birthplace. However, the similar fluting at the base of the shafts might indicate an intention for the <b>plain</b> <b>shafts</b> to be capable of wrapping in drapery.|$|R
50|$|The oldest part of {{the crypt}} is the two westernmost bays under {{the eastern end of}} the quire. It is {{part of the}} {{original}} 1080s Lanfranc construction with typical Romanesque groin vaulting springing from plain capitals atop quite slender <b>plain</b> <b>shafts.</b> The rest of the crypt is from a century later. The plinths, shafts and capitals are in the same style as the earlier work, but quadripartite rib vaulting was used. Owing to the oblong shape of the bays, the shorter transverse arches are pointed; however, since the other ribs are rounded, the overall appearance is Romanesque. In places remnants of the mediaeval paintwork are visible in the vaulting. More medieval paintwork is visible in the east end window openings.|$|R
50|$|In <b>plain</b> bearings, the <b>shaft</b> {{is usually}} {{in contact with}} a bushing (sleeve or flanged) to reduce friction. When the {{rotation}} is slow and the load is radial, the model of uniform pressure can be used (small deformations and clearance).|$|R

In this eye there is a radiant ray, representing the Supreme Being, Great Architect of the Universe according to Masonic symbolism. Flanking each column are two sphinxes (four in total) lying on his stomach and covered with claft. They were made by the sculptor Compañ Zamorano Guzman (1878-1944). The main door is carved in wood with geometric patterns; about it, the lintel is decorated with palm leaves and a sun with wings of an eagle, symbol of the deity Horus.

On {{the left side of the}} wall about two-thirds are occupied by three arches that communicate with two chapels, linked these together without actually forming a kind of aisle. One of these chapels, in the transept, opens with a roundarch, the other communicates with the nave in the middle of the wall by two pointed arches supported by an interesting and <b>plain</b> <b>shaft</b> column capitals with volutes rough. The remaining third of the left flank, to toe the ship opens to the outside forming an atrium with 3 slender lintels and Tuscan columns with footings and beams. Under this court found the greatest access to the temple, a flat arch with recess sores from the 18th century, in the key reads [...] "Ave Maria. Year 1766". Along the eaves of the same court is an old sundial undated.|$|E
40|$|Abstract One of the {{challenges}} facing the designers of aeroengine drive shafts is to transmit higher torques {{while at the same}} time reducing the overall diameter of the engine in order to reduce drag. The resulting high performance drive shafts are smaller, lighter and have thinner walls and it is essential that the factors affecting instability are known and understood. Torque is the principal load carried by these shafts and most of the analytical methods for predicting torsional stability are either analytical or semi-empirical and tend not to cover the relevant range of geometries of interest here in terms of shaft geometry. Also, they give only limited information about the failure mode involved. A finite element analysis (FEA) approach has been developed to address this need and this paper presents results for <b>plain</b> <b>shaft</b> sections subjected to torque loading. Geometries leading to elastic buckling and plastic collapse are identified, along with appropriate formulae for calculating the torque capacity.

25|$|In {{the absence}} of much {{documentary}} evidence, the abbey's art may {{shed some light on}} the values held dear by the community. In the 14th century a number of figures were carved on the previously <b>plain</b> <b>shafts</b> of the arches at the processional entrance to the church and {{at the entrance to the}} chapter house. St Peter and St Paul flank the church entrance used by the canons to enter the church for the Canonical Hours. These were the saints most closely associated with the Papacy, from which both the order and the abbey took their authority. For the chapter house, Augustine of Hippo, eponym of the order, and St John the Evangelist, patron saint of the abbey, were obvious choices. The remaining saints were all illustrative of martyrdom, austerity or spiritual struggle. Thomas Becket, murdered on the orders of Henry II, one of Haughmond's major benefactors, was a martyr whose cult at Canterbury was the focus for medieval England's most important pilgrimage. Catherine of Alexandria, seen as a virgin martyr, is portrayed with her wheel of martyrdom, taking revenge on the Emperor Maxentius. John the Baptist, closely associated with asceticism and speaking truth to power, and a Biblical type for Becket, clutches the lamb and flag symbol of the Agnus Dei. He is accompanied by Margaret of Antioch, who is spearing a dragon, a female counterpart to St Michael. St Winifred, a third virgin martyr, whose relics were kept at nearby Shrewsbury Abbey, is shown with her persecutor Caradog sinking into the ground. Facing her, St Michael the Archangel, armed with spear and shield, treads down and impales a dragon, representing Satan.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} an extensive test programme for bolted connections using SuperStructural Pultruded Fibre Reinforced Polymer (PFRP) materials {{with an emphasis}} on characterising strengths for the pin-bearing failure mode and linking coupon results to bearing failure in lapshear bolted connections. The motivation for the research is to address key gaps in knowledge that are known to be hindering the preparation of recognised design guidelines for PFRP (frame) structures, which upon becoming available shall broaden exploitation in civil engineering works. Prominent among these knowledge gaps has been the need to have statistically verified pinbearing and bolted connections strengths that are with connection configurations complying with current design practice. Thread in bearing, as found in practice, is investigated together, for the first time, with the <b>plain</b> <b>shaft</b> situation. Both as-received and environmental (hot-wet aging) conditioned PFRP materials are characterized to study long-term behaviour. A nonstandard pin-bearing strength test methodology, developed at The University of Warwick, is used to provide targeted test results for a comprehensive test matrix of 150 batches having 5 or 10 nominally identical specimens per batch. A key contribution from the pin-bearing strength characterisation is that the in-house test method (WUTS) is shown to be suitable for the determination of pin-bearing strengths for flange and web materials, for bolting with or without thread and sizes from M 10 to M 20, and with a PFRP material orientated at 0 o, 45 o or 90 o to the direction of pultrusion. Thread in bearing does not always have an adverse effect, and it is found that both thread pitch and material orientation have a significant contribution on the measured pin-bearing strength. It is recommended, for the situation when thread is in bearing, a reduction factor of 0. 7 is applied to the characteristic plain pin-bearing strength value in the bearing strength equations. Accelerated aging regimes and long-term strength prediction modelling has shown a mean pinbearing strength reduction of up to 25...|$|E

6000|$|... 1. The earliest, {{the most}} frequent, {{perhaps the most}} {{beautiful}} of all the groups, is also the simplest; the two shafts arranged as at b or c, (Fig. XIV.) above, bearing an oblong mass, and substituted for the still earlier structure a, Fig. XIV. In Plate XVII. (Chap. XXVII.) are three examples of the transition: {{the one on the}} left, at the top, is the earliest single-shafted arrangement, constant in the rough Romanesque windows; a huge hammer-shaped capital being employed to sustain the thickness of the wall. It was rapidly superseded by the double shaft, as on the right of it; a very early example from the cloisters of the Duomo, Verona. Beneath, is a most elaborate and perfect one from St. Zeno of Verona, where the group is twice complicated, two shafts being used, both with quatrefoil sections. The <b>plain</b> double <b>shaft,</b> however, {{is by far the most}} frequent, both in the Northern and Southern Gothic, but for the most part early; it is very frequent in cloisters, and in the singular one of St. Michael's Mount, Normandy, a small pseudo-arcade runs along between the pairs of shafts, a miniature aisle. The group is employed on a magnificent scale, but ill proportioned, for the main piers of the apse of the cathedral of Coutances, its purpose being to conceal one shaft behind the other, and make it appear to the spectator from the nave as if the apse were sustained by single shafts, of inordinate slenderness. The attempt is ill-judged, and the result unsatisfactory.|$|R
40|$|Biopsy {{specimens}} from 19 {{patients with}} transient regional osteoporosis were studied. All patients presented with pain. There were nine patients with transient osteoporosis of the hip. Six of these specimens were therapeutic core biopsies, and three were femoral heads removed during total hip replacement. The other patients with osteoporosis in different locations had biopsies {{to rule out}} infection or neoplasm. Five of these patients had transient osteoporosis of the knee. Three had ankle involvement and two had involvement of the tibial <b>shaft.</b> <b>Plain</b> radiographs were available for study in all cases, and either a bone scan or an MRI was studied in each case. Except for one patient who was lost to follow-up, all had resolution of symptoms and radiographic changes. The histologic changes in the biopsies were distinctive, although they were present in varying degrees. There was edema and reactive bone formation in the marrow spaces. In addition, osteoclastic bone resorption was active in 14 of the 19 cases. Although lipid cysts were sometimes found in the marrow spaces, {{there was no evidence}} of fat necrosis or bone necrosis. The high bone turnover and absence of fat necrosis suggests that this disorder is a vasomotor response rather than an early stage of osteonecrosis. Awareness of these characteristic histologic changes should enable the pathologist to make a specific diagnosis of transient regional osteoporosis when a biopsy is required...|$|R
2500|$|Over {{many years}} Shook and Kidder {{developed}} the Kaminaljuyu ceramic sequence, and it remains, with refinements by Shook and Marion Popenoe de Hatch, {{one of the}} most secure and reliable ceramic chronologies in Mesoamerica, although some doubts remain about the absolute dates due to a paucity of radiocarbon anchors (a revision by Inomata, et al. to the following chronology, based on Bayesian analysis, would push forward the ceramic phases by as much as 300 years, setting the Miraflores apogee to a 100 BC – AD 100 time frame). With Inomata, et al's revision in mind, the first significant settlement dates to the Arévalo phase, c. 900–800 BC, with indications of dense populations no later than c. 400 BC.

60|$|The next morning's {{sunshine}} dispersed {{the black}} {{mood of the}} night before; but enough of Colville's self-disgust remained to determine him not to let his return to Florence be altogether vain, or his sojourn so idle as it had begun being. The vague purpose which he had cherished of studying the past life and character of the Florentines in their architecture shaped itself anew in the half-hour which he gave himself over his coffee; and he turned it over in his mind with that mounting joy in its capabilities which attends the contemplation of any sort of artistic endeavour. No people had ever more distinctly left the impress of their whole temper in their architecture, or more sharply distinguished their varying moods from period to period in their palaces and temples. He believed {{that he could not}} only supply that brief historical sketch of Florence which Mrs. Bowen had lamented the want of, but he could make her history speak an unintelligible, an unmistakeable tongue in every monument of the past, from the Etruscan wall at Fiesole to the cheap, <b>plain,</b> and tasteless <b>shaft</b> raised to commemorate Italian Unity in the next piazza. With sketches from his own pencil, illustrative of points which he could not otherwise enforce, he could make such a book on Florence as did not exist, such a book as no one had yet thought of making. With this object in his mind, making and keeping him young, he could laugh with any one who liked at the vanity of the middle-aged Hoosier who had spoiled a set in the Lancers at Madame Uccelli's party; he laughed at him now alone, with a wholly impersonal sense of his absurdity.|$|R
