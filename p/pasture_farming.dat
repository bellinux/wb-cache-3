40|$|Owing to {{strongly}} volatile and temporarily very low milk payout {{over the last}} years with operational costs showing an upward trend, organic milk production associated with intense pasture utilization has gained in excellence. Our contribution compares a sample of 38 randomly selected South German <b>pasture</b> <b>farms</b> with conventionally farming top enterprises in the financial years 2009 – 2011. The results obtained demonstrate that in spite of the smaller sizes of the 34 selected firms, organic <b>pasture</b> <b>farms</b> can generate higher hourly earnings than conventionally farming top enterprises thanks to high basic ration performance from cheap pasture grass and low input of concentrated feed with high prices for organic milk. This advantage will even be greater with increasing prices for concentrated feed and/or operating resources if the milk prices are kept {{at the level of the}} previous years...|$|R

50|$|With the {{acceleration}} of the Australian cattle industry over the past decade, Australian geography has undergone serious environmental changes which have affected marsupial lawns.

50|$|Agriculture is {{the largest}} {{industry}} in the county, especially dairy milk processing as well as pig and beef farming. Much of Cavan's land consists of clay soils, which are rich in minerals, but heavy and poorly drained, making <b>pasture</b> <b>farming</b> the dominant farming system in the county. There is a total farmed area of 144269 ha in the county, and there are approximately 219,568 cattle in Cavan.

5000|$|Although debatable, many {{agricultural}} historians {{also believe}} that the introduction of convertible husbandry was brought about {{with the introduction of}} the turnip.

[...] They believe that this [...] "fodder" [...] crop pushed agriculture in a direction in which [...] "alternating" [...] husbandry was seen as more efficient than traditional permanent <b>pasture</b> <b>farming</b> and jump-started the improvement of crop rotation and agricultural output versus capital. Although the turnip was popularized by Lord Townshend during the mid-18th century, the use of turnips being grown as fodder was seen as early as the 16th century.|$|E

The objective {{of this study was}} to determine spatial distribution of the physical, climatic and socioeconomic aspects that best characterize the production of dairy goats in Brazil. Production indices of milk per goat, goat production, milk production, as well as temperature range, mean temperature, precipitation, normalized difference vegetation index, relative humidity, altitude, agricultural farms; <b>farms</b> with native <b>pasture,</b> <b>farms</b> with good quality <b>pasture,</b> <b>farms</b> with water resources, farms that receive technical guidance, family farming properties, non-familiar farms and the human development index were evaluated. The multivariate analyses were carried out to spatialize climatic, physical and socioeconomic variables and so differenciate the Brazilian States and Regions. The highest yields of milk and goat production were observed in the Northeast. The Southeast Region had the second highest production of milk, followed by the South, Midwest and North. Multivariate analysis revealed distinctions between clusters of political-administrative regions of Brazil. The climatic variables were most important to discriminate between regions of Brazil. Therefore, it is necessary to implement animal breeding programs to meet the needs of each region...|$|R

40|$|High-resolution digital {{elevation}} models (DEMs) {{are useful for}} the detailed mapping of geomorphological features. Nowadays various sensors and platforms are available to collect 3 D data. The presented study compares terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) and low-cost unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) -based imaging {{in terms of their}} usability for capturing small-scale surface structures. In October 2014 and June 2015 measurements with both systems were carried out in an episodically water-filled karst depression under <b>pasture</b> <b>farming</b> in the region of Hohenlohe (Southwest Germany). The overall aims were to establish high-resolution DEMs and monitor changes of the relief caused by dissolution and compare the advantages and drawbacks of both systems for such studies. Due to the short time between the campaigns the clear detection of temporal changes was hardly possible. However, the multi-temporal campaigns allowed an extensive investigation of the usability of both sensors under different environmental conditions. In addition to the remote sensing measurements, the coordinates of several positions in the study area were measured with a RTK-DGPS system as independent reference data sets in both campaigns. The TLS- and UAV-derived DEM heights at these positions were validated against the DGPS-derived heights. The accuracy of the TLS-derived values is supported by low mean differences between TLS and DGPS measurements while the UAV-derived models show a weaker performance. In the future years additional simultaneous measurements with both approaches under more similar vegetation conditions are necessary to detect surface movements. Moreover, by investigating the subsurface the interaction of above and below ground processes might be detected...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} consequential costs of livestock depredation by large carnivores. We estimate costs for productivity losses and additional labor using Swedish survey data on sheep farmers. Impacts on productivity and labor are identified through a comparison of sheep farmers in areas with low and high carnivore densities, farmers that have suffered attacks, and summer pasture farmers that have and have not suffered attacks, respectively. Results indicate that sheep herds in areas with high densities of carnivores and in herds that have experienced carnivore attacks have lower reproductive rates than do herds in areas with low densities of carnivores. Farmers who have experienced a carnivore attack on their livestock spend extra labor on fence maintenance, searching for lost animals, and bringing the animals in for the night. The use of enforced so-called carnivore fences has a significant impact on time spent on fence maintenance and on searching for lost animals. Finally, results show that costs for farmers that have experienced an attack differ between farms that keep the sheep within fences, and summer <b>pasture</b> <b>farms</b> that apply free-range grazing. Results from the study can motivate the use of a flat rate compensation per ewe in the herd, which is differentiated between farms in areas with high carnivore densities and conventional and summer <b>pasture</b> <b>farms</b> that have suffered an attack...|$|R
