25|$|Pučnik was {{released}} from jail in 1966. After several unsuccessful attempts to find a job, he decided to emigrate to Germany. He settled in Hamburg, making a living from manual jobs. When he decided to enrol as a <b>postgraduate</b> <b>student</b> at the University of Hamburg, the University of Ljubljana refused to provide him {{with a copy of}} his degree.

During his life in Germany, Pučnik became a supporter of the German Social Democratic Party, maintaining close relations with several of its leaders.

40|$|Programmes such as peer {{learning}} and peer assisted study sessions are increasingly {{used to support}} undergraduate students in many academic institutions. These programmes are regularly evaluated, monitored and proven to have academic and social benefits for learners. However, <b>postgraduate</b> <b>students,</b> especially international students are not the main target of these programmes. This study targeted international <b>postgraduate</b> <b>students.</b> The action research method was used to investigate how {{peer learning}} could support international <b>postgraduate</b> <b>students</b> in their learning journey and enhance their learning experience. Two former/experienced <b>postgraduate</b> <b>students</b> were invited to share their learning experience with thirty four new international <b>postgraduate</b> <b>students</b> in two sessions. After the two presentations, participants completed a self-administrated open-ended feedback questionnaire to evaluate the two sessions. An open-ended feedback questionnaire {{was used as the}} main research tool to gather the primary data and thematic analysis was used to analyse the collected qualitative data. The findings revealed that students enjoyed this learning opportunity; majority of participants thought that the two peer learning sessions were useful, insightful, thoughtful, inspirational and beneficial. In conclusion, peer learning is an important tool to enhance the learning experience of international <b>postgraduate</b> <b>students</b> and enrich their educational journey. Therefore, the outcomes of this action research contribute to the growing body of knowledge on peer learning and international <b>postgraduate</b> <b>students...</b>|$|R

25|$|In 1924, as a <b>postgraduate</b> <b>student</b> {{with more}} time, Frazer finally played {{first-class}} cricket for Oxford University. He played {{in most of}} the team matches in the 1924 season, batting mainly in the middle order, but his best score and his only total ever of more than 50 was made as an opening batsman, with 81 in the match against H. D. G. Leveson-Gower's XI at Eastbourne, a rather weak team composed entirely of amateurs, many of them not in the first flush of youth (Ernest Smith, the captain, was 54 and had played for Oxford University 36 years earlier in 1888). Frazer's timing for a big innings was immaculate: the next Oxford game was the University Match and he duly won a cricket blue to go with his two soccer blues, scoring 5 and 20 in his two innings in a nine-wicket defeat by Cambridge. Frazer played seven further matches for Sussex when the university term was over, without success, and appeared for two amateur teams in first-class matches against Oxford University in 1925, but {{that was the end of}} his first-class cricket career.|$|E
