40|$|An {{analysis}} is given {{of the requirements}} placed on the elements of parametric centimeter waveband amplifiers for achievement of minimal noise temperatures. A low-noise semiconductor parametric amplifier using germanium <b>parametric</b> <b>diodes</b> for a receiver operating in the 4 GHz band was developed and tested confirming the possibility of satisfying all requirements...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} an S-Band parametric amplifier {{which was designed}} and subsequently built to study this type of amplifier at microwave frequencies. The signal, idling and pump were at the frequencies 2975, 7000, and 9975 megacycles respectively. The amplifier worked satisfactorily giving stable gains as high as 20 db. The bandwidth was, however, very low. Some theoretical investigations were performed on such topics as the stability and optimum load of the amplifier, and the negative conductance of <b>parametric</b> <b>diodes.</b> Some technical details about the construction, operation and measurements are also included...|$|R
50|$|In 1958 Heilmeier joined RCA Laboratories in Princeton, New Jersey, {{where he}} worked on <b>parametric</b> amplification, tunnel <b>diode</b> down-converters, {{millimeter}} wave generation, ferroelectric thin film devices, organic semiconductors and electro-optic effects in molecular and liquid crystals. In 1964 he discovered several new electro-optic effects in liquid crystals, {{which led to the}} first working liquid crystal displays based on what he called the dynamic scattering mode (DSM).|$|R
5000|$|At Macquarie University, Marshall {{performed}} {{research with}} J. A. Piper on stimulated Raman scattering. While in the United States his research work was {{mainly on the}} development of <b>parametric</b> oscillators, <b>diode</b> laser-pumped solid-state lasers, fiber lasers, and laser stabilization. Marshall was an extremely active scientist publishing over 100 papers mostly over a 6 year period. He led a resurgence in Optical Parametric Oscillators, notably inventing the [...] "eyesafe laser" [...] enabling lasers to be used safely around humans, the single-frequency solid-state blue laser for submarine imaging, the highest efficiency frequency doubled laser, solid state UV289nm laser for detection of tryptophan, nonlinear cavity dumping using OPOs, the intra-intra-cavity OPO for wide IR tunable medical lasers, and the first high power all solid state green laser for ophthalmology.|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{propose a}} fiber-based system aimed at {{generating}} radially and azimuthally polarized beams over spectral ranges of several tens of nanometers. The device is either adaptable to polychromatic {{sources such as}} supercontinuum fiber lasers or to tunable ones (optical <b>parametric</b> oscillator, laser <b>diode,</b> etc.). A preliminary version of the system has been engineered {{to work in the}} visible portion of the spectrum. The concept proposed here can be adapted to the infrared or blue-UV spectral domains. As a starting application, polychromatic Bessel beams of the first order have been produce...|$|R
