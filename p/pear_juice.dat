Song restaurant and tavern menus are recorded which list entrées for feasts, banquets, festivals, and carnivals. They reveal a diverse and lavish diet for those of the upper class. They could choose {{from a wide variety}} of meats and seafood, including shrimp, geese, duck, mussel, shellfish, fallow deer, hare, partridge, pheasant, francolin, quail, fox, badger, clam, crab, and many others. Dairy products were rare in Chinese cuisine at this time. Beef was rarely consumed since the bull was a valuable draft animal, and dog meat was absent from the diet of the wealthy, although the poor could choose to eat dog meat if necessary (yet it was not part of their regular diet). People also consumed dates, raisins, jujubes, pears, plums, apricots, <b>pear</b> <b>juice,</b> lychee-fruit juice, honey and ginger drinks, pawpaw juice, spices and seasonings of Sichuan pepper, ginger, soy sauce, oil, sesame oil, salt, and vinegar.|$|E

50|$|Apple and <b>pear</b> <b>juices</b> are of {{particular}} interest to pediatricians because the high concentrations of free fructose in these juices can cause diarrhea in children. The cells (enterocytes) that line children's small intestines have less affinity for fructose absorption than for glucose and sucrose. Unabsorbed fructose creates higher osmolarity in the small intestine, which draws water into the gastrointestinal tract, resulting in osmotic diarrhea. This phenomenon is discussed in greater detail in the Health Effects section.|$|R
40|$|Perry pear {{polyphenols}} {{were characterized}} in fruit, juice and pomace for two cultivars and at two maturity stage. Cell walls were characterized only in fruits and pomaces.

Juices of ripe fruits contained 38 % (Plant de Blanc) and 28 % (De Cloche) of initial polyphenols, whereas overripe <b>pear</b> <b>juices</b> contained only 26 % and 15 % respectively. Thus, procyanidins had more affinity for cell walls after overripening.

40|$|Cyclic voltammetry {{was used}} to {{investigate}} the electrochemical behavior of nitrite at a platinum-modified glassy carbon electrode (Pt-CME) in phosphate buffer (pH 4. 5). Experiments in flow injection analysis and ion-chromatography (IC) were performed to characterize the electrode as an amperometric sensor for the determination of nitrite ions. The effects of several common interferences on the amperometric signal were estimated. The electrode stability, precision, limit of detection, and linear range were evaluated at a constant applied potential of 1. 1 V. Calibration plots were linear from 0. 03 mu M to 0. 5 mM with a slope of about 21 mu A/mM and a correlation coefficient of 0. 9987. The limit of detection (LOD) was 15 nM (0. 7 ppb) in a 100 mu L injection. The electrode response was sufficiently stable: over 6 h of operating time a 2. 8 % signal loss was observed. The determination of nitrite in milk and <b>pear</b> <b>juices</b> was achieved by IC and the relevant results were compared with those obtained with a standard spectrophotometric method...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — The crude {{pigments}} {{obtained from}} yellow prickly <b>pears</b> <b>juice,</b> were evaluated for their stability at series of pH: from 3 to 6. 5 {{in the presence}} of different ascorbic acid or citric acid concentrations as stabilizers. The effect of exposure to light and dark between temperatures values: 70 and 100 °C and varied heating time from 5 to 60 min were also estimated. The stability of betaxanthins pigments was measured {{on the basis of their}} UV-visible absorption spectrum. The six variables: pH, ascorbic acid, citric acid, light, heating time and temperature were selected and then, a screening of them was carried out with a design optimal experimental to determine the influential factors. Optimization was conducted with three factors: temperature, length of heating time and pH. They were modelled with a central composite experimental design. Then, the model was validated by statistical test and the optimum has been found and checked by three experiments. The optimal conditions that maximized the retention of betaxanthins pigments were: temperature of 76 °C, heating time of 16. 20 min and pH of 5. 76. At these conditions, the predicted rate of retention of pigment was 79 %...|$|R

40|$|Fruits and {{vegetables}} are important for maintaining the human health, and, thus, they are present in everyday consumers' basket. They are seasonable and perishable products and, as a result, {{they need to be}} processed and transformed into cans and preserved products. The objective of this research is to identify the main directions of developing the sector of preserved fruits {{and vegetables}} products. Pursuing this, a survey was carried out, for collecting data about consumers' buying behaviour, their preferences for preserved fruits and vegetable, buying frequency and budgets spent for these products, on average, per month. Research findings show that over 94 per cent of respondents consume preserved vegetables and fruits. Among preserved vegetables, broth, tomato juice, pickles and frozen vegetables are consumed frequently. As regards preserved fruits, apples / <b>pears</b> <b>juice</b> is consumed more often than other products. The most important criteria for choosing canned vegetables and fruits products are composition, taste and origin. These results are useful for better understand consumers' behaviour of buying processed vegetables and fruits and to decide, further on, the directions of developing food processing industry for vegetables and fruits...|$|R

2500|$|In 2008, {{based on}} its ongoing testing {{of a wide variety}} of American foods for toxic chemicals, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration set the [...] "level of concern" [...] for {{inorganic}} arsenic apple and <b>pear</b> <b>juices</b> at 23 ppb, based on non-carcinogenic effects, and began blocking importation of products in excess of this level; it also required recalls for non-conforming domestic products.

Though the methodology was disputed (it did not distinguish between organic and inorganic arsenic) the tests showed levels of arsenic up to 36 ppb.

Mean patulin concentrations in conventional apple <b>juices,</b> <b>pear</b> <b>juices,</b> other juices and fruits purees were 3. 14, 0. 22, 0. 19, 0. 11 μg kg- 1, respectively, and 7. 11, 11. 46, 2. 10, 0. 18 μg kg- 1 in the relevant organic products. Four samples of juices (one conventional and two organic apple, and one organic pear) contained patulin at concentrations above the limit of 50 μg kg- 1, four at concentrations between 10 and 25 μg kg- 1, and the remaining ones below 10 μg kg- 1.
