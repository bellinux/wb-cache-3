5|$|Extensively reared animals may subsist {{entirely on}} forage, but more intensively kept {{livestock}} will require energy and protein-rich foods in addition. Energy is mainly derived from cereals and cereal by-products, {{fats and oils}} and sugar-rich foods, while protein may come from fish or meat meal, milk products, legumes and other plant foods, often the by-products of vegetable oil extraction. Pigs and poultry are non-ruminants and unable to digest the cellulose in grass and other forages, so they are fed entirely on cereals and other high-energy foodstuffs. The ingredients for the animals' rations can be grown on the farm or can be bought, {{in the form of}} <b>pelleted</b> or cubed, compound foodstuffs specially formulated for the different classes of livestock, their growth stages and their specific nutritional requirements. Vitamins and minerals are added to balance the diet. Farmed fish are usually fed <b>pelleted</b> food.|$|E
5|$|Insects {{form part}} of the human diet in some cultures, and in Thailand, crickets are farmed for this purpose in the north of the country and palm weevil larvae in the south. The crickets are kept in pens, boxes or drawers and fed on {{commercial}} <b>pelleted</b> poultry food, while the palm weevil larvae live on cabbage palm and sago palm trees, which limits their production to areas where these trees grow. Another delicacy of this region is the bamboo caterpillar, and the best rearing and harvesting techniques in semi-natural habitats are being studied.|$|E
5|$|Modern animal {{husbandry}} relies on production systems {{adapted to the}} type of land available. Subsistence farming is being superseded by intensive animal farming in the more developed parts of the world, where for example beef cattle are kept in high density feedlots, and thousands of chickens may be raised in broiler houses or batteries. On poorer soil such as in uplands, animals are often kept more extensively, and may be allowed to roam widely, foraging for themselves. Most livestock are herbivores, except for the pig which is an omnivore. Ruminants like cattle and sheep are adapted to feed on grass; they can forage outdoors, or may be fed entirely or in part on rations richer in energy and protein, such as <b>pelleted</b> cereals. Pigs and poultry cannot digest the cellulose in forage, and require cereals and other high-energy foods.|$|E

25|$|Long-term use of NSAIDs {{can lead}} to mucosal damage of the colon, {{secondary}} to decreased levels of homeostatic prostaglandins. Mucosal injury is usually limited to the right dorsal colon, but can be more generalized. Horses may display acute or chronic intermittent colic, peripheral edema secondary to protein losing enteropathy, decreased appetite, and diarrhea. Treatment involves decreasing the fiber levels of the horse's diet by reducing grass and hay, and placing the horse on an easily digestible <b>pelleted</b> feed until the colon can heal. Additionally, the horse may be given misoprostol, sucralfate, and psyllium to try to improve mucosal healing, as well as metronidazole to reduce inflammation of the colon.|$|E
25|$|Horses {{should not}} be fed {{directly}} {{on the ground in}} areas where sand, dirt and silt are prevalent, although small amounts of sand or dirt may still be ingested by grazing. Management to reduce sand intake and prophylactic treatments with sand removal products are recommended by most veterinarians. Such prophylaxis includes feeding a <b>pelleted</b> psyllium for one week every 4–5 weeks. Longer duration of treatment will result in gastrointestinal flora changes and the psyllium to be broken down and ineffective for sand clearance. Other methods include feeding the horse before turnout, and turning the horses {{out in the middle of}} the day so they are more likely to stand in the shade rather than graze.|$|E

40|$|The {{contribution}} of zooplankton fecal <b>pellets</b> to {{particulate organic carbon}} (POC) flux in the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) was investigated to predict the effect {{of changes in the}} zooplankton community due to rapid climate change on flux of fecal <b>pellets</b> to the deep sea. Fecal <b>pellets</b> were collected in a moored sediment trap from 2005 to 2009, along the continental shelf of the WAP. Fecal <b>pellet</b> shape, size, and color were quantified to assess flux of <b>pellets</b> from different zooplankton taxa, and compared between seasons and years. Fecal <b>pellet</b> POC flux constituted a significant proportion of total POC flux, with summer <b>pellet</b> C flux (68 % of total) significantly higher than in winter (36 %) (n = 11, 270). Cylindrical <b>pellets,</b> produced by euphausiids, contributed to a monthly mean of 79 % of fecal <b>pellet</b> flux, with copepod and salp <b>pellets</b> contributing significantly less (15 % and 6 %, respectively, of total fecal <b>pellet</b> flux). Cylindrical and ovoid <b>pellets</b> were significantly higher in summer samples, while 90 % of tabular <b>pellet</b> flux occurred in the winter. Tabular <b>pellets</b> were the largest (median size = 0. 8 �gC/fecal <b>pellet),</b> followed by cylindrical <b>pellets</b> (0. 2 �gC/fecal <b>pellet),</b> with ovoid <b>pellets</b> the smallest (0. 02 �gC/fecal <b>pellet).</b> The largest tabular <b>pellets</b> contained up to 3 -orders of magnitude more carbon than cylindrical <b>pellets.</b> Most fecal <b>pellets</b> were dark or light brown in color (suggesting an herbivorous or omnivorous diet), and < 1 % of <b>pellets</b> were white or red (detritivorous/ carnivorous diet). Zooplankton fecal <b>pellets,</b> especially from krill, are a significant component of carbon flux in the WAP. Loss of sea-ice due to climate change is making this region less suitable for krill, and more suitable for salp populations. Loss of krill and increase in salps could significantly change export of POC to the deep sea in this region, resulting in enhanced, but highly variable flux, with a possible increase in phytodetritus contribution to flux...|$|R
25|$|Meconium, or {{the first}} feces {{produced}} by the foal, is a hard <b>pelleted</b> substance. It is normally passed within the first 24 hours of the foal's life, but may become impacted in the distal colon or rectum. Meconium impaction is most commonly is seen in foals 1–5 days of age, and {{is more common in}} miniature foals and in colts more than fillies (possibly because fillies have a wider pelvis). Foals will stop suckling, strain to defecate (presents as an arched back and lifted tail), and may start showing overt signs of colic such as rolling and getting up and down. In later stages, the abdomen will distend as it continues to fill with gas and feces. Meconium impactions are often diagnosed by clinical signs, but digital examination to feel for impacted meconium, radiographs, and ultrasound may also be used.|$|E
25|$|Corydoras aeneus is not {{particular}} about {{the composition of}} the water. Adequate conditions are a temperature range of 20 to 28 °C (68 to 82 °F), pH of 6.0–8.0, and hardness of 2–30 DGH. The water should have no salt added to it. A fairly dense growth of plants with a number of possible hiding places is greatly appreciated. Corys are easy to feed, they are omnivores eating all flake and <b>pelleted</b> food and also live and frozen foods. When it comes to sperm, then the female glues the eggs, only a few in number, to the chosen substrate and then (sometimes) quickly touches them with her mouth. After several acts of spawning, which span a total of two to three hours, one female will have produced up to 200 eggs. Frequently, two males are used for each female, as one male has difficulty fertilizing all the eggs. The eggs gradually grow darker in color, and just prior to hatching (ranging from three days at 28 °C to a week at 20 °C) they turn dark brown. The fry keep {{to the bottom of the}} tank, feeding on detritus and any fine foods available. The parents may spawn again within two to three weeks.|$|E

40|$|At {{the present}} work the UO 2 fuel {{production}} process was extensively studied and analyzed. The objectives of such investigation were {{to understand and}} analyze the influence of different additives and the variation of the production process steps on the microstructure and consequently in the mechanical strength of the nuclear fuel <b>pellet.</b> Moreover, an improvement of the qualitative characteristics of the ceramic fuel <b>pellets</b> was also aimed. For this purpose UO 2 <b>pellets</b> without additives, the so-called standard <b>pellets,</b> <b>pellets</b> containing as additive for example AZB (Azodicarbonamid), black U 3 O 8 (Oxidized uranium <b>pellet</b> scrap - OS), green U 3 O 8 (Oxidized uranium powder - OP), keratin fibers (a non conventional additive) were produced. The introduction of these additives to the UO 2 powder mixture prior or after the granulation production step and in different concentrations produced several microstructure configurations. As {{it would not be}} possible to analyze all of them here so during the investigation pre-tests some of them were separated to be studied in more detail. <b>Pellets</b> with AZB added after the granulation presented larger grains and larger pores than those with AZB added before granulation, also porosity free grains and a granulate structure instead of a homogeneous one. <b>Pellets</b> with OS present fine porosity distributed all over the <b>pellet</b> matrix with some porosity clusters whereas <b>pellets</b> containing OP show in its matrix porosity agglomerated in form of hooks. As for the grain size, a more uniform grain size distribution can be observed in <b>pellets</b> OS than in <b>pellets</b> with OP. The variations in the amount of keratin fibers added, sintering dwell time and green density resulted indeed in different microstructures. Nevertheless, some common characteristics among them were observed such as the presence of elongated pores, porosity clusters and larger grains located at the <b>pellets</b> borders while the smaller ones were concentrated more in {{the central part of the}} <b>pellet.</b> This distribution of grains was identified as bi-modal structure. The mentioned microstructure aspects certainly influence on the mechanical properties of the fuel <b>pellet.</b> However, the sintering parameters, the green and final <b>pellet</b> density and the <b>pellet</b> dimensions also have an influence on the mechanical characteristics of the <b>pellets.</b> For studying the influence of all these parameters on the <b>pellet</b> mechanical properties four testing procedures were utilized the so-called squirrel-cage where the mechanical resistance of the not sintered <b>pellets</b> against mechanical shocks was tested, the diametrical compression test (Brazilian Test) where the strength of sintered and not sintered <b>pellets</b> was studied, the Vickers indentation technique and the creep test where the <b>pellet</b> plasticity respectively at room and at elevated temperatures was analyzed. The squirrel-cage results showed that the <b>pellets</b> with keratin fibers were much more mechanically resistant than those <b>pellets</b> without it, which means that the keratin fibers acted, prior sintering, as a powder binder increasing the cohesion among the powder granules proportionating the green <b>pellets</b> higher mechanical resistance against impacts. The Brazilian test evaluated the influence of the <b>pellet</b> length to the <b>pellet</b> diameter (L/D ratio), the influence of different additives mixed to the UO 2 powder and the different <b>pellet</b> production processes. The L/D influence analysis showed that if one fixes the <b>pellet</b> diameter and increase the <b>pellet</b> length the Weibull modulus (here a measure of the <b>pellet</b> lot reliability) will also increase. By comparing <b>pellets</b> with OS, OP and 0. 3 % keratin fibers it was observed that <b>pellets</b> with OS presented the highest volume of pores smaller than 10 mm while <b>pellets</b> with OP and keratin presented the highest volume of pores larger than 20 mm. It seems that this relevant characteristic favored to the highest Weibull strength value for <b>pellets</b> with OS. In the indentation test standard <b>pellets,</b> <b>pellets</b> with OS and <b>pellets</b> with keratin fibers were tested. The results showed that the calculated hardness for the standard <b>pellets</b> is slightly lower when compared to the values obtained by the <b>pellets</b> with keratin fibers. Also the <b>pellets</b> containing OS when compared to the keratin fibers <b>pellets</b> have in most of the cases a lower hardness. The calculated fracture toughness and fracture surface energy values show also a better mechanical behavior for the keratin fibre <b>pellets</b> than in the standard <b>pellets.</b> Standard <b>pellets,</b> <b>pellets</b> with 30 %OP, which had the smallest grain size, <b>pellets</b> with keratin fibers, having the bi-modal structure and <b>pellets</b> with chromium oxide, which had the largest grain size, were tested in the creep furnace. The results showed that all <b>pellets</b> with additives presented a better creep behavior than the standard <b>pellets.</b> Among the <b>pellets</b> prepared with additives the comparison clearly showed that under lower stresses <b>pellets</b> with smaller grains have a better creep rate. By increasing the applied stresses we observe an improvement of the creep rate of the <b>pellets</b> with chromium oxide and keratin fibre even slightly overcoming the <b>pellets</b> with 30 %OP at the highest applied stress.
