40|$|AbstractCorporate {{governance}} matters {{because how}} well corporations utilize the people's savings matters. Many developed economies mandate that corporations be run for their <b>public</b> <b>shareholders.</b> This {{is not because}} shareholders are superior to employees, bankers, bondholders, customers, suppliers, or anyone else. Rather, it is because poor governance usually harms <b>public</b> <b>shareholders</b> before it harms others. Well engineered disclosure rules make corporations transparent, so poor governance quickly depresses share prices, alarming shareholders who demand corrective measures. Ideally, all this happens before the problem grows large enough to harm employees, customers, or other stakeholders. Governing corporations for shareholders really amounts to ‘using’ shareholders as early warning alarms and automatic correction mechanisms. But sound government policies are necessary, for this works if corporations are rendered transparent and <b>public</b> <b>shareholders</b> are empowered to force changes. Other stakeholders cannot fulfill this role as well because shareholders’ wealth is most directly tied to the firm's economic efficiency...|$|R

40|$|This study employs {{conditional}} event study methodology to analyze how managers’ personal motives affect the {{method by which}} firms repurchase their shares. To address this question, we examine insider trading activities around the announcement date of a stock repurchase. We find that firms {{are more likely to}} choose tender offers rather than an open market repurchases when the respective announcements are followed by heightened net insider sales. The results are most significant in the two months subsequent to the announcement. Our findings remain robust when examining the relationship between net insiders sales and stock repurchase methods in a sample that includes matched firms. We do not find any significant correlation between pre-announcement insider trading and the type of repurchase method a firm employs. Similarly, there are no differences between the long-term accounting or stock price returns of our sample firms when comparing the two repurchase methods. Our findings support Fried (2000) who proposes that tender offer repurchases are used by insiders to directly or indirectly transfer value among shareholders with insiders emerging ahead of the average <b>public</b> <b>shareholder.</b> As such, they should be of interest to investors and policymakers involved in the regulation of insider financial transactions...|$|E
40|$|Public {{companies}} in the United States and elsewhere increasingly use open market stock buybacks, rather than dividends, to distribute cash to shareholders. Academic commentators have emphasized the possible benefits of such repurchases for shareholders. However, {{little attention has been}} paid to their potential drawbacks. This Article explains that managers currently are able to use open market repurchases and misleading repurchase announcements to enrich themselves at public shareholders’ expense. Managers, aware their stock is underpriced, frequently use repurchases to indirectly buy stock for themselves at a bargain price. Managers have also been able to boost stock prices by announcing repurchase programs they did not intend to execute, perhaps to unload their own shares at a high price. Such bargain repurchases and inflated-price sales systematically transfer significant amounts of value from one set of shareholders (public investors) to another (managers). Low-price buybacks are also likely to reduce aggregate shareholder value by distorting managers’ payout and investment decisions, further reducing <b>public</b> <b>shareholder</b> returns. The Article concludes by proposing a new approach to regulating open market repurchases: requiring managers to disclose specific details of the firm’s buy orders in advance. This pre-repurchase disclosure rule would undermine managers’ ability to use repur- chases for informed trading and false signaling, thereby reducing the resulting distortions and costs to shareholders. Moreover, it would achieve these objectives without eroding any of the potential benefits of repurchases. Previously circulated under the title “Share Repurchases and Managerial Opportunism”...|$|E
40|$|Countries {{in which}} billionaire heirs' wealth is large {{relative}} to G. D. P. grow more slowly, {{show signs of}} more political rent-seeking, and spend less on innovation than do other countries at similar levels of development. In contrast, countries in which self-made entrepreneur billionaire wealth is large relative to G. D. P. grow more rapidly and show fewer signs of rent seeking. We argue that {{this is consistent with}} wealthy entrenched families' having objectives other than creating <b>public</b> <b>shareholder</b> value. Also, the control pyramids through which they are entrenched give wealthy families preferential access to capital and enhanced lobbying power. Entrenched families also have vested interest in preserving the value of existing capital. To investigate these arguments, we use firm-level Canadian data. Heir-controlled Canadian firms show low industry-adjusted financial performance, labor capital ratios, and R&D spending relative to other firms the same ages and sizes. We argue that concentrated, inherited corporate control impedes growth, and dub this the Canadian disease. ' Further {{research is needed to determine}} the international incidence of this condition. Finally, heir-controlled Canadian firms' share prices fell relative to those of comparable firms on the news that the Canada-U. S. free trade agreement would be ratified. A key provision of that treaty is capital market openness. Under the treaty, heir-controlled Canadian firms' labor capital ratios rose, while the incidence of heir-control fell. We suggest that openness, especially of capital markets, may mitigate the ill effects of concentrated inherited control. If so, capital market openness matters for reasons not captured by standard international trade and finance models. ...|$|E

40|$|This work {{analyses}} {{the presence}} of public shareholding in limited companies in European countries. Firms owned by public bodies (State or local authorities) {{can be found in}} many economic sectors. This type of governance stretches its influence beyond its traditional domains, including business areas in which competition is a common feature. In recent years these companies have changed in some cases their usual governance, including private shareholders alongside public entities: companies whose ownership is shared among public and private entities are often called mixed enterprises. The analysis not only focuses on public central ownership; it also presents and analyses the evidence of a strong local public shareholding in European enterprises. A very demanding and time consuming part of the work has been building a unique database, which has then been studied in its different facets. This database includes more than 5, 600 EU companies with public shareholders; more than 40 % of them are participated by local authorities. The data analyzed were collected from the official accounts of the same companies. The main results of the analysis can be summarized as follows. First, the descriptive statistics have shown that public ownership, both at central and local level, is widespread in Europe. Such ownership has however different degrees of importance across industries. Second, the analysis of the companies' financial figures has pointed out some clear differences between Western European Countries and Eastern European Countries. Despite undeniable progress, in many sectors Eastern European Countries firms still suffer from their starting point, inadequacy of the infrastructure and different degree of technological development. In the same way, we document and test the disparities between different sectors within the same Country and between the same sectors across Countries. For example, at European level the sector with the highest profitability appears to be finance (followed by communications), while the countries with the highest profitability appear to be Luxembourg followed by Estonia and Slovakia. A further analysis has compared the value added produced by companies where a <b>public</b> <b>shareholder</b> is present and the total values added of European regions. This has confirmed the remarkable relevance of the companies with public shareholdings on the economy of the countries considered, which amounts to an average value of 4. 7 % of the value added, which in some regions reaches 15 %. This result remains true at the local level: enterprises with local public shareholders have {{a leading role in the}} GDP at the regional level. The Italian case, sometimes indicate as one where the public presence is pathologically high, does not stick out as something too different from what we observe in countries such as France, Germany or the Netherlands. Significant differences were found on the tests on averages and medians. through classifying the companies in the sample by shareholder type, by sector, by geographical area and by governmental from in the local area of reference. Finally, some regression tests were made to show that performance indicators were correlated with some enterprise characteristics - size, activity sector, shareholder type (central or local), and share percentage (total public v. partial public). For the latter we tested whether the institutional structure of the countries to which enterprises belong (federal Countries v. non-federal Countries) and <b>public</b> <b>shareholder</b> type could influence the performance of government-owned enterprises...|$|E
40|$|Aim: The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to investigate whether CSR {{can be used as a}} marketing tool by the readymade garment suppliers in Bangladesh to attract international buyers. Method: This study is conducted by applying qualitative method. The data has been collected through semi-structured interview and using secondary data.   Result and Conclusions: The study reflects that that CSR implementation generates various benefits such as, creates good corporate image, reputation and opportunity for innovation and offers competitive advantage.   As international buyers’ foremost requirement is to verify suppliers’ social compliance, the CSR practices and benefits act as marketing instrument by the garments suppliers to attract international buyers and grab more business. Suggestions for future research: This study considered multiple large (1 st tier) garments suppliers and multinational buying organization which calls for further research such as, a comparative study on taking both large and small scale suppliers as well as more international buyers. One of the findings indicates that buyers’ support is important in CSR implementation which can also be considered for further investigation. Contribution of the thesis: This study investigates suppliers’ CSR practices from the marketing perspective in relation to buyers in business to business context which has not been considered in previous literature. Further CSR as marketing tool has not been addressed in developing country context while this study includes empirical study on garment suppliers of Bangladesh. This study suggests that managers need to be aware of the significant role of CSR as marketing tool while designing and implementing CSR programs effectively to increase business. Moreover, CSR activities benefit both the company as well as other stakeholders (customer, employee, <b>public,</b> <b>shareholder,</b> government) of the society by way of meeting those stakeholders’ interest...|$|E
40|$|This Article {{explores the}} legal {{manifestation of the}} {{interaction}} between the general public and the public corporation. Revisiting team production analysis, this Article redefines the corporate team and argues that while several constituencies indeed form part of the corporate team, others are exogenous to the corporate enterprise. Employees, suppliers and financiers contribute together to the common corporate enterprise, enjoying a long-term relational contract with the corporation, while retail consumers contract with the corporation at arm’s length, and other people living alongside the corporation do not contract with it at all. Under this organizational model, the general public may participate in the team forming the corporate enterprise by providing public financing. Indeed, corporate law was developed to protect public investors. However, evidence shows that most of the listed equity is no longer held by the general public directly; the new shareholders are institutional investors. This Article analyzes the impact of institutionalization on the interaction of corporations with the general public, outlining spheres of potential divergence between institutional and retail investors and raising the timely concern for the agency costs embedded in the relationship between the general public and institutional investors. First, not all institutional investors are investing on behalf of the <b>public.</b> <b>Shareholder</b> empowerment platforms are frequently mobilized by intermediaries representing only the wealthiest 1 %. Second, when shareholders are mostly institutional investors, the likelihood of distributional conflicts between various stakeholder groups is higher because the institutional thought and decision-making patterns do not match those of the general public. The objectives of institutional investors are significantly narrower than, and potentially divergent from, those of the general public. Third, the technology used for trading by institutional investors, algorithmic trading, potentially imposes externalities on retail investors, and ultimately widens the gap between corporations and the general public. It may often be the case that the institutional interests align with those of the general public, but the law does not necessitate it. This Article further discusses converse trends towards convergence, including socially responsible investments and impact investments, corporate social responsibility, sustainability reporting, and customer voice. This Article ultimately suggests policy implications. When shareholders’ interests are not necessarily aligned with those of the general public, we have reason to revisit the axiom of shareholder value as the underlying purpose of corporations, the boundaries of fiduciary duty, and the limited platform and audience for sustainability reporting...|$|E
