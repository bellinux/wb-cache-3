40|$|Main {{effort of}} every design {{engineer}} is reduction of torsional oscillation in any mechanical system. At present this {{problem can be}} solved {{by means of a}} suitable modification of dynamic properties of flexible shaft couplings according to dynamics in the given systems. But the dynamic properties of nowadays-applied flexible couplings arenot unchangeable because of aging and fatigue processes occurring in flexible coupling elements. Result of this fact causes detuning of mechanical system. Taking into consideration the above-mentioned situation, we suggest for mechanical systems application of a newly developed <b>pneumatic</b> <b>couplings</b> that have constant characteristicfeatures during the whole current operation and thus they have a positive influence on the system running...|$|E
40|$|Concepts in roll-interconnected hydro-pneumatic {{suspensions}} with hydraulic and <b>pneumatic</b> <b>couplings</b> {{are developed}} and analysed for enhancement of anti-roll properties of heavy vehicles. The mathematical {{models of the}} roll-coupled suspensions are formulated considering the fluid properties and variable damping valves. The roll properties of fluidically connected suspensions are {{compared with those of}} unconnected suspensions with and without anti-roll bar, and dynamic responses of a heavy vehicle with different suspensions are investigated under excitations arising from road roughness and directional manoeuvres. The results indicate that both interconnected suspensions could considerably improve roll stiffness without affecting vertical ride, while hydraulic interconnections could further enhance the roll mode damping propertie...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{continuous}} tuning of the torsional oscillating mechanical system during its operation, {{we are making}} use of application of the pneumatic flexible shaft couplings, developed by us. By the gaseous medium pressure change in <b>pneumatic</b> <b>couplings</b> we can change its torsional stiffness and thereby the dynamics of whole system too. In term of dynamics is necessary to know the transitional effects of mechanical system, which are arising at its continuous tuning. For the numerical computation of these transitional effects {{it is necessary to}} know the values of flow resistance coefficients at gaseous medium flow into the compression space of pneumatic coupling from the pressure tank and out of compression space into the atmosphere. For that reason presents this paper theoretic and experimental procedure of given coefficients determination...|$|E

40|$|Development and {{application}} of <b>pneumatic</b> flexible shaft <b>couplings</b> {{have been in the}} center of our department research activities for a long time. These couplings are able to change torsional stiffness by changing pressure in their flexible elements – air bellows. Until now we have dealt with the use of <b>pneumatic</b> flexible shaft <b>couplings</b> for tuning mechanical systems working with periodically alternating load torque at steady state. Some mechanical systems, however, operate with a static load torque at constant speed (e. g. hoists, elevators, etc.), where it is necessary to consider the suitability of shaft coupling in terms of load torque at transient conditions (run-up and braking). Therefore we decided to analyze the use of <b>pneumatic</b> flexible shaft <b>couplings</b> also in this type of mechanical systems on an example of conveyor belt drive...|$|R

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to inform the {{technical}} community about new tuning methods of torsional oscillating mechanical systems (TOMS) during operation in a steady state by means of application of pneumatic flexible shaft couplings. It is possible to change the torsional stiffness of <b>pneumatic</b> <b>couplings</b> by means of a change of gaseous medium pressure either out of operation or during operation. There are two possibilities how to tune the torsional oscillating mechanical systems: - tuning of torsion oscillating mechanical systems out of operation, what fulfils condition of given system tuning, - tuning of torsion oscillating mechanical systems during operation in a steady state, what fulfils condition of given system continual tuning. The basic principle of TOMS tuning during operation in the steady state consists in an adjustment of basic dynamical properties of pneumatic coupling according to the system dynamics. This adjustment can be made by means of a regulation system working in regulation circuit arrangement with a feedback. In this way it is possible to change dynamical properties of pneumatic coupling continuously with regard to dynamic of mechanical system, so that it can be eliminated dangerous torsional oscillation of given system in the working mode. ...|$|E

40|$|Mechanical {{systems with}} {{combustion}} engines, compressors, pumps and fans, {{can be characterized}} as torsional oscillating mechanical systems (TOMS). It is therefore necessary to control their dangerous torsional vibrations. It was confirmed that dangerous torsional vibration can be reduced to acceptable level by an appropriate adjustment, respectively by tuning the TOMS. According to several authors, the most appropriate way of system tuning is application of suitable flexible element, which is flexible shaft coupling. It turned out that one of the types of shaft couplings, which are particularly suited to meeting this objective are <b>pneumatic</b> flexible shaft <b>couplings,</b> to act as so-called pneumatic tuners of torsional oscillations. The issue of research and development of pneumatic tuners of torsional oscillations, among other things is, long-term in the focus of the author. The existence of tuners creates the opportunity to develop new ways of tuning torsional oscillating mechanical systems. The author of the scientific article will focus on the characteristics of developed pneumatic tuners of torsional oscillation in terms of their design, construction, function, significance advantages and conditions imposed on pneumatic tuners {{based on the results of}} his patent activity. Simultaneously provides information about the characteristic properties of pneumatic tuners of torsional oscillations in the general design...|$|R
