5|$|<b>Plant</b> <b>technology</b> {{began to}} be turned {{to the problem of}} {{directly}} chilling rooms and containers, to replace the need to carry ice at all. Pressure began to grow for a replacement for ice bunkers on the trans-Atlantic routes during the 1870s. Tellier produced a chilled storeroom for the steamship Le Frigorifique, using it to ship beef from Argentina to France, while the Glasgow-based firm of Bells helped to sponsor a new, compressed-air chiller for ships using the Gorrie approach, called the Bell-Coleman design. These technologies soon became used on the trade to Australia, New Zealand and Argentina. The same approach {{began to be}} taken in other industries. Carl von Linde found ways of applying mechanical refrigeration to the brewing industry, removing its reliance on natural ice; cold warehouses and meat packers began to rely on chilling plants.|$|E

40|$|With a {{large portion}} of U.

Specifically within the planting operation, Corn Belt producers are faced with the challenge to better manage the higher cost of crop inputs in order to sustain profitability. The primary objective of this thesis is to examine new <b>planting</b> <b>technologies</b> that would better manage planting applications while directly lowering related input costs. Another objective is to understand through regression analysis how various planting variables affect yield potential. Results from the regression analysis illustrate how the various planting variables affect yield and show the importance of “real-time ” planter management, advancements possible only with the new planter technology. Customer surveys and several on-site customer visits were conducted throughout the Corn Belt to better understand the actual needs of producers for new <b>planting</b> <b>technologies.</b> Throughout the customer visits, specific questions about the producers...|$|R
