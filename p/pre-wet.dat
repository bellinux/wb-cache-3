40|$|Trickle-flow is {{traditionally}} modeled {{by means of}} hydrodynamic parameters such as liquid holdup, two-phase pressure drop and wetting efficiency. Several studies showed that these parameters are not only a function of flow conditions and bed properties, {{but also of the}} flow history and morphology of flow. These can have a major influence on the distribution in the bed. The effect of flow morphology on liquid holdup and pressure drop is widely discussed in literature, but little attention is paid to its effect on wetting efficiency. Trickle-bed reactor models suggest that not a only bed-averaged but also the distribution of wetting efficiency may be of importance for reactor performance. Both the average wetting efficiency and the distribution of wetting are probably a function flow history and morphology. The distribution of wetting efficiency for different flow morphologies were investigated by means of a colorometric method that was developed for this purpose. Representative wetting distributions could be obtained. Flow morphologies and liquid distributions were manipulated by means of the <b>pre-wetting</b> procedure that was performed prior to flow. Pulse and Levec <b>pre-wetted</b> beds were investigated. These distributions were explained in detail in terms of flow morphology. It was found that the average wetting efficiency in pulse <b>pre-wetted</b> beds are much higher than in Levec <b>pre-wetted</b> beds. All particles in the pulse <b>pre-wetted</b> beds at all investigated flow conditions were contacted by the flowing liquid. This was not the case for the Levec <b>pre-wetted</b> beds. It was found that the flow in Levec <b>pre-wetted</b> beds become similar to that in pulse <b>pre-wetted</b> beds at high liquid flow rates. It was investigated how these distributions can affect reactor modeling, based on popular particle-scale models that relate reactor efficiency to wetting efficiency. According to these models, the wetting efficiency distribution in pulse <b>pre-wetted</b> beds can be characterised by means of only its average value. This is not the case for Levec <b>pre-wetted</b> beds. These results are however a strong function of the models that were employed. Finally, some recommendations are made in terms of the preferred <b>pre-wetting</b> method or flow morphology for different types of reactions. These recommendations are also based on models and have not been verified with experiments. Dissertation (MEng (Chemical Engineering)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2007.

40|$|Initial {{moisture}} and <b>pre-wetting</b> method {{influence on the}} water absorption of recycled concrete aggregates (RCA) have been studied experimentally. For this purpose, RCA were <b>pre-wetted</b> by three methods: soaking under partial vacuum (simulating long term wetting), soaking under atmospheric pressure, and spraying (simulating short term wetting). The {{results show that the}} same initial amount of water in two samples of RCA do not lead to the same total amount of water absorbed by RCA during 5 - 120 min. The latter depends on the way they have been <b>pre-wetted</b> (either long term or short term). It is suggested that this phenomenon is related to the accessibility filled pores in the different <b>pre-wetting</b> methods. So, the <b>pre-wetting</b> history of RCA could change the amount of total water absorbed by the RCA up to 1 %.

Samples of tiger prawns were collected in the Embley River estuary with a small beam trawl at night every 2 wk from September to May for 2 yr (1990 to 1992). The two seagrass sites, which were 11 and 13 km from the river mouth, showed less seasonal variation in salinity than the two algal sites, which were 15 and 20 km from the river mouth. The algal beds at the two upstream sites almost disappeared during the wet season, but the biomass of seagrass did not change significantly between the wet and dry seasons. The grooved tiger prawn (P. semisulcatus), the main species at all sites, comprised 88 % of the total tiger prawn catch over the two years. They were found at all sites during the <b>pre-wet</b> season, but after {{the onset of the}} wet season, they disappeared along with the algae, from the upstream sites.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Flowing water quickly {{saturates}} {{dry surface}} soil as water advances in irrigation furrows. Conversely, rain wets surface soil before runoff occurs. Rapid wetting destroys soil aggregates as water quickly displaces trapped air. Slowly increasing soil water content prior to saturation increases aggregate stability. We hypothesized that instantaneous wetting of dry surface soil during furrow irrigation results in greater soil erosion than if furrow soil was <b>pre—wet</b> immediately before irrigation. We conducted ten irrigation trials on 27 —m long furrows {{in three different}} fields. Soil was <b>pre—wet</b> by surface drip irrigation (12 to 14 nun) or by lightly spraying with water (1. 3 mm). Pre—wetting with drip irrigation significantly (P < 0. 05) reduced soil loss for 5 of the first 7 irrigations compared to dry soil. The pre—wetting effect on soil loss was not always dramatic, but cumulative soil loss for the first seven irrigations was significantly different among the three treatments: 16, 30, and 56 Mg ha- 1 for drip, spray, and dry treatments, respectively. The dry treatment never had less soil loss than either pre—wetting treatment. Pre—wetting furrow soil by spraying apparently did not add enough water to stabilize soil aggregates and decrease soil erosion for most irrigations. This study demonstrated that erosion was greater when water flowed over initially dry soil, which is typical with furrow irrigation, compared to water flowing over initially wet soil, which occurs during rain...|$|E

Insect larvae were more common in the <b>pre-wet</b> and nematodes and ostracods were more common in the late-wet. Little diel variation in diet was noted. Rapid foregut passage rates under field starvation conditions showed that between 55 and 60 % of foregut contents was cleared in 1 h. This result, and the values for mean foregut fullness over 24 h, suggested that small prawns fed continuously through the day and night.

Ag concentration and biokinetics varied widely between the 2 zones, but were less variable among the different seasons (<b>pre-wet,</b> wet and dry). The harbour population had a 2 - to 6 -fold higher Ag tissue concentration than the estuarine population. The insoluble fraction was the predominant pool for Ag subcellular distribution in the green mussels. In both the <b>pre-wet</b> and wet seasons, a lower Ag tissue concentration {{was associated with the}} insoluble fraction in the estuarine population as compared to the harbour population. Ag uptake from the aqueous phase was faster in the estuarine population during all seasons, but no significant relationship between Ag uptake and salinity was found in this study. Dietary uptake of Ag was similar in both populations, although there was a slight difference in assimilation from diatoms and natural seston. Efflux of Ag was 2 times faster in the estuarine population during the wet and dry seasons, which may partially explain the lower Ag tissue burden in the mussels. These results demonstrated a close correlation between Ag kinetics and its subcellular distribution. The percentage of Ag in the heat-sensitive proteins correlated positively to the influx of dissolved Ag and Ag efflux, but negatively to the dietary assimilation. On the other hand, a higher percentage of Ag in the insoluble fraction was related to a higher dissolved uptake rate constant and a lower assimilation. Thus, the role of the individual subcellular fraction in the uptake was exposure pathway-specific.

40|$|Curing {{refers to}} the process of {{maintaining}} the hydration of the concrete as it hardens, or sets up. Concrete is cured to prevent things such as cracking and shrinkage. Autogenous shrinkage occurs internally in concrete because there isnâ€™t enough water in the concrete for hydration, so the concrete rapidly draws out water to complete the hydration cycle, causing internal drying of concrete. There are two types of curing: external and internal. External curing utilizes water from external sources such as saturated burlap mats, ponding, or fogging. Internal curing supplies water from an internal source inside the concrete, such as saturated fine lightweight aggregate (FLWA). FLWA are very porous and when saturated supply an internal source of water. The use of internal curing in concrete mixes reduces the cracking of concrete due to shrinkage. It has already been proven that the first water lost due to hydration is lost from the aggregates inside the concrete, and there is little information on the right amount of <b>pre-wet</b> LWA to use to hydrate a mix without increasing the water/cement ratio (w/c) of the concrete. If the w/c of a concrete is too high, then it will lose its strength properties, but if it is too low then the concrete will experience premature cracking and shrinkage. 	Internal curing is a more efficient, and enhanced, method of curing concrete because of the process that the concrete undergoes. Where external curing requires constant maintenance of the concrete to keep it hydrated, internal curing requires no maintenance because the <b>pre-wet</b> FLWA does all the labor and maintenance that would be required. <b>Pre-wet</b> FLWA has not been used in bridge deck pavement mixes, and thatâ€™s what this project is aiming to accomplish. The American Society of Civil Engineers puts out a report card for the infrastructure in American each year; in 2009 they gave the United States on a whole a C for bridges. They go on to say that 25 %, or one in every four, of Arkansasâ€™ bridges are either structurally deficient or functionally obsolete. Bridge decks carry {{the vast majority of the}} loads on bridges, and when they start to shrink or crack, they become a big part of why a bridge becomes â€œstructurally deficient. â€ Adding internal curing to bridge decks will eliminate the shrinkage and cracking, allowing for more durability and less maintenance, ultimately giving the bridges a longer service life. In this project, two types of fine aggregates, expanded shale and expanded clay, will be used. Batches will be done with mixes containing 100, 200, and 300 lb/ft 3 of lightweight fine aggregate. The drying shrinkage of the concrete will be done using ASTM C 490. Monitoring for the drying shrinkage of each mix design will go on for up to six months after the concrete has been batched. The other big aspect of bridge deck concrete, compressive strength, will be measured at 1 day, 7 days, 28 days, and 90 days...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} the second in a pair {{investigating}} potential mechanisms for ecological regime change in salinising wetlands. The first paper in this series focused on {{the responses of the}} salt-tolerant submerged macrophyte community to salinity. In this second paper, we investigated some of the environmental conditions required for initiation and dominance of benthic microbial communities using a combination of experimental and observational data. Two experiments were carried out. One investigated the importance of prior establishment of benthic microbial communities on their ability to maintain prevalence over macrophyte colonisation ('persistence' experiment), while the other investigated hydrology and its effect on sediment perturbation, potential nutrient release and subsequent benthic microbial community establishment ('flooding' experiment). The 'persistence' experiment measured the biomass of benthic microbial communities and emergence of macrophytes from sediments kept either wet or dry for 4 weeks then flooded at a range of salinities. Benthic microbial biomass was similar across all of the salinities tested (15, 45 and 70 ppt), with a slight increase at higher salinities, suggesting that none of these limited benthic microbial community development. Pre-wetting of sediments usually increased benthic microbial community biomass and reduced macrophyte germination, but the latter was attributed to the presence of anoxic sediments rather than the increased benthic microbial community biomass. Germinating macrophytes emerged through benthic microbial communities or dense heterotrophic bacterial blooms, demonstrating that they could become dominant even when another community was already established. Field data supported these results, suggesting that the development of benthic microbial communities is not limited by salinity alone, but includes other factors, such as the water regime. In the 'flooding' experiment, the largest differences in nutrient concentrations ultimately lay between the <b>pre-wet</b> and pre-dry treatments (due to the greater release of nutrients and development of anoxia in the latter) rather than those subjected to fast versus slow flooding. In response to this, highest benthic microbial community biomass was in treatments with <b>pre-wet</b> sediment, corresponding with lower phytoplankton biomass...|$|E

50|$|A dry tip {{should always}} be <b>pre-wetted</b> by drawing up and {{dispensing}} the chosen volume {{a minimum of three}} times. This action reduces the surface tension on the inside walls of the tip and also provides the proper level of inter-tip humidity, which reduces evaporation of the sample liquid.|$|R
50|$|In 1959, {{the design}} of the final two ships of the class was altered to {{incorporate}} the changes made to the St. Laurent class. These two ships then became a separate class, known as the Annapolis class. The remaining four Mackenzies were essentially improved Restigouches, with improved habitability and better <b>pre-wetting,</b> bridge and weatherdeck fittings to better deal with extreme cold.|$|R
40|$|The {{intrusion}} of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) top layers in Zirfon(R) (polysulfone filled with zirconium oxide) and polyvinylidenefluoride (PVDF) asymmetric support layers is studied. Parameters {{such as the}} porosity of the support, the concentration of the coating solution, the presence of additives in the support during coating and <b>pre-wetting</b> of the supports are investigated with spectroscopical techniques, thermal analysis and pervaporation.
