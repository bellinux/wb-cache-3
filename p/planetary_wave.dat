50|$|According to {{a report}} in New Scientist many {{researchers}} are in consensus that Rossby waves are acting against the jet stream’s usual pattern and holding it in place. Upper atmospheric studies using National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) data indicates that during July 2010 these upper air stream patterns were most frequently observed in the Northern Hemisphere. Examination of the climatology data over the same period of time indicates that these wild <b>planetary</b> <b>wave</b> meanderings are not a normal aspect of our regional climate patterns. Meanwhile, ongoing research studies at the University of Reading show that unusual patterns in the polar jet stream are more common during a period of low activity in the solar cycle when the observed sun spot activity and their associated solar flares are at their minimum. The link between low solar activity and enhanced blocking patterns is associated with an increase in the prevalence of cold weather patterns during the European Winter. Another possible explanation for the observed increase in blocking patterns is natural variability, through the chaotic character of the large-scale ocean currents that flow {{across the surface of the}} tropical Pacific.|$|E
50|$|The {{breakup of}} the {{northern}} polar vortex occurs between mid March to mid May. This event signifies the transition from winter to spring, and has impacts on the hydrological cycle, growing seasons of vegetation, and overall ecosystem productivity. The timing of the transition also influences changes in sea ice, ozone, air temperature, and cloudiness. Early and late polar breakup episodes have occurred, due to variations in the stratospheric flow structure and upward spreading of planetary waves from the troposphere. As a result of increased waves into the vortex, the vortex experiences more rapid warming than normal, resulting in an earlier breakup and spring. When the breakup comes early, it is characterized by with persistent of remnants of the vortex. When the breakup is late, the remnants dissipate rapidly. When the breakup is early, there is one warming period from late February to middle March. When the breakup is late, there are two warming periods, one January, and one in March. Zonal mean temperature, wind, and geopotential height exert varying deviations from their normal values before and after early breakups, while the deviations remain constant before and after late breakups. Scientists are connecting a delay in the Arctic vortex breakup with a reduction of <b>planetary</b> <b>wave</b> activities, few stratospheric sudden warming events, and depletion of ozone.|$|E

The resulting difference {{is used as a}} proxy for traveling <b>planetary</b> <b>waves.</b> A preliminary climatology for these waves is proposed. A ranking of the four wave types in terms of their impact on the total wave state of the atmosphere is achieved, which is dependent on altitude and latitude.

Quasi-stationary <b>planetary</b> <b>waves</b> and tides yield a lesser contribution there. Vertical profiles of total temperature fluctuations show a sharp vertical gradient change("kink" or "bend") in the mesosphere.

In this study, the authors provide new insight into the role of extratropical and equatorial waves in the TTL using high-vertical-resolution GPS radio occultation data. The results examine the influence of four different wave forcings on the TTL: extratropical waves that propagate vertically into the stratosphere, extratropical waves that propagate meridionally into the subtropical stratosphere, extratropical waves that propagate meridionally into the subtropical troposphere, and the equatorial <b>planetary</b> <b>waves.</b> The vertically and meridionally propagating extratropical stratospheric waves are associated with deep, zonally symmetric temperature anomalies that extend and amplify with height throughout the lower-to-middle tropical stratosphere.

5000|$|Sudden stratospheric warming {{events are}} {{associated}} with weaker polar vortices. This warming of stratospheric air can reverse the circulation in the Arctic Polar Vortex from counter-clockwise to clockwise. These changes aloft force changes in the troposphere below. An example of {{an effect on the}} troposphere is the change in speed of the Atlantic Ocean circulation pattern. A soft spot just south of Greenland is where the initial step of downwelling occurs, nicknamed the [...] "Achilles Heel of the North Atlantic". Small amounts of heating or cooling traveling from the polar vortex can trigger or delay downwelling, altering the Gulf Stream Current of the Atlantic, and the speed of other ocean currents. Since all other oceans depend on the Atlantic Ocean's movement of heat energy, climates across the planet can be dramatically affected. The weakening or strengthening of the polar vortex can alter the sea circulation more than a mile beneath the waves. Strengthening storm systems within the troposphere that cool the poles, intensify the polar vortex. La Niña-related climate anomalies significantly strengthen the polar vortex. [...] Intensification of the polar vortex produces changes in relative humidity as downward intrusions of dry, stratospheric air enter the vortex core. With a strengthening of the vortex comes a longwave cooling due to a decrease in water vapor concentration near the vortex. The decreased water content is a result of a lower tropopause within the vortex, which places dry stratospheric air above moist tropospheric air. Instability is caused when the vortex tube, the line of concentrated vorticity, is displaced. When this occurs, the vortex rings become more unstable and prone to shifting by planetary waves.The <b>planetary</b> <b>wave</b> activity in both hemispheres varies year-to-year, producing a corresponding response in the strength and temperature of the polar vortex. The number of waves {{around the perimeter of the}} vortex are related to the core size; as the vortex core decreases, the number of waves increase.|$|E

Observational data from the mesosphere, E-region ionosphere and F-region ionosphere have been combined with stratospheric data from the ECMWF assimilative operational analysis. Fourier and wavelet techniques have shown that the relationship between <b>planetary</b> <b>wave</b> {{activity at}} different altitudes is complex and during the winter eastward wind regime does not conform to a simple combination of vertical <b>planetary</b> <b>wave</b> propagation and critical filtering. Strong <b>planetary</b> <b>wave</b> activity in the stratosphere can coincide with a complete lack of wave activity at higher altitudes; conversely, there are also times when <b>planetary</b> <b>wave</b> activity in the mesosphere, E-region or F-region has no apparent link to activity in the stratosphere. The latitudinal activity pattern of stratospheric data tentatively suggests that when the stratospheric signatures are intense over a wide range of latitudes, propagation of planetary waves into the mesosphere is less likely than when the stratospheric activity is more latitudinally restricted. It is possible that, on at least one occasion, 16 -day <b>planetary</b> <b>wave</b> activity in the mesosphere may have been ducted to high latitudes from the lower latitude stratosphere.

40|$|International audienceRecently, Shalimov et al. (1999) {{proposed}} a new mechanism for large-scale accumulation of long-lived metallic ions in the mid-latitude ionosphere driven by planetary {{waves in the}} lower thermosphere. In this mechanism, the combined action of frictional and horizontal magnetic field forces at E-region altitudes causes the plasma to converge and accumulate in large areas of positive neutral wind vorticity within a propagating <b>planetary</b> <b>wave.</b> The present paper provides a theoretical formulation for this mechanism by modelling both horizontal and vertical plasma transport effects within a <b>planetary</b> <b>wave</b> vortex, of cyclonic neutral wind. Non-steady-state numerical solutions of the ion continuity equation show that the {{proposed a}}ccumulation process can enhance the ionization significantly inside the <b>planetary</b> <b>wave</b> vortex but its efficiency depends strongly on altitude, whereas on the other hand, it can be complicated by vertical plasma motions.

A method has been developed to observe <b>planetary</b> <b>wave</b> activity in the northern hemisphere (51 - 66 ◦N) MLT using neutral atmosphere winds derived from meteor trail drifts observed by a longitudinal chain of Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) radars as a ”ground-based” satellite.

The autumn enhancement has been shown to occur simultaneously with a minimum in gravity wave forcing in the MLT and a poleward perturbation of the meridional circulation, suggesting a temporary forcing through westward momentum deposition by planetary waves. The enhancement in summer results from a year-to-year consistent quasi-stationary <b>planetary</b> <b>wave</b> S 1 structure.
