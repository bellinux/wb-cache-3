5|$|Induction generators, {{which were}} {{often used for}} wind power {{projects}} in the 1980s and 1990s, require reactive power for excitation so substations used in wind-power collection systems include substantial capacitor banks for <b>power</b> <b>factor</b> correction. Different types of wind turbine generators behave differently during transmission grid disturbances, so extensive modelling of the dynamic electromechanical characteristics of a new wind farm is required by transmission system operators to ensure predictable stable behaviour during system faults. In particular, induction generators cannot support the system voltage during faults, unlike steam or hydro turbine-driven synchronous generators.|$|E
5|$|The VFD {{controller}} is a solid-state {{power electronics}} conversion system consisting of three distinct sub-systems: a rectifier bridge converter, a direct current (DC) link, and an inverter. Voltage-source inverter (VSI) drives (see 'Generic topologies' sub-section below) {{are by far}} {{the most common type of}} drives. Most drives are AC-AC drives in that they convert AC line input to AC inverter output. However, in some applications such as common DC bus or solar applications, drives are configured as DC-AC drives. The most basic rectifier converter for the VSI drive is configured as a three-phase, six-pulse, full-wave diode bridge. In a VSI drive, the DC link consists of a capacitor which smooths out the converter's DC output ripple and provides a stiff input to the inverter. This filtered DC voltage is converted to quasi-sinusoidal AC voltage output using the inverter's active switching elements. VSI drives provide higher <b>power</b> <b>factor</b> and lower harmonic distortion than phase-controlled current-source inverter (CSI) and load-commutated inverter (LCI) drives (see 'Generic topologies' sub-section below). The drive controller can also be configured as a phase converter having single-phase converter input and three-phase inverter output.|$|E

25|$|An {{automatic}} <b>power</b> <b>factor</b> correction unit {{consists of}} a number of capacitors that are switched by means of contactors. These contactors are controlled by a regulator that measures <b>power</b> <b>factor</b> in an electrical network.

25|$|Linear loads {{with low}} <b>power</b> <b>factor</b> (such as {{induction}} motors) can be corrected with a passive network of capacitors or inductors.

In such cases, active or passive <b>power</b> <b>factor</b> correction {{may be used to}} counteract the distortion and raise the <b>power</b> <b>factor.</b> The devices for correction of the <b>power</b> <b>factor</b> may be at a central substation, spread out over a distribution system, or built into power-consuming equipment.|$|E
25|$|A high <b>power</b> <b>factor</b> is {{generally}} desirable {{in a power}} delivery system to reduce losses and improve voltage regulation at the load. Compensating elements near an electrical load will reduce the apparent power demand on the supply system. <b>Power</b> <b>factor</b> correction may be applied by an electric power transmission utility to improve the stability and efficiency of the network.

25|$|The <b>power</b> <b>factor</b> in a {{single-phase}} circuit (or balanced three-phase circuit) {{can be measured}} with the wattmeter-ammeter-voltmeter method, where the power in watts is divided by the product of measured voltage and current.

25|$|Regulatory {{agencies}} such as the EU have set harmonic limits as a method of improving <b>power</b> <b>factor.</b> Declining component cost has hastened implementation of two different methods. To comply with current EU standard EN61000-3-2, all switched-mode power supplies with output power more than 75W must include passive <b>power</b> <b>factor</b> correction, at least. 80 Plus power supply certification requires a <b>power</b> <b>factor</b> of 0.9 or more.|$|E
25|$|In an {{electric}} power system, a load {{with a low}} <b>power</b> <b>factor</b> draws more current than a load with a high <b>power</b> <b>factor</b> {{for the same amount}} of useful power transferred.

40|$|In this paper, {{unbalanced}} {{power flow}} calculations {{were used to}} {{study the effects of}} stochastically integrated Distributed Energy Resources (DER) into a distribution network. The considered DER were Electric Vehicles (EVs), Air Source Heat Pumps (ASHPs), and Photovoltaic arrays (PVs). Daily profiles of residential loads and DER were synthesized with a one-minute time resolution. For the considered network, specific nodes were allocated to record the range of voltage magnitudes, voltage unbalances, <b>power</b> <b>factors,</b> and energy losses. Thousands of unbalanced power flow simulations were performed. It was observed that <b>power</b> <b>factors</b> can significantly deteriorate with more installations of PVs.

25|$|For example, to get 1kW of real power, if the <b>power</b> <b>factor</b> is unity, 1kVA of {{apparent}} power {{needs to be}} transferred (1kW ÷ 1 = 1kVA). At low values of <b>power</b> <b>factor,</b> more apparent power needs {{to be transferred to}} get the same real power. To get 1kW of real power at 0.2 <b>power</b> <b>factor,</b> 5kVA {{of apparent}} power needs to be transferred (1kW ÷ 0.2 = 5kVA). This apparent power must be produced and transmitted to the load, and is subject to the losses in the production and transmission processes.|$|E
25|$|A {{disadvantage}} of the inductor is that current is shifted {{out of phase}} with the voltage, producing a poor <b>power</b> <b>factor.</b> In more expensive ballasts, a capacitor is often paired with the inductor to correct the <b>power</b> <b>factor.</b> In ballasts that control two or more lamps, line-frequency ballasts commonly use different phase relationships between the multiple lamps. This not only mitigates the flicker of the individual lamps, it also helps maintain a high <b>power</b> <b>factor.</b> These ballasts are often called lead-lag ballasts because the current in one lamp leads the mains phase and the current in the other lamp lags the mains phase.|$|E
25|$|Thus, {{a circuit}} {{with a low}} <b>power</b> <b>factor</b> will use higher {{currents}} to transfer a given quantity of real power than a circuit with a high <b>power</b> <b>factor.</b> A linear load {{does not change the}} shape of the waveform of the current, but may change the relative timing (phase) between voltage and current.|$|E

25|$|For <b>power</b> <b>factor</b> {{correction}} of high-voltage power systems or large, fluctuating industrial loads, power electronic {{devices such as}} the Static VAR compensator or STATCOM are increasingly used.

25|$|When {{households}} are not charged for the reactive power they consume {{there is almost}} no monetary incentive for them to install <b>power</b> <b>factor</b> correction equipment. This is generally the case today, as household electric meters do not measure apparent power but only real power. Adding <b>power</b> <b>factor</b> correction merely affects the reactive power supplied or drawn and not real power, so utility costs are unaffected. However if there are high-resistance lines connected between the utility meter and a relatively high load then the power as measured by the meter can be reduced by a small amount with <b>power</b> <b>factor</b> correction. Any such savings are usually insignificant.|$|E
