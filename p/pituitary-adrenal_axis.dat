50|$|As {{indicated}} above, ACTH is a {{cleavage product}} of the pro-hormone, proopiomelanocortin (POMC), which also produces other hormones including α-MSH that stimulates the production of melanin. A family of related receptors mediates the actions of these hormones, the MCR, or melanocortin receptor family. These are mainly not associated with the <b>pituitary-adrenal</b> <b>axis.</b> MC2R is the ACTH receptor. While it has a crucial function in regulating the adrenal, it is also expressed elsewhere in the body, specifically in the osteoblast, {{which is responsible for}} making new bone, a continual and highly regulated process in the bodies of air-breathing vertebrates. The functional expression of MC2R on the osteoblast was discovered by Isales et alia in 2005. Since that time, it has been demonstrated that the response of bone forming cells to ACTH includes production of VEGF, as it does in the adrenal. This response might be important in maintaining osteoblast survival under some conditions. If this is physiologically important, it probably functions in conditions with short-period or intermittent ACTH signaling, since with continual exposure of osteoblasts to ACTH, the effect was lost in a few hours.|$|E

40|$|The {{role of the}} vagal nerve {{within the}} immune system has not been fully elucidated. Vagal afferents connect to several central nervous system structures, {{including}} the hypothalamus.

There was a significant increase (p < 0. 05) in serum corticosterone levels following 30 Hz VNS compared to 1 Hz VNS or sham stimulation.

40|$|To {{clarify the}} {{physiological}} role of placental corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), we measured plasma CRH, ACTH, and cortisol throughout pregnancy. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) CRH levels and ACTH responsiveness to synthetic CRH were also quantified in pregnant and nonpregnant women. Maternal plasma CRH levels, which increased progressively during pregnancy, correlated well with both ACTH and cortisol in early labor, delivery, and postpartum samples, {{and also with}} cortisol levels in samples before labor. CSF CRH levels in term pregnant women {{did not differ from}} those of nonpregnant women. CRH infusion that attained similar plasma CRH levels to those found in late pregnancy elicited significant ACTH release in vivo and regular CRH test provoked normal ACTH response during early pregnancy but no response during late pregnancy. We concluded that: (a) maternal <b>pituitary-adrenal</b> <b>axis</b> correlates well with plasma CRH levels, which are high enough to provoke ACTH release from maternal pituitary; (b) hypothalamic CRH secretion in term pregnant women is not exaggerated; and (c) maternal pituitary is responsive to synthetic CRH in early but not late pregnancy, suggesting that maternal <b>pituitary-adrenal</b> <b>axis</b> is already activated by high circulating CRH.

50|$|Researchers {{are still}} unsure what causes low {{emotional}} arousal. Researchers have proposed three theories that {{could account for}} the low emotional arousal. The first theory stresses that emotional arousal is highly genetic. Secondly, some with low emotional arousal show underarousal of the hypothalamus <b>pituitary-adrenal</b> (HPA) <b>axis.</b> The HPA is responsible for the body's stress response. Because there is thought to be underarousal of the HPA axis, studies have shown that this causes reduced secretion of epinephrine and cortisol. These two hormones are responsible for the physiological response to a threat. Third, low emotion arousal often elicits hypoactivity of the amygdala. The amygdala in the brain is part of the limbic system, and is responsible for processing and regulating emotions. This could possibly explain as to why those suffering from low arousal often lack empathy as well as emotional reactivity to other people.|$|R

A significant loss (607 ~) of tolerance to high accelera-tion stress was found in adrenalectomized rats. The procedures of hypophysectomy plus adrenalectomy apparently opposed the effect of each operation alone in the rat to yield an animal that tends to approach the normal rat in its ability to tolerate acceleration.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the hypothalamic- <b>pituitary-adrenal</b> (HPA) <b>axis</b> activity of Holstein- Friesian and crossbreed F 1 heifers by analysis of the cortisol concentrations in hair samples. Cortisol, the primary hormone of the HPA axis, is the biological endpoint for the investigation of the HPA response. The study was conducted on 290 prepubertal heifers; 142 heifers were pure Holstein-Friesian and 148 were crossbreed F 1 heifers obtained from the 3 -way rotational system with Swedish Red and Montbéliarde breeds. Extraction was performed on the hair using methanol, and cortisol concentrations were determined by a radioimmunoassay method. Cortisol concentrations measured in regrown hair of crossbreed F 1 heifers were significantly lower than those in hair of Holstein-Friesian heifers. This result helps us to better understand the differences in HPA activity and allostatic load between Holstein-Friesian and crossbreed F 1 heifers and allows us to better assess the adaptability of these animals to the environment and the importance of crossbreed traits for profitability in dairy farming...|$|R

40|$|Exendin- 4 (Ex 4) is {{a potent}} and {{long-lasting}} agonist of glucagon-like peptide- 1 (GLP- 1), which has been previously found to stimulate <b>pituitary-adrenal</b> <b>axis</b> in the rat. Aim {{of the present study}} was to gain insight into the mechanism(s) involved in the Ex 4 -induced rise in the rat plasma concentrations of ACTH, aldosterone and corticosterone. Preliminary time- and dose-response studies showed that the maximum stimulating effect of Ex 4 occurred within 1 or 2 h and at dose ranging from 0. 5 to 2. 0 nmol/ 100 g body weight. The GLP- 1 receptor (GLP- 1 R) antagonist Ex(9 - 39) did not significantly affect ACTH, aldosterone and cortico-sterone responses to Ex 4. Neither the administration of CRH and arginine vasopressin (AVP) -receptor antagonists nor adrenal demedullation prevented <b>pituitary-adrenal</b> <b>axis</b> responses to Ex 4. The prolonged (4 or 6 days) suppression of the pituitary ACTH release by dexamethasone impaired corticosterone, but not aldosterone response to Ex 4. The following conclusions are drawn: i) Ex 4 stimulates rat <b>pituitary-adrenal</b> <b>axis</b> through receptors other than the classic GLP- 1 R; ii) neither CRH and AVP nor medullary catecholamines are involved in the Ex 4 -induced stimulation of ACTH release; iii) ACTH stimulation accounts for the rise in corticosterone plasma concentration; and iv) the aldosterone secretagogue effect of Ex 4 occurs via a mechanism independent of the stimulation of either ACTH or medullary catecholamines...|$|E

This study assessed whether perceived social support might mitigate the psychological, endocrine and health consequences of caregiver stress in {{parents of children with}} autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Parental caregivers completed measures of {{psychological distress}}, perceived availability of social support and physical health complaints. To capture important parameters of the basal diurnal cortisol pattern, caregivers collected salivary cortisol at waking, 30 minutes post waking, 1200 h and 2200 h on two consecutive weekdays. Psychological distress and self reported physical health complaints were inversely related to scores on all support subscales: tangible, belonging, self esteem and appraisal. Results further revealed a significant, positive association between magnitude of the cortisol awakening response (CAR) and caregivers' self esteem. As a buffer between the stress of caregiving and adverse physical health outcomes, social support acts to reduce stress appraisals and mitigate disturbances of the HPA axis.

Parameters of the HPA axis, such as plasma level of corticosterone, adrenal gland weight, and noradrenaline or adrenaline release, did not differ between controls and Tg 2576 mice.

40|$|RU 486 is a {{synthetic}} steroid hormone antagonist which acts at the receptor level. It has both intrinsic anti-progesterone and antiglucocorticosteroid properties in animals. We investigated the antiglucocorticosteroid activity in humans by evaluating the pituitary-adrenal response to RU 486 {{in men and}} in pregnant and nonpregnant women. In non-pregnant women, RU 486 (approximately equal to 1 mg/kg of body weight per day) produced an interruption of the luteal phase without affecting the <b>pituitary-adrenal</b> <b>axis,</b> thereby indicating a more potent anti-progesterone than antiglucorticosteroid effect. In the course of pregnancy interruption by RU 486 (approximately equal to 4 mg/kg per day), {{there was a significant}} increase in plasma corticotropin, beta-lipotropin, and cortisol concentrations. In normal men, RU 486 administration led to a dose-dependent stimulation of plasma corticotropin, beta-endorphin, and cortisol. This disinhibition of the <b>pituitary-adrenal</b> <b>axis</b> was only observed during the morning hours of the circadian rhythm. When administered concomitantly with 1 mg of dexamethasone at midnight, 6 mg of RU 486 per kg completely suppressed the dexamethasone inhibitory effect on the <b>pituitary-adrenal</b> <b>axis.</b> These results indicate that RU 486 is an antiglucocorticosteroid that disrupts the negative pituitary feedback of both the morning cortisol rise and administered dexamethasone.

40|$|The {{mammalian}} {{stress response}} is mediated {{in large part}} via the hypothalamus-anterior <b>pituitary-adrenal</b> (HPA) <b>axis.</b> The key hypothalamic releasing factor in this axis is corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) (Vale et al. 1983). This 41 -amino-acid peptide is re-leased from the median eminence and transported via the hypophyseal portal blood system to the anterior pituitary, where it increases ynthesis of pro-opiomel-anocortin mRNA and secretion of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH; Vale et al. 1981). ACTH stimulates the pro-duction of glucocorticoids in the adrenal cortex. In addition {{to the role of}} CRH within the HPA stress axis, CRH is expressed in many other regions within the central nervous system where it is thought o in-fluence behavioral, autonomic, and immunological re-sponses to stress (Brown and Fisher 1985; Irwin et al. 1992; Koob and Bloom 1985). CRH has been assigned to human Chromosome (Chr) 8 by Southern blot analysis of somatic ell hy-brids and localized to band 8 q 13 by in situ hybridiza-tion of metaphase chromosomes (Arbiser et al. 1988).

40|$|The aim of {{this review}} {{was to examine the}} {{evidence}} for age-related changes of the hypothalamic– <b>pituitary–adrenal</b> (HPA) <b>axis</b> in both physiological and pathological aging, {{on the basis of the}} many data in the literature, as well as of our personal findings. A statistically significant circadian rhythmicity of serum cortisol was maintained in elderly subjects, even if with a reduced amplitude of the 24 h fluctuations and a trend to an increase of the serum levels in the evening and at night-time, in comparison with young controls. Furthermore, an age-related impairment of HPA sensitivity to steroid feedback was present in elderly people. The occurrence of senile dementia amplified the changes already present in physiological aging. While the cortisol secretion was generally well maintained in aging, the adrenal production of dehydroepiandrosterone and of its sulfate (DHEAS) exhibited an age-related decline. Therefore, the cortisol/DHEAS molar ratio was significantly higher in elderly subjects and even more in demented ones, than in young controls. Due to the opposite effects of cortisol and DHEAS on the brain and particularly on the hippocampal region, the imbalance between glucocorticoids and androgens occurring in physiological and even more in pathological aging, may have adverse effects on the function of this region, whose key role in learning and memory is well known.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Evidence in the {{literature}} suggests stress-related changes of hypothalamus- <b>pituitary-adrenal</b> (HPA) <b>axis</b> in mobbing. We investigated the association between HPA activity and psychological profiles in mobbing, using a multidisciplinary approach. DESIGN: Forty-eight victims of mobbing were evaluated by a working group of the Departments of Occupational Medicine, Psychiatry and Internal Medicine. After an informed consent, a detailed occupational history, a psychiatric interview with Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory 2 (MMPI- 2) administration and a blood sample (8 : 00 AM) for the determination of basal adrenocorticotropin (ACTH), cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEAS) plasma levels were collected. Twenty-six patients received an overnight dexamethasone (dex) test. RESULTS: Mean ACTH, cortisol and DHEAS levels were within normal ranges. The dex-test response was normal, with a significant hormone suppression (ACTH p< 0. 001, cortisol p< 0. 001, DHEAS p< 0. 001). The correlations between basal hormones and the psychometric scales of MMPI- 2 revealed that cortisol was significantly and negatively related to Psychasthenia (Pt, p= 0. 003) and Depression (D, p= 0. 006), while DHEAS showed a significant negative correlation to Hysteria (Hy. p= 0. 008).

40|$|The {{cellular}} {{defense systems}} protect the living body against stress exposure and raise its resistance to harmful stress. The cellular mechanism of this stress-induced resistance, however, remains unknown. The {{present study was}} conducted to clarify this mechanism. We found that laparotomy, conducted two days before the subcutaneous administration of HgCl_ 2, reduced the extent of HgCl_ 2 -induced acute renal tubular necrosis (oxidative stress). Glutathione (GSH), the most abundant and ubiquitous cellular antioxidant, was found to have increased in the kidneys, but not in the adrenals or liver of rats two days after laparotomy. This finding suggests that laparotomy-induced elevation of GSH content raises resistance against oxidative stress. LLC-PK 1 cells, i. e., porcine renal tubule-derived cells, were cultured with butionine salfoximine (BSO), a γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase inhibitor, and cellular GSH contents were reduced. Cells were then exposed to HgCl_ 2. LDH leakage in the medium increased significantly in BSO-pretreated cells, but not in nontreated cells. This in vitro finding confirmed the protective role of GSH against oxidative stress. We then examined the possible participation of the <b>pituitary-adrenal</b> <b>axis</b> in the laparotomy-induced increase in renal GSH. Laparotomy stress activates the <b>pituitary-adrenal</b> <b>axis</b> as is evidenced by the fact that rats undergoing laparotomy had significantly heavier adrenals than those not undergoing it. Two days 2 ̆ 7 administration of ACTH increased renal and adrenal GSH contents significantly in a dose-dependent manner, but not hepatic content. Pretreatment with ACTH also prevented HgCl_ 2 -induced renal damage. In conclusion, we demonstrated that laparotomy-induced resistance to oxidative stress may be mediated by the activation of the <b>pituitary-adrenal</b> <b>axis</b> and the elevation of renal GSH contents...|$|E

40|$|It is well {{established}} in the sheep, that the normal timing of parturition is dependent on a prepartum activation of the fetal <b>pituitary-adrenal</b> <b>axis.</b> We have recently demonstrated {{for the first time}} that embryo number, embryo sex, and alterations in the environment of the early embryo, including exposure to maternal undernutrition during the periconceptional period, alter the timing and level of activation of the <b>pituitary-adrenal</b> <b>axis</b> in the sheep fetus during late gestation. There is a delay in activation of the fetal HPA axis in twin fetuses and we speculate that the diminished adrenocortical responsiveness in the twin fetus may be an adaptive response, which counters the impact of the potential enhanced intrauterine stress experienced by a twin fetus, thereby reducing the possibility of preterm delivery. We have also reported that a moderate restriction of maternal nutrition to during the periconceptional period (from 60 days before and for one week after conception) resulted in an earlier activation of the <b>pituitary-adrenal</b> <b>axis</b> of twin, but not singleton, fetuses during late gestation. A series of studies using assisted reproductive technologies have also found that perturbation of the early embryonic environment results in a dysregulation of placental and fetal growth and development and in the timing of normal parturition. In summary, after several decades of work focused on events in late gestation associated with the prepartum activation and stress responsiveness of the fetal HPA axis, our recent studies indicate that the environment of the early embryo may have a significant role to play in determining the timing and level of the prepartum activation of this axis and potentially on the functional capacity of the axis to respond to acute or chronic stress in later life.

The present study was designed to determine whether exposure to elevated androgen levels early in development demonstrated impairments in cognitive functioning, neuroendocrine control, and brain development parallel to those seen in ADHD children. The animals (SHR and Wistar (WKY) controls) were implanted with testosterone on postnatal day 10 and tested for behavior in a spatial cognition paradigm on postnatal day 45. Plasma samples were collected for determination of adrenocorticotrophin hormone (ACTH) and corticosterone levels as indicators of the basal tone of the <b>pituitary-adrenal</b> neuroendocrine <b>axis.</b> In addition, the density of tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive fibers (an indicator of catecholamine innervation) in the frontal cortex was compared between animals. The current data show that early testosterone treatment in SHR animals resulted in additional deficits in spatial memory in the water maze, but was ineffective in altering the response of WKY animals. Furthermore, SHR rats had high basal ACTH and low corticosterone levels that may indicate a dysfunctional stress axis similar to other reports in humans with persistent ADHD. Finally, there was a further suppression of tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactivity in the frontal cortex of androgen-treated SHR rats. These results support the hypothesis that early androgen treatment may support the neurobiology of animals with genetic predisposition to hyperactivity, impulsivity and inattention {{in a manner consistent with}} the enhanced expression of ADHD-like behaviors...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} the hypothalamic– <b>pituitary–adrenal</b> (HPA) <b>axis</b> activity in response to stress in adult male rats submitted to pituitary stalk compression (PSC) or sham operation. Animals received water or oral salt loading (2 % NaCl) for one or eight days before {{the day of the}} experiment. On the 14 th day post-surgery rats were killed under basal conditions or after 15 min immobiliz-ation stress. In the PSC group urine output increased significantly and plasma vasopressin (AVP) levels failed to respond to osmotic stimuli. Short-term salt load induced a significant increase in AVP levels in the sham-operated group. The PSC group presented higher adrenocortico-trophin (ACTH) and corticosterone levels compared with sham-operated rats, both in water intake and salt load conditions. Immobilization stress induced a similar increase in plasma ACTH and corticosterone concentrations in sham-operated and PSC groups under water intake. How-ever, long-term salt load blunted the ACTH and corticos-terone responses to immobilization stress in sham-operated rats. PSC rats submitted to short- and long-term salt loading presented no changes in ACTH and corticoster-one levels after immobilization. Immobilization stress caused neither AVP responses nor plasma osmolality changes in sham and PSC groups. There was no difference in median eminence AVP content among all groups. In conclusion, the high ACTH and corticosterone levels found in PSC rats under water intake and salt loading conditions suggest an up-regulation of the HPA axis, with a preserved adaptive mechanism to chronic stress...|$|R
40|$|The {{mammalian}} suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) {{contain an}} endogenous pacemaker that generates daily rhythms in behavior and secretion of hormones. We {{hypothesized that the}} SCN imposes its circadian rhythm {{on the rest of}} the brain via a rhythmic release of its transmitters in its target areas. Previously, we demonstrated a pronounced inhibitory effect of vasopressin (VP), released from SCN terminals in the dorsomedial hypothalamus, on the release of the adrenal hormone corticosterone. In the present study, microdialysis-mediated intracerebral administration of the VP V 1 -receptor antagonist was used to pursue the study of the mechanisms underlying the circadian control of basal corticosterone release. Using timed administrations of the VP antagonist divided equally over the day/night cycle, we were able to uncover the existence of an additional stimulatory input from the SCN to the hypothalamo– <b>pituitary–adrenal</b> (HPA) <b>axis.</b> Peak activity of this stimulatory SCN input takes place during the second half of the light period, after the daily peak of VP secretion, with a delay of � 4 – 6 hr. In all likelihood, the inhibitory and stimulatory circadian input via separate mechanisms affects corticosterone release. Together, these two opposing circadian control mechanisms of the HPA axis enable a precise timing of the circadian peak in corticosterone release. Key words: circadian rhythms; vasopressin; glucocorticoids; microdialysis; paraventricular/dorsomedial hypothalamus; suprachiasmatic nuclei The prominent diurnal peak in circulating levels of adrenal steroids before the onset of the daily period of increased activity has been described in numerous species, including rats (Guillemin e...|$|R
40|$|Paradoxically, the <b>pituitary-adrenal</b> <b>axis</b> is not {{activated}} during sodium lactate-induced panic. We {{measured the}} response of another stress-sensitive hormone, prolactin, to standard lactate and placebo infusion in a double-blind randomised design in eight patients with panic disorder and eight matched normal controls. Prolactin release was significantly elevated (P< 0. 05) in panickers compared with non-panickers, whereas ACTH secretion was not activated at all. This differential stress response needs further investigation. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserv...|$|E
40|$|The opiate {{control of}} the <b>pituitary-adrenal</b> <b>axis</b> has been {{investigated}} in normal subjects. The infusion of 1 mg of the met-enkephalin analogue, DAMME, led to a fall in circulating cortisol {{in spite of a}} fall in blood pressure. Conversley, 16 mg of the opiate antagonist, naloxone led to brisk and pronounced elevations in plasma ACTH, lipotrophin (LPH) and cortisol. The rise above basal levels was consistent, irrespective of whether the infusion was given at 09. 00, 18. 00, or 23. 00 h; the peak response obtained was significantly less at 23. 00 h than at either 09. 00 or 18. 00 h. Finally, insulin-induced hypoglycaemia (0. 15 u/kg) or naloxone (25 mg) produced a similar rise in plasma cortisol which was no different when the two stimuli were combined. It is suggested that there is a constant tonic inhibition of the <b>pituitary-adrenal</b> <b>axis</b> by endogenous opiates throughout 24 h, and that the circadian rhythm of ACTH/LPH secretion is not due to changes in opiate tone. However, disinhibition of this tone is likely to be responsible, at least in part, for the rise in cortisol in response to hypoglycaemic stress...|$|E
40|$|The "glucocorticoid cascade hypothesis" for {{pathological}} ageing of {{the brain}} is supported by strong experimental data, but the clinical correlates are far less clear. The basal ACTH and cortisol secretion have been studied {{before and after the}} dexamethasone suppression test in patients {{in the early stages of}} clinically probable Alzheimer's disease and in controls, and the results were all normal. These findings do not support the hypothesis that the pathological brain ageing of Alzheimer's type is caused by hyperactivity of the <b>pituitary-adrenal</b> <b>axis...</b>|$|E
40|$|Objectives Addison's {{disease is}} {{characterized}} by a primary adrenocortical insufficiency associated with a derangement of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis. Before identification of cortisone supplementation therapy, only a few cases of pregnancy in Addison's patients were described. Indeed human pregnancy {{is characterized by}} a physiological state of hypercortisolemia. Corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) is a hypothalamic peptide which regulates the <b>pituitary-adrenal</b> cortex <b>axis,</b> and which is also produced during pregnancy by the human placenta, fetal membranes and decidua. In healthy women, a progressive increase of plasma CRF levels throughout gestation occurs, reaching the highest values at term and during labor, so that a placental source has been suggested. Patients and methods The present study aimed to examine the modification of maternal CRF plasma levels at term and at parturition in two women with Addison's disease. In one patient, the disease was associated with an autoimmune hypothyroidism. Both patients had a normal pregnancy, spontaneous labor, vaginal delivery and a regular postpartum period. Plasma CRF levels were measured during the third trimester of pregnancy (at 32, 36, 40 weeks) in Case 1, while in Case 2 blood samples were drawn at the end of gestation, during labor, at delivery and from the umbilical cord. A group of normal pregnant women (n = 5) was used as a control group. Results Plasma CRF levels during pregnancy did not differ between the Addison's patients and the healthy controls, showing a progressive increase in both groups during the last weeks of gestation. During labor and at delivery, a further significant increase of CRF plasma levels was observed in Case 2...|$|R
40|$|Neurons of the paraventricular {{nucleus of}} the {{hypothalamus}} (PVN) regulate the hypothalamic- <b>pituitary-adrenal</b> (HPA) <b>axis</b> and the autonomic nervous system. Females lacking functional GABA(B) receptors because of a genetic disruption of the R 1 subunit have altered cellular characteristics {{in and around the}} PVN at birth. The genetic disruption precluded appropriate assessments of physiology or behavior in adulthood. The current study was conducted to test the long term impact of a temporally restricting pharmacological blockade of the GABA(B) receptor to a 7 -day critical period (E 11 -E 17) during embryonic development. Experiments tested the role of GABA(B) receptor signaling in fetal development of the PVN and later adult capacities for adult stress related behaviors and physiology. In organotypic slices containing fetal PVN, there was a female specific, 52 % increase in cell movement speeds with GABA(B) receptor antagonist treatment that was consistent with a sex-dependent lateral displacement of cells in vivo following 7 days of fetal exposure to GABA(B) receptor antagonist. Anxiety-like and depression-like behaviors, open-field activity, and HPA mediated responses to restraint stress were measured in adult offspring of mothers treated with GABA(B) receptor antagonist. Embryonic exposure to GABA(B) receptor antagonist resulted in reduced HPA axis activation following restraint stress and reduced depression-like behaviors. There was also increased anxiety-like behavior selectively in females and hyperactivity in males. A sex dependent response to disruptions of GABA(B) receptor signaling was identified for PVN formation and key aspects of physiology and behavior. These changes correspond to sex specific prevalence in similar human disorders, namely anxiety disorders and hyperactivity...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Stress {{inhibits}} {{the development}} of tolerance to morphine analgesia via activating Hypothalamic- <b>Pituitary-Adrenal</b> (HPA) <b>axis.</b> Modified catecholamine systems have been reported following morphine tolerance development. In the current study we tried to evaluate changes in the gene expression levels for MAO-A, MAO-B, COMT and thyrosine hydroxylase (TyH) enzymes following chronic pain, development of morphine tolerance and their combined administration. Methods: Analgesic tolerance was induced by intrapritoneal injections of morphine 20 mg/kg twice a day for 4 days. To study the effect of pain on morphine tolerance, 50 μl of formalin 5 % was injected into the animal paws prior to morphine injections. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR {{was used to evaluate}} the gene expression level in lumbar spinal cord on day 5. Three separate control groups received saline or morphine injections or pain induction. Results: Chronic administration of morphine increased the expression level of MAO-B, decreased the expression of TyH and did not change the expression of COMT and MAO-A. Pain increased the expression of MAO-A, but did not change the expression of MAO-B, COMT and TyH. The combination of morphine treatment and pain induction for 4 days partially reversed the reduced expression of TyH and did not change the expression of MAO-A, MAO-B and COMT. Conclusion: Our results showed that in the context of morphine tolerance, gene expression was changed toward decreased biosynthesis and increased elimination of catecholamines. It seems that chronic administration of morphine caused lower level of catecholamines in spinal neurons and help development of morphine tolerance. Also, chronic pain partially produced compensational changes in gene expression. This may explain for its anti-tolerance effect...|$|R
