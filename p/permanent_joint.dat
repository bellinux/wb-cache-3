500|$|Given {{that the}} role of {{helicopters}} in land force operations was increasing, as was the integration of guided missile destroyers for coastal defence, the board of inquiry recommended an amendment to NATO procedures for amphibious warfare and naval gunfire support, to alert other armed forces to the danger of underestimating a ship's missile engagement zone over land. During the late 1980s, the British government placed more emphasis on joint warfare training, with exercises, such as Purple Warrior, taking place in Oman and Scotland. The board noted the establishment of the <b>Permanent</b> <b>Joint</b> Headquarters, designed {{to put an end to}} the [...] "ad hoc and reactive way" [...] in which operations had been carried out while under single service control. IFF transmitters were fitted to all Army Air Corps and Royal Marine Gazelle and Lynx helicopters, and the problem of operating IFF in the vicinity of Rapier batteries was successfully addressed. The board supported a recommendation that the responsibilities of naval gunfire-support liaison officers could be broadened to include the interpretation of air defence problems during inshore joint warfare operations.|$|E

On 8July 1997, three former communist countries, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Poland, were invited to join NATO, which each did in 1999. Membership went on expanding with the accession of seven more Central and Eastern European countries to NATO: Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovenia, Slovakia, Bulgaria, and Romania. They were first invited to start talks of membership during the 2002 Prague summit, and joined NATO on 29March 2004, shortly before the 2004 Istanbul summit. At that time, the decision was criticised in the US by many military, political and academic leaders as a [...] "a policy error of historic proportions." [...] According to George F. Kennan, an American diplomat and an advocate of the containment policy, this decision [...] "may {{be expected to have}} an adverse effect on the development of Russian democracy; to restore the atmosphere of the cold war to East-West relations, [...] to impel Russian foreign policy in directions decidedly not to our liking." ...|$|E
500|$|The rapidity {{with which}} forces were {{required}} to deploy to Sierra Leone emphasised {{the need for the}} United Kingdom to retain high-readiness forces. That need also vindicated concepts such as the ARG and the spearhead battalion (the capacity in which 1 PARA was serving when it deployed), and protected 1 PARA in the 2004 review of the infantry structure. The 2004 review reduced the total number of British Army battalions from 40 to 36 and created the Special Forces Support Group (SFSG), which was inspired by the success of 1 PARA in Operation Barras. The SFSGâ€”initially formed around 1 PARAâ€”provides specialist capabilities or acts as a force multiplier for British special forces on large or complex operations. As the largest unilateral operation undertaken by the United Kingdom since their creation, the intervention in Sierra Leone was the first major test of the ORLT and joint task force concepts. Both were created {{as a result of the}} 1997 SDR and provide a headquarters staff at very high readiness to command an expeditionary operation at operational level. According to Richards, both were [...] "thoroughly validated" [...] and were vital in coordinating the large numbers of assets deployed at short notice and reporting back to the <b>Permanent</b> <b>Joint</b> Headquarters in Northwood.|$|E

30|$|The {{heat source}} in present {{experimental}} of rigid restraint TSCB is same to electron beam fusion welding. However, the bonding mechanism of rigid restraint TSCB is notably different from electron beam fusion welding which {{is dependent on}} the solidification and crystallization of the welding pool to attain <b>permanent</b> <b>joints</b> while no materials is melted during rigid restraint TSCB. According to above numerical analysis, it can be seen clearly that transversal compressive stress and plastic deformation are developed on the entire bond interface during heating period; meanwhile temperature of materials adjacent to bond interface is high. And thus the requirements of pressure and temperature for atom diffusion are met. Notable atom diffusion between butt-welded specimens is occurred, which promote the formation of <b>permanent</b> solid-state <b>joints.</b> On the other hand, unlike diffusion bonding relied on external force, present method utilizes self-established internal thermal elasto-plastic stressâ€“strain field to promote the atom diffusion between butt-specimens. Therefore it is a thermal self-compressing bonding process.|$|R
