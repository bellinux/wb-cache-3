5|$|Although {{there is}} a single letter for the coronal <b>places</b> <b>of</b> <b>articulation</b> for all consonants but fricatives, when dealing with a {{particular}} language, the letters may be treated as specifically dental, alveolar, or post-alveolar, as appropriate for that language, without diacritics.|$|E
5|$|The Wagiman phonemic {{inventory}} {{is quite}} typical for a northern Australian language. It has six <b>places</b> <b>of</b> <b>articulation</b> with {{a stop and}} a nasal in each. There are also a number of laterals and approximants, a trill and a phonemic glottal stop (represented in the orthography by 'h'). Wagiman also has a vowel inventory that is standard for the north of Australia, with a system of 5 vowels.|$|E
25|$|Izi {{contains}} 26 consonant phonemes classified {{under six}} manners of articulation and five <b>places</b> <b>of</b> <b>articulation</b> which {{are shown in}} the chart below. Consonants are also distinguished by voicing. Both voiced and voiceless stops occur in labial, alveolar, velar, and labio-velar <b>places</b> <b>of</b> <b>articulation.</b> There are also corresponding nasals {{for each of these}} <b>places</b> <b>of</b> <b>articulation.</b> Fricatives are always labials, alveolars, and velars; affricates are always labials and alveolars. Izi has both a lateral and non-lateral liquid, but some speakers replace the non-lateral with the lateral liquid.|$|E
5000|$|... the {{assimilation}} <b>of</b> the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>articulation</b> <b>of</b> one speech sound {{to that of}} an adjacent speech sound. For example, while the sound [...] of English normally has an alveolar <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>articulation,</b> in the word tenth it is pronounced with a dental <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>articulation</b> because the following sound, , is dental.|$|R
50|$|In some languages, allophonic palatalization {{developed}} into phonemic palatalization by phonemic split. In other languages, phonemes that were originally phonetically palatalized changed further: palatal secondary <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>articulation</b> {{developed into}} changes in manner <b>of</b> <b>articulation</b> or primary <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>articulation.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Often the {{resulting}} sound has the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>articulation</b> <b>of</b> {{one of the}} source sounds and the manner <b>of</b> <b>articulation</b> <b>of</b> the other. An example comes from Malay, where the final consonant of the prefix [...] (where N stands for a [...] "placeless nasal", i.e. a nasal with no specified <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>articulation)</b> coalesces with a voiceless stop {{at the beginning of}} the root to which the prefix is attached. The resulting sound is a nasal that has the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>articulation</b> <b>of</b> the root-initial consonant. For example: ...|$|R
25|$|These {{principal}} {{letters are}} divided into four series ("témar") that correspond to the main <b>places</b> <b>of</b> <b>articulation</b> and into six grades ("tyeller") that correspond to the main manners of articulation. Both vary among modes.|$|E
25|$|For <b>places</b> <b>of</b> <b>articulation</b> {{further back}} in the mouth, {{languages}} do not contrast voiced fricatives and approximants. Therefore, the IPA allows the symbols for the voiced fricatives to double for the approximants, {{with or without a}} lowering diacritic.|$|E
25|$|Similarly shaped letters reflect {{not only}} similar <b>places</b> <b>of</b> <b>articulation,</b> but also similar manners of articulation. In the {{classical}} Quenya mode, row 1 represents voiceless stops, row 2 voiced prenasalized stops, row 3 voiceless fricatives, row 4 voiceless prenasalized stops, row 5 nasal stops, and row 6 approximants.|$|E
5000|$|It {{may have}} a glottal <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>articulation.</b> However, it may have no {{fricative}} articulation, {{in which case the}} term 'glottal' only refers to the nature of its phonation, and does not describe the location of the stricture nor the turbulence. All consonants except for the glottals, and all vowels, have an individual <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>articulation</b> in addition to the state of the glottis. As with all other consonants, surrounding vowels influence the pronunciation , and [...] has sometimes been presented as a voiceless vowel, having the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>articulation</b> <b>of</b> these surrounding vowels.|$|R
5|$|The pulmonic {{consonant}} table, {{which includes}} most consonants, is arranged in rows that designate manner <b>of</b> <b>articulation,</b> meaning how the consonant is produced, and columns that designate <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>articulation,</b> meaning {{where in the}} vocal tract the consonant is produced. The main chart includes only consonants with a single <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>articulation.</b>|$|R
25|$|Sources {{differ on}} the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>articulation</b> <b>of</b> these consonants.|$|R
25|$|Warndarang has a {{consonant}} inventory {{similar to}} that of many Australian languages. There are five main <b>places</b> <b>of</b> <b>articulation</b> – bilabial, apico-alveolar, retroflex, lamino-alveolar, and velar – with a stop and a nasal in each, {{with the addition of a}} rarely used interdental stop. There are also two laterals, two rhotics, and two semi-vowels. The presence of a glottal stop is debatable; the glottal stops that Heath heard were unstable and appeared to be optional.|$|E
25|$|Besides {{the lack}} of fricatives, the most {{striking}} feature of Australian speech sounds is {{the large number of}} <b>places</b> <b>of</b> <b>articulation.</b> Nearly every language has four places in the coronal region, either phonemically or allophonically. This is accomplished through two variables: the position of the tongue (front or back), and its shape (pointed or flat). There are also bilabial, velar and often palatal consonants, but a complete absence of uvular or glottal consonants. Both stops and nasals occur at all six places, and in some languages laterals occur at all four coronal places.|$|E
25|$|Dravidian {{languages}} are noted {{for the lack}} of distinction between aspirated and unaspirated stops. While some Dravidian languages have accepted large numbers of loan words from Sanskrit and other Indo-Iranian languages in addition to their already vast vocabulary, in which the orthography shows distinctions in voice and aspiration, the words are pronounced in Dravidian according to different rules of phonology and phonotactics: aspiration of plosives is generally absent, regardless of the spelling of the word. This is not a universal phenomenon and is generally avoided in formal or careful speech, especially when reciting. For instance, Tamil does not distinguish between voiced and voiceless stops. In fact, the Tamil alphabet lacks symbols for voiced and aspirated stops. Dravidian {{languages are}} also characterized by a three-way distinction between dental, alveolar, and retroflex <b>places</b> <b>of</b> <b>articulation</b> as well as large numbers of liquids.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the Hangulphabet, a new writing system that should prove useful {{in a number}} of contexts. Using the Hangulphabet, a user can instantly see voicing, manner and <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>articulation</b> <b>of</b> any phoneme found in human language. The Hangulphabet places consonant graphemes on a grid with the x-axis representing the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>articulation</b> and the y-axis representing manner <b>of</b> <b>articulation.</b> Each individual grapheme contains radicals from both axes where the points intersect. The top radical represents manner <b>of</b> <b>articulation</b> where the bottom represents <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>articulation.</b> A horizontal line running through the middle of the bottom radical represents voicing. For vowels, <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>articulation</b> is located on a grid that represents the position of the tongue in the mouth. This grid {{is similar to that of}} the IPA vowel chart (International Phonetic Association, 1999). The difference with the Hangulphabet being the trapezoid representing the vocal apparatus is on a slight tilt. <b>Place</b> <b>of</b> <b>articulation</b> for a vowel is represented by a breakout figure from the grid. This system can be used as an alternative to the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) or as a complement to it. Beginning students of linguistics may find it particularly useful. A Hangulphabet font has been created to facilitate switching between the Hangulphabet and the IPA...|$|R

40|$|The {{goal of the}} {{presented}} {{study was}} to investigate the use of coarticulatory vowel nasalization in lexical access by native speakers of American English. In particular, we compare the use <b>of</b> coart culatory <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>articulation</b> cues to that of coarticulatory vowel nasalization. Previous research on lexical access has shown that listeners use cues to the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>articulation</b> <b>of</b> a postvocalic stop in the preceding vowel. However, vowel nasalization as cue to an upcoming nasal consonant has been argued to be a more complex phenomenon. In order to establish whether coarticulatory vowel nasalization aides in the process of lexical access {{in the same way as}} <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>articulation</b> cues do, we conducted two perception experiments: an off-line 2 AFC discrimination task and an on-line eyetracking study using the visual world paradigm.

2500|$|In phonology, affricates tend {{to behave}} {{similarly}} to stops, {{taking part in}} phonological patterns that fricatives do not. Kehrein analyzes phonetic affricates as phonological stops. A sibilant or lateral (and presumably trilled) stop can be realized phonetically only as an affricate and so might be analyzed phonemically as a sibilant or lateral stop. In that analysis, affricates other than sibilants and laterals are a phonetic mechanism for distinguishing stops at similar <b>places</b> <b>of</b> <b>articulation</b> (like more than one labial, coronal, or dorsal place).
