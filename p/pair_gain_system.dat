50|$|Digital Access Carrier System (DACS) is {{the name}} used by British Telecom (BT Group plc) in the United Kingdom for a 0+2 <b>Pair</b> <b>gain</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
50|$|A <b>pair</b> <b>gain</b> <b>system</b> {{consists}} of concentrators or multiplexers which combine the separate signals {{into a single}} signal which is transmitted through the existing copper cable pair. The signals are then separated into individual subscriber lines at the customer premises. The pair gain unit which performs the multiplexing can simply provide a second telephone connection over a single subscriber line (called an Analog Multi-Line Carrier or AML) in circumstances where a customer wants to add a new phone line for a fax machine or dial-up internet connection. A larger analog <b>pair</b> <b>gain</b> <b>system</b> made by Anaconda in the 1960s provided seven lines. Some pair gain units can expand the number of subscriber lines available over a single copper pair {{to as many as}} sixty. Large pair gain units are stored in serving area interfaces or metal cabinets typically resembling small apartment-sized refrigerators alongside or near roadways that overlie communications rights-of-way.|$|E
50|$|Analog <b>pair</b> <b>gain</b> {{came into}} disfavor in the 21st century, {{as it is}} {{detrimental}} to high speed dial-up modem connections, does not support 56k and is incompatible with Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) systems. 20th century Subscriber Loop Carrier systems had similar problems. More recent digital <b>pair</b> <b>gain</b> <b>systems,</b> however, restore 56k and DSL capabilities by performing the functions of a DSLAM at the <b>pair</b> <b>gain</b> device.|$|R
50|$|The {{response}} of the company was to hire and train thousands of new employees and to buy much new equipment for them to work on. Underground construction took years, but emergency installation of Anaconda Carrier <b>pair</b> <b>gain</b> <b>systems</b> normally used in rural areas expanded service while construction was in progress. Bell Labs added processing power to their new systems and fixed the software bugs. A new wire center at 1095 Avenue of the Americas and 42nd Street relieved four others in Midtown Manhattan of part of their load, {{as well as providing}} the company with a new headquarters for the next quarter century. The crisis subsided during the 1970s and workers accustomed to heavy overtime had to learn to go home on time and get along on their base pay.|$|R

50|$|DACS (Digital Access Carrier System) {{is a form}} of <b>pair</b> <b>gain</b> used in the United Kingdom. It uses a form of time {{division}} multiple access called ISDN.|$|R
50|$|In telephony, <b>pair</b> <b>gain</b> is the {{transmitting}} {{of multiple}} POTS signals over the twisted pairs traditionally {{used for a}} single traditional subscriber line in telephone <b>systems.</b> <b>Pair</b> <b>gain</b> {{has the effect of}} creating additional subscriber lines. This is typically used as an expedient way to solve subscriber line shortage problems by using existing wiring, instead of installing new wires from the central office to the customer premises. The term was invented in the middle 20th century by analogy with earlier use of gain to extend telephone local loops far from the telephone exchange.|$|R

50|$|More recently, {{the term}} <b>pair</b> <b>gain</b> {{has been used}} to refer to any multiplex/demultiplex unit used between the central office and end users, not just {{equipment}} used with copper twisted pair.|$|R
25|$|<b>Pair</b> <b>gain</b> or {{digital loop}} {{carriers}} (DLCs) are located outside the central office, {{usually in a}} large neighborhood distant from the CO. DLCs are {{often referred to as}} Subscriber Loop Carriers (SLCs), after a Lucent proprietary product.|$|R
50|$|The <b>pair</b> <b>gained</b> notoriety {{from their}} {{exposure}} {{on the popular}} The Howard Stern Show, and released their first album, The Jerky Boys, in 1993. The album topped the Billboard charts and was eventually certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America.|$|R
50|$|Where {{digital loop}} carrier (called Remote Integrated Multiplexer in Australia) is installed, {{broadband}} Internet subscribers may be disappointed when informed that although initial line checks were successful, high speed connections such as ADSL are unavailable due to infrastructure issues. The {{problem is that}} <b>pair</b> <b>gain</b> lines cannot carry high speed data.|$|R
50|$|While {{primitive}} lockout {{devices to}} prevent two subscribers from {{picking up the}} same line {{at the same time}} were proposed relatively early, multiple simultaneous calls did not become viable until the initial tests of transistorised <b>pair</b> <b>gain</b> devices in 1955. Any handset off-hook therefore tied up the line for everyone.|$|R
50|$|Isabella was {{the elder}} of two children, {{she had one}} younger brother Humphrey. Their father died when the pair were still minors, and their mother {{remarried}} three more times. From their mother's third marriage to Raynald of Châtillon, the <b>pair</b> <b>gained</b> two half-siblings: Raymond, who died young and Alice, who married Azzo VI of Este.|$|R
50|$|In direct solar <b>gain</b> <b>systems,</b> the {{composition}} and coating of the building glazing can also be manipulated to optimise the greenhouse effect, while its size, position and shading {{can be used to}} optimise solar gain. Solar gain can also be transferred to the building by indirect or isolated solar <b>gain</b> <b>systems.</b>|$|R
2500|$|When Jandamarra's close friend, an Englishman named Richardson, {{joined the}} police force in the 1890s, Jandamarra, a skilled {{horseman}} and marksman, was employed as his native tracker. Unusually for the time, Jandamarra was treated as an equal and the <b>pair</b> <b>gained</b> a reputation as the [...] "most outstanding" [...] team in {{the police force}} at that time.|$|R
50|$|At the 2013 PTT Pattaya Open, Wongteanchai again {{partnered with}} her sister Varatchaya after the <b>pair</b> <b>gained</b> entry by an {{alternate}} spot. The pair defeated third seeds Chan Hao-ching and Chan Yung-jan in the first round. They then defeated Irina Buryachok and Valeria Solovyeva in the quarterfinals before losing to Akgul Amanmuradova and Alexandra Panova in the semifinals.|$|R
50|$|Upon {{the release}} of their Passion bootleg remix in May 2012, the <b>pair</b> <b>gained</b> {{attention}} from music blogs. Since then they have released two singles, {{both of which have}} hit number one on the ARIA Club Chart & featured in the Australian Single Charts. They have played numerous shows around Australia, Asia and North America, and their music has been supported by artists such as Tiesto, Steve Aoki and A-Trak.|$|R
50|$|Some {{connections}} {{may be as}} low as 20 kbit/s {{in extremely}} noisy environments, such as {{in a hotel room}} where the phone line is shared with many extensions, or in a rural area, many miles from the phone exchange. Other factors such as long loops, loading coils, <b>pair</b> <b>gain,</b> electric fences (usually in rural locations), and digital loop carriers can also slow connections to 20 kbit/s or lower.|$|R
40|$|We have {{analyzed}} the NA 58 data on J/ψ suppression in Pb+Pb collisions. J/ψ production {{is assumed to}} be a two step process, (i) formation of cc̅ pair, which is accurately calculable in QCD and (ii) formation of J/ψ meson from the cc̅ pair, which can be conveniently parameterized. In a pA/AA collision, a cc̅ <b>pair</b> <b>gain</b> relative square momentum as it passes through the nuclear medium and some of the cc̅ <b>pairs</b> can <b>gain</b> enough momentum to cross the threshold to become an open charm meson, leading to suppression in pA/AA collisions. A new prescription is proposed for the gain in momentum square, consistent with Krammer process. The model without any free parameter could explain the E_T dependence of J/ψ over Drell-Yan ratio.

5000|$|Fibre in {{the loop}} (FITL) systems are {{functionally}} equivalent to DLC. FITL accomplishes the same two primary functions DLC was intended for: <b>pair</b> <b>gain</b> {{and the elimination of}} electrical constraints due to long metallic loops. FITL architectures vary from simply deploying fibre feeder plants (between central office and remote terminal site) to [...] "fibre to the curb" [...] and, ultimately [...] "fibre to the home" [...] where an optical network unit (ONU) is located at each home.|$|R

40|$|A {{method is}} {{proposed}} that utilizes a Feshbach resonance to cool an atomic gas to temperatures of quantum degeneracy. Through {{application of a}} sequence of alternating adiabatic and nonadiabatic magnetic field ramps {{in the region of}} a Feshbach resonance, a large number of atom pairs in a trapped gas lose energy at the expense of {{a relatively small number of}} <b>pairs</b> which <b>gain</b> energy.

5000|$|What a pair they made! They {{just about}} {{slaughtered}} a top-class field of international riders, {{with all our}} best home lads. Only Michel Rousseau, later that year to become world sprint champion, {{was able to take}} a points sprint from them. That was in the first sprint, too; thereafter the German <b>pair</b> <b>gained</b> not only every sprint for points but every prime prize as well ... They went on to Coventry meeting held over Easter and did much the same thing, winning everything in which they rode, so classy was their performance.|$|R
50|$|With {{the advent}} of {{sophisticated}} electronics {{in the early part}} of the 1990s, telephone service providers developed methods to share a single copper line to transmit multiple telephone calls simultaneously. Various <b>pair</b> <b>gain</b> methods using time-division multiplexing and frequency-division multiplexing prevented interference between simultaneous calls. A distant suburb may have a subscriber loop carrier or digital loop carrier system in which a remote concentrator is located near the subscribers to connect multiple local subscriber loops to one common line to a central office exchange. A single optical fibre can also be shared between multiple subscribers in fibre to the cabinet systems.|$|R
2500|$|I Wanna Hold Your Hand (1978), {{starring}} Nancy Allen, and [...] Used Cars (1980), starring Kurt Russell, were well-received critically {{but were}} commercial failures. I Wanna Hold Your Hand {{was the first}} of several Zemeckis films to incorporate historical figures and celebrities into his movies. In the film, he used archival footage and doubles to simulate the presence of The Beatles. After the failure of his first two films, and the Spielberg-directed bomb 1941 in 1979 (for which Zemeckis and Gale had written the screenplay), the <b>pair</b> <b>gained</b> a reputation for writing [...] "scripts that everyone thought were great [...] somehow didn't translate into movies people wanted to see." ...|$|R
50|$|This {{collector}} is very responsive - {{in the sun}} it {{heats up}} rapidly and the air inside starts to convect. If the collector were to be directly connected to the building using a hole near the floor and a hole near the ceiling an indirect solar <b>gain</b> <b>system</b> would be created. One problem with this that, like Trombe walls, the heat would radiate back out at night, and a convection current would chill the room during the night. Instead, the air movement can be stopped using automatic dampers, {{similar to those used}} for ventilating foundation spaces in cold climates, or plastic film dampers, which work by blocking air flow in one direction with a very lightweight flap of plastic. The addition of the damper makes the design an efficient isolated solar <b>gain</b> <b>system.</b>|$|R

The Supreme Court of Canada ruled that the Indian Act was not discriminatory, as the <b>pair</b> <b>gained</b> the legal rights of white women {{at the same time}} they lost the status of Indian women, in a parallel to R. v. Drybones (supra). In 1981, Sandra Lovelace, a Maliseet woman from western New Brunswick forced the issue by taking her case to the United Nations Human Rights Committee, contending that she should not have to lose her own status by her marriage. The Canadian law was amended in 1985.|$|R
5000|$|TNT and Dan The Dyna-Mite are {{the secret}} identities of {{chemistry}} teacher and track coach Thomas N. [...] "Tex" [...] Thomas and his student Daniel Dunbar. While working together with some [...] "radioactive salts", they discover they {{are charged with}} atomic energy. Thomas is charged with positive energy, while Dunbar is charged with negative energy. Thomas makes a pair of rings which keeps the energy dormant until they are touched together, {{at which point the}} <b>pair</b> <b>gains</b> enhanced strength, speed, and resistance to injury, and the ability to generate different forms of energy. Thomas generates heat, while Dan can generate short bursts of electricity. The series ran through Star-Spangled Comics #23 (August 1943).|$|R
