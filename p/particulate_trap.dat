40|$|ABSTRACT- In {{order to}} improve the {{performance}} of electric diesel <b>particulate</b> <b>trap</b> (E-DPT) that has been proposed by the authors, behavior of trapping and re-burning of diesel soot was investigated using an electric diesel <b>particulate</b> <b>trap</b> {{with a pair of}} electro-plates (1 -channel E-DPT). The E-DPT was capable to trap soot by applying DC electric field between electro-plates. Experimental results showed that soot was accumulated on the electro-plates and some of soot deposits were like whiskers. Soot trapped on the plates formed bridge structures in narrow space between electro-plates and was ignited with Joule heat of electrification. When a soot bridge was re-burned, soot deposits on the plates near the bridge were also re-burned. After the re-burning, a new soot bridge was re-formed and above behaviors were automatically repeated...|$|E

The E-DPT is capable to trap soot particles by applying DC electric field between electro-plates. The results showed that soot particles like a whisker grew up from negative electrode side toward positive one. Soot particles trapped on the plates formed many soot bridges in narrow space between electro-plates. Formation of soot particles depended on electric intensity. In the condition of F= 200 kV/m, lumps of soot were observed instead of whisker like soot bridges and soot trapping and soot re-burning were balanced. Ignition of the soot lump was occurred at the contact point between the lump and electro-plate, however re-burning of whole the lump was rarely observed. Remained soot drifted to down stream. It is thought that many remained soot particles were discharged from the E-DPT. Incomplete reburning of soot lump caused soot removal efficiency deterioration of E-DPT. In the case of narrow space and high electric intensity (F= 600 kV/m, L= 0. 5 mm), however, soot bridge re-burning was main phenomenon and soot lump re-burning was controlle...|$|E

40|$|Catalytic {{combustion}} is {{an important}} area of catalysis and is used in energy production {{as well as in}} the abatement of harmful emissions of various types. This thesis is focused on three different areas of catalytic combustion: - Catalytic combustion of diesel soot - Development of catalytically active wire meshes through thermal spraying - Stabilisation and activation of g-alumina for methane combustion The first part of the thesis gives an introductory description of different aspects of catalytic combustion. This part also includes a review of different catalytic burners which have been studied during the course of the research work. Emissions of diesel soot may be trapped and combusted in a <b>particulate</b> <b>trap</b> coated with catalytically active materials. The soot particles must be combusted at temperatures prevailing in diesel exhausts, generally between 150 and 400 °C. To facilitate effective combustion at these temperatures, the <b>particulate</b> <b>trap</b> should be coated with an oxide catalyst consisting of V 2 O 5 /CuO (V:Cu= 0. 9 on molar basis). Catalytically active wire meshes offer a number of advantages over pellets and monolith catalysts. They combine geometric flexibility with excellent mass- and heat- transfer characteristics and a low pressure drop. By using a modified thermal spray technique, it is possible to produce porous adhesive ceramic coatings on metal surfaces. The specific surface area can be increased through deposition of a high-surface-area material into the macro-porosity of the as-sprayed layer. The ceramic layer is finally activated through a conventional impregnation technique. Palladium dispersed onto a Si-stabilised g-alumina is an appropriate combustion catalyst at temperatures below 1000 °C. Adding small amounts of rhodium or platinum to the palladium increases the catalyst activity but decreases the catalyst's stability to thermal deactivation. The addition of rare-earth-metal oxides will lead to increased thermal stability but to a decreased activity. Long-term deactivation tests show that the activity for combustion of methane decreases to the same extent as the value of the specific surface area, thus indicating that the alumina surface may play an important role during the activation of adsorbed methane molecules...|$|E

40|$|While total exhaust {{emissions}} from individual road vehicles {{continue to be}} reduced, {{it is becoming increasingly}} important to identify and quantify the residual chemical compounds in tail-pipe emissions that are potential hazards to the environment and to human health. Diesel particulate matter (DPM) is known to consist mostly of carbonaceous soot together with minor components, such as volatile organic fractions (from unburned fuel), lubricating oil, and inorganic compounds that include ash and sulphur compounds. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are invoked as the key intermediates in diesel soot formation. These are mutagenic air pollutants formed as by-products of combustion. PAH-precursors identified in soot include single ring structures such as benzene and toluene. Soot nucleation and growth gradually leads to the formation of five to six membered ring structures, such as benzopyrene, dibenzopyrene and coronene. Several methods have been devised to reduce the emissions of DPM, which include the use of a diesel particulate filter, or a technology which combines selective catalytic reduction of NOx with a regenerating <b>particulate</b> <b>trap</b> in a single unit. These oxidise the combustible content of the particulate matter collected on the filter through a non-catalytic reaction with NO 2. As an alternative, the more difficult catalysed oxidation of soot by direct reaction with O 2 has been gaining a lot of attention. Several {{studies have shown that the}} oxidation of soot requires a redox catalyst, such as CeO 2, CeO 2 -ZrO 2 and CeO 2 -ZrO 2 -Al 2 O 3, or other reducible metal oxides including perovskites and spinels.

In this work, we have carried out a speciation of soot that has been sourced from a diesel <b>particulate</b> <b>trap.</b> The soluble components have been identified by GC-MS, following extraction by Soxhlet and ultrasonication techniques. The speciation has been repeated as a function of temperature during the non-catalysed and catalysed combustion of the soot, allowing the conversion of individual components to be tracked.

The hindsight focuses on the evolution and fate of riverine dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) in the Yangtze Estuary from 1999 to 2010.

This shows that, in the past decade, the estuary has changed from being a source of DIP to being a sink, and from a heterotrophic system to an autotrophic system.

To approach the problem, a total of five different configurations are investigated and a comparison of conventional and state of the art heat transfer enhancement technologies is included. Two groups of configurations are examined: a) a classical shell and tube heat exchanger using staggered cross flow tube bundles with smooth circular tubes, finned tubes and tubes with dimpled surfaces, and b) a cross flow plate heat exchanger, initially with finned surfaces on the exhaust gas side and then with 10 ppi and 40 ppi metal foam material substituting for the fins.

A drawback to the traditional honeycomb monoliths under these operating conditions is poor mass transfer to the catalyst surface in the straight-through channels. ''Robocasting'' is a unique process developed at Sandia National Laboratories that can be used to manufacture ceramic monoliths with alternative 3 -dimensional geometries, providing tortuous pathways to increase mass transfer while maintaining low-pressure drops. These alternative 3 -dimensional geometries may also provide a foundation for the development of self-regenerating supports capable of trapping and combusting soot particles from a diesel engine exhaust stream. This report describes the structures developed and characterizes the improved catalytic performance that can result. The results show that, relative to honeycomb monolith supports, considerable improvement in mass transfer efficiency is observed for robocast samples synthesized using an FCC-like geometry of alternating rods. Also, there is clearly a trade-off between enhanced mass transfer and increased pressure drop, which can be optimized depending on the particular demands of a given application. Practical applications include the combustion of natural gas for power generation, production of syngas, and hydrogen reforming reactions. The robocast lattice structures also show practicality for diesel <b>particulate</b> <b>trapping.</b> Preliminary results for trapping efficiency are reported as well as the development of electrically resistive lattices that can regenerate the structure by combusting the trapped soot. During this project an ancillary bio-medical application was discovered for lattices of hydroxyapatite. These structures show promise as bone scaffolds for the reparation of damaged bone.
