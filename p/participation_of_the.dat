5|$|Although the pharaoh {{delegated}} his authority, {{the performance}} of temple rituals was still an official duty, restricted to high-ranking priests. The <b>participation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> general populace in most ceremonies was prohibited. Much of the lay religious activity in Egypt instead took place in private and community shrines, separate from the official temples. As the primary link between the human and divine realms, temples attracted considerable veneration from ordinary Egyptians.|$|E

In Soviet historiography, the Battle of Grunwald was styled as a racial struggle between Slavs and Germanics. The Teutonic Knights were portrayed as the medieval forerunners of Hitler's armies, while the battle itself {{was seen as the}} medieval counterpart to the Battle of Stalingrad.|$|E

5|$|In 1992, Burger King and its franchises formed Restaurant Services Inc. (RSI), an {{independent}} purchasing cooperative, which covered 100 percent of BK {{stores in the}} United States.

The format of RSI was based on the system employed by KFC for its distribution system and was operated in a similar manner.

5|$|In Pune, {{where the}} {{construction}} industry was badly hit, some local organisations, working for porters, construction workers and casual labourers, {{tried to stop the}} exodus. These organisations set up a National Integration Committee (NIC) and charted out confidence-building measures among the migrants in the city. One of the resolutions passed at the meeting was to encourage <b>participation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> North Indians in all festivities in the near future. In fact, ninety percent of the labour force in Pune consists of migrants; 60percent of these come from Bihar and UP. It was also feared that the stoppage of construction activities would adversely affect the plans of hosting certain events of the 2008 Commonwealth Youth Games to be held in the city.|$|E

In practice, NATO formulates a common set of criteria, but for instance Greece blocks the Republic of Macedonia's accession to NATO, due to the disagreement over the use of the name Macedonia.

5|$|After resigning, Aqil left Galilee for Tell el-Hesi in {{the region}} of Gaza. Around this time, Aqil married off a {{daughter}} of his to the leading Bedouin sheikh of the area, Rabbah al-Wahaidi. Bedouin raiding, now with the <b>participation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> smaller tribes of Galilee, resumed not long after Aqil's resignation and concerns by the local merchants and European consuls were voiced to Kapuli Pasha due to the incoming harvest season for cotton and grain from Galilee and Hauran. Hasan Effendi sought to stem the tide of looting by attempting to play one Bedouin tribe off of the other. Kapuli Pasha was doubtful of this policy's effectiveness and strove to use military force instead. He personally led a contingent of troops in Galilee and ensured a peaceful harvest through the end of 1863. However, Kapuli Pasha determined that he could not keep a large, permanent military contingent in Galilee and decided to reinstate Aqil to his former position after lobbying from the British consul of Haifa.|$|E
5|$|By {{the fall}} of 1918, the Greeks, with over 300,000 soldiers, were the single largest {{component}} of the Allied army on the Macedonian front. The Greek army gave the much needed advantage to the Allies that altered the balance {{between the two sides}} on the Macedonian front. On 14 September 1918, under the command of French General Franchet d'Esperey, a combined Greek, Serbian, French and British force launched a major offensive against the Bulgarian and German army. After the first serious battle (see battle of Skra) the Bulgarian army gave up their defensive positions and began retreating towards their country. On 29 September, the armistice with Bulgaria was signed by the Allied command. The Allied army pushed north and defeated the remaining German and Austrian forces. By October 1918 the Allied armies had recaptured all of Serbia and were preparing to invade Hungary. The offensive was halted because the Hungarian leadership offered to surrender in November 1918, marking the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian empire. This ended the First World War since Germany lacked forces to stop the Allies from invading Germany from the south. The <b>participation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Greek army at the Macedonian front was one of the decisive event of the war, earning Greece a seat at the Paris Peace Conference under Venizelos.|$|E
