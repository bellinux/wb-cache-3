5|$|Pouring mercury onto a {{horizontal}} flat sheet of glass {{results in a}} <b>puddle</b> that has a perceptible thickness. The <b>puddle</b> will spread out only {{to the point where}} it is a little under half a centimetre thick, and no thinner. Again this is due to the action of mercury's strong surface tension. The liquid mass flattens out because that brings as much of the mercury to as low a level as possible, but the surface tension, at the same time, is acting to reduce the total surface area. The result of the compromise is a <b>puddle</b> of a nearly fixed thickness.|$|E

5|$|The {{trend of}} {{accelerating}} {{the speed at}} which welds are performed in the steel erection industry comes at a risk to the integrity of the connection. Without proper fusion to the base materials provided by sufficient arc time on the weld, a project inspector cannot ensure the effective diameter of the <b>puddle</b> weld therefore he or she cannot guarantee the published load capacities unless they witness the actual installation. This method of <b>puddle</b> welding is common in the United States and Canada for attaching steel sheets to bar joist and structural steel members. Regional agencies are responsible for ensuring the proper installation of <b>puddle</b> welding on steel construction sites. Currently there is no standard or weld procedure which can ensure the published holding capacity of any unwitnessed connection, but this is under review by the American Welding Society.|$|E
40|$|Drainage {{water quality}} in rice paddies was {{strongly}} influenced by the <b>puddling</b> of soil in the paddy fields by tractors {{and in response to}} opening of drainage gates. The concentrations of contaminants in drainage water increased rapidly when the <b>puddling</b> process began and were maintained at high concentrations throughout the <b>puddling</b> period. Moreover, the high concentrations did not decrease immediately after the <b>puddling</b> procedures ceased. Additionally, the ratio of dissolved nitrogen and phosphorous to total nitrogen and total phosphorous increased daily during {{the last half of the}} <b>puddling</b> period, due to discharge of chemical fertilizers with the drainage water. Also, the loads of particulate nitrogen and phosphorus discharged during the <b>puddling</b> period were larger than the loads discharge during irrigation. The discharge from paddy fields during <b>puddling</b> also increased the total annual contaminant load. Drainage water Load discharge <b>Puddling</b> and transplanting period...|$|R
40|$|<b>Puddling</b> is {{the most}} common method of land {{preparation}} for lowland rice cultivation. The {{purpose of this study was}} to assess the influence of various intensities of <b>puddling</b> on percolation rate, water retention by soil and the amount of water used for different <b>puddling</b> intensities in three dominant soil textures of paddy fields in Guilan province. Undisturbed soil samples were taken from 3 different soils including silty clay, clay loam and loam, with 3 replications. The soil samples were <b>puddled</b> by a laboratory apparatus with different intensities. The results showed that the low <b>puddling</b> intensity treatment caused a 29. 3, 32. 4 and 36 % reduction of percolation rate in silty clay, silty loam and loam textures, respectively. Increasing <b>puddling</b> intensity from low to medium reduced percolation rate significantly, but high intensity was not effective. Soil moisture characteristic curves of all three soils showed that water retention was increased by <b>puddling</b> treatments. Water retention in silty clay was higher than the other two soils. The high intensity treatment needed more water than low intensity for <b>puddling.</b> Increasing <b>puddling</b> intensity from medium intensity to high intensity caused 15. 4, 14. 1 and 16. 3 % increase in the amount of water required for <b>puddling</b> in silty clay, silty loam and loam textures, respectively. Generally, in all the three studied soil textures, the amount of water used for high-intensity <b>puddling</b> was more than medium-intensity <b>puddling,</b> while it had no significant effect on water percolation rate and soil water retention...|$|R

2500|$|The {{inexpensive}} {{process for}} making good quality wrought iron was <b>puddling,</b> which became widespread after 1800. [...] <b>Puddling</b> involved stirring molten cast iron until small globs sufficiently decarburized to form globs of hot wrought iron that were then removed and hammered into shapes. <b>Puddling</b> was extremely labor-intensive. <b>Puddling</b> was used until {{the introduction of}} the Bessemer and open hearth processes in the mid and late 19th century, respectively.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} <b>puddling</b> on percolation and rice yields in rainfed lowland paddy cultivation. We selected a study village in Khammouane province, central Laos, and set up non-puddling and <b>puddling</b> plots from high to low positions. Even when <b>puddling</b> was conducted carefully, the ponding water in the plots disappeared {{in the case of}} little rainfall. Further, percolatifons during the later periods of rice growth increased drastically. Therefore, it is difficult to overcome drought stresses only by conducting <b>puddling.</b> We also compared the water conditions in the non-puddling and <b>puddling</b> plots. In the <b>puddling</b> plots at high position and low position along a stream, the number of days without ponding water in the <b>puddling</b> plots was less than that in the non-puddling field in July, suggesting the possibility of a different transplanting date. We tried to estimate the effects of transplanting date on the rice yields and found that transplanting 15 days earlier leads to an increase of 0. 5 t/ha in the rice yields. Moreover, the profits from the increased yields exceed the <b>puddling</b> costs considerably, leading to a definite increase in income. Because the transplanting date has no effects in the fields with high ground water, <b>puddling</b> is effective in paddy fields where ponding does not occur to a significant degree. </p...|$|R

While the authorities have been blamed for poor planning by de-silting the lake, the drought situation has resulted in insignificant rainfall in the area to fill the lake.|$|E
5|$|Tapping felt {{acting on}} the new show went a little easier when filming Carter scenes with Bill Dow ("Bill Lee"), {{with whom she had}} {{previously}} worked on Stargate SG-1. She said another factor that made acting on Atlantis easier was the welcoming cast and crew of the series. Tapping's hair was longer than it was during her time on SG-1, and the military approved of the change {{as long as it was}} worn up. To save money on visual effects, the crew built set pieces to represent some of the buildings on M7R-227 and placed them in front of the <b>puddle</b> jumper set. Another measure taken as a substitute to visual effects was to cast mime artists as the frozen Asurans.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} soil <b>puddling</b> on soil {{physical}} properties of 3 different textured soils (clay, loam, and silty loam) {{and growth of}} rice (Oryza sativa) on these soils was investigated under glasshouse conditions. <b>Puddling</b> intensity was expressed as the ratio of soil volume subjected to the <b>puddling</b> implement and the total soil volume in the <b>puddled</b> layer, thus integrating the effects of speed and time of the <b>puddling</b> operation. This parameter was well related to soil dispersion, bulk density, and saturated hydraulic conductivity. However, following prolonged periods of submerged conditions during rice growth, saturated hydraulic conductivity decreased with a decrease in soil dispersion, in contrast to an expected reduction in saturated hydraulic conductivity with increased dispersion. There was indication that continuous waterlogging reduced the effect of soil <b>puddling,</b> in particular on heavy-textured soils...|$|R

The band was also scheduled to open a spring tour for Adema but was forced to withdraw due to scheduling conflicts.|$|E
5|$|The {{roads were}} just prairie trails which wound around bluffs, {{up and down}} hills. These roads were quite {{adequate}} for horses, but were a different story for cars; {{very few of the}} roads went on the square where the roads allowances were finally surveyed. When it rained there was always a mud <b>puddle</b> at the bottom of every hill and every car that went through made the ruts deeper and deeper until you were stuck. The coming of cars soon made a big difference. The prairie trails proved inadequate and road allowances were graded and built up; culverts had to be installed where the natural water runs were. The new graded roads were a big improvement but many a muddy mile was driven over the country roads. Gradually, some of the main highways would get some gravel and it was quite a pleasure to pull of a muddy country road on to a few miles of gravel—Les Moffatt.|$|E

5|$|Webber took {{provisional}} {{pole position}} in Friday qualifying of the , out-qualifying local driver Rubens Barrichello by 0.138 seconds during a rain-affected session. He continued his good {{performance in the}} Saturday session taking a career-best 3rd on the grid, Jaguar Racing's best qualifying performance in their four-year Formula One history. In the race, which was hit heavily by rain, Webber was in seventh place when he attempted to cool his tyres by driving through a <b>puddle</b> lying off-line in the final corner. The resultant lack of grip caused Webber to crash heavily into the pit straight walls, leaving debris on the track which caused a second major crash; Fernando Alonso hitting a stray tyre. The race was subsequently red-flagged, and although Webber was originally classified in 7th, an FIA investigation found a timekeeping error which meant that Webber was placed 9th in the re-classification.|$|E
5|$|Welders often {{develop a}} {{technique}} of rapidly alternating between moving the torch forward (to advance the weld pool) and adding filler metal. The filler rod is {{withdrawn from the}} weld pool each time the electrode advances, but it is always kept inside the gas shield to prevent oxidation of its surface and contamination of the weld. Filler rods composed of metals with a low melting temperature, such as aluminum, require that the operator maintain {{some distance from the}} arc while staying inside the gas shield. If held too close to the arc, the filler rod can melt before it makes contact with the weld <b>puddle.</b> As the weld nears completion, the arc current is often gradually reduced to allow the weld crater to solidify and prevent the formation of crater cracks {{at the end of the}} weld.|$|E

After much deliberation, {{it was decided to}} {{continue}} construction, and to obtain a third Act of Parliament to authorise increased charges for carriage of goods. By 1812, progress was being made, but was hampered by the need for rock cuttings at Holcombe Rogus. Leakage also meant that some sections needed to be lined with <b>puddle</b> clay. Lime kilns were constructed to provide the materials, which can still be seen beside the canal, close to the Waytown Tunnel. Fenacre Bridge and Fossend Bridge were constructed at Burlescombe, where culverts were also needed to manage the streams.
