50|$|The <b>painted</b> <b>goby</b> is a {{relatively}} small goby, only growing to 6 cm in length, although some may grow to 9.5 cm. It is fawn-brown, with a row of four double dark brown spots along the sides. The dorsal fin has rows of dark brown-black spots interspersed with bands of iridescent blue and pink.|$|E
50|$|The <b>painted</b> <b>goby</b> (Pomatoschistus pictus) {{is a small}} goby of Western European waters from Trondheim Fjord to Spain, the Canary Islands and is {{sometimes}} reported in the Mediterranean Sea. Also mentioned in the Black Sea. It lives at depths from 1 to 55 m, preferring a gravelly or sandy environment. Its young may sometimes be found in tide pools. It feeds on amphipods and copepods.|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} we tested the effect of {{continuous}} noise on courtship behaviour in two closely-related marine fishes: the two-spotted goby (Gobiusculus flavescens) and the <b>painted</b> <b>goby</b> (Pomatoschistus pictus) in aquarium experiments. Both species use visual and acoustic signals during courtship. In the two-spotted goby we used a repeated-measures design testing the same individuals in the noise and the control treatment, in alternating order. For the <b>painted</b> <b>goby</b> we allowed females to spawn, precluding a repeated-measures design, but permitting {{a test of the}} effect of noise on female spawning decisions. Males of both species reduced acoustic courtship, but only painted gobies also showed less visual courtship in the noise treatment compared to the control. Female painted gobies were less likely to spawn in the noise treatment. (N = Added noise treatment, S = silent control...|$|E
40|$|Many {{fish species}} emit sounds in agonistic contexts. During direct {{confrontations}} sounds are typically produced during the display phase {{in conjunction with}} visual exhibitions. Here we studied sound production during territorial defence in captive <b>painted</b> <b>gobies,</b> Pomatoschistus pictus, and related acoustic parameters with male traits and the date of recording (Julian day, i. e., with {{the approach of the}} peak of the breeding season). Territorial males emitted drumming sounds during displays that involved darkening the chin and fins, spreading fins and quivering the body. Drums were trains of low frequency pulses (≈ 23 pulses) repeated every 27 ms and usually lasting under a second. Drums were produced in short sequences of sounds (bursts). All acoustic parameters differed significantly among males. Drum and burst duration, and drum number of pulses increased significantly with male size. Calling duration (including drum, burst duration and drum number of pulses) also increased significantly with Julian date and presented a high intra-male variability, suggesting that these parameters may also depend on the individual’s motivation. We provide the first report for agonistic sound production in sand gobies and give evidence that sound parameters contain information that can be used during mutual assessment in contests over territories...|$|R

40|$|Acoustic signals can encode crucial {{information}} about species identity and individual quality. We recorded and compared male courtship drum {{sounds of the}} sand goby Pomatoschistus minutus and the <b>painted</b> <b>goby</b> P. pictus and examined if they can function in species recognition within sympatric populations. We also examined which acoustic features are related to male quality and the factors that affect female courtship in the sand goby, to determine whether vocalisations potentially {{play a role in}} mate assessment. Drums produced by the <b>painted</b> <b>goby</b> showed significantly higher dominant frequencies, higher sound pulse repetition rates and longer intervals between sounds than those of the sand goby. In the sand goby, male quality was predicted by visual and acoustic courtship signals. Regression analyses showed that sound amplitude was a good predictor of male length, whereas the duration of nest behaviour and active calling rate (i. e. excluding silent periods) were good predictors of male condition factor and fat reserves respectively. In addition, the level of female courtship was predicted by male nest behaviour. The results suggest that the frequency and temporal patterns of sounds can encode species identity, whereas sound amplitude and calling activity reflects male size and fat reserves. Visual courtship duration (nest-related behaviour) also seems relevant to mate choice, since it reflects male condition and is related to female courtship. Our work suggests that acoustic communication can contribute to mate choice in the sand goby group, an...|$|E
40|$|There are {{substantial}} concerns that increasing levels of anthropogenic {{noise in the}} oceans may impact aquatic animals. Noise can affect animals physically, physiologically and behaviourally, {{but one of the}} most obvious effects is interference with acoustic communication. Acoustic communication often plays a crucial role in reproductive interactions and over 800 species of fish have been found to communicate acoustically. There is very little data on whether noise affects reproduction in aquatic animals, and none in relation to acoustic communication. In this study we tested the effect of continuous noise on courtship behaviour in two closely-related marine fishes: the two-spotted goby (Gobiusculus flavescens) and the <b>painted</b> <b>goby</b> (Pomatoschistus pictus) in aquarium experiments. Both species use visual and acoustic signals during courtship. In the two-spotted goby we used a repeated-measures design testing the same individuals in the noise and the control treatment, in alternating order. For the <b>painted</b> <b>goby</b> we allowed females to spawn, precluding a repeated-measures design, but permitting a test of the effect of noise on female spawning decisions. Males of both species reduced acoustic courtship, but only painted gobies also showed less visual courtship in the noise treatment compared to the control. Female painted gobies were less likely to spawn in the noise treatment. Thus, our results provide experimental evidence for negative effects of noise on acoustic communication and spawning success. Spawning is a crucial component of reproduction. Therefore, even though laboratory results should not be extrapolated directly to field populations, our results suggest that reproductive success may be sensitive to noise pollution, potentially reducing fitness.

40|$|Gobies emit sounds during {{different}} stages of reproduction, including courtship, pre-spawning events (in the nest) and spawning. The breeding sounds of the <b>painted</b> <b>goby</b> Pomatoschistus pictus and associated courtship behaviour were recorded in captivity and described for the first time. Males emitted thump-like sounds mainly when displaying alone in the nest and produced drumming sounds outside the nest. Thumps have never been reported for other species of the genus Pomatoschistus. Thumps were short (~ 80 ms) very-low frequency (below 100 Hz) non-pulsed sounds, whereas drums were longer (hundreds of ms) and consisted of low frequency (~ 300 Hz) pulse trains. Thump characteristics varied significantly among males but also showed high within-male variability. The frequency of thump emissions and courtship behaviour (total number of courtship displays, lead and nest display) were positively correlated with male size but not with male somatic condition. Thump bursts emitted during nest displays were significantly longer than when emitted with other behaviours. These results suggest that larger males courted females more intensively, both with visual and acoustic displays, than smaller ones...|$|E
40|$|During {{a three-year}} field study, {{interspecific}} and interannual {{differences in the}} trophic ecology of littoral fish species were investigated in the rocky intertidal of Helgoland Island (North Sea). We investigated trophic niche partitioning of common coexisting littoral fish species based on a multi tracer approach using stable isotope and fatty acids {{in order to show}} differences and similarities in resource use and feeding modes. The results of the dual tracer approach showed clear trophic niche partitioning of the five target fish species, the goldsinny wrasse Ctenolabrus rupestris, the sand goby Pomatoschistus minutus, the <b>painted</b> <b>goby</b> Pomatoschistus pictus, the short-spined sea scorpion Myoxocephalus scorpius and the long-spined sea scorpion Taurulus bubalis. Both stable isotopes and fatty acids showed distinct differences in the trophic ecology of the studied fish species. However, the combined use of the two techniques added an additional resolution on the interannual scale. The sand goby P. minutus showed the largest trophic plasticity with a pronounced variability between years. The present data analysis provides valuable information on trophic niche partitioning of fish species in the littoral zones of Helgoland and on complex benthic food webs in general. ...|$|E

Fish larvae use a range of sensory cues, including sound, for locating settlement habitat. This study tested the effect of elevated CO 2 on the ability of settlement-stage temperate fish to use auditory cues from adult coastal reef habitats.

Fish reared in control pCO 2 conditions discriminated reef soundscapes and were attracted by reef recordings. This behaviour changed in fish reared in the high CO 2 conditions, with settlement-stage larvae strongly avoiding reef recordings. This study provides evidence that ocean acidification might affect the auditory responses of larval stages of temperate reef fish species, with potentially significant impacts on their survival...|$|E
40|$|Animals often vocalize during {{territorial}} {{challenges as}} acoustic signals may indicate motivation and fighting ability {{and contribute to}} reduce aggressive escalation. Here, we tested the function of agonistic sounds in territorial defence in the <b>painted</b> <b>goby.</b> Pomatoschistus pictus, a small vocal marine fish that defends nests during the breeding season. We first measured {{the number of times}} a male approached, avoided, explored, entered and exited two unattended nests associated with either conspecific agonistic sounds or a control: silence or white noise. Acoustic stimuli were played back when the male approached a nest. In a second experimental set, we added visual stimuli, consisting of a conspecific male in a small confinement aquarium near each nest. Even though we found no effect of the visual stimuli, the sound playbacks induced similar effects in both experimental conditions. In the sound vs. silence treatment, we found that when males approached a nest, the playback of conspecific sounds usually triggered avoidance. However, this behaviour did not last as in longer periods males visited nests associated with agonistic sounds more often than silent ones. When the control was white noise, we found no significant effect of the playback treatment in male behaviour. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that other sounds may dissuade nest occupation, our results suggest that agonistic sounds act as territorial intrusion deterrents but are insufficient to prevent nest intrusion on their own. Further studies are needed to test the significance of sound production rate, spectral content and temporal patterns to deter territorial intrusion in fish...|$|E
40|$|The <b>painted</b> <b>goby</b> Pomatoschistus pictus emits {{courtship}} sounds (drums) {{that are}} important in reproductive outcome. The effect of temperature (14 – 22 °C) on courtship drum features was characterised. Pulse period (or rate) was linearly related with temperature (R 2 = 0. 83) presenting a Q 10 of 2. 13. Pulse period decreased by 1. 95 ms per 1 °C and varied from 34 ms to 18. 6 ms within the studied temperature range. Sound duration changed concomitantly from 1128 ms to 658 ms. Changes in sound duration were due to pulse period rather than pulse number, since the latter was not affected by temperature. Pulse duration was similarly affected by temperature, decreasing by 0. 3 ms per 1 °C (R 2 = 0. 51, Q 10 = 1. 45) and changing from 10. 0 ms at 14 °C to 7. 5 ms at 22 °C. Drum emission rate, sound amplitude, fatigue and dominant frequency were also not related to temperature. The temperature effect on pulse rate likely reflects temperature-dependence of the vocal central pattern generator as observed in other animals. In contrast, shorter pulse durations likely result from temperature effects at the peripheral level of the vocal system, as muscle twitches typically shorten with rising temperatures. Because pulse rate is likely important in mate choice and conspecific recognition in fish, including P. pictus, future studies are needed to understand if temperature-related changes in pulse rate are coupled with changes in mate preference as found in insects and anurans.
