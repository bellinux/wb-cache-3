40|$|This paper details a {{modeling}} and experimental {{assessment of the}} packaging process for a silicon carbide Schottky diode using pressure contacts. The work detailed in this paper is original, as it applies a combined electrothermomechanical modeling analysis to this packaging method supported by experimental validation. A key design objective for this packaging process is to identify suitable contact pad materials, heatsinks, and process variables such as clamping force to meet electrical, thermal, and reliability specifications. Molybdenum and aluminum graphite (ALG) {{have been identified as}} two suitable materials for the contact pads. Clamping forces ranging from 300 to 500 N and electric current ranging from 10 to 30 A have been investigated in terms of the resulting electrical and thermal contact resistances, temperatures, and stresses induced across the package. The performance of two heatsink designs with heat dissipation rates of 12893 and 4991 W/m 2 k has also been investigated. Both the {{modeling and}} initial experimental results detailed in this paper show that ALG provides better performance in terms of generating a lower average chip temperature. Both temperature and stress in the diode are predicted as a function of clamping force and load current. This will aid the <b>packaging</b> <b>engineer</b> to identify suitable process parameters to meet junction temperature requirements at different applied load currents. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{demonstrate}} how the tool of re-engineering can successfully be used to dissect competitive packaging and, in turn, stimulate new, innovative packaging developments. The organizational challenges and hurdles in achieving innovation have changed in recent years. Mergers and acquisitions {{have resulted in the}} creation of mega-corporations. The result has been a change in business philosophy from generalization to specialization for maximum profitability. The challenge of specialization is that it stifles creativity, and this includes the development of innovative packaging. One of the ways the <b>packaging</b> <b>engineer</b> can overcome these challenges and drive innovation is through the re-engineering of competitive packages. The key to successful re-engineering is the complete dissection of competitive packaging in order to define its characteristics and ultimately improve on the concept. It is through this improvement of design, form, or function that innovation is achieved. The use of re-engineering can save organizations time and money as it dramatically shortens the development process. The ability to develop and execute innovation is key to the long-term health of corporations. This thesis will review two successful applications of the re-engineering tool in developing innovative packaging. Both projects, Halloween 2000 and Major League Baseball 2001, involved packages that were developed and executed at Kraft Foods, Inc. in the Post cereals division. In both cases, the problem presented to the R 2 ̆ 6 D team was to quickly develop new promotional packaging that provided added consumer value. The first step was to conduct a competitive scan of the marketplace to identify potential packaging concepts. These packages were then dissected and analyzed, and a process to improve on the design to meet the project needs was developed. A patent search was conducted to ensure the new packages would not infringe on existing patents. The result was two of the most successful promotional programs in a dramatically compressed development time line. The Post organization was able to gain competitive market share during these promotional periods, and the packaging innovation proved to be a key driver in this success. The researcher suggests that the use of the re-engineering as stimuli for innovation is a proven and powerful tool for packaging development...|$|E
