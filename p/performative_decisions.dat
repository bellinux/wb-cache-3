Interplay between the resultant unpredictabilities and <b>performative</b> <b>decisions</b> required by complex multi-layered and paradoxical strands of information embedded in notational practice {{can lead to a}} frustration for the player, or to a fascination born of engagement in the act of [...] "what it is to make music". The latter is a key aspect for the members of ELISION; a further is the physicality of performance, the intimate connection between the musician and the instrument.|$|E
40|$|CD Recording of my {{complete}} piano {{music to}} date CD recording of my complete piano music {{performed by the}} internationally renowned pianist Nicolas Hodges. Works included: Pas au-dela, Genoi Hoios Essi, Monk, Beuys, écart-arc-trace, Eidos Label: Coviello Classics COV 60809 The CD was selected as CD of the month by the Sunday Times CD review. This CD recording covers my entire output of works for solo piano illustrating important aspects of my research into notation in relation to form and structure further exploring the relationships obtaining between notation and interpretation seen as form building elements. The earliest work on the CD, Genoi Hoios Essi, is a formative work which explores the interaction between rigorous pre-compositional processes and the resulting surface material, which often demands complex notational strategies, leading to certain <b>performative</b> <b>decisions.</b> Pas au-delà is a technical re-working {{of some of the}} formal strategies, though not the materials themselves, used Genoi Hoios Essi. The title also refers back to the earlier work. Genoi Hoios Essi was one of the phrases considered by Nietzsche as a possible title for his auto-critique Ecce Homo. Pas au-delà is a phrase derived from Derrida's critical re-examination of Ecce Homo, Otobiographies. In a similar way the music might be seen as a critical 'deconstructive' reading of the earlier work. Eidos and Beuys are both very short works, which were commissioned as such, and aim to present the performer with interpretative decisions, which are directly informed by the learning process. Beuys, in particular combines layered groups of grace-notes, arpeggiated chords, and large leaps over the keyboard, which are arguably impossible. However, the player is required to find practical solutions to these challenges, with a view to accessing a gestural world beyond the notated material. The three short works trace-arc-écart, were commissioned by the ABRSM for their series of books Spectrum. The brief was to write works for amateur pianists without compromising the musical language. Given the complex and at times extreme technical demands of my music, it was a significant challenge to find a distillation of the music and compositional processes, which nevertheless captured something of the essence of this process. The two outer movements are interchangeable, as their titles might suggest, but arc must always be in the middle...|$|E
40|$|The {{identification}} of courts as “open” and “public” institutions is commonplace in national and transnational conventions. But even as those attributes are taken for granted, {{the privatization of}} adjudication is underway. This paper explores how - {{during the last few}} centuries - public procedures came {{to be one of the}} attributes defining certain decision-making institutions as “courts. ” The political and theoretical predicates for such practices can be found in the work of Jeremy Bentham, a major proponent of what he termed “publicity,” a practice he commended for various entities from the Panopticon for prisoners to the Parliament and courts for legislators and judges. Bentham argued the utility of publicity in enhancing accuracy, public education, and judicial discipline. Moving forward in time, I examine various contemporary techniques in several jurisdictions that shift the processes of adjudication toward privatization. Included are the devolving adjudication to less-public government entities such as administrative agencies; outsourcing to private providers; and reconfiguring the processes of courts to render them more oriented toward settlement. For those appreciative of the role courts play in developing and protecting human rights, these new practices are problematic because adjudication can itself be a site offering opportunities to engage in democratic practices. The odd etiquette entailed in public adjudication under democratic legal regimes imposes obligations on government anddisputants to treat each other - before an observant and often times critical public - as equals. Public and private power can be constrained by such <b>performative</b> requirements. When <b>decision</b> making takes place in public, the application of law to fact can engender normative contestation predicated on popular input. This claim of public adjudication’s democratic potential and utilities is, however, not an argument that the judgments provided and the norms developed will necessarily advance a shared view of thepublic welfare. Hence, while eager to re-engage Bentham, I offer different claims for publicity and less optimism about its consequences...|$|R
