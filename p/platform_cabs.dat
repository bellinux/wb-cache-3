50|$|The Vivaro is {{available}} in panel van, minibus, combined bus/van, and <b>platform</b> crew <b>cab</b> configurations. Two different wheelbase styles, and two roof height options are also available, as well as three diesel engine power options and a petrol engine.|$|R
50|$|As an {{alternative}} to the tube, buses have connected the various terminals and inter-termini links became briefly popular in the 1920s and 1930s. All stations except Fenchurch Street have provided taxi services since opening. These originally had dedicated access roads to the station <b>platforms</b> when <b>cabs</b> were horse-drawn, while later purpose-built roads were built for road traffic.|$|R
5000|$|The 4300 and 4400 {{are also}} {{available}} in Lo-Profile configurations, with a lower <b>platform</b> for easier <b>cab</b> and loadbed access. They differ in axle capacity as follows: ...|$|R
25|$|The {{cab roof}} is {{reinforced}} {{to take the}} weight of two personnel and has a roof hatch and provision for a machine gun installation over an observer's <b>platform</b> inside the <b>cab.</b> For maintenance the cab can be hydraulically tilted forward 50°.|$|R
50|$|Up until 1910, {{the only}} trams {{delivered}} to the Vienna tramway network were vehicles with unglazed <b>platforms</b> (or <b>cabs),</b> i.e.: without any windscreens protecting occupants from the cold and wind. This {{was still in the}} tradition of the horse cars, on which direct contact of the driver with the harnessed horses was required. (It took until 1930 until the <b>cabs</b> and <b>platforms</b> of all tramcars had protective glass.) In 1911, the first double stops were introduced.|$|R
50|$|The Dyna and its twin Toyoace and Dutro {{were built}} on the U300 <b>platform</b> for Standard <b>Cab,</b> or U400 <b>platform</b> for the Wide Cab. The Dyna Route Van/Dutro Van are {{essentially}} standard Toyota HiAce van bodies mated with the Dyna/Dutro truck chassis.|$|R
50|$|This {{locomotive}} {{is equipped}} with a turbocharged EMD 12-710G3A, a 12-cylinder, two-stroke Diesel engine (prime mover), front and rear <b>platforms,</b> a full-width <b>cab</b> with a three-piece windshield. Earlier EMD cowl-type locomotives had used a two-piece windshield, while the Canadian comfort cab used a four-piece design.|$|R
5|$|The LC station {{began to}} be reconstructed in the late 19th century after several {{properties}} on Buckingham Palace Road, and the hotel, were bought by the company. Work began in 1899 with {{the removal of the}} old roof. The rebuilt station was partially opened on 10 June 1906, with additional <b>platforms</b> and <b>cab</b> exit on 10 February the following year, along with a new annexe to the hotel. It was formally re-opened on 1 July 1908. As a consequence of the rebuilding, boat trains become more popular from Victoria compared to Charing Cross and Cannon Street. Services increased to serve Ostend and Calais via Dover and Rotterdam via Gravesend. The LB part of the station also served Dieppe via Newhaven.|$|R
40|$|Capstone Design and Manufacturing Experience: Fall 2006 The goal of {{this project}} is to reduce or {{eliminate}} simulator users from experiencing motion sickness. This will be accomplished by designing and constructing a motion base platform and developing as well as testing the software that controls {{the motion of the}} platform based on vehicle data provided by the car simulator. The seat motion platform can serve as the foundation design for the entire <b>cab</b> <b>platform</b> in the future...|$|R
5000|$|A centre-control driving {{position}} in a shallow lightly armoured body provided with ammunition lockers and sheltered under an overall canvas tilt resulted in a vehicle not instantly recognisable as truck. (Prototypes used a box body {{in place of the}} simple <b>platform</b> and conventional <b>cab).</b> Early models were powered by twin coupled Bedford engines but the final design was powered by a powerful Leyland 9.8 litre engine. Length was 20 feet (6 metres), height 7ft 6 inches (2.3 metres) high.|$|R
50|$|The Hino Dutro (日野デュトロ) {{is a light}} {{commercial}} truck shared with the Toyota Dyna, manufactured by Hino Motors. Like the Dyna and its twin Toyoace, the Dutro is built on the U300 <b>platform</b> for standard <b>cab,</b> or U400 <b>platform</b> for the wide cab and offered in many different chassis type suitable for different purposes. The Dutro took over from the earlier Ranger 2 (and Ranger 3), a badge-engineered version of Daihatsu's Delta series. Outside of Japan, it {{is also known as}} the '300 series'.|$|R
50|$|When Class 15A {{locomotives}} were reboilered with Watson Standard no. 2A boilers, {{they were}} therefore reclassified to Class 15AR. Early conversions were equipped with copper and later conversions with steel fireboxes. In the process, {{they were also}} equipped with Watson cabs with their distinctive slanted fronts, compared to the conventional vertical fronts of their original cabs, while the <b>cab</b> <b>platform</b> was extended over {{the front end of}} the tender underframe. Many of the reboilered engines were later fitted with Type MR or Type MT tenders.|$|R
500|$|The {{main station}} between Bishop's Bridge Road and Praed Street was {{designed}} by Brunel, who was enthusiastic {{at the idea of}} being able to design a railway station himself, although much of the architectural detailing was by his associate Matthew Digby Wyatt. [...] He took inspiration from Joseph Paxton's Crystal Palace and the München Hauptbahnhof. The glazed roof is supported by wrought iron arches in three spans, respectively spanning , [...] and [...] The roof is [...] long, and the original roof spans had two transepts connecting the three spans. It is commonly believed that these were provided by Brunel to accommodate traversers to carry coaches between the tracks within the station. However recent research, using early documents and photographs, does not seem to support this belief, and their actual purpose is unknown. The original station used four platforms, a -wide and -wide departure platform, [...] a [...] arrival platform, and a [...] combined arrival <b>platform</b> and <b>cab</b> road. A series of nineteen turnplates were sited beyond the ends of the platforms for horse and coach traffic.|$|R
50|$|The {{main station}} between Bishops Bridge Road and Praed Street was {{designed}} by Brunel, who was enthusiastic {{at the idea of}} being able to design a railway station himself, although much of the architectural detailing was by his associate Matthew Digby Wyatt. He took inspiration from Joseph Paxton's Crystal Palace and the München Hauptbahnhof. The glazed roof is supported by wrought iron arches in three spans, respectively spanning 68 ft, 102 ft and 70 ft. The roof is 699 ft long, and the original roof spans had two transepts connecting the three spans. It is commonly believed that these were provided by Brunel to accommodate traversers to carry coaches between the tracks within the station. However recent research, using early documents and photographs, does not seem to support this belief, and their actual purpose is unknown. The original station used four platforms, a 27 ft-wide and 24 ft-wide departure platform, a 21 ft arrival platform, and a 47 ft combined arrival <b>platform</b> and <b>cab</b> road. A series of nineteen turnplates were sited beyond the ends of the platforms for horse and coach traffic.|$|R
5000|$|When {{the power}} change was {{eliminated}} at New Haven, this cumbersome splitting and re-combination procedure was abandoned {{in favor of}} a dedicated shuttle train that would meet each through train at the same <b>platform.</b> Former Metroliner <b>cab</b> cars were obtained {{from other parts of the}} system, and the Shuttles began to operate in push-pull format, eliminating the need to wye or loop the trainsets at New Haven and Springfield. The new Amtrak president, David L. Gunn then re-launched the Springfield Shuttle service with increased number of round trips and much-lower [...] "commuter" [...] level fares, turning the shuttle into a service in its own right, instead of just a connection for through travelers along the Northeast Corridor.|$|R
50|$|The Leyland 4-tonne {{truck is}} {{conventional}} in layout and design, {{is based on}} a standard C-section chassis and some key components used are shared with the commercial 45 Series light truck. The truck uses the sleeper cab version of the C44 forward control cab, this having room for the driver, two passengers, and stowage for their full kit. As an alternative, the space provided may be used for driver training (the driver plus four personnel) or radio communications equipment. The cab roof is reinforced to take the weight of two personnel and has a roof hatch and provision for a machine gun installation over an observer's <b>platform</b> inside the <b>cab.</b> For maintenance the cab can be hydraulically tilted forward 50°.|$|R
60|$|When {{the train}} stopped {{at what is}} called the London Bridge station, the {{passengers}} all stepped out of their respective cars upon the platform. In the English cars the doors are at the sides, and not, as in America, at the ends; so that the passengers get out nearly all at once, and the platform becomes immediately crowded. Beyond the platform, on the other side, there is usually, when a train comes in, a long row of cabs and carriages drawn up, ready to take the passengers from the several cars; so that the traveller has generally nothing to do but to step across the platform from the car that he came in to the cab that is waiting there to receive him. Nor is there, as is usual in America, any difficulty or delay in regard to the baggage; for each man's trunks are placed on the car that he rides in, directly over his head; so that, while he walks across the <b>platform</b> to the <b>cab,</b> the railway porter takes his trunk across and places it {{on the top of the}} cab; and thus he is off from the station in his cab within two minutes sometimes after he arrived at it in the car.|$|R
