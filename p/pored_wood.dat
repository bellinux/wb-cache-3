30|$|The {{method of}} solving the {{eigenvalue}} problem for photonic crystals has been studied primarily to find the photonic band gap [34], which is the frequency range where electromagnetic waves are extraordinarily absorbed by photonic crystals. Fujimura [35] reported on the dielectric anisotropy of a two-dimensional (2 D) photonic crystal whose structure is periodic in two axes. Since this structure is quite similar to the porous structure of wood [36 – 40], the above-mentioned solution method should be useful for evaluating the <b>pore</b> conformation of <b>wood.</b>|$|R
30|$|To date, {{numerous}} {{researchers have}} studied the cause of dielectric anisotropy in wood [11 – 27]. For example, Norimoto and Yamada [20] regarded wood as a mixture of <b>pores</b> and <b>wood</b> substance, and proposed that its dielectric anisotropy {{is caused by the}} alignment of pores and/or the dielectric anisotropy of wood substance. Tanaka et al. [23] reported that the dielectric anisotropy of oven- and air-dry wood was primarily caused by the pore alignment and depended on density for a millimeter wave of 0.1  THz. Inagaki et al. [11] and Todoruk et al. [24, 25] stated that pore alignment was the major cause of dielectric anisotropy in the frequency range of 0.1 – 0.6  THz. However, the dielectric mixture models they used [28 – 33] cannot explain the relationship of the conformation of pores to the dielectric anisotropy, so alternative theoretical approaches have been sought.|$|R

The vehicle often may be water, alcohol, a petroleum distillate, or a finishing agent such as shellac, lacquer, varnish and polyurethane.

30|$|The {{use of an}} {{effective}} medium theory is important when accurately measuring wood density using millimeter and terahertz wave techniques. To confirm the applicability of this theory to the evaluation of wood density, the relative permittivity and dielectric loss of oven-dry flat-sawn specimens of 11 different wood species were measured in a frequency range of 0.15 – 1.2  THz using a transmission measurement system for terahertz time-domain spectroscopy. A mixture model based on the effective medium theory well explained the density dependence of relative permittivity over the entire frequency range, while it did not fully explain that of dielectric loss, especially for higher frequencies. This indicates that wood scatters the terahertz wave with a wavelength close to the transverse sectional dimensions of the <b>pores</b> in <b>wood</b> {{in the same way}} as Mie scattering. It was found from the dielectric loss spectrum of wood substance that the frequency around 0.23  THz was preferable for the nondestructive evaluation of wood.|$|R
30|$|It can be {{observed}} that the total porosity was {{greater than that of}} theoretical porosity for all samples, respectively. The total porosity and MPS of compreg with the density of 0.60  g/cm 3 were larger than those of 0.90 and 1.22  g/cm 3. This indicated that the 0.60  g/cm 3 sample had more valid pores compared to other two compregs, as shown in Table  3. The lower porosity confirmed that the cell cavity volume was already compressed and cells became more closely. The densification resulted in a significant decrease in the pore volumes. It is notable to mention that the SD value of MPS for 0.60  g/cm 3 compreg is extremely high. The <b>pores</b> between <b>wood</b> cells at this level of density maintain big sizes. Furthermore, the differences of the pore size between different wood cells are great. This resulted to the large standard deviation. Table  3 showed that the SD of MPS decreased with the increasing density of compregs.|$|R
30|$|In {{our other}} paper, which was {{submitted}} to the Journal of Wood Science and is currently under review, the effect of <b>pores</b> on <b>wood</b> dielectric anisotropy was examined {{with the assumption that}} the effective medium theory is applicable to the relative permittivity of oven-dry wood obtained by terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) at 0.15  THz. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to examine the applicability of the effective medium theory to the density evaluation of wood over a frequency range of 0.15 – 1.2  THz. The complex permittivity along the longitudinal axis of flat-sawn oven-dry specimens of 11 different wood species was measured using a THz-TDS transmission measurement system. The fitness of a mixture model based on the effective medium theory to the measured relative permittivity and dielectric loss was examined, and the relationships of the averages and standard deviations of the dielectric parameters of wood substance to the frequency were also examined.|$|R

30|$|Because shale {{has both}} mineral (water-wetting) and organic (kerogen; water-repelling) pores, a fluid-based {{approach}} such as spontaneous imbibition and diffusion {{are expected to}} give lower accessible porosity profiles than will pressure-injected Wood’s metal, which accesses both the water-wet and oil-wet <b>pores.</b> But despite <b>Wood’s</b> metal accessing both kinds of pores, it consistently shows the steep decline in accessible porosity with distance that is characteristic of low pore connectivity. All results converge into findings that pores {{more than a few}} mm inside a sample are unlikely to be connected to the exterior, with additional implications of molecular size effects, as shown from our tracers of different sizes. In terms of hydrocarbon production, matrix pores more than a few mm from an induced fracture are only sparsely connected to fracture network and the producing borehole.|$|R
30|$|To {{clarify the}} effect of pore {{conformation}} on the wood dielectric anisotropy, the relative permittivity of flat-sawn specimens of 12 wood species along their longitudinal and tangential axes was measured using the transmission measurement system for THz-TDS at a frequency of 0.15  THz. The relative permittivity was also calculated by solving eigenvalue problems for two-dimensional photonic crystals composed of <b>wood</b> substance and <b>pores</b> with the ratio of tangential to radial widths, r. The measured relative permittivity along the longitudinal axis showed a linear relation to wood density, and the relative permittivity of wood substance, ε′WS, {{was estimated to be}} 3.45 by fitting the line based on a rule of mixture. The dielectric anisotropy, which is the ratio of relative permittivity along the longitudinal axis to that along the tangential axis, was well explained by the calculated permittivity with the values of ε′WS =  3.45 and r =  1 / 2, 1, 2, and 8. It was concluded that the ratio of the tangential to radial widths of <b>pores</b> in <b>wood</b> affects its relative permittivity along the tangential axis, and that the dielectric anisotropy decreased with an increase in the ratio. The relative permittivity calculated in this study can be applied to that in the frequency range below 0.15 THz if the effective medium approximation is valid. These findings show a promising new method for evaluating the porous structure of wood.|$|R
