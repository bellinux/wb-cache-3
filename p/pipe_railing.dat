500|$|The {{walls of}} the tower are {{constructed}} of sandstone blocks, brought by ship as ballast from Sydney, dressed outside and inside, and painted white. The walls' thickness varies from [...] at the bottom, in a concave slope to [...] at the top. The tower walls are carried up above the lantern floor to support the metal framework for the lantern. The gallery is surrounded by the 1932 gas <b>pipe</b> <b>railing.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{sandstone}} footbridge {{carries a}} sidewalk across the ravine described above. It has a center arch opening and an iron <b>pipe</b> <b>railing.</b> Construction date is unknown.|$|E
50|$|Internally the {{building}} has concrete floors, painted brick walls and steel beams to the roof, with metal covers to the panels of louvres and pink glass inserts to {{the centre of the}} sash windows. The east end of the space has a raised floor accessed via a steep metal stair with a more recent steel <b>pipe</b> <b>railing.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{courthouse}} {{is located}} {{adjacent to the}} Santa Fe Post Office in Federal Plaza. The plaza is enclosed by a stone wall with metal <b>pipe</b> <b>railings</b> that follows {{the outline of the}} 1883 racetrack.|$|R
50|$|The next bridge {{opened in}} early 1902. It had {{concrete}} balustrade railings which were {{lost to the}} 1913 flood and replaced with <b>pipe</b> <b>railings.</b> The fourth bridge was deemed unsafe in 1979. After demolition {{it was found that}} only one of the three segments needed actual replacement, the other spans would have needed only surface repairs.|$|R
5000|$|Galvanised <b>pipe</b> <b>railings</b> {{were placed}} as needed and where {{necessary}} banks were retained {{with a variety}} of materials, predominantly small concrete slabs. Garden beds and path edges were built up and retained with flat and smooth river stones. A variety of materials were used for paving in this area: bricks, broken concrete slabs set into the path, and concrete [...] "crazy paving". Walking areas such as footbridges and steps were rendered [...] "non-slip" [...] with the application of exposed aggregate concrete.|$|R
50|$|The {{walls of}} the tower are {{constructed}} of sandstone blocks, brought by ship as ballast from Sydney, dressed outside and inside, and painted white. The walls' thickness varies from 2 m at the bottom, in a concave slope to 0.6 m at the top. The tower walls are carried up above the lantern floor to support the metal framework for the lantern. The gallery is surrounded by the 1932 gas <b>pipe</b> <b>railing.</b>|$|E
50|$|Negotiations for the school's {{construction}} {{began in}} 1911 with {{the appointment of}} a four-man building committee: Dr. John F. Jordan, James J. Sheehan, Henry W. Shaw and T.W. Reilly. The city acquired the property where the school sits from Augusta B. Trask and Eliza E. Manning. The contractor for the project, John D. Jeffers of Peabody, submitted the lowest bid of $29,135.80. Ground was broken for the school in May 1911 and work on the building commenced the following month. The building was situated 150 feet from Lynn Street and surrounded by a <b>pipe</b> <b>railing.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{swimming}} pool is located {{east of the}} main residence and overlooks the creek from the high bank along its southern side. It is of concrete construction {{with a set of}} stairs in the north-west corner at its deep end. A concrete platform reached by a set of stairs is enclosed on three sides at the northern end by a wall comprising concrete posts and balustrade and <b>pipe</b> <b>railing.</b> Another concrete platform is located at the southern end adjacent to a steel framed shade structure with metal roof in the south-east corner. The pool is currently disused.|$|E
50|$|Located roughly at Fisher Avenue and Arthur Kill Road on {{the main}} line, it is at grade level with side {{platforms}} approximately 80 ft long that can hold only one car. Former operations before the station closed only had the last car stop at the platform. Access to the northbound platform is via the short dead-end Tracy Avenue off of Arthur Kill Road between Fisher and Wood Avenues, while the southbound platform is reached from an entrance on Ellis Street. An overpass links both platforms. The overpass is still accessible, but the stairways leading down to the platform are walled off. One can see the original, pre-1990s SIRT station components on this line—steel corrugated walls, overpasses and original 4 ft-high station <b>pipe</b> <b>railings</b> with faded signs.|$|R
5000|$|To theatergoers, last year's Nicholas Nickleby and its set formed of catwalks, ramps and {{scaffolding}} {{are now a}} memory. But at West Park Presbyterian Church, on West 86th Street near Amsterdam Avenue, [...] "Nickleby" [...] lives. The Riverside Shakespeare Company, {{based at}} the church, will be starting its sixth season with a new stage built from the Royal Shakespeare Company's Nickleby set - which was donated complete, {{right down to the}} ropes and <b>pipes.</b> <b>Railings</b> from the demolished Helen Hayes Theater were also used in the renovation. Miss Helen Hayes and Joseph Papp spoke at a dedication this week. Mr. Papp's $5,000 gift to the Riverside Shakespeare's production fund was matched last year at a benefit done by three Nickleby cast members including Roger Rees, of the title role, who later joined the Riverside's board.|$|R
5000|$|As {{he would}} do in later film productions, Antonioni {{went to great lengths}} in {{reaching}} this goal, such as having trees and grass painted white or grey to fit his take on an urban landscape. Andrew Sarris called the red hued <b>pipes</b> and <b>railings</b> [...] "the architecture of anxiety: the reds and blues exclaim as much as they explain".|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} sits on {{the high}} ground of a large, mostly grassed terraced block, with several mature eucalypts on the lower ground near Lower Clifton Terrace, a small front garden adjacent to Upper Clifton Terrace, and some perimeter planting along {{the south side of}} the block. The Upper Clifton Terrace frontage has a late 20th century brick fence with an extruded <b>pipe</b> <b>railing,</b> and there is a small steel-framed and steel-roofed carport in the front yard, to the southwest of the convent building. Immediately behind the building are the brick and concrete foundations of a small outbuilding, demolished fairly recently. The terracing follows the steep slope of the land down the hill, at the rear of the building. One set of concrete terrace steps survives, but three other early sets of steps between the terraces have been removed.|$|E
5000|$|Each of {{the five}} locks in the canal is about 144 long by 36 feet wide, with walls of {{limestone}} block and timber gates. The gates are opened and closed by a hand-crank, gear, and spar. The locks are flooded by gear-operated butterfly valves at the upstream end and emptied by butterfly valves at the downstream end. Each lock lifts a boat about 10 feet, can fill in about four minutes, and empties in about three minutes. Lock 1 was rebuilt in 1882, lock 2 in 1903, locks 3 and 4 in 1876-78. Lock 5 {{is similar to the}} others except that its walls are rubblestone and wooden planking instead of cut limestone blocks - still the original construction method from the 1850s, though it has been maintained since. Each lock is circled by a <b>pipe</b> <b>railing,</b> and has a lock shack built in 1917.|$|E
5000|$|These towers {{were built}} to a {{standard}} design and made of precast concrete sections and referred to by the abbreviations [...] "BT 4x4", [...] "BT 9" [...] or [...] "BT 11" [...] - the older Type 11 was cylindrical; the later Type 9 had a square floor plan, as did the Type 4x4. These numbers referred either to {{the height of the}} tower (e.g. 9 or 11 metres) or its floor plan (e.g. 4 x 4 metres). They varied in height depending on local circumstances and were accessed through a steel door that was usually hidden {{from the direction of the}} border. Offset metal ladders led via two or three intermediate corrugated steel floors to the top. The main observation deck was equipped with seating, rifle racks, an air filter system, signaling equipment, log book, mapping material, dedicated communications to the border reporting net, electric heating and emergency and rescue equipment including abseiling kit. It had room for 4-5 soldiers who, usually, formed the [...] "Warning Group" [...] (Alarmgruppe). The roof terrace was protected by a steel <b>pipe</b> <b>railing</b> and could be accessed through a lockable, airtight steel hatch. On the roof was a movable, remotely operated searchlight (elevation -/+ 90 degrees, azimuth 360 degrees).|$|E
50|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{survey of}} {{the wreck of the}} Lake Illawarra was completed by 13 January. The divers operated in hazardous conditions, with little visibility and strong river currents, contending with bridge debris such as shattered concrete, reinforced steel rods, <b>railings,</b> <b>pipes,</b> lights, wire and power cables. Strong winds on the third day brought down debris from the bridge above, including power cables, endangering the divers working below.|$|R
50|$|The Cyprus was {{discovered}} {{lying on her}} port side in about 460 feet of water. Her hull is totally intact, which is surprising considering the rather violent manner in which she foundered. Wreckage consisting of wall panelings, doors, <b>railings,</b> <b>pipes,</b> and her cargo of iron ore are scattered about the bottom up to 270 {{feet away from the}} wreck. Her name and port of call remains completely legible on her stern.|$|R
50|$|Some of the Character-defining {{elements}} of St. Andrew's / Highland Arts Theatre relate to its Gothic Revival style and include its buttressed belfry towers of differing heights, the arched windows, dentil moulding and cornice on the belfry towers, the three-over-three arched windows in upper belfry of taller tower, the three arched windows in upper belfry of lower tower, the wide entry staircase {{leading to the}} three arched entries containing two wooden doors each, a large Palladian derivative window above entry. Other character-defining elements are its construction of locally made brick, all original interior elements including: Casavant Frères <b>pipe</b> organ, <b>railings,</b> columns, trim and barrel vaulted ceiling arcing 44 ft above the theatre floor; ten bells, inscribed with Biblical verses in bell tower.|$|R
60|$|Then Costello {{went out}} himself, and after {{listening}} to many excuses and in many places, brought in a big half-witted fellow, who followed him like a dog, a farm-labourer who worshipped him for his strength, a fat farmer whose forefathers had served his family, {{and a couple of}} lads who looked after his goats and cows; and marshalled them before the fire in the empty hall. They had brought with them their stout cudgels, and Costello gave them an old pistol apiece, and kept them all night drinking Spanish ale and shooting at a white turnip which he pinned against the wall with a skewer. Duallach of the pipes sat on the bench in the chimney playing 'The Green Bunch of Rushes', 'The Unchion Stream,' and 'The Princes of Breffeny' on his old <b>pipes,</b> and <b>railing</b> now at the appearance of the shooters, now at their clumsy shooting, and now at Costello because he had no better servants. The labourer, the half-witted fellow, the farmer and the lads were all well accustomed to Duallach's railing, for it was as inseparable from wake or wedding as the squealing of his pipes, but they wondered at the forbearance of Costello, who seldom came either to wake or wedding, and if he had would scarce have been patient with a scolding piper.|$|R
50|$|The market {{played a}} key role in the city life and {{influenced}} also its appearance. From the beginning of the 19th century the city had rich private residences and social buildings. The commercial Taganrog became one of the largest industrial cities of the Russian South. By the end of the 19th century grew the number of educational institutions. During the second half of the 19th century the foreign trade turnover of Taganrog increased distinctly. Already at the beginning of the 20th century Taganrog held the second place in Russia in the importation and the sixth in the quantity of exported products. Due to dramatic developments in domestic commerce, the fairs lost their dominant role, and the stores, these 'eternal trade points' started to appear in the city. Petrovskaya Street and Gogolevski Street turned into main commercial highways of Taganrog. The foreign investments into Russian economy influenced the development of a large-scale industry in Taganrog. In 1896 with Belgian investments, started the construction of the iron-and-steel factory. The factory began to function a year later. The plant produced iron beams, <b>railings,</b> <b>pipes,</b> railway bands, iron sheets, rolled steel.|$|R
60|$|This jolly {{company were}} {{drinking}} together at Lockit’s in Charing Cross, when angry words arose between Captain Coote and Captain French; whom my Lord Mohun and my lord the Earl of Warwick(96) and Holland endeavoured to pacify. My Lord Warwick was {{a dear friend}} of Captain Coote, lent him a hundred pounds to buy his commission in the Guards; once when the captain was arrested for 13l. by his tailor, my lord lent him five guineas, often paid his reckoning for him, and showed him other offices of friendship. On this evening the disputants, French and Coote, being separated whilst they were upstairs, unluckily stopped to drink ale again at the bar of Lockit’s. The row began afresh—Coote lunged at French over the bar, and at last all six called for chairs, and went to Leicester Fields, where they fell to. Their lordships engaged {{on the side of}} Captain Coote. My Lord of Warwick was severely wounded in the hand, Mr. French also was stabbed, but honest Captain Coote got a couple of wounds—one especially, “a wound in the left side just under the short ribs, and piercing through the diaphragma,” which did for Captain Coote. Hence the trials of my Lords Warwick and Mohun: hence the assemblage of peers, the report of the transaction, in which these defunct fast men still live for the observation of the curious. My Lord of Warwick is brought to the bar by the Deputy Governor of the Tower of London, having the axe carried before him by the gentleman gaoler, who stood with it at the bar at the right hand of the prisoner, turning the edge from him; the prisoner, at his approach, making three bows, one to his grace the Lord High Steward, the other to the peers on each hand; and his grace and the peers return the salute. And besides these great personages, august in periwigs, and nodding to the right and left, a host of the small come up out of the past and pass before us—the jolly captains brawling in the tavern, and laughing and cursing over their cups—the drawer that serves, the bar-girl that waits, the bailiff on the prowl, the chairmen trudging through the black lampless streets, and smoking their <b>pipes</b> by the <b>railings,</b> whilst swords are clashing in the garden within. “Help there! a gentleman is hurt”: the chairmen put up their pipes, and help the gentleman over the railings, and carry him, ghastly and bleeding, to the bagnio in Long Acre, where they knock up the surgeon—a pretty tall gentleman—but that wound under the short ribs has done for him. Surgeon, lords, captains, bailiffs, chairmen, and gentleman gaoler with your axe, where be you now? The gentleman axeman’s head is off his own shoulders; the lords and judges can wag theirs no longer; the bailiff’s writs have ceased to run; the honest chairmen’s pipes are put out, and with their brawny calves they have walked away into Hades—all as irrecoverably done for as Will Mountford or Captain Coote. The subject of our night’s lecture saw all these people—rode in Captain Coote’s company of the Guards very probably—wrote and sighed for Bracegirdle, went home tipsy in many a chair, after many a bottle, in many a tavern—fled from many a bailiff.|$|R
