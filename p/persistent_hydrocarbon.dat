40|$|Organohalogen (OH) {{compounds}} are <b>persistent</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> compounds {{containing a}} halogen group, often chlorine or bromine, that substitutes for hydrogen atoms in different {{positions in the}} hydrocarbon. They may occur naturally, but this chapter 2 ̆ 7 s focus is on synthetically produced compounds, mainly organochlorines, that were produced for use as pesticides. Nine OH compounds (aldrin, chlordane, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane [DDT], dieldrin, endrin, heptachlor, hexachlorobenzene, mirex, and toxaphene) are in the top 12 list of particularly toxic and persistent organic pollutants (POPs) identified by the Stockholm Convention treaty implemented in 2004 under the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP). More than 90 countries have signed on to this treaty as Parties. These chemicals became classified as POPs because they may remain in the environment for decades following their use, they accumulate in fatty tissues of exposed organisms, they {{have a variety of}} toxic endpoints, and they travel long distances from source areas through atmospheric or aqueous transport...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{application}} of biochar to sandy loam soil to reduce leaching of three representative pollutants (a <b>persistent</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> (phenanthrene; logKOW 4. 46), a herbicide (isoproturon; logKOW 2. 50), and an antibiotic (sulfamethazine; logKOW 0. 28)) were investigated. The wood-derived biochar evaluated in our laboratory {{study was the}} solid co-product of a full-scale gasifier feeding a {{combined heat and power}} plant. The research aimed to demonstrate multiple environmental benefits with the innovative use of this biochar as a soil improver. RESULTS: Batch sorption experiments indicated 5 % biochar added to soil enhanced the partitioning coefficient (Kd) by factors of 2 for phenanthrene and 20 for both sulfamethazine and isoproturon. Column leaching experiments indicated a reduced porewater flow rate, up to 80 % slower in the column amended with 5 % biochar, and reduced pollutant leaching risks. Numerical models interlinked batch and column study observations. CONCLUSION: (i) Biochar enhanced sorption for the hydrophobic pollutant phenanthrene, and also the less hydrophobic pollutants sulfamethazine and isoproturon; (ii) reduced porewater flow rates following biochar amendment gave rise to greater opportunity for pollutant-solid interaction; (iii) mixing with soil resulted in biochar fouling affecting pollutant partition, and (iv) irreversible retention of pollutants by the soil was an important mechanism affecting pollutant transport...|$|E

40|$|As you can {{see from}} the general tenor of the printed program for this seminar, I am in the unenviable {{position}} of trying to discourage you from certain types of chemical control; but my assigned topic 2 ̆ 2 Side Effects of Persistent Toxicants, 2 ̆ 2 implies that mission. However, my remarks may be somewhat anticlimax at this time, because it is now generally conceded that we need to reevaluate certain chemicals in control work and to restrict or severely curtail use of those that per¬sist for long periods in the environment. So let me detail my reasons for a somewhat negative attitude toward the use of the <b>persistent</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> from my experience with the effects of these materials on birds. But first a few words of caution about control work in general, which so often disrupts natural processes and leads to new and unforseen difficulties. As an example, I think of the irruption of mice in the Klamath valley in northern California and southern Oregon in the late 2 ̆ 7502 ̆ 7 s. Intensive predator control, particularly of coyotes, but also of hawks and owls, was followed by a severe outbreak of mice in the spring of 1958. To combat the plague of mice, poisoned bait (1080 and zinc phosphide) was widely distributed in an area used by 500, 000 waterfowl each spring. More than 3, 000 geese were poisoned, so driv¬ing parties were organized to keep the geese off the treated fields. Here it seems conceivable that the whole chain of costly events [...] cost of the original and probably unnecessary predator control, economic loss to crops from the mouse outbreak, another poisoning campaign to combat the mice, loss of valuable waterfowl resources, and man-hours involved in flushing geese from the fields [...] might have been averted by a policy of not interfering with the original predator-prey relationship. This points to a dilemma we always face. (We create deplorable situations by clumsy interference with natural processes, then seek artificial cures to correct our mistakes.) For example, we spend millions of dollars in seeking cures for cancer, but do little or nothing about restricting the use of known or suspected carcinogens such as nicotine and DDT...|$|R
40|$|We {{began our}} {{research}} effort in 1968 with a project aimed at determining {{the efficacy of}} endrin treatment for pine vole control. Grower concerns and {{a small amount of}} laboratory data indicated that endrin was no longer as reliable in controlling pine voles {{as it was in the}} early sixties. Our initial efforts were twofold. We sought first to determine the existing efficacy of endrin and secondly to evaluate any resistance by pine voles to this chemical control procedure. Unfortunately, this entire endrin research effort was dropped by the Cooperative Research Unit when endrin as well as other <b>persistent</b> chlorinated <b>hydrocarbons</b> were banned for use in New York State about 1969. As an outgrowth of this false start we identified two important needs in the control area. The first of these was to gain basic population information about pine voles and meadow voles in Hudson Valley orchards. And, secondly, we saw the need to gain further information about the economic impact that these orchard pests were having on the growers...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability of}} Lentinus tigrinus {{to grow and}} to degrade <b>persistent</b> {{aromatic}} <b>hydrocarbons</b> in aged contaminated soil was assessed in this study. L. tigrinus extensively colonized the soil; its degradation activity after 60 d incubation at 28 ◦C, however, was mostly limited to dichloroaniline isomers, polychlorinated benzenes and diphenyl ether while the fungus was unable to deplete 9, 10 -anthracenedione and 7 -H-benz[DE]anthracene- 7 -one which were the major soil contaminants. Although clean-up levels were limited, both density of cultivable heterotrophic bacteria and richness of the resident bacterial community in L. tigrinus microcosms (LtM) increased over time to a significantly larger extent than the respective amended incubation controls (1. 9 × 109 CFU g− 1 vs. 1. 0 × 109 CFU g− 1 and 37 vs. 16, respectively). Naphthalene- and catechol 2, 3 -dioxygenase gene copy numbers, however, decreased over time {{at a higher rate}} in LtMthan in incubation controls likely due to a higher stimulation on heterotrophs than xenobiotics-degrading community members.

40|$|Soil {{contamination}} with petroleum <b>hydrocarbons,</b> <b>persistent</b> organic pollutants, {{halogenated organic}} chemicals and toxic metal(loid) s {{is a serious}} global problem affecting the human and ecological health.

Restoring these sites and regeneration of urban areas in a sustainable way for beneficial uses is a key priority for all industrialized nations. Bioremediation is considered a safe economical, efficient and sustainable technology for restoring the contaminated sites. This brief review presents an overview of bioremediation technologies in the context of sustainability, their applications and limitations in the reclamation of contaminated sites with an emphasis on brownfields. Also, the use of integrated approaches using the combination of chemical oxidation and bioremediation for persistent organic pollutants is discussed...|$|R
40|$|In der Gruppe der persistenten Chlorkohlenwasserstoffe werden die hoechsten Konzentrationen bei den polychlorierten Biphenylen (PCB), Gesamt-DDT und Hexachlorbenzol (HCB) festgestellt. Ein Vergleich der Medianwerte der letzten 6 Jahre zeigt, dass zunaechst eine deutliche, ab 1987 jedoch nur eine geringere Abnahme der Konzentrationen von DDT und HCB in Muttermilch festzustellen ist. Fuer den zeitlichen Verlauf der Gesamt-PCB-Konzentration ist kein eindeutiger Gang zu erkennen. Die mittleren Gehalte von Blei und Cadmium liegen deutlich unter der duldbaren Konzentration dieser Schwermetalle und sind damit toxikologisch nicht relevant. Aufgrund der geringen belastung der Muttermilch mit den Caesiumisotopen 134 und 137 bestand fuer Saeuglinge, die gestillt wurden, kein gesundheitliches Risiko. (VHE) In {{the group}} of <b>persistent</b> {{aromatic}} <b>hydrocarbons,</b> the highest values were determined for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), total DDT and hexachlorobenzene (HBC). Comparisons of the relevant median values {{for the past six}} years led to the conclusion that the steep initial decline in the breast milk concentrations of DDT and HBC was followed by reductions at a much lower pace in the years after 1987. The time course of the concentration of the total PCB did not appear to follow any particular pattern. The mean contents of lead and cadmium remained by a wide margin below the threshold values for these heavy metals and thus were of no relevance from the toxicological point of view. It was found that the 134 and 137 cesium isotopes constituted no particular health hazard for breast-fed infants, as the relevant concentrations in breast milk were low.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Great Slave Lake in the Northwest Territories, Canada, differs {{regionally}} in {{trophic status}} and {{local and regional}} inputs of contaminants. Spatial and temporal trends in contaminant levels in bioindicator species such as colonial waterbirds could offer insights into the potential for contaminant bioaccumulation in Great Slave Lake. <b>Persistent</b> chlorinated <b>hydrocarbon</b> contaminants, mercury (Hg), and selenium (Se) were examined in herring gull (Larus argentatus) eggs and livers collected from various locations on Great Slave Lake in 1995. Eggs were collected in May and June, and livers in May and August. Also, the relationship between contaminants and trophic level, as inferred from stable-nitrogen isotope analysis (δ 15 N), was examined in four colonial waterbird species: herring gull, mew gull (L. canus), Caspian tern (Sterna caspia), and black tern (Chlidonias niger). Finally, the co-accumulation of mercury and selenium was examined in eggs of these birds. There were no differences in chlorinated hydrocarbon concentrations among four sampling sites (colonies). Concentrations did not differ between herring gull adults collected in early May and those collected in early August. Chlorinated hydrocarbon concentrations in eggs of herring gull, mew gull, Caspian tern, and black tern were related to their trophic positions as inferred from their δ 15 N values in their lipid-free egg yolks. Concentrations in these colonial waterbirds were much higher than those in fish from Great Slave Lake, but lower than those in their conspecifics from the Great Lakes. It is probable that a relatively {{large proportion of the}} chlorinated hydrocarbon contaminant load in colonial waterbird eggs on Great Slave Lake results from exposure to and storage of such contaminants at more heavily contaminated wintering and staging areas. This possibility limits the usefulness of colonial waterbirds as indicator...|$|R
40|$|Oil {{exploration}} and production activities are common in the northern Gulf of Mexico {{as well as many}} other coastal and near coastal areas worldwide. Seasonal hypoxia is also a common feature in the Northern Gulf, and many other coastal areas, which is likely to increase in severity and extent with continuing anthropogenic nutrient inputs. Hypoxia has well established physiological effects on many organisms, and it has been shown to enhance the toxicity of polycyclic aromatic <b>hydrocarbons</b> (<b>persistent</b> components of petroleum) in fish. The goal {{of this study was to}} examine the combined effects of hypoxia and exposure to contaminants associated with oil spills. We evaluated the effects of short term (48 hr) exposures to Corexit EC 9500 A, water accommodated fractions (WAF), and chemically enhanced water accommodated fractions (CEWAF) prepared from Southern Louisiana Sweet Crude Oil (MC 242) on survival of sheepshead minnow (Cyprinodon variegatus) larvae held under normoxic (ambient air) or hypoxic (2 mg/L O 2) conditions. Results demonstrated that hypoxia significantly enhances mortality observed in response to Corexit or CEWAF solutions. In the latter case, significant interactions between the two stressors were also observed. Our data supports the need to further evaluate the combined stresses imparted by hypoxia and exposure to petroleum hydrocarbons and dispersants...|$|R
40|$|Plant {{storage is}} a key {{component}} in the global cycling of <b>persistent</b> polycyclic aromatic <b>hydrocarbons</b> (PAHs) and constitutes a crucial step to understand environmental fate of such pollutants. This work aimed at quantifying biochemical forms of phenanthrene (PHE) stored in plants and determining the main parameter between the plant species and the soil characteristics involved in the PHE bioaccumulation. An experiment was conducted in a growth chamber to study the storage of PHE in ryegrass and clover in three distinct artificially contaminated soils (1, 000 mu g g(- 1) DW). A preliminary experiment was designed to develop an extraction method which distinguished easily extractable PHE (free-PHE) from less extractable PHE (bound-PHE). PHE {{was found to be}} mainly recovered in plant roots (around 90 % of the total PHE recovered in plants) in its free form. PHE was transported upward from the roots into shoots. PHE recovered in shoots (around 1 mu g g(- 1)) was divided into its free (60 %) and bound (40 %) forms except for one treatment. Observed differences of root PHE storage were clearly related with the PHE dissipation in soil and then with the plant species. This work outlined the importance of quantifying the bound and free PAHs in plants in further researches...|$|R
40|$|A {{screening}} for <b>persistent</b> chlorinated <b>hydrocarbons</b> {{was carried out}} in December 1995 in the main coastal lagoons on the Pacific side of Nicaragua, where most of the country’s agriculture and pesticide use has been taking place for decades. Results {{for a wide range of}} organochlorine pesticides in lagoon sediments show levels that generally were very low in Estero Real, Estero Padre Ramos, and estuary of San Juan del Sur. For example, total DDTs in these lagoons averaged 4. 5 6 3. 4 ng g 21 dry weight, which may be considered a baseline level for the region. Other compounds such as HCHs, BHC, endosulfan, heptachlor, endrin, toxaphene, and aroclors were present in concentrations even lower, generally below 1 ng g 21 dry weight. However, sediments of the Esteros Naranjo–Paso Caballos system at Chinandega district contained pesticide residues in much higher levels, attaining maximum values of 1, 420 ng g 21 and 270 ng g 21 dry weight, respectively, for toxaphene and total DDTs. Other compounds such as aroclors, chlordane, endosulfan, and dieldrin were also present in the sediments of this lagoon system, but in lower concentrations. The very high concentrations of toxaphene and DDTs in this lagoon are a result of the intensive use of these pesticides in cotton growing in the district of Chinandega. Due to the long environmental half-lives of these compounds (t 1 ⁄ 2. 10 years in temperate soils), their concentrations in lagoon sediments will likely remain high for years to come. Based on these results, the development of the new shrimp farming activities in the Pacific coastal lagoons should be restricted to selected areas. The intensive use of pesticides in Nicaragua, which for decades has been one of the biggest pesticide importers and users in Central America (Appel 1991; Castillo et al. 1997), is likely to cause severe contamination of aquatic systems. In particular halogenated hydrocarbons, including chlorinated pesticides and industrial chemicals such as the polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), are lipophilic toxic compounds that bioaccumulate and transfer in the food chain. Introduced in aquatic environments these chemicals may compromise the health of the ecosystems (Tardiff 1991). This is the case for the coastal lagoons of the Pacific coast of Nicaragua, where most of the country’s agriculture and population have been concentrated. In particular, cotton growing, a pesticide intensive agriculture started in the 1950 s, was developed in this region of Nicaragua (Appel 1991). The degradation of these coastal lagoon systems, especially the reduction of mangrove forest and overexploitation of fishery resources, has received focused attention from national authorities. Agrochemical residues are suspected in the degradation of these lagoons, but have not been investigated. Furthermore, with the plans for developing shrimp rearing farms in these coastal lagoons (esteros), contamination by agrochemical residues becomes a matter of much concern for the future of this industry. To provide information on the potential impacts from agriculture and urban development, a screening of the contaminants {{was carried out in}} the main lagoons of the Pacific coast. This paper presents the results of the analyses of chlorinated hydrocarbons in lagoon sediments and discusses the ecotoxicological hazard posed by the current levels of persistent pesticide residues to aquatic biota...|$|R
40|$|D. Phil. The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to describe the population genetic structure of African Whitebacked Vultures (Pseudogyps africanus) and to compare values to those previously documented for the Cape Griffon Vulture (Gyps coprotheres). The percentage of polymorphic. loci (P = 34. 15 %, 0. 99 criterion) and average heterozygosity (17 = 0. 108, ± 0. 032) calculated for P. africanus, confirm low levels of genetic -variation as reported for G. coprotheres. Blood samples' obtained from Lappetfaced (Torgos, tracheliotos) and Egyptian (Neophron percnopterus) Vultures enabled an evaluation of the genetic differentiation among the four southern African vulture species from allele frequency data assessed at 19 presumptive gene loci. Six (31. 58 %) of the 19 shared loci were polymorphic. Values of 1. 26 (10. 1), 26. 32 % and 0. 076 (± 0. 047) for P. 'africanus, 1. 21 (± 0. 1), 21. 05 % and 0. 097 (± 0. 045) for T. tracheliotos, 1. 11 (± 0. 7), 21. 05 %. and 0. 053. (± 0. 053) for N: percnopterus and 1. 05 (± 0. 5), 5. 26 % and 0. 044 (± 0. 047) for G. coprotheres were obtained for the mean number of alleles per locus, P and Ti respectively. An average between-population fixigion index (FsT) value of 0. 322 was obtained, which is indicative of significant (P < 0. 01) differentiation between the four accipitrid species studied. Reference values for some haematological and plasma chemical parameters were established in 33 apparently normal, free-living, African Whitebacked Vulture nestlings. This. information can be. used in future ornithological research. A total of 27 variables. were examined, which include: leucocyte and erythrocyte counts, haemoglobin concentration,. haematocrit, haematimetric indices, glucose, creatinine, urea, total prOtein, albumin, globulin, albumin/globulin ratio, cholesterol, total lipids, triglycerides, aspartate aminotransferase, cholinesterase, lactate dehydrogenase, alkaline phosphatase, calcium, phosphorus, chloride, potassium, sodium and osmolarity. Only five parameters exhibited statistically significant (p < 0. 05) differences between the two populations assayed. The Sandveld population showed elevated mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration and alkaline phosphatase levels relative to the Dronfield population, whereas, the latter group displayed higher erythrocyte counts and potassium and sodium values than birds from the Sandveld community. Gaschromatography was used to establish the presence of quantifiable. residues. of 14 <b>persistent</b> chlorinated <b>hydrocarbon</b> pollutants in whole blood, clotted blood, heart, kidney, liver, bone, fat and muscle samples obtained from individual African Whitebacked, Cape. Griffon and Lappetfaced Vultures from different localities in South Africa. Concentrations of seven essential elements (Ca, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn) and four toxic metals (Al, Ni, Pb and Sr) were, furthermore, measured. The levels of pollutants measured in whole blood samples of live specimens were compared between nestlings from two natural breeding colonies, adults from a wildlife area and birds held in captivity. Statistically significant differences between populations were detected in geometric means calculated for y-BHC, a-chlordane and a-endosulfan. Five of the organochlorine contaminants displayed significant variations between concentrations detected in the clotted blood, organs and muscles excised from vulture carcasses. This includes residues ofy-BHC, a-chlordane, dieldrin,, 8 -endosulfan and heptachlor epoxide. Values of the respective organochlorines obtained in vulture samples were generally low in comparison to results documented for a number of avian species. Levels of the, majority of metals analysed differed significantly- between two or more of the sampling localities, between adults and nestlings, and between captive and wild individuals. Metals which did not occur in such distinctly defining concentrations were Sr, Cu and Fe. Birds from Moholoholo maintained the highest overall blood metal burden, while nestlings from Dronfield were the least contaminated Significant differences were present between two or more tissues types for all the metals. The predominant sites for metal accumulation in vultures were the fatty tissues and bones. Most of the levels of metals measured in vultures compared well with concentrations reported for other avian species, and were generally within the range documented for species devoid of deleterious symptoms induced from heavy metal poisoning. However; certain individuals exhibited potentially toxic concentrations of specific metals such as Cu, Fe, Ni, and Pb. Continual monitoring of breeding colonies is recommended. The suitability of African Whitebacked Vulture nestlings as basic bioindicatori is highly advocated. The genetic data from this study can be used to compare levels of genetic diversity remaining in captive and wild vulture populations. An assessment of the amount and pattern of genetic variation of current populations of vulture species is an essential step towards ensuring the longterm survival of these birds. The phylogenetic conclusions found in. this study through allozyme electrophoresis correspond to results obtained from nucleotide sequence studies of the mitochondrial cytochrome b. gene. This points to an extent of positive corroboration between the two techniques. The haematological profile established for African Whitebacked Vulture nestlings constitutes a set of reference values that was previously unavailable for southern African vulture species. This data can assist in diagnosing and monitoring pathological and clinical' incidents detected in vultures. Values for a number of organochlo?ine pesticides and heavy metals, which have not been analysed in vulture species in the past, are documented. These values can serve as guidelines for future research, as well as control values for monitoring the occurrence and distribution of these contaminants within the habitats of vulture species. This study, therefore, presents information for research fields directly related to the survival of vulture populations. These factors must be included in future vulture management and reintroduction programmes as they will serve to enhance the success of conservation attempts...|$|R
