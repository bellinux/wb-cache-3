50|$|Platanthera flava has from 10-40 {{flowers in}} an inflorescence. In {{the north of}} its range, in Canada, this species is {{particularly}} associated with shorelines of lakes and rivers, in the seasonally flooded zone. In Nova Scotia, it occurs in wet meadows on seasonally flooded shorelines with rare shoreline species such as <b>Plymouth</b> <b>Gentian.</b> In the south, such as in Texas, it is found in wet savannas and flatwoods. The shoreline habitats of the north are maintained by ice scour, while in the south, the flatwoods are maintained by recurring fire. Hence, it appears that this species depends upon recurring natural disturbance to maintain open sunny conditions.|$|E
50|$|The {{river is}} nationally {{significant}} for its many coastal plain plant species. Some, like the <b>Plymouth</b> <b>Gentian</b> (Sabatia kennedyana) and Pink Coreopsis (Coreopsis rosea) occur {{nowhere else in}} Canada. These species occur on gently-sloping sand and gravel shorelines lower in the watershed. There is an online guide to assist with identifying all these species. Wilson's Lake {{has one of the}} largest populations of Atlantic Coastal Plain plants in Canada, and is the site of the small but highly significant Tusket River Nature Reserve. In 2011 botanists exploring a newly acquired protected area, the Jack and Darlene Stone Conservation Lands, discovered another rare plant species, Maleberry (Lyonia ligustrina), the first time this species has been found growing in Canada.|$|E
50|$|Sabatia kennedyana is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the gentian family known by the common name <b>Plymouth</b> rose <b>gentian.</b> It is native to eastern North America. It has a disjunct distribution, occurring in Nova Scotia, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina.|$|R
