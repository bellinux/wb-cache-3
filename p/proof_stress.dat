The test specimens were cold-rolled from flat strips of lean duplex stainless steel. The material properties of high strength cold-formed lean duplex stainless steel square and rectangular hollow sections were determined. Tensile coupons {{in the flat}} portions and corners of each section were tested. Hence, the Youngs moduli, 0. 2 % <b>proof</b> <b>stresses,</b> 1. 0 % <b>proof</b> <b>stresses,</b> tensile strengths, elongation at fracture and the RambergOsgood parameter (n) of lean duplex material for each section were measured. The material properties of the complete cross-sections in the cold-worked state were also obtained from stub column tests. The initial local geometric imperfections of the six sections were measured, and the profiles of the local imperfections along cross-section were plotted for each section. Residual stresses were measured for section 150 × 50 × 2. 5 using the method of sectioning. The membrane and bending residual stress distributions in the cross-section were obtained and plotted. Furthermore, finite element model of stub columns was developed and compared well with the test results. The stub column test strengths were also compared with the design strengths predicted by the American Specification, Australian/New Zealand Standard and European Code for stainless steel structures. Generally, the three specifications conservatively predicted the column strengths. The European Code provides the most conservative prediction. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

By Ion Beam Assisted Magnetron Sputtering (IAMS), Cu film with 2. 4 µm thickness was deposited on a strip of super high strength steel 37 SiMnCrNiMoV, and the specimens were treated by vacuum-annealing at different temperature. The X-ray tensile test was used to measure the longitudinal and transverse stresses and applied strain for Cu film.

Both thermal cycling and isothermal exposure reduced 0. 2 % <b>proof</b> <b>stress,</b> tensile strength and micro Vickers hardness to one third through a half of those of the original SiCp/Al 6061 composites and mainly due to the softening of the matrix. In addition, the thermal cycling caused interfacial debonding between coarse particles and matrix in the SiCp/Al, which was confirmed from the observation of fracture morphology. The reduction in 0. 2 % <b>proof</b> <b>stress</b> and tensile strength increased with increasing SiC particle volume fraction.

Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and Electron Back-Scattering Diffraction (EBSD) studies revealed that the deformation microstructures of both metals evolves from low-angled micro bands and dislocation cells after N= 2 passes towards more equiaxed, homogeneous subgrain/grain structures comprismg higher-angles of misorientation after N = 8 passes. In both metals, the percentage rise in ~ 3 and random boundaries are attributed to mechanisms that favour low-energy boundary configurations during ECAE. Texture evolution involves gradual changes in individual component strengths during multi-pass ECAE.

The fiber-based model incorporates the accurate three-stage stress-strain relations of {{stainless steel}}s, accounting for different strain hardening characteristics in tension and compression.

The results obtained indicate that increasing the eccentricity ratio, column slenderness ratio and diameter-to-thickness ratio remarkably decreases the initial flexural stiffness and ultimate axial strength of CFSST columns, but considerably increases their displacement ductility.

In this paper a slightly modified version of the proposed ISO-standard used at Outokumpu/Avesta Research Centre (ARC) is presented. The method considers the limiting principal strains before and after failure has occurred. The obtained results from the present approach are compared with previous internal methods used at the company. The previous internal methods consisted of evaluating the limiting principal strains at the maximum punch force before fracture or at a set punch distance before fracture.
