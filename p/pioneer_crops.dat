40|$|Weeds just {{will not}} {{lie down and}} take 'No!' for an answer. After the umpteenth round of weeding, they shoot up again, ruining harvests and elbowing out crops altogether. If we {{understood}} better why weeds appear and re-appear we could work on better control measures instead of simply trying to eradicate them. If we don t want them, {{we need to be}} ahead of them. Despite their pretty-pretty, esoteric names such as the devil s horse whip or prickly pigweed, weeds generally wreak more havoc than their fellow pests of insects, bacteria and viruses. They cause phenomenal losses in agriculture, especially in tropical areas where one-quarter of a crop s harvest is lost to weeds. Fighting them also accounts for huge amounts of time and energy. Weeding by hand or hoe {{is one of the most}} time-consuming tasks in agriculture, and a task performed mostly by women and children. But when exactly is a weed a weed? A couple of maize stalks in a field of tomatoes can be considered weeds but real weeds are plants that grow in places where they are really unwanted, either because they compete with crops for nutrients, water and sunlight, or because they are poisonous. Most farmers therefore make a distinction between useful and harmful weeds. The 'useful weeds' it takes some time to get that over your tongue, maybe - are the ones that are used for medicines, as fodder for animals and herbs in cooking. Or they may be the plants that keep vermin out of crops, fix nitrogen in the soil or provide protection against erosion. As long as they do not compete too much with the actual crops, they are left to grow for the purpose they serve. Alongside this approach is that of 'relaxed weeding' which means pulling out those weeds that are harmful, toxic and really have no purpose nor any use, not even as compost or fuel. In smallholder farms, weeds are regarded in a different way to on large commercial farms or plantations where any plant other than the cash crop is called a weed, whether useful or not. Weeds make haste About 8, 000 plants worldwide are currently considered as real weeds and out of these, a small elite of 250 are considered as the world s major noxious, or harmful, weeds. Now you won t find them all together in your field. Obviously not. After all, one weed may be harmful or hostile to another. And, as any other plant, they all have their preferences for temperature, soils, fertility and humidity. Small wonder that weeds occur between and around crops with similar preferences. Weeds have things in common too. One classical farmer s saying explains how to tell weeds from vegetables: If you see anything growing, pull it out. If it starts to grow again, it was a weed. One trait of weeds is that they grow and propagate fast. Sweet flowers are slow and weeds make haste, as Shakespeare once wrote. Annual weeds produce large amounts of seeds which often retain their germination power for years and years. For example, Amaranthus spp produces up to 235, 000 seeds per plant cycle, and is regarded as a pesky weed by many farmers, whereas it has also been a staple food for more than 4, 000 years in central America. Perennial weeds propagate vegetatively through rootstocks, tubers, rhizomes (stems) or through running across the soil surface. Another thing weeds have in common is their reason to exist and why they shoot up so fast and in such large numbers on barren land. When we clear native vegetation, plough the soil and establish annual or perennial crops, we are in fact defying the ecological succession of the course of nature. We are thus holding back the process of natural plant succession, which really aims at changing the environment back into its previous state as a forest. Weeds are <b>pioneer</b> <b>crops</b> and thrive on soils with low fertility and low plant diversity. In that respect weeds are also telling us that things are none too bright in the soil. For shifting cultivators, for instance, the start of excessive weed growth has always been the signal to pack up and move on. A bit of everything For decades, it was believed that modern agriculture would achieve production increases mainly through a combination of mechanisation, mono-cropping, improved varieties, applying agro-chemicals and, indeed, fighting weeds at all cost. Applying herbicides to a weed was seen as much easier and cheaper than using labour to remove it either manually or mechanically. As time passed, however, herbicide resistance grew, as did general awareness about the environmental and health aspects of agro-chemicals. All the while, the weeds were literally gaining ground. Each year, as more and more herbicides were applied, so too did the crop losses caused by weeds. Basically, weed management revolves around five sets of measures. Using chemicals is one. Herbicides have the major disadvantage of being costly and sometimes dangerous, as well as their other constraints. Applying fertilisers is another - also costly chemical way of managing weeds, by increasing soil fertility. Biological measures present a second way of managing weeds. Applying intercropping or mulching, agroforestry or growing cover crops are examples of these (see boxes). A third way is through the genetic alteration of crops, using conventional breeding techniques or genetic engineering, to increase the crop s resistance or tolerance to weeds. The commonest way to get rid of weeds is through tillage and weeding. Other cultural techniques, such as burning vegetation and ploughing the soil can be counter-productive since they create an ideal environment or, to call a spade a spade, an ecological desert - for weeds to pop up and start their first phase of succession. And the fifth way? Well, as with many things in life, a combination of approaches can often yield the best result. If a good farmland is the reflection of a healthy natural ecosystem, where soil fertility is kept up in order and plant diversity mimics nature, then there is no need for noxious weeds to emerge in such large numbers. Where there s a will, there s a way. Where there s a will, there s no weed. [caption to illustration] The picture of proverbs. Many hands make light work, but prevention is better than cure.

There is a definite limit to both of these options for food security and their multiple negative effects on the environment undermine the aim for sustainability. Presently {{the impact of the}} Green Revolution on crop production is levelling off at high yields attained and even the potential of large scale irrigation programmes and transgenic crops seem to be limited in view of the expected increase in demand for food. Moreover, climate change threatens to affect agricultural production across the globe. Skyfarming represents a promising approach for food production that is largely environment independent and therefore immune to climate change. Optimal growing conditions, shielded from weather extremes and pests are aimed at raising plant production towards the physiological potential.

The large-scale detection of salt tolerance traits in cotton accessions, and the identification of elite quantitative trait loci (QTLs) /genes for salt-tolerance have been very important in salt tolerance breeding. Here, 43 advanced salt-tolerant and 31 highly salt-sensitive cultivars were detected by analyzing ten salt tolerance related traits in 304 upland cotton cultivars. Among them, 11 advanced salt-tolerance and eight highly salt-sensitive cultivars were consistent with previously reported results. Association analysis of ten salt-tolerance related traits and 145 SSRs was performed, and a total of 95 significant associations were detected; 17, 41, and 37 of which were associated with germinative index, seedling stage physiological index, and four seedling stage biochemical indexes, respectively. Of these associations, 20 SSR loci were simultaneously associated with two or more traits. Furthermore, we detected 117 elite alleles associated with salt-tolerance traits, 4 of which were reported previously. Among these loci, 44 (37. 60 %) were rare alleles with a frequency of less than 5 %, 6 only existed in advanced salt-tolerant cultivars, and 2 only in highly salt-sensitive cultivars. As a result, 13 advanced salt-tolerant cultivars were selected to assemble the optimal cross combinations by computer simulation for the development of salt-tolerant accessions.

Biodiversity is an essential aspect of an organic farm plan. The idea of including tree crops and other perennials into the vision of an organic farm as a “living system ” is very much compatible with the goals and philosophy of organic farming. Before modern no-till farming systems were developed, tree crops and pasture systems were found to provide similar benefits for controlling soil erosion and conserving soil carbon. For example, J.

40|$|Through its {{activities}} CTA has shown {{its support for}} the production and dissemination of scientific and technical information. Its major goal is to improve relationships between institutes, universities, government departments and agencies involved in rural development in ACP countries. The language gap, particularly between English and French-speaking countries, {{has been one of}} the main obstacles to communication between researchers and rural development officers in these different areas. CTA not only contributes to the financing of publications for agricultural extension but places special emphasis on the translation of books and documents so as to facilitate information exchange. With this objective in mind, CTA launched the translation of the 'The Tropical Agriculturalist', a French series of practical field guides and textbooks intended for: - producers, farmers and farm managers - agricultural extension officers - students in advanced agricultural studies - teachers and lecturers - rural and community development programmes One of the first textbooks in this series is 'Upland rice', which will be published by Macmillan. It describes in detail upland rice farming in Africa, and covers the main aspects of farming systems, crop requirements, disease and weed control as well as harvesting and storage. About 16 million hectares worldwide are devoted to upland rice cultivation. Brazil, the world's leading producer of this type of rice, accounts for 4. 5 million hectares. In Asia Upland rice covers approximately 9 million hectares which is only a small proportion of the total rice acreage, compared to Africa, where it accounts for 60 % of the rice acreage. One of the most useful characteristics of rice is the fact that it can be grown under very different environmental conditions, particularly from the point of view of water supply. Upland rice is primarily cultivated with rainwater on soils with a high water-holding capacity and is frequently found on sloping areas or hillsides. The most commonly found rice species in Africa is the large, traditional Oryza saliva, imported from Asia some centuries ago. Upland rice is generally grown by small farmers for their own needs. Knowledge of the rice growth cycle is important as it helps determine certain cropping techniques. It makes it possible to choose the sowing date for a given variety in order to adapt it to a specific climate. The adoption of a variety is determined by two principal criteria: suitability to the local ecology and cropping system and resistance to weeds and pests. There are basically three cultivation techniques used for upland rice: shifting, pioneer and fixed. Shifting cultivation is the most widespread traditional system found in Africa. The farmer clears a plot of land (which is often quite small and burns all the vegetation at the start of the rainy season. Soil preparation is generally confined to simply turning over the surface layer with a hoe. The sowing density is usually low and intercropping (with maize, cassava, yams or spices) is common. All activities are done by hand and only panicles are harvested. This type of production suffers from weed invasion and soil fertility tends to define, which obliges the farmer to abandon the plot after one or two years of exploitation. Rice may be grown as a <b>pioneer</b> <b>crop</b> in two ways. First, after land has been cleared, as an improved crop prior to the planting of a pasture mixture. Second, as a cover crop in young plantations of coffee, cacao, citrus and rubber trees. Fixed rice cultivation is more intensive and should observe a number of rules: fertilization, rotation with leguminous plants, measures to control weeds and erosion. In order to make a return on the investment in fertilizers, herbicides equipment and labour, varieties with yields of at least 2. 5 tonnes/ha must be used. The main constraints in rice cropping are the control of weeds, drought and soil fertility. Birds are the major pests in Africa and blast is the most serious disease which attacks leaves and panicles. Once rice has been harvested and dried, the panicles have to be threshed. The traditional method consists of using sticks or flails. Today, fixed threshers are becoming more widespread. It is essential that rice be stored away from water and insects. In theory, properly dried and aerated rice keeps well and does not require any special treatment. This textbook, written in an easy-to read style, gives a technical prescription for the transfer from a traditional system practised by small holders to a more profitable cropping system. It thus emphasizes varieties and techniques such as rotation, fertilization and mechanization. These methods should be adopted as part of an integrated system, in accordance with environmental conditions and especially the technical and financial resources of farmers.

40|$|Insuring against {{bad weather}} Cue: Do {{you run a}} business? If so, what risks do you face? Maybe you fear that your goods might be stolen or damaged, or that you will lose your market to competitors. In some cases {{you may be able}} to get some {{financial}} protection by taking out an insurance policy. But what about farmers? Farmers face significant risks in growing and harvesting a crop: risk of pests and disease outbreaks, of drought or flooding, and risk that their crops may be damaged in storage or during transport. Is there anything you can do as a farmer to protect yourself? In Malawi, Opportunity International bank is offering a way for farmers to be insured against at least some risks. The bank is helping farmers to buy weather-linked crop-insurance policies. As a result, if crops fail because of bad weather, farmers automatically receive financial compensation for their losses. Bank employee Gift Livata explained more to Excello Zidana, about how Malawi is taking the lead in crop insurance for farmers. IN:	?The micro-insurance policies work? OUT:	?<b>pioneer</b> of this <b>crop</b> insurance. ? DUR?N:	 4 ? 32 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Gift Livata of Opportunity International in Malawi, on a new type of crop insurance aimed at small-scale commercial farmers. The interview comes from a resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Livata	The micro-insurance policies work in the way that we link the farmers with the insurance companies. And we secure the crop that the farmers are growing from the risk of weather calamities, such as drought and floods and excess rainfall. Zidana	What kind of farmers have been asking for this insurance? I?m talking about the scale of the farmers. Are they commercial or subsistence? Which ones? Livata	Yes, the interest of the bank is on small-scale commercial farmers. Why we are interested in small-scale commercial farmers is that, what we give them is a loan. We give them a loan for inputs and also a loan for the insurance premiums. So the subsistence farmer might not be able to pay. But the smallholder commercial farmer, if they have a little of a cash crop plus a food crop, from the cash crop they should be able to pay back the loan. Zidana	Let us go straight to the issue now. Suppose I am a farmer and I?m growing five hectares of maize or let?s say groundnuts and I want to insure that against any risk. How can I go about the whole process? Livata	What you need to do is to come to the bank and apply for the loan. And once we approve your loan it means you directly access the crop insurance. But now beyond that of course there is a requirement that as a farmer, your farm should be close to a weather station. There must be a radius of not more than 30 kilometres from the weather station to your farm. If you are within this radius then you automatically qualify for this crop insurance. And once you qualify for the crop insurance there is no need for you to fill any form or to apply to the insurance companies. The rest of the job is done by the bank. Zidana	Now how does the bank verify the type of enterprise the farmers are involved in? Livata	We verify of course the enterprise that the farmer is doing. Basically most of the time we work in alliance with organisations that are able to provide technical services to the farmers. Because we don?t want the farmer to lose their crop because they lacked maybe some technical expertise. And in line with this we have also a unit within the bank that go and visit the farmers and make sure that they followed all the good agricultural practices. And thereafter there is no more verification that is needed. If they come with a claim to the bank we don?t need to verify anything because the farmers are within the area where rainfall is recorded. So every ten days the meteorological department provide us with data. And that data is detailed and we are able to see from which area there was a shortfall of rainfall and from which area there was maybe excess rainfall. And that rainfall that has fallen in a particular area is directly linked to the contract that the farmers are given. Zidana	What happens during lean years? Do you expect farmers to submit their claims? Livata	Basically we don?t expect farmers to come and submit their claims. This type of insurance is quite different from the traditional insurance that other organisations offer. The weather report that we receive automatically gives an indication of how much the stress the crop is under and how much the crop has suffered and that is translated to monetary value. So once we observe the data, even before the farmer thinks of coming to the bank and telling us what has happened in their field, we will already know what has happened in the field and we automatically give them what is due for them or the payout that they need to receive. Zidana	What is the response like from farmers? Livata	The response has been overwhelming. We started with about 500 farmers and the following year we had about 800 farmers, and this year we had over 1, 000 farmers. In the coming season we are recruiting 4, 000 farmers. So people are interested and they want to be recruited for this programme. Zidana	Do you have any record that this is also happening in other countries within the region? Livata	Malawi happens to be the <b>pioneer</b> of <b>crop</b> insurance. And of course recently there have been countries like South Africa, Angola and Kenya who want also roll out what we have been doing. But we have done it successfully and we also believe that they are also going to do it successfully. Beyond Africa I also know that it?s being done in Philippines. But here in Africa Malawi is the <b>pioneer</b> of this <b>crop</b> insurance. End of track.

These research activities, and others, all have an international dimension. It was fitting therefore for the Station to celebrate its 150 th Anniversary in 1993 by launching Rothamsted International. This major initiative was originally conceived {{as a means of}} making Rothamsted's expertise and facilities more widely accessible to scientists overseas, particularly in developing countries. Rothamsted International aims to foster collaborative research programmes with national and international centres in developing countries and to offer Fellowships to visiting overseas researchers, thereby helping to secure two-way institutional links and information exchange. So far, 17 Fellowships have been awarded. Rothamsted is well-placed to contribute to sustainable agricultural development. It has a long-standing interest in the chemical and biological processes that influence soil fertility, and has major programmes on the cycling of nitrogen and carbon in soils, and on the movement and fate of agrochemicals. The results obtained from both its long-term 'Classical' field experiments and computer simulation models are applicable to tropical and temperate agriculture. A very practical outcome of research has been the commercial development of Rhizobium inoculants for legume seed. The Tropical Virus Unit has a wealth of information on viruses in tropical and subtropical crops, including black pepper, sugar cane, cassava and water melon, and currently, this Unit is investigating lethal yellowing of coconuts (African and Caribbean) and bacterial wilt caused by Pseudomonas solanacearum. Rothamsted also collaborates closely with CAB International's Institute of Parasitology and their combined collection of live temperate, tropical and sub-tropical nematode cultures is the largest in the world. An ODA-funded Biometrics Unit advises on statistical problems associated with crop, agro-forestry and animal experimentation, and also provides training on statistics and computing.
