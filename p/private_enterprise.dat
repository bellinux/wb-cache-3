5|$|Ryzhkov's Plan and The 500 Days Programme were broadly similar, {{with both}} {{supporting}} price liberalisation, decentralisation and privatisation. The main {{difference between the}} two was Ryzhkov's desire to retain much of the social security system, free education for all and the continuance of a strong central government apparatus. The 500 Days Programme did not mention political union with the other Soviet republics, but instead weakened the authority of the central government by establishing a market economy. In other words, they left the question of continuing or dissolving the Soviet Union open. On 17 September in a meeting of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, Gorbachev openly supported the 500 Days Programme, claiming it would not lead to the reestablishment of capitalism, but instead to a mixed economy where <b>private</b> <b>enterprise</b> played an important role.|$|E

Instead, the Norwegian Government chose to establish a government agency to build and operate the network.

Give Me a Break: How I Exposed Hucksters, Cheats, and Scam Artists and Became the Scourge of the Liberal Media is a 2005 {{autobiography}} from Harper Perennial documenting {{his career and}} philosophical transition from liberalism to libertarianism.

It was a New York Times bestseller for 11 weeks. Myths, Lies, and Downright Stupidity: Get Out the Shovel– Why Everything You Know Is Wrong, {{which was published in}} 2007 by Hyperion, questions the validity of various conventional wisdoms, and argues that the belief he is conservative is untrue.

It argues that government policies meant to solve problems instead produce new ones, and that free individuals and the private sector perform tasks more efficiently than the government does.|$|E

30|$|Based on the {{findings}} of previous studies, this article proposes that the state-business relationship in contemporary China can be categorized into three types: Clientelism, Organizational participation, and Contention. However, existing research does not identify the determinants or conditions that can explain the differentiation among the above three types. This article thus fills this gap by revealing how the economic status of <b>private</b> <b>enterprises</b> influences the differentiation of the state-business relationship in contemporary China. More specifically, the economic status or economic contribution (hereafter referred altogether as “economic capital”) of <b>private</b> <b>enterprises</b> determines their latent or visible bargaining power, which then influences the strategy selection of <b>private</b> <b>enterprises</b> in resolving administrative disputes with the local government. The statistical findings reveal the following pattern. First, facing administrative disputes, <b>private</b> <b>enterprises</b> with higher economic capital are more likely to communicate with the government agencies through formal institutional channels. Second, there is an inverted-U shape relationship between economic capital and the selection of the associational approach or the clientelist approach in resolving administrative disputes. Compared to enterprises with higher or lower economic capital, <b>private</b> <b>enterprises</b> with middle-scale economic capital are more likely to seek help from business associations or particularistic personal relationships with officials.|$|R
30|$|Departing {{from the}} empirics, this article reveals the {{variation}} in the state-business relationship in contemporary China {{as a result of}} the economic capital possessed by <b>private</b> <b>enterprises.</b> In addition to the regime’s characteristics, features of the business itself also shape its relationship with the authority. <b>Private</b> <b>enterprises</b> with different levels of economic capital enjoy different levels of bargaining power and thus construct essentially different relationships with the local government. <b>Private</b> <b>enterprises</b> with high economic capital are preferred and supported by the local state because of their prominent contribution to the local economy. They are more likely to obtain institutional opportunities of direct and individual communication with the government. Thus, they also avoid using business associations to solve practical problems. <b>Private</b> <b>enterprises</b> with medium economic capital usually lack these large enterprises’ institutional priority. They are also afraid of the political risks and economic loss entailed by confrontation. Medium-sized <b>private</b> <b>enterprises</b> are therefore more inclined to build business associations or informal clientelist networks to resolve administrative disputes. CCP membership instead of economic capital significantly influences the selection of confrontation over informal ways. This implies that ideology and consciousness rather than bargaining power are crucial when using confrontational strategies.|$|R
5|$|The Sunda Strait {{campaign}} of January 1794 {{was a series}} of manoeuvres and naval actions fought between warships and privateers of the French Republic and a squadron of vessels sent by the British East India Company to protect trade in the region, later augmented by Dutch warships. The campaign developed as French forces based on Île de France reacted more quickly than the British forces in the Indian Ocean to the expansion of the French Revolutionary Wars on 1 February 1793. French privateers rapidly spread along the British trade routes in the Far East, becoming concentrated around the narrow Sunda Strait between the islands of Java and Sumatra in the Dutch East Indies. These ships were soon joined by French Navy frigates and began to inflict losses on shipping in the region. The Royal Navy forces in the Indian Ocean were deployed elsewhere and so the East India Company, the <b>private</b> <b>enterprise</b> that ruled much of British India in the 1790s and maintained their own fleet and navy, raised a squadron of armed merchant ships to patrol the Strait and drive off the raiders.|$|E
5|$|The castle {{continued}} {{to be used as}} the county gaol after the war and in 1653 a new gaol, built from stone and brick, was constructed in the castle grounds. In the 1770s the prison reformer John Howard inspected the gaol and was very critical of the facility. In particular he complained about the castle's underground dungeon, accessed down a flight of 26 steps; the room was circular, 18 feet (5.5 m) across, and guarded by an iron grill. Worcester conducted extensive work after the report at a cost of £3,431 (£364,000 at 2009 prices), and by 1788 the prison had 18 new cells for men and two for women, in addition to the dungeon and the sick-rooms. Nevertheless, it was housing 74 inmates at the time of Howard's inspection, with two prisoners routinely sharing each cell, sleeping together on the floor. Like other prisons of the time, Worcester Castle was run as a <b>private</b> <b>enterprise,</b> in this case by a local butcher, who was paid £150 a year (£15,400) to run the facility. The prison was known to suffer from outbreaks of gaol fever, which claimed the life of a local doctor who visited the facility.|$|E

Following the murder of ANC activist Chris Hani, Mandela made a publicised speech to calm rioting, soon after appearing at a mass funeral in Soweto for Tambo, who {{had died of a}} stroke. In July 1993, both Mandela and de Klerk visited the US, independently meeting President Bill Clinton and each receiving the Liberty Medal. Soon after, Mandela and de Klerk were jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in Norway. Influenced by Thabo Mbeki, Mandela began meeting with big business figures, and played down his support for nationalisation, fearing that he would scare away much-needed foreign investment. Although criticised by socialist ANC members, he had been encouraged to embrace <b>private</b> <b>enterprise</b> by members of the Chinese and Vietnamese Communist parties at the January 1992 World Economic Forum in Switzerland.|$|E
