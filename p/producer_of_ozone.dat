One main <b>producer</b> <b>of</b> <b>ozone</b> is the photochemical reaction between volatile organic components and the anthropogenic nitrogen oxides created by vehicular traffic. Therefore the measurement and monitoring of atmospheric ozone concentration levels is important. In this {{paper we propose a}} study of the use of state-of-the-art machine learning approaches in modelling the concentration of ground level ozone. The prediction is based on concentrations of seven gases (NO 2, SO 2, and BTX (Benzene, Toluene, o-,m-,p-Xylene) and six meteorological parameters (ambient temperature, air pressure, wind speed, wind direction, global radiation, and relative humidity). The analysis of the results indicates that accurate models for the concentration of ground level ozone can be derived with the best performance accuracies indicated by the Ensemble Learning Algorithms. The investigation carried out compares the use of different machine learning classifiers and show that the Ensembleclassifier Bagging performs superior to standard single classifiers, such as Artificial Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines, popularly used in literature. In addition, we study the performance of the meta-classifier Bagging when different base classifiers are used in optimised configurations and compare the results thus obtained. The research conducted bridges an existing research gap in big-data analytics related to environment pollution prediction, where present research is largely limited to using standard learning algorithms such as Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines often available within popular commercial software packages...|$|E

40|$|Low-level ozone {{pollution}} affects crop yields adversely. Reduction <b>of</b> <b>ozone</b> pollution would therefore increase crop yields and provide economic benefits to <b>producers</b> and consumers <b>of</b> farm products.

Exposure-response functions were used to estimate initial yield responses when {{ozone pollution}} is reduced to natural background levels. These yield responses were fed into a spatial economic model of the Dutch farm sector, thereby allowing for demand and supply adjustments in all interrelated markets. A novelty in this analysis is the explicit attention to crop-livestock interactions.

40|$|SUMMARY: The {{bactericidal}} effects <b>of</b> <b>ozone</b> solutions {{were tested}} against Escherichia coli suspensions at lo, and the lethal concentration {{was found to}} be that quantity <b>of</b> <b>ozone</b> necessary to produce a detectable residue in the suspension; under the conditions of our experiments this was 04 - 0 - 5 mg. /l. A comparison of the bactericidal activity of chlorine under similar conditions emphasized the different modes of action of the two agents. Quantitative studies on the antibacterial activity <b>of</b> <b>ozone</b> are difficult because of the instability <b>of</b> <b>ozone</b> solutions. The decomposition <b>of</b> <b>ozone</b> in solution is described as occurring in a stepwise fashion, producing in turn hydroperoxyl and hydroxyl radicles (Adler & Hill, 1950), both of which exhibit considerable biological activity. The decomposition process is temperature dependent and is catalysed by hydroxyl ion (Adler & Hill, 1950; Stumm, 1954). The usual process <b>of</b> bubbling <b>ozone</b> through a bacterial suspension and then measuring the total oxidizing residue iodometrically fails to give an accurate determination of the amount <b>of</b> <b>ozone</b> present.
