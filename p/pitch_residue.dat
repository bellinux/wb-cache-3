40|$|The paper {{presents}} the research {{results of the}} first effect of pitch shift in three-component inharmonic complexes. The appearance of this effect {{is the most important}} evidence that the difference tone introduced by the nonlinearity of a hearing system does not influence residual pitch perception in three-component complexes. The subjects in the adjustment procedure matched the three-component complexes pitch to the same sensation produced by pure tone. The subjects listened to three components, the harmonics of 200 Hz, which were equally shifted in the frequency domain. A 30 Hz shift was applied. The frequency range was 630 – 4430. The hearing experiments reveal the existence of the threshold of the appearance of the virtual pitch corresponding near to F 1 = 200 Hz. These results are explained using the pitch perception models based on the Licklider duplex theory and Terhardt’s pitch algorithm.

40|$|Pitches are {{important}} precursors for carbon materials. They are usually obtained by thermal treatment of petroleum and coal fractions. Pitches have higher carbon content and {{are capable of}} developing into graphitisable carbons upon heat treatment. Petroleum pitches are generally less aromatic than coal tar pitches. Medium-temperature gasifier pitch (MTP), from Sasol’s Lurgi process, is a potential precursor for graphitisable carbon. MTP showed {{a high degree of}} solubility in several organic solvents, namely dimethylformamide, quinoline, tetrahydrofuran, pyridine, morpholine, benzene, toluene, xylene and acetone. It was virtually insoluble in n-hexane, cyclohexane, cyclohexanol, acetonitrile and formamide. MTP pitch was partially soluble in methanol and had a solubility limit of 40 g/l at ambient temperature. MTP samples were spiked with boron to make 1000 ppm B-containing samples. The boron distribution coefficient was defined as the ratio of the boron contents of the insoluble <b>pitch</b> <b>residue</b> to the methanol-soluble pitch extracts, using a mass balance. This justified the decision to define the apparent boron partition coefficients based on the boron content of the recovered pitch residues. 4 -(dibenzofuranyl) boronic acid (DBA), 2 phenoxyphenyl boronic acid (PBA), p-tolylboronic acid (TBA) and phenylboronic acid (PLA) were retained the most in the residues after methanol extraction. Over 500 ppm of PBA, TBA and PLA were retained in the pitch residues following methanol extraction. The results showed that methanol extracted substituted boron acid model compounds. Methanol dissolved mostly low molecular mass/aliphatic species, which are not important for graphitisation. The thermomechanical analysis (TMA) results showed that MTP has a low softening point compared with the methanol-insoluble (MI) fractions. The attenuated total reflectance (ATR) results showed that the benzene-insoluble (BI), toluene-insoluble (TI) and MI fractions had more intense aromatic C–H stretching peaks than their corresponding soluble fractions. Elemental analysis and the solid-state 13 C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) results revealed that the benzene-, toluene- and methanol-insoluble fractions are more aromatic than their corresponding soluble fractions. The order of the aromaticity index for the insoluble fractions was as follows: MTP<MI<TI<BI. Matrix-assisted laser desorption (MALDI) analysis of the mass distribution revealed that the majority of compounds in MTP and its soluble and insoluble fractions were in the low molecular mass range, i. e. 190 – 388 atomic mass units. The thermal analysis results showed that the benzene-, toluene- and methanol-insoluble fractions were thermally stable and had higher carbon yields than their corresponding soluble fractions. MTP was thermally more stable than the methanol-, toluene- and benzene-soluble fractions. Evaluation of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) showed that the methanol-insoluble fractions had lower PAH contents than MTP and MI.   CopyrightDissertation (MSc) [...] University of Pretoria, 2012.

40|$|A {{fundamental}} {{attribute of}} human hearing {{is the ability}} to extract a <b>residue</b> <b>pitch</b> from harmonic complex sounds such as those produced by musical instruments and the human voice. However, the neural mechanisms that underlie this processing are unclear, as are the locations of these mechanisms in the auditory pathway. The ability to extract a <b>residue</b> <b>pitch</b> corresponding to the fundamental frequency from individual harmonics, even when the fundamental component is absent, has been demonstrated separately for conventional pitches and for Huggins pitch (HP), a stimulus without monaural pitch information. HP is created by presenting the same wideband noise to both ears, except for a narrowband frequency region where the noise is decorrelated across the two ears. The present study investigated whether <b>residue</b> <b>pitch</b> can be derived by combining a component derived solely from binaural interaction (HP) with a spectral component for which no binaural processing is required. Fifteen listeners indicated which of two sequentially presented sounds was higher in pitch. Each sound consisted of two "harmonics," which independently could be either a spectral or a HP component. Component frequencies were chosen such that the relative pitch judgement revealed whether a <b>residue</b> <b>pitch</b> was heard or not. The results showed that listeners were equally likely to perceive a <b>residue</b> <b>pitch</b> when one component was dichotic and the other was spectral as when the components were both spectral or both dichotic. This suggests that there exists a single mechanism for the derivation of <b>residue</b> <b>pitch</b> from binaurally created components and from spectral components, and that this mechanism operates at or after the level of the dorsal nucleus of the lateral lemniscus (brainstem) or the inferior colliculus (midbrain), which receive inputs from the medial superior olive where temporal information from the two ears is first combined...|$|R

Tone languages put greater pitch processing demands on their speakers than non-tone languages, and we investigated whether these lifelong differences in linguistic pitch processing affect listeners' bias for <b>residue</b> <b>pitch.</b> We asked native tone language speakers and native English speakers to perform a pitch judgment task for two tones with missing fundamental frequencies. Given tone pairs with ambiguous pitch changes, listeners were asked to judge the direction of pitch change, where the direction of their response indicated whether they attended to the overall spectrum (exhibiting a spectral bias) or the missing f 0 (exhibiting a fundamental bias). We found that tone language speakers are significantly more likely to perceive pitch changes based on the missing f 0 than English speakers.

The Universities of Siena and Florence carried out the study of the materials recovered during the excavation. The excavation concerned an area between the south roman wall and the Arno river, where the earlier occupation is dated to the late Antiquity (4 th century). Between the 5 th and the 7 th century a natural depression of the ground was filled up with the city’s rubbish and alluvial layers. Only few post-holes and a dyke testify the use of the area in this period. Among the materials recovered during the excavations, some amphorae were found, that allowed to think about the diffusion of goods in the city during Late Antiquity and High Middle Ages. Some of these amphorae were chosen to be analyzed in order to know their content, and therefore, the goods that they transported. They were mainly Late Roman 1, two Late Roman 5 / 6, one “Empoli amphora” and a probable variant of Late Roman 3. The results of the analyses, carried out at the University of Siena, show that the “Empoli amphora” and some Late Roman 1 possibly contained wine, while the two Late Roman 5 / 6 do not show any trace of content.

The timely analysis and characterization of white pitch deposit is important for tracing {{the origin of the}} deposits. Despite the severity of problem of white pitch deposits, there is little information on analysis of these contaminants. Gas chromatography (GC), size exclusion chromatography (SEC), proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (¹H-NMR), and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) were used to separate the complex constituents and identify the functional groups of the white pitch deposits. GC analysis based on retention time allowed to determine paraffin wax, polyethylene wax, wood <b>pitch</b> <b>residues,</b> and certain additives such as rosin. Hot-melt adhesives and cis- 1, 4 -polyisoprene were separated by SEC based on molecular weight and verified by FTIR and ¹H-NMR. By using instrumental analysis technique can analyze the complex white pitch deposits and trace the origin of those. Grafting of synthetic polymers onto cellulose and its derivatives is a useful way to improve their qualities and to expand the range of their uses. To date there are a few useful reaction schemes to prepare for the new classes of materials with the advantages of both material. Most of the proposed grafting reactions are carried out by free radical mechanisms. But these procedures have some inherent disadvantages. So in this study acylation reaction mechanism was adopted to achieve a high level of control compared to free radical reactions over the grafting reaction.

The present study tried to replicate this result, and investigated the role of the presence of the nominally mistuned harmonic in the matching sound. Subjects adjusted a "matching" sound so that its pitch equaled that of a subsequent 90 -ms complex tone (12 harmonics of a 155 -Hz F 0), whose mistuned (± 3 %) third harmonic was presented either simultaneously with or after the remaining harmonics. In experiment 1, the matching sound was a harmonic complex whose third harmonic was either present or absent. In experiments 2 A and 2 B, the target and matching sound had nonoverlapping spectra. Pitch shifts were reduced both when the mistuned component was nonsimultaneous, and when the third harmonic was absent in the matching sound. The results indicate a shorter than originally estimated time window for obligatory integration of nonsimultaneous components into a virtual pitch...|$|R

The third or the fourth harmonic was mistuned. For both harmonics, pitch shifts were significantly smaller when the mistuned harmonic was presented after rather than simultaneously with {{the remainder of the}} target complex and when the component corresponding to the mistuned harmonic was absent (as opposed to present) from the matching sound. Presenting the mistuned component after the remainder of the complex generally reduced the pitch shifts more for the third than for the fourth harmonic; the nonsimultaneous presentation reduced shifts by a factor of 2. 8 (third) and 1. 7 (fourth) in the presence, and 6. 4 (third) and 1. 9 (fourth) {{in the absence of the}} nominally mistuned harmonic from the matching sound.

40|$|A new {{definition}} of musical pitch is proposed. A Finite-Difference Time Domain (FDTM) {{model of the}} cochlea {{is used to calculate}} spike trains caused by tone complexes and by a recorded classical guitar tone. All harmonic tone complexes, musical notes, show a narrow-band Interspike Interval (ISI) pattern at the respective fundamental frequency of the tone complex. Still this fundamental frequency is not only present at the bark band holding the respective best frequency of this fundamental frequency, but rather at all bark bands driven by the tone complex partials. This is caused by drop-outs in the basically regular, periodic spike train in the respective bands. These drop-outs are caused by the energy distribution in the wave form, where time spans of low energy are not able to drive spikes. The presence of the fundamental periodicity in all bark bands can be interpreted as pitch. Contrary to pitch, timbre is represented as a wide distribution of different ISIs over bark bands. The definition of pitch is shown to also works with <b>residue</b> <b>pitches.</b> The spike drop-outs in times of low energy of the wave form also cause undertones, integer multiple subdivisions in periodicity, but in no case overtones can appear.

Most of the previous works on catalyzing mesophase formation have focused on either minimizing {{the impact of the}} retained catalyst or on recovering the catalyst from the product. In our previous paper [9], we have used cobalt and nickel salts in petroleum residues (paraffinic clarified oil and aromatic heavy extract) to enhance the mesophase contents, pitch yields and other physico-chemical properties. Among these petroleum residue paraffinic clarified oil having very low bureau of mines correlation index (BMCI), i.e., 51 is produced a pitch contained mesophase contents below countable limit and pitch yield being quite low (11.88 wt %). Although, the presence of transition metal salts (Co and Ni) in paraffinic clarified oil enlarged the size of mesophase spheres, i.e., increased the mesophase contents, pitch yield and other physico–chemical properties. Here, the recovery of catalysts has done by refluxing higher-density part of pitch which was settled down bottom of the reactor with ethanol. As we know that mesophase pitches are used as a precursor material for premium-quality petroleum coke. This premium-quality petroleum coke is used for making graphite electrode for steel industries. Most of the premium-quality petroleum coke in India is imported from foreign countries for making graphite electrode and other carbon products. Keeping this in view, we are trying to explore different types of transition metal catalysts which enhance the mesophase formation in paraffinic clarified oil. This study will help petroleum refiners for production of mesophase pitch/premium-quality petroleum coke.|$|R
40|$|Theoretical and {{experimental}} evidence for non-linear hydrogen bonds in protein helices is ubiquitous. In particular, amide three-centered hydrogen bonds are common features of helices in high-resolution crystal structures of proteins. These high-resolution structures (1. 0 to 1. 5 Å nominal crystallographic resolution) position backbone atoms without significant bias from modeling constraints and identify Φ = - 62 °, ψ = - 43 as the consensus backbone torsional angles of protein helices. These torsional angles preserve the atomic positions of α-β carbons {{of the classic}} Pauling α-helix while allowing the amide carbonyls to form bifurcated hydrogen bonds as first suggested by Némethy et al. in 1967. Molecular dynamics simulations of a capped 12 -residue oligoalanine in water with AMOEBA (Atomic Multipole Optimized Energetics for Biomolecular Applications), a second-generation force field that includes multipole electrostatics and polarizability, reproduces the experimentally observed high-resolution helical conformation and correctly reorients the amide-bond carbonyls into bifurcated hydrogen bonds. This simple modification of backbone torsional angles reconciles experimental and theoretical views to provide a unified view of amide three-centered hydrogen bonds as crucial components of protein helices. The reason why they have been overlooked by structural biologists depends on the small crankshaft-like changes in orientation of the amide bond that allows maintenance of the overall helical parameters (helix <b>pitch</b> (p) and <b>residues</b> per turn (n)). The Pauling 3. 6 (13) α-helix fits the high-resolution experimental data with the minor exception of the amide-carbonyl electron density, but the previously associated backbone torsional angles (Φ, Ψ) needed slight modification to be reconciled with three-atom centered H-bonds and multipole electrostatics. Thus, a new standard helix, the 3. 6 (13 / 10) -, Némethy- or N-helix, is proposed.

40|$|Theories of pitch perception, and {{the related}} literature, are reviewed, with special {{reference}} to the <b>residue</b> <b>pitch</b> of tonal complexes. A distinction is drawn between spectral-pattern theories, which propose that pitch is derived from independent internal estimates of component frequency, and periodicity theories, which propose that the pitch of tonal complexes may be derived from a residual periodicity resulting from an incomplete auditory frequency analysis. The Spectral-pattern models described by Goldstein (1973) and Wightman (1973 b) are discussed in detail; computer simulation procedures, allowing the prediction of a probability density function for the estimated fundamental frequency of a tonal complex, are described for each. Contrasting predictions concerning the relation between component frequency discrimination and fundamental frequency discrimination for harmonic complexes are developed for the spectral-pattern and periodicity theories. Component frequency and fundamental frequency discrimination by human observers was measured, {{under a variety of}} conditions, for a complex containing the 4 th and 5 th harmonics of 200 Hz. For a comparison of the pitches of two such complexes of slightly different frequency, the relative fundamental frequency difference limen was no larger, and generally smaller, than the smaller relative component frequency difference limen. Discrimination performance was interpreted in terms of a modified version of Goldstein's (1973) spectral-pattern theory, in which an internal noise limits discrimination between signals with non-coincident components. Further experiments investigated the identification of fundamental frequency by human observers {{as a function of the}} variability of internal estimates of component frequency as estimated from the discrimination experiments. The results of these experiments were consistent with the predictions of the spectral-pattern theories.

40|$|An {{experiment}} was carried out, investigating {{the relationship between}} the just noticeable difference of fundamental frequency (jndf 0) of three stationary synthesized vowel sounds in noise and the signal-to-noise ratio. To this end the S/N ratios were measured at which listeners could just discriminate a series of changes in ?f 0 in the range from 10 % to 0. 5 %. Similar measurements were obtained for pulse trains and for pure tones as a reference for the results. A measure of S/N ratio based on an approximation of the critical bandwidth appeared to provide a fairly good predictor of the masked threshold of each signal, measured in a second experiment. Using this measure, it was found that a given change in the fundamental of a pulse train could be discriminated at a lower S/N ratio than in a pure tone with a frequency equal to that fundamental. The results for the vowel sounds were found to be in between those for a low-frequency pure tone and those for a pulse train. Owing to the signal-generation method (viz., changing ?f 0 by changing the sampling frequency), three cues could in principle be used to discriminate a change in the fundamental of a vowel: A change in the <b>residue</b> <b>pitch,</b> a change in the pitch of a single prominent harmonic, or a change in the spectral envelope of the signal. It can be inferred from the results that the subjects used that particular cue which yielded best performance. Which cue was optimal depended not only on the vowel but also on ?f 0 and on the presented change in ?f 0. It seems, however, that the pitch of a single harmonic was the cue most often used. Another interesting result is that changes in ?f 0 greater than about 5 %, could for each signal be discriminated when the signal was just above masked threshold...|$|R
