The wild, grief-stricken Shiva wandered the universe with her half-burnt corpse. Finally, Vishnu dismembered her body into 51 parts, each of which fell on different <b>places</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> earth, each creating a Shakti Pitha.|$|E

5|$|The {{chessboard}} {{on the top}} of {{the cabinet}} was thin enough to allow for a magnetic linkage. Each piece in the chess set had a small, strong magnet attached to its base, and when they were placed on the board the pieces would attract a magnet attached to a string under their specific <b>places</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> board. This allowed the director inside the machine to see which pieces moved where on the chess board. The bottom of the chessboard had corresponding numbers, 1–64, allowing the director to see which <b>places</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> board were affected by a player's move. The internal magnets were positioned in a way that outside magnetic forces did not influence them, and Kempelen would often allow a large magnet to sit at the side of the board in an attempt to show that the machine was not influenced by magnetism.|$|E

5|$|All nemerteans move slowly, {{using their}} {{external}} cilia {{to glide on}} surfaces on a trail of slime, while larger species use muscular waves to crawl, and some swim by dorso-ventral undulations. A few live in the open ocean while the rest find or make hiding <b>places</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bottom. About a dozen species inhabit freshwater, mainly in the tropics and subtropics, and another dozen species live on land in cool, damp places. Most nemerteans are carnivores, feeding on annelids, clams and crustaceans. A few species are scavengers, and a few species live commensally inside the mantle cavity of molluscs. Some species have devastated commercial fishing of clams and crabs. Nemerteans have few predators. Two species are sold as fish bait.|$|E

As of 2015, the majority of West Virginia's plantation houses remain under private ownership.|$|E
5|$|John {{consolidated}} his conquests and {{the existing}} Byzantine holdings in Asia by {{the building of}} a series of forts. Historian Paul Magdalino explains this process in his book The empire of Manuel Komnenos by placing {{it in the context of}} the Komnenian restoration of the Byzantine empire as a whole; he points out that while John's father Alexios had fortified <b>places</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> coast, John now expanded Byzantine control into the interior by fortifying places such as Lopadion, Achyraous and Laodicea, which guarded the approaches to the valleys and coastlands of Asia Minor. This restoration of order under John enabled agricultural prosperity to begin a recovery that would eventually restore these war torn regions to their former status as a productive and valuable part of the Byzantine empire.|$|E
