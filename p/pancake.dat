5|$|A <b>pancake</b> {{machine is}} an electrically-powered machine that {{automatically}} produces cooked pancakes. It {{is believed that}} the earliest known <b>pancake</b> machine was invented in the United States in 1928. Several types of <b>pancake</b> machines exist that perform in various manners, for both commercial and home use. Some are fully automatic in operation, while others are semi-automatic. Some companies mass-produce <b>pancake</b> machines, and some have been homemade. The Happy Egg Company constructed a novelty <b>pancake</b> machine in 2013 in commemoration of <b>Pancake</b> Day in the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Various {{types of}} <b>pancake</b> {{machines}} exist, {{such as those}} that run <b>pancake</b> batter through a heated conveyor inside of a box unit, and those that automatically drop <b>pancake</b> batter onto a flattop grill. Some <b>pancake</b> machines, such as one developed by Crepe-Coer, cook both sides of a <b>pancake</b> simultaneously. Semi-automatic <b>pancake</b> machines also exist, which require some human interaction to function, such as the pouring of batter. Commercial <b>pancake</b> machines may be used in the foodservice industry, in cafeterias and by restaurants, and can serve to reduce the waste of stale <b>pancake</b> batter. Some hotels have <b>pancake</b> machines that guests are allowed to operate. They are also used in other environments in a self-service manner, such as in upscale airport lounges and hotels.|$|E
5|$|Homemade {{versions}} of <b>pancake</b> machines have been constructed. An {{example of a}} homemade <b>pancake</b> machine is one constructed in 1977 by Ken Whitsett of the Ocala Kiwanis Club in Ocala, Florida, which {{was used for the}} organization's annual <b>pancake</b> day. The Kiwanis machine utilized a hopper filled with <b>pancake</b> batter that was manually dropped onto a revolving griddle. The pancakes were manually flipped and plated when cooking was completed. It required four people for its operation, and could produce between 750–1000 pancakes per hour.|$|E

5|$|In 1928, {{a man in}} Portland, Oregon, invented an {{electric}} <b>pancake</b> machine that operated {{by the process of}} batter being dropped onto a revolving heated flattop grill from a storage cylinder atop the grill. The grill was heated using electricity. The amount of batter dropped was controlled by using controlled amounts of compressed air, which pushed batter out of the storage cylinder. As the batter revolved on the hot grill, the <b>pancake</b> was flipped halfway through the cooking process by a shelf atop the grill. After being flipped, the completed <b>pancake</b> was ejected from the machine upon contact with a gate.|$|E

50|$|<b>Pancakes</b> (also called Scotch <b>pancakes</b> or Scottish <b>pancakes)</b> {{are more}} like the American type. In parts of Scotland they are also {{referred}} to as drop scones or dropped scones. They are made from flour, eggs, sugar, buttermilk or milk, salt, bicarbonate of soda and cream of tartar.

5|$|In {{commemoration}} of <b>Pancake</b> Day in the United Kingdom, a novelty <b>pancake</b> machine {{was built by}} The Happy Egg Company in February 2013 that involved a complex series of steps to automatically produce pancakes from scratch. The machine {{involves the use of}} a freshly laid egg from a hen that rolls onto a turntable, which then moves the egg to an area where it is automatically cracked and mixed with other ingredients. After this point, the mixture is poured into a griddle, flipped to cook the other side, and then flipped onto a plate.|$|E

50|$|In {{the monarchy}} period, elder {{members of a}} family would offer <b>pancakes</b> flavored with sugar as sacrifices to Confucius when their {{children}} reached school age.

The elder generation gave those <b>pancakes</b> to their children to eat after offering them to Confucius for blessings. As the Chinese pronunciation of “scallion” {{is the same as}} “clever” (‘cong’), it symbolizes that their children would become cleverer after eating those <b>pancakes.</b> The candy and coconut wrap is still famous in China as an inexpensive snack.|$|R
5|$|After {{talks of}} closure for years, Wayzata Bay Center closed its doors on August 15, 2011. Demolition began shortly after in April 2012, when all {{stores in the}} mall had either {{relocated}} or closed. The Original <b>Pancake</b> House, a restaurant, was the final tenant to close in the mall. The restaurant, a tenant of the center since 1994, relocated to neighboring Plymouth, while Adele's Frozen Custard, a tenant in the mall since 2009, closed their Wayzata location entirely. Among the mall's other final tenants were a True Value hardware store, a jewelry store, a health food store, and a furniture store.|$|E

The mall initially featured several regional retailers, along with small businesses, but eventually made way for various national chains, including The Original <b>Pancake</b> House and True Value. After increasing vacancies throughout the center in the 2000s, a Minnesota construction firm purchased the center from United Properties for $16 million in 2009. Following the firm's purchase in 2011, the mall was shut and torn down {{to make way for}} a mixed-use retail and residential community center.|$|E

After stopping to fill the car with gas, the King starts it and, from inexperience, accidentally runs it backward over a policeman, who is squashed flat as a <b>pancake.</b> The King starts inflating him with a pump, and then, to save time, lets other onlookers finish the job while he drives off.
