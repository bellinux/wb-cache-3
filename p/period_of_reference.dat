40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyze the {{evolution}} of poverty in the 15 countries of E. U., whose household income data is available through the information contained in the European Community Household Panel (ECHP). Several indicators have been proposed in economic literature for measuring poverty, but they may produce different orderings when cases are compared. In this work, a set of poverty one-dimensional indicators are chosen, which best verify some desirable properties. A modification of the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is proposed to calculate synthetic cross-sectional measures of poverty using this set of indicators. In order to obtain comparable values throughout time, in addition to cross-sectional sense, joint consideration of single poverty indicators is proposed, independently of their temporary <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>reference.</b> Therefore, applying common space analysis to these cross-sectional synthetic measures, a common frame of comparison and a homogeneous weighting structure are obtained, which are stable throughout time. This powerful tool allows static as well as dynamic comparisons, among the EU countries. Furthermore, the determination of groups of countries according to their characteristics in poverty will be accomplished. ...|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, I explore if Latvia has experienced, {{during the}} last ten years, a change in {{identity}} and threat perception that could allow for {{the building of a}} “cooperative security community” in Northern Europe. Recent constructivist researches contend that such change is in progress in neighboring Estonia. This research, performed through a discourse analysis of political elite’s speeches, reveals the presence – explained by the concept of interim inconsequentiality - of two opposite identity/security discourses. I link the first, inclusive, discourse to Latvia’s Western socialization, but not to a change in identity, as I contend that both threat images and identity have been instrumentalized {{for the sake of the}} accession strategy. As for the second, exclusionary, discourse that shows a persistent distrust of both Russia and the ethnic Russian minorities, and is the more prevalent in terms of political behavior, I link it to Latvia’s identity as a small ethnic nation vulnerable to external pressures - an identity strengthened during the period by Russia’s behavior. I verify this thesis by exposing the exclusionary discourse’s salience on the EU integration issue. I conclude that the <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>reference,</b> far from resolving the security dilemma, has, on the contrary, reinforced it...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAn {{exceptional}} flood event, accompanying {{a marine}} storm, was investigated simultaneously {{at the entrance}} and the exit of the Gulf of Lion's hydrosystem (NW Mediterranean) in December 2003. Cs, Cr, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd and Pb signatures of both riverine and shelf-exported particles indicate that continental inputs and resuspended prodeltaic sediments were intensively mixed with resuspended sediments from middle/outer shelf areas during advective transport. As a result, particles leaving the Gulf of Lion inherited the mean signature of shelf bottom sediments, exporting anthropogenic Pb and Zn {{out into the open}} sea. When assessing the particulate metal budget in relation with the event, it appears that the output fluxes accounted for between 15 % and 60 % of the input fluxes, depending on the element and the <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>reference.</b> This trend is also observed for annual budgets, which were drawn up by compiling the data from this study and the literature.

Regarding anthropogenic fluxes, the contribution of the oceanic flood of December 2003 to the mean annual scenario is considerable.

40|$|Background: Large-scale {{mental health}} surveys have {{provided}} invaluable {{information regarding the}} prevalence of specific mental disorders and service use for mental health reasons. Unfortunately, because vast surveys conducted face to face are very costly, many countries and provinces do not embark upon this path of research, thus depriving themselves of {{a rich source of}} data useful for service planning. Method: As an alternative, the authors undertook a telephone survey with a sample of 893 residents from a Montreal catchment area. Mental disorders were assessed by the Composite International Diagnostic Interview Simplified (CIDIS), an instrument especially designed to be used in mail or telephone surveys. Service utilization was measured by an instrument similar to those used in recent large Canadian or American surveys. Results: The prevalence rate for any mental disorder was lower in this study than in some large-scale epidemiological surveys reviewed. This could be explained by methodological differences, such as number of disorders covered and <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>reference.</b> With regard to specific mental disorders, results appeared very similar to those of other studies. Concerning service utilization, rates tended to be higher than in other studies, and this finding could reflect real differences between Quebec and other Canadian provinces or the United States. Conclusions: Aside from being lower in cost, telephone surveys can yield results comparable to those obtained in large-scale epidemiological surveys conducted by means of face-to-face interviews...|$|E

The procedure permits that the waveform dispersion to be obtained as a continuous period-dependent velocity function at grid points belonging to the area probed by the waves, thus providing phase- and group-velocity contour maps for several periods within the interval of interest. The regionalization process rests on a homogeneous initial data set in which the number of observations remains almost constant for all <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>reference.</b> Damped least-squares inversion of the local dispersion curves for shear-wave velocity structure is performed to obtain depth-dependent S-wave velocity profiles at the grid points covering the model region.

On this basis, we have built horizontal depth sections that give an updated view of the seismic velocity structure of the peninsula at lithospheric and upper mantle depths (20 – 200  km).

The method was designed to estimate the intakes of total and saturated fat, cholesterol, and animal protein during a usual week before symptoms or diagnosis of disease in cases, and during a usual recent week in controls. Except for the time <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>reference,</b> the dietary technique was identical for all cases and controls. A subsample of 6 1 Japanese women (19 cases and 42 controls) and 56 Caucasian women (23 cases and 33 controls) participated in the dietary reinterview conducted within 3 months of the first interview. The mean difference in intake between the two interviews was small and not statistically significant (p> 0. 05) for all four nutrient items among Japanese cases and controls and Caucasian cases, whereas the mean difference for all four nutrients was substantial and statistically significant (p < 0. 05) among the Caucasian controls. The intraclass correlation and the product-moment correlation were moderately high for all four nutrient items among lapanese cases and controls and Caucasian cases, but not among Caucasian controls. These findings indicate that the diet history method is reasonably reproducible in three of the four groups of studied subjects. Possible reasons for the poor reproducibility among Caucasian controls are discussed. Am...|$|E

40|$|In {{this article}} we {{describe}} an innovative multi-model system developed within the CIRCE	EU-FP 6 Project and used to produce simulations of the Mediterranean Sea regional climate. 	The models include high-resolution Mediterranean Sea components, which allow to assess the	role of the basin, and in particular of the air-sea feedbacks in the climate of the region. 	The models have been integrated from 1951 to 2050, using observed radiative forcings during	the {{first half of the}} simulation period and the IPCC SRES A 1 B scenario during the second	half. 	The projections show a substantial warming (about 1. 5 °- 2 °C) and a significant decrease of	precipitation (about 5 %) in the region for the scenario period. However, locally the changes	might be even larger. In the same period, the projected surface net heat loss decreases, leading	to a weaker cooling of the Mediterranean Sea by the atmosphere, whereas the water budget	appears to increase, leading the basin to loose more water through its surface than in the past. 	These results are overall consistent with the findings of previous scenario simulations, such as	PRUDENCE, ENSEMBLES and CMIP 3. The agreement suggests that these findings are	robust to substantial changes in the configuration of the models used to make the simulations.
