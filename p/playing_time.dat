40|$|Sports-related {{concussion}} and {{its subsequent}} management {{have become a}} top priority within the sports medicine research spectrum. In order to properly understand the complex nature of concussion management, multiple aspects of the injury were explored including the psychobiological nature of the injury, risk for further injury, diagnostic concerns, and return to play decision making. While much research has been dedicated to these areas, one in particular, return to play, {{is the focus of}} this current research study. To date, {{there has not been a}} method for accurately predicting return to <b>play</b> <b>time</b> after an athlete has sustained sports-related concussion. In order to advance the understanding of return to play and the clinical management of concussion, the current study applied a unique statistical methodology to empirically develop an equation to predict average return to <b>play</b> <b>time</b> using a set of post-injury variables. This equation predicted average return to <b>play</b> <b>time</b> with significant accuracy and resulted in a strong correlation between predicted return to <b>play</b> <b>time</b> and observed return to <b>play</b> <b>time.</b> Importantly, the predication equation was moderately stable across multiple samples. The results suggest that return to <b>play</b> <b>time</b> can be successfully predicted via a set of post-injury variables. Thus, the understanding of concussion severity as well as the clinical management of the injury can be improved by providing clinicians with a better estimate of the length of time an athlete will be unable to participate in a given activity before full recovery...|$|R

5|$|Wade {{attended}} Harold L. Richards High School in Oak Lawn. Wade {{quickly found}} {{success as a}} wide receiver on the football team, but he needed to work extremely hard to earn <b>playing</b> <b>time</b> on the varsity basketball team during his junior year. While he did not acquire much <b>playing</b> <b>time</b> during his second year, his stepbrother, Demetris McDaniel, was {{the star of the}} team. Wade grew four inches in the summer before his junior year and saw an increase in <b>playing</b> <b>time,</b> averaging 20.7 points and 7.6 rebounds per game. The following year, Wade averaged 27.0 points and 11.0 rebounds per game while leading his team to a 24–5 record. It advanced to the title game of the Class AA Eisenhower Sectional. During this season he set school records for points (676) and steals (106) in a season. Wade has stated that his high school coach, Jack Fitzgerald, {{was one of the most}} positive influences in his life during this time. Wade was recruited by only three college basketball teams (Marquette University, Illinois State, and DePaul University) due to academic problems.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{increase}} knowledge and understanding of free play or free fun time importance for children of age around five years in preschool, in order to promote children’s development and learning. The focus was on exploring and better understanding of teacher’s and educators’ approach to the free fun <b>play</b> <b>time</b> as a tool in their educational work, and also about their own role in this context as well as analyzing of forms, rules and structures spontaneously created by groups of children having free <b>play</b> fun <b>time.</b> Another important moment of this study was to give more light on approaches to this issue in education theories by Piaget, Vygotsky and Freud among others. As to the practical experimental part of the study it has been performed at a preschool and kindergarten in a suburb at the outskirts of Stockholm, with four employed educators there and with groups of children of age around five. The main methods used were interviews with teachers and observation of the children during their free fun <b>play</b> <b>time.</b>    To summarize the most significant conclusions on the educators approach to the free fun <b>play</b> <b>time</b> it can be mentioned that some of them use the free fun play as educational tools for learning, they see upon that as a part of established education. Some approach the free <b>play</b> <b>time</b> as an important and necessary ingredient of children school time, but not as an official educational activity and method. All are positive to the free <b>play</b> <b>time</b> in the way that it contributes to children’s social competence, to development of their language skills and to their emotional and psychological development. They look upon their own role in this context of the free <b>play</b> fun <b>time</b> as inspiration giving, leading and regulating. Betyg...|$|R

Three days later, head coach Larry Krystkowiak and Harris met with Yi, attempting to influence him to play for Milwaukee, however, Yi's representatives requested that the team trade Yi to another team with a city that had a large Chinese presence.

5|$|Asche {{began the}} 2015 season among the team's hottest hitters, and a {{mainstay}} {{in the lineup}} as the team's starting third baseman. However, in late April, he began working on skills as an outfielder, ostensibly {{in preparation for the}} arrival of minor league prospect Maikel Franco, regarded as a stronger defensive third baseman. In fact, the Phillies optioned Asche back to Triple-A on May 12 to accelerate his development as a left fielder, as Franco was hitting very well in the minor leagues, and could be ready for a promotion. Although surprised and disappointed by the move, Asche sought to trust the organization and play wherever it needed him. Ultimately, Asche struggled to find <b>playing</b> <b>time</b> during the remainder of the season, although MLB.com writer Todd Zolecki said that Asche would be given an opportunity in 2016 as the Phillies like his makeup, but the burden will be on him to produce results to justify the <b>playing</b> <b>time,</b> given the amelioration of other options at his positions.|$|E

40|$|An {{assumption}} {{made when}} designing recess interventions in schools {{is that there}} is a clear demarcation between eating <b>time</b> and <b>play</b> <b>time.</b> We used observational data conducted as part of the Sydney Playground Project to test if this assumption was correct. The Sydney Playground Project is a cluster randomized controlled trial of a recess intervention. The SPP was conducted in 12 Sydney schools and involved 214 children aged 5 - 7 years. Analysis of the baseline behavioural observations revealed an average of 18. 5 % of children's free <b>play</b> <b>time</b> was spent eating. Twenty observations were used to explore the extent and nature of influence of eating on children's play. For most children, eating reduced their capacity to engage fully in play. Some children were socially isolated and unable to play while eating. A small number of children seemed not to be affected by their own eating, but were affected by their peers' eating. The results indicate that a substantial proportion of children's free <b>play</b> <b>time</b> can be lost to eating. Although the methods used do not allow us to make causal inferences, the present findings suggest that eating had a negative impact on quality and quantity of <b>play.</b> <b>Time</b> spent eating should be considered when estimating time children have for free play. Consideration should also be given to reducing the amount of free <b>play</b> <b>time</b> that can inadvertently be spent eating. 8 page(s...|$|R
