In 1570 <b>peace</b> <b>was</b> finally agreed when the Swedish king withdrew the claims to Danish Skåne, Halland, Blekinge and Gotland, while the Danes withdrew their claims to Sweden as a whole.|$|E
5|$|During the Vietnam War the Shrine {{became a}} centre of {{conflict}} when anti-war demonstrators protested during ANZAC Day services against Australia's {{involvement in the}} war.

5|$|Violence {{erupted in}} Baltimore on July 20, with police and {{soldiers}} of the Maryland National Guard clashing with crowds of thousands gathered throughout the city. In response, President Rutherford B.

5|$|A quick <b>peace</b> <b>was</b> {{essential}} to keep Russia {{from entering the}} conflict on Austria's side. Prussia annexed Hanover, Hesse-Kassel, Nassau, {{and the city of}} Frankfurt. Hesse Darmstadt lost some territory but not its sovereignty. The states south of the Main River (Baden, Württemberg, and Bavaria) signed separate treaties requiring them to pay indemnities and to form alliances bringing them into Prussia's sphere of influence. Austria, and most of its allies, were excluded from the North German Confederation.|$|E
5|$|At the 1991 Madrid Conference, Jordan {{agreed to}} {{negotiate}} a peace treaty sponsored by the US and the Soviet Union.

5|$|Baldwin IV sent Heraclius, Patriarch of Jerusalem, {{along with}} other bishops, and Raynald of Châtillon to Antioch to mediate. After preparatory {{negotiations}} with the envoys in Latakia, Bohemond and Aimery met in Antioch. Bohemond agreed to restore confiscated church property and Aimery lifted the interdict, but Bohemond's excommunication remained in force because he refused to return to Theodora. <b>Peace</b> <b>was</b> not fully restored, {{and the leaders of}} the opposition fled to Armenian Cilicia.|$|E
5|$|Belisarius {{returned}} to Constantinople with the Vandals' royal treasure and the captive Gelimer {{to enjoy a}} triumph, while Africa was formally restored to imperial rule as the praetorian prefecture of Africa. Imperial control scarcely reached beyond the old Vandal kingdom, however, and the Moorish tribes of the interior proved unwilling to accept imperial rule and soon rose up in rebellion. The new province was shaken by the wars with the Moors and military rebellions, {{and it was not}} until 548 that <b>peace</b> <b>was</b> restored and Roman government firmly established.|$|E
5|$|Between 2:00am and 3:00am on Sunday morning, July 22, the <b>peace</b> <b>was</b> again {{broken and}} fire alarms began to ring {{throughout}} the city. To the west, at the Mount Clare Shops of the B, a 37-car train of coal and oil {{had been set}} on fire. Police, firefighters, and thousands of citizens flocked to the scene. A contingent of 50 marines was dispatched to the area to provide assistance. The cars which had not yet caught fire were detached from those burning, {{and by the time}} the flames were extinguished between seven and nine cars had been burned. Between $11,000 and $12,000 in damage was sustained.|$|E

Later that year, the B agreed to a number of reforms: crewmen would not be called to work more than an hour before a train's departure, crews were to be paid a quarter of a day's pay if the train they were working was canceled, and passes were to be given for men working who had long layovers. In 1880, the B Employees Relief Association was established.|$|E

Sweden was accepted as sovereign in Swedish Livonia, Brandenburg was accepted as sovereign in Ducal Prussia, and John II Casimir withdrew his claims to the Swedish throne, though he was to retain the title for life. All occupied territories were restored to their pre-war sovereigns.|$|E

5|$|Fresh {{fears of}} {{invasion}} after 1544 prompted further work {{being carried out}} on the blockhouse by Sir Richard Lee, a prominent military engineer, although <b>peace</b> <b>was</b> declared the following year. It is uncertain exactly what shape the fort took; archaeological investigations suggest that it was probably D-shaped, two storeys tall, with a circular bastion facing the river; {{there would have been}} battery positions {{on either side of the}} main defences, and a more modern, angular bastion was added later on the landwards side. By 1546 the King's accountants estimated that £1,072 had been spent on building and developing the fortification.|$|E
5|$|In 1042 Grand Prince Yaroslav forced Duke Casimir of Poland {{to settle}} for a {{peaceful}} deal.

5|$|John Sigismund's rule {{began with}} his mother's death. Rather than {{adopting}} a new title, {{he continued to}} style himself rex electus (king-elect). Mihály Csáky, Christopher and Stephen Báthory, and his mother's other advisors continued to participate in state administration. John Sigismund sent envoys to Ferdinand to propose marriage with one of Ferdinand's daughters, but also to announce his claim to the parts of Hungary under Ferdinand's rule. His demands were rejected, but <b>peace</b> <b>was</b> preserved.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the {{invasion}} threat from France had passed and a lasting <b>peace</b> <b>was</b> made in 1558; government concerns {{shifted away from}} the south coast towards the Spanish threat to the south-west of England. By 1569, when Thomas Carew was serving as Hurst's captain, there were less than ten guns but the same size of garrison to that seven years before. His son, Sir Thomas Gorges, became captain in turn, and in 1593 he reported that the castle's gun platforms were in serious need of repair.|$|E
5|$|Military {{tensions}} between the two leaders immediately increased. Theobald mobilised his forces {{along the border with}} Touraine; Henry responded by attacking Chaumont in Blois in a surprise attack; he successfully took Theobald's castle in a notable siege. At the start of 1161 war seemed likely to spread across the region, until a fresh <b>peace</b> <b>was</b> negotiated at Fréteval that autumn, followed by a second peace treaty in 1162, overseen by Pope Alexander III. Despite this temporary halt in hostilities, Henry's seizure of the Vexin proved to be a second long-running dispute between him and the kings of France.|$|E
