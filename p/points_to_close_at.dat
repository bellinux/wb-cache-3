5000|$|According to William L. Silber [...] "The Emergency Banking Act of 1933, {{passed by}} Congress on March 9, 1933, {{three days after}} FDR {{declared}} a nationwide bank holiday, combined with the Federal Reserve's commitment to supply unlimited amounts of currency to reopened banks, created 100 percent deposit insurance. Much to everyone's relief, when the institutions reopened for business on March 13, 1933, depositors stood in line to return their stashed cash to neighborhood banks. Within two weeks, Americans had redeposited {{more than half of}} the currency that they had squirreled away before the bank suspension. The stock market registered its approval as well. On March 15, 1933, the first day of stock trading after the extended closure of Wall Street, the New York Stock Exchange recorded the largest one-day percentage price increase ever with the Dow Jones Industrial Average gaining 8.26 <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>close</b> <b>at</b> 62.10; a gain of 15.34 percent. With the benefit of hindsight, the nationwide Bank Holiday and the Emergency Banking Act of March, 1933, ended the bank runs that had plagued the Great Depression." ...|$|E
50|$|Marked {{by global}} {{instability}} and the Great Depression, the 1930s contended with several consequential European and Asian outbreaks of war, {{leading up to}} catastrophic World War II in 1939. Other conflicts during the decade which affected the stock market included the 1936-1939 Spanish Civil War, the 1935-1936 Second Italo-Abyssinian War, the Soviet-Japanese Border War of 1939 and the Second Sino-Japanese War from 1937. On top of that, the United States dealt with a painful recession in 1937 and 1938 which temporarily brought economic recovery to a halt. The largest one-day percentage gain in the index, 15.34%, happened on March 15, 1933, {{in the depths of}} the 1930s bear market when the Dow gained 8.26 <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>close</b> <b>at</b> 62.10. However, as a whole throughout the Great Depression, the Dow posted some of its worst performances, for a negative return during most of the 1930s for new and old stock market investors. For the decade, the Dow Jones average was down from 248.48 points at the beginning of 1930, to a stable level of 150.24 points at the end of 1939, a loss of about 40%.|$|E

50|$|After {{a one-day}} {{recovery}} on October 30, where the Dow regained an additional 28.40 points, or 12 percent, {{to close at}} 258.47, the market continued to fall, arriving at an interim bottom on November 13, 1929, with the Dow closing at 198.60. The market then recovered for several months, starting on November 14, with the Dow gaining 18.59 <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>close</b> <b>at</b> 217.28, and reaching a secondary closing peak (i.e., bear market rally) of 294.07 on April 17, 1930. The following year, the Dow embarked on another, much longer, steady slide from April 1931 to July 8, 1932, when it closed at 41.22—its lowest level of the 20th century, concluding an 89 percent loss rate {{for all of the}} market's stocks. For most of the 1930s, the Dow began slowly to regain the ground it lost during the 1929 crash and the three years following it, beginning on March 15, 1933, with the largest percentage increase of 15.34 percent, with the Dow Jones closing at 62.10, with an 8.26 point increase. The largest percentage increases of the Dow Jones occurred during the early and mid-1930s. In late 1937, there was a sharp dip in the stock market, but prices held well above the 1932 lows. The market would not return to the peak closing of September 3, 1929, until November 23, 1954.|$|E

In this paper, the harmonic sinc approximation is applied to two dimensional steady state heat conduction problems with singularities and semi-infinite domains and Dirichlet boundary conditions. The first problem consists of conduction in a square geometry and the second one was a semi-infinite medium with a rectangular cavity.

After correcting for tide heights and sea state effects, the two passes give calibration biases which are in agreement to within 26 cm and have a weighted mean of - 5. 69 + or - 0. 16 m for correcting altimeter measurements to the center-of-mass of the spacecraft (i. e., including the antenna tracking point correction). It was found impossible to reconcile the two calibration passes, {{as well as a}} set of altimeter crossovers {{in the middle of the}} GEOS- 3 calibration area, without allowing for a data time tag error.

Fish were fed once daily with extruded commercial pellets. Over a period of 8 days samples were taken before and after feeding <b>at</b> different sampling <b>points</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> or <b>at</b> the cages. The results showed that a drastic (up to 10 times) increase in different bacterial groups occurred inside the cages 10 min after feeding as well as occasionally in the surrounding water. Additional electron-microscopic observations of the bacterial biofilm on the cage nets revealed that a decrease (in comparison with the original number) in total bacteria on the net materials of 9. 5 up to 42. 8 % occurred after feeding. It was concluded that water mixing caused by frenzied swimming just before and during feeding caused a release of bacteria which were growing vigorously on the surfaces of the cage system. Since the pathogenity and hydrophobicity of bacteria are closely related, this process of redistribution of bacteria into the water column could constitute an important stress factor for fish, which could probably also {{have a negative effect}} on fish production...|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} ows {{generated by}} a source pulsating with constant frequency and advancing at constant horizontal speed are called ship-motion Green functions as {{they are involved in}} the kernel of integral equations established in the ship-motion problems, and include time-harmonic ows with forward speed and the special cases of Neumann-Kelvin steady ow (at zero frequency) and time-harmonic ows without forward speed. Further to an introductory treatise by Chen (1999) in the case of deep water, ship-motion Green functions in water of nite depth is considered here. Based on the formal decomposition of free-surface eects given by Noblesse & Chen (1995), the wave component (dominant in the far eld) of ship-motion Green functions expressed as a single integral along the dispersion curves dened in the Fourier plane by the dispersion relation is analyzed.

40|$|Objective: There {{is a high}} {{incidence}} of inflammation and metaplasia at the gastro-oesophageal junction (GOJ) in asymptomatic volunteers. Additionally, the majority of patients with GOJ adenocarcinomas have no history of reflux symptoms. We report the effects of waist belt and increased waist circumference (WC) on the physiology of the GOJ in asymptomatic volunteers. Design: 12 subjects with normal and 12 with increased WC, matched for age and gender were examined fasted and following a meal and with waist belts on and off. A magnet was clipped to the squamo-columnar junction (SCJ). Combined assembly of magnet-locator probe, 12 -channel pH catheter and 36 -channel manometer was passed. Results: The waist belt and increased WC were each associated with proximal displacement of SCJ within the diaphragmatic hiatus (relative to upper border of lower oesophageal sphincter (LOS), peak LOS pressure point and pressure inversion point, and PIP (all p&# 60; 0. 05). The magnitude of proximal migration of SCJ during transient LOS relaxations was reduced by 1. 6 – 2. 6  cm with belt on versus off (p= 0. 01) and in obese versus non-obese (p= 0. 04), consistent with its resting position being already proximally displaced.

40|$|Nuclear {{beta decay}} rates are an {{essential}} ingredient in simulations of the astrophysical r-process. Most of these rates still rely on theoretical modeling. However, modern radioactive ion-beam facilities have allowed to measure beta half lives of some nuclei on or <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the r-process path. These {{data indicate that}} r-process half lives are in general shorter than anticipated in the standard theoretical predictions based on the Finite Range Droplet Model (FRDM). The data have also served as important constraints for improved predictions of half lives based on continuum QRPA calculations {{on top of the}} energy-density functional theory. Although these calculations are yet limited to spherical nuclei, they include the important r-process waiting <b>point</b> nuclei <b>close</b> <b>to</b> and <b>at</b> the neutron magic numbers $N= 50, 82 $ and 126. We have studied the impact of these new experimental and theoretical half lives on r-process nucleosynthesis within the two astrophysical sites currently favored for the r process: the neutrino-driven wind from the freshly born neutron star in a supernova explosion and the ejecta of the merger of two neutron stars. We find that the, in general, shorter beta decay rates have several important effects on the dynamics of r-process nucleosynthesis. At first, the matter flow overcomes the waiting point nuclei faster enhancing matter transport to heavier nuclei. Secondly, the shorter half lives result also in a faster consumption of neutrons resulting in important changes of the conditions at freeze-out with consequences for the final r-process abundances. Besides these global effects on the r-process dynamics, the new half lives also lead to some local changes in the abundance distributions. Comment: 11 pages, 7 figures, submitted to PR...|$|R
