It was subsequently placed as a noble gas in the middle of several spiral representations of the <b>periodic</b> <b>system</b> for classifying the chemical elements.|$|E
40|$|A {{large number}} of results from linear time {{invariant}} system theory can be extended to <b>periodic</b> <b>systems</b> provided an equivalent time invariant system can be found. This problem has been well investigated for <b>periodic</b> <b>systems</b> which have a standard state space representation. This paper presents a numerical procedure {{to achieve the same}} for descriptor <b>periodic</b> <b>systems</b> with possibly singular descriptor matrix, in which case the monodromy matrix is not defined.

To carry out this application, time-varying w transformation representation of sampled <b>periodic</b> <b>systems</b> are first introduced.

25|$|Within a year it {{was noted}} that the {{equation}} for the relation could be explained in terms of the 1913 Bohr model, with reasonable extra assumptions about atomic structure in other elements. Moseley's result, by Bohr's later account, not only established atomic number as a measurable experimental quantity, but gave it a physical meaning as the positive charge on the atomic nucleus (number of protons). The elements could be ordered in the <b>periodic</b> <b>system</b> in order of atomic number, rather than atomic weight. The result tied together the organization of the periodic table, the Bohr model for the atom, and Rutherford's model for alpha scattering from nuclei. It was cited by Rutherford, Bohr, and others as a critical advance in understanding the nature of the atomic nucleus.|$|E

2500|$|Direct {{contact is}} rare in this route for humans in {{developed}} countries, but relatively common for humans in developing countries, especially those living in urban slums without access to adequate sanitation. More common in developed countries are the indirect routes; foodstuffs or water become contaminated (by people not adequately washing their hands before preparing food or tending to patients, or untreated sewage being released into a drinking water supply) {{and the people who}} eat and drink them become infected. In some developing countries, many people are not connected to sewer systems, and where they are, most sewage is discharged into the environment without treatment. However, a bigger problem in some developing countries is open defecation which leads to disease transmission via the fecal-oral route, especially for children. Even in developed countries there are <b>periodic</b> <b>system</b> failures resulting in a sanitary sewer overflow. [...] This is the typical mode of transmission for the infectious agents of (at least): cholera, hepatitis A, polio, Rotavirus, Salmonella, and parasites (e.g. Ascaris lumbricoides).|$|E
40|$|Abstract: We {{consider}} the direct application of balancing techniques to unstable <b>periodic</b> <b>systems</b> by extending the balancing concepts to arbitrary <b>periodic</b> <b>systems.</b> We extend first the balancing concepts to unstable discrete-time systems by defining the reachability and observability grammians from appropriate {{right and left}} coprime factorizations with inner denominators. Further, we extend this new balancing method to unstable linear time-varying discrete-time systems with periodically varying coefficient matrices. The new balancing approach serves as basis to develop balancing related order reduction methods for unstable <b>periodic</b> <b>systems</b> using accuracy enhancing square-root and balancing-free algorithms...|$|R
