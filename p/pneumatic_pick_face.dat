In the working process of the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>pick,</b> pick cylinder under different loading easily lead to early obsolescence. In order to improve the impact resistance performance to pick picks, prolong the service life of <b>pneumatic</b> <b>pick,</b> based on the digital design method for <b>pneumatic</b> <b>pick</b> pick cylinder is modeled, {{and based on the}} simulated stress analysis, for the process improvement, improve its mechanical performance, reduce the waste of raw materials...|$|R

Their <b>pneumatic</b> <b>picks</b> struck into the flooded tunnel of an abandoned mine, and they were helpless as the water rose because the motor on the pocito's only winch - the winch that raises and lowers the bote - wouldn't come to life." ...|$|R
50|$|In 1958 Lewis Merthyr Colliery and the {{neighbouring}} Ty Mawr Colliery merged and all coal winding ceased at Lewis Merthyr, with coaling continuing via Ty Mawr {{and men and}} supplies only at Lewis Merthyr. By 1969 the Colliery had become the Ty Mawr/Lewis Merthyr Colliery. As many as thirteen seams have been worked at the Lewis Merthyr using the advanced long wall method of working {{with most of the}} coal being won with <b>pneumatic</b> <b>picks</b> and hand loaded onto conveyors.|$|R

40|$|The {{front end}} (F E) control was {{recently}} reported {{as an alternative}} solution to a class of set-point control problems. Initial experiments with a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>pick</b> and place robot arm showed that F E control has a distinct advantage over conventional set-point control in achieving a high quality of system response {{in terms of time}} domain specifications. This has motivated further applications and analysis of F E control systems. This paper presents an adaptive F E control scheme for a class of time-delayed systems having unknown gains. The proposed scheme, when employed in controlling a repetitively operated thermal process, exhibits appreciable improvements in the quality of response compared with the conventional onloff adaptive control scheme. ...|$|R

30|$|According to {{pharmacy}} practice, {{a dedicated}} storage policy is used, {{which means that}} each product type is assigned to a fixed bin. However, we assumed a random retrieval policy, which means that any product within the <b>pick</b> <b>face</b> has the same probability to be retrieved. Thus, the storage and retrieval are independent operations.|$|R
30|$|It {{should be}} {{mentioned}} that the retrieval–travel time of all items: N stored in the rack become the retrieval–travel time of items N_PF stored only in the <b>pick</b> <b>face,</b> since we have assumed that a dedicated storage policy was used, and the items were automatically moved from the storage to the picking side of the rack by gravity.|$|R
50|$|On April 9, Porcello {{made his}} Major League debut against Toronto, {{opposite}} Blue Jays rookie pitcher Ricky Romero. The game {{marked the first}} time in MLB history that two first-round <b>picks</b> <b>faced</b> each other in their respective debuts. Porcello pitched five innings and took the loss for Detroit. He struck out four batters and allowed four runs on eight hits.|$|R
30|$|Our idea {{consists}} in dividing the retrieval–travel {{time of a}} location (i,j) in a two-travel time (vertical and horizontal) where the locations (i,j) are uniformly distributed. Therefore, the expected retrieval time {{is the sum of}} the mean values of each travel time. As stated in the assumption part, the <b>pick</b> <b>face</b> is supposed as a continuous rectangle. In this case, the discrete coordinates (i,j) become continuous coordinates noted (i,j).|$|R

40|$|AbstractA {{protective}} layer (PL) is commonly reserved above foundation surface {{to protect the}} underlying rock mass during dam foundation excavation. In China, the PL of dam foundation is conventionally subdivided into two or three thin layers and excavated with the shallow-hole blasting method, even by <b>pneumatic</b> <b>pick</b> method in case of soft rock mass. The aforementioned layered excavation of the PL delays {{the construction of the}} whole project. After nearly 30 -year practices, several safe and efficient methods for the PL excavation of dam foundation are gradually developed. They include shallow-hole bench blasting with cushion material (SBC) {{at the bottom of the}} hole, and horizontal smooth blasting (HSB). The PL is even cancelled on the condition that horizontal pre-split technique is employed during dam foundation excavation. This paper introduces the aforementioned two PL excavation methods (shallow-hole blasting and bench blasting) and horizontal pre-split technique of dam foundation without {{protective layer}} (HPP). The basic principles of blasting method, blasting geometry, charge structure, drill-and-blast parameters of typical projects are examined. Meanwhile, the merits and limitations of each method are compared. Engineering practices in China show that HSB is basically the optimal method for dam foundation PL excavation in terms of foundation damage control and rapid construction. Some new problems for dam foundation PL excavation arising, such as strong unloading and relaxation phenomenon that encountered in the gorge region of southwest China, are needed to be addressed; and the corresponding countermeasures are discussed as well...|$|R

50|$|Between a large, tiered modern {{cutting of}} {{shotcrete}} (known as Moggill's Wall {{and not of}} cultural heritage significance) and the entrance to Tunnel 3 (144.5 km), a steep, high and long rock face incorporates a number of features. The rock face runs parallel to a large section of check railed curving track. The face begins with a wall of pick-faced, cut and dressed stone extending approximately seven metres high and wide. As the face increases in height, large sections of concrete rendering surround numerous areas of pick-faced exposed rock. Set in among eroded sandstone at various heights are sections of cut and dressed and mortared stone work. Small tufts of vegetation are scattered along the face. Directly outside the entrance to Tunnel 3, a high cutting of steep rock has extensive <b>pick</b> <b>facing</b> and a section of stone walling along its base.|$|R

The goal was to investigate if providing a neither option to a match to sample task increases the accuracy of responding. Subjects were asked to study three faces for 10 seconds, after which {{they were asked to}} <b>pick</b> out the <b>faces</b> in a forced choice setting where two other faces were presented. Later the subjects were asked to <b>pick</b> out <b>faces</b> in a setting in which they could use a neither option. Results indicated that a generalization effect occurs when identifying faces and the effect is seen as subjects choosing the wrong face. This suggests that when using faces with some similar features in a lineup setting the procedure may cause the subject to pick the wrong person...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{outlines}} {{a project}} to study the dynamic loading of ice-axes. The principle {{aim of the research}} was to increase the understanding of the state of stress experienced by an ice-axe in normal use. A climber's overarm swing technique, as employed in technical 'ice-climbing', was studied using a high speed video system. A typical swing was found to have an impact velocity of 90 ms- 1 at a pick impact of 20 ° to the normal. A test rig was constructed to replicate the dynamic loading of a selection of 'technical axe' heads. A 2 mm thick photoelastic coating was bonded to each of the <b>pick</b> <b>faces</b> and impact events recorded using a reflection polariscope and a high speed video running at 2000 frames per second. The observed fringe patterns were used to make a qualitative comparison between picks with different tooth designs - saw-toothed, 6 mm and 45 mm semi-circular toothed and plain picks. It was found that the loading was predominantly in-plane bending in-plane bending. Improvements in strength performance could most effectively be achieved by widening and not thickening of the pick. However, the loading is unlikely to be that in which might be a combination of out of plane bending and torsion. It was concluded, therefore, that a study needs to be carried out to look at the loading regime in realistic conditions...|$|R
