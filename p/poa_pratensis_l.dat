Germination of seeds was conducted in the growth chamber at the light and temperature regime – day/night – 12 / 12 hours, 23 / 15 ˚C, rh 70 %, for 42 days. Extracts significantly affected the total germinability and germination rate of Poa annua L. seeds (p = 0. 000). The lowest germinability (27. 3 ± 7. 1 %) and germination rate (0. 7 ± 0. 2 seeds per day) had Poa annua L. seeds germinated in <b>Poa</b> <b>pratensis</b> <b>L.</b> aqueous extract. Used extracts (except for Festuca rubra L. extract) had significantly inhibitory effect on length of Poa annua L. roots in comparison with control variant. The positive effect of extract from Lolium perenne L. and Festuca rubra L. (not– significant) and the negative effect of extract from <b>Poa</b> <b>pratensis</b> <b>L.</b> and Poa annua l.

40|$|Kentucky {{bluegrass}} (<b>Poa</b> <b>pratensis</b> <b>L.)</b> {{is a major}} cool-season turfgrass requiring frequent mowing. Utilization of cultivars {{with slow}} growth is a promising method to decrease mowing frequency. In this study, two dwarf mutant selections of Kentucky bluegrass (A 12 and A 16) induced by space mutation were analyzed for the differentially expressed genes compared with the wild type (WT) by the high-throughput RNA-Seq technology. 253, 909 unigenes were obtained by de novo assembly. 24. 20 % of the unigenes had a significant level of amino acid sequence identity to Brachypodium distachyon proteins, followed by Hordeum vulgare with 18. 72 % among the non-redundant (NR) Blastx top hits. Assembled unigenes were associated with 32 pathways using KEGG orthology terms and their respective KEGG maps. Between WT and A 16 libraries, 4, 203 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, whereas there were 883 DEGs between WT and A 12 libraries. Further investigation revealed that the DEG pathways were mainly involved in terpenoid biosynthesis and plant hormone metabolism, which might account for the differences of plant height and leaf blade color between dwarf mutant and WT plants.
