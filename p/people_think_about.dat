The less forgiving people reported a greater number of health problems.|$|E

25|$|DeNeve (1999) {{argued that}} there are three trends in the {{relationship}} between personality and SWB. Firstly, SWB is closely tied to traits associated with emotional tendencies (emotional stability, positive affectivity, and tension). Secondly, relationship enhancing traits (e.g. trust, affiliation) are important for subjective well-being. Happy people tend to have strong relationships and be good at fostering them. Thirdly, the way <b>people</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> and explain events is important for subjective well-being. Appraising events in an optimistic fashion, having a sense of control, and making active coping efforts facilitates subjective well-being. Trust, a trait substantially related to SWB, as opposed to cynicism involves making positive rather than negative attributions about others. Making positive, optimistic attributions rather than negative pessimistic ones facilitates subjective well-being.|$|E

When a remastered edition of the original Guitar Solos was released 28 years later on Frith's own Fred Records label, it attracted further praise from critics.

[...] Gomez further elaborated on the concept of the song on an interview with Just Jared Jr., saying, It's basically about Hollywood and what <b>people</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> it and essentially how plastic it is sometimes.

Daybreaker lyrics were written by Carter and Tom Searle, who focused on political and [...] "bigger picture" [...] themes. Carter described [...] "Devil's Island" [...] as [...] "one of the hardest songs to write" [...] because of the prominence of its theme of rioting. Searle, who focused on its lyrics, said, [...] "With money firmly ingrained into our global society we really need to look to alternative solutions when problems like the riots occur because violence is never the solution".

Matthew Yglesias described the book as a [...] "bravua performance from {{one of the most interesting}} thinkers out there". Though he said it was remarkably silent on intellectual property law and the implications for society of a world in which most of the increase in output comes from catch-up growth from poor countries. The Wall Street Journal described the book as Cowen's most impactful book due to the direction in which he leads the debate. [...] "What is exciting is to imagine students, economists, and scientists across the country reading the book, coming to terms with the depth of our challenge and pursuing new ways of trying to 'fix' things or generally improve our lot." [...] "A small book but a big, worthwhile question", concluded The Economist. In the New York Times, David Brooks praised The Great Stagnation as [...] "the most debated non-fiction book so far this year", which Timothy Noah described as a great favor to the book's marketing though an exaggeration considering the discussion surrounding Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother by Amy Chua.|$|E

500|$|Following {{an advance}} {{screening}} at CinemaCon on April 22, 2015, {{the film was}} well received by audiences. Praise was aimed for its smart storyline, although some wondered whether the concept was too complicated for young audiences and to attract family crowds. After premiering at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival, the film attracted praise from film critics. Peter Debruge of Variety was effusive, calling it the studio's [...] "greatest idea" [...] and [...] "a stunningly original concept that [...] promises to forever change the way <b>people</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> the way people think." [...] The Chicago Tribunes Michael Phillips called it the studio's best since Up (also directed by Docter), a [...] "consistently inventive and a heartening corrective to recent, stockholder-driven inferiorities." [...] Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter deemed it an [...] "audacious concept" [...] that stands among the most [...] "conceptually trippy films" [...] for family audiences. [...] "With its quite literally cerebral bent, I think Inside Out might have some trouble fully connecting with younger kids, but grown-ups are likely to shed {{more than a few}} tears," [...] remarked Richard Lawson of Vanity Fair. The Guardians Peter Bradshaw felt it [...] "buoyant and sweet-natured," [...] though slightly inferior to Pixar's best. Ignatiy Vishnevetsky of The A.V. Club, while overall positive on the film, said it [...] "trades the wordless gracefulness and sense of discovery of the animation studio's best work for explanatory voice-over and nonstop exposition," [...] also arguing that the Pixar animators could have been more visually adventurous to match the conceptual ambition.|$|E

I've learned a lot from them", and he explained that he was working on that day with Mandler, someone he respects and looks up to. On the video, Drake said, [...] "We talked colors, we talked epic, emotion-evoking visuals." [...] He called the story of the video interesting and the song tells [...] "sort of a love story". He explained that the video {{has a lot to do}} with his debut album, stating [...] "The album is about finding love, feeling 'Have I sold my soul' as far as 'Will I ever be able to gain the trust of a woman? Will I only be able to be around the dark, evil women? Will I ever find that pure love?' Those elements are in the video." [...] In a separate interview on his Away From Home Tour, with MTV News, Drake said the video takes the song to [...] "another place". He said it offers up a different look to the song. He explained, [...] "This video is what I was really thinking about. The song is like a bad dream — but it's not a bad dream, it's not a terrible dream. It's a little evil. The video really reflects that. It's a struggle between the purities of my past life and what this new life has to offer. Even in the video, you see me looking back and forth between the two and deciding. At the end of the video I don't necessarily make a decision, but when you get the album, you'll see what choice I make." ...|$|E
