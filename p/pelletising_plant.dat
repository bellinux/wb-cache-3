The effects of occupational exposure to zeranol in 11 exposed workers from a <b>pelletising</b> <b>plant</b> and 14 nonexposed subjects were assessed. A questionnaire showed that more breast symptoms were reported by male and female plant workers compared with non-exposed subjects, although {{the difference was not}} statistically significant. Clinical assessment showed no cases of gynaecomastia in all the male participants. Blood samples analysed by high performance liquid chromatography for zeranol, its precursor zearalenone, and its main metabolites did not show any of these compounds above the laboratory limit of detection. Serum levels of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinising hormone (LH), prolactin, and oestradiol showed no striking differences between the exposed and the non-exposed subjects. Total and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL cholesterol) levels did not significantly differ between the two groups but mean high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL cholesterol) levels were higher in the exposed group; this could be due to relatively high HDL cholesterol in two women exposed to zeranol or relatively low HDL cholesterol in three non-exposed men...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} a part of a project which aim is to develop a process {{integration}} model for the Swedish iron ore company LKAB's production system in Malmberget. Within the facility, there are two <b>pelletising</b> <b>plants</b> which were started up 1973 and 2006, respectively. Both <b>pelletising</b> <b>plants</b> are using the straight grate induration furnace, and they are the most energy intense process units within the facility. Basically a straight grate induration furnace consists of three different zones, i. e. a drying zone, a firing zone and a cooling zone, and their purpose is to upgrade crude iron ore to the final product of iron ore pellet. As an initial step of the project, the mass and energy flows within a straight grate induration furnace have been analysed. The outcome of the analysis will in the future constitute as a basis towards a total mass and energy balance for the whole production chain within the facility in Malmberget. Later on the model will be used to optimize, primarily, energy consumption and environmental impact. Godkänd; 2008; 20080917 (samnor...|$|R
40|$|Mintek {{together}} with Middelburg Steel & Alloys, developed the DC arc furnace {{process for the}} production of ferroalloys with the expressed objective of smelting ore fines (< 1 mm) without the need for agglomeration. In the case of ferrochrome production, the DC arc furnace, being a semi-open bath operation, loses radiant energy directly from the bath to the furnace roof and sidewalls above the melt. This energy loss is reflected in a higher electrical energy usage per ton of alloy than for a submerged-arc operation smelting lumpy ores or sintered pellets. The difference increases still further when pre-heated sintered pellet feed is used in a submerged-arc operation. This shortcoming of the DC arc furnace can however be overcome by preheating the feed to the furnace in a fluidized bed or flash reactor fuelled by cold furnace off-gas. In addition to fluidization and preheating testwork, various preheating flowsheets with associated mass and energy balances have been developed and compared from a techno-economic viewpoint. The three major advantages identified were: a) fluidized beds can preheat ores and fluxes up to 950 °C without sticking and defluidizing, b) the open bath DC arc furnace does not require expensive coke or char to maintain the burden porosity and, c) the capital cost associated with the milling, <b>pelletising</b> and sintering <b>plant</b> falls away since ore fines are used directly...|$|R
