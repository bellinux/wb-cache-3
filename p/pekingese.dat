5|$|It {{is thought}} that the toy spaniels that {{eventually}} became the King Charles Spaniel originated in the Far East, primarily Japan. They may share a common ancestry with the <b>Pekingese</b> and Japanese Chin. Toy spaniels were given as gifts to European royalty.|$|E
5|$|Cardigan Welsh Corgis {{continued}} to be rarer than Pembrokes, with only 11 registrations made in the war year of 1940. Both breeds survived the Second World War, although the Cardigans registered with the Kennel Club numbered only 61 {{by the end of}} the war. Pembrokes became very popular during the post war years in the United Kingdom; in 1953 it was ranked as the fourth most popular breed by the Kennel Club, behind the English Cocker Spaniel, the German Shepherd and the <b>Pekingese.</b> In 1955, the reserve Best in Show at Crufts was the Pembroke Welsh Corgi Kaytop Maracas Mint, who was beaten by the Standard Poodle Ch. Tzigane Affri of Nashend. The Corgi breeds declined in popularity: veterinary physician Brian Singleton suggested in The Times in 1963 that this was due to issues with their temperament.|$|E

25|$|About 32 people boarded Boat 3, with Able-Bodied Seaman George Moore put {{in charge}} by Murdoch. Again, mostly women and {{children}} boarded, with a few men allowed in at the end. They included Henry S. Harper, who was accompanied by his valet-dragoman and <b>Pekingese</b> dog, Sun Yat Sen.|$|E
25|$|On 8 March 1966, {{students}} {{managed to}} ransack the foreign ministry, {{and held it}} for five hours. They daubed slogans, one accusing Subandrio of murdering the generals, and drew graffiti showing Subandrio as a <b>Pekingese</b> dog (a reference to his perceived closeness to communist China) or hanging from gallows.|$|E
25|$|Poodles are crossed {{with other}} breeds for various reasons, and the {{resulting}} puppies (called designer dogs) are described by whimsical portmanteau words, such as cockapoo or spoodle (Cocker Spaniel), maltipoo (Maltese), goldendoodle, labradoodle (Labrador), Schnoodle (Schnauzer), Pekapoos (<b>Pekingese),</b> Cavapoo (Cavalier King Charles), Bernedoodle (Bernese Mountain Dog) and many others.|$|E
25|$|Syringomyelia (SM) is a {{condition}} affecting the brain and spine, causing symptoms ranging from mild discomfort to severe pain and partial paralysis. Syringomyelia is characterised by fluid filled cavities within the spinal cord. SM occurs secondary to obstruction of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) especially if that obstruction is at the foramen magnum. To date the condition has been also reported in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels, King Charles Spaniels, Yorkshire Terriers, Maltese Terriers, Chihuahuas, Miniature Dachshunds, Miniature/Toy Poodles, Bichon Frisé, Pugs, Shih Tzus, Pomeranians, Boston Terriers, French Bulldogs, a <b>Pekingese,</b> a Miniature Pinscher, mixbreeds, {{and a couple of}} cats.|$|E
25|$|Poirot {{begins his}} investigations. Having ascertained {{the name of}} Miss Carnaby's {{previous}} employer, Lady Hartingfield who died a year before, he visits her niece who confirms Lady Hoggin's view of Miss Carnaby's lack of intellect but essential good qualities, looking after an invalid sister and being good with dogs, {{so much so that}} Lady Hartingfield left her <b>Pekingese</b> to her. Poirot interviews the park keeper who remembers the incident of the kidnap. He then investigates the address where the ransom money was sent to and finds it is a cheap hotel where letters are often left for non-residents. His third visit is to the wife of the man Hoggin met at his club who gives a very similar story to that told by Lady Hoggin as to the method of kidnap and ransom demand. His last visit is back to Sir Joseph to report on progress where he observes that Sir Joseph's relationship with his blond secretary is not exactly on a professional level.|$|E
25|$|Poirot sends his valet out {{investigating}} {{and finds}} an address which confirms Poirot's suspicions {{of where it}} would be and what he would find there. Poirot visits it and finds Miss Carnaby, her invalid sister, Emily and a <b>Pekingese</b> dog, Augustus. They are part of a scam run by women who are companions to rich and ungrateful ladies. These women are poorly paid, without talent and will be cast adrift when they get older. The dog that is taken out for a walk is their own, Augustus, who is let off his lead and is able to find {{his way back to the}} sister's flat unaided, thus providing witnesses to the 'crime'. The 'subject' of the kidnap is held at the sister's flat and their owner told of the ransom. Quite often it is the companion who is sent out with the envelope of pound notes which goes into a general pool for all the companions involved in the scheme. Miss Carnaby feels guilty for her crime but excuses it on the basis of the way they are treated by their employers – only the other day Lady Hoggin accused her of tampering with her tonic as it tasted unpleasant. Poirot tells them their activities must stop and that the money must be returned to Lady Hoggin although he is sure that he will be able to persuade her husband not to involve the police.|$|E
500|$|Attempts {{were made}} to {{recreate}} the original Cavalier King Charles Spaniel {{as early as the}} turn of the 20th century, using the now extinct Toy Trawler Spaniels. These attempts were documented by Judith Blunt-Lytton, 16th Baroness Wentworth, in the book [...] "Toy Dogs and Their Ancestors Including the History And Management of Toy Spaniels, <b>Pekingese,</b> Japanese and Pomeranians" [...] published under the name of the [...] "Hon. Mrs Neville Lytton" [...] in 1911.|$|E
2500|$|No-one: a {{creature}} met by Tim {{on the way}} to Hell that takes his form to try to trick him into becoming its plaything. [...] Tim threatens it with being turned into a statuette of a <b>Pekingese</b> and it leaves him be, giving him directions to find Molly.|$|E
2500|$|The Flowers were nicknamed [...] "the <b>pekingese</b> of the ocean". They had a {{reputation}} of having poor sea-handling characteristics, most often rolling in heavy seas, with 80-degree rolls, 40 degrees each side of upright, being fairly common; it was said they [...] "would roll on wet grass". Many crewmen suffered severe motion sickness {{for a few weeks}} until they acclimatised to shipboard life. Although poor in their sea-handling characteristics, the Flowers were extremely seaworthy; no Allied sailor was ever lost overboard from a Flower during World War II, outside combat.|$|E
2500|$|It was {{reported}} that the 2003 Crufts champion – a <b>Pekingese</b> – had to sit on an ice pack to have its photo taken. The programme explained that the breed tends to overheat due to its inability to breathe properly, {{as a result of}} its flattened face. The dog was revealed to have undergone a soft palate resection earlier, to fix a problem caused by the flattened face. [...] Professor Dan Brockman from the Royal Veterinary College explained that the condition is inherited and is very likely to be passed down to later generations. Despite that, the Crufts champion had sired 18 litters.|$|E
2500|$|Purebred {{dogs are}} known by breed names given {{to groups of}} dogs that are visibly similar in most {{characteristics}} and have reliable documented descent. But in recent years many owners and breeders of crossbreed dogs identify them—often facetiously—by invented names constructed from parts of the parents' breed names. These are known as portmanteau names and the resulting crosses as [...] "designer dogs." [...] For example, {{a cross between a}} <b>Pekingese</b> and a Poodle may be referred to as a Peekapoo. Another trendy cross is the Goldendoodle, a cross between a standard poodle and a golden retriever.|$|E
2500|$|Pronunciations are glossed in late 19th-century {{standard}} Beijing Mandarin. In addition, Giles glosses pronunciations in archaic Middle Chinese rime ("R." [...] {{according to}} the Peiwen Yunfu rime dictionary) and fanqie, nine regional varieties of Chinese (commonly mistaken for mutually-understandable [...] "dialects"), and the Japanese, Vietnamese, and Korean languages (Yong and Peng 2008: 387). Giles' dictionary went far beyond Williams', which glosses pronunciations in Middle Chinese and four regional varieties: Shantou, Amoy, Fuzhou, and Shanghai Chinese. Giles' dictionary abbreviates the nine varieties ("dialects") by their initial letter: C. Cantonese, H. Hakka, F. Foochow, W. Wênchow, N. Ningpo, P. <b>Pekingese,</b> M. [...] "Mid-China", Y. Yangchow, and S. Ssuch'uan, {{as well as in}} K. Korean, J. Japanese, and A. Annamese languages.|$|E
2500|$|... "It is important," [...] remind Ann Rogers Clark and Andrew Brace, [...] "Not {{to claim}} great age for breeds, {{though it is}} quite {{legitimate}} to claim considerable antiquity for types of dogs." [...] The attempts to classify dogs into different 'species' show that dog types could be quite distinctive, from the 'Canis melitaeus' of lapdogs descended from ancient Roman pet dogs to the even more ancient 'Canis molossus', the Molossan types, to the 'Canis saultor', the dancing mongrel of beggars. These types were uniform enough to {{appear to have been}} selectively bred, but as Raymond Coppinger wrote, [...] "Natural processes can produce, could produce, and do produce populations of unusual and uniform dogs, that is, dogs with a distinctive conformation." [...] The human manipulation was very indirect. In a very few cases, Emperors or monasteries or wealthy hunters might maintain lines of special dogs, from which we have today <b>Pekingese,</b> St. Bernards, and foxhounds.|$|E
2500|$|Miss Lemon, Poirot's secretary, {{finds the}} first of the labours in a letter from a bluff outspoken businessman, Sir Joseph Hoggin, whose wife's <b>Pekingese</b> dog has been kidnapped. Poirot meets Hoggin, who tells him the dog was taken a week ago but {{returned}} for a ransom of two hundred pounds. Hoggin would have left the matter there but {{for the fact that the}} same thing had happened to an acquaintance at his club. Poirot meets the petulant Lady Hoggin and her put-upon companion, Miss Amy Carnaby, who is clearly frightened of her employer. Miss Carnaby took the yapping dog, Shan-Tung (described by Poirot as [...] "a veritable lion"), for his walk in the park and she stopped to admire a baby in the pram. When she looked down, someone had cut the dog's lead and it had been taken. A ransom note said to leave the money in notes in an envelope for a Captain Curtis at an address in Bloomsbury.|$|E
2500|$|A perianal gland tumor {{is a type}} of tumor {{found near}} the anus in dogs that arises from {{specialized}} glandular tissue found in the perineum. [...] Perianal glands do not exist in cats. [...] It is also known as a hepatoid tumor because of the similarity in cell shape to hepatocytes (liver cells). [...] It is most commonly seen in intact (not neutered) dogs and is the third most common tumor type in intact male dogs. [...] There are two types of perianal gland tumors, perianal gland adenomas, which are benign, and perianal gland adenocarcinomas, which are malignant. [...] Both have receptors for testosterone. [...] Perianal gland adenomas are {{three times more likely to}} be found in intact male dogs than females, and perianal gland adenocarcinomas are ten times more common in male dogs than females. [...] The most commonly affected breeds for adenomas are the Siberian Husky, Cocker Spaniel, <b>Pekingese,</b> and Samoyed; for adenocarcinomas the most commonly affected breeds are the Siberian Husky, Bulldog, and Alaskan Malamute.|$|E

60|$|Speaking of Marcus Aurelius and the golfing {{temperament}} recalls to my {{mind the}} case of young Mitchell Holmes. Mitchell, when I knew him first, was a promising {{young man with a}} future before him in the Paterson Dyeing and Refining Company, of which my old friend, Alexander Paterson, was the president. He had many engaging qualities--among them an unquestioned ability to imitate a bulldog quarrelling with a <b>Pekingese</b> in a way which had to be heard to be believed. It was a gift which made him much in demand at social gatherings in the neighbourhood, marking him off from other young men who could only almost play the mandolin or recite bits of Gunga Din; and no doubt it was this talent of his which first sowed the seeds of love in the heart of Millicent Boyd. Women are essentially hero-worshippers, and when a warm-hearted girl like Millicent has heard a personable young man imitating a bulldog and a <b>Pekingese</b> to the applause of a crowded drawing-room, and has been able to detect the exact point at which the <b>Pekingese</b> leaves off and the bulldog begins, she can never feel quite the same to other men. In short, Mitchell and Millicent were engaged, and were only waiting to be married till the former could bite the Dyeing and Refining Company's ear for a bit of extra salary.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{did make}} {{her look like a}} <b>Pekingese.</b> That was not vulgar abuse. It was sound, {{constructive}} criticism, with no motive behind it but the kindly desire to keep her from making an exhibition of herself in public. Wantonly to accuse a man of puffing when he goes up a flight of stairs is something very different." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, of course, {{there was}} always the matter of that dog of hers. She had a dog, you know, a snappy brute of a <b>Pekingese.</b> If there was ever any shadow of {{disagreement}} between us, {{it had to do with}} that dog. I made rather a point of it that I would not have it about the home after we were married." ...|$|E
60|$|At {{this moment}} the subject {{had to be}} hastily dropped. Lady Susan bore down upon them, leaning {{on the arm of}} Clovis's mother, to whom she was confiding the fact that she {{disapprove}}d of the craze for <b>Pekingese</b> spaniels. It was the third thing she had found time to disapprove of since lunch, without counting her silent and permanent disapproval of the way Clovis's mother did her hair.|$|E
60|$|True, {{they had}} had their little tiffs, notably on the {{occasion}} when Tuppy--with {{what he said was}} fearless honesty and I considered thorough goofiness--had told Angela that her new hat made her look like a <b>Pekingese.</b> But in every romance you have to budget for the occasional dust-up, and after that incident I had supposed that he had learned his lesson and that from then on life would be one grand, sweet song.|$|E
60|$|In the flesh, Mrs. Opal Emerson Mudge fell {{somewhat}} {{short of}} a prophetic aspect. She was pony-built and plump, {{with the face of}} a haughty <b>Pekingese,</b> a button of a nose, and arms so short that, despite her most indignant endeavors, she could not clasp her hands in front of her as she sat on the platform waiting. Her frock of taffeta and green velvet, with three strings of glass beads, and large folding eye-glasses dangling from a black ribbon, was a triumph of refinement.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Cracknell rose, {{the basket}} in his arms. With {{uncertain}} steps {{and a look}} on his face like that of those who lead forlorn hopes he crossed the floor to where Miss Mabel Hobson sat, proud and aloof. The next moment that haughty lady, the centre of an admiring and curious crowd, was hugging to her bosom a protesting <b>Pekingese</b> puppy, and Mr. Cracknell, seizing his opportunity like a good general, had deposited himself in a chair at her side. The course of true love was running smooth again.|$|E
60|$|It {{was after}} lunch, as {{we made our}} way to the first tee, that the advance-guard of the Mrs. Jopps {{appeared}} in the person of Luella Mainprice Jopp, a kittenish little woman with blond hair and a <b>Pekingese</b> dog. I remembered reading in the papers that she had divorced my employer for persistent and aggravated mental cruelty, calling witnesses to bear out her statement that he had said he did not like her in pink, and that on two separate occasions had insisted on her dog eating the leg of a chicken instead of the breast; but Time, the great healer, seemed to have removed all bitterness, and she greeted him affectionately.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Pekingese</b> weigh from 7 to 14 lb {{and stand}} about 6 - 9 {{in at the}} withers, however they can {{sometimes}} be smaller. These smaller <b>Pekingese</b> are {{commonly referred to as}} [...] "Sleeve" [...] <b>Pekingese</b> or just [...] "Sleeves". The name is taken from ancient times, when emperors would carry the smallest of the breed in their sleeves. A <b>Pekingese</b> over 15 pounds is disqualified in the show ring.|$|E
50|$|All breed {{standards}} allow a {{wide range}} of color combinations. The majority of <b>Pekingese</b> are gold, red or sable. Cream, black, white, sables, black and tan and occasionally 'blue' or slate grey have appeared in the breed. The latter often has poor pigment and light eyes. Albino <b>Pekingese</b> (white with pink eyes) should be bred cautiously due to health problems that have been associated with albinism. The <b>Pekingese</b> sheds a lot.|$|E
50|$|In Hubbard's time, {{the term}} Sleeve was applied in Britain to a {{miniature}} <b>Pekingese</b> {{no more than}} 6-7 pounds in weight, often appearing to be only about 3-4 pounds. Mrs Flander's Mai Mai weighed only a little over 4 pounds and many other breeders had bred true miniatures of a similar size. He noted that miniatures may appear in a litter bred from full-sized <b>Pekingese</b> and were exhibited in classes for dogs less than 7 pounds at the major dog shows in Britain. In 1946 (when Hubbard wrote his book), the Sleeve <b>Pekingese</b> had a strong following with the most popular colours being cream and white, with white being considered particularly attractive. He illustrated the description with a white Sleeve <b>Pekingese</b> bred by Mrs Aileen Adam.|$|E
