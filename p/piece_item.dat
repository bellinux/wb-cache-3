50|$|The material, {{known as}} the madras, is named after its place of origin, Madras, India. The origins of the Madras lie in the pre-emancipation days of St. Lucia, when African slaves on the island would don the {{colourful}} dress during feast days. Beginning in the late 17th century, slaves on the island were forced to wear the livre of the estate to which they belonged. Normally a single colour, one <b>piece</b> <b>item,</b> originally worn as a sarong, later becoming a simple tunic with holes for the arms and head, and a simple rope belt. During Sundays and holidays, the slaves could normally wear what they wished, and through monies earned through selling produce from small plots of land, they would often buy colourful cloth. On feast days and special occasions, free women and slaves would wear the colourful clothes, now known as Creole dress.|$|E
5000|$|Camouflage berets {{possibly}} {{originate from}} the General Service cap [...] "Cap, General Service" [...] issued to the British Army in a Khaki material before {{the introduction of}} Berets. It was first introduced under [...] "Army Council Instruction 1407" [...] of September 1943. This cap was designed to replace the [...] "Field Service cap" [...] or [...] "FS Cap" [...] that had been worn since the outbreak of war. These caps were issued in priority to units serving overseas. UK based units got theirs later on. It was at first unpopular due to its over large appearance. This cap was not a beret. It was made from several pieces of drab cloth material, whereas a beret was a one <b>piece</b> <b>item.</b> It {{was based on the}} Scottish balmoral bonnet in design. First issues were made from the same gaberdine cloth as the old [...] "FS" [...] cap. Badges worn on it were the conventional Officers bronze, and OR's badges in both plastic and metal. Units which had special distinctions could still wear these on the [...] "GS" [...] cap. The General Service cap was worn by regulation one inch above the eyebrows, with badge over the left eye and the cap pulled down to the right. But many wartime photos will show it worn pushed back on the head, which seemed to be a fashion with many soldiers late in the War.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} reworking of defective items and develops an integrated cost model so as to minimize the extra costs of reworking/scraping of work <b>pieces.</b> <b>Items</b> to be reworked are the results of quality problem. To improve a product’s quality, the selection of process target is extremely important since it directly affects the process defective rate, material cost, rework or scrap cost, and loss to customer due to deviation of product from desired specification. The amount of investment necessary to economically correct a defective process is still an issue of research. This research is a contribution {{to this type of}} problem. In addition to cost estimation, the integrated cost model focuses on optimal tolerance, and optimal mean and variance of the output characteristics. The symmetrical truncated loss function is used to evaluate the cost of poor quality in a production system. Specifically, we investigate the possible economic investment in a process improvement to reduce its variance and shifting the process mean close to its target, resulting in the reduction of waste like rework/scrap. Numerical examples are presented to show all the steps involved and to verify the proposed model. Utilizing this model, decision-makers can evaluate any quality investment in order to achieve a significant financial retur...|$|R
