25|$|Because of {{the limited}} space {{available}} and the requirements for low weight, the payload instrumentation was designed and built with simplicity and high reliability in mind, using germanium and silicon transistors in its electronics. A total of 29 transistors were used in Explorer 1, plus additional ones in the Army's micrometeorite amplifier. Electrical power was provided by mercury chemical batteries that made up approximately 40 percent of the <b>payload</b> <b>weight.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Though most of {{this work}} dealt with the {{theoretical}} and experimental relations between propellant, rocket mass, thrust, and velocity, a final section, entitled [...] "Calculation of minimum mass required to raise one pound to an 'infinite' altitude", discussed the possible uses of rockets, not only to reach the upper atmosphere, but to escape from Earth's gravitation altogether. He determined that a rocket with an effective exhaust velocity (see specific impulse) of 7000 feet per second and an initial weight of 602 pounds {{would be able to}} send a one-pound payload to an infinite height. Included as a thought experiment was the idea of launching a rocket to the moon and igniting a mass of flash powder on its surface, so as to be visible through a telescope. He discussed the matter seriously, down to an estimate of the amount of powder required; Goddard's conclusion was that a rocket with starting mass of 3.21 tons could produce a flash [...] "just visible" [...] from Earth, assuming a final <b>payload</b> <b>weight</b> of 10.7 pounds.|$|E

2500|$|Although many {{arguments}} {{in favor of}} EM guns revolve around the assumption that greater muzzle velocity is always better, this is open to challenge. Parametric relationships between range, <b>payload</b> <b>weight,</b> and launch velocity show {{that this is not a}} strong argument for many suggested EM gun applications. For example, due to lower aerodynamic drag at launch, a slower but heavier projectile may actually fly farther than a lighter faster one, making the velocity limitations of chemical propulsion perfectly acceptable. In addition, explosive fragmentary warhead lethality is largely unaffected by velocity and does not require more demanding hit-to-kill guidance electronics that may not survive extremely high gun launch accelerations. [...] Significantly, explosively formed penetrator and shaped charge warheads already drive what is technically a kinetic energy penetrator to velocities well in excess of EM gun launch capabilities, up to 8 km/s for a shaped charge, upon detonation with the target; and it has been demonstrated that with respect to armor penetration, increased impact velocity much above 2 km/s does not necessarily result in a deeper hole; (although the crater may be wider as more energy is deposited with increased impact velocity).|$|E

The reactor core design study shows that high reactor core bulk power densities might be achieved without an undue gas pressure drop across the reactor or an excessive temperature drop from the fuel element to the gas. The best core design appears to be one that utilizes thin, parallel, solid graphite plates as the heattransfer elements. Since the propellant gases are predominantly hydrogen, the use of graphite as the basic structural material will require {{the development of a}} hydrogenresistant coating to be applied to the surfaces of the graphite heat-transfer elements of the reactor core in order to inhibit chemical reactions between the gas and the graphite. The feasibility of the reactor core designs considered thus depends on the efficacy of the protective coatings proposed for the graphite heat-transfer elements. Thus {{the first step in a}} program of development of a nuclear rocket should be an experimental investigation of protective coatings for graphite for operation in hydrogen. (auth...|$|R

50|$|The tank chassis {{has evolved}} {{over the past years}} to {{accommodate}} greater <b>payload</b> <b>weights.</b> The tank chassis comes in tandem axle, spread axle, tri-axle, and hi/lo combo configurations. Tandem Axle Chassis were the industry standard initially. The closed tandem drop deck chassis typically have a GVWR of 65000 lb. The quest to increase payload capacities spawned the tri-axle chassis with the ability to scale 42000 lb. on the trailer axles. The addition of the third axle however added a significant increase to the tare weight of the chassis, thus limiting the permissible weight limits to comply with bridge laws. This led to the invention of the Spread Axle Chassis with a spread of 109 in allowing for the same weight to be dispersed on the rear axles of the trailer (42000 lb) as the tri-axle. This is the new industry standard with a GVWR (Gross Vehicle Weight Rating) of 80000 lb.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Several {{robotic system}} {{applications}} require manipulators to carry heavy payloads while operating from moving vehicles. These manipulators are mounted on moving/compliant bases, introducing additional {{degrees of freedom}} that are not actuated, increasing {{the complexity of the}} dynamic modeling and control. In this paper, a control strategy to improve the performance of mobile robotic manipulators is presented. In the proposed architecture, a joint level controller needs to be designed to account for gravity, base motions, and manipulator joint friction. This is achieved by combining two methods: (i) a linear feed-forward dynamic disturbance compensation (DDC) method, which combines a dynamic model of the physical system with sensory feedback of the base oscillations to compensate for inertial effects; and (ii) Base Sensor Control, which compensates for nonlinear joint characteristics such as high joint friction. To evaluate the performance of the control architecture, a 3 DOF planar mobile manipulator is simulated including base oscillations, several <b>payload</b> <b>weights,</b> and Coulomb and viscous joint friction effects...|$|R
