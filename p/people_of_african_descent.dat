Other than one apartment building, none of the other buildings planned for the cultural center were ever built.|$|E
25|$|African iron overload, {{formerly}} known as Bantu siderosis, was first observed among <b>people</b> <b>of</b> <b>African</b> <b>descent</b> in Southern Africa. Originally, this was blamed on ungalvanised barrels used to store home-made beer, which led to increased oxidation and increased iron levels in the beer. Further investigation has shown that only some people drinking this sort of beer get an iron overload syndrome, and that a similar syndrome occurred in <b>people</b> <b>of</b> <b>African</b> <b>descent</b> who have had no contact {{with this kind of}} beer (e.g., African Americans). This led investigators to the discovery of a gene polymorphism in the gene for ferroportin which predisposes some <b>people</b> <b>of</b> <b>African</b> <b>descent</b> to iron overload.|$|E

40|$|What connects Africa and the Caribbean is trans-Atlantic slavery which transported {{numerous}} {{sons and}} daughters of Africa to the plantations of the New World in the service of Western European capitalism. Because of this shared experience of trans-Atlantic slavery and European colonialism, issues of culture and identity are major concerns for African and Caribbean playwrights. Slavery and colonialism had involved systematic acts of cultural denigration, de-humanisation and loss of freedom, which left imprints on the collective psyches <b>of</b> the colonised <b>Africans</b> and enslaved <b>peoples</b> <b>of</b> <b>African</b> <b>descent</b> in the Caribbean. Both experiences brought intense cultural and psychic dislocations which still impact in various ways on the lives <b>of</b> <b>Africans</b> and <b>peoples</b> <b>of</b> <b>African</b> <b>descent</b> around the world.

40|$|In this dissertation, I {{take seriously}} Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. 2 ̆ 7 s {{assertion}} {{that even though}} non-indigenous peoples in America 2 ̆ 2 may have come over on different ships, 2 ̆ 2 they are all, in spite of and {{in the face of}} their particular ethnic, racial, gender, class, tribal, or national identities, nevertheless together 2 ̆ 2 in the same boat now. 2 ̆ 2 In particular, in this project I reconstruct and reinterpret the process of migration, assimilation, and the realization of full sociopolitical participation in the United States in terms of the relationship between <b>peoples</b> <b>of</b> <b>African</b> <b>descent</b> [...] who were compelled to migrate as slaves across the Middle Passage, and who also voluntarily immigrated from various localities within the Black Atlantic [...] and select groups of immigrants from other locations around the globe. In my thesis, I concentrate on novels by William Faulkner, Paule Marshall, James Baldwin, Gayl Jones, and cartoonist Chris Ware, and examine closely how these authors, in their respective texts, work to restructure, reimagine, and thereby challenge the enshrined American narratives of national belonging and acculturation through literary constructions of the identities and experiences <b>of</b> <b>peoples</b> <b>of</b> <b>African</b> <b>descent,</b> as migrants themselves, in tandem with their social, political, economic, sexual, racial, and cultural engagements with other immigrants to the nation-state. In the introduction to my text, I survey and carefully synthesize diverse literary, historical, sociological, postcolonial, and feminist approaches to and theories of the problems of race, immigration, and nationalization, and formulate a new critical interdisciplinary framework for the mutual (de) construction <b>of</b> <b>peoples</b> <b>of</b> <b>African</b> <b>descent</b> as immigrants among immigrants in America...|$|R

50|$|The AADS {{program is}} {{committed}} to enabling all of its students to engage in meaningful learning activities that provide them with an integrated and critical understanding of the experiences and contributions <b>of</b> <b>peoples</b> <b>of</b> <b>African</b> <b>descent</b> throughout the Americas. The program offers {{students the opportunity to}} examine experiences <b>of</b> <b>Africans</b> and African descendants by using theories and methods stemming from African American Studies and other fields. The interdisciplinary nature of the program allows its students to employ and combine the methods of traditional disciplines (e.g. literature, history, music, the visual arts, art history, religion, economics, philosophy, gender studies, political science, and sociology) in analyzing problems, issues, and questions that lie at the center of social, cultural, and political thought and action. This approach not only requires students to understand the interconnectedness of artistic and social phenomena but also the need for interdisciplinary study in order to comprehend them. In effect, AADS students are able to apply these theories and methodologies to better understand the social, political, and economic problems facing <b>African</b> Americans and <b>peoples</b> <b>of</b> <b>African</b> <b>descent</b> throughout the world.|$|R
