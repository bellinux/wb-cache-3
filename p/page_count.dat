5|$|Fantastic Adventures was {{initially}} bedsheet-sized {{and had a}} <b>page</b> <b>count</b> of 96, which increased to 144 when the publication was reduced to pulp-size in June 1940. It {{was initially}} priced at 20 cents. With the April 1942 issue the price increased to 25 cents, where it remained {{for the rest of}} the magazine's run, and the <b>page</b> <b>count</b> went up again to 240. From June 1943 to July 1945 there were 208 pages, and the count dropped to 176 with the October 1945 issue; then to 160 in July 1948, and only two issues later, in September 1948, the <b>page</b> <b>count</b> went down to 156. It dropped again to 144 with the June 1949 issue, but rose to 160 from September 1949 to August 1950. The September 1950 issue had 148 pages, and all the remaining issues had 130 pages.|$|E
5|$|If was a digest-sized {{magazine}} {{throughout its}} life. It began at 164 pages {{and with only}} the fifth issue, November 1952, dropped to 124 pages. The <b>page</b> <b>count</b> increased again to 134 pages with the July 1959 issue, and to 164 pages with the September 1965 issue; it stayed at this length until the September–October 1970 issue. The <b>page</b> <b>count</b> was then increased to 180 with the June 1971 issue, and to 164 for the very last issue, December 1974. It was priced at 35 cents to begin with, and increased to 40 cents with the March 1963 issue, to 50 cents with the December 1964 issue, to 60 cents with the August 1967 issue, and finally to 75 cents with the September–October 1970 issue. With the April 1972 issue, UPD began using card stock for the covers, rather than paper, and continued to do so until the magazine ceased publication.|$|E
5|$|The first 28 {{issues were}} 166 pages long. The <b>page</b> <b>count</b> dropped to 134 with the April 1954 issue and stayed at that length for the {{remainder}} of the run. The cover layout initially strongly resembled that of Other Worlds but was changed with the fifth issue, June 1951, to have a white background banner for the title. This format was retained for the rest of the magazine's life, with occasional slight variations such as using a different color for the banner background. The spine also changed from a colored spine with pale lettering, which was similar to the spine style used by Other Worlds, to a white spine with red or blue lettering.|$|E

5|$|The {{magazine}} {{began as}} a 160-page digest, priced at 35 cents. The price stayed the same throughout the run, but the <b>page</b> <b>count</b> was cut to 128 for the eighth issue, September 1954. The magazine was bimonthly, but issues 9 and 10 did not carry month and year dates, which has led different bibliographers to catalogue them in different ways. However, the masthead for these issues indicates that the magazine remained bimonthly, {{and so they are}} now usually catalogued as November 1954 and January 1955, respectively; the copyright dates on the last two issues correspond to these dates. The volume numbering was completely regular; volume 1 had six numbers, and volume 2 ceased with its fourth number. The stories were printed in the two-column format usual to digest magazines.|$|E
5|$|Fantastic Universe {{published}} {{its first}} {{issue in the}} midst of this publishing boom. The issue, in digest format, was dated JuneJuly 1953, and was priced at 50 cents. This was higher than any of its competition, but it also had the highest <b>page</b> <b>count</b> in the field at the time, with 196 pages. The initial editorial team was Leo Margulies as publisher, and Sam Merwin as editor; this was a combination familiar to science fiction fans from their years together at Thrilling Wonder Stories, which Merwin edited from 1945 to 1951. The publisher, King-Size Publications, also produced The Saint Detective Magazine, which was popular, so Fantastic Universe enjoyed good distribution from the starta key factor in a magazine's success. The first issue included stories by Arthur C. Clarke, Philip K. Dick, and Ray Bradbury. According to Donald Tuck, the author of an early SF encyclopaedia, the magazine kept a fairly high quality through Merwin's departure after a year, and through the subsequent brief period of caretaker editorship by Beatrice Jones. Margulies took over the editor's post with the May 1954 issue.|$|E
5|$|Gernsback {{experimented with}} the price and format, looking for a {{profitable}} combination. Both Air Wonder and Science Wonder were bedsheet-sized (8.5 × 11.75 in, or 216 × 298mm) and priced at 25cents, as were the first issues of Wonder Stories. With the November 1930 issue Wonder Stories changed to pulp format, 6.75 × 9.9 in (171 × 251mm). It reverted to bedsheet after a year, and then in November 1933 became a pulp magazine for good. The pulp issues all had 144pages; the bedsheet issues generally had 96pages, though five issues from November 1932 to March 1933 had only 64pages. Those five issues coincided with a price cut to 15cents, which was reversed with the April 1933 issue. Gernsback cut the price to 15cents again from June 1935 until the sale to Beacon Publications in 1936, though this time he did not reduce the <b>page</b> <b>count.</b> The short duration of these price cuts suggests Gernsback rapidly realized that the additional circulation they gained him cost too much in lost revenue. Under Beacon Publications Thrilling Wonder remained pulp-sized throughout.|$|E

5|$|The new editor was Ejler Jakobsson, though Pohl {{continued}} to be listed as editor emeritus on the masthead until the July–August 1970 issue. Much of the editorial work was actually done by Judy-Lynn Benjamin, who was hired by Pohl in 1969 as an editorial assistant. The new regime failed to impress readers, and circulation dropped from over 67,000 for the year ending October 1968 to under 45,000 the following year, a drop of over 30%. If went bimonthly in May 1970, as Abramson attempted to juggle the frequency of publication of several of his titles to maximize profits; the <b>page</b> <b>count</b> and price were also adjusted more than once over the next year, again increasing profitability. Abramson also began a British distribution of If, reprinted with a separate cover, priced in British currency. Circulation figures of the time show an increase of about 6,000 copies, but if this includes sales in the UK is not clear.|$|E
5|$|There {{were nine}} {{issues in the}} first sequence, in one volume of six numbers and a second volume of three numbers. All issues in the first run were in pulp format and were priced at 15 cents. The first four issues were 128 pages; the next five were 112 pages. The title was Marvel Science Stories for five issues, then Marvel Tales for two issues, and then Marvel Stories {{for the last two}} issues of the first run. The {{publisher}} for the first series was listed as Postal Publications of Chicago for the first four issues, and as Western Publishing of New York and Chicago; in both cases the owner was Martin and Abraham Goodman. The intended schedule was bimonthly but this was never achieved. The editor was Robert O. Erisman. The second incarnation of the magazine lasted for six issues on a more regular quarterly schedule, starting in November 1950. The price was 25 cents and the <b>page</b> <b>count</b> was 128 pages for all six issues; the first two issues and last issue of this sequence were in pulp format, and the three from May 1951 to November 1951 were in digest format. The title returned to Marvel Science Stories for the first three issues of this series, and changed to Marvel Science Fiction for the last three issues. The publisher was listed as Stadium Publishing of New York; as with the first series, Martin and Abraham Goodman were the owners.|$|E

25|$|Henry Gray {{wrote the}} {{original}} version of Gray's Anatomy with an audience of medical students and physicians in mind, especially surgeons. For many decades however, precisely because Gray's textbook became such a classic, successive editors made major efforts to preserve its position as possibly the most authoritative text on the subject in English. Toward this end, a long-term strategy {{appears to have been}} to make each edition come close to containing a fully comprehensive account of the anatomical medical understanding available at the time of publication. Given the explosion of medical knowledge in the 20th century, it is easily appreciated that this led to a vast expansion of the book, which threatened to collapse under its own weight in a metaphorical and physical sense. From the 35th edition onward, increased efforts were made to reverse this trend and keep the book readable by students. Nevertheless, the 38th edition contained 2,092 pages in large format – the highest <b>page</b> <b>count</b> of any and an increase from the 35th edition, which had 1,471 pages.

5000|$|Although {{newspapers}} {{are most frequently}} published with <b>page</b> <b>counts</b> in multiples of four, {{it is possible to}} achieve other <b>page</b> <b>counts.</b> To do this, a sheet of paper with only one page on each side is added {{in the center of the}} newspaper.

40|$|Abstract: Measuring the {{semantic}} similarity between two words {{is an important}} component in various tasks on the web such as relation extraction, community mining, document clustering, and automatic meta-data extraction. Despite the usefulness of semantic similarity measures in these applications, accurately measuring semantic similarity between two words (or entities) remains a challenging task. We propose an empirical method to estimate semantic similarity using <b>page</b> <b>counts</b> and text snippets retrieved from a web search engine for two words. Specifically, we define various word co-occurrence measures using <b>page</b> <b>counts</b> and integrate those with lexical patterns extracted from text snippets. To identify the numerous semantic relations that exist between two given words, we propose a novel pattern extraction algorithm and a pattern clustering algorithm. The optimal combination of page counts-based co-occurrence measures and lexical pattern clusters is learned using support vector machines. The proposed method outperforms various baselines and previously proposed web-based semantic similarity measures on three benchmark data sets showing a high correlation with human ratings. Moreover, the proposed method significantly improves the accuracy in a community mining task...|$|R
