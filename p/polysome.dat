It was then discovered that SRP contained an RNA component. Comparing the SRP RNA genes from different species revealed helix 8 of the SRP RNA to be highly conserved in all domains of life. The regions near the 5'- and 3'-ends of the mammalian SRP RNA are similar to the dominant Alu family of middle repetitive sequences of the human genome. It is now understood that Alu DNA originated from SRP RNA by excision of the central SRP RNA-specific (S) fragment, followed by reverse transcription and integration into multiple sites of the human chromosomes. SRP RNAs have been identified also in some organelles, for example in the plastid SRPs of many photosynthetic organisms.|$|E

50|$|Ribosome profiling, or Ribo-Seq (also named Ribosome footprinting), is an {{adaptation}} of a technique developed by Joan Steitz and Marilyn Kozak almost 50 years ago that Nicholas Ingolia and Jonathan Weissman adapted to work with next generation sequencing that uses specialized messenger RNA (mRNA) sequencing to determine which mRNAs are being actively translated. It produces a “global snapshot” of all the ribosomes active in a cell at a particular moment, known as a translatome. Consequently, this enables researchers to identify the location of translation start sites, the complement of translated ORFs in a cell or tissue, the distribution of ribosomes on a messenger RNA, and the speed of translating ribosomes.
