25|$|Motivated by his {{personal}} experience with the disease, Ommaya focused {{on the problem of}} transplantation of islet cells for the treatment of diabetes. A major challenge facing survival of islet cells is immune rejection. Ommaya thought that the CSF would provide an ideal setting for transplanted islets due to the immune protection provided by the blood-brain barrier. He developed an artificial organ which would house transplanted islets, and the cells could be nourished by the CSF. Ayub, Illani Atwater, and colleagues identified that ventricular-peritoneal CSF shunts provided an immune <b>protected</b> <b>site</b> for the transplantation of mouse and rat islets in dogs and llamas. Ayub and colleagues also identified that CSF glucose mirrors blood glucose. Islets cells were able to survive in this system and function in the llama model, but further work on the model is needed.|$|E

It {{is part of}} the town historical centre and North-Central District. In the Centro histórico are the headquarters of the administrative powers {{of the city and the}} department. Socio-economically, this was the most important area until the 80's, when the centre's deterioration led to the displacement of formal trade and banking to the north of the city. Despite the decline, the Centre remains at the heart of the city and is the most representative and important sector in economic terms. There is an intense commercial activity at the public market. In addition, the centre hosts a number of buildings of the Republican period and structures of immense historical and architectural value. The Centro histórico of Barranquilla is a nationally <b>protected</b> <b>site</b> by the Ministry of Culture through resolution 1614 of 1999. Since the 90's, the historic center of Barranquilla is in the process of recovery, which was consolidated in 2008 with the Ministry of Culture's announcement for a public competition of urban design. At local government level, the development of Barranquilla centre is sponsored by the Promotora del Desarrollo del Distrito Central de Barranquilla S.A.

The Karanga-speaking Shona people live around Great Zimbabwe in the modern-day province of Masvingo.

500|$|At 06:35, Amphion {{struck a}} mine that detonated {{underneath}} her bridge. The explosion set her forecastle {{on fire and}} broke the ship's keel. The destroyer [...] attempted to tow the cruiser, but a deep crack across her upper deck showed that she was hogging badly and Fox ordered his crew to abandon ship. Shortly afterwards, her forward magazine exploded, throwing one 4-inch gun into the air that narrowly missed Linnet. One of Amphions shells burst {{on the deck of}} the destroyer , killing two of her men and the only German prisoner rescued from the cruiser. Amphion then rapidly sank within 15 minutes of the explosion losing 1 officer and 131 ratings killed in the sinking, plus an unknown number of the crew rescued from Königin Luise.

500|$|In August 1889, two amateur archaeologists, George Payne and A. A. Arnold, {{came across}} the monument, which they noted was known among locals as the [...] "Coldrum Stones" [...] and [...] "Druid Temple"; {{according}} to Payne, [...] "the huge stones were so overgrown with brambles and brushwood {{that they could not}} be discerned". He returned the next year, noting that the brushwood had since been cut away to reveal the megaliths. [...] In his 1893 book Collectanea Cantiana, Payne noted that although it had first been described in print in 1844, [...] "since that time no one seems to have taken the trouble to properly record them or make a plan", an unusual claim given that a copy of Petrie's published plan existed in his library. For this reason, after gaining permission from the landowner, he convinced Major A. O. Green, Instructor in Survey at Brompton, to conduct a survey of the monument in August 1892. He also wrote to the archaeologist Augustus Pitt-Rivers, encouraging him to schedule the Coldrum Stones as a legally <b>protected</b> <b>site</b> under the Ancient Monuments Protection Act 1882. Payne described the Coldrum Stones as [...] "the finest monument of its class in the county, and one worthy of every care and attention." [...] Comparing it to other monuments of its type in Britain, he stated that it was undoubtedly [...] "of sepulchral origin, belonging to a period anterior to the Roman domination of Britain." [...] Payne also noted a folk tradition that there were stone avenues connecting Coldrum to the Addington Long Barrow, although added that he was unable to discover any physical evidence of this feature.|$|E
