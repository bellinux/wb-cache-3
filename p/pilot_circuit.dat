50|$|The Honda CBX250RS was a {{motorcycle}} first sold by Honda in May 1983 in Japan as their new 250cc sports bike {{with a view}} to replacing the popular CB250RS. The engine was based on the XR series with particular links to the XR350 bottom end, including a six-speed gearbox and the same oil pump. The stroke is also the same, but the bore reduced to bring the capacity down to 249cc. The balance shaft was also discarded, with the engine instead being rubber mounted. Unlike any other XR engine the top was given two camshafts. The bike was also equipped with dual carburettors, only one of which was equipped with a <b>pilot</b> <b>circuit</b> and which open different amounts depending on how much the throttle is twisted.|$|E

40|$|The {{goal for}} this flight was {{to launch the}} {{aircraft}} and have the <b>pilot</b> fly <b>circuits</b> by commanding phi and theta angles via the sticks. Auto throttle ran the entire flight.

The approach guidance and tracker appeared to work flawlessly, so on the second pass we had the pilot engage the approach guidance and fly it to an altitude of about 10 - 12 feet AGL, when he engaged flare guidance, which reduces the descent rate to 0. 5 m/s, reduces speed to 15 m/s, and holds wings level. The automated approach and landing performed extremely well. Looking at the data our touchdown descent rate was around 1 m/s, airspeed 16 m/s, and slightly nose up.

40|$|In {{this study}} the {{feasibility}} of two mathematical models {{of the dynamics of}} a hydraulic bypass valve used on semi-active suspension systems for heavy vehicles is investigated. It is envisaged that similar models will eventually be incorporated into a full vehicle, three dimensional simulation study. The valve system contains an electro-hydraulic <b>pilot</b> valve <b>circuit,</b> a logic element, a damper and four check valves in a rectifier configuration. Models were compiled from first principles in the MATLAB environment and with the commercial fluid power simulation software, AMESim. The numerical methods used in the MATLAB model were found to be incapable of solving the stiff, nonlinear and discontinuous governing equations efficiently, while AMESim is very capable of handling detailed and complex fluid power models. Experimental work was conducted to determine certain steady state model parameters and to obtain dynamic performance data with which to validate model integrity. Several external factors influenced the valve behaviour during experiments making data extraction challenging. Simple first order assumptions accounting for the external influences on the valve therefore had {{to be included in the}} models. If this is done the basic dynamic behaviour of the valve system is matched well by the models. In general, the number of unknown parameters associated with fluid power systems accounted for the largest portion of the error between the simulated and measured response. The model as developed proved the possibility of creating highly accurate models but also indicated the amount of effort needed for their compilation.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Objective of the Shell Solar CIS {{thin film}} {{development}} is a high performance, high quality module product to be processed in a profitable production line. At the Shell Solar central R&D facility in Munich we develop the 2 nd generation CIS modules on 30 x 30 cm 2 and 60 x 90 cm 2 substrate formats. The key features are sputter deposition of a Cu-In-Ga-Se precursor, controlled sodium doping and rapid thermal processing (RTP) in a sulfur containing ambient, sputter ZnO window layers and a low-cost frameless module package. For process control {{at an early stage}} in-line metrology tools such as photoluminescence lifetime measurements, Raman spectroscopy, and infrared thermography have been implemented in the pilot line. Aperture area efficiency of 30 x 30 cm 2 standard <b>pilot</b> line <b>circuits</b> is 12. 3 % with tight distribution and peak module efficiencies of 13. 4 %. We recently started routine processing of 60 x 90 cm 2 modules. The aperture area efficiencies of the 60 x 90 line average at 12. 5 % resulting in a total average output power of 60 Wp per module. A first 1. 4 kW array was installed on the Munich-site for the evaluation of outdoor performance. Reliability, durability and climate stability of our frame-less glass-glass package is demonstrated following the IEC 61646 protocol, i. e. damp-heat, thermal cycling, humidity-freeze, insulation, wet leakage current, wind load and insulation testing. Aiming at the replacement of Cd from product and production two approaches are developed: a) Chemical bath deposition of Zn(S,OH) compound layers yields 13. 2 % efficiency on cells and 10. 5 % on 30 x 30 cm 2 modules. b) Using (Zn,Mg) O sputter deposition, thereby omitting wet-chemical processes, efficiencies of 11. 7 % (cell) and 9. 1 % (30 x 30 % module) have been achieved so far...|$|R

Evaluation of different media types and their attendant systems for recovery, concentration, and regeneration is to be completed. Phase I, media evaluation, now completed involved a paper study {{and a number of}} laboratory tests to eliminate all but the best media options. Phase II, media testing, involved detailed testing of the more promising media and separators in a closed-loop <b>pilot</b> facility <b>circuit.</b> In the final phase, Phase III, it is proposed to test individual components of the process using the optimum medium, separator, and medium recovery systems(s) selected in prior phases. Some of the highlights for this reporting period are: (1) Outomec conducted a second set of hot water wash experiments.

Starting with a dilute medium density of 1. 07, the Rochem laboratory system achieved a density of 1. 11. A density of 1. 22 sg would be commercially attainable. This is less than the target medium density of 1. 35, meaning that if their system were utilized, some thermal means would still be required to regenerate medium to operating density.

40|$|Computer {{simulation}} of ball mill cicuits {{has been found}} to be very valuable for optimisation where existing plant data can be used to calibrate the mathematical models used. However, as by definition no existing plant is available for calibration in greenfield scenarios, the use of simulation in ball mill circuit design has been limited. Running a <b>pilot</b> ball mill <b>circuit</b> can overcome this problem but this requires a reasonably large sample and therefore can be costly. In addition a valid scale-up procedure is required. To overcome these limitations in using modelling and simulation for designing ball mill circuits, a programme of research was initiated at the JKMRC in which it was proposed to use laboratory ball mill test results to calibrate a suitable ball mill mathematical model for use in predicting full scale plant performance. To validate the technique, laboratory tests were conducted on a range of ore samples from existing plants, whose ball mill circuits were surveyed. The model, which was derived from the laboratory test results was then used to predict the full scale plants 2 ̆ 7 performance.

40|$|Grinding of clinker is {{the last}} and most energy-consuming stage of the cement {{manufacturing}} process, drawing on average 40 % of the total energy required to produce one ton of cement. During this stage, the clinker particles are substantially reduced in size to generate {{a certain level of}} fineness as it has a direct influence on such performance characteristics of the final product as rate of hydration, water demand, strength development, and other. The grinding objectives tying together the energy and fineness requirements were formulated based on a review {{of the state of the}} art of clinker grinding and numerical simulation employing the Markov chain theory. The literature survey revealed that not only the specific surface of the final product, but also the shape of its particle size distribution (PSD) is responsible for the cement performance characteristics. While it is feasible to engineer the desired PSD in the laboratory, the process-specific recommendations on how to generate the desired PSD in the industrial mill are not available. Based on a population balance principle and stochastic representation of the particle movement within the grinding system, the Markov chain model for the circuit consisting of a tube ball mill and a high efficiency separator was introduced through the matrices of grinding and classification. The grinding matrix was calculated using the selection and breakage functions, whereas the classification matrix was defined from the Tromp curve of the separator. The results of field experiments carried out at a pilot cement plant were used to identify the model's parameters. The retrospective process data pertaining to the operation of the <b>pilot</b> grinding <b>circuit</b> was employed to validate the model and define the process constraints. Through numerical simulation, the relationships between the controlled (fresh feed rate; separator cut size) and observed (fineness characteristics of cement; production rate; specific energy consumption) parameters of the circuit were defined. The analysis of the simulation results allowed formulation of the process control procedures with the objectives of decreasing the specific energy consumption of the mill, maintaining the targeted specific surface area of the final product, and governing the shape of its PSD...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results from}} tests in a flame tube facility, where a bio-derived alternate fuel was compared with JP- 8 for emissions and general combustion performance. A research version of General Electric Aviation (GE) TAPS injector {{was used for}} the tests. Results include combustion efficiency from gaseous emission measurements, 2 D planar laser-based imaging as well as basic flow visualization of the flame. Four inlet test conditions were selected that simulate various engine power conditions relevant to NASA Fundamental Aeronautics Supersonics Project and Environmentally Responsible Aviation Program. One inlet condition was a pilot-only test point. The other three inlet conditions incorporated fuel staging via a split between the <b>pilot</b> and main <b>circuits</b> of either 10 %/ 90 % or 20 %/ 80 %. For each engine power condition, three fuel mixes were used: 100 % JP- 8; 100 % alternative; and a blend of the two, containing 75 % alternative. Results for the inlet cases that have fuel split between pilot and main, indicate that fuel from the pilot appears to be evaporated by the time it reaches the dome exit. Main circuit liquid evaporates within a downstream distance equal to annulus height, no matter the fuel. Some fuel fluorescence images for a 10 %/ 90 % fuel staging case show a distinct difference between JP- 8 and bio-derived fuel. OH PLIF results indicate that OH forms in a region more centrally-located for the JP- 8 case downstream of the pilot, in its central recirculation region (CRZ). For the bio-derived Hydrotreated Renewable Jet (HRJ) fuel, however, we do not see much OH in the CRZ. The OH image structure near the dome exit is similar for the two fuels, but farther downstream the OH in the CRZ is much more apparent for the JP- 8 than for the alternate fuel. For all conditions, there was no discernable difference between fuel types in combustion efficiency or emissions...|$|R
