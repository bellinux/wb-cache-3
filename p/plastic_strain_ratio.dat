40|$|ASTM {{standards}} {{are widely used}} to determine the <b>plastic</b> <b>strain</b> <b>ratio</b> r to characterize the normal anisotropy and the planar anisotropy of sheet metal. The values determined by mechanical testing are quoted at a strain of 15 %. These are used for comparing two techniques of measuring the <b>plastic</b> <b>strain</b> <b>ratio</b> or the anisotropy of two materials. The present work reports the variation in the <b>plastic</b> <b>strain</b> <b>ratio</b> of prestrained material. The r values of biaxially prestrained steel sheet have been investigated using the ASTM as well as the magnetostrictive methods of measurement. An error analysis on the mechanical measurements has been performed to examine the agreement between the different definitions of the <b>plastic</b> <b>strain</b> <b>ratio</b> (r(r), r(int), r(t), and r(mxi)) and the accuracy (based on coefficient of variation), in view of the need to measure the <b>plastic</b> <b>strain</b> <b>ratio</b> at low strain levels. Various means to ensure accuracy in measurement are described. <b>Plastic</b> <b>strain</b> <b>ratio</b> of sheet deformed to different biaxial prestrains has also been characterized using the magnetostrictive method (Modul r test). It is found that the difference between the r values determined using the ASTM and the Modul r methods changes with strain and strain path. The nominal difference between the two methods was found to be comparatively consistent over strain paths ranging from plane strain to equibiaxial tension. The Modul r values for prestrains along these strain paths investigated were found to be relatively consistent and hence usable. For prestrain along the strain path beta = - 0. 45 (negative minor strain regime), the nominal difference was considerable. In view of the above, it is not appropriate to measure rapidly the r value of the material in the negative minor strain regime, in particular using magnetostrictive means, and to correct it using the "systematic error" between the two techniques. This restricts the usability of the Modul r test in measuring the <b>plastic</b> <b>strain</b> <b>ratio</b> of deformed sheet metal, particularly after a prestrain in the negative minor strain region...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{predict the}} effect of texture on the {{anisotropy}} in plastic properties of polycrystalline metallic sheets. The constituent grain behavior is modelled using the new single crystal yield criterion developed by Cazacu, Revil, and Chandola (2017). For ideal texture components, the yield stress and <b>plastic</b> <b>strain</b> <b>ratios</b> can be obtained analytically. For the case of strongly textured sheets containing a spread about the ideal texture components, the polycrystalline response is obtained numerically {{on the basis of}} the same single-crystal criterion. It is shown that for textures with misorientation scatter width up to 25 degrees, the numerical predictions are very close to those obtained analytically for an ideal texture. Furthermore, irrespective of the number of grains in the sample, Lankford coefficients have finite values for all loading orientations. Illustrative examples for sheets with textures containing a combination of few ideal texture components are also presented. The simulations of the predicted polycrystalline behavior based on the new description of the plastic behavior of the constituent grains capture the influence of individual texture components on the overall degree of anisotropy. The polycrystalline simulation results are also compared to analytical estimates obtained using the closed-form formulas for the ideal components present in the texture in conjunction with a simple law of mixtures. The analytical estimates show the same trends as the simulation results. Therefore, the trends in plastic anisotropy of the macroscopic properties can be adequately estimated analytically.

This Master’s thesis indicates that Ti-stabilized IF steel substrates are more reactive than dual-stabilized IF steel substrates probably due to the presence of islands of Nb oxides at the interface between the steel substrate and the GA coating. These Nb oxides may block the Fe-Zn interdiffusion along the ferrite grain boundaries. Hence, higher reactivity rates for Ti-stabilized IF steel grades mean that this substrate is more prone than a dual-stabilized IF steel to the formation of outbursts and consequently the formation of craters, which are morphologically characterized as clusters of outbursts, whose formation mechanisms are based on capillarity effects accounting for amounts of liquid Zn being drained away from these spots. Besides, this work has also explored the typical chemistry and morphology features of craters on top of dark and light streaked areas on GA coatings, showing that there are d crystals on the bottom of craters on light streaked areas, whereas G phase was found on the bottom of craters on dark streaked areas. Also, it turns out that craters on dark streaked regions are deeper than those on light streaked areas.

Deep {{drawing of}} metal {{sheeting}} is a commercially significant manufacturing process and {{as with all}} metal forming processes is subject to geometric defects. One defect of particular concern, termed earing, is characterised by an uneven edge to the drawn article. This work covers {{the implementation of a}} suitable constitutive model in a general purpose finite element code ABAQUS Version 5. 4 to simulate this earing phenomenon in aluminium can body stock. Earing is caused by plastic anisotropy of the blank material and anisotropy induced during the drawing process. It is the result of crystallographic textures or preferred grain orientations that develop during the sheet rolling process. In polycrystalline materials it may be modelled via either crystallographic texture models or phenomenological yield surface models. Crystallographic models have the advantage over phenomenological ones in that they are able to describe both initial and evolving anisotropy. However, they are very demanding in terms of computational power and are reported to over predict the <b>plastic</b> <b>strain</b> <b>ratios</b> in anisotropic materials. A phenomenological yield surface model proposed by Karafillis and Boyce was consequently selected as a suitable constitutive model to investigate the earing phenomenon. This model can describe the elasto-plastic behaviour of both isotropic and anisotropic three dimensional polycrystalline materials. It is a pressure independent yield surface which is convex in stress space and assumes an associated flow rule. It was implemented in ABAQUS as a FORTRAN 77 User-Material Subroutine. An Euler Backward integration scheme was adopted and a consistent tangent modulus used. Four axisymmetric cupping operations were simulated: two with the model's parameters set to represent the aluminium alloy under consideration and two to investigate the effect of the yield surface on earing.

Internal and effective components of the flow stress are analyzed using Handfield and Dickson's method. The internal stress {{is affected by the}} <b>plastic</b> <b>strain</b> amplitude. Conversely, the evolution of the athermal component of the effective stress with the number of cycles is independent of the <b>plastic</b> <b>strain</b> amplitude. The thermal part of the effective stress increases with the <b>plastic</b> <b>strain</b> amplitude, but remains constant with <b>plastic</b> <b>strain</b> accumulation. Microstructural changes in the cyclically deformed material are investigated by means of transmission electronic mycroscopy and X-Ray characterizations. Internal and effective stress evolutions are discussed based on these observation...|$|R
