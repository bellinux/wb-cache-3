For this purpose, we exploit the connection between factor models and DAGs to propose Bayesian hierarchies based on spike and slab <b>priors</b> <b>to</b> promote sparsity, heavy-tailed <b>priors</b> <b>to</b> ensure identifiability and predictive densities to perform the model comparison. We require identifiability {{to be able to}} produce variable orderings leading to valid DAGs and sparsity to learn the structures. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through extensive experiments on artificial and biological data showing that our approach outperform a number of state of the art methods. ...|$|R

To illustrate the robust Bayesian approach, we apply this methodology in a popular example: "the clement problem". Finally, we recommend to use the Cauchy prior in absence or presence of outliers within the small areas and the Fuquene et al. (2011) prior when the outlier is a particular small area.

40|$|We {{consider}} that observations {{come from a}} general normal linear model {{and that it is}} desirable to test a simplifying null hypothesis about the parameters. We approach this problem from an objective Bayesian, model-selection perspective. Crucial ingredients for this approach are 'proper objective priors' to be used for deriving the Bayes factors. Jeffreys-Zellner-Siow priors have good properties for testing null hypotheses defined by specific values of the parameters in full-rank linear models. We extend these <b>priors</b> <b>to</b> deal with general hypotheses in general linear models, not necessarily of full rank. The resulting priors, which we call 'conventional priors', are expressed as a generalization of recently introduced 'partially informative distributions'. The corresponding Bayes factors are fully automatic, easily computed and very reasonable. The methodology is illustrated for the change-point problem and the equality of treatments effects problem. We compare the conventional priors derived for these problems with other objective Bayesian proposals like the intrinsic priors. It is concluded that both priors behave similarly although interesting subtle differences arise. We adapt the conventional <b>priors</b> <b>to</b> deal with nonnested model selection as well as multiple-model comparison. Finally, we briefly address a generalization of conventional <b>priors</b> <b>to</b> nonnormal scenarios. Copyright 2007, Oxford University Press. ...|$|R
