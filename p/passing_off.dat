5|$|Sales of ReaLemon {{realized}} successful {{profits in}} Europe in 1975, {{at which time}} Borden expanded into the United Kingdom market, purveying a 250 ml bottle of lemon juice. By 1980, ReaLemon comprised around 25% of the U.K. lemon juice market. In response to this competition, Reckitt & Coleman began producing Jif in 150 ml- and 250 ml-sized bottles. Borden then began making plans to market ReaLemon in a lemon-shaped package that was similar to Jif's packaging. This resulted in a lawsuit initiated by Reckitt & Coleman against Borden, based upon the notion that ReaLemon was attempting to copy Jif's packaging in attempts to mislead consumers, by <b>passing</b> <b>off</b> their product as Jif.|$|E
5|$|Enraged by this, and by {{accusations of}} fraudulently <b>passing</b> <b>off</b> foreign moths as British, Cribb gave up {{collecting}} {{and left the}} rest of the specimens with his landlady as security for a debt. Here the stories from Manchester University and The Australian Museum, Victoria differ as to whether it was Cribb's pub landlady or the landlady of his lodgings, but either way the result was the same. The debt was not paid on time and when Cribb went back for the moths, which he had already sold to another collector, his landlady had burnt them. Subsequent efforts by other collectors to find more of the moths were unsuccessful, and the three specimens left in existence are thought to be the only representatives of an extinct species.|$|E
5|$|The Tang {{capital was}} the largest {{city in the world}} at its time, the {{population}} of the city wards and its suburban countryside reaching 2 million inhabitants. The Tang capital was very cosmopolitan, with ethnicities of Persia, Central Asia, Japan, Korea, Vietnam, Tibet, India, and many other places living within. Naturally, with this plethora of different ethnicities living in Chang'an, there were also many different practiced religions, such as Buddhism, Nestorian Christianity, Manichaeism, Zoroastrianism, Judaism, and Islam being practiced within. With widely open access to China that the Silk Road to the west facilitated, many foreign settlers were able to move east to China, while the city of Chang'an itself had about 25,000 foreigners living within. Exotic green-eyed, blonde-haired Tocharian ladies serving wine in agate and amber cups, singing, and dancing at taverns attracted customers. If a foreigner in China pursued a Chinese woman for marriage, he was required to stay in China and was unable to take his bride back to his homeland, as stated in a law passed in 628 to protect women from temporary marriages with foreign envoys. Several laws enforcing segregation of foreigners from Chinese were passed during the Tang dynasty. In 779 the Tang dynasty issued an edict which forced Uighurs in the capital, Chang'an, to wear their ethnic dress, stopped them from marrying Chinese females, and banned them from <b>passing</b> <b>off</b> as Chinese.|$|E

However, seeing that O'Toole was killed after being mistaken for her, Tiffany changes her mind. She drives Bond to the airport, where the diamonds are given to Whyte's casino manager, Bert Saxby, who is followed to a remote facility. Bond enters the apparent destination of the diamonds: a research laboratory owned by Whyte, where a satellite is being built by Professor Metz, a laser refraction specialist. Bond fakes Metz by telling him he is Klaus Hergersheimer, a technician he met in the facility. His cover is blown when the real Hergersheimer shows up. Bond attempts to remain hidden, but is seen by a technician. He manages to evade the security guards by stealing a moon buggy and reunites with Tiffany. The laboratory report Bond's activity to the sheriff's office. Bond and Tiffany make {{their way back to}} Las Vegas; they are seen there by the Las Vegas police, who engage in a car chase, but Bond manages to evade all the cars.|$|E
25|$|If a {{trademark}} {{has not been}} registered, some jurisdictions (especially Common Law countries) offer protection for the business reputation or goodwill which attaches to unregistered trademarks through the tort of <b>passing</b> <b>off.</b> <b>Passing</b> <b>off</b> may provide a remedy in a scenario where a business has been trading under an unregistered trademark for many years, and a rival business starts using the same or a similar mark.|$|E

25|$|The {{process by}} which {{trademark}} rights are diminished or lost {{as a result of}} common use in the marketplace is known as genericization. This process typically occurs {{over a period of time}} in which a mark is not used as a trademark (i.e., where it is not used to exclusively identify the products or services of a particular business), where a mark falls into disuse entirely, or where the trademark owner does not enforce its rights through actions for <b>passing</b> <b>off</b> or trademark infringement.|$|E
25|$|Protected {{indications}} {{are treated as}} intellectual property rights by the Customs Regulation 1383/2003 (Regulation concerning customs action against goods suspected of infringing certain intellectual property rights and the measures to be taken against goods found to have infringed such rights), and infringing goods may be seized by customs on import. Within the European Union, enforcement measures vary: infringement may be treated as counterfeit, misleading advertising, <b>passing</b> <b>off</b> or even as a question of public health. Outside Europe, the protection of PGS products usually require bilateral agreements between the EU and the importing countries, while protected indications may not always supersede other intellectual property rights such as trademarks.|$|E

25|$|Also in 1999, Novatek, a Provo, UT {{manufacturer}} of industrial diamonds {{known for its}} advancements in diamond synthesis, accidentally discovered that the color of diamonds could be changed by the HPHT process. The company formed NovaDiamond, Inc. to market the process. By applying heat and pressure to natural stones, NovaDiamond could turn brown Type I diamonds light yellow, greenish yellow, or yellowish green; improve Type IIa diamonds by several color grades, even to white; intensify the color of yellow Type I diamonds; and make some bluish gray Type I and Type IIb colorless (although in some cases natural bluish gray diamonds are more valuable left alone, as blue is a highly desired hue). In 2001, however, NovaDiamond quit the HPHT gem business because of what the company's leader, David Hall, characterized as the underhanded practices of dealers. Apparently, dealers were <b>passing</b> <b>off</b> NovaDiamond enhanced gems as naturally colored, and the company refused to be party to this deception.|$|E
25|$|The {{two most}} common {{themes in the}} Linares' work are the {{animated}} skeleton and the alebrije. Both {{are based on the}} forms and techniques used to make Judas figures and there are early works by the families of human Judas figures with animal heads and wings. According to the family, Pedro Linares came up with the concept of alebrijes as a young man sick in bed with a high fever, dreaming of them and the name. After he became well again, he began to create the monsters he saw in his dreams. Despite the story, Pedro Linares himself admitted that the creatures evolved over his lifetime. These creatures are often a composite of various real and imaginary animals painted in bright colors and wild designs. The creating of these creatures soon spread to Celaya and then into the state of Oaxaca, where there are carved from wood rather than shaped from paper products. Examples of these creatures can be found in various museums in Mexico including the Museo Casa Estudio Diego Rivera y Frida Kahlo as well as the Museo de Arte Popular in Mexico City. The grand scale of imitation has had its benefits and drawbacks. Since their invention, alebrijes have morphed into more contemporary forms with images from rock stars, superheroes and more. Daniel Barrera is a known cartonería artist from Ciudad Nezahualcoyotl. His alebrije works tend to be based on popular culture, especially rock bands such as Judas Priest as well as the alebrije tradition. However, the family notes that there is a serious problem with other artists <b>passing</b> <b>off</b> their wares as from the Linares family.|$|E

500|$|... "The Jif Lemon case" [...] {{occurred}} in the 1980s, whereby The U.S. company Borden introduced lemon juice packaged in a similar plastic container to the United Kingdom.

500|$|Over {{the course}} of a ten-month period from mid-1955 to early 1956 more than six million of the plastic juice lemons were sold by Coldcrops. This {{initially}} began under the brand name [...] "Realemon", and then after an objection by the then Board of Trade, the name was changed to [...] "ReaLem" [...] and marketed with the slogan [...] "juice in a jiffy". The Board of Trade objected because it was perceived that Coldcrops was possibly <b>passing</b> <b>off</b> their product as the Realemon brand from the United States. During this same time period, Hax was marketing tomato ketchup and brown sauce in custom-shaped plastic containers, for use on restaurant tables. After a long argument about plastic containers, the two companies agreed that they would not compete with one-another, and Coldcrops took the marketing rights for plastic lemons under the ReaLem brand. Coldcrops would market ReaLem lemon juice and agreed to not enter other plastic container markets.|$|E
500|$|Whether {{or not a}} work is {{attributed}} to the wrong person depends on, according to Clark v Associated Newspapers, [...] "the single meaning which... the work conveys to the notional reasonable reader". There {{is no need to}} prove that the false attribution caused any harm to the actual author, and the right has been interpreted to cover situations as diverse as a newspaper parody of Alan Clark's diaries, an interview with Dorothy Squires and a replica painting that contained the signature of the original author. The right is closely linked to <b>passing</b> <b>off,</b> defamation and other non-statutory causes of action, which may be used to supplement a claim for infringing the right to object to false attribution. David Vaver, writing in the International Journal of Law and Information Technology, goes as {{far as to say that}} the right to object to false attribution is merely [...] "passing off, writ large". Cornish, Llewelyn and Aplin also note a strong overlap between the rights against false attribution and against derogatory treatment.|$|E
