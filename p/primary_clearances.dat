40|$|Graduation date: 1982 Characteristics of {{bacterial}} clearance were investigated in the purple sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus (Echinodermata: Echinoidea). <b>Primary</b> <b>clearance</b> kinetics were determined for three bacteria, a marine Gram negative motile rod, a marine Gram positive non-motile rod, {{and a fresh}} water fish pathogen, Aeromonas salmonicida. Various doses of live bacteria were injected into the perivisceral coelom of urchins, and coelomic fluid samples were removed for viable counts. Clearance of the two marine bacteria occurred in two stages. Reduction in viable counts was rapid and exponential during the first 90 min, followed by a period of slower clearance. The two bacteria exhibited similar clearance rates during the first 90 min, however the Gram positive bacteria were subsequently cleared more slowly than the Gram negative. Clearance of A. salmonicida was linear and not in two stages, although the initial rate of clearance was much {{lower than that of}} the marine bacteria. Attempts were made to determine whether a memory or inducible component exists in S. purpuratus' response to bacteria. After the kinetics of <b>clearance</b> of <b>primary</b> injections had been determined, the same urchins were challenged with a second injection of bacteria (9, 14, and 21 days after primary injections for the two marine bacteria, 19 days for A. salmonicida). The secondary clearance rates were not significantly different from the <b>primary</b> <b>clearance</b> rates for any of the three test bacteria. The cell-free coeloraic fluid of S. purpuratus was tested in vitro for bacterial agglutination and bactericidal activity against the two marine bacteria. Declines in viable counts of bacteria were observed with both bacteria in coelomic fluid, while viable counts in sea water controls did not change. Neither previous injection of urchins with bacteria nor prior heating of coelomic fluids (100 °C, 10 min) significantly altered the viable counts. It is not clear from these experiments whether the declines in viable counts were due to bacteria killing or agglutination. However, when the coelomic fluid was tested, agglutination was not observed with either of the bacteria. The cellular responses of the urchins were also investigated.

While most lymph node Chlamydia-specific CD 4 T cells expressed T-bet, a small percentage co-expressed Foxp 3, and RORct-expressing T cells were enriched within the reproductive tract. Local Chlamydia-specific CD 4 T cell priming was markedly reduced in mice lacking B cells, and bacteria were able to disseminate to the peritoneal cavity, initiating a cellular infiltrate and ascites. However, bacterial dissemination also coincided with elevated systemic Chlamydia-specific CD 4 T cell responses and resolution of primary infection.

In this study, the excretions of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) in male Sprague-Dawley rats gavaged consecutively for 28 days were investigated and compared. The faster elimination rate in urine compared to feces indicated that urinary excretion is the <b>primary</b> <b>clearance</b> route in rats for either PFOA or PFOS. During the first 24 h after administration of PFOA (5 and 20 mg/kg body weight/day), about 24. 7 - 29. 6 % of the oral dose was excreted through urine and feces, while for PFOS, the excretion amounts were only 2. 6 - 2. 8 % of the total gavaged doses (5 and 20 mg/kg body weight/day).

40|$|High voltage {{direct current}} (HVDC) grid {{protection}} must clear dc faults within a time-frame of milliseconds to avoid damages to power electronic components due to fast rising dc fault currents. If the breaker {{associated with the}} primary protection fails, backup must be provided to clear the faults which would otherwise persist. Backup relaying algorithms originally developed for ac systems delay the detection of primary protection failure until the expected <b>primary</b> fault <b>clearance</b> instant. Application of similar algorithms to HVDC grids results in a long fault clearing time, which requires converters and breakers to withstand unrealistically large currents. To reduce the fault clearing time, this paper proposes two fast backup relaying algorithms which detect local and remote breaker failure before the expected <b>primary</b> fault <b>clearance</b> instant. The proposed algorithms use thresholds on the voltage and current measurements to detect breaker failure. They are evaluated using a four-terminal HVDC grid test system implemented in PSCAD. The study {{results show that the}} proposed algorithms can reliably detect breaker failure within few milliseconds after fault inception. Furthermore, the algorithms provide faster backup protection compared to methods based on ac backup protection philosophy.

Prevention of death occurred {{in spite of the}} fact that the adverse effects of TNF-alpha were well underway in the mouse model. The half-life of DTPA iron (III) was 51 +/- 9 min in normal baboons; <b>primary</b> <b>clearance</b> was consistent with glomerular filtration.

Furthermore, exaggerated production of nitric oxide was attenuated. The mechanism of protection with DTPA iron (III) is not obvious. Because of its ability to interact in vitro with free radicals, its poor cell permeability, and its short half-life, we postulate that DTPA iron (III) and/or its reduced form may have protected the mice and baboons by sequestration and subsequent elimination of free radicals (including nitric oxide) from their systems...|$|R

CD 40 ligand (CD 40 L) is upregulated on activated CD 4 T cells, and {{it is thought that}} CD 40 -CD 40 L interactions are an important component of CD 4 T-cell help. Our previous studies have shown that agonistic antibodies to CD 40 can substitute for CD 4 T-cell function in the long-term control of MHV- 68. In the present study, we sought to identify the CD 40 -positive cell type mediating this effect. To address this question, we adoptively transferred MHV- 68 peptide-pulsed CII−/− dendritic cells (DC) that had been treated with an agonistic antibody to CD 40 into MHV- 68 -infected CII−/− recipients. Viral reactivation was significantly lower in mice injected with anti-CD 40 -treated DC than in those injected with control DC or in mice that did not receive any DC. However, in similar experiments with B cells, anti-CD 40 treatment had no effect. We also investigated the requirement for CD 40 expression on T cells by adoptive transfer of T cells from CD 40 +/+ or CD 40 −/− mice into T-cell-deficient recipients that were subsequently infected with MHV- 68. The results showed that CD 40 expression on T cells is not necessary for preventing viral reactivation.

40|$|The human {{hyaluronic acid}} (HA) {{receptor}} for endocytosis (HARE/ stabilin- 2) is the <b>primary</b> <b>clearance</b> receptor for systemic HA, chondroitin sulfates, and heparin, {{but not for}} heparan sulfate or keratan sulfate (Harris EN, Weigel JA, Weigel PH. J Biol Chem 283 : 17341 – 17350, 2008). HARE is expressed in the sinusoidal endothelial cells (SECs) of liver and lymph nodes where it acts as a scavenger for uptake and degradation of glycosaminoglycans, both as free chains and proteoglycan fragments. Unfractionated heparin (UFH; ~ 14 kDa) and low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH; ~ 4 kDa) are commonly used in treatments for thrombosis and cancer and in surgical and dialysis procedures. The reported half-lives of UFH and LMWH in the blood are ~ 1 h and 2 – 6 h, respectively. In this study, we demonstrate that anti-HARE antibodies specifically block the uptake of LMWH and UFH by isolated rat liver SECs and by human 293 cells expressing recombinant human HARE (hHARE). hHARE has a significant affinity (Kd = 10 μM) for LMWH, and higher affinity (Kd = 0. 06 μM) for the larger UFH. Rat liver SECs or cells expressing the recombinant 190 -kDa HARE isoform internalized both UFH and LMWH, and both heparins cross-compete with each other, suggesting that they share the same binding sites. These cellular results were confirmed in ELISA-like assays using purified soluble 190 -hHARE ectodomain. We conclude that both UFH and LMWH are cleared by HARE/Stab 2 and that {{the differences in the}} affinities of HARE binding to LMWH and UFH likely explain the longer in vivo circulating half-life of LMWH compared with UFH...|$|R

Differential cell counts revealing greater than 96 % macrophages and less than 1 % neutrophils and lymphocytes excluded inflammatory cell responses. Employing energy-filtering transmission electron microscopy (EFTEM) for elemental microanalysis, we examined 1, 594 macrophage profiles in the 1 -hour group (n = 6) and 1, 609 in the 24 -hour group (n = 6). We found 4 particles in 3 macrophage profiles at 1 hour and 47 particles in 27 macrophage profiles at 24 hours. Model-based data analysis revealed an uptake of 0. 06 to 0. 12 % ultrafine titanium-dioxide particles by lung-surface macrophages within 24 hours. Mean (SD) particle diameters were 31 (8) nm at 1 hour and 34 (10) nm at 24 hours. Particles were localized adjacent (within 13 - 83 nm) to the membrane in vesicles with mean (SD) diameters of 592 (375) nm at 1 hour and 414 (309) nm at 24 hours, containing other material like surfactant. Additional screening of macrophage profiles by conventional TEM revealed no evidence for agglomerated nanoparticles.

40|$|SummaryDefective {{neutrophils}} {{in patients}} with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) cause susceptibility to extracellular and intracellular infections. Microbes must first be ejected from intracellular niches to expose them to neutrophil attack, so we hypothesized that inflammasomes detect certain CGD pathogens upstream of neutrophil killing.

Caspase- 1 protected via two parallel pathways that eliminated intracellular replication niches. Pyroptosis was the <b>primary</b> bacterial <b>clearance</b> mechanism in the spleen, but both pyroptosis and interleukin- 18 (IL- 18) -driven natural killer (NK) cell responses were required for liver defense. NK cells cleared hepatocyte replication niches via perforin-dependent cytotoxicity, whereas interferon-γ was not required. These insights suggested a therapeutic approach: exogenous IL- 18 restored perforin-dependent cytotoxicity during infection by the inflammasome-evasive bacterium Listeria monocytogenes. Therefore, inflammasomes can trigger complementary programmed cell death mechanisms, directing sterilizing immunity against intracellular bacterial pathogens...|$|R
40|$|The common {{method used}} for the {{determination}} of phenotyping of drug-metabolizing enzymes in vivo is using the parent compound depletion curve method to obtain the total clearance (CLt) under first-order (linear) conditions. CLt indirectly reflected the intrinsic clearance (CLint), a parameter representing the metabolic enzymes (or/and transporters) activity. However, such total clearance is the surrogate of the catalytic activity of a certain enzyme (CLint,met) only under these limitations: ① hepatic metabolism is the <b>primary</b> <b>clearance</b> pathway; ② hepatic clearance (CLh) is enzyme-capacity limited rather than blood-flow limited; ③ hepatic uptake is not a rate-limiting step in the elimination. An alternative approach was suggested where the CLint is substituted for the approximate maximal initial formation rate (Vmax, app) of a specific reaction metabolite in vivo, which can accurately reflect the specific enzyme activity and exclude other enzyme and non-metabolism factors. In contrast to the traditional method, this novel method {{is in need of}} saturated substrate concentration (≥ 5 Km generally) to acheive zero-order (non-linear) conditions. Our previous data have demonstrated the deoxyschizandrin (DS) was selectively metabolized to schizandrin (SZ) by CYP 3 A in human and rat. Applying the Vmax, app determination method, zero-order SZ formation kinetic period of 10 ~ 60 min in perfusate can be found at saturated substrate concentrations (40 ~ 85 μM) with recirculating perfused rat livers. In addition, albumin added to the perfusate did not affect the Vmax, app, in situ. In vivo results indicated that linear formation of SZ in plasma can be measured up to 15 ~ 25 min after intravenous administration of DS (5, 10, 25 mg/kg). Excellent correlation was observed among Vmax, in vitro (54. 89 ± 4. 24 nM/min) with rat liver microsomes, Vmax, app, in situ (63. 4 ± 6. 78 nM/min) with perfused rat livers and Vmax, app, in vivo (63. 48 ± 6. 58 nM/min) with rat. We speculated that at least two blood samples would be needed to determine the Vmax, app in vivo. In conclusion, a simple sampling strategy using DS as a probe was developed to assess activity of CYP 3 A in vivo. 伊斯坦布...|$|R

40|$|Oxidative {{stress and}} its damage {{resulting}} in carbonylation of proteins {{is known to}} take place in the CNS tissue of multiple sclerosis patients and of mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), and has been implicated in the pathophysiology of these diseases. In order to investigate the possible consequences of this protein damage during acute myelin basic protein (MBP) -directed autoimmune neuroinflammation the first goal of this thesis was to characterize oxidative stress and protein carbonylation, including identification of the major oxidized protein species, in the Lewis rat model of EAE. I discovered that there is significant oxidative stress in the spinal cord of EAE rats characterized by reduced levels of glutathione, increased lipid peroxidation products, and accumulation of protein carbonyls during the inflammatory stages of the disease. Using two-dimensional oxyblot I was able to identify various CNS cytoskeletal proteins, including the neurofilaments (NFH, NFM, and NFL) and β-tubulin, as major targets of this oxidative damage. There are many possible fates for carbonylated proteins including accumulation, formation of high molecular weight aggregates and proteolysis. The specific fate likely depends not only on the particular species being oxidized but also on the level of damage it sustains. Western blotting for the neurofilaments and β-tubulin revealed that there is significant degradation of these cytoskeletal proteins during the disease and that the level of specific oxidative damage to NFL changes during the disease course. The second major objective of this thesis was to investigate the role of calpain and the proteasome, which have been proposed to selectively degrade carbonylated proteins, in the removal of these cytoskeletal proteins during neuroinflammation and to examine whether oxidative modification of the proteins made them more susceptible to degradation. This idea was tested by inhibiting calpain or the proteasome in EAE Lewis rats by intrathecal injection of calpeptin or epoxomicin during the peak of clinical disease. After inhibiting calpain, I found significant increases in total protein carbonylation and in the amount of neurofilament proteins and β-tubulin that are spared from degradation, but no changes are seen in the specific oxidation of any of these protein species. Inhibition of the proteasome did not affect total protein carbonylation or degradation, but did change the specific oxidation of NFM. These results suggest that (1) calpain is the <b>primary</b> <b>clearance</b> mechanism of neurofilament and β-tubulin in acute EAE, but that carbonylation of these proteins does not enhance their susceptibility to calpain-mediated proteolysis and (2) the proteasome may contribute to removal of carbonylated cytoskeleton, though it does not {{play a significant role in}} the axonal damage observed in acute EAE. This is the first study to investigate the relationship between protein carbonylation and targeted degradation in vivo, and provides insight into the relationship between oxidative stress and axonal damage during neuroinflammation.

A long-acting injectable (depot) antipsychotic {{is one of the}} most effective methods for improving treatment adherence and decreasing rehospitalization rates in patients with schizophrenia. Until recently, only three second-generation antipsychotics were available in a long-acting injectable formulation (risperidone, paliperidone, and olanzapine). In this respect, the emergence of long-acting aripiprazole injection (ALAI), approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of schizophrenia in 2013, is timely. ALAI is a lyophilized powder of aripiprazole, and the aripiprazole molecule is unmodified. The initial and target dosage of ALAI is 400  mg once monthly, but it could be reduced to 300  mg if adverse reactions occur with 400  mg. When first administering ALAI, it is recommended to continue treatment with oral aripiprazole (10 – 20  mg/day) or another oral antipsychotic for 2  weeks in order to maintain therapeutic antipsychotic concentrations. The <b>primary</b> <b>clearance</b> route for ALAI is hepatic, ie, cytochrome P 450  (CYP) 2 D 6  and CYP 3 A 4, so dose adjustment is required in poor CYP 2 D 6  metabolizers. The efficacy of ALAI was demonstrated in three studies. A randomized controlled trial that formed the basis for approval of ALAI in the treatment of schizophrenia showed that ALAI significantly delayed time to impending relapse when compared with placebo (P< 0. 0001, log-rank test). An open-label, mirror study demonstrated that total psychiatric hospitalization rates were significantly lower after switching from oral antipsychotics to ALAI. Another randomized controlled trial presented in poster form suggested that ALAI 400  mg was comparable with oral aripiprazole 10 – 30  mg in preventing relapse. ALAI was generally well tolerated during both short-term and long-term studies. Its tolerability profile, including extrapyramidal symptoms and clinically relevant metabolic parameters, was similar to placebo. However, insomnia, headache, anxiety, akathisia, weight gain, injection site pain, and tremor need clinical attention.

40|$|Since {{relatively}} few quantitative immunological studies had been conducted with invertebrates, {{this study was}} designed to learn more about the immune potential of the oyster, a molluscan representative. Experiments measured the <b>primary</b> and secondary <b>clearance</b> rates of T 2 coliphage in the oyster. The fate of phage injected intracardially or intramuscularly was traced by measuring serum and tissue fluid plaque-forming unit levels at various times postinjection. Phage-neutralizing activity was also measured.

50|$|The <b>primary</b> {{motivation}} for <b>clearance</b> was economic. Associated with {{this was the}} suggestion by some theorists that the Celtic population were less hardworking than those of Anglo-Saxon stock (i.e. Lowlanders and, in some instances, English), so giving an economic element to a racial theory. James Hunter quotes a contemporary Lowland newspaper: ‘Ethnologically the Celtic race is an inferior one and, attempt to disguise it as we may, there is . . . no {{getting rid of the}} great cosmical fact that it is destined to give way . . . before the higher capabilities of the Anglo-Saxon.’ It is not apparent to what extent this had any practical effect on the decision-making of landlords - though Patrick Sellar, the factor employed by the Countess of Sutherland to put her plans into effect, often wrote of his support for these opinions.|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} recently, based on pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modelling exercises, that twice daily dosing of artemisinins increases malaria parasite killing and so could "dramatically enhance and restore drug effectiveness" in artemisinin resistant P. falciparum malaria infections. It was recommended that split dosing should be incorporated into all artemisinin combination regimen designs. To explain why parasite clearance rates were not faster with split dose regimens {{it was concluded that}} splenic malaria parasite clearance capacity was readily exceeded, resulting in the accumulation of dead parasites in the circulation, that parasite clearance was therefore an unreliable measure of drug efficacy, and instead that human immunity is the <b>primary</b> determinant of <b>clearance</b> rates. To test these various hypotheses we performed a logistic meta-regression analysis of cure rates from all falciparum malaria treatment trials (n[*]=[*] 40) with monotherapy arms containing artemisinin or a derivative (76 arms).

40|$|Introduction: Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) is {{traditionally}} {{performed with the}} patient in the prone position for large renal calculi. However, anesthetic limitations exist with the prone position. Similarly, the supine position is associated with poorer ergonomics due to the awkward downward position of the renal tract, a smaller window for percutaneous puncture, and {{a higher risk of}} anterior calyx puncture. This study aimed to demonstrate the feasibility and safety of lateral-PCNL in managing large renal calculi without the disadvantages of prone and supine positions. Methods: Retrospectively, 347 lateral-PCNL cases performed from July 2001 to July 2015 were examined. the patient's thorax, abdomen, and pelvis were positioned over a bridge perpendicular to a “broken” table, creating an extended lumbodorsal space. The procedure was evaluated in terms of stone clearance at 3 months' postprocedure, operative time, and complications. Results: <b>Primary</b> stone <b>clearance</b> was achieved in 82. 7 % of patients. The mean operating time was 97 min. The average time taken to establish the tract and mean radiation time were 4. 5 min and 6. 93 min, respectively. In total, 2. 3 % of patients required postoperative transfusion, and 13. 5 % of patients had postoperative fever. There was one case of hydrothorax, but no bowel perforation. Conclusions: Our lateral-PCNL technique allows for effective stone clearance due to good stone ergonomics and it should be considered as a safe alternative even in the most routine procedures...|$|R
40|$|Background: While {{influenza}} vaccination results in protective antibodies against <b>primary</b> infections, <b>clearance</b> of infection is primarily mediated through CD 8 + T cells. Studying the CD 8 + T cell response to influenza epitopes {{is crucial in}} understanding the disease associated morbidity and mortality especially in at risk populations such as the elderly. We compared the CD 8 + T cell response to immunodominant and subdominant influenza epitopes in HLA-A 2 + control, adult donors, aged 21 - 42, and in geriatric donors, aged 65 and older. Results: We used a novel artificial Antigen Presenting Cell (aAPC) based stimulation assay to reveal responses {{that could not be}} detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISpot). 14 younger control donors and 12 geriatric donors were enrolled in this study. The mean number of influenza-specific subdominant epitopes per control donor detected by ELISpot was only 1. 4 while the mean detected by aAPC assay was 3. 3 (p = 0. 0096). Using the aAPC assay, 92 % of the control donors responded to at least one subdominant epitopes, while 71 % of control donors responded to more than one subdominant influenza-specific response. 66 % of geriatric donors lacked a subdominant influenza-specific response and 33 % of geriatric donors responded to only 1 subdominant epitope.

40|$|Reactive {{amyloidosis}} {{characterized by}} the tissue deposition of insoluble AA amyloid (AA), is a potentially serious complication of certain chronic infections and recurrent inflammatory diseases. AA {{is derived from the}} amyloidogenic serum amyloid A (SAA), an acute phase protein whose plasma concentration may increase up to 1000 -fold in response to tissue trauma. Chronic elevation of SAA in conjugation with inflammation-related host factors is believed to induce conversion of SAA to AA. One such host factor, called amyloid enhancing factor (AEF), has recently been identified as ubiquitin (UB). However, the molecular pathogenesis of AA amyloidosis in vivo is not well understood. Prior studies in our laboratory using alveolar hydatid cyst infected mouse model of AA amyloidosis (AHC-mouse) has demonstrated that (a) SAA and UB co-deposit in the splenic perifollicular areas prior to AA deposition, (b) both SAA and UB co-localize to endosomes-lysosomes (ELs) inflammatory macrophages (MA) and splenic reticuloendothelial (RE) cells, and (c) UB binds to the tissue AA deposits. My working hypothesis is that EL-mediated physiological degradation of SAA may serve as the <b>primary</b> <b>clearance</b> mechanism for exogenous SAA. As a secondary consequence, incessant overloading of ELs with ubiquitin-associated SAA during chronic inflammation may alter the rate or the extent of proteolysis leading to prolonged retention of SAA derivatives and the formation of "nascent" AA fibrils in ELs. The objectives of the present study are the following: (a) to establish intra-macrophage topographical relationship between murine SAA 3, which is synthesized by activated MA and RE cells, and two precursors of AA, SAM and SAA 2, that are endocytosed by MA and RE cells, (b) to immunochemically and chemically analyze the MA-derived degradation products of SAA in order to establish whether they could be potentially amyloidogenic and (c) to seek functional clues regarding the role of ubiquitin in SAA processing and in AA formation. Both the in vivo and in vitro experiments were carried out to pursue these objectives. I have shown that (a) murine SAA 1 /SAA 2 localize exclusively to ELs whereas SAM occupies the cytoplasmic compartment in MAs, (b) the lysates derived from MA contain at least four AA-sized potentially amyloidogenic N-terminally intact SAM and SAA 2 derivatives and (c) AA amyloid purified from AHC-mice is derived from both SAA 2 and SAA 1. As to the role of UB in SAA processing, I have shown that (a) UB binds avidly but non-covalently to both SAA 1 and SAA 2, (b) UB binds to ELs containing both immature and mature AA fibrils and (c) UB dissociated and purified from the tissue AA deposits retains its AEF activity in vivo. Collectively, these data show {{for the first time a}} direct relationship between the localization of SAA 1 and SAA 2 to ELs in MAs and the intracellular generation of potentially amyloidogenic N-terminally intact SAM and SAA 2 derivatives which may polymerize into "nascent" AA fibrils in ELs. We believe, as has also been proposed by others, that these "nascent" AA fibrils either after exocytosis or cell death may act as nucleation sites for extracellular AA deposition. As to the role of UB in SAA processing, we suggest that non-covalent binding of UB to SAA 1 and SAA 2 may (a) structurally alter theses substrates, thereby rendering them susceptible to phagocytosis by MA/RE-cells, and (b) interfere with their complete degradation culminating in the formation of UB-associated AA found in the EL. Non-covalent linkage of UB has been shown to induce structural alterations in other substrate proteins rendering them susceptible to phagocytosis...|$|R

40|$|Parasitic {{infections are}} a global health burden. The {{prevention}} of parasitic disease has {{relied heavily on}} mass drug administration campaigns, vector control, and sanitation rather than prevention through vaccination (Mutapi et al. 2013). Among parasites that evade effective vaccine induced immunity is Toxoplasma gondii, a ubiquitous intracellular protozoan that infects approximately {{one third of the}} human population and nearly all warm-blooded vertebrates. The adaptive immune response is fundamental to the clearance of T. gondii. Previous work by our lab and others’ with commonly studied T. gondii strains strongly implicates CD 8 T cell functions as the <b>primary</b> immune <b>clearance</b> mechanism (Suzuki and Remington, 1988); however, our data also suggests important roles for CD 4 T cells and B cells. Using a larger array of T. gondii strains sampled from around the world, we studied the immunological memory response generated in resistant and susceptible mouse genetic backgrounds to secondary infection. We found 1) three host genetic loci determine protective immunological memory responses to T. gondii, 2) dysfunctional marker profiles are highly expressed on both CD 8 and CD 4 T cells from the susceptible mouse strain, and 3) accumulation of B- 1 b cells in the resistant mouse strain. We present evidence that two of the genetic loci may determine the observed immune cell phenotypes. Importantly, as antibody producing cells, B cells may present an advantage in the development of effective parasite vaccines as current vaccines are conventionally used to induce antibody responses. Understanding the comprehensive immune response to T. gondii will provide us with both humoral and cell-mediated immune targets to prevent and treat parasitic disease...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: CF (cystic fibrosis) and PCD (primary ciliary dyskinesia) are obstructive airway {{diseases}} characterised by frequent {{infections and}} neutrophilic inflammation. However, PCD {{has a much}} milder course than CF. Pilot data showed that in PCD (n= 8) the relationship between LCI (lung clearance index) derived from multiple breath washout (MBW), and FEV 1 (forced expiratory volume in 1 second) differed from the established correlation in CF. This thesis sought to identify the reasons. Materials and Methods: Larger PCD (n= 38) and CF cohorts (n= 125), a non-CF bronchiectasis comparator group (n= 28), and healthy controls (n= 44) were recruited. All performed LCI and spirometry, and subgroups had more complex MBW parameters (conventional and modified phase III analysis and curvilinearity) calculated and HRCT scans scored. Results: As in the pilot data, there was no relationship between LCI and FEV 1 in PCD, unlike in CF. PCD patients had fewer structural abnormalities than CF despite similar or worse spirometry and LCI, {{and the relationship between}} HRCT and spirometry or LCI in PCD was again different from that seen in CF. MBW analyses showed that Scond* is near-normal in PCD, suggesting less flow asynchrony, compared with CF. Conclusions: There are differences in the nature of distal airway disease between PCD and CF. As the non-CF bronchiectasis patients were similar to CF (rather than PCD), this likely results from the <b>primary</b> mucociliary <b>clearance</b> defect in PCD compared with secondary impairment in the other two conditions. This may be important as care of PCD patients is extrapolated from that of CF patients, which may not be appropriate. It is important not to extrapolate outcome measures uncritically between different disease groups, both clinically and when planning randomised controlled trials. Finally, a better understanding of what causes the better prognosis in PCD may help identify future new treatment avenues in CF. Open Acces...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Fine needle {{aspiration}} cytology (FNAC) of radiologically abnormal axillary {{lymph nodes}} {{in patients with}} breast cancer can identify patients suitable for <b>primary</b> axillary <b>clearance</b> (AC) rather than sentinel node biopsy, enabling surgical axillary staging by a single operation. This study assessed the accuracy of FNAC in predicting positive axillary lymph nodes. METHODS: 161 patients with screen-detected invasive carcinoma and who had pre-operative FNAC of a radiologically abnormal axillary lymph node were identified from two screening units, The axillary FNAC reports were correlated with sentinel node biopsy and AC reports, and sensitivity, specificity, positive (PPV) and negative (NPV) predictive values were calculated. RESULTS: FNAC had a moderate sensitivity (66. 3 %) and NPV (71. 8 %), and a high specificity (98. 7 %) and PPV (98. 3 %). Most patients (86 %) had a single axillary operation. The sensitivity was highest in grade 3 (81. 8 %) and ductal type (77. 8 %) tumours. The sensitivity was lower in tumours of special type (34. 8 %), grade 1 tumours (50 %) and those without lymphovascular invasion (LVI) (55. 9 %). The NPV was highest in pT 1 (86. 7 %) and in grade 1 (84. 5 %) tumours, and lowest (44 %) in tumours with LVI. The PPV was 100 % in grade 1 and 3 tumours, stage pT 2 and pT 3 tumours and those without LVI, and was high (> 96 %) in all other groups. In lymph-node-positive patients, {{the mean number of}} lymph nodes involved was higher {{in the case of a}} positive (6. 4) than negative FNAC (4. 4). CONCLUSIONS: FNAC of ultrasonically abnormal axillary lymph nodes achieved surgical staging by a single operation in most patients with screen-detected invasive breast carcinoma, with moderate sensitivity and high specificity...|$|R
