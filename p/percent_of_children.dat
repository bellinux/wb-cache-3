5|$|Poliomyelitis, {{often called}} polio or {{infantile}} paralysis, is an infectious disease {{caused by the}} poliovirus. In about 0.5 percent of cases there is muscle weakness resulting in an inability to move. This can occur over {{a few hours to}} a few days. The weakness most often involves the legs but may less commonly involve the muscles of the head, neck and diaphragm. Many but not all people fully recover. In those with muscle weakness about 2 to 5 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> and 15 to 30 percent of adults die. Another 25 percent of people have minor symptoms such as fever and a sore throat and up to 5 percent have headache, neck stiffness and pains in the arms and legs. These people are usually back to normal within one or two weeks. In up to 70 percent of infections there are no symptoms. Years after recovery post-polio syndrome may occur, with a slow development of muscle weakness similar to that which the person had during the initial infection.|$|E

Twenty-six percent of the population (two-thirds of {{children under the age of}} five) are undernourished, and 46 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> are moderately or severely underweight. Forty-three to 60 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> under five are smaller than normal; one in five preschool children are vitamin-A deficient, and one in two are anemic.

40|$|California’s {{schools are}} {{becoming}} increasingly diverse in their student populations. Although all major racial/ethnic groups have �ummary experienced improvements in educational attainment {{over the past three}} decades, major gaps remain, especially for Hispanics, who represent the largest ethnic group in the state’s K– 12 public schools. This issue of California Counts looks at conditions from early childhood through high school that contribute to or indicate educational achievement, with a particular focus on differences across racial/ethnic groups. Two influential conditions affecting early childhood development are parental education and family income. Mothers with more education generally have greater access to information about ways to provide early learning experiences, and higher family income is a strong indicator of more resources available for a child’s education. It is commonly accepted that preschool also significantly helps children improve their readiness for school, yet over half <b>of</b> all <b>children</b> miss this experience, making it even more important for parents to undertake child development activities in the home, such as reading to their children. In this area, racial differences are pronounced. About 3 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> white <b>children</b> ages 3 – 5 have not had a family member read to them in the past week, whereas almost 30 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> Hispanic <b>children</b> have not been read to. English proficiency is another strong indicator <b>of</b> a <b>child’s</b> learning opportunities in school. A 1995 survey found that 75 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> Hispanic <b>children</b> and 67 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> Asian <b>children</b> ages 5 – 14 spoke a language other than English at home; <b>of</b> these <b>children,</b> 23 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> Hispanic <b>children</b> spoke English “not well ” or “not at all, ” and 14 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> Asian <b>children</b> did not speak English well. The availability of a home computer is another indicator of resources that provide educational opportunity. Although a majority of white and Asian children have a computer at home, 76 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> Hispanic <b>children</b> and 62 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> black childre...|$|R

40|$|The {{child support}} {{system has been}} {{increasing}} its efforts to make health insurance a part <b>of</b> <b>child</b> support awards. Data from the 1990 Current Population Survey Child Support Supplement show that 40 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>child</b> support awards require that the noncustodial parent provide health insurance to his children. However, in {{a third of the}} cases, the noncustodial parents are not providing coverage. This matters because 16 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> the <b>children</b> whose noncustodial fathers are not providing the coverage they were ordered to provide are not insured through other sources (e. g., Medicaid). But expecting noncustodial parents to be the sole providers of health insurance for their children may be unwise. Data from Wisconsin suggest that fewer than half (and probably less than 10 <b>percent)</b> <b>of</b> uninsured <b>children</b> in custodial- parent families have a noncustodial parent who can afford to provide health insurance for them. Health care reform is needed so that all children will have coverage, whether it is provided by their parents or the government. ...|$|R

40|$|Psychoanalysts {{have tended}} to view the {{diagnosis}} of AD/HD either with skepticism or as a contraindication to analytic treatment. The author reviews {{the history of this}} puzzling diagnostic entity, which is estimated to account for up to fifty <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>child</b> referrals, and suggests that a psychoanalytic perspective on the underlying disturbance in ego functioning helps to clarify the nature of the symptom picture. Whatever the etiology, which may be compound, she suggests that psychoanalytic treatment, most often in conjunction with psychopharmacological therapy, can address the core disturbance in ego integration that creates the familiar triad of inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity. T he diagnosis of Attention-Def icit/Hyperactivity Disorder is ap-plied to three to f ive <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> school-age <b>children</b> (Cantwell 1996) and three <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> adults in the United States (Feifel 1996). It is a highly prevalent disorder in clinical populations, and has been esti-mated to involve as many as f ifty <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>child</b> psychiatry patients. Despite the burgeoning interest in and research on this disorder, and the literature emanating from a range of child-related disciplines, there continues to be skepticism among psychoanalytic clinicians as to the validity of the syndrome as a meaningful discrete diagnostic entity.
