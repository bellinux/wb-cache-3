40|$|Background: Vascular endothelial {{growth factor}} (VEGF) {{expression}} {{has been extensively}} studied in astrocytoma, whereas relatively less literature exists on VEGF expression in meningioma. Materials and Methods: Patients operated for meningioma from 2006 to 2011 (n = 46) were included. Tumor was subtyped and graded as per WHO grading. Immunohistochemistry was performed for MIB labeling index, VEGF, and CD 34 staining. The patterns of VEGF expression in various histological subtypes and grades and its correlation with microvascular density were analyzed. Results: This series consisted of 40 Grade I meningioma, 4 Grade II tumors, and 2 Grade III tumors. While 14 (30. 4 %) tumors showed no staining with VEGF antibody, 32 (69. 6 %) were positive for VEGF. Sixty five <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>Grade</b> I tumors showed VEGF positivity, while 100 % of Grade II and Grade III tumors were VEGF positive (P = 0. 157). The mean microvascular density in VEGF-negative tumors was 9. 00, while that of VEGF-positive tumors was 17. 81 (P = 0. 013). There was a gradual increase in microvascular density from tumors which are negative for VEGF to tumors which expressed moderate to strong VEGF, the difference being statistically significant (P = 0. 009).

40|$|PURPOSE The genomic grade index (GGI) is a 97 -gene {{measure of}} {{histological}} tumor grade. High GGI {{is associated with}} decreased relapse-free survival in patients receiving either endocrine or no systemic adjuvant therapy. Herein we examined whether GGI predicts pathologic response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with HER- 2 -normal breast cancer. METHODS Gene expression data (gene chips) was generated from fine-needle aspiration biopsies (n = 229) prospectively collected before neoadjuvant paclitaxel, fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide chemotherapy. Pathologic response was quantified using the residual cancer burden (RCB) method. The association between the GGI and pathologic response was assessed in univariate and multivariate analyses. The performance of a response predictor combining clinical variables and GGI was evaluated under cross-validation. Results Eighty-five <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>grade</b> 1 tumors had low GGI, 89 % of grade 3 tumors had high GGI, and 63 % of grade 2 tumors had low GGI. Among both estrogen receptor (ER) -positive and -negative cancers, high GGI score was associated with pathologic complete response (RCB- 0) or minimal residual disease (RCB- 1). A multivariate model combining GGI and clinical parameters had an overall accuracy of 71 %, compared with 58 % for the GGI alone, for prediction of pathologic response. However, high GGI score was also associated with significantly worse distant relapse-free survival in patients with ER-positive cancer (P =. 005), and {{was not associated with}} survival in patients with ER-negative cancer. CONCLUSION High GGI is associated with increased sensitivity to neoadjuvant paclitaxel plus fluorouracil, adriamycin, and cyclophosphamide chemotherapy in both ER-negative and ER-positive patients, but it remains a predictor of worse survival in ER-positive patients.

40|$|The {{purpose in}} {{conducting}} {{this study was}} to investigate relationships between resources and student achievement in elementary schools on the Texas/Mexico border where disproportionate numbers of students are economically disadvantaged and are limited in their English proficiency. In this investigation the focus was on the extent to which schools provided equity of opportunity to learn and the extent to which schools were efficient in using resources to affect student achievement. ^ A causal-comparative analysis was conducted using a modified quadriform analytical technique to determine school efficiency and equity of opportunity to learn. Student achievement was assessed by the <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>Grade</b> 3 and 4 students passing either the English or Spanish versions of the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills exam administered in the spring of 1999. One hundred fifty-seven elementary schools in large and very large districts on the Texas/Mexico border were included in the study. ^ The investigation to determine equity of opportunity to learn for students in schools on the Texas/Mexico border yielded a negative correlation between total per pupil expenditures and students identified as economically disadvantaged (large effect size). A negative correlation was present between total per pupil expenditures and students characterized as limited in English proficiency (small effect size). In terms of efficiency, variables that differentiated efficient from inefficient schools included expenditures for teacher salaries, teacher experience, and bilingual instructional programs. All three variables had negative relationships with student achievement. ^ Prior to readers making inappropriate inferences and/or generalizations about these findings, it is important to state that certain limitations in the data set analyzed were discovered. Limitations included: (a) the veracity of the data set because of its self-reported nature; (b) the relatively small available sample size of schools; (c) the aggregate nature of the data which can obscure important evidence; and, (d) cause-effect relationships were not discernible given the statistical proceedings employed. ^ Two implications may be derived from the analysis: (1) The negative correlations between total per pupil expenditures and students identified as economically disadvantaged and/or limited in English proficiency may be interpreted as evidence of a lack of equity of opportunity to learn for students on the Texas/Mexico border. (2) In terms of efficiency, the negative relationships between certain resource expenditures (i. e. to compensate teachers and fund bilingual education programs) and student achievement may be interpreted as resources that may not be key in providing for student success. Given the results of the equity of opportunity findings, reason is present to interpret the efficiency results with extreme caution. (Abstract shortened by UMI.) ...|$|E
40|$|Whatever the reason, underachievement in {{mathematics}} in South Africa is endemic and {{tantamount to a}} national disaster. Despite the transformation of education in South Africa, failure rates {{in mathematics}} at school and university remain unacceptably high, {{and the number of}} learners who leave Grade 12 with a pass mark in both mathematics and physical science is unacceptably low. Relatively little has been written about inadequate performance of Grade 4 to 7 learners in mathematics in South Africa, and even less about possible solutions to the problem. South African primary school learners’ lack of basic mathematics and vocabulary skills in particular is a source of major concern. In the ﬁrst national systemic evaluation of learners’ skills in English, mathematics and science in 2001 Grade 3 learners achieved an average of 30 % in mathematics. In the follow-up studies, Grade 6 learners achieved a national average of 27 % in mathematices, in 2004, while nationally eighty <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>Grade</b> 3 and 6 learners achieved less than 50 percent for mathematics and Languages in 2008. The ﬁnding that so many primary school learners today are not numerate or literate has a direct inﬂuence both on the teaching and the learning of mathematics. Everything possible {{needs to be done to}} change this situation. During the past 15 years, the research focus in mathematics has shifted to an examination of the inﬂuence of social, cognitive and metacognitive, conative and affective factors on achievement in mathematics. In this regard, it is of particular importance that an ongoing investigation into “other” aspects that impact on achievement in mathematics is launched, rather than to restrict the investigation to mere assessment of objectives that are aimed at continually evaluating cognitive progress in mathematics. There is sufﬁcient empirical evidence that an adequate orientation to the study of mathematics correlates positively with high achievement in mathematics on secondary and tertiary levels. The aim of this research was to investigate the extent to which the performance in study orientation (Study Orientation questionnaire in Mathematics (Primary)) and knowledge of basic vocabulary/terminology in mathematics (Mathematics Vocabulary (Primary)) (vocabulary as one aspect of language in Mathematics) of Grade 4 to 7 learners predict performance in mathematics (Basic Mathematics (Primary)). Three standardised questionnaires were administered, namely the Study Orientation questionnaire in Mathematics (Primary), or SOM(P), Mathematics Vocabulary (Primary) or (MV(P), and Basic Mathematics (Primary) or BM(P). The participants consisted of learners in Grade 4 to 7 (n = 1 103) in North-West Province with respectively Afrikaans, English and Tswana as their home language. Results from the data, by calculating intercorrelations and stepwise regression, conﬁrmed that learners’ performance in mathematics (BM(P)) can be predicted through their performance in the knowledge of basic vocabulary in mathematics (MV(P)), their “maths” anxiety, study attitude towards and study habits in mathematics (SOM(P)). The results can be implemented to improve learners’ performance in mathematics when teachers identify inadequate knowledge of basic vocabulary in mathematics as well as study orientation (for example, “maths” anxiety, study attitude towards and study habits in mathematics) in the early years of schooling. Learners’ scores can be checked to identify those requiring aid, support, remediation and/or counselling. An analysis of individual answers (particularly those where learner’s replies differ signiﬁcantly in respect of the answers usually given by good achievers in mathematics) could be extremely useful. Enculturing learners to the vocabulary of mathematical language is an aspect of instruction that needs speciﬁc attention. The three questionnaires, which are administered in this research, provide mathematics teachers with standardised tools with which to make a simple systematic analysis of a number of important background particulars, feelings, attitudes, habits and customs with regard to the learner’s academic orientation in mathematics, as well as to their knowledge of basic vocabulary in mathematics that could be remedied when inadequate. </p...|$|E

This harvest criteria also produced the highest fresh weight, 49. 2 t/ha, the highest cut and graded weight respectively (37. 69 t/ha, 32. 32 t/ha). Population density affected the fresh and cut weight in the baby style carrots process with the highest weight at 321 plants/m. <b>Percent</b> <b>of</b> cut waste was the same at the three root size at harvest with 21. 65 % of crowns and tips cut. The <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>graded</b> waste was lowest when harvested at the biggest root size, 14. 23 % and 4 lines seed per bed produced the highest waste with 18. 14. Lines seed per bed affected the quality of the roots in the graded step. Projections for total waste and marketable yiel...|$|R
50|$|Girls {{have often}} {{received}} higher grades than boys. Thomas A. DiPrete and Claudia Bachmann {{say one of}} the three main reasons for this is because girls show higher levels of attachment to school leading to a deeper sense of gratification when receiving these good grades. Students encourage school involvement if it is paired with the suitable behaviors of being popular, athletic, or participating in extracurricular activities according to Thomas A. DiPrete and Claudia Buchmann. However, girls express stronger connections to their education than boys. 90 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> eighth <b>grade</b> males responded that good grades are important. 50 percent said that good grades are very important. Girls' value of their academic success was shown as closer to the perceived value of their parents than boys. 95 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> girls reported that good grades are important to them, and 62 percent declared that good grades are very important. This gender gap continues even when the sample is shortened to just the high achieving boys and girls. This is portrayed by the 2 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> girls that received A’s answering that grades are only somewhat important, contrasting the 6 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> exceeding boys who would agree.|$|R
40|$|When {{assessing}} latent fingermark development methods, forensic researchers commonly evaluate treated samples using a grading scale. However, {{the subjective}} {{nature of these}} evaluation methods leaves the results of such investigations open to criticism for potential grader bias. Assessment of fingermark development quality is ultimately dependent on an individual's background and experience. A pilot study was conducted as a preliminary stage of a large-scale international collaboration. A set of 80 fingermark samples was developed with 1, 2 -indanedione-zinc chloride. Grades for photographic images of the developed fingermarks were assigned independently by 11 fingermark researchers. Sixty-seven <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> the scores given to each individual sample {{were the same as}} the median grade, and 99 % of the scores were within 1 grade. The researchers were also assessed on their consistency by including 20 duplicate images to be <b>graded.</b> Seventy-eight <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> the <b>grades</b> given were identical to their original scores. These results indicate that a small group of independent fingermark graders is sufficient to produce reliable and consistent data in projects requiring the assessment of fingermark quality...|$|R
