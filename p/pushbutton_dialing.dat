5000|$|... system family 8811(1975-1979): It is a {{telephone}} with a <b>pushbutton</b> <b>dialing</b> and a LED-Screen. It allows {{a dialogue between}} the telephone and the computer, so information from the computer could directly be used over the system 8811. It had a printer. A keyboard with 50 numbers, not 20 was also possible. But the post office refused the permission so the system was not a success.|$|E
5000|$|The {{second floor}} hosts various early {{telephone}} instruments and related equipment. There are telephones with hand-cranked magneto generator or battery-powered, rotary <b>dial</b> and <b>pushbutton</b> <b>dial</b> telephones in both wall and desk versions, also produced in Turkish PTT factories, telephone switchboards, elektromechanical automatic telephone exchanges ...|$|R
50|$|Roaming was not encouraged, in part, {{because there}} was no {{centralized}} industry billing database for RCCs. Signaling formats were not standardized. For example, some systems used two-tone sequential paging to alert a mobile or hand-held that a wired phone was trying to call them. Other systems used DTMF. Some used a system called Secode 2805 which transmitted an interrupted 2805 Hz tone (in a manner similar to IMTS signaling) to alert mobiles of an offered call. Some radio equipment used with RCC systems was half-duplex, push-to-talk equipment such as Motorola hand-helds or RCA 700-series conventional two-way radios. Other vehicular equipment had telephone handsets, rotary or <b>pushbutton</b> <b>dials,</b> and operated full duplex like a conventional wired telephone. A few users had full-duplex briefcase telephones (radically advanced for their day).|$|R
50|$|One of {{the main}} {{features}} of PLCLogix {{is its ability to}} simulate real world manufacturing environments using interactive 3D animations. These interactive animations include bipeds and other avatars that operate in the various worlds. The integration of ladder programs with these 3D worlds provides a unique opportunity for programming in real-time and observing the operation of complex control devices and systems. Each of the 10 worlds in PLCLogix have interactive control panels which contain switches, <b>pushbuttons,</b> <b>dials,</b> levers, data input, thumbwheels, etc. The configuration of these control panels varies based on the operating requirements of the application. PLCLogix also includes a camera keypad with five camera views as well as a zoom function for all views. This allows the user to “move” around in the environment in order {{to gain a better understanding}} of the PLCs operation in its virtual 3D environment.|$|R
50|$|Teletype also {{introduced}} {{a more expensive}} ASCII Model 35 for heavy duty use, whose printer mechanism {{was based on the}} older, rugged Model 28. The basic Model 35 was mounted in a light gray console that matched the width of the Model 33, while the Model 35 ASR with eight-level mechanical tape punch and reader was installed in a console about twice as wide. The tape reader was mounted separately from the printer-punch mechanism {{on the left side of}} the console and behind it was a tray for storing a manual, sheets of paper, or other miscellanea. To the right of the keyboard was a panel that could optionally house a rotary <b>dial</b> or Touch-Tone <b>pushbuttons</b> for <b>dialing</b> a connection to a network via telephone lines. The printer cover in later units also featured sound deadening materials, making the Model 35 somewhat quieter than the Model 33 while printing and punching paper tapes. All versions of the Model 35 had a copy holder on the printer cover, making it more convenient for the operator when transcribing written material.|$|R
2500|$|For 1985, Grand Prix's now {{included}} a new checkerboard grille design, {{as well as}} an optional two tone paint scheme with a fading body stripe. The octagonal 'GP' logo also returned to the taillights. 1985 marked the last year for the flat rear deck panel in the interior, as by 1986 laws mandated cars to have a third brake light installed. New rectangular digital ETR stereo system options were introduced and replaced the <b>dial</b> <b>pushbutton</b> stereos. Some more rarer options specific for the 1985 Pontiac Grand Prix include a factory rear spoiler, rare aluminum turbo finned wheels, and a full size spare tire. The standard engine for 1985 was the [...] Buick built 3.8L V6 with a [...] Chevy 5.0L V8 optional. The 5.7L Olds Diesel V8 was dropped from the option list. Equipment levels were Standard, LE, and Brougham.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{details the}} project {{completed}} for a Masters of Research in Future Interaction Technologies. A user {{study was conducted}} to suggest guidelines about which input devices are the most appropriate for number entry. The study focused on a case we call ‘numbers as names’, meaning one incorrect digit makes the number completely wrong. Examples include phone numbers, PIN numbers, credit card numbers, and other integer numbers requiring absolute accuracy. The user study utilized the telephone as a platform for comparing three traditional input devices, the rotary <b>dial,</b> <b>pushbutton</b> and touchscreen, in the specific context of telephone number entry. The telephone provided a basis for comparison because of user’s familiarity with the interfaces and its clear evolution over time. A wealth of data, including performance, time and types of errors, was collected from thirty participants entering fifty eleven-digit numbers on the three interfaces. Contrary to our initial hypothesis, the touchscreen was four times more inaccurate than the other two interfaces. The rotary <b>dial</b> and <b>pushbutton</b> interfaces shared the same accuracy but differed in speed and recognized error rates. We move beyond simply describin...|$|R
