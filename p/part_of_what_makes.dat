Renowned studio percussionist Emil Richards bought his original flapamba from Professional Drum Shop in Hollywood in the late 1960s or early 1970s, and added it to his giant instrument collection, the Emil Richards Collection. The staff at the store convinced him to buy it, as they told him that they were {{getting out of the}} percussion rental business since Emil was dominating much of the work in town. Emil couldn't find any info on the history or maker of the flapamba when he purchased it, but nevertheless he started using it on recording sessions, as the chromatic layout of the instrument made it an easy transition from other keyboard mallet instruments. He used the softest mallets possible or the meat of the fingers to get a warm, resonant, wooden sound. This original flapamba had a range from middle C (C4), up two full octaves.|$|E

As {{defined by}} the {{textbook}} Anthropology: The Human Challenge, culture is, “a society’s shared and socially transmitted ideas, values, and perceptions, which are used {{to make sense of}} experience and generate behavior and are reflected in that behavior,” (Haviland 8). As applied to humans then, culture is expressed and measured in our abilities to learn, analyze, teach, individually evolve, and grow in intellect and preference. Human cultures, widely diverse and varying across the globe, are <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>make</b> us unique and define us as a species. Interestingly, however, it is suggested that Homo sapiens are not entirely alone in this regard: research from primatologists and anthropologists alike suggests that several nonhuman primate species, particularly the great ape group consisting of bonobos, orangutans, gorillas, and chimpanzees, possess and transmit culture as well. Accepting this theory poses both problems and benefits: if apes possess culture, how is our relationship with them to change? Do they deserve human rights? Should our conservation practices shift accordingly? In a more positive light, the cultured ape can extend knowledge about human evolution, and even about human culture itself. My goal is to analyze research from professors, primatologists, and anthropologists supporting and opposing these questions and to evaluate this research through an anthropological lens with the intent of bringing nonhuman primate culture to light...|$|R

In this paper, we propose a phishing detection approach based on checking the webpage source code, we extract some phishing characteristics out of the W 3 C standards to evaluate the security of the websites, and check each character in the webpage source code, if we find a phishing character, we will decrease from the initial secure weight. Finally we calculate the security percentage based on the final weight, the high percentage indicates secure website and others indicates the website is most likely to be a phishing website. We check two webpage source codes for legitimate and phishing websites and compare the security percentages between them, we find the phishing website is less security percentage than the legitimate website; our approach can detect the phishing website based on checking phishing characteristics in the webpage source code...|$|R

40|$|Function, flow, {{and space}} are the {{inspiration}} for this visual study of contemporary hotel architecture. I have been investigating how these hotels welcome their guests {{through the use of}} architecture and design. Styles such as Post-Modern and Neo-Futuristic designs are <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>make</b> these newer hotels so alluring. Using these forms of architecture, they delve into creative ways to make these buildings exciting spaces for interactions. These buildings possess a unique ability to flow between feelings of home, purpose, and escape, achieving business functionality while simultaneously upholding a vacation attitude. They tap into an ability to be more than just a temporary stay by providing an experience that encourages visitors to explore. These photographs look upon how guests of such luxury hotels are guided and comforted in each establishment. From the entrance to the bedroom, each hotel’s architecture persuades guests throughout the space. For example, some hotels will use a porch-like architecture incorporated into each floor of their atrium, allowing guests to feel at home, as well as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> a lively community that they can look at from above. The use of design is different in each location to encourage unique experiences, as well as artistically inform the guest about a specific aesthetic. Some hotels will implement local style to further connect their guests to the location. For instance, carrying in city influences that allow guests to soak in a metropolitan energy and importance. The images in this project look further into the presence of upscale contemporary hotels in order to provide a different view of their architecture and question how these spaces behave. Intricately designed with specific intentions, they are an oasis from the world around us, but also connections to places we travel to. I want to share with my viewers, my observation that these higher quality hotels are not just a status symbol for those who occupy the rooms, but that they are artistic works of interactivity. From the guidance of the architecture, to the provoking influence of the design, contemporary hotels offer something that is open, yet exclusive. B. F. A. (Bachelor of Fine Arts...|$|R

While many festive foods, such as roasted turkey or ham, are usually served on particular days or holidays, barbecue can be served on any day.

It brings people back to their roots, providing a cooking experience that is often an escape from civilization and closer to nature. Barbecues are traditionally held outside. They could be small informal gatherings with a few of people in a backyard or a formal event that could last all day, typically held for larger numbers of people.

40|$|This thesis investigates fiscal {{policies}} of subnational governments in Spain, {{a country whose}} regions are currently mired in a crisis of solvency. Many previous {{studies have suggested that}} political factors {{play an important role in}} determining deficits, spending, and debt. This paper examines the effect of such political factors as the party in power, the electoral cycle, the competitiveness of regional politics, and the degree of autonomy a region has, on fiscal outcomes, especially discretionary spending. The results show that much of the variation in fiscal outcomes can be explained by economic factors. However, some of the political factors are also relevant. The competitiveness of regional politics, especially whether the regional government is a coalition, or has just come to power, does affect fiscal outcomes, though not always as previous literature has found. Certain aspects of the Spanish system, like transfers from the federal government to regional governments, are also significant, in most cases in accordance with the literature. However, while this paper examines specifically what affects discretionary spending, here the results are less conclusive, and more work may be needed to determine not only <b>what</b> affects discretionary <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> spending, but <b>what</b> <b>makes</b> certain programs discretionary or non-discretionary...|$|R

Occasionally the images showed also reveal new voices and paths (Regret to Inform, In Country, Heaven and Earth).
