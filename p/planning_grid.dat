5000|$|The 1973 {{building}} was constructed using the CLASP Mk 4b system[...] CLASP was a building construction technique introduced post-war and {{popular in the}} 1960s for short-term, cheap and easily constructed buildings such as schools,fire stations, libraries etc. CLASP buildings of wood and concrete panel construction encompass {{a vast number of}} hidden voids for services. CLASP Mk 4b was the incarnation used between 1969 and 1972, measurements were imperial using 4" [...] as the basic unit. Panels were multiples of this - that is 12 inches or 1 foot, 3 foot, 6 foot and 9 foot. The <b>planning</b> <b>grid</b> was 12x12 inches, and a structural grid of 36x36 inches. The preferred floor to ceiling heights were 8 ft and 10 ft. The structure was steel frame with a 6 ft bay. It was hung with external 10 ft by 3 ft pre-fabricated concrete panels. The interior partitions were built using plastic-faced, plasterboard-backed steel Stelvelite panels. There was a hung exposed-T ceiling with 36x36 inch mineral tiles. The void above was used for service ducting, heating, electric power and lighting. The system was not heavy which was important due to the difficult sub-soil, and quick to erect which was important due to the tight time scale. It was designed to have a 60-year life. Hindsight shows that the extensive voids were a design fault, and many CLASP buildings have been destroyed by fire and have posed an asbestos risk.|$|E
30|$|In {{existing}} literature, while incorporating N- 1 constraints into transmission expansion {{models is}} common practice [18, 19, 20, 21, 22], embedding constraints of short circuit currents into transmission expansion planning models is not thoroughly discussed. Since short circuit currents have strong nonlinear relation with decision variables of candidate transmission lines, current power <b>grid</b> <b>planning</b> models have defects of heavy computational burden and low solution accuracy. In an actual power <b>grid</b> <b>planning</b> project, instead of embedding constraints in the <b>grid</b> <b>planning</b> model, short circuit currents are calculated after determining the power <b>grid</b> <b>planning</b> result. This is an open-loop approach in which short circuit currents are checked manually. Once the short circuit currents are excessive, the power <b>grid</b> <b>planning</b> result needs modifying according to artificial experience. The major drawback {{of this procedure}} is low efficiency and loss of optimality. Therefore, current power <b>grid</b> <b>planning</b> model can merely guarantee N- 1 security. A model that can ensure both short circuit currents constraints and N- 1 security needs investigating.|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} the congruency of planning between organizational structure and process, through an evaluation and planning model {{known as the}} Micro/Macro Dynamic <b>Planning</b> <b>Grid.</b> The model compares day-to-day planning within an organization to planning imposed by organizational administration and accrediting agencies. A survey instrument was developed to assess the micro and macro sociological analysis elements utilized by an organization. ^ The Micro/Macro Dynamic <b>Planning</b> <b>Grid</b> consists of four quadrants. Each quadrant contains characteristics that reflect {{the interaction between the}} micro and macro elements of planning, objectives and goals within an organization. The Over Macro/Over Micro, Quadrant 1, contains attributes that reflect a tremendous amount of action and ongoing adjustments, typical of an organization undergoing significant changes in either leadership, program and/or structure. Over Macro/Under Micro, Quadrant 2, reflects planning characteristics found in large, bureaucratic systems with little regard given to the workings of their component parts. Under Macro/Under Micro, Quadrant 3, reflects the uncooperative, uncoordinated organization, one that contains a multiplicity of viewpoints, language, objectives and goals. Under Macro/Under Micro, Quadrant 4 represents the worst case scenario for any organization. The attributes of this quadrant are very reactive, chaotic, non-productive and redundant. ^ There were three phases to the study: development of the initial instrument, pilot testing the initial instrument and item revision, and administration and assessment of the refined instrument. The survey instrument was found to be valid and reliable for the purposes and audiences herein described. ^ In order to expand the applicability of the instrument to other organizational settings, the survey was administered to three professional colleges within a university. ^ The first three specific research questions collectively answered, in the affirmative, the basic research question: Can the Micro/Macro Dynamic <b>Planning</b> <b>Grid</b> be applied to an organization through an organizational development tool? The first specific question: Can an instrument be constructed that applies the Micro/Macro Dynamic <b>Planning</b> <b>Grid?</b> The second specific research question: Is the constructed instrument valid and reliable? The third specific research question: Does an instrument that applies the Micro/Macro Dynamic <b>Planning</b> <b>Grid</b> assess congruency of micro and macro planning, goals and objectives within an organization? The fourth specific research question: What are the differences in the responses based on roles and responsibilities within an organization? involved statistical analysis of the response data and comparisons obtained with the demographic data.

30|$|The Indian {{power system}} {{underwent}} two separate massive blackouts on 30 th and 31 st of July 2012. These blackouts exposed {{a series of}} inherent problems underlying the power system of India, such as its generation planning, transmission <b>planning,</b> <b>grid</b> infrastructure, management systems, primary energy resources, environmental constraints, electricity market, and information technology, which together aggravate the massive blackouts. These factors which affect the adequacy and security of the power supply {{in a similar manner}} as the transmission congestion of physical grids does, can be called by a generic term as generalized congestion. Competitive manipulations and “game-playing” between various interested parties further intensifies these congestions. Here, from the perspective of generalized congestions, the paper reflects the inevitability of India’s massive blackouts, discusses occasional effects of trigger events, inherent evolution law of blackouts and the enlightenment on power industry in China, and explores risk control measures to defend blackouts in China. The positive role of strong smart grid in insuring energy and environment security is highlighted.|$|E
