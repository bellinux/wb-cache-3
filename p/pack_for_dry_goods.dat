50|$|This crumbly form of proto-pottery was {{manufactured}} by pulverizing limestone, then heating it to a temperature {{in excess of}} 1000 °C. This reduced it to lime from which could be mixed with ashes, straw or gravel and made into a white or grey lime plaster. The plaster was initially so soft {{that it could be}} moulded, before hardening through air drying into a rigid cement. The plaster was formed into vessels by coiling to serve some of the functions of later clay pottery. White Ware vessels tended to be rather large and coarse, often found in the dwelling rooms where they were made indicating their use for stationary storage of <b>dry</b> <b>goods.</b> Designs included a range of large and heavy rectangular tubs, circular vessels and smaller bowls, cups and jars. Imprints of basketry on the exterior of some vessels suggest that some were shaped into large basket shapes. It is likely these larger vessels were mainly used <b>for</b> <b>dry</b> <b>goods</b> storage. Some of the White Ware vessels found were decorated with incisions and thick stripes of red ochre. Other uses of this material included plastering of skulls and as a floor or wall covering. Some lime plaster floors were also painted red, and a few were found with designs imprinted on them.|$|R
