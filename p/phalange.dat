5|$|Pipistrellus raceyi is a {{small to}} {{medium-sized}} pipistrelle. It is long-furred and the body is reddish above, with the head a trifle darker, and yellowish-brown below. The glandular swellings on the muzzle, next to the nose, are hairless. The dark, short, round ears bear three to five ridges. The crescent-shaped tragus (a projection {{on the inner side}} of the outer ear) is about half as long as the ear and contains a slight constriction on the back side of its base. The wings are dark. The third through fifth metacarpals (hand bones) are about equally long, but the first <b>phalange</b> (finger bone) on the third finger is short. P.endoi has a longer first <b>phalange</b> on the third metacarpal. P.raceyi has short tibiae (lower leg bones) and small feet and the tail is shorter than the head and body. Forearm length is 28.0 to 31.2mm (1.10 to 1.23in), tail length is 22.9 to 30.3mm (0.90 to 1.19in), hindfoot length is 5.3 to 7.5mm (0.21 to 0.30in), and ear length is 7.5 to 10.6mm (0.30 to 0.42in) in 13 measured specimens. Females average slightly larger than males.|$|E
5|$|The fur is {{brownish}} (T.bolivaris) or reddish (T.talamancae) {{above and}} lighter below, appearing whitish, but {{the hairs on}} the underparts have gray bases. The snout is large. The mystacial (above the mouth) and superciliary vibrissae both extend to at least the back margin of the ears when laid back against the head, but are much longer in T.bolivaris. The pinna (external ear) is large. On the hindfeet, which are long and narrow, ungual tufts of hairs surround the bases of the toes. In T.bolivaris, the sole usually entirely lacks squamae (small, scale-like structures), but T.talamancae does have squamae on part of its sole. The claw of the first toe extends about {{to the middle of}} the first <b>phalange</b> of the second and that of the fifth toe extends nearly to the base of the second <b>phalange</b> of the fourth. The tail is at least about as long as the head and body, sometimes slightly longer. The tail is darker above than below in T.talamancae, but there may not be a difference in color in T.bolivaris. The tail appears naked, but is covered with fine hairs.|$|E
5|$|The arms of I. bernissartensis {{were long}} (up to 75% {{the length of}} the legs) and robust, with rather {{inflexible}} hands built so that the three central fingers could bear weight. The thumbs were conical spikes that stuck out away from the three main digits. In early restorations, the spike was placed on the animal's nose. Later fossils revealed {{the true nature of the}} thumb spikes, although their exact function is still debated. They could have been used for defense, or for foraging for food. The little finger was elongated and dextrous, and could have been used to manipulate objects. The phalangeal formula is 2-3-3-2-4, meaning that the innermost finger (<b>phalange)</b> has two bones, the next has three, etc. The legs were powerful, but not built for running, and each foot had three toes. The backbone and tail were supported and stiffened by ossified tendons, which were tendons that turned to bone during life (these rod-like bones are usually omitted from skeletal mounts and drawings).|$|E
5000|$|Hands (54 bones) - Left {{and right}} carpals (16) (wrist), metacarpals (10), {{proximal}} <b>phalanges</b> (10), intermediate <b>phalanges</b> (8) and distal <b>phalanges</b> (10).|$|R
5000|$|The <b>phalanges</b> [...] (singular: phalanx [...] ) are digital {{bones in}} the hands and feet of most vertebrates. In primates, the thumbs and big toes have two <b>phalanges</b> while the other digits have three <b>phalanges.</b> The <b>phalanges</b> are classed as long bones.|$|R
5000|$|Feet {{and ankles}} (52 bones) - Left and right tarsals (14) (ankle), metatarsals (10), {{proximal}} <b>phalanges</b> (10), intermediate <b>phalanges</b> (8) and distal <b>phalanges</b> (10).|$|R
5|$|The forelimbs of Allosaurus {{were short}} in {{comparison}} to the hindlimbs (only about 35% the length of the hindlimbs in adults) and had three fingers per hand, tipped with large, strongly curved and pointed claws. The arms were powerful, and the forearm was somewhat shorter than the upper arm (1:1.2ulna/humerus ratio). The wrist had a version of the semilunate carpal also found in more derived theropods like maniraptorans. Of the three fingers, the innermost (or thumb) was the largest, and diverged from the others. The phalangeal formula is 2-3-4-0-0, meaning that the innermost finger (<b>phalange)</b> has two bones, the next has three, and the third finger has four. The legs were not as long or suited for speed as those of tyrannosaurids, and the claws of the toes were less developed and more hoof-like than those of earlier theropods. Each foot had three weight-bearing toes and an inner dewclaw, which Madsen suggested could have been used for grasping in juveniles. There was also what is interpreted as the splint-like remnant of a fifth (outermost) metatarsal, perhaps used as a lever between the Achilles tendon and foot.|$|E
5|$|The innominate {{is known}} from seven examples, {{but most are}} quite incomplete. It {{includes}} a narrow ilium and long ischium. The ischial tuberosity, a narrow rough piece of bone in most placentals, is broad and smooth in Plesiorycteropus. With 17 specimens, the femur is the best represented long bone. It is distinctive in its long neck, similar only to the gymnure Echinosorex according to MacPhee. A projection known as the third trochanter is larger in P.madagascariensis. The tibia and fibula are extensively fused into a tibiofibula, of which eight examples are known. This bone resembles that of armadillos in the extensive fusion, the compression of the shaft of the tibia, the narrowness of the articulation surface at the distal end, and the broad space between the bones. Unlike in armadillos, the tibia and fibula are not inclined relative to each other, but about parallel. The astragalus, which is known from four examples, is wide and short and contains a uniquely large posteromedial process. Seven metapodials (middle hand or foot bones) are known, rather variable in size, but MacPhee was unable to separate metacarpals (from the hand) and metatarsals (from the foot). All are rather short and are broad proximally and narrow distally. Among the few known phalanges, the proximal <b>phalange</b> is shorter than the middle one and the distal phalanges are narrow and clawlike.|$|E
25|$|On 6 December 1975, a {{day later}} known as Black Saturday, the killings of four <b>Phalange</b> members led <b>Phalange</b> to quickly and {{temporarily}} set up roadblocks throughout Beirut at which identification cards were inspected for religious affiliation. Many Palestinians or Lebanese Muslims passing through the roadblocks were killed immediately. Additionally, <b>Phalange</b> members took hostages and attacked Muslims in East Beirut. Muslim and Palestinian militias retaliated with force, increasing the total death count to between 200 and 600 civilians and militiamen. After this point, all-out fighting began between the militias.|$|E
50|$|The {{forefoot}} {{is composed}} of five toes and the corresponding five proximal long bones forming the metatarsus. Similar to the fingers of the hand, {{the bones of the}} toes are called <b>phalanges</b> and the big toe has two <b>phalanges</b> while the other four toes have three <b>phalanges</b> each. The joints between the <b>phalanges</b> are called interphalangeal and those between the metatarsus and <b>phalanges</b> are called metatarsophalangeal (MTP).|$|R
50|$|In {{the distal}} <b>phalanges</b> {{of the hand}} the centres for the bodies appear at the distal {{extremities}} of the <b>phalanges,</b> instead of at {{the middle of the}} bodies, as in the other <b>phalanges.</b> Moreover, of all the bones of the hand, the distal <b>phalanges</b> are the first to ossify.|$|R
50|$|The <b>phalanges</b> are {{the bones}} {{that make up}} the fingers of the hand and the toes of the foot. There are 56 <b>phalanges</b> in the human body, with {{fourteen}} on each hand and foot. Three <b>phalanges</b> are present on each finger and toe, {{with the exception of the}} thumb and large toe, which possess only two. The middle and far <b>phalanges</b> of the fourth and fifth toes are often fused together (symphalangism). The <b>phalanges</b> of the hand are commonly known as the finger bones. The <b>phalanges</b> of the foot differ from the hand in that they are often shorter and more compressed, especially in the proximal <b>phalanges,</b> those closest to the body.|$|R
25|$|In 1936, the Maronite <b>Phalange</b> {{party was}} founded by Pierre Gemayel.|$|E
25|$|In 1952, the Lebanese <b>Phalange</b> put William Hawi {{up for the}} Beirut Municipal Council in the Achrafieh-Rmeil {{region for}} the Orthodox Christian seat, where he {{obtained}} {{the largest number of}} votes. In 1957, he individually ran for the Parliamentary elections opposite Ghassan Tueini and Nassim Majdalani but did not win. Despite its loss, the <b>Phalange</b> Party considered these elections to be a confirmation of its strength on the streets.|$|E

50|$|The <b>phalanges</b> {{are named}} {{according}} to whether they are proximal, intermediate or distal, {{and according to the}} finger or toe they are in. The proximal <b>phalanges</b> are those that are closest to the hand or foot. In the hand, the prominent, knobby ends of the <b>phalanges</b> are known as knuckles. The proximal <b>phalanges</b> join with the metacarpals of the hand or metatarsals of the foot at the metacarpophalangeal joint or metatarsophalangeal joint. The intermediate phalanx is not only intermediate in location, but usually also in size. The thumb and large toe do not possess a middle phalanx. The distal <b>phalanges</b> are the bones at the tips of the fingers or toes. The proximal, intermediate, and distal <b>phalanges</b> articulate with one another through interphalangeal articulations.|$|R
50|$|The distal <b>phalanges</b> of {{ungulates}} {{carry and}} shape nails and claws and these in primates {{are referred to}} as the ungual <b>phalanges.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{number of}} <b>phalanges</b> in animals is often {{expressed}} as a [...] "phalangeal formula" [...] that indicates the numbers of <b>phalanges</b> in digits, beginning from the innermost medial or proximal. For example, humans have a 2-3-3-3-3 formula for the hand, meaning that the thumb has two <b>phalanges,</b> whilst the other fingers each have three.|$|R
25|$|On July 1, 1976, {{sources of}} the Lebanese Christian militias {{announced}} {{the fall of the}} last bastion in Tel el-Zaatar and declared that the Head of the <b>Phalange</b> War Council supervised this operation.|$|E
25|$|In 1952, the Lebanese <b>Phalange</b> put William Hawi {{up for the}} Beirut Municipal Council in the Achrafieh-Rmeil region, {{where he}} {{obtained}} {{the largest number of}} votes. In 1957, Hawi presented himself to the legislative elections but failed.|$|E
25|$|Another {{example of}} reparative {{regeneration}} in humans is fingertip regeneration, which occurs after <b>phalange</b> amputation distal to the nail bed (especially in children) and rib regeneration, which occurs following osteotomy for scoliosis treatment (though usually regeneration is only partial and may {{take up to}} 1 year).|$|E
50|$|The last form {{of ritual}} burials had amputated fingers. In some cases, the <b>phalanges</b> were either placed in seashells near the body or {{scattered}} around the head. In three cases, the <b>phalanges</b> were found inside of the cranium.|$|R
40|$|Sex {{determination}} {{is among}} the most important biological data to be obtained from human skeletal remains. In anthropological sciences, the applied methodology involves the analysis of the quantitative and qualitative characteristics of skeletal parts. Measurements of proximal hand <b>phalanges</b> have been shown to exhibit prominent sexual dimorphism, in different populations examined. The aim {{of this study is to}} assess the utility of proximal hand <b>phalanges</b> for the sex diagnosis and develop a discriminant formula to be applied to Modern Greek populations. The material utilized consists of 661 proximal hand <b>phalanges</b> (left and right) from the Athens Collection, corresponding to 160 adult individuals (86 males and 74 females). Classification accuracies ranged between 94. 6 % and 100 % for left and between 87. 7 % and 100 % for right proximal <b>phalanges.</b> The results of this study indicate that proximal hand <b>phalanges</b> can be used for accurate sex diagnosis...|$|R
5000|$|The Florida bog frog {{differs from}} other American frogs by reduced webbing of their feet - [...] "at least three <b>phalanges</b> of the 4th toe {{are free of}} webbing {{and at least two}} <b>phalanges</b> of all other toes are free".|$|R
25|$|Concurrently, {{tension between}} Syria and <b>Phalange</b> {{increased}} Israeli {{support for the}} Maronite group and led to direct Israeli-Syrian exchanges in April 1981, leading to American diplomatic intervention. Philip Habib was dispatched to the region to head off further escalation, which he successfully did via an agreement concluded in May.|$|E
25|$|No {{forensic}} evidence linked Fred {{to the murder}} of Anne McFall, and he always denied killing her. However, the fact her body had been extensively dismembered, and was missing several <b>phalange</b> bones, plus the fact the cubicle dimensions of the grave in which her body was buried match the modus operandi of Fred's later murders.|$|E
25|$|During this period, the Lebanese and Arab {{scenes were}} marked by the halo of the Egyptian President, Gamal Abdel Nasser. The <b>Phalange</b> Party was {{fiercely}} opposed to the pro-Nasser movement that called for strikes and organized riots. It thus entrusted William Hawi with organizing and leading the activists to control the situation and protect its regions.|$|E
50|$|The sloth spends {{its life}} hanging {{upside-down}} from branches, and has highly specialized {{third and fourth}} digits for the purpose. They have short and squat proximal <b>phalanges</b> with much longer terminal <b>phalanges.</b> They have vestigial second and fifth metacarpals, and their palm extends to the distal interphalangeal joints. The arboreal specialization of these terminal <b>phalanges</b> {{makes it impossible for}} the sloth to walk on the ground where the animal has to drag its body with its claws.|$|R
40|$|Abstract- The aim of {{this paper}} was to explore {{hairiness}} of the middle <b>phalanges</b> on both hands of Serbian high school students. The total sample comprised 425 pupils in the town of Niš of Serbian nationality, aged 15 − 19 years. Hairiness on the middle <b>phalanges</b> of second, third, fourth and fifth fingers was detected by inspection with a magnifying glass. The results showed that hairiness was more frequent on the fifth finger of boys. The investigation of the hairiness on the middle <b>phalanges</b> of both hands in the region of Niš may be, in comparison with anthropological investigations of other regions, important in the investigation of the genetic cause of the hairiness on the middle <b>phalanges...</b>|$|R
5000|$|Cooks {{syndrome}} is a hereditary disorder which is characterized {{in the hands}} by bilateral nail hypoplasia on the thumb, index finger, and middle finger, absence of fingernails (anonychia) on the ring finger and little finger, lengthening of the thumbs, and bulbousness of the fingers. In the feet, it is characterized by absence of toenails and absence/hypoplasia of the distal <b>phalanges.</b> In the second study of this disorder, {{it was found that}} the intermediate <b>phalanges,</b> proximal <b>phalanges,</b> and metacarpals were unaffected.|$|R
25|$|The {{situation}} deteriorated {{further on}} October 28, when a shooting incident {{occurred on the}} steps of the Parliament House at Nejmeh Square in Christian-controlled territory. One car filled with Muslim militiamen from West Beirut managed to reach the Parliament building and after shouting slogans over a loudspeaker against the members of the Assembly, they opened fire on the deputies leaving the building after attending a parliamentary session. Two men were killed, one being a bodyguard of <b>Phalange</b> Leader Pierre Gemayel. He had been standing nearby at that moment, but was not harmed.|$|E
25|$|However, {{estimates}} of the Phalange's membership by Yezid Sayigh and other academic sources put them at a few thousand. Non-academic sources tend to inflate the Phalanges membership. What {{should be kept in}} mind was that this insurrection was met with widespread disapproval by many Lebanese who wanted no part in the regional politics and many young men aided the <b>Phalange</b> in their suppression of the insurrection, especially as many of the demonstrators were little more than proxy forces hired by groups such as the ANM and Fatah founders as well as being hired by the defeated parliamentary bosses.|$|E
25|$|William Hawi’s family {{comes from}} the village of Choueir in North Metn, Lebanon. William’s father, Amine Hawi, emigrated when he was twenty years old. His second son, William, was born in New York, U.S. in 1908. Before the family grew and spread its roots in the foreign land, Amine Hawi went back to his {{homeland}} in the beginning of 1910, along with his wife and three children. William Hawi had a passion for sports. He played football, tennis and loved swimming and skiing. His sports activities were topped by his participation in the creation of Al Salam Club in Achrafieh. William Hawi met Pierre Gemayel in sports meetings and the latter invited him in 1937 to join the Lebanese <b>Phalange</b> Organization.|$|E
50|$|Triphalangeal thumb (TPT) is a {{congenital}} malformation where the thumb has three <b>phalanges</b> instead of two. The extra phalangeal bone can vary {{in size from}} that of a small pebble to a size comparable to the <b>phalanges</b> in non-thumb digits. The true incidence of the condition is unknown, but is estimated at 1:25,000 live births. In about two-thirds of the patients with triphalangeal thumbs, there is a hereditary component. Besides the three <b>phalanges,</b> there can also be other malformations. It was first described by Columbi in 1559.|$|R
