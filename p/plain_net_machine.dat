40|$|Abstract—The {{researches}} {{have shown}} that not all the Petri <b>Net</b> <b>machines</b> {{can be used to}} describe attack behavior. When Petri <b>Net</b> <b>machines</b> adapted for attack behavior modeling are detecting the network, for some event of current status, if there is matching event in the model, it has only one corresponding transition; otherwise that may cause errors. Since sharing synthesis and synchronization synthesis of traditional machines cannot ensure synthetic model reserves original detection capability, we propose the novel concept for synthesis operation and colored synthetic operation. By the analysis on the relation among these operations, the ability to reserve original detection is verified. Then an improved colored judgement Petri <b>Net</b> <b>machine</b> is adopted for modeling and renewing the knowledge repository. The inductive learning method is used to extend the attack modes. It creates a four-layered concept space, which actually provides a depth-first search path for matching. To solve the problems in multi-pattern matching and incremental learning, various modes are generalized by colored operation. We also adopt the decomposition and synthesis operation to handle the pattern matching of distributed attack behavior and attack information fusion. Finally the actual cases verify that our algorithm is feasible...|$|R

40|$|We {{introduce}} ω-Petri nets (ωPN), {{an extension}} of <b>plain</b> Petri <b>nets</b> with ω-labeled input and output arcs, that is well-suited to analyse parametric concurrent systems with dynamic thread creation. Most techniques (such as the Karp and Miller tree or the Rackoff technique) that have been proposed {{in the setting of}} <b>plain</b> Petri <b>nets</b> do not apply directly to ωPN because ωPN define transition systems that have infinite branching. This motivates a thorough analysis of the computational aspects of ωPN. We show that an ωPN can be turned into a <b>plain</b> Petri <b>net</b> that allows us to recover the reachability set of the ωPN, but that does not preserve termination (an ωPN terminates iff it admits no infinitely long execution). This yields complexity bounds for the reachability, boundedness, place boundedness and coverability problems on ωPN. We provide a practical algorithm to compute a coverability set of the ωPN and to decide termination by adapting the classical Karp and Miller tree construction. We also adapt the Rackoff technique to ωPN, to obtain the exact complexity of the termination problem. Finally, we consider the extension of ωPN with reset and transfer arcs, and show how this extension impacts the decidability and complexity of the aforementioned problems. IOS Press.

50|$|In 1764, a {{profound}} change {{was made to}} the stocking frame that enabled it to produce weft-knitted nets. Hammond, the attributed inventor, used ticklers to stitch-transfer from one needle to the third one along crossing over two intermediate needles creating a cross stitch. He also used a tickler to move two stitches two to the right, and then two to the left in a double cross stitch, Valenciennes lace. To do this the tickler bar was detached from the frame and attached to 'dogs', that is, jointed arms. This allowed forward motion to scoop, and sideways motion to shog. New inventions were patented: Frost's tickler net of 1769, the two <b>plain</b> <b>net</b> of 1777 and the square net of 1781, and their patents were fiercely defended.

50|$|The {{trade of}} making lace by hand was a {{well-established}} cottage {{industry in the}} East Midlands by the late 16th century, and the earliest record of it in Helmdon dates from 1718.

Helmdon had lace-making schools that taught girls the trade from an early age.
