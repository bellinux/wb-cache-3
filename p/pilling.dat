25|$|Three {{types of}} {{emergency}} contraceptive <b>pills</b> are available: combined estrogen and progestin <b>pills,</b> progestin-only (levonorgestrel, LNG) <b>pills,</b> and antiprogestin (ulipristal acetate or mifepristone) <b>pills.</b> Progestin-only and antiprogestin <b>pills</b> are available as dedicated (specifically packaged for use as) emergency contraceptive <b>pills.</b> Combined estrogen and progestin <b>pills</b> {{are no longer}} available as dedicated emergency contraceptive <b>pills,</b> but certain regular combined oral contraceptive <b>pills</b> {{may be used as}} emergency contraceptive <b>pills.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The <b>pill</b> jar puzzle is a {{probability}} puzzle, which asks the expected {{value of the}} number of half-pills remaining when the last whole <b>pill</b> is popped from a jar initially containing [...] whole <b>pills</b> and the way to proceed is by removing a <b>pill</b> from the bottle at random. If the <b>pill</b> removed is a whole <b>pill,</b> it is broken into two half <b>pills.</b> One half <b>pill</b> is consumed and the other one is returned to the jar. If the <b>pill</b> removed is a half <b>pill,</b> then it is simply consumed and nothing is returned to the jar.|$|R
5000|$|Honey <b>pills</b> {{and water}} <b>pills</b> {{have been made}} since ancient times by {{combining}} several dried herbs and other ingredients, which are grounded into powder, mixed with a binder and traditionally formed into <b>pills</b> by hand. Modern honey or water <b>pills</b> are formed into <b>pills</b> by machine. The binder is traditionally honey for honey <b>pills.</b> For water <b>pills</b> the binder may simply be water, or may include another binder, such as molasses. Modern manufacturers still produce many patent formulas as honey or water <b>pills,</b> such as Wuji Baifeng Wan, a popular honey <b>pill</b> formula to [...] "nourish qi and blood", to strengthen the body.|$|R

50|$|Progestogen-only <b>pills</b> or progestin-only <b>pills</b> (POP) are {{contraceptive}} <b>pills</b> {{that contain}} only synthetic progestogens (progestins) {{and do not}} contain estrogen. They are colloquially known as mini <b>pills.</b>|$|R
25|$|Research {{suggests}} that for psychological reasons, some placebos {{are more effective}} than others.

25|$|On May 13, 1890, the Ottoman {{authorities}} gave {{a permit}} to build a railway line from Haifa to Damascus to the public servant Shukri Bey and a Christian Lebanese engineer and effendi named Yusuf Elias, both of whom worked for the Ottoman government. The line was meant to go from Acre to Damascus with spurs to Haifa and Bosra. Elias {{did not have the}} ability to gather the funds necessary for such a project, and it was agreed that he would buy out Shukri's share and sell the rights to John Robert <b>Pilling,</b> a British entrepreneur. <b>Pilling</b> quickly founded an investment company, which was listed in the London Stock Exchange as the S.O.R.

5000|$|The problem {{becomes very}} easy to solve once a binary {{variable}} Xk defined [...] as Xk = 1, if the kth half <b>pill</b> remains inside the jar after the all the whole <b>pills</b> are removed. The kth half <b>pill</b> {{is defined as the}} result of the breaking of the kth whole <b>pill</b> being removed from the jar. Xk = 1 if out of the n − k + 1 <b>pills</b> (n − k whole <b>pills</b> + kth half <b>pill),</b> the one half <b>pill</b> is removed at the very end. This occurs with probability 1/(n − k + 1).|$|R
5000|$|When a woman takes COCP, {{the hormones}} in the <b>pills</b> prevent both {{ovulation}} and shedding of the endometrium (menstruation). Traditionally, COCPs are packaged with 21 active (hormone-containing) <b>pills</b> and 7 placebo <b>pills.</b> During {{the week of}} placebo <b>pills,</b> withdrawal bleeding occurs and simulates an average 28-day menstrual cycle. The placebo <b>pills</b> are not required for pregnancy protection, and with any monophasic COCP the placebo <b>pills</b> may be discarded, and the next pack of active <b>pills</b> may be started to prevent the withdrawal bleeding. [...] With bi- and tri-phasic <b>pills,</b> skipping the placebo week results in a sudden change in hormone levels, which may cause irregular spotting or flow.(Monophasic <b>pills</b> offer the same dose of estrogen and progestogen whereas multiphasic <b>pills</b> have varying doses from day to day; see formulations for details.) ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Pill</b> prices {{ranged from}} {{as low as}} $0.38 per <b>pill</b> (Malaysia) to $3.83 per <b>pill</b> (Thailand). and in the U.S., {{approximately}} $1 per <b>pill,</b> which is an average price between the two countries.|$|R
25|$|Urokinase, {{also known}} as urokinase-type {{plasminogen}} activator (uPA), is a serine protease present in humans and other animals. The human urokinase protein was discovered, but not named, by McFarlane and <b>Pilling</b> in 1947. Urokinase was originally isolated from human urine, {{and it is also}} present in the blood and in the extracellular matrix of many tissues. The primary physiological substrate of this enzyme is plasminogen, which is an inactive form (zymogen) of the serine protease plasmin. Activation of plasmin triggers a proteolytic cascade that, depending on the physiological environment, participates in thrombolysis or extracellular matrix degradation. This cascade had been involved in vascular diseases and cancer progression.|$|E
25|$|While the {{organizing}} and election planning was centralized, policy development {{was to be}} decentralized. In February 2004, the Green Party of Canada Living Platform was initiated by the Party's former Head of Platform and Research, Michael <b>Pilling.</b> Using wiki technology, {{the goal of the}} Living Platform was to open the party's participatory democracy to the public to help validate its policies against broad public input. It also made it easy for candidates to share their answers to public interest group questionnaires, find the best answers to policy questions, and for even rural and remote users, and Canadians abroad, to contribute to Party policy intelligence.|$|E
25|$|The former Church of St Mark, Old Leeds Road, Huddersfield, was an Anglican parish {{church in}} West Yorkshire. It was {{designed}} in 1886 by Barber when the parish of St Peter's was split {{and a new}} building was required to accommodate a growing congregation. It was opened in 1887. Among the vicars posted in this benefice were the very popular Canon Percy Holbrook, the notoriously unfortunate Reverend Jonas <b>Pilling</b> {{who was involved in}} a standoff with his congregation for many years, the sociable Reverend Robert Alfred Humble who died in mysterious circumstances, and the eloquent preacher Reverend Joseph Miller, who had previously been a Congregational minister.|$|E

50|$|The first cure Maddy {{developed}} {{consisted of}} two <b>pills.</b> In the first <b>pill,</b> the nanos (tiny robot machinery widely used throughout the prettytime) were {{to break down the}} lesions. The nanos in the second <b>pill</b> were to stop the nanos in the first <b>pill</b> from spreading. Both <b>pills</b> were to be taken together. Since Zane only took the first <b>pill,</b> his brain was permanently damaged, which ultimately led to his death.|$|R
25|$|The French began {{building}} their line quickly, and finished construction in 1895, while the British worked slowly. At {{the time of}} the Beirut–Damascus line's inception, Pilling's company only managed to build a special port in Haifa to aid in the line's construction. Eight kilometers of standard gauge railroad were laid, between Haifa and Yagur, and a 20km dike was created for the next stage of construction. Due to the competition from the French railway in Beirut, the port of Haifa became less attractive to international traders and that, coupled with strife within the Syria Ottoman Railway Company, caused <b>Pilling</b> to go bankrupt and lose the permit for the railway.|$|E
25|$|Controversy {{emerged during}} the 1880s; Kent and Nottinghamshire objected to the bowling actions of John Crossland and George Nash. Nottinghamshire even {{went as far as}} refusing to play against Lancashire. Although the 1880s was a period of {{controversy}} and modest results for the club, it was also a time in which some club records were established. In 1885 George Kemp (later 1st Baron Rochdale) scored Lancashire’s first century in a Roses Match. In that same year Johnny Briggs and Dick <b>Pilling</b> set a first-class record partnership for the tenth wicket of 173 that stood until 1899 and has not been bettered by Lancashire. The club shared the title of champions with Surrey in 1889.|$|E
25|$|In 1885, Briggs {{developed}} amazingly as a bowler: having scarcely bowled at all {{in previous}} seasons, he took 67 wickets for 13.74 each, and in 1886, his bowling helped England achieve a 3–0 cleansweep of the series, their last whitewash victory {{in a series of}} three or more Tests in the Ashes until 1977. His batting did not suffer: Briggs hit a career-best 186 against Surrey at Liverpool – adding a then-record 173 for the tenth wicket with Dick <b>Pilling.</b> In the exceptionally dry summer of 1887, Briggs took 100 wickets in a season for the first time, whilst in the appalling summer of 1888 he was consistently deadly on the treacherous pitches. His 160 wickets cost only 10.49 each, and the following year he was a Wisden Cricketer of the Year. He was ruthless on the matting in South Africa’s first two Test matches in 1888/9 (only canonised as such much later), taking 15 for 28 in the second Test, of which fourteen were clean bowled.|$|E
5000|$|Carmody v. Toll Brothers: In this {{landmark}} {{and often}} cited case, Grant & Eisenhofer successfully invalidated an onerous and controversial {{form of a}} poison <b>pill</b> {{referred to as a}} “dead-hand” poison <b>pill.</b> The dead-hand poison <b>pill</b> was a defensive mechanism that allowed the <b>pill</b> to be redeemed or withdrawn only by those directors who were on the board at the time the poison <b>pill</b> was adopted, referred to as the “continuing directors,” or their hand-picked successors. The <b>pill</b> had the effect of entrenching existing board members. The oppressive nature of the <b>pill</b> drew wide attention and criticism from institutional investors and corporate governance commentators. While a federal court in Georgia had previously upheld dead-hand poison <b>pills,</b> G&E challenged the <b>pill</b> in the Delaware Chancery Court and won. [...] After Toll Brothers, G&E successfully challenged the dead-hand <b>pills</b> in actions against companies across the country that failed to remove them. Today as a result of Toll Brothers, dead-hand poison <b>pills</b> are nearly extinct.|$|R
50|$|Splitting <b>pills</b> {{may result}} in uneven {{splitting}} and creating pieces which will not deliver accurate dosage. <b>Pills</b> which are split might not be correctly halved, making the cut pieces unequal in size. Some <b>pills</b> are difficult to split. Some <b>pills</b> are unsafe to split, {{and there could be}} mistakes in identifying when <b>pills</b> should not be split.|$|R
50|$|Contraceptive {{efficacy}} may be impaired by: 1) missing {{more than}} one active <b>pill</b> in a packet, 2) delay in starting the next packet of active <b>pills</b> (i.e., extending the pill-free, inactive or placebo <b>pill</b> period beyond 7 days), 3) intestinal malabsorption of active <b>pills</b> due to vomiting or diarrhea, 4) drug interactions with active <b>pills</b> that decrease contraceptive estrogen or progestogen levels.|$|R
25|$|Jack Bond became Lancashire {{captain in}} 1968 and {{remained}} in the position until 1972. During his tenure, Lancashire performed well in the championship, finishing third in 1970 and 1971. His biggest triumph as captain was the five one day trophies he secured during his five-year captaincy. Farokh Engineer joined Lancashire in 1968, and Clive Lloyd joined in 1969; together Lloyd and Engineer helped establish Lancashire {{as one of the}} best one day sides in England. The silverware included a hat-trick of Gillette Cups (1970–72) and the Sunday League twice in successive seasons (1969–1970). Mainstays of the successful one day side included Clive Lloyd, David Lloyd, Barry Wood, Harry <b>Pilling,</b> Frank Hayes, Peter Lever, Ken Shuttleworth, David Hughes and Jack Simmons. In the Gillette Cup semi-final against Gloucestershire in 1971, David Hughes walked to the crease at 8.45pm and hit 24 from an over in near darkness to win the match. David Lloyd was captain from 1973 to 1977 and secured Lancashire’s fourth Gillette Cup in 1975, and coming runners up in 1974 and 1976. However, in the late 1970s, the team that had been so dominant in the one day format began to break up. Despite boasting international players such as Lloyd and Engineer, Lancashire’s first-class performances never matched the success of the limited overs team.|$|E

500|$|Bovid leather {{is tough}} and durable, with the {{additional}} advantage {{that it can be}} made into leathers of varying thicknesses - from soft clothing leather to hard shoe leather.

50|$|<b>Pills</b> do not {{interfere}} with the functionality of the textile, unless a spot with a lot of <b>pills</b> turns into a hole in the fabric. This is because both <b>pills</b> and holes are caused by the fabric wearing—a <b>pill</b> is fibre that was in the cloth. After the <b>pill</b> forms the fabric is thinner there, increasing the likelihood that a hole will form.|$|R
50|$|A <b>pill</b> {{organizer}} (<b>pill</b> organiser in British English), <b>pill</b> container, or <b>pill</b> box is {{a special}} container for storing scheduled doses of one's medications. <b>Pill</b> organizers usually have square-shaped compartments for {{each day of the}} week, although other more compact and discreet versions have come to market, including cylindrical and pen-shaped cases. Some organizers have multiple sections, corresponding with different times of the day. <b>Pill</b> organizers are viewed as a way to prevent or reduce medication errors {{on the part of the}} patient.|$|R
50|$|Combined oral {{contraceptive}} <b>pills</b> {{should be taken}} {{at the same time}} each day. If one or more tablets are forgotten for more than 12 hours, contraceptive protection will be reduced. Most brands of combined <b>pills</b> are packaged in one of two different packet sizes, with days marked off for a 28-day cycle. For the 21-pill packet, a <b>pill</b> is consumed daily for three weeks, followed by a week of no <b>pills.</b> For the 28-pill packet, 21 <b>pills</b> are taken, followed by a week of placebo or sugar <b>pills.</b> A woman on the <b>pill</b> will have a withdrawal bleed sometime during the placebo week, and is still protected from pregnancy during this week. There are also two newer combination birth control <b>pills</b> (Yaz 28 and Loestrin 24 Fe) that have 24 days of active hormone <b>pills,</b> followed by 4 days of placebo.|$|R
