40|$|The wet-bulb potenbid {{temperature}} and the equivalent potential temperature {{have both been}} regularly employed in air-mass analysis as an identification invariant for a. ir undergoing pseudoadia. batic changes; and since there is an underlying relation between these two quantities, it appears worth while to derive the equat,ion for t'ransforming one into t,he other. The following notation will be used: w=mising ratio in grams of water vapor per gram of dry air; y=number of grams of liquid water per gram of dry air; €=w+y; T = air temperature; T,=wet-bulb temperature;. &=partial potential temperature; B. =equivalent potential temperature (l),(2); Ow = wet-bulb potential temperature; T, = temperature at the condensatiou level; e, = water-vapor pressure (since saturation is assumed, this is the maximum vapor pressure); pd=partial pressure of dry air; p,=pressure at condensation level; c,=specific heat of dry air (0. 240 cal/gm); L=latent heat of condensation of water vapor; L= 594. 9 - 00. 51 t (3); c=specific heat of liquid water; A=reciprocal of the mechanical equivalent of heat, (2. 392 X 10 - 8); R=gas constant for dry air (2. 87 XlOe c. g. 8. units).

The results were {{then used to}} read off the values of wet-bulb <b>potential</b> <b>temperature,</b> equivalent <b>potential</b> <b>temperature</b> and mixing ratio by following pseudo-adiabatic chart from condensation level, 500 mb to 1000 mb level. Two of the aforementioned read off parameters: wet-bulb <b>potential</b> <b>temperature</b> and equivalent <b>potential</b> <b>temperature</b> were then used to estimate precipitable water values respectively while one of the parameters, mixing ratio was used to calculate for precipitable water. With reference to calculated precipitable water, the impact of wet-bulb <b>potential</b> <b>temperature</b> and equivalent <b>potential</b> <b>temperature</b> on precipitable water was compared. The comparison shows that wet-bulb <b>potential</b> <b>temperature</b> gives excellent impact on precipitable water than equivalent <b>potential</b> <b>temperature</b> in many locations...|$|R

40|$|The Circum-Superior Large Igneous Province (LIP) {{consists}} predominantly of ultramafic-mafic lavas and sills {{with minor}} felsic components, distributed as various segments along {{the margins of}} the Superior Province craton. Ultramafic-mafic dykes and carbonatite complexes of the LIP also intrude the more central parts of the craton. Most of this magmatism occurred ∼ 1880 Ma. Previously a wide range of models have been proposed for the different segments of the CSLIP with the upper mantle as the source of magmatism. New major and trace element and Nd-Hf isotopic data reveal that the segments of the CSLIP can be treated as a single entity formed in a single tectonomagmatic environment. In contrast to most previous studies that have proposed a variety of geodynamic settings, the CSLIP is interpreted to have formed from a single mantle plume. Such an origin is consistent with the high MgO and Ni contents of the magmatic rocks, trace element signatures that similar to oceanic-plateaus and ocean island basalts and εNd-εHf isotopic signatures which are each more negative than those of the estimated depleted upper mantle at ∼ 1880 Ma. Further support for a mantle plume origin comes from calculated high degrees of <b>partial</b> melting, mantle <b>potential</b> <b>temperatures</b> significantly greater than estimated ambient Proterozoic mantle and the presence of a radiating dyke swarm. The location of most of the magmatic rocks along the Superior Province margins probably represents the deflection of plume material by the thick cratonic keel towards regions of thinner lithosphere at the craton margins.

40|$|An {{analysis}} of the overturning circulation in dry isentropic coordinates using reanalysis data is presented. The meridional mass fluxes on surfaces of constant dry <b>potential</b> <b>temperature</b> but distinct equivalent <b>potential</b> <b>temperature</b> are separated into southward and northward contributions. The separation identifies thermodynamically distinct mass fluxes moving in opposite directions. The eddy meridional water vapor transport is shown {{to be associated with}} large poleward and equatorward mass fluxes occurring at the same value of dry <b>potential</b> <b>temperature</b> but different equivalent <b>potential</b> <b>temperature.</b> These mass fluxes, referred to here as the moist recirculation, are associated with an export of water vapor from the subtropics connecting the Hadley cell to the midlatitude storm tracks. The poleward branch of the moist recirculation occurs at mean equivalent <b>potential</b> <b>temperatures</b> comparable to upper tropospheric dry <b>potential</b> <b>temperature</b> values, indicating that typical poleward-moving air parcels can ascend to the tropopause. The analysis suggests that these air parcels ascend on the equatorward side of storm tracks by following moist isentropes reminiscent of upright deep convection, while on the poleward side their moist isentropes are indicative of large-scale slantwise convection. In the equatorward branch, the analysis describes typical air parcels that follow their dry isentropes until they get injected into the boundary layer where they are subsequently moistened. The moist recirculation along with the mean equivalent <b>potential</b> <b>temperature</b> of its poleward and equatorward components are used to recover an approximate overturning circulation on moist isentropes from which it is shown that the moist recirculation accounts for the difference between the meridional circulation averaged on dry and on moist isentropes...|$|R
