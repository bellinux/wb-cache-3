6000|$|Peals of {{laughter}} (once you {{are allowed to}} be non-official) could not fail, as an ovation, from the King;--so report the French Biographers. But there was, besides, strict promise that the Piece should be suppressed: [...] "Never do to send our President pirouetting through the world in this manner, with his wig on fire; promise me, on your honor!" [...] Voltaire promised. But, alas, how could Voltaire perform! Once more the Rhadamanthine fact is: Voltaire, as King's Chamberlain, was bound, without any <b>promise,</b> <b>to</b> <b>forbear,</b> and rigidly suppress such an AKAKIA against the King's Perpetual President. But withal let candid readers consider {{how difficult it was}} to do. The absurd blusterous Turkey-cock, who has, every now and then, been tyrannizing over you for twenty years, here you have him filled with gunpowder, so to speak, and the train laid. There wants but one spark,--(edition printed in Holland, edition done in Berlin, plenty of editions made or makable by a little surreptitious legerdemain,--and I never knew whether it was AKAKIA in print, or AKAKIA in manuscript, that King and King's Chamberlain were now reading together, nor does it matter much):--your Turkey surreptitiously stuffed with gunpowder, I say; train ready waiting; one flint-spark will shoot him aloft, scatter him as flaming ruin on all the winds: and you are, once and always, to withhold said spark. Perhaps, had AKAKIA not yet been written--But all lies ready there; one spark will do it, at any moment;--and there are unguarded moments, and the Tempter must prevail!-- ...|$|E

5000|$|Consider the uncle's {{situation}} above. If {{the same}} uncle had instead told his 17-year-old nephew the following offer: [...] "if {{you do not}} smoke cigarettes and do not engage females before your 18th birthday, then I will pay you $500". On the nephew's 18th birthday, he asks the uncle to pay up, and this time, in the subsequent lawsuit, the nephew may win. Although the promise of not smoking was not valuable consideration (it was already legally prohibited), virtually all states allow some sort of engagement by minors. Even though the engagement by minors is legally restricted, there are circumstances where it is legal, and thus the <b>promise</b> <b>to</b> <b>forbear</b> from it entirely has legal value. However, the uncle would still be relieved from the liability if his nephew smoked a cigarette, even though that consideration is valueless, because it was paired with something of legal value; therefore, adherence to the entire, collective agreement is necessary.|$|E
50|$|Soon {{after his}} {{election}} Edwin gave offence by attending a nonconformist worship {{on the afternoons}} of Sunday, 31 October and 7 November, in full civic state. A meeting of the court of aldermen was held on Tuesday, 9 November, to consider a complaint of the sword-bearer against the lord mayor for compelling his attendance on the occasion: Edwin had been deserted by all his officers except the sword-bearer, who was locked in a pew. His lordship <b>promised</b> <b>to</b> <b>forbear</b> the practice for the future, and it was ordered 'that the like practice shall {{not be used for}} the time to come'. A letter written 11 November states that the meeting-house attended by the lord mayor was More's. Walter Wilson and others state that it was Pinners' Hall; a contemporary skit, 'A Dialogue between Jack and Will,' describes it as Salters' Hall. Gilbert Burnet states that the bill for preventing occasional conformity had its origin in Edwin's state visit to Pinners' Hall (Hist. V. 49).|$|R

40|$|It is {{generally}} {{held that a}} new promise by a debtor to his creditor to pay an overdue debt in installments is not a sufficient consideration for any return promise by the creditor. In jurisdictions following this rule, a new bilateral agreement between a debtor who promises to pay in installments and a creditor who promises forbearance is not valid. In Hay v. Fortier (1917) 102 Atl. 294, the Supreme Court of Maine fully endorses this rule, but it proceeds to hold that the new promise of the debtor becomes binding by estoppel {{as soon as the}} creditor has actually forborne in accordance with his invalid <b>promise</b> <b>to</b> <b>forbear...</b>|$|E

60|$|WISE. I {{know that}} it is as {{possible}} for a man <b>to</b> <b>forbear</b> crying that hath repentance, as it is for a man <b>to</b> <b>forbear</b> groaning that feeleth deadly pain. He that looketh into the book of Psalms, where repentance is most lively set forth even in its true and proper effects, shall their find that crying, strong crying, hearty crying, great crying, and incessant crying, hath been the fruits of repentance; but none of this had this Mr. Badman, therefore he died in his sins.|$|R

60|$|I {{might give}} you a great number more of the holy sayings of good men whereby they express how they were, what they felt, and whether they cried or no when repentance was wrought in them. Alas, alas, it is as {{possible}} for a man, when the pangs of guilt are upon him, <b>to</b> <b>forbear</b> praying, {{as it is for}} a woman, when pangs of travail are upon her, <b>to</b> <b>forbear</b> crying. If all the world should tell me that such a man hath repentance, yet if he is not a praying man I should not be persuaded to believe it.|$|R

6000|$|Sir, {{know you}} not yet, that a {{difference}} {{is to be}} put betwixt those rules that discover the essentials of holiness, and those that in themselves are not such; and that that of faith and the moral law is the one, and baptism, &c. the other. Is not love to God, abhorrence of idols, <b>to</b> <b>forbear</b> blaspheming, <b>to</b> honour our parents, to do no murder, <b>to</b> <b>forbear</b> theft, not <b>to</b> bear false witness, nor covet, &c. are not (I say) these the precepts of the Lord Jesus, because delivered by Moses? Or, are these such as may better be broken, than for want of light <b>to</b> <b>forbear</b> baptism with water? Or, doth a man while he liveth in the neglect of these, and in the mean time bustle about those you call gospel commands, most honour Christ, or best fit himself for fellowship with the saints? Need I tell you, That the faith of Christ, with the ten commandments, are as much now gospel commands as baptism; {{and ought to be}} in as much, and far more respect with the holy ones than that, or other the like.[5] ...|$|R
