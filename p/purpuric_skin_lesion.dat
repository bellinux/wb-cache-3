40|$|A 58 -year-old male visited our {{hospital}} with a complaint of epigastric pain for 2 days. Physical examination showed no <b>purpuric</b> <b>skin</b> <b>lesion.</b> Abdominal computed tomography scan showed concentric segmental wall thickening of the duodenum. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed diffuse erythematous mucosa with exudates at the duodenum. On 4 th hospital day, he developed hematochezia. colonoscopy showed circumferential erythematous mucosa with ulcerative hemorrhage at terminal ileum. The microscopic examination identified lots of neutrophil infiltration and deposition of immunoglobulin A (IgA) on vascular endothelium. Treatment with oral prednisone 40 mg was initiated. On 19 th day, the patient developed hematuria and proteinuria. Histologic examination on renal biopsy showed focal proliferative glomerulonephritis and strongly positive IgA staining in the glomerular mesangium. Severe hemorrhagic mucosa on endoscopy, deposition of IgA on kidney and intestinal vascular endothelium suggests the diagnosis of Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP).

40|$|Anti-tuberculosis drugs {{frequently}} {{result in}} cutaneous adverse reactions, including pruritus, maculopapular exanthems, and urticaria. However, anti-tuberculosis drug-associated cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis (CLV) has been rarely reported. We describe {{a case of}} CLV induced by rifampin and pyrazinamide. A 38 -year-old male {{had been diagnosed with}} pulmonary tuberculosis two months ago and then he started standard anti-tuberculosis therapy with isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide. Purpuric lesions developed in the extremities after 1. 5 months of anti-tuberculosis medication; the lesions progressively spread over the entire body. Histopathology of the <b>purpuric</b> <b>skin</b> <b>lesion</b> was consistent with leukocytoclastic vasculitis. The skin lesion improved after cessation of anti-tuberculosis medications and treatment with oral corticosteroids and antihistamines. Anti-tuberculosis drugs were rechallenged one at a time over 3 days. Purpura recurred on the right forearm and forehead after taking 300 mg of rifampin. The skin lesion disappeared after taking oral prednisolone. Finally, 1, 500 mg of pyrazinamide was readministrated, and then purpuric lesions recurred on both forearms.

40|$|The {{severity}} of clinical features and the outcomes in previous series of patients reported with Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) vary greatly, {{probably due to}} selection bias. To establish the actual clinical spectrum of HSP in all age groups using an unselected and wide series of patients diagnosed at a single center, we performed a retrospective review of 417 patients classified as having HSP according to the criteria proposed by Michel et al. Of 417 patients, 240 were male and 177 female, with a median age {{at the time of}} disease diagnosis of 7. 5 years (interquartile range [IQR], 5. 3 - 20. 1 yr). Three-quarters of the patients were children or young people aged 20 years or younger (n = 315), and one-quarter were adults (n = 102). The most frequent precipitating events were a previous infection (38 %), usually an upper respiratory tract infection, and/or drug intake (18. 5 %) shortly before the onset of the vasculitis. At disease onset the most common manifestations were skin lesions (55. 9 %), nephropathy (24 %), gastrointestinal involvement (13. 7 %), joint symptoms (9. 1 %), and fever (6. 2 %). Cutaneous involvement occurring in all patients, mainly <b>purpuric</b> <b>skin</b> <b>lesion,</b> was the most common manifestation when the vasculitis was fully established, followed by gastrointestinal (64. 5 %), joint (63. 1 %), and renal involvement (41. 2 %). The main laboratory findings were leukocytosis (36. 7 %), anemia (8. 9 %), and increased serum IgA levels (31. 7 %). The most frequent therapies used were corticosteroids (35 %), nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (14 %), and cytotoxic agents (5 %). After a median follow-up of 12 months (IQR, 2 - 38 mo), complete recovery was observed in most cases (n = 346; 83. 2 %), while persistent, usually mild, nephropathy was observed in only 32 (7. 7 %) cases. Relapses were observed in almost a third of patients (n = 133; 31. 9 %). In conclusion, although HSP is a typical vasculitis affecting children and young people, it is not uncommon in adults. The prognosis is favorable in most cases, depending largely on renal involvement...|$|E

Polysaccharides in these LPS were similar by gas chromatography except for one galactose-deficient strain of MGC (135 B). LPS from MGC and enterics were equally potent for the general Shwartzman reaction and mouse lethality, but LPS from MGC was 5 – 10 times more potent in inducing the dermal Shwartzman reaction.

He complained of lethargy, dyspnoea, epistaxis and myalgic pains. He was severely thin with <b>purpuric</b> <b>skin</b> <b>lesions</b> over his knuckles, elbows and shins (figures 1 and 2). 1 Scurvy was suggested and confirmed by dermatology. The patient was started on ascorbic acid (400 mg/ 24 h) and initially improved, but died later of a nosocomial infection. Scurvy is a state of vitamin C (ascorbic acid) deficiency. Ascorbic acid is used in the synthesis of collagen, neurotrans-mitters and helps in dietary iron absorption. Deficiency results in poor wound healing, defective capillary walls and anaemia. The UK incidence of clinical scurvy is unknown, but the prevalence of vitamin C deficiency is estimated at 25 % in men and 16 % in women and is associated with low income, poor diet and smoking. 1 Symptoms/signs include lethargy, purpura, epistaxis, myalgia, dyspnoea, spongy gums and tooth loss. Complications include haemorrhage, neuropathies, immuno-compromise and hepatic and renal failure. Scurvy is believed to be historical or a diagnosis of developing countries. However, it is more common than perceived. Patients can easily be treated with dietary input and ascorbic acid supplementation. Symptoms often resolve in 1 e 2 weeks...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Letrozole, an {{aromatase}} inhibitor, is {{a commonly}} used neo-adjuvant drug to treat hormone-sensitive breast cancer. There {{have been a}} few cases of aromatase inhibitor induced vasculitis but the first case of letrozole-induced vasculitis was reported from Switzerland in 2014 (Digklia et al.) [1]. Presentation of case: We report the case of a 72 -year-old woman with a small breast cancer. She was started on pre-operative letrozole (2. 5  mg/d) whilst awaiting surgery. Ten days later she presented with burning pain and <b>purpuric</b> <b>skin</b> <b>lesions</b> which progressed to extensive ischaemic superficial necrosis of the lower limb skin, resolving over 3 – 4 months after local and systemic steroids. Histologically, it showed leucocytoclasis with evidence of eosinophilia consistent with a diagnosis of cutaneous leukocytoclastic small vessel vasculitis. Discussion: The initial clinical presentation was severe burning pain around the ankles and a spreading violaceous rash. Letrozole was stopped. Wide local excision (lumpectomy) and sentinel node biopsy were postponed because of the accompanying pneumonitis and gastrointestinal upset, and were carried out 3. 5 months later. Fortunately, the tumour size did not increase, but appeared to reduce, and axillary lymph nodes remained negative, i. e., this patient’s cancer outcome {{does not seem to have}} been jeopardized. Conclusion: Leukocytoclastic vasculitis is a hypersensitivity reaction that is usually self-resolving, though our case needed systemic steroid treatment. Letrozole is a commonly used drug in clinical practice and prescribers should be aware of this rare side effect, which in our case delayed treatment without any apparent harm and possibly reduced tumour size...|$|R
40|$|Levamisole {{has been}} {{increasingly}} {{used as an}} adulterant of cocaine in recent years, emerging {{as a public health}} challenge worldwide. Levamisole-associated toxicity manifests clinically as a systemic vasculitis, consisting of cutaneous, hematological, and renal lesions, among others. Purpura retiform, cutaneous necrosis, intravascular thrombosis, neutropenia, and less commonly crescentic nephritis have been described in association with anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs) and other autoantibodies. Here we report the case of a 49 -year-old male who was a chronic cocaine user, and who presented spontaneous weight loss, arthralgia, and 3 weeks before admission <b>purpuric</b> <b>skin</b> <b>lesions</b> in the earlobes and in the anterior thighs. His laboratory tests on admission showed serum creatinine of 4. 56 mg/dL, white blood count 3, 800 /μL, hemoglobin 7. 3 g/dL, urinalysis with 51 white blood cells/μL and 960 red blood cells/μL, and urine protein-to-creatinine ratio 1. 20. Serum ANCA testing was positive (> 1 : 320), as well as serum anti-myeloperoxidase and anti-proteinase 3 antibodies. Urine toxicology screen was positive for cocaine and levamisole, with 62. 8 % of cocaine, 32. 2 % of levamisole, and 5 % of an unidentified substance. Skin and renal biopsies were diagnostic for leukocytoclastic vasculitis and pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis, respectively. The patient showed a good clinical response to cocaine abstinence, and use of corticosteroids and intravenous cyclophosphamide. Last serum creatinine was 1. 97 mg/dL, white blood cell count 7, 420 /μL, and hemoglobin level 10. 8 g/dL. In levamisole-induced systemic vasculitis, the early institution of cocaine abstinence, concomitant with the use of immunosuppressive drugs in severe cases, may prevent permanent end organ damage and associate with better clinical outcomes...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Peters anomaly {{is a rare}} {{developmental}} malformation {{involving the}} anterior segment of the eye, which culminates in amblyopia or congenital blindness. Multiple ocular and/or systemic malformations have been observed with this anomaly, and novel comorbidities continue to be reported. Case Presentation: The probands were monozygotic twin boys (twin I and twin II) born to consanguineous parents at 36 weeks of gestation. Coarse facial features and deep-seated eyes were noted at birth. At 6 months, ophthalmic examination revealed that both twins were unable to blink in response to light, or to fixate and follow a moving object. Both twins had prominent horizontal nystagmus. Slit-lamp examination demonstrated varying degrees of central leukoma (corneal opacity) associated with iridocorneal adhesion, which is characteristic of type I Peters anomaly. No cataractous changes were observed. Normal intraocular pressure and disorganized retina were observed. Pupillary abnormalities included bilaterally underdeveloped pupils and bilateral absence of pupils was noted. Ocular MRI showed bilateral microphthalmia and optic nerve hypoplasia, with a small optic chiasm in both twins. At this age, the diagnosis of Peters anomaly was made. At 16 months of age, both twins developed deep venous thrombosis and <b>purpuric</b> <b>skin</b> <b>lesions.</b> Investigations revealed a hereditary thrombophilia secondary to a homozygous mutation causing protein C deficiency, which is a rare thrombotic condition. Ocular ultrasonography revealed bilateral vitreous hemorrhaging linked to altered coagulation. One twin developed bilateral inguinal hernia and cryptorchidism. Conclusion: The novel concordance of Peters anomaly in these monozygotic twins sharing a mutation in PROC gene provides further evidence that this anomaly has a genetic basis. Hypoplasia of the optic nerves and optic chiasm, along with severe protein C deficiency and bilateral absence of the pupils, are associated comorbidities that have not previously been reported with this anomaly...|$|R
40|$|Cutaneous manifestations in disseminated {{strongyloidiasis}} are infrequent {{but should}} raise the suspicion for its diagnosis. We retrospectively evaluated the charts of six patients with cancer and a proven diagnosis of disseminated strongyloidiasis. All patients had received prophylaxis with albendazole before starting antineoplastic therapy, which included high-dose steroids. They presented with septic shock, acute respiratory failure and characteristic <b>purpuric</b> periumbilical <b>skin</b> <b>lesions.</b> Strongyloides larvae {{were identified in}} tracheal aspirates (n= 5), gastric aspirates (n= 4), lung (n= 2) and skin biopsies (n= 2). All patients died despite antihelminthic therapy and intensive care support. Key Words: Sepsis, purpura, cancer, disseminated strongyloidiasis, corticosteroids. Immunocompromised patients may develop disseminated strongyloidiasis, which results in high mortality rates [1, 2]. Therefore, clinical suspicion is essential for early diagnosis and improvement in survival. Cutaneous manifestations in disseminated strongyloidiasis are infrequent, {{but they may be}} a valuable diagnostic sign [3 - 7]. We report si...|$|R
40|$|Acute {{plasma cell}} leukemia with Bence-Jones {{proteinuria}} is reported in a 60 year old lranien male with a 25 day history of acute onset of fever. weakness, weight loss, diarrhea and bloody stools. The patient was noted to be cachectic and anemic. He had <b>purpuric</b> and petechial <b>skin</b> <b>lesions,</b> generalized lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly. Up to 80 % immature plasma cells {{were present in the}} peripheral blood and the platelet count was 10, 000. Bone marrow was hypercellular and that most of it was composed of immature plasma cells. Serum electrophoresis showed increased beta globulins and Bence-Jones protein was strongly positive in the urine. The patient died after nine days in uremic coma with haemorrhagic diathesis.

40|$|A anemia que se processa em caes quando se administra grandes doses de benzoato de estradiol, nao parece ser produzida por {{processes}} conhecidos de destrui?ao intra-organica. Esta substantia paraliza os fenomenos de rege¬nerate hematica, parece interferir por processo desconhecido na fisiologia sanguinea, produz graves lesoes na rede circulatoria que irriga a mucosa do intestino, principalmente jejuno, ocasipnando nesse orgao «extravasamento variavel de sangue, fator seguramente coadjuvante na formação da anemia. The characteristic {{findings in}} the pathological picture presented by 60 dogs when administered large doses of estradiol benzoate subcutaneously in an oil vehicle are: thrombocytopenia, aplastic anemia, which follows a brief latent period, intestinal tract haemorrhages, haemorrhagic lesions occurring principally in the mucosa of the jejunum, followed by prostration and death generally within 1 to 3 weeks. Irregular findings are leucocytosis, <b>purpuric</b> <b>skin</b> <b>lesions,</b> visceral haemorrhages and pyoid bone marrow. The total circulating hemoglobin was determined in 9 dogs {{before and after the}} anemia was established, thus verifying the total hemoglobin loss. The blood loss through intestinal haemorrhages during the observation period was determined by benzidine test. The quantity of hemoglobin recovered from the feces in the form of hematin varied between 30 and 70 % of the total hemoglobin which disappeared from the circulation. In order to ascertain the degree of intra-organic blood destruction the bilirubin eliminated in the urine of dogs with gall-bladder renal type of fis¬tula was determined daily and these values compared with those obtained for normal animals. The blood destruction as measured by this method was practically nil. An attempt was made to determine whether the presence of large quan¬tities of blood in the intestine might exert a paralyzing effect on the regene¬ration of hemoglobin in dogs rendered anemic through haemorrhage. Ne¬gative results were obtained. Estradiol benzoate administered to dogs during the period of hematic regeneration which occurs in the recovery stage of ane-mia produced by acetyl-phenyl hydrazine demonstrated that the estradiol in¬terferes but little when the regenerative processes have already begun. Repeated transfusions given during the stage of acute anemia practi¬cally do not affect the period of survival. The authors conclude that the main action of estradiol benzoate on the blood physiology of dogs is still obscure. The anemia is not produced by the intra-organic destruction of hemoglobin by known processes and doubtless the blood loss through the intestinal haemarrhages constitutes an important ac¬cessory factor in the mechanism of bringing out this anemia...|$|R
40|$|Randall-type {{heavy chain}} {{deposition}} disease (HCDD) {{is a rare}} disorder characterized by glomerular and peritubular amorphous deposits of a monoclonal immunoglobulin heavy chain (HC) bearing a deletion of the first constant domain (CH 1). Natural history and pathophysiological mechanisms of HCDD remain poorly described. Here, we report the clinicopathological and immunological features of 14 HCDD patients, with determination of HC amino acid sequences deduced {{from that of the}} corresponding complementary DNAs in the bone marrow plasma cells in 10 patients. At baseline, median serum creatinine was 1. 6 mg/dl (range: 1. 2 to 4. 2) with a median estimated glomerular filtration rate of 36 ml/min/ 1. 73 m 2. Median proteinuria was 3. 7 g/day (range: 0. 4 to 18), associated with nephrotic syndrome (57 %), hematuria (86 %) and hypertension (93 %). Three patients had biopsy proven extrarenal HC deposits, which manifested with nodular goiter and liver cholestasis, interstitial pneumonia, <b>purpuric</b> <b>skin</b> <b>lesions</b> and ulcerohemorragic oesophagitis, respectively. Multiple myeloma was diagnosed in 4 patients and lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma in one case. A serum truncated free HC was detected in 7 patients. Renal pathological studies revealed nodular glomerulosclerosis in all cases. By immunofluorescence, deposits stained with anti-a (3 patients) and anti-g (11 patients) conjugates (g 1, n= 8; g 3, n= 1; g 4, n= 2). Partial or complete deletion of either CH 1 (12 patients) or CH 1 + CH 2 (2 patients) was observed in all patients. Molecular analysis of the HC variable regions (VH) revealed unusual residues in CDR and FR regions in most but not all HCs, without any common peculiarity. In 9 / 10 patients, VH displayed isoelectric points in cationic range (> 8). All patients received chemotherapy. After a median follow-up of 27 months, renal parameters improved in 10 / 14 patients and only one patient developed end-stage renal disease. The present large series confirm that nodular glomerulosclerosis is a constant feature in HCDD. Whereas deletion of CH 1 is required for secretion of a free HC by clonal plasma cells, global charge of the variable region probably accounts for tissue deposition, through interaction of cationic VH with anionic proteoglycans in renal basement membranes, as previously suggested in light-chain deposition disease. Early introduction of chemotherapy to suppress the underlying plasma cell clone is likely to improve renal prognosis in HCDD. POITIERS-BU Médecine pharmacie (861942103) / SudocSudocFranceF...|$|R
