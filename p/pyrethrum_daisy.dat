In seven kinds of vegetables grown {{on the property}} Faculty of Horticulture in Lednice in 2014 {{was determined by the}} content of ascorbic acid and antioxidant capacity. The antioxidant capacity was determined by DPPH (diphenyl-s pikrylhydrazylov√Ωm radical). For the determination of ascorbic acid method was chosen liquid chromatography (HPLC). Selected vegetable species were: Swiss chard (Beta vulgaris ssp. Cicla L.), Chinese cabbage (Brassica chinensis L.), savoy cabbeg(Brassica oleracea var. Acephala DC), mizuna (Brassica rapa L. subsp. Nipposinica) pumpkin (Cucurbita maxima) edible chrysanthemum (Chrysanthemum coronarium L.) and radish (Raphanus sativus). For all the vegetables used a single variety. Based on the analysis appears to be a promising <b>pyrethrum</b> <b>daisy</b> chain vegetable species as showed the highest antioxidant capacity while in the stems, leaves and flowers, compared to other vegetable species. It also kale, which was determined at the highest content of ascorbic acid in both its outer and inner sheets, in comparison with other vegetable species...|$|E
