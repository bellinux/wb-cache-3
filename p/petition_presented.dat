25|$|The {{result of}} a local {{election}} may only be overturned {{as a result of}} findings following an election <b>petition</b> <b>presented</b> by one of the candidates or at least four eligible voters. The time limit for presenting a petition is generally 21 days after the election. Alternatively, anyone convicted in a criminal court of corrupt or illegal electoral practice is required to vacate their elected office. A successful challenge through an election petition voids the election itself, such that the otherwise successful candidate is not considered ever lawfully elected. In contrast, a criminal conviction causes a vacancy to arise, but the original election is considered valid. In either case, a person convicted or reported by an election court personally guilty of corrupt practices is additionally barred from holding any elective office or being registered as a voter for a period of five years. For illegal practices, the period of disqualification is three years.|$|E
25|$|Attorney-General, Arthur Rylah, {{rejected}} a second plea to refer Ryan's {{case to the}} Full Court under Section 584 of the Crimes Act. A third attempt to save Ryan, {{in the form of}} a <b>petition</b> <b>presented</b> at the Crown Solicitor's office pleading for clemency, was also rejected. Close secrecy surrounded all government moves on the Ryan case. That evening, a former Pentridge prisoner, Allan John Cane, arrived in Melbourne from Brisbane in a new bid to save Ryan. An affidavit by Cane, which was presented to Cabinet, says he and seven prisoners were outside the cookhouse when they saw and heard a prison warder fire a shot from the No. 1 guard post at Pentridge Prison the day Hodson was shot. Police had interviewed these prisoners but none were called on at the trial to give evidence. Cane was immediately rushed into conference with his solicitor, Bernard Gaynor, who tried to contact cabinet ministers informing them of Cane's arrival. Gaynor telephoned Government House seeking an audience with the Governor, Sir Rohan Delacombe. However, Gaynor was told by a Government House spokesman that nobody would be answering calls until 9am (one hour after Ryan's scheduled execution). Gaynor said Cane's mission had failed.|$|E

500|$|By {{choosing}} a market as the {{location for the}} sale, the couple ensured a large audience, which made their separation a widely witnessed fact. The use of the halter was symbolic; after the sale, it was handed to the purchaser as a signal that the transaction was concluded, and in some instances, those involved would often attempt further to legitimate the sale by forcing the winning bidder to sign a contract, recognising that the seller had no further liability for his wife. In 1735, a successful wife sale in St Clements was announced by the common cryer, who wandered the streets ensuring that local traders {{were aware of the}} former husband's intention not to honour [...] "any debts she should contract". The same point was made in an advertisement placed in the Ipswich Journal in 1789: [...] "no person or persons to intrust her with my name... for she is no longer my right". Those involved in such sales sometimes attempted to legalise the transaction, as demonstrated by a bill of sale for a wife, preserved in the British Museum. The bill is contained in a <b>petition</b> <b>presented</b> to a Somerset Justice of the Peace in 1758, by a wife who about 18months earlier had been sold by her husband for Â£6 6s [...] "for the support of his extravagancy". The petition does not object to the sale, but complains that the husband returned three months later to demand more money from his wife and her new [...] "husband".|$|E

MK Ahmed Tibi, one of many signatories to the petition before the court, said that removing the bodies from the city violated international law and was [...] "intended to hide the truth from the public about the killing that occurred there". Following the court's decision, issued by Supreme Court President Aharon Barak, the IDF stopped clearing the bodies from the camp. It was reported that by the afternoon of April 13, the IDF had determined the location of 23 bodies in the camp which were marked on maps. On April 14, the Supreme Court reversed its decision, and ruled that the IDF could remove the bodies.

2500|$|When {{the plan}} to {{construct}} a columbarium at St Paul's became known, 150 local residents signed a <b>petition</b> <b>presented</b> to Brisbane's Lord Mayor Alderman Frank Edward Roberts, [...] "desiring the district to remain a pleasant residential one" [...] and considering the crematorium or a nearby cemetery a more suitable location for storing ashes. The Brisbane City Council was powerless to act, as the approval was not necessary under their jurisdiction. Contained within an area of 30 by 15 feet (10m x 5m), the columbarium, a roofless structure of four 10 foot (3.3m) high brick walls with a wrought iron gated entrance, was constructed {{at a cost of}} Â£1000 and dedicated on 4 July 1954. The gate was donated in memory of Margaret Pashen by her family. Speaking in defence of the columbarium, the Rector, the Rev. NR Tomlinson, described it as [...] "the modern version of the old church grave yard". At the opening ceremony Archbishop Reginald Halse stated, [...] "Early Christians had raised no objection to cremation, but had buried their dead because of heathen rites which used fire. It was now felt cremation was just as respectful to the dead as burial. It also conformed with the words of the burial service 'ashes to ashes'".

And there was a horse stood with all the {{quarries}} about it, a bonny grey as ever was foaled; and the saddle and the stirrups, and the curb and bit, o' burning gowd, or silver gilded at least; and down, sir, came the king, with all his nobles, dressed out in his hunting-suit of green, doubly laced, and laid down with gowd. I minded the very face o' him, though it was lang since I saw him. But my certie, lad, thought I, times are changed since ye came fleeing down the back stairs of auld Holyrood House, in grit fear, having your breeks in your hand without time to put them on, and Frank Stewart, the wild Earl of Bothwell, hard at your haunches; and if auld Lord Glenvarloch hadna cast his mantle about his arm, and taken bluidy wounds mair than ane in your behalf, you wald not have craw'd sae crouse this day; and so saying, I could not but think your lordship's Sifflication could not be less than most acceptable; and so I banged in among the crowd of lords. Laurie thought me mad, and held me by the cloak-lap till the cloth rave in his hand; and so I banged in right before the king just as he mounted, and crammed the Sifflication into his hand, and he opened it like in amaze; and just as he saw the first line, I was minded to make a reverence, and I had the ill luck to hit his jaud o' a beast on the nose with my hat, and scaur the creature, and she swarved aside, and the king, that sits na mickle better than a draff-pock on the saddle, was like to have gotten a clean coup, and that might have cost my craig a raxing-and he flung down the paper amang the beast's feet, and cried, 'Away wi' the fause loon that brought it!' And they grippit me, and cried treason; and I thought of the Ruthvens that were dirked in their ain house, for, it may be, as small a forfeit. However, they spak only of scourging me, and had me away to the porter's lodge to try the tawse on my back, and I was crying mercy as loud as I could; and the king, when he had righted himself on the saddle, and gathered his breath, cried to do me nae harm; for, said he, he is ane of our ain Norland stots, I ken by the rowt of him,--and they a' laughed and rowted loud eneugh. And then he said, 'Gie him a copy of the Proclamation, and let him go down to the North by the next light collier, before waur come o't.' So they let me go, and rode out, a sniggering, laughing, and rounding in ilk ither's lugs. A sair life I had wi' Laurie Linklater; for he said it wad be the ruin of him. And then, when I told him it was in your matter, he said if he had known before he would have risked a scauding for you, because he minded the brave old lord, your father.
