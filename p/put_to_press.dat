2500|$|The {{process of}} peer review {{does not end}} after a paper completes the {{prepublication}} peer review process. After being <b>put</b> <b>to</b> <b>press,</b> or having been digitally published, the process of peer review continues as publications are read. Readers will often send {{letters to the editor}} of a journal, or correspond with the editor via an on-line journal club. In this way, all 'peers' may offer review and critique of published literature. A variation on this theme is open peer commentary; journals using this process solicit and publish non-anonymous commentaries on the [...] "target paper" [...] together with the paper, and with original authors' reply as a matter of course. The introduction of the [...] "epub ahead of print" [...] practice in many journals has made possible the simultaneous publication of unsolicited letters to the editor together with the original paper in the print issue.|$|E
60|$|So cheerful {{of spirit}} and guiltless of affectation, as true {{practical}} Christianity ever is! I read more of the New Testament in the fresh frank face going up the village beside me, in five minutes, than I have read in anathematising discourses (albeit <b>put</b> <b>to</b> <b>press</b> with enormous flourishing of trumpets), in all my life. I heard more of the Sacred Book in the cordial voice {{that had nothing to}} say about its owner, than in all the would-be celestial pairs of bellows that have ever blown conceit at me.|$|E
60|$|The {{first volume}} of the Sketch-Book was <b>put</b> <b>to</b> <b>press</b> in London, as I had resolved, at my own risk, by a {{bookseller}} unknown to fame, and {{without any of the}} usual arts by which a work is trumpeted into notice. Still some attention had been called to it by the extracts which had previously appeared in the Literary Gazette, and by the kind word spoken by the editor of that periodical, and it was getting into fair circulation, when my worthy bookseller failed before the first month was over, and the sale was interrupted.|$|E

50|$|The {{complaints}} of the subscribers {{and his own}} heavy advances of over 150,000 livres induced Panckoucke, in November 1788, {{to appeal to the}} authors to finish the work. Those who were behind made new contracts, giving their word of honor <b>to</b> <b>put</b> their parts <b>to</b> <b>press</b> by 1788, so that Panckoucke hoped to finish the whole, including the Vocabulaire universel (4 or 5 vols.) by 1792.|$|R
60|$|At this {{juncture}} Scott arrived in London. I {{called to him}} for help, as I was sticking in the mire, and, more propitious than Hercules, he put his own shoulder to the wheel. Through his favorable representations, Murray was quickly induced to undertake the future publication of the work which he had previously declined. A further edition of the first volume was struck off and the second volume was <b>put</b> <b>to</b> <b>press,</b> and from that time Murray became my publisher, conducting himself in all his dealings with that fair, open, and liberal spirit which had obtained for him the well-merited appellation of the Prince of Booksellers.|$|E

60|$|It {{was perhaps}} {{favorable}} to the immediate success of the Spy, that Cooper had few American authors to divide with him the public attention. That crowd of clever {{men and women who}} now write for the magazines, who send out volumes of essays, sketches, and poems, and who supply the press with novels, biographies, and historical works, were then, for the most part, either stammering their lessons in the schools, or yet unborn. Yet it is worthy of note, that just about the time that the Spy made its appearance, the dawn of what we now call our literature was just breaking. The concluding number of Dana's Idle Man, a work neglected at first, but now numbered among the best things of the kind in our language, was issued in the same month. The Sketch Book was then just completed; the world was admiring it, and its author was meditating Bracebridge Hall. Miss Sedgwick, about the same time, made her first essay in that charming series of novels of domestic life in New England, which have gained her so high a reputation. Percival, now unhappily silent, had just <b>put</b> <b>to</b> <b>press</b> a volume of poems. I have a copy of an edition of Hallock's Fanny, published in the same year; the poem of Yamoyden, by Eastburn and Sands, appeared almost simultaneously with it. Livingston was putting the finishing hand to his Report on the Penal Code of Louisiana, a work written with such grave, persuasive eloquence, that it belongs as much to our literature as to our jurisprudence. Other contemporaneous American works there were, now less read. Paul Allen's poem of Noah was just laid on the counters of the booksellers. Arden published, at the same time, in this city, a translation of Ovid's Tristia, in heroic verse, in which the complaints of the effeminate Roman poet were rendered with great fidelity to the original, and sometimes not without beauty. If I may speak of myself, it was in that year that I timidly intrusted to the winds and waves of public opinion a small cargo of my own--a poem entitled The Ages, and half a dozen shorter ones, in a thin duodecimo volume, printed at Cambridge.|$|E
50|$|It {{was at one}} of Fries's soirees that Beethoven had {{his famous}} {{encounter}} with the his rival virtuoso Daniel Steibelt. Beethoven dedicated two piano and violin sonatas, Op. 23 and Op. 24, to Fries, in return for his financial support. Von Fries inadvertently compromised the publication of these sonatas - Beethoven had arranged that, as their sponsor, the sonatas would be supplied to von Fries in manuscript for his exclusive enjoyment for a year prior <b>to</b> <b>putting</b> them <b>to</b> <b>press.</b> However, von Fries was tricked into supplying these manuscripts to the publisher Artaria, who immediately brought out a 'pirated' edition without Beethoven's permission. However, this error was evidently not fatal to Fries's relationship with Beethoven, {{who went on to}} dedicate his Op. 25 quintet and his Seventh Symphony to him.|$|R

The Chancellor laid down the principle that [...] "damages cannot be recovered for a work which is in its nature calculated to do an injury to the public," [...] and assuming Wat Tyler to be of this description, he refused the injunction until Southey should have established his right to the property by an action. Wat Tyler was written {{at the age of}} nineteen, when Southey was a republican, and was entrusted to two booksellers, Messrs. Ridgeway and Symonds, who agreed to publish it, but never <b>put</b> it <b>to</b> <b>press.</b> The MS. was not returned to the author, and in February, 1817, at the interval of twenty-two years, when his sentiments were widely different, it was printed, to his great annoyance, by W. Benbow (see his Scourge for the Laureate (1825), p. 14), Sherwood, Neely and Jones, John Fairburn, and others. It was reported that 60,000 copies were sold (see Life and Correspondence of R. Southey, 1850, iv. 237, 241, 249, 252).] ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{band members}} had a mixed {{experience}} in Hamburg. Harrison later said that [...] "a lot of ghosts materialised {{out of the}} woodwork – people you didn't necessarily want to see again, who had been your best friend one drunken Preludin night back in 1960." [...] McCartney commented: [...] "It was as if we'd mutated into something different and yet we were still just the boys. But we knew and they knew that we'd got famous in the meantime …" [...] The Beatles had also tired of the generally inane questions <b>put</b> <b>to</b> them at <b>press</b> conferences throughout the German tour, with only McCartney attempting to humour the local reporters. At the between-shows press conference in Hamburg, Lennon's impatience was palpable, leading a female reporter to ask why the band had become [...] "so horrid and snobby". On 27 June, the Beatles and their entourage flew from Hamburg to London's Heathrow Airport, where they boarded a Japan Airlines (JAL) flight over the North Pole to Tokyo.|$|R

60|$|When {{the doctor}} made his reappearance {{it was to}} say that his patient was being undressed and <b>put</b> <b>to</b> bed by his negro servant, who, however, would return with the doctor to-night, but that the patient would be left with {{everything}} that was necessary, {{and that he would}} require no attention from the family until the next day.

5|$|After {{several months}} he spent as an {{experimental}} case, military authorities began <b>to</b> <b>press</b> for Tarrare <b>to</b> {{be returned to}} active duty. Dr. Courville was keen to continue his investigations into Tarrare's eating habits and digestive system, and approached General Alexandre deBeauharnais with a suggestion that Tarrare's unusual abilities and behaviour could be <b>put</b> <b>to</b> military use. A document was placed inside a wooden box which was in turn fed to Tarrare. Two days later, the box was retrieved from his excrement, with the document still in legible condition. Courville proposed to deBeauharnais that Tarrare could thus serve as a military courier, carrying documents securely through enemy territory with no risk of their being found if he were searched.|$|R

5000|$|Stamps {{from the}} later plates which run from numbers 71 to 225 are {{relatively}} common, often only worth a few pence {{with the exception}} of plate 225 which is scarce and can be worth a few hundred pounds and plate 77, is very rare and in 2016, an example from this plate was auctioned for UK£495,000. The 1d red plate 77 is rare because usually at least one sheet was printed from a new plate and then sent to Somerset House for approval before the new plate was <b>put</b> <b>to</b> <b>press.</b> When approved, one sheet was kept there as the registration, or imprimatur sheet as it is often known. Any faulty sheets would then have been destroyed by burning at Somerset House and any good ones put into stock in the normal way. Wright and Creeke assert in [...] "The Stamps of the British Isles" [...] that up until 1899 the printers struck off 6 trial sheets of which one chosen as an [...] "imprimatur" [...] and the others put into stock and then issued. It is also worth noting that prior to these example sheets being printed it is certain that some others would have been printed as {{part of the process of}} setting up the printing press with a new plate. So, any example sheets examined should have been returned to be first accounted for and then destroyed if faulty and issued if not, and in the case of plate 77 some stamps have survived. We know the plate must have reached the point of inspection because a letter from Ormond Hill to Perkins Bacon still exists, telling them that he was rejecting two plates as they were not vertically aligned well enough to allow a good standard of perforating and although this letter doesn't mention the plate numbers, they must have been plates 75 and 77 because the date of the letter (7 February 1863) is the same as the date on which the other plates submitted at the same time (76 and 78 to 81) were registered. Hill must have been looking at least one sheet produced from plate 77 (and from plate 75 too as it happens) to have made this decision - so at least one sheet from plate 77 existed at some point. The only alternative is that Hill determined that the plate was poorly aligned by looking at the plate itself but as that would have been so very much more difficult to do than the simpler and usual way of looking at an example sheet there is no reason to think that happened. After all, it is reasonable to assume that he would have wanted to make absolutely sure that plate 77 was unusable before rejecting another plate. We will never know how many copies of this stamp were printed from plate 77, maybe one sheet, maybe half a dozen sheets, but one thing is sure, it wasn't many! If the odd 77 has escaped into the wild then there is also the possibility that examples from plates 69, 70, 75, 126 and 128 may be found one day as well, but it's not likely. If they were going to be verified they probably would have been by now. As of now none are known to exist although in his book [...] "The line-engraved postage stamps of Great Britain printed by Perkins, Bacon & Co.; a history of their production during the forty years, 1840-1880" [...] Sir Edward Denny Bacon mentions that H L Estrange-Ewen had seen copies of both plate 70 and 77 stamps [...] "evidently from proof sheets". Having said that, he also claimed that [...] "entire sheets of 226, 227 & 228 exist with the surcharge [...] "Cyprus"" [...] but it is likely he was mistaken as those plates, although completed were not registered and there is no record of any stamps being printed from them.|$|E
