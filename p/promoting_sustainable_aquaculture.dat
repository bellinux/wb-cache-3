40|$|The {{aquaculture}} {{sector in}} the Philippines has remarkably grown in the last decade. It is now a prominent sector contributing significantly to the country s overall fisheries production. In 2008, aquaculture posted the highest production growth at 48. 5 % (2. 4 million mt), followed by the municipal fisheries sector with 26. 8 % (1. 3 million mt), and the commercial fisheries sector with 24. 7 % increase (1. 2 million mt). Sustainable management of the sector is a primary concern because the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) recognizes that this tremendous growth in aquaculture production must be balanced with ecological considerations.

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to review a number of recent {{initiatives}} to <b>promote</b> <b>sustainable</b> <b>aquaculture</b> development through improvements to education and training capacity, and innovations in the use of eLearning. Design/methodology/approach - The authors share their experience in these initiatives and demonstrate how e-learning has been developed in specific cases to better serve the needs of the aquaculture sector, while addressing the pedagogical issues of distance learning and finding the best use of new internet-based technologies. Findings - These examples show how to respond to the needs of adult learners who may have a substantially different learner profile to typical campus students and have a more diverse range of needs and background knowledge. Greater focus is needed on defining, enhancing and accrediting knowledge and skills acquired informally and "on the job", so as to develop more effective formal education interventions. Practical implications - Adults engaging with job-related education are not empty vessels requiring to be filled with the correct mix of knowledge and skills by teachers who know all the answers. They are active learners seeking a supportive and enabling structure involving access to appropriate resources, engagement with fellow learners and more expert practitioners, and appropriate challenges and rewards to maximise effort and achievement. Originality/value - The paper shows that there is substantial social benefit in promoting an innovative and <b>sustainable</b> <b>aquaculture</b> industry that contributes positively to food security and human health.

40|$|Interest in mud crab {{aquaculture}} {{is increasing}} throughout the Philippines {{because of its}} demand both in local and export markets. Mud crab culture started as low-density polyculture with fish or shrimp using wild crab juveniles and developed to monoculture in ponds and cages. Recently, an integrated mangrove-crab culture system has been practiced. Mud crab species commonly cultured are Scylla serrata, S. tranquebarica, and S. olivacea. The yearly increase in production from 1996 to 2000 (Table 1) may indicate a corresponding increase in the seed collection activity due to greater demand of seeds for stocking. According to many gatherers in the country, {{there has been a}} declining volume of all size-classes, from juveniles to adult crabs, gathered from the wild over the last decade.

40|$|This work {{focuses on}} the {{selection}} of new areas for shellfish farming {{along the coast of}} the Northern Adriatic Sea (Italy). Shellfish site suitability was assessed by means of a methodology based on Spatial Multi-Criteria Evaluation (SMCE), which provided the framework to combine mathematical models and operational oceanography products. Intermediate level criteria considered in the analysis included optimal growth conditions, environmental interactions, and socio-economic evaluation (e. g. organic carbon deposition; distance to harbour). Results showed that the whole coastal area comprised within 0 and 3 [*]nm is highly suitable for farming of mussel, while the area comprised between 3 and 12 [*]nm is divided between a highly suitable northern part, and a less suitable southern one. Seven different scenarios of development of shellfish aquaculture industry were explored. The introduction of a new species, and the assessment of the exposure to storm events are specific aspects taken into account in development scenarios. Results show that the degree of suitability for shellfish aquaculture in this area would not change dramatically with the introduction of oyster farming. Furthermore, results highlight that: (i) the growth potential in this area is high; (ii) the space with suitability index > 0. 5 increases when prioritizing the optimal growth condition criteria, and (iii) the socio-economic is the most restrictive Intermediate Level Criteria. Results were discussed by deriving general lessons concerning the use of SMCE in aquaculture space allocation, from the specific application in the Northern Adriatic Sea. Challenges and opportunities related to the proposed methodological framework, with particular reference to the use of resources provided by remote sensing and operational oceanography by means of mathematical models, were also discussed. Results can support a science-based identification of allocated zones for aquaculture in order to avoid conflicts, and <b>promote</b> <b>sustainable</b> <b>aquaculture</b> in the Mediterranean Sea, where the space for these activities is becoming increasingly limited...|$|R
40|$|Research PaperThe world {{aquaculture}} {{industry is}} expanding its output {{but at the}} same time it is generating concerns about environmental sustainability. It is often heavily concentrated in coastal areas where there is strong competition for space and water resources and where it has been associated with externalities such as habitat destruction and pollution. Fortunately, awareness of these problems is spreading and key sectors of the aquaculture industry are taking responsibility for their environmental performance. Their response is being driven partly by the realisation that fish and shellfish farmers are often the first to suffer when the environment is degraded, and partly by pressure from NGOs, consumers, and major buyers of aquaculture products. The aquaculture industry's reaction has involved a wide range of technological improvements (particularly in the areas of nutrition, selective breeding, disease control, and intensive production systems) and the drafting of numerous codes of conduct focusing on responsible practices. Some of these voluntary codes are being refined into global aquaculture standards and, backed-up by third party certification, they are starting to deliver improvements, particularly in situations where the alternative of new legislation is unappealing because of cost, poor enforcement or because of concerns about non-tariff trade barriers. One industry body, the Global Aquaculture Alliance, established to <b>promote</b> <b>sustainable</b> <b>aquaculture,</b> has started by focusing on shrimp farming and is addressing food safety concerns, and social and environmental issues through its Best Aquaculture Practices (BAP) programme. It has written standards for hatcheries, farms and processing plants and these are gaining widespread support.

An increase in food security will be dependent upon the development and improvement of sustainable practices. A prioritization exercise was undertaken, focusing on the future knowledge needs to underpin UK <b>sustainable</b> <b>aquaculture</b> (both domestic and imported products) using a ‘task force’ group of 36 ‘practitioners’ and 12 ‘research scientists’ who have an active interest in <b>sustainable</b> <b>aquaculture.</b> A long list of 264 knowledge needs related to <b>sustainable</b> <b>aquaculture</b> was developed {{in conjunction with the}} task force.

Thus far, only {{little is known about the}} consumers' knowledge and perception of different production methods used in aquaculture especially in comparison to each other. Against this background, the present contribution aims to explore perceptions and knowledge of German consumers with regard to <b>sustainable</b> <b>aquaculture,</b> its production systems, related labels, and communication messages. Focus groupswere used to obtain insight into the multitude of consumers' perceptions. One result is that consumers, even though they had little knowledge of aquaculture, often had a limited need for information about aquaculture.

Elimination of unwanted fishes and other predators is a common practice among fish farmers in Nigeria prior to stocking of desirable fish fingerlings. The use of synthetic pesticides to eliminate unwanted fishes and other predators in pond is persistent and could get into the food chain.
