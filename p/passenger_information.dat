5|$|The Pendolino is {{designed}} as a premium facility train. The seats are fitted with audio sockets for radio and music channels; however the radio service was dropped in 2010 due to low usage. All seats have electricity sockets for laptops and mobile phones. All Sm3 trains offer a free onboard Wi-Fi Internet access since 2010. The <b>passenger</b> <b>information</b> monitors over the aisle in the carriages show a clock and the train's current speed in addition to VR's marketing material and station information. They are also used to convey <b>passenger</b> <b>information</b> for the deaf. The train is accessible for wheelchairs, contains pet spaces and seats for allergic passengers.|$|E
5|$|These trains {{originally}} had no visual <b>passenger</b> <b>information</b> systems; station announcements {{had to be}} made by the train operator. An automatic audio announcement system using voice synthesizers was installed on each train by September 1994. The first iteration of the door closing buzzer announcements, which replaced the initial door chimes, was fully introduced by April 1997.|$|E
5|$|At any time, {{there are}} four or five people working at the control center: two monitor the ATC system, one {{monitors}} <b>passenger</b> <b>information,</b> and one is responsible for secondary systems, such as power supply. In case of technical problems, {{there is always a}} team of linemen that can be dispatched to perform repairs. Although the trains are not equipped with drivers, there are stewards at stations and on most trains that help passengers, perform ticket controls and assist in emergency situations.|$|E

5|$|Fay {{damaged the}} roof of the airport's {{terminal}} building, causing the sprinkler system to malfunction and inundate parts of the structure with water; the resultant flooding crippled computer systems crucial to processing <b>passenger</b> <b>information.</b> The airport's radar was also impacted by the storm. In response to the damage, the airport was closed to all flights, though it quickly reopened to emergency diversions and non-commercial flights. Including subsequent damage from Gonzalo, about $2 million was spent on airport repairs, and the storms were later cited as evidence of the need for a newer terminal in a more protected location.|$|E
5|$|SMRT first {{attempted}} {{to install a}} <b>passenger</b> <b>information</b> system SMRTime on trains using LCD displays in 1999; these have since been removed. In November 2006 the doors of three cars (carriage number 3006, 1006 and 2006) were installed with a dynamic, in-train system displaying station information for testing; these are similar to ones used by Hong Kong's MTR. An initial prototype of STARIS based upon the existing Automatic Transit Info System was developed in-house; this was removed {{before the end of}} the year without entering service.|$|E
5|$|The tunnel reopened {{to service}} on September 24, 2007, with tunnel routes {{modified}} to group common destinations together. Stations were given new entrance signs, lighting fixtures, electronic <b>passenger</b> <b>information</b> signs, and restored paint. The peak bus-only restrictions on 3rd Avenue remained in {{place after the}} reopening, along with the skip-stop service that Metro implemented on the street. The tunnel was temporarily closed for nine days in December after a computer glitch disrupted the tunnel's new emergency-control system, which was repaired and replaced.|$|E

5|$|A <b>Passenger</b> <b>Information</b> Display System (PIDS) was {{installed}} in all Metrorail stations in 2000. Displays are located on all track platforms and at the mezzanine entrances of stations, and provide real-time information on next train arrivals, delayed trains, emergency announcements, and related information. WMATA also provides current train and related information to customers with conventional web browsers, as well as users of smartphones and other mobile devices. In 2010 Metro began sharing its PIDS data with outside software developers, for use in creating additional real-time applications for mobile devices. Free apps are {{available to the public}} on major mobile device software platforms (iOS, Android, Windows Phone, Palm). WMATA also began providing real-time train information by phone in 2010.|$|E
5|$|No {{rolling stock}} has been {{completely}} scrapped since service began, with the oldest C151 trains operating since the inauguration of the MRT System in 1987. Older trains have been renewed over the years under refurbishment schemes to enhance their lifespan {{as well as to}} adhere to updated safety and usability codes. Refurbished and new trains sport sleeker designs, improved <b>passenger</b> <b>information</b> systems, more grab poles, wider seats, more space near the doors, spaces for wheelchairs and CCTV cameras. As a trial run, luggage racks were installed on the C751B trains to serve travellers on the Changi Airport branch line. The scheme was withdrawn in June 2002 and the luggage racks removed.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} repairs are the {{grinding}} of the wheels; more complicated repairs {{are made by}} replacing entire components that are sent to the manufacturer. By having components in reserve, trains can have shorter maintenance times. The center also has the system's work trains, including a diesel locomotive that can fetch broken trains. At any time, there are four people working at the control center. Two monitor the ATC system, one monitors <b>passenger</b> <b>information,</b> while the last is responsible for secondary systems, such as power supply.

The article explains why road-network traffic flows should be reconsidered {{for the purposes of}} delimiting functional urban areas (FUAs) and demonstrates that delimitation of functional regions based on passenger-car traffic flows is an efficient way corresponding to former approaches to the delimitation of functional urban regions in Slovakia.

40|$|In {{optimizing}} {{the national}} railway timetable for the Belgian infrastructure company Infrabel, {{we use the}} quality criterium of minimizing expected total passenger travel time. Optimizing the timing of all trains fairly over all passengers requires <b>passenger</b> flow <b>information.</b> Focus is usually on determining the train service offer side, being the train timing, without considering the demand side data, being the <b>passenger</b> flow <b>information.</b> In this paper, we focus on passenger flow derivation. We start from train ticket sales data and use Dijkstra’s modified shortest path algorithm on the Belgian passenger train graph to determine a route per passenger origin destination station pair. We sum route passenger flows over all these routes. We also show how, in optimization of a timetable, timing and flows {{should be treated as}} interdependent. This means that we can use a process of iteration over these two phases, which we then call reflowing and retiming. The infrastructure company did not have this <b>passenger</b> flow <b>information</b> available for the current schedule, but they need it to optimize many decisions. We determined these passenger flows for the current timetable. We also give some recommendations regarding the improvement of passenger flow related data recording procedures, which would significantly improve passenger service. status: publishe...|$|R

5|$|On {{the right}} of the {{entrance}} is the subway that links all the platforms, reached either by steps or lift; it houses the main public toilets, automated teller machines (ATM) and several catering outlets (there is catering on all platform islands except 13–15). A <b>passenger</b> <b>information</b> office and lounge are above the subway, the British Transport Police office and cycle racks are beyond, and at the western end is Platform 4, used by only a few trains. Alongside this is Platform 2, another bay platform but not signalled for passenger trains and used only for stabling empty trains, as is the former Motorail unloading bay alongside. At the far end of this track is the old Fish Dock, occasionally used for stabling engineers' on-track equipment. Beyond the end of the platform the tracks swing to the right (the west) and pass out of sight beneath Bath Road Bridge, a girder bridge that carries the A4 out of the city.|$|E

It was also announced that she had good accommodation for <b>passengers.</b> <b>Information</b> as to cargo could be obtained from her owners, on Tower Hill, or from the captain on board, between the hours of ten and twelve.
