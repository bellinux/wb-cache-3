40|$|We {{provide a}} {{critical}} {{review of the literature}} on early <b>warning</b> <b>indicators</b> of economics crises and propose methods to overcome several pitfalls of the previous contributions. We use a quarterly panel of 40 EU and OECD countries for the period 1970 – 2010. As the response variable, we construct a continuous index of crisis incidence capturing the real costs for the economy. As the potential <b>warning</b> <b>indicators,</b> we evaluate a wide range of variables, selected according to the previous literature and our own considerations. For each potential indicator we determine the optimal lead employing panel vector autoregression, then we select useful indicators employing Bayesian model averaging. We re-estimate the resulting specification by system GMM to account for potential endogeneity of some indicators. Subsequently, to allow for country heterogeneity, we evaluate the random coefficients estimator and illustrate the stability among endogenous clusters. Our results suggest that global variables rank among the most useful early <b>warning</b> <b>indicators.</b> In addition, housing prices emerge consistently as an important domestic source of risk.

A parallel circuit supplies the [...] "charge" [...] <b>warning</b> <b>indicator</b> and is earthed via the regulator (which is why the indicator is on when the ignition is on but the engine is not running). Once the engine is running and the alternator is generating power, a diode feeds the field current from the alternator main output equalizing the voltage across the <b>warning</b> <b>indicator</b> which goes off. The wire supplying the field current {{is often referred to}} as the [...] "exciter" [...] wire. The drawback of this arrangement is that if the warning lamp burns out or the [...] "exciter" [...] wire is disconnected, no current reaches the {{field windings}} and the alternator will not generate power. Some <b>warning</b> <b>indicator</b> circuits are equipped with a resistor in parallel with the lamp that permit excitation current to flow if the warning lamp burns out.

The incident investigated was a hydraulic oil leak from the Eirik Raude drilling rig during exploration drilling in the Barents Sea in April 2005. The incident is analyzed using influence diagrams, from which seven general barriers against hydraulic leaks have been identified. For each barrier both checkpoints and indicators have been developed, which provide information {{about the status of}} the barriers and early warning of potential spills. The work described in this paper has shown {{that it is possible to}} develop early <b>warning</b> <b>indicators</b> based on incident investigation.

40|$|This paper {{draws on}} COIC's {{experience}} with deposit-taking institutions during the 1980 s and 1990 s and presents {{a number of}} early <b>warning</b> <b>indicators</b> of financial distress. Early <b>warning</b> <b>indicators</b> do not eliminate bank failures. However, they should lead to early intervention and consequently help reduce losses to deposit insurance funds or governments. To be effective, early <b>warning</b> <b>indicators</b> {{should be used in}} conjunction with professional judgement. Judgement must be exercised in choosing the relevant indicators and in interpreting the data derived from the early warning measures. The effectiveness of an early <b>warning</b> <b>indicator</b> also depends {{on the quality of the}} data. For example, many deposit-taking institutions that failed in Canada had inadequate information systems that generated unreliable data. The inaccurate data led management (and regulators) to believe the institution was healthy, resulted in poor decision making, delayed intervention by regulatory agencies, and eventually led to failure. Also, traditional cost valuation methods for preparing accounting information may not be appropriate for early warning data. For example, a "marked-to-market" valuation of assets and liabilities of financial institutions can lead to sounder decision making and is more appropriate for assets such as marketable securities and derivativei products. Furthermore, for an early <b>warning</b> <b>indicator</b> to be effective, indicators need to be supplemented by information that is not of a financial nature. On-site examinations provide crucial first-hand information onmanagement's strategy and competence, the adequacy of internal controls and the accuracy of financial reporting. Moreover, macro- and micro-economic data, market trend indicators (i. e., real estate values, stock market indices) and industry-specific data can explain how external forces have affected the institution in the past and how they can affect it in the future. Finally, early warning systems must cover all the key functions of a bank's operations and potential areas of risk, namely (among many others) internal audit, cash management and liquidity, securities operations, loan portfolio, other assets, deposit liabilities, capital adequacy, profit and loss and market risks, This paper provides early <b>warning</b> signs and <b>indicators</b> for the above dimensions. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Exploration and {{production}} {{of oil and gas}} in certain sensitive areas such as the Barents Sea and Lofoten, is controversial and further expansion depends on the ability to avoid harmful spills. One way of improving the ability to avoid such spills is to use early <b>warning</b> <b>indicators.</b> The objective of the work presented in this paper is to describe and compare strengths and weaknesses of different approaches for the development of early <b>warning</b> <b>indicators.</b> The approaches that have been compared are: safety performance-based methods; risk-based methods; incident-based methods; and resilience-based methods. There are pros and cons with all methods. All methods are very favorable with respect to some characteristics {{and at the same time}} very unfavorable to some other characteristics. They are also different in terms of scope and depth of analysis. This suggests that we should be flexible with respect to the choice of methods, and preferably use more than one method. Thus, the main conclusion is that it is favorable to have the possibility to use several different methods for the establishment of early <b>warning</b> <b>indicators...</b>|$|R

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} {{and provides}} empirical tests of early <b>warning</b> <b>indicators</b> of banking and currency crises in emerging economies. The {{aim is to}} identify key empirical regularities {{in the run-up to}} banking and currency crises that would enable officials and private market participants to recognize vulnerability to financial crises at an earlier stage. This, in turn, should make it easier to motivate the corrective policy actions that would prevent such crises from actually taking place. Interest in identifying early <b>warning</b> <b>indicators</b> of financial crises has soared of late, stoked primarily by two factors. First, there is increasing recognition that banking and currency crises can be extremely costly to the countries in which they originate; in addition, these crises often spillover via a variety of international channels to increase the vulnerability of other countries to financial crisis. The second reason for the increased interest in early <b>warning</b> <b>indicators</b> of financial crises is that there is accumulating evidence that two of the most closely watched “market indicators” of default and currency risks [...] namely, interest rate spreads and changes in credit ratings [...] frequently do not provide much advance warning of currency and banking crises. ...|$|R
40|$|The article aims at {{introducing}} new {{methodology for}} recognizing suitable indicators {{to monitor the}} potential risk of extensive pressure on the exchange rate (early <b>warning</b> <b>indicators)</b> and for identifying vulnerabilities in an economy to this pressure reflected by simultaneous negative development of the observed early <b>warning</b> <b>indicators.</b> The construction of the empirical model {{is based on the}} combination of the signal approach and the binary model of behaviour. This model focuses on both strong and increased pressure on exchange rate and the parameters are adjusted to the Czech environment. The results indicate that the most significant early <b>warning</b> <b>indicator</b> for the Czech economy is the gap between current account deficit and foreign direct investment and further M 2 to foreign exchange ratio, GDP growth and export growth. In total the model identified correctly 72 per cent periods of increased vulnerability of the Czech economy to excessive devaluation pressure. At the same time it identified correctly 78 per cent of tranquil periods.

40|$|The {{existence}} of persistent midlatitude atmospheric flow regimes with time-scales larger than 5 - 10 days and indications of preferred transitions between them motivates to develop early <b>warning</b> <b>indicators</b> for such regime transitions. In this paper, {{we use a}} hemispheric barotropic model together with estimates of transfer operators on a reduced phase space to develop an early <b>warning</b> <b>indicator</b> of the zonal to blocked flow transition in this model. It is shown that, the spectrum of the transfer operators {{can be used to}} study the slow dynamics of the flow as well as the non-Markovian character of the reduction. The slowest motions are thereby found to have time scales of three to six weeks and to be associated with meta-stable regimes (and their transitions) which can be detected as almost-invariant sets of the transfer operator. From the energy budget of the model, we are able to explain the meta-stability of the regimes and the {{existence of}} preferred transition paths. Even though the model is highly simplified, the skill of the early <b>warning</b> <b>indicator</b> is promising, suggesting that the transfer operator approach can be used in parallel to an operational deterministic model for stochastic prediction or to assess forecast uncertainty...|$|R
