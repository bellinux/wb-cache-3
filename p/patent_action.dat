40|$|This article {{posits that}} the JPML and Federal Circuit, despite their range of differences, {{can benefit from}} one another and remedy each other’s complex {{institutional}} challenges. The Federal Circuit can eliminate the unfairness in multidistrict litigation practice and can guide multidistrict litigation by providing uniform federal precedent. Multidistrict litigation, which is as procedurally complex as it is substantively broad, can enable the Federal Circuit to speak on non-patent law and can position the circuit to see more clearly how patents affect the overall economy. Through these mutual benefits, these institutions can promote justice and cost-effectiveness for each litigant in every <b>patent</b> <b>action</b> and every MDL proceeding. To that end, this article proposes that Congress vest in the Federal Circuit exclusive appellate jurisdiction over the JPML and MDL courts. ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{argues that}} the {{existing}} laws of competition and human rights can be combined to limit the rights of owners of intellectual property (IP). The need for this thesis arises from concerns {{about the impact of}} enforcement of IP rights, say on patients needing essential medicines or students seeking to obtain important material from the internet. Some steps have been taken to address these concerns, with the World Trade Organization Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health and the One Lap Top Per Child project. Yet the owner of a national IP right can still object to a valuable project if it comes within the scope of that IP right, say the supply of providers of emergency services with the only communications technology which will work in extreme conditions in air ambulances. IP law should not be viewed in legal isolation, however, and concerns about the impact of enforcement of IP can also be framed in terms of human rights and competition. This work argues, with a focus on the jurisdictions of the United Kingdom (UK) and on patents, that courts considering patent actions can and must, without the need for any legislative or policy change, combine the UK Human Rights Act 1998 (HRA), the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), the UK Patents Act 1977 (PA) and article 82 EC Treaty such that in some limited cases there will be no finding of patent infringement. A Human Rights Emphasis is proposed as a means of evaluating what is meant in a particular case by compatible or incompatible with Convention rights in sections 3 and 6 HRA, given that the potentially conflicting rights to property, life and expression could be engaged in a <b>patent</b> <b>action.</b> The Human Rights Emphasis is then applied to the results of a creative yet legitimate approach to interpretation of the infringement provisions of the PA, to determine whether there should be a finding of infringement. It is also argued, combining the Human Rights Emphasis and a broad approach to abuse of a dominant position and its relationship with IP, that it can be a prohibited abuse of a dominant position to raise an infringement action when the technology the subject of the patent is a market in itself. Finally, the arguments of this work are considered to be consistent with the existing obligations of the UK, and other countries, under the ECHR and the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, and as such of potential application outside the UK.

40|$|Forum selling” is {{jurisdictional}} competition {{intended to}} attract litigants. While consensual forum selling may be beneficial, non-consensual forum selling is harmful because it encourages jurisdictions {{to adopt an}} inefficient pro-plaintiff bias. In the last 20 years, the Eastern District of Texas has adopted an aggressive and remarkably successful policy of non-consensual forum selling in <b>patent</b> infringement <b>actions.</b> In 2016, 44 % of all <b>patent</b> infringement <b>actions</b> were filed in the Eastern District of Texas, and 93 % of them were filed by patent assertion entities or “patent trolls. ” In December 2016, the Supreme Court granted certiorari in TC Heartland v. Kraft, to consider the definition of corporate residence {{for the purpose of}} patent venue. If the Court adopts the narrow definition suggested by TC Heartland, it would effectively prevent the Eastern District of Texas from engaging in non-consensual forum selling in <b>patent</b> infringement <b>actions.</b> However, it could also unduly restrict patent venue. This Article argues that the Court could stop non-consensual forum selling in <b>patent</b> infringement <b>actions</b> by requiring district courts to decide motions to transfer venue before deciding any other motions or entering any substantive orders. This would prevent non-consensual forum selling by making it impossible for a district to offer bias as a salient incentive to marginal plaintiffs, and it would make litigation more efficient by ensuring that actions reach the appropriate district as quickly as possible...|$|R

40|$|In 1991, the Federal Circuit {{held that}} a {{judgment}} on the merits in a <b>patent</b> infringement <b>action</b> bars future claims based on products that are “essentially the same” as the product at issue in the former suit. This rule governed claim preclusion in <b>patent</b> <b>actions</b> until at least 2009. Then, in 2012, the Federal Circuit upended the apple cart with Aspex Eyewear, Inc. v. Marchon Eyewear, Inc., 672 F. 3 d 1335 (Fed. Cir. 2012), holding that a judgment in an infringement suit never bars future claims against products {{that could not have}} been accused in the former litigation, essentially the same or not. The court reaffirmed this rule in 2014 in Brain Life, LLC v. Elekta Inc., 746 F. 3 d 1045 (Fed. Cir. 2014). The Federal Circuit introduced this change in the law for a good reason: the “essentially the same” rule had the unfortunate effect of granting an adjudged infringer a license to continue infringing, secure in the knowledge that claim preclusion would bar a second suit. Unfortunately, Aspex and Brain Life are squarely in conflict with earlier Federal Circuit precedent. Because one three-judge panel cannot overrule another, the “essentially the same” test remains the law. The en banc Federal Circuit should address this conflict, and resolve it in favor of Aspex and Brain Life...|$|R
