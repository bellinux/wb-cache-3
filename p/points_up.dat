25|$|The two {{arguments}} Sam and Sally in tree (a) {{are dependent}} on the predicate likes, whereby these arguments are also syntactically dependent on likes. What {{this means is that}} the semantic and syntactic dependencies overlap and point in the same direction (down the tree). Attributive adjectives, however, are predicates that take their head noun as their argument, hence big is a predicate in tree (b) that takes bones as its one argument; the semantic dependency <b>points</b> <b>up</b> the tree and therefore runs counter to the syntactic dependency. A similar situation obtains in (c), where the preposition predicate on takes the two arguments the picture and the wall; one of these semantic dependencies <b>points</b> <b>up</b> the syntactic hierarchy, whereas the other points down it. Finally, the predicate to help in (d) takes the one argument Jim but is not directly connected to Jim in the syntactic hierarchy, which means that that semantic dependency is entirely independent of the syntactic dependencies.|$|E
25|$|Round 3 is a toss-up visual round. The monitor {{displays}} {{an image}} and the host provides a question accompanying the image. Teams receive 20 points for each correct answer and lose 20 for each incorrect answer (10 until April 19, 2014 in Washington, Baltimore, and starting with the 2014 season in Charlottesville; other cities' visual rounds are still 10 <b>points</b> <b>up</b> or down). Eight questions are used. The fourth question is always a math question.|$|E

25|$|In 1994, Republican Congressional {{candidates}} ran on {{a platform}} of major reforms of government with measures such as a balanced budget amendment and welfare reform. These measures and others formed the famous Contract with America, which represented the first effort to have a party platform in an off-year election. The Contract promised to bring all <b>points</b> <b>up</b> for a vote {{for the first time in}} history. The Republicans passed some of their proposals, but failed on others such as term limits.|$|E
25|$|Preliminary Routing Indicators (PRIs) are {{installed}} on the approach to certain junctions. When the junction signal is displaying a 'proceed' aspect, the PRI will display an arrow. The arrow <b>points</b> <b>up</b> when the highest speed route is set. When a diverging route is set, the arrow points in the appropriate direction (mimicking the junction indicator on the junction signal). This advance indication gives the driver an opportunity to stop before the junction points, if wrongly routed. At the present time, PRIs are few in number, but {{they are likely to}} become more common.|$|E
25|$|In 1994, Earnhardt {{achieved}} a feat {{that he himself}} had believed to be impossible—he scored his seventh Winston Cup championship, tying Richard Petty. He was very consistent, scoring four wins, and after Ernie Irvan was sidelined due to a near-deadly crash at Michigan (the two were neck-and-neck {{at the top of}} the <b>points</b> <b>up</b> until the crash), won the title by over 400 points over Mark Martin. Earnhardt sealed the deal at Rockingham by winning the race over Rick Mast. It was his final NASCAR championship and his final season for the GM Goodwrench Chevrolet Lumina.|$|E

25|$|After the {{disappointment}} of losing to North Melbourne in the 1977 Preliminary Final, the Hawks were back {{to play in}} the 1978 Grand Final, again against North Melbourne. It was the third time in four seasons that these two sides were to meet in a grand final. North Melbourne were competing in their fifth successive grand final and were the reigning premiers. At half-time North Melbourne led by four points but Hawthorn finished victors by three goals thanks largely to a strong third quarter which saw them kick 7.6. The turning point occurred when two North players spoiled each other in the goalsquare at the 6-minute mark, when a mark and a goal could have put them 17 <b>points</b> <b>up.</b> The Hawks went on to dominate play after this incident and never looked back.|$|E
25|$|Al-Bashir has {{achieved}} {{economic growth in}} Sudan. This was pushed further by the drilling and extraction of oil. However, economic growth has not been shared by all. Headline inflation in 2012 approached the threshold of chronic inflation (period average 36%), about 11 percentage <b>points</b> <b>up</b> from the budget projection of 2012 reflecting the combined effects of inflationary financing, the depreciation of the exchange rate, and the continued removal of subsidies, as well as high food and energy prices. This economic downturn prompted cost of living riots that erupted into Arab Spring-style anti-government demonstrations; also it aroused the discontent of the Sudanese Worker's Trade Union Federation (SWTUF), which threatened to hold nationwide strikes in support of higher wages. The continued deterioration {{in the value of}} the Sudanese pound (SDG) poses grave downside risks to already soaring inflation. This, coupled with the economic slowdown, presents serious challenges to the implementation of the approved Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (I-PRSP).|$|E
25|$|Initially, retail Xbox 360 games {{offered up}} to 1,000G {{spread over a}} {{variable}} number of Achievements, while each Xbox Live Arcade title contained 12 Achievements totaling 200G. On February 1, 2007, Microsoft announced on their Gamerscore Blog some new policies that developers must follow related to Gamerscore and Achievements in future releases. All regular disc-based games must have 1,000 Gamerscore points in the base game; the title can ship with fewer than 1,000 points, but anything added later must be free. Game developers also now {{have the option of}} adding up to 250 points via downloadable content every quarter after the first year of release (for a total of 1,750 points). Xbox Live Arcade titles also allow players to obtain Gamerscore, initially up to 200 Gamerscore with additional <b>points</b> <b>up</b> to 50 Gamerscore via downloadable content (for a total of 250 points), but some XBLA games now contain up to 400 Gamerscore without DLC.|$|E

500|$|McCartney's bass, {{placed in}} front of the mix, is an ingenious {{counterpoint}} that takes him all over the fretboard ... At the chorus, for example, while Lennon and McCartney harmonize in fourths on a melody with a slightly Middle Eastern tinge, McCartney first <b>points</b> <b>up</b> the song's droning character by hammering on a high G (approached with a quick slide from the F natural just below it), playing it steadily on the beat for twenty successive beats. [...] The next time the chorus comes around, though, he plays something entirely different, a slightly syncopated descending three-note pattern that almost seems to evoke the falling rain.|$|E
500|$|Mike Moody of AOLTV {{felt that}} the season finale alternated between [...] "exciting and disappointing", with the final 15 minutes being {{particularly}} good due to the celebration of [...] "what we love most about Clark Kent/Superman – his power to delight and inspire us". However, Moody was critical that the substantial scenes in the episode were surrounded by [...] "countless minutes of poorly paced padding, filler, and manufactured conflict", and that [...] "the bulk of this two-hour finale was just painful to watch". Phil Dyess-Nugent of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a [...] "C+" [...] and called it [...] "a sodden mess that mostly <b>points</b> <b>up</b> how off-balance the show became". He heavily criticized the show for focusing {{so much of the}} romance between Clark and Lois, and wrote that it detracted from the [...] "better" [...] plot concerning Darkseid and his minions.|$|E

500|$|The {{objects of}} the inner Solar System are {{composed}} mostly of rock, the collective name for compounds with high melting points, such as silicates, iron or nickel, that remained solid under almost all conditions in the protoplanetary nebula. Jupiter and Saturn are composed mainly of gases, the astronomical term for materials with extremely low melting points and high vapour pressure, such as hydrogen, helium, and neon, which were always in the gaseous phase in the nebula. Ices, like water, methane, ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, and carbon dioxide, have melting <b>points</b> <b>up</b> to a few hundred kelvins. They can be found as ices, liquids, or gases in various places in the Solar System, whereas in the nebula they were either in the solid or gaseous phase. Icy substances comprise {{the majority of the}} satellites of the giant planets, as well as most of Uranus and Neptune (the so-called [...] "ice giants") and the numerous small objects that lie beyond Neptune's orbit. Together, gases and ices are referred to as volatiles.|$|E
500|$|Penn State's {{defense had}} excelled {{in their first}} two games, but regressed {{significantly}} against Central Florida, particularly with poor tackling, which some attributed to their practice strategy of [...] "thud" [...] tackling, in which one does not actually take a player to the ground, instead making a [...] "thud" [...] to stop a player. Several media outlets speculated that the Lions used this due to their lack of scholarship players {{in the wake of}} sanctions imposed due to the Penn State child sex abuse scandal. Defensive coordinator John Butler renounced that assertion, commenting he employed [...] "thud" [...] when he coached at South Carolina. Penn State's linebackers were also criticized; Glenn Carson and Nyeem Wartman received criticism for not being as strong as the 2012 team's Michael Mauti and Gerald Hodges. In addition, 2012 Big Ten Freshman of the Year defensive end Deion Barnes [...] "barely wreaked any havoc", and DaQuan Jones, whose strong play had previously compensated for Barnes' weak play, was held to just five tackles. The offense, however, was considered a [...] "bright spot"; they gained 455 total yards, though receiver Allen Robinson commented that a fast start would have helped them gain more early momentum: [...] "We are in the Big Ten playing against some great offenses {{and people are going to}} put <b>points</b> <b>up</b> early, so we need to get going early and start off fast." [...] Freshman quarterback Christian Hackenberg earned Big Ten Freshman of the Week accolades for the second time in the first three weeks of the season.|$|E
500|$|The {{paintings}} show Obrenović {{standing before}} the Serb leaders and clan elders at Takovo and inciting them to revolt. According to legend, he appeared before the crowd and proclaimed: [...] "Here I am, and here you are. War to the Turks!". Obrenović is depicted standing atop a large stone, wearing a turban and a red, Oriental-style costume covered in golden embroidery, surrounded by a semi-circle of followers. A sword hangs from his waist, and two pistols protrude from his belt. His right arm <b>points</b> <b>up</b> at the sky, with the thumb, middle and index finger extended. With his left hand outstretched, Obrenović waves a large revolutionary flag depicting a red cross centered against a white background. The flag is a variant of that used by the Petrović-Njegoš dynasty, which ruled Montenegro {{at the time of}} the uprising, and is reminiscent of the Christian flag flown at the Battle of Kosovo, which according to popular belief, marked the beginning of the Ottoman occupation of the Balkans. The flag provokes an enthusiastic response from the crowd, members of which raise their swords in salute. Others gesture with their muskets. To the far left, a woman places her child on top of a headstone, and both raise their hands in salute. Beside Obrenović is a priest who gives him his blessing. The priest is bearded, and wears a typical, long black robe and Eastern Orthodox religious headdress. Behind the priest is a large group of Obrenović's followers, most with their swords sheathed and hands emulating Obrenović's three-fingered gesture. To Obrenović's right, a man wearing Turkish clothes (red fez, dolman and shalvar pants) places his hand on the flagpole the rebel leader is holding. It is unclear if the man wishes to take the flag away from Obrenović or help bear it. Behind him, a large group of mustachioed men wearing similar clothes raise their arms and salute Obrenović.|$|E
