50|$|The {{activities}} of Naktuinbouw Laboratories are performed {{on behalf of}} the Inspections department or for commercial propagators and growers. Naktuinbouw Laboratories is made up of the Health Test laboratory, the Seed Analysis laboratory, the Research & Development and Diagnoster departments and the Test Centre in Horst. Test methods are available for approximately 150 pests and diseases. Examples include seed analysis, health tests (viruses, fungi, bacteria and viroids), nematode detection tests, making the propagating material of woody crops and strawberries, in particular, virus-free and maintaining a collection of <b>pre-basic</b> <b>material,</b> namely of ornamental trees and fruit crops. Naktuinbouw Laboratories specialise in identifying varieties and pathogens, for example by using DNA techniques such as fingerprinting.|$|E

At this moment all basic seed material is imported into Republic of Serbia and Republic of Srpska, {{despite the fact that}} the method of in vitro tissue culture production of virus-free seed potato has been developed in both countries and there is a continuous demand for pre-basic and basic seed potato. Current total production is significantly lower than actual requirements. In the 80 s and 90 s of the previous century two modern facilities for production of virus-free seed potato and certified seed were built in Sokolac (Republic of Srpska) and Guča (Republic of Serbia). Although facilities were well-equipped, seed potato production was permanently ceased in 2000. The presence of high infection pressure dominated by potato virus Y is shown in the Republic of Serbia and the Republic of Srpska. This paper gives an overview of <b>pre-basic</b> seed potato <b>material</b> production in both countries over the last two decades...|$|R
