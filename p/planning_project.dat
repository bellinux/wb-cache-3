25|$|Partly in {{response}} to the collapse of the Houston Organizing Project, in 1983 the AFL-CIO executive council began an extensive strategic <b>planning</b> <b>project.</b> A plan was adopted two years later which, among other things, endorsed higher levels of organizing.|$|E

This square, {{formerly}} {{called the}} Park, {{was installed in}} the 18th century in the first real town <b>planning</b> <b>project.</b> It has remained a promenade and a venue for various events. In 1956 the square changed its name again. The City Council decided {{to call it the}} Place New York, in memory of the journey by Giovanni da Verrazano in the service of François I who, in 1524, named the site of the present New York: New Angoulême.|$|E
25|$|On September 10, 1976, Tropical Storm Kathleen {{destroyed}} {{parts of}} SD's Desert Line, {{at the time}} a part of the Southern Pacific (SP) system. The hurricane caused $1.3 million worth of damage, primarily {{in the eastern part of}} the state. Through freight service to Arizona was suspended and San Diego became an isolated portion of the SP system. SP petitioned for abandonment of the SD on August 9, 1977, of all tracks west of Plaster City, while the MTDB guideway <b>planning</b> <b>project</b> was ongoing. Due to the apparently immediate availability of a right-of-way in the South Bay Corridor, the transit planning refocused on the SD (SP) Tijuana line, making it the effective ‘minimum operable segment’.|$|E

25|$|The {{trust is}} {{supported}} through memberships fees, private donations, and public conservation funding. Some of its funding comes from California Proposition 70. It generated $776 million in funding for parks, wildlife, and coast conservation. The trust contributed $300,000 to help pass the proposition, {{one of the}} largest donations to the effort. Many of the individuals and groups active in the Big Sur land use <b>planning</b> <b>project</b> lent their support to the campaign in support of Proposition 70. County Supervisor Karin Strasser Kauffman, a strong supporter of conservation efforts, supported the effort and the trust. The trust distributed petitions across the state. The initiative passed by a wide margin of 65 percent in June 1988. Proposition 70 funds are distributed to and allocated by county governments.|$|E
25|$|In October 2010, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts {{was awarded}} a $32.5 million grant from the federal {{government}} to begin planning for this expansion. After deliberations, a $43 million contract (including $10.5 million in state funds) was awarded in August 2012. The <b>planning</b> <b>project</b> will advance the new station area, including a possible passenger mezzanine over the platforms, to the 30% design level. Other elements include a redesign of the South Station interlocking, new commuter rail layover facilities, and the restoration of public access to the adjacent section of Dorchester Avenue and the Fort Point Channel, filling in a missing half-mile segment of the Boston Harborwalk. The station expansion is intended to allow for increases in commuter rail service on the Fairmount Line and Framingham/Worcester Line, addition of South Coast Rail service, and increased Amtrak frequencies.|$|E
