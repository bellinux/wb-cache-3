5|$|A <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> early bombsights {{was that}} they could only correct {{for the effects of}} the wind in a simple way and {{required}} the bomber to fly directly up- or down-wind from the target, to minimise the complexity of the required calculations. This made it difficult to attack moving targets and allowed anti-aircraft artillery to sight their weapons along the wind line.|$|E
5|$|According to critics, the {{inherent}} <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> {{this approach is}} that it relied heavily upon an assumption that Michelangelo only painted buon fresco, that he was always satisfied with the result {{at the end of the}} day, and that in four and a half years spent on the ceiling, he stuck exclusively to one approach, and never made small alterations or added details. Arguimbau, on his website, quotes Colalucci, the head of the team, as contradicting himself on this matter.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is {{introduce}} several types of Levitin-Polyak well-posedness for bilevel vector equilibrium and optimization <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> equilibrium constraints. Base on criterion and characterizations for these types of Levitin-Polyak well-posedness we argue on diameters and Kuratowski’s, Hausdorff’s, or Istrǎtescus measures of noncompactness of approximate solution sets under suitable conditions, and we prove the Levitin-Polyak well-posedness for bilevel vector equilibrium and optimization <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> equilibrium constraints. Obtain a gap function for bilevel vector equilibrium <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> equilibrium constraints using the nonlinear scalarization function and consider relations between these types of LP well-posedness for bilevel vector optimization <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> equilibrium constraints and these types of Levitin-Polyak well-posedness for bilevel vector equilibrium <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> equilibrium constraints under suitable conditions; we prove the Levitin-Polyak well-posedness for bilevel equilibrium and optimization <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> equilibrium constraints...|$|R

40|$|In this study, teachers’ {{professional}} {{problems was}} investigated and the significance level {{of them was}} measured with the paired comparison method. The study {{was carried out in}} survey model. The study group consisted of 484 teachers working in public schools which are accredited by Ministry of National Education (MEB) in Turkey. “The Teacher Professional Problems Survey” developed by the researchers was used as a data collection tool. In data analysis, the scaling method with the third conditional equation of Thurstone’s law of comparative judgement was used. According to the results of study, the teachers’ professional problems include teacher training and the quality of teacher, employee rights and financial problems, decrease of professional reputation, the <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> MEB policies, the <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> union activities, workload, the <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> administration in school, physical conditions and the lack of infrastructure, the <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> parents, the <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> students. According to teachers, the most significant problem is MEB educational policies. This is followed by decrease of professional reputation, physical conditions and the lack of infrastructure, the <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> students, employee rights and financial <b>problems,</b> the <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> administration in school, teacher training and the quality of teacher, the <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> parents, workload, and the <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> union activities. When teachers’ professional problems were analyzed seniority variable, there was little difference in scale values. While the teachers with 0 - 10 years experience consider decrease of professional reputation as the most important <b>problem,</b> the teachers <b>with</b> 11 - 45 years experience put the <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> MEB policies at the first place...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, index coding {{problems}} {{in which the}} number (m) of receivers is larger than that (n) of data are considered. Unlike {{the case that the}} two numbers are same (n = m), index coding <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> n ≤ m are more general and hard to handle. To circumvent this difficulty, <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> n < m are approached via corresponding <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> n = m. It is shown that in certain cases, the symmetric capacity and code construction for index coding <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> n < m can be obtained from the existing symmetric capacity result and codes for index coding <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> n = m. Such cases include cases with n < m ≤ 5. I...|$|R
