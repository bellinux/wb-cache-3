The PS10 Solar <b>Power</b> Plant and PS20 solar <b>power</b> plant are examples of this technology.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, Japan's oldest {{hydroelectric}} <b>power</b> {{plant is}} located in the Shinano River system.

Examples include the strengthening of electrical pylons and <b>power</b> poles, and increasing the <b>power</b> supply. This was done to enable the utility to restore <b>power</b> more rapidly {{in the case of a}} massive ice striking Quebec again.

5|$|<b>Power</b> {{supply in}} Romblon is {{generated}} by the National <b>Power</b> Corporation (NPC) and serviced by two electric cooperatives. Tablas Island Electric Cooperatives (TIELCO) serves the <b>power</b> needs of Tablas Island including San Jose.

Romblon Electric Cooperative (ROMELCO) supplies the capital town of Romblon through a 1.720 MW diesel <b>power</b> plant and a 1.30 MW <b>power</b> barge. It also serves Sibuyan Island using a 3.006 MW diesel <b>power</b> plant in San Fernando. ROMELCO has 5,288 house connections in Romblon and 5,150 house connections in the three municipalities located in Sibuyan Island or a total of 10,438 house connections in their franchise area. Additionally, ROMELCO installed in 2010 a mini hydro <b>power</b> plant in Cantigas, San Fernando, producing 900kW of <b>power.</b> Meanwhile, Banton, Concepcion and Corcuera are attended to by the National <b>Power</b> Corporation (NPC) thru their municipal governments.|$|E
5|$|<b>Power</b> workers {{immediately}} began repairing the <b>power</b> failures by clearing tree branches and replacing fuses and circuit breakers.

By two days after the storm, Pennsylvania <b>Power</b> and Light restored <b>power</b> to about 80% of its impacted customers, with about 93% restored by two nights after the storm. By five days after Isabel, most <b>power</b> outages in southeastern Pennsylvania were repaired, with all outages restored by a week after the hurricane. Allegheny <b>Power</b> restored <b>power</b> to about 20% of its customers by two days after the storm. Most <b>power</b> outages for the company were restored by five days after the hurricane, with all <b>power</b> completely restored by a week after Isabel.|$|E

5|$|Some {{of those}} who have {{attempted}} to find an escape from the impulse to <b>power</b> have resorted to forms of quietism or pacifism. One major proponent of such approaches was the philosopher Laozi. From Russell's perspective, such views are incoherent, since they only deny themselves coercive <b>power,</b> but retain an interest in persuading others to their cause; and persuasion is a form of <b>power,</b> for Russell. Moreover, he argues that the love of <b>power</b> can actually be a good thing. For instance, if one feels a certain duty towards their neighbours, they may attempt to attain <b>power</b> to help those neighbours (Russell 1938:215–216). In sum, the focus of any policy should not be on a ban on kinds of <b>power,</b> but rather, on certain kinds of use of <b>power</b> (Russell 1938:221).|$|E
5|$|Specifying <b>power</b> levels over 100% {{may seem}} nonsensical, {{but there was}} a logic behind it. The 100% level does not mean the maximum {{physical}} <b>power</b> level attainable, rather it was a specification decided on during engine development—the expected rated <b>power</b> level. When later studies indicated the engine could operate safely at levels above 100%, these higher levels became standard. Maintaining the original relationship of <b>power</b> level to physical thrust helps reduce confusion, as it created an unvarying fixed relationship so that test data (or operational data from past or future missions) can be easily compared. If the <b>power</b> level was increased, and that new value was said to be 100%, then all previous data and documentation would either require changing, or cross-checking against what physical thrust corresponded to 100% <b>power</b> level on that date. Engine <b>power</b> level affects engine reliability, with studies indicating the probability of an engine failure increasing rapidly with <b>power</b> levels over 104.5%, which was why <b>power</b> levels above 104.5% were retained for contingency use only.|$|E
