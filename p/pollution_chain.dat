Examples of policies based on tradable permits can be foundAlso within the Flemish livestock production sector, examples of policies based on tradable permits can be found, e. g. for example, in the dairy and manure policy: the dairy production {{is controlled by the}} imposition of dairy quotas;, the manure policy is based on a set of three systems of tradable permits. This dissertation, for the first time, places {{for the first time the}} different policy measures within under the manure policy in thewithin a framework of tradable permits. It is shown demonstrated that fertilization fertilisation standards are constitute an application of tradable concentration permits. This new framework offers new insights on into the manure policy, as it allows topermits analysis of analyse the impact of individual measures, and but at the same time to takeprovides a global view on of the manure policy itself. Based on these new findings the relevance of keeping retaining NPR’s as a policy tool is discussed, and an ex-ante assessment of the new manure policy is made. The largest partA large proportion of the dissertation focusses on the impact of individual policy measures within both the manure as and dairy policypolicies. It is shown that cChoices of where towith regard to the point of intervenetion along the <b>pollution</b> <b>chain,</b> of how strongthe strength of intervention, and in whichthe manner in which it modifiesto steer farmer’s behaviour and how tothe organiszeation of the associated enforcement strategy have a large substantial impact on the efficiency, effectiveness and farmer behaviour. Policy choices in with regard to the organization organisation of the permit market also have also a large major impact on the functioning of the policy. Trade limitations impact the on the efficiency, the and structural development of the sector, and even can even undermine the effectiveness of the policy. In most cases the policy maker will havehas to make a trade-off between the efficiency and effectiveness of the policy,. hHowever, this is not always the case - as shown forindicated in relation to the derogation option. It is important to take care with regardpay particular attention to the implementation details of the system itself and the organization organisation of the market.

Sulfur (S) {{is a significant}} macronutrient that {{plays a significant role}} in the regulation of plant responses to diverse biotic and abiotic stresses. However, no information is currently available about the impact of S application on ascorbate-glutathione metabolism (ASA-GSH cycle) of Pakchoi plants under Cd stress. The two previously identified genotypes, namely, Aikangqing (a Cd-tolerant cultivar) and Qibaoqing (a Cd-sensitive cultivar), were utilized to investigate the role of S to mitigate Cd toxicity in Pakchoi plants under different Cd regimes. Results showed that Cd stress inhibited plant growth and induced oxidative stress. Exogenous application of S significantly increased the tolerance of Pakchoi seedlings suffering from Cd stress. This effect was demonstrated by increased growth parameters; stimulated activities of the antioxidant enzymes and upregulated genes involved in the ASA-GSH cycle and S assimilation; and by the enhanced ASA, GSH, phytochelatins, and nonprotein thiol production. This study shows that applying S nutrition can mitigate Cd toxicity in Pakchoi plants which has the potential in assisting the development of breeding strategies aimed at limiting Cd phytoaccumulation and decreasing Cd hazards in the food chain...|$|R
5|$|The nymph is the {{dominant}} life history stage of the mayfly. Different insect species vary in their tolerance to water pollution, but in general, the larval stages of mayflies, stoneflies (Plecoptera) and caddis flies (Trichoptera) are susceptible {{to a number of}} pollutants including sewage, pesticides and industrial effluent. In general, mayflies are particularly sensitive to acidification, but tolerances vary, and certain species are exceptionally tolerant to heavy metal contamination and to low pH levels. Ephemerellidae are among the most tolerant groups and Siphlonuridae and Caenidae the least. The adverse effects on the insects of pollution may be either lethal or sub-lethal, in the latter case resulting in altered enzyme function, poor growth, changed behaviour or lack of reproductive success. As important parts of the food <b>chain,</b> <b>pollution</b> can cause knock-on effects to other organisms; a dearth of herbivorous nymphs can cause overgrowth of algae, and a scarcity of predacious nymphs can result in an over-abundance of their prey species. Fish that feed on mayfly nymphs that have bioaccumulated heavy metals are themselves at risk. Adult female mayflies find water by detecting the polarization of reflected light. They are easily fooled by other polished surfaces which can act as traps for swarming mayflies.|$|R

But, too much application causes accumulation of heavy metals in soil, which results in soil pollution and transfer of this <b>pollution</b> to food <b>chain</b> and endangers human and animal health. The aim of this research was to investigate the effect of biological sludge of Tabriz petrochemicals complex on some heavy metals concentration in spring barley grown in a calcareous soil after 6 months of incubation. The experiment was conducted in greenhouse conditions with 5 levels of 0 (control), 25, 50, 75 and 100 ton/ha sewage sludge, in three replications, based on complete randomized blocks design. Soil analysis showed that application of biological sludge significantly increased DTPA extractable Fe, Zn, Mn, Cu and Cd (except 25 ton/ha treatment) compared to the control. The results of plant analysis showed an increase of Fe, Zn and Mn in shoots and Zn and Mn in roots, compared to the control. But elevation of root Fe content was not significant. The amount of Cu and Cd in shoots and roots was below the detection limit of the instrument. Overall, it was concluded that although the application of biological sludge increased the content of heavy metals in soil, but its effect on concentration of toxic elements, such as Cd, in plants was not significant...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} meet the food, feed, fiber, fuel needs of ever {{increasing}} human and animal population world over, particularly in developing nations of Africa and Asia and South America, a commensurate enhancement in crop production has to be in place. The ultimate aim of sustainable agriculture is be to enhance food production on continuous basis while maintaining the natural resource base in accordance with carrying capacity of supporting agro-eco system. Most of the progress in increasing crop production has been realized in favorable environments and high input conditions. In such areas environmental concerns in terms of depletion of natural resource base including soil degradation due to over mining of nutrients, imbalanced fertilization, salinity due to excessive irrigation, water deficits and environmental <b>pollution</b> affecting food <b>chain</b> have already become apparent and points to ponder. Moreover, climatic changes such as increased atmospheric temperature, uncertainly in rainfall; perpetual droughts and floods of varying intensities etc lead to environmental fragility which adversely affects crop production. These are serious issues which need to be looked into, if the food requirements of future generation are to be met on sustainable basis. This would need a holistic system approach to harness natural resources for the welfare for the welfare of mankind through scientific management of land and water resources, use of appropriate agro-technology and judicious exploitation of biodiversity and genetic options for enhancing crop production especially in stress environments. Keeping these facts in view, Jawaharlal Nehru Krishi Vishaw Vidyalaya, jablapur and the society for sustainable Agriculture and Resource management (SSARM) jointly organized an International Conference on "Sustainable Crop Production in Stress Environment: Management and genetic Options" during Feb. 9 - 12, 2005 at JNKVV, Jabalpur (M.

Major purpose of this publication is to highlight the technologies related to management of natural resources and crop improvement/gene technologies that are developed at global level to minimize the effects of biotic and abiotic stress on crop production and for ameliorating yield and stress tolerance potential of crops in green and grey areas as well as socio-economic aspects...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Title: H&M fast fashion {{business}} model in China Level: Bachelor Degree in Business Administration Author: Yuanyuan Yang & Jun Wang Supervisor: Ernst Hollander Date: 2013 - 03 - 11   Aim: Business model {{have been applied}} to different industries, and many entrepreneurs consider a good {{business model}} to be half the success. As per our observation, there were problems existing in H&M in China, for example, quality problem, price advantage lost and so on. However, H&M still has a good sale performance in China and we believed it largely depends on its successful business model. This study aims to examine what H&M fast fashion business model is and how H&M’s business model influences its development in China in different period.   Method: The method we used consisted of research process, research approach and data collection. A qualitative research {{was developed in the}} way of interviews. Primary data was collected from the interview which we conducted with two interviewees of H&M employees from different countries and the other interviewees both work for Chinese fashion industry. Secondary data included relevant extant literature, articles and online resources. As a research tools, SWOT was used to analyze the operation of H&M in China. With the collected data and the previous analysis, the result presents H&M’s short-term, mid term and long-term development in China.   Result & Conclusion: The unique business model is the main reason H&M have such good sales performance even when they have many problems as we had observed from their retail stores in China. H&M makes good use of its supply chain and information system to ensure delivering right products to their customers in the right time and at the right place with the right price. We believe the strengths of its business model would bring a lot of benefits for H&M in short-term development and mid-term development in China. As for the long-term development, the weaknesses of its business model maybe bring some problems.   Suggestions for future research: Quality problem and supply <b>chain</b> <b>pollution</b> is important for H&M’s long term development in China. Therefore, to ensure products’ quality and supply chain management improvement could be studied in future. Moreover, since business model consisted by lots of aspects, in-depth study is necessary in order to better understand H&M business model. Last but not the least, Chinese local fast fashion industry is still on the initial stage and thus, to borrow idea from H&M’s business model to develop Chinese fast fashion industry is interesting and important to be studied in the future.   Contribution of the study: Fast fashion business model have been created based on the business model and fast fashion characteristics. Hopefully, it would be helpful for further study which focuses on fast fashion industry. The specific knowledge of China is able to compensate the situation that most studies are focus on developed countries.   Key words: fast fashion in China, H&M in China, clothing industry, fast fashion business model, Chin...|$|R
