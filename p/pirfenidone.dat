50|$|The first Phase III {{clinical}} trial {{to evaluate the}} efficacy and safety of <b>pirfenidone</b> {{for the treatment of}} patients with IPF was conducted in Japan. This was a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, trial, in which 275 patients with IPF were randomly assigned to receive <b>pirfenidone</b> 1800 mg/day (110 patients), <b>pirfenidone</b> 1200 mg/day (56 patients), or placebo (109 patients), for 52 weeks. <b>Pirfenidone</b> 1800 or 1200 mg/day reduced the mean decline in vital capacity from baseline to week 52 compared with placebo. Progression-free survival was also improved with <b>pirfenidone</b> compared with placebo.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pirfenidone</b> {{demonstrates}} a consistent antifibrotic effect in several animal models of pulmonary fibrosis. Of these, the bleomycin {{model is the}} most widely used model of pulmonary fibrosis. In this model, bleomycin administration results in oxidative stress and acute inflammation, with the subsequent onset of pulmonary fibrosis in a number of animal species including the mouse and hamster. Numerous studies have demonstrated that <b>pirfenidone</b> attenuates bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. One study investigated the effect of <b>pirfenidone</b> over a 42-day period after repeated bleomycin administration. Administration of <b>pirfenidone</b> minimised early lung oedema and pulmonary fibrosis when treatment was initiated concurrently with lung damage. This study evaluated pulmonary protein expression and found <b>pirfenidone</b> treatment normalised expression of proinflammatory and fibrogenic proteins. Similar reductions in pulmonary fibrosis were observed when <b>pirfenidone</b> treatment was delayed until pulmonary fibrosis was established and progressing, i.e. when administered in a therapeutic as opposed to a prophylactic treatment regimen.|$|E
50|$|Cigarette smoking causes {{increased}} clearance of <b>pirfenidone</b> by inducing CYP1A2, thereby decreasing {{exposure to}} the drug. Patients must be advised to abstain from cigarette smoking while on therapy with <b>pirfenidone.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Pirfenidone</b> is {{frequently}} associated with gastrointestinal side effects such as dyspepsia, nausea, gastritis, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and vomiting.To reduce {{the severity of}} these reactions, <b>pirfenidone</b> is to be taken after meals.|$|E
50|$|A {{review by}} the Cochrane Collaboration {{concluded}} that <b>pirfenidone</b> appears to improve progression-free survival and, to a lesser effect, pulmonary function in patients with IPF. Randomised studies comparing non-steroid drugs with placebo or steroids in adult patients with IPF were included. Four placebo-controlled trials of <b>pirfenidone</b> treatment were reviewed, involving a total of 1155 patients. The result of the meta-analysis showed that <b>pirfenidone</b> significantly {{reduces the risk of}} disease progression by 30%. In addition, meta-analysis of the two Japanese studies confirmed the beneficial effect of <b>pirfenidone</b> on the change in VC from baseline compared with placebo.|$|E
50|$|Dizziness {{and fatigue}} have been {{reported}} in patients undergoing <b>pirfenidone</b> treatment. Dizziness typically resolves, although patients should know how they react to <b>pirfenidone</b> before undertaking activities that need mental alertness or coordination. If severe, dose adjustment or treatment discontinuation may be required.|$|E
50|$|The antifibrotic {{effect of}} <b>pirfenidone</b> has been further {{established}} in animal models of cardiac (heart), renal (kidney), and hepatic (liver) fibrosis, {{as well as}} in Dupuytren's contracture. In these models, <b>pirfenidone</b> demonstrated a consistent ability to reduce fibrosis and the expression of fibrogenic mediators.|$|E
50|$|The 5-methyl-2-pyridone {{is used to}} make <b>pirfenidone.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Pirfenidone</b> has {{well-established}} antifibrotic and anti-inflammatory {{properties in}} various in vitro systems and animal models of fibrosis. A number of cell-based {{studies have shown}} that <b>pirfenidone</b> reduces fibroblast proliferation, inhibits TGF-β stimulated collagen production and reduces the production of fibrogenic mediators such as TGF-β. <b>Pirfenidone</b> has also been shown to reduce production of inflammatory mediators such as TNF-α and IL-1β in both cultured cells and isolated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. These activities are consistent with the broader antifibrotic and anti-inflammatory activities observed in animal models of fibrosis.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pirfenidone</b> {{inhibits}} fibroblast growth. Studies {{showed no}} improvement over controls.|$|E
50|$|Since <b>Pirfenidone</b> is metabolised {{through the}} CYP1A2 enzyme pathway, any drug which {{inhibits}} this enzyme {{is likely to}} precipitate the toxicity of pirfenidone: concomitant therapy is to be avoided. Fluvoxamine is contraindicated in patients who are on treatment with <b>pirfenidone.</b> Other inhibitors of CYP1A2 such as ciprofloxacin, amiodarone and propafenone should be used with caution.|$|E
50|$|Treatment to {{slow down}} the {{progression}} of the disease may include nintedanib or <b>pirfenidone.</b>|$|E
50|$|The CAPACITY (004 & 006) {{studies were}} randomized, double-blind, {{placebo-controlled}} Phase III trials in eleven countries across Europe, North America, and Australia. Patients with IPF {{were randomly assigned}} to treatment with oral <b>pirfenidone</b> or placebo for a minimum of 72 weeks. In study 004, <b>pirfenidone</b> reduced decline in forced vital capacity (FVC) (p=0.001). Mean change in FVC at week 72 was -8.0% (SD 16.5) in the <b>pirfenidone</b> 2403 mg/day group and -12.4% (SD 18.5) in the placebo group, a difference of 4.4% (95% CI 0.7 to 9.1). Thirty-five (20%) of 174 versus 60 (35%) of 174 patients, respectively, had an FVC decline of at least 10%. In study 006, the difference between groups in FVC change at week 72 was not significant (p=0.501). Mean change in FVC at week 72 was -9.0% (SD 19.6) in the <b>pirfenidone</b> group and -9.6% (19.1) in the placebo group. The difference between groups in change in predicted FVC at week 72 was not significant (0.6%, 95% CI -3.5 to 4.7).|$|E
50|$|Other {{research}} shows that <b>pirfenidone</b> may be an effective anti-fibrotic treatment for chronic liver fibrosis.|$|E

50|$|The {{clinical}} {{efficacy of}} <b>pirfenidone</b> {{has been studied}} in three Phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).|$|E
5000|$|Two {{pharmacological}} agents {{intended to prevent}} scarring in mild idiopathic fibrosis are <b>pirfenidone,</b> which reduced reductions in the 1-year rate of decline in FVC. <b>Pirfenidone</b> also reduced the decline in distances on the 6-minute walk test, but {{had no effect on}} respiratory symptoms. The second agent is nintedanib, which acts as antifibrotic, mediated through the inhibition of a variety of tyrosine kinase receptors (including platelet-derived growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, and vascular endothelial growth factor). A randomized clinical trial showed it reduced lung-function decline and acute exacerbations.|$|E
50|$|In animal models, <b>pirfenidone</b> {{displays}} a systemic antifibrotic activity {{and has been}} shown to reduce biochemical and histopathological indices of fibrosis of the lung, liver, heart and kidney.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pirfenidone</b> is a {{medication}} {{used for the}} treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). It works by reducing lung fibrosis through downregulation of the production of growth factors and procollagens I and II.|$|E
50|$|A Cochrane review {{comparing}} <b>pirfenidone</b> with placebo, found {{a reduced}} risk of disease progression by 30%. FVC or VC was also improved, {{even if a}} mild slowing in FVC decline could be demonstrated only {{in one of the}} two CAPACITY trials. A third study, which was completed in 2014 found reduced decline in lung function and IPF disease progression. The data from the ASCEND study were also pooled with data from the two CAPACITY studies in a pre-specified analysis which showed that <b>pirfenidone</b> reduced the risk of death by almost 50% over one year of treatment.|$|E
50|$|Some <b>pirfenidone</b> is also metabolized by CYP enzymes {{other than}} CYP1A2. Consequently, strong inhibitors of other CYP {{systems such as}} {{fluconazole}} (CYP2C9), chloramphenicol (CYP2C19), fluoxetine and paroxetine (both CYP2D6) should be used with caution.|$|E
50|$|In May, 2014, {{the results}} of the ASCEND study (Phase III) were published. ASCEND is a randomized, double-blind, {{placebo-controlled}} trial that enrolled 555 patients. The results confirmed observations from previous clinical studies that <b>pirfenidone</b> significantly reduced IPF disease progression as measured by change in percent predicted forced vital capacity (FVC) from Baseline to Week 52 (rank ANCOVA p<0.000001). In addition, significant treatment effects were shown on both of the key secondary endpoints of six-minute walk test distance change (p=0.0360) and progression-free survival (p=0.0001). A pre-specified analysis of the pooled population (N=1,247) from the combined ASCEND and CAPACITY studies (taking CAPACITY mortality data through Week 52) showed that the risk of all-cause mortality was reduced by 48% in the <b>pirfenidone</b> group compared to the placebo group (HR=0.52, log rank p=0.0107).|$|E
50|$|<b>Pirfenidone</b> {{is known}} to cause {{photosensitivity}} reactions, rash, pruritus and dry skin. Patients are usually advised to avoid direct exposure to sunlight, including sun lamps, and to use protective clothing and sunscreening agents. Continuing photosensitivity reactions are usually managed by dose adjustment and temporary discontinuation of treatment if required, along with local symptomatic treatment.|$|E
50|$|In Europe, <b>pirfenidone</b> is {{indicated}} {{for the treatment}} of mild-to-moderate idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. It was approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2011. In October 2008, it was approved for use in Japan, in India in 2010, and in China in 2011 (commercial launch in 2014). In October 2014, it was approved for sale in the United States.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pirfenidone</b> can {{increase}} hepatic enzyme levels, {{especially those of}} aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT) and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT); periodic monitoring of hepatic enzyme levels is required during therapy: once before the initiation of therapy, monthly monitoring until 6 months after initiation of therapy, and 3 monthly thereafter. Extra precaution is required while prescribing the drug in patients with hepatic impairment and in patients who are concomitantly taking a CYP1A2 inhibitor. The drug is contraindicated in patients who have severe hepatic impairment.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Pirfenidone</b> is {{administered}} orally. Though {{the presence of}} food significantly reduces the extent of absorption, the drug is to be taken after food, to reduce the nausea and dizziness associated with the drug. The drug is around 60% bound to plasma proteins, especially to albumin. [...] Up to 50% of the drug is metabolized by hepatic CYP1A2 enzyme system to yield 5-carboxypirfenidone, the inactive metabolite. Almost 80% of the administered dose is excreted in the urine within 24 hours of intake.|$|E
50|$|In May 2010, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration {{declined}} {{to approve the}} use of <b>pirfenidone</b> {{for the treatment of}} idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, requesting additional clinical trials. In December 2010 an advisory panel to the European Medicines Agency recommended approval of the drug. In February 2011, the European Commission (EC) has granted marketing authorisation in all 27 EU member states and China FDA granted approval in September, 2011. Afterwards, a randomised, Phase III trial (the ASCEND study) was completed in the U.S. in 2014, with regulatory approval in U.S. following shortly after.|$|E
50|$|It was {{developed}} by several companies worldwide, including the original patent holder, Marnac, InterMune Inc. (now part of Roche), Shionogi Ltd., and GNI Group Ltd. In 2008, it was first approved in Japan {{for the treatment of}} IPF after clinical trials, under the trade name of Pirespa by Shionogi. In October 2010, the Indian Company Cipla launched it as Pirfenex. In 2011, it was approved for use in Europe for IPF under the trade name Esbriet; it was approved in Canada in 2012 under the trade name Esbriet; and was approved in the United States in October 2014 under the same name. In September 2011, the Chinese State Food and Drug Administration provided GNI Group Ltd with new drug approval of <b>pirfenidone</b> in China, and later manufacture approval in 2013 under the trade name of Etuary.|$|E
40|$|<b>Pirfenidone</b> {{is one of}} two {{approved}} therapies for {{the treatment}} of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Randomised controlled clinical trials and subsequent post hoc analyses have demonstrated that <b>pirfenidone</b> reduces lung function decline, decreases mortality and improves progression-free survival. Long-term extension trials, registries and real-world studies have also shown similar treatment effects with <b>pirfenidone.</b> However, for patients with IPF to obtain the maximum benefits of <b>pirfenidone</b> treatment, the potential adverse events (AEs) associated with <b>pirfenidone</b> need to be managed. This review highlights the well-known and established safety profile of <b>pirfenidone</b> based on randomised controlled clinical trials and real-world data. Key strategies for preventing and managing the most common pirfenidone-related AEs are described, with the goal of maximising adherence to <b>pirfenidone</b> with minimal AEs...|$|E
40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} <b>pirfenidone</b> nanoparticles on corneal re-epithelialization and scarring, major clinical challenges after alkali burn. Effect of <b>pirfenidone</b> on collagen I and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) synthesis by TGFβ induced primary corneal fibroblast cells was evaluated by immunoblotting and immunocytochemistry. <b>Pirfenidone</b> loaded poly (lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) nanoparticles were prepared, characterized and their cellular entry was examined in primary corneal fibroblast cells by fluorescence microscopy. Alkali burn was induced in one eye of Sprague Dawley rats followed by daily topical treatment with free <b>pirfenidone,</b> <b>pirfenidone</b> nanoparticles or vehicle. Corneal re-epithelialization was assessed daily by flourescein dye test; absence of stained area indicated complete re-epithelialization and the time for complete re-epithelialization was determined. Corneal haze was assessed daily for 7 days under slit lamp microscope and graded using a standard method. After 7 days, collagen I deposition in the superficial layer of cornea was examined by immunohistochemistry. <b>Pirfenidone</b> prevented (P< 0. 05) increase in TGF β induced collagen I and α-SMA synthesis by corneal fibroblasts in a dose dependent manner. <b>Pirfenidone</b> could be loaded successfully within PLGA nanoparticles, which entered the corneal fibroblasts within 5 minutes. <b>Pirfenidone</b> nanoparticles but not free <b>pirfenidone</b> significantly (P< 0. 05) reduced collagen I level, corneal haze and the time for corneal re-epithelialization following alkali burn. <b>Pirfenidone</b> decreases collagen synthesis and prevents myofibroblast formation. <b>Pirfenidone</b> nanoparticles improve corneal wound healing and prevent fibrosis. <b>Pirfenidone</b> nanoparticles are of potential value in treating corneal chemical burns and other corneal fibrotic diseases...|$|E
40|$|Idiopathic {{pulmonary}} fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive disease, {{with a median}} survival time of 2 – 5 years. The search for effective treatment has involved numerous clinical trials of investigational agents without significant success. However, in 2011, <b>pirfenidone</b> was the first drug to be approved {{for the treatment of}} IPF in Europe. Four key clinical trials supported the efficacy and tolerability of <b>pirfenidone.</b> In the two recently published Phase III CAPACITY trials evaluating <b>pirfenidone</b> (studies 004 and 006), patients with mild-to-moderate IPF were treated with <b>pirfenidone</b> or placebo. Study 004 and pooled analysis of primary endpoint data from both studies showed that <b>pirfenidone</b> significantly reduced decline in percent-predicted forced vital capacity (FVC) compared with placebo (p< 0. 005). Evidence of beneficial effects of <b>pirfenidone</b> treatment was also observed with regard to several secondary endpoints. <b>Pirfenidone</b> was generally well tolerated, with the most common side effects being gastrointestinal and photosensitivity. Data from the RECAP extension phase of the CAPACITY studies, where patients were treated with <b>pirfenidone</b> for up to three years, further support the manageable tolerability profile of <b>pirfenidone.</b> The efficacy data, coupled with long-term safety data, provide further evidence of a clinically-meaningful treatment effect with <b>pirfenidone</b> in patients with IPF.

40|$|<b>Pirfenidone</b> {{has been}} shown to modify some {{cytokine}} regulatory actions and inhibit fibroblast biochemical reactions resulting in inhibition of proliferation and collagen matrix synthesis by fibroblast. We have investigated the effect of <b>pirfenidone</b> on the expression of cell adhesion molecules. The synovial fibroblasts were treated with IL- 1 α in {{the presence or absence of}} <b>pirfenidone</b> (range 0 – 1000 μm), and assayed for the expression of adhesion molecules such as ICAM- 1 and endothelial-leucocyte adhesion molecule- 1 (E-selectin) by cell ELISA. <b>Pirfenidone</b> significantly down-regulated the expression of ICAM- 1 on cultured synovial fibroblasts in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, expression of E-selectin was not affected. Furthermore, we examined whether <b>pirfenidone</b> affects the cellular binding between cultured lymphocytes and IL- 1 α-stimulated synovial fibroblasts by in vitro binding assay and found their mutual binding was significantly suppressed in a dose-dependent manner by <b>pirfenidone.</b> It is speculated that down-regulation of ICAM- 1 might be one of the novel mechanisms of action of <b>pirfenidone.</b> These data indicate a novel mechanism of action for <b>pirfenidone</b> to reduce the activation of synovial fibroblasts...|$|E
40|$|Cardiac {{fibroblasts}} (CFs) are {{the primary}} cell type responsible for cardiac fibrosis during pathological myocardial remodeling. Several studies have illustrated that <b>pirfenidone</b> (5 -methyl- 1 -phenyl- 2 -[1 H]-pyridone) attenuates cardiac fibrosis in different animal models. However, the effects of <b>pirfenidone</b> on cardiac fibroblast behavior have not been examined. In this study, we investigated whether <b>pirfenidone</b> directly modulates cardiac fibroblast behavior that is important in myocardial remodeling such as proliferation, myofibroblast differentiation, migration and cytokine secretion. Fibroblasts were isolated from neonatal rat hearts and bioassays were performed {{to determine the effects}} of <b>pirfenidone</b> on fibroblast function. We demonstrated that treatment of CFs with <b>pirfenidone</b> resulted in decreased proliferation, and attenuated fibroblast a-smooth muscle actin expression and collagen contractility. Boyden chamber assay illustrated that <b>pirfenidone</b> inhibited fibroblast migration ability, probably by decreasing the ratio of matrix metalloproteinase- 9 to tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase- 1. Furthermore, <b>pirfenidone</b> attenuated the synthesis and secretion of transforming growth factor-b 1 but elevated that of interleukin- 10. These direct and pleiotropic effects of <b>pirfenidone</b> on cardiac fibroblasts point to its potential use in the treatment of adverse myocardial remodeling...|$|E

40|$|Dysfunctional {{mitochondria}} {{participate in}} the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). <b>Pirfenidone</b> is a newly identified anti-fibrotic drug. However, its mechanism remains unclear. Mitochondrial dysfunction is an early event that occurs prior to the onset of renal fibrosis. In this context, we investigated the protective effect of <b>pirfenidone</b> on mitochondria and its relevance to apoptosis and oxidative stress in renal proximal tubular cells. A remnant kidney rat model was established. Human renal proximal tubular epithelial cells (HK 2) using rotenone, a mitochondrial respiratory chain complex Ι inhibitor were further investigated in vitro to examine the mitochondrial protective effect of <b>pirfenidone.</b> <b>Pirfenidone</b> protected mitochondrial structures and functions by stabilizing the mitochondrial membrane potential, maintaining ATP production and improving the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number. <b>Pirfenidone</b> decreased tubular cell apoptosis by inhibiting the mitochondrial apoptotic signaling pathway. <b>Pirfenidone</b> also reduced oxidative stress by enhancing manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) and inhibiting intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, which suggested that the anti-oxidant effects occurred at least partially via the mitochondrial pathway. <b>Pirfenidone</b> may be effective prior to the onset of renal fibrosis because this dru...|$|E
