40|$|There are {{at least}} two {{articulated}} levers (16, 18) arranged in a mirror image formation and linked to shared outer links (12, 14) have toggle links (20, 22) rigidly connected at an adjustable spacing. The first outer link (12) is connectable to the drive of the press, and the second, lower outer link (14) is connected to a <b>press</b> <b>plunger.</b> An adjustment (32, 34) consists of a linear drive piece joining the toggle links and consisting of a threaded spindle (32) and an adjusting motor (34). Each articulated lever consists of pairs of levers (26, 24; 28, 30) joined by the outer links and by bolts (19) belonging to the inner links. ADVANTAGE - The economically produced coupling enables the length to be altered easily, and induces additional movements while the mechanical press is operating...|$|E

50|$|There {{were two}} ways to fire the {{explosive}} hatch during recovery. On {{the inside of the}} hatch was a knobbed plunger. The pilot could remove a pin and <b>press</b> the <b>plunger</b> with a force of 5 or 6 lbf (25 N). This would detonate the explosive charge, which would shear off the 70 bolts and propel the hatch 25 ft away in 1 s. If the pin was left in place, a force of 40 lbf (180 N) was required to detonate the hatch. An outside rescuer could blow open the hatch by removing a small panel near the hatch and pulling a lanyard. The explosive hatch weighed only 23 lb.|$|R
50|$|The {{team that}} goes first picks {{one of two}} categories, leaving the other for the opponents. The team is shown a series of five words, one at a time. Each word has three extra letters added in; {{the first and last}} letters are always correct. Ex. LMOLVLIFPOP. The parent tells the child to knock out the {{incorrect}} letters; the parent tells the child which letter to knock out, and the child touches that letter on the screen. If the team tries to knock out an incorrect letter, then a klaxon sounds and the board locks up; the child must then <b>press</b> a <b>plunger</b> to reset the board before continuing to play. Answer: LOLLIPOP.|$|R
5000|$|The {{signalman}} at Pouparts Junction (T. P. G. Hillman) then {{offered the}} Coulsdon train forward. He {{should not have}} done this until he had received the [...] "Train out of Section" [...] bell signal for the London Bridge train, which Childs denied strongly that he had sent. The enquiry made no definite ruling on this point - {{it was possible that}} Hillman had mistaken another bell signal relating to a down train for the [...] "Train out of Section" [...] signal. However, Childs' fifth and fatal mistake then occurred. He <b>pressed</b> the <b>plunger</b> to accept the Coulsdon train, and, as the enquiry ruled, sent the acceptance bell signal to Hillman. Hillman cleared his signals, and the Coulsdon train entered the occupied section at approximately 40 mph.|$|R
5|$|Deciding to work together, Bart, Lisa, and Bob {{escape and}} try to save the dam. While Lisa and Bob set about {{defusing}} Cecil's dynamite, Bart jumps at Cecil before he can <b>press</b> the <b>plunger.</b> Cecil attempts to swat him off with the briefcase of money, but the case bursts open and the money is lost. Cecil manages to throw Bart off the cliff, declaring he will kill Bart as Bob never could; ironically, Bob grabs the cord of the dynamite and dives down {{in an effort to}} save him. As the two dangle {{down the side of the}} dam, Bob decides to cut the cord on the dynamite in an act of self-sacrifice to prevent Cecil from destroying the town, but his and Bart's perilous fall is broken by a conveniently placed pipe.|$|R

40|$|Tensile {{strength}} and porosity of die-casted Aluminum Alloys Al-Mg-Si with various applied pressure were investigated. Al-Mg-Si was melt {{in the electric}} induction crucible with temperature of 850 degree Celsius. Melt aluminum was poured in the metallic mould that pre-heated in 150 degree Celsius. Melt aluminum was <b>pressed</b> by the <b>plunger</b> with pressure of 0. 1, 10, 30, and 50 MPa and held for 5 minutes. After aluminum was solidified, specimens for tensile {{strength and}} porosity test were machined. Tensile strength, porosity test and microstructure observation were conducted. Results of tensile strength and porosity test show that the higher plunger pressure, porosity becomes lower and tensile strength of specimens to be higher. Maximum tensile strength occurs in the specimens that pressed in 50 MPa. It occurs due to minimum porosity and small grains of microstructure in the specimens...|$|R
30|$|Head kidney leucocytes (HKL) {{isolation}} and culture were performed {{based on the}} protocol described by Joerink et al. (2006). Head kidneys were aseptically excised {{and placed in a}} 100  m nylon cell strainer. Head kidneys were gently <b>pressed</b> with a <b>plunger</b> through a 100 -m sterile nylon mesh and rinsed with PBS. Cell isolation was performed using a 51 / 34  % non-continuous percoll gradient (Sigma-Aldrich). After 25  min centrifugation at 800 ×g, the cells present in the interface of the gradient were collected and washed three times with PBS. The cells were resuspended in complete L- 15 (Gibco) (supplemented with 5  % FBS, 100  U/ml penicillin, and 100  µg/ml streptomycin). About 107  cells/well were seeded in 24 -well plate with 500  µl complete mediums. After recovering overnight at 25  °C, drug treatment was performed using lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (10  µg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich). Then the cells were collected at 3, 6, 9, 12 and 24  h. Total RNA was isolated from the HKLs and qPCR was performed with the gene-specific primers (Table  1) to evaluate the mRNA levels of Tollip, IL- 1 β, and IL- 6.|$|R
25|$|Coffee may be brewed by {{steeping}} in {{a device}} {{such as a}} French press (also known as a cafetière, coffee <b>press</b> or coffee <b>plunger).</b> Ground coffee and hot water are combined in a cylindrical vessel and left to brew for a few minutes. A circular filter which fits tightly in the cylinder fixed to a plunger is then pushed {{down from the top}} to force the grounds to the bottom. The filter retains the grounds at the bottom as the coffee is poured from the container. Because the coffee grounds are in direct contact with the water, all the coffee oils remain in the liquid, making it a stronger beverage. This method of brewing leaves more sediment than in coffee made by an automatic coffee machine. Supporters of the French press method point out that the sediment issue can be minimized by using the right type of grinder: they claim that a rotary blade grinder cuts the coffee bean into a wide range of sizes, including a fine coffee dust that remains as sludge {{at the bottom of the}} cup, while a burr grinder uniformly grinds the beans into consistently-sized grinds, allowing the coffee to settle uniformly and be trapped by the press. Within the first minute of brewing 95% of the caffeine is released from the coffee bean.|$|R
40|$|It {{is known}} that a newly formed glass {{container}} will only possess a very small fraction of its theoretical strength. This suggests that damage occurs {{on the surface of}} the glass melt during the forming process due to glass to mould contact and hot glass handling. It might be expected that any damage inflicted on the surface of a glass article during manufacture would heal at the elevated manufacturing temperatures used, however this does not appear to be true. Therefore, the actual mechanism by which glass strength is reduced during forming needs to be fully understood and the work presented in this thesis addresses this problem. Experiments, therefore, have been carried out here which simulate the formation of glass articles using an experimental pressing rig by systematically altering processing parameters such as the mould material, surface fmish of the mould, pressing temperature and atmosphere. Processing parameters that are used industrially for the formation of glass containers were generally reproduced wherever possible in order to investigate the glass-to-mould interaction. The interaction of both a cast iron mould material and carbon-carbon composite materials with a soda-lime-silica glass were examined using the techniques of scanning electron microscopy, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy in order to determine the type and extent of surface damage formed. The surfaces of the pressed glass samples made were found to contain defects of embedded particles and indented dimples. The embedded particles found were usually due to bulk material transfer from the plunger material used. The texture found {{on the surface of the}} pressed glass samples was found to be directly affected by the surface fmish of the <b>plunger.</b> <b>Pressing</b> glass samples using a cast iron plunger at an initial plunger temperature below 450 °C resulted in a randomly rippled 'chilled' surface. As the initial temperature of the plunger was increased, the surface texture of the pressed glass became a closer replica of the plunger surface. The use of vacuum assistance to form the glass samples also resulted in the surface of the pressed glass becoming a closer replica of the original plunger surface, even at lower pressing temperatures. The surfaces of the cast iron and carbon-carbon composite plungers appeared to have been affected by the initial plunger temperatures used. As the initial pressing temperature was increased, the amount of oxidation for both material types increased. In the case of the carbon-carbon composite materials investigated, both the matrix and fibres were found to have broken down at the pressing temperatures used. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, of the pressed glass surfaces and the plunger materials indicated that sodium ions had migrated from the glass melt to the plunger surface during forming...|$|R
