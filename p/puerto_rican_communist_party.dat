50|$|Levins Morales {{was born}} February 24, 1954 in Indiera Baja, Maricao, Puerto Rico. Her mother, Rosario Morales, was a Harlem-born <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> writer. Her father, Richard Levins, who is Brooklyn born of Ukrainian-Jewish heritage, is an ecologist, a {{population}} geneticist, a mathematical ecologist who has researched diversity in human populations, and John Rock Professor of Population Sciences {{and head of}} the Human Ecology program of the Department of Global Health and Population of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston, Massachusetts. He {{has been a member of}} the US and <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Parties,</b> the Movimiento Pro Independencia (the Independence movement in Puerto Rico), and the <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> Socialist Party, and he was on an FBI surveillance list. During the last two decades, Levins has concentrated on application of ecology to agriculture, particularly in the economically less-well-developed nations of this planet. When her mother, Rosario, died in 2011, she moved in with her father in his Cambridge, Massachusetts home. She has two brothers, Ricardo and Alejandro. Ricardo Levins Morales is a well known poster artist and organizer and lives in Minneapolis, MN. Alejandro Levins is an entrepreneur in Western Massachusetts. The son of her brother Ricardo is Minneapolis-based hip hop artist Manny Phesto.|$|R
50|$|Levins studied {{agriculture}} and mathematics at Cornell. He married <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> writer Rosario Morales in 1950. Blacklisted on his graduation from Cornell, he and Rosario moved to Puerto Rico, where they farmed and did rural organizing. They returned to New York in 1956, where {{he earned his}} PhD at Columbia University (awarded 1965). Levins taught at the University of Puerto Rico from 1961 to 1967 and was a prominent member of the <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> independence movement. He visited Cuba {{for the first time}} in 1964, beginning a lifelong scientific and political collaboration with Cuban biologists. His active participation in the independence and anti-war movements in Puerto Rico led to his being denied tenure at the University of Puerto Rico, and in 1967 he and Rosario and their three children - Aurora, Ricardo, and Alejandro - moved to Chicago, where he taught at the University of Chicago and constantly interacted with Lewontin. Both Richard and Rosario later moved to Harvard with the sponsorship of E. O. Wilson, with whom they had later disputes over sociobiology. Levins was elected member of the US National Academy of Sciences but resigned because of the Academy's role in advising the US military during the war. He had been a member of the US and <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Parties,</b> the Movimiento Pro Independencia (the Independence movement in Puerto Rico), and the <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> Socialist Party, and he was on an FBI surveillance list.|$|R
50|$|The federal {{government}} has never won a sedition case against militia-types or neo-Nazis. Since World War I, they have won numerous seditious conspiracy cases against <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> independentistas, <b>communists</b> {{and others on the}} left, but no one on the radical right has ever been convicted of plotting to overthrow by force of arms the government of the United States.|$|R
50|$|In 1951, Rosario {{moved with}} Dick to Puerto Rico. He had {{recently}} graduated {{and was trying}} to avoid the draft for the Korean War. While in Puerto Rico, the two became active in the <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> and the Fellowship of Reconciliation while working a small farm in the mountains.|$|E
5000|$|After their move to Puerto Rico, both Rosario and Dick became {{members of}} the <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> (1951-1956). Their {{involvement}} in communist activism at this time decreased due to {{the small size of}} the <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> and its structure. The party in Puerto Rico was run by a very small core group, in which the participation of women was uncommon and discouraged. Rosario and Dick became close friends with César Andreu Iglesias, a prominent labor leader and journalist, who was in the leadership of the Party, and his wife, Jane Speed, an Alabama communist organizer. [...] In 1956, Jane attempted to get a leadership position within the party and, subsequently, was forced out of involvement. Both couples left the Communist Party, partially due to this incident, and also because of their disapproval of the factions forming within party leadership.|$|E
50|$|The CGT {{was formed}} in March 1940 at a {{congress}} held in San Juan. The congress was attended by delegates from 42 unions, and it had an initial membership of 72,000. The small <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> {{played a leading role}} in its development. One offshoot of the General Confederation of Workers is the similarly named General Confederation of Farmers.|$|E
5000|$|Castro was {{politically}} active and aligned with leftist {{policies of the}} Costa <b>Rican</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party.</b> She and fellow teachers María Alfaro de Mata, Maria Isabela Carvajal (Carmen Lyra), Adela Ferreto, Angela García, Luisa González, Stella Peralta, Emilia Prieto, Lilia Ramos, Esther Silva and Hortensia Zelaya, who had been radicalized at the Normal School (teacher's college), challenged a society built on privilege and the roles of women being confined to home, marriage, and motherhood. In 1939, she attended the First International Congress of Teachers, held in Havana and returning home founded and organization Teachers United, which would later become the National Association of Educators. In the 1940s, she worked in [...] "cultural missions" [...] to help rural citizens access government services. In 1947, Castro represented Costa Rica at the Primer Congreso Interamericano de Mujeres in Guatemala City, which had been organized by the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom to discuss international issues, including women's suffrage.|$|R
5000|$|When the {{dictatorship}} crumbled, {{she was given}} a scholarship to study abroad, at the Sorbonne, in Apex and also visited schools in Italy and England to evaluate pedagogical methods in use in Europe. She returned in 1921 to manage the Department of Children's Literature at the Normal School of Costa Rica. In 1926, Lyra founded and directed the first Montessori pre-kindergarten, teaching the poorest students of San José. Lyra's home became a gathering place for intellectuals and writers and her politics increasingly moved to the left. In 1931, she and Manuel Mora Valverde founded the Costa <b>Rican</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party.</b> [...] She was joined by fellow teachers María Alfaro de Mata, Odilia Castro Hidalgo, Adela Ferreto, Angela García, Luisa González, Stella Peralta, Emilia Prieto, Lilia Ramos, Esther Silva and Hortensia Zelaya, who had been radicalized at the Normal School (teacher's college), to challenge a society built on privilege and the roles of women being confined to home, marriage, and motherhood. That same year, Lyra and Luisa González formed the Unique Union of Women Workers and suggested {{the creation of a}} union for Costa Rican Teachers, which would not be created until 1939 by Odilia Castro.|$|R
5000|$|The MINH, as an organization, {{does not}} {{aspire to be}} an [...] "electoral party", {{although}} its members are given the freedom to vote or not vote in <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> elections. Controversies exist within the independence movement because the MINH does not compel its members to vote for any particular party, but rather whichever candidate they, as individuals, believe is the best to administer the country. These controversies have greatly impacted the <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> independence movement. Along with the MINH, other independence organizations are the <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> Independence Party, the Nationalist Party of Puerto Rico, the Socialist Front, <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> of Puerto Rico, and the Socialist Workers Movement.|$|R
5000|$|Along with Juan Mari Brás, Andreu Iglesias was {{the founder}} of the Claridad news weekly. He also served as {{president}} of the <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party,</b> and the recipient of the 1960 Award for Excellence in Journalism from the Puerto Rican Institute of Literature. [...] "Andreu was at the very forefront of socialist and independentista movements in Puerto Rico...He was a tireless organizer, a creative editor, and a speaker on the history of the labor movement in Puerto Rico." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 2010, the <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> was reborn, from a {{previous}} organization called [...] "Refundación Comunista". It currently has a political training school called [...] "Escuela Vladimir Lenin", that brings proletarian political education to schools, universities, and workers councils. A similar effort, the [...] "Escuela Manuel Francisco Rojas", was created online to reach an ever-growing group of people connected to the web and social networks. It also published Abayarde Rojo, a weekly periodical that is directed to tackling the reality of Puerto Rico and class struggle.|$|E
50|$|Since then, the SI has {{admitted}} as member parties {{not only the}} FSLN but also the left-wing <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> Independence Party, as well as former <b>Communist</b> <b>parties</b> such as the Democratic Party of the Left of Italy and the Front for the Liberation of Mozambique (FRELIMO).|$|R
5000|$|Rosario Morales (August 23, 1930 - March 23, 2011) was a <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> {{author and}} poet. She {{is best known}} for her book Getting Home Alive which she co-authored with her {{daughter}} Aurora Levins Morales in 1986. [...] She was also significant within the Latina feminist movement and the <b>Communist</b> <b>Party.</b> She describes her own complicated identity in her poem [...] "I am what I am", “I am <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> I am U.S. American… I am Boricua as Boricuas come… I am naturalized Jewish American… I am what I am. Take it or leave me alone." ...|$|R
50|$|Important <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> {{institutions}} {{have emerged from}} this long history.

There is also the National <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> Coalition in Washington, DC, the National <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> Forum, the <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> Family Institute, Boricua College, the Center for <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> Studies of the City University of New York at Hunter College, the <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> Legal Defense and Education Fund, the National Conference of <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> Women, and the New York League of <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> Women, Inc., among others.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} I {{would like to}} discuss the {{identity}} of <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> People in the United States. Since 1898 Puerto Rico has been a US territory and since 1917 <b>Puerto</b> <b>Ricans</b> have had US citizenship. This fact has caused many <b>Puerto</b> <b>Ricans</b> to emigrate to the mainland. Now <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> emigrants 2 ̆ 7 population on the mainland is on a level with the homeland, Puerto Rico. With the growth of <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> emigrants to the US, the image of being <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> has been changing. Now, not all <b>Puerto</b> <b>Ricans</b> speak Spanish and love the <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> dishes. We can say that <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> identity has been changing as society has changed...|$|R
50|$|The PSP {{originated}} as the Movimiento Pro-Independencia (MPI), {{founded on}} January 11, 1959, {{in the city}} of Mayagüez. The MPI was formed by a group of dissidents from the <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> Independence Party (PIP), former militants of the Nationalist Party of Puerto Rico and the <b>Communist</b> <b>Party</b> of Puerto Rico, and university students, some of them members of the Federación de Universitarios Pro Independencia (FUPI). The MPI was greatly influenced by the Cuban Revolution.|$|R
50|$|Puerto Rico has 349 bird species, 83 mammals, 25 amphibians, 61 {{reptiles}} and 677 {{species of}} fish. Birds found nowhere else on earth include for instance the <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> screech owl, the <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> woodpecker, the <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> tody, the green mango, the <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> emerald, the <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> lizard cuckoo, the <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> nightjar and many more. All current endemic 13 land mammals are bats, which includes for instance the greater bulldog bat, the Antillean ghost-faced bat and the Parnell's mustached bat. Extinct native mammals include the plate-toothed giant hutia and the <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> cave rat. Reptiles unique to Puerto Rico include the <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> boa, the guanica blindsnake, the Mona Island iguana, the <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> worm lizard, the <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> galliwasp and the Nichols’ dwarf gecko.

5000|$|The term Nuyorican is also {{sometimes}} {{used to refer}} to the Spanish spoken by New York <b>Puerto</b> <b>Ricans.</b> An estimated 1,800,000 Nuyoricans are said to live in New York city, the largest <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> community outside <b>Puerto</b> Rico. Nuyoricans are not considered <b>Puerto</b> <b>Ricans</b> by some island <b>Puerto</b> <b>Ricans</b> due to cultural differences; this is a very controversial topic amongst both groups of <b>Puerto</b> <b>Ricans.</b> [...] Nuyorican has a broad meaning; originally it meant <b>Puerto</b> <b>Ricans,</b> both island-born and mainland-born, living in New York, but many island-born <b>Puerto</b> <b>Ricans</b> use the term to describe assimilated Americans of <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> descent, living in any US state, or very assimilated or [...] "Americanized" [...] people of <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> ancestry, who largely lost touch with traditional <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> culture, and grew up culturally American, though still identify with Puerto Rico. Ethnic enclaves centered on <b>Puerto</b> <b>Ricans</b> include Spanish Harlem, Manhattan; Williamsburg, Brooklyn; and the South Bronx.|$|R
50|$|A mass {{migration}} from Puerto Rico to Philadelphia coincided with an industrialization <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> economy {{from the late}} 1940s to 1970. Most <b>Puerto</b> <b>Ricans</b> came from rural areas. During the period many <b>Puerto</b> <b>Ricans</b> worked in factories. <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> neighborhoods and organizations formed during the area. By the 1950s <b>Puerto</b> <b>Ricans</b> became the largest Latino and Hispanic group in Philadelphia. In the 1950s many pan-Latino areas were becoming predominately <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican.</b> By 1954, 65% of <b>Puerto</b> <b>Ricans</b> in Philadelphia lived in three neighborhoods north of Center City. In the 1950s <b>Puerto</b> <b>Ricans</b> were settling in those three neighborhoods {{and two of them}} became no longer majority white. Spring Garden, the third, remained predominately White. In the period from 1950 to 1970 the <b>Puerto</b> <b>Rican</b> community expanded by over 60,000. By the 1960s an increase of Cubans arrived in Philadelphia and the proportionate percentage of <b>Puerto</b> <b>Ricans</b> began to decline.|$|R
