[...] "The tige is the <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>plants</b> which, {{directed}} {{into the}} air, supports, and gives growing power to, the branches, the twigs, the leaves, and the flowers. The form, strength, {{and direction of}} the tige depend on the part that each plant has to play among the vast vegetable population of our globe. Plants which need for their life a pure and often-renewed air, are borne by a straight tige, robust and tall. When they have need only of a moist air, more condensed, and more rarely renewed, when they have to creep on the ground or glide in thickets, the tiges are long, flexible, and dragging. If they are to float in the air, sustaining themselves on more robust vegetables, they are provided with flexible, slender, and supple tiges." ...|$|E

In {{the course}} of the {{preceding}} chapter, I hope that the reader has obtained, or may by a little patience both obtain and secure, the idea of a great natural Ordinance, which, in the protection given to the <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>plants</b> necessary to prolong their race, provides, for happier living creatures, food delightful to their taste, and forms either amusing or beautiful to their eyes. Whether in receptacle, calyx, or true husk,--in the cup of the acorn, the fringe of the filbert, the down of the apricot, or bloom of the plum, the powers of Nature consult quite other ends than the mere continuance of oaks and plum trees on the earth; and must be regarded always with gratitude more deep than wonder, when they are indeed seen with human eyes and human intellect.|$|E

50|$|Witsen {{tried to}} {{introduce}} coffee plants from Batavia via Amsterdam to countries in South America. Boerhaave estimated that Witsen had {{put together a}} {{collection of more than}} 1500 paintings of plants that {{came to be known as}} the Codex Witsenii and were for the greater <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>plants</b> growing in and around the Cape Peninsula. These passed into the custody of Caspar Commelin, Professor of Botany at the Athenaeum Illustre and working in the Hortus Botanicus. After Commelin's death they were passed to Johannes Burman, inspiring him to produce Rariorum africanarum plantarum in 1738-9. On Burman's death in 1779, his effects passed to his son, Nicolaas Laurens Burman. After his death in 1793, his effects, including the Codex, were sold by auction in 1800, disappearing from the records. Witsen had contact with the painter Jan de Bray over a plan to improve the city's water-supply, and helped the artist Cornelis de Bruijn, who needed contacts in Egypt and Russia - indeed, it was probably Witsen who encouraged De Bruijn to make drawings of Persepolis, to show to the Royal Society.|$|E
