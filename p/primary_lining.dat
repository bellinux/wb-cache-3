40|$|To {{systematically}} {{study the}} mechanical {{properties of the}} secondary lining for tunnels of the passenger dedicated lines(PDL), in-site monitoring is {{used to measure the}} contact pressures between the <b>primary</b> <b>lining</b> and the secondary lining for some typical tunnels of different Lines, such as Guiguang Line, Lanyu Line and Jinghu Line. According to the research, the contact pressure reaches its maximum value at the moment when the tunnel lining trolley is removed. The load acting on secondary lining is the actual deformation pressure, which is totally different from the loose pressure prescribed in Chinese tunnel criteria. The safety factor for secondary lining under the measured load is higher than that under the criteria load and satisfies the safety requirements. It is therefore possible for the <b>primary</b> <b>lining</b> to sustain the entire surrounding rock pressure with the help of necessary auxiliary method and suitable installation time. The result given in this research enhances our understanding towards the mechanical characteristics of secondary lining for the PDL tunnel and it will be helpful for secondary lining design.

40|$|A {{series of}} {{analytical}} {{studies have been}} performed to investigate the support characteristics of the steel sets embedded in the tunnel <b>primary</b> <b>lining.</b> The analytical models for various modes of loading on an infinite cylinder carrying uniform line load, carrying uniform surface load, reinforced by a single circular ring and reinforced by equidistant rings are proposed respectively. Comparing the deformation characteristics of the infinite cylinder carrying uniform line load and uniform surface load reveals that for a practical tunnel application, {{the difference between the}} deformations induced by line load and equivalent surface load is less than 1. 5 %. The steel set reinforcements in the <b>primary</b> <b>lining</b> can therefore be represented by plane rings in the cylindrical shell. A study of the infinite cylinder reinforced by a single ring reveals that the most prominent effect of a steel set is attributed to its role as a cantilever fixing. It helps carry a certain length of the surrounding ground both ahead and behind before shotcreting and during shotcrete hardening. A subsequent study of the infinite cylinder reinforced by equidistant rings suggests that if the steel set spacing is smaller than a threshold value, the differences of the total stiffness calculated by the proposed method at the locations of the steel sets {{and other parts of the}} liner are negligible. The results obtained by the proposed method and the classical method have negligible differences. If the steel set spacing is larger than a threshold value, the classical method should be used with caution. Besides, the proposed method is more accurate than the classical method for calculating the support characteristics of the composite liner. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. Link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

30|$|Assembled lining is the <b>primary</b> <b>lining</b> {{structure}} type {{for domestic}} and foreign shield tunnel construction. Driven by the requirements of earthquake resistance, line profile modifications, and corrosion resistance, double-layer lining has been adopted. It was applied early in Japan in high-speed railway tunnels, urban arterial road tunnels, metro tunnels, and water transfer tunnels [24]. Double-layer lining will soon be used in China because the diameter and buried depth of underwater highway tunnels continue to increase. Consequently, determining when to choose double-layer lining and the forces between the assembled lining and inner lining must be carefully studied. A new kind of lining structure between the single lining and double-layer lining is proposed {{to deal with the}} riverbed scouring problem posed by river-crossing highway shield tunnels in the Yangzi River region, which has high water pressure and permeable stratum [46]. If this new lining structure can reduce riverbed scouring, then further research and performance measurement will be needed to verify its long-term stability and suitability.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Geosynthetic Clay Liners are {{regularly}} used in Australia in {{solid and liquid}} waste containment applications. GCL's have been accepted worldwide {{as a component of}} what is considered a "best practice " <b>primary</b> <b>lining</b> system design- ie a composite geomembrane/GCL. The performance of composite liners and GCL's has been reported through the monitoring of many such installations. This paper highlights some of the field monitoring of these installations, and discusses the testing that has been performed on Geosynthetic Clay Liners on both a general containment application and a project-specific basis. The comprehensive nature of research and field performance assessment of these materials now facilitates better engineering of containment systems and lower risk of liability for landfill and mine-site operators. One such area of research showing GCL's are leading the way is in odour and greenhouse gas emission reduction-performance data is now available to prepare landfill owners to meet the new Kyoto-driven greenhouse gas emission restrictions and for Carbon Trading! This paper also highlights applications where GCL's are providing unique solutions and pushing the barriers (so to speak) of containment facility designs in a way that only GCL's currently can...|$|E
40|$|Composite shell linings, {{consisting}} of a layer of permanent sprayed concrete to form a <b>primary</b> <b>lining,</b> a layer of spray applied waterproofing membrane and a further layer of sprayed or cast secondary concrete lining, represent the latest development in the tunnelling industry. While demand for the composite shell method is increasing, {{there are still some}} unknowns associated with it. One of the biggest areas of uncertainty for the composite shell method is the extent of composite action in the interfaces between the sprayed waterproofing membrane and the primary and the secondary linings. A research programme is in progress at the University of Southampton, UK, to investigate the behaviour of composite shell SCL tunnels. As part of the testing programme, a series of short-term direct tension and direct shear tests have been carried out on samples cut from panels built up from a sprayed primary layer, spray applied waterproofing membrane and sprayed secondary layer. The aim of the tests has been to understand the fundamental properties of sprayed concrete-membrane bonding systems, especially the impact of the interface roughness on strength and stiffness. This paper will report some of the test results obtained and their significanc...|$|E
40|$|Modern tunnel {{construction}} includes everyday {{monitoring of}} 3 -D displacements of <b>primary</b> <b>lining</b> using sophisticated geodetic instruments. Therefore, {{a large number}} of data is collected, which has to be interpreted correctly. Only in such a way the monitoring results can be useful during tunnel excavation. Correctly analysed displacements enable the prediction of tunnel behaviour up to two tunnel diameters ahead of current face position. Designers use this information to adjust the support system in time, which makes the construction safer and more economic. The thesis is focused on the analysis of measured displacements during the excavation of the 3 -lane Golovec tunnel. Measured displacements are then compared with the geological structure and tectonic features. Some of the characteristic displacement patterns were then linked to certain geological characteristics. The relatively large tunnel cross section within a soft Carboniferous rock formation led to very large displacements making the project interesting for such analysis. Also the description of technology of the Golovec tunnel construction is presented. Displacement monitoring of the tunnel lining {{is an integral part of}} the “New Austrian Tunneling Method”. This method was used for the construction of all tunnels on the Slovenian motorways and also of the Golovec tunnel, which forms a part of Slovenian motorway network...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Tianpingzhai Tunnel on Dazhou-Wanzhou Expressway {{passes through}} the mined-out area, the spatial {{position}} of the goaf changes constantly comparing to the tunnel during excavation, and broken rock mass of the caving zone {{is most likely to}} collapse, which affects construction safety in return. Two dimensional computation models were built by using finite differential software FLAC to simulate excavation process when the coal-mined area is right above or below the tunnel. In 2 D models, goaf strata were regarded as horizontal, and buried depth and coal thickness were limited to 300 meters and 0. 5 meter respectively. The displacement around the tunnel, forces of <b>primary</b> <b>lining,</b> axial force of bolts and plastic zone of surrounding rock have been analyzed under these circumstances that the distances between tunnel and goaf are 1 m, 6 m and 12 m. According to the results, when the distance between goaf and tunnel is less than 12 meters， underlying goaf has greater impact on the displacement around the tunnel and average axial force of bolts than overlying goaf, as well as the size of plastic zone of surrounding rock. It’s strongly suggested to avoid underlying goaf if the tunnel have to pass through the mined-out area...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the design, construction and calibration of a hybrid hydraulic/electrical type of earth pressure cell {{and the subsequent}} use of these cells for the measurement of radial ground pressures bearing on concrete segmental tunnel linings at two locations in mixed clayey ground in north-east England. Also described is an accompanying programme of lining distortion measurement and a preliminary discussion is directed towards theoretical aspects of ground/lining interaction mechanics. The tunnels studied were 3. 20 m diameter and at depths of 11. 77 m and 12. 39 m to the crown. Lining/soil radial interaction pressures {{were found to be}} almost uniformly distributed about the tunnel, these recorded pressures being almost one-half the maximum possible overburden pressure calculated on a ɤ z basis. Furthermore, these ultimate pressures were achieved after a period of only 7 to 8 days following lining erection and grouting. Ultimate measured lining ring distortions were also realized after this 7 day period. This relatively rapid stabilisation of ground pressure contrasts with a much more protracted, on-going distortion reported by other workers in other materials, but is consistent with contractual experience which suggests that tunnel secondary linings could be safely erected, with little risk of brittle fracture, much earlier following <b>primary</b> <b>lining</b> construction than has hitherto been considered prudent...|$|E
40|$|The Boom Clay is {{considered}} as a candidate host-rock for the Belgian disposal of radioactive waste. Thanks to the recent sinking of a new shaft to extend the underground laboratory at the Mol site, new in-situ data have been obtained. They consist in the observation of an important fracturing evidenced during the excavation of the shaft annexes and in well-correlated hydraulic perturbations in the far field (maximum of 0. 2 MPa at 60 m radius). These observations cannot be explained from simple poroplastic models that predict a maximum perturbation extent of 25 m under full deconfinement. Thus, increasingly more complex models are built to explain this discrepancy. It is proposed that the low support pressure imposed by the <b>primary</b> <b>lining,</b> combined with the large time over which this support condition held, has favoured the decompression of the clay massif through differed effects, mainly skeleton viscosity. This resulted in fracturing in the near field, leading to an apparent increase of the excavated radius and to a hydraulic perturbation in the far field. This interpretation {{still needs to be}} validated/invalidated with future data (available next year). The effects on the overall performance of the repository should remain limited due to self-healing. 1...|$|E
