Carmustine implant wafers were demonstrated to improve survival in randomized placebo-controlled trials in patients undergoing a near total resection of newly diagnosed or recurrent malignant glioma. Based on these trials and other supporting data, carmustine wafer therapy was approved for use for newly diagnosed and recurrent malignant glioma in the United States and the European Union. Adverse events are uncommon, and as this therapy is placed at the time of surgery, it does not add to patient treatment burden. Nevertheless, this therapy appears to be underutilized. This article reviews the evidence for a favorable therapeutic ratio for the patient and the potential barriers. Consideration of these issues is important for optimal use of this therapeutic approach and may be important as this technology and other local therapies are further developed in the future.

40|$|The {{incidence}} of invasive fungal infec-tions remains high {{due to the}} growing population of immunocompromised pa-tients, including those with hematologic malignancy, neutropenia, diabetes melli-tus, and parenteral hyperalimentation. 1, 2 This increased incidence has translated into an increase in central nervous system (CNS) infections such as invasive candidi-asis and aspergillosis. Other risk factors for fungal meningitis include neurosur-gery, previous treatment with broad-spec-trum antibiotics or corticosteroids, sys-temic candidiasis, intravenous drug abuse, intravascular catheters, recent abdominal surgery, and severe burn injury. 1 - 3 Postneu-rosurgical fungal meningitis is thought to occur from direct inoculation of the organ-ism into the CNS during surgery and is of-ten associated with concomitant use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. 1 - 4 Candida spp. {{are the most common}} source of fun-gal meningitis in neurosurgery patients. One study found Candida spp. to be the fourth leading cause of infectious menin-gitis, especially in patients with ventricu-loperitoneal shunts or ventriculostomy catheters in place. 5 Despite the introduc-tion of several new antifungal agents over the past decade, mortality with invasive candidiasis and CNS involvement remains high, likely in part due to inadequate CNS penetration by many of the available antifungal agents. 6 Therefore, prevention of invasive candidi-asis by avoidance of precipitating factors may represent an ideal strategy to minimize these infections and associated co-morbidities. Local delivery of chemotherapeutic agents by novel de-vices may cause less systemic adverse effects such as nau-sea, vomiting, and bone marrow suppression.

The carmustine implant wafer was demonstrated to improve survival in blinded placebo-controlled trials in selected patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent malignant glioma, with little increased risk of adverse events. Based on these trials and other supporting data, US and European regulatory authorities granted approval for its use in recurrent and newly diagnosed malignant glioma, and it remains the only approved local treatment. The preclinical and clinical data {{suggest that it is}} optimally utilized primarily in the proportion of patients who may have total or near total removal of gross tumor. The aim of this work was to review the evidence for the use of carmustine implants in the management of malignant astrocytoma (World Health Organization grades III and IV), including newly diagnosed and recurrent disease, especially in the setting of a standard of care that has changed since the randomized trials were completed. Therapy has evolved such that patients now generally receive temozolomide chemotherapy during and after radiotherapy treatment. For patients undergoing repeat resection for malignant glioma, a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled trial demonstrated a median survival for 110 patients who received carmustine polymers of 31 weeks compared with 23 weeks for 122 patients who only received placebo polymers. The benefit achieved statistical significance only on analysis adjusting for prognostic factors rather than for the randomized groups as a whole (hazard ratio = 0. 67, P = 0. 006). A blinded, placebo-controlled trial has also been performed for carmustine implant placement in newly diagnosed patients prior to standard radiotherapy. Median survival was improved from 11. 6 to 13. 9 months (P = 0. 03), with a 29 % reduction in the risk of death. When patients with glioblastoma multiforme alone were analyzed, the median survival improved from 11. 4 to 13. 5 months, but this improvement was not statistically significant. When a Cox&# 39;s proportional hazard model was utilized to account for other potential prognostic factors, there was a significant 31 % reduction in the risk of death (P = 0. 04) in this subgroup. Data from other small reports support these results and confirm that the incidence of adverse events {{does not appear to be}} increased meaningfully. Given the poor prognosis without possibility of cure, these benefits from a treatment with a favorable safety profile were considered meaningful. There is randomized evidence to support the use of carmustine wafers placed during resection of recurrent disease. Therefore, although there is limited specific evidence, this treatment is likely to be efficacious in an environment when nearly all patients receive temozolomide as part of initial management. Given that half of the patients in the randomized trial assessing the value of carmustine implants in recurrent disease had received prior chemotherapy, it is likely that this remains a valuable treatment at the time of repeat resection, even after temozolomide. There are data from multiple reports to support safety. Although there is randomized evidence to support the use of this therapy in newly diagnosed patients who will receive radiotherapy alone, it is now standard to administer both adjuvant temozolomide and radiotherapy. There are survival outcome reports for small cohorts of patients receiving temozolomide with radiotherapy, but this information is not sufficient to support firm recommendations. Based on the rationale and evidence of safety, this approach appears to be a reasonable option as more information is acquired. Available data support the safety of using carmustine wafers in this circumstance, although special attention to surgical guidelines for implanting the wafers is warranted.
