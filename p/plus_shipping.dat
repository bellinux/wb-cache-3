2500|$|The console {{was first}} {{released}} in Japan on June 23, 1996. Though the initial shipment of 300,000 units sold {{out on the}} first day, Nintendo successfully avoided {{a repeat of the}} Super Famicom launch day pandemonium, in part by using a wider retail network which included convenience stores. In the months between the Japanese and North American launches, the Nintendo 64 saw brisk sales on the American grey market, despite import stores charging as much as $699 <b>plus</b> <b>shipping</b> for the system. The Nintendo 64 was first sold in North America on September 26, 1996, despite having been advertised for the 29th. It was launched with just two games in the United States, Pilotwings 64 and Super Mario 64. In 1994, prior to the launch, Nintendo of America chairman Howard Lincoln emphasized the quality of first-party games, saying [...] "... we're convinced that a few great games at launch are more important than great games mixed in with a lot of dogs". The PAL version of the console was released in Europe on March 1, 1997. According to Nintendo of America representatives, Nintendo had been planning a simultaneous launch in Japan, North America, and Europe, but market studies indicated that worldwide demand for the system far exceeded the number of units they could have ready by launch, potentially leading to consumer and retailer frustration.|$|E

5000|$|Summit and {{his team}} were striving to create a system that was adaptable. The system would allow users to gain the desired search outcome they sought in an easy and {{efficient}} manner.

When Summit's proposal was rejected over the Bunker Ramo System, he did not give up and instead created a smaller scale proposal, with minimized economic investment, for an experiment with Dialog to run parallel to Bunker Ramo. The minimalist proposal at the Ames Research Center {{proved to be more}} successful than the Bunker Ramo System leading to Dialog earning a contract with NASA in 1966 (Summit, 2002). [...] Information searches within the NASA STAR database went from taking 14 hours, <b>plus</b> <b>shipping</b> and handling, to a few minutes with Summit's Dialog system.
