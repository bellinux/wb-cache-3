5|$|Newborn {{children}} with hypothyroidism may have normal birth weight and height (although the head may {{be larger than}} expected and the <b>posterior</b> <b>fontanelle</b> may be open). Some may have drowsiness, decreased muscle tone, a hoarse-sounding cry, feeding difficulties, constipation, an enlarged tongue, umbilical hernia, dry skin, a decreased body temperature and jaundice. A goiter is rare, although it may develop later in children who have a thyroid gland that does not produce functioning thyroid hormone. A goiter may also develop in children growing up in areas with iodine deficiency. Normal growth and development may be delayed, and not treating infants may lead to an intellectual impairment (IQ 6–15 points lower in severe cases). Other problems include the following: large scale and fine motor skills and coordination, reduced muscle tone, squinting, decreased attention span, and delayed speaking. Tooth eruption may be delayed.|$|E

New diagnostic characters of Phractocephalus are presented that apply to the modern and fossil species, including: 1) ornamentation of skull, pectoral girdle and fin spines comprising a coarse meshwork of reticulating ridges surrounding rounded pits plus some elongate ridges and sulci; 2) supraoccipital posterior process greatly expanded laterally and posteriorly behind occipital wall; 3) lateral ethmoid and sphenotic broadly sutured behind eye; 4) anterior cranial fontanelle reduced or completely closed and <b>posterior</b> cranial <b>fontanelle</b> closed; 5) vomerine tooth plate large, roughly pentagonal to triangular in form, and with fine teeth.

5000|$|At birth, {{the human}} skull {{is made up}} of 44 {{separate}} bony elements. During development, many of these bony elements gradually fuse together into solid bone (for example, the frontal bone). The bones of the roof of the skull are initially separated by regions of dense connective tissue called fontanelles. There are six fontanelles: one anterior (or frontal), one posterior (or occipital), two sphenoid (or anterolateral), and two mastoid (or posterolateral). At birth these regions are fibrous and moveable, necessary for birth and later growth. This growth can put a large amount of tension on the [...] "obstetrical hinge", which is where the squamous and lateral parts of the occipital bone meet. A possible complication of this tension is rupture of the great cerebral vein. As growth and ossification progress, the connective tissue of the fontanelles is invaded and replaced by bone creating sutures. The five sutures are the two squamous sutures, one coronal, one lambdoid, and one sagittal suture. The <b>posterior</b> <b>fontanelle</b> usually closes by eight weeks, but the anterior fontanel can remain open up to eighteen months. The anterior fontanelle is located at the junction of the frontal and parietal bones; it is a [...] "soft spot" [...] on a baby's forehead. Careful observation will show that you can count a baby's heart rate by observing the pulse pulsing softly through the anterior fontanelle.|$|E

METHODS: Eighty-five premature neonates were evaluated in this prospective study.

40|$|OBJETIVO: Avaliar o uso da fontanela {{posterior}} em recém-nascidos prematuros (< 37 semanas) e com peso de nascimento < 1. 500 g no diagnóstico ultra-sonográfico da hemorragia periintraventricular e verificar se a utilização da fontanela anterior associada à posterior modifica a concordância entre examinadores. MÉTODOS: Estudo prospectivo, onde foram avaliados 85 recém-nascidos. O ultra-som foi realizado através da fontanela anterior e, a seguir, pela posterior. Para a análise da concordância entre a fontanela anterior isolada e em associação à posterior, foi considerado o diagnóstico consensual entre dois examinadores. Na falta de consenso, um terceiro examinador decidiu. RESULTADOS: A concordância entre os dois primeiros examinadores apresentou Kappa de 0, 80 (IC 95 % 0, 76 - 0, 84). Entretanto, na avaliação apenas da fontanela anterior, o Kappa foi de 0, 74 (IC 95 % 0, 70 - 0, 78). Trinta e sete hemisférios apresentaram hemorragia grau II; desses, o diagnóstico foi realizado pela fontanela anterior em 17 hemisférios (45, 9 %); em 10 (27 %), o diagnóstico foi suspeitado pela fontanela anterior e confirmado pela posterior; e em 10 (27 %), o diagnóstico foi realizado exclusivamente pela posterior. Das 454 avaliações o uso da fontanela posterior permitiu que o diagnóstico de hemorragia periintraventricular fosse realizado em 20 (4, 4 %) (< p 0, 001). CONCLUSÕES: Neste estudo, a fontanela anterior associada à posterior foi superior à anterior isolada na detecção da hemorragia periintraventricular.

Methods: A prospective analysis of 102 consecutive helical computed tomography scans of the paranasal sinuses {{was carried out by}} 2 senior ENT surgeons. Distances from the sphenopalatine foramen to endoscopically palpable bony landmarks were measured. Results: There were a total of 102 patients (45 females and 57 males), {{with a mean age of}} 62 years. The mean distance from the <b>posterior</b> <b>fontanelle</b> to the sphenopalatine foramen was 14. 1 mm (standard deviation = 2. 13). The average vertical distance of the sphenopalatine foramen opening from the bony attachment of the inferior turbinate was 14. 13 mm.

40|$|In the Netherlands between 179. 000 and 204. 000 {{children}} were born annually during the last ten years. Congenital anomalies occur in 1 in 33 births. Th e most frequent anomaly involves the heart with a prevalence of 1 in 150 births (66. 7 per 10. 000 births). Th e ventricular septal defects occur the most frequent (30. 0 per 10. 000 births) (Central Bureau of Statistics Netherlands, European Registration of Congenital Anomalies, National Neonatology Registration). A rare congenital anomaly is craniosynostosis, affecting 1 in 2. 500 births. Th e newborns cranial vault is composed of seven individual bones separated by sutures. Th is arrangement accommodates transient skull distortion during birth and permits future growth of the brain, the volume of which quadruples during the fi rst two years of life. Th ere are six major cranial sutures: the metopic, two coronal, the sagittal, and two lambdoid sutures. Six additional sutures are considered minor: two frontonasal, two temporosquamosal, and two frontosphenoidal. At the anterior of the skull, the sagittal, coronal, and metopic sutures meet to form the anterior fontanelle.
