40|$|Leptin, insulin, and amylin are the {{so called}} adi− posity signals; they inform the brain {{about the amount of}} fat {{deposited}} in the body. Leptin is produced and secreted directly by the fat cells, depending on the amount of body fat, whereas insulin and amylin originate from the <b>pancreas.</b> <b>All</b> 3 adiposity signals reduce food intake and increase energy release. Part of their effect is to increase the action of physiological satiation sig− nals. If the amount of fat increases, however, lep− tin resistance often develops. This explains why, for example, the regulation mechanisms trigge− red by leptin do not work effectively in obese people.

40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Abdominal {{obesity is}} closely related to type 2 {{diabetes}} and overactivity of the endocannabinoid system. The present review aims at evaluating the role of endocannabinoid system in glucose dysregulation and the effects of cannabinoid 1 receptor blockade on glucose metabolism in both animal models and overweight/obese humans, especially with type 2 diabetes. RECENT FINDINGS: Cannabinoid 1 receptors have been identified not only in the brain, but also in the adipose tissue, the gut, the liver, the skeletal muscle and even the <b>pancreas,</b> <b>all</b> organs playing a key role in glucose metabolism and type 2 diabetes. Rimonabant, the first selective cannabinoid 1 receptor blocker in clinical use, has been shown to reduce body weight, waist circumference, glycated haemoglobin, triglycerides, insulin resistance index, and to increase HDL cholesterol and adiponectin concentrations in patients with type 2 diabetes, confirming data on nondiabetic overweight/obese patients. Almost half of the metabolic changes, including glycated haemoglobin reduction, could not be explained by weight loss, in agreement with direct peripheral effects. SUMMARY: Cannabinoid 1 blockade reduces food intake and body weight and improves metabolic regulation beyond just weight loss. Because of its positive effect on glucose metabolism, rimonabant deserves consideration in the treatment of overweight/obese patients with type 2 diabetes. Peer reviewe...|$|E

Thus, the cells and mediators responsible for the PMN recruitment into skin, joints, or gut during DTHRs remain unknown. Analyzing hapten-induced DTHRs of the skin, we found that mast cells determine the T cell–dependent PMN recruitment through two mediators, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and the CXC chemokine macrophage inflammatory protein 2 (MIP- 2), the functional analogue of human interleukin 8. Extractable MIP- 2 protein was abundant during DTHRs in and around mast cells of wild-type (WT) mice but absent in mast cell– deficient WBB 6 F 1 -KitW /KitW-v (KitW/KitW-v) mice.

40|$|The exocrine <b>pancreas</b> synthesizes <b>all</b> the enzymes {{needed for}} {{intestinal}} breakdown of proteins, fats, and carbohydrates in our diet.

40|$|Background—Matrix metalloproteinases play an {{important}} role in the control of local tumour growth and metastasis of human pancreatic cancer.  Aims—To examine expression of recently discovered stromelysin 3 (STR- 3) in human pancreatic cancer and pancreatic carcinoma cell lines and to investigate their regulation by retinoids.  Methods—STR- 3 expression was examined by immunohistochemistry in 21 human pancreatic carcinomas. Expression of STR- 3 and regulation by retinoids was assessed in five human pancreatic carcinoma cell lines using western and northern blotting as well as nuclear run on assays.  Results—There was pronounced overexpression of STR- 3 in 17 of 21 (80. 9 %) pancreatic carcinoma specimens. STR- 3 expression was predominantly located in peritumourous stromal cells. Six of 21 (28. 5 %) carcinomas also revealed STR- 3 expression in epithelial tumour cells whereas no STR- 3 expression was observed in non-transformed <b>pancreas.</b> <b>All</b> five pancreatic carcinoma cell lines expressed STR- 3 mRNA and protein. Furthermore, retinoid treatment results in a time and dose dependent inhibition of STR- 3 protein expression. This inhibition seems to be post-transcriptional as neither STR- 3 gene transcription nor mRNA steady state concentrations were affected by retinoids.  Conclusions—STR- 3 overexpression in stromal as well as epithelial elements during pancreatic carcinogenesis might contribute to the aggressive local growth and metastasis of pancreatic cancer and can be therapeutically targeted by retinoids. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{original}} publication {{is available}} at www. springerlink. comBackground: Inoperable pancreatic cancer has a dismal prognosis. Palliation involves either stenting or surgical bypass. Stenting does not relieve gastric outlet obstruction, and surgical bypass is a major procedure. A minimally invasive procedure is needed that relieves both gastric outlet and biliary obstruction, {{with the potential for}} relieving pain. Methods: In an experimental model, pancreatic electrolysis was investigated. The pancreatic duct was cannulated via a transduodenal approach with an electrode catheter. In 6 animals an electrolytic "lesion" was created using a direct current generator. Six animals were controls. The local and systemic effects of electrolysis were assessed using histological and biochemical parameters. Results: The pancreatic duct was cannulated in all animals and treatment was uneventful. Electrolytic lesions comprised a central area of necrosis with a sharp demarcation between necrotic and viable <b>pancreas.</b> <b>All</b> animals developed transient hyperamylasemia after electrolysis. There {{was no significant difference between}} treatment and controls. Importantly, no animal had clinical, biochemical, or histological evidence of pancreatitis.

We observed that, after pancreatectomy, STZ-diabetic mice showed a rapid improvement in glycaemic status, starting from the 8 th postoperative day, and remained normoglycaemic throughout a 90 -day follow-up study. STZ-induced diabetic and control non-diabetic BALB/c mice underwent pancreatectomy and were monitored regularly for changes in body weight, plasma glucose and serum insulin concentrations and histological status of the <b>pancreas.</b> <b>All</b> the pancreatectomised animals showed euglycaemic status from about 20 days after operation, whereas a majority (around 70 %) of the diabetic, sham-operated animals died of sustained hyperglycaemia by 20 - 30 days after operation.

The increment in insulin concentrations and subsequent decrement in glycaemia of the diabetic pancreatectomised animals indicate islet neogenesis occurring after the operative insult, leading to a normoglycaemic status, probably recapitulating ontogeny.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The severity of AGP was compared retrospectively in patients with and without pancreas divisum. Acute gallstone pancreatitis was defined by clinical, biological, radiological, and endoscopic features. Thirteen patients with AGP and pancreas divisum were identified among those presenting with AGP between 1989 and 2000. Pancreas divisum patients were compared to 39 control individuals with AGP and conjugate <b>pancreas.</b> <b>All</b> patients underwent biliary sphincterotomy. Levels of serum amylases, lipases, C-reactive protein (CRP), and white blood cells (WBC) were compared in patients with AGP and pancreas divisum and in control individuals before sphincterotomy. The severity of pancreatitis was assessed {{on the basis of}} CRP, Ranson's score, computed tomography, the need for intensive care and drainage of collections or necrosis, duration of hospitalization, and mortality. RESULTS: Patients with AGP and pancreas divisum had a lower severity grade at CT scanning than control individuals (P = 0. 005), a shorter hospitalization period (5 +/- 1. 9 vs. 11. 6 +/- 1. 6 nights; P = 0. 032), and lower mortality (none of 13 vs. four of 39; P = 0. 048).

RESULTS: Tumor was located in the uncinate process of the <b>pancreas</b> in <b>all</b> nine patients. Three patients had stents inserted in the main pancreatic duct due to injury. The mean size of tumor was 28. 4 mm. Postoperative complications were found in five patients: 3 pancreatic leakages, a pancreatitis, and a duodenal stricture. Pancreatic leakages were improved by external drainage. No perioperative mortality was observed and all patients are recorded alive during the mean follow-up period of 17. 2 mo. CONCLUSION: In selected patients after careful evaluation, LPHR can be used for the treatment of branch duct type IPMN. In order to avoid pancreatic ductal injury, pre- and intra-operative definite localization and careful operative techniques are required...|$|R
40|$|Expression and {{processing}} of progastrin {{were examined in}} fetal, neonatal, and adult pancreatic tissue from five mammalian species (cat, dog, man, pig, and rat). A library of sensitive, sequence-specific immunoassays for progastrin and its products was used to monitor extractions and chromatography before and after cleavage with processing-like enzymes. The results showed that progastrin and its products are expressed in the <b>pancreas</b> of <b>all</b> species in total concentrations varying from 0. 3 to 58. 9 pmol/g of tissue (medians). The degree of processing was age- and species-dependent. In comparison with adult pancreatic tissue the fetal or neonatal pancreas processed a higher fraction to bioactive, C-terminally amidated gastrin. Nevertheless, the pancreatic processing was always less complete {{than that of the}} adult antral mucosa. The moderate level of expression and the attenuated processing in the adult pancreas contribute to explain previous failures to detect gastrin in normal pancreatic tissue. Our results indicate that gastrin-producing tumors in the pancreas are not ectopic, but arise from cells that normally express the gastrin gene...|$|R
40|$|The Author(s) 2010. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract Type 1 diabetes (T 1 D) {{is considered a}} disorder whose pathogenesis is autoimmune in origin, a notion drawn in large part from studies of human pancreata performed {{as far back as}} the 1960 s. While studies of the genetics, epidemiology, and peripheral immunity in T 1 D have been subject to widespread analysis over the ensuing decades, efforts to understand the disorder through analysis of human pancreata have been far more limited. We have reviewed the published literature pertaining to the pathology of the human <b>pancreas</b> throughout <b>all</b> stages in the natural history of T 1 D. This effort uncovered a series of findings that challenge many dogmas ascribed to T 1 D and revealed data suggesting the marked heterogeneity in terms of its pathology. An improved understanding and appreciation for pancreatic pathology in T 1 D could lead to improved disease classification, an understanding of why the disorder occurs, and better therapies for disease prevention and management...|$|R
