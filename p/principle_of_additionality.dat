Such a balkanized approach to establishing RECs markets and incentives state by state creates issues of equity as some states could legitimately claim that their neighboring states (and their electricity consumers) with voluntary RPS are operating as free riders of pollution prevention, paid for by states (and their electricity consumers) with mandatory RPS. We can learn from EPA's SOx and NOx cap and trade program regarding how the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>additionality</b> with a national standard provided a benchmark for measuring and validating the commodification of pollution prevention credits that lead to market-driven initiatives with proven results in improving regional and national air quality.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Providing an {{economic}} case for establishing new protected areas and demonstrating how conservation enhances human well-being is becoming necessary to reinforce moral arguments for biodiversity protection. Accordingly; this study aimed {{to assess whether}} the spatial distribution of priority areas changes in accordance with gains in economic-efficiency when ecosystem service benefits are explicitly considered. Using the site-selection software Marxan, priority areas for South Africa were identified under four scenarios, two of which incorporated a spatial cost benefit analysis of the opportunity costs and ecosystem service benefits associated with conservation. Additional scenarios assessed how reserve design and costs changed when communal-land agriculture and resource use were weighted {{to account for the}} social costs of conservation. Opportunity costs were spatially variable and greatest in regions where mixed commercial farming was practiced. Economic benefits exceeded costs in the western interior, northern regions and along the eastern coastline. These areas contracted when ecosystem service benefits were more conservatively estimated by applying the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>additionality.</b> There was minimal to moderate spatial agreement between the scenarios (0. 12 100) were applied, the reserve systems became dispersed (R = 0. 91 (for weighting factor of 10), R = 0. 52 (for weighting factor of 1000)) in the former homelands and more costly overall (difference of R 2. 95 B between the extremes). Considering the economic benefits of conservation changes the spatial distribution of priority areas and improves their economic efficiency. Disregarding economic benefits may compromise the implementation potential of priority areas, particularly when the economic benefits of competing land-uses are brought to the table. Furthermore, it is important to explicitly consider the social costs of conservation and consider resettlement or compensation costs among the trade-offs...|$|E

The first section includes {{a description of the}} foundational aspects of the private refugee sponsorship landscape in Canada; namely the original purpose of the PSR program as it was defined in 1978, the requirements involved to become a private sponsor, as well as the underlying <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>additionality</b> and diversity inherent to the system. The second section details a full historical account of the evolution of the PSR system, including the identification of the number of refugees who have come to Canada through PSR from 1979 until 2012. The third section identifies the structural changes to PSR which came about through the most recent Government reforms beginning in 2010, the Government rationale for the most drastic reforms, as well as the potential implications these changes will have on the future of private sponsorship in Canada. The fourth and final section proposes a set of recommendations to re-align the PSR system with the goals, objectives, and principles set out in 1978. These recommendations, including the establishment of a National Refugee Sponsorship Organization and Refugee Family Reunification Program, serve to address some of the major challenges evident in the PSR system today and suggest practical steps forward to better serve the needs of all stakeholders involved in the Canadian private sponsorship system...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} three {{challenges for}} biodiversity planning, which arise {{from a study}} in Papua New Guinea, but apply equally to biodiversity planning in general. These are 1) {{the best use of}} available data for providing biodiversity surrogate information, 2) the integration of representativeness and persistence goals into the area prioritization process, and 3) implications for the implementation of a conservation plan over time. Each of these problems is linked to the effective use of complementarity. Further, we find that a probabilistic framework for calculating persistence-based complementarity values over time can contribute to resolving each challenge. Probabilities allow for the exploration of a range of possible complementarity values over different planning scenarios, and provide a way to evaluate biodiversity surrogates. The integration of representativeness and persistence goals, via estimated probabilities of persistence, facilitates the crediting of partial protection provided by sympathetic management. For the selection of priority areas and land use allocation, partial protection may be a "given" or implied by an allocated land use. Such an integration also allows the incorporation of vulnerability/threat information at the level of attributes or areas, incorporating persistence values that may depend on reserve design. As an example of the use of persistence probabilities, we derive an alternative proposed priority area set for PNG. This is based on 1) a goal of 0. 99 probability of persistence of all biodiversity surrogate attributes used in the study, 2) an assumption of a 0. 10 probability of persistence {{in the absence of any}} form of formal protection, and 3) a 0. 90 probability of persistence for surrogate attributes in proposed priority areas, assuming formal protection is afforded to them. The calculus of persistence also leads to a proposed system of environmental levies based on biodiversity complementarity values. The assigned levy for an area may change to reflect its changing complementarity value in light of changes to protection status of other areas. We also propose a number of complementarity-based options for a carbon credits framework. These address required <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>additionality</b> and collateral benefits from biodiversity protection. A related biodiversity credits scheme, also based on complementarity, encourages investments in those areas that make greatest ongoing contributions to regional biodiversity representation and persistence. All these new methods point to a new ·systematic conservation planning" that is not focused only on selecting sets of areas but utilizes complementarity values and changes in probabilities of persistence for a range of decision making processes. The cornerstone of biodiversity planning, complementarity, no longer reflects only relative amounts of biodiversity but also relative probabilities of persistence...|$|R

There is also a note on trade. Key findings 	Ensuring that the right public infrastructure projects are selected is more important than the question of how they will be financed. As such, the G 20 should designate appropriate project selection as the foundation stone of its infrastructure agenda. 	The MDBs can make a major contribution to reducing the global infrastructure gap, provided their actions begin with the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>additionality.</b> Private sector involvement is a desirable secondary goal and should be promoted wherever business finance produces a more efficient approach, but it should not supersede the MDBs’ preoccupation with an investment strategy built around value for money. 	Focusing on infrastructure investment for macroeconomic growth can, but does not automatically, benefit people living in extreme poverty, Australia needs to use its outreach program to talk to LICs about the possible prioritisation of infrastructure investment within the G 20 agenda. 	Australia’s G 20 presidency is a rare and time-bound opportunity to influence the process guiding tax reforms around base erosion and profit shifting. Better tax compliance and transparency will help to address poverty and inequality globally and within Asia and the Pacific. 	The G 20 has a number of energy issues on its work program, including energy efficiency, yet it has not adequately addressed the prior need for a revision of the global energy governance framework itself. The G 20 should push for an elevation of the International Energy Agency into a truly global forum that brings together all the major energy producers and consumers on equal basis...|$|E
40|$|The aim of EU Regional Policy is to {{intervene}} effectively in regions that “lag behind” {{in economic terms}} and to finance development programmes through the allocation of Structural Funds which operate {{in accordance with the}} <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> subsidiarity, <b>additionality</b> and partnership. This policy should allow regions to converge with EU averages in terms of income and employment. Italy and Spain provide very good examples within the EU as a whole, of significant economic disparities between regions that still appear to be present. We argue and provide substantial evidence {{of the fact that the}} persistence of such disparities is mainly due to inefficient administrative and institutional capacity at the regional level. Although some regions have brought themselves towards the average, in Italy and Spain, there is evidence that certain administrative, institutional and implementation problems have tended to appear, hampering the opportunities of regions to converge in the required way. Because of this, regional economic convergence and thereby socio-economic cohesion are still beyond reach. Two decades after the 1988 Reform of the Structural Funds, EU Regional Policy has only partially succeeded in reducing regional economic divergence within Italy and Spain, where regional economic inequalities still exist. Although we demonstrate that some regions have been able to move forward in the requisite way, it is questionable whether all of the support for these regions can actually be eliminated completely in the near future with the challenges that the EU faces, particularly in relation to the latest round of Enlargement...|$|R

An examination of the process of establishment, certification and verification <b>of</b> <b>additionality</b> (confirmation that emissions post-implementation of the CDM project are lower than those that would have occurred under the most plausible alternative scenario) is used to highlight the need for particular vigilance in respect to sustaining and improving the integrity of future market-based mechanisms post-Kyoto.

No specific recommendations are made below, but rather implications of various ways <b>of</b> applying <b>additionality</b> [...] some <b>of</b> them quite controversial are explored. The first section explains the importance <b>of</b> <b>additionality</b> and establishes conceptual definitions for financial and environmental additionality.
