40|$|Since {{the market}} for {{continuously}} variable transmissions (CVTs) is expanding rapidly and customer demands {{become more and more}} specific, there is an increasing need for adequate CVT fluids. In order to develop and apply new fluids, it is necessary to have reliable methods for fluid testing. However, test methods and standards that are being used nowadays for automatic transmission applications are not sufficient to select fluids for <b>push</b> <b>belt</b> CVT applications since they do not incorporate the belt-pulley behaviour. In this paper a method is described to test fluids on a belt-pulley level. The test method comprises full load testing in several ratios in which durability and functionality related <b>push</b> <b>belt</b> CVT items are being examined.

50|$|Dargan Frierson {{explains}} {{that in this}} process, the Northern Hemisphere receives more heat than the Southern because the overturning circulation brings more heat into the Northern Hemisphere {{as opposed to the}} Southern. He also states that as a result, the extra heat is transferred to the tropical regions in the Northern Hemisphere, causing warm ocean water to be situated in the northern tropics. This warm ocean water is what eventually generates rain and thunderstorms, and because there is more warm water in the northern tropics, {{it is obvious that the}} tropical rain belt is moving northward. Due to global climate change, the circulation of ocean currents and ocean temperatures might adjust in favor of <b>pushing</b> the <b>belt</b> further north into the region of oscillation.|$|R
40|$|Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT) {{offers a}} {{continuum}} of gear ratios between desired limits. This allows the engine to operate {{more time in the}} optimum range. In contrast, traditional automatic and manual transmissions have several fixed transmission ratios forcing the engine to operate outside the optimum range. The need for a transmission system and the working principle of CVT has been discussed in depth. An attempt has been made to understand the contribution of Hydraulic Actuators, which {{is an integral part of}} a CVT. Furthermore, the question of how and why a Torque Converter has effectively replaced a conventional clutch has been answered. The materials used, constructional aspects and stress analysis of the belt has been discussed in detail. A graphical comparison of fuel efficiency between a manual transmission and a CVT in different high end vehicles is included.

40|$|Developments in {{clamping}} force {{control for the}} <b>push</b> <b>belt</b> Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT) aim at increased efficiency in combination with improved robustness. Current control strategies attempt to prevent macro slip between elements and pulleys at all times for maximum robustness. In order {{to search for the}} limiting factors in developing a new control strategy, situations where macro slip occurs have been investigated. An important failure mechanism proves to be the occurrence of adhesive wear in the contact leading to a loss in torque transfer. As a combination of normal load and slip speed, respectively {{clamping force}} and slip rate in a variator, a transition can be found from a safe wear region to an excessive/adhesive wear region. The occurrence of this transition has been verified with experiments on CVT variator level. It turns out that macro slip is acceptable to a certain extent. The new wear insight allows fundamental different control strategies. In particular strategies based on CVT slip measurement and control are of interest. These control strategies enable lower clamping forces while retaining robustness. Consequently, CVT efficiency increases which will lead to an improvement in fuel consumption of approximately 5 %. 1...|$|E

50|$|More recently, treadmills are {{not used}} to harness power, but as {{exercise}} machines for running or walking in one place. Rather than the user powering the mill, the machine provides a moving platform with a wide conveyor belt driven by an electric motor or a flywheel. The belt moves to the rear, requiring the user to walk or run at a speed matching that of the belt. The rate at which the belt moves is the rate of walking or running. Thus, the speed of running may be controlled and measured. The more expensive, heavy-duty versions are motor-driven (usually by an electric motor). The simpler, lighter, and less expensive versions passively resist the motion, moving only when walkers <b>push</b> the <b>belt</b> with their feet. The latter are known as manual treadmills.|$|R

50|$|During the Lower Oligocene (Rupelian), a {{permanently}} {{marine environment}} persists {{in the south}} with marls and sands rich in nummulites, lamellibranchs, and echinids.

40|$|Cretaceous {{radiation}} of angiosperms {{from low}} to high palaeolatitudes, {{coupled with the}} break-up of Gondwana, {{played a major role}} in establishing and maintaining biogeographic patterns across the southern hemisphere. Uncertainties in details of plate reconstructions provide conflicting hypotheses about area relationships of Gondwana fragments. This has led to a number of competing proposals concerning angiosperm migration across Gondwana. Central to this debate is the role of the Antarctic Peninsula, a region that is often envisaged as providing the main connection between east and west Gondwana. The initial radiation of angiosperms into the Antarctic Peninsula region, however, postdates appearances elsewhere in east Gondwana (e. g. Australia), strongly suggesting that the Antarctic Peninsula was not the main gateway, at least in the early stages of Gondwana radiation. A steep climatic gradient in this part of the world probably acted as an effective barrier to angiosperm radiation. The peak of floristic replacement coincides with the peak of Cretaceous warmth (Turonian) which in turn suggests that climatic warming acted as a forcing mechanism by <b>pushing</b> latitudinal <b>belts</b> of vegetation southwards. Once into the southern high latitudes angiosperms diversified, and as climates cooled during the Late Cretaceous a number of important groups seem to have their origins here. Recent investigations of Antarctic macro- and microfloras indicate progressive floristic replacement through the Cretaceous. Bryophytes, hepatophytes, bennettites and other seed plants all show a rapid decline in diversity. In contrast, ferns initially decline then recover, while conifers remain relatively stable. The ecological preferences of the replaced groups imply that angiosperms initially occupied areas of disturbance and were understorey colonizers, only later replacing fern thickets and becoming important in the overstorey. This pattern is consistent with those observed elsewhere through the Cretaceous...|$|R
50|$|In {{a general}} way, Wittmann, {{a student of}} André Martinet in the fifties, has {{been the first to}} apply the latter's {{principles}} of chain reactions in phonology to inflectional morphology. In Wittmann's view, the basic structure of the sentence is held together by functional items, with the lexical items filling in the blanks. Position in functional space must maintain functional equidistance and disturbances in functional equidistance set off error correcting chain reactions that are cyclical in nature and subject to drift. Thus, functionally salient lexical items will eventually set off a <b>push</b> chain conveyor <b>belt</b> pressure in functional space, sending functionally close-by affixes down the path of attrition. Such is the origin of agglutinating clitics of non-standard oral French from erstwhile lexical pronouns, setting off the attrition of functionally equivalent fusional means of inflection inherited from Old French and Latin: Loss of suffixal inflection on the verb, compensated by the rise of proclitic means indicating person, number and tense. Conversely, functional items going down the path of attrition leave behind functional gaps, triggering a drag chain effect on surrounding functionally salient lexical items. Such is the origin of the agglutinating prenominal class markers from erstwhile articles, compensated by the rise of postnominal means of expressing definiteness on the noun. With the fulfilment of each cycle of change, a morphologically consistent phonological representation is realized which serves as input to the next cycle of morphological change. The aforementioned processes of inflectional renewal are not without parallels in recent neurolinguistic research, notably in the works by Gabriele Miceli.|$|R
40|$|In {{the past}} few decades, China’s {{tremendous}} economic and social development, {{and the lack of}} environmental regulation, has made environmental quality a serious concern. Now {{the government is going to}} develop western China and <b>pushes</b> the ’One <b>Belt</b> One Road’ multibillion-dollar infrastructure project. In the context of environmental degradation and China's new push for an "ecological civilization" in the “new normal”, to estimate the environmental cost of economic development in China is very important. A rich literature that examines the effect of economic growth on air quality degradation suggests that there is an inverted-U shaped relationship between the two. However, most of the previous studies of this relationship concentrate on finding the “turning point” of the inverted-U and do not focus on quantifying the impact of economic growth and industrial activities on environmental quality. Neither do they address the potential of an endogenous problem in the relationship. This study estimates the impact that economic growth and industrial activities had on China’s air quality from 2000 to 2012, and it predicts the future impact of economic growth in western China. To deal with the potential of endogeneity, this study constructs instrumental variables (IV) for GDP and industrial output by using the GDP of trading partner countries. With data from 118 Chinese cities, this study identifies the impact of economic growth and industrial output on air quality in China and similar developing areas. The results suggest a quadratic relationship between economic growth and air quality degradation. The estimated marginal impact is stronger than in most previous studies: a 10 % increase in secondary industry GDP is associated with a 5 % increase in air pollutant concentrations, on average. This impact is largely driven by pollution-intensive industries in the secondary sector...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new methodology {{for studying the}} evolution of curved mountain belts by means of paleomagnetic analyses performed on analogue models. Eleven models were designed aimed at reproducing various tectonic settings in thin-skinned tectonics. Our models analyze in particular those features {{reported in the literature}} as possible causes for peculiar rotational patterns in the outermost {{as well as in the}} more internal fronts. In all the models the sedimentary cover was reproduced by frictional low-cohesion materials (sand and glass micro-beads), which detached either on frictional or on viscous layers. These latter were reproduced in the models by silicone. The sand forming the models has been previously mixed with magnetite-dominated powder. Before deformation, the models were magnetized by means of two permanent magnets generating within each model a quasi-linear magnetic field of intensity variable between 20 and 100 mT. After deformation, the models were cut into closely spaced vertical sections and sampled by means of 1 x 1 -cm Plexiglas cylinders at several locations along curved fronts. Care was taken to collect paleomagnetic samples only within virtually undeformed thrust sheets, avoiding zones affected by pervasive shear. Afterwards, the natural remanent magnetization of these samples was measured, and alternating field demagnetization was used to isolate the principal components. The characteristic components of magnetization isolated were used to estimate the vertical-axis rotations occurring during model deformation. We find that indenters <b>pushing</b> into deforming <b>belts</b> from behind form non-rotational curved outer fronts. The more internal fronts show oroclinal-type rotations of a smaller magnitude than that expected for a perfect orocline. Lateral symmetrical obstacles in the foreland colliding with forward propagating belts produce non-rotational outer curved fronts as well, whereas in between and inside the obstacles a perfect orocline forms only when the ratio between obstacles’ distance and thickness of the cover is greater than 10. Finally, when a belt collides with an obstacle in the foreland oblique to the shortening direction the outer front displays rotations opposite in sign to oroclinal-type rotations, whereas the internal fronts seem to assume an "oroclinal type" rotational pattern. Furthermore rotation is easier in laterally unconfined models, i. e. when the wedge can "escape" laterally. The results from our models may be useful when compared to paleomagnetic rotations detected in natural arcs. In these cases, our results may allow for better understanding the tectonic setting controlling the genesis of curved mountain fronts, as is the case of the Gela Nappe of Sicily we compare with some of our models...|$|R
