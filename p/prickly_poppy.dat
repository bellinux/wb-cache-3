40|$|Problem statement: The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to investigate the effect of using <b>Prickly</b> <b>poppy</b> methyl ester as a fuel blend on Diesel engine (CI engine) performance and exhaust emission. Approach: Short-term engine performance tests were conducted to evaluate and compare the use of various diesel fuel supplements at blend rations of 60 / 40, 70 / 30, 80 / 20, 90 / 10, in a standard, fully instrumented, four stroke, Direct Injection (DI), Kirlosker comet Diesel engine located at the authors laboratory. The <b>prickly</b> <b>poppy</b> oil with high free fatty acid is not used as edible oil, it can be considered as a potential source of non edible oil for utilization as a feed stock vegetable oil for bio diesel production. The <b>prickly</b> <b>poppy</b> oil was subjected to esterification and transesterification processes and the <b>Prickly</b> <b>Poppy</b> Methyl Ester (PPME) obtained was tested as supplement. Results: The test showed that PPME blends with diesel could be conveniently used as a diesel substitute in a diesel engine. The test further showed increase in break thermal efficiency, brake power and reduction of specific fuel consumption for PPME and its blends with diesel generally, but the most significant conclusion from the study is that the 80 % Diesel/ 20 % PPME blend produced maximum values of the brake power, brake thermal efficiency and minimum values of the specific fuel consumption and also yielded minimum values of NOx, CO and HC emission. Conclusion: Using <b>Prickly</b> <b>Poppy</b> Methyl Ester (PPME) as a bio fuel blend with Diesel shows an improvement in performance and significant reduction in exhaust emission for the generation of cleaner environment...|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{determine}} the antimoraxella activity of Ethiopian medicinal plants extracts. MethodsTwo clinical isolates of Moraxella cattarhalis (M. cattarhalis) with different antibiotic sensitivity pattern were tested to {{determine the}}ir susceptibility to garlic [Allium sativum (A. sativum) ], bark of cinnamon [Cinnamomum zeylanicum (C. zeylanicum) ], clove [Syzygium aromaticum (S. aromaticum) ], and leaves of avocado [Persea americana (P. americana) ], rosemary [Rosmarinus officinalis (R. officinalis) ] and <b>prickly</b> <b>poppy</b> [Argemone mexicana (A. mexicana) ]. Disk diffusion assay and broth dilution method were used to measure zone of inhibition, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of plant extracts against M. cattarhalis. ResultsBoth the strains of M. cattarhalis exhibited similar sensitivities to the extracts of medicinal plants. Antimoraxella activity was exhibited only by garlic, avocado leaves and cinnamon. Garlic {{was found to be}} more antagonistic to M. cattarhalis than cinnamon and avocado. Garlic and avocado leaves have shown similar MIC (30 mg/mL) where as their zone of inhibition (15 and 11 mm, respectively) were different. ConclusionsGarlic, cinnamon and avocado leaves extracts represents alternative source of natural antimicrobial substances for use in clinical practice for the treatment of cases of M. cattarhalis.

40|$|Plant {{ontogeny}} is {{a common}} source of variation in defense and herbivory. Yet, few studies have investigated how the induction of physical defense traits changes across plant ontogeny. Physical defense traits are costly to produce, and thus, {{it was predicted that}} induction as a cost-saving strategy would be particularly favorable for seedlings, leading to ontogenetic declines in the inducibility of these traits. We tested for induction of three different physical defense traits (prickles, latex and leaf toughness) in response to mechanical defoliation and jasmonic acid application using prickly poppies (Argemone glauca and A. mexicana, Papaveraceae) as a model system. Genetic variation in the induction of physical defenses was tested using maternal sib-ships sampled from multiple populations. Both species induced higher densities of laminar prickles, although the magnitude of induction was much higher in the endemic Hawaiian <b>prickly</b> <b>poppy,</b> A. glauca, than in the cosmopolitan A. mexicana. The magnitude of prickle induction was also higher in young compared to older juvenile plant stages in A. glauca, demonstrating a strong role of ontogeny. Neither latex exudation nor leaf toughness was induced in either species. Although significant genetic variation was detected within and among populations for constitutive expression of physical defense traits in Argemone, there was no evidence for genetic variation in the induction of these traits. This study provides the first evidence for the induction of physical defenses in prickly poppies, emphasizing how an ontogenetically explicit framework can reveal new insights into plant defense. Moreover, this study illustrates how siste...|$|E
