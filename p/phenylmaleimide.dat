40|$|The {{effects of}} {{chemical}} modifications of myosin's reactive cysteines on actomyosin adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) activities and sliding velocities {{in the in}} vitro motility assays were examined in this work. The three types of modifications studied were 4 -[N-[(iodoacetoxy) ethyl]-N-methylamino]- 7 -nitrobenz- 2 -oxa- 1, 3 - diazole labeling of SH 2 (based on Ajtai and Burghart. 1989. Biochemistry. 28 : 2204 - 2210.), <b>phenylmaleimide</b> labeling of SH 1, and <b>phenylmaleimide</b> labeling of myosin in myofibrils under rigor conditions. Each type of modified myosin inhibited the sliding of actin in motility assays. The sliding velocities of actin over copolymers of modified and unmodified myosins in the motility assay were slowest with rigor-modified myosin and most rapid with SH 2 -labeled myosin. The actin-activated ATPase activities of similarly copolymerized myosins were lowest with SH 2 -labeled myosin and highest with rigor-modified myosin. The actin-activated ATPase activities of myosin subfragment- 1 obtained from these modified myosins decreased in the same linear manner with the fraction of modified heads. These results are interpreted using a model in which the sliding of actin filaments over myosin filaments decreases the probability of myosin activation by actin. The sliding velocity of actin over monomeric rigor-modified myosin exceeded that over the filamentous form, which suggests for this myosin that filament structure {{is important for the}} inhibition of actin sliding in motility assays. The fact that all cysteine modifications examined inhibited the actomyosin ATPase activities and sliding velocities of actin over myosin poses questions concerning the information about the activated crossbridge obtained from probes attached to SH 1 or SH 2 on myosin...|$|E
40|$|Proline {{may work}} {{efficiently}} in water as catalyst of aldol reactions {{if it is}} hydrophobically activated. In this work, we have maximized this hydrophobic activation by the preparation of linear alternating copolymers of hydrophobic <b>phenylmaleimide</b> and a vinylpyrrolidone derivative bearing proline. These copolymers were water soluble above pH 5. 0 and, unlike the free proline, exhibited efficient catalysis at pH 7. 0. Moreover, they catalyzed and presented enantioselectivity in an aggregated form at pH 4. 0 (close to the isoelectric point, IEP, of the polymer). This enantioselectivity has been related {{to the exclusion of}} water at this IEP. To control the size and stabilize the aggregates, PEG grafted copolymers were prepared by the incorporation of a PEG-macromer (2 – 10 mol...|$|E
40|$|Fluorinated polymaleimides {{with high}} thermal {{stability}} and low optical absorption {{loss in the}} optical communi-cation wavelength of 1. 55 µm were investigated for application in low-loss waveguide materials. The fluorinated polymaleimides were prepared from two monomers <b>phenylmaleimide</b> (H-PMI) and pentafluorophenylmaleimide (F-PMI). All synthesized copolymers had high thermal stability (decomposition temperature (Td) = 380 - 430 °C). The refractive index of the copolymers could be tuned from 1. 4969 to 1. 5950 in the TE mode and from 1. 4993 to 1. 5932 for the TM mode at 632. 8 nm by copolymerizing different weight ratios of H-PMI and F-PMI. The refractive index of the copolymers decreased with increasing F-PMI content. In addition, when the amount of F-PMI was increased, optical loss and absorption loss at 632. 8 nm and 1550 nm, respectively, decreased...|$|E
40|$|In this work, a {{group of}} {{thermally}} stable polar-embedded polymer based stationary phases are presented. The silane-based copolymer is synthesized by radical polymerization to incorporate polar groups, through <b>phenylmaleimides,</b> and alkoxysilane groups. By way of the alkoxysilane groups, the copolymer can be attached on to silica particles or converted to polymer-silica composite particles using tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) as a sol-gel precursor. Through characterizations in this work, they proved to be stable in high temperatures (400 °C) as well as effective in high water mobile phases. Phenyl moieties of the material provide increased and sometimes excessive retention of analytes with pi-systems occurred {{in many of the}} separations. By manipulating the functional groups add to the maleimide, chemical selectivity can be controlled by the difference in polarity. With the halogen-modified maleimides, peak shape was improved in the basic solutes in the reduction of band fronting and tailing. Also, increasing the column temperatures reduced band broadening as well as decreasing retention of the most retained peaks. Results lead to the conclusion that these polar-embedded stationary phases would be of good use in subcritical water chromatography. ...|$|R
40|$|Main chain thermotropic {{liquid crystal}} esters, ester-imides, and ester-amides were {{prepared}} from AA, BB, and AB type monomeric materials and end-capped with phenylacetylene, <b>phenylmaleimide,</b> or nadimide reactive end-groups. The end-capped liquid crystal oligomers are thermotropic and have, preferably, molecular weights {{in the range}} of approximately 1000 - 15, 000 grams per mole. The end-capped liquid crystaloligomers have broad liquid crystalline melting ranges and exhibit high melt stability and very low melt viscosities at accessible temperatures. The end-capped liquid crystal oli-gomers are stable forup to an hour in the melt phase. They are highly processable by a variety of melt process shape forming and blending techniques. Once processed and shaped, the end-capped liquid crystal oigomers were heated to further polymerize and form liquid crystalline thermosets (LCT). The fully cured products are rubbers above their glass transition temperatures...|$|E
40|$|Alternating {{copolymers}} of beta-alkoxystyrenes (I) and N <b>phenylmaleimide</b> (NPMI) {{were prepared}} by free-radical initiated polymerization in bulk or in toluene as solvent. The equilibrium constants of I (R = Et and sec-Bu) and NPMI {{were determined by}} the transformed Benessi-Hildebrand NMR method in CDC 13, and {{it was found that}} the bulkiness of alkyl group has no significant influence on the equilibrium constants. The rate of copolymerization, howe ver, was largely dependent on the bulkiness of alkyl group, and rate constants decreased by increasing the size of alkyl group. It was further found that the weight loss in the thermo-gravimetric analysis increases by the increase of bulkiness of alkyl group in e 1 ectron donor monomer. The linear correlation between the logarithm of rate constants of kM, over k:« against Taft-Hancock steric constants and the parallelism between weightlos s values in thermograms and steric factors of respective alkyl groups indicate that the rate of copolymerization and thermal degradation are sterically controlled processes...|$|E
40|$|Incubation {{of maize}} (Zea mays) leaf NADP-malic enzyme with monofunctional and bifunctional N-substituted maleimides {{results in an}} {{irreversible}} inactivation of the enzyme. Inactivation by the monofunctional reagents, N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) and N-phenylmaleimide, followed pseudo-first-order kinetics. The maximum inactivation rate constant for <b>phenylmaleimide</b> was 10 -fold higher than that for NEM, suggesting a possible hydrophobic microenvironment of the residue(s) involved in the modification of the enzyme. In contrast, the inactivation kinetics with the bifunctional maleimides, ortho-, meta-, and para-phenylenebismaleimide, were biphasic, probably due to different reactivities of the groups reacting with the two heads of these bifunctional reagents, with a possible cross-linking of two sulfhydryl groups. The inactivation by mono and bifunctional maleimides was partially prevented by Mg 2 + and l-malate, and NADP prevented the inactivation almost totally. Determination {{of the number of}} reactive sulfhydryl groups of the native enzyme with [3 H]NEM in the absence or presence of NADP showed that inactivation occurred concomitantly with the modification of two cysteinyl residues per enzyme monomer. The presence of these two essential residues was confirmed by titration of sulfhydryl groups with [3 H]NEM in the enzyme previously modified by o-phenylenebismaleimide in the absence or presence of NADP...|$|E
