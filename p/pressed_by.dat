5|$|In 1309, the Burgundian noble Walter of Brienne was {{selected}} as the Duke of Athens in Frankish Greece after the death of Guy II de la Roche. At that time the Greek world was in turmoil owing to the actions of the Catalan Company. These were a group of mercenaries, veterans of the War of the Sicilian Vespers, originally hired by the Byzantine Empire against the Turks in Asia Minor. Soon, however, mutual suspicion and quarrels brought about an open conflict; evicted from their base in Gallipoli in 1307, the Catalans marched west through Thrace and Macedonia, until, <b>pressed</b> <b>by</b> Byzantine troops under Chandrenos, they entered Thessaly in early 1309.|$|E

The True Finns and the Green League have both confirmed that the two parties are ideologically too far from each other to sit in the same coalition. The True Finns' main campaign issues—lowering refugee quotas and cutting foreign aid and Finland's financial contribution to the EU—were seen as a possible hindrance to coalition talks.|$|E
5|$|Organ stops can be {{combined}} in countless permutations, resulting in {{a great variety of}} sounds. A combination action can be used to switch instantly from one combination of stops (called a registration) to another. Combination actions feature small buttons called pistons that can be <b>pressed</b> <b>by</b> the organist, generally located beneath the keys of each manual (thumb pistons) or above the pedalboard (toe pistons). The pistons may be divisional (affecting only a single division) or general (affecting all the divisions), and are either preset by the organ builder or can be altered by the organist. Modern combination actions operate via computer memory, and can store several channels of registrations.|$|E
5|$|When {{parliament}} {{passed the}} building of the Bergen Line in 1894, the Roa–Hønefoss branch line was made part of the plans; but the line was given a separate name indicating that the Bergen Line would continue from Hønefoss to Oslo in a more direct route. But after the finish of the Bergen Line, other important mainline routes, in particular the Dovre Line, Sørland Line and Nordland Line, combined with the effort to convert narrow gauge line, took precedence. Ideas for the additional construction of the Ringerike Line were <b>pressed</b> <b>by</b> commercial interests in Ringerike in both 1890 and 1906, but failed both times.|$|E

5|$|In November, Silahdar Yusuf Pasha {{left behind}} a strong {{garrison}} and returned to Constantinople for the winter. There however, he fell foul of the Sultan and was executed. Nevertheless, Ottoman preparations continued in order to renew and expand the war, while the Venetians were frantically trying to raise money and men, and attempting to induce other European powers to join them against the Ottomans. However, as most of Europe was locked into the fierce antagonisms of the Thirty Years' War, their pleas fell mostly on deaf ears. The Venetians were hard <b>pressed</b> <b>by</b> the financial demands of the war: besides placing taxes on the Italian mainland possessions (the Terraferma), they resorted to the sale of nobility titles and state offices to fill their war coffer. To lead the effort against the Ottomans, the Senate initially appointed the 80-year-old doge Francesco Erizzo, but {{after his death in}} early 1646, he was replaced by the 73-year old Giovanni Cappello as Captain General of the Sea.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the encirclement of the 6th Army on 23 November 1942, the Geschwaderstab was moved to Morozovskaya-West, outside the Stalingrad pocket. Wilcke organized fighter escort missions for the transport aircraft delivering supplies for the 6th Army. <b>Pressed</b> <b>by</b> the advancing Soviet armored spearheads, Morozovskaya-West had to be abandoned by the Geschwaderstab on 23 December, and the aircraft were moved to Morozovskaya-South, which was not yet threatened by the Soviet Army. On 3 January 1943, this airfield had to be abandoned as well and the Geschwaderstab was relocated to Tazinskaya, there it remained until the fighting over the Stalingrad pocket ended. During this period the Geschwaderstab claimed 25 victories, 21 by Wilcke and 4 by Dahl, for the loss in action of two pilots.|$|E
5|$|<b>Pressed</b> <b>by</b> the French and Bavarians to {{the west}} and Hungarian rebels to the east, Austria faced the real {{possibility}} of being forced out of the war. Concerns over Vienna and the situation in southern Germany convinced Marlborough of the necessity of sending aid to the Danube; but the scheme of seizing the initiative from the enemy was extremely bold. From the start the Duke resolved to mislead the Dutch, who would never willingly permit any major weakening of Allied forces in the Spanish Netherlands. To this end, Marlborough moved his English troops to the Moselle (a plan approved of by The Hague), but once there he planned to slip the Dutch leash and march south to link up with Austrian forces in southern Germany.|$|E

5|$|Proposals for {{electrification}} of the Meråker Line {{have been}} made since the 1940s. By then the Swedish side had been electrified. This was initially desired also by NSB {{in an effort to}} cut the high operating costs of steam trains. However, lines with higher traffic received priority. By 1971 the last steam trains were retired and issue of electrification for marginal lines were shelved. The issue was <b>pressed</b> <b>by</b> regional bodies from 1978 and 1992, and then again from the 2000s. This time the issue was successful and in 2013 the Parliament of Norway approved the electrification of the Meråker Line and the section from Trondheim to Steinkjer. The plan is to start the physical construction in 2017 and finish by 2022.|$|E
5|$|Richard White as Gaston – A vain {{hunter who}} vies for Belle's hand in {{marriage}} and is {{determined not to}} let anyone else win her heart. He serves as a foil personality to the Beast, who was once as egotistic as Gaston prior to his transformation. Gaston's supervising animator, Andreas Deja, was <b>pressed</b> <b>by</b> Jeffrey Katzenberg to make Gaston handsome in contrast to the traditional appearance of a Disney villain, an assignment he found difficult at first. In the beginning, Gaston is depicted as more of a narcissist than a villain, but later he leads all the villagers to kill the beast, enraged that Belle would love a Beast more than him.|$|E
5|$|The tribes traded freely, {{and soon}} many had {{acquired}} French guns, while others had traded for Spanish horses. Tribes {{without access to}} either resource were left at a disadvantage. The Lipan Apache, who had been seasonal farmers, were soon <b>pressed</b> <b>by</b> the Comanche, who had horses, and the Wichita, who had guns. The Apaches were bitter enemies of the Tejas of East Texas and had transferred their enmity to the Spanish as friends of the Tejas. After discovering San Antonio in 1720, the Apache began repeatedly raiding the area to steal livestock, especially horses. An average of 3Spaniards died each year in Texas {{as a result of}} Apache attacks, with approximately 100animals taken each year. In retaliation, the Spanish launched multiple attacks on the Apaches, capturing horses and mules, hides and other plunder, and taking Apache captives, whom the Spanish used as household servants. By 1731, however, the San Antonio garrison was begging the government for help in negotiating a peace with the tribes.|$|E

5|$|Two {{days after}} her defeat in the Derby, La Fleche ran against fillies in the Oaks. Although some {{regarded}} her as a certainty, her odds drifted from 2/5 to 8/11 before the start. In the race she tracked the leader Broad Corrie before taking {{the lead in the}} straight apparently poised for an easy victory. In the final furlong however, she was closely <b>pressed</b> <b>by</b> The Smew, a filly she had dealt with easily in the 1000 Guineas, and Barrett had to ride a vigorous finish to win the race by a short head. On 29 July at Goodwood, La Fleche won the Nassau Stakes in which, despite looking less than fully fit, she quickened impressively to bear Broad Corrie by a length and a half.|$|E
5|$|When Borah went to Washington for the Senate's regular {{session in}} December 1907, he was {{immediately}} {{a figure of}} note, {{not only for the}} dramatic events in Idaho, but for keeping his Western habits, including wearing a ten-gallon hat. It was then the custom that junior senators wait perhaps a year before giving their maiden speech, but at Roosevelt's request, in April 1908, Borah spoke in defense of the president's dismissal of over a hundred African American soldiers in the Brownsville Affair, their cause <b>pressed</b> <b>by</b> the fiery Ohio senator, Joseph B. Foraker. The soldiers were supposed to have shot up a Texas town, and Borah stated that their alleged actions were as wrongful as the murder of Steunenberg. The accusations were later deemed to be motivated by racism, and in 1972, long after the deaths of Roosevelt, Borah, and most of the soldiers, the dismissals were reversed.|$|E
5|$|With the {{infantry}} heavily engaged, Eugene's cavalry picked {{its way across}} the Nebel. After an initial success, his first line of cavalry, under the Imperial General of Horse, Prince Maximilian of Hanover, were <b>pressed</b> <b>by</b> the second line of Marsin's cavalry, and were forced back across the Nebel in confusion. Nevertheless, the exhausted French were unable to follow up their advantage, and the two cavalry forces tried to regroup and reorder their ranks. However, without cavalry support, and threatened with envelopment, the Prussian and Danish infantry were in turn forced to pull back across the Nebel. Panic gripped some of Eugene's troops as they crossed the stream. Ten infantry colours were lost to the Bavarians, and hundreds of prisoners taken; it was only through the leadership of Eugene and the Prussian Prince that the imperial infantry were prevented from abandoning the field.|$|E
