5|$|The Malé Friday Mosque is {{oriented}} west. Its prayer carpet is angled {{towards the}} mosque's northwest corner, so worshippers can face Mecca while they pray. Devotees enter the mosque from the Islamic Centre, climbing several marble steps {{leading to the}} mosque balcony. The prayer hall below has a burgundy-coloured carpet, <b>patterned</b> <b>with</b> images resembling hot-water bottles which demarcate spaces for the believers offering prayers. The carpet can accommodate 1,372 people if each devotee occupies one space. The mosque has a reported capacity of 10,700 for Friday prayers.|$|E
5|$|The two lions have a male mane, <b>patterned</b> <b>with</b> dense, short lines; the manes {{continue}} {{beneath the}} body. Distinctly patterned tufts of hair grow from the lion's ears {{and on their}} shoulders, emanating from a central disk-shaped whorl. They lie prone, their heads are sculpted with attention to detail, but {{with a degree of}} artistic liberty in their form, e.g., regarding their rounded shapes. Both lions look towards the viewer, and both have their mouths closed.|$|E
50|$|The {{result is}} that if the gap is very narrow only {{diffraction}} <b>patterns</b> <b>with</b> bright centers can occur. If the gap is made progressively wider, then diffraction <b>patterns</b> <b>with</b> dark centers will alternate <b>with</b> diffraction <b>patterns</b> <b>with</b> bright centers. As the gap becomes larger, the differentials between dark and light bands decrease until a diffraction effect can no longer be detected.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Electrical stimulation-induced leg cycling (ES-LC) is {{beneficial}} {{for individuals with}} spinal cord injury (SCI), but cycling performance is often limited because of rapid fatigue of the stimulated muscles. This study evaluated whether a stimulation <b>pattern</b> <b>with</b> a catchlike-inducing pulse train increased force production and hence cycling performance. Five men with SCI performed ES-LC using different stimula-tion patterns: (1) the standard <b>pattern</b> <b>with</b> ramp modulation, (2) a <b>pattern</b> <b>with</b> no ramp modulation, (3) a <b>pattern</b> <b>with</b> no ramp modulation but with an initial doublet, and (4) a <b>pattern</b> <b>with</b> a middle doublet.

Greenstone was fashioned into earrings and necklaces, with the most well-known design being the hei-tiki, a distorted human figure sitting cross-legged with its head tilted to the side. Europeans brought English fashion etiquette to New Zealand, and until the 1950s most people dressed up for social occasions. Standards have since relaxed and New Zealand fashion has received {{a reputation for being}} casual, practical and lacklustre. However, the local fashion industry has grown significantly since 2000, doubling exports and increasing from a handful to about 50 established labels, with some labels gaining international recognition.|$|E
5|$|The Bohemian waxwing (Bombycilla garrulus) is a starling-sized {{passerine}} {{bird that}} breeds {{in the northern}} forests of Eurasia and North America. It has mainly buff-grey plumage, black face markings and a pointed crest. Its wings are <b>patterned</b> <b>with</b> white and bright yellow, and some feather tips have the red waxy appearance that give this species its English name. The three subspecies show only minor differences in appearance. Females are similar to males, although young birds are less well-marked and have few or no waxy wingtips. Although the Bohemian waxwing's range overlaps those of the cedar and Japanese waxwings, it is easily distinguished from them by size and plumage differences.|$|E
5|$|The plumage of antbirds is {{soft and}} not brightly coloured, {{although}} it is occasionally striking. The colour palette of most species is blackish shades, whitish shades, rufous, chestnut and brown. Plumages can be uniform in colour or <b>patterned</b> <b>with</b> barring or spots. Sexual dimorphism – differences in plumage colour and pattern {{between males and females}} – is common in the family. Overall the pattern within the family is for the males to have combinations of grey, black or white plumage and the females having buff, rufous and brown colours. For example, the male dot-winged antwren is primarily blackish, whereas the female has rust-coloured underparts. In some genera, such as Myrmotherula, species are better distinguished by female plumage than by male. Many species of antbirds have a contrasting 'patch' of white (sometimes other colours) feathers on the back (known as interscapular patches), shoulder or underwing. This is usually concealed by the darker feathers on the back but when the bird is excited or alarmed these feathers can be raised to flash the white patch. dot-winged antwrens puff out white back patches, whereas in bluish-slate antshrikes and white-flanked antwrens the white patch is on the shoulder.|$|E

They could be painted or stencilled with designs and are sometimes mould-cast or have impressed motifs. They were systematically replaced one by one when more elaborate windows were donated. These windows generally date from 1830 to 1860. Powell was a major supplier of impressed and stencilled quarries.|$|E

She found that lesbian speakers were judged as sounding more lesbian than straight speakers. Bisexual speakers <b>patterned</b> <b>with</b> lesbians, although there was a slight difference between them which was near statistical significance. Listeners in this experiment also ranked speakers on a scale from masculine to feminine. They perceived the straight speakers as significantly more feminine than the lesbian speakers, and the bisexual speakers as slightly more feminine.|$|E
25|$|Cricket caps are usually, but {{not always}} multi-coloured in the colours of the cricket club or school for which the cap is {{designed}} to represent. Sometimes they are particularly elaborately <b>patterned</b> <b>with</b> different sections in different colours, or different coloured rings or hoops around them. At international level, the cap is traditionally made from a single colour. However, {{in recent years in}} particular, many cricket teams, particularly for limited overs cricket have opted to wear baseball caps, rather than traditional cricket caps, but the style is still quite popular for first-class cricket teams, as well as Test cricket sides.|$|E

In the style of Provençal gardens of the 18th century, there is a maze with sculpted hedges. Further on, Islamic gardens are featured, with an orange grove where the ground is <b>patterned</b> <b>with</b> terracotta irrigation pipes similar to those in the celebrated Seville Cathedral in Spain. The vegetable gardens and orchards in the Arsat are planted in hollows as in Morocco to protect them from the sun and maximise shadow and humidity. A representation of a Moroccan house pays homage to the painter Majorelle, creator of the blue garden in Marrakesh. In another area, the winter garden contains plants that flower in winter, such as mimosa and camellias.|$|E
25|$|Galeus is a genus of catshark, {{belonging}} to the family Scyliorhinidae, commonly known as sawtail catsharks in reference to a distinctive saw-toothed crest of enlarged dermal denticles, found along the upper edges of their caudal fins. They {{are found in the}} Atlantic, the western and central Pacific, and the Gulf of California, inhabiting deep waters at or close to the sea floor. Members of this genus are rather small, slim sharks with firm bodies and thick, rough skin. Their heads are usually fairly long and pointed, and have large mouths with well-developed furrows at the corners. They have large pectoral and anal fins, and two similar dorsal fins placed well back. Many species are ornately <b>patterned</b> <b>with</b> dark saddles and/or blotches. Sawtail catsharks feed on various invertebrates and fishes, and may be either egg-laying or live-bearing. These harmless sharks are sometimes caught as bycatch but are of minimal commercial value.|$|E
25|$|Velvet worms are {{segmented}} {{animals with}} a flattened cylindrical body cross-section {{and rows of}} unstructured body appendages known as oncopods or lobopods (informally: stub feet). The animals grow to between 0.5 and 20cm (.2 to 8in), with the average being about 5cm (2 in), and have between 13 and 43 pairs of legs. Their skin consists of numerous, fine transverse rings and is often inconspicuously coloured orange, red or brown, but sometimes also bright green, blue, gold or white, and occasionally <b>patterned</b> <b>with</b> other colours. Segmentation is outwardly inconspicuous, and identifiable by the regular spacing of the pairs of legs and in the regular arrangement of skin s, excretion organs and concentrations of nerve cells. The individual body sections are largely unspecialised; even the head develops only a little differently from the abdominal segments. Segmentation is apparently specified by the same gene as in other groups of animals, and is activated in each case, during embryonic development, at the rear border of each segment and in the growth zone of the stub feet. Although onychophorans fall within the protostome group, their early development has a deuterostome trajectory, (with the mouth and anus forming separately); this trajectory is concealed by the rather sophisticated processes which occur in early development.|$|E
