25|$|The Pegasus was {{produced}} in many variants, early prototype engines were unsupercharged but the majority used a geared supercharger, either single-speed or two-speed. Variant differences included compression ratios, <b>propeller</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>gear</b> ratios and accessories.|$|E
25|$|The first engine later {{received}} an epicyclic <b>propeller</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>gear</b> made by Allison, {{an increase in}} its compression ratio, a Scintilla magneto ignition, and the new design cylinder banks of the 3A-1500 inverted engines, a design that had both spark plugs on the outside for easier maintenance.|$|E
25|$|Bell Model 26N, {{originally}} {{part of the}} P-39G order. V-1710-85 (E19) (1,325hp/988kW) engine. Aeroproducts propeller (10ft 4in diameter) & different <b>propeller</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>gear</b> ratio. Starting {{with the}} 167th aircraft, propeller increased to 11ft 7in & internal fuel reduced from 120gal (454l) to 87gal (329l); 500 built.|$|E
5000|$|... at 2,700 RPM up to 9500 ft, [...] at 2,850 RPM for takeoff Experimental high-powered {{version with}} <b>propeller</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>gearing.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Wright {{brothers}} recognised {{the need}} for <b>propeller</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>gearing</b> in 1903, {{but it was not}} generally used on aircraft engines until larger engines were designed in the 1920s. Large engines with high crankshaft speeds and power outputs demanded <b>propeller</b> <b>reduction,</b> pilots noted the increase in performance of similar aircraft fitted with <b>reduction</b> <b>gearing.</b>|$|R
50|$|The P-39, P-63, and Douglas XB-42 Mixmaster used V-1710-Es, exchanging the {{integral}} <b>reduction</b> <b>gear</b> for an extension shaft driving a remotely located <b>reduction</b> <b>gear</b> and <b>propeller.</b> Aircraft {{such as the}} P-38, P-40, P-51A, and North American P-82E used close-coupled <b>propeller</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>gears,</b> {{a feature of the}} V-1710-F series.|$|R
25|$|The Cheetah was {{developed}} from the earlier Lynx using the increased bore cylinders from the Armstrong Siddeley Panther but the engine retained the stroke of the Lynx. Initially only direct-drive variants were produced with later engines being made available with <b>propeller</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>gear</b> of various ratios. Superchargers were also available for later variants, both geared and directly driven by the crankshaft.|$|E
25|$|A {{design feature}} of the Peregrine {{was that it was}} {{produced}} in both right- and left-hand tractor variants. This was done to improve aircraft handling by providing a counter-rotating propeller facility. This was a common feature of German designs, but relatively rare on UK engines. The handing of internal parts to achieve this was a considerable complication that was later abandoned in favour of an idler gear arrangement for the Merlin <b>propeller</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>gear.</b>|$|E
500|$|The R was a {{physically}} imposing engine {{designed by a}} team led by Ernest Hives and including Cyril Lovesey, Arthur Rowledge and Henry Royce. The R shared the Buzzard's bore, stroke and capacity, and used the same 60-degree V-12 layout. A new single-stage, double-sided supercharger impeller was designed along with revised cylinders and strengthened connecting rods. The wet-liner cylinder blocks, crankcase and <b>propeller</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>gear</b> castings were produced from [...] "R.R 50" [...] aluminium alloy; and because of the short life expectancy of these engines, forged aluminium was used to replace bronze and steel in many parts.|$|E
50|$|The Rolls-Royce Falcon {{engine of}} 1915 {{featured}} epicyclic <b>propeller</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>gearing</b> which contained a clutch designed {{to limit the}} maximum torque, thus protecting the <b>reduction</b> <b>gears.</b> The later Merlin engine from the same company used opposite rotation <b>reduction</b> <b>gears</b> to provide counter-rotating propellers for twin-engined aircraft, a much cheaper method than designing and building the engines to run in opposite directions.|$|R
50|$|Improved B1M2 with revised <b>propeller</b> and <b>reduction</b> <b>gear.</b> 128 {{built by}} Mitsubishi and Hiro Naval Arsenal.|$|R
25|$|The Kestrel was {{produced}} in 40 distinct variants which {{can be divided into}} three main groups: normally aspirated, medium supercharged, and fully supercharged. One variant, the Kestrel VIII, was configured as a 'pusher engine' for the Short Singapore flying boat. Apart from supercharging, the variant differences centred on varying compression ratios and <b>propeller</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>gearing.</b>|$|R
500|$|To {{make the}} R as compact as possible, several design {{modifications}} {{were made in}} comparison to the Buzzard: the <b>propeller</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>gear</b> housing was reshaped, and the camshaft and rocker covers were modified to fair into the shape of the aircraft's nose, the air intake was positioned in the vee of the engine (which also helped to avoid the ingress of spray), and beneath the engine the auxiliaries were raised a little to reduce the depth of the fuselage. The engine's length was minimised by not staggering its cylinder banks fore and aft, which meant that the connecting rods from opposing cylinders had to share a short crankshaft bearing journal known as the [...] "big end". This was initially achieved by fitting one connecting rod inside the other at the lower end in a blade and fork arrangement; however, after cracking of the connecting rods was found during testing in 1931, the rod design was changed to an articulated type.|$|E
2500|$|The Allison VG-1410 was an {{air-cooled}} inverted Liberty L-12, with a geared super-charger and Allison epicyclic <b>propeller</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>gear</b> {{and reduced}} displacement. (4"x7"=1,411 cuin) ...|$|E
2500|$|One-piece, {{machined}} from a nitrogen-hardened nickel-chrome {{molybdenum steel}} forging. Statically and dynamically balanced. Seven main bearings and six throws. Internal oilway, with feed from both ends, used to distribute lubricants to main and big end bearings. [...] "Floating" [...] front end bearing consisting of an internally toothed annulus bolted to crankshaft, meshing with and incorporating a semi-floating ring, internally splined {{to a short}} coupling shaft. Coupling shaft splined at front end to driving wheel of <b>propeller</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>gear.</b> Clockwise rotation when viewed from rear.|$|E
50|$|The Robust {{is powered}} by a German 41 kW (55 hp) Hirth 2703 {{twin-cylinder}} in-line two-stroke engine, driving a three-blade <b>propeller</b> via <b>reduction</b> <b>gearing.</b>|$|R
25|$|One {{significant}} difference was the incorporation of the camshaft and magneto drives into the <b>propeller</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>gears</b> {{at the front of}} the engine, rather than using a separate system of gears driven from the back end of the crankshaft; this allowed the overall length of the engine to be reduced as well as making the drive train more reliable and efficient. The drive for the supercharger was also taken off the front of the engine, which required a long shaft to run to its location at the back of the engine.|$|R
50|$|The main {{change from}} the VI to the VII was the {{addition}} of a 0.62 ratio <b>propeller</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>gearing</b> system, allowing the engine to run at higher RPM, and thus higher power settings, while still efficiently driving the same propellers. A more minor change was the movement of the magnetos {{from the back of the}} cylinder banks to the front, which allowed easier access for maintenance, (similar changes to the original six-cylinder BMW V led to the BMW VIII). The crankcase was offered in aluminum alloy or Elektron.|$|R
5000|$|... (1940) 2,300 {{horsepower}} (1,715 kW). Experimental 0.332:1 <b>propeller</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>gear</b> ratio.|$|E
5000|$|M-105RA - (...) M-105PA with {{decreased}} <b>propeller</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>gear</b> {{ratio for}} bomber aircraft.|$|E
5000|$|... (1921) 650 hp, revised <b>propeller</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>gear</b> ratio, {{increased}} {{compression ratio}} (5.17:1). 34 built at Derby.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} XR-7755-1 design drove {{a single}} propeller, but {{even on the}} largest aircraft the propeller needed to absorb the power would have been ridiculously large. This led to a minor redesign that produced the XR-7755-3, using a new propeller gearing system driving a set of coaxial shafts to power a set of contra-rotating <b>propellers.</b> The <b>propeller</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>gearing</b> also had two speed settings {{to allow for a}} greater range of operating power than adjustable props alone could deliver. Another minor modification resulted in the XR-7755-5, the only change being the replacement of carburetors with a new fuel injection system.|$|R
5000|$|Each {{cylinder}} bank {{had a single}} overhead cam actuating the poppet valves. The camshaft included two sets of cams, one for full takeoff power, and another for economical cruise. The pilot could select between the two settings, which would shift the camshaft along its axis to bring the other set of cams over the valve stems. Interestingly, the design mounted some of the accessories on the [...] "front side" [...] of the camshafts, namely two magnetos and four distributors. The seventh camshaft was not used in this fashion, its location {{on the front of}} the engine was used to feed oil to the <b>propeller</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>gearing.</b>|$|R
50|$|The first {{prototype}} flew in August 1952, but {{the engines}} were still {{not ready for}} production. The second prototype, with upgraded Proteus III's, flew in December 1953. This example caught fire in February 1954 {{and had to be}} ditched. The cause was eventually traced to a failure in the <b>propeller</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>gearing,</b> but did not significantly set back development. However, at this point the de Havilland Comet suffered a series of mysterious crashes, and the ensuing investigation discovered extensive metal fatigue problems. This led to a new requirement that all designs had to undergo extensive water tank testing. After passing these tests, the Proteus engines proved to have icing problems, leading to additional redesigns. By the time the Britannia finally entered service in 1957, the Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-8 were about to enter service, dramatically limiting interest in the Britannia.|$|R
5000|$|M-105R - (...) Decreased <b>propeller</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>gear</b> {{ratio for}} bomber aircraft. Installed on Pe-2, BB-22 (Yak-4) and others.|$|E
5000|$|The Allison VG-1410 was an {{air-cooled}} inverted Liberty L-12, with a geared super-charger and Allison epicyclic <b>propeller</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>gear</b> {{and reduced}} displacement. (4"x7"=1,411 cuin) ...|$|E
50|$|An unusual {{feature of}} this engine was the {{epicyclic}} <b>propeller</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>gear</b> which contained a clutch designed to limit the maximum torque, thus protecting the reduction gears.|$|E
50|$|Centurion series {{engines are}} always fitted with {{constant}} speed propellers which allow {{the engine to}} be operated at optimum speed at all times. However, the normal operating speed is too high for any suitable propeller and so the propeller is driven through a reduction gearbox. The constant speed <b>propeller</b> and <b>reduction</b> <b>gear</b> result in a propeller tip speed that is 10-15% lower than comparable conventional avgas engines, reducing propeller noise.|$|R
2500|$|In 1995 Herakles {{received}} new main engines, <b>reduction</b> <b>gears,</b> <b>propeller</b> shafts and propellers in Turku. The old Ruston & Hornsby {{diesel engines}} were replaced with two Caterpillar 3606 DITA medium speed diesel engines delivering [...] each, {{nearly twice the}} power of the old main engines. New controllable pitch <b>propellers,</b> <b>propeller</b> ducts, <b>reduction</b> <b>gears</b> and clutches were provided by Ulstein. While this upgrade greatly improved her operational capabilities and increased her bollard pull to 588kN, she still remained underpowered in comparison with the original Finnpusku pushers.|$|R

50|$|The Pobjoy R was a British seven-cylinder, air-cooled, {{aircraft}} engine {{designed and built}} by Pobjoy Airmotors. Introduced in 1926 it was a popular engine for ultralight and small aircraft in the 1930s. A notable feature of the Pobjoy R was the <b>propeller</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>gear</b> which allowed the small engine to operate at more desirable higher speeds.|$|E
5000|$|As built, Chantilly was 478 ft {{long with}} {{a beam of}} 59 ft. She had a depth of 27 ft, and a draught of 27 ft.
