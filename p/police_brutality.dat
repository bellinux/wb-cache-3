50|$|Gough was a Marxist and the {{responses}} of some university administrations to her leftist leanings sometimes landed her in trouble. She supported Cuba during the Cuban Missile Crisis and was outspoken in her condemnation of <b>police</b> <b>brutalities.</b> As a result, most of the stipulated pay hikes during her teaching career were cancelled. Moreover, Gough's membership in the Johnson-Forest Tendency and her work for civil rights and {{against the war in}} Vietnam triggered the interest of the FBI, who placed her and her husband on their watchlist. In addition, Gough was active in peace movements within Brandeis campus, specifically from 1961-1963.|$|R

5|$|Based upon another {{recommendation}} from Cabranes, Sotomayor {{was a member}} of the board of directors of the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund from 1980 to 1992. There she was a top policy maker who worked actively with the organization's lawyers on issues such as New York City hiring practices, <b>police</b> <b>brutality,</b> the death penalty, and voting rights.

40|$|The {{issue of}} race in America {{in the twenty-first century}} is still a {{turbulent}} matter. The end of segregation in schools, politics, marriages and workplaces created a mask that hid racial inequalities and injustices (Whitmarsh 1). In a time where <b>police</b> <b>brutalities</b> have frequently surfaced in the media in a supposed “post-racial America”, Claudia Rankine writes a thought-provoking 160 page long “book-length poem” about everyday racism arguing that the overlooking of microaggressions (brief daily commonplace verbal and behavioral racial slights) are allowing macroaggressions (blatant racial act such as hate crime) to occur. Rankine’s “book-length poem” is an experimental work melding poetry, prose, essays, commentaries, video transcripts and imagery, which challenges the notion of what poetry can do and what poetry is supposed to look like. This thesis is a study on Claudia Rankine’s Citizen: An American Lyric in regards to her approach to the African American racial experience in a supposed “post-racial America”. Citizen is filled with anecdotal microaggressions from both Rankine herself and her friends, but also moments when microaggressions escalate to incident that have been frequent in the media such as the Trayvon Martin shooting and Zinedine Zidane’s World Cup head-butt. Naming her book Citizen: An American Lyric (2014), Rankine challenges the notion of citizenship and African American’s position as second class citizens. African Americans are still experiencing hardships that stems from slavery such as racial profiling, stereotyping, and racial slurs. Their citizenship which took centuries to gain, does not protect them from these hardships. Rankine is concerned with the subtle “everyday racism” African Americans experience on a daily basis and the profound affects this has on their self-image, but also the threat this poses to their lives. Rankine intervenes in current debates about racism due to her approach on everyday racism. In a time where macroaggressions such as <b>police</b> <b>brutalities</b> have reached the news and is taking up a lot of the racial discussion in the United States, Rankine decides to take out a magnifier to look at where the disease starts. Citizen is able to urgently speak about microaggressions as if they were macroaggressions. The urgency is created when Rankine follows up her anecdotes with meditations that show how racial comments and gestures are affecting people’s mental state. My interpretation is that Rankine is putting forth a message that claims that microaggressions should be considered an act of racism to the same degree macroaggresions are...|$|R
5|$|Danny K. Davis {{running for}} Chicago mayor in the Democratic primary {{scheduled}} for February 26, 1991, made <b>police</b> <b>brutality</b> and excessive force {{an issue in}} the campaign. He sought an independent citizens' review of the police department. On January 28, 1991, Amnesty International called for an investigation into police torture in Chicago. After Mayor of Chicago Richard M. Daley seemed reluctant to initiate an investigation, his opponent Davis questioned whether there was a police and city coverup. Eventually, after pressure by citizens' organizations and anti-brutality organizations, the police department resumed an internal investigation.|$|E

Levy-Pounds stated that she hoped to increase youth engagement with the NAACP during her term with the organization. She has been critical of racial disparities in the Minneapolis–Saint Paul region, citing them as some of the nation's worst.|$|E
5|$|In the {{afternoon}} of 11 March, a meeting was held to protest <b>police</b> <b>brutality</b> and arrests.

Continuing strikes were observed the following four days. Under such circumstances, the chief minister Nazimuddin signed an accord with the student leaders agreeing to some terms and conditions, without complying to the demand that Bengali be made a state language.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, Gregory Banks, {{a convicted}} felon, filed {{a civil suit}} for $16 million in damages against Burge, three colleagues, and the City of Chicago for condoning {{brutality}} and torture. He {{said that he had}} falsely confessed in 1983 to murder after he was tortured by officers: they placed a plastic bag over his head, put a gun in his mouth, and performed other acts. He said that the officers allegedly abused eleven other suspects, using such measures as electro-shock. The suit was brought by the People's Law Office attorneys who had represented Andrew Wilson in the 1989 <b>police</b> <b>brutality</b> case. The suit described 23 incidents against black and Hispanic suspects between 19721985. The Bank's suit named Sergeant Peter Dignan as one of the officers involved in the abuses. In 1995 Dignan was promoted for meritorious service, even though the City of Chicago had settled out of court with Banks on his suit.|$|E

5|$|Pembleton (Andre Braugher) and Bayliss (Kyle Secor) {{are called}} to {{investigate}} {{the shooting death of}} Charles Courtland Cox, a small-time drug peddler shot in the back shortly after a police raid of a crackhouse. When Pembleton suspects a police shooting, Lt. Tyron (Michael S. Kennedy) explains Officer Hellriegel (Jeffrey Mandon) accidentally shot Cox after falling down and discharging his weapon. However, Hellriegel does not recall details and appears nervous by questioning from Pembleton. Gee is angry with Pembleton's inquiries into the police, and becomes even angrier when Colonel Granger (Gerald F. Gough) and Captain Barnfather (Clayton LeBouef) say they will make Hellriegel a scapegoat if the media start suggesting racism or <b>police</b> <b>brutality.</b> Hellriegel is cleared when tests reveal the bullet does not match his gun, but Pembleton requests the firearms of the other officers be tested. Gee refuses to approve the tests, but Pembleton gets Barnfather to order them.|$|E
5|$|Prior to 1960, prisoners had {{virtually}} no recourse to the court system, because courts considered prisoners to have no civil rights. That changed in the late 1950s, when the ACLU began representing prisoners that were subject to <b>police</b> <b>brutality,</b> or deprived of religious reading material. In 1968, the ACLU successfully sued to desegregate the Alabama prison system; and in 1969, the New York affiliate adopted a project to represent prisoners in New York prisons. Private attorney Phil Hirschkop discovered degrading conditions in Virginia prisons following the Virginia State Penitentiary strike, and won an important victory in 1971's Landman v. Royster which prohibited Virginia from treating prisoners in inhumane ways. In 1972, the ACLU consolidated several prison rights efforts across the nation and created the National Prison Project. The ACLU's efforts led to landmark cases such as Ruiz v. Estelle (requiring reform of the Texas prison system) and in 1996 U.S. Congress enacted the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA) which codified prisoners' rights.|$|E
5|$|The French Democracy {{begins with}} a re-enactment of the real-life 27 October 2005 event that {{triggered}} riots in France: the electrocution of two teenagers, Zyed Benna and Bouna Traoré. In the film, the youths attempt to hide from police in a building near an electric power station. In a televised speech, the Minister of the Interior vows to increase efforts to fight crime. Three fictional Moroccan men discuss the recent events and disagree with means used by the police, and feel that blacks are unfairly targeted. They face different forms of discrimination: overnight detention {{for lack of a}} passport during an identity check, refusal of employment and housing rental, and <b>police</b> <b>brutality.</b> Angered, the three riot using Molotov cocktails. A white family watches television coverage of the chaos, and the film ends with a dedication to Benna and Traoré, lamenting the loss of the French ideals of freedom, equality, and fraternity.|$|E

50|$|As the Red Army {{progressively}} {{began to}} push the German soldiers out of Russia and victory became more certain, anti-religious propaganda began to resurrect. The Central Committee issued new resolutions in 1944 and 45 that called for a renewal of anti-religious propaganda. For the rest of Stalin's life, however, the propaganda was mostly limited to words and its main target was against the Vatican. With {{the construction of the}} 'Iron Curtain' across countries with large amounts of Roman Catholics, this policy was partly meant to isolate the communist countries from the Vatican's influence. Caricatures of Pius XII and other RCC bishops depicted them as war mongers and supporters of <b>police</b> <b>brutalities.</b> This propaganda was accompanied with the liquidation of Uniate churches (eastern-rite catholic churches) in the Ukraine, Czechoslovakia, Poland and Romania which were forcibly merged with the Orthodox church. They were given the option of becoming western-rite Catholics, but the absence of functioning churches in that rite except in large cities and dedication to the Byzantine ritual stopped many from doing so; many who resisted the official measure were imprisoned. The Lutheran Church in the Baltic territories along with the Roman Catholic Church were both subject to attacks for what the state perceived as loyalties to foreign influences—the Lutherans in particular were blamed for having open support for the German conquest.|$|R
