The Geosat sea-level data are used to investigate the variation and time-dependancy in sea-level anomaly in the Southern Ocean. Regions with high variability in sea-level anomaly correspond to the confluence zones of subtropical and subantarctic water and to the Antarctic Circumpolar Current(ACC). Two regions with higher variability exist in the ACC. High variability south of New Zealand is closely irelated to the bottom topography. The sea-level anomaly in this region does not show a clear propagation ignal, while the strong anomaly generated in Drake Passage propagates down stream at a speed of 4. 5 cm/s. In the southern regions of the ACC {{we were not able}} to find any significant variation of the Geosat sea-level data. time-dependency of sea-level variation along a latitude of 40 °S suggests that the Agulhas eddies are generated near 30 °S and move westward at a speed of 10 - 15 cm/s...|$|R

This study aimed to determine in dogs, the efficacy of sodium chloride solution 0. 9 % with or without dexamethasone {{in order to prevent}} adhesions after intercostal thoracotomy. Fifteen dogs were separated into three groups of five animals, A, B and C and underwent thoracotomy in the fifth left intercostal space. Three other dogs were submitted to a previous study. In the dogs of Group A it was performed only a thoracotomy and thoracorraphy; in group B, it was performed a thoracotomy, thoracorraphy and injection into the pleural cavity of isotonic sodium chloride (10 ml) and dexamethasone (1 mg kg- 1). In the dogs of the group C, it was performed the thoracotomy thoracorraphy and injected isotonic sodium chloride (10 ml kg- 1) into the pleural cavity. After 15 days of thoracotomy, it was performed transdiaphragmatic thoracocospy to determine the presence and score of adhesions between the lung and chest wall. The results demonstrated the presence of adhesions in the majority of group A and reduced or no adhesions in the other groups.

Wear amounts of the discs are lowered III the magnetic fields under the pure rolling conditions. However, at 100 / 0 rolling with sliding, the wear amounts are increased in the magnetic fields even though finer particles and smoother surfaces are observed.

Findings in this thesis show that global default rates explain as much as 80 percent of the annual variatio n in associated recovery rates when results {{are based on the}} same time frame (1982 - 2001) as in Altman, Resti and Sironi (2005), and around 66 percent when most recent observations (1982 - 2012) are included to the analysis. This thesis supports the findings in Altman, Resti and Sironi (2005) of a significant and negative link between default and recovery rates. Findings of a negative relationship between default and recovery rates have important implications for credit - risk - related models treating the recover y rate independent of the default rate, or probability of de fault. This thesis also analyzes the univariate and multivariate relationship between recovery rates and other market and macro based variables. Results from these tests shows that the bond defaul t rate, in comparison to these variables, undoubtedly explains the highest degree of variation in recovery rates. On a univariate basis the supply of defaulted securities significantly explains from 20 to 60 percent of the variation in recovery rates, howe ver, when added to the mu ltivariate models, results are divergent and the supply of defaulted bonds show no significant explanatory contribution. The latter results differ from the central thesis in Altman, Resti and Sironi (2005), where the multivariate r egression models assign a key role to the supply of defaulted bonds. nhhma...|$|R
