5|$|A {{visit to}} Cornwall in 1746–1747, {{where he met}} the antiquary and naturalist William Borlase, awakened an {{interest}} in minerals and fossils which formed his main scientific study during the 1750s. In 1750, his account of an earthquake at Downing was inserted in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, where there also appeared in 1756 a <b>paper</b> <b>on</b> several coralloid bodies he had collected at Coalbrookdale, Shropshire. More practically, Pennant used his geological knowledge to open a lead mine, which helped to finance improvements at Downing after he had inherited the estate in 1763.|$|E

5|$|Finally, {{the motives}} they {{suggested}} for a forgery are not strong, and are contradictory; {{one is that}} Richard Owen wanted to forge {{evidence in support of}} Charles Darwin's theory of evolution, which is unlikely given Owen's views toward Darwin and his theory. The other is that Owen wanted to set a trap for Darwin, hoping the latter would support the fossils so Owen could discredit him with the forgery; this is unlikely because Owen wrote a detailed <b>paper</b> <b>on</b> the London specimen, so such an action would certainly backfire.|$|E

5|$|In a 1993 review, Gary Morgan {{reinstated}} {{the animal}} {{as a distinct}} species closely related to O.couesi, citing an unpublished paper by Humphrey, Setzer, and himself.

5|$|In a 2009 <b>paper</b> <b>on</b> the affinities of Gondwanatheria, Yamila Gurovich and Robin Beck {{argue that}} the {{difference}} in shape between MACN-RN 975 and Argentodites is due to extensive wear on the former specimen; they write that {{the parts of the}} p4 that are not worn are virtually identical to the equivalents parts of the Argentodites p4. In addition, MACN-RN 975 is said to have as many ridges as Argentodites and to be of approximately similar size—about 15% larger. They allocate MACN-RN 975 to the gondwanathere Ferugliotherium and consequently, they argue that Argentodites most likely represents either Ferugliotherium or some related species. In the same year, Guillermo Rougier and colleagues also suggested ferugliotherian affinities of Argentodites in a <b>paper</b> <b>on</b> the mammals of the Allen Formation, another Cretaceous rock unit of Argentina. Ferugliotherium is a gondwanathere from Late Cretaceous Argentinean deposits. Gondwanatheres are a small and enigmatic group from the late Cretaceous and Paleogene of South America, Antarctica, Madagascar, India, and perhaps Tanzania. Although the evolutionary affinities of gondwanatheres are controversial, both teams that identified Argentodites as gondwanathere believe gondwanatheres are likely themselves multituberculates or closely related to them.|$|E
