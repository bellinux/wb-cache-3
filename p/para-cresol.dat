40|$|The {{hydrogenation}} of {{a number}} of unsaturated compounds containing carbon-oxygen bonds has been studied. In most cases the reactions were performed at 30 C and one atmosphere pressure of hydrogen, over Adams platinum oxide catalyst, in 50 ml. of a solvent, usually containing some acid. It has been concluded from the results obtained that :- (1). Hydrogenolysis of the carbon-oxygen bond is always prevalent when acid or acidified solvents are used with a substrate having a centre of unsaturation close to the carbon-oxygen link. Thus under these conditions phenols, benzyl alcohols, allylic alcohols and cyclohexanones cleave readily. Removal of the centre of unsaturation from the vicinity of the carbon-oxygen bond renders it less liable to hydrogenolysis, as shown by the considerably smaller cleavage of ?-phenyl ethyl alcohol. The kinetics of the hydrogenolysis of phenols and benzyl alcohols show marked similarities with the kinetics of the hydrogenolysis of the corresponding phenyl and benzyl chlorides and quaternary ammonium salts. In the case of phenols only small amounts of aromatic hydrocarbons are observable in the liquid phase during hydrogenolysis, in contrast to the case of chlorobenzene and trimethylphenyl ammonium chloride where cleavage leads to large amounts of benzene appearing in the liquid phase. In all the examples studied very little hydrogenolysis takes place in neutral or weakly basic solutions, and the proportion of hydrogenolysis is affected by the amount and acid strength of the acid used. (2). Addition of hydrogen to the unsaturation, producing the saturated alcohol, is also observed for all the oxygenated compounds tried, {{and in the absence of}} acid this appears to be the major reaction. Of particular interest is the case of phenols where the reduction of the aromatic ring is shown to be, to some extent, a two stage process. Cyclohexanone has been shown to be an intermediate in the reaction. An attempt has been made to estimate the extent of this two stage mechanism by interception of the cyclohexanone with semicarbazide, and by examination of the proportions of cis- and trans- methylcyclo- hexanols from ortho-, meta- and <b>para-cresols</b> and from the corresponding methylcyclohexanones. Addition of other aromatic molecules (e. g. benzene, toluene) and cyclohexene reduces the rate of the reduction of phenol, benzyl alcohol and cyclohexanones. Substituents in the ring of these compounds also led to smaller rates of reduction, the effect being qualitatively similar for both hydrogenolysis and addition reactions. The reduction of phenols and cyclohexanones in acidic methanol leads to the formation of cyclo-hexyl methyl ethers. The overall reactions are first order with respect to hydrogen pressure and weight of catalyst, and zero order with respect to the substrate concentration...|$|R

40|$|Background: Clostridium difficile is {{the major}} cause of {{antibiotic}} associated diarrhoea {{and in recent years}} its increased prevalence has been linked to the emergence of hypervirulent clones such as the PCR-ribotype 027. Characteristically, C. difficile infection (CDI) occurs after treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics, which disrupt the normal gut microflora and allow C. difficile to flourish. One of the relatively unique features of C. difficile is its ability to ferment tyrosine to <b>para-cresol</b> via the intermediate para-hydroxyphenylacetate (p-HPA). P-cresol is a phenolic compound with bacteriostatic properties which C. difficile can tolerate and may provide the organism with a competitive advantage over other gut microflora, enabling it to proliferate and cause CDI. It has been proposed that the hpdBCA operon, rarely found in other gut microflora, encodes the enzymes responsible for the conversion of p-HPA to p-cresol. Results: We show that the PCR-ribotype 027 strain R 20291 quantitatively produced more p-cresol in-vitro and was significantly more tolerant to p-cresol than the sequenced strain 630 (PCR-ribotype 012). Tyrosine conversion to p-HPA was only observed under certain conditions. We constructed gene inactivation mutants in the hpdBCA operon in strains R 20291 and 630 Δerm which curtails their ability to produce p-cresol, confirming the role of these genes in p-cresol production.

40|$|In aerobic and facultatively {{anaerobic}} bacteria, {{the degradation}} of <b>para-cresol</b> (p-cresol) involves the initial hydroxylation to p-hydroxybenzyl alcohol by water catalyzed by the soluble, periplasmatic flavocytochrome p-cresol methylhydroxylase (PCMH; α 2 β 2 composition). In denitrifying bacteria the further metabolism proceeds via oxidation to p-hydroxybenzoate, the formation of p-hydroxybenzoyl-coenzyme A (CoA), and the subsequent dehydroxylation of the latter to benzoyl-CoA by reduction. In contrast, the strictly anaerobic Desulfobacterium cetonicum degrades p-cresol by addition to fumarate, yielding p-hydroxybenzylsuccinate. In this work, in vitro enzyme activity measurements revealed that the obligately anaerobic Geobacter metallireducens uses the p-cresol degradation pathway of denitrifying bacteria. Surprisingly, PCMH, {{which is supposed to}} catalyze both p-cresol hydroxylation and p-hydroxybenzyl alcohol oxidation to the corresponding aldehyde, was located in the membrane fraction. The α subunit of the enzyme was present in two isoforms, suggesting an αα′β 2 composition.

The elderly patients were also classified into diabetic and nondiabetic groups. The serum levels of total and free p-cresol and IS were measured using ultra performance liquid chromatography. Biochemical data were also collected concurrently. Results: There were no statistical differences in biochemistry or in serum IS and p-cresol levels (total or free) between the elderly and nonelderly groups. For the elderly dialysis patients, total IS was positively related to age (r=− 0. 31, p< 0. 01); calcium level (r= 0. 297, p< 0. 05); and creatinine (r= 0. 44, p< 0. 01).

It contains a subfamily of enzymes that catalyse the oxidation of para-substituted phenols using covalently bound FAD cofactors (the 4 PO subfamily). This subfamily is composed of two oxidases, vanillyl alcohol oxidase (VAO) and eugenol oxidase (EUGO), and two flavocytochrome dehydrogenases, <b>para-cresol</b> methylhydroxylase (PCMH) and eugenol hydroxylase (EUGH). Although they catalyse similar reactions, these enzymes differ in terms of their electron acceptor preference and oligomerization state. For example, VAO forms homo-octamers that can be described as tetramers of stable dimers, whereas EUGO is exclusively dimeric in solution. A possible explanation for this difference is the presence of a loop at the dimer–dimer interface in VAO that is not present in EUGO. Here, the role played by this loop in determining the quaternary structure of these enzymes is investigated. A VAO variant where the loop was deleted, loopless VAO, exclusively formed dimers. However, introduction of the loop into EUGO was not sufficient to induce its octamerization. Neither variant displayed major changes in its catalytic properties as compared to the wild-type enzyme. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that the presence of the loop is conserved within putative fungal oxidases of the 4 PO subgroup, but it is never found in putative bacterial oxidases or dehydrogenases.

40|$|Lignocellulosic biomass {{could be}} used to provide {{sustainable}} sources of fuels such as bioethanol, and feedstock molecules for the chemical industry such as phenols and other aromatics. However, the dissolution of biomass and separation of lignin from cellulose and hemicellulose are the vital steps for biomass processing. Ionic liquids (ILs) can dissolve extensive quantities of lignocelluloses partially or completely while the cellulosic and lignin fractions can be separated upon the addition of suitable anti-solvent. This thesis describes the dissolution of lignocellulosic biomass in various ILs media, the interaction between lignocellulose components and ILs, and electrochemical oxidative depolymerisation of lignin fractions. The dissolution of macadamia nut powder was investigated in a range of imidazolium-based aprotic ILs where 1 -ethyl- 3 methylimidazolium acetate ([Emim][OAc]) was identified as the best solvent. Further studies with whole nuts-in-shell showed that [Emim][OAc]-treated shell could be cracked with only ca. 15 % of the energy compared to no treatment. A series of protic imidazolium-based ILs has been introduced for pine wood powder (Pinus radiata) processing, which were compared and contrasted with their aprotic analogues. One of the protic ILs, 1 -ethylimidazolium chloride ([Eim]Cl) was identified as an excellent media for wood dissolution and conversion of the cellulosic fraction to the product (glucose) upon enzymatic hydrolysis. The IL was recyclable after use without any structural change. Solid-state NMR revealed that the changes in regenerated lignocelluloses depend on both cations and anions of the ILs. The possibility of in-situ electrochemical formation of hypochlorite was studied in different hydrophobic and hydrophilic ILs aiming to facilitate the delignification of lignocellulosic biomass. However, the over-oxidation of electrochemically generated hypochlorite made this process unsuitable for biomass processing. Finally, a number of polyoxometalates (POMs) were introduced for the oxidative depolymerisation of lignin and its model compounds in various aqueous and IL media.

A clear preference of A. chroococcum SBUG 1484 PO-containing crude extracts was determined towards ortho-dihydroxylated compounds followed by mono-methoxylated monophenols, and dimethoxylated compounds (except 2, 6 -DMP with the highest activity of all substrates tested). Diminished activity towards para-dihydroxylated compounds was somewhat surprising as POs are strictly differentiated from catecholases and tyrosinases due to an exclusive and pronounced oxidation of 1, 4 -dihydroxylated compounds [Xu 1996]. However crude PO preparations from P. cinnabarinus SBUG-M 1044 showed comparable results to those obtained for A. chroocoocum crude phenol oxidase preparations. According to [Solano et al. 2001], results in the case of para-dihydroxylated substances could be reasoned with low molar adsorption coefficients at visible regions and instability of the formed products, suggesting para-diphenols as non-appropriate substrates in spectrophotometric standard assays. Substrates belonging to seven different compound classes were equally tested in a 5 mM concentration (2 mM for syringaldazine), which in some instances may lead to substrate inhibition of the tested enzymes. The pronounced oxidative activity of A. chroococcum SBUG 1484 crude PO towards 2, 6 -DMP and ABTS, a feature shared with P. cinnabarinus SBUG-M 1044 preparations, clearly confirms laccase-type characteristics of the herein described Azotobacter phenol oxidase. Furthermore, the studied bacterial PO comprised in cell-free crude extracts exhibited no PPO activity towards oxidation of tyrosine and <b>para-cresol,</b> which was however clearly determined with A. bisporus PPO. Crude PO of A. chroococcum SBUG 1484 possesses 128 % relative activity towards 2, 6 -DMP when compared to ABTS [Niladevi et al. (2008)]. studied 2, 6 -DMP as the preferred substrate for S. psammoticus PO with 214 % activity relative to that with ABTS. Despite the similarity between A. chroococcum SBUG 1484 and P. cinnabarinus SBUG-M 1044 crude PO preparations in 2, 6 -DMP oxidation, the examined prokaryotic PO differentiates from fungal PO due to an inability to oxidize vanillin azine and the typical laccase substrate syringaldazine. Both of these substrates reveal methoxy-substituents with an azine bridge at the C 4 -carbon atom of the aromatic ring. Structurally similar compounds, with methyl-, methylen or hydroxy-groups at the C 4 -position did not reduce activity of A. chroococcum crude PO, whereas substrates containing an acid or aldehyde residue as the terminal group were not oxidized. A. chroococcum SBUG 1484 as well as P. cinnabarinus SBUG-M 1044 PO preparations revealed no activity towards meta-dihydroxylated compounds, which has also been observed in many other POs with resorcinol derived substrates [Palmieri et al. 1997]. In case of ortho-diphenols the herein examined crude POs can be distinctly distinguished from PPO activity on the basis of decreased ΔA values within an extended time-range in which highest initial rates were obtained. However, comparing activity of A. chroococcum SBUG 1484 crude PO towards catechol-derivatives with other tested compounds, a high affinity towards substituted catechols was estimated. Laccase activity towards both, ortho- and para-dihydroxylated compounds has also been previously reported [Xu 1996].|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to measure the atmospheric reaction rates of dihydroxy(methyl) benzene and (methyl) benzoquinone compounds with the OH radical and to elucidate the atmospheric reaction mechanisms for phenol and the cresol isomers with both OH and NO 3 radicals. The study has yielded the following results:          Relative rate constants have been measured for the reactions of OH radicals with 1, 2 -dihydroxybenzene, 1, 2 -dihydroxy- 3 -methylbenzene, 1, 2 -dihydroxy- 4 -methylbenzene, 1, 4 -benzoquinone and methyl- 1, 4 -benzoquinone. The rate constants (in units of cm 3 molecule - 1 s - 1) were found to be (10. 4 ± 2. 1) x 10 - 11 for 1, 2 -dihydroxybenzene; (20. 5 ± 4. 3) x 10 - 11 and (15. 6 ± 3. 3) x 10 - 11 for 1, 2 -dihydroxy- 3 -methylbenzene and 1, 2 -dihydroxy- 4 -methylbenzene, respectively; (0. 46 ± 0. 09) x 10 - 11 and (2. 35 ± 0. 47) x 10 - 11 for 1, 4 -benzoquinone and methyl- 1, 4 -benzoquinone, respectively. The present kinetic data will improve the kinetic data base required to model the degradation mechanisms of aromatic compounds and to develop structure reactivity relationships for OH radicals with VOCs especially for oxygenated aromatic compounds. Using the kinetic data obtained in this study, in combination with an average tropospheric OH radical concentration of [OH] = 1. 6 x 10 6 cm - 3 estimated atmospheric residence times of the compounds due to reaction with OH radicals have been determined. From the results it can be concluded that the 1, 2 -dihydroxybenzenes have very short atmospheric lifetimes and probably will only influence the photochemical oxidant formation on a local scale, whereas the benzoquinones with significantly longer lifetimes will have a more regional influence.          Product analyses of the OH and NO 3 radical initiated oxidation of phenol and the cresol isomers under simulated atmospheric conditions were performed in a 1080 l quartz glass reactor at Wuppertal University and in the EUPHORE outdoor smog chamber facility in Valencia/Spain.          In the case of the OH initiated oxidation of phenol (or cresols), besides the already known nitrophenol products, new ring-retaining products were experimentally determined for the first time, namely, 1, 2 -dihydroxybenzene and 1, 4 -benzoquinone from phenol, 1, 2 -dihydroxy- 3 -methylbenzene and methyl- 1, 4 -benzoquinone from ortho -cresol, 1, 2 -dihydroxy- 3 -methylbenzene, 1, 2 - dihydroxy- 4 -methylbenzene, methyl- 1, 4 -benzoquinone and 3 -methyl- 4 -nitrophenol from meta -cresol and 1, 2 -dihydroxy- 4 -methylbenzene from <b>para-cresol.</b>          From {{the results of the present}} study it can be concluded that 1, 2 -dihydroxy(methyl) benzenes isomers are the major gas-phase reaction products of the OH radical initiated oxidation of phenol and the cresol isomers. Interaction of the OH - phenol and OH - cresol adducts with O 2 will mainly lead to the formation of 1, 2 -dihydroxybenezenes and HO 2. In addition, the large yields of 1, 2 -dihydroxybenzenes support that addition at the position ortho to the OH substituent dominates. The results also support that formation of (methyl) benzoquinone compounds, mainly via the OH addition channel. The close similarity of the nitrophenol formation yields from phenol and cresol isomers with the fraction of overall OH radical reaction estimated to proceed by H-atom abstraction from the OH group implies that the nitrophenol formation from phenolic compounds arises from the abstraction channel.          Based on the results of the product studies, general degradation mechanisms have been constructed for the OH initiated oxidation of phenol and the cresol isomers.          Studies of the NO 3 radical initiated oxidation of phenol and the cresol isomers have been carried out in two chamber systems: 1080 l quartz glass reactor at Wuppertal University and in the EUPHORE outdoor smog chamber facility in Valencia/Spain. The observed oxidation products and their distribution can be used to improve the general degradation mechanism of phenol and cresol isomers towards NO 3 radicals.          The products detected during this study were as follows: 2 -nitrophenol and 4 -nitrophenol from phenol; 6 -methyl- 2 -nitrophenol and 1, 4 -benzoquinone from ortho -cresol; 3 -methyl- 2 -nitrophenol, 3 -methyl- 4 -nitrophenol, 5 -methyl- 2 -nitrophenol and methyl- 1, 4 -benzoquinone from meta -cresol; 4 -methyl- 2 -nitrophenol from para -cresol. HNO 3 has also been identified as important co-product. The experimental results support that the degradation reactions initiated by NO 3 radicals of phenol and the cresol isomers form large yields of HNO 3. Formation of methyl- 1, 4 -benzoquinone in low yield has been identified for the first time as an oxidation product in the NO 3 radical initiated oxidation of ortho - and meta -cresol.          The results from this study show that major products from the NO 3 radical initiated reaction of phenol and cresol isomers are mixtures of nitrophenol isomers and with low yield of methyl- 1, 4 -benzoquinone.          The gas-phase reactions of the NO 3 radical with phenolic compounds have been postulated to proceed via an overall H-atom abstraction mechanism which occurs through an NO 3 - aromatic adduct which can decompose back to reactants or to form methyl phenoxy radicals and HNO 3. The methyl phenoxy radicals thus formed will react with NO 2 to form nitrophenols isomers. The results of the present study show that the abstraction reaction pathway leading to the phenoxy radical accounts for about 75 - 95 % of the overall reaction of phenolic compounds with NO 3 radicals. Consequently reaction pathways leading to ring cleavage products, if indeed taking place, will be of minor as importance.          The data obtained within the present work, concerning the products of the OH and NO 3 radical initiated oxidation of phenol and the cresol isomers, can be used to improve the knowledge on the atmospheric degradation mechanisms of aromatic hydrocarbons. The mechanisms constructed for the degradation of phenol and cresol isomers can be incorporated into atmospheric models to obtain more accurate estimates of production of O 3, other photo-oxidants and HNO 3 through the photo-oxidation of aromatic compounds...|$|E
