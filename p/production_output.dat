25|$|Probably their largest {{impact was}} in export markets. Before 1950, exports {{accounted}} for only 10 percent of <b>production</b> <b>output,</b> but a decade later, exports were now at 50% of output. Beers in the Netherlands became a very important partner. Beers became official importers for Scania-Vabis in the Netherlands, and established a dealer network, along with training programmes for both mechanics and drivers. Beers also offered free twice-yearly overhauls of their customers vehicles, and offered a mobile service throughout the Netherlands with their custom-equipped service trucks. Due to Beers concerted efforts, Scania-Vabis market share in the country remained at a consistent 20% throughout this period. Scania-Vabis were to adopt the business model of Beers in their own overseas sales operations.|$|E

25|$|Hydroelectric power {{stations}} continued to become larger throughout the 20th century. Hydropower {{was referred to}} as white coal for its power and plenty. Hoover Dam's initial 1,345 MW power station was the world's largest hydroelectric power station in 1936; it was eclipsed by the 6809 MW Grand Coulee Dam in 1942. The Itaipu Dam opened in 1984 in South America as the largest, producing 14,000 MW but was surpassed in 2008 by the Three Gorges Dam in China at 22,500 MW. Hydroelectricity would eventually supply some countries, including Norway, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Paraguay and Brazil, with over 85% of their electricity. The United States currently has over 2,000 hydroelectric {{power stations}} that supply 6.4% of its total electrical <b>production</b> <b>output,</b> which is 49% of its renewable electricity.|$|E
25|$|In 1987, Mikhail Gorbachev {{tried to}} reform and revitalize the economy with his program of perestroika. His {{policies}} relaxed state control over enterprises, {{but did not}} yet {{allow it to be}} replaced by market incentives, ultimately resulting in a sharp decline in <b>production</b> <b>output.</b> The economy, already suffering from reduced petroleum export revenues, started to collapse. Prices were still fixed, and property was still largely state-owned until after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. For most of the period after World War II up to its collapse, the Soviet economy was the second largest in the world by GDP (PPP), and was 3rd in the world {{during the middle of the}} 1980s to 1989, though in per capita terms the Soviet GDP was behind that of the First World countries. When compared to countries who had a similar GDP per capita to the Soviet Union in 1928, the Soviets experienced significant growth.|$|E
25|$|Despite these conditions, silver {{production}} fluctuated dramatically {{during the}} colonial period. After an initial fifteen-year surge in <b>production,</b> <b>output</b> began to fall in 1560 {{as a result of}} a severe labor shortage caused by the Indian population's inability to resist European diseases. Around the same time, Potosí's rich surface deposits became depleted, which meant that even more labor would be required to extract silver. The labor shortage was addressed by Francisco de Toledo, the energetic viceroy (the king's personal representative) of Peru, during a visit to Upper Peru in the 1570s. Toledo used the pre-Columbian mita to extract forced labor for the mines at Potosí from some sixteen districts in the highlands, which were designated as supplying mita. Adult males could be required to spend every sixth year working in the mines. Henceforth, Potosí mining depended on the mita as well as on a labor system in which relatively free men worked alongside those who were coerced. Toledo also regulated the mining laws, established a mint at Potosí, and introduced the mercury amalgam process. Adoption of the amalgam process was particularly important in that it eliminated Indian control over refining.|$|E

30|$|So, the {{knowledge}} management perspective suggests that operators have tacit {{knowledge that is}} important in determining {{the quality of the}} <b>production</b> <b>outputs.</b> They are expected to be active agents for quality, by using their knowledge to adjust the production processes for better quality outputs. This tacit knowledge is unable to be fully represented on control charts and standard operating procedures.|$|R

500|$|The {{pressure}} from both Hyundai and Kia, dominant automakers in the South Korean market, increased during the 2010s, pushing RSM sales down by 27% in 2011. In {{the first half}} of 2012, they fell 41%. In August 2012, a personnel reduction of about 80% of employees was presented by management. Finally, Renault reduced its Busan personnel by 15% (about 800 employees). With the aim of reviving the company, it invested (together with Nissan) US$160 million to make Nissan Rogues for export in order to improve the <b>production</b> <b>output</b> and also presented revised versions of the SM3 and SM5. During 2013, the company started to market a new compact crossover, the QM3, based on the Captur.

500|$|During Joseph Stalin's Second Five-Year Plan (1933-1938), the Communist Party Congress (and Stalin himself) {{devised the}} {{development}} and further expansion of the aviation industry, soon making air transport {{one of the primary}} means of transportation in the Soviet Union. Their strategy involved creating a network of cities and towns to deliver people, whether they were politicians, military officials, prisoners or travelers, and, most importantly, mail and freight. Stalin also recognized that with a strong civil aviation sector he could supply necessary equipment and materials to prisoners in the Gulag, increasing their efficiency and <b>production</b> <b>output.</b> By 1933, Soviet aviation delegations and engineers, some for as long as six months at a time, were regular visitors at the United States' most prominent aircraft developers, such as Boeing, Douglas, Pratt & Whitney and Curtiss-Wright (to name only a few). [...] These engineers would {{play a key role in}} the origins of Soviet aircraft manufacturer, Ilyushin. [...] For much of the Soviet Union's existence, air travel served to deliver freight. In the 1930s, freight made up 85 percent of Aeroflot's services. In fact, at this time, air travel in the Soviet Union existed as less of a means to travel, but rather a way for the government to develop remote areas of the nation for industrialization needs and resource acquisition. The public rarely flew as flights were often very expensive (350 rubles—maybe half of a workers' monthly salary) and service was poor.|$|E
500|$|After {{a three-year}} hiatus, in 1999 he paired with Julia Roberts in Notting Hill, which {{was brought to}} theatres by {{much of the same}} team that was {{responsible}} for Four Weddings and a Funeral. This new Working Title production displaced Four Weddings and a Funeral as the biggest British hit in the history of cinema, with earnings equalling $363million worldwide. As it became exemplary of modern romantic comedies in mainstream culture, the film was also received well by critics. CNN reviewer Paul Clinton said, [...] "Notting Hill stands alone as another funny and heartwarming story about love against all odds." [...] Reactions to Grant's Golden Globe-nominated performance were varied, with Salon.com's Stephanie Zacharek criticising that, [...] "Grant's performance stands as an emblem of what's wrong with Notting Hill. What's maddening about Grant is that he just never cuts the crap. He's become one of those actors who's all shambling self-caricature, from his twinkly crow's feet to the time-lapsed half century it takes him to actually get one of his lines out." [...] The film provided both its stars a chance to satirise the woes of international notoriety, most noted of which was Grant's turn as a faux-journalist who sits through a dull press junket with, what the New York Times called, [...] "a delightfully funny deadpan." [...] Grant also released his second <b>production</b> <b>output,</b> a fish-out-of-water mob comedy Mickey Blue Eyes, that year. It was dismissed by critics, performed modestly at the box office, and garnered its actor-producer mixed reviews for his starring role.

40|$|It is {{not widely}} {{recognised}} that diary-based surveys of time use contain data {{not only on}} ‘input’ time but also on ‘output’ time. The diaries record episodes of time use throughout the day showing activities that can be categorised not only as household production input time, such as preparing a meal, but also household output (or consumption) time such as eating a meal. Harvey and Mukhopadhyay (1996) {{seem to have been}} the first to use the methodology of counting output episodes from time use surveys to estimate and value household <b>production</b> <b>outputs.</b> Using episode data from the 1992 Canadian time use survey, they counted the number of meals, the hours of child care and the nights of accommodation.
