5|$|The Paradigm {{system allows}} the player to program six {{different}} roles, which the characters can assume to perform certain formations in battle {{in response to}} specific conditions. The roles consist of Commando, which uses non-elemental attacks to stabilize the Chain Gauge; Ravager, which uses elemental attacks to fill the Chain Gauge; Medic, a White Mage-type role which can heal the party; Saboteur, which can weaken enemies; Synergist, which can strengthen allies; and Sentinel, which has protective abilities. The two main characters can initially assume three roles, but they can learn others at the player's choosing as the game progresses. The player can select which roles the controlled character and the AI characters use while outside or during battle, {{which is the only}} way that the player can control the AI characters during a fight. The player can only choose from specific sets of <b>paradigms</b> that the player has set up before the battle. Monsters only have one role; different ones are used when the player switches <b>paradigms.</b> The player selects up to three monsters they wish to use in <b>paradigms</b> outside of battle. Unlike in Final Fantasy XIII, the player cannot summon the Eidolons, as the giant creatures were only available to the protagonists of that game.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. There {{is a broad}} use of {{the term}} “paradigm ” in Software Engineering. Concepts such as {{structured}} <b>paradigm,</b> cascade <b>paradigm</b> or agent-oriented <b>paradigm</b> are very frequent in software engineering research proposals. In this essay we distinguish between functional and scientific <b>paradigm</b> and we show that the common use of <b>paradigm</b> in Software Engineering is about the functional or engineering <b>paradigm</b> rather than scientific <b>paradigm.</b> We distinguish among four possible perspectives and, in this context, we sustain that the scientific perspective is intrinsic and hence very difficult to properly identify and describe. We argue that a discussion about the scientific <b>paradigm</b> in Software Engineering could help us to evaluate and improve the research practice in the discipline. ...|$|R

5|$|In modern history, orators such as Henry Clay would mimic Demosthenes's technique. His {{ideas and}} {{principles}} survived, influencing prominent politicians and movements of our times.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} <b>paradigm</b> development and course level on the outcomes of web based technology-mediated learning environments in order to ascertain if these external factors can help explain student outcomes. Using an institutional database of student outcomes, {{we were able to}} examine data from over 13, 000 students in 167 undergraduate courses from the years 1997 – 2003. Using this data we examined the question which types of courses are best suited for de-livery using web-based technologies. The findings indicate that technology-mediated learning can be used more effectively for some courses than others. Our results suggest that student grades are significantly higher and withdrawal rates lower for courses with high <b>paradigm</b> development (e. g., Biology, Computer Science) than for courses with low <b>paradigm</b> development (e. g., Sociol-ogy, English).
