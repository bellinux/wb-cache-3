5000|$|It's been a {{long time}} coming for this project, and due to the {{negative}} forces that tried to prevent this from materializing, Gray Poupon is more than a Music Album, it is a statement of how strong a family AOTP is and the strength and perseverance I possess.

I would {{once again}} like to take the {{opportunity}} to thank you for having entrusted me with the responsibility of carrying the Society forwards. There are a number of challenges faced by the Ophthalmic community. We need to work together to meet them and convert them into opportunities. I outlined them in my Presidential address at Ahmedabad and we will make a concerted effort to tackle all the issues during the year. I will look forward to your feedback on all these aspects. The issues that I referred to in my presidential address included efforts at improving the quality of ophthalmic education and training and redoubling our efforts at taking care of the problem of blindness while ensuring that the ophthalmologists get their just dues. We are trying to address these issues by two powerful subcommittees working in a time bound manner. Our recommendation regarding ophthalmic curriculum have been forwarded to the MCI. The curricula for post graduate fellowships are being finalized through the functioning of the AIOS collegium. I also alluded to the challenges posed by regulations by the medical insurance sector and medico legal issues. We are trying to address these issues through our medico legal cell and by writing to Insuranc...|$|E
40|$|Transcription begins] June 16, 1943 To: Members of the Bryant Service Club, I {{received}} your generous gift of assorted candies {{several days}} ago with great pleasure. As {{you would probably}} guess they didn’t last long. To make them last over two days would be a miracle. Buddies are buddies but there’s some communistic features to the unwritten laws we live by. “What’s yours is yours, and what’s mine is yours. ” All in all they’re a mighty swell bunch of fellows here. Like having 75 to 100 brothers, so I’m including their thanks with mine and they are sincere and full of appreciation. There’s a double pleasure in receiving a gift such as yours. First is the enjoyment received through the gift and second and perhaps even more appreciated and lasting is {{the thought of being}} remembered by your fellow college men and women. I hope in the future it may be our <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>you</b> who have thought of us in the service at a future alumni gathering. The effort, fine work, and success of your club is realized by {{those of us who have}} received your pleasent [sic] gifts. I, as one of many, am grateful to you members for your thoughtfulness.
