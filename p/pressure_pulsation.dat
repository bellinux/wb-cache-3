This unsteady but periodic flow variation at the discharge port excites the <b>pressure</b> <b>pulsation,</b> which is the main source of noise and vibration. In this paper, a mathematic model based on the one-dimensional unsteady gas flow equations is established to describe the discharge <b>pressure</b> <b>pulsation,</b> which considers the effects of friction and heat transfer between the gas and the pipe. The boundary conditions of the discharge <b>pressure</b> <b>pulsation</b> model are given in detail.

40|$|In a {{hermetic}} {{reciprocating compressor}} the suction pressure pulsations affect compressor performance and noise. The pressure pulsations are created {{due to the}} dynamic flow of refrigerant through the suction valve into the cylinder bore. One dimensional (1 D) acoustic method, Finite Element Method (FEM) calculated impedance transfer matrix method, and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) are three commonly used methods to calculate these pressure pulsations. With CFD being used most often to solve this type of analysis; however CFD is often time consuming and requires significant computer resources. In order to solve the <b>pressure</b> <b>pulsation</b> analyses faster, the suction plenum geometry is often simplified by reducing the model size.

The Helmholtz model, applied in all commercial programs offered by the companies pro-fessionally dealing with damping <b>pressure</b> <b>pulsations,</b> contains numerous simplifying assumptions; a straight pipe segment, with an ideal gas isentropic flow assumption, substitutes each element of the piping system.
