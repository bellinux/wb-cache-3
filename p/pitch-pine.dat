2500|$|HMS Liverpool was a Royal Navy [...] frigate, {{reclassified}} as {{a fourth}} rate. [...] She {{was built by}} Wigram, Wells and Green and launched at Woolwich on 21 February 1814. She was built of <b>pitch-pine,</b> which made for speedy construction {{at the expense of}} durability.|$|E
2500|$|In 1874, Alert {{was taken}} in hand for {{conversion}} {{to the role of}} arctic exploration. [...] Her single-expansion engine was replaced with an R & W Hawthorn compound-expansion engine, she was reboilered to , her armament was reduced to four guns and her hull was strengthened with felt-covered iron. [...] Above the waterline she was sheathed with teak, and below it, Canadian elm and <b>pitch-pine.</b> [...] The modifications caused her displacement to increase to 1,240 tons.|$|E
2500|$|In an 1834 {{letter to}} Silliman, Morey wrote: “It {{is now more}} than twenty years since I have been in the constant, I may say daily {{practice}} of making experiments on the decomposition of water, by mixing with its vapor that of spirits of turpentine, and a great portion of atmospheric air.” This would seem to understate the scope of some research that led to such diverse discoveries as the liquid fueled internal combustion engine, a method for carbonating water, and odd bubbles formed by molten resin. The last two appeared in journals in England and Germany, respectively. Morey noted differences in flames near knots, perhaps rich in sap, or in wet wood. Eventually he experimented with anything he could find: “tar, rosin, rough turpentine, or the spirit, or alcohol, or any kind of oil, fat, or tallow; mineral coal, <b>pitch-pine</b> wood, and the knots, birch bark, pumpkin, sun-flower, flax, and other seeds; as well as many other substances.” ...|$|E
60|$|When {{he got to}} {{the fire}} he saw that it was not many hours old and was {{surrounded}} by fresh boot and horse tracks in the dust. Piles of slender pine logs, trimmed flat on one side, were proof of somebody's intention to erect a cabin. In a rage he flung himself from the saddle. It was not many moments' work for him to push part of the fire under the fence, and part of it against the pile of logs. The <b>pitch-pines</b> went off like rockets, driving the thirsty cattle back.|$|R
60|$|While {{the young}} man, in these unusual circumstances, stood {{watching}} the marching of the troops, {{he heard the}} noise of rustling boughs, and the voices of men, and soon understood that the party, which he had seen separate itself from the main body and ascend the hill, was now marching along on the hill-top, the long ridge which, with a gap or two, extended {{as much as a}} mile from the village. One of these gaps occurred a little way from where Septimius stood. They were acting as flank guard, to prevent the up-roused people from coming so close to the main body as to fire upon it. He looked and saw that the detachment of British was plunging down one side of this gap, with intent to ascend the other, so that they would pass directly over the spot where he stood; a slight removal to one side, among the small bushes, would conceal him. He stepped aside accordingly, and from his concealment, not without drawing quicker breaths, beheld the party draw near. They were more intent upon the space between them and the main body than upon the dense thicket of birch-trees, <b>pitch-pines,</b> sumach, and dwarf oaks, which, scarcely yet beginning to bud into leaf, lay on the other side, and in which Septimius lurked.|$|R
6000|$|Our route was {{along the}} Bay side, through Barnstable, Yarmouth, Dennis, and Brewster, to Orleans, {{with a range}} of low hills on our right, running down the Cape. The weather was not {{favorable}} for wayside views, but we made the most of such glimpses of land and water as we could get through the rain. The country was, for the most part, bare, or with only a little scrubby wood left on the hills. We noticed in Yarmouth--and, if I do not mistake, in Dennis--large tracts where <b>pitch-pines</b> were planted four or five years before. They were in rows, as they appeared when we were abreast of them, and, excepting that there were extensive vacant spaces, seemed to be doing remarkably well. This, we were told, was the only use to which such tracts could be profitably put. Every higher eminence had a pole set up on it, with an old storm-coat or sail tied to it, for a signal, that those {{on the south side of}} the Cape, for instance, might know when the Boston packets had arrived on the north. It appeared as if this use must absorb the greater part of the old clothes of the Cape, leaving but few rags for the pedlers. The wind-mills on the hills,--large weather-stained octagonal structures,--and the salt-works scattered all along the shore, with their long rows of vats resting on piles driven into the marsh, their low, turtle-like roofs, and their slighter wind-mills, were novel and interesting objects to an inlander. The sand by the road-side was partially covered with bunches of a moss-like plant, Hudsonia tomentosa, which a woman in the stage told us was called [...] "poverty-grass," [...] because it grew where nothing else would.|$|R
2500|$|On {{the ground}} floor of the tower is the entrance, above that the organ chamber, then the ringing chamber, the clock chamber, the belfry, a stone gabled roof, and finally there was {{originally}} an [...] "ornamental wrought iron cross." [...] The Gothic Revival style was intended to mimic the style of the 14th century. There is carving at the entrances and at the tops of the chancel columns. The original east and west windows were by Charles Eamer Kempe. There was a reredos as wide as the chancel, and a <b>pitch-pine</b> interior roof. The nave was floored with wood block beneath the pews, and flagged in the aisles. John Thompson of Peterborough made the oak pews, pulpit and prayer desk, and the altar table in the nave and chancel. The octagonal font was of black marble, plainly carved and seated on two Dalbeattie granite steps. The church and all interior furnishings were designed and supervised by Barber, who was described in the Yorkshire Gazette as [...] "Mr W. Swinden Barber, F.R.I.B.A. of Halifax, whose success as an ecclesiastical architect is so well known." [...] The bells of St Paul's, made by Taylor of Loughborough and hung in 1882, were removed in 1998 to Charleston, South Carolina. The clock was made by William Potts of Leeds and installed in 1882; the autowind motor was installed by another company.|$|E
2500|$|In 1905, Canon Elliston and churchwardens Andus Hirst and George Lewis {{petitioned the}} Bishop of Ripon William Boyd Carpenter for a faculty {{to take down}} and remove the altar and rails, the clergy choir stalls and the prayer desks from the chancel. The wanted to remove the communion rail steps under the chancel arch, {{and all of the}} floor east of them. They wanted to raise the chancel floor by four inches, and to replace the chancel steps with Pateley Bridge stone. They planned a new chancel floor of the same stone, laid in squares and diamonds. There would be a new chancel screen, and an asphalt {{concrete}} floor overlaid with pitch pine under the choir stalls. They wanted a new altar of Austrian wainscot oak, and rails around it. Above the altar, they planned a retable with brass cross, flower vases and candlesticks. They wanted a wooden dado around the three chancel walls. They wanted to re-fix Barber's original <b>pitch-pine</b> choir stalls, but planned additional pitch pine seats for clergy, and new desks for the choir boys. They wanted a new carved oak chancel screen with a cross on top. They also wanted wrought iron gates in the chancel screen [...] "to prevent the entrance of strangers into the chancel, who visit the church during the summer months, when it is left open for private prayer." [...] The cost was estimated at £265, to be raised by voluntary contribution (in the event the cost of the chancel screen was donated by Dinah Cautley). They stated that the congregation had approved these plans. Elliston was given permission on 10 November 1905. to complete the project within the following three years.|$|E
60|$|The {{crackling}} and roaring of {{the fire}} grew louder. He could see the column of yellow and black smoke. Once fairly under way, the flames rapidly consumed the <b>pitch-pine</b> logs. In an hour Legget's cabins were a heap of ashes.|$|E
60|$|Before sunset, {{having already}} seen the {{mackerel}} fleet returning into the Bay, {{we left the}} sea-shore on the north of Provincetown, and made our way across the Desert to the eastern extremity of the town. From the first high sand-hill, covered with beach-grass and bushes to its top, {{on the edge of}} the desert, we overlooked the shrubby hill and swamp country which surrounds Provincetown on the north, and protects it, in some measure, from the invading sand. Notwithstanding the universal barrenness, and the contiguity of the desert, I never saw an autumnal landscape so beautifully painted as this was. It was like the richest rug imaginable spread over an uneven surface; no damask nor velvet, nor Tyrian dye or stuffs, nor the work of any loom, could ever match it. There was the incredibly bright red of the Huckleberry, and the reddish brown of the Bayberry, mingled with the bright and living green of small <b>Pitch-Pines,</b> and also the duller green of the Bayberry, Boxberry, and Plum, the yellowish green of the Shrub-oaks, and the various golden and yellow and fawn-colored tints of the Birch and Maple and Aspen,--each making its own figure, and, in the midst, the few yellow sand-slides on the sides of the hills looked like the white floor seen through rents in the rug. Coming from the country as I did, and many autumnal woods as I had seen, this was perhaps the most novel and remarkable sight that I saw on the Cape. Probably the brightness of the tints was enhanced by contrast with the sand which surrounded this tract. This was a part of the furniture of Cape Cod. We had for days walked up the long and bleak piazza which runs along her Atlantic side, then over the sanded floor of her halls, and now we were being introduced into her boudoir. The hundred white sails crowding round Long Point into Provincetown Harbor, seen over the painted hills in front, looked like toy ships upon a mantel-piece.|$|R
6000|$|In {{the north}} {{part of the}} town there is no house from shore to shore for several miles, and it is as wild and solitary as the Western Prairies--used to be. Indeed, one who has seen every house in Truro will be {{surprised}} to hear {{of the number of}} the inhabitants, but perhaps five hundred of the men and boys of this small town were then abroad on their fishing grounds. Only a few men stay at home to till the sand or watch for blackfish. The farmers are fishermen-farmers and understand better ploughing the sea than the land. They do not disturb their sands much, though there is a plenty of sea-weed in the creeks, to say nothing of blackfish occasionally rotting the shore. Between the Pond and East Harbor Village there was an interesting plantation of <b>pitch-pines,</b> twenty or thirty acres in extent, like those which we had already seen from the stage. One who lived near said that the land was purchased by two men for a shilling or twenty-five cents an acre. Some is not considered worth writing a deed for. This soil or sand, which was partially covered with poverty and beach grass, sorrel, &c., was furrowed at intervals of about four feet and the seed dropped by a machine. The pines had come up admirably and grown the first year three or four inches, and the second six inches and more. Where the seed had been lately planted the white sand was freshly exposed in an endless furrow winding round and round the sides of the deep hollows, in a vertical spiral manner, which produced a very singular effect, as if you were looking into the reverse side of a vast banded shield. This experiment, so important to the Cape, appeared very successful, and perhaps the time will come when the greater part of this kind of land in Barnstable County will be thus covered with an artificial pine forest, as has been done in some parts of France. In that country 12,500 acres of downs had been thus covered in 1811 near Bayonne. They are called pignadas, and according to Loudon [...] "constitute the principal riches of the inhabitants, where there was a drifting desert before." [...] It seemed a nobler kind of grain to raise than corn even.|$|R
6000|$|When we have {{returned}} from the seaside, we sometimes ask ourselves why we did not {{spend more time in}} gazing at the sea; but very soon the traveller does not look as the sea more than at the heavens. As for the interior, if the elevated sand-bar {{in the midst of the}} ocean can be said to have any interior, it was an exceedingly desolate landscape, with rarely a cultivated or cultivable field in sight. We saw no villages, and seldom a house, for these are generally on the Bay side. It was a succession of shrubby hills and valleys, now wearing an autumnal tint. You would frequently think, from the character of the surface, the dwarfish trees, and the bearberries around, that you were on the top of a mountain. The only wood in Eastham was on the edge of Wellfleet. The <b>pitch-pines</b> were not commonly more than fifteen or eighteen feet high. The larger ones covered with lichens,--often hung with the long gray Usnea. There is scarcely a white-pine on the forearm of the Cape. Yet in the northwest part of Eastham, near the Camp Ground, we saw, the next summer, some quite rural, and even sylvan retreats, for the Cape, where small rustling groves of oaks and locusts and whispering pines, on perfectly level ground, made a little paradise. The locusts, both transplanted and growing naturally about the houses there, appeared to flourish better than any other tree. There were thin belts of wood in Wellfleet and Truro, a mile or more from the Atlantic, but, for the most part, we could see the horizon through them, or, if extensive, the trees were not large. Both oaks and pines had often the same flat look with the apple-trees. Commonly, the oak woods twenty-five years old were a mere scraggy shrubbery nine or ten feet high, and we could frequently reach to their topmost leaf. Much that is called [...] "woods" [...] was about half as high as this,--only patches of shrub-oak, bayberry, beach-plum, and wild roses, overrun with woodbine. When the roses were in bloom, these patches in the midst of the sand displayed such a profusion of blossoms, mingled with the aroma of the bayberry, that no Italian or other artificial rose-garden could equal them. They were perfectly Elysian, and realized my idea of an oasis in the desert. Huckleberry-bushes were very abundant, and the next summer they bore a remarkable quantity of that kind of gall called Huckleberry-apple, forming quite handsome though monstrous blossoms. But it must be added, that this shrubbery swarmed with wood-ticks, sometimes very troublesome parasites, and which it takes very horny fingers to crack.|$|R
60|$|The {{partitions}} of {{the cubicle}} were of polished <b>pitch-pine,</b> {{and there was}} a green curtain in front. In those days there was little thought of ventilation, and the windows were closed except when the dormitory was aired in the morning.|$|E
60|$|There were unaging <b>pitch-pine</b> {{doors of}} Gothic design in it; there were inlaid marble mantel-pieces and cut-steel fenders; there were stupendous wall-papers, and octagonal, medallioned Wedgwood what-nots, and black-and-gilt Austrian images holding candelabra, {{with every other}} {{refinement}} that Art had achieved or wealth had bought between 1851 and 1878. And everything reeked of varnish.|$|E
60|$|I {{think that}} I may venture {{to say that}} every white-pine cone that falls to the earth {{naturally}} in this town, before opening and losing its seeds, and almost every <b>pitch-pine</b> one that falls at all, is cut off by a squirrel, and they begin to pluck them long before they are ripe, {{so that when the}} crop of white-pine cones is a small one, as it commonly is, they cut off thus almost every one of these before it fairly ripens. I think, moreover, that their design, if I may so speak, in cutting them off green, is, partly, to prevent their opening and losing their seeds, for these are the ones for which they dig through the snow, and the only white-pine cones which contain anything then. I have counted in one heap, within a diameter of four feet, the cores of 239 <b>pitch-pine</b> cones which had been cut off and stripped by the red squirrel the previous winter.|$|E
60|$|The burgomaster had {{advanced}} {{ideas in the}} ship-owning line. At that time not every one would have known enough to think of despatching a cargo steamer to the Pacific. But he loaded her with <b>pitch-pine</b> deals and sent her off to hunt for her luck. Wellington {{was to be the}} first port, I fancy. It doesn't matter, because in latitude 44 d south and somewhere halfway between Good Hope and New Zealand the tail shaft broke and the propeller dropped off.|$|E
6000|$|... "Clear {{the road}} {{there for the}} bride!" [...] yelled a hundred voices as Maggie walked calmly up an aisle densely walled with strange men. She had been {{accustomed}} to such characters all her life, and knew them too well to be afraid. Mounting a beer-keg, she turned a benign face on the crowd. The light of the torches lighted her hair till it shone like spun gold in a halo round her head. She looked very handsome in the warm, sympathetic light of the burning <b>pitch-pine.</b>|$|E
60|$|At one {{of these}} villages, where he and Forester stopped to spend the night, they {{went out in the}} evening to see the mills. The mills were lighted by little fires of <b>pitch-pine</b> knots, which made a bright flame and gave a fine light. These little fires were built upon slabs, which Marco thought was very dangerous. The slabs, however, though they looked dry, were really very wet, being {{thoroughly}} soaked with water within, having been sawed from logs which had been for a long time floating in the river.|$|E
60|$|The {{traveler}} {{who wants}} a ride through scenery of more varied and singular beauty than can ordinarily {{be found on the}} shores of any land whatever, should start some fine clear day along the clean sandy road, ribboned with strips of green grass, that leads through the flat <b>pitch-pine</b> forests of Brunswick toward the sea. As he approaches the salt water, a succession of the most beautiful and picturesque lakes seems to be lying softly cradled in the arms of wild, rocky forest shores, whose outlines are ever changing with the windings of the road.|$|E
60|$|By the twenty-sixth of October {{the large}} Scarlet Oaks {{are in their}} prime, when other Oaks are usually withered. They have been {{kindling}} their fires for a week past, and now generally burst into a blaze. This alone of our indigenous deciduous trees (excepting the Dogwood, of which I do not know half a dozen, and they are but large bushes) {{is now in its}} glory. The two Aspens and the Sugar-Maple come nearest to it in date, but they have lost the greater part of their leaves. Of evergreens, only the <b>Pitch-Pine</b> is still commonly bright.|$|E
60|$|We {{got under}} way at once, and took to the trail at a jog-trot. I knew my horse better and he was more used to me, which made it at least bearable to both of us. Before long the canyon widened out into the level forest land thickly studded with {{magnificent}} pines. I had again the feeling of awe and littleness. Everything was solemn and still. The morning air was cool, and dry as toast; the smell of <b>pitch-pine</b> choked my nostrils. We rode briskly down the broad brown aisles, across the sunny glades, under the murmuring pines.|$|E
6000|$|... "After {{the death}} of Mr. Johnson," [...] said he, [...] "Grandfather's chair came into the {{possession}} of Roger Williams. He was a clergyman, who arrived at Salem, and settled there in 1631. Doubtless the good man has spent many a studious hour in this old chair, either penning a sermon or reading some abstruse book of theology, till midnight came upon him unawares. At that period, as there were few lamps or candles to be had, people used to read or work {{by the light of}} <b>pitch-pine</b> torches. These supplied the place of the 'midnight oil' to the learned men of New England." ...|$|E
60|$|Bill {{shook his}} head. Far to our right a {{pall of smoke}} moved over the tree-tops, to our left was foggy gloom, behind rolled the unceasing roar. We all looked {{straight}} across. Probably each of us harbored the same thought. Before that wind the fire would leap the canyon in flaming bounds, and on the opposite level was the thick <b>pitch-pine</b> forest of Penetier proper. So far we had been among the foot-hills. We dared not enter the real forest with that wild-fire back of us. Momentarily we stood irresolute. It was a pause full of hopelessness, such as might have come to tired deer, close harried by hounds.|$|E
6000|$|... "Such company, thou wouldst say," [...] {{observed}} the elder person, interpreting his pause. [...] "Well said, Goodman Brown! I {{have been as}} well acquainted with your family as with ever a one among the Puritans; and that's no trifle to say. I helped your grandfather, the constable, when he lashed the Quaker woman so smartly {{through the streets of}} Salem; and it was I that brought your father a <b>pitch-pine</b> knot, kindled at my own hearth, to set fire to an Indian village, in King Philip's war. They were my good friends, both; and many a pleasant walk have we had along this path, and returned merrily after midnight. I would fain be friends with you for their sake." ...|$|E
60|$|In this neighborhood, where {{oaks and}} pines are about equally dispersed, {{if you look}} through the {{thickest}} pine wood, even the seemingly unmixed <b>pitch-pine</b> ones, you will commonly detect many little oaks, birches, and other hard woods, sprung from seeds carried into the thicket by squirrels and other animals, and also blown thither, but which are over-shadowed and choked by the pines. The denser the evergreen wood, {{the more likely it}} is to be well planted with these seeds, because the planters incline to resort with their forage to the closest covert. They also carry it into birch and other woods. This planting is carried on annually, and the oldest seedlings annually die; but when the pines are cleared off, the oaks, having got just the start they want, and now secured favorable conditions, immediately spring up to trees.|$|E
6000|$|... "You may {{guess that}} settled me. I had got to git at once, so I began to crawl off towards {{the foot of}} the cliffs. By the time I had got there, there war six torches burning a hundred yards below, and the men who carried them were searching every bush and prying under every rock. Along the middle of the valley six other torches were burning fifty yards apart. There was one advantage, the torches were <b>pitch-pine</b> and gave a fairish light, but not so much as tarred rope would have done; but it was enough for {{me to be able to}} make out the face of the cliff, and I saw a break by which I could get up for a good bit anyhow. It was where a torrent came down when the snows were melting, and as soon as I had got to the bottom I made {{straight}} up. There were rocks piled at its foot, and I got to the top of these without being seen.|$|E

"Well," [...] said Starbuck, [...] "we kalkilate {{to gather}} early Christmas night in Hooper's Hollow and rig {{ourselves}} up Injun fashion, {{and then start}} for Spindler's with <b>pitch-pine</b> torches, and have a 'torchlight dance' around the house; them who does the dancin' and yellin' outside takin' their turn at goin' in and hevin' refreshment. Jake Cooledge, of Boston, sez if anybody objects to it, we've only got to say we're 'Mummers of the Olden Times,' sabe?

Then, at the finish, Jake Cooledge is goin' to give one of his surkastic speeches,--kinder welcomin' Spindler's family to the Free Openin' o' Spindler's Almshouse and Reformatory."

60|$|He {{laid down}} the total {{expenditure}} at 21,000l. per annum, including expenses in England. This sum would work 100 tons per diem with 350 hands (each at 1s. hire and 3d. subsistence-money) and sixteen cooks and servants. The staff would consist of six officers. The manager should draw 800l. (not 1,200l.), and the surgeon, absolutely necessary in case of accidents, 450l. with rations. This is the pay of Government, which does not allow subsistence. The reduction-officer and the book-keeper are rated at 500l., and the superintendent of works and the head-miner each at 240l. The pay of carpenters and other mechanics, who should {{know how to make}} small castings, would range from 180l. to 150l. The first native clerk and the store-keeper would be paid 100l.; the time-keeper, with three assistants, 70l. and 65l. The manager requires office, sitting-room, and bedroom, and the medico a dispensary; the other four would have separate sleeping-places and a common parlour. Each room would have its small German stove for burning mangrove-fuel; and a fire-engine should be handy on every establishment. All the white employés would mess together, unless it be found advisable to make two divisions. The house would be of the usual <b>pitch-pine</b> boarding on piles, like those of Lagos, omitting the common passage or gallery, which threatens uncleanness; and the rooms might be made gay with pictures and coloured prints. The natives would build bamboo-huts.|$|E
60|$|By night, {{when he sees}} {{perfectly}} {{and moves}} about rapidly from one feeding-ground to another, Whitooweek is easily dazzled by a light of any kind, and {{he is one of}} the many creatures that come and go within the circle of your jack. Because he is silent at such times, and moves swiftly, he is generally unnamed--just a night bird, you think, and let him pass without another thought. Several times when jacking, to see what birds and animals I might surprise and watch by night, I have recognized Whitooweek whirling wildly about my circle of light. Once, deep in the New Brunswick wilderness, I surprised two poachers spearing salmon at midnight with a fire-basket hung over the bow of their canoe. Spite of its bad name it is a magnificent performance, skillful and daring beyond measure; so instead of driving them off I asked for a seat in their long dugout to see how it was done. As we swept up and down the dangerous river, with <b>pitch-pine</b> blazing and cracking and the black shadows jumping about us, two woodcock sprang up from the shore and whirled madly around the pirogue. One brushed my face with his wings, and was driven away only when Sandy in the bow gave a mighty lunge of his spear and with a howl of exultation flung a twenty-pound, kicking salmon back into my lap. But several times that night I saw the flash of their wings, or heard their low surprised twitter above the crackle of the fire and the rush and roar of the rapids.|$|E
60|$|Jack led the way, and, sure enough, he soon {{reached a}} place where the embers of what had been a {{considerable}} body of fire, were smouldering on the rock. The wind had probably caused some brand to kindle momentarily, which was the object that had caught Tier's eye. No doubt any longer remained of their having found the very place where the mate had cooked his supper, and lighted his beacon, though he himself was not near it. Around these embers were all the signs of Mulford's having made the meal, of which Jack had seen the preparations. A portion of the turtle, much the greater part of it, indeed, lay in its shell; and piles of wood and sea-weed, both dry, had been placed at hand, ready for use. A ship's topgallant-yard, with most of its rope attached, lay with a charred end near the fire, of where the fire had been, the wood having burned until the flames went out for want of contact with other fuel. There were many pieces of boards of <b>pitch-pine</b> in the adjacent heap, and two or three beautiful planks of the same wood, entire. In short, from the character and quantity of the materials of this nature that had thus been heaped together, Jack gave it as his opinion that some vessel, freighted with lumber, had been wrecked to windward, and that the adjacent rocks had been receiving the tribute of her cargo. Wrecks are of very, very frequent occurrence on the Florida Reef; and there are always moments when such gleanings are to be made in some part of it or other.|$|E
60|$|This fine {{concession}} is {{a rectangular}} parallelogram, whose dimensions are 2,000 yards long {{from north to}} south, by a breadth of half. The village stands outside the south-western angle, and the Fía rivulet runs through the south-eastern corner. The surface is rolling ground, with a rise and a depression trending from south-west to north-east. The whole extent, except where 'bush' lingers, is an old plantation of bananas, manioc, and ground-nuts. There is an ample supply of good hard timber, but red <b>pitch-pine</b> or creosoted teak from England would last much longer. Amongst the trees are especially noted the copal, the gamboge, rich in sticky juice, the brovi, {{said to be the}} hardest wood, and the dum, or African mahogany (Oldfieldia africana), well known in Ceylon as excellent material for boat-building. There was an abundance of the Calabar-bean (Physostigma venenosum), once used for an ordeal-poison, and now applied by surgery in ophthalmic and other complaints. The 'tie-tie,' as Anglo-Africans call the rope-like creepers, was also plentiful; it may prove valuable for cordage, and possibly for paper-making. I was pleased to see the ease with which the heaped-up jungle-growth is burnt at this season and the facility of road-making. Half a dozen Kru-boys with their matchets can open, at the rate of some miles a day, a path fit to carry a 'sulky;' and the ground wants only metalling with the stone which lines every stream. At the same time I hold that here, as in Mexico, we should begin with railways and tramways. Nor will there be any difficulty in keeping down the jungle. The soft and silky Bahama-grass has been brought from Sá Leone to Axim, where it covers the open spaces, and it grows well at Akankon. There is no trouble except to plant a few roots, which extend themselves afar; and the carpet when thick allows, like the orange-tree, no undergrowth.|$|E
6000|$|To {{visit the}} woods {{while they are}} languidly burning is a strange piece of experience. The fire passes through the {{underbrush}} at a run. Every {{here and there a}} tree flares up instantaneously from root to summit, scattering tufts of flame, and is quenched, it seems, as quickly. But this last is only in semblance. For after this first squib-like conflagration of the dry moss and twigs, there remains behind a deep-rooted and consuming fire in the very entrails of the tree. The resin of the <b>pitch-pine</b> is principally condensed {{at the base of the}} bole and in the spreading roots. [...] Thus, after the light, showy, skirmishing flames, which are only as the match to the explosion, have already scampered down the wind into the distance, the true harm is but beginning for this giant of the woods. You may approach the tree from one side, and see it scorched indeed from top to bottom, but apparently survivor of the peril. Make the circuit, and there, on the other side of the column, is a clear mass of living coal, spreading like an ulcer; while underground, to their most extended fibre, the roots are being eaten out by fire, and the smoke is rising through the fissures to the surface. A little while, and, without a nod of warning, the huge pine-tree snaps off short across the ground and falls prostrate with a crash. Meanwhile the fire continues its silent business; the roots are reduced to a fine ash; and long afterwards, if you pass by, you will find the earth pierced with radiating galleries, and preserving the design of all these subterranean spurs, as though it were the mould for a new tree instead of the print of an old one. These pitch-pines of Monterey are, with the single exception of the Monterey cypress, the most fantastic of forest trees. No words can give an idea of the contortion of their growth; they might figure without change in a circle of the nether hell as Dante pictured it; and at the rate at which trees grow, and at which forest fires spring up and gallop through the hills of California, we may look forward to a time when there will not be one of them left standing in that land of their nativity. At least they have not so much to fear from the axe, but perish by what may be called a natural although a violent death; while it is man in his short-sighted greed that robs the country of the nobler redwood. Yet a little while and perhaps all the hills of seaboard California may be as bald as Tamalpais.|$|E
60|$|Let us go {{into this}} deserted woodman's hut, and see how he has passed the long winter nights and the short and stormy days. For here man has lived under this south hill-side, and it seems a civilized and public spot. We have such {{associations}} as when the traveller stands by the ruins of Palmyra or Hecatompolis. Singing birds and flowers perchance have begun to appear here, for flowers as well as weeds {{follow in the footsteps}} of man. These hemlocks whispered over his head, these hickory logs were his fuel, and these <b>pitch-pine</b> roots kindled his fire; yonder fuming rill in the hollow, whose thin and airy vapor still ascends as busily as ever, though he is far off now, was his well. These hemlock boughs, and the straw upon this raised platform, were his bed, and this broken dish held his drink. But he has not been here this season, for the phoebes built their nest upon this shelf last summer. I find some embers left, as if he had but just gone out, where he baked his pot of beans; and while at evening he smoked his pipe, whose stemless bowl lies in the ashes, chatted with his only companion, if perchance he had any, about the depth of the snow on the morrow, already falling fast and thick without, or disputed whether the last sound was the screech of an owl, or the creak of a bough, or imagination only; and through this broad chimney throat, in the late winter evening, ere he stretched himself upon the straw, he looked up to learn the progress of the storm, and, seeing the bright stars of Cassiopeia's chair shining brightly down upon him, fell contentedly asleep. See how many traces from which we may learn the chopper's history. From this stump we may guess the sharpness of his axe, and, from the slope of the stroke, on which side he stood, and whether he cut down the tree without going round it or changing hands; and, from the flexure of the splinters, we may know which way it fell. This one chip contains inscribed on it the whole history of the wood-chopper and of the world. On this scrap of paper, which held his sugar or salt, perchance, or was the wadding of his gun, sitting on a log in the forest, with what interest we read the tattle of cities, of those larger huts, empty and to let, like this, in High Streets and Broadways. The eaves are dripping on the south side of this simple roof, while the titmouse lisps in the pine, and the genial warmth of the sun around the door is somewhat kind and human.|$|E

The next point, I remember, was, whether up to the time of the accident the ship had been navigated with proper and seamanlike care. They said Yes to that, goodness knows why, and then they declared that there was no evidence to show the exact cause of the accident. A floating derelict probably. I myself remember that a Norwegian barque bound out with a cargo of <b>pitch-pine</b> had been given up as missing about that time, and it was just the sort of craft that would capsize in a squall and float bottom up for months--a kind of maritime ghoul on the prowl to kill ships in the dark. Such wandering corpses are common enough in the North Atlantic, which is haunted by all the terrors of the sea,--fogs, icebergs, dead ships bent upon mischief, and long sinister gales that fasten upon one like a vampire till all the strength and the spirit and even hope are gone, and one feels like the empty shell of a man. But there--in those seas--the incident was rare enough to resemble a special arrangement of a malevolent providence, which, unless it had for its object the killing of a donkeyman and the bringing of worse than death upon Jim, appeared an utterly aimless piece of devilry. This view occurring to me took off my attention. For a time I was aware of the magistrate's voice as a sound merely; but in a moment it shaped itself into distinct words [...] "in utter disregard of their plain duty," [...] it said. The next sentence escaped me somehow, and then [...] "abandoning in the moment of danger the lives and property confided to their charge" [...] . went on the voice evenly, and stopped. A pair of eyes under the white forehead shot darkly a glance above the edge of the paper. I looked for Jim hurriedly, as though I had expected him to disappear. He was very still--but he was there. He sat pink and fair and extremely attentive. [...] "Therefore, [...] ." [...] began the voice emphatically. He stared with parted lips, hanging upon the words of the man behind the desk. These came out into the stillness wafted on the wind made by the punkahs, and I, watching for their effect upon him, caught only the fragments of official language. [...] "The Court [...] . Gustav So-and-so [...] . master [...] . native of Germany [...] . James So-and-so [...] . mate [...] . certificates cancelled." [...] A silence fell. The magistrate had dropped the paper, and, leaning sideways on the arm of his chair, began to talk with Brierly easily. People started to move out; others were pushing in, and I also made for the door. Outside I stood still, and when Jim passed me {{on his way to the}} gate, I caught at his arm and detained him. The look he gave discomposed me, as though I had been responsible for his state he looked at me as if I had been the embodied evil of life. [...] "It's all over," [...] I stammered. [...] "Yes," [...] he said thickly. [...] "And now let no man [...] ." [...] He jerked his arm out of my grasp. I watched his back as he went away. It was a long street, and he remained in sight for some time. He walked rather slow, and straddling his legs a little, as if he had found it difficult to keep a straight line. Just before I lost him I fancied he staggered a bit.|$|E
