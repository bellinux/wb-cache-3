25|$|In survey sampling, {{many of the}} {{individuals}} identified {{as part of the}} sample may be unwilling to participate, not have the time to participate (opportunity cost), or survey administrators may {{not have been able to}} contact them. In this case, there is a risk of differences, between respondents and nonrespondents, leading to biased estimates of population parameters. This is often addressed by improving survey design, offering incentives, and conducting follow-up studies which make a repeated attempt to contact the unresponsive and to characterize their similarities and differences with the rest of the frame. The effects can also be mitigated by weighting the data when population benchmarks are available or by imputing data based on answers to other questions. Nonresponse is particularly a problem in internet sampling. Reasons for this problem include improperly designed surveys, over-surveying (or survey fatigue), and the fact that <b>potential</b> <b>participants</b> hold multiple e-mail addresses, which they don't use anymore or don't check regularly.|$|E

500|$|In 1965, Southern Rhodesian Prime Minister Ian Smith and his {{mostly white}} {{government}} unilaterally declared a unilateral {{independence from the}} United Kingdom. The nation was invited to send a team to the 1968 Winter Olympics, but declined {{in the belief that}} its athletes were not sufficiently competitive. Despite political machinations from the United Kingdom, which expended considerable effort to exclude its former colony from gaining legitimacy by participating at the Games, Rhodesia was invited to participate at the 1968 Summer Olympics. The threat of an African boycott (supported by the British) of the Games, however, added further pressure from the Mexican government on the organizing committee to withdraw its invitation. Although South Africa had been barred from competing in 1964, Rhodesia's sports institutions were not de jure segregated, and thus the same rationale could not be applied. The British government also decided against adding Rhodesian Olympians to a [...] "stop-list" [...] of select Rhodesians who were banned entirely from international travel. Thus, the organizing committee used the pretense of United Nations Security Council Resolution 253, published May 29, 1968, which called on member nations to refuse to accept Rhodesian passports, to block Rhodesian athletes from participating. Although most <b>potential</b> <b>participants</b> had more than one passport, Mexico created bureaucratic delays that prevented Rhodesian athletes from attending, despite the Rhodesian government's repeated protests. Rhodesia's team had included at least nine individual athletes, a five-man yachting team, and a field hockey squad. Only two, track and field competitors Bernard Dzoma and Mathias Kanda, were not white, but both were considered medal contenders.|$|E

If the UK does exit the EU, perhaps the term will be restricted to history books. At the time of writing, ‘Brexit’ is on the tip of everyone’s tongue in Europe.|$|R

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} {{involved in}} the development of diabetes and its complications are complex, with a long list of potential derangements on different pathways (1, 2).

ACE 2, a homologue of ACE, is a monocarboxypeptidase that preferentially removes carboxy-terminal amino acids from various substrates, including Ang II, Ang I, and apelin (3 – 6). ACE 2 cleaves Ang II to form Ang-(1 - 7) with a high catalytic efficiency, suggestin...|$|R
