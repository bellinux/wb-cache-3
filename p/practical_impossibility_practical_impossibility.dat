50|$|Several monarchs {{have used}} golden coaches. These horse-drawn coaches {{were made of}} wood and covered with gold leaf, a solid golden coach would be very {{expensive}} and so heavy {{that it would be}} a <b>practical</b> <b>impossibility.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh {{how can you}} say that," [...] her visitor demanded, [...] "when {{just what}} we've most been agreed upon so often is the <b>practical</b> <b>impossibility</b> of making any change? Hasn't it seemed as if we really can't {{overcome}} conversational habits so thoroughly formed?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I next called {{attention}} to the difficulties to be faced by natives in [...] reporting irregularities. The number of civil officials is too small; [...] the <b>practical</b> <b>impossibility</b> of reaching those that do exist--the [...] native having first to ask permission of the rubber agent.|$|R
50|$|Labour did {{not have}} enough seats to combine with another party to achieve an overall majority. This made the {{formation}} of a stable government in this parliament a <b>practical</b> <b>impossibility.</b> Wilson was widely expected from the outset to call another general election before long, and this happened in October that year.|$|R
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, Voltaire's {{assessment}} of the heavy financial burden required for France's military defence of Canada and of the <b>practical</b> <b>impossibility</b> of such defence {{in the long term}} remains valid. Consequently, had he espoused a more favourable idea of the economic potential of the colony, that would likely not have changed his general conclusion.|$|R
5|$|American {{experts in}} {{military}} law {{agreed that the}} 1950 events violated {{the laws of war}} prohibiting targeting of noncombatants, but said that prosecuting ex-soldiers a half-century later was a <b>practical</b> <b>impossibility.</b> Nevertheless, Army Secretary Caldera said early in the investigation that he couldn't rule out prosecutions, a statement that survivors later complained may have deterred some 7th Cavalry veterans from testifying.|$|R
50|$|Searches for Noah's Ark {{have been}} made from at least the time of Eusebius (c.275-339 CE) to the present day. There is no {{scientific}} evidence for a global flood, and despite many expeditions, no evidence of the ark has been found. The challenges associated with housing all living animal types, and even plants, would have made building the ark a <b>practical</b> <b>impossibility.</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} a new application development process for ambient intelligence scenarios that considers security and dependability issues as core elements. It centres on the precise description of reusable security and dependability solutions (S&D solutions) {{stored in the}} form of S&D patterns. One of the main motivations of this approach is the <b>practical</b> <b>impossibility</b> for programmers to develop sound complex security services for their applications. 1...|$|R
60|$|Also {{they manage}} various Homes for drunken women. It {{has always been}} {{supposed}} to be a <b>practical</b> <b>impossibility</b> to effect a cure in such cases, but the lady Officers of the Salvation Army succeed in turning about 50 per cent of their patients into perfectly sober persons. At least they remain sober for three years from the date of their discharge, after which they are often followed no further.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{inherent}} {{flexibility of}} a liquid container is usually {{treated as a}} problem since achieving a perfectly rigid container is <b>practical</b> <b>impossibility.</b> On the other hand container flexibility {{may be used as}} design parameter in control of free surface oscillations. Intentional container flexibility has been employed in this research to suppress excessive levels of liquid sloshing. This paper outlines numerical predictions for simulation of liquid sloshing in a flexible container and its design alternatives while maintaining effective control...|$|R
50|$|Even in {{a design}} that is {{intended}} to be synchronously tuned, some staggered tuning effect is inevitable because of the <b>practical</b> <b>impossibility</b> of keeping all tuned circuits perfectly in step and because of feedback effects. This can be a problem in very narrow band applications where essentially only one spot frequency is of interest, such as a local oscillator feed or a wave trap. The overall gain of a synchronously tuned amplifier will always be less than the theoretical maximum because of this.|$|R
50|$|Liverpool's league form {{improved}} as {{they managed}} wins over West Ham United, Notts County and Tottenham Hotspur, but were defeated by Crystal Palace and Sheffield United, ensuring that they ended the month {{no higher than}} fourth in the league. The title was still a mathematical possibility as they trailed leaders Manchester United by 12 points with seven games remaining {{at the end of}} the month, but it now appeared a <b>practical</b> <b>impossibility</b> and Liverpool's efforts were now better focused on FA Cup success.|$|R
5000|$|The great {{commercial}} success {{of both the}} album and the single prompted La Düsseldorf to perform in concert, something which they had avoided up until then due to their musics heavily overdubbed nature {{and the fact that}} Klaus played all instruments except drums, making concerts a <b>practical</b> <b>impossibility.</b> Nevertheless, they made several TV appearances in which they mimed their performances. A recording of their [...] "performance" [...] of Rheinita at a free concert in Düsseldorf in 1979 is widely available on the internet.|$|R

50|$|After consideration, the {{multiple}} arch type was chosen. One {{of the factors}} influencing this decision was the bedrock condition at the site. The bedrock is a calcareous shale not entirely watertight and of a nature to decompose somewhat under exposure to air and water. The advantages of {{the multiple}} arch type in this connection {{were considered to be}} the practical elimination of upward pressure, the <b>practical</b> <b>impossibility</b> of overturning or sliding on its base and the ready facilities for internal inspection of the dam at any time.|$|R

I was able {{in a little}} while to get to an {{understanding}} with them, and at last to elucidate what has been a puzzle to me ever since I realised the vastness of their science, namely, how it is they themselves have never discovered 'Cavorite.' I find they know of it as a theoretical substance, but they have always regarded it as a <b>practical</b> <b>impossibility,</b> because for some reason there is no helium in the moon, and helium..." ...|$|R
40|$|A {{finite element}} {{technique}} for determination of elastic crack tip stress intensity factors is presented. The method, {{based on the}} energy release rate, requires no special crack tip elements. Further, the solution for only a single crack length is required, and the crack is 'advanced' by moving nodal points rather than by removing nodal tractions at the crack tip and performing a second analysis. The promising straightforward extension of the method to general three-dimensional crack configurations is presented and contrasted with the <b>practical</b> <b>impossibility</b> of conventional energy methods...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Physical Uncloneable Functions (PUF) are systems whose {{physical}} {{behavior to}} different inputs {{can be measured}} reliably, yet cannot be cloned in a physical replica. Existing designs propose to derive uncloneability from an assumed <b>practical</b> <b>impossibility</b> of exactly replicating inherent manufacturing variations, e. g., between individual chipset instances. The PUF promise has drawn significant attention lately and numerous researchers have proposed to use PUFs for various security assurances ranging from authentication to software licensing. In this paper we survey the history of PUFs {{as well as the}} existing body of research proposing applications thereof. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} new simple method of {{construction}} of infinite number of solutions of Freidmann equations from the already known ones, which allows for a startling conclusion of <b>practical</b> <b>impossibility</b> of correct predictions on the universe's future dynamics which are based solely on astronomical observations {{on the value of}} a scale factor. In addition, we present particular examples of newly constructed solutions, such as the ones, describing the smooth dynamical (de) -phantomization, and the models lacking the events horizons (both in classical and brane world cases) ...|$|R
40|$|In the {{information}} interpretation of quantum mechanics, information {{is the most}} fundamental, basic entity. Every quantized system {{is associated with a}} definite discrete amount of information (cf. Zeilinger). This information content remains constant at all times and is permutated one-to-one throughout the system evolution. What is interpreted as measurement is a particular type of information transfer over a fictitious interface. The concept of a many-to-one state reduction is not a fundamental one but results from the <b>practical</b> <b>impossibility</b> to reconstruct the original state after the measurement.

5000|$|Consequently, {{microkernel}} designs {{have been}} used for systems designed for high-security applications, including KeyKOS, EROS and military systems. In fact common criteria (CC) at the highest assurance level (Evaluation Assurance Level (EAL) 7) has an explicit requirement that the target of evaluation be [...] "simple", an acknowledgment of the <b>practical</b> <b>impossibility</b> of establishing true trustworthiness for a complex system. Unfortunately, again, the term [...] "simple" [...] is misleading and ill-defined. At least the Department of Defense Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria introduced somewhat more precise verbiage at the B3/A1 classes: ...|$|R
5|$|Wife {{selling in}} England {{was a way}} of ending an {{unsatisfactory}} marriage by mutual agreement that probably began in the late 17th century, when divorce was a <b>practical</b> <b>impossibility</b> for all but the very wealthiest. After parading his wife with a halter around her neck, arm, or waist, a husband would publicly auction her to the highest bidder. Wife selling provides the backdrop for Thomas Hardy's novel The Mayor of Casterbridge, in which the central character sells his wife {{at the beginning of the}} story, an act that haunts him for the rest of his life, and ultimately destroys him.|$|R
50|$|Condor of Bermuda was a maxi yacht campaigning {{under the}} {{leadership}} and funding of London-based international businessman Bob Bell. Originally called Condor but renamed Heath's Condor for the 1977-78 Whitbread Round the World Race after Bell's association with Heath's Insurance Co (London). There is no link with former British Prime Minister Edward Heath of Morning Cloud yachting fame. Condor was then later renamed Condor of Bermuda, as government policy in the UK during the 1970s effectively exiled the financing of such a campaign by making the funding and domiciling of such an endeavour from the home countries a <b>practical</b> <b>impossibility.</b>|$|R
40|$|The editing {{of medieval}} alchemical texts poses {{a number of}} {{challenges}} to the modern scholar. Problems such as the lack of source identification, complicated compositional structures, and a tendency toward intentionally obfuscatory language make the task of reconstructing the original letter of text a <b>practical</b> <b>impossibility.</b> This paper will argue that an alternative approach toward editing alchemical texts must be considered. This approach {{will be determined by}} focusing on issues related to the technical lexicon of practical alchemy, and in particular, to the problems related {{to the understanding of the}} words used by the alchemists for describing the substances used in their operations...|$|R
50|$|VARTAMAAN {{explores the}} dilemma of a common man in India, wherein he often finds himself caught between {{corruption}} and honesty. There is a character in the film whose personality has been modeled on social activist Anna Hazare. The film's message is that while it has become fashionable in India to support Anna Hazare's stand against corruption, {{how many of us}} are actually honest? The film takes a deeper look into the <b>practical</b> <b>impossibility</b> of living an honest life in India. The film has been written and directed by writer-director Manish Gupta known for writing 'Sarkar' and directing 'The Stoneman Murders' and 'Hostel'.|$|R

40|$|Price {{discrimination}} offers sellers {{the possibility}} of increasing revenue by capturing a market’s consumer surplus: arising from the low price elasticity segment of customers {{that would have been}} prepared to pay more than the current market price. First degree price discrimination requires a seller to know the maximum (reserve) price that each consumer is willing to pay. Discouragingly, this information is often unavailable; making the theoretical ideal a <b>practical</b> <b>impossibility.</b> Electronic commerce offers a solution; with loyalty cards, transaction statements and online accounts all providing channels of customer monitoring. The vast amount of data generated–eBay alone produces terabytes daily–creates an invaluable repository of information that, if used intelligently...|$|R
30|$|To avoid long {{computation}} times, {{the electric}} forces in an ITER calculation are often {{stored in a}} number of look-up tables for different (possibly all) ion configurations in the system [18 – 20]. This approach has two major drawbacks: (i) the loss in accuracy due to the need to interpolate between look-up table entries; (ii) the <b>practical</b> <b>impossibility</b> to determine potential for asymmetric charge distributions due to extremely large memory requirements. ICC is not subject to these kind of problems since it can rapidly solve Poisson's equation for any charge distribution without lookup tables. Due to its accuracy and computation speed, ICC appears well suited for the simulation of nano-scale discrete-charge physical systems.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} case study of {{hardware}} specification and verification in the Nuprl Proof Development System. Within Nuprl we have built a specialized environment consisting of tactics, definitions, and theorems for specifying and reasoning about hardware. Such reasoning typically consists of term-rewriting, case-analysis, induction, and arithmetic reasoning. We have built tools that provide high-level assistance for these tasks. The hardware component that we have proven is the front end of a floating-point adder/subtractor. This component, the MAEC (Mantissa Adjuster and Exponent Calculator), has 5459 transistors and has been proven down to the transistor level. As the circuit has 118 inputs and 107 outputs, verification by traditional methods such as case analysis would have been a <b>practical</b> <b>impossibility...</b>|$|R
40|$|Understanding the {{molecular}} basis of parasitism, particularly that linked to human disease, {{is one of}} the most important frontiers in biology. A major impediment to the direct analysis of the genes of nematode and platyhelminth parasites is the <b>practical</b> <b>impossibility</b> of investigating their function with any of the genetic methods used so effectively for many multicellular model organisms and unicellular parasites. Emerging 'post-genomic' techniques have been developed to study gene function both directly and indirectly in nematode and flatworm parasites, and can use the information from the parasite genome projects. Among these, the reverse genetic technique of RNA interference could be most effective in determining the function of genes essential to parasite survival and hence uncovering novel therapeutic targets...|$|R
40|$|The case {{of cardiac}} biventricular {{resynchronization}} without {{destruction of the}} atrio-ventricular node in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) and permanent atrial fibrillation (AF) is described. The observation period was 14 months. The case demonstrates that biventricular resynchronization for severe heart failure with atrial fibrillation and significant atria size with theoretical and <b>practical</b> <b>impossibility</b> of its’ transforming into the long-term persistent atrial fibrillation is a reasonable alternative of atrio-ventricular pacing. Though {{the destruction of the}} atrio-ventricular node can be delayed for a significant period of time, it should be done at the earliest opportunity. Pacemaker implantation does not cancel medical therapy, with the necessity for the latter to be according to the conducted biventricular pacing...|$|R
50|$|Life for {{refugees}} in Canada Camp was particularly hard, {{as they were}} cut off from work in both Gaza and Israel, and unable to work in Egypt, in fact, they had to pay every six months to have their Egyptian visas renewed. Family and friends, unable {{to see each other}} due to the <b>practical</b> <b>impossibility</b> of gaining the necessary permits, could only communicate at the “shouting fence” across the border strip. higher education and proper health care were only available by paying fees much higher than most people could afford. For treatment of serious medical problems, Canada Camp residents would have to pay locally or travel to the Palestine Red Crescent Hospital in Cairo.|$|R
5000|$|A {{difficulty}} that immediately arises is the <b>practical</b> <b>impossibility</b> of devising {{a mechanism for}} distributing the proceeds to copyright holders that is considered [...] "fair" [...] by all copyright holders and consumers. Implemented systems are typically restricted to music and may distribute the proceeds proportionally to a measurement of sales of CDs in music shops or amount of air-play on radio or the like. This ignores other distribution channels such as the Internet, and it disproportionally benefits popular artists and publishers of the related products. Fairer methods would arguably involve extensive sampling of purchasers to determine actual recording behaviour, or alternatively paying all musicians at a simple flat-rate (the preferred method will depend on one's political views).|$|R
50|$|This is an unpretentious book, but {{it brings}} out with unusual {{clearness}} the dilemma that faces every official in an empire like our own. Mr. Collis was District Magistrate of Rangoon in the troubled period round about 1930. He {{had to try}} cases which were {{a great deal in}} the public eye, and he soon discovered the <b>practical</b> <b>impossibility</b> of keeping to {{the letter of the law}} and pleasing European opinion at the same time. Finally, for having sentenced a British Army officer to three months' imprisonment for criminal negligence in driving a car, he was reprimanded and hurriedly transferred to another post. For the same offence a native would have been imprisoned as a matter of course.|$|R
