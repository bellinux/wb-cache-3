40|$|We {{present a}} method for reconstructing global ocean {{bathymetry}} that combines a standard <b>plate</b> <b>cooling</b> model <b>for</b> the oceanic lithosphere based on {{the age of the}} oceanic crust, global oceanic sediment thicknesses, plus generalized shelf-slope-rise structures calibrated at modern active and passive continental margins. Our motivation is to develop a methodology for reconstructing ocean bathymetry in the geologic past that includes heterogeneous continental margins in addition to abyssal ocean floor. First, the <b>plate</b> <b>cooling</b> model is applied to maps of ocean crustal age to calculate depth to basement. To the depth to basement we add an isostatically adjusted, multicomponent sediment layer constrained by sediment thickness in the modern oceans and marginal seas. A three-parameter continental shelf-slope-rise structure completes the bathymetry reconstruction, extending from the ocean crust to the coastlines. Parameters of the shelf-slope-rise structures at active and passive margins are determined from modern ocean bathymetry at locations where a complete history of seafloor spreading is preserved. This includes the coastal regions of the North, South, and central Atlantic, the Southern Ocean between Australia and Antarctica, and the Pacific Ocean off the west coast of South America.

Two detectors (the AMS on the International Space Station and the LHCb at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN) have been equipped with CO 2 cooling; many more particle detectors are considering it for the future. The <b>cooling</b> <b>fluid</b> <b>for</b> detectors must be radiation hard, therefore normal refrigerants cannot be used. Up to now most detectors were cooled with fluorocarbons in both single and two-phase. Evaporative CO 2 has proven to be superior with respect to the fluorocarbon refrigerants used now. In detectors it is highly important to have very low mass structures, as mass deviates the particle tracks which need to be measured accurately. CO 2 cooling is superior in small cooling channels. Therefore, cooling channels with CO 2 can be made much smaller than fluorocarbon channels, gaining at least a factor of 5 in applied cooling systems mass.
