5000|$|It was on July 26, 2013 {{when the}} band posted on their Facebook the {{following}} message regarding the band's plan to disband."As the saying goes, [...] "all {{good things in}} life must come to an end". As one chapter finishes, the next begins. We are announcing that we are laying Letter To The Exiles to rest. The four {{of us have been}} talking, praying, and reflecting on this decision and have collectively all agreed it's time to close this chapter out and begin the next in life. We all have jobs/careers and a lot going on in life {{and we are going to}} move on to life post-LTTE. The four of us have been able to live out our dream thanks to this band, tour the country countless times, play internationally, meet tons of amazing people and make lifetime memories. We wouldn't trade our memories for anything. Music is in our blood, and therefore all of us will still be involved with music/bands in different facets. ... Thanks to all of our fans, bands we've played with, promoters, haters, past members, Jason and the Facedown staff, and anyone we've come into contact with because of this band. It's been a true <b>pleasure.</b> <b>See</b> <b>you</b> on the flip side." ...|$|E

5000|$|Also in 1861, Gandolfo did a painting, now lost, {{titled the}} Triumph of Italy that was {{inspired}} by country's recent independence. It resulted in his discovery as an artist. The picture was seen and appreciated by King Vittorio Emanuele II who, impressed with the talent of the young artist, wanted to pose for him, receiving a portrait painted extemporaneously in pen and ink. The king also offered him a government pension that Gandolfo refused. Giosuè Carducci also noticed the artistic qualities of Gandolfo and became an important friend. Thus, {{at the end of}} 1861 when the young artist returned to Catania, Carducci wrote to him: “If you go in the new season to Florence for studies and you remain there, I will easily have the <b>pleasure</b> to <b>see</b> <b>you</b> again next summer: a pleasure that I eagerly hasten with my thought.

[...] The dog, hearing his name, rose and shook himself. Zo pointed to him, with an appearance of the deepest interest.
