The justification was that individuals usually <b>put</b> <b>more</b> <b>money</b> into investments {{when the economy is}} doing well, but they put most of their money into savings accounts when the economy turns bad. With the new Act, {{they would be able to}} do both 'savings' and 'investment' at the same financial institution, which would be able to do well in both good and bad economic times.|$|E

The number of {{enterprises}} increased from 600–700 in 1762 to over 2,000 when her reign ended. Russian agriculture grew during Catherine's reign due to the economic pressure put upon the gentry that needed more wealth in order to indulge in Western European tastes. The gentry used potentially arable land in old areas {{as well as new}} land on the peripheries of the empire. This expansion occurred during the 1780s and 90s.|$|E

Citing concerns that the augmentation of unemployment insurance may obligate the state {{to raise taxes on}} businesses, Jindal had indicated his intention to forgo federal stimulus plan funds ($98 million) aimed at increasing unemployment insurance for Louisiana. Louisiana has since been obligated to raise taxes on businesses because the unemployment trust fund had dropped below the prescribed threshold. Louisiana was set to receive about $3.8 billion overall. Jindal intends to accept at least $2.4 billion from the stimulus package. He called parts of the plan [...] "irresponsible", saying that [...] "the way to lead is not to raise taxes and <b>put</b> <b>more</b> <b>money</b> and power in hands of Washington politicians." ...|$|E

The Dodgers celebrated the Golden Anniversary of Dodger Stadium, their home since 1962.

Backers of the taxi apps, Tencent and Alibaba are rivals with China's biggest search engine Baidu, who is funding Uber to fight Didi Dache. While Baidu is competing against Didi Dache with Uber, Baidu is also fighting against Alibaba and Tencent directly. Didi ultimately acquired Uber's China operations in July 2016.|$|R
