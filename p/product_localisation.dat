40|$|Indian retail {{as one of}} {{the major}} {{sub-sectors}} in services industry is going through a transition phase. In such context, the proposed research aims to provide a comprehensive framework for the various important retail enablers in India. A combined approach of interpretive structural modelling and fuzzy MICMAC is adopted to identify and classify the key enabling factors based on their direct and indirect relationship. Based upon the literature survey and expert opinion 13 key enabling factors have been identified. Thirteen identified factors are government policies/regulations, supply chain, management commitment, location of store, image of the store, consumer culture, availability of skilled manpower, technology adoption, globalisation/competition, <b>product</b> <b>localisation,</b> real estate/infrastructure, workforce management and value conscious consumers. The MICMAC analysis reveals that four of these factors can be classified as independent, three factors as linkage and six factors are classified as dependent. However no factor is classified as autonomous. The fuzzy MICMAC shows that four factors can be classified as independent, nine factors as linkage and no factor is classified as autonomous and dependent. Based on this classification companies can devise marketing strategies across the retail value chain to become successful.

We prove that given an orthogonal decomposition of the unit in the rational Burnside ring, the model category of rational equivariant spectra decomposes into a <b>product</b> of <b>localisations.</b> We use this result to reprove the classification of rational equivariant cohomology theories for finite groups and to study such cohomology theories for the group O(2). We then concentrate on a split piece of the O(2) case and relate it to rational SO(2) equivariant spectra...|$|R
40|$|This book explores how {{the process}} of {{adapting}} global products for local markets, {{a process in which}} consumers are increasingly involved, has become a rich source of product innovation. It examines a range of concepts, including <b>product</b> domestication and <b>localisation,</b> collaborative branding, <b>product</b> hybridisation, portrayals and perceptions of images of beauty, and the contrast between imagined and actual consumers. The book thereby provides rich insights on the interaction between business producers and individuals’ differing cultures of consumption in evolving globalised and localised marketplaces...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} video game localisation in MMORPG video game that focusing on {{the freedom of the}} translator in transferring meaning in the in-game text assets of video games. Games, regardless of their forms, are the media of entertainments. Foreign audiences may have different expectations on how they wish to be entertained. They most certainly have their own canon of cultural references that they will put into relation to any content of the game. Localization has to take all these things into account, and subsequently the localization process can involve the addition, removal or replacement of elements of the <b>product.</b> Game <b>localisation</b> allows translators to transcreate the things that are necessary to preserve the game experience and to produce a fresh and engaging translation. In this paper, the writers cast a spotlight on translators, progressing from our analysis focused on games as translation texts and as products. The result of this paper shows about how the translator used the freedom of the translator or the degree of creativity that they may have when adapting the game. Concisely, the more complex and creative a storyline, the more useful transcreation may turn in the translation process...|$|R
40|$|New products, while essential, are {{risky and}} {{expensive}} for subsidiaries. The main {{objective of this}} research is to determine success factors for new product launch (NPL) by subsidiaries operating in developing countries. It is argued that localisation of NPL decisions contributes positively to new product superiority and commercial performance, with partial least squares used to test the hypothesis. The results show that localisation of innovation decisions increases localisation of branding and commercialisation decisions in the local market. However, localisation of commercialisation decisions positively influences new <b>product</b> superiority, while <b>localisation</b> of innovation decisions reduces this superiority. Finally, hypothesis testing reveals that localisation of commercial decisions and new product superiority both increase the commercial performance of new products in the local market...|$|R
40|$|In this study, the {{relationship}} between external scale economies (agglomeration economies) and productivity is measured by using Turkish data. The productivity increase can be due to economies from locating closer to other firms in either the same industry (localisation economies) or different industries (urbanisation economies). Localisation economies are proxied by own industry size and urbanisation economies by city population. Productivity (output per worker) is regressed on industry size, city population, and other related variables. A measure of concentration of state enterprises {{is included in the}} regressions to control for the possible inefficiencies in public sector firms. The functional form of the estimating equations is derived from the translog production function. As a check, a constant elasticity of substitution (CES) form is also experimented with. Data are cross-section data and come from industrial and production surveys conducted by the State Institute of Statistics of Turkey in 1985. The study finds that agglomeration economies that are robust across different specifications of the agglomeration economy function and production function exist in food products, textiles, and wood products. Urbanisation economies are detected in food products and textiles. In wood <b>products</b> there are <b>localisation</b> economies. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the influence that marketing has on teenagers and their development of identity and question the ethical implications of this influence. It aims to explore the extrinsic identity and the intrinsic identity using Erikson’s model of identity versus role confusion; to identify passive and active personality types within adolescents; and to establish the importance of local community compared with web-based communities. The views of developmental theorists are discussed and correlations between teenagers characterised as active; those who would be identified as being “cool”, and passive characters; those lacking “cool” are drawn. This is then applied to the theories of the self and the empty self, a concept arguably used by marketers who wish to encourage notions of the empty self through negative references to being uncool, with the aim of stimulating a demand for the cool sustenance that they supply. Data were gathered from a questionnaire survey comprising 79 secondary school teenage pupils. The findings, though limited to only one locality, show that the majority of the sample was identified as being passive, implying that the majority of these teenagers were aspirational in their quest for cool. In addition, more of the participants felt a part of web-based communities such as Bebo than of their local community. The study suggests that marketers, ethically or otherwise, are able to target the passive majority by encouraging feelings of being un-cool encouraging the empty self to then profit from the sales of a cool fulfilling <b>product.</b> The <b>localisation</b> and survey sample size impose limitations on the generalisation of the findings for a national or even a regional location. Also, the primary research provides only a snap shot of the tastes and personality traits of individuals taking part in the survey at that point in time that are susceptible to change as is the definition of cool. However, the evaluation of the findings offer some interesting and valuable indications of support and contradictions to the theories discussed. Through an understanding of the strength of the influence marketing has on a teenage demographic and the importance that the teenagers surveyed attached to social network sites,some indication is given of the quest for identity of the youths of today in a UK locality. This study therefore provides a small but valuable stepping stone for a much larger investigation of this concept on a regional or national scale...|$|R
40|$|Surveys {{carried out}} in {{international}} insurance markets, including New Zealand, indicate that there is considerable diversity in the levels of voluntary disclosure made by companies in their annual reports. Critics argue that such disparity diminishes the stewardship and decision-usefulness value of annual reports for users such as policyholders, shareholders and industry regulators. However, a major deficiency with the prior surveys {{is that they do}} not explain the different reporting practices observed in insurance markets. Drawing a framework from the managerial-discretion hypothesis, this thesis thus seeks to explain the level of information voluntarily disclosed in the annual reports of New Zealand-based life insurance companies. The managerial-discretion hypothesis holds that the diffused nature of policyholders' ownership rights in mutuals makes it more difficult for them to monitor and control managerial behaviour compared with the relatively more closely-held shareholdings of stock companies. In such a situation, policyholders are likely to control managerial discretion across a range of business activities by means of restrictive mechanisms such as internal regulations. The relationship between the level of voluntary disclosure and eight explanatory variables - organisational form, assets-in-place, <b>product</b> concentration, reinsurance, <b>localisation</b> of operations, non-executive directors, firm size and distribution system - each representing the major constructs of the managerial-discretion hypothesis, is tested empirically in this study using data-triangulation. This methodology comprises a statistical analysis of pooled 1988 - 1993 data drawn from New Zealand's life insurance industry as well as an evaluation of field interviews and documentation obtained from 12 companies representing a cross-section of the industry. Data-triangulation helps to test the validity of the constructs used and evaluate the reliability of the evidence collected. Consistent with what was hypothesised, the empirical results indicate that the level of information voluntarily disclosed by life insurance companies in their annual reports is positively associated with stock companies, firm size, product diversity and reliance on independent sales agents/brokers. Contrary to expectations, the evidence suggest that non-executive directors complement rather than substitute for voluntary disclosure. Also contrary to what was hypothesised, the statistical analysis indicate that reinsurance had a positive influence on voluntary disclosure, but this observation was not supported by the fieldwork. Furthermore, two variables - assets-in-place and localisation of operations - were found not to be important determinants of voluntary disclosure in both the statistical analysis and field-based research. The study thus provides mixed support for the managerial-discretion hypothesis. The field-based research also reveals that other factors such as company culture and market competition could be important determinants of voluntary disclosure. Finally, a major contribution {{of this study is that}} the empirical results could assist industry regulators to better understand the disclosure practices of life insurance companies and so enable them to gauge the likely success of new reporting rules...|$|R
40|$|The {{neuronal}} ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs, Batten disease) are a {{group of}} fatal inherited lysosomal storage diseases characterised by progressive neurodegeneration, cortical atrophy, and blindness. Currently there are no effective treatments. Naturally occurring animal models exist, including two forms in sheep which {{are representative of the}} different NCL protein defects. A lesion in a soluble lysosomal protein (CLN 5) causes NCL in Borderdale sheep, whilst South Hampshire sheep have a defective intracellular endoplasmic reticulum membrane-bound protein (CLN 6). This subdivision has consequences for the planning of therapies. This thesis compares the progressive neuropathological changes, and examines the efficacy of viral-mediated in vivo gene therapy, in these two NCL sheep models. An immunohistochemical study revealed that, despite very different gene <b>products</b> and subcellular <b>localisations,</b> the pathogenic cascade was remarkably similar for CLN 5 and CLN 6 affected sheep. Dysregulated glial activation preceded regionally specific neurodegeneration in both disease models and both occurred well before clinical onset. Neuropathological changes were more advanced in the CLN 5 model, which correlated with the earlier onset of clinical symptoms in these sheep, but by end-stage disease CLN 5 and CLN 6 brains were similarly affected. Windows for best therapeutic efficacy were established and these data highlight the translational utility of the sheep brain for testing human gene therapies. Lentiviral vectors have been shown to mediate successful gene delivery to the ovine brain yet the efficacy of adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors has not been tested in sheep. Stable, predominantly neurotropic, transgene expression was evident one month after intracerebroventricular (ICV) and intraparenchymal (IP) delivery of AAV 9 to the normal sheep brain. However with a greater spread and no evidence of vector or procedural neuroinflammation or toxicity, the ICV approach proved most efficacious in sheep. vi Deficiencies in soluble lysosomal proteins are deemed particularly amenable to in vivo gene therapy via the normal lysosomal enzyme trafficking system and the phenomenon of ‘cross-correction’. To test this paradigm in sheep, six pre-clinical CLN 5 deficient lambs were treated with combinatorial ICV and IP injections of either lentiviral or AAV 9 vectors expressing ovine CLN 5. Both vector platforms afforded sustained protection against stereotypical disease in these sheep. Cognitive and neurological function was preserved, whilst longitudinal neuroimaging revealed normalisation of intracranial volume and structural brain integrity. Quality of life was profoundly improved for the treated sheep and, apart from delayed-onset visual deficits, treated sheep well exceeded the typical lifespan of untreated animals. Defects in membrane-bound proteins are generally considered harder therapeutic targets. However the current study indicates that gene therapy is also possible for these NCL forms. Whilst five similarly injected pre-clinical CLN 6 deficient sheep developed stereotypical CLN 6 disease, one AAV 9 -CLN 6 treated animal was clinically indistinguishable from age-matched control animals through the 24 -month follow up period. Post mortem neuropathological studies revealed significant correction of neurodegeneration, normal cortical laminar organisation and a reversal in disease-associated glial activation. These encouraging results of sustained therapeutic and functional efficacy in large animal models of NCL provide a strong rationale for the clinical translation of viral-mediated gene transfer to human patients with CLN 5 and CLN 6 disease. In fact, the findings of this thesis have encouraged a Phase I/II CLN 6 clinical trial which has just begun...|$|R
