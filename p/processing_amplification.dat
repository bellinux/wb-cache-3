In 454 pyrosequencing data sets, {{the abundance of}} reads pertaining to taxa or phylotypes is commonly interpreted {{as a measure of}} genic or taxon abundance, useful for quantitative comparisons of community similarity. Potentially systematic biases inherent in sample <b>processing,</b> <b>amplification</b> and sequencing, however, may alter read abundance and reduce the utility of quantitative metrics. Here, we examine the relationship between read abundance and biological abundance in a sample of house dust spiked with known quantities and identities of fungi along a dilution gradient. Our results show one order of magnitude differences in read abundance among species. Precision of quantification within species along the dilution gradient varied from R 2 of 0. 96 – 0. 54. Read-quality based processing stringency profoundly affected the abundance of one species containing long homopolymers in a read orientation-biased manner. Order-level composition of background environmental fungal communities determined from pyrosequencing data was comparable with that derived from cloning and Sanger sequencing and was not biased by read orientation. We conclude that read abundance is approximately quantitative within species, but betweenspecies comparisons can be biased by innate sequence structure. Our results showed a trade off between sequence quality stringency and quantification. Careful consideration of sequence processing methods and community analyses are warranted when testing hypotheses using read abundance data...|$|E

40|$|The use of rapid-cycle PCR {{combined}} with colorimetric microwell hybridization for detecting Bordetella pertussis was investigated. Rapid cycling was performed {{with an air}} thermocycler (model 1605; Idaho Technology, Idaho Falls, Idaho). Although the instrument was originally designed {{to be used with}} capillary tubes, an adapter that allows this instrument to be used with PCR tubes has recently been introduced. Because of the low heat capacity of air, the thermocycler has rapid transition rates between temperatures. The combination of a rapid temperature transition rate, small sample volume (10 microliters), and overshooting or undershooting of the temperature set points allowed the cycles to be reduced to 5 s for denaturation and 10 s for extension and annealing. Thus, the amplification could be completed in a total of approximately 35 min. Amplified DNA was detected with biotin-labeled primers and by hybridization to a capture probe immobilized in microwell plates. When simulated clinical specimens consisting of pooled nasopharyngeal washes with known numbers of B. pertussis organisms were examined by this procedure, as little as one organism per 5 microliters of sample could be detected. Six nasopharyngeal aspirates or washes from culture-positive patients were positive by PCR, as were two of seven specimens obtained from patients that were negative by culture and direct fluorescent-antibody assay. The two patients who were PCR positive but culture and direct fluorescent-antibody assay negative had clinical disease compatible with pertussis.

The limits are investigated with regard to maximum unregenerated transmission distances for linear propagation over single mode fibre with large chromatic dispersion. Overall, {{the aim is to}} minimise the bandwidth requirements of electronic and opto—electronic system components for a given optical line capacity whilst at the same time maximising the chromatic dispersion limited propagation distances, thus exploring the potential for future system and network operating speeds of several tens of Gbit/s. A summary of standard system designs and their performance in terms of maximum system speed and dispersive fibre propagation provides an introduction into the field of high performance fibre optic data communication systems. Particular examples are used to introduce the device models subsequently employed in the analysis of new system configurations. This includes a description of the system performance measurements which are the basis for the performance analyses of the proposed ultra—high speed systems. In the field of fibre transmission research a variety of electrical interface and optical line signal formats are being investigated, each being appropriate for particular application areas and offering varying compromises between performance, complexity and user friendliness. In the context of this thesis the investigations are limited to high capacity time division multiplexed configurations, which represent a medium to longer term alternative as well as a complementary approach to the currently widely pursued system capacity upgrades by means of optical wavelength or frequency division multiplexing. Moreover, ultra—high speed time division multiplexed transmission is fundamentally compatible with WDM system operation, providing a future upgrade path for multi—wavelength systems being developed at the present time. The vehicle for these investigations is a set of computer models. Optical signal generation, pulse propagation in single—mode fibre, optical time domain <b>processing,</b> <b>amplification</b> and optical receiver detection are all included in the models to allow end—to—end system performance studies.

40|$|The {{motivation}} of this thesis originated from {{the challenge of}} building high-speed underwater optical communication links. Since current optical communication technologies cannot be directly applied to the sea water transmission window (480 - 560 nm) due to the significant loss, a solution was pursued by building an optical mixer that can translate the modulation from conventional optical communication window (1550 nm) to the visible spectral window, using parametric conversion based on photonic crystal fiber (PCF) platform. The thesis therefore mainly focuses on {{the investigation of the}} near- infrared band to visible band parametric translation process, both experimentally and theoretically. We, for the first time, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, successfully demonstrated Gb/s both amplitude and phase modulation translation across the record 400 THz optical spectrum with error-free performance. At the same time, we achieved the record conversion efficiency for such distant band translation in the PCF. We also, for the first time, identified and characterized the impairment mechanisms of the parametric conversion process in the PCF. The mathematical methods and fiber design process are developed for PCF calculation and PCF fiber design. Proper fiber structure was designed for optimizing parametric phase matching and addressing the impairment mechanisms. The idea of optical mixer is not confined to the NIR-to- visible translation application and can be extended to other applications such that the complex transmission, <b>processing,</b> <b>amplification</b> and reception technologies are accessible to arbitrary spectral bands as well, by translating the telecom-band signal to arbitrary optical bands, which is particularly useful and has found important applications in the fields of sensing, spectroscopy, atmospheric communication and so on, detailed in the thesis. The thesis is divided into seven chapters. Chapter 1 serves as the introduction of the thesis, discussing in detail the motivation and the background knowledge including the current relevant technologies and the rationality of our technologies. The content and structure of the thesis are also briefed in Chapter 1. In Chapter 2, we study the parametric conversion within the telecom band using step-index highly nonlinear fibers (HNLF). One-pump and two-pump structures are compared and the differences between the two structures are quantified. In Chapter 3, we discuss the PCF, focusing on its guiding property and dispersion engineering feature. We also develop mathematical tools for PCF transverse structure calculation in this chapter. In Chapter 4, we characterize the parametric translation process from the telecom band to the visible band in PCF. For the first time, to the best of our knowledge, we have demonstrated Gb/s amplitude and phase translation from the telecom band to the visible band with error-free performance. The impairment mechanisms are identified, quantified and simulated. In Chapter 5, we perform the PCF structure design that aims for optimized phase matching condition and at the same time, address or mitigate the impairment mechanisms discussed in chapter 4. In Chapter 6, parametric translation from the telecom band to the middle -wavelength infrared band was studied, using Chalcogeinde glass fibers.

40|$|The {{application}} of DNA fingerprinting {{has become very}} broad in forensic analysis, patient identification, diagnostic medicine, and wildlife poaching, since every individual`s DNA structure is identical within all tissues of their body. DNA fingerprinting was initiated {{by the use of}} restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP). In 1987, Nakamura et al. found that a variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) often occurred in the alleles. The probability of different individuals having the same number of tandem repeats in several different alleles is very low. Thus, the identification of VNTR from genomic DNA became a very reliable method for identification of individuals. DNA fingerprinting is a reliable tool for forensic analysis. In DNA fingerprinting, knowledge of the sequence of tandem repeats and restriction endonuclease sites can provide the basis for identification. The major steps for conventional DNA fingerprinting include (1) specimen <b>processing</b> (2) <b>amplification</b> of selected DNA segments by PCR, and (3) gel electrophoresis to do the final DNA analysis.

40|$|Graduation date: 2002 More {{than half}} of the {{recognized}} genera of positive strand RNA viruses employ polyprotein processing as one of the strategies for their genome expression. Normally, this processing is mediated by virus-encoded proteinases that belong to the trypsin-like or papain-like family. In particular, papain-like, leader proteinases were found in diverse families of human, animal, plant, and fungal positive strand RNA viruses. In addition to autocatalytic processing, these proteinases play a variety of roles in the virus life cycle. In plant potyviruses, a papain-like helper component-proteinase (HC-Pro) was implicated in genome amplification, cell-to-cell movement, long distance transport, and suppression of host defense. The p 29 proteinase encoded by a fungal hypovirus CHV 1 was found to be dispensable for virus replication, but it was identified as a major determinant of viral pathogenicity. In an animal equine aterivirus (EAV), a papain-like proteinase nspl was demonstrated to possess a putative zinc finger domain, which functions in subgenomic RNA synthesis, although it is not essential for virus replication. The Lab proteinase of the foot and mouse disease virus (FMDV) is involved in inhibition of cellular mRNA translation and in virus spread in infected animals. In general, it appears that functional plasticity of the papain-like leader proteinases {{played an important role in}} the evolution of viral diversity.

In the highly sensitive Jurkat cell line, early caspase- 8 activation, observed from 2 h after treatment, was chronologically associated with an acute depletion of glutathione and the cleavage of caspase- 3 and poly-ADP ribosyl polymerase (PARP), followed by a progressive fall in the mitochondrial transmembrane potential (Delta(psi) m), between 4 and 48 h after treatment. Ceramide levels began to increase 2 h after the addition of anti-Fas (with no increase during the first hour), and increased continuously to 640 % of control cells at 48 h. In the moderately sensitive SCC 61 adherent cells, comparable results were observed, though {{with lower levels of}} ceramide and a delay in the response kinetics, with apoptotic cells becoming flotant. Finally, despite early cleavage of caspase- 8 at 2 h, and a sustained level of activation until 48 h, no apoptotic response was observed in anti-Fas-resistant SQ 20 B cells. This was confirmed by a lack of ceramide generation and mitochondrial changes, and by the absence of any detectable cleavage of caspase- 3 or PARP. Inhibition of caspase <b>processing,</b> and <b>amplification</b> of endogenous ceramide signalling by pharmacological agents, allowed us to establish the order of cellular events, locating ceramide release after caspase- 8 activation and before caspase- 3 activation, and demonstrating a direct involvement for ceramide release in mitochondrial dysfunction.

Microwave photonics has been introduced for achieving ultra broadband signal processing. Instantaneous Frequency Measurement (IFM) receivers {{play an important role in}} electronic warfare. Technologies used for signal processing, include conventional direct Radio Frequency (RF) techniques, digital techniques, intermediate frequency (IF) techniques and photonic techniques. Direct RF techniques suffer an increased loss, high dispersion, and unwanted radiation problems in high frequencies. The systems that use traditional RF techniques can be bulky and often lack the agility required to perform advanced signal processing in rapidly changing environments. In this paper we discussed a survey of Microwave Frequency Measurement Techniques. The microwaves techniques are categorized based upon different approaches. This paper provides the major advancement in the Microwave Frequency Measurement Techniques research; using these approaches the features and categories in the surveyed existing work.
