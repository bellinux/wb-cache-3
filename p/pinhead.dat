500|$|The {{voice for}} Satan, {{provided}} by Parker, {{was inspired by}} the voice of the <b>Pinhead</b> character at the ending of the 1988 horror film, , when <b>Pinhead</b> emotionally recalls his old life, when he was a good person. The animators went through several sketch drafts for Satan because, in Parker's words, [...] "There's so many ways to go with him and we couldn't figure out the right one for a long time". The large and muscular look of the character stemmed {{from the fact that the}} script called for Satan to massively outweigh Jesus, and that look has persisted for the character throughout the rest of the series.|$|E

500|$|In 1978, {{she founded}} Raw Books and Graphics, a name settled on {{in part because}} of its small-operation feel, and part because it was {{reminiscent}} of Mad magazine. [...] Mouly worked from an aesthetic inspired in part by the Russian Constructivists, who brought a design sense to everyday objects. [...] Raw Books began by publishing postcards and prints by artists such as underground cartoonist Bill Griffith and Dutch cartoonist Joost Swarte. [...] More ambitious projects included art objects such as the Zippy-Scope, a cardboard device with to watch a comic strip rolled up on a film spool, featuring Griffth's character Zippy the <b>Pinhead.</b> [...] Some projects were more commercial, such as the annual Streets of SoHo Map and Guide, whose advertising revenue financed much of Raw Books.|$|E
500|$|Zombie's {{intention}} was to reinvent Michael Myers because, in his opinion, the character, along with Freddy Krueger, Jason Voorhees, and <b>Pinhead,</b> had become more familiar to audiences, and as a result, less scary. The idea behind the new film was to delve deeper into Michael's back story and add [...] "new life" [...] to the character. Michael's mask will be given its own story, to provide an explanation {{as to why he}} wears it, instead of having the character simply steal a random mask from a hardware store, as in the original film. Zombie explained that he wanted Michael to be true to what a psychopath really is, and wanted the mask to be a way for Michael to hide. He also wanted the young Michael to have charisma, which would be projected onto the adult Michael. In addition, he decided that Michael's motives for returning to Haddonfield would be more ambiguous, explaining, [...] "as he trying to kill Laurie, or just find her because he loves her?" ...|$|E
500|$|Jason {{has also}} been {{referenced}} by several television shows. The stop motion animated television show Robot Chicken features Jason in three of its comedy sketches.

Velma is the only survivor, and in typical Scooby-Doo fashion, she rips off Jason's mask to reveal his true identity: Old Man Phillips. In episode nineteen, [...] "That Hurts Me", Jason reappears, this time as a housemate of [...] "Horror Movie Big Brother", alongside other famous slasher movie killers such as Michael Myers, Freddy Krueger, Leatherface, <b>Pinhead,</b> and Ghostface. Three years later, in episode sixty-two, Jason is shown on the days before and after a typical Friday the 13th. Jason is spoofed in the season five episode of Family Guy entitled [...] "It Takes a Village Idiot, and I Married One". The so-called [...] "Mr. Voorhees" [...] explains to Asian reporter Trisha Takanawa how happy he is to see local wildlife return following the cleanup and rejuvenation of Lake Quahog. He reappears later in the episode as {{the manager of the}} [...] "Britches and Hose" [...] clothing store. As opposed to his monstrous personality in the films, Jason is depicted here as polite and articulate, albeit still a psychopath; he murders random swimmers and threatens to kill his employee if she screws up. In an episode of The Simpsons, Jason appears in a Halloween episode sitting on the couch with Freddy Krueger waiting for the family to arrive. When Freddy asks where the family is, Jason responds, [...] "Ehh, whaddya gonna do?" [...] and turns the TV on. He also appears in The Simpsons episode [...] "Stop, or My Dog Will Shoot!", alongside <b>Pinhead,</b> menacing Bart in a fantasy sequence. The South Park episodes [...] "Imaginationland EpisodeII" [...] and [...] "III" [...] feature Jason among an assortment of other villains and monsters as an inhabitant of the [...] "bad side" [...] of Imaginationland, a world populated by fictional characters. This version of Jason has an effeminate voice and describes the removal of Strawberry Shortcake's eyeball as [...] "super hardcore".
