50|$|A slipper piston is a piston for a {{petrol engine}} {{that has been}} reduced in size and weight as much as possible. In the extreme case, they are reduced to the piston crown, support for the piston rings, and just enough of the <b>piston</b> <b>skirt</b> {{remaining}} to leave two lands so as to stop the piston rocking in the bore. The sides of the <b>piston</b> <b>skirt</b> around the gudgeon pin are reduced away from the cylinder wall. The purpose is mostly to reduce the reciprocating mass, thus {{making it easier to}} balance the engine and so permit high speeds. Reduced inertia also improves mechanical efficiency of the engine: the forces required to accelerate and decelerate the reciprocating parts cause more piston friction with the cylinder wall than the fluid pressure on the piston head. A secondary benefit may be some reduction in friction with the cylinder wall, since the area of the skirt, which slides {{up and down in the}} cylinder is reduced by half. However most friction is due to the piston rings, which are the parts which actually fit the tightest in the bore and the bearing surfaces of the wrist pin, the benefit is reduced.|$|E

5000|$|Steam {{engines are}} usually {{double-acting}} (i.e. steam pressure acts alternately {{on each side}} of the piston) and the admission and release of steam is controlled by slide valves, piston valves or poppet valves. Consequently, steam engine pistons are nearly always comparatively thin discs: their diameter is several times their thickness. (One exception is the trunk engine piston, shaped more like those in a modern internal-combustion engine.) Another factor is that since almost all steam engines use crossheads to translate the force to the drive rod, there are few lateral forces acting to try and [...] "rock" [...] the piston, so a cylinder-shaped <b>piston</b> <b>skirt</b> isn't necessary.|$|E

Typical compression ring designs will have an essentially rectangular cross section or a keystone (right angled trapezoidal) cross section.

40|$|The {{automobile}} manufacturers aspire {{to improve the}} engine design and enhance its life apart from optimizing the energy usage in the actual engine operation. A major concern {{at the time of}} the initial start up at the low loads and speed conditions is the wear of an engine. A significant proportion of the engine life gets compromised due to the adhesive engine start up wear. The start up wear does not exist during the normal engine operation due to the fully established elastohydrodynamic lubricating (EHL) film between the interacting surfaces of the piston assembly and the cylinder liner at the high loads, speeds and the optimum piston-to-bore radial clearances. Such arrangements do not exist in a few initial engine start up cycles. Resultantly, the <b>piston</b> <b>skirts</b> and the 1 st compression ring establish a physical contact with the liner and adhesive wear occurs. This PhD research work numerically models the lubrication of the <b>piston</b> <b>skirts</b> and the 1 st compression ring in the initial engine start up. The 2 -D hydrodynamic and EHL models of the <b>piston</b> <b>skirts</b> are developed in the initial engine start up conditions.

5000|$|Version one {{was based}} on Ford's 2.3-liter Pinto engine and weighed 152 lb (vs. 415 lb for its cast iron counterpart). It was {{designed}} to produce [...] at 9200 rpm. It was composed of metal cylinder sleeves, metal combustion chamber tops, metal piston crowns, bearings, valves and seats, and a stock 2.3L Pinto crankshaft. Nearly {{everything else in the}} engine, including the block, rods and <b>piston</b> <b>skirts,</b> were made of glass reinforced Polyamide-imide thermoplastic resins manufactured at the time by Amoco Chemicals Co.

50|$|The {{engine block}} {{is made from}} high {{pressure}} die-cast aluminum which results in considerable weight savings - the entire engine with a manual gearbox only weighs 82.4 kg. The main block features a ladder frame construction for structural stiffness while its cylinders are fitted with cast-iron liners for improved abrasion durability. Additional weight was shaved off by integrating the engine support bracket with the timing chain cover. The shape of the <b>piston</b> <b>skirt</b> was optimized to reduce its size while the compression height of the piston was also reduced, resulting in weight savings. The optimized <b>piston</b> <b>skirt</b> is also treated with molybdenum disulfide. A highly sophisticated process of Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD) is used to apply an ultra-thin layer of Chromium Nitride to the piston’s oil ring. Chromium Nitride-coated piston rings using PVD is an innovative technology borrowed from the Hyundai Tau engine introduced earlier. Friction between the oil ring and cylinder wall has been further minimized by reducing the oil ring tension. The Kappa engine is the first Hyundai engine to be fitted with an accessory drive belt which {{does not require a}} mechanical auto-tensioning adjustment device, reducing the hardware and further lowering weight and cost. Because it is designed to maintain an ideal tension setting, the belt runs quieter and with proper preventative maintenance and care, the belt will last 100,000 mi/160,000 km. For ignition, the Kappa engine uses a new, longer reach spark plug which enabled engineers to enlarge the size of the water jacket to promote more efficient engine cooling around the critically important spark plug and exhaust port area. The long reach spark plug (M12 thread) also enabled engineers to enlarge the valve diameter for increased airflow and combustion efficiency. A lightweight, heat-resistant engineering plastic was used for the intake manifold. The fuel delivery pipe assembly is a returnless type (to eliminate evaporative fuel emissions) and is made of SUS (steel use stainless) with a specially designed inner structure for the reduction of pulsation noise.|$|E

5000|$|During use, the {{cylinder}} {{is subject to}} wear from the rubbing action of the piston rings and <b>piston</b> <b>skirt.</b> This is minimized by the thin oil film which coats {{the cylinder}} walls and also by a layer of glaze which naturally forms as the engine is run-in, but eventually the cylinder becomes worn and slightly oval in shape, usually necessitating a rebore to an oversize diameter and the fitting of new, oversize pistons. The cylinder does not wear above the highest point reached by the top compression ring of the piston, which {{can result in a}} detectable ridge. If an engine is only operated at low rpm for its early life (e.g. in a gently driven automobile) then abruptly used in the higher rpm range (e.g. by a new owner), the slight stretching of the connecting rods at high speed can enable the top compression ring to contact the wear ridge, breaking the ring. For this reason it is important that all engines, once initially run-in, are occasionally [...] "exercised" [...] through their full speed range to develop a tapered wear profile rather than a sharp ridge.|$|E

The pistons were coated with molybdenum to reduce friction. The thin coating reduces moving friction and reduces cylinder wall scuffing.The <b>piston</b> <b>skirt</b> was reshaped and the piston weight was reduced by approximately 100 grams. Compression ratio was increased to 9.7:1 by reshaping the piston crown. This eliminates the clearance that was available between the piston at TDC and the fully opened valve.Piston pin offset has been changed to 0.5mm (0.020 in). Piston to cylinder wall clearance has been reduced by increasing the piston diameter.Another source of high engine friction is the valve train. Hydraulic lash adjusters (HLAs) are always in contact with the valves. The hydraulic pressure of the lash adjuster must be overcome during operation and during the most critical time of engine start.To overcome this situation and to contribute to the total reduction of friction loss, 1997 and later SOHC engines have solid valve adjusters. The scheduled service of this valve train is set at 100000 mi. SOHC engines now use an adjustment screw to adjust valve clearance. Engines with the earlier HLA are recommended to use 10W30 or 10W40 oil year-round; 5W30 can be used at very low winter temperatures.The roller rocker cam follower system that was introduced on the 1.8L Impreza engines, is installed on all 1996 model year and later 2.2-litre engines.

40|$|The recent {{worldwide}} {{quest to}} increase the fuel efficiency of internal combustion engines has led to great effects to reduce friction {{of many of the}} components in these engines. One area of major concern pertaining to this area is the friction of the piston/ring pack assembly. Because of the importance and necessity of this component to the internal combustion engine, any improvements can have relatively large implications for friction reduction. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to investigate several key components of the piston/ring pack assembly and how they influence friction levels. Specifically, experimental friction trends related to the oil control ring, <b>piston</b> <b>skirt,</b> liner surface and lubricant will be discussed. The Floating Liner Engine is used in this study in both the motored and fired configuration to isolate results from components and provide data for comparative analysis. The oil control ring (OCR) controls the supply of lubricating oil to the top two rings of the ring pack and has a significant contribution to friction of the system. This study investigates the two most prevalent types of OCR in the automotive market: the twin land oil control ring (TLOCR) and three piece oil control ring (TPOCR). The effect of changing the land width and spring tension on different liner surfaces for the TLOCR is investigated, and distinct trends are identified. A comparison is then done between the TLOCR and TPOCR on different liner surfaces. Results showed the TPOCR displayed different patterns of friction compared the TLOCR in certain cases. The <b>piston</b> <b>skirt</b> is also an important contributor of friction in the piston assembly. This thesis discusses the investigation into low friction coatings on the <b>piston</b> <b>skirt.</b> A brief study of <b>piston</b> <b>skirt</b> patterns is presented, with little gains being made by applying patterns the <b>piston</b> <b>skirt</b> coating. Next the roughness of the <b>piston</b> <b>skirt</b> coating is analyzed, and results show that reducing <b>piston</b> <b>skirt</b> roughness can have positive effects on friction reduction. Finally, an introductory study into the profile of the <b>piston</b> <b>skirt</b> is presented, with the outcome being that friction reduction is possible by optimizing the skirt profile. The final section of this thesis discusses the effects of lubricants pertaining to friction in the piston assembly. The effects of changing lubricant viscosity through both temperature and formulation are presented, as well as results from testing the effects of select anti-wear additives in the oil. The results identify new developments related to lubricant/additive effects on the liner surface, and how these effects can influence friction. by Zach Westerfield. Thesis: S.
