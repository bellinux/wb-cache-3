40|$|Objectives: To review <b>position</b> <b>descriptions</b> of the {{community}} and public health nutrition workforce in order to assess employers' expectations of workforce functions and competency requirements. Design: Qualitative content analysis of job descriptions obtained from a sample of the known community and public health nutrition workforce in Australia and collation of <b>position</b> <b>descriptions</b> advertised in the February 2002 to August 2002 period. Subjects: Community and public health nutritionists in the Australian health system. Main outcome measures: Descriptive qualitative data about employers' expectations of the core functions, competencies and credentials of community and public health nutritionists, as expressed by <b>position</b> <b>descriptions.</b> Results: From a total of 64 <b>position</b> <b>descriptions</b> obtained, 46 were included in the analysis. This sample consisted of 35 existing (occupied) positions and 11 new (advertised) positions. These were distributed across 29 entry-level and 17 advanced-level positions. The most consistent core function domains, as represented by duty statements, were community-based nutrition intervention management (planning, strategy development, implementation and evaluation), capacity building and nutrition-related research and evaluation. Entry-level positions {{were more likely to have}} direct-care or clinical dietetics functions and there was a stronger emphasis on coordination, capacity building and research in the advanced-level positions. Competency expectations, as represented by key selection criteria, focused on experience of intervention management, knowledge of public health nutrition issues and strategies, interpersonal communication skills and the ability to adopt a multidisciplinary working style. Almost all of the entry-level positions required mandatory dietetic qualifications. Conclusions: As a proxy of employers' expectations, analysis of workforce <b>position</b> <b>descriptions</b> by duties (functions) and selection criteria (credentials and [...] .

40|$|Individual {{performance}} evaluation is {{also referred to}} as performance appraisal, {{performance evaluation}}, performance management, performance review, and personal planning and development. These terms reflect the various uses to which this activity may be put and the desire for individual performance improvement. Whichever definition and method is adopted, it is imperative that the employee knows and understands from the outset what his/her work consists in, {{how long it takes to}} perform, and the expectations of the manager. An individual worker's view of what constitutes good or acceptable performance may not match the expectations or values of his or her peers, immediate superiors or employer. Therefore, there needs to be a clear understanding of work requirements by all parties. <b>Position</b> <b>descriptions</b> can be used to assist that process, and they can be seen as forming part of the contract between employer and employee. The accuracy, comprehensiveness and clarity of <b>position</b> <b>descriptions</b> will influence common understandings of performance requirements and expectations. This chapter covers the above concepts and includes a description of methods used to analyse work, which are indispensable when preparing <b>position</b> <b>descriptions,</b> selection criteria and ways of documenting these to enable performance management relative to position requirements to take place. The use of performance indicators is also covered. Appropriate systems need to be in place to enable managers, both administrative and clinical, to evaluate the process of the provision of services. Better information about the relationships between inputs, processes, costs and outcomes is expected to lead to better decision making, improved methods of service delivery and hence improved outcomes. Personnel constitute a vital factor in the health care industry, as they perform the processes that constitute health service delivery. Sound personnel management, continuously aiming to improve work performance, will lead to improved outcomes for health care consumers...|$|R
40|$|Aim A Delphi {{survey was}} {{undertaken}} {{to refine the}} <b>position</b> <b>description</b> of a registered nurse working in a forensic hospital, in New South Wales, Australia. Background Prior to commencing operation in 2008, position descriptions were developed from a review of legislation, as well as policies and procedures used by existing forensic mental health services in Australia. With an established workforce and an evolving model of care, {{a review of the}} initial registered nurse <b>position</b> <b>description</b> was required. Method An online Delphi survey was undertaken. Eight executive (88. 9 %) and 12 (58. 3 %) senior nursing staff participated in the first survey round. A total of four survey rounds were completed. Results At the final round, there was consensus (70 %) that the revised <b>position</b> <b>description</b> was either very or somewhat suitable. There were a total of nine statements, from 31 originally produced in round 1, that did not reach consensus. Conclusions The Delphi survey enabled a process for refining the Forensic Hospital registered nurse <b>position</b> <b>description.</b> Implications for nursing management Methods that facilitate executive and senior nursing staff consensus in the development and review of position descriptions should be considered in nursing management...|$|E

40|$|Dear Mr. Foster: Enclosed is {{a copy of}} our {{decision}} on a request from [appellant’s representative] to reopen and reconsider {{our decision}} on the appeal he filed on behalf of [appellant] on the classification of her position. [Appellant] is currently employed at the Naval Air Station in [city, state], {{in the position of}} Supervisory Environmental Protection Specialist, GS- 028 - 11. [Appellant’s representative] requested that we reevaluate the environmental protection work personally performed by [appellant]. We have carefully reviewed all of the documentation in the appeal record and the information obtained from additional telephone interviews with the appellant, her immediate supervisor, and other agency officials. After considering all of this information, we have concluded that the personal work performed by the appellant is correctly classified at the GS- 9 grade level. Since the supervisory duties control the grade of the position, the appellant’s position is properly classified as Supervisory Environmental Protection Specialist, GS- 028 - 11. Please note that, in the attachment, we discuss some discrepancies between [appellant’s] <b>position</b> <b>description</b> and information obtained during our telephone interviews.
