5|$|On 19 February 1942, the Japanese carrier {{striking}} force, {{consisting of}} aircraft carriers Akagi, Kaga, Hiryu, and Soryu {{under the command}} of Admiral Chuichi Nagumo, launched 189 <b>planes</b> <b>to</b> attack Darwin. The carrier planes rendezvoused with 54 land-based bombers from Kendari and Ambon.|$|E
5|$|On 24 June 1940, after Germany's {{victory in}} the Battle of France, Gustave Bertrand flew Brunos {{international}} personnel—including fifteen Poles, and seven Spaniards who worked on Italian ciphers—in three <b>planes</b> <b>to</b> Algeria.|$|E
5|$|Aerial {{support for}} the {{offensive}} was provided by Luftflotte 5 and the Finnish Air Force. The Luftwaffe created a new headquarters for the operation and moved it into Finland. The Finnish air force fielded about 230 aircraft of various types. Luftflotte 5 assigned 60 <b>planes</b> <b>to</b> Silver Fox and used Junkers Ju 87, Junkers Ju 88 and Heinkel He 111 aircraft for ground support.|$|E

5|$|In {{the last}} days of the war, Göring was {{repeatedly}} ordered to withdraw his squadron, first to Tellancourt airdrome, then to Darmstadt. At one point, he was ordered to surrender the aircraft to the Allies; he refused. Many of his pilots intentionally crash-landed their <b>planes</b> <b>to</b> keep them from falling into enemy hands.|$|E
5|$|On 5 June 2008, it was {{announced}} that the airport would install a Category III landing system, allowing <b>planes</b> <b>to</b> land in low visibility conditions, such as fog. This system will be {{the first of its kind}} in Australia, and was commissioned March 2010 at a cost of $10 million.|$|E
5|$|The Civil Air Patrol conducts {{humanitarian}} service missions, {{usually in}} support of the Red Cross. CAP aircrews transport time-sensitive medical materials, including blood and human tissue, when other means of transportation (such as ambulances) are not practical or possible. Following the September11 attacks on the World Trade Center in New York City when all general aviation was grounded, one of the first <b>planes</b> <b>to</b> fly over the World Trade Center site was a CAP aircraft taking photographs.|$|E

2500|$|The {{sagittal}} plane is a <b>plane</b> parallel <b>to</b> the sagittal suture. All other sagittal <b>planes</b> (referred <b>to</b> as parasagittal <b>planes)</b> are parallel <b>to</b> it.

5|$|During Operation Desert Storm, Loring's tankers were {{responsible}} for refueling aircraft transiting the Atlantic. It was also used as a stopover for aircraft travelling to the Persian Gulf region due to its vital position. The base was also vital because it allowed <b>planes</b> <b>to</b> be maintained, planes which sometimes {{would be unable to}} reach their destination without maintenance. Between 2 August 1990 and 10 May 1991, more than 1,700 aircraft transiting between America and the Persian Gulf region landed at Loring. These included the C-141 Starlifter, C-5 Galaxy, C-130 Hercules, C-21A, A-4 Skyhawk, A-10 Thunderbolt II, Boeing 707, F-16 Fighting Falcon, F/A-18 Hornet, F-111 Aardvark, P-3 Orion, TR-1A Dragonlady, U-2 Dragonlady, B-52 Stratofortress, KC-10 Extender, KC-135 Stratotanker, E-3A Sentry, EA-6B Mercury, and E-8A Joint Stars aircraft.|$|E
5|$|In 1832 {{engineer}} James Green advised on {{extending the}} system, and suggested a line with three inclined <b>planes</b> <b>to</b> reach Cwmmawr, further up the Gwendraeth Valley. Although Green had experience with inclined planes on other canals, he underestimated {{the cost and}} could not complete the work. He was sacked in 1836, but the canal company finished the new route the following year. The canal was moderately successful, and shareholders received dividends from 1858. In 1865 the company {{changed its name to}} become the Kidwelly and Burry Port Railway, amalgamated with the company running Burry Port in the following year, and the canal became the Burry Port and Gwendraeth Valley Railway in 1869.|$|E
5|$|In 1832, {{the canal}} company asked the {{engineer}} James Green to advise on further extensions to the system. His first report {{was critical of}} much of the work completed by Pinkerton, and recommended completing the link from the Ashburnham Canal to the new Pembrey harbour. This would require a lock at Ty Mawr, with water supplied by the Dyvatty brook and a new reservoir to be constructed at Cwm Capel in the Dyvatty valley. A second report, supplied three months later, recommended an extension along the Gwendraeth valley, and the construction of three inclined <b>planes</b> <b>to</b> reach a terminus just above Cwmmawr. Water supply for the upper sections would be from a new reservoir to be built above Cwm y Glo.|$|E

5|$|In 1928, Verville left Buhl-Verville to {{establish}} the Verville Aircraft Company, also in Detroit. The company sought to market <b>planes</b> <b>to</b> the wealthy private owner. Verville Aircraft produced the Verville Air Coach, a four-passenger, high-wing monoplane, which made its debut at the 1929 Detroit Air Show and the Verville Sport Trainer, a two-seat tandem biplane. The United States Army Air Corps purchased 4 Sport Trainers under the designation YPT-10. The USAAC tested with 5 different engine versions resulting in YPT-10 thru YPT-10D designations.|$|E
5|$|In January 2016, Russia, for {{the first}} time in combat conditions, {{deployed}} four Su-35S <b>planes</b> <b>to</b> Khmeimim air base in Syria as part of Russian air operations in the country. This occurred following an increase in tension between Russia and Turkey as a result of reported incursions by Russian aircraft into Turkish airspace. The aircraft complemented the Su-30SMs in flying combat air patrols and providing protection to other aircraft that were conducting bombing missions. As a result of operations in Syria, problems were identified with the aircraft's avionics and were subsequently rectified. The aircraft presumably attained full operational capability in September 2017.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of Hazel, a three-day period of national mourning was declared in Haiti for hurricane victims. With existing infrastructure already poor, the recovery was very slow {{since many of the}} few existing roads were blocked, and communications equipment was either out, damaged, or destroyed. The Haitian Red Cross appealed for assistance to the International Red Cross, while the American Red Cross made a donation of $25,000 (1954 USD). Pan American World Airways offered the use of its <b>planes</b> <b>to</b> assist with the delivery of aid, and the US aircraft carrier USS Saipan deployed 18 helicopters to help deliver supplies. Despite the relief effort, there was an outbreak of typhoid fever following Hazel {{due to a lack of}} clean water.|$|E

5|$|On 21 March the Embassy {{predicted}} {{there would}} be 3,600 evacuees, far exceeding the original estimate of approximately 400. This necessitated {{the development of a}} new evacuation plan whereby Marines would secure Pochentong Airport, while helicopters would ferry evacuees from central Phnom Penh to Pochentong from where they would be flown on C-130 <b>planes</b> <b>to</b> Thailand. However, this plan was quickly overtaken by events as the supply C-130s coming into Pochentong were used for evacuees on the return journey, quickly reducing the number of evacuees that would need to be moved in a final evacuation.|$|E
5|$|On 3 February 1997, {{the airline}} {{announced}} it had ordered six 134-seat Boeing 737-700 aircraft for NOK1.5 billion. These aircraft would be delivered in 1998, {{prior to the}} opening of the new airport at Gardermoen. In addition, the airline had an option for additional ten <b>planes</b> <b>to</b> be delivered after 2000. In 1997, Transwede started replacing its Fokker 100s with Boeing 737s. In May 1997, Braathens SAFE was criticized by the Norwegian Airline Pilots Association because it was using retired Braathens SAFE pilots to fly Transwede aircraft, due to Transwede not having certified pilots for their new Boeing 737-300. Braathens SAFE stated that this was within the rules of the Swedish Civil Aviation Administration and the Joint Aviation Authorities.|$|E
5|$|Planescape: Torment is {{primarily}} story-driven and combat is not prominently featured. The protagonist, known as The Nameless One, is an immortal {{who has lived}} many lives but has forgotten all about them, even forgetting his own name. The game focuses on his journey through the city of Sigil and other <b>planes</b> <b>to</b> reclaim his memories of these previous lives. Several characters in the game may join The Nameless One on his journey, {{and most of these}} characters have encountered him in the past or have been influenced by his actions in some way.|$|E
