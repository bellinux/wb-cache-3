40|$|Retention of {{particles}} in seagrass canopies is usually attributed to only the indirect, attenuating effects canopies have on flow, turbulence and wave action, promoting sedimentation and reducing resuspension within seagrass meadows. Yet recent {{evidence suggests that}} seagrasses are also able to affect particle flux directly through loss of momentum and increased path length derived from collisions with leaves and binding {{of particles}}. We evaluated the role of Posidonia oceanica on flow and associated particle trapping through flume experiments. Our results confirm the existence of 2 dynamically different environments, viz. (1) the below-canopy habitat, with low shear stress and reduced turbulence, and (2) the canopy-water interface region, characterized by high shear stress and turbulence intensity, where vertical transport of momentum is enhanced. At relatively low free stream velocities (i. e. 0. 05 and 0. 10 m s- 1) sediment concentration decreased much faster when a <b>Posidonia</b> <b>meadow</b> was present in the flume, indicating major particle trapping in the seagrass canopy. Fluxes to the sediment (as shown by large negative peaks in Reynolds stress inside the <b>Posidonia</b> <b>meadow)</b> indicated 2 to 6 times more sediment transport to the bottom when a meadow is present. However, calculations based on the experimental results point to loss rates {{an order of magnitude}} larger in a <b>Posidonia</b> <b>meadow.</b> We hypothesize that direct effects of particle collisions with leaves are responsible for this discrepancy, and we explore possible interactions with a simple model. Using only collisions as a loss factor, the model predicts that the probability a particle is lost from the flow upon a collision is 2 to 3 %. Previously observed leaf density and flow velocity effects on particle loss rates were explained by the model. Fitting the model to our experimentally obtained particle disappearance rates in vegetation indicated that around 27 % of particle momentum is lost upon each collision with a leaf. We hypothesize that physical filtration by sediment collisions with plant structures plays a role in particle removal in aquatic systems. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The endemic {{seagrass}} Posidonia oceanica (L.) Delile colonizes soft bottoms producing highly productive meadows {{that play}} a crucial role in coastal ecosystems dynamics. Human activities and natural events are responsible for a widespread meadows regression; to date the identification of "diagnostic" tools to monitor conservation status is a critical issue. In this study the feasibility of a novel tool to evaluate ecological impacts on <b>Posidonia</b> <b>meadows</b> has been tested. Quantification of a putative stress indicator, i. e. phenols content, has been coupled to 2 -D electrophoretic protein analysis of rhizome samples. Results The overall expression pattern from Posidonia rhizome was determined using a preliminary proteomic approach, 437 protein spots were characterized by p I and molecular weight. We found that protein expression differs in samples belonging to sites with high or low phenols: 22 unique protein spots are peculiar of "low phenols" and 27 other spots characterize "high phenols" samples. Conclusion Posidonia showed phenols variations within the meadow, that probably reflect the heterogeneity of environmental pressures. In addition, comparison of the 2 -D electrophoresis patterns allowed to highlight qualitative protein expression differences in response to these pressures. These differences may account for changes in metabolic/physiological pathways as adaptation to stress. A combined approach, based on phenols content determination and 2 -D electrophoresis protein pattern, seems a promising tool to monitor <b>Posidonia</b> <b>meadows</b> health state. </p...|$|E

40|$|Posidonia oceanica {{forms an}} {{extremely}} productive and complex ecosystem {{in the coastal}} Mediterranean Sea providing a suitable habitat for hundreds {{of plant and animal}} species. Among motile invertebrates associated to <b>Posidonia</b> <b>meadows,</b>  polychaete borers of the plant sheaths represent a unique group which exploit a peculiar microhabitat. They belong to the family Eunicidae with three dominant species, Lysidice collaris, L. ninetta and L. unicornis. Due to their strong association with Posidonia shoots, these animals are particularly suitable to study the plant and animal spatial relationships and their pattern of variability. The aim of this work was to evaluate the frequency of occurrence of these animals (Index of Borer, IB) at different spatial and temporal (summer vs winter) scales in two <b>Posidonia</b> <b>meadows</b> off the Ischia Island (Gulf of Naples, Italy), which are exposed to different degrees of human impact and of hydrological conditions.

The IB of L. ninetta showed significant differences only at scales of 10 s of meters while, on the contrary, the IB of L. unicornis (the less abundant species) did not show variability at any spatial and temporal scales. Most of the variance was at the more impacted and less water movement exposed meadow, suggesting higher level of small and intermediate scales of patchiness of borers at this meadow.

40|$|The Mediterranean {{seagrass}} Posidonia oceanica {{maintains a}} biodiverse ecosystem {{and it is}} a world-wide important carbon sink. It grows for millennia, accumulating organic-rich soils (mats) beneath the meadows. This marine habitat is protected by the European Union; however, it is declining rapidly due to coastal development. Understanding its response to disturbances could inform habitat restoration, but many environmental impacts predate monitoring programs (3 ̆c 50 3 ̆eyears). This research explores the palaeoecological potential of Posidonia mats to reconstruct six thousand years of environmental change that could have affected <b>Posidonia</b> <b>meadows</b> and, in turn, left an imprint on the mats. Palynological, microcharcoal, magnetic susceptibility and glomalin-related soil protein (GRSP) analyses on Posidonia mats enabled us to detect climate- and human-induced environmental processes impacting on the seagrass during the Late Holocene. The pollen and microcharcoal records reconstructed anthropogenic disturbances attributed to agriculture. The record of GRSP shows that agrarian activities affected continental soil quality. Changes in magnetic susceptibility reveal that enhanced soil erosion was caused by both climate (major flooding events in the NW Mediterranean) and humans (cultivation) which impacted on the Posidonia mat. Finally, increased human impact is linked to eutrophication of coastal waters since Roman-Medieval times. Synthesis. This study shows that climate and land-use changes in the western Mediterranean resulted in enhanced loadings of terrigenous material to the coastal zone since the Late Holocene, likely disturbing the <b>Posidonia</b> <b>meadows</b> and their mat carbon accumulation dynamics. Under the current global change scenario in which CO 2 emissions are projected to increase, restoring carbon sinks is a priority.

Bacterial densities varied little throughout the year and were around 5. 0 10 ^ 5 and 6. 0 10 ^ 6 cells ml - 1 of free and pore-water, respectively. The combined use of the ApiZym gallery and the Biolog microtitration plate permitted highlighting bacterial enzymatic activities susceptible to degrade principal organic polymers present in the <b>Posidonia</b> <b>meadow,</b> and to correlate these enzymatic activities to the subsequent potential utilization of resulting monomeric products. Levels of enzymatic activities (1. 80 - 8. 36 nmoles substrates h - 1 ml- 1) and energetic bacterial metabolism (1. 80 - 6. 42 nmoles substrates h - 1 ml- 1) presented seasonality relying on the temperature regime and on the primary production (Posidonia and phytoplankton).
