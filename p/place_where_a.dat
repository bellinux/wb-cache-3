This caused the Devil great pain, and Dunstan only agreed to remove the shoe and release the Devil after he promised never to enter a <b>place</b> <b>where</b> <b>a</b> horseshoe is over the door.

5|$|This {{artificial}} lake {{is connected to}} {{the east side of the}} Segaran Lake via a 380 meter long canal that runs east to west. The canal was about 20 meter wide and there are two bottlenecks that are thought to be the <b>place</b> <b>where</b> <b>a</b> hanging bridge once stood. One of the bridge is now located in the street that connects the kraton complex of Magangan with the Kamandhungan Kidul. The layout of the bridge can still be recognized, although the bridge itself has gone. On the west side of the hanging bridge is a pier that was used by the sultan as his starting point for his journey to the Taman Sari pool on his royal vessel.|$|E
5|$|According to the legend, the raskovnik could unlock any gate or padlock, {{regardless}} of its size, material or key. It could also uncover treasures buried in the ground: in Bulgarian beliefs, it could split {{the ground at the}} <b>place</b> <b>where</b> <b>a</b> treasure lay so that people could locate it. In some regions of Serbia, the treasure itself was a black man in chains who requested that a raskovnik be brought to him. The raskovnik would break the chains and the man would disappear into the ground {{to be replaced by a}} cauldron filled with gold coins. Other supernatural properties attributed to the herb by Bulgarians include the alchemic ability to transmute iron into gold, the more general ability to make the one who picked it forever happy or wealthy. In some interpretations, the raskovnik is a wonderful plant that makes true whatever its owner desires.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the Middle Ages, castles {{tended to}} lose their {{military}} significance due to the advent of powerful cannons and permanent artillery fortifications; as a result, castles became more important as residences and statements of power. A castle could act as a stronghold and prison but was also a <b>place</b> <b>where</b> <b>a</b> knight or lord could entertain his peers. Over time the aesthetics of the design became more important, as the castle's appearance and size began to reflect the prestige and power of its occupant. Comfortable homes were often fashioned within their fortified walls. Although castles still provided protection from low levels of violence in later periods, eventually they were succeeded by country houses as high status residences.|$|E

5|$|The route {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with SR 84 west of Stanfield. SR 347 then heads northward as John Wayne Parkway, a four-lane expressway, which SR 347 is for its entirety, through a desert landscape. After intersecting Meadowview Road and crossing a canal, SR 347 meets Carefree <b>Place,</b> <b>where</b> <b>a</b> farm appears {{to the west}} part of the road. At Clayton Road, {{the east side of}} the road becomes farmland as well. John Wayne Parkway enters the Ak-Chin Indian Community, passing the Harrah's Ak-Chin Casino, and intersects BIA Route 14 within this community. At Route 14, the route becomes Maricopa Road, but retains its name as John Wayne Parkway, as it heads toward Maricopa. Continuing on its northerly path, the road exits the Indian community with a residential area to the west and desert to the east. Past Bowlin road, this orientation switches, as the residential area is located on the east side of Maricopa Road. The arrangement of the landscape switches again at Desert Cedars Road, where the road passes the Maricopa First Baptist Church. Before meeting the Maricopa-Casa Grande Highway, the road passes Maricopa High School. It also meets an at-grade intersection with a rail line, owned by Union Pacific.|$|E

Conflict arose when the canals met the river downstream; as a result, the Pecos River Flume was built, first out of wood and later concrete (the flume is often titled the only <b>place</b> <b>where</b> <b>a</b> river crosses itself).|$|E
