5000|$|On {{the evening}} of 29 October 2015, another heavy rocket attack killed more than 20 {{residents}} in the camp. As with regard to many past attacks to Camp Liberty and Camp Ashraf, evidence points to Iran paramilitary forces being the perpetrators. UNHCR strongly condemned the attacks and stated that the residents are entitled to <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> <b>expulsion</b> or forced movement to any place where their lives or freedom would be threatened, and informed that it has supported the relocation of more than 900 residents to safe third countries since 2011; as however, approximately 2,160 people still remain, UNHCR renewed its calls upon governments of other countries {{to find ways to}} offer long term solutions. The European Iraqi Freedom Association (EIFA), led by Struan Stevenson, Chairman of the European Parliament’s Delegation for Relations with Iraq from 2009 to 2014, who was deeply involved in diplomacy aiming to safeguard the lives and human rights of the residents of Camp Ashraf, stated that to avoid further bloodshed just condemning the atrocity is not enough. EIFA urged the USA to provide air cover for Camp Liberty, the UN to [...] "stop any further obfuscation and officially recognise Camp Liberty as a refugee camp under its direct supervision and protection" [...] and asked that the [...] "international assistance to Iraq must be suspended forthwith until the security of the Camp Liberty residents is assured".|$|E

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} settled {{migrants}} {{and calls for}} the construction of the right to respect for private life as an autonomous source of <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> <b>expulsion</b> under Article 8 ECHR. I contend that, as a core part of human existence, private life warrants meaningful protection. I posit that the fact that all settled migrants have established private life in the host State brings it to the fore of Article 8 expulsion cases. This argument finds strong support in the concept of belonging and transnational migration theory; both tell us that settled migrants' host State has become their 'own country'. Drawing on earlier work, I reclaim vulnerability as a foundation and tool of International Human Rights Law with a view to recognising migrants within the jurisdiction of ECHR States as fully-fledged ECHR subjects and making the European Court of Human Rights responsive to their vulnerability. I make the case for absolute <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> <b>expulsion</b> for second (and subsequent) -generation migrants and settled migrants who have spent most of their adult life in the host State. In respect of other settled migrants, I argue that the minimum protection standard should be that expulsion is only justifiable in exceptional circumstance...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to analyse the {{issues related to the}} legal status of family members of European Union citizens in light of European Union law, and to compare the rights of family members of EU citizens with the rights of the other third country nationals (further referred to as TCNs) and the EU citizens themselves. The first chapter deals with the institute of EU citizenship and especially stresses the importance of the right of EU citizens and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of Member States which is connected with the status of an EU citizen. The second chapter is related to the different definitions of family members in EU secondary legislation. The third chapter examines in detail specific rights (e. g. : the right of entry and residence to the territory of the host Member State, <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> <b>expulsion)</b> which are connected with the status of the family member of EU citizens {{on the one hand and}} the status of the TCNs on the other hand. The thesis attempts to answer to the questions related to the legal status of family members and tries to suggest possible future adjustments of EU legislature...|$|E
40|$|The free {{movement}} of persons {{is one of the}} most successful European Union projects, serving as a majorly important factor promoting the European integration processes. The adoption of the Treaty on the European Union and the creation of EU citizenship implemented significant changes: the status of EU citizens and their right to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States can no longer be interpreted in the way it was before the adoption of the Treaty on the European Union. There are no requirements for EU citizens within the Treaty to pursue professional or independent activities or to work under an employment contract in order to access provided rights. However, the right of {{free movement}} is not unlimited. The administrations of the Member State governments are authorized to impose restictions on the {{free movement of}} citizens. In the light of these facts, this article examines exceptions in the field of free movement of persons and indentifies concepts of public policy, public security and public health. Special attention is given to so-called rule limitation of restrictions and to the mechanism of <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> <b>expulsion</b> from the country. The article concludes by saying that the institutions of Member State governments have the right to evaluate threats within the territory of the country and to decide on the content of public security by themselves. However, their discretion can not be used as an instrument to treat the conduct of other Member State citizens in a worse way than that of their own local citizens...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{protection}} in international human rights law of the economic, social, cultural, political and residence rights of migrant workers and their families, broadly defined as long- or short-term immigrants who are or have been employed in countries other than their own, included those who entered illegally. These are the rights of most concern to migrants {{in the country of}} employment. Economic and social rights comprise employment rights, trade union rights and rights to social security, health, housing, family reunification and education. Cultural rights of migrants embrace their right to retain and develop cultural identity, including the teaching to their children of the culture and language of the country of origin, and political rights encompass their right to political activity and to participate in the decision-making process concerning their interests, including the right to vote. Residence rights comprise their right to remain in the host country, while in work and immediately after the termination of employment, and their rights to permanent residence and naturalization and to <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> unfair <b>expulsion.</b> The thesis develops a theoretical framework that is justified in terms of both individualist and communitarian liberal principales. These principles provide for conceptions of citizenship which go beyond mere form and which justify the extension of membership of the state to alien migrant workers and their families. These normative models also support the provision of more extensive rights to both legal and illegal migrants. Limiting the rights of migrants already in the territory and controlling the entry of new immigrants is justified by the principle of sovereignty on the basis of socio-economic, cultural and physical state security. This principal, however, is being eroded by the development of international standards for the protection of vulnerable groups. A redefined conception of the liberal-democratic community, which recognizes the participation and contribution of migrant workers and their families, is more responsive to the interdependence of the international community of states and more closely conforms to its own individualist and communitarian precepts. This thesis concludes with the conviction that the adequate realization of the rights of alien migrant workers and their families can only serve to advance the rights of all human beings, including citizen-members of states.

40|$|This article {{considers}} {{the relationship between}} two human rights discourses (and two specific legal regimes) : refugee and asylum protection and the evolving body of international law that regulates expulsions and deportations. Legal protections for refugees and asylum seekers are, of course, venerable, well-known, and in many respects still cherished, if challenged and perhaps a bit frail. Anti-deportation discourse is much newer, multifaceted, and evolving. It is in many respects a young work in progress. It has arisen {{in response to a}} rising tide of deportations, and the worrisome development of massive, harsh deportation machinery in the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom, France, Mexico, Australia, and South Africa, among others. This article’s main goal is to consider how these two discourses do and might relate to each other. More specifically, it suggests that the development of procedural and substantive rights against removal — as well as rights during and after removal — aids our understanding of the current state and possible future of the refugee protection regime. The article’s basic thesis is this: The global refugee regime, though challenged both theoretically and in practice, must be maintained and strengthened. Its historical focus on developing criteria for admission into safe states, on <b>protections</b> <b>against</b> <b>expulsion</b> (i. e., non-refoulement), and on regimes of temporary protection all remain critically important. However, a focus on other protections for all noncitizens facing deportation is equally important. Deportation has become a major international system that transcends the power of any single nation-state. Its methods have migrated from one regime to another; its size and scope are substantial and expanding; its costs are enormous; and its effects frequently constitute major human rights violations against millions who do not qualify as refugees. In recent years there has been increasing reliance by states on generally applicable deportation systems, led in large measure by the United States’ radical 25 year-plus experiment with large-scale deportation. Europe has also witnessed a rising tide of deportation, some of which has developed in reaction to European asylum practices. Deportation has been facilitated globally (e. g., in Australia) by well-funded, efficient (but relatively little known) intergovernmental idea sharing, training, and cooperation. This global expansion, standardization, and increasing intergovernmental cooperation on deportation has been met by powerful — if in some respects still nascent — human rights responses by activists, courts, some political actors, and scholars. It might seem counterintuitive to think that emerging ideas about deportation protections could help refugees and asylum seekers, as those people by definition often have greater rights protections both in admission and expulsion. However, the emerging anti-deportation discourses should be systematically studied by those interested in the global refugee regime for three basic reasons. First, what Matthew Gibney has described as “the deportation turn” has historically been deeply connected to anxiety about asylum seekers. Although we lack exact figures of the number of asylum seekers who have been subsequently expelled worldwide, there seems little doubt that it has been a significant phenomenon and will be an increasingly important challenge in the future. The two phenomena of refugee/asylum protections and deportation, in short, are now and have long been linked. What has sometimes been gained through the front door, so to speak, may be lost through the back door. Second, current deportation human rights discourses embody creative framing models that might aid constructive critique and reform of the existing refugee protection regime. They tend to be more functionally oriented, less definitional in terms of who warrants protection, and more fluid and transnational. Third, these discourses offer important specific rights protections that could strengthen the refugee and asylum regime, even as we continue to see weakening state support for the basic 1951 / 1967 protection regime. This is especially true in regard to the extraterritorial scope of the (deporting) state’s obligations post-deportation. This article particularly examines two initiatives in this emerging field: The International Law Commission’s Draft Articles on the Expulsion of Aliens and the draft Declaration on the Rights of Expelled and Deported Persons developed through the Boston College Post-Deportation Human Rights Project (of which the author is a co-director). It compares their provisions to the existing corpus of substantive and procedural protections for refugees relating to expulsion and removal. It concludes with consideration of how these discourses may strengthen protections for refugees while also helping to develop more capacious and protective systems in the future...|$|R
