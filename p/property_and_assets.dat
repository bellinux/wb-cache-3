5|$|During the Paris Peace Conference, the Armenian {{delegation}} {{presented an}} assessment of $3.7 billion (about $ billion today) worth of material losses owned solely by the Armenian church. During the conference in February 1920, the Armenian community presented an additional demand for the restitution of <b>property</b> <b>and</b> <b>assets</b> seized by the Ottoman government. The joint declaration, which was submitted to the Supreme Council by the Armenian delegation and prepared by the religious leaders of the Armenian community, claimed that the Ottoman government had destroyed 2,000 churches and 200 monasteries and had provided the legal system for giving these properties to other parties. The declaration also provided a financial assessment of the total losses of personal <b>property</b> <b>and</b> <b>assets</b> of both Turkish and Russian Armenia with 14,598,510,000 and 4,532,472,000 francs respectively; totaling to an estimated $ billion today. Furthermore, the Armenian community asked for the restitution of church owned property and reimbursement of its generated income. The Ottoman government never responded to this declaration and so restitution did not occur.|$|E
25|$|The {{husband is}} financially {{responsible}} for the welfare and maintenance of his wife or wives and any children they produce, to include at a minimum, providing a home, food and clothing. In return, {{it is the duty}} of the wife to safeguard the husband's possessions and protect how wealth is spent. If the wife has wealth in her own capacity she is not obliged to spend it upon the husband or children, as she can own <b>property</b> <b>and</b> <b>assets</b> in her own right, so the husband has no right for her <b>property</b> <b>and</b> <b>assets</b> except by her will. A pre-marital agreement of the financial expectation from the husband is in the mahr, given by him to the wife for her exclusive use, which is included as part of his financial responsibility.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a concise {{overview of the}} development of an integrated <b>property</b> <b>and</b> <b>asset</b> market model (IPAMM) for South African property markets, utilising the Pretoria office market as case study. The IPAMM simulates the interrelationships between <b>property</b> <b>and</b> <b>asset</b> markets in a diagrammatic quadrant model configuration. The Fischer-DiPasquale-Wheaton (FDW) real estate model, arguably the most advanced diagrammatic quadrant real estate model available at present, served as basis for the development of IPAMM. IPAMM is essentially a regression model based on a system of stochastic equations that captures the interrelationships between <b>property</b> <b>and</b> <b>asset</b> markets. The model advances beyond mere conceptualisation of these relationships to a quantified interpretation and application of the theoretical premises that represent the micro-foundations of economic behaviour in <b>property</b> <b>and</b> <b>asset</b> markets...|$|R

25|$|Governance at Rutgers University {{rests with}} a Board of Trustees {{consisting}} of 59 members, and a Board of Governors consisting of 11 members: 6 {{appointed by the}} Governor of New Jersey and 5 chosen by the Board of Trustees. The trustees constitute chiefly an advisory body {{to the board of}} governors and are the fiduciary overseers of the <b>property</b> <b>and</b> <b>assets</b> of the university that existed before the institution became the State University of New Jersey in 1945. The initial reluctance of the trustees (still acting as a private corporate body) to cede control of certain business affairs to the state government for direction and oversight caused the state to establish the board of governors in 1956. Today, the board of governors maintains much of the corporate control of the university.|$|E
25|$|Muhammad was monogamously {{married to}} Khadija, his first wife, for 25 years, until she died. After her death, he married {{multiple}} women, mostly widows, {{for social and}} political reasons. He had a total of nine wives, but not {{all at the same}} time, depending on the sources in his lifetime. The Qur'an does not give preference in marrying more than one wife. One reason cited for polygyny is that it allows a man to give financial protection to multiple women, who might otherwise not have any support (e.g. widows). However, the wife can set a condition, in the marriage contract, that the husband cannot marry another woman during their marriage. In such a case, the husband cannot marry another woman as long as he is married to his wife. According to traditional Islamic law, each of those wives keeps their <b>property</b> <b>and</b> <b>assets</b> separate; and are paid mahar and maintenance separately by their husband. Usually the wives have little to no contact with each other and lead separate, individual lives in their own houses, and sometimes in different cities, though they all share the same husband.|$|E

500|$|Bacon Academy {{is named}} for Pierpoint Bacon, a prosperous farmer who died childless in 1800. Bacon bequeathed most of his <b>property</b> <b>and</b> <b>assets</b> to the First Society of Colchester to support schooling. The {{trustees}} decided to build an academy, an institution to have young men be educated, and then go directly into the workforce. Completed in 1803 {{for the cost of}} $7000, the main Bacon Academy structure is a long by wide three-story Flemish bond brick structure with Federal style details. The foundation of the academy is made of fieldstone with a facing of dressed granite blocks. The bricks were produced on a local farm for the purpose building Bacon Academy. The front facade has 26windows arranged in 9bays with gaps for the chimneys in between the second and third bay from the corners. The sash is 6-by-6 and was noted to appear original in the nomination form. Originally the hipped roof had four chimneys, with two matching chimneys on each the west and east sides. Only the east chimneys remain. Facing the front entrance, the chimneys are spaced about [...] from the side corners. In the 1982nomination, the hipped roof was reported to have asphalt shingles.|$|E

The original plan was to provide adequate funds for the Redress Board, but in the interim an unexpectedly large number of claimants has come forward.|$|E

The religious oath and other religious elements found in the statutes of the University of Coimbra were abolished, and matriculations into first year of the Theology Faculty were cancelled, as were places in the Canon law course, suppressing the teaching of Christian doctrine.

This Galligan affair was nothing to that. Nevertheless, it was annoying. As I sat in the street car on my way homeward, a man beside me was reading the Pilot. I had a queer sensation as he turned the page, and scanned the editorial; and I could not help wondering what he and the thousands like him thought of me; what he would say if I introduced myself and asked his opinion.
