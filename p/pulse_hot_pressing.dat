The graphite in the black region perpendicular to the hot-pressing direction exhibits a flocculent shape, and the graphite in the black region parallel to the hot-pressing direction exhibits a more slender shape. The reasons for this difference are as follows: The <b>hot</b> <b>pressing</b> sintering process is single-action pressing. Vertical pressure is applied on the composite powder in a cylindrical graphite die. There are significant morphological differences between the graphite perpendicular to the hot-pressing direction and the graphite parallel to the hot-pressing direction, because the graphite is intrinsically fluffy. These differences are maintained after isostatic pressing, because the pressures applied to the composite green body are equal in every direction during isostatic <b>pressing</b> after the <b>hot</b> <b>pressing</b> sintering step.

50|$|<b>Hot</b> <b>pressing</b> is {{a popular}} method for obtaining {{densified}} UHTC materials that relies upon both high temperatures and pressures to produce densified materials. Powder compacts are heated externally and pressure is applied hydraulitically. In order to improve densification during <b>hot</b> <b>pressing,</b> diboride powders can undergo milling by attrition to obtain powders of <2μm. Milling also allows for more uniform dispersion of the additive SiC. <b>Hot</b> <b>pressing</b> temperature, pressure, heating rate, reaction atmosphere, and holding times are all factors that affect the density and microstructure of UHTC pellets obtained from this method. In order to achieve >99% densification from <b>hot</b> <b>pressing,</b> temperatures of 1800-2000 °C and pressures of 30 MPa or greater are required. UHTC materials with 20vol.% SiC and toughened with 5% carbon black as additives exhibit increased densification above 1500 °C, but these materials still require temperatures of 1900 °C and a pressure of 30 MPa {{in order to obtain}} near theoretical densities. Other additives such as Al2O3 and Y2O3 have also been used during the <b>hot</b> <b>pressing</b> of ZrB2-SiC composites at 1800 °C. These additives react with impurities to form a transient liquid phase and promote sintering of the diboride composites. The addition of rare earth oxides such as Y2O3, Yb2O3, La2O3 and Nd2O3 can lower densification temperatures and can react with surface oxides to promote densification. <b>Hot</b> <b>pressing</b> may result in improved densities for UHTCs, but it is an expensive technique that relies on high temperatures and pressures to provide useful materials.|$|R

A new processing methodology is investigated for it 2 ̆ 7 s feasibility to generate residual stress strengthened ceramic compacts. For this purpose, pressure-assisted densification by power law creep and diffusion have been modeled. Existing two stage densification models {{were found to be}} inadequate to model compaction of ceramic compacts containing either density or composition gradients due to discontinuities in the density-time and stress-time behavior predicted by these models. A unified blending densification model was developed based on the hypothesis that porosity is likely to change gradually from being completely open at the beginning of compaction to completely closed at full density. This unified blending model eliminated both the density and the stress discontinuities. The material constants for the unified model were obtained by fitting to experimental data from <b>hot</b> <b>pressing</b> of homogeneous alumina powders. ^ Finite element analysis simulations of isothermal <b>hot</b> <b>pressing</b> of alumina compacts with density gradients indicate that <b>hot</b> <b>pressing</b> with a constant axial load is not likely to lead to any significant residual stresses. However, <b>hot</b> <b>pressing</b> of such compacts with a constant axial displacement rate shows that significant compressive residual stresses develop {{on the surface of the}} compacts. Numerical results also indicate that <b>hot</b> <b>pressing</b> of alumina powders in dies with non-uniform cross-section will result in residual surface compressive stresses in the compact. ^ Numerical simulations of <b>hot</b> <b>pressing</b> of layered cylindrical alumina/ 3 Y-TZP shows that stress gradients can be generated during <b>hot</b> <b>pressing,</b> with higher compressive stresses in the outer surface of the compact. However, the significantly lower elastic modulus of the inner 3 Y-TZP core results in tensile surface stresses on elastic unloading of the compact. These tensile stresses reduce the compressive residual stresses resulting from the mismatch in thermal expansion coefficients of the two layers on cooling of the compact. Based on these results, it is recommended that in order to add to the residual stresses generated due to thermal expansion mismatch, a layered composite compact should have comparable elastic modulus, lower densification rate of the powders in the outer layer, and a lower thermal expansion coefficient in the outer layer than in the inner core. Such a system should aide in maximum outer surface compressive residual stresses. ...|$|R

40|$|A HfB 2 -SiC {{ceramics}} were fabricated via a reactive <b>hot</b> <b>pressing</b> using Hf, B 4 C, and Si as precursors. The {{reaction temperature}} for the reactive <b>hot</b> <b>pressing</b> between 1800 and 1900 °C {{was determined by}} reaction of the precursor at different temperatures from 900 to 1800 °C. The effective size reduction of precursors was investigated by vibration milling, which exhibited a critical role to achieve high densification and uniform microstructure. Also, it has affected the oxidation behavior of HfB 2 –SiC in air. Vibration milled sample showed uniform surface of SiO 2 layer, but sample which was fabricated by as-received powder exhibited non-uniform oxidation behavior. Examination of the mechanical properties showed that particle size reduction via vibration also led to improved flexural strength, hardness and fracture toughness.
