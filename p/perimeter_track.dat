25|$|The site is {{currently}} used for farming {{and only a}} few huts and the <b>perimeter</b> <b>track</b> are left.|$|E
25|$|With {{the end of}} {{military}} control, Steeple Morden was returned to agricultural use. The former airfield is virtually unrecognizable. A few single-width concrete farm roads, which are remnants of the <b>perimeter</b> <b>track</b> and runways are all that remains.|$|E
25|$|The {{airfield}} runways were a main of 5.775ft at 11/29, and ancillaries of 3,564ft at 05/23 and 4,101ft at 16/34. Two hardstands were of 150ft diameter {{pans and}} there were 33 loops connecting to an enclosing <b>perimeter</b> <b>track,</b> of a standard width of 50 feet.|$|E
50|$|Close by are {{the remains}} of the {{concrete}} runways and <b>perimeter</b> <b>tracks,</b> and the memorial garden and plinth dedicated to No. 106 Squadron. A ghostly young lady is said to haunt the area close to the airfield.|$|R
50|$|With {{the end of}} {{military}} control Snetterton Heath was privately purchased in 1952 {{with a view to}} using the runways and <b>perimeter</b> <b>tracks</b> as a motor racing circuit. The first motor cycle meeting was held in 1953 and the first motor races the following year.|$|R
2500|$|The {{airfield}} today {{still has}} {{bits of the}} old runways and <b>perimeter</b> <b>tracks</b> with hangars and dispersals easy to spot. The site also has two small industrial estates with the first being called [...] "Brockett Industrial Estate" [...] and the second [...] "Waterline Industrial Estate" [...] due to the close distance to the River Ouse.|$|R
25|$|Today the {{airfield}} {{is home to}} a small number of warehouses however the original basic layout can still be made out, including the runways and a large amount of the <b>perimeter</b> <b>track</b> which used to connect the runways with the dispersal hardstandings and the technical site.|$|E
25|$|In 1967 the Cotswold Gliding Club (CGC) {{moved to}} Aston Down, which in 1981 became surplus to {{requirements}} and {{was sold to}} the Club by the Ministry of Defence (MOD). Having since acquired further land, the CGC now owns most of the airfield within the <b>perimeter</b> <b>track.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1942, the Air Ministry {{decided to}} upgrade the {{airfield}} to bomber standard and, early in 1943, work began on laying concrete runways and the <b>perimeter</b> <b>track</b> to the Class A airfield standard, the main feature {{of which was a}} set of three converging runways each containing a concrete runway for takeoffs and landings, optimally placed at 60 degree angles to each other in a triangular pattern.|$|E
50|$|Nine airfields (Alconbury, Bassingbourn, Chelveston, Grafton Underwood, Kimbolton, Molesworth, Podington, Polebrook, and Thurleigh) were {{allotted to}} the Eighth Air Force {{but had been}} {{completed}} prior to the Class A standard for runway lengths. These were brought to Class A standards in 1942 and early 1943 by extending their runways, repositioning their <b>perimeter</b> <b>tracks,</b> and adding additional hardstands.|$|R
50|$|The {{airfield}} had a single, 6,000' x 100' asphalt runway, oriented 10/28 {{with two}} <b>perimeter</b> <b>tracks,</b> each containing about 50 aircraft parking hardstands. There {{may have been}} some temporary hangars and buildings, however it appears that personnel were quartered primarily in tents, and most aircraft maintenance took place in the open on hardstands. It also had a steel control tower.|$|R
50|$|The {{airfield}} had a single, 6,700' x 100' {{asphalt runway}} laid over Pierced Steel Planking, oriented 16/34. A second (unfinished) runway {{east of the}} main runway {{was used as a}} crash strip. There were two <b>perimeter</b> <b>tracks,</b> and several other loop taxiways each containing about 50 aircraft parking hardstands. The 99th used {{the west side of the}} field, and the RAF the east.|$|R
25|$|Today, rows {{of turkey}} houses line the runways. {{isolated}} {{from each other}} {{because this is an}} important requirement in escaping the infectious diseases to which turkeys are prone. The runways, <b>perimeter</b> <b>track,</b> {{and a few of the}} hardstands remain as does the control tower, now extensively renovated and used as offices by the owners of the airfield site. The briefing room and HQ block still exist, the latter being used as a private house.|$|E
25|$|Since the mid-1960s, {{the former}} base {{area has been}} used for pig farming and {{agricultural}} purposes, but the outlines of the airfield are still visible on aerial mapping. The airfield, guardhouse and control tower are all registered monuments. Additionally, the eastern <b>perimeter</b> <b>track</b> for the aircraft has been adapted for use as a local road. A study commissioned by the airfield's owners in 2000 declared that the airfield was beyond economic revival.|$|E
25|$|Attlebridge {{airfield}} had runways of 1,220, 1,120 and 1,080 yards length but, {{when the}} base was earmarked for USAAF use, these were extended and the airfield was enlarged to meet heavy bomber requirements. The main E-W runway was increased to 2,000 yards {{and the others}} to 1,400 yards each. The <b>perimeter</b> <b>track</b> was also extended {{and the number of}} hardstands was increased to fifty. In enlarging the airfield, several small, country roads were closed in the parish of Weston Longville, in which the larger part of the airfield was sited.|$|E
5000|$|The {{airfield}} had parallel, 6,000' x 100' asphalt runways laid over Pierced Steel Planking, oriented 13/31. There {{were two}} <b>perimeter</b> <b>tracks,</b> {{one on each}} side of the runways. [...] There may have been some temporary hangars and buildings, however it appears that personnel were quartered primarily in tents, and most aircraft maintenance took place in the open on hardstands. It also had a steel control tower.|$|R

25|$|The second Grand Prix at Silverstone was {{scheduled}} for May 1949 and was officially designated the British Grand Prix. It was to use the full <b>perimeter</b> <b>track</b> with a chicane inserted at Club Corner. The length of the second circuit was exactly three miles and the race run over 100 laps, making it the longest post-war Grand Prix held in England. There were again 25 starters and victory went to a 'San Remo' Maserati 4CLT/48, {{this time in the}} hands of Toulo de Graffenried, from Bob Gerard in his familiar ERA and Louis Rosier in a 4½-litre Talbot-Lago. The race average speed had risen to 77.31mph. The attendance was estimated at anything up to 120,000.|$|E
25|$|In 1952, the RAC {{decided it}} no longer wished to run the circuit, and on 1 January the lease was taken on by the BRDC, with James Brown {{continuing}} as track manager. The lease covered only the <b>perimeter</b> <b>track</b> and other areas at specific times. The original pits between Abbey and Woodcote were demolished, and new pit facilities were constructed between Woodcote and Copse. Coinciding with the BRDC taking over {{the running of the}} Grand Prix, there was a little unrest within the sport which led to the downgrading of Grand Prix racing to Formula Two, which was won by Alberto Ascari at 90.9mph from his Ferrari teammate Piero Taruffi – both driving the Tipo 500. The podium was completed by Mike Hawthorn driving a Cooper-Bristol T12.|$|E
25|$|On the <b>perimeter</b> <b>track,</b> {{visitors}} {{will find a}} grassed area, overlooking the sea, which was the original site of a Ngai Tai pa (see Maori Pa). This grassed area has a deep ditch whose internal bank would have once been much higher and topped with a strong palisade of posts. Ō-Manawatere is a relatively small pā. Maori were building pa (earthwork forts) throughout N.Z. starting from around the 16th century. In total they built about 7,000 mainly in the North Island. Most pa were not permanently lived in, but were built close to kainga (villages) and were designed as safe places in case of attack. The depressions inside the pā are pits, once roofed over and used for storing Kūmara tubers, but now largely infilled but still visible.|$|E
5000|$|The American Army Corps of Engineers {{rebuilt the}} {{facility}} into a heavy bomber-capable airfield. A 6,000' x 100' runway was laid over Pierced Steel Planking, oriented 14/32. A second (unfinished) runway {{east of the}} main runway {{was used as a}} crash strip. There were two <b>perimeter</b> <b>tracks,</b> and several other loop taxiways each containing about 100 aircraft parking hardstands. both of the double loop for bombers and single frying pan type for fighters. [...] There may have been some temporary hangars and buildings, however it appears that personnel were quartered primarily in tents, and most aircraft maintenance took place in the open on hardstands.

50|$|Refreshed {{and in part}} rebuilt, {{the camp}} {{includes}} extensive fitness and gymnasium facilities, with: a large fully equipped gymnasium; separate indoor arena for football and basketball; indoor swimming pool and squash and tennis courts. Outside is a climbing tower; an all-weather pitch; individual pitches for both football and rugby; and a camp <b>perimeter</b> circuit <b>track.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1983 the Montrose Air Station Heritage Trust was formed, today {{known as}} the Ian McIntosh Memorial Trust. In 1992 the trust {{purchased}} the Watch Office and ground, and created the Montrose Air Station Heritage Centre. They have since added more buildings and collections. Several historic buildings and hangars are still located on site, and the <b>perimeter</b> taxi <b>track</b> is still largely intact.|$|R
25|$|The {{next year}} the Royal Automobile Club took a lease on the {{airfield}} and set out a more formal racing circuit. Their first two races were held on the runways themselves, with long straights separated by tight hairpin corners, the track demarcated by hay bales. However, for the 1949 International Trophy meeting, {{it was decided to}} switch to the <b>perimeter</b> <b>track.</b> This arrangement was used for the 1950 and 1951 Grands Prix. In 1952 the start line was moved from the Farm Straight to the straight linking Woodcote and Copse corners, and this layout remained largely unaltered for the following 38 years. For the 1975 meeting a chicane was introduced to try to tame speeds through the mighty Woodcote Corner (although MotoGP would still use the circuit without the chicane up until 1986), and Bridge Corner was subtly rerouted in 1987.|$|E
25|$|It was snowing and the {{airfield}} at Croydon {{was covered in}} dark snow clouds when at 11:40 the Spencer Airways Dakota attempted to depart bound for Salisbury in Rhodesia. The C-47A had just lifted from the runway at Croydon when the starboard wing dropped, then the aircraft turned {{to the left and}} the port wing dropped. The pilot was seen to apply full starboard aileron but the bank angle increased to 40 degrees with the port wing tip only {{a few feet from the}} ground. As the aircraft reached the <b>perimeter</b> <b>track</b> of {{the airfield}}, the aircraft levelled and then swung to the right. The aircraft bounced on the ground and crashed head-on into a parked CSA Douglas C-47; both aircraft caught fire, and were subsequently destroyed. Eleven of the 18 passengers and one of the five crew died.|$|E
2500|$|With {{the end of}} {{military}} control, the airfield was largely returned to agricultural use {{with most of the}} <b>perimeter</b> <b>track,</b> runways and hardstands removed. A small airstrip was built on a part of the former <b>perimeter</b> <b>track</b> which is used for light aircraft. [...] The control tower was restored in 1977 and was turned into the 100th Bomb Group Memorial Museum. Several World War II era buildings remain in various states of decay.|$|E
50|$|Amendola Airfield a pre-war Italian Air Force (Regia Aeronautica) facility, built about 1931. With the {{surrender}} of Fascist Italy to the Allies on 3 September 1943, the German Luftwaffe seized control of the field upon hearing of Italy's capitulation, and briefly {{used it as a}} combat airfield, however Allied forces seized control of the Tavoliere plain in late September/October and occupied the airfield.The United States Army Corps of Engineers rebuilt the facility into a heavy bomber-capable airfield. it had two 6,000' x 100' runways laid over Pierced Steel Planking, oriented 11/29. There were two <b>perimeter</b> <b>tracks,</b> and several other loop taxiways each containing about 100 aircraft parking hardstands. both of the double loop for bombers and single frying pan type for fighters. There may have been some temporary hangars and buildings, however it appears that personnel were quartered primarily in tents, and most aircraft maintenance took place in the open on hardstands.

50|$|Scotstown GAA {{play their}} home {{fixtures}} at Páirc Mhuire/Saint Mary's Park, {{half a mile}} to the north-east of the village of Scotstown. Facilities at the ground include dressing rooms, meeting room, sports complex, covered stand, social club and a handball alley. The club training grounds are located at Kilmore East, between the villages of Scotstown and Ballinode. Facilities at the training grounds include dressing rooms, a full-sized Prunty pitch, two smaller training pitches and a <b>perimeter</b> walking/running <b>track.</b>|$|R
40|$|A system using Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAVs), {{equipped}} for real time telemetry of video imagery, sensor support data, and GPS/INS navigation, {{is being developed}} to provide situational awareness (SA) to the central command of mass casualty incident response. UAVs provide an inexpensive and safe means of acquiring video surveillance in chaotic disaster scenes, while being durable and non-intrusive. The system provides autonomous surveillance of defined <b>perimeters,</b> video <b>tracking</b> and active following of targets of interest, and real time cueing to other imaging UAVs...|$|R
2500|$|Reopened in 1959 as an RAF Bomber Command Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile (IRBM) launch {{facility}} {{and placed on}} a high DEFCON 2 launch alert during the Cuban Missile Crisis, the station was finally closed and decommissioned in 1963. [...] The site has been returned to agricultural use and now has little evidence of its former use, other than several lengths of <b>perimeter</b> <b>track</b> and the original air traffic control tower.|$|E
2500|$|CGC {{was formed}} in 1964. It was {{initially}} based at Long Newnton airfield near Tetbury, but in 1967 moved to its current home, Aston Down—at that time still a military airfield. In 1980-1, {{with the help of}} Sports Council grants and other loans, the Club purchased {{a large part of the}} airfield when it was auctioned off by the Ministry of Defence. [...] Having since acquired further land, CGC now owns most of the airfield within the <b>perimeter</b> <b>track.</b>|$|E
2500|$|There are picnic {{areas and}} {{barbecue}} facilities, {{making it an}} ideal place for a family outing. There is also a children's playground. Volleyball is often played on the grass area beside the beach where trees provide ample shade. Kayaking is also an interest for some people visiting the park. [...] It has wheelchair access, drinking water from taps, campervan and camping sites (booking essential), even dogs can be walked on a leash around the <b>perimeter</b> <b>track.</b>|$|E
50|$|The biggest {{attraction}} of Ramakrishna Nagar is the Lingambudhi Park. It is a sprawling bamboo forest with two kilometer <b>perimeter</b> walking <b>track</b> near the Lingambudhi Lake. This lake {{is rich in}} the diversity of flora and fauna. The lake was constructed in 1828 and continues to have a rural charm {{in the middle of}} the city. In addition to the park, there is an embankment on the lake which is suitable for walking and jogging. The road around the lake connects Rabindranath Tagore Layout with Srirampura bus stop.|$|R
5000|$|There are {{numerous}} snail racing events {{that take place}} in different places around the world, though the majority take place in the United Kingdom.Snail races usually take place on a circular track with the snails starting in the middle and racing to the <b>perimeter.</b> The <b>track</b> usually {{takes the form of a}} damp cloth atop a table. [...] The radius is traditionally set at 13 or 14 inches. Racing numbers are painted on the shells or small stickers or tags are placed on them to distinguish each competitor.|$|R
50|$|The 382 m velodrome was {{constructed}} in 1960 with a <b>perimeter</b> for <b>track</b> cycling and a grassy infield for soccer games. Every winter, the velodrome was flooded to create a speed skating rink. Over the years, the track served as a practice rink for members of multiple U.S. Winter Olympics teams. In the 1990s, the District ceased the annual conversion of the velodrome into an ice rink due to the facility's inability to retain water, which seeped through the soccer field. Ed Harvey, the District director, attributed this to a lowering of the water table caused by construction in the late 1980s.|$|R
