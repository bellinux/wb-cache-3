The <b>poults</b> from one sire (HBW) weighed more at hatching than those from the other sire (LBW). Survival of the heavier <b>poults</b> was poor indicating metabolic insufficiencies. A significant positive correlation was noted between hatchling body weights and blood glucose concentration (Christensen et al., 2000 a), and this was accompanied by depressed gluconeogenesis in HBW <b>poults.</b> The hypothesis was proposed that the HBW <b>poults</b> with elevated plasma glucose concentrations might have greater glucose absorption from intestinal tissue than did the LBW <b>poults.</b> The data confirmed heavier weights in HBW <b>poults</b> than LBW, and HBW jejunum weight relative to body weight was {{less than that of}} LBW. The <b>poults</b> did not differ in intestinal length, glucose transport, maltase activities or plasma triiodothyronine and thyroxine or glucose concentrations. The HBW <b>poults</b> also utilized less yolk during development than did the LBW indicating that the HBW embryos rely more on gluconeogenesis for survival during development than do the LBW.

40|$|ABSTRACT Biotin {{bioavailability}} {{was estimated}} in canola meal (CM), various cereal grains, and protein supplements using turkey poults in a growth bioassay study. Following a 10 -day pretest period to deplete the biotin reserves of newly hatched poults, triplicate groups (seven poults each) were fed a basal diet without added biotin, or supplemented with graded levels of d-biotin (100, 200, and 400 |ig/kg) for 21 days. <b>Poult</b> growth (y, g/day) {{was positively related}} to biotin intake (x, u,g/day), as follows: y = 3. 05 x + 4. 32, r =. 997 (P<. 01). Similar groups of poults were fed test ingredients: CM, soybean meal (SBM), or soyprotein isolate (SPI) incorporated at levels of 25 % into the diet by partial replacement of casein and carbohydrates; other <b>poult</b> groups were given cereal grain (25 %) or cereal grain (25 %) + CM (25 %) included in the SPI-based diet. Use of the regression equation to compute bioavailable biotin gave bioavailability values (in percentages) that were low for triticale (15. 9), wheat (17. 0), barley (19. 2), and sorghum (29. 5), moderate for CM (65. 4) and SBM (76. 8), and high for corn (95. 2). The combination of CM and cereal substantially increased the total biotin available for <b>poult</b> growth, with individual biotin contribution being strongly additive for CM plus barley, sorghum, or wheat, but less so in case of CM plus corn or triticale diets. Therefore, CM seems to be a good source of bioavailable biotin for starting poults. Increased levels of bioavailable biotin reduced the incidence of pathological signs (dermatitis, hock disorders, and broken feathers) and also <b>poult</b> mortality. The results suggest that adequate biotin status might be indicated by plasma or liver biotin concentrations in excess of 3, 200 ng/L or 4, 200 ng/g, respectively...|$|E

Vitamin D-deficient <b>poults</b> developed ricketic changes during days 10 to 14. Control <b>poults</b> (deficient diet plus vitamin D) did not develop rickets. In deficient <b>poults,</b> lengths of proliferating-prehypertrophied zones of growth plates increased {{significantly in the}} proximal tibiotarsus but were only slightly elongated in the distal tibiotarsus. Unmineralized hypertrophic chondrocyte zones increased in length rapidly {{in conjunction with a}} decrease in the length of mineralized hypertrophic degenerative zones; this occurred more rapidly in proximal than in distal tibiotarsus. Other ricketic changes included decreases in bone ash, total femoral bone ash (calcium, phosphorus, magnesium), bone length, and body weight.
