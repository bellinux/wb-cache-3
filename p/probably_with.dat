5|$|It is {{very obvious}} to me that you must remove Sir George Prevost. I see he has gone to war about trifles with the general {{officers}} I sent him, which are certainly the best of their rank in the army; and his subsequent failure and distresses will be aggravated by that circumstance; and will <b>probably</b> <b>with</b> the usual fairness of the public be attributed to it.|$|E
5|$|Maya stelae were {{worked with}} stone chisels and <b>probably</b> <b>with</b> wooden mallets. Hammerstones were {{fashioned}} from flint and basalt and {{were used for}} shaping the softer rocks used to make stelae, while fine detail was completed with smaller chisels. Originally most were probably brightly painted in red, yellow, black, blue and other colours using mineral and organic pigments. At Copán and some other Maya cities, some traces of these pigments were found upon the monuments.|$|E
5|$|At {{times during}} the last interglacial period (130,000– 70,000 BCE) Europe had a climate warmer than today's, and early humans may have {{made their way to}} what is now Scotland, though archaeologists have found no traces of this. Glaciers then scoured their way across most of Britain, and only after the ice retreated did Scotland again become habitable, around 9600 BCE. Mesolithic {{hunter-gatherer}} encampments formed the first known settlements, and archaeologists have dated a site near Biggar to around 8500 BCE. Numerous other sites found around Scotland build up a picture of highly mobile boat-using people making tools from bone, stone and antlers, <b>probably</b> <b>with</b> a very low density of population.|$|E

5|$|Edward {{left for}} the Eighth Crusade, led by Louis of France, in 1270, but Henry became {{increasingly}} ill; concerns about a fresh rebellion grew {{and the next year}} the King wrote to his son asking him to return to England, but Edward did not turn back. Henry recovered slightly and announced his renewed intention to join the crusades himself, but he never regained his full health and on the evening of 16 November 1272, Henry died in Westminster, <b>probably</b> <b>with</b> Eleanor in attendance. He was succeeded by Edward, who slowly made his way back to England via Gascony, finally arriving in August 1274.|$|E
5|$|Further {{armament}} was {{to consist}} of a 128mm anti-tank gun of the type used in the Jagdtiger or Maus, two 15mm Mauser MG 151/15 autocannons, and eight 20mm Flak 38 anti-aircraft guns, <b>probably</b> <b>with</b> at least four {{of them as a}} Flakvierling quad mount. The 128mm anti-tank gun's precise location on the Ratte is a point of contention among historians, most believing {{that it would have been}} mounted within the primary turret, with some others thinking a smaller secondary turret at the rear of the Ratte more logical. Some concept drawings exist to suggest a flexible mount on the glacis plate. The tank was to be provided with a vehicle bay that could hold two BMW R12 motorcycles for scouting, and several smaller storage rooms, a compact infirmary area, and a self-contained lavatory system.|$|E
5|$|In {{his final}} period, Shakespeare turned to romance or tragicomedy and {{completed}} three more major plays: Cymbeline, The Winter's Tale, and The Tempest, {{as well as}} the collaboration, Pericles, Prince of Tyre. Less bleak than the tragedies, these four plays are graver in tone than the comedies of the 1590s, but they end with reconciliation and the forgiveness of potentially tragic errors. Some commentators have seen this change in mood as evidence of a more serene view of life on Shakespeare's part, but it may merely reflect the theatrical fashion of the day. Shakespeare collaborated on two further surviving plays, Henry VIII and The Two Noble Kinsmen, <b>probably</b> <b>with</b> John Fletcher.|$|E

5|$|Mammals signal by {{a variety}} of means. Many give visual anti-predator signals, as when deer and gazelle stot, {{honestly}} indicating their fit condition and their ability to escape, or when white-tailed deer and other prey mammals flag with conspicuous tail markings when alarmed, informing the predator that it has been detected. Many mammals make use of scent-marking, sometimes possibly to help defend territory, but <b>probably</b> <b>with</b> a range of functions both within and between species. Microbats and toothed whales including oceanic dolphins vocalize both socially and in echolocation.|$|E
5|$|The Canadian {{entomologist}} C.H. Curran's 1945 book, Insects of the Pacific World, noted {{women from}} India and Sri Lanka, who kept 1 1/2 inch long, iridescent greenish coppery beetles {{of the species}} Chrysochroa ocellata as pets. These living jewels were worn on festive occasions, <b>probably</b> <b>with</b> a small chain attached to one leg anchored to the clothing to prevent escape. Afterwards, the insects were bathed, fed, and housed in decorative cages. Living jewelled beetles have also been worn and kept as pets in Mexico.|$|E
5|$|The {{demographic}} {{history of}} Scotland includes {{all aspects of}} population history {{in what is now}} Scotland. Scotland may have been first occupied in the last interglacial period (130,000–70,000 BCE), but the earliest surviving archaeological evidence of human settlement is of Mesolithic hunter-gatherer encampments. These suggest a highly mobile boat-using people, <b>probably</b> <b>with</b> a very low density of population. Neolithic farming brought permanent settlements dating from 3500 BCE, and greater concentrations of population. Evidence of hillforts and other buildings suggest a growing settled population. Changes in the scale of woodland indicates that the Roman invasions from the first century CE had a negative impact on the native population.|$|E

5|$|The young Henry FitzEmpress {{returned}} to England again in 1149, this time planning {{to form a}} northern alliance with Ranulf of Chester. The Angevin plan involved Ranulf agreeing {{to give up his}} claim to Carlisle, held by the Scots, in return for being given the rights to the whole of the Honour of Lancaster; Ranulf would give homage to both David and Henry Fitzempress, with Henry having seniority. Following this peace agreement, Henry and Ranulf agreed to attack York, <b>probably</b> <b>with</b> help from the Scots. Stephen marched rapidly north to York and the planned attack disintegrated, leaving Henry to return to Normandy, where he was declared duke by his father.|$|E
5|$|Arab sources {{indicate}} that at about his time, the Sogdian princes called upon the Western Turks or the Turgesh for help against the Arabs, although the chronology and veracity of these accounts {{is open to}} question. At any rate, {{over the next two}} years Qutayba engaged in an effort to push the Caliphate's borders further and gain control of the Jaxartes valley. A large force, supported by some 20,000 Transoxianian levies, marched into the valley in early 713. The native levies were dispatched against Shash, which was reportedly taken, while Qutayba with the Arabs marched in the direction of Khujand and Ferghana. Little is known of these expeditions, although successful battles are recorded before Khujand and at Minak in Ushrusana, and the dispatch of an Arab embassy to the Chinese court is verified by Chinese sources. Al-Tabari reports that Qutayba marched into Chinese-held territory up to Kashgar, but this claim is dismissed by modern scholars. In 714, Qutayba renewed his expeditions along the Jaxartes, <b>probably</b> <b>with</b> Shash as his base, but his campaign was cut short upon receiving the news of the death of al-Hajjaj. Unsure of his position now that his patron was gone, he disbanded the army and returned to Merv.|$|E
5|$|HD 93083 is {{an orange}} dwarf star of {{spectral}} type K3V that is smaller and cooler than the Sun. It has a planet that {{was discovered by}} the radial velocity method with the HARPS spectrograph in 2005. About as massive as Saturn, the planet orbits its star with a period of 143 days at a mean distance of 0.477 AU. WASP-66 is a sunlike star of spectral type F4V. A planet with 2.3 times the mass of Jupiter orbits it every 4 days, discovered by the transit method in 2012. DEN 1048-3956 is a brown dwarf of spectral type M8 located around 13 light-years distant from Earth. At magnitude 17 it is much too faint {{to be seen with}} the unaided eye. It has a surface temperature of about 2500 K. Two powerful flares lasting 4–5 minutes each were detected in 2002. 2MASS 0939-2448 is a system of two cool and faint brown dwarfs, <b>probably</b> <b>with</b> effective temperatures of about 500 and 700 K and masses of about 25 and 40 times that of Jupiter, though {{it is also possible that}} both objects have temperatures of 600 K and 30 Jupiter masses.|$|E

5|$|Henry {{returned}} to England in 1147, {{when he was}} fourteen. Taking his immediate household and {{a small number of}} mercenaries, he left Normandy and landed in England, striking into Wiltshire. Despite initially causing considerable panic, the expedition had little success, and Henry found himself unable to pay his forces and therefore unable to return to Normandy. Neither his mother nor his uncle were prepared to support him, implying that they had not approved of the expedition in the first place. Surprisingly, Henry instead turned to King Stephen, who paid the outstanding wages and thereby allowed Henry to retire gracefully. Stephen's reasons for doing so are unclear. One potential explanation is his general courtesy to a member of his extended family; another is that he was starting to consider how to end the war peacefully, and saw this as a way of building a relationship with Henry. Henry intervened once again in 1149, commencing what is often termed the Henrician phase of the civil war. This time, Henry planned to form a northern alliance with King David I of Scotland, Henry's great-uncle, and Ranulf of Chester, a powerful regional leader who controlled most of the north-west of England. Under this alliance, Henry and Ranulf agreed to attack York, <b>probably</b> <b>with</b> help from the Scots. The planned attack disintegrated after Stephen marched rapidly north to York, and Henry {{returned to}} Normandy.|$|E
5|$|Jersey {{was part}} of Neustria with the same Gallo-Frankish {{population}} as the continental mainland. Jersey, the whole Channel Islands and the Cotentin peninsula (<b>probably</b> <b>with</b> the Avranchin) came formerly {{under the control of}} the duke of Brittany during the Viking invasions, because the king of the Franks was unable to defend them, however they remained in the archbishopric of Rouen. Jersey was invaded by Vikings in the 9th century. In 933 it was annexed to the future Duchy of Normandy, together with the other Channel Islands, Cotentin and Avranchin, by William Longsword, count of Rouen and it became one of the Norman Islands. When William's descendant, William the Conqueror, conquered England in 1066, the Duchy of Normandy and the kingdom of England were governed under one monarch. The Dukes of Normandy owned considerable estates in the island, and Norman families living on their estates established many of the historical Norman-French Jersey family names. King John lost all his territories in mainland Normandy in 1204 to King Philip II Augustus, but retained possession of Jersey and the other Channel Islands.|$|E
5|$|Nicholson was <b>probably</b> <b>with</b> the {{regiment}} when it put down Monmouth's Rebellion in 1685, but {{his role in}} some of the more unsavory behaviour on the part of Kirke's troops is unknown. Kirke, who had been selected by Charles II as the governor of the prospective Dominion of New England, was strongly criticized {{for his role in the}} quashing of the rebellion, and James withdrew his nomination. The dominion's governorship instead went to Sir Edmund Andros, and Nicholson, now a captain, accompanied Andros as commander of a company of infantry to Boston in October 1686. Andros sent Nicholson on what was essentially a reconnaissance mission to French Acadia. Under the cover of delivering a letter protesting a variety of issues to the Acadian governor, Nicholson made careful observations of Port Royal's defenses. Nicholson impressed Andros in this service, and was soon appointed to the dominion's council.|$|E

5|$|Stephen's {{early life}} was heavily {{influenced}} by {{his relationship with his}} uncle Henry I. Henry seized power in England following the death of his elder brother William Rufus. In 1106 he invaded and captured the Duchy of Normandy, controlled by his eldest brother, Robert Curthose, defeating Robert's army at the battle of Tinchebray. Henry then found himself in conflict with Louis VI of France, who took the opportunity to declare Robert's son William Clito the Duke of Normandy. Henry responded by forming a network of alliances with the western counties of France against Louis, resulting in a regional conflict that would last throughout Stephen's early life. Adela and Theobald allied themselves with Henry, and Stephen's mother decided to place him in Henry's court. Henry fought his next military campaign in Normandy, from 1111 onwards, where rebels led by Robert of Bellême were opposing his rule. Stephen was <b>probably</b> <b>with</b> Henry during the military campaign of 1112, when he was knighted by the King, and was definitely present at court during the King's visit to the Abbey of Saint-Evroul in 1113. Stephen probably first visited England in either 1113 or 1115, almost certainly as part of Henry's court.|$|E
