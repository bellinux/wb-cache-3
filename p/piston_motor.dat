50|$|With various configurations, Hydraulic {{starters}} can {{be fitted}} on any engine. Hydraulic starters employ the high {{efficiency of the}} axial <b>piston</b> <b>motor</b> concept, which provides high torque at any temperature or environment, and guarantees minimal wear of the engine ring gear and the pinion.|$|E
50|$|Pumping brakes {{are often}} used where a pump is already part of the machinery. For example, an {{internal}}-combustion <b>piston</b> <b>motor</b> can have the fuel supply stopped, and then internal pumping losses of the engine create some braking. Some engines use a valve override called a Jake brake to greatly increase pumping losses. Pumping brakes can dump energy as heat, or can be regenerative brakes that recharge a pressure reservoir called a hydraulic accumulator.|$|E

5000|$|The single-cam-type radial <b>piston</b> <b>motor</b> {{exists in}} many {{different}} designs itself. Usually the difference lies {{in the way the}} fluid is distributed to the different pistons or cylinders, and also the design of the cylinders themselves. Some motors have pistons attached to the cam using rods (much like in an internal combustion engine), while others employ floating [...] "shoes", and even spherical contact telescopic cylinders like the Parker Denison Calzoni type. Each design has its own set of pros and cons, such as freewheeling ability, high volumetric efficiency, high reliability and so on.|$|E
50|$|Wankel engines can be {{classified}} by their geometric size in terms of radius (rotor center to tip distance, also the median stator radius) and depth (rotor thickness), and offset (crank throw, eccentricity, also 1/4 the difference between stator's major and minor axes). These metrics function similarly to the bore and stroke measurements of a piston engine. Displacement is 3√3radius·offset·depth, multiplied {{with the number of}} rotors (note that this only counts a single face of each rotor as the entire rotor's displacement, and is of course incorrect as there are three faces, equivalent to three piston faces, per rotor, i.e. equivalent to a three-cylinder radial <b>piston</b> <b>motor</b> per rotor). Nearly all Mazda production Wankel engines share a single rotor radius, 105 mm (4.1 in), with a 15 mm (0.6 in) crankshaft offset. The only engine to diverge from this formula was the rare 13A, which used a 120 mm (4.7 in) rotor radius and 17.5 mm (0.7 in) crankshaft offset.|$|E

5000|$|In {{order to}} achieve linear motion from {{compressed}} air, a system of pistons is most commonly used. The compressed air is fed into an air-tight chamber that houses the shaft of the piston. Also inside this chamber a spring is coiled around the shaft of the piston in order to hold the chamber completely open when air is not being pumped into the chamber. As air is fed into the chamber the force on the piston shaft begins to overcome the force being exerted on the spring. As more air is fed into the chamber, the pressure increases and the piston begins to move down the chamber. When it reaches its maximum length the air pressure is released from the chamber and the spring completes the cycle by closing off the chamber to return to its original position. [...] <b>Piston</b> <b>motors</b> are {{the most commonly used}} in hydraulic systems. Essentially, <b>piston</b> <b>motors</b> are the same as hydraulic motors except they are used to convert hydraulic energy into mechanical energy. <b>Piston</b> <b>motors</b> are often used in series of two, three, four, five, or six cylinders that are enclosed in a housing. This allows for more power to be delivered by the <b>pistons</b> because several <b>motors</b> are in sync with each other at certain times of their cycle.|$|R

40|$|Most present wind, wave, and {{tidal energy}} systems require {{expensive}} power conditioning systems that reduce overall efficiency. This new design eliminates power conditioning all, or nearly all, of the time. Wind, wave, and tidal energy systems can transmit their energy to pumps that send high-pressure fluid {{to a central}} power production area. The central power production area can consist {{of a series of}} hydraulic generators. The hydraulic generators can be variable displacement generators such that the RPM, and thus the voltage, remains constant, eliminating the need for further power conditioning. A series of wind blades is attached to a series of radial piston pumps, which pump fluid to a series of axial <b>piston</b> <b>motors</b> attached to generators. As the wind is reduced, the amount of energy is reduced, and the number of active hydraulic generators can be reduced to maintain a nearly constant RPM. If the axial <b>piston</b> <b>motors</b> have variable displacement, an exact RPM can be maintained for all, or nearly all, wind speeds. Analyses have been performed that show over 20 % performance improvements with this technique over conventional wind turbine...|$|R
50|$|A {{pneumatic}} motor (Air motor) or compressed air engine {{is a type}} of motor which does mechanical work by expanding compressed air. Pneumatic motors generally convert the compressed air energy to mechanical work through either linear or rotary motion.

40|$|The safing and arming {{systems of}} most {{artillery}} projectiles in common use have a signature provided by setback forces {{arising from the}} acceleration of the projectile upon firing. To obviate the possibility of accidental arming through dropping or jolting of a round, a second signature is desirable. In projectiles fired from rifled guns the spin imparted by the rifling supplies a centrifugal force that acts as the second signature to complete the fuze arming cyrle. However, In fin-stabilized rounds, since spin is absent, another means must be found for supplying the second arming signature. To obtain such a signature {{it was decided to}} employ rwo magnetic transducers positioned near the surface of the projectile. These transducers sense a change in magnetic flux when the projectile leaves the permeable gun barrel, and emit an electrical pulse that activates a <b>piston</b> <b>motor</b> in the arming mechanism which in turn com-pletes the arming process...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a dynamic model for slipper-pads which allows lift and tilt behaviour to be predicted, including {{the effects of}} possible contact with the swashplate or slipper retaining plate. This model has been incorporated in the Bathfp simulation package and {{used to examine the}} dynamic stability of slipper-pads over the pumping cycle, and to compare the behaviour over a range of pump speeds. The centripetal tilting moments acting on the slipper-pad increase with speed and as a consequence can lead to contact between the slipper and the swashplate at high speed. This is particularly likely to occur as the piston makes the transition between suction and delivery, where the pressure forces acting on the piston-slipper assembly change abruptly. The predicted nature of the swashplate contacts at high speeds correspond closely with witness marks on a dismantled pump. The model presented may also be used for predicting slipper behaviour in other types of pump, for example wobble-plate type pumps, or in <b>piston</b> <b>motor...</b>|$|E
