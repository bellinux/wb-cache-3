5|$|On 22 March 1990, Achebe {{was riding}} in a car to Lagos when an axle {{collapsed}} and the car flipped. His son Ikechukwu and the driver suffered minor injuries, but {{the weight of the}} vehicle fell on Achebe and his spine was severely damaged. He was flown to the Paddocks Hospital in Buckinghamshire, England, and treated for his injuries. In July doctors announced that although he was recuperating well, he was <b>paralyzed</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> waist down and would require the use of a wheelchair {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E

Although she has made an almost full recovery from the incident, late in 2009 she was still suffering from minor symptoms in hands and feet related to nerve injury. Bågenholm's case has been discussed in the leading British medical journal The Lancet, and in medical textbooks.|$|E
5|$|After the ISIS agents reunite and Drake's mutinous crew {{agrees to}} {{surrender}} {{in order to}} prevent his death, Drake has a mental breakdown, declaring humanity to be doomed and killing himself with Pam's rifle. Cyril, startled by the sudden gunfire, opens fire himself, killing three people (one of whom was the only capable pilot of the shuttle other than Drake). To worsen the situation, Barry Dylan (Dave Willis) challenges Archer to fight him in space. Despite the rigorous taunting and demeaning from Barry, Archer ultimately declines his offer. After Archer makes an act of humility, Cyril aims the launches at Barry's jet, subsequently stranding him on Horizon. As the group nears the airstrip, Archer, who wishes to take credit for the landing, messes with the steering shift, causing the spacecraft to crash. Afterwards, every ISIS agent except for Archer is shown to be injured as a result, especially Ray, who is now <b>paralyzed</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> waist down (which he ironically had pretended to be earlier in the season).|$|E
50|$|On April 10, 1994, Gino Thompson {{was thrown}} {{from his seat}} when the police van {{carrying}} him stopped suddenly. Thompson sustained a spinal cord injury which <b>paralyzed</b> him <b>from</b> <b>the</b> waist down. Thompson was awarded $600,000.|$|R

5|$|With Fate and Other Worlds launched, Palmer {{began to}} plan for a new magazine, to be called Imagination. Material {{for the first two}} issues had been {{assembled}} by mid-1950, but in the early summer Palmer fell down his basement stairs and was left <b>paralyzed</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> waist down. While he was hospitalized, much of the work of editing both Other Worlds and Imagination was done by Mahaffey, who coped well, despite her inexperience. An assistant, Marge Budwig Saunder, was hired to read the slush pile and help out. The magazine's first issue, dated October 1950 on a planned bi-monthly schedule, appeared on news stands 1 August 1950. However, in September that year, Ziff-Davis made the decision to move to New York from Chicago; Palmer promptly contacted William Hamling, {{who did not want to}} relocate and suggested that Hamling take over Imagination. Like Palmer, Hamling had made preparations to leave Ziff-Davis by establishing a separate publishing company, Greenleaf Publishing, and in November 1950 Hamling left Ziff-Davis and became Imaginations editor and publisher.|$|E

50|$|At {{the request}} of Warmbier's family, an autopsy was not performed, and only a postmortem {{external}} examination was conducted. Doctors speculated {{that the cause of}} death could have been a blood clot, pneumonia, sepsis or kidney failure. Sleeping pills could have caused Warmbier to stop breathing if he had botulism and was <b>paralyzed</b> <b>from</b> it. <b>The</b> University of Cincinnati doctors found no evidence of botulism, but several neurologists said that botulism cannot be ruled out, given the length of time before Warmbier's return to the US.|$|R

50|$|They withdrew {{their support}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Darkstars. This made {{many of the}} early Darkstar uniforms useless, as they relied on energy {{transmitted}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Controllers. The later, self-contained suits were unaffected. Many Darkstars were killed or lost their battlesuits in combat against Grayven, son of Darkseid, on the planet Rann. Grayven also crippled John Stewart, <b>paralyzing</b> him <b>from</b> <b>the</b> waist down. Green Lantern Kyle Rayner ended the battle, but the Darkstars were shattered by the losses. In the end, only four Darkstars remained to help rebuild Ranagar.|$|R
50|$|After 1989, {{the artist}} is very productive, but a sense of unease, perhaps the slow onset of a disease, cast a shadow over her work. She is {{gradually}} entering depression, even though never fully acknowledged, and fights a deteriorating physical health. None of which prevents her from working. In 1995 she starts having early forms of numbness {{and at some point}} she <b>paralyzes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> upper chest down. Her hands, especially the right hand are still free. It is a year of extreme misery, during which she continues working in bed, switching medium {{for the first time in}} years. The drawings, watercolors, mixed media on neat 11x17 in. paper from art supplies brought by a faithful friend from Paris, are an emotional tribute to creativity, and the role of art as companion and motivator at the end of life. She was taken almost any freedom away, and any hope, but she drew more than a hundred elaborate, spontaneous works that, if we could forget the circumstances, almost signal a renaissance of her talent. As an artist, this period is significant and the art is not a consolation of greater means: it is as good, only different.|$|R

25|$|The lead {{elements}} of Sedgwick's VI Corps reached Saunders Field at 3 p.m., {{by which time}} Warren's men had ceased fighting.

25|$|Byrd had a {{prominent}} role in the 2008 Warner Bros. documentary Body of War directed by Phil Donahue.

Several long clips of Byrd show him passionately arguing against authorizing {{the use of force in}} Iraq. Later in the movie, Byrd has a one-on-one interview with Tomas Young in Byrd's Senate office, followed by a shot of Byrd walking beside the wheelchair-bound Young as they leave the Capitol.|$|E
25|$|Alabama Governor George Wallace, an anti-integrationist, {{did well}} in the South (he won every county in the Florida primary) and among alienated and {{dissatisfied}} voters in the North.

Wallace was struck by five bullets and left <b>paralyzed</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> waist down. The day after the assassination attempt, Wallace won the Michigan and Maryland primaries, but the shooting effectively ended his campaign and he pulled out in July.|$|E
