25|$|A novel biodegradable, tough {{elastomer}} {{has been}} developed from <b>poly(glycerol</b> sebacate) (PGS) for use in creation of a nerve guidance conduit. PGS was originally developed for soft tissue engineering purposes to specifically mimic ECM mechanical properties. It is considered an elastomer because {{it is able to}} recover from deformation in mechanically dynamic environments and to effectively distribute stress evenly throughout regenerating tissues in the form of microstresses. PGS is synthesized by a polycondensation reaction of glycerol and sebacic acid, which can be melt processed or solvent processed into the desired shape. PGS has a Young's modulus of 0.28 MPa and an ultimate tensile strength greater than 0.5 MPa. Peripheral nerve has a Young's modulus of approximately 0.45 MPa, which is very close to that of PGS. Additionally, PGS experiences surface degradation, accompanied by losses in linear mass and strength during resorption. Following implantation, the degradation half-life was determined to be 21 days; complete degradation occurred at day 60. PGS experiences minimal water absorption during degradation and does not have detectable swelling; swelling can cause distortion, which narrows the tubular lumen and can impede regeneration. It is advantageous that the degradation time of PGS can be varied by changing the degree of crosslinking and the ratio of sebacic acid to glycerol. In a study by Sundback et al. (2005), implanted PGS and PLGA conduits had similar early tissue responses; however, PLGA inflammatory responses spiked later, while PGS inflammatory responses continued to decreases.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{solution}} {{structure of}} hyperbranched macromolecules was investigated {{by means of}} small-angle neutron scattering (SANS). Hyperbranched <b>polyglycerols</b> of different molecular weight were investigated in D 2 O and CD 3 OD, and very similar molar masses and radii of gyration were obtained in both solvents. Kratky plots of the scattering intensity revealed a compact structure of the hyperbranched <b>polyglycerols.</b> A power law scaling relation of the radius of gyration with molar mass was observed, from which a dimension of three was obtained. These observations indicate that the hyperbranched structure prevents strong irregular association despite the high functionality of hydroxyl groups {{that could lead to}} aggregation in those solvents. Amphiphilic derivatives of the hyperbranched <b>polyglycerols</b> have been studied in the nonpolar solvent C 6 D 6. Again, molecularly dispersed polymers were found provided the degree of esterification was sufficiently high. A low degree of derivatization of only 22 % was not sufficient to prevent aggregation in C 6 D 6. The macromolecules become more compact when the degree of esterification increases...|$|R

Understanding the mechanism of the extraordinarily strong adhesive bonds of the catechol group will likely aid {{in the development of}} adhesives. With this aim, we study the adhesion of catechol-based adhesives to metal oxides on the molecular level using atomic force microscopy (AFM). The comparison of single catechols (dopamine) with multiple catechols on hyperbranched <b>polyglycerols</b> (hPG) at various pH and dwell times allowed us to further increase our understanding.

The selective etherification of glycerol to higher oligomers was studied {{in the presence of}} CaO colloids and the data are compared with those obtained from NaOH and CaO. The materials were prepared by dispersing CaO, CaCO 3, or Ca(OH) 2 onto a carbon nanofiber (CNF) support. Colloidal nanoparticles were subsequently dispensed from the CNF into the reaction mixture to give CaO colloids that have a higher activity than equimolar amounts of bulk CaO and NaOH. Optimization of the reaction conditions allowed us to obtain a product with Gardner color number < 2, containing no acrolein and minimal cyclic byproducts. The differences in the CaO colloids originating from CNF and bulk CaO were probed using light scattering and conductivity measurements. The results confirmed that the higher activity of the colloids originating from CaO/CNF was due to their more rapid formation and smaller size compared with colloids from bulk CaO. We thus have developed a practical method for the synthesis of <b>polyglycerols</b> containing low amounts of Ca...|$|R

50|$|As {{a result}} of {{increasing}} biodiesel production, formation of the byproduct, crude glycerol, has also increased. While glycerol is commonly used in food, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and other industries, increased production of crude glycerol has become very expensive to purify and utilize in these industries. Because of this, researchers are interested in finding new economical ways to utilize low-grade glycerol products. Biotechnology is one such technique: using particular enzymes to break down crude glycerol to form products such as 1,3-propanediol, 1,2-propanediol, succinic acid, dihydroxyacetone (glycerone), hydrogen, <b>polyglycerols,</b> and polyesters. As a catalyst for the conversion of glycerol to glycerone, glycerol dehydrogenase is one such enzyme being investigated for this industrial purpose.|$|R

40|$|Flowing liquids in {{pipe systems}} cause {{pressure}} drops and energy losses {{and can be}} responsible for the initiation of flow induced localized corrosion (FILC). Initiation of FILC is affected by unfavourable geometric conditions in flow systems and local flow intensities above critical values. Many technical systems are concerned, e. g. in the field of oil and gas production, pipeline transportation, chemical plants or power stations. Critical flow intensities are generally expressed in terms of wall shear stresses as a value for the friction between turbulent flowing liquids and the wall. High molecular polymers and surface active compounds can influence a turbulent flow by reducing the wall shear stress to values which are uncritical for destruction of protective surface layers and thus can reduce the likelihood of FILC. In the framework of this thesis globular structures of hyperbranched polymers (e. g. <b>polyglycerols,</b> polyethylene imines) were investigated in order to find out if hyperbranched polymers are able to reduce wall shear stresses and if they have a higher resistance to degradation in high shear fields compared to surface active compounds like surfactants. It was proved by electrochemical and rheological investigations that globular structures like <b>polyglycerols</b> and polyethylene imines as well exert flow improving properties when the molecular size is high enough. Electrochemical and rheological measurements yield different results on the flow improving properties. This is explained by the effect of local flow intensities on the near-wall concentration of additives yielding an increase of the near-wall liquid viscosity and thus influences the interaction between the flowing liquid and the wall. This may already result in a decrease of the flow induced corrosion attack in flow systems. In summary, it was found out that hyperbranched polymers are a new class of polymers with a new supramolecular structure which exhibits as well as high molecular compounds and surface active compounds flow improving properties...|$|R

The copolymerization and subsequent deprotection chemistry allow the incorporation of an adjustable fraction of primary amine moieties (typically, 5 - 20 % monomer ratio) within the hyperbranched PG backbones, thus providing potentials for varying charge densities and functionality in PGs. The copolymerization kinetics of G and BBAG was also evaluated using a quantitative in situ 13 C NMR spectroscopic analysis, which revealed gradient copolymerization between the comonomers.
