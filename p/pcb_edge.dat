A mechanical interlock prevented any two of them being pressed at the same time. Unregulated 6.36 V DC is used to power the cassette motor.|$|E

40|$|Virtual {{prototyping}} {{is able to}} speed-up {{the development}} cycle of new products if based on exact models. In case of dynamic mechanical loads like JEDEC drop tests of BGA modules, broken copper traces at the PCB side {{are more and more}} often observed to be the ultimate failure effects. Straightforward FEM simulations showed unrealistic high stress and strain results not matching with the experimentally gained characteristic lifetimes of productive BGA components. A comprehensive physical investigation of the failure formation during JEDEC drop tests has revealed the complex nature of the dynamic failure formation. In addition to the ultimate fracture of the copper trace, a flaw of the IMC layer on top of the PCB pad has been identified by 3 -D X-ray tomography. Obviously, both failure mechanism are initiated during the consecutive drop events at different times propagating with different speeds. Both mechanisms are interacting with each other with no single mode alone dominating the failure evolution. Hence, FEM simulations have to account for both failure mechanisms in order to capture the ultimate copper trace stress realistically. Simulation results dramatically gained realism after including the IMC crack. The plastic copper trace strain is reduced by 80 % compared to an interconnection without IMC flaw. Now the plastic copper strain has reached realistic values indicating possible lifetimes as seen in the experiments. The overall routing effect of the PCB copper traces was investigated applying this new simulation methodology. The resulting strain map clearly indicates the routing direction, which is parallel to the short <b>PCB</b> <b>edges</b> and leaving the component as the most critical, which is in agreement with experimental observations. This very realistic 2 nd level interconnection model has been used to assess the lifetime of the investigated packages. A lifetime model was derived, which is able to predict the experimental number of cycles-to-failure of all - - three packages at different PCB positions with less than 25 % deviation. The results presented here set the ground for virtual prototyping, which also includes the BGA drop test endurance...|$|R
40|$|Signal Integrity (SI) {{consideration}} provides designers {{with the}} greatest possibility of removing radiance from high frequency signal components by carefully minimizing reflections and crosstalk. However, in PCBs, there is still evidence of radiation caused by power ground noise. Such radiation cannot be prevented with SI consideration. It is necessary to eliminate the power ground noise or restrict it at an acceptable level. The new development in power integrity (PI) provides the means to reaching this goal. This paper discusses the relationship between EMI and PI in high-speed PCB design. It proposes and investigates the design methods to suppress power ground noise by including RC termination at <b>PCB</b> <b>edge</b> and by localized decoupling. Evaluation boards are designed and manufactured to verify these methods. EMI in far field, power plane characteristics, and power ground noise are measured and correlated with simulation results. This paper concludes that a good power delivery strategy is effective in resolvin...|$|E
40|$|Subject of Research. We have {{developed}} and presented {{a method of}} design errors correction for printed circuit boards (PCB) in electronic design automation (EDA). Control of process parameters of PCB in EDA is carried out by means of Design Rule Check (DRC) program. The DRC program monitors compliance with the design rules (minimum width of the conductors and gaps, the parameters of pads and via-holes, the parameters of polygons, etc.) and also checks the route tracing, short circuits, the presence of objects outside <b>PCB</b> <b>edge</b> and other design errors. The result of the DRC program running is the generated error report. For quality production of circuit boards DRC-errors should be corrected, that is ensured by the creation of error-free DRC report. Method. A problem of correction repeatability of DRC-errors {{was identified as a}} result of trial operation of P-CAD, Altium Designer and KiCAD programs. For its solution the analysis of DRC-errors was carried out; the methods of their correction were studied. DRC-errors were proposed to be clustered. Groups of errors include the types of errors, which correction sequence has no impact on the correction time. The algorithm for correction of DRC-errors is proposed. Main Results. The best correction sequence of DRC-errors has been determined. The algorithm has been tested in the following EDA: P-CAD, Altium Designer and KiCAD. Testing has been carried out on two and four-layer test PCB (digital and analog). Comparison of DRC-errors correction time with the algorithm application to the same time without it has been done. It has been shown that time saved for the DRC-errors correction increases with the number of error types up to 3. 7 times. Practical Relevance. The proposed algorithm application will reduce PCB design time and improve the quality of the PCB design. We recommend using the developed algorithm when the number of error types is equal to four or more. The proposed algorithm can be used in different types of modern EDA...|$|E

40|$|The {{reliability}} of the {{printed circuit board assembly}} under dynamic environments, such as those found onboard airplanes, ships and land vehicles is receiving more attention. This research analyses the dynamic characteristics of the printed circuit board (<b>PCB)</b> supported by <b>edge</b> retainers and plug-in connectors. By modelling the wedge retainer and connector as providing simply supported boundary condition with appropriate rotational spring stiffnesses along their respective edges with the aid of finite element codes, accurate natural frequencies for the board against experimental natural frequencies are obtained. For a PCB supported by two opposite wedge retainers and a plug-in connector and with its remaining edge free of any restraint, it is found that these real supports behave somewhere between the simply supported and clamped boundary conditions and provide a percentage fixity of 39. 5 % more than the classical simply supported case. By using an eigensensitivity method, the rotational stiffnesses representing the boundary supports of the PCB can be updated effectively and is capable of representing the dynamics of the PCB accurately. The result shows that the percentage error in the fundamental frequency of the PCB finite element model is substantially reduced from 22. 3 % to 1. 3 %. The procedure demonstrated the effectiveness of using only the vibration test frequencies as reference data when the mode shapes of the original untuned model are almost identical to the referenced modes/experimental data. When using only modal frequencies in model improvement, the analysis is very much simplified. Furthermore, the time taken to obtain the experimental data will be substantially reduced as the experimental mode shapes are not required. In addition, this thesis advocates a relatively simple method in determining the support locations for maximising the fundamental frequency of vibrating structures. The technique is simple and does not require any optimisation or sequential search algorithm in the analysis. The key to the procedure is to position the necessary supports at positions so as to eliminate the lower modes from the original configuration. This is accomplished by introducing point supports along the nodal lines of the highest possible mode from the original configuration, so that all the other lower modes are eliminated by the introduction of the new or extra supports to the structure. It also proposes inspecting the average driving point residues along the nodal lines of vibrating plates to find the optimal locations of the supports. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate its validity. By applying to the PCB supported on its three sides by two wedge retainers and a connector, it is found that a single point constraint that would yield maximum fundamental frequency is located at the mid-point of the nodal line, namely, node 39. This point support has the effect of increasing the structure's fundamental frequency from 68. 4 Hz to 146. 9 Hz, or 115 % higher...|$|R
