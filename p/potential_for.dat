5|$|The high {{temperatures}} and dew points created moderate instability across the outbreak area.

5|$|After {{transitioning}} into a post-tropical cyclone, Katia {{moved quickly}} across the North Atlantic and toward Europe, prompting the Met Office to begin warnings citizens for potential impacts over subsequent days on September9. Three days later, the organization raised a yellow severe weather alert {{for all of}} Ireland {{and most of the}} United Kingdom, with a more severe amber alert hoisted across Northern Ireland, the northernmost United Kingdom, and southern Scotland; both alerts warned of the <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> gale-force winds. Concurrently, Met Éireann outlined an extreme weather warning across Ireland, alerting residents to the <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> 130km/h (80mph) winds, downed trees, damaged buildings, and flooding. Irish ferries cancelled a number of its sails between Dublin and Holyhead. The Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute warned of gale-force winds along the coastline of Sweden, although a brunt of the rainfall was expected in neighboring Norway.|$|E

5|$|Because {{game animals}} can be shot using lead bullets, the <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> lead {{ingestion}} from game meat consumption {{has been studied}} clinically and epidemiologically.

5|$|Computed {{tomography}} (CT) scans and Technetium-99m bone scans {{are also}} sometimes {{used to monitor}} the progress of treatment.

40|$|The paper {{presented}} {{an assessment of}} the resource potentials of composting organic waste mate-rials arising from the municipal solid waste stream from cities in Nigeria. Through a review of quantitative data, the composition of municipal solid waste arising within cities in Nigeria was examined in order to identify the <b>potentials</b> <b>for</b> composting organic materials from the waste stream composition. The data showed that the average majority of the waste stream was organic materials which implied high <b>potentials</b> <b>for</b> composting organic waste materials from Nigerian ci-ties. The review also identified further <b>potentials</b> <b>for</b> composting was associated with the large population and the majority of them engaged in agriculture, as a high <b>potential</b> market <b>for</b> com-post manure in Nigeria. There were more potentials derivable from the current policies of im-porting and supplying chemical fertilizer with huge subsidies for domestic agriculture in the country. The need to substitute these policies of chemical fertilizer with the use of compost ma-nure implied high <b>potentials</b> <b>for</b> composting in the country.
