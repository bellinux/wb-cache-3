50|$|Purchasing a short-barreled rifle is {{accomplished}} by finding the item desired, paying for it and then arranging for {{the transfer of the}} registered item. An individual will be required to file a BATFE Form 4, Application for Tax Paid Transfer and Registration of a Firearm, and paying a $200 tax. A short-barreled rifle must be transferred by a Class 3 or a Class 2 SOT dealer if the transfer will be across state lines. For transfers within a state the transfer may be accomplished by the individuals involved though the $200 transfer tax is still due. For transfers between dealers or manufacturers the Form 3- application for tax <b>exempt</b> <b>transfer</b> is filled out. For transfers to or from govt agencies (police departments, et al.) a Form 5 is used for tax <b>exempt</b> <b>transfer</b> to dealers or individuals(there is no tax due on transfers to or from govt agencies). When an individual wishes to build a short-barreled rifle, he or she must beforehand submit a completed BATFE Form 1, Application to Make and Register a Firearm, along with $200 for payment of the making tax.|$|R

40|$|In a very {{influential}} paper, Piketty (2011) finds that inherited wealth is of increasing importance in France. He describes a U-shaped {{pattern in the}} long-run development of inheritance flows. Two driving factors in this development are the relative ratio of wealth of the deceased to wealth of the living, and the wealth-income ratio. In periods with high economic growth, wealth {{of the past is}} weakened and inheritances as share of national income decreases. As soon as growth declines, however, the wealth inherited from one s parents and grandparents strengthens its significance and may end up dominating new wealth. This thesis concludes that Norway seems to be a European outsider also {{when it comes to the}} importance of inheritances. Whereas France and the UK have experienced sharply increasing inheritance flows over the past decades and are facing ratios of inheritances to national income between 8 and 15 percent, the inheritance flow in Norway from 1998 - 2012 is stable at a much lower level. Using the official inheritance tax register, the flow is around 1 percent. The official inheritance register is not reliable, however. Since only tax liable transfers are registered, a large amount of inheritances are excluded from the tax records. In addition, the thresholds for exemptions and tax rates have been altered over the period so that the inheritance data from year to year are not comparable. Using register data including also tax <b>exempt</b> <b>transfers,</b> the inheritance flow increases slightly. Adjusting the inheritance flow by an estimate of tax avoidance found by investigating the development of wealth and wealth assets during the last period of life yields an inheritance flow between 1, 5 and 2 percent. Piketty's way of estimating the inheritance-income ratio is used as an upper bound of tax avoidance. Combining a slightly decreasing mortality rate, an increasing wealth-income ratio and a stable wealth of the deceased to wealth of the living ratio results in an estimated Norwegian inheritance flow around 3, 5 percent. Even if there does not seem to be an increase in the Norwegian inheritance flow from 1998 to 2012, this does not mean that the long-run development is stable. Applying the r > g logic, an important reason for Norway s rather unique position in the European context is that the country has maintained income growth during a period where most other countries have suffered from a recession. If this growth comes to a halt or declines, one cannot exclude the possibility of increasing inheritance flows also here...|$|R
40|$|The federal transfer-tax system {{often makes}} state law a {{critical}} determinant. This {{is a necessary}} feature {{of a system that}} taxes the transfer of property, a concept that ordinarily derives its meaning from state law. As a matter of federal tax policy, however, {{it is important that the}} system neither overemphasize nor under emphasize state law. Part I undertakes a consideration of the role of state law in the transfer-tax system and the negative consequences that occur where the tax law fails to strike the proper balance. Part II then focuses on the marital deduction, applying the framework developed in Part I. The marital deduction, which <b>exempts</b> <b>transfers</b> between spouses from tax, is central to the system. From its inception, the marital deduction has given state law a pivotal role. In order to qualify for the deduction, the decedent spouse 2 ̆ 7 s property must pass to the surviving spouse under state law: the so-called 2 ̆ 2 passing 2 ̆ 2 requirement. In 1948, when the martial deduction was originally created, it had a limited function: to maintain parity between couples residing in common-law and community-property states. And in the context of this limited function, the passing requirement 2 ̆ 7 s state law component made sense. However, when the marital deduction was reformulated in 1981, it assumed a broader function. In the context of that broader function, it will be argued, it no longer makes sense to make the marital deduction turn upon whether the property passes under state law. In other words, in light of the 1981 amendment, the passing requirement inappropriately emphasizes state law. Part I considers how the passing requirement might be modified to cure its overemphasis on state law. Several alternatives are examined, drawing upon a theme implicit in the 1981 reformulation. Two of the more modest alternatives would simply overrule the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s decision in Commissioner v. Estate of Bosch, which adopted a construction of the statute that in effect exacerbates its overemphasis on state law. The less modest alternatives would make state law completely irrelevant. Instead, the availability of the deduction would be made to depend upon whether the decedent spouse 2 ̆ 7 s property would eventually be subject to tax in the surviving spouse 2 ̆ 7 s estate (if not consumed). In short, the focus would no longer be on the method by which the surviving spouse acquired the decedent spouse 2 ̆ 7 s property, but rather on whether the property would trigger a tax at the death of the surviving spouse...|$|R
50|$|The {{law does}} not specify {{whether or not the}} {{transfer}} of ownership would simply apply to mergers and restructurings in the future, or if it applies to all current companies. The minister for indigenization and empowerment would have the power to allow some companies to be <b>exempt</b> of the <b>transfer</b> law for some time. This is not a new idea because there have been proposals for similar transfer actions, but have all come up fruitless. The Zimbabwean government has promised the foreign owned companies that are soon to be taken over that authorities would help the businesses set timetables for the transfer of business shares to local black Zimbabweans. Even before the bill became law, it has had repercussions on investors and foreign companies such as Orascom Telecom, a mobile phone company.|$|R
40|$|In June of 2008, in Florida Department of Revenue v. Piccadilly Cafeterias, Inc., the Supreme Court {{settled a}} circuit split {{and issued a}} bright line rule stating that asset {{transfers}} made prior to the confirmation of a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization no longer benefit from certain tax exemptions. As a result, the cost of selling assets in a bankruptcy case outside of a plan will increase. The provision at issue in the case, which <b>exempts</b> asset <b>transfers</b> and sales from certain state taxes, contains language ambiguous enough that four federal circuit courts have contemplated which types of asset sales qualify for the tax benefit. Although the Supreme Court set a bright line rule that brings clarity and simplicity to the provision, the Court ignored the intent behind the provision, and the Court’s decision may ultimately result in the exemption’s obsolescence. As a result, Congress should adopt a revised provision that nullifies the Supreme Court’s Piccadilly decision {{in order to stay}} true to the purpose behind the Code. This Comment analyzes the Piccadilly opinion and its practical effects. Part II discusses the history and purpose of the stamp tax exemption within the Bankruptcy Code. Part III discusses the circuit split resolved by Piccadilly and addresses the problems each side presents. Part IV first presents the background and procedural history of Piccadilly and then summarizes the Supreme Court’s creation of the bright line rule and decision to limit the tax exemption to post confirmation transfers. Part V critiques the Court’s decision and suggests that Congress reject the Supreme Court’s bright line rule and revise the statute to remove the temporal limitation and add a notice provision. In addition, Part V addresses the suggested revision’s application and its potential pitfalls. Finally, Part VI concludes and briefly comments on the future impacts of the decision...|$|R

Due to the EU Court of Justice’s ruling in X BV and HFD:s ruling in HFD 2014 ref. 1 {{it is now clear}} that costs related to a share <b>transfer</b> <b>exempted</b> from VAT also can constitute overheads, with the result that the input VAT is deductible to the extent the acquisitions have a direct and immediate link with the whole economic activity or a clearly defined part of the economic activities. The rulings in X BV and HFD 2014 ref. 1 mean that {{it is now clear that}} a share transfer can be a part of a transfer of a totality of assets. For acquisitions made in connection with such a transfer, the input VAT is entirely deductible. The thesis shows that due to the fact that the ruling in HFD 2014 ref. 1 did not include a determination of if the costs in question could constitute overheads, the Swedish courts of lower instances as well as Skatteverket have not received any guidance on how the deter- mination is to be made. The author is of the opinion that the courts of lower instances and Skatteverket in their determination of whether costs related to acquisitions can constitute overheads do not consider the EU-law principles declared by the EU Court of Justice. Further, the author is of the opinion that the legal situation due to X BV and HFD 2014 ref. 1 mean that the right to deduct input VAT related to acquisitions made in connection with share transfers that Swedish taxable persons are supposed to obtain in accordance with EU-law seem to differ from the rights actually obtained in practice. ...|$|R
