We use recent developments in financial statement analysis research to construct a <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> duration for <b>equity</b> securities. We find that the standard empirical predictions and results for fixed income securities extend to equity securities. We show that stock price volatility and stock beta are both positively correlated with equity duration. Moreover, estimates of common shocks to expected equity returns extracted using our <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>equity</b> duration capture a strong common factor in stock returns. Additional analysis shows that the book-to-market ratio provides a crude <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>equity</b> duration and that our more refined <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>equity</b> duration subsumes the Fama and French (1993) book-to-market factor in stock returns. Our research shows how structured financial statement analysis {{can be used to}} construct superior <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> <b>equity</b> security risk...|$|R

40|$|<b>Measuring</b> the <b>equity</b> <b>of</b> {{opportunity}} {{in a given}} society is an essential ingredient {{in the formulation of}} policies and programs that promote inclusive growth. In this paper, <b>equity</b> <b>of</b> opportunity is defined and measured through the theoretical framework of the social opportunity function, a concept similar to the social welfare function. The functional and graphical distribution of opportunity is discussed through the generalized Lorenz curve and the Bonferroni curve, while complete ranking of distributions is achieved through their related numerical indices: the concentration index and the Bonferroni index of opportunity, respectively. The concepts of relative and absolute <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> <b>equity</b> <b>of</b> opportunity are then introduced and a social {{opportunity in}}dex that considers both the amount and distribution of opportunity is developed.
