40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{investigate}} the transdermal permeation characteristics of the highly potent dopamine receptor agonist <b>proterguride,</b> an 8 &# 945;-aminoergoline, using transdermal drug delivery systems (TDDS). In addition, passive strategies to promote the transdermal flux of the compound across hairless mouse skin serving as a model membrane were tested. Beside patch-specific characteristics, the action of the active pharmaceutical ingredient at different non-dopaminergic monoamine receptors was of exceptional interest. First, the drug-in-adhesive matrix patch design was used to identify suitable pressure-sensitive adhesives (PSA) for a TDDS containing <b>proterguride</b> by evaluating patches in respect to transdermal drug flux, crystallization during storage, and skin adhesion and skin irritation in vivo of corresponding placebo patches. As a result the Gelva ® 7883 polymer appeared to be most suitable as a basis for further development. A drug load of 4 % by weight in Gelva ® matrices resulted in stable patches yielding maximum transdermal steady state flux values of the drug. A further attempt to promote the transdermal drug flux consisted of the incorporation of chemical permeation enhancers (CPE). Of the group of the N-alkylpyrrolidones, N-dodecylpyrrolidone was most effective to raise steady state flux of <b>proterguride.</b> Lauric acid, Tween ® 20, and Azone ® failed to deliver high quantities of <b>proterguride</b> across hairless mouse skin when used at the 5 % level. In the case of Azone ®, significantly increased steady state flux values were only achieved at concentrations above 10 %. By contrast, Span ® 20 and dodecanol were nearly as effective as N-dodecylpyrrolidone. The reservoir technology indicated that microporous Solupor ® 10 P 05 A-membrane (DSM) combined with a silicone adhesive layer (Bio-PSA ® 7 - 4202) was more permeable to <b>proterguride</b> dissolved in 2 -propanol containing an additional 2 % Klucel ® LF than ethylene vinylacetate membranes (CoTran ® 9705 / 9715), where permeability is governed by the amount of vinylacetate. Increasing the concentration of <b>proterguride</b> to 10 % in these patches resulted in increased steady state flux values, whereas the addition of 10 % of N-dodecylpyrrolidone to this formulation additionally raised transdermal permeation of the drug. The second part of this thesis deals with the pharmacological action of <b>proterguride</b> at different non-dopaminergic monoamine receptors. The data show that <b>proterguride</b> can be classified as an antagonist at histamine H 1 receptors as well as at &# 945; 1 A/ 1 B/ 1 D -adrenoceptors. However, there appeared to be no subtype selectivity. Moreover, <b>proterguride</b> behaved as a partial agonist at serotoninergic 5 -HT 2 A and 5 -HT 2 B receptors. Based on this data, therapeutic doses might be delivered to humans in vivo by a 20 cm² sized drug-in-adhesive matrix patch or, alternatively, by an extremely small 3 cm² (active area) sized reservoir patch, even when formulated without CPEs. This takes into account the assumption that human skin in vivo is 10 times less permeable than hairless mouse skin in vitro. The pharmaceutical and pharmacological results highlight the suitability of <b>proterguride</b> for the development of an attractively-sized TDDS in order to achieve constant plasma concentrations...|$|E
