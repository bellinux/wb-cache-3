40|$|This paper re-examines the {{theoretical}} aid-growth nexus by expounding {{on the issues}} relating to policies designed for aid delivery {{and the lack of}} aid recipient's state institutional capability to enforce <b>policy</b> <b>conditionality.</b> Two propositions have been demonstrated to explain why <b>policy</b> <b>conditionality</b> attached to aid might not always promote sustainable economic growth in Least Developed Countries. First, the model has simulated that a stable aid flow contributes to economic growth even when aid is fungible. Second, the model has also simulated that unstable aid inflow impairs the favourable effect of stable aid inflow. It is suggested that the contribution of aid to economic growth depends not only on the ability of aid to increase investment in the recipient country but also the quality of <b>policy</b> <b>conditionality</b> and the state and institutional capability of the recipient country to implement <b>policy</b> <b>conditionality.</b> Foreign Aid, Economic Growth, Policies, State Institutions, Food Security and Poverty, D 72, D 9, F 35, H 30,...|$|E

40|$|Despite {{receiving}} {{large quantities}} of aid, many developing countries, especially the Least Developed Countries, have remained stagnant and became more aid-dependent. This grim reality provokes vigorous debate {{on the effectiveness of}} aid. This study re-examines the effectiveness of aid, focusing on the ongoing debate on the interactive effect of aid and <b>policy</b> <b>conditionality</b> on sustainable economic growth. A theoretical model of the aid-growth nexus was developed to explain why <b>policy</b> <b>conditionality</b> attached to aid may not always promote sustainable economic growth. Noticeable methodological weaknesses in the aid fungibility and aid-growth models have led to the construction of two macroeconometric models to tackle and reduce these weaknesses. The Lao People's Democratic Republic's economy for the 1978 - 2001 period has been used for a case study. It is argued that the quality of <b>policy</b> <b>conditionality</b> and the recipient country's ability to complete specified policy conditions are the main factors determining the effectiveness of aid. Completing the policy prescriptions contributes to a stable aid inflow. The aid-growth nexus model developed in this study shows that stable and moderate aid inflow boosts economic growth even when aid is fungible. However, failure to complete the <b>policy</b> <b>conditionality</b> owing to inadequate policy design and problems of policy mismanagement caused by lack of state and institutional capability in the recipient country triggers an unstable aid inflow. The model shows that unstable aid flows reduce capital accumulation and economic growth in the recipient country. These empirical findings reveal that <b>policy</b> <b>conditionality</b> propagated through the "adjustment programmes" has mitigated the side effects of aid fungibility and "Dutch disease" {{in the case of the}} Lao PDR. Preliminary success in implementing the policy conditions in the pre- 1997 period led to a stable aid inflow and contributed to higher economic growth. This favourable circumstance, however, was impaired by unstable aid flow in the post- 1997 period. The lack of state and institutional capacity in the Lao PDR and the inadequate policy design to deal with external shocks triggered the instability of aid inflow, which in turn exacerbated the negative effects of the Asian financial crisis on the Lao PDR's economy...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine how Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) can {{contribute}} to decision-making processes of Official Development Assistance (ODA) loans and grants. The point of departure for the discussion is the phenomenon that RIA, within a context of ODA, is applied by International Finance Institutions mainly in the context of Development Policy Loans, to introduce or strengthen country systems for Regulatory Impact Assessment. However, ODA grants, and loans, particularly when specific policy or regulatory conditions are attached to them, significantly impact economic and social conditions within the beneficiary country. This article examines what role RIA can play in facilitating a coherent decision-making process affecting the ODA allocation within a context of conditionalities requiring the introduction of new, or changes to existing, policies and regulations. The discussion considers the nexus between development aid effectiveness, conditionality and ownership, and RIA. The article argues a justification for applying RIA to ODA loans and grants which carry regulatory and <b>policy</b> <b>conditionalities...</b>|$|R
40|$|This {{case study}} of the {{implications}} of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) loan on the Indian state of Kerala explores how neoliberal reforms have impacted on the state's much-acclaimed social model of development. Notwithstanding resistance, the state moves towards market-driven reforms wherein external funds are privileged over internal resources, the reasons for which are probed within the context of social structures of accumulation and emergent power relations. It is argued that with the diversion of resources towards debt servicing and compliance with <b>policy</b> <b>conditionalities,</b> the collaboration with the ADB is likely to undermine social democracy. What ensues is a double collapse: a collapse of the Kerala Model of social development and the demise of an iconized Left.

40|$|<b>Policy</b> <b>conditionality</b> {{has been}} a {{frequently}} used tool {{in the context of}} the Euro zone crisis management. By linking the disbursement of loan instalments to specific policy requirements the macro-economic adjustment programmes used conditionality as leverage to promote structural reforms. How does conditionality induce policy change? This central question is examined by considering conditionality as a ‘mega’ policy instrument that seeks to guide the domestic policy system and define its reform trajectory. <b>Policy</b> <b>conditionality</b> thus determines the areas of reform and prescribes their direction while also defining the means and timeframe within which they have to be implemented. Conditionality impacts on domestic governance and transforms the policy making system into a compliance and implementation mechanism. The paper argues that the reform potential of conditionality relies on its interaction with the domestic political system and policy process. A public policy lens can help to better understand the dynamics inherent in this process as well as highlight the strengths and limitations of conditionality. Following the conventional stages of public policy, the contribution focuses on the political challenges involved and sketches out a prospective empirical research agenda...|$|E

40|$|The International Monetary Fund (IMF), {{which has}} been criticised for the rigid {{economic}} <b>policy</b> <b>conditionalities</b> attached to its lending programmes, says it now provides borrower states greater flexibility to adopt expansionary policies. Standing in the Way of Development? assesses this claim {{in the context of}} the IMF’s central role in dealing with the effects of the global financial crisis in low-income countries (LICs). This paper evaluates the general macroeconomic policy scheme promoted by the Fund and closely examines the nature of its engagement during the crisis in a representative sample of 13 LICs. The authors find that, despite some relaxation of policy restraints, the IMF essentially remains wedded to its longstanding prioritisation of price stability and low fiscal deficits over other macroeconomic goals. Such a policy stance, it is argued, could undermine not only LICs’ prospects for a quick recovery from the crisis but also their longer-term development outlook. In light of this, this paper outlines the broad contours of an alternative macroeconomic policy framework geared towards supporting long-run equitable growth and poverty reduction...|$|R

40|$|International {{financial}} assistance (loans and grants) can potentially raise recipients'' welfare in two ways, by affecting a direct resource transfer and by facilitating efficiency-enhancing reforms. In practice, barriers to reform limit {{the potential of}} assistance to deliver these two dividends. In this paper, we analyze assistance programs designed to ensure that recipient governments voluntarily adopt reforms and overcome barriers associated with: (i) the reaction of special interests to the prospect of reform; (ii) the possibility of default and political instability in the recipient country; and (iii) adverse selection and moral hazard. Reform barriers raise the cost of incentive-compatible assistance and may result either in no assistance being forthcoming or assistance that ensures repayment but not the implementation of reforms. Critical to the choice of assistance programs {{is the size of}} the rent accruing to special interests in the absence of reform and the limited liability rents needed to ensure that repayment terms do not threaten the country''s political stability.

It argues that, although one may contend that the EU agenda for Cape Verde does not escape the logic of EU’s typical development agenda for West Africa, the official rhetoric is that the most adequate pattern for the EU-Cape Verde relations is that of political dialogue and policy convergence rather than that of <b>conditionality</b> <b>policy.</b> This is so, the EU explains, because they share common challenges and face common threats.

Conditionality is shown to survive in an environment with weak donor commitment power, and it can eliminate the inefficiency associated with the no-conditionality outcome. However, even when conditionality is successfully imposed by donors, there may be an inverse relationship between aid and reform across different aid recipients.
