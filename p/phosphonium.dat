After a two-step conversion to the corresponding <b>phosphonium</b> salt, wittig union of <b>phosphonium</b> salt with aldehyde, fragment C, proceeded in 76% yield and good selectivity. The last {{feature of this}} synthesis was the titanium-mediated installation of the diene. The smith synthesis of (-)-discodermolide has an overall yield of 2.0% with a longest linear sequence of 29 steps and 42 total steps.|$|E

25|$|The Wittig {{reaction}} or Wittig olefination is {{a chemical}} reaction of an aldehyde or ketone with a triphenyl <b>phosphonium</b> ylide (often called a Wittig reagent) {{to give an}} alkene and triphenylphosphine oxide.|$|E
25|$|Another {{system for}} metal-free {{hydrogenation}} {{is based on}} the phosphine-borane, compound 1, which has been called a frustrated Lewis pair. It reversibly accepts dihydrogen at relatively low temperatures to form the <b>phosphonium</b> borate 2 which can reduce simple hindered imines.|$|E
25|$|Mechanisms differ for {{aliphatic}} and aromatic aldehydes and for aromatic and aliphatic <b>phosphonium</b> ylides. Evidence {{suggests that}} the Wittig reaction of unbranched aldehydes under lithium-salt-free conditions do not equilibrate and are therefore under kinetic reaction control. Vedejs has put forth a theory to explain the stereoselectivity of stabilized and unstabilized Wittig reactions.|$|E
25|$|From the <b>phosphonium</b> salts, these reagent {{are formed}} more readily, {{requiring}} only NaOH, {{and they are}} usually more air-stable. These are less reactive than simple ylides, and so they usually fail to react with ketones, necessitating {{the use of the}} Horner–Wadsworth–Emmons reaction as an alternative. They usually give rise to an E-alkene product when they react, rather than the more usual Z-alkene.|$|E
25|$|The aqueous {{solubility}} of PH3 is slight; 0.22 mL of gas dissolve in 1 mL of water. Phosphine dissolves {{more readily}} in non-polar solvents than in water {{because of the}} non-polar P-H bonds. It is technically amphoteric in water, but acid and base activity is poor. Proton exchange proceeds via a <b>phosphonium</b> (PH4+) ion in acidic solutions and via PH2− at high pH, with equilibrium constants Kb = 4 × 10−28 and Kz = 41.6 × 10−29.|$|E
25|$|Alternatively the acid-catalyzed disproportioning {{of white}} {{phosphorus}} yields phosphoric acid and phosphine. Both routes have industrial significance; the acid route is preferred method if further {{reaction of the}} phosphine to substituted phosphines is needed. The acid route requires purification and pressurizing. It can also be made (as described above) by the hydrolysis of a metal phosphide, such as aluminium phosphide or calcium phosphide. Pure samples of phosphine, free from P2H4, may be prepared using the action of potassium hydroxide on <b>phosphonium</b> iodide (PH4I).|$|E
500|$|Other [...] "pseudo-alkali metals" [...] {{include the}} alkylammonium cations, {{in which some}} of the {{hydrogen}} atoms in the ammonium cation are replaced by alkyl or aryl groups.

Furthermore, the nitrogen atom may be replaced by a phosphorus, arsenic, or antimony atom (the heavier nonmetallic pnictogens), creating a <b>phosphonium</b> (...) or arsonium (...) cation that can itself be substituted similarly; while stibonium (...) itself is not known, some of its organic derivatives are characterised.|$|E

[...] A Wittig reaction of the <b>phosphonium</b> salt of triphenylphosphonium bromide with methyl 9-oxononanoate, followed by saponification, completed the synthesis.|$|E
2500|$|Two years later, Smith and his {{co-workers}} publish a third-generation synthesis in which the bulky TBS ether protecting group at C(11) of the precursor iodide {{was replaced by a}} less sterically encumbering group, MOM. [...] This modification favors the formation of the desired <b>phosphonium</b> salt.

2500|$|Deprotonation of DMSO {{requires}} {{strong bases}} like lithium diisopropylamide and sodium hydride. [...] Stabilization of the resultant carbanion {{is provided by}} the S(O)R group. [...] The sodium derivative of DMSO formed in this way is referred to as [...] "dimsyl sodium". [...] It is a base, e.g., for the deprotonation of ketones to form sodium enolates, <b>phosphonium</b> salts to form Wittig reagents, and formamidinium salts to form diaminocarbenes.

2500|$|The {{key feature}} of the {{fourth-generation}} approach was the utilization of bidirectional fragment, vinyl iodide/phosphonium salt. <b>phosphonium</b> salt could be readily obtained as the trisubstituted vinyl iodide is less reactive than alkyl iodide. A Wittig reaction with followed by Suzuki coupling with alkyl iodide efficiently furnished the backbone of (+)-discodermolide. The Smith fourth-generation synthesis of (+)-discodermolide has an overall yield of 9.0% with a longest linear sequence of 17 steps and 36 total steps.|$|E
2500|$|Organophosphines are {{compounds}} {{with the}} formula PRnH3−n. [...] These compounds are often classified {{according to the}} value of n: primary phosphines (n = 1), secondary phosphines (n = 2), tertiary phosphines (n = 3). All adopt pyramidal structures. [...] Their reactivity is also similar - they can be oxidized to the phosphorus(V) level, they can be protonated and alkylated at phosphorus to give <b>phosphonium</b> salts, and, for primary and secondary derivatives, they can be deprotonated by strong bases to give organophosphide derivatives.|$|E

Insight into Kinetic vs. Thermodynamic Control of Stereochemistry", J. Am. Chem. Soc., 107, 1068–1070 (1985) Maryanoff and Reitz identified the issue about equilibration of Wittig intermediates and termed the process [...] "stereochemical drift". For many years, the stereochemistry of the Wittig reaction, in terms of carbon-carbon bond formation, had been assumed to correspond directly with the Z/E stereochemistry of the alkene products. However, certain reactants do not follow this simple pattern. Lithium salts can also exert a profound effect on the stereochemical outcome.|$|E

A {{wide range of}} anions are employed, ranging from simple halides, which generally suffer high melting points, to inorganic anions such as tetrafluoroborate and hexafluorophosphate, and to large organic anions like bistriflimide, triflate or tosylate. There are also many potential uses of ionic liquids with simple non-halogenated organic anions such as formate, alkylsulfate, alkylphosphate or glycolate. The melting point of 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate is about [...] {{and it is a}} colorless liquid with high viscosity at room temperature. If a highly asymmetric cation is combined with a highly asymmetric anion, formed ionic liquid may not freeze down to very low temperatures (down to −150°C) and the glass transition temperature was detected below −100°C in the case of ionic liquids with N-methyl-N-alkylpyrrolidinium cations and fluorosulfonyl-trifluoromethanesulfonylimide (FTFSI). Water is a common impurity in ionic liquids as it can be absorbed from the atmosphere and influences the transport properties of RTILs, even at relatively low concentrations.|$|E
2500|$|Ferrocene, a {{precursor}} to iron nanoparticles, {{can be used as}} a catalyst for the production of carbon nanotubes. The vinylferrocene from ferrocene can be made by a Wittig reaction of the aldehyde, a <b>phosphonium</b> salt and sodium hydroxide. The vinyl ferrocene can be converted into a polymer (polyvinylferrocene, PVFc), a ferrocenyl version of polystyrene (the phenyl groups are replaced with ferrocenyl groups). Another polyferrocene which can be formed is poly(2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl ferrocenecarboxylate), PFcMA. [...] In addition to using organic polymer backbones, these pendant ferrocene units have been attached to inorganic backbones such as polysiloxanes, polyphosphazenes, and polyphosphinoboranes, (PH(R)BH2)n, and the resulting materials exhibit unusual physical and electronic properties relating to the ferrocene / ferrocinium redox couple. [...] Both PVFc and PFcMA have been tethered onto silica wafers and the wettability measured when the polymer chains are uncharged and when the ferrocene moieties are oxidised to produce positively charged groups. [...] The contact angle with water on the PFcMA-coated wafers was 70° smaller following oxidation, while in the case of PVFc the decrease was 30°, and the switching of wettability is reversible.
