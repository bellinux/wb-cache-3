Discrepant questioning is a technique in which teachers question students {{in a way that}} requires them to examine their ideas or models, without giving information prematurely to the student or passing judgement on the student's model. This strategy <b>prompts</b> <b>students</b> <b>to</b> see the contradictions in their own model. This study focuses on the analysis of small group tutoring sessions on human respiration. Four 2 -hour classes were held with a group of 4 eighth-grade students. The group included two boys and two girls and was ethnically diverse.

The instruction was organized around five individual target models related to the microscopic structure of the cell; internal structure of the cell; and the digestive, circulatory, and respiratory systems. Evidence suggests that students had a marked increase in comprehension of human respiration.

30|$|In Expedition Atlantis, we {{targeted}} {{this single}} key mathematical concept for intense intervention and used principles of MEAs to guide our material design (see Table  1). Prior efforts {{with this approach}} had already revealed design issues that we attempted to avoid or mitigate. For example, one such unit, robot synchronized dancing (RSD), challenged <b>students</b> <b>to</b> program two robots with different-sized wheels and wheel bases {{in order to allow}} them to move (dance) in synchrony. A unique sequence of dance movements programmed into one robot had to be adapted to synchronize a second (differently sized) robot. This overall task was divided into subtasks to scaffold the demands of the challenge (Apedoe et al. 2008): (1) synchronizing the distance traveled, (2) synchronizing robots’ speeds, and (3) synchronizing their turns. As students worked, they were asked to create and revise a general technique that would allow for the synchronization of more robots of different sizes (i.e., a generalizable model of the solution). Additionally, students solved math-focused abstraction bridges (Brown and Clement 1989) that <b>prompted</b> <b>students</b> <b>to</b> solve robot math word problems. These problems were initially analogous to the calculations of distance and speed required for the challenge, but progressed toward everyday proportional reasoning scenarios <b>to</b> <b>prompt</b> <b>students</b> <b>to</b> generalize the proportional reasoning skills that they had developed within the robot challenge to more traditional situations, thereby developing a more general understanding.|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} {{we aim to}} gain a better {{understanding}} of the nature of plagiarism in Higher Education. We analyse a set of different activities in an online university-level course, aiming to understand which tasks lead more naturally to plagiarism. This analysis concludes that the activities that have a lower rate of plagiarism are activities that encourage involvement, originality and creativity. Subsequently, we reformulate the task that presented the highest rate of plagiarism, taking into account the conclusions of the previous analysis and trying to maintain their relative effort and educational impact. We then compare the newly designed activities with their original counterparts to measure whether there is a significant reduction in plagiarism. The results are clear and show a significant drop in the percentages of plagiarism. In addition, we performed an additional validation to ensure that both groups were, in fact comparable. We found that both groups displayed similar plagiarism attitudes in other exercises that were not reformulated. This study shows that it is possible to reduce the incidence of plagiarism by designing activities in such a way that <b>prompts</b> <b>students</b> <b>to</b> propose their own ideas using information available on the Internet as a vehicle for their solutions rather than as solutions in themselves...|$|E
40|$|Advances in {{technology}} have transformed {{both students and}} their learning environments; the technological environment in which 21 st-century learners have grown up means that their aptitudes, expectations, and learning styles {{are very different from}} those of their teachers (Oblinger and Oblinger 2005). These students expect that their educators will shift from traditional lecture-based teaching to a pedagogy that creates learning environments where students interact with the material, the instructor, and their peers (Dede 2005; Oblinger and Oblinger 2005). At the same time, instructors must integrate a variety of pedagogical approaches and strategies to create rich learning environments that can address cultural, demographic, and skill-based differences among students (Dunn and Griggs 2000) as well as individual learning styles and multiple intelligences (Gardner 1993; Gardner 1999; Gardner 2004).

Furthermore, they posit that the scientific creative process is less taxing if the researcher approaches using searching strategies in the following domains: personal interests, environmental, work and life, experiences and the use of electronic sources. We employed the searching strategies highlighted in the literature to build a digitized scientific architectural platform called MeProB. MeProB in an interactive software that through a series of probes, in successive approximations, enables doctoral students to identify a dissertation topic and a research problem. The architectural logic of MeProB <b>prompts</b> <b>students</b> <b>to</b> think about their professional experiences and/or interests and to identify areas of concern that potentially could be research topics. Once the student identifies the most pressing concerns they are prompted to find evidence and/or literature that will document the problem and to use the compiled evidence to justify the merits of a study.
