40|$|Phagocytosis is an {{important}} process {{of the immune system}} by which pathogens are internalized and eliminated by phagocytic cells. Upon internalization, the phagosome matures and acidifies while being transported in a centripetal fashion. In this chapter, we describe protocols for simultaneous imaging of phagosomal acidification as well as their spatial manipulation by magnetic tweezers. First, we describe the protocols for functionalization of magnetic microbeads with pH-sensitive dyes and <b>pH</b> <b>calibration</b> of these particles. We also describe the preparation of magnetic tweezers and the calibration of forces that can be generated by these tweezers. We provide details of the design of the custom electrical and optical setup used for simultaneous imaging of phagosomal pH and phagosome's location.

40|$|Both, {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} protein adsorption processes and mathematical models describing such processes indicate, that the pH in the absorbent particle {{might be the}} key factor for an improved understanding of these chromatographic processes. Thus, a technique aiming at the spatially resolved pH measurement in macroscopic large absorbent particles is presented. The first application of this method, being based on confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), revealed an apparent dependence of the <b>pH</b> <b>calibration</b> curve on the scanning depth. By a model-based approach, factors distorting the measurement signal are identified: The wavelength-dependent light scattering and the re-absorption of emitted light. The resulting consequences for further development and application of CLSM based techniques to measure pH in macroscopic large absorbent particles are illustrated and discussed. ...|$|E

40|$|The B/Ca {{ratio of}} planktic foraminiferal calcite, {{a proxy for}} the surface ocean {{carbonate}} system, displays large negative excursions during the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM, 55. 9 Ma), consistent with rapid ocean acidification at that time. However, the B/Ca excursion measured at the PETM exceeds a magnitude that modern <b>pH</b> <b>calibrations</b> can explain. Numerous other controls on the proxy have been suggested, including foraminiferal growth rate and the total concentration of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC). Here we present new calibrations for B/Ca versus the combined effects of pH and DIC in the symbiont-bearing planktic foraminifer Orbulina universa, grown in culture solutions with simulated Paleocene seawater elemental composition (high [Ca], low [Mg], and low total boron concentration ([B]_T). We also investigate the isolated effects of low seawater [B]_T, high [Ca], reduced symbiont photosynthetic activity, and average shell growth rate on O. universa B/Ca {{in order to further}} understand the proxy systematics and to determine other possible influences on the PETM records. We find that average shell growth rate does not appear to determine B/Ca in high calcite saturation experiments. In addition, our “Paleocene” calibration shows higher sensitivity than the modern calibration at low [B(OH) _ 4 −]/DIC. Given a large DIC pulse at the PETM, this amplification of the B/Ca response can more fully explain the PETM B/Ca excursion. However, further calibrations with other foraminifer species are needed to determine the range of foraminifer species-specific proxy sensitivities under these conditions for quantitative reconstruction of large carbon cycle perturbations...|$|R

40|$|Manufacture and {{utilization}} of antimony pH electrodes. A new technique for manufacturing single-barreled and double-barreled antimony pH microelectrodes is described. The results of {{investigations into the}} accuracy of antimony as a pH sensor disclosed that the pH-voltage response is: 1) within the physiologic range, principally {{the result of the}} hydrogen ion activity of the solution in which the voltage is being developed, 2) in part, qualitatively anion-dependent, 3) modified by the presence of significant amounts of at least carbon dioxide, oxygen, and nitrogen gases, and 4) markedly offset by fluctuations in temperature. Our results further indicate that the accuracy of antimony as a pH sensor is determined by the quality of the calibration procedure. We conclude that if the antimony electrode is to accurately determine the pH of a biological fluid, the <b>pH</b> <b>calibration</b> solutions must closely resemble the unknown biological fluid with respect to temperature, PO 2, PN 2, and types of buffering anions.

40|$|Organelle {{acidification}} is {{an essential}} element of the endosomal-lysosomal pathway, but our understanding of the mechanisms underlying progression through this pathway has been hindered by the absence of adequate methods for quantifying intraorganelle pH. To address this problem in neurons, we developed a direct quantitative method for accurately determining the pH of endocytic organelles in live cells. In this report, we demonstrate that the ratiometric fluorescent pH indicator 8 -hydroxypyrene- 1, 3, 6 -trisulfonic acid (HPTS) is the most advantageous available probe for such pH measurements. To measure intraorganelle pH, cells were labeled by endocytic uptake of HPTS, the ratio of fluorescence emission intensities at excitation wavelengths of 450 nm and 405 nm (F 450 / 405) was calculated for each organelle, and ratios were converted to pH values by using standard curves for F 450 / 405 vs. <b>pH.</b> Proper <b>calibration</b> is critical for accurate measurement of pH values: standard curves generated in vitro yielded artifactually low organelle <b>pH</b> values. <b>Calibration</b> was unaffected by the use of culture medium buffered with various buffers or different cell types. By using this technique, we show that both acidic and neutral endocytically derived organelles exist in the axons of sympathetic neurons in different steady-state proportions than in the cell body. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these axonal organelles have a bimodal pH distribution, indicating a rapid acidification step in their maturation that reduces the average pH of a fraction of the organelles by 2 pH units while leaving few organelles of intermediate pH at steady state. Finally, we demonstrate a spatial gradient or organelle pH along axons, with the relative frequency of acidic organelles increasing with proximity to the cell body...|$|R

40|$|International audienceGlycerol dialkyl {{glycerol}} tetraethers (GDGTs) are membrane-spanning lipids from Bacteria and Archaea {{that are}} ubiquitous {{in a range}} of natural archives and especially abundant in peat. Previous work demonstrated that the distribution of bacterial branched GDGTs (brGDGTs) in mineral soils is correlated to environmental factors such as mean annual air temperature (MAAT) and soil pH. However, the influence of these parameters on brGDGT distributions in peat is largely unknown. Here we investigate the distribution of brGDGTs in 470 samples from 96 peatlands around the world with a broad mean annual air temperature (− 8 to 27 °C) and pH (3 – 8) range and present the first peat-specific brGDGT-based temperature and <b>pH</b> <b>calibrations.</b> Our results demonstrate that the degree of cyclisation of brGDGTs in peat is positively correlated with pH, pH = 2. 49 x CBTpeat + 8. 07 (n = 51, R 2 = 0. 58, RMSE = 0. 8) and the degree of methylation of brGDGTs is positively correlated with MAAT, MAATpeat (°C) = 52. 18 x MBT 5 me’ – 23. 05 (n = 96, R 2 = 0. 76, RMSE = 4. 7 °C). These peat-specific calibrations are distinct from the available mineral soil calibrations. In light of the error in the temperature calibration (∼ 4. 7 °C), we urge caution in any application to reconstruct late Holocene climate variability, where the climatic signals are relatively small, and the duration of excursions could be brief. Instead, these proxies are well-suited to reconstruct large amplitude, longer-term shifts in climate such as deglacial transitions. Indeed, when applied to a peat deposit spanning the late glacial period (∼ 15. 2 kyr), we demonstrate that MAATpeat yields absolute temperatures and relative temperature changes that are consistent with those from other proxies. In addition, the application of MAATpeat to fossil peat (i. e. lignites) has the potential to reconstruct terrestrial climate during the Cenozoic. We conclude that there is clear potential to use brGDGTs in peats and lignites to reconstruct past terrestrial climate...|$|R

Specifically, luminescence sensors are favorable for optical interrogation since they are highly sensitive to analyte changes and may be implemented in lifetime or intensity-based systems. In order to develop particle-based fluorescent sensors, poly(2 -hydroxyethylmethacrylate) (HEMA) microspheres have been fabricated via membrane emulsification and characterized to evaluate the emulsion method and the overall process of tailoring properties to synthesize spheres of specific mean sizes. A pH-sensitive indicator seminaphthorhodafluors- 4 F 5 -(and- 6) -carboxylic acid (SNARF) was immobilized within the microspheres, and resulting sensor particles were exposed to various pH buffers to obtain a <b>pH</b> <b>calibration</b> curve based on intensity measurements. PolyHEMA microparticles were fabricated in a systematic study with measured mean sizes ranging from 8 - 21 um. Optical and scanning electron microscopy images revealed the formation of spherical, porous particles, which were additionally stabilized with polymer coatings. The lowest coefficient of variation value achieved was 50 %, indicating the inability to produce monodisperse particles due to the dispersity of pore sizes in the membrane. SNARF was immobilized within the polyHEMA spheres, and fluorescence was observed when exposing the sensors to different pH buffers on a fluorescence microscope. Ratiometric intensity measurements for the sensor particles were obtained on a spectrofluorometer while flowing pH buffers over the immobilized spheres in a reaction chamber.

Using this method, {{we are able to}} measure boron isotopic composition in carbonate with less then 1 ng of boron in the sample and further reconstruct calcification pH for biogenic carbonate as a biogeochemical archive. In this dissertation, we applied this method to investigate how environmental factors influence the boron incorporation in two unconventional biogenic carbonate archives: aragonite bivalve shells and calcite coccolithophores. In the bivalve shell Arctica islandica study, we found that shells regulate their calcification pH, and that boron incorporation into the shell has a potential temperature dependence. Therefore, a culture experiment with fixed temperature and salinity, but variable pH is required to evaluate the species-specific relationship between boron and ambient seawater pH and the potential use of this proxy in this species. In the coccolithophorid species Pleurochrysis carterae study, we observed an ability for this organisms to adapt to ocean acidification. The boron isotopic composition in the coccoliths suggests it regulates vesicle pH to sustain calcification with decreasing environmental pH. With other geochemical constraints including the particulate inorganic carbon to particulate organic carbon ratio (PIC/POC) and stable isotopic compositions we found this coccolitophorid species is likely to change usage of inorganic carbon species from HCO 3 - to CO 2 (aq) as ambient medium pH decreases.

40|$|Many {{important}} biogeochemical {{processes that}} occur in marine sediments are intimately linked to pH dependent processes, but surprisingly {{little is known about}} the details of the pH profiles generated. This is mainly due to the difficulty of obtaining samples and measuring representative profiles. Such profiles have previously been determined using glass-membrane micro-electrodes, but this is slow and electrodes easily break in harsh sediments (insertion is “blind”). Profiles have also been measured using fluorescent dye-based sensors, but their handling needs special light sources and filters and sensor membrane preparation is quite complex, which has restricted its use to laboratory studies. A simple optical pH sensor has been developed for this application by immobilising bromothymol blue in a PVC membrane. This device responds in a pH range suitable for marine sediments. The sensor is simple to use, the dye does not leach and it gives a visible colour readout so when photographed, the pictures can be used to extract Red Green Blue values and converting them to colour index values representing the sensor colour. This can be related to pH via a colour index v <b>pH</b> <b>calibration</b> using standard buffers or seawater by bubbling CO 2.

The acid hydrolysis of K-feldspar to K-mica and quartz at a temperature of 225 degrees C. The determination of the hydrolysis equilibrium constant was limited to one temperature because of the very slow reaction rate at temperatures less than 300 degrees C. log(mK+/mH+) = 4. 2 (at 225 degrees C) Where a comparison could be made, {{the results of this}} study agreed well with previously published work, with the exception of the second dissociation constant of sulphuric acid at temperatures above 150 degrees C. Accurate values for the molal dissociation constant of the KSO- 4 ion pair are required at elevated temperatures before the pK degrees 2 results can be fully evaluated. This research was severely restricted by the unpredictable loss of electrical continuity between the two cell compartments at temperatures above 150 degrees C.

40|$|Thesis (MSc (Wine Biotechnology)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2006. The {{production}} of premium quality wine is dependant on excellent {{management of the}} total wine production value chain. To achieve this we need rapid and reliable analytical tools. Over the last decade Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy has made {{a significant contribution to}} wine research and {{in the last five years}} South African institutions have also exploited the use of this technology not only for research, but also in industrial cellars. The FT-IR apparatus is equipped with global calibrations and therefore we first investigated the validity of these for South African conditions. To achieve this new calibration sets for pH, titratable acidity and °Brix were made and compared to the global calibrations with statistical methods. Results obtained between the °Brix calibrations displayed high correlation and the global calibration can therefore be implemented. However, the new TA calibration was more accurate than the global calibration. Results were inconclusive for the new <b>pH</b> <b>calibration</b> sample set and therefore needs to be enlarged before it can be validated as the possibility of being more accurate exists. It was concluded that FT-IR spectroscopy in the simultaneous measurement for °Brix, pH and TA in grape must showed potential for accurate analysis and quality control purposes in an industrial cellar. Rapid analysis of these parameters will lead to higher throughput of grape must samples in the laboratory as well as adhering to good laboratory practices by validation. The importance of correct sample preparation in the laboratory was illustrated when using FT-IR spectroscopy for one-step analysis and adjustments to global calibrations. Results obtained showed that grape parameters such as °Brix, nitrogen content were not influenced by the two sample preparation methods (hand pressed vs. homogenised), but pH, TA, colour index, anthocyanins and polyphenols were influenced. Important key factors were identified in the quality control chain from vineyard to the cellar. Numerous grape loads had an increase in microbial populations after harvesting the vineyard and transport to the weighbridge. Transport is critical especially for the vineyards in the Lutzville area (had the highest yeast population), which are situated the furthest from the cellar. Sauvignon blanc had the highest acetic acid bacteria and lactic acid bacteria populations compared to the other cultivars. Gluconic acid, glycerol and arabitol was highly correlated to each other. High populations of acetic acid bacteria and lactic acid bacteria also had high levels of gluconic acid and 2, 3 -butanediol in the grape juice. Meso-inositol differed significantly between the vineyard and weighbridge and it had a high standard deviation compared to the mean value of all the samples between the vineyard and weighbridge. Temperature of grape loads delivered to the cellar ranged from 14 to 36 ºC, which had a major impact on the grape quality and the resultant wine. It can be concluded for this study that management of the total value chain is of critical importance to ensure that A-grade grapes results in good quality wine that merits the effort of the grape producer...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{observe the}} effects of ethanol extract of Rhizome Pinelliae Preparata on the {{intracellular}} pH value of human gastric cancer SGC 7901 cells. Methods: After coculturing SGC 7901 cells with ethanol extract of Rhizome Pinelliae Preparata (1, 0. 5, 0. 25 and 0. 125 mg/mL), cell viability was evaluated by chromatometry with 3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) staining. Intracellular pH value of SGC 7901 cells was measured in the monolayer by using the pH-sensitive fluorescent probe 2, 7 -bis-(2 -carboxyethyl) - 5 -carboxyfluorescein-acetoxymethyl ester. The extracellular pH value of culture medium was measured by a <b>pH</b> 211 <b>Calibration</b> Check Microprocessor <b>pH</b> Meter. Half-inhibitory concentration (IC 50) of ethanol extract culture to SGC 7901 cells was decided by the MTT method and expressions of vacuolar-H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) and Na+/H+ exchanger isoform 1 (NHE 1) mRNAs were examined by the method of fluorescence quantitative-polymerase chain reaction after 72 h of drug treatment. Results: Ethanol extract of Rhizome Pinelliae Preparata at different concentrations significantly inhibited the proliferation of SGC 7901 cells, lowered the intracellular pH values and heightened the extracellular pH values.

40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version is available from Elsevier via the DOI in this record. Glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs) are membrane-spanning lipids from Bacteria and Archaea that are ubiquitous {{in a range of}} natural archives and especially abundant in peat. Previous work demonstrated that the distribution of bacterial branched GDGTs (brGDGTs) in mineral soils is correlated to environmental factors such as mean annual air temperature (MAAT) and soil pH. However, the influence of these parameters on brGDGT distributions in peat is largely unknown. Here we investigate the distribution of brGDGTs in 470 samples from 96 peatlands around the world with a broad mean annual air temperature (− 8 to 27 °C) and pH (3 – 8) range and present the first peat-specific brGDGT-based temperature and <b>pH</b> <b>calibrations.</b> Our results demonstrate that the degree of cyclisation of brGDGTs in peat is positively correlated with pH, pH = 2. 49 x CBTpeat + 8. 07 (n = 51, R 2 65 = 0. 58, RMSE = 0. 8) and the degree of methylation of brGDGTs is positively correlated with MAAT, MAATpeat (°C) = 52. 18 x MBT 5 me’ – 23. 05 (n = 96, R 2 67 = 0. 76, RMSE = 4. 7 °C). 3 These peat-specific calibrations are distinct from the available mineral soil calibrations. In light of the error in the temperature calibration (4. 7 °C), we urge caution in any application to reconstruct late Holocene climate variability, where the climatic signals are relatively small, and the duration of excursions could be brief. Instead, these proxies are well-suited to reconstruct large amplitude, longer-term shifts in climate such as deglacial transitions. Indeed, when applied to a peat deposit spanning the late glacial period (15. 2 kyr), we demonstrate that MAATpeat yields absolute temperatures and relative temperature changes that are consistent with those from other proxies. In addition, the application of MAATpeat to fossil peat (i. e. lignites) has the potential to reconstruct terrestrial climate during the Cenozoic. We conclude that there is clear potential to use brGDGTs in peats and lignites to reconstruct past terrestrial climateThis research was funded through the advanced ERC grant “the greenhouse earth system” (T-GRES, project reference 340923), awarded to RDP.

In the present study, the binding of non-substrate xenobiotic compounds (herbicides and insecticides) to maize CST I was investigated by employing kinetic inhibition studies, site-directed mutagenesis and molecular modelling studies. The {{results showed that the}} xenobiotics bind at the substrate binding site. Based on in silico docking analysis, two residues were selected for assessing their contribution to xenobiotic binding. The mutant GIn 53 Ala of GST I Exhibits 9. 2 -fold higher inhibition potency for the insecticide malathion, compared to the wild-type enzyme. A potentiometric assay was developed for the determination of malathion using the GIn 53 Ala mutant enzyme. The assay explores the ability of the xenobiotic to promote inhibition of the GST-catalysing 1 -chloro- 2, 4 -dinitrobenzene (CDNB) /glutathione (GSH) conjugation reaction. The sensing scheme is based on the pH change occurring in a low buffer system by the GST reaction, which is measured potentiometrically using a <b>pH</b> electrode. <b>Calibration</b> curve was obtained for malathion,with useful concentration range 0 - 20 mu M. The method's reproducibility was in the order of +/- 3 - 5 % and malathion recoveries were 96. 7 +/- 2. 8 %. Immobilized GIn 53 Ala mutant GST was used to assemble a biosensor for malathion. The enzyme was immobilized by crosslinking with glutaraldehyde and trapped behind a semipermeable membrane in front of the pH electrode.

40|$|The {{increased}} interest in architecting nanocomposites and in clarifying their impact on health and environment necessitates a standardized method of surface characterization, because the behaviour of nanoparticles is governed largely by their surface free energy and interfacial chemistry. Potentiometric acid–base titration {{has been used for}} decades to determine surface charge density of oxides, tremendously useful in understanding and modelling oxide/electrolyte interfaces. The method has solid theoretical and experimental foundation. Yet, published values of the point of zero charge (PZC) of chemically identical oxides scatter widely: the deviation of seven units of pH is the rule, rather than an exception. The PZC must reflect the inherent charging behaviour, linked exclusively to the protonation, and determined by the chemistry of the oxides. Assignment of PZC (just like assignment of equilibrium constant of any chemical reaction) requires strict conditions and consistent protocol. We present here such a protocol, and some examples of application. The protocol leads through the basic steps: <b>pH</b> buffer <b>calibration,</b> proton concentration calibration in the background electrolytes, and titrations of oxides. Built-in tests help to eliminate artificial side effects simultaneously from the measurement of pH and from the oxide/electrolyte interfacial equilibria. Although these may seem self-evident, literature survey proves the {{need to go back to}} basics in order to obtain precise, reliable and comparable pH-dependent charging of oxides. It is most general that the oxides contain some unrecognized surface impurities and have a strongly pH-dependent dissolution. These distort the results of titrations; their effect increases with decreasing particle size and can become dominant for nanoparticles. The protocol presented here contains the necessary feedback loops to easily recognize and exclude these side effects...|$|R

The reaction is carried out in the presence of 25 mM heptakis-(2, 6 -di-O-methyl) -beta-cyclodextrin that prevents precipitation of the protonated form of porphyrins 4 or 5 due to the formation of strong inclusion complexes.
