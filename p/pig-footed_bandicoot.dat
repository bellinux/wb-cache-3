25|$|The {{region is}} also home to many fauna species that are rare and vulnerable. There are 32 {{threatened}} vertebrate species on the endangered fauna list of the Western Australian Government, which include 16 mammals, 8 birds and 8 reptiles, all of which exist or are likely to exist in the Great Western Woodlands. Furthermore, the <b>pig-footed</b> <b>bandicoot,</b> the long-tailed hopping mouse, the crescent nail-tailed wallaby and the broad-faced potoroo that were once found in the Great Western Woodlands, are now considered globally extinct.|$|E
25|$|The newborn {{marsupial}} {{uses its}} forelimbs (with relatively strong hands) {{to climb to}} a nipple, which is usually in a pouch on the mother's belly. The mother feeds the baby by contracting muscles over her mammary glands, as the baby is too weak to suck. The newborn marsupial's need to use its forelimbs in climbing to the nipple was historically thought to have restricted metatherian evolution, as {{it was assumed that}} the forelimb couldn't become specialised intro structures like wings, hooves or flippers. However, several bandicoots, most notably the <b>pig-footed</b> <b>bandicoot,</b> have true hooves similar to those of placental ungulates, and several marsupial gliders have evolved.|$|E
25|$|The subregion {{contains}} many endemic plant {{species in the}} Eucalyptus, Acacia, Proteaceae such as Grevillea, Hakea and Banksia; and various Asteraceae. It contains numerous rare, endangered and priority flora. It also supports a number of rare or endangered fauna, including some that fall within the critical weight range for predation by foxes. The <b>pig-footed</b> <b>bandicoot</b> (Chaeropus ecaudatus) and crescent nailtail wallaby (Onychogalea lunata) previously occurred in the subregion, but both are now extinct. The rufous hare-wallaby (Lagorchestes hirsutus) is now extinct in the wild, and a further ten species of mammal are extinct in the subregion. The endangered red-tailed phascogale (Phascogale calura) still occurs in the region, as do the vulnerable black-flanked rock-wallaby (Petrogale lateralis) and heath rat (Pseudomys shortridgei), and the western brush wallaby (Macropus irma).|$|E
50|$|Tim Flannery {{suggests}} that breeding occurred between May and June and that twins {{may have been}} the norm for this species. From the size of its pouch and comparison with other marsupials of this size, it can be inferred that <b>pig-footed</b> <b>bandicoots</b> did not carry more than four young per litter.|$|R
50|$|It was a solitary, {{nocturnal animal}} that would sleep in its shelter {{during the day}} and emerge in the evening to feed, using its keen sense of smell to find food. Depending on the habitat, <b>pig-footed</b> <b>bandicoots</b> used a variety of shelters to hide from predators and for sleeping. In wooded areas and grasslands these ranged from hollow logs and nests made out of grass, while in arid {{treeless}} country this animal used to dig short, straight burrows with a nest at the end.|$|R
2500|$|The {{settlement}} of Australia by Indigenous Australians between 48,000 and 70,000 years ago [...] (research in 2011 using DNA suggesting an arrival around 50,000 years ago), and by Europeans from 1788, has significantly affected the fauna. Hunting, {{the introduction of}} non-native species, and land-management practices involving the modification or destruction of habitats have led to numerous extinctions. Some examples include the paradise parrot, <b>pig-footed</b> <b>bandicoot</b> and the broad-faced potoroo. Unsustainable land use still threatens the survival of many species. To target threats {{to the survival of}} its fauna, Australia has passed wide-ranging federal and state legislation and established numerous protected areas.|$|E
50|$|The <b>pig-footed</b> <b>bandicoot</b> (Chaeropus ecaudatus) {{was a small}} {{marsupial}} of {{the arid}} and semi-arid plains of Australia. The distribution range of the species was later reduced to an inland desert region, where it was last recorded in the 1950s; it is now presumed to be extinct.|$|E
50|$|The <b>pig-footed</b> <b>bandicoot</b> had a {{body size}} of 23-26 cm and a 10-15 cm long tail. In form, {{it was almost}} bilby-like on first sight, having long, slender limbs, large, pointed ears, and a long tail. On closer examination, however, it became {{apparent}} that the <b>pig-footed</b> <b>bandicoot</b> was very unusual for a marsupial. The forefeet had two functional toes with hooves, rather similar to a pig or deer; this is possibly due to juveniles being deposited in the pouch through external stalks, thus relieving them of using the forelimbs while as joeys. The hind feet had an enlarged fourth toe with a heavy claw shaped like a tiny horse's hoof, with the other toes being vestigial:only the fused second and third toes being useful, and that not for locomotion but for grooming.|$|E
50|$|The Peramelidae {{family of}} {{marsupials}} contains {{all of the}} extant bandicoots. One known extinct species of bandicoot, the <b>pig-footed</b> <b>bandicoot,</b> was {{so different from the}} other species, it was recently moved into its own family. Four fossil peramelids are described. They are found throughout Australia and New Guinea, with at least some species living in every available habitat, from rainforest to desert.|$|E
50|$|The <b>pig-footed</b> <b>bandicoot</b> was {{native to}} western New South Wales and Victoria, the {{southern}} part of the Northern Territory as well as South Australia and Western Australia. It inhabited a wide range of habitat types: from grassy woodland and grassland plains to the spinifex country and arid flats of central Australia. Despite its wide range, the species had a sparse distribution and was never abundant.|$|E
5000|$|From {{surviving}} eyewitness {{reports and}} analyses of gut contents, dentition, and gut structure of museum specimens, {{it appears that}} the <b>pig-footed</b> <b>bandicoot</b> was the most herbivorous of bandicoots; although captive specimens were fond of meat and Aborigines reported that it ate grasshoppers, ants and termites, the bulk of its diet was almost certainly leaves, roots and grasses. In captivity it was observed that they drank [...] "a good deal of water".|$|E
5000|$|Few {{scientists}} {{had the opportunity}} to observe a live <b>pig-footed</b> <b>bandicoot,</b> with the only existing account of its behaviour suggesting that it moved [...] "like a broken-down hack in a canter, apparently dragging the hind quarters after it".This is contradicted by the Aboriginal people of central Australia, who knew it well and reported that if disturbed, it was capable of running with considerable speed by breaking into a smooth, galloping sprint.|$|E

50|$|Bruce Leake, {{a farmer}} from nearby Kellerberrin, {{documented}} the rich past fauna {{of the eastern}} wheatbelt in the late 1800s. These included possum, phascogale, tammar wallaby, brush wallaby, rock-wallaby, nailtail wallaby, banded hare-wallaby, rufous hare-wallaby, woylie, boodie, <b>pig-footed</b> <b>bandicoot,</b> dalgite, numbat and chuditch. Many of these species would {{have occurred in the}} Narembeen district also. Unfortunately, very little of this fauna remains. It has only been comparatively recently that this loss of fauna has been attributed largely to predation by introduced foxes and feral cats.|$|E

50|$|Because newborn {{marsupials}} must {{climb up}} to their mother's nipples, their front limbs are much more developed {{than the rest of}} their bodies at the time of birth. This requirement has been argued to have resulted in the limited range of locomotor adaptations in marsupials compared to placentals. Marsupials must develop grasping forepaws during their early youth, making the transition from these limbs into hooves, wings, or flippers, as some groups of placental mammals have done, far more difficult. However, several marsupials do possess atypical forelimb morphologies, such as the hooved forelimbs of the <b>pig-footed</b> <b>bandicoot,</b> suggesting that the range of forelimb speciation is a lot less limited than usually assumed.|$|E
50|$|The newborn {{marsupial}} {{uses its}} forelimbs (with relatively strong hands) {{to climb to}} a nipple, which is usually in a pouch on the mother's belly.

The endangered red-tailed phascogale (Phascogale calura) still occurs in the region, as do the vulnerable black-flanked rock-wallaby (Petrogale lateralis) and heath rat (Pseudomys shortridgei), and the western brush wallaby (Macropus irma).|$|E
5000|$|Classification {{within the}} Peramelemorphia {{used to be}} simple. There {{were thought to be}} two {{families}} in the order—the short-legged and mostly herbivorous bandicoots, and the longer-legged, nearly carnivorous bilbies. In recent years, however, it has become clear that the situation is more complex. First, the bandicoots of the New Guinean and far-northern Australian rainforests were deemed distinct from all other bandicoots and were grouped together in the separate family Peroryctidae. More recently, the bandicoot families were reunited in Peramelidae, with the New Guinean species split into four genera in two subfamilies, Peroryctinae and Echymiperinae, while the [...] "true bandicoots" [...] occupy the subfamily Peramelinae. The only exception is the now extinct <b>pig-footed</b> <b>bandicoot,</b> which has been given its own family, Chaeropodidae.|$|E
50|$|The {{cause of}} the {{extinction}} remains uncertain: neither {{of the two most}} destructive introduced exterminator species, the fox and the rabbit, had yet arrived in south-west Western Australia when the <b>pig-footed</b> <b>bandicoot</b> disappeared from that area. Feral cats were already common, which may offer an explanation; it is perhaps more likely that the decline was caused by a double habitat change. Firstly, the end of many thousands of years of Aboriginal burning which, being confined to a patchwork of small areas at any one time, had ensured both fresh new growth in the recently burnt areas and adjacent older growth for shelter and as a base for recolonisation. However, Australia's Aboriginal population had declined by around 90% during the 19th century, largely be{{cause of the}} introduction of European diseases, and the remaining Aborigines were often no longer permitted to carry on their traditional land-management and hunting practices. Secondly, following {{on the heels of the}} near-extermination of the Aborigines, came the introduction of vast numbers of sheep and cattle, leading to significant changes in soil structure, plant growth, and food availability.|$|E
5000|$|According to Indigenous Australian oral {{tradition}} this species was rare {{even before the}} arrival of Europeans on the continent and was in a serious decline even as it first came to scientific notice in the middle years of the 19th century. Two specimens of <b>pig-footed</b> <b>bandicoot</b> were obtained by local people in 1857 for Gerard Krefft, who accompanied the Blandowski Expedition. Despite the trouble taken in gaining living specimens, Krefft recorded his observations with an apology for eating one of them. Only a handful of specimens were collected through {{the second part of the}} 19th century, mostly from northwestern Victoria, but also from arid country in South Australia, Western Australia, and the Northern Territory. By the start of the 20th century, it had become extinct in Victoria and the south-west of Western Australia. The last certain specimen was collected in 1901. By 1945 the species vanished from South Australia and was reported to be limited to [...] "a slight foothold in central Australia". Nevertheless, Aboriginal people report that it survived as late as the 1950s in the Gibson Desert and the Great Sandy Desert of Western Australia.|$|E
