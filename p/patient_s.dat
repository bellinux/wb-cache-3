5000|$|Analyzing the comorbid {{state of}} <b>patient</b> <b>S,</b> 73 years of age, using the most used {{international}} comorbidity assessment scales, a doctor would come across totally different evaluation. The uncertainty {{of these results}} would somewhat complicate the doctors judgment about the factual level of severity of the patient's condition and would complicate the process of prescribing rational medicinal therapy for the identified disorders. Such problems are faced by doctors on everyday basis, despite all their knowledge about medical science. The main hurdle {{in the way of}} inducting comorbidity evaluation systems in broad based diagnostic-therapeutic process is their inconsistency and narrow focus. Despite the variety of methods of evaluation of comorbidity, the absence of a singular generally accepted method, devoid of the deficiencies of the available methods of its evaluation, causes disturbance. The absence of a unified instrument, developed on the basis of colossal international experience, as well as the methodology of its use does not allow comorbidity to become doctor [...] "friendly". At the same time due to the inconsistency in approach to the analysis of comorbid state and absence of components of comorbidity in medical university courses, the practitioner is unclear about its prognostic effect, which makes the generally available systems of associated pathology evaluation unreasoned and therefore un-needed as well.|$|E

It was known from the case history that the patient suffered from CHD for many years. Such chest pains were experienced by her earlier as well, but they always disappeared {{after a few minutes}} of sublingual administration of organic nitrates. This time taking three tablets of nitroglycerine did not kill the pain. It was also known from the case history that the patient had twice suffered during the last ten years from myocardial infarction, as well as from Acute Cerebrovascular Event with sinistral hemiplegia more than 15 years ago. Apart from that the patient suffers from hypertension, type 2 diabetes with diabetic nephropathy, hysteromyoma, cholelithiasis, osteoporosis and varicose pedi-vein disease. It also came to knowledge that the patient regularly takes a number of antihypertensive drugs, urinatives and oral antihyperglycemic remedies, as well as statins, antiplatelet and nootropics. In the past the patient had undergone cholecystectomy due to cholelithiasis more than 20 years ago, as well as the extraction of crystalline tumor due to cataract of the right eye 4 years ago. The patient was admitted to cardiac intensive care unit at a general hospital diagnosed for acute transmural myocardial infarction. During the check-up moderate azotemia, mild erythronormoblastic anemia, proteinuria and lowering of left vascular ejection fraction were also identified.|$|E
5000|$|Charlson Index: This {{index is}} {{meant for the}} {{long-term}} prognosis of comorbid patients and was developed by M. E. Charlson in 1987. This index {{is based on a}} point scoring system (from 0 to 40) for the presence of specific associated diseases and is used for prognosis of lethality. For its calculation the points are accumulated, according to associated diseases, as well as the addition of a single point for each 10 years of age for patients of ages above forty years (in 50 years 1 point, 60 years 2 points etc.). The distinguishing feature and undisputed advantage of the Charlson Index is the capability of evaluating the patient's age and determination of the patient's mortality rate, which in the absence of comorbidity is 12%, at 1-2 points it is 26%; at 3-4 points it is 52% and with the accumulation of more than 5 points it is 85%. Regretfully this method has some deficiencies: Evaluating comorbidity severity of many diseases is not considered, as well as the absence of many important for prognosis disorders. Apart from that it is doubtful that possible prognosis for a patient suffering from bronchial asthma and chronic leukemia is comparable to the prognosis for the patient ailing from myocardial infarction and cerebral infarction. In this case comorbidity of <b>patient</b> <b>S,</b> 73 years of age according to this method, is equivalent to mild state (9 out of 40 points).|$|E

40|$|International audienceHuman face {{perception}} {{requires a}} network of brain regions distributed throughout the occipital and temporal lobes with a right hemisphere advantage. Present theories consider this network as either a processing hierarchy beginning with the inferior occipital gyrus (occipital face area; IOG-faces/OFA) or a multiple-route network with nonhierarchical components. The former predicts that removing IOG-faces/OFA will detrimentally affect downstream stages, whereas the latter does not. We tested this prediction in a human patient (<b>Patient</b> <b>S.</b> P.) requiring removal of the right inferior occipital cortex, including IOG-faces/OFA. We acquired multiple fMRI measurements in <b>Patient</b> <b>S.</b> P. before and after a preplanned surgery and multiple measurements in typical controls, enabling both within-subject/across-session comparisons (<b>Patient</b> <b>S.</b> P. before resection vs <b>Patient</b> <b>S.</b> P. after resection) and between-subject/across-session comparisons (<b>Patient</b> <b>S.</b> P. vs controls). We found that the spatial topology and selectivity of downstream ipsilateral face-selective regions were stable 1 and 8 month(s) after surgery. Additionally, the reliability of distributed patterns of face selectivity in <b>Patient</b> <b>S.</b> P. before versus after resection was not different from across-session reliability in controls. Nevertheless, postoperatively, representations of visual space were typical in dorsal face-selective regions but atypical in ventral face-selective regions and V 1 of the resected hemisphere. Diffusion weighted imaging in <b>Patient</b> <b>S.</b> P. and controls identifies white matter tracts connecting retinotopic areas to downstream face-selective regions, which {{may contribute to the}} stable and plastic features of the face network in <b>Patient</b> <b>S.</b> P. after surgery. Together, our results support a multiple-route network of face processing with nonhierarchical components and shed light on stable and plastic features of high-level visual cortex following focal brain damage. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Brain networks consist of interconnected functional regions commonly organized in processing hierarchies. Prevailing theories predict that damage to the input of the hierarchy will detrimentally affect later stages. We tested this prediction with multiple brain measurements in a rare human patient requiring surgical removal of the putative input to a network processing faces. Surprisingly, the spatial topology and selectivity of downstream face-selective regions are stable after surgery. Nevertheless, representations of visual space were typical in dorsal face-selective regions but atypical in ventral face-selective regions and V 1. White matter connections from outside the face network may support these stable and plastic features. As processing hierarchies are ubiquitous in biological and nonbiological systems, our results have pervasive implications for understanding the construction of resilient networks...|$|E

In order to assess the consent such requirements have to be addressed by the responsible healthcare professional, which in most cases will be the doctor. In Norway, however, the legal directions are to some extent rather complex.

Some general questions which might be addressed when assessing decision-making capacity are discussed. Some examples on open issues not clearly solved by the legal guidelines are pointed out, with suggestions on how to solve these. These examples include the assessment of decision-making capacity for persons under guardianship, children, adolescence and adults. The results identify the need for health-care professionals to be sufficiently educated. The need for quality assurance systems in healthcare is also pointed out.

40|$|BACKGROUND:The {{association}} of sarcoidosis (S) and thyroid autoimmunity {{has been reported}} by several studies {{in a wide range}} of variability. The aim of our study was to evaluate the prevalence of clinical and subclinical thyroid disorders in <b>patients</b> with <b>S</b> vs gender-matched and age-matched control subjects. METHODS:Thyroid hormones and antithyroid antibodies, thyroid ultrasonography and fine-needle aspiration were performed in 111 <b>patients</b> with <b>S</b> who had been consecutively referred to the Respiratory Pathophysiology Section of the University of Pisa, and the results were compared to 333 gender-matched and age-matched control subjects from the same geographic area. RESULTS:The odds ratio for subclinical hypothyroidism for female <b>patients</b> with <b>S</b> vs control subjects was 2. 7 (95 % confidence interval [CI], 1. 3 to 5. 9); for anti-thyroid peroxidase antibody titer (AbTPO) positivity, 2. 2 (95 % CI, 1. 2 to 3. 9); and for thyroid autoimmunity, 1. 9 (95 % CI, 1. 1 to 3. 2). The mean values of thyroid-stimulating hormone and AbTPO were higher in female <b>S</b> <b>patients</b> than in control subjects (p < 0. 01). A significantly higher prevalence of clinical hypothyroidism (four patients) and Graves disease (three patients) was observed in female <b>S</b> <b>patients</b> than in control subjects (none; p = 0. 005 and 0. 0026, respectively).

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{function}} of conflict prevention performed by keywords and key-expressions within medical consultations. Doctor-patient interaction within medical consultations {{can be interpreted as}} a problem-solving discussion, as it is oriented to the solution of a certain health problem. As such, medical consultations are based on an argumentative discussion, in which, roughly speaking, both parties try to reason together in order to find a solution for the <b>patient</b> <b>s</b> health problem. In this sense, a non-mixed dispute (van Eemeren and Grootendorst 2004) often arises, in which doctor and patient discuss a standpoint, normally advanced by the doctor, about the <b>patient</b> <b>s</b> diagnosis or therapy. Problem-solving, however, is not the only possible interaction scheme (Rigotti and Rocci 2006) that can be involved in doctor-patient consultations. Indeed, other more confrontational interaction schemes are possible, which may also tend to real controversies; these cases are often triggered by the asymmetry of competences and knowledge which is typical of the relationship between doctors and patients. Such situations, of course, affect the quality of the consultation, because the issue at stake ceases to be the <b>patient</b> <b>s</b> health, and becomes the relationship between the patient and the doctor (in terms of trust, reliability, etc.). Ultimately, this may have negative effects on the <b>patient</b> <b>s</b> health and, thus, more in general, may contradict the raison d être of the health system. Thus during the medical consultation conflicts need to be avoided both by doctor and patient. The choice of keywords and key-expressions appears to be a crucial step within a strategy of conflict prevention. In fact, thanks to their close link to the relevant endoxa, their ability to trigger inferences, and their centrality within the argumentative structure of persuasive texts, keywords can be very important tools in the creation of emotive arguments and the prevention of conflict. Relying on examples from real-life consultations, this paper shows how keywords and key-expressions realize this function...|$|E

Do they find these ethical terms at all relevant for their non-treatment decision-making? Methods A qualitative analysis framework according to Malterud was used to analyze sixteen Norwegian physicians from relevant specialties' interviews. Interviews were divided in two parts. In part one the physician told their story where they performed non- treatment decision-making. In part two the interviewers asked the physician questions regarding the concepts of hastening, causing, and intending the <b>patient</b> <b>s</b> death, applied to the stories they had related. Results When analyzing the interviews, it became very clear that none of the physicians used ethical terms when describing their non-treatment decisions. Concepts such as hastening, causing and intending the <b>patient</b> <b>s</b> death seemed almost foreign to most of them in their practical considerations. There was almost a consensus amongst physicians in finding such concepts irrelevant to the moral assessment of their end- of-life practices. Physicians were always attempting to achieve the proper balance of the level of treatment at life s end; this was also their main dilemma. When framing their dilemmas, physicians did so not in ethical terms but medical terms. Conclusion Through the study, it became clear that the core concepts of traditional medico- ethical analyses of end-of-life decision-making (intending, causing and hastening death) do not match up with the practical landscape. There is, therefore, a need to rethink the ethical analysis of non-treatment decision, as well as the ethical concepts and their place in such an analysis...|$|E
40|$|Images {{compression}} is {{a widely}} studied topic. Conventional situations offer variable compression ratios depending on the image in question and, in general, do not yield good results for images that are rich in tones. This work is an application of images compression of <b>patient</b> <b>s</b> computed tomographies using neural networks, which allows to carry out both compression and decompression of the images with a fixed ratio of 8 : 1 {{and a loss of}} 2 %.

40|$|AIM [...] To {{investigate}} {{the fate of}} Streptococcus pneumoniae C-polysaccharide antigen in serum in <b>patients</b> with <b>S</b> pneumoniae bacteraemia. METHOD [...] In vitro dissociation experiments were performed to demonstrate that C-polysaccharide was masked by ligands in normal and acute phase serum. Serum samples from 22 <b>patients</b> with <b>S</b> pneumoniae bacteraemia were treated to dissociate immune complexes and then tested for C-polysaccharide by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS [...] C-polysaccharide antigen was masked in normal and acute phase serum but could be released by EDTA treatment and detected by ELISA. Antigen was found in six patients ranging in concentration from 2. 5 to 200 ng/ml. Patients with detectable antigen {{were more likely to}} die than those in whom antigen was not detected. CONCLUSION [...] This study demonstrates that C-polysaccharide antigen commonly circulates in <b>patients</b> with <b>S</b> pneumoniae bacteraemia but its presence is masked by ligands present in serum...|$|R
40|$|Objectives. The aim of {{the study}} was to assess {{long-term}} state and trait anxiety in cardiac surgical risk patients. Design. Thirty two <b>patients</b> with serum <b>S</b> 100 B > 0. 3 mu g/l 48 hours after cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass were matched according to age, gender, type, date and length of surgery with 35 operated <b>patients</b> without elevated <b>S</b> 100 B. They completed Spielberger's Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Results. <b>Patients</b> with elevated <b>S</b> 100 B reported more state anxiety and trait anxiety. S 100 B was an independent predictor of both state and trait anxiety when controlling for perioperative variables. Conclusions. <b>Patients</b> with elevated <b>S</b> 100 B reported more anxiety 3 - 6 years after cardiac surgery. A postoperative blood sample can identify risk patients and facilitate appropriate follow-up...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Objective: Restoration of the {{sensitivity}} to sensory stimuli in complete brachial plexus injury is very important. The objective {{of our study}} was to evaluate sensory recovery in brachial plexus surgery using the intercostobrachial nerve (ICBN) as the donor. Methods: Eleven patients underwent sensory reconstruction using the ICBN as a donor to the lateral cord contribution to the median nerve, with a mean follow-up period of 41 months. A protocol evaluation was performed. Results: Four patients perceived the 1 -green filament. The 2 -blue, 3 -purple and 4 -red filaments were perceptible in one, two and three patients, respectively. According to Highet's scale, sensation recovered to S 3 in two <b>patients,</b> to <b>S</b> 2 + in two <b>patients,</b> to <b>S</b> 2 in six <b>patients,</b> and <b>S</b> 0 in one patient. Conclusion: The procedure using the ICBN as a sensory donor restores good intensity of sensation and shows good results in location of perception in patients with complete brachial plexus avulsion...|$|R
