Current efforts at reducing some of these <b>physical</b> <b>requirements</b> stem from concerns with health and safety, the need to conserve soldier strength and endurance for other battlefield tasks, and the need to optimize personnel utilization. This paper describes an ongoing feasibility study aimed at identifying and attempting to reduce physical demands in five MOSs. Three data-collection phases involve (a) review of publications describing occupational tasks, (b) structured interviews with subject matter experts (SMEs), and (c) filming the most physically demanding tasks. The fourth phase involves use of SMEs and ergonomists to identify specific redesign solutions. An illustrative example is provided. This technique coupled with others (job selection and physical training) can enhance military operational capability by reducing <b>physical</b> <b>requirements...</b>|$|R
