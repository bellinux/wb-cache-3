In this practice, the brokerage firm generally acquires the block of stock by purchasing a large block of the securities (usually from a large shareholder who is not affiliated with the underlying company) at a negotiated price that is well below the current market price (generally 40% to 50% below the then-current quoted offer/ask price) or it acquires the stock as payment for a consulting agreement.|$|E
25|$|The plaintiff, Anthony Wilko, {{alleged that}} he had been the victim of a <b>pump</b> <b>and</b> <b>dump</b> scheme perpetrated by his broker and a {{corporate}} executive. Early in 1951 he bought 1,600 shares of common stock in Air Associates, Inc., a New Jersey company, for $29,517.54 ($ in contemporary dollars). He claimed to have done so because his stockbroker at Hayden Stone, Joseph Swan, had represented to him that Air was about to conclude a merger with Borg Warner, which would likely lead to the price increasing by as much as $6 over what it was then trading at when the merger was announced. Swan did not tell Wilko that Haven Page, counsel for Air Associates and a director of that company, was selling a large holding of his, including some of the stock Wilko purchased.|$|E
25|$|In 1950, when a {{brokerage}} firm {{had tried to}} compel arbitration with an investor alleging his broker left him holding the bag in a <b>pump</b> <b>and</b> <b>dump</b> scheme, the case had gone {{all the way to}} the Supreme Court. In 1953 it had held in Wilko v. Swan that three provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 (or, the 1933 Act), which regulates the primary market in which securities issuers sell directly to buyers, were controlling, allowing investors to take their claims to court regardless of what contracts and the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) said. It found that the language in the 1933 Act voiding any waiver of any provision of the statute was broad enough to cover arbitration clauses, and deduced congressional preference for the courts in language that allowed a special cause of action where the burden of proof was on the seller of the security to show that they were unaware of the dubious nature of the security sold, and allowed buyers to sue in any state or federal court of competent jurisdiction.|$|E

2500|$|Many penny stocks, {{particularly}} those that sell for fractions of a cent, are thinly traded. They can become the target of stock promoters and manipulators. These manipulators first purchase large quantities of stock, then artificially inflate the share price through false and misleading positive statements. This {{is referred to as}} a <b>pump</b> <b>and</b> <b>dump</b> scheme. The <b>pump</b> <b>and</b> <b>dump</b> is a form of microcap stock fraud.

5000|$|Very closely {{based on}} the Norton engine, the MidWest engine {{nevertheless}} took things a stage further. The lubrication system became a semi-total-loss system whereby Silkolene 2-stroke oil was directly injected into the inlet tracts and onto the main roller bearings, but the oil that fed the bearings became an oil-mist within the rotor-cooling air, and around 30% of the oil was recovered {{and returned to the}} remote oil tank. Unlike the Nortons, the rotor-cooling air was forced in by a belt-driven centrifugal <b>pump</b> <b>and</b> then <b>dumped</b> overboard as it was considered too hot for ideal volumetric efficiency. Instead, ambient-temperature combustion air was inducted into the engine separately. Early Midwest engines had simple Tillotson carburettors, but these proved unsatisfactory, and later engines were fitted with fuel injection.

2500|$|The {{regulation}} {{contains two}} key components: the [...] "locate" [...] and the [...] "close-out." [...] The locate component attempts to reduce failure to deliver securities by requiring a broker possess or have arranged to possess borrowed shares. The close out component requires that a broker {{be able to}} deliver the shares that are to be shorted. In the US, initial public offers (IPOs) cannot be sold short for a month after they start trading. This mechanism is in place to ensure a degree of price stability during a company's initial trading period. However, some brokerage firms that specialize in penny stocks (referred to colloquially as bucket shops) have used the lack of short selling during this month to <b>pump</b> <b>and</b> <b>dump</b> thinly traded IPOs. Canada and other countries do allow selling IPOs (including U.S. IPOs) short.|$|E
2500|$|The {{regulation}} and prosecution of securities fraud violations is undertaken {{on a broad}} front, involving numerous government agencies and self-regulatory organizations. One method of regulating and restricting {{a specific type of}} fraud perpetrated by <b>pump</b> <b>and</b> <b>dump</b> manipulators, is to target the category of stocks most often associated with this scheme. To that end, penny stocks have been the target of heightened enforcement efforts. In the United States, regulators have defined a penny stock as a security that must meet a number of specific standards. The criteria include price, market capitalization, and minimum shareholder equity. Securities traded on a national stock exchange, regardless of price, are exempt from regulatory designation as a penny stock, since it is thought that exchange traded securities are less vulnerable to manipulation. Therefore, CitiGroup (NYSE:C) and other NYSE listed securities which [...] traded below $1.00 during the market downturn of 2008–2009, while properly regarded as [...] "low priced" [...] securities, were not technically [...] "penny stocks". Although penny stock trading in the United States is now primarily controlled through rules and regulations enforced by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), the genesis of this control is found in State securities law. The State of Georgia was the first state to codify a comprehensive penny stock securities law. Secretary of State Max Cleland, whose office enforced State securities laws was a principal proponent of the legislation. Representative Chesley V. Morton, the only stockbroker in the Georgia General Assembly at the time, was principal sponsor of the bill in the House of Representatives. Georgia's penny stock law was subsequently challenged in court. However, the law was eventually upheld in U.S. District Court, and the statute became the template for laws enacted in other states. Shortly thereafter, both FINRA and the SEC enacted comprehensive revisions of their penny stock regulations. These regulations proved effective in either closing or greatly restricting broker/dealers, such as Blinder, Robinson & Company, which specialized in the penny stocks sector. Meyer Blinder was jailed for securities fraud in 1992, after the collapse of his firm. However, sanctions under these specific regulations lack an effective means to address <b>pump</b> <b>and</b> <b>dump</b> schemes perpetrated by unregistered groups and individuals.|$|E

40|$|The {{interaction}} of two narrow band (delta v< 100 MHz) UV light pulses of different intensity with a molecular three-level system is investigated experimentally. The laser frequencies are tuned to an up (<b>pump)</b> <b>and</b> a down (<b>dump)</b> transition sharing a common excited rovibronic S 1 level whose population is probed by {{a transition to}} the ionization continuum and ion detection. The time sequence of the two pulses results either in a lambda type coherent stimulated Raman adiabatic passage or a stimulated emission pumping (SEP) process. When the first case is realized by a 6. 4 ns delay of the low intensity pump laser from the high intensity dump laser pulse, a fourfold increase of {{the depth of the}} ion dips compared to the SEP experiment is observed.

N. HunterR. van Grondelle, submitted). The theory of pump - dump - probe response is evaluated using the doorway - window approach {{in combination with}} the modified Redfield theory. We demonstrate that a simultaneous fit of linear spectra, <b>pump</b> - probe, <b>and</b> <b>pump</b> - <b>dump</b> - probe kinetics can be obtained at a quantitative level using the disordered exciton model, which is essentially the same as used to model the spectral fluctuations in single LH 2 complexes (Novoderezhkin, V.; Rutkauskas, D.; van Grondelle, R. Biophys. J. 2006, 90, 2890). The present studies suggest that the observed relaxation rates are strongly dependent on the realization of the disorder. A big spread of the rates (exceeding 3 orders of magnitude) is correlated with the disorder-induced changes in delocalization length and overlap of the exciton wave functions. We conclude that the bulk kinetics reflect a superposition of many pathways corresponding to different physical limits of energy transfer, varying from sub- 20 fs relaxation between delocalized and highly spatially overlapping exciton states to > 20 ps jumps between states localized at the opposite sides of the ring. © 2011 American Chemical Society...|$|R
