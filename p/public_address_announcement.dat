The full team introduction demonstrated solidarity, and struck a chord with the audience in the wake of the 9/11 attacks. Since 2003, both Super Bowl contestants are introduced as a team, a precedent which has continued.|$|E

[...] At the end of the following over, a <b>public</b> <b>address</b> <b>announcement</b> that Arlott had completed his final commentary session prompted the crowd to give Arlott an ovation. The entire Australian team in the field and the two England batsmen joined in, with Geoffrey Boycott removing his batting gloves to applaud. Later that day, after the match ended in a draw, he came onto the Lord's balcony to present the Man of the Match award. When he appeared, the crowd below again burst into a spontaneous ovation that lasted for several minutes before he was finally able to speak and make the presentation to Kim Hughes.|$|E

5000|$|Reaction time to an {{evacuation}} can vary widely, {{depending on the}} type of emergency, its perceived danger, and any false alarms of such an emergency beforehand. It can even be affected by the means of communication. In one study, mock alarms were broadcast to subway riders in London, England using different forms of address: a simple , a bell followed by instructions from subway staff, a <b>public</b> <b>address</b> <b>announcement</b> lasting 30 seconds and broadcast twice, a combination of staff instructions and public address, and finally by instructions, public address, informing people of the emergency, and announcing the type of emergency.

50|$|The {{automated}} <b>public</b> <b>address</b> <b>announcement</b> can {{be generated}} automatically by the station's fire warning system, or can be triggered from the station control. The message audio file is usually stored as the primary standard emergency announcement on the station PA/VA system. The message may indicate that a single fire alarm call point in a public area has been operated. If an automatic fire detector in a non-public area is operated, or more than one device or zone reports a fire, the system will start the evacuation procedure and the fire brigade is automatically called. The announcement can be triggered by the station controller to alert station staff of other incidents which need urgent attention. The automated nature of the announcement and its high priority means that it has occasionally been known to cut into manual (lower priority) announcements being made by station staff.|$|E

40|$|One aspect {{that is very}} {{important}} in learning English is listening. In this case, being a good listener is not always easy. Nowadays, learning English at school is not giving enough time to master English, so that many students decide to join the private course to master their English. Unfortunately, many private courses are not giving the right procedures in teaching English. A great selection of teaching technique and a good preparation of teaching material are something important in teaching learning process. The purposes of this study were; (1) to describe the teaching techniques used by the teacher in listening class at “LPK Medan English and Computer”, (2) to know the teaching materials used in listening class at “LPK Medan English and Computer”, (3) to know how the teaching technique implemented in listening class at “LPK medan English and Computer”. This study used descriptive qualitative research. The research subject was the teacher who taught beginner students in listening class at “LPK Medan English and Computer”. The instruments used to gather the data were observation and interview. The data in this research were collected during the teaching learning processed in the classroom and joining the class in two times meeting to observe the teaching techniques and materials used, and the teaching technique implemented in listening class of the beginner students. The data were also collected by interviewing the teacher related to the teaching techniques and materials used by the teacher in listening class. The result of observation would be described one by one descriptively. Meanwhile, the result of interview would be used to complete the result of observation. A conclusion is drawn based on the observation and interview data. The findings of this study show that there are 8 kinds of teaching techniques used by the teacher in listening class of beginner students. Those are; Identifying Information, Listen and Repeat Activity, Listen for the Mistake, Listening to the Stories, Matching the Pictures and Words, Conversation, Songs, Telling Stories Activity and Games. Then, there are 9 teaching materials used by the teacher. Those are; Conversation from the AudiocassetteTapes, Dialogue about Telephone Costumer Service from the AudiocassetteTapes, Television Program about How to Cook “Fried Egg” from the Compact Disk, News, <b>Public</b> <b>Address</b> <b>Announcement,</b> Story Text, English Song’s Lyrics, Short Fairytales Text, and Vocabulary Games. Meanwhile, in implementing the teaching technique, the teacher usually used three phases in teaching listening, those are; Pre Listening, WhilstListening, and PostListening...|$|E

5000|$|A {{number of}} {{companies}} have been {{making an effort to}} find a better work-life balance for their employees.

Nissan offers telecommuting for office workers {{to make it easier to}} care for children or elderly parents. Dozens of large corporations have also implemented [...] "no overtime days", which require employees to leave the office promptly at 5:30 p.m. However, since their workload is too high, few workers can actually take advantage of this, and opt to stay in the office with the lights off or to simply take their work home, [...] "cloaked overtime" [...] called [...] "furoshiki" [...] (風呂敷) after the Japanese traditional wrapping cloth.|$|R

50|$|The playoff loss {{proved to}} be Quebec's swan song in the NHL as the team's {{financial}} troubles increasingly took center stage, {{even in the face}} of renewed fan support over the previous three years. Quebec City was by far the smallest market in the NHL, and the second-smallest market in North America to host a big-league team (behind only Green Bay, Wisconsin). The league's Canadian teams (with the exception of Montreal, Toronto, and to a lesser extent, Vancouver) found it difficult to compete in a new age of rising player salaries. This made many of the players concerned about their marketability, especially since the Nords always played in the long shadow of the Canadiens. In addition, most players were skittish about playing in what was virtually a unilingual Francophone city. Then as now, there were no privately owned English-language radio stations in the city, and only one privately owned English-language television station. The only English-language newspaper is a weekly. Unlike in Montreal, <b>public</b> <b>address</b> <b>announcements</b> were given only in French.|$|R

50|$|Arguably, the Nordiques {{felt the}} {{difficulties}} {{created by the}} new environment more than the league's other Canadian teams. Quebec City was the smallest market in the NHL, and the second-smallest major-league city in North America. Only Green Bay, Wisconsin; home to the National Football League's Green Bay Packers, was smaller. However, the Nordiques didn't have a nearby major market on which to draw support, as the Packers do with Milwaukee. The Nordiques also faced a unique disadvantage due to Quebec City's status as a virtually monolingual francophone city. Then as now, Quebec City had no privately owned English-language radio stations and only one privately owned English-language television station. The only English-language newspaper was the weekly Quebec Chronicle-Telegraph. The Nordiques organization operated almost entirely in French; <b>public</b> <b>address</b> <b>announcements</b> at home games were only given in French. In contrast, Montreal and Ottawa, the other NHL cities with large francophone fan bases, enjoyed significant anglophone support and had fully bilingual operations. The near-total lack of English-language media limited the Nordiques' marketability even in their best years, and made many non-French players, most notably Lindros, wary of playing for them. While the Nordiques had a fairly loyal fan base, {{it was not enough}} for them to be viable in the new environment.|$|R
5000|$|The {{crowd in}} the Leppings Lane Stand overspilled onto the pitch, where many injured and traumatised fans congregated who had climbed to safety. Football players from both teams were ushered to their {{respective}} dressing rooms, and told {{that there would be}} a 30-minute postponement. Those still trapped in the pens were packed so tightly that many victims died of compressive asphyxia while standing. Meanwhile, on the pitch, police, stewards and members of the St John Ambulance service were overwhelmed. Many uninjured fans assisted the injured; several attempted CPR and others tore down advertising hoardings to use as stretchers. Chief Superintendent John Nesbit of South Yorkshire Police later briefed Michael Shersby MP that leaving the rescue to the fans was a deliberate strategy, and is quoted as saying [...] "We let the fans help so that they would not take out their frustration on the police" [...] at a Police Federation conference. As events unfolded, some police officers were still deployed making a cordon three-quarters of the way down the pitch to prevent Liverpool supporters reaching the opposing supporters. Without <b>public</b> <b>address</b> <b>announcements</b> to explain the situation, many Nottingham Forest fans on the other end were chanting for their team and whistled their anger at what they saw as a pitch invasion, incensing some of the Liverpool supporters.
