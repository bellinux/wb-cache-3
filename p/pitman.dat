5|$|Because of his father's {{success in}} {{business}} and his mother's descent from Hawaiian royalty, the <b>Pitman</b> family was considered quite prosperous and were host to the royal family when they visited Hilo. Besides {{being one of the}} leading merchants in town, his father also served the government as district magistrate of Hilo. Henry's mother, Kinoʻole, had inherited control over much of the lands in Hilo and Ōlaʻa from her own father, and King Kamehameha III had granted her use of the ahupuaʻa of Hilo after her marriage. During Henry's early childhood, the family lived in the mansion that Benjamin <b>Pitman</b> had built in 1840, in an area known as Niopola, one of the favored resort spots of ancient Hawaiian royalty. The residence also became known as the Spencer House after <b>Pitman</b> sold it to his business partner Captain Thomas Spencer. The property later became the site of the Hilo Hotel, built in 1888 and torn down in 1956. In the 1850s the family moved to the capital of Honolulu where Benjamin <b>Pitman</b> took up banking and built a beautiful two-story house that he named Waialeale ("rippling water") at the corner of Alakea and Beretania Streets.|$|E

5|$|Born {{and raised}} in Hilo, Hawaiʻi, he was the eldest son of Kinoʻoleoliliha, a Hawaiian high chiefess, and Benjamin <b>Pitman,</b> an American pioneer settler from Massachusetts. Through his father's {{business}} success in the whaling and sugar and coffee plantation industries and his mother's familial connections to the Hawaiian royal family, the Pitmans were quite prosperous and owned lands {{on the island of}} Hawaiʻi and in Honolulu. He and his older sister Mary were educated in the mission schools in Hilo alongside other children of mixed Hawaiian descent. After the death of his mother in 1855, his father remarried to the widow of a missionary, thus connecting the family to the American missionary community in Hawaiʻi. However, following the deaths of his first wife and later his second wife, his father decided to leave the islands and returned to Massachusetts with his family around 1860. The younger <b>Pitman</b> continued his education in the public schools of Roxbury, where the <b>Pitman</b> family lived for a period of time.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, Todd Ocvirk, Nanette Napoleon, Justin Vance, Anita Manning {{and others}} {{began the process}} of {{creating}} a historical documentary film about the individual experiences and stories of Hawaii-born soldiers and sailors of the Civil War, including <b>Pitman,</b> Samuel C. Armstrong, Nathaniel Bright Emerson, James Wood Bush, J. R. Kealoha and many other unnamed combatants of both the Union and the Confederacy. In 2014, Maui-based author Wayne Moniz wrote a fictionalized story based on the lives and Civil War service of Hawaiian soldiers like Henry Hoʻolulu <b>Pitman</b> in his book Pukoko: A Hawaiian in the American Civil War. In 2015, the sesquicentennial {{of the end of the}} war, the National Park Service released a publication titled Asians and Pacific Islanders and the Civil War about the service of the large number of combatants of Asian and Pacific Islander descent who fought during the war. The history of Hawaiʻi's involvement and the biographies of <b>Pitman,</b> Bush, Kealoha and others were co-written by historians Anita Manning and Justin Vance.|$|E
5|$|<b>Pitman</b> was a hapa-haole, of part Hawaiian {{and part}} Caucasian descent. His father {{was white and}} his {{native-born}} mother was also part Caucasian from her own mother, who {{was the daughter of}} Captain Cox and a Hawaiian chiefess. Despite his mixed-race ancestry, <b>Pitman</b> avoided the racial segregation imposed on other Native Hawaiian volunteers in this period. Most Native Hawaiians who participated in the war were assigned to colored regiments, but Pitman's fair skin color meant he was able to serve in a white unit, indicating that unit assignment may have been influenced by how dark Hawaiians appeared. Historians Bob Dye, James L. Haley and others claimed <b>Pitman</b> was placed in the colored regiments because of his mixed race, but regiment records indicate otherwise.|$|E

5|$|While in Hawaiʻi, <b>Pitman</b> and {{his older}} sister Mary {{attended}} Mrs.Wetmore's children's school in Hilo. The school was located at the Wetmores' residence on Church Street. Taught by Lucy Sheldon Taylor Wetmore, the wife of American missionary doctor and government physician Charles Hinckley Wetmore, {{who had come to}} Hawaii in 1848 with the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (ABCFM), the two elder <b>Pitman</b> children received their education in English rather than Hawaiian. This was unusual since Hawaiian was the official language of the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi, and all other schools in Hilo were conducted in the Hawaiian language. Mrs.Wetmore taught the children reading, writing, spelling, arithmetic and singing, while also reinforcing the curriculum with a strong adherence to the principles of the Protestant faith. Like the <b>Pitman</b> siblings, many of their classmates were also of half-Hawaiian (hapa-kanaka) descent with a majority of them being Chinese-Hawaiians (hapa-pake).|$|E

The {{response}} of the <b>pitmen</b> was sufficiently violent for soldiers from the Newcastle barracks to be called {{to deal with the}} dispute.

5|$|In 1859, {{with the}} new type in hand, the Deseret News began {{printing}} with it.

However, they ultimately decided not to and used the opportunity to re-affirm their commitment to the Deseret alphabet.|$|E

5|$|In July 1877, Young tried {{one more}} time at a {{spelling}} reform, ordering lead type designed for the orthography of Benn <b>Pitman</b> (Isaac's brother) {{with the intention of}} printing an edition of the Book of Mormon and Doctrine and Covenants using it. Most of the type had arrived by August, but with Young's death, the translation was never undertaken and the type never used.
