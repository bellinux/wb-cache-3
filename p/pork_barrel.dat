5|$|In August1998, {{the station}} {{building}} was leased to Amtrak for 99years by the borough of Elizabethtown for $1 per year after ownership {{was transferred to}} the borough; ownership of the platforms and right-of-way was retained by Amtrak. Renovations began in August2009 and were funded by $9.3million from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The station was cited by U.S. Senator Tom Coburn as an example of <b>pork</b> <b>barrel</b> spending in the stimulus bill. Elevators were built and the station's two platforms were raised, per the requirements of Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. The platforms were also lengthened to accommodate longer trains. Canopies were erected over the platforms to provide protection from the elements for waiting passengers. The station building was completely remodeled, including restoration of the original wood furnishings, replacement of broken slate roof tiles, and masonry repointing. The completed station was unveiled in a ribbon-cutting ceremony on May4, 2011.|$|E

40|$|In this study, {{we examine}} {{the extent to which}} legislators receive elec toral {{benefits}} from altering the geographic distribution of federal outlays. Although there are both theoretical and anecdotal reasons to believe in the existence of such benefits, previous empirical work has largely failed to verify the connection between <b>pork</b> <b>barreling</b> and reelection. We ex amine House incumbents during the 1980 s, when budget deficits were allegedly forcing legislators to end the acquisition of distributive benefits, and we discover that legislators did in fact reap electoral benefits from <b>pork</b> <b>barreling</b> in the 1980 s. We further discover that there is a sharp partisan difference in the marginal effects of federal outlays: additional federal monies strongly affect Democratic reelection margins but barely impact the electoral fortunes of Republicans. This conclusion has impor tant implications for current debates about Congress, divided govern ment, and the recent Republican takeover of Congress...|$|R

Blagojevich signed a bill in 2005 that prohibited discrimination based on sexual orientation in employment, housing, public accommodations, and credit. Blagojevich originally campaigned against <b>pork</b> <b>barrel</b> spending, but eventually used it himself to gain more votes for bills.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{political}} economy explanation of bailouts to declining industries. A model of probabilistic voting is developed, {{in which two}} candidates compete for the vote of two groups of the society through tactical redistribution.

This setting is suited to reproduce <b>pork</b> <b>barrels</b> or machine politics and patronage. We use this model to illustrate the case of an economy with both an efficient industry and a declining one, in which workers elect their government.

25|$|Serving three {{different}} tenures as Chairman of the United States Senate Committee on Appropriations enabled Byrd to steer {{a great deal}} of federal money toward projects in West Virginia.

He filibustered against the 1964 Civil Rights Act and supported the Vietnam War, but later renounced racism and segregation, and spoke in opposition to the Iraq War. Renowned for his knowledge of Senate precedent and parliamentary procedure, Byrd wrote a four-volume history of the Senate in later life.|$|E
25|$|Gingrich is an {{advocate}} of space exploration technology, and has stated that the United States should place more emphasis on realizing landmark achievements in space exploration. He has been a vocal critic of NASA, which he has described as too bureaucratic, inefficient, and {{no longer able to}} foster ambitious projects such as the 1969 moon landing. He has cited the building of the International Space Station {{as an example of a}} program that developed too slowly and was too expensive and the Space Launch System as a <b>pork</b> <b>barrel</b> project. Gingrich advocates greater reliance on the private sector and recommends incentivizing innovation through tax credits and by allocating 10 percent of the Nasa budget for prizes. He also supports initiating federally regulated commercial launch services. According to Gingrich, these changes would allow NASA to focus on advanced technological development and exploratory research. Gingrich's vision for the future of American space programs includes further solar system exploration, space travel for consumers and a sustained civilization beyond earth. He got the nickname of Newt Skywalker for his ideas.|$|E

Simultaneously, the state legislature in collaboration with the U. S. Congress worked towards a more inclusive incentive package, the Gulf Opportunity Zone. Analysis found in this paper gives increased evidence of communication bottlenecks in federal government, and how decision making principles during a time of crisis are unfortunately overlooked.
