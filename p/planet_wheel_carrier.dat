Since real-time models are necessary for the vehicle dynamic simulation in HiL various techniques have been developed {{in the recent years}} to fasten the time integration of multibody system models.

The so-called virtual axle is one of these approaches. It is based on tabulated kinematics of a <b>wheel</b> <b>carrier</b> that is evaluated during time integration.

40|$|In this paper, a {{theoretical}} and experimental investigation on an innovative cycloidal speed reducer is presented. The typical cycloid drive has a <b>planet</b> <b>wheel,</b> {{the profile of}} which is the internal offset of an epitrochoid meshing with cylindrical rollers connected to the case. This reducer, on the contrary, has an external ring gear, the transverse profile {{of which is the}} external offset of an epitrochoid and engages with the <b>planet</b> <b>wheel</b> by means of cylindrical rollers. This paper investigates the structural characteristics and the kinematic principles of this type of reducer. A theoretical approach based on the theory of gearing (following Litvin’s approach) is developed and compared to a development of Blanche and Yang’s approach. Furthermore, a simplified procedure to calculate the force distribution on cycloid drive elements, its power losses, and theoretical mechanical efficiency is presented. The effects of design parameters on the values of forces are studied for an optimal design of this type of reducer. The theoretical model is tuned {{on the basis of the}} results of tests made on purpose. The mechanical efficiency dependency on speed and torque is described. The main aim of this work is to tune {{a theoretical}} model in order to predict the operating behavior of the cycloid drive and to improve its design procedure...|$|R
