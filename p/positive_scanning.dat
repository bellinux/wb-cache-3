40|$|Pt hollow nanospheres with a {{particle}} diameter of 110 nm and a shell thickness of about 5 nm were synthesized in bulk using selenium colloids with {{a particle}} diameter of 100 nm as a template. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high resolution {{transmission electron microscopy}} (HR-TEM), {{selected area electron diffraction}} (SAED), X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive X-ray spectrocopy (EDX), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to determine their morphologies and structures. The electrocatalytic activity of the Pt hollow nanospheres modifying glassy carbon electrode toward methanol oxidation was measured by using methanol as the probe molecule. We show that the multiporous Pt hollow nanospheres composited of atomic clusters have a uniform particle size, good dispersity, a stable structure, a big surface area and good mass transfer performance. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) showed that when the current density of methanol oxidation was 0. 10 mA. cm(- 2) and upon <b>positive</b> <b>scanning</b> the methanol oxidation potential of the Pt hollow nanospheres was around 110 and 64 mV negative than that of the Pt solid nanoparticles and Pt black, respectively. Upon negative scanning the former species was about 51 and 13 mV negative than that of the latter two species, respectively. After 800 segments cyclic voltammetry scanning, upon <b>positive</b> <b>scanning</b> the peak current density of methanol oxidation on the Pt hollow nanospheres was found to be 13 and 15 times as high as that of the Pt solid nanoparticles and Pt black, respectively. Upon negative scanning the former species was about 19 and 38 times as high as that of the two latter species. Our experimental results show that the Pt hollow nanospheres have good electrocatalytic activity and stability toward methanol oxidation.

40|$|The role of redox {{mediators}} {{obtained from}} Pt, Au, and Pt/Au electrodes {{in the process}} of electro-catalytic oxidation of aromatic/aliphatic hydroxyl derivatives in an alkaline medium has been studied by applying cyclic voltammetry. Phenol and glycerol were used as aromatic and aliphatic hydroxyl derivatives in the electrochemical oxidation experiments. The results revealed that the presence of redox mediators formed by preliminary electrode anodization is crucial for the process of oxidation of aro-matic compounds and imposes a dierent oxidation route for the aliphatic hydroxyl derivatives. The eect of preanodization has been related to the formation and dissolution of the corresponding higher hydrous oxides which accounts for the presence of Mn+ in the solution. On subsequent <b>positive</b> <b>scanning</b> M (n−x) +-species are formed on the electrode surface thus increasing the active sites number.

It was shown that the inhibitive mechanisms of the complex of BTA and Na 2 WO 4 for copper corrosion have the same photoelectrochemical property as BTA and Na 2 WO 4. The photocurrent type transforming from p - type to n - type {{was due to the}} action of BTA with the potential <b>positive</b> <b>scanning.</b> However, the cathodic photocurrent value increasing evidently was due to the action of Na 2 WO 4 with the potential negative scanning.

The results of SERS showed that both BTA and Na 2 WO 4 play a role of inhibitive effect for copper corrosion. The action of Na 2 WO 4 on copper is that it could produce a protective oxides film with copper on its surface, However for BTA, it could form Cu(I) BTA polymer films on the surface of copper in order to diffusing on the surface. Because of the increasing of copper oxide, the Cu(I) BTA polymer films could make the film more density, therefore the inhibitive effects of the inhibitor increased significantly...|$|E

We retrospectively analysed 429 bone scans of 281 patients with CRPC, with no known previous metastases, treated at three Veterans Affairs Medical Centers. We assessed the predictors of a <b>positive</b> <b>scan</b> using generalized estimating equations. Area under the curve (AUC), calibration plots and decision-curve analysis were used to assess the performance of our previous model to predict a <b>positive</b> <b>scan</b> in the current data. A total of 113 scans (26 %) were positive. On multivariable analysis, the only significant predictors of a <b>positive</b> <b>scan</b> were log-transformed prostate-specific antigen (PSA) : hazard ratio (HR) 2. 13; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 71 - 2. 66 (P < 0. 001) and log-transformed PSA doubling time (PSADT) : HR 0. 53; 95 % CI 0. 41 - 0. 68 (P < 0. 001).

There is still relatively little known about this technique of demonstrating cerebral infarction secondary to cerebrovascular disease. The early reports of <b>positive</b> brain <b>scans</b> with cerebrovascular accidents were quite variable. Brinkman, et a! (1) found no <b>positive</b> brain <b>scans</b> in eight patients with a diagnosis of cerebrovascular accident.

DESIGN: Retrospective study. SETTING: Vascular laboratory in a university teaching hospital. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The results of 345 lower extremity duplex venous scans performed between August 1994 and November 1998 were reviewed. All patients were in-patients referred from different specialties due to clinical suspicion of lower extremity deep vein thrombosis. <b>Positive</b> duplex <b>scans</b> were correlated with patients' demographic data (sex, age), medical history (history of malignancy, deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism) and clinical features (leg swelling, venous insufficiency, calf pain, and leg ulcer). Univariate analysis was performed using the Chi squared test. RESULTS: A total of 345 scans were performed for 313 patients. The mean age was 55 years (range, 19 - 92 years). Sixty-three patients (49 male, 14 female) had a <b>positive</b> <b>scan,</b> giving a yield of 18. 3 %.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: A {{number of}} {{neoplasms}} {{are known to}} express somatostatin receptors; the use of somatostatin receptor imaging in their localization has recently been described, but the resolution and discrimination of the isotopes used remains sub-optimal. We {{have looked at the}} use of a new 111 In-labelled analogue of somatostatin, pentatreotide, in the visualization and functional characterization of a number of neoplastic conditions. PATIENTS: Thirteen patients with proven neoplasms were scanned using this agent. Planar and single-photon-emission computerized tomographic (SPECT) images of the relevant part of the body were obtained using a gamma-camera at 10 minutes and 4 and 21 hours after injection of the radiopharmaceutical. In six patients (three carcinoid, three insulinomas) scanning was also performed using 123 I-Tyr- 3 -octreotide. RESULTS: Primary tumours or metastases were visualized in six of the seven patients with neuroendocrine tumours, and three of six patients with insulinoma. One patient with an insulinoma who had a <b>positive</b> <b>scan</b> showed absent uptake when rescanned after tumour removal. A rise in blood glucose (more than twice basal) in response to octreotide was seen only in those insulinoma patients with <b>positive</b> <b>scans.</b> In cases where both 111 In-pentratreotide and 123 I-Tyr- 3 -octreotide scans were performed, both radiopharmaceuticals identified the same 4 / 6 tumours; however, tumour definition (reflecting high tumour to background ratio) was better with pentatreotide on the 21 -hour images with minimum biliary and gut activity, allowing better resolution of the tumour image. CONCLUSION: It appears that 111 In-pentatreotide scintigraphy is a rapid and safe procedure for the visualization of neuroendocrine tumours possessing somatostatin binding sites. A <b>positive</b> <b>scan</b> may be predictive of neuroendocrine responsiveness to octreotide therapy. In addition, it also appears that 111 In-pentatreotide has superior kinetics compared to 123 I-Tyr- 3 -octreotide, typically achieving more satisfactory tumour to background ratios, and may thus be more useful in the localization of endocrine tumours...|$|R
40|$|The {{system of}} I-octanol-beta-cyclodextrin in 0. 5 M HClO 4 at Pt {{electrodeposited}} on an Au/quartz crystal (Pt/Au/Q) {{has been studied}} by cyclic voltammetry (CV), the electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) and impedance measurements. beta-Cyclodextrin (beta-CD), a cyclic oligomer of seven alpha-D-glucopyranose units, was chosen for this study because it forms an inclusion complex with primary alcohols and because of its hydrophilic exterior. Previous cycling in I-octanol profoundly affected ("aged") the electrodeposited Pt, as is readily seen in subsequent CVs and mass curves in 0. 5 M HClO 4. Since adsorbed I-octanol and beta-CD would tend to render the Pt surface hydrophobic and hydrophilic, respectively, these opposite tendencies should be detectable by the EQCM. Effectively, in a <b>positive</b> potential <b>scan,</b> 1 -octanol and beta-CD added at - 0. 22 V produced a mass decrease and increase, respectively, of aged Pt/Au/Q. owing to a decrease and increase {{of the amount of}} adsorbed water and/or ions, which was attributed to physisorption of these compounds. With freshly deposited Pt/Au/Q, I-octanol added at open circuit produced a mass decrease over the whole potential cycle, again evidence of adsorption of a hydrophobic compound. The potential at which the aged Pt/Au/Q electrode immersed in an 1 -octanol solution was held while beta-CD was added to the electrolyte crucially affected the subsequent voltammogram and mass Curve. If beta-CD and I-octanol were added together at - 0. 22 V, the current in a subsequent <b>positive</b> <b>scan</b> was the same as in I-octanol added at - 0. 22 V, but the mass was higher, both at - 0. 22 V and over the whole <b>positive</b> <b>scan.</b> This mass increase was probably due to physisorption (since the current was unaffected.) of the inclusion complex, since beta-CD alone did not affect the mass at - 0. 22 V. On the contrary, if beta-CD was added at open circuit to an electrolyte already containing I-octanol, also added at open circuit, both the H desorption and Pt oxidation currents were lower than in I-octanol. indicating a strong interaction of beta-CD with the Pt Surface, and the mass was also lower over most of the <b>positive</b> <b>scan.</b> Most probably this strong interaction of beta-CD involves adsorbed residues formed in the dissociative chemisorption of I-octanol at open circuit...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} value of the {{diagnostic}} whole body 131 I scan after thyroidectomy and 131 I ablation. Design: Retrospective analysis of all patients with differentiated thyroid cancer treated in one centre between 1990 and 2000. Results: A total of 153 consecutive patients who underwent diagnostic scanning following ablative therapy were identified. This diagnostic <b>scan</b> was <b>positive</b> in 20 patients (13 %) and faintly positive in 16 patients (11 %). The majority (117 patients) had negative scans. Of the 20 patients with <b>positive</b> <b>scans,</b> four received no further treatment, nine showed no abnormal uptake following a second ablative 131 I dose and seven had uptake in the thyroid bed (six) or in neck nodes (one) after repeat ablation. Outcome: In the group with <b>positive</b> <b>scans,</b> the four patients who received no further treatment and the nine with a negative second ablation scan remained disease free during follow-up. No patient with a <b>positive</b> diagnostic <b>scan</b> received additional 131 I therapy which would not otherwise have been given based on the clinical findings, serum thyroglobulin (Tg) values or the presence of anti-Tg antibodies. Ten of the patients with negative scans developed recurrent disease which was always detected clini-cally or by a rising serum Tg value. Conclusions: Diagnostic whole body 131 I scans add little extra information and in our experience do not influence patient management. They should be reserved for patients in whom serum Tg levels are unreliable {{because of the presence of}} antibodies or when there is clinical suspicion of tumour.

40|$|Purpose: Technetium 99 m (99 m Tc) labeled scan {{is often}} done to {{localize}} bleeding to facilitate treatment. No level 1 or 2 data supports this approach. The {{aim of this}} study was to determine the correlation between site of bleeding by nuclear scan and findings at surgery, angiogram or colonoscopy. Methods: Records of patients admitted to Cooper University Hospital from January 2001 -December 2005 with LGIB who had 99 mTc scan were analyzed. Results: 164 of 170 patients were eligible to be evaluated. There were 45 positive (27. 5 %) and 119 negative scans (72. 5 %). 21 of 45 patients with <b>positive</b> <b>scans</b> had angiography. 7 patients (33. 3 %) had positive and 14 (66. 6 %) negative angiograms. In 6 patients (85. 7 %) with (+) angiograms, there was correlation on the area of bleed as seen on the 99 m Tc scan (p = 0. 125). 20 patients, in the <b>positive</b> <b>scan</b> group, required surgery. In 15 (75 %) the findings at surgery correlated with the scan result (p = 0. 04). 31 patients (68. 8 %) with <b>positive</b> <b>scan</b> had colonoscopy. There was correlation in 27 patients (87. 0 %) (p < 0. 001). The patients with (+) scan received a total of 372 (8. 2 per patient) transfusions of packed red blood cells (PRBC) compared to 333 (2. 7 per patients) transfusions in patients with (–) scans. Surgeons documented in 7 patients that the result of scan influenced surgery. Patients with (+) and (–) scans had similar rates of colonoscopy (73. 35 % vs 76. 4 %), hospital length of stay (14. 3 vs 12. 10 days), while mortality rate was (8. 8 % vs 6. 72 %) respectively, Conclusion: 99 m Tc scan has low yield in the evaluation of LGIB. However when positive, they tend to correlate with findings at angiogram, surgery and colonoscopy...|$|R
