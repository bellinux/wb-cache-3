5000|$|Quipus are now {{preserved}} using {{techniques that}} will minimise their future degradation. Museums, archives and special collections have adopted preservation guidelines from textile practices. Quipus {{are made of}} fibers, either spun and <b>plied</b> <b>thread</b> such as wool or hair from alpaca, llama, guanaco or vicuña, though are also commonly made of cellulose like cotton. The knotted strings of quipus were often made with an [...] "elaborate system of knotted cords, dyed in various colors, the significance of which was known to the magistrates". Fading of color, natural or dyed, cannot be reversed, and may indicate further damage to the fibers. Colors can darken if attacked by dust or by certain dyes and mordants. Quipus have been found with adornments, such as animal shells, attached to the cords, and these non-textile materials may require additional preservation measures.|$|E
5000|$|Quipus, {{also known}} as khipos or talking knots, were {{recording}} devices historically used {{in a number of}} cultures and particularly in the region of Andean South America. Similar systems were used by the ancient Chinese and native Hawaiians, though this article specifically deals with the most familiar Inca system, and knotted string records are often generically referred to in English as quipus after the Inca term. A quipu usually consisted of colored, spun, and <b>plied</b> <b>thread</b> or strings made from cotton or camelid fiber. For the Inca, the system aided in collecting data and keeping records, ranging from monitoring tax obligations, properly collecting census records, calendrical information, and military organization. The cords contained numeric and other values encoded by knots in a base ten positional system. A quipu could have only a few or up to 2,000 cords. The configuration of the quipus have also been [...] "compared to string mops." [...] Archaeological evidence has also shown a use of finely carved wood as a supplemental, and perhaps more sturdy, base on which the color-coordinated cords would be attached. A relatively small number have survived.|$|E
40|$|Small {{fragment}} of woven wool fabric with linen decoration. The warp {{and part of}} the weft are yellowed wool. Natural linen and brown/black wool are used for weft in a tapestry area. The fragment starts with a 2. 2 cm wide area of plain weave with beige weft. The tapestry design consists of a crested wave pattern 0. 4 cm {{from the top of the}} brown/black weft. There is a small amount of brown/black weft within the wave elements. 0. 5 cm below the waves there is a section of two thin lines of linen followed by approximately 2. 5 cm of linen dashes and then another thin line of linen. This section of lines and dashes is discontinuous. 0. 2 cm below there is a thicker band of linen woven of six picks. This band is discontinuous. There is a small slit between the linen weft and the brown/black weft. Below that the fragment is very deteriorated but there is another area of linen weft. At one corner, the brown/black wefts go around what is left of the warp indicating that this was the edge of the tapestry section. There are also small bits of a very shiny <b>plied</b> <b>thread,</b> mainly around the edges of the fragment. Could be modern.; Dirty and very worn. There are a few small interior holes and a tear that damages part of the linen wave pattern. Some edge fraying...|$|E

5000|$|Antique satin was {{developed}} in the 1950s by combining acetate (warp threads) and rayon (weft threads) mainly as a decorative fabric used primarily for draperies. Unlike wedding satin with the shiny weave visible, antique satin is made of small slubs or textures on the face. The yarn most popular was known as 19/2 <b>ply,</b> meaning 19 <b>threads</b> to the inch woven as a two <b>ply</b> <b>thread</b> to create an attractive silk-like appearance. The popular, quality style is 48" [...] wide and first appeared in limited colors. In the late 1950s a company named Penco Fabrics, owned by Jack Penzer, and based at the drapery building, 261 Fifth Avenue, NY, NY, introduced antique satin in 101 colors, virtually revolutionizing the industry. The fabric was copied by others including Fame Fabrics and Richloom, a major supplier today, and by 1963 achieved major distribution throughout the United States. Selling at the mill level for $.59 to $.79 a yard, whether in the natural off-white, undyed, fabric to black and colored warp yards with an iridescent effect at the higher price points, the fabric in its basic form remains somewhat popular today.|$|R

40|$|The Maori cloak After the {{settlement}} of New Zealand in about 1200 AD, Maori women adapted wefttwining techniques for constructing wann clothing suited to the cooler climate of their new habitat. The principal garment was the cloak made with yarns prepared by working and twisting the long fibres extracted from the sword-like leaves of the indigenous plant Phormium tenax, commonly known as New Zealand flax. The historical evolution of the Maori cloak is largely unknown as only a few fragments and one cloak found in a burial cave {{are known to be}} earlier than the cloaks collected by Captain James Cook on his expeditions in the 1770 s. Those cloaks together with contemporary illustrations and written descriptions from Cook 2 ̆ 7 s and other early voyages of exploration by the English and French indicate that cloak making was highly developed by the 18 th century. Many fine examples collected before 1800 are preserved in British and European museums. All cloaks, whether the coarsely constructed rain cloaks with a thatch-like outer surface, the closely constructed cloaks with added strips of dog skin, or the more pliable finely made and shaped cloaks decorated with tassels and feathers or finely-patterned borders, are made by weft twining. Roughly rectangular, they vary in length from approximately 70 to 150 cm and in width from 100 to 200 cm. The body of the cloak is called the kaupapa. Most cloaks are simply finished on the edges with a thicker <b>plied</b> <b>thread,</b> narrow plaits or a fringe, but prestige cloaks with densely constructed patterned borders of taniko are called kaitaka...|$|E
5000|$|The {{quality of}} bed sheets is often {{conveyed}} by the thread count—the {{number of threads}} per square inch of material. In general, the higher the thread count, the softer the sheet, but the weave and type of thread may affect the [...] "hand" [...] of the material so that a sheet with a lower thread count may actually be softer than one with a higher count. Yarn quality also plays {{a part in the}} look and feel of sheets, as finer yarns tend to create a finer sheet fabric. The ply also plays a role in how heavy the sheet feels. Ply represents how many fibers are twisted together as the sheet is being created. A 2 <b>ply</b> 300 <b>thread</b> count sheet will feel heavier than a single <b>ply</b> 600 <b>thread</b> count sheet. [...] The most common constructions are muslin, percale, sateen, flannel, and knitted jersey. In a plain weave the warp and weft cross each other one at a time, and sateen, has multiple threads (usually three or four) over, and one under.|$|R
