While the UK Foreign Office claimed {{that it was}} an environmental move as well as a necessary move to improve the coral populations off east Africa and therefore sub-saharan marine supplies, some Chagossians claimed that the reserve would prevent any resettlement due to the inability to fish in protected areas. The Chagossian UK-based Diego Garcian Society stated that it welcomed the marine reserve, noting that it was in the interest of Chagossians to have the area protected while they were exiled and that it could be renegotiated upon resettlement.

The Court noted the clear intentions in the transitional provisions that the substitution of a right of appeal to the CCJ {{in place of the}} previous right of appeal to the JCPC, should apply to <b>pending</b> <b>proceedings</b> except in the circumstances spelt out in the provisions themselves. Similar to the JCPC, and based on the provisions which allow for special leave to appeal to the CCJ directly as of right in certain limited instances, the Court established that it will grant special leave to appeal if there is an egregious error of law, a substantial miscarriage of justice or real risk that a serious miscarriage of justice will result if the appeal is not fully and finally ventilated before the Court. Sir Henry de B. Forde Q.C., Mr. Hal Gollop and Mr. C. Anthony Audain for the Applicant. Mr. Clement E. Lashley Q.C., Mr. David J.H. Thompson, Ms. Onika E.

40|$|Mandatory {{order and}} its limits in the Italian {{judicial}} review proceedings Since 2010 mandatory orders are available {{in front of the}} Italian Administrative Courts. Scholars had been urged the introduction of this remedy for decades, but now its practical functioning presents several problems, concerning not only the legal limits to its admissibility, but also the rationale behind certain strictly procedural rules: especially, the application for a mandatory order must be made asking together a quashing order or a declaratory judgment (declaring a public body’s failure to act unlawful). The paper examines those issues and reasons about two fundamental questions: first, the difference between mandatory orders and mandatory effects of quashing orders; secondly, the identification of a balanced framework of procedural rules concerning events occurred <b>pending</b> <b>proceedings...</b>|$|E
40|$|In the three-pillared system {{established}} by Regulation 1 / 2003, {{and particularly in}} the decentralized enforcement environment that this parallel system corresponds to, the need for uniformity arises not only as far as the national level (NJs and NCAs v. the Commission is concerned), but also within the national level itself. This essay aims at exploring the possible solutions, based on European Union law, to the potential shortcomings regarding coherence arising at this level. A prominent feature is Article 9 of the Directive on damages actions, which establishes that a final decision of a NCA or a review court should be binding in subsequent actions for damages brought before their national courts. This provision is assessed {{in the context of the}} principles of European Union law relevant for the co-ordination between NJs and NCAs. Second, the only direct communication tool between NJs and NCAs set out in regulation 1 / 2003, i. e., Article 15 (3), is examined closely. On the basis of this two-phased analysis, the actions that NJs should take <b>pending</b> <b>proceedings</b> before an NCA or in case of a previous decision of the NCA on the same or on related anti-competitive behaviour falling within the scope of Article 101 or Article 102 TFEU, and vice versa, are sketched out and discussed...|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} Gina Rinehart’s numerous attempts to suppress information and stay proceedings in the extraordinary litigation in the Rinehart family trust dispute. The Rinehart litigation, while only at its pre-trial stage, has delivered significant judgments {{on the new}} legislative powers to depart from the principle of open justice and the law relating to stays of proceedings (stays of a substantive claim and stays pending {{an appeal to the}} High Court). The new legislation is the Court Suppression and Non-publication Orders Act 2010 (NSW), which has national significance as it is the model statute that aims to be implemented in all Australian jurisdictions and is a Federal Bill. The Rinehart litigation proves that the principle of open justice continues to be fundamental under the model statute and that the media has an important role in ensuring its protection. Possible future questions under the statute could be about the meaning of ‘suppression’ and the operational differences in seeking review under the Federal and NSW model. The Rinehart litigation is significant as it has redefined the test for seeking a stay of orders <b>pending</b> <b>proceedings</b> in the High Court. It has also considered whether a claim can be stayed due to an agreement to use alternative dispute resolution mechanisms. Further, it signals that future legal developments may occur on the issue of whether trustee disputes are arbitrable. 19 page(s...|$|E
