40|$|The {{effect of}} ethanol and {{glycerol}} concentration on the body, sweetness, acidity, {{aroma and flavour}} intensity, and perceived viscosity and hotness of three Riesling wines was assessed. The ethanol and glycerol contents of the wines were adjusted by addition to give three realistic levels (5. 2, 7. 2, 10. 2 g/L glycerol and 11. 6, 12. 6 and 13. 6 v/v ethanol). The nine treatment combinations (3 glycerol × 3 ethanol) were rated on the above attributes by a <b>panel</b> <b>of</b> trained <b>tasters.</b> Increased alcohol levels resulted in increased perceived hotness in all wines, and in higher body and perceived viscosity {{in two of the}} three wines. The effect of increasing glycerol content was less consistent with only one of each of the three wines showing increased viscosity and body. However, the mean viscosity ratings given to wines with 10 g/L glycerol was higher than at 5 g/L at all alcohol levels and for all wines, suggesting that differences in glycerol concentration typically displayed between dry white table wines can affect their perceived viscosity. Neither alcohol nor glycerol consistently affected sweetness, acidity, aroma or flavour intensity. Higher ratings of the abstract term 'body' were most commonly associated with higher ratings of flavour and/or perceived viscosity, suggesting that for the majority <b>of</b> <b>tasters,</b> these two attributes contributed to their interpretation of the term 'body'.

25|$|There is a {{long history}} of using {{artificial}} means to try to accelerate the natural aging process. In Ancient Rome a smoke chamber known as a fumarium was used to enhance the flavor of wine through artificial aging. Amphorae were placed in the chamber, which was built on top of a heated hearth, in order to impart a smoky flavor in the wine that also seemed to sharpen the acidity. The wine would sometimes come out of the fumarium with a paler color just like aged wine. Modern winemaking techniques like micro-oxygenation can have the side effect of artificially aging the wine. In the production of Madeira and rancio wines, the wines are deliberately exposed to excessive temperatures to accelerate the maturation of the wine. Other techniques used to artificially age wine (with inconclusive results on their effectiveness) include shaking the wine, exposing it to radiation, magnetism or ultra-sonic waves. More recently, experiments with artificial aging through high-voltage electricity have produced results above the remaining techniques, as assessed by a <b>panel</b> <b>of</b> wine <b>tasters.</b>|$|R

The novel technology is based on the thermal generation of flavours (non-enzymatic browning) using a closed-batch reactor that is able to hold six bars of overpressures, speeding up the aromatic reactions, and the use of enzymes to increase the flavours precursors. Pilot scale experiments were carried using sugars, cocoa powder and water in various ratios and were submitted to temperatures from 70 °C to 130 °C during various reaction times (1 to 10 hours) reaching over pressures from 0. 2 to 3. 5 bars.

All samples were analysed for their total bacterial count, proteolytic activity, ammonia, total volatile acids, trimethylamine oxide, tri- and dimethylamine and formaldehyde.

In non-irradiated fillets trimethylamine oxide was mainly reduced to trimethylamine and in irradiated fillets to dimethylamine and formaldehyde. A split dose of 50 + 50 krad may have a favourable effect on the total bacterial number, but the analyses of proteolytic activity, the volatile acids and the trimethylamine indicated that a higher proportion of spoilage bacteria survive.

RESULTS: The HPS (high levels of polysaccharides) yeast strain released higher amounts of polysaccharides (429 g L− 1) than EC 1118 (390 g L− 1) during alcoholic fermentation, but the concentration equalized during the aging period (424 and 417 g L− 1 respectively). All aging techniques increased the polysaccharide concentration, but the increase was dependent on the technique applied. A higher liberation of polysaccharides reduced the concentration {{of most of the}} phenolic families analyzed. Moreover, no clear effect of the different aging techniques used in this study on color stabilization was found. The HPS wines were better valued than the EC 1118 wines by the <b>panel</b> <b>of</b> <b>tasters</b> after alcoholic fermentation.

The training of tastes and sensations of the mouth was performed in relation to the acidity, sweetness, bitterness and astringency. Next, the tasters were segmented according to vinotype, sensitivity to PROP (6 -n-propylthiouracil) and saliva flow. This panel was used to determine the detection and recognition thresholds of tartaric, malic and lactic acids in white wine with 4. 2 g / L of total acidity. The detection and recognition thresholds were 1. 05 g/L and 1. 32 g/L for tartaric acid, 0. 85 g/L and 1. 06 g/L for malic acid and 1. 12 g/L and 1. 30 g/L for lactic acid, respectively. These acids were added to an Arinto wine at concentrations 1. 5 times higher than the recognition threshold, obtaining responses regarding the flavor effect considering intensity, persistence, salinity and appreciation. There were no differences (p< 0. 05) in relation to the first 3 parameters, while the appreciation was higher in relation to lactic and malic acids. The statistical treatment of the responses according to the segmentation revealed relationships (p< 0. 05) between saliva flow and sensitivity to PROP, and between saliva flow and the tartaric acid recognition threshold. The acidity appreciation was higher in men than in women. The results obtained can be used by the wine industry in the sense of adapting the white wines to the preference of the consumers, taking into account the recent trend towards the consumption of cold climate wines.

In {{the context of a}} GI, sensory evaluation of typical characteristics of a food requires the development of a <b>panel</b> <b>of</b> <b>tasters</b> with jurisdiction to decide whether a product candidate is accepted as typical. The typical salami of Colonia Caroya is clearly different from other similar salamis, although not all production of the colony is considered typical. In the project of construction of a geographical indication for the typical salami of Colonia Caroya it was necessary to establish the sensory profile of the typical salami and differentiate it from other similar, produced both in Colonia Caroya and outside the territory. This led to generate sensory evaluation activities in which both processors and local inhabitants were involved. Workshops of sensory evaluation in which commercial salamis were evaluated allowed, on the one hand, to identify the key attributes that define the sensory profile of the typical salami, and secondly, to qualify the sampled commercial salamis. It was found that only six companies produce typical products stably and that maturation in basements confers defining sensory characteristics of the tipicity of Salami of Caroya. A "panel of notables" who will be responsible for assessing the tipicity of proposed products to be differentiated by IG was also developed. Thus, sensory panels to evaluate tipicity constituted a scope of learning, exchange and revitalizing of the collective action around the development of the IG of Salami of Caroya...|$|E

The versatility of this approach allows applying it in several design fields starting from the most "traditional" to the most innovative ones. Right the world of food, its packaging and the consumption phase represent an interesting testing ground, starting from the studies that relate food with sound perception. Finally, designers dealing with sounding objects, packaging and, eventually, food have now available a new instrument to create new sounds or to evaluate the existing ones: thanks to SounBe® tool {{they will be able to}} gather some useful meta-project advices related to their needs. A new conscious approach to sounding objects will generate new designed soundscapes, avoiding the increasing of noise pollution and poor sounding object...|$|E
40|$|In Portugal a {{very popular}} desert {{consists}} in whey cheese with pumpkin jam. However, these two products are only sold separately, being necessary to join them together so as to obtain the desired product. Having {{in mind that the}} production of a combination of these two products would be a potentially interesting field for new food commercializing, studies were conducted on the development of this new food product. This, was complemented with a sensorial evaluation, so as to perceive how consumers accepted this new product, and with a consumer study, in order to understand how the consumers would react when faced with the offer of such a new product. The sensorial evaluation was performed by means of a descriptive analysis, with a <b>panel</b> <b>of</b> 17 <b>tasters,</b> <b>of</b> which 12 were women and 5 men. The parameters evaluated using five points hedonic scales were: homogeneity in colour, homogeneity of the product, milk aroma, intensity of aroma, intensity of taste, salty taste, milk taste, sweetness, consistency, granules. The consumer study was performed by applying questionnaires to 100 persons, of which 57 were women and 43 were men. With respect to the results obtained, the sensory analysis to the product developed showed a good global appreciation, indicating that this product could be successful. Regarding it’s acceptability by consumers, the preliminary results are encouraging, since the major part of the enquired liked the combination of whey cheese with pumpkin jam...|$|R
40|$|Young white wines, of the Albariño variety, from {{different}} areas of Denomination of Origin Rías Baixas in Galicia (northwest Spain) were evaluated using sensory descriptive analyses by a <b>panel</b> <b>of</b> professional wine <b>tasters.</b> In {{the first phase of}} analysis, the wine tasters identified 37 aromatic descriptors in five sessions. The descriptors were then reduced to 17 using statistical methods. In the second phase, the wine tasters identified and rated the intensity of these descriptors for each wine evaluated. Characteristic aromatic descriptors were found in Albariño wines from each particular area. Seven sensory attributes were significantly different (p < 0. 05) between the wines (Ripe Fruit, Lactic, Pineapple, Banana, Pear, Citrus fruit and Floral). Principal component analysis of the sensory data permitted differentiation between Albarino wines {{from different}} geographic areas in Rías Baixas. Copyright © 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

40|$|Fresh {{sea squirt}} meat {{requires}} a modified processing and preservation process {{because it has}} a short shelf life due to its high mois-ture content and strong proteolytic enzyme activity. In this study, bottled sea squirt meat prepared in vegetable oil (BSMO) to enhance the consumer acceptability was exposed to γ-ray (Co 60, 10 kGy/h) irradiation to extend the shelf life without the use of a heating process. Response surface methodology was used to determine the optimal mixing ratio of BSMO containing 5 % dehy-drated fresh meat. Texture analysis and nutritional evaluation were also performed on a control and BSMO samples. The volatile basic nitrogen (VBN) content and total cell count were measured to determine the shelf life of irradiated BSMO products during chilled storage at 4 °C for 60 days. According to a <b>panel</b> <b>of</b> 10 trained <b>tasters</b> (aged 20 - 29 years), the optimal mixing formulation was 80 g meat in 60 mL of mixed vegetable oil (30 mL of olive oil and 30 mL of sesame oil). The highest rated formulation, accord-ing to a <b>panel</b> <b>of</b> nine trained <b>tasters</b> (aged ≥ 30 years), was 80 g meat in 60 mL of mixed vegetable oil (42 mL of olive oil and 18 mL of sesame oil). Moisture, ash, and protein contents in BSMO did not change significantly (P < 0. 05) compared with the control. A higher lipid content (0. 84 ± 0. 23 to 2. 13 ± 0. 61; P < 0. 05) was observed due to the presence of vegetable oil on the surface of BSMO. The vegetable oil raised the hardness, springiness, cohesiveness, gumminess, chewiness, and resilience of BSMO. BSMO products remained edible after 50 days of storage at 4 °C based on the VBN content (BSMO 1 : 27. 92 ± 0. 96 mg/ 100 g, BSMO 2 : 24. 84 ± 1. 95 mg/ 100 g) and total cell count (BSMO 1 : 4. 60 ± 0. 80 log CFU/mL, BSMO 2 : 3. 65 ± 0. 20 log CFU/mL) when com...|$|R
