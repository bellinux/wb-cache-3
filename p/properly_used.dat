5|$|Many doctors {{considered}} {{the case to}} be unusual and debated the cause of death. Some, including family members, accused them of criminal negligence; that Shepard was fed well before the operation, which could have allowed him to choke on vomit. No autopsy was made, but an inquest {{was made by the}} coroner. The two doctors to perform the operation made a statement on March 28, 1893 that after prior examinations no diseases were found and his heart and lungs seemed healthy. A Tribune reporter met doctor William J. Morton, son of possible ether discoverer William T. G. Morton who had first used it in 1846. Morton said it was most improbable Shepard died of ether, ensuring its safety when <b>properly</b> <b>used,</b> and that deaths were one in 25,000. He recommended an autopsy.|$|E
5|$|Varian {{was one of}} a {{very few}} experts in the 21st century who was still {{teaching}} about vaquero equipment, methods, and history. She had a strong interest {{in the history of the}} spade bit horse in California. The spade is an elaborate, complex bit that can only be <b>properly</b> <b>used</b> on a highly trained horse handled by a skilled rider. In the vaquero tradition, its use represents the highest level of trust and communication between horse and rider. The process of training the spade bit horse takes five to seven years to complete. Its emphasis has always been on producing a finely tuned working horse and partner, emphasizing quality rather than on how quickly the goal is reached. The conformation of the horse is also a factor; to become a spade bit horse, the animal must be bred to have a higher neck set and well-carried head. Varian compared the ride and handling of a horse trained in this manner to that of a Jaguar automobile.|$|E

25|$|Initially, the {{effectiveness}} of respirators were evaluated with their tests in the laboratories. But detection of cases of excessive exposure of harmful agents on those workers who <b>properly</b> <b>used</b> and maintained approved respirators (with high efficiency filters), has prompted experts to change their opinions. In the late 1960s, researchers found that real effectiveness of respirators in the workplaces were significantly lower than during tests in laboratories.|$|E

25|$|Interval {{changes are}} {{accomplished}} {{by moving the}} inside and outside mallets independently of one another, as described in Stevens' book, Method of Movement for Marimba. As the interval widens, the inside mallet rolls between the thumb and index finger, such that the index finger moves from underneath {{to the side of}} the shaft, and the middle finger becomes the fulcrum of the cantilever. The outside mallet is moved principally with the little and ring fingers, although the first section of the middle finger follows along and remains in light contact.

25|$|When the war began, the 13 colonies {{lacked a}} {{professional}} army or navy. Each colony sponsored local militia. Militiamen were lightly armed, had little training, and usually {{did not have}} uniforms. Their units served {{for only a few}} weeks or months at a time, were reluctant to travel far from home and thus were unavailable for extended operations, and lacked the training and discipline of soldiers with more experience. If <b>properly</b> <b>used,</b> however, their numbers could help the Continental armies overwhelm smaller British forces, as at the battles of Concord, Bennington and Saratoga, and the siege of Boston. Both sides used partisan warfare but the Americans effectively suppressed Loyalist activity when British regulars were not in the area.|$|E
25|$|The experts {{used the}} results of {{measurements}} at the laboratories and at the workplaces to develop more completely terminology for description of the respirators' performance; and this terminology has been applied officially, and {{in the preparation of}} research results for publication. Specialists began to use different terms to describe the protection factors, which were measured at workplaces with continuous use of respirators; and measured in the workplace when the workers used of respirators intermittently; measured not in the workplace while fit testing; measured in the laboratories under the simulation workplace's conditions; and for the protection factors, that can be expected (in most cases) when the workers <b>properly</b> <b>used</b> the respirators at the workplace.|$|E
25|$|In Slovak, the caron over {{lowercase}} t, d, l, and uppercase L consonants resembles an apostrophe: ď, ť, ľ, Ľ. This {{is especially}} so in certain common typographic renderings. But it is non-standard {{to use an}} apostrophe instead of the caron. There is also l with an acute accent: ĺ, Ĺ. In Slovak the apostrophe is <b>properly</b> <b>used</b> only to indicate elision in certain words (tys, as an abbreviated form of ty si ("you are"), or hor for hore ("up")); however, these elisions are restricted to poetry (with a few exceptions). Moreover, the apostrophe is also used before a two-digit year number (to indicate the omission {{of the first two}} digits): 87 (usually used for 1987).|$|E

25|$|During {{the ancient}} Han Dynasty (202 BC-220 AD) of China, the sluice gate and canal lock of the flash lock had been known. By the 10th century the latter design was {{improved}} upon in China with {{the invention of}} the canal pound lock, allowing different adjusted levels of water along separated and gated segments of a canal. This innovation allowed for larger transport barges to pass safely without danger of wrecking upon the embankments, and was an innovation praised by those such as Shen Kuo (1031–1095). Shen also wrote in his Dream Pool Essays of the year 1088 that, if <b>properly</b> <b>used,</b> sluice gates positioned along irrigation canals were most effective in depositing silt for fertilization. Writing earlier in his Dongpo Zhilin of 1060, Su Shi came to a different conclusion, writing that the Chinese of a few centuries past had perfected this method and noted that it was ineffective in use by his own time.|$|E
25|$|The last {{military}} {{use of the}} Danevirke {{was during}} the Second War of Schleswig in 1864. Due especially to the above-mentioned emotive nationalist symbolism, public opinion in Denmark and the Danish military had expected the coming battle to take place here. After centuries of abandonment and decay, the Danevirke fortifications were partially restored, strengthened, and equipped with artillery installations in 1850 and 1861. In the Second War of Schleswig, there was some early skirmishing {{to the south of}} the Danevirke, but ironically no battle took place here, as the Danish Commander in Chief, General de Meza, withdrew all soldiers to the trenches at Dybbøl, owing to an unexpected threat of being outflanked. The Schlei and the wetlands between the Danevirke and Husum had frozen solid in a hard winter, and the territory immediately south of the Danevirke had been conquered by the advancing German army. This retreat came as a surprise to the Austro-Prussian army, and almost all of the Danish army succeeded in completing the evacuation. It resulted, however, in the abandonment of important pieces of heavy artillery, and it remains a matter of historical debate why the railway to Flensburg was never <b>properly</b> <b>used</b> for the evacuation. News of the retreat came as a great shock to Danish public opinion which had considered the Danevirke to be impregnable, and General deMeza was promptly relieved of his command. The Danevirke has remained in German possession ever since.|$|E

500|$|Stanton noted many {{commentators}} placed {{emphasis on}} the environmental aspect of humanity's complacency in the film, because [...] "that disconnection {{is going to be}} the cause, indirectly, of anything that happens in life that's bad for humanity or the planet". Stanton said that by taking away effort to work, the robots also take away humanity's need to put effort into relationships. Christian journalist Rod Dreher saw technology as the complicated villain of the film. The humans' artificial lifestyle on the Axiom has separated them from nature, making them [...] "slaves of both technology and their own base appetites, and have lost what makes them human". Dreher contrasted the hardworking, dirt covered WALL-E with the sleek clean robots on the ship. However, it is the humans and not the robots who make themselves redundant. Humans on the ship and on Earth have overused robots and the ultra-modern technology. During the end credits, humans and robots are shown working alongside each other to renew the Earth. [...] "WALL-E is not a Luddite film," [...] he said. [...] "It doesn't demonize technology.
