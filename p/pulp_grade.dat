Both entrained and dissolved gases can be found from virtually all pulp flows, but fast and accurate inline measurement technique for gas content measurement has yet to been established. In these experiments new sonar technique for gas content measurement was tested. Experiments where done in pilot-scale pumping system where pulp suspension was circulated with centrifugal pump in closed loop. Measurements where located in the vertical outlet pipe of the pump. Air content of the system could be adjusted with two different principles. Macro bubbles (> 100 µm) were fed to the system through membrane tube controlling volumetric air flow with rotameters. Micro bubbles (= 20 - 100 µm) were created precipitating bubbles from dissolved form controlling the level of dissolved oxygen and volumetric flow of the supersaturated suspension. Measurement accuracy of the sonar method was tested with four different air content levels and two different bubble types.

40|$|Pulp {{and paper}} {{production}} has three major processing steps: pulping, bleaching, and paper production. The type of pulping {{and the amount}} of bleaching used depend {{on the nature of the}} feedstock and the desired qualities of the end product. Sulphite pulping is one of the chemical pulping processes that can be used. It involves chemically pulping the wood using SO 2 adsorbed in a base solution. Sulphite pulping produces a weaker paper than some other types of pulping, but the pulp is less coloured, making it more suitable for printing, often with little bleaching. The production of sulphite pulps (European Commission 2001) is much smaller than the production of kraft pulps and sulphite pulps are more used in special purposes in papermaking rather than being an alternative market <b>pulp</b> <b>grade</b> for kraft pulps. Very little unbleached sulphite pulp is made and the yield is a little higher which can be attributed to the lower pH in the cooking.

However, there is no study reported on the anatomical structure changes of them caused by pretreatment using mixed culture of white-rot fungi. This paper reports the results of the {{research on}} paper/pulp quality after different treatments. Pretreatment that used Trametes versicolor fungi and lasted for 45 days inflicted intensive fiber damages compared with those of untreated bamboo (control). Fresh and barkless large (betung) bamboo chips of 2 year's old, and 1. 6 cm in length, were inoculated by 10 % of mixed culture of white-rot fungi inoculums stock for 30 and 45 days in room temperature. There were four treatment groups of mixed culture, i. e T. versi color and P. ostreatus (TVPO); P. ostreatus and P. chrysosporium (POPC); P. chrysosporium and T. versi color (PCTV); and P. chrysosporium, T. versicolorand P. ostreatus (TVPCPO). After the inoculation period, the chips weremacerated into separate fibers using Scultze method to analyze the fiber dimension and its derived values. The fibers were then observed regarding their macro and microscopic structures by optical microscope. Mixed culture pretreatment of white-rot fungi accelerated improvement of fiber morphology and fiber derived value characteristics, except for Muhlsteph ratio. The fiber derived values oftreated bamboo tended to improve compared to those of untreated bamboo, there by requiring milder pulping conditions. Accordingly, the treated bamboo would indicatively produce a good quality <b>pulp</b> (<b>grade</b> I) based on FAO and LPHH (Forest Product Research Report) requirements. Co-culture treatment using P. chrysosporium and P. ostreatus for 45 days produced the best fiber dimension and its derived value properties.

A joint study was undertaken to evaluate the wood and pulp quality from fast-grown 14 -year-old loblolly pine from the Piedmont and 17 -year-old slash pine from the Coastal Plain. The properties were compared to 24 -year-old plantation-grown controls. ~hree sets of chip samples, sawmill residial, top log, and whole stem, were prepared &om each wood source. Two unbleached <b>pulp</b> <b>grades,</b> linerboard at kappa no. 90 and sack kraft at kappa no. 60, were prepared from each chip sample, and the pulp yields, fiber lengths, and handsheet properties were compared.

40|$|Autohydrolysis of Eucalyptus globulus was {{conducted}} at three different intensity levels typical for prehydrolysis kraft pulping as utilized for manufacturing dissolving <b>pulp</b> <b>grades.</b> The objective was to establish for the autohydrolysis process a detailed mass balance comprising the chemical composition of all three phases: the autohydrolysate, the released gas, and the solid residue. Carbohydrate determination involved both acid methanolysis combined with gas chromatography (GC) and sulfuric acid total hydrolysis with high performance anion exchange chromatography (HPAEC) coupled with pulsed amperometric detection (PAD); this allowed reliable quantification of neutral as well as acidic sugar units in cellulosic and non-cellulosic polysaccharides. Uronic acids present in the Eucalyptus globulus wood were progressively degraded through decarboxylation, leading to substantial carbon dioxide formation. The degree of acetylation of xylan remaining in the wood residue was clearly reduced, while the amount of bound acetyl groups in dissolved xylo-oligosaccharides (XOS) stayed relatively constant {{as a function of}} autohydrolysis intensity.

In a recent project, Innventia has developed wood based pulps optimized for conversion to biofuels. These novel pulps were produced to target a high level of enzymatic hydrolyzability. To assess the hydrolyzability of these pulps, a laboratory protocol has been established using an enzyme mixture containing Celluclast 1. 5 L and Novozyme 188 with an activity of 10 FPU/g pulp (Andersen 2007). Results obtained using this protocol are assumed to be relevant for industrial conditions. In addition to assessment of the produced pulps, the results have been compared to commercial cellulose substrates and pulps of a variety of grades. Furthermore, supramolecular properties – specific surface area and average pore size – were determined by an in-house method utilizing solid state nuclear magnetic resonance (Larsson et al. 2013).

40|$|For {{economical}} {{and environmental}} reasons, the paper industry has shifted {{the production of}} paper products towards dyed products made from <b>pulp</b> <b>grades</b> with a high content of recovered paper. The basic method for dyeing paper products is pulp colouring with direct and basic dyes. Disadvantages of this method include coloured white water and so-called „bleeding” processes when using those products. „Bleeding” processes are undesired when using tissue products. A new eco-friendly method for dyeing pulp with adducts of reactive dyes and selected cationic aliphatic polyamine compouds was developed. A reactive dye is added to refined pulp and then a cationic polyamine compound. The dyeing substance is adsorbed on the entire surface of refined cellulose based semi finished products in a water medium with a pH near to neutral. After web consolidation, an uniform dye penetrated paper product is obtained, with high colour life and strength. Reactive dyes contain 3 ’-carboxypyridine- 1, 3, 5 -triazine systems that react with cellulose in a medium near to neutral and at a temperature similar to web drying. As polyamine compounds, polycondensates of guanidine with hexamethylene- 1. 6 -diamine and octamethylene- 1, 8 -diamine were used. As was proved by a test done on coloured paper, these compounds are characterised by bactericidal and fungicidal properties, which are advised for tissue paper. The polyamine compounds mentioned cause the quantitative adsorption of dyes on cellulose based pulp, increasing the retention of cellulose fibre fines, and the white water is practically colourless.

The resulting pulps were fully bleached by the O-D*-(EP) -D sequence and characterized for their beatability, drainability and physical-mechanical properties. The lignin content (20. 2 %) was low, indicating that this grass should be easier to pulp. The morphological analyses of the elephant grass indicated a short fiber material, similar to hardwoods. The soda pulp from elephant grass cooked to kappa number 17. 5 presented higher screened yield than 10. 6 kappa pulp, with alkali demands of 15. 0 % and 20. 0 %, respectively. The total active chlorine required by the 17. 5 and 10. 6 kappa pulps, were 42. 1 and 35. 1 kg/odt pulp, respectively, to achieve an ISO brightness of approximately 90. 0 %. The bleached soda pulps cooked to 17. 5 and 10. 6 kappa number showed similar refinability and resistance to drainage, but the tensile and burst index were highest for the 17. 5 kappa pulp at beating energy consumptions in the range of 0 - 6 Wh.

A xylanase and a cellulase preparation, both commercial, are applied on this pulp {{in order to}} evaluate their potential as catalysts for carrying out the previously stated upgrade. The main objective is to remove hemicelluloses present in starting pulp, which are an undesirable impurity in final product. Other modifications are as well profitable, such as increases in cellulose reactivity, a key parameter in dissolving pulps quality. After application, it is observed that final pulps present a lower content in hemicelluloses, a higher reactivity as well as other positive modificationsPostprint (published version...|$|R
40|$|To convert {{bleached}} softwood paper <b>grade</b> <b>pulp</b> into {{dissolving pulp}} for viscose application, {{two stages of}} treatments consisting of enzymatic treatment and alkaline peroxide treatment were investigated. It was found that high reactivity (about 80 %) of pulp could be achieved by endoglucanases (EG) -rich industrial cellulase treatment, and the alpha-cellulose content {{as well as the}} viscosity of enzymatically treated pulp can be further adjusted by the alkaline peroxide treatment with certain dosages of NaOH and H 2 O 2 to finally meet the quality requirements of dissolving pulp. The resulting pulp with 68. 7 % of reactivity, 92. 1 % of alpha-cellulose content, and 506. 9 mL/g of pulp viscosity could be obtained after the two stages of treatments. The appropriate dosage of EG-rich cellulase was 300 IU/g bone dry pulp in the stage of enzymatic treatment, while the suitable dosages of NaOH and H 2 O 2 were 9 wt% and 1 wt%, respectively, in the stage of alkaline peroxide treatment.

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} is to assess the usefulness of cointegration analysis and related time series techniques for forecasting commodity prices. The analysis focuses on market pulp, a typical commodity. Important short-term factors in determining pulp prices include capacity utilization, the shipments rate, and inventories. Important longterm factors include investment behavior and costs of production. Autoregressive, moving average (ARMA), vector autoregressive (VAR) and error correction models of price and these variables are developed. Market scope is defined to include ail North American and Scandinavian (Norscan) chemical paper <b>grade</b> <b>pulp,</b> and the sample period is 1976 - 1991. Out of sample forecasting performance of the error correction models is no better than that of the VAR model, according to the RMSE criterion. However, the forecasts generated by the error correction models have the property that sensible long-term relationships between variables are maintained. In addition the error correction models a. re more amenable to incorporating expert knowledge into the model-based forecasts. It is thus concluded that error correction models are useful for forecasting commodity prices...|$|R
50|$|India's Indian Look East policy, saw India grow {{relations}} with ASEAN countries including Thailand, and Thailand's Look West policy, also saw it grow its {{relations with}} India. Both countries are members of BIMSTEC. Indian Prime Ministers Rajiv Gandhi, P.V. Narasimha Rao, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, and Manmohan Singh, have visited Thailand, which were reciprocated by contemporary Thai Prime Ministers Chatichai Choonhavan, Thaksin Sinawatra, and Surayud Chulanont. In 2003, a Free Trade Agreement was signed between the two countries. India, is the 13th largest investor in Thailand. The spheres of trade are in chemicals, pharmaceuticals, textiles, nylon, tyre cord, real estate, rayon fibres, paper <b>grade</b> <b>pulps,</b> steel wires, and rods. However, IT services, and manufacturing, are the main spheres. Through Buddhism, India, has culturally influenced Thailand. The Indian epics, Mahabharata, and Ramayana, are popular and are widely taught in schools {{as part of the}} curriculum in Thailand. The example can also be seen in temples around Thailand, where the story of Ramayana and renowned Indian folk stories are depicted on the temple wall. Thailand, has become a big tourist destination for Indians.|$|R
