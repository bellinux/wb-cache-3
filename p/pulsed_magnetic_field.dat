50|$|Pulsed-eddy current (PEC) tools use a probe coil {{to send a}} <b>pulsed</b> <b>{{magnetic}}</b> <b>field</b> into a metal object. The varying {{magnetic field}} induces eddy currents on the metal surface. The tool processes the detected eddy current signal and compares it to a reference signal set before the tool run; the material properties are eliminated to give a reading for the average wall thickness within the area covered by the magnetic field. The tool logs the signal for later analysis. The following diagram illustrates the principle of a typical PEC inspection tool.|$|E
5000|$|In {{order to}} {{localize}} this signal attenuation to get images of diffusion {{one has to}} combine the <b>pulsed</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> gradient pulses used for MRI (aimed at localization of the signal, but those gradient pulses are too weak to produce a diffusion related attenuation) with additional [...] "motion-probing" [...] gradient pulses, according to the Stejskal and Tanner method. This combination is not trivial, as cross-terms arise between all gradient pulses. The equation set by Stejskal and Tanner then becomes inaccurate and the signal attenuation must be calculated, either analytically or numerically, integrating all gradient pulses present in the MRI sequence and their interactions. The result quickly becomes very complex given the many pulses present in the MRI sequence and, as a simplication, Le Bihan suggested to gather all the gradient terms in a [...] "b factor" [...] (which depends only on the acquisition parameters), so that the signal attenuation simply becomes: ...|$|E
50|$|Special purpose, high-energy triggerable {{spark gaps}} {{can be used}} to rapidly switch high {{voltages}} and very high currents for certain pulsed power applications, such as pulsed lasers, railguns, fusion, ultrastrong <b>pulsed</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> research, and in the triggering of nuclear bombs. Commercially available devices can be divided into two classes: positive pressure and triggered vacuum gaps. Positive pressure triggered gaps have a limited operating voltage range (for instance, from 1/3 to 2/3 of the self breakdown voltage). Triggered vacuum gaps offer a wide operating voltage range (400 V to 90 kV is achievable). Both classes can switch higher energy levels than any thyristor, thyratron, krytron, or sprytron. Triggered gaps are popular for single-shot and low-repetition-rate applications. One such switch is known as a trigatron. The Ignitron and Crossatron could be considered triggered gaps. The latter is unique in that it can be turned back off by the control electrode after conduction begins. The xenon flash tube is another common triggered gap. Various schemes have also been devised to trigger open air gaps on command. A set of spark gaps are a key element of a Marx generator, used to generate high-voltage impulses; the spark gaps allow a chain of capacitors to be slowly charged in parallel and then rapidly discharged in series.|$|E

50|$|Smart RISUG is a newer {{version of}} the male {{contraception}} that was published in 2009. This polymer adds iron oxide and copper particles to the original compound, giving it magnetic properties and the name “Smart” RISUG. After injection {{the exact location of}} the polymer inside the vas deferens can be measured and visualized by X-ray and magnetic imaging. The polymer location can also be externally controlled using a <b>pulsed</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field.</b> With this magnetic field, the polymer can change location inside the body to maximize sterility or can be removed to restore fertility. The polymer has magnetoelastic behavior that allow it to stretch and elongate to better line the vas deferens. The iron oxide component is necessary to prevent agglomeration. With the original RISUG polymer, the SMA can possibly clump as a reaction to neighboring proteins. With the presence of iron particles, the polymer has lower protein binding and therefore prevents agglomeration. This makes Smart RISUG safer for the user as it will not accidentally block the vas deferens. The copper particles in the compound allow the polymer to conduct heat. When an external microwave applies heat to the polymer, is can liquify the polymer again to be excreted to restore fertility. Smart RISUG is therefore better choice for men who want to use RISUG as temporary birth control, since it does not require a second surgery to restore fertility. The addition of metal ions also increases the effectiveness of the spermicide. The low frequency electromagnetic field disintegrates the sperm cell membrane in the head region. This in turn causes both acrosin and hyaluronidase enzymes to leak out of the sperm, making the sperm infertile. The safety of Smart RISUG is still being investigated. With literature research, the spermicidal properties of the compound should not have negative effects on the lining of the vas deferens. The albino rats used to develop the new polymer have not had any adverse symptoms.|$|E
