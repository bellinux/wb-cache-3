50|$|Fish {{and other}} {{vertebrates}} {{appear to have}} only three arrestins: no equivalent of arrestin-2, {{which is the most}} abundant non-visual subtype in mammals, was cloned so far. The proto-chordate C. intestinalis (sea squirt) has only one arrestin, which serves as visual in its mobile larva with highly developed eyes, and becomes generic non-visual in the blind sessile adult. Conserved positions of multiple introns in its gene and those of our arrestin subtypes suggest that they all evolved from this ancestral arrestin. Lower invertebrates, such as roundworm C. elegans, also have only one arrestin. Insects have arr1 and arr2, originally termed “visual arrestins” because they are expressed in photoreceptors, and one non-visual subtype (kurtz in Drosophila). Later arr1 and arr2 were found {{to play an important role}} in olfactory neurons and renamed “sensory”. Fungi have distant arrestin relatives involved in <b>pH</b> <b>sensing.</b>|$|E
40|$|We use {{fluorescence}} spectroscopy {{to measure}} the <b>pH</b> <b>sensed</b> by proteins which are immobilized in mesoporous silica particles by covalently attaching the pH-probe SNARF 1 to the proteins. In contrast to previous attempts where pH-probes were attached to the pore surface, the present approach allows the pH to be measured without altering {{the properties of the}} silica material. When the particles are suspended in aqueous solutions of various pH the emission spectra of the labeled proteins indicate an environment inside the pores which is closer to neutral compared to the bulk solution. In a 1 -butanol/water mixture (92. 5 / 7. 5 %) the emission spectra of the immobilized proteins report a pH-behavior typical of the aqueous suspensions, in contrast to the blue-shifted emission spectrum of the protein in the outside organic solvent. This observation shows that the immobilized proteins experience an aqueous pore environment even though the surrounding solution is poor in water. The spectra of SNARF 1 -labeled bovine serum albumin and feruloyl esterase generated similar results suggesting that the method can be applied to different types of proteins. Taken together the results show that spectroscopic probes carried by immobilized macromolecules can be used to characterize the environment inside mesoporous particles without perturbing the properties of the material...|$|R

5000|$|G2A was {{initially}} defined {{as one of}} the gene products whose production was stimulated in mouse pre-B lymphocytes (see Immunoglobulin heavy chain) by transfecting the cells with the human oncogene (i.e., cancer causing) BCR-ABL or by treating the cells with DNA damaging agents; its expression in these cells blocked their progression through the cell cycle specifically at the G2-M DNA damage checkpoint. [...] These studies allow that G2A limits the potentially malignant growth of certain cells in mice and possible could do so in humans. In addition, Gene knockout studies in mice find G2A to be necessary for suppressing an autoimmune syndrome (see G2A deficiency in mice). These results allow that G2A may function in blocking certain aspects of autoimmunity, particularly those involving the proliferation and tissue trafficking of lymphocytes. [...] Early studies first classified G2A as a proton-sensing receptor and suggested that G2A contributed to the regulation of proliferation in certain cells and the regulation of lymphocytes' contributions to certain immune functions by being activated by changes in extracellular pH. [...] Tissues suffering malignant cell growth, autoimmune reactions, poor blood flow ischemia, inflammation and allergy reactions, and tissue injury develop extracellular acidification due to the stimulation of anaerobic glycolysis; The proton-sensing function of G2A could be involved in combating or, in certain cases promoting these conditions. [...] An example implicating G2A's pH sensitivity in physiological responses involves pain perception. In rats, G2A, similar to other <b>pH</b> <b>sensing</b> GPCRs, is located in dorsal root ganglia neurons, small diameter neurons responsible for nociception, and other nerve tissues responsible for sensing pain; it is suggested that G2A in these nerve tissues detects the acid changes that occur in the extracellular media of injured tissues and signal for the perception of pain ...|$|E

Prominent transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD), Molybdenum disulphide (MoS 2), as a channel material for Field Effect Transistor {{has been used for}} sensing nano-biomolecules. Tungsten diselenide (WSe 2), widely used as channel for logic applications, has also shown better performance than other 2 D materials in many cases. pH sensor is integrated with Nanobiosensor most often since charges (value and type) of many biomolecules depend on pH of the solution.

40|$|SummarySurvival {{requires}} that living organisms continuously monitor environmental and tissue <b>pH.</b> Animals <b>sense</b> acidic <b>pH</b> using ion channels and G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), but monitoring of alkaline pH {{is not well}} understood. We report here that in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, a transmembrane receptor-type guanylyl cyclase (RGC), GCY- 14, of the ASEL gustatory neuron, plays {{an essential role in}} the sensing of extracellular alkalinity. Activation of GCY- 14 opens a cGMP-gated cation channel encoded by tax- 2 and tax- 4, resulting in Ca 2 + entry into ASEL. Ectopic expression of GCY- 14 in other neurons indicates that it accounts for the alkalinity sensing capability. Domain-swapping and site-directed mutagenesis of GCY- 14 reveal that GCY- 14 functions as a homodimer, in which histidine of the extracellular domains plays a crucial role in alkalinity detection.
