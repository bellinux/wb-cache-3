25|$|Aware {{that the}} Brookings Institution had played an {{influential}} role for decades in promoting liberal ideas, the Heritage Foundation {{was designed as}} a counterpart on the right. Meanwhile, older conservative think tanks such as the American Enterprise Institute grew rapidly as a result of major increases in conservative philanthropy. Both think tanks became more oriented to the news media, more aggressively ideological, and more focused on rapid-response production and shorter publications. At the same time, they generally eschewed long-term research in favor of projects with immediate <b>policy</b> <b>implications</b> and produced synthetic materials rather than long-term research.|$|E

25|$|Since the Court's actual holding {{concerning}} CWA regulation was narrow, {{while its}} rationale was wider ranging (as discussed above), the <b>policy</b> <b>implications</b> {{of how much}} the SWANCC decision restricts federal regulation depend on how broadly or narrowly the opinion is applied. Two scenarios are possible. A broad reading would be interpreted as knocking out all section 404 jurisdiction and Corps regulation of isolated waters and wetlands. However, a narrow reading, one asserting that jurisdiction will be found lacking only if the sole connection to interstate commerce {{is the presence of}} migratory birds and wildlife, would allow federal regulation of some isolated waters to continue (such as in waters that are used by interstate travelers for recreation).|$|E

40|$|This article {{highlights}} {{the problems associated}} with theexistence of financiai institutions owned by a State which is a member of a federation. We show that these financiai institutions allow the States to transfer deficits to the federal government. This possibility creates incentives to higher deficits at State and federal leveis, implying an inefficiently high inflation rate. The main <b>policy</b> <b>implication</b> is that stabilization policies are more difficult to be implemented in countries such as Brazil, and Argentina which allow the members of the federation to own financiai institutions. A second <b>policy</b> <b>implication</b> is that Economic Blocks such as the European Community or Mercosur should not allow regional central banks if they create a monetary authority to help the members in financiai difficulty. ...|$|R
