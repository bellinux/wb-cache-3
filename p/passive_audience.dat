2500|$|While the {{harmonic}} and {{dramatic changes in}} the madrigal around 1600 may seem abrupt, the addition of instruments was not a new development. [...] Instrumental performance of madrigals had already been widespread for much of the 16th century, either in arrangements or in performances mixed with singers. [...] As madrigals had originally been largely designed for performance by groups of talented amateurs, without a <b>passive</b> <b>audience,</b> instruments were also commonly used to fill in for missing parts. [...] Instrumentation during the period was rarely specified; indeed Monteverdi indicated in his fifth and sixth book of madrigals that the basso seguente, the instrumental bass part, was optional in the ensemble madrigals. [...] The most commonly used instruments for playing the bass line and filling in any inner parts, at this time, were the lute, theorbo (chitarrone), and harpsichord.|$|E

So did Brechts first great play, Saint Joan of the Stockyards, which attempts to portray the drama in financial transactions.|$|R

Building on the knowledge of television’s role in facilitating public life, and the everyday, affective practices through which it is experienced and used, I focus on the way in which YouTube operates as a site of community, creativity and cultural citizenship; and as an archive of popular cultural memory...|$|R
5000|$|Crowds can {{be active}} (mobs) or <b>passive</b> (<b>audiences).</b> Active crowds {{can be further}} divided into aggressive, escapist, acquisitive, or {{expressive}} mobs. Aggressive mobs are often violent and outwardly focused. Examples are football riots and the L.A. Riots of 1992. Escapist mobs are characterized by {{a large number of}} panicked people {{trying to get out of}} a dangerous situation. These types of mobs are why it is illegal to yell, [...] "Fire!" [...] in a crowded theater. Acquisitive mobs occur when large numbers of people are fighting for limited resources. An expressive mob is any other large group of people gathering for an active purpose. Civil disobedience, rock concerts, and religious revivals all fall under this category.|$|R

40|$|From 1999 to 2000 I {{undertook}} an ethnographic audience {{research project}} that studied fifteen {{families in the}} three Chinese cities of Beijing, Guangzhou and Wuhan, five in each city. Setting out to investigate television-related activities of the subjects and their relations to television, {{the study found that}} the samples, though quite small in number, were more heterogeneous than the existing categories of television viewers can cover. Among members of the fifteen families, as well as a few <b>passive</b> <b>audiences,</b> there were also active viewers who used television selectively to gratify desires and needs. There were those who actively made different meanings of television programmes, while there were others who ‘abused’ television for alternative purposes and, in doing so, downgraded the television set from the grace of the terminal of propaganda to a marginal and supportive accessory. This paper offers case descriptions of the different types of viewers, especially those ‘abusers’. I will begin with two case descriptions of audience members who passively absorbed television messages or used television for gratification of desires and needs, but the bulk of the paper will concentrate on more detailed case descriptions of abusers, who have not been theorised by existing television studies...|$|R
40|$|The Psalmbook of 2003 as {{a source}} of liturgical {{enrichment}} The aim {{of this article is to}} bring to view some liturgical possi- bilities made available through the Psalmbook of 2003. One of the objectives of this intensively revised volume was to expand and enrich the liturgy through congregational singing. New psalm melodies, newly-versified Scriptures set to well-known tunes, as well as psalms set to favourite “Liederwysies”, will contribute to a newly-illuminated metalanguage of liturgical song.   All examples of songs for the different elements of the liturgy are mainly proposed to serve as a starting point for further creative development. Psalms and Scriptural versifications are suggested for suitable liturgical responses. Especially targeted are liturgical elements where the liturgist speaks on behalf of the congregation. In these instances a selection of songs is given which congregations could utilise as part of an active liturgical dialogue instead of being <b>passive</b> <b>audiences.</b>   This article could also serve as a reference document for or- ganists and liturgists when planning a church service. To en- hance user-friendly utilisation as well as creativity, a variety of liturgical possibilites are presented according to the commonly used liturgical order of reformed church services...|$|R

40|$|While the {{implications}} of peer-to-peer exchange for the media industries have attracted considerable public attention, {{there has been much}} less consideration of how these exchanges operate in the everyday practices of individuals. In a world of networked and viral cultural exchange of cultural life captured in distributed archives, indexed by search engines, and aggregated into microcontent feeds for personal information portals areas of practice once considered inconsequential dumping grounds of cultural production become irrepressibly consequential, even productive. The despised category of mass consumption fractured by several generations of poststructuralists, and corroded by ongoing research in fan and reception studies, may find a still greater foe in the undisciplined practices of teenage music sharing, game hacking, and personal journal blogs. These emergent digital culture forms signal the active participation of previously marginal and invisible groups in what we must now recognize as cultural production, not simply as derivative acts of active consumption or ephemeral personal communication. What does it mean for those previously constructed as consumers, non-generative, <b>passive</b> <b>audiences</b> for professionally produced culture are handed the means not only to distribute media through alternative peer-to-peer networks, but to remix, repackage, re-value, and produce media through amateur cultural production...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Despite {{two decades}} of {{impressive}} technological improvement, Virtual Reality is only slowly becoming useful in real-world applications for designers. Many VR applications are perceptually overwhelming with high quality graphics and stunning animation, but the support of everyday natural interaction between human and computer, and between humans supported by a computer, is only progressing slowly. Analysis of existing VR technology suggests that the large-scale applications (such as the CAVE and flight simulators) and small-scale applications (such as surgical trainers and miniature holographic systems) lend themselves best for large <b>passive</b> <b>audiences</b> (like a theater with audience) and active single users, respectively. Middle-sized table top systems are probably best suited to support multiple users working together. After all, a table in itself affords use by more people (e. g. eating together). In this poster we compare a number of existing and proposed table-sized VR setups which aim for {{a high degree of}} ‘free interaction’. Issues of discussion are the need for simultaneous access (multiple users having democratic control over the input/output channels), ‘sketchy interaction’ (fluidity of expression, allowing suggestive rather than prescriptive information), tangibility (merging virtual and physical), openness (showing clearly to the user what parameters the system is sensing), and rapid implementation (flexibility in how quickly applications can be supported using).

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} history {{education}} is becoming dangerously obsolete, {{as it does}} not always relate to the contemporary needs of 21 st century learners, who often find history useless and irrelevant to their present situation. This challenge is attributed to, among other reasons, the way history is taught through largely lecture-driven pedagogies that significantly reduced active learner engagement. This article draws on Gadamer’s Hermeneutic philosophy to advocate for dialogue in understanding and interpreting history artifacts using 21 st century technologies. Gadamerian Hermeneutics focuses on horizons of understanding through open–ended questioning and answering {{between past and present}} rather than transmission to <b>passive</b> <b>audiences.</b> The article argues for the collaborative interpretation of history meanings between teachers and students mediated by a Wiki. The methodology involved a case study of pre-service teachers enrolled at Makerere University in Uganda. The purely qualitative study draws on Gilly Salmon’s five-stage model of online learning. The findings indicate that participants successfully engaged with the first three stages - access and motivation, online socialisation, and information exchange  - but less so with stages four and five, knowledge construction and development. The paper concludes by proposing a framework that could be useful to teachers wanting to facilitate history education using modern approaches that are relevant and meaningful to today’s learners...|$|R

40|$|Working the definitions, ideologies, and {{implications}} of the concepts of active and <b>passive</b> <b>audiences,</b> Biocca uses the research literature {{to demonstrate that the}} active audience position is overextended and often trivial. He removes the locus of control from both the media and the individual and places it in the center of physiological, psychological, social, and semiotic structures. A T the very center of mass communication research there lies a fundamental dichotomy, a split between opposite conceptions of the mass communication process and its audience. In one of its many forms, it permeates a number of theoretical and methodological debates. Over the last 40 years of theory and research, a kind of theoretical tug-of-war has emerged. On one end of the rope we find the active audience: individualistic, "impervious to influence, " rational, and selective. On the other end, we have the passive audience: conformist, gullible, anomic, vulnerable, victims. Huffing and tugging at each end is an assorted lot of key media theorists championing their perception of the social reality. Mass communication theory's simultaneous embrace of both conceptions frames many of the questions we ask about the sociopolitical role of the media, the audience member's cognitions of self and "reality, " as well as the moment-to-moment cognitive processes by which the individual decodes media content and form. What are the limits of individual intellectual freedom {{in the face of the}} institutions for the dissemination of information an...|$|R
40|$|Political {{campaigns are}} greatly {{influenced}} by changes in technology and communication, from FDR’s ‘Fireside Chats’ to JFK’s embrace of television. Now a combination of technologies allows almost everyone to create, reproduce, transform, and share images with friends and family, or with the world. Individuals and grassroots organisations can communicate using images alongside mainstream media, corporations and governments. There is now a great need {{for all of us}} to develop the visual literacy – or graphicacy – required to interpret and recreate images, to communicate as educated equals in this new political environment. Political advertising can use graphic design to make implications that they wouldn’t be willing to say explicitly, invoking cultural ideas and associations to make their case, sometimes misleadingly. This paper will look at some of the techniques that are commonly used in political campaigns, and discuss how we can teach people the skills they need to ‘read’ campaign materials and make informed judgments about the arguments being made. Graphicacy is a necessary skill if all citizens are to fully participate in public debate, rather than remain <b>passive</b> <b>audiences.</b> A picture may tell ‘a thousand words’, but as with all political communication it is always open to interpretation. Just as the prevalence of the written word requires literacy for all in a democratic society, so too must we ensure that graphicacy is not a skill that is limited to a small section of the community...|$|R
40|$|Academic and {{regulatory}} debates about Google {{are dominated by}} two opposing theories of what search engines are and how law should treat them. Some describe search engines as passive, neutral conduits for websites’ speech; others describe them as active, opinionated editors: speakers in their own right. The conduit and editor theories give dramatically different policy prescriptions in areas ranging from antitrust to copyright. But they both systematically discount search users’ agency, regarding users merely as <b>passive</b> <b>audiences.</b> A better theory is that search engines are not primarily conduits or editors, but advisors. They help users achieve their diverse and individualized information goals by sorting through the unimaginable scale and chaos of the Internet. Search users are active listeners, affirmatively seeking out the speech they wish to receive. Search engine law can help them by ensuring two things: access to high-quality search engines, and loyalty from those search engines. The advisor theory yields fresh insights into long-running disputes about Google. It suggests, for example, {{a new approach to}} deciding when Google should be liable for giving a website the “wrong” ranking. Users’ goals are too subjective for there to be an absolute standard of correct and incorrect rankings; different search engines necessarily assess relevance differently. But users are also entitled to complain when a search engine deliberately misleads them about its own relevance assessments. The result is a sensible, workable compromise between the conduit and editor theories...|$|R
