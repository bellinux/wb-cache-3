5|$|But in that month, Constans was in {{his turn}} overthrown and killed by the usurper Magnentius, a laetus from Gaul who was comes (commander) of an elite brigade in Constans' comitatus (imperial escort army). In the East, Constantius had been engaged in a lengthy war against the Persians under Shah Shapur II (337-350). But he {{immediately}} concluded a truce {{in order to deal}} with Magnentius. He led his own comitatus to Illyricum where he assumed also command of the local comitatus, bringing his combined strike force to about 60,000. Magnentius gathered an army consisting of the Gaul comitatus (c. 25,000 men) and <b>probably</b> <b>some</b> Frankish and Saxon foederati (allies) and marched into Illyricum to confront Constantius. (For explanation of the term comitatus, see Late Roman army).|$|E
5|$|One famous {{site where}} {{historical}} records {{have been used}} to interpret sites is Chichen Itza. Rather than analysing the site and seeing which targets appear popular, archaeoastronomers have instead examined the ethnographic records to see what features of the sky were important to the Mayans and then sought archaeological correlates. One example which could have been overlooked without historical records is the Mayan interest in the planet Venus. This interest is attested to by the Dresden codex which contains tables with information about the Venus's appearances in the sky. These cycles would have been of astrological and ritual significance as Venus was associated with Quetzalcoatl or Xolotl. Associations of architectural features with settings of Venus can be found in Chichen Itza, Uxmal, and <b>probably</b> <b>some</b> other Mesoamerican sites.|$|E

5|$|The {{military}} {{significance of}} the Device Forts declined during the 18th century. Some of the fortifications were redesigned to provide more comfortable housing for their occupants. Cowes Castle was partially rebuilt in 1716 to modernise its accommodation, demolishing much of the keep and adding residential wings and gardens over the landward defences, and Brownsea Castle began to be converted into a country house from the 1720s onwards. Walmer became the official residence of the Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, and the Duke of Dorset, Lionel Sackville, carried out extensive work there after 1708. There was <b>probably</b> <b>some</b> rivalry {{in the relationship between}} Sackville and the naval officer Sir John Norris, who redeveloped nearby Deal Castle during the same period, creating comfortable wood-panelled quarters for himself there overlooking the sea.|$|E
5|$|The {{period between}} the {{accession}} of Máel Coluim I and Máel Coluim mac Cináeda was marked by {{good relations with the}} Wessex rulers of England, intense internal dynastic disunity and, despite this, relatively successful expansionary policies. In 945, king Máel Coluim I received Strathclyde as part of a deal with King Edmund of England, an event offset somewhat by Máel Coluim's loss of control in Moray. Sometime in the reign of king Idulb (954–962), the Scots captured the fortress called oppidum Eden, i.e. Edinburgh. Scottish control of Lothian was strengthened with Máel Coluim II's victory over the Northumbrians at the Battle of Carham (1018). The Scots had <b>probably</b> <b>some</b> authority in Strathclyde since the later part of the ninth century, but the kingdom kept its own rulers, and {{it is not clear that}} the Scots were always strong enough to enforce their authority.|$|E
5|$|Another {{important}} {{difference was that}} the charioteers themselves, the aurigae, {{were considered to be}} the winners, although they were usually also slaves (as in the Greek world). They received a wreath of laurel leaves, and <b>probably</b> <b>some</b> money; if they won enough races they could buy their freedom. Drivers could become celebrities throughout the Empire simply by surviving, as the life expectancy of a charioteer was not very high. One such celebrity driver was Scorpus, who won over 2000 races before being killed in a collision at the meta when he was about 27 years old. The most famous of all was Gaius Appuleius Diocles who won 1,462 out of 4,257 races. When Diocles retired at the age of 42 after a 24-year career his winnings reportedly totalled 35,863,120 sesterces ($US 15 billion), making him the highest paid sports star in history. The horses, too, could become celebrities, but their life expectancy was also low. The Romans kept detailed statistics of the names, breeds, and pedigrees of famous horses.|$|E

5|$|Skleros {{eventually}} set {{out from}} the city, and divided his forces into three groups: two divisions were placed in ambush on the wooded {{sides of the road}} leading towards the Rus' camp, while another, <b>probably</b> <b>some</b> 2,000–3,000 men, was placed under himself (or Alakaseus in Skylitzes' account) and went forth to attack the Rus' host. The Byzantine detachment quickly came into contact with the Rus' army, and charged the Pecheneg contingent. The Byzantines executed a gradual orderly retreat, turning at intervals to charge back at the pursuing Pechenegs, who had thus become separated from {{the main body of the}} Rus' army. This conflict was fierce and bloody, taxing the discipline and endurance of the small Byzantine force. According to Leo the Deacon, at one point one of the Pechenegs charged Bardas himself and delivered a sword blow on his helmet, which was deflected by the metal without doing harm. Bardas' young brother Constantine came to his rescue, killing the Pecheneg.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after his}} arrival, Augustine founded the monastery of Saints Peter and Paul, which later became St Augustine's Abbey, on land {{donated by the}} king. This {{foundation}} has often been claimed as the first Benedictine abbey outside Italy, and that by founding it, Augustine introduced the Rule of St. Benedict into England, {{but there is no}} evidence the abbey followed the Benedictine Rule {{at the time of its}} foundation. In a letter Gregory wrote to the patriarch of Alexandria in 598, he claimed that more than 10,000 Christians had been baptised; the number may be exaggerated but there is no reason to doubt that a mass conversion took place. However, there were <b>probably</b> <b>some</b> Christians already in Kent before Augustine arrived, remnants of the Christians who lived in Britain in the later Roman Empire. Little literary traces remain of them, however. One other effect of the king's conversion by Augustine's mission was that the Frankish influence on the southern kingdoms of Britain was decreased.|$|E

25|$|The female {{determinant}} is a small, extracellular molecule, {{expressed in}} the stigma; {{the identity of the}} male determinant remains elusive, but it is <b>probably</b> <b>some</b> cell membrane receptor. The interaction between male and female determinants transmits a cellular signal into the pollen tube, resulting in strong influx of calcium cations; this interferes with the intracellular concentration gradient of calcium ions which exists inside the pollen tube, essential for its elongation. The influx of calcium ions arrests tube elongation within 1–2 minutes. At this stage, pollen inhibition is still reversible, and elongation can be resumed by applying certain manipulations, resulting in ovule fertilization.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the work}} on the Redstone rocket, the 12 years from 1945 to 1957 were <b>probably</b> <b>some</b> of the most {{frustrating}} for von Braun and his colleagues. In the Soviet Union, Sergei Korolev and his team of scientists and engineers plowed ahead with several new rocket designs and the Sputnik program, while the American government was not very interested in von Braun's work or views and only embarked on a very modest rocket-building program. In the meantime, the press tended to dwell on von Braun's past {{as a member of the}} SS and the slave labor used to build his V-2 rockets.|$|E

The Danes take the unnamed Frisian queen back to what appear to be her own people in Denmark, identifying the Frisian queen as probably Danish.|$|E
