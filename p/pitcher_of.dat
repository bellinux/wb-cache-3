50|$|No infaunal organisms {{have been}} {{recorded}} from the <b>pitchers</b> <b>of</b> N. aristolochioides. This is not {{due to a lack}} <b>of</b> potential inhabitants; <b>pitchers</b> <b>of</b> N. singalana, which grow alongside N. aristolochioides, support large populations of such organisms. It is thought that the structure of the traps may serve to disorientate emerging adults and so infaunal species avoid colonising them.|$|R
25|$|Some {{species of}} {{mosquitoes}} prefer to breed in phytotelmata (natural reservoirs on plants), such as rainwater accumulated in holes in tree trunks, {{or in the}} leaf-axils of bromeliads. Some specialize in the liquid in <b>pitchers</b> <b>of</b> particular species <b>of</b> <b>pitcher</b> plants, their larvae feeding on decaying insects that had drowned there or on the associated bacteria; the genus Wyeomyia provides such examples — the harmless Wyeomyia smithii breeds only in the <b>pitchers</b> <b>of</b> Sarracenia purpurea.|$|R

5|$|On June 4, {{playing at}} Connie Mack Stadium against the Phillies, Koufax walked Richie Allen {{on a very}} close full-count pitch in the fourth inning. Allen, who was thrown out trying to steal second, was the only Phillie to reach base that day. With his third no-hitter in three years, Koufax became only the second <b>pitcher</b> <b>of</b> the modern era (after Bob Feller) to pitch three no-hitters.|$|E
