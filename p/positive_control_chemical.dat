40|$|Anaerobic {{digestion}} {{has become}} increasing popular for managing biowastes in rural China {{as it has}} the advantage of generating biogas, a renewable energy. A new challenge, however, is minimizing the environmental pollution resulting from the anaerobically digested slurry (ADS). The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the feasibility of using a paddy field to remediate ADS while simultaneously cultivating rice. A field experiment was trialed using six treatments based on varying nitrogen loadings over the period of a rice-growing season. These treatments were adjusted to the content of the N within the ADS and had loadings of 270, 405, 540 and 1080 kgNha - 1. These treatments were compared to a negative control (no fertilizer) and a <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> (<b>chemical</b> fertilizer) that consisted of urea applied at 270 kgNha - 1. The effects of these N sources and slurry remediation were monitored using standard methods to measure water quality, soil properties and changes in rice production. Rice grain yields were generally higher for all ADS treatments than for the urea N treatment. Standing water quality in the field could reach national discharge standards for all treatments within 7 - 8 days after each ADS irrigation. Groundwater quality and heavy metal concentrations in both soil and the rice grain were not affected by the ADS treatments. We suggest that the quantities of ADS irrigated in 867 - 1734 m 3 ha - 1 was not only safe for food quality (rice grain) and the receiving environment (water and soil), but also beneficial to soil fertility and rice grain yield...|$|E
40|$|Tris(1, 3 -dichloro- 2 -propyl) {{phosphate}} (TDCPP) {{has been}} frequently {{detected in the}} environment and in various biota, including fish, and has been implicated in disruption of the thyroid endocrine system. In the present study, zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos were exposed to different concentrations of TDCPP (10, 50, 100, 300 and 600 mu g/L) from 2 h post-fertilization (hpf) to 144 hpf. Developmental endpoints, and whole-body concentrations of thyroid hormones and transcriptional profiles of genes involved in the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis were examined. Exposure to TDCPP caused a dose-dependent developmental toxicity, including decreased body weight, reduced hatching, survival and heartbeat rates, and increased malformation (spinal curvature). Treatment with the <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> <b>chemical</b> 3, 3 ', 5 -triiodo-L-thyronine (T 3) significantly decreased whole-body thyroxin (T 4) concentrations, increased whole-body T 3 concentrations, and upregulated mRNA expression involved in the HPT axis as a compensatory mechanism. These results suggested that the HPT axis in 144 -hpf zebrafish larvae was responsive to chemical exposure and {{could be used to}} evaluate the effects of chemicals on the thyroid endocrine system. TDCPP exposure significantly decreased whole-body T 4 concentrations and increased whole-body T 3 concentrations, indicating thyroid endocrine disruption. The upregulation of genes related to thyroid hormone metabolism (dio 1 and ugt 1 ab) might be responsible for decreased T 4 concentrations. Treatment with TDCPP also significantly increased transcription of genes involved in thyroid hormone synthesis (tsh beta, slc 5 a 5 and tg) and thyroid development (hhex, nkx 2. 1 and pax 8) as a compensatory mechanism for decreased T 4 concentrations. Taken together, these results suggest that TDCPP alters the transcription of genes involved in the HPT axis and changes whole-body concentrations of thyroid hormones in zebrafish embryos/larvae, thus causing an endocrine disruption of the thyroid system.

40|$|Tris(1, 3 -dichloro- 2 -propyl) {{phosphate}} (TDCPP) and {{triphenyl phosphate}} (TPP) are frequently detected in biota, including fish. However, {{knowledge of the}} toxicological and molecular effects of these currently used flame retardants is limited. In the present study, an in vivo screening approach was developed to evaluate effects of TDCPP and TPP on developmental endpoints and receptor-associated expression of mRNA in zebrafish embryos/larvae. Exposure to TDCPP or TPP resulted in significantly smaller rates of hatching and survival, in dose- and time-dependent manners. The median lethal concentration (LC 50) was 7. 0 mg/L for TDCPP and 29. 6 mg/L for TPP at 120 hour post-fertilization (hpf). Real-time PCR revealed alterations in expression of mRNAs involved in aryl hydrocarbon receptors (AhRs) -, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR alpha) -, estrogenic receptors (ERs) -, thyroid hormone receptor alpha (TR alpha) -, glucocorticoid receptor (GR) -, and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) -centered gene networks. Exposure to <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> <b>chemicals</b> significantly altered abundances of mRNA in corresponding receptor-centered gene networks, a result that {{suggests that it is}} feasible to use zebrafish embryos/larvae to evaluate effects of chemicals on mRNA expression in these gene networks. Exposure to TDCPP altered transcriptional profiles in all six receptor-centered gene networks, thus exerting multiple toxic effects. TPP was easily metabolized and its potency to change expression of mRNA involved in receptor-centered gene networks was weaker than that of TDCPP. The PPAR alpha- and TR alpha-centered gene networks might be the primary pathways affected by TPP. Taken together, these results demonstrated that TDCPP and TPP could alter mRNA expression of genes involved in the six receptor-centered gene networks in zebrafish embryos/larvae, and TDCPP seemed to have higher potency in changing the mRNA expression of these genes.

Total doses of 15. 2 mg/kg body weight of the <b>Positive</b> <b>Control</b> and Quartz Isolate were administered to rats by intratracheal instillation. Controls received saline only. Bronchoalveolar lavagate analysis showed that, relative to the controls, the total leukocyte counts at 3 days were significantly elevated in both the Quartz Isolate and <b>Positive</b> <b>Control</b> groups. At 28 and 90 days, the Quartz Isolate values were no longer statistically different from the control values whereas the corresponding <b>Positive</b> <b>Control</b> values were about 12 and 65 times greater than control values.

On d 3 after weaning, pigs were allotted to 1 of 6 dietary treatments. A 2 -phase diet series was used, with treatment diets fed from d 0 to 14 and a common diet fed from d 14 to 28. All diets were in meal form. The formulation was {{based on data from}} previous trials in which fish meal was replaced with crystalline amino acids in the diet for 15 - to 25 -lb pigs. The objective of this trial was to determine which amino acids are required in this low-CP, amino acid-fortified diet. The <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> diet contained L-lysine HCl, DL-methionine, L-threonine, L-isoleucine, L-tryptophan, L-valine, L-glutamine, and L-glycine. The 6 treatments were (1) <b>positive</b> <b>control,</b> (2) <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> with L-isoleucine deleted from the diet, (3) <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> with L-tryptophan deleted, (4) <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> L-valine deleted, (5) <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> with L-glutamine and L-glycine deleted, and (6) <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> with L-isoleucine, L-tryptophan, L-valine, L-glutamine, and L-glycine deleted from diet (negative control). There were 7 pigs per pen and 7 pens per treatment. Pigs and feeders were weighed on d 0, 7, 14, 21, and 28 to calculate ADG, ADFI, and F/G. From d 0 to 14, pigs fed the <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> diet had improved (P 0. 40) ADG, ADFI, and F/G to pigs fed the <b>positive</b> <b>control,</b> but had improved (P 0. 12) ADG to the <b>positive</b> <b>control.</b> There were no differences (P > 0. 10) in ADFI from d 14 to 28. Because of the decrease in ADG from d 0 to 14, pigs fed the negative control or diets without L-tryptophan or L-valine had decreased (P < 0. 04) ADG for the overall trial (d 0 to 28) compared to pigs fed the <b>positive</b> <b>control.</b> ADFI from all treatment diets decreased compared to the <b>positive</b> <b>control,</b> although only the negative control group tested significantly (P 0. 24) in F/G for the overall data. In conclusion, L-tryptophan and L-valine were needed in the low-CP, high amino acid-fortified nursery diet to achieve maximum growth performance from 15 to 25 lb. This suggests that the tryptophan:lysine and valine:lysine requirements are greater than 15 and 57 % of lysine, respectively. The numerical decrease in performance when L-glutamine and L-glycine were removed from the diet during the first period suggests a need for nonessential nitrogen in the low-CP, amino acid-fortified diet or a benefit to one of these amino acids separate from its role as a nitrogen source...|$|R

Moreover, an increase (p < 0. 01) of pattern EA, that is high capacitation level, was recorded with 100 ng/ml relaxin and heparin compared to the negative control both after 2 h (44. 1, 59. 3 and 57. 7 %, respectively, in negative <b>control,</b> <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> and 100 ng/ml relaxin) and after 4 h (43. 0, 54. 4 and 56. 0 %, respectively, in negative <b>control,</b> <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> and 100 ng/ml relaxin). Finally, relaxin increased (p < 0. 01) cleavage rate compared to the negative control (57. 1 ± 4. 4, 72. 5 ± 6. 0, 71. 4 ± 5. 5 and 73. 6 ± 2. 9, respectively, in negative <b>control,</b> <b>positive</b> <b>control,</b> 50 and 100 ng/ml relaxin). In conclusion, relaxin has a beneficial effect on motility, capacitation and fertilizing ability of frozen-thawed buffalo sperm...|$|R

40|$|Design of {{stabilizing}} and time-optimal controllers for discrete-time linear {{systems with}} <b>positive</b> <b>controls</b> is revisited. Necessary and sufficient conditions for stabilizability of {{this class of}} systems are given. A class of stabilizing controllers is designed. We show that a stabilizing time-optimal controller exists if the system is dead-beat controllable. We show by an example that there may also exist time-optimal controllers which are not stabilizing. Keywords: linear systems, <b>positive</b> <b>controls,</b> stabilizing controllers, time-optimal controllers 1. INTRODUCTION Linear systems with <b>positive</b> <b>controls</b> arise in modelling of biological processes (Zaslavsky, 1990), in economics (Heemels, et al., 1997) and may also be obtained from black-box identification of nonlinear systems, where they {{are referred to as}} simple Hammerstein models. Controllability of linear systems with <b>positive</b> <b>controls</b> has been characterized for the continuous-time (CT) and discretetime (DT) cases in (Saperstone, 197 [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to analyze the effect of carbohydrate fraction of hyacinth bean (Lablab purpureus (L.) sweet) diet on lipid profile and peroxydation value of the blood serum and liver of rats. Fifteen male wistar strain rats were divided into three diet groups of five animals. The first group was <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> group with standard diet suplemented with 1 % pure cholesterol. The second group was negative control group with standard diet. The third group was given carbohydrate fraction of hyacinth bean and 1 % pure cholesterol. The experiment was conducted for 75 days. The total cholesterol levels in <b>positive,</b> negative <b>control,</b> and that in the hyacinth treated group were 204. 0, 74. 8, and 99. 8 mg/dl. The LDL levels in the control, negative control group, the hyacinth treated group were 153. 0, 20. 6, and 45. 9 mg/dl. The HDL levels in <b>positive</b> <b>control,</b> negative control, and the hyacinth treated group were 26. 7, 26. 7, and 31. 0 mg/dl. Triglyceride levels in the <b>positive</b> <b>control,</b> negative control, and the hyacinth treated group were 121. 4, 137. 7, and 114. 8 mg/dl. The atherogenic index in the <b>positive</b> <b>control,</b> negative control, and the hyacinth treated group were 6. 9, 1. 9, and 2. 5 point. The total cholesterol and LDL levels in the hyacinth treated group were significantly lower than those in the <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> which showed that the hyacinth treated group underwent hypercholesterolemia effect. Malonaldehyde content of the blood serum in <b>positive</b> <b>control,</b> negative control, and the hyacinth treated group were 0. 54, 0. 48, and 0. 31 µmol/ml. Malonaldehyde content of liver organ in <b>positive</b> <b>control</b> group, negative control group, and the hyacinth treated group were 66. 9, 36. 4 and 73. 4 nmol/g. Malonaldehyde content of blood serum in hyacinth treated group was significantly lower than that in the <b>positive</b> and negative <b>control</b> group. These results showed that the the hyacinth group decreased free radical in the blood serum. On the other hand, the malonaldehyde content of the liver in all treatment showed no significant differences...|$|R

40|$|Ice <b>control</b> <b>chemicals,</b> which act {{to depress}} the {{freezing}} point of water, are used extensively in winter maintenance activities {{to prevent the}} formation of the bond between snow and ice and the highway pavement or to destroy that bond when it has formed. A number of factors may impact the choice of ice <b>control</b> <b>chemicals</b> for a given agency or in a given circumstance, as noted by Nixon and Williams (1). These factors are in essence one way in which the performance of ice <b>control</b> <b>chemicals</b> can be quantified, and as such could be incorporated into specifications to ensure selection of the best chemical(s) for a given agency to use in its winter maintenance activities. The definition of best should be a function of the given agency’s needs. Performance measures for ice <b>control</b> <b>chemicals</b> are important because they are the basis for a quality control program for the acceptance of those chemicals. This paper presents a series of performance measurement tests for chemicals, and discusses the role that they can play in such a quality control program. It extends some preliminary results on simple tests (viscosity and specific gravity) presente...|$|R
