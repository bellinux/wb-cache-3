Our model evidences the interesting and often overlooked result that, {{in the market for}} complementary goods price coordination and monopolistic pricing do not necessarily represent inefficient equilibria, when compared to the alternative Nash equilibrium. Due to the peculiar cross-price effects in the supply of complementary goods, price coordination and monopolistic supply often constitute an improvement over the alternative equilibrium outcomes. To be precise, the welfare effects of competition and price coordination depend {{on the nature of the}} intellectual <b>product</b> <b>concerned.</b> This has obvious implications for the economic analysis of copyright collectivization and for antitrust regulation in this matter...|$|E

The existence of the nonconstant positive steady state is obtained through Crandall-Rabinowitz bifurcation theorem, and the stability of such nonconstant positive steady state and associated Hopf bifurcation are obtained when the intrinsic growth rate of the species is small.

Marketers capitalise on this interest through ‘provenance branding’. Provenance branding is a form of ‘credence marketing’ which suggests certain qualities to consumers that are not really testable in an objective or empirical fashion. Provenance branding suggests that the <b>product</b> <b>concerned</b> has certain qualities that result from its particular geographical origin. Closely connected is the concept encapsulated in the French term ‘terroir’; unique geographical conditions that determine the particular taste and other characteristics of locally produced food or beverages.

40|$|Presence of lipase in milk, curd, whey {{and cheese}} was studied. A {{small amount of}} the product was added to a large volume of lipase-free whole milk {{that had been made}} {{sensitive}} to lipolysis by homogenization. Increase of the acidity of the fat in the mixture, determined after incubation, was interpreted as enzyme activity being present in the <b>product</b> <b>concerned.</b> Results obtained in this way showed that lipase was present in raw milk and in the curd and whey made of it, but that the bulk of the enzyme disappeared quickly from the curd during Gouda cheese making, as a result of several factors including scalding of the curd, whey removal and pH decrease. By using this method no lipase could be detected in ripened Gouda cheese, made of raw milk. Furthermore, no potential lipolytic activity was measured in ripened danish blue cheese, but it was in ripened Camembert and Brie, all of these cheeses being made of pasteurized milk. Obviously, the presence of active milk lipase in ripening cheese is by no means self-evident...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the dynamic routing of product returns in {{distinguishable}} parallel queues. Several vendors alongside an original equipment manufacturer are available in provision of remanufacturing service. Each has its own queue. The stream of the product returns follow a stochastic process. A central controller is employed to decide to which vendor an incoming product is sent to avoid excessive queues in front of some vendors and idle servers in the others. We develop models and index-based heuristics to support the dynamic routing decisions so as to minimize the overall recovering costs. The <b>product</b> <b>concerned</b> exemplifies a short-life cycle due to, for example, technology advance. Long delay during the remanufacturing process will render a substantial deterioration of reselling prices. Hence, in the paper we contend that the cost incurred for remanufacturing a product should take explicit account {{of the impact of}} long delays in the lead time. Both theoretical and simulation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the Restless Bandit approach deployed to the dynamic routing of product returns among multiple vendors...|$|E
40|$|A {{procedure}} is proposed to functionally decompose an already existing integrated mechanical jet engine subsystem. An integrated sub {{system is a}} system where the same design object satisfies multiple functions: which is typically the case in aircraft engine sub systems and components. A generic decomposition method will allow implementation and use in automated design systems and will function {{as a means to}} build experiences into platforms. Using the procedure, an enhanced function-means tree (E F-M tree) consisting of functional requirements, means to satisfy the requirements and constraints was created for the integrated jet engine component. The E F-M tree is then used to generate a hierarchy of configurable components (CCs). A configurable component (CC) is a stand-alone conceptual object that contains the functional requirement, means to satisfy the requirement (or design solution) and constraints at a certain level of the E F-M tree. A specific CC hierarchy configuration results in the description of the <b>product</b> <b>concerned.</b> The usage of the CC hierarchy as design documentation as well as a template to derive other designs from is demonstrated. Finally limitations of describing product functional requirements using CC method and recommendations for further development of the method are discussed...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe China-Raw Materials dispute {{recently}} arbitrated by the WTO opposed China as defendant to the US, the EU and Mexico as the claimants on {{the somewhat}} unusual issue of export restrictions on natural resources. For the claimants, Chinese export restrictions on various raw materials, {{of which the}} country is a major producer, create shortages in foreign markets increasing the prices of these goods. China defends export limitations by presenting them as a natural resource conserving policy. This paper offers a theoretical analysis of the dispute {{with the help of}} a model of a monopoly extracting a non-renewable resource and selling it on both the domestic and foreign markets. The theoretical results focus on the effects of imposing an export quota on quantities, prices and price distortion. Given the crucial importance of demand elasticities in this theoretical understanding of the conflict, the empirical part of the paper provides estimates of import demand elasticity of the parties for each <b>product</b> <b>concerned</b> in the case. The model and the empirical results challenge the ideas that an export quota always favors conservation of natural resource, that a higher foreign price necessarily follows this policy and that it inherently increases price distortion and therefore discrimination...|$|E
40|$|In this study, Heckler & Childers' (1992) {{two-dimensional}} {{conceptualization of}} incongruity is employed {{and related to}} the different schemas that consumers use in ad processing. Consumers can relate advertising to expectations about ads for the <b>product</b> <b>concerned</b> from the ad schema or to brand-related expectations from the brand schema. If an ad is incongruent with the brand schema, consumer responses to incongruity do not only reflect expectancy of the ad, but also involve determining relevancy to the brand, consistent with the two-dimensional conceptualization of incongruity. However, if an ad is incongruent with the ad schema consumers will only react to the expectancy dimension of incongruity. Therefore, {{these two types of}} incongruity have different consequences in terms of consumer evaluation, processing and categorization. We find that incongruity with the ad schema mainly has affective consequences. Ads that are incongruent with the ad schema lead to more arousal and consequently more favorable ad evaluations than ads that are congruent with the ad schema. Incongruity with the brand schema has predominantly cognitive consequences. Ads that are incongruent with the brand schema lead to more extensive processing than ads that are congruent with the brand schema. Brand beliefs and categorization change as a result of incongruent advertising information. experiments;information processing;Advertising;congruency;schema theory...|$|E
