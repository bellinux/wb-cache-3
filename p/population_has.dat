5|$|One local author {{argued that}} despite the {{population}} apparently remaining relatively static during the 1970s, Coatbridge's <b>population</b> <b>has</b> declined by around 15,000 due to emigration.|$|E
50|$|In 2008, 98 {{percent of}} the <b>population</b> <b>had</b> access to an {{improved}} water source. Ninety-six {{percent of the}} <b>population</b> <b>have</b> access to improved sanitation facilities.|$|R
50|$|In 2004, 89% of the <b>population</b> <b>had</b> running water; it was {{forecast}} {{that the}} number would raise to 95% by 2006.

5|$|A {{small group}} of wild red-billed chough arrived {{naturally}} in Cornwall in 2001, and nested in the following year. This was the first English breeding record since 1947, and a slowly expanding <b>population</b> <b>has</b> bred every subsequent year.|$|E
5|$|African Americans are {{the largest}} racial {{minority}} in Texas.

50|$|Prior to the 1992 War, Georgians made {{up nearly}} half of Abkhazia's {{population}}, while less than one-fifth {{of the population was}} Abkhaz. In contrast, in 1926 the two populations were nearly balanced at around one-third each, with Russians, Armenians and Greeks constituting the remainder. Large-scale immigration of Georgians, Russians and Armenians allowed their respective populations to balloon; while the Abkhaz <b>population</b> <b>had</b> not even doubled by 1989, the Georgian <b>population</b> <b>had</b> nearly quadrupled from 67,494 to 239,872, the Armenian <b>population</b> <b>had</b> tripled and the Russian <b>population</b> <b>had</b> sextupled.|$|R

5|$|Ethiopia: In Ethiopia, {{where the}} size of the {{elephant}} <b>population</b> <b>has</b> decreased by 90% since the 1980s, officials issued a National Ivory Action Plan to address poaching and ivory trafficking. Among other strategies, the Plan includes the publicized destruction of seized ivory. The first such event took place in March 2015, in Addis Ababa, where the Ethiopian Wildlife Conservation Authority's 6.1-ton stockpile was burned.|$|E
5|$|In 2011 however, {{there was}} a massive {{population}} increase from 7,299 a decade earlier to 8,908. The ethnic minority <b>population</b> <b>has</b> also increased from being 96.6% White British in 2001 to 92.3% in 2011.|$|E

5|$|Indonesia's <b>population</b> <b>has</b> been {{increasing}} rapidly since the 1815 eruption, reaching 222 million in 2006, of which 130 million were living on Java. A new volcanic eruption {{as large as}} 1815 probably would cause catastrophic devastation with many more fatalities.|$|E
5|$|Infrastructure in Hyogo {{was also}} {{significantly}} {{damaged by the}} earthquake. The underground Daikai Station collapsed and brought down National Route 28 that runs above it. The loss of lives and infrastructure saw Hyogo lose {{a significant portion of}} its population; the ward's <b>population</b> <b>has</b> failed to return to its 1994 level twenty years later.|$|E
5|$|It is fair {{to assume}} that the average Joe/Jane is neither a college {{graduate}} nor a high school drop-out. It is, however, difficult {{to determine whether or not}} the average American has some college education as the population is split between those who did and did not attend college. Over the past half century the educational attainment of the US <b>population</b> <b>has</b> significantly increased.|$|E

5|$|Many escapees from captivity {{can also}} be found in similar watery {{habitats}} around the world. Sightings are fairly common in Florida, although a breeding <b>population</b> <b>has</b> not yet been confirmed. In 2011, one specimen was spotted in the Central Coast of California.|$|E
5|$|Only a {{few small}} populations of B.acanthopoda exist.

5|$|Over {{the recent}} years, the house sparrow <b>population</b> <b>has</b> {{been on the}} decline in many Asian countries, and this decline is quite evident in India. To promote the {{conservation}} of these birds, in 2012, the house sparrow was declared as the state bird of Delhi.|$|E
50|$|In 1936, Electra had {{well over}} 6,000 residents, by the 1960s, the <b>population</b> <b>had</b> {{decreased}} {{to just over}} 5,000. The Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex was growing, and many people moved away. By 2000, Electra's <b>population</b> <b>had</b> fallen to about 3,000.|$|R
