50|$|Though {{the steam}} engine and {{transmission}} system {{have now been}} removed, the plan and construction of the mill reveal their former location. Most of the original saws and ancillary equipment are also intact though modified to accommodate electric power. Extant saws include Canadian, frame, number one and <b>pendulum</b> docking <b>saws</b> arranged to allow efficient movement of the logs through the mill.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} {{layout of}} the mill has been largely preserved and follows the basic design principles for steam powered sawmills of the era. The break-down saws, comprising a frame saw and large circular saw were designed to make the initial cuts along the logs to create long slices of timber ('flitches'). These saws are located close to where the logs entered the mill near a loading platform {{at the side of}} the shed. The number one and the <b>pendulum</b> docking <b>saws</b> which converted the flitches into boards of the required cross-section and length are located further inside the shed. A small room for sharpening saws is built into a corner of the main shed.|$|R
