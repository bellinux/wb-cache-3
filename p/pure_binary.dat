2500|$|Most pocket calculators do {{all their}} {{calculations}} in BCD {{rather than a}} floating-point representation. [...] BCD is common in electronic systems where a numeric value is to be displayed, especially in systems consisting solely of digital logic, and not containing a microprocessor. By employing BCD, the manipulation of numerical data for display can be greatly simplified by treating each digit as a separate single sub-circuit. This matches much more closely the physical reality of display hardware—a designer might choose to use a series of separate identical seven-segment displays to build a metering circuit, for example. If the numeric quantity were stored and manipulated as <b>pure</b> <b>binary,</b> interfacing to such a display would require complex circuitry. Therefore, {{in cases where the}} calculations are relatively simple, working throughout with BCD can lead to a simpler overall system than converting to and from binary.|$|E

The {{behavior of the}} pure stationary phases (OV- 3, OV- 225, OV- 61 -OH, and OV- 1701 -OH) and the binary stationary phases (OV- 3 /OV- 225 and OV- 61 -OH/OV- 1701 -OH) at different temperatures (608 C– 1008 C) is investigated with factor and topological analysis. The influence of temperature {{and the nature of}} the mixed stationary phases on the retention indices is studied by correspondence factor analysis (CFA). The non-addi-tivity of the retention properties of the pure phases used as mixed phases is clearly established by CFA. The topological analysis of the substituent’s effect is investigated with a DARC/PELCO proced-ure and shows the particular influence of the stationary phase com-position on the retention. The substituent effect is measured for the <b>pure</b> and <b>binary</b> stationary phases at various temperatures. The evo-lution of the substituent effect from the pure stationary phases to the binary phases is discussed...|$|R

Danesh [9] and Michelsen [14] agree that the Helmholtz energy formulation would yield simpler equations that will enhance easier solutions. We note here that this is true for stability analysis testing for <b>pure</b> compounds and <b>binary</b> systems but would likely, as indicated by Modell and Reid [15], become more complex with mixtures.

50|$|FIX {{messages}} are formed {{from a number}} of fields; each field is a tag value pairing that is separated from the next field by a delimiter SOH (0x01). The tag is an integer that indicates the meaning of the field. The value is an array of bytes that hold a specific meaning for the particular tag (e.g. tag 48 is securityID, a string that identifies the security; tag 22 is IDSource, an integer that indicates the identifier class being used). The values may be in plain text or encoded as <b>pure</b> <b>binary</b> (in which case the value is preceded by a length field).

50|$|Single crystal {{epitaxial}} {{films of}} InGaAs can be deposited {{on a single}} crystal substrate of III-V semiconductor having a lattice parameter close {{to that of the}} specific gallium indium arsenide alloy to be synthesized. Three substrates can be used: GaAs, InAs and InP. A good match between the lattice constants of the film and substrate is required to maintain single crystal properties and this limitation permits small variations in composition on the order of a few per cent. Therefore, the properties of epitaxial films of GaInAs alloys grown on GaAs are very similar to GaAs and those grown on InAs are very similar to InAs, because lattice mismatch strain does not generally permit significant deviation of the composition from the <b>pure</b> <b>binary</b> substrate.|$|E

50|$|The {{invention}} in {{this case}} was a method of programming a general-purpose digital computer using an algorithm to convert binary-coded decimal numbers into <b>pure</b> <b>binary</b> numbers. The Supreme Court noted that phenomena of nature, mental processes and abstract intellectual concepts were not patentable, since they were the basic tools of scientific and technological work. However, new and useful inventions derived from such discoveries are patentable. The Court found that the discovery in Benson was unpatentable since the invention, an algorithm, was no more than abstract mathematics. Despite this holding, the Court emphasized that its decision did not preclude computer software from being patented, but rather precluded the patentability of software where the only useful characteristic was an algorithm. The Court further noted that validating this type of patent would foreclose all future use of the algorithm in question. Therefore, like the traditional exceptions to patentable subject matter, the purpose of the algorithm exception was to encourage development of new technologies by not granting patents that would preclude others from using abstract mathematical principles.|$|E

The sensitivities to changes in the NT solvent nucleophilicity scale and the YCl solvent ionizing power scale, and the kF/kCl values are very similar to those for solvolyses of n-octyl fluoroformate, consistent with the addition step of an addition-elimination pathway being rate-determining. For methanolysis, a solvent deuterium isotope effect of 3. 10 is compatible with the incorporation of general-base catalysis into the substitution process. For five representative solvents, studies were made at several temperatures and activation parameters determined.
