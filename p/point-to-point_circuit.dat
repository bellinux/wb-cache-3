50|$|In hubs and switches, a hub {{provides}} a point-to-multipoint (or simply multipoint) circuit which divides the total bandwidth {{supplied by the}} hub among each connected client node.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} simulation experiments {{investigating the}} feasibility {{and cost of}} providing survivability to ATM multipoint groups using dedicated bandwidth on disjoint backup groups. Disjoint dedicated backup groups are formed via the VC Mesh model by two different approaches: (1) a backup group consisting exclusively of <b>point-to-point</b> <b>circuits</b> (unicast), or (2) a backup group consisting exclusively of point-to-multipoint circuits (multicast). Results for the two networks studied show that although backup groups of point-to-multipoint circuits (multicast) are lower in cost than backup groups of <b>point-to-point</b> <b>circuits</b> (unicast) at a 95 % confidence level, the feasibility of providing guaranteed survivability with backup groups via either approach begins at only about 50 % for a group size of three and decreases rapidly for larger group sizes due to multipoint "trap" topologies and hop-limit constraints. The conclusion is that while use of disjoint dedicated backup groups for ATM mult [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers' new 802. 16 standard {{is set to}} revolutionize the delivery of Broadband Wireless Access (BWA), much as the 802. 11 "Wi-Fi" standard transformed wireless access to Local Area Networks. The standard describes a set of Medium Access Controls (MAC) and Air Interfaces that cover {{a broad range of}} broadcast frequencies and applications. As a result, manufacturers are developing 802. 16 compliant equipment for high speed <b>point-to-point</b> <b>circuits</b> and point-to-multipoint circuits dubbed Wireless Metropolitan Area Networks (WMANs). These networks can span several miles and contain hundreds of subscribers. Shortly after 802. 11 "Wi-Fi" systems became widespread, several serious Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerabilities inherent to the standard were discovered. This thesis examines the MAC layer of the 802. 16 standard to determine whether these types of denial of service vulnerabilities are also present in the new standard. Also examined are vulnerabilities that may be unique to the 802. 16 standard. Lieutenant, United States Nav...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{historical}} {{development of the}} need for synchronization and syntonization in secure communications networks. After laying the historical background, the author looks at the current state of Master Station clocks in these networks and the issues {{that need to be addressed}} in formulating a timing architecture to support a large global communications network. Some of the issues discussed are stabilily, accuracy, reference sources, and injection of timing into several communication technologies. The paper also looks at the parts of a master station clock and their relationship to various entities in a telecommunication circuit. DEVELOPMENT OF TIMING FOR SECURE NETWORKS Before the advent of modern communication networks, the majority of the Department of Defense (DoD) communication links were simple <b>point-to-point</b> <b>circuits</b> consisting of a pair of encryption devices and possibly a time division multiplexer (TDM). The circuit paths were terrestrial, and the speed of the circuits was typically 9600 baud or less. Timing was not a major concern.

50|$|Whilst {{there are}} several {{technologies}} that are superficially similar to the PSDN, such as Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) and the Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) technologies, they are not examples of it.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} building cost-effective networks which are robust to dynamic changes in demand patterns. We compare several architectures based on using demandoblivious routing strategies. Traditional approaches include single-hop architectures based on a (static or dynamic) circuitswitched core infrastructure, and multi-hop (packet-switched) architectures based on <b>point-to-point</b> <b>circuits</b> in the core. To address demand uncertainty, we seek minimum cost networks that can carry the class of hose demand matrices. Apart from shortest-path routing, Valiant’s randomized load balancing (RLB), and VPN tree routing, we propose a third, highly attractive approach: selective randomized load balancing (SRLB). This {{is a blend of}} dual-hop hub routing and randomized load balancing which combines the advantages of both architectures in terms of network cost, delay, and delay jitter. In particular, we give empirical analyses for the cost (in terms of transport and switching equipment) for the discussed architectures, based on three representative carrier networks. On these three networks, SRLB maintains the resilience properties of RLB while achieving significant cost reduction over all other architectures, including RLB and multi-hop IP/MPLS networks using VPN tree routing...|$|R
50|$|Packet over SONET/SDH, {{abbreviated}} POS, is {{a communications}} protocol for transmitting packets {{in the form}} of the Point to Point Protocol (PPP) over SDH or SONET, which are both standard protocols for communicating digital information using lasers or light emitting diodes (LEDs) over optical fibre at high line rates. POS is defined by RFC 2615 as PPP over SONET/SDH. PPP is the Point to Point Protocol that was designed as a standard method of communicating over point-to-point links. Since SONET/SDH utilises <b>point-to-point</b> <b>circuits,</b> PPP is well suited for use over these links. Scrambling is performed during insertion of the PPP packets into the SONET/SDH frame to solve various security attacks including denial-of-service attacks and the imitation of SONET/SDH alarms. This modification was justified as cost-effective because the scrambling algorithm was already used by the standard used to transport ATM cells over SONET/SDH. However, scrambling can optionally be disabled to allow a node to be compatible with another node that uses the now obsoleted RFC 1619 version of Packet over SONET/SDH which lacks the scrambler.|$|R
40|$|Tactical network {{designers}} {{are faced with}} difficult protocol choices. A common choice available is a Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA) network. For example, in designing the U. S. Army's Lower Tactical Internet (TI), Enhanced Position Location Reporting System (EPLRS) CSMA is often considered for alternative uses. There are many benefits to using CSMA; it generally requires less planning then preassigned <b>point-to-point</b> <b>circuits</b> and is efficient for dissemination of multicast or broadcast traffic. Its drawback compared to pre-assigned circuits is network contention leading to access delays and collisions. It also does not guarantee reliability. When making decisions on {{when and how to}} employ CSMA style networks, it is easy to rely on theoretical CSMA analysis to estimate performance for different loading levels. However, the assumptions made by these analyses are often inconsistent with the actual implementation of the radio systems and with the nature of battlefield networks. This paper, using EPLRS CSMA networks in the TI, identifies these differences, and evaluates the potential impact that using incorrect assumptions may have on network design. It also discusses network simulation as an alternative for quantifying these differences...|$|R

In its reliable mode, the service offers error, flow, and rate-controlled multidestination delivery of arbitrary-sized messages, with provision for the coordination of reliable reverse channels.
