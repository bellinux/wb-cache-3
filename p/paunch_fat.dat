6000|$|The old Colonel bent to {{his work}} with studied abstraction, and even when Amos said, judicially, after long scrutiny: [...] "Yes, he'll soon be as bald as a plate," [...] he only lifted one yellow, freckled, bony hand, and brushed his carroty growth of hair across the spot under discussion. Gordon shook his <b>fat</b> <b>paunch</b> in silent laughter, nearly {{displacing}} the board.|$|R
6000|$|... "In {{exterior}} he {{resembled a}} butcher {{in a poor}} neighborhood, and his eyes had a look of sleepy cunning. He carried his <b>fat</b> <b>paunch</b> with ostentation on his short legs, and during the time his gang infested the station spoke to no one but his nephew. You could see these two roaming about all day long with their heads close together in an everlasting confab.|$|R
6000|$|... "Grandfather!" [...] shrieked Essper; [...] "what a {{wonderful}} grandfather yours must have been! All my tricks are fresh from Fairyland this morning. Grandfather, indeed! Pray, {{is this your}} grandfather?" [...] and here the conjuror, leaning over the table, with a rapid catch drew out from the <b>fat</b> <b>paunch</b> of the judge a long grinning wooden figure, with great staring eyes, and the parrot nose of a pulcinello. The laugh which followed this sleight-of-hand was loud, long, and universal. The judge lost his temper; and Essper George took the opportunity of the confusion to drink off the glass of Rudesheimer which stood, as we have mentioned, ready charged, at the magistrate's elbow.|$|R
60|$|But {{apart from}} these extravagant {{expressions}} of good feeling, Borabolla was {{the prince of}} good fellows. His great tun of a person was indispensable to the housing of his bullock-heart; under which, any lean wight would have sunk. But alas! unlike Media and Taji, Borabolla, though a crowned king, was accounted no demi-god; his obesity excluding him from that honor. Indeed, in some quarters of Mardi, certain pagans maintain, that no fat man can be even immortal. A dogma! truly, which should be thrown to the dogs. For fat men are the salt and savor of the earth; full of good humor, high spirits, fun, {{and all manner of}} jollity. Their breath clears the atmosphere: their exhalations air the world. Of men, they are the good measures; brimmed, heaped, pressed down, piled up, and running over. They are as ships from Teneriffe; swimming deep, full of old wine, and twenty steps down into their holds. Soft and susceptible, all round they are easy of entreaty. Wherefore, for all their rotundity, they are too often circumnavigated by hatchet-faced knaves. Ah! a fat uncle, with a <b>fat</b> <b>paunch,</b> and a <b>fat</b> purse, is a joy and a delight to all nephews; to philosophers, a subject of endless speculation, as to how many droves of oxen and Lake Eries of wine might have run through his great mill during the full term of his mortal career. Fat men not immortal! This very instant, old Lambert is rubbing his jolly abdomen in Paradise.|$|R
60|$|The {{advanced}} {{lines of}} the two contending armies were now in presence--the National Guard of Orleans and the Irish Brigade. The white belts and <b>fat</b> <b>paunches</b> of the Guard presented a terrific appearance; but {{it might have been}} remarked by the close observer, that their faces were as white as their belts, and the long line of their bayonets might be seen to quiver. General Odillon Barrot, with a cockade as large as a pancake, endeavored to make a speech: the words honneur, patrie, Francais, champ de bataille might be distinguished; but the General was dreadfully flustered, and was evidently more at home in the Chamber of Deputies than in the field of war.|$|R
5000|$|Demetrius of Alopece (Δημήτριος), was a Greek {{sculptor}} of {{the early}} part of the 4th century BC, who is said by ancient critics to have been notable for the lifelike realism of his statues. His portrait of Pellichus, a Corinthian general, [...] "with <b>fat</b> <b>paunch</b> and bald head, wearing a cloak which leaves him half exposed, with some of the hairs of his head flowing in the wind, and prominent veins", was admired by Lucian. He was contrasted with Cresilas, an idealizing sculptor of the generation before. Since however the peculiarities mentioned by Lucian do not appear in Greek portraits before the 3rd century BC and since the Greek art of the 4th century consistently idealizes, there would seem to be a difficulty to explain.|$|R
40|$|Anaerobic {{co-digestion}} {{has been}} widely investigated, but there is limited analysis of interaction between substrates. The objective of this work {{was to assess the}} role of carbohydrates, protein and lipids in co-digestion behaviour separately, and together. Two sets of batch tests were done, each set consisting of the mono-digestion of three substrates, and the co-digestion of seven mixtures. The first was done with pure substrates [...] cellulose, casein and olive oil [...] while in the second slaughterhouse waste [...] <b>paunch,</b> blood and <b>fat</b> [...] were used as carbohydrate, protein and lipid sources, respectively. Synergistic effects were mainly improvement of process kinetics without a significant change in biodegradability. Kinetics improvement was linked to the mitigation of inhibitory compounds, particularly fats dilution. The exception was co-digestion of paunch with lipids, which resulted in an improved final yield with model based analysis indicating the presence of paunch improved degradability of the fatty feed...|$|R
6000|$|There's none, I'm sure, who is {{a friend}} to love, [...] But will our Friar's {{character}} approve: [...] The ablest spark among you sometimes needs [...] Such pious help, for charitable deeds. [...] Our church, alas! (as Rome objects) does want [...] These ghostly comforts for the falling saint: [...] This gains them their whore-converts, and may be [...] One reason {{of the growth of}} popery. [...] So Mahomet's religion came in fashion, [...] By the large leave it gave to fornication. [...] Fear not the guilt, if you can pay for't well; [...] There is no Dives in the Roman Hell: [...] Gold opens the strait gate, and lets him in; [...] But want of money is a mortal sin. [...] For all besides you may discount to heaven, [...] And drop a bead to keep the tallies even. [...] How are men cozened still with shows of good! [...] The bawd's best mask is the grave friar's hood; [...] Though vice no more a clergyman displeases, [...] Than doctors can be thought to hate diseases. [...] 'Tis by your living ill, that they live well, [...] By your debauches, their <b>fat</b> <b>paunches</b> swell. [...] 'Tis a mock-war between the priest and devil; [...] When they think fit, they can be very civil. [...] As some, who did French counsels most advance, [...] To blind the world, have railed in print at France, [...] Thus do the clergy at your vices bawl, [...] That with more ease they may engross them all. [...] By damning yours, they do their own maintain; [...] A churchman's godliness is always gain: [...] Hence to their prince they will superior be; [...] And civil treason grows church loyalty. [...] They boast the gift of heaven is in their power; [...] Well may they give the god, they can devour! [...] Still to the sick and dead their claims they lay; [...] For 'tis on carrion that the vermin prey. [...] Nor have they less dominion on our life, [...] They trot the husband, and they pace the wife. [...] Rouse up, you cuckolds of the northern climes, [...] And learn from Sweden to prevent such crimes. [...] Unman the Friar, and leave the holy drone [...] To hum in his forsaken hive alone; [...] He'll work no honey, when his sting is gone. [...] Your wives and daughters soon will leave the cells, [...] When they have lost the sound of Aaron's bells.|$|R
6000|$|... "You may agree," [...] wrote Andre-Louis from Paris to Le Chapelier, in {{a letter}} which survives, [...] "that {{it is to be}} regretted I should {{definitely}} have discarded the livery of Scaramouche, since clearly there could be no livery fitter for my wear. It seems to be my part always to stir up strife and then to slip away before I am caught in the crash of the warring elements I have aroused. It is a humiliating reflection. I seek consolation in the reminder of Epictetus (do you ever read Epictetus?) that we are but actors in a play of such a part as it may please the Director to assign us. It does not, however, console me to have been cast for a part so contemptible, to find myself excelling ever in the art of running away. But if I am not brave, at least I am prudent; so that where I lack one virtue I may lay claim to possessing another almost to excess. On a previous occasion they wanted to hang me for sedition. Should I have stayed to be hanged? This time they may want to hang me for several things, including murder; for I do not know whether that scoundrel Binet be alive or dead from the dose of lead I pumped into his <b>fat</b> <b>paunch.</b> Nor can I say that I very greatly care. If I have a hope at all in the matter it is that he is dead--and damned. But I am really indifferent. My own concerns are troubling me enough. I have all but spent the little money that I contrived to conceal about me before I fled from Nantes on that dreadful night; and both of the only two professions of which I can claim to know anything--the law and the stage--are closed to me, since I cannot find employment in either without revealing myself as a fellow who is urgently wanted by the hangman. As things are it is very possible that I may die of hunger, especially considering the present price of victuals in this ravenous city. Again I have recourse to Epictetus for comfort. 'It is better,' he says, 'to die of hunger having lived without grief and fear, than to live with a troubled spirit amid abundance.' I seem likely to perish in the estate that he accounts so enviable. That it does not seem exactly enviable to me merely proves that as a Stoic I am not a success." ...|$|R
6000|$|An aged {{man went}} round the infernal vault, Urging his workmen to their ceaseless task: White were his locks, {{as is the}} wintry snow On hoar Plinlimmon's head. A golden staff His steps supported; {{powerful}} talisman, Which whoso feels shall never feel again The tear of Pity, or the throb of Love. Touch'd but by this, the massy gates give way, The buttress trembles, and the guarded wall, Guarded in vain, submits. Him heathens erst Had deified, and bowed the suppliant knee To Plutus. Nor are now his votaries few, Tho' he the Blessed Teacher of mankind Hath said, that easier thro' the needle's eye Shall the huge camel [1] pass, than the rich man Enter the gates of heaven. [...] "Ye cannot serve Your God, and worship Mammon." [...] "Missioned Maid!" [...] So spake the Angel, [...] "know that these, whose hands Round each white furnace ply the unceasing toil, Were Mammon's slaves on earth. They did not spare To wring from Poverty the hard-earn'd mite, They robb'd the orphan's pittance, they could see Want's asking eye unmoved; and therefore these, Ranged round the furnace, still must persevere In Mammon's service; scorched by these fierce fires, And frequent deluged by the o'erboiling ore: Yet still so framed, that oft to quench their thirst Unquenchable, large draughts of molten [2] gold They drink insatiate, still with pain renewed, Pain to destroy." [...] So saying, her he led Forth from the dreadful cavern to a cell, Brilliant with gem-born light. The rugged walls Part gleam'd with gold, and part with silver ore A milder radiance shone. The Carbuncle There its strong lustre like the flamy sun Shot forth irradiate; from the earth beneath, And from the roof a diamond light emits; Rubies and amethysts their glows commix'd With the gay topaz, and the softer ray Shot from the sapphire, and the emerald's hue, And bright pyropus. [...] There on golden seats, A numerous, sullen, melancholy train Sat silent. [...] "Maiden, these," [...] said Theodore, Are they who let the love of wealth absorb All other passions; in their souls that vice Struck deeply-rooted, like the poison-tree That with its shade spreads barrenness around. These, Maid! were men by no atrocious crime Blacken'd, no fraud, nor ruffian violence: Men of fair dealing, and respectable On earth, but such as only for themselves Heap'd up their treasures, deeming all their wealth Their own, and given to them, by partial Heaven, To bless them only: therefore here they sit, Possessed of gold enough, and by no pain Tormented, save {{the knowledge of the}} bliss They lost, and vain repentance. Here they dwell, Loathing these useless treasures, till the hour Of general restitution." [...] Thence they past, And now arrived at such a gorgeous dome, As even the pomp of Eastern opulence Could never equal: wandered thro' its halls A numerous train; some with the red-swoln eye Of riot, and intemperance-bloated cheek; Some pale and nerveless, and with feeble step, And eyes lack-lustre. [...] Maiden? said her guide, These are the wretched slaves of Appetite, Curst with their wish enjoyed. The epicure Here pampers his foul frame, till the pall'd sense Loaths at the banquet; the voluptuous here Plunge in the tempting torrent of delight, And sink in misery. All they wish'd on earth, Possessing here, whom have they to accuse, But their own folly, for the lot they chose? Yet, for that these injured themselves alone, They to the house of PENITENCE may hie, And, by a long and painful regimen, To wearied Nature her exhausted powers Restore, till they shall learn to form the wish Of wisdom, and ALMIGHTY GOODNESS grants That prize to him who seeks it." [...] Whilst he spake, The board is spread. With bloated <b>paunch,</b> and eye <b>Fat</b> swoln, and legs whose monstrous size disgraced The human form divine, their caterer, Hight GLUTTONY, set forth the smoaking feast. And by his side came on a brother form, With fiery cheek of purple hue, and red And scurfy-white, mix'd motley; his gross bulk, Like some huge hogshead shapen'd, as applied. Him had antiquity with mystic rites Ador'd, to him the sons of Greece, and thine Imperial Rome, on many an altar pour'd The victim blood, with godlike titles graced, BACCHUS, or DIONUSUS; son of JOVE, Deem'd falsely, for from FOLLY'S ideot form He sprung, what time MADNESS, with furious hand, Seiz'd on the laughing female. At one birth She brought the brethren, menial here, above Reigning with sway supreme, and oft they hold High revels: mid the Monastery's gloom, The sacrifice is spread, when the grave voice Episcopal, proclaims approaching day Of visitation, or Churchwardens meet To save the wretched many from the gripe Of eager Poverty, or mid thy halls Of London, mighty Mayor! rich Aldermen, Of coming feast hold converse. [...] Otherwhere, For tho' allied in nature as in blood, They hold divided sway, his brother lifts His spungy sceptre. In the noble domes Of Princes, and state-wearied Ministers, Maddening he reigns; and when the affrighted mind Casts o'er a long career of guilt and blood Its eye reluctant, then his aid is sought To lull the worm of Conscience to repose. He too the halls of country Squires frequents, But chiefly loves the learned gloom that shades Thy offspring Rhedycina! and thy walls, Granta! nightly libations there to him Profuse are pour'd, till from the dizzy brain Triangles, Circles, Parallelograms, Moods, Tenses, Dialects, and Demigods, And Logic and Theology are swept By the red deluge. [...] Unmolested there He reigns; till comes at length the general feast, Septennial sacrifice; then when the sons Of England meet, with watchful care to chuse Their delegates, wise, independent men, Unbribing and unbrib'd, and cull'd to guard Their rights and charters from the encroaching grasp Of greedy Power: then all the joyful land Join in his sacrifices, so inspir'd To make the important choice. [...] The observing Maid Address'd her guide, [...] "These Theodore, thou sayest Are men, who pampering their foul appetites, Injured themselves alone. But where are they, The worst of villains, viper-like, who coil Around the guileless female, so to sting The heart that loves them?" [...] "Them," [...] the spirit replied, A long and dreadful punishment awaits. For when the prey of want and infamy, Lower and lower still the victim sinks, Even to the depth of shame, not one lewd word, One impious imprecation from her lips Escapes, nay not a thought of evil lurks In the polluted mind, that does not plead Before the throne of Justice, thunder-tongued Against the foul Seducer." [...] Now they reach'd The house of PENITENCE. CREDULITY Stood at the gate, stretching her eager head As tho' to listen; on her vacant face, A smile that promis'd premature assent; Tho' her REGRET behind, a meagre Fiend, Disciplin'd sorely. [...] Here they entered in, And now arrived where, as in study tranced, She sat, the Mistress of the Dome. Her face Spake that composed severity, that knows No angry impulse, no weak tenderness, Resolved and calm. Before her lay that Book That hath the words of Life; and as she read, Sometimes a tear would trickle down her cheek, Tho' heavenly joy beam'd in her eye the while.|$|R
