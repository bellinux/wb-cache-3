40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a new technique}} to identify a 2 D mask showing the extent of <b>particulate</b> <b>aerosol</b> distributions in satellite imagery. This technique uses a supervised texture classication approach, and utilises data from two distinct satellite sources. The vertical feature mask (VFM) product from the CALIPSO lidar, provides an accurate description of the aerosol content of the atmosphere but has a limited footprint and coverage. The CALIPSO VFM is used to provide training data in order to for classiers {{to be applied to}} other imagery, namely data from the spinning enhanced visible and infrared imager (SEVIRI) on the MSG satellite. The output from the classication is a 2 D mask representing the locations of the <b>particulate</b> <b>aerosol</b> of interest within the SEVIRI image. This approach has been demonstrated on test cases over land and ocean, and shows a good agreement with other techniques for the detection of <b>particulate</b> <b>aerosol.</b> However, the supervised texture approach provides outputs at a higher resolution than the existing methods and the same approach is applicable over land and ocean and therefore shows the advantages compared to the current techniques. Furthermore, the coverage of the approach can be further extended using signature extension and chain classication. Signature extension was applied to one of the test cases to monitor the same geographical region with temporal extension away from the initial supervised classication. The experiments showed {{that it was possible to}} extend the coverage for ± 90 minutes from the original classication and indicates the possibility of greater extension over larger temporal windows.

For while greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions lead to a positive climate forcing and hence rising global mean surface temperature, parallel emission of <b>particulate</b> <b>aerosol</b> species does much the opposite, in parallel to their deleterious effects as local air pollutants. Through direct radiative interaction with incoming sunlight and complex indirect microphysical effects on cloud, anthropogenic aerosols exert a significant negative forcing — a counteracting cooling influence.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Total number of airborne particles was determined in four different size classes (0. 3 - 0. 5, 0. 5 - 1, 1 - 5 and > 5 microm) by laser particle counting. Time dependent formation of bioaerosols was monitored by culturing methods and by specific staining followed by flow cytometry. Besides handling of regular mail, specially prepared letters ('spiked letters') {{were added to}} the mailbags to deliberately release powdered materials from letters and to simulate high impact loads. These letters contained various dry powdered biological and nonbiological materials such as milk powder, mushrooms, herbs and cat litter. Regarding the four size classes, <b>particulate</b> <b>aerosol</b> composition before mail handling was determined as 83. 2 +/- 1. 0, 15. 2 +/- 0. 7, 1. 7 +/- 0. 4 and 0. 04 +/- 0. 02 %, respectively, whereas the composition changed during sorting to 66. 8 +/- 7. 9, 22. 3 +/- 3. 6, 10. 4 +/- 4. 0 and 0. 57 +/- 0. 27 %, respectively.

Both approaches produced good agreement with experiments, and the transitional RANS approach is selected for the multiphase simulations of aerosols transport, because of significantly lower computational costs. The local and total deposition efficiency are calculated for different classes of pharmaceutical particles (in the 0. 1 µm ≤ d p ≤ 10 µm range) without and with a paramagnetic core (the shell–core particles). For the latter, an external magnetic field is imposed. The source of the imposed magnetic field was placed in the proximity of the first bronchial bifurcation.

We have analysed the blood, air and aerosol with respect to 13 perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs), 4 perfluorosulfonic acids (PFSAs), 3 fluorotelomer alcohols (FTOHs), 3 fluorotelomer acids (FTCAs) and 3 unsaturated fluorotelomer acids (FTUCAs). Further, we assessed the exposure to 3 <b>particulate</b> <b>aerosol</b> fractions (inhalable, respirable and total aerosol) in air. In comparison to a general population, several of the PFCA blood levels are elevated in the technicians’, primarily  erfluorooctanoate (PFOA) and perfluorononate (PFNA) with concentrations up to 628 and 163 ng/mL wb, respectively. Further,  we detected FTUCAs and FTCAs in the blood, suggesting biotransformation of FTOHs to PFCAs. The metabolites 5 : 3 and 7 : 3 FTCA were detected in all blood samples at levels up to 6. 1 and 3. 9 ng/mL wb. Levels of perfluorohexadecanoic acid PFHxDA) and perfluorooctadecanoic acid (PFOcDA) were detected in the technician’s blood at mean concentration up to 4. 22 ng/mL wb and 4. 25 ng/mL wb. The FTOH levels in air of the wax cabin during work ranged up to 997 000 ng/m 3 (average= 114 000 ng/m 3) and PFOA up to 4 890 ng/m 3 (average= 526 ng/m 3. FTOHs were not detected in aerosols but PFOA showed average levels of 12 000 ng/m 3 (range= 1 230 - 46 900 ng/m 3). The occupational exposure limit (OEL) of 2 mg/m 3 was exceeded in 37 % of the personal measurements with aerosol  concentrations up to 15 mg/m 3.

40|$|Deep {{convective}} clouds play a {{key role}} in tropical weather patterns, summertime rainfall, and the global transport of energy from the tropics to higher latitudes. Current weather and climate models struggle to realistically represent the development and behavior of these clouds. Both the timing of the convection and the role of humidity in the environment are often poorly represented in these models. In this thesis, detailed numerical simulations serve as a virtual laboratory where the influence of the environment on cloud formation is investigated. The evaporation of rain is shown to result in a positive feedback loop that causes the clouds to become wider and deeper. These wider and deeper clouds tend to form at preferential locations. Subsequently, the relative influence of the temperature profile and humidity in the environment is systematically explored. A simple model captures the response of the clouds to these conditions. Flow trajectories are used to investigate the mixing between the clouds and their environment in more detail. These trajectories show that in essence clouds consist of rising air that mixes horizontally with the environment. Finally, we show that the presence of small <b>particulates</b> (<b>aerosols)</b> can delay the formation of precipitation, but nevertheless lead to larger accumulated rainfall.

40|$|In {{spite of}} {{accounting}} for 10 - 70 % of the atmospheric aerosol mass, particulate-phase organic compounds {{are not well}} characterised, and many aspects of aerosol formation and evolution are still unknown. The growing awareness {{of the impact of}} <b>particulate</b> <b>aerosols</b> on climate, and the incompletely recognised but serious effects of anthropogenic constituents on air quality and human health, have conducted to several scientific studies. These investigations have provided information about the behaviour of atmospheric particulate matter and the description of the character of its carbonaceous content. The compilation of such results is important as they append to the emergent global-wide dataset of the organic composition of atmospheric aerosols. The contribution of the major emission sources to regional particulate pollution can be diagnosed by using specific molecular markers. This overview is mainly focused on results obtained with gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry, since it is the analytical method of choice in elucidating the solvent-extractable organic compounds in atmospheric particulate matter. A synopsis of the selection of organic tracers and the application of geochemical parameters to the analysis of organic constituents as a tool for source apportionment is shown here. Besides the assessment of current knowledge, this paper also presents the identification of further areas of concern...|$|R
40|$|A laser {{particulate}} spectrometer (LPS) {{system was}} developed to measure the size and speed distributions of <b>particulate</b> (dusts, <b>aerosols,</b> ice particles, etc.) contaminants. Detection of the particulates was achieved by means of light scattering and extinction effects using a single laser beam to cover a size range of 0. 8 to 275 microns diameter and a speed range of 0. 2 to 20 meter/second.
