25|$|After the {{disengagement}} of the autopilot, {{there was}} no control activity of the aircraft wheel for six seconds and the column activity for eight seconds. Captain Noor and First Officer Javid were both in state of confusion and unsure of remedial {{actions to be taken}} {{to get out of the}} unsafe condition. The aircraft <b>pressure</b> <b>altitude</b> and pitch angle were decreased while 160 knots computed airspeed remained maintained.|$|E
25|$|Aircraft flight instruments, however, don't compute true {{airspeed}} {{as a function}} of groundspeed and windspeed. They use impact and static pressures as well as a temperature input. True airspeed is equivalent airspeed that is corrected for <b>pressure</b> <b>altitude</b> and temperature (which define density). The result is the true physical speed of the aircraft relative to the surrounding body of air. At standard sea level conditions, {{true airspeed}}, calibrated airspeed and equivalent airspeed are all equal.|$|E

25|$|On June 19, 1988, from Birigüi (50° 20' W 21° 20' S) at 10:15 UTC {{a balloon}} launch {{occurred}} which carried two NaI(Tl) detectors (600cm2 total area) to an air <b>pressure</b> <b>altitude</b> of 5.5 mb {{for a total}} observation time of 6 hr. The supernova SN1987A in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) was discovered on February 23, 1987, and its progenitor was a blue supergiant, (Sk -69 202), with luminosity of 2-5 x 1038 erg/s. The 847 keV and 1238 keV gamma-ray lines from 56Co decay have been detected.|$|E
500|$|Altitude DCS {{became a}} problem in the 1930s with the {{development}} of high-altitude balloon and aircraft flights but not as great a problem as AMS, which drove the development of pressurized cabins, which coincidentally controlled DCS. Commercial aircraft are now required to maintain the cabin at or below a <b>pressure</b> <b>altitude</b> of [...] even when flying above [...] [...] Symptoms of DCS in healthy individuals are subsequently very rare unless there is a loss of pressurization or the individual has been diving recently. Divers who drive up a mountain or fly shortly after diving are at particular risk even in a pressurized aircraft because the regulatory cabin altitude of [...] represents only 73% of sea level pressure.|$|E
500|$|In {{the fall}} of 1967, the group {{received}} its first Sikorsky HH-53 Super Jolly Green Giant, which were stationed at Udorn Royal Thai Air Force Base. [...] These helicopters improved capabilities over Laos and North Vietnam, since they were faster, could hover at altitudes up to 6,500ft <b>pressure</b> <b>altitude</b> and were armed with three GAU-28/A 7.62mm miniguns. [...] Because of their larger size, HH-53s also carried a second pararescue specialist. [...] However, despite the improved capability provided by the BUFF (as it was called by crewmembers), the unit's night rescue capability remained very limited and night rescue attempts were rarely successful.

500|$|Inherent errors {{may fall}} into several categories, each {{affecting}} different instruments. [...] Density errors affect instruments metering airspeed and altitude. [...] This type of error {{is caused by}} variations of pressure and temperature in the atmosphere. [...] A compressibility error can arise because the impact pressure will cause the air to compress in the pitot tube. At standard sea level <b>pressure</b> <b>altitude</b> the calibration equation (see calibrated airspeed) correctly accounts for the compression {{so there is no}} compressibility error at sea level. At higher altitudes the compression is not correctly accounted for and will cause the instrument to read greater than equivalent airspeed. A correction may be obtained from a chart. Compressibility error becomes significant at altitudes above [...] and at airspeeds greater than [...] Hysteresis is an error that is caused by mechanical properties of the aneroid capsules located within the instruments. [...] These capsules, used to determine pressure differences, have physical properties that resist change by retaining a given shape, even though the external forces may have changed. Reversal errors are caused by a false static pressure reading. [...] This false reading may be caused by abnormally large changes in an aircraft's pitch. [...] A large change in pitch will cause a momentary showing of movement in the opposite direction. [...] Reversal errors primarily affect altimeters and vertical speed indicators.|$|E
2500|$|The plane {{suddenly}} encountered another downdraft. This one {{was more}} severe than before and gradually increased for 15 seconds, causing the plane to descend rapidly. Even though the crew had encountered the same problem before, surprisingly, they did not take any recovery action again {{to get out from}} the unsafe condition, which confirmed their ignorance on recovery procedures. The TAWS warning, [...] "Whoop Whoop Pull up!" [...] was heard on the CVR. The Captain responded by making a nose up. However, <b>pressure</b> <b>altitude</b> remained decreasing as well as the thrust, as auto-throttle remained engaged.|$|E
2500|$|... 23 March 1961 was {{the tenth}} {{day of a}} 15-day {{endurance}} experiment in a low <b>pressure</b> <b>altitude</b> chamber at the Institute of Biomedical Problems in Moscow.

Bondarenko, having completed work for the day, removed some monitoring biosensors from his body and washed his skin with an alcohol-soaked cotton ball, which he then carelessly threw away. The cotton ball landed on an electric hot plate which he was using to brew a cup of tea.

2500|$|The {{aircraft}} {{was equipped with}} a flight data recorder and a cockpit voice recorder. [...] The flight data recorder functioned throughout the flight and continuously recorded the aircraft's <b>pressure</b> <b>altitude,</b> indicated airspeed, vertical acceleration and magnetic heading until the moment of impact with the ground. [...] The cockpit voice recorder was slightly damaged in the impact and subsequent fire {{but there was no}} damage to the record of radio transmissions from the aircraft during the final 30 minutes of the flight. The record of ambient noise in the cockpit was also preserved and revealed the precise moment at which the frequency and volume of noise increased suddenly.|$|E
2500|$|As the {{turbocharged}} aircraft climbs, {{however, the}} pilot (or automated system) can close the wastegate, forcing more exhaust gas through the turbocharger turbine, thereby maintaining manifold pressure during the climb, {{at least until}} the critical <b>pressure</b> <b>altitude</b> is reached (when the wastegate is fully closed), after which manifold pressure falls. With such systems, modern high-performance piston engine aircraft can cruise at altitudes up to 25,000 feet (above which, RVSM certification would be required), where low air density results in lower drag and higher true airspeeds. This allows flying [...] "above the weather". In manually controlled wastegate systems, the pilot must take care not to overboost the engine, which causes detonation, leading to engine damage.|$|E

Most pilots chose to not take with them the suicide pill offered before missions. If put in the mouth and bitten, the [...] "L-pill"—containing liquid potassium cyanide—would cause death in 10–15 seconds. After a pilot almost accidentally ingested an L-pill instead of candy during a December 1956 flight, the suicide pills were put into boxes to avoid confusion. When in 1960 the CIA realized that a pill breaking inside the cockpit would kill the pilot, it destroyed the L-pills, and as a replacement its Technical Services Division developed a needle poisoned with a powerful shellfish toxin and hidden in a silver dollar. Only one was made because, as the agency decided, if any pilot needed to use it the program would probably be canceled.
