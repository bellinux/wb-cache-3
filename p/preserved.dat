40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} present status of Utah {{shooting}} <b>preserves</b> with special reference to attitudes {{and characteristics of}} hunters using and not using the shooting <b>preserves</b> system. Data were gathered primarily by a mail questionnaire survey. Compared to non-users, shooting <b>preserve</b> users were more frequently raised in a suburban or city area, better educated, and had higher yearly incomes. Shooting <b>preserve</b> users were commonly employed as professionals or proprietors, while non-users were often employed as craftsmen, proprietors, or operators. Most shooting <b>preserve</b> hunters hunted after the state game bird season was closed, and were generally satisfied with Utah <b>preserves.</b> Most hunters not using shooting <b>preserves</b> were very critical of the system, and claimed they would never hunt on a <b>preserve.</b> However, most non-users knew little about shooting <b>preserves</b> and were interested in having information about <b>preserves</b> in Utah. It was concluded that Utah shooting <b>preserves</b> should advertise their service, supply desired facilities, avoid crowding, keep grounds neat and clean, and stock only strong, healthy pheasants...|$|R
