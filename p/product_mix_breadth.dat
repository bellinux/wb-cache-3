Especially in pull systems with varying <b>product</b> <b>mixes,</b> accurate cycle time is even more crucial. Accurate cycle time also reduces the need for buffers. When the <b>product</b> <b>mix</b> varies, especially in a pull production system with parallel flow, determination of accurate cycle time becomes problematic. Hence this paper studies the relations between cycle times and <b>product</b> <b>mixes</b> in a parallel pull production system using discrete event simulation.

40|$|Studies of the {{performance}} effects of <b>product</b> <b>mix</b> complexity typically treat plant capacity utilization and machine scheduling (for example, setup frequency) as exogenous factors associated with technology choices, economies of scale, {{and the level of}} market demand. However, capacity utilization and machine scheduling also reflect tactical operating decisions taken by local managers to maximize short-run performance. If managers rationally anticipate a negative relation between performance and <b>product</b> <b>mix</b> complexity, we expect tactical operating decisions to be used to mitigate performance degradation. Previous empirical studies that ignore this simultaneity provide an incomplete assessment of {{the performance}} effects of <b>product</b> <b>mix</b> complexity. This paper uses path analysis to examine the combined impact of <b>product</b> <b>mix</b> on capacity management decisions and operating performance in three textile manufacturing plants. The results support the hypothesis that <b>product</b> <b>mix</b> acts through capacity management decisions to reduce performance from the level implied by direct effects alone. The evidence also supports the behavioral proposition that managers use capacity management decisions strategically—creating production slack when <b>product</b> <b>mix</b> is anticipated to most affect performance.

Inherent in such planning is the monitoring of the mix {{to determine whether or}} not it strikes a good balance in terms of factors such as sales growth, sales stability and profitability. The <b>product</b> <b>mix</b> must be optimal vis-a-vis the opportunities and threats present in the external environment at any point in time.

Assigning tight but attainable due dates is a great challenge under the circumstances that the <b>product</b> <b>mix</b> changes periodically.

40|$|Technology-driven {{change is}} {{everywhere}} and value-capture from {{new technology is}} challenging for business managers. Also rival firms may use technology as part of major success strategies. This situation leads managers to be keenly interested in evaluation of alternative technologies prior to making a sunk investment in physical facilities. In contemplating new or added-capacity processing facilities, managers and investors must evaluate return on investment (ROI). Evaluation of ROI is complex because it varies by alternative technology and the resultant potential <b>product</b> <b>mix</b> alternatives associated with that technology {{at the time the}} investment capital is committed to build the processing plant. This research examines optimal alternative <b>product</b> <b>mix</b> from a processing plant technology that is fixed at the time of commitment to building or adding capacity. Evaluating the optimal <b>product</b> <b>mix</b> is of vital concern in any start-up processing environment. In this research the optimal <b>product</b> <b>mix</b> is evaluated by using a sophisticated evaluative tool known as PowerSim. This economic simulation software is used to model a start-up tomato processing plant in Ohio. The model evaluates the effects of various output, or tomato <b>product</b> <b>mix,</b> on plant profitability measured by ROI. Results indicate that an increase in plant profitability is expected when the tomato <b>product</b> <b>mix</b> consists of <b>products</b> that have a lower soluble solids concentration. The lower the soluble solids concentration of a tomato product, the less the processor will benefit from tomato varieties with high soluble solids. The processing operation achieves a RIO of 26. 5 percent when the plant'Â’s <b>product</b> <b>mix</b> is 50 percent tomato paste (31 degrees brix) and 50 percent diced tomatoes.

40|$|Abstract Today’s {{business}} environment involves a globalised market, greater than before competition and more challenging customers, all factors which contribute to higher uncertainty and variability. Manufacturing flexibility {{is becoming more}} important in order {{to cope with the}} complexity of products through frequency volume changes and evaluations of the technological requirements of products. The research for this thesis was performed within a subcontractor company, Laserkraft AB, who focus on laser cutting, turning and welding processes in their production. The company utilises a variety of volume and <b>product</b> <b>mixes,</b> which is in correlation with the objective of this study. The purpose of this research was to investigate the common source drivers in order to achieve volume and <b>product</b> <b>mix</b> flexibility on batch production systems. First, a literature review was conducted in order to build the framework of common source factors between volume and <b>product</b> <b>mix</b> flexibility. Then, a single case study was conducted to examine the outcomes of framework on batch production. In this case, qualitative techniques included interviews and an observation of the shop floor. The analysis of this study was conducted with empirical research on a case study and theoretical framework from literature. From the literature stand point; it was found that flexible manufacturing competencies (FMC) and strategic flexibility approaches are two main elements to determine internal source drivers between volume and <b>product</b> <b>mix</b> flexibility. The groups of common source factors were then analysed with respect to characteristics of batch production systems at the chosen company. A comparison between the framework and the empirical findings identified source drivers in order to achieve volume and <b>product</b> <b>mix</b> flexibility. Due to the limited nature of the study, all source factors that have an impact on achieving volume and <b>product</b> <b>mix</b> flexibility might not be presented in this thesis. Besides, it is difficult to generalise the result on a single case study. As a result, each organisation and industry refers to their product, process and type of layout, and requires a group of practices to achieve volume and <b>product</b> <b>mix</b> flexibility. This thesis concludes with the top three common source factors between volume and <b>product</b> <b>mix</b> flexibility such as: set-up time reduction, multi-trained employees and advanced manufacturing technology...|$|R
