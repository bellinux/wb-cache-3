Congenital heart defects pose a serious public health concern due to the high incidence and mortality among the population. By improving the understanding of causation of CHD, we may better understand the pathological basis of the disease and find disease risk for patients and their families. We conducted a forward genetic screen using ENU-induced mice in order to find the majority of disease-causing genes for congenital heart defects. We were able to recover a total of 88 mutations within 62 disease-causing genes that contribute to both cardiac and non-cardiac mutant phenotypes from 146 mouse lines. Of these variants, 59 were missense, 16 were splicing, and 13 were nonsense. There are 21 mutations from our screen that were found {{to be in the same}} domain as published human mutations. The mutations are similar in the sense that they occur in the same protein domain, but not necessarily the same exon. These mutations also present similar phenotypes in both mice and humans. Three of these mutations are incredibly similar to published human mutations due to the fact that they are within one or two amino acids or nucleotides from each other.

40|$|Background: Fetal {{death is}} a tragedy that causes severe {{distress}} to parents and caregivers. Most babies are born healthy, but sometimes, something goes wrong and a baby dies in utero. Present {{study was conducted to}} understand the incidence, epidemiological and etiological factors of intrauterine fetal death. Also to study the efficacy of misoprostol and dinoprostone as inducing agents in these cases. Methods: Present study was conducted in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, M. G. M. Medical College and Associated M. Y. Group of Hospitals, Indore (MP). Pregnancies diagnosed with IUFD were studied from March 2014 to February 2015. A total of 200 cases were studied. Ante partum events leading to fetal demise were recorded, socio-demographic and clinical characters were noted. Induction delivery interval of inducing agents was compared. Results: Incidence of IUFD at our centre was found to be 50 per 1000 deliveries. There was a high incidence in low socioeconomic strata, unbooked cases, primigravidas, preterm with abruption were the leading causes. Misoprostol was found to be more effective in termination of pregnancy in these cases. The induction delivery interval with Misoprostol was 9. 64 hrs and that of dinoprostone was 12. 63 hrs. Conclusions: Socio- demographic factors like poor socioeconomic class, teenage pregnancy, poor nutrition, lack of health education need to be considered as predisposing factor for <b>prenatal</b> <b>deaths,</b> many of the causes of intrauterine deaths are preventable like abruption hypertensive disorders which can be avoided by proper antenatal care.

Using a pooled time-series analysis from 1982 to 1988 with the 50 states as units of analysis, this study assessed the impact of family planning expenditures and abortion funding on several public health outcomes while controlling for other important variables and statistical problems inherent in pooled time-series studies.

Fetal echocardiography revealed numerous trabeculations and deep intertrabecular recesses within the cardiac ventricular myocardium. Diagnosis of ventricular noncompaction was made.
