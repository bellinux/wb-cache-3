25|$|The {{location}} {{chosen for}} building the fortification {{was in the}} Delhi plains (with an elevation range of , hemmed by the Yamuna River {{on one side and}} the northern spur of the Aravalli range of hills on the other side. This topography of the land area with the rock exposures at the Fort’s location, with a favourable link with the northeast trending ridge and the main mosque (Jama Masjid), was visualised as an ideal setting that provided the needed <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> <b>erosion</b> by the Yamuna River. It was also obvious that a stream on one side and a mountain ridge on the other side of any fortification would be a formidable barrier for invaders to penetrate into Delhi, as such a setting would only force the invaders to follow the river course. Keeping these advantages in view the Salimgarh Fort was built in 1546.|$|E
50|$|Mattress gabions are broad shallow baskets, useful on smooth riverbanks for {{the growth}} of vegetation. Tied side by side and layered next to each other on shallow surfaces, they create a blanket of <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> <b>erosion.</b>|$|E
50|$|Polylepis forests exist {{primarily}} as small, widely isolated fragments, {{which are being}} rapidly depleted by rural communities. Remaining Polylepis forests are used for firewood and building material and provide <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> <b>erosion</b> and habitats for endangered animals. In some countries, conservation and reforestation measures are underway.|$|E

50|$|The {{mangrove}} {{forest at}} Can Gio performs many valuable ecological functions, including coastal stabilisation, and <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> coastal <b>erosion,</b> oil spills and storm surges. The mangrove forest {{is a source}} of fuel wood and construction materials.|$|R
50|$|The main {{industry}} here {{is based}} on the products from the humble coconut tree. The coconut oil is used for cooking, as hair oil and in manufacture of soap. The coir extracted from the husk of the coconut tree is used for making rope, door mats, carpets and as <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> soil <b>erosion.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{arboretum}} {{was established}} in 1994 on four locations across hilly terrain {{at an altitude of}} 510 to 670 meters, with stated aims including conservation of endangered species, scientific study and experimentation, education, environmental <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> <b>erosion,</b> and aesthetics. It is technically a pinetum because mainly dedicated to conifers.|$|E
50|$|Dryland {{farming is}} {{dependent}} on natural rainfall, which can leave the ground vulnerable to dust storms, particularly if poor farming techniques are used or if the storms strike at a particularly vulnerable time. The fact that a fallow period must {{be included in the}} crop rotation means that fields cannot always be protected by a cover crop, which might otherwise offer <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> <b>erosion.</b>|$|E
50|$|Erosion {{should be}} {{carefully}} considered. To determine {{the level of}} <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> <b>erosion</b> {{it is important to}} look at “the potential severity of the environmental impacts associated with cap erosion and potential dispersion of the sediment contaminants in an extreme event” (such as a 100-year event). An under-designed in-situ cap could be compromised by erosion resulting in the release of contaminants. An over-designed cap would result in extremely high costs.|$|E
50|$|The {{resulting}} deforestation is {{also not}} easily compensated for by reforestation or afforestation. This is because plantations of other trees {{as a means for}} water conservation and <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> wind <b>erosion</b> (shelterbelts), as a rule, lack the biodiversity of the lost forest, especially when realized as monocultures. Also, soil stabilization and erosion control measures may not be as effective in preserving topsoil as the previous intact vegetation.|$|R
50|$|During {{the first}} half of 1961, all the tracks were lifted - locally it was rumoured for {{shipment}} to Nigeria This, however, was not the case; similar rumours attended many railway closures at the time, but it was scrapped by a Dublin scrap firm. The sleepers were sold for <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> coastal <b>erosion.</b> One of the few remaining traces of the railway is the Station house, which currently serves as the offices of Tramore Failte.|$|R
50|$|Seagrasses are {{ecosystem}} {{engineers in}} the sense that they partly create their own habitat. The leaves slow down water-currents increasing sedimentation, and the seagrass roots and rhizomes stabilize the seabed. Their importance to associated species is mainly due to provision of shelter (through their three-dimensional structure in the water column), and due to their extraordinarily high rate of primary production. As a result, seagrasses provide coastal zones with ecosystem services, such as fishing grounds, wave protection, oxygen production and <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> coastal <b>erosion.</b> Seagrass meadows account for 15% of the ocean’s total carbon storage.|$|R
50|$|Such {{development}} {{has led to}} the loss of 95% of Singapore’s mangroves. When Stamford Raffles arrived in Singapore in 1819, the land was largely mangrove swamp; today, mangrove cover accounts for less than 0.5% of Singapore’s total land area., This loss has greatly diminished the beneficial effects of mangroves, which include <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> <b>erosion</b> and reduction in organic pollution. Both of these attributes serve to ameliorate coastal water quality.|$|E
50|$|Macedonian pine {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{valuable}} conifer species in the Balkan Peninsula. Its durable wood is highly valued in construction, furniture production, wood-carving and cooperage. The tree is also exceptionally good at adapting to severe mountain climate conditions, which makes it a valuable species for afforestation on high terrain for <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> <b>erosion.</b> The local population use P. peuce resin to cure wounds, pectoral, skin and stomach diseases, varicose veins and other illnesses.|$|E

40|$|Winter wheat- summer fallow (WW-SF) is the {{predominant}} cropping {{system in the}} 300, 000 -acre Horse Heaven Hills (HHH) region in south-central Washington, USA. Blowing dust from residue- and roughness-deficient summer fallow results in soil loss and causes health problems. Annual no-till cropping to replace summer fallow would provide year-round <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> wind <b>erosion.</b> A 6 -year field study conducted from 1996 to 2002 evaluated the agronomic and economic feasibility of continuous annual no-till hard red spring wheat (HRSW) {{as an alternative to}} traditional WW-SF.

25|$|A {{buffer strip}} {{is an area}} of land {{maintained}} in permanent vegetation that helps to control air, soil, and water quality, along with other environmental problems, dealing primarily on land that is used in agriculture. Buffer strips trap sediment, and enhance filtration of nutrients and pesticides by slowing down runoff that could enter the local surface waters. The root systems of the planted vegetation in these buffers hold soil particles together which alleviate the soil of wind erosion and stabilize stream banks providing <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> substantial <b>erosion</b> and landslides. Farmers can also use buffer strips to square up existing crop fields to provide safety for equipment while also farming more efficiently.|$|R
50|$|Mangrove swamps protect {{coastal areas}} from erosion, storm surge (especially during hurricanes), and tsunamis. The mangroves' massive root systems are {{efficient}} at dissipating wave energy. Likewise, they slow down tidal water enough so its sediment is deposited as the tide comes in, leaving all except fine particles when the tide ebbs. In this way, mangroves {{build their own}} environments. Because of the uniqueness of mangrove ecosystems and the <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> <b>erosion</b> they provide, they are often the object of conservation programs, including national biodiversity action plans.|$|E
50|$|Khasan is {{the only}} Russian-inhabited {{locality}} {{on the border with}} North Korea. It lies near Lake Khasan and the Tumen River. The border between Russia and North Korea is formed by the river, but the Tumen's course sometimes changes during floods, effectively diminishing the territory of Russia and threatening to flood the settlement of Khasan and the Peschanaya border station. Since 2003, work has been progressing to reinforce the area with rocky soil for <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> <b>erosion</b> by the river. There is an unobtrusive Russian outpost near the border with a large radar array. On the North Korean side of the border lies Tumangang. The closest Chinese town is Fangchuancun.|$|E
50|$|Hedgerows:A hedgerow {{is defined}} as a fence or barrier formed by a dense row of shrubsor low trees, which {{provides}} <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> <b>erosion,</b> and acts as a barricade confining livestock. Using hedgerows to outline agricultural fields, farmers can benefit from the shrubs promotion of native pollinators and predatory insects which reduce pest outbreaks, thus reducing the financial burden of purchasing expensive pesticides. Attracting native pollinators like sweat bees also aid the farmer financially because bees contribute to an estimated $40 billion in orchard, row, and pasture business (Shepherd et al.-2003.) Hedgerows are also valuable as wildlife movement corridors, which allow insects and animals to move or migrate easier across farmlands. They do this by connecting wildernesses and farmlands together, thus expanding the wild landscape and habitat region of local native species.|$|E
40|$|Development of new {{classes of}} {{anti-inflammatory}} and analgesic drugs has been stimulated because aspirin and {{nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents}} (NSAIDs) are partially effective and produce significant gas-trointestinal toxicity. COX- 2 was described in the early 1990 s and was found to rapidly increase inflam-mation when activated. 1 The search for inhibitors of this enzyme became a source of intense pharmaceuti-cal research. It was believed that COX- 2 was not pro-duced by the gastric mucosa as was cycloxygenase- 1 (COX- 1, which inferred <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> gastric <b>erosion),</b> and as such inhibition of COX- 2 would be free of gastrointestinal adverse effects. 11 Physiology of Cycloxygenases Prostaglandins (PGs) are lipid-derived autacoids gener...|$|R

5000|$|Slender wheatgrass (Elymus trachycaulus) ideally {{grows in}} {{habitats}} that contain a balanced supply of moisture. The species can also tolerate higher salinity in the soil, {{making it easier}} to grow in more diverse habitats. [...] Studies in soil salinity tolerance have grown in interest due to changing environments and agricultural maintenance. In an experiment performed to assess the growth of slender wheatgrass and stressful salt levels, the results were “superior”. This cultivar can be established in a high-saline habitat over other grass cultivars. “Salt-tolerant, perennial forage crops capable of establishing on saline soils will provide <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> <b>erosion,</b> compete with weeds, utilize excess soil moisture, and in some situations provide forage for animals.” Along with saline-stress tolerance, slender wheatgrass can also successfully grow in shallow or deep soils and in areas that aren’t limited by drift. They can inhabit an area and produce a stable living situation quickly. Generally this cultivar will persist between 5 and 10 years and produce a substantial seed count.|$|E

5000|$|Measures of <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> the {{continuous}} <b>erosion</b> {{date back to}} the early 19th century when groynes of wooden poles were constructed. Those were built at right angles into the sea from the coast line. Later they were replaced by metal and eventually by armoured concrete groynes. The constructions did not have the desired effect of stopping the erosion caused by crossways currents. [...] "Leeward erosion", i.e. erosion on the downwind side of the groynes prevented sustainable accumulation of sand.|$|R
