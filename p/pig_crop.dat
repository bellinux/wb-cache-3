40|$|Statistics {{published}} by the Dominion Department of Agriculture of Canada show that about 20 % of the Canadian <b>pig</b> <b>crop</b> dies every year. This mortality is due to several causes [...] bacterial, virus, parasitic, nutritional diseases and bad management. Diseases due to virus and bacterial infections are comparatively few and the means for their control are not lacking. However, there are disease problems of a more complex nature; these include parasitic as well as nutritional diseases. This has been previously pointed out by Watson. It is widely believed that intestinal parasites {{play an important role}} in diseases of swine. The intestinal parasite most commonly found in pigs in Canada is Ascaris lumbricoides Linn. 1758. This nematode is readily recognized by breeders and is generally believed to be an important factor in swine losses. It is this nematode that has claimed the attention of most investigators interested in the problem of swine diseases and losses. However, while a large amount of work has been carried out with regard to the exact relationship between Ascaris infection and its clinical and pathological manifestations in the host animal, this relationship is still very poorly understood...|$|E

40|$|An {{economic}} model of pork, swine, and related markets examines effects of hypothetical {{classical swine fever}} (CSF) outbreaks in the United States. Equations determine deviations in endogenous variables from observed supply and demand values. The analysis assumes 11 million US hogs are destroyed. Live swine and pork exports are stopped during the outbreak, with full recovery. Pork demand by US consumers is assumed to fall by 1 % during the outbreaks, with a gradual recovery. Hog growers adjust expectations of future prices {{on the basis of}} current market conditions. One potential CSF outbreak reflects losses in the hog population skewed towards grower and finisher swine, while another outbreak has stronger effects on breeding inventory and the <b>pig</b> <b>crop.</b> The largest effects occur in pork and swine. Effects on other sectors are small. Over 20 quarters, the pork industry returns lose $ 4 billion. Losses for hogs, including the value of animals destroyed, range from $ 2. 6 billion to $ 4. 1 billion. An assumption of unchanged hog-grower expectations for returns is compared to that when expectations adjust. Unchanged expectations alter the pattern of slaughter and prices because breeding inventory falls less, thus more hogs are available for sale after Quarter 7...|$|E

In 1867 70% of the land was grassland and this rose to 92% in 1938. It did fall in 1965 to 79%. It was mainly grassland because they mainly farmed sheep.

40|$|Within an {{interdisciplinary}} approach 24 groups of 20 pigs each were fattened outdoors {{to examine and}} calculate the nutrient inputs and their distribution in soils in relation to several management strategies. Management strategies varied in diets, field <b>crops</b> to <b>pigs,</b> static or mobile installation units like huts, troughs, and sun shelters. Stocking rates were adapted to the regulations of the Bioland organic farming associations, which limit the nutrient input to a maximum nitrogen load of 112 kg ha - 1 a- 1 or 10 fattening pigs ha- 1 a- 1, respectively. The results were discussed {{with regard to the}} nutrient accumulation in soils and leaching of nitrate into groundwater. Recommendations in relation to management strategies and integration of outdoor <b>pig</b> fattening within <b>crop</b> rotation of an organic farming system were formulated. Nutrient accumulation and leaching can be kept to a well tolerated level by adapting nutrient inputs and optimising their distribution. Therefore, the amount of concentrate has to be limited. Fodder loss should be avoided and available field fodder has to be considered as a ratio of concentrate. The main conclusion of this approach: The results indicate {{that it is possible to}} integrate <b>pig</b> production within <b>crop</b> rotation without the risk of high nutrient losses by moving huts and troughs at short intervals and rationed paddocks at weekly intervals, which markedly homogenised the distribution of nutrients...|$|R

Differences in the relative efficiency of farms are explored by the simultaneous estimation of a model of technical inefficiency effects. The analysis shows that, generally, farms of all types are relatively efficient with {{a large proportion of}} farms operating close to the production frontier. However, whilst the frontier farms of all types are becoming more efficient through time because of technical change, it is also the case that the efficiency of the average farm for most farm types is increasing at a slower rate. In addition, annual mean levels of efficiency for most farm types have declined between 1982 and 2002. The factors that consistently appear to have a statistically significant effect on differences in efficiency between farms are: farm or herd size, farm debt ratios, farmer age, levels of specialisation and ownership status.
