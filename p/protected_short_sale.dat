40|$|This study {{explores the}} role of <b>short</b> <b>sale</b> {{constraints}} in explaining the variation in premiums to Net Asset Value (NAV) in REIT pricing. We use proprietary information on <b>short</b> <b>sales</b> between June 2006 and September 2008 to examine how <b>short</b> <b>sales</b> and <b>short</b> <b>sale</b> constraints affect the variation in monthly REIT NAV premiums using panel vector autoregression models.

40|$|The use of <b>short</b> <b>sales</b> {{by mutual}} funds has {{increased}} significantly {{over the last}} decade. In this paper, we provide a first look at short selling by mutual funds, a phenomenon not examined by prior research. The mutual funds that use <b>short</b> <b>sales</b> do so frequently and in significant amounts, averaging about 16 % of fund assets. We find that mutual funds that use <b>short</b> <b>sales</b> outperform size-matched control funds by a risk-adjusted 1. 5 % per year, suggesting that managers using <b>short</b> <b>sales</b> are skilled. The results are similar when we use style and size-matched funds. Using detailed portfolio holdings data, we show that mutual funds that use <b>short</b> <b>sales</b> generate abnormal performance from both their short (4. 1 % per year) and long (1. 5 % per year) positions. Furthermore, fund managers who use <b>short</b> <b>sales</b> exhibit superior performance in other funds they manage that do not use <b>short</b> <b>sales.</b> Our findings thus suggest that managers of mutual funds that use <b>short</b> <b>sales</b> appear to possess skill...|$|R

In aggregate, our analysis provides evidence suggesting that informed trading, at least in <b>short</b> <b>sales,</b> occurs more readily in family controlled firms than in diffuse shareholder firms.

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the validity of <b>short</b> <b>sale</b> hypotheses in the NYSE in the period 1990 – 2015. The <b>short</b> <b>sale</b> has been regulated in the U. S. market from the 1930 s by so called up-tick rules and other legal acts. The aim of this regulation was to prevent short sellers from adding to the downward momentum when the price of an asset was already experiencing sharp declines. During 1990 s the <b>short</b> <b>sale</b> regulations changed for several times. In this paper the <b>short</b> <b>sale</b> determinants are investigated using variables that correspond with short selling hypotheses in the period from 1990 to 2015.

40|$|This study tests Miller's (1977) {{overpricing}} hypothesis {{from a new}} angle. Specifically, {{we investigate}} the effects of heterogeneous interpretations on price reactions to earnings announcements.

This pattern is more pronounced when <b>short</b> <b>sale</b> constraints are more binding. These findings support the notion that, under <b>short</b> <b>sale</b> constraints, stock prices selectively incorporate more optimistic opinions rather than the average opinion of all investors.

We classify <b>short</b> <b>sale</b> constraints into two types: short restrictions and proceeds restrictions. The first limits the amount that traders can short and the second restricts traders' access to the proceeds of their <b>short</b> <b>sales.</b> Both types of restrictions influence traders with favorable and unfavorable signals on the future payoff asymmetrically. While traders rationally adjust their expectations to accommodate the asymmetric impact of the restrictions, their adjustment, in general, can not prevent the decrease in informational efficiency of a financial market. Consequently, imposing <b>short</b> <b>sale</b> constraints can bias equilibrium asset prices and affect trading volume.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{new insight}} into how information is disseminated when markets are subject to <b>short</b> <b>sales</b> restrictions by examining the relationship between short interest and returns for Canadian stocks. Short interest is defined in relation to trading volume because volume reflects information in the market. The results strongly support the assertion that <b>short</b> <b>sales</b> reflect bad news in Canada. The paper further finds that <b>short</b> <b>sales</b> convey more negative information for small firms because the supply of shortable shares is more constrained for these firms. In addition, <b>short</b> <b>sales</b> are less informative for stocks with associated options because the option market enhances the informational efficiency of the stock market. Importantly, {{the evidence suggests that}} informed traders short sell interlisted stocks in Canada, rather than the U. S., to exploit lower execution costs.

40|$|Indirect {{real estate}} (IRE) returns are often shown to lead direct real estate (DRE) returns. Apart from {{differences}} in liquidity, transaction costs, and management skills, the DRE market is also less complete than the IRE market – when negative shocks arrive, {{one can only}} short IRE (e. g. real estate stocks or REITs), but not DRE. This study investigates if <b>short</b> <b>sales</b> in the IRE market convey any information to the DRE market. Based on high-frequency (weekly) property price data in Hong Kong from 1999 to 2011, we found that <b>short</b> <b>sales</b> in the IRE market led DRE returns, even after controlling for the lagged IRE returns in a VAR model. This suggests that <b>short</b> <b>sales</b> contain private information on {{the real estate market}} that is not fully reflected in IRE returns.

40|$|In this {{dissertation}} I aim {{at improving}} {{the understanding of}} the informativeness of short-selling {{in the context of the}} motivation, the impact on future stock returns, and the relation with market efficiencies. In Chapter 1, I study short sellers? reactions after quarterly earnings announcements as well as the associations between <b>short</b> <b>sales</b> and post announcement stock returns. <b>Short</b> <b>sales</b> increase immediately after both negative and positive earnings surprises. After positive earnings surprises, short sellers appear to act as contrarians, and trade against stock price overreaction, thereby inducing price reversal in the long run. After negative earnings surprises, short sellers act as momentum traders, and trade with post earnings announcement drift. However, they are not able to fully arbitrage away the downside post earnings announcement drift. The short sellers? different reactions at subsequent surprises in a series of same-sign earnings surprises implies that short sellers exploit the consequences of other investors? behavioral biases. The results highlight the motivations and impacts for <b>short</b> <b>sales</b> after earnings announcements. In Chapter 2, I investigate the informativeness of short-selling by combining Probability of Information-based Trading measure and <b>short</b> <b>sales</b> transaction data. <b>Short</b> <b>sales</b> depress stock returns in the short run, regardless of the information asymmetry level. However, <b>short</b> <b>sales</b> can not predict future stock return in the long run if information asymmetry levels are low. Large size <b>short</b> <b>sales</b> are the most informed. When <b>short</b> <b>sales</b> constraints are more binding, short-selling is more informed, especially for the stocks with high information asymmetry levels. In Chapter 3, I examine <b>short</b> <b>sales</b> prior to merger and acquisition announcements for acquiring firms. Short-selling increases prior to stock-financed not cash-financed mergers and acquisitions. Pre-announcement abnormal short-selling is negatively related to post-announcement stock returns. Short sellers are informed of the method of payment, but not the outcome. The results also indicate that short-sellers are more active in stocks with larger firm size, lower book-to-market ratio, and higher liquidity...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – In this paper, {{the authors}} aim {{to test the}} {{assertion}} that options act {{as a substitute for}} <b>short</b> <b>sales</b> by allowing investors an alternative way to act on bearish sentiment. An empirical test of this assertion requires a researcher to observe both types of firm – those that weren’t <b>short</b> <b>sale</b> constrained, as well as those that were. The authors examine the ability of options to alleviate the <b>short</b> <b>sales</b> constraint directly – in an environment where the constraint is likely to differ across firms in a systematic fashion, namely the market for American Depository Receipts (ADRs). Design/methodology/approach – The authors examine 190 option introductions on ADRs over the period of 1982 to 2006. The question of how ADRs are chosen for options listing, and whether those criteria differ from those found using purely domestic options, is addressed using logistic regressions. The authors use the event study methods of Brown and Warner to examine the price effect of the listing. They use OLS regression to identify determinants of the cumulative abnormal return upon option listing. Independent variables are those indicated by existing literature that examines option listing on domestic securities. Findings – In an environment where the effective <b>short</b> <b>sale</b> constraint varies across firms, the authors find support for the contention that US option listings reduce the effect of the <b>short</b> <b>sales</b> constraint, providing relief for investors who have negative sentiment about the stock and are subject to a <b>short</b> <b>sale</b> constraint. However, it does not appear that option listing entities seek out companies for which <b>short</b> <b>sale</b> constraints are stronger. Originality/value – The authors’ hypotheses {{are similar to those of}} Mayhew and Mihov and of Danielson and Sorescu, but the authors assert that the ADR market is a more robust environment in which to test the hypotheses. This is due to the potentially large variation in the effective <b>short</b> <b>sale</b> constraints that results from the differences in their underlying home market legal and regulatory environments. In addition to relative short interest and the change in relative short interest, this environment allows the authors to use indicator variables to directly test the ability of options to substitute for <b>short</b> <b>sales...</b>|$|R

40|$|This chapter {{provides}} {{insights into}} the regulatory framework that governs <b>short</b> <b>sales</b> and the taxation of <b>short</b> <b>sales</b> in Canada, and discusses recent trends in short selling activity in Canada. In Canada, the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (IIROC) governs most of the activity related to equity <b>short</b> <b>sales</b> through the Universal Market Integrity Rules (UMIR). A proposal was put forward in 2007 to repeal the uptick rule in Canada altogether, however, the market turbulence of 2008 led the IIROC to defer the proposed removal of the uptick rule. Although {{not part of the}} IIROC's UMIR, some short selling activity is also prohibited by certain insiders by the Canada Business Corporations Act (CBCA). There are, however, some exceptions to this prohibition that allow insiders to sell short under certain conditions if they own another security convertible into the security sold or an option or right to acquire the security sold. A <b>short</b> <b>sale</b> becomes taxable when the borrowed shares are repurchased and returned to the original owner. <b>Short</b> <b>sales</b> typically have volumes lower than that of the opposing long position in a given security. <b>Short</b> <b>sale</b> volume consisted of 78 % of the average trade volume for the TSX and 83 % for the TSXV. The lowest level of <b>short</b> <b>sale</b> volume relative to long positions was seen on the CNSX, with an average rate of 52 %. UMIR requirements make it necessary to periodically report the short position held in each security on an account-by-account basis.
