40|$|The blends of poly(N-methyldodecano- 12 -lactam) (MPA) with poly(styrene-co-acrylic acid) (PSAA) {{prepared}} from dioxane solutions {{were studied}} by {{differential scanning calorimetry}} (DSC) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The experimental DSC data of glass transition temperature T, {{as a function of}} composition of amorphous phase were fitted for the as-prepared and re-scanned samples using theoretical approaches. The as-prepared blends show monotonic single-T-g dependence. The values of the Gordon-Taylor coefficient not far from unity suggest miscibility of the blend system in amorphous phase in the whole concentration range. As documented by FTIR, this miscibility is associated with hydrogen bonds between COOH groups of the acrylic acid units in PSAA molecules acting as the H-bond donor and CO groups of MPA acting as the H-bond acceptor. The T-g-dependencies obtained form the second runs have a profound sigmoid character. The Schneider treatment induced an idea of <b>partial</b> limited <b>miscibility</b> in the MPA/PSAA blends caused by prevalence of homogeneous contacts. The difference in T-g {{between the first and second}} run can partly be attributed to higher crystallinities in the former. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|To {{establish}} the accuracy and applicability of analytical expressions for the steady state rate of binary nucleation, we numerically solved the birth-death equations for the vapor-to-liquid transition. These calculations were performed using rate coefficients {{that are consistent}} with the principle of detailed balance and a new self-consistent form of the equilibrium distribution function for binary cluster concentrations. We found that the customary saddle point and growth path approximations are almost always valid and can fail only if the nucleating solution phase is significantly nonideal. For example, problems can arise when the vapor composition puts the system on the verge of <b>partial</b> liquid phase <b>miscibility.</b> When this occurs for comparable monomer impingement rates, nucleation still occurs through the saddle point, but the usual quadratic expansion for the cluster free energy is inadequate. When the two impingement rates differ significantly, however, the major particle flux may bypass the saddle point and cross a low ridge on the free energy surface. The dependence of the saddle point location on the gas phase composition is also important in initiating or terminating ridge crossing nucleation...|$|R
40|$|The {{major theme}} of this {{dissertation}} {{is the study of}} blends of polyimides with a series of chemically similar polymers, namely poly(ether ether ketone) (PEEK) and three derivatives of PEEK. The synthesis of two new polymers is discussed, as well as the phase behavior of three new completely miscible blends and one partially miscible blend. ^ Sulfonated and sulfamidated PEEKs have been prepared, based on previously determined methods. The first controlled nitration of PEEK is reported. Spectroscopic characterization was performed to determine the substitution pattern. Thermal analysis was performed to determine the dependence of the glass transition temperature and the degradation behavior on the level of substitution. Room temperature solubility has been examined for the nitrated PEEKs in fourteen common solvents. ^ Three methods of reduction of the nitrated polymer to the corresponding aminated polymer have been attempted. Infrared spectroscopy was used to determine the effectiveness of these methods. Thermal properties and solubility of the reduced polymer are compared to those of the parent nitrated PEEK. ^ Six different binary blends and one ternary blend have been studied to determine miscibility, defined by the existence of a single glass transition temperature. The phase behavior of binary blends of a commercial poly(amide imide) with poly(ether ether ketone), sulfonated PEEK (three degrees of sulfonation), sulfamidated PEEK, nitrated PEEK (three degrees of nitration) and a commercially available poly(ether imide) have been determined, as well as the behavior of the binary poly(ether imide) -sulfonated PEEK blend (three degrees of sulfonation). Chemical modification of PEEK was found to have a critical effect on the miscibility of these blends: unmodified PEEK was found to be completely immiscible with the poly(amide imide), yet each PEEK derivative showed <b>partial</b> or complete <b>miscibility.</b> Spectroscopic investigation of the intermolecular interactions responsible for the phase behavior found strong deviations from Beer 2 ̆ 7 s law in the ultraviolet region; this was postulated to result from the formation of electron donor-acceptor complexes between the substituted phenylene rings of the PEEKs and the N-phenylene units of the polyimides. ^ The ternary poly(amide imide) [...] sulfonated PEEK [...] poly(ether imide) system has also been examined (two degrees of sulfonation).

40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} a diffuse interface model to simulate multi-component two-phase flow with <b>partial</b> <b>miscibility</b> {{based on a}} realistic equation of state (e. g. Peng-Robinson equation of state). Because of <b>partial</b> <b>miscibility,</b> thermodynamic relations are used to model not only interfacial properties but also bulk properties, including density, composition, pressure, and realistic viscosity. As far as we know, this effort {{is the first time}} to use diffuse interface modeling based on equation of state for modeling of multi-component two-phase flow with <b>partial</b> <b>miscibility.</b> In numerical simulation, the key issue is to resolve the high contrast of scales from the microscopic interface composition to macroscale bulk fluid motion since the interface has a nanoscale thickness only. To efficiently solve this challenging problem, we develop a multi-scale simulation method. At the microscopic scale, we deduce a reduced interfacial equation under reasonable assumptions, and then we propose a formulation of capillary pressure, which is consistent with macroscale flow equations. Moreover, we show that Young-Laplace equation is an approximation of this capillarity formulation, and this formulation is also consistent with the concept of Tolman length, which is a correction of Young-Laplace equation. At the macroscopical scale, the interfaces are treated as discontinuous surfaces separating two phases of fluids. Our approach differs from conventional sharp-interface two-phase flow model in that we use the capillary pressure directly instead of a combination of surface tension and Young-Laplace equation because capillarity can be calculated from our proposed capillarity formulation. A compatible condition is also derived for the pressure in flow equations. Furthermore, based on the proposed capillarity formulation, we design an efficient numerical method for directly computing the capillary pressure between two fluids composed of multiple components. Finally, numerical tests are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed multi-scale method...|$|E
40|$|Very-low-density polyethylenes (VLDPEs) {{with short}} branches, formed by {{metallocene}} or Ziegler-Natta catalysts, were blended with low-density polyethylenes (LDPEs) or VLDPEs with long branches. The crystallization and melting behavior of these blends were examined by {{differential scanning calorimetry}} (DSC). The blends of metallocene-catalyzed VLDPE 1 and LDPEs showed a smooth change in both crystallization and melting peak temperatures, indicating that there was co-crystallization and, hence, <b>partial</b> <b>miscibility</b> at all compositions.

The storage modulus of the PLA/PHBV blends was higher than those of both PLA and PHBV in the temperature region below the glass transition of PHBV, but the PLA/PCL and PHBV/PCL bends did not show a similar feature. The E′ values between the glass transitions of PLA and PHBV depended on the blend compositions and morphologies.

Poly (lactic acid) (PLA) and poly (butylene succinate) (PBS) are such biodegradable polymers which aim to replace commodity polymers in future applications. Since cost and brittleness of PLA is quite high, it is not economically feasible to use it alone for day to day use as a packaging material without blending. In this study, blends of PLA and PBS with various compositions were prepared by using a laboratory-scale twin-screw extruder at 180 ºC. Morphological, thermal, rheological and mechanical properties were investigated on the samples obtained by compression molding to explore suitability of these compositions for packaging applications. Morphology of the blends was investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Morphology showed a clear phase difference trend depending on blend composition. Modulated differential scanning calorimetry (MDSC) thermograms of the blends indicated that the glass transition temperature () of PLA did not change much with the addition of PBS, but analysis showed that for PLA/PBS blend of up to 80 / 20 composition there is <b>partial</b> <b>miscibility</b> between the two polymers.
