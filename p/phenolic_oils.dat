Discharges from them significantly increased the ammonia {{content and the}} biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) of the river. Orgreave was discharging effluent with 146mg/l of ammonia in 1985, which needed to be around 70 per cent lower to improve the river quality to Grade D, but the plant closed in 1991, and water quality has improved dramatically since. Discharges from Avenue coking plant were diverted into a foul sewer in 1986, {{to enable them to}} be treated at Old Whittington treatment works. The plant closed in 1992, but there were problems with <b>phenolic</b> <b>oils</b> leaching from the original storage lagoons into the river for some years after closure. Discharges from the Coalite plant reached the river through its tributary, the River Doe Lea. Again, there were significant improvements to the treatment of effluent in 1984, 1989 and 1996. Brookhouse was the smallest of the four works, but closed in the early 1980s before remedial works were implemented. The coking plants were the worst polluters of the river, and their closure resulted in water quality being significantly improved.|$|E

Both precious metal catalysts and sulfided base metal catalyst were evaluated for hydrotreating the <b>phenolic</b> <b>oils,</b> as an extrapolation from whole bio-oil hydrotreatment. They were effective in removing heteroatoms with carbon yields as high as 81 % (unadjusted for the 90 % carbon balance). There was substantial heteroatom removal with residual O of only 0. 4 % to 5 %, while N and S were reduced to less than 0. 05 %. Use of the precious metal catalysts resulted in more saturated products less completely hydrotreated compared to the sulfided base metal catalyst, which was operated at higher temperature. The liquid product was 42 – 52 % gasoline range molecules and about 43 % diesel range molecules. Particulate matter in the <b>phenolic</b> <b>oils</b> complicated operation of the reactors, causing plugging in the fixed-beds especially for the corn stover phenolic oil. This difficulty contrasts with the catalyst bed fouling and plugging, which is typically seen with hydrotreatment of whole bio-oil. This problem was substantially alleviated by filtering the <b>phenolic</b> <b>oils</b> before hydrotreating. More thorough washing of the <b>phenolic</b> <b>oils</b> during their preparation from the heavy ends of bio-oil or online filtration of pyrolysis vapors to remove particulate matter before condensation of the bio-oil fractions is recommended...|$|E
40|$|Lignocellulosic {{biorefinery}} {{for production}} of biofuels, materials and chemicals requires valorization of all fractions including lignin. As {{a consequence of}} its poly-aromatic structure, lignin potentially serves {{as a source for}} aromatic chemicals. The developed biorefinery concept of the LignoValue project comprises two major steps: (1) Organosolv fractionation of wheat straw and willow into (hemi) cellulose and high purity lignin. (2) Further conversion of the isolated lignin via catalytic pyrolysis, supercritical depolymerization and partial hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) into different components like low molecular phenolic compounds, wood adhesives and fuel additives. The cellulose fraction resulting after organosolv fractionation is effectively hydrolysed by enzymes for biofuel production. Quality assessment of the liberated lignins shows interesting characteristics for follow-up chemistry such as high purity, relatively low molar mass and polydispersity. Catalytic pyrolysis in a fluidised bed at 400 - 500 °C was found to convert organosolv lignin in 35 - 55 % phenolic oil, 10 % identified monomeric phenolic compounds, 10 - 20 % water, 5 - 20 % gas and 35 - 55 % char. Supercritical depolymerisation of lignin in carbon dioxide based solvents resulted in a similar spectrum of products, however, at a lower temperature (ca 300 °C) but at higher pressures. In both thermochemical processes the use of promotors or catalysts lead to an improved yield of the target monomeric aromatic products. Also the residual char fraction shows interesting properties for use in bio-char applications. Catalytic semi-continuous HDO of lignin in hydrogen atmosphere can be manipulated to yield both light oils or heavy oils as potential additives to fuels. Suitable catalysts were found to convert depolymerised lignin to <b>phenolic</b> <b>oils</b> in high yields. In this process no char formation is observed. The lignin oils were successfully tested on lab scale as partial substitution of phenol in resins for gluing wood panels.

When catalyzed by KH 2 PO 4 -AA, the content of aryl ethers increased with rising temperature during the early stage but decreased at 500 degrees C. Alkoxy phenols had an inhibiting effect on etherification of alkyl phenols due to adsorption competition. Aryl ethers were mostly generated from alkyl phenols, while alkoxy phenols also contributed by simultaneous conversion to dialkoxybenzenes and diphenols, with a higher selectivity to diphenols.

Virgin olive oil containing oleocanthal is often added as an ingredient {{in a number of}} cooked dishes and therefore it is of great importance to understand how best to preserve the putative health promoting benefits of this compound, as olive <b>oil</b> <b>phenolics</b> are subject to heat degradation. Objective – To investigate if oleocanthal is thermally degraded or its biological activity reduced during cooking. Design – One extra virgin olive oil containing 54 mg/kg oleocanthal was heated at varying temperatures (100 °C, 170 °C and 240 °C) for set time periods (0, 1, 5, 20, 60, 90 min).

For determination of antioxidant properties scavenging capacity on DPPH ֹ radicals has been applied. The total <b>phenolic</b> content, <b>oil</b> and protein content in soybean cultivars were also determined. Significant differences {{in the content of}} individual isoflavones were observed within the soybean cultivars. The total phenol content in soybean cultivars ranged from 87. 2 to 216. 3 mg GAE/ 100 g of soybean. The total isoflavone content in soybean seeds ranged from 80. 7 to 213. 6 mg/ 100 g of soybean. The most abundant isoflavone in soybean seeds was genistein. There was statistically significant difference (p < 0. 05) among two locations in total and individual isoflavone contents. The highest contents of total isoflavones were found in cultivar “os 55 - 95 ”. Conversely, cultivars poor in isoflavones also showed low levels of DPPH-radical scavenging activity...|$|R
40|$|Virgin olive <b>oil</b> <b>phenolic</b> {{compounds}} {{are responsible}} for its nutritional and sensory quality. The synthesis of phenolic compounds occurs when enzymes and substrates meet as olive fruit is crushed during the industrial process to obtain the oil. The genetic variability of the major phenolic compounds of virgin olive oil was studied in a progeny of the cross of Picual x Arbequina olive cultivars (Olea europaea L.). They belong to four different groups: compounds that included tyrosol or hydroxytyrosol in their molecules, lignans, flavonoids, and phenolic acids. Data of <b>phenolics</b> in the <b>oils</b> showed that the progeny displayed a large degree of variability, widely transgressing the genitor levels. This high variability can be of interest on breeding programs. Thus, multivariate analysis allowed to identify genotypes within the progeny particularly interesting in terms of phenolic composition and deduced organoleptic and nutritional quality. The present study has demonstrated {{that it is possible}} to obtain enough degree of variability with a single cross of olive cultivars for compounds related to the nutritional and organoleptic properties of virgin olive oil. © 2014 Pérez et al.
