40|$|A cultura do cafeeiro no Estado de São Paulo é feita plantando-se diversas mudas em uma mesma cova. Porisso, não se pode adotar nenhum tipo regular de poda, como se faz nos outros paises cafeicultores. Há algumas práticas que se executam com a finalidade de se manter o que se convencionou chamar de pé de café em condições de produzir satisfatòriamente. Um dêsses usos, aceito por uns e combatido por outros, é o que {{consiste}} na retirada dos ramos primários inferiores e sua ramificação, diminuindo-se assim a "saia" dos cafeeiros. O ensaio em exame teve por fim determinar se há ou não vantagem em se fazer a eliminação dêsses ramos. Foi plantado em 1932, na Estação Experimental Central de Campinas. A variedade empregada foi o Café Nacional, isto é, C. arabica L var. typica Cramer. Duas foram as séries examinadas : a) desbastada; b) não desbastada. Cada série se compunha de 5 repetições de 25 cafeeiros cada uma. A série desbastada foi regular e anualmente limpa de ramos primários, desde o ano seguinte ao da plantação (1933), mantendo-se os cafeeiros livres de ramos até a uma altura de mais ou menos 50 cm do solo. Os ramos ladrões, quando deixados, também eram submetidos a poda idêntica. As adubações e tratos culturais foram idênticos para ambas as séries. As colheitas foram iniciadas em 1935. Neste trabalho são examinadas as produções de 10 anos, relativos ao período 1935 - 1944. A produção foi quase que em todos os anos maior na série não desbastada. Apenas no ano de 1944 a colheita da série desbastada foi superior à da não desbastada. Houve diferença significativa (P = 1 %) para a produção das parcelas não desbastadas, no total dos dez anos. A maturação foi um pouco apressada nas séries desbastadas. Não houve, até ao presente, efeito do desbaste sobre o tamanho das sementes produzidas. Podemos, portanto, considerar como de efeito contraproducente a prática do desbaste dos ramos inferiores do-cafeeiro. The {{coffee plantation}} in the State of S. Paulo is usually started by putting together four, six, eight {{or even more}} plants in each pit (cova). This practice makes difficult any regular system of <b>prunning.</b> The elimination of some lower primary branches to promote better development of the main stem and upper primary branches to increase the yield is customary among some of our farmers. In 1932 the Coffee Department of the Instituto Agronômico (Campinas) decided to start an experiment {{to determine the effects}} of such kind of <b>prunning</b> on the production of coffee trees. Coffea arabica L. var. typica Cramer was- the variety choosed for the test. Five series of plants two years old (one year after transplanting to the definite place) had their lower branches suppressed for the first time and five other series were left as control, i. e,. without <b>prunning.</b> Both series were planted in the open at the Central Experiment Station at Campinas. The <b>prunning</b> was repeated every year in order to maintain the main stem of the developed tree up to the height of 40 - 50 cm from the ground free of primary branches. The same procedure was used for suckers in cases when they were left in order to maintain the shape of the coffee tree. The results of the first ten years (1935 - 1944) of experimentation show that a difference was noticed in the yield capacity of both series. Just in a single year (1944) the production of the prunned series was higher than the control. It remained lower in all the other years. The differences in the total production between both series was statistically significant (P = 1. %). The fruits in the prunned series seemed to ripe earlier than the unprunned, the size of the beans remaining constant in both treatments. In the light of the above mentioned results we infer that the practice so long used by some of our farmers is not advisable since it leads to a decrease in yield...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—We {{propose a}} sender-driven system for {{adaptive}} streaming from multiple servers {{to a single}} receiver over separate network paths. The servers employ information in receiver feedbacks to estimate the available bandwidth on the paths and then compute appropriate transmission schedules for streaming media packets to the receiver based on the bandwidth estimates. An optimization framework is proposed that enables the senders to compute their transmission schedules in a distributed way, and yet to dynamically coordinate them over time such that the resulting video quality at the receiver is maximized. To reduce the computational complexity of the optimization framework an alternative technique based on packet classification is proposed. The substantial reduction in online complexity due to the resulting packet partitioning makes the technique suitable for practical implementations of adaptive and efficient distributed streaming systems. Simulations with internet network traces demonstrate that the proposed solution adapts effectively to bandwidth variations and packet loss. They show that the proposed streaming framework provides superior performance over a conventional distortion-agnostic scheme that performs proportional packet scheduling on the network paths according to their respective bandwidth values.

Finally, we prove the non existence of mixed almost Moore graphs of order 18, 26, 28 and 50. We have also reviewed the lexicographic symmetry breaking constraints introduced by Codish et al. in [CMPS 13], and adapted to mixed graph search. In this way we prune the large number of isomorphic representations of a possible solution. We also compare the execution times of the original models with the models with symmetry breaking constraints. We see that this symmetry break is benefical in <b>prunning</b> the search, and in some cases is faster...|$|E

The research used Complete Randomized Design with One Way Analysis of Variance,Regression, and Correlation in order to know the effect of treatment to the land fertility. The research {{was carried out in}} Wonoharjo Village, Unit VIII Kuro Tidur Transmigration area, Bengkulu, during three planting seasons from 2003 to 2004. The results of the research showed that biomass from <b>prunning</b> of the hedgerows Flemengia congesta was significant to land fertility through improvement of nutrients availability, increasing pH, decreasing availability of aluminium (Al). The effect of biomass treatment into the soil to a high of 5. 0 ton/ha will increase average corn production from 22. 256 kw/ha (dry grain) to 37. 433 kw/ha or increase 68. 19 %, whereas the effect of organic matter 5. 0 ton/ha combined with dolomit 2. 5 ton/ha will increase average corn production from 22. 256 kw/ha to 47. 611 kw/ha or increase 113. 92 %. The effect of biomass 10. 0 ton/ha combined with dolomit 2. 5 ton/ha will increase average corn production from 22. 256 kw/ha to 50. 789 kw/ha or increase 128. 20 %...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyzed}} {{the influence of}} initial stand density on mean tree dbh,mean top height, mean height at the lowest branch, mean total tree volume, clear meanvolume, mean volume at 25 cm, 18 and 8 cm diameter, in loblolly pine plantations insouthern Brazil. Special attention is given to clear wood yield. The experiment wasestablished in the Jaguariaíva county, Paraná State, on the Pisa Florestal S. A. lands. Theexperiment was evaluated at several occasions since its establishment, but onlydata collectedin the last measurement (1999, at age 12) were used. The results indicated that large initalspacing determine more remarkable increase in dbh and other related variables (mean totaltree volume, mean volume at 25 cm, 18 and 8 cm diameter). No significant effect of standdensity on mean top height was noticed. It was also noticed that stand density affects knot formation; the higher the density the lower the height at the lowest branch and the lower theclear volume. It was concluded that if the key objective is wood yield for veneer (andsawnwood in some cases), it is recommendable to use larger stand spacings in combinationwith artificial <b>prunning.</b> When pruning is not feasible, the intermediate spacings (as 2. 5 x 2. 8 m) should be used, which may result in same clear wood yield as compared to largerspacings (as 2. 5 x 3. 6 m or larger) ...|$|E

By combining the two approaches called buttom-up and top-down, it also makes use of two special properties in the term of downward closure property and the upward closure property that have a functions to perform <b>prunning</b> candidate set so it can reduce calculation time. In line with it, to overcome these problems, it used algorithm Pincer Search method which is a completion from the algorithm Apriory. Goods? involvement is recently a trivial issue to some self-service industry, which is actually becoming a very good relationship linked to the industry. Naturally, consumer consumption patterns are changing {{and it can be}} utilized by the industry. Consumers? comsumption patterns can be pointed by having more attention between the each goods and placing the product in accordance with the value of goods that have been calculated accurately. Because there are too many items, the supermarkets do not pay attention to the layout of the product that is in storefronts and without any special calculations for forging the products, it is supported by taking less attention to some old datas on the self-service which were six months old datas. By promoting this software, it can provide information and advice for self-service management to some goods or products that have high sales value. This, the problem of goods placement can be fitted with the goods value...|$|E

Aerobic composting {{is one of the}} best known alternatives to treating these wastes. This study aimed to evaluate the applicability of composting as an alternative to the disposal of organic wastes from aquatic macrophytes Eichhornia crassipes and Salvinia auriculata collected in the reservoir UHE Luis Eduardo Magalhães, Tocantins, Brazil and also produce an organic compound from different combinations of macrophytes, <b>prunning</b> residues and organic waste generated by the Campus of Palmas of UFT, TO. The study was conducted in an area of 80 m² in unprotected environment at the experimental station of the Campus of Palmas. The experiments were done as three replications in the dry season (from 18. 09. 2008 to 11. 21. 2008) and rainy season (from 03. 09. 2009 to 05. 04. 2009) and the parameters temperature, pH, total nitrogen and carbon, and organic matter were monitored along with counts of microorganisms. It was possible to produce compost from the combinations of organic wastes within 65 days of composting during the dry season and 55 days in the rainy season. The aquatic macrophytes resulted in a good raw material for composting, since there is not a destination for the excess plant materials removed by the cleaning process of the reservoir...|$|E

Consideraram-se quatro casos: plantas que apresentavam 5, 4, 3 e 2 esporões, as quais foram corrigidas para 6 esporões, número médio observado em videiras adultas, quando o espaçamento entre plantas é de 1 metro. Nos cinco biênios estudados, as produções médias das plantas corrigidas para 6 esporões superaram as das não corrigidas, que apresentavam 5, 4, 3 e 2 esporões, em 12, 26, 60 e 158 por cento, respectivamente. In {{the present}} paper, studies {{carried out to}} {{evaluate}} the effect of correction of <b>prunning</b> on the yield of old Niagara Rosada vines trained on unilateral horizontal cordon are reported. In a ten years old vineyard, a survey was made to check the number of spurs per plant. It {{was found that the}} number of living spurs varied from 2 to 5. In 1960, part of the plants was prunned in order to establish 6 two-bud spurs on each one. An equal number of plants was kept with the original number of spurs. The yield was recorded for ten years. The data obtained indicated that plants with 6 two-bud spurs produced 12, 26, 60 and 158 per cent more than plants with 5, 4, 3 and 2 two-bud spurs respectively...|$|E
