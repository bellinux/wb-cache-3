In this essay, I argue that <b>peer</b> <b>review</b> as currently practiced conflates the sensible idea of getting comments on a paper with the irrevocably-flawed one that we either accept or reject the paper, which I term gatekeeping.

True <b>peer</b> <b>review</b> constitutes my proposal for replacing existing <b>peer</b> <b>review</b> systems.
