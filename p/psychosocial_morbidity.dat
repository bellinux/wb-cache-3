40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{examine the}} {{relation}} between low income and child <b>psychosocial</b> <b>morbidity</b> cross-sectionally and longitudinally. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey with follow-up. SETTING: Ontario. PARTICIPANTS: Children aged 4 to 16 years from families selected by means of stratified, clustered and random sampling of 1981 Canada Census data. Results {{were based on the}} responses of 2503 children interviewed in 1983 and 1076 re-interviewed in 1987. OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence rates of psychiatric disorders, poor school performance and social impairment. RESULTS: There was a significant relation between low income and <b>psychosocial</b> <b>morbidity,</b> with a threshold at an income level of less than $ 10, 000. Poor children 4 to 11 years of age were at greater risk of morbidity than poor children 12 to 16, but there were no significant age differences. Logistic regression revealed that low income and noneconomic factors (low maternal education and family dysfunction) shared significant independent influences on the prevalence of <b>psychosocial</b> <b>morbidity.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Low income is strongly associated with <b>psychosocial</b> <b>morbidity</b> in children. Both economic and noneconomic factors showed independent influences on morbidity. These findings have important clinical, scientific and policy implications...|$|E

40|$|Background & Aims: Patients with {{irritable}} bowel syndrome (IBS) {{have increased}} postprandial symptom responses and more <b>psychosocial</b> <b>morbidities</b> than healthy individuals. However, the relationship between psychosocial status and postprandial symptom responses has not been studied in patients with IBS. We investigated this relationship in a prospective study of patients with IBS. Methods: One hundred and ninety-three IBS patients, diagnosed according to Rome II (n= 126) or Rome III (n= 67) criteria, consumed a standard breakfast (540 kcal: 36 % fat, 15 % proteins, 49 % carbohydrates, and 8. 9 g fiber). They completed visual analogue scales assessing the severity of 5 gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain, bloating, nausea, gas, and fullness) before breakfast and every 30 minutes, up to 240 minutes after eating. All patients completed validated self-report questionnaires for current levels of anxiety and depression; those diagnosed based on Rome II criteria also completed a somatization questionnaire. The relationship between these variables and the course of gastrointestinal symptom scores over time was analyzed using linear mixed models, controlling for co-morbid functional dyspepsia. Results: We observed a main effect of anxiety levels on fullness and bloating (P<. 04), and of depression levels on abdominal pain (P=. 007), reflecting a general upward shift of the entire symptom curve. Depression-by-time interactions were seen for nausea and gas (P<. 03). Somatization levels had a main effect on all 5 symptoms (P<. 0001), independent of anxiety and depression. We observed somatization-by-time interaction effects for bloating (P=. 005), and nausea (P=. 02), and a non-significant trend was found for pain (P=. 054), reflecting a steeper early post-prandial increase in symptoms among subjects {{with higher levels of}} somatization. Conclusion: Based on a prospective study of patients with IBS, <b>psychosocial</b> <b>morbidities</b> are associated with increased levels of gastrointestinal symptoms in general.

Method: One hundred fifteen families were assessed longitudinally 6 weeks (time 1), 6 months (time 2), and 13 months (time 3) after the death of a parent (constituting 670 individual responses) on measures of grief intensity, psychological state, social adjustment, and family coping. A previously described typology of perceptions of family functioning was applied. Repeated measures multivariate analysis of variance based on both individuals and families and post hoc comparisons of significant results were undertaken. Results: Sullen families displayed the most intense grief and the most severe <b>psychosocial</b> <b>morbidity.</b> Well-functioning families (supportive and conflict-resolving) resolved their grief and adjusted move adaptively than their dysfunctional counterparts (intermediate, sullen, and hostile families). There were no cluster-by-time interactions. The clusters accounted for 15. 7 % of the variance in depression (Beck Depression Inventory) and 27. 9 % of the variance in social functioning (Social Adjustment Scale). Well-functioning families used more family coping strategies (Family Crisis Oriented Personal Evaluation Scales). Conclusions: More intense grief and greater <b>psychosocial</b> <b>morbidity</b> are found in sullen, hostile, and intermediate bereaved families than in the more adaptive supportive and conflict-resolving types.

The purpose of the current study was to characterize the frequency/severity of functional impairment as well as identify significant neurocognitive and psychosocial determinants of functional impairment. English-speaking child-parent dyads were enrolled in the study. Children were between the ages of four and nineteen years and were at least 2 years post diagnosis with leukemia/lymphoma. Participants were recruited through a pediatric oncology late effects clinic where parents completed psychosocial and functional impairment questionnaires while a brief neuropsychological exam was administered to children. Results found that 26 % of participants were identified as demonstrating significant functional impairment. However, the one significant predictor of functional impairment was parental stress. While children demonstrated both neurocognitive deficits and functional impairments, neurocognitive deficits did not predict these functional difficulties.

40|$|CONTEXT: No {{study has}} {{documented}} how symptomatic morbidity varies across the {{body mass index}} (BMI) spectrum (underweight, normal weight, overweight and obese) or across the entire child and adolescent age range. OBJECTIVE: To (1) quantify physical and <b>psychosocial</b> <b>morbidities</b> experienced by 2 - 18 -year-olds according to BMI status and (2) explore morbidity patterns by age. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Cross-sectional data from two Australian population studies (the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children and the Health of Young Victorians Study) were collected during 2000 - 2006. Participants were grouped into five age bands: 2 - 3 (n= 4606), 4 - 5 (n= 4983), 6 - 7 (n= 4464), 8 - 12 (n= 1541) and 13 - 18 (n= 928) years. MAIN MEASURES: Outcomes-Parent- and self-reported global health; physical, psychosocial and mental health; special health-care needs; wheeze; asthma and sleep problems. Exposure-measured BMI (kg m(- 2)) categorised using standard international cutpoints. ANALYSES: The variation in comorbidities across BMI categories within and between age bands was examined using linear and logistic regression models. RESULTS: Comorbidities varied with BMI category for all except sleep problems, generally showing the highest levels for the obese category. However, patterns differed markedly between age groups. In particular, poorer global health and special health-care needs were associated with underweight in young children, but obesity in older children. Prevalence of poorer physical health varied little by BMI in 2 - 5 -year-olds, but from 6 to 7 years was increasingly associated with obesity. Normal-weight children tended to experience the best psychosocial and mental health, with little evidence that the U-shaped associations of these variables with BMI status varied by age. Wheeze and asthma increased slightly with BMI at all ages. CONCLUSIONS: Deviation from normal weight is associated with health differences {{in children and adolescents}} that vary by morbidity and age. As well as lowering risks for later disease, promoting normal body weight appears central to improving {{the health and well-being of}} the young...|$|R

As {{a part of a}} more general investigation (Southern European Psycho-Oncology Study-SEPOS), the rate of <b>psychosocial</b> <b>morbidity</b> and its correlation with clinical and cultural variables were examined in cancer patients in Italy, Portugal and Spain. METHODS: A convenience sample of cancer outpatients with good performance status and no cognitive impairment were approached. The Hospital Anxiety-Depression scale (HAD-S), the Mini-Mental Adjustment to Cancer scale (Mini-MAC), and the Cancer Worries Inventory (CWI) were used to measure psychological morbidity, coping strategies and concerns about illness. RESULTS: Of 277 patients, 34 % had pathological scores ("borderline cases" plus "true cases") on HAD-S Anxiety and 24. 9 % on HAD-S Depression. Total psychiatric "caseness" was 28. 5 % and 16. 6 %, according to different HAD cut-offs (14 and 19, respectively). Significant relationships of HAD-S Anxiety, HAD-S Depression, HAD-S Total score, with Mini-MAC Hopeless and Anxious Preoccupation, and CWI score were found. No differences emerged between countries on <b>psychosocial</b> <b>morbidity,</b> while some differences emerged between the countries on coping mechanisms. Furthermore, Fatalism, Avoidance and marginally Hopeless were higher compared to studies carried out in English-speaking countries. LIMITATIONS: The relatively small sample size and the good performance status prevent us to generalize data on patients with different cancer sites and advanced phase of illness.

40|$|GOALS OF WORK: Recent {{literature}} has indicated {{the need for}} rapid evaluation of psychosocial issues secondary to cancer. Because {{of the problems of}} routine use of psychometric instruments, short instruments such as visual analogue scales or one-item 0 - 10 scales have been developed as valid assessment alternatives. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A study was conducted to examine the role of two 0 - 10 scales in measuring emotional stress (distress thermometer, DT) and depressed mood (mood thermometer, MT), respectively, in a multicenter study carried out in southern European countries (Italy, Portugal, Spain, and Switzerland). A convenience sample of 312 cancer outpatients completed the DT and MT and the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS). MAIN RESULTS: DT was more significantly associated HADS anxiety than HADS depression while MT was related both to HADS anxiety and depression. The correlation of MT with HADS was higher than DT. A cutoff point > 4 on the DT maximized sensitivity (65 %) and specificity (79 %) for general <b>psychosocial</b> <b>morbidity</b> while a cutoff > 5 identified more severe "caseness" (sensitivity= 70 %; specificity= 73 %). On the MT, sensitivity and specificity for general <b>psychosocial</b> <b>morbidity</b> were 85 % and 72 % by using the cutoff score > 3. A score > 4 on the MT was associated with a sensitivity of 78 % and a specificity of 77 % in detecting more severe caseness.

Fifteen patients (25 %) received additional postoperative radiation therapy. The median follow-up period was 10 years (range 1 - 37 years). Long-term cure rate was 82 % and long-term recurrence rate 18 %. Visual fields/visual acuity stabilized or improved in 74 % of cases. The long-term prevalence rate of hypopituitarism was 89 %. In addition, long-term cardiovascular, neurological and <b>psychosocial</b> <b>morbidity</b> rates were high: 22 % (risk factors 57 %), 49 % and 47 %, respectively. Female sex was an independent predictor of increased cardiovascular, neurological and <b>psychosocial</b> <b>morbidity</b> (odds ratio 3. 78, P = 0. 031). Ten patients (18 %) died during an 828 person-year follow-up. The actuarial patient survival rates 5, 10 and 20 years after the initial operation were 95, 85 and 85 %, respectively.

40|$|Tourette {{syndrome}} (TS) is {{a common}} neuropsychiatric disorder named for French doctor Georges Gilles de la Tourette, who first described the condition in 1885. The core symptoms of TS include multiple motor tics and one or more phonic tics, which last {{for more than a}} year. The tics may be simple or complex in nature and vary in number, frequency and severity over time. Comorbid disorders include anxiety, depression, learning difficulties and sleep disorders, although attention deficit/ hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) are most common. Tourette's is no longer considered a rare condition, but it may not always be correctly identified because most cases are classified as mild. Genetic and environmental factors {{play a role in the}} etiology of Tourette's, but the exact causes are unknown. In most cases, medication is unnecessary.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{provide insight into the}} <b>psychosocial</b> <b>morbidity</b> and itch cognitions of {{patients}} with chronic pruritic skin disease and to develop, test and implement a nursing programme, to help patients to cope with itch. In a study of 168 patients, it became clear that patients with a pruritic skin disease often have a high level of <b>psychosocial</b> <b>morbidity.</b> The most important predictor of <b>psychosocial</b> <b>morbidity</b> is catastrophizing and helpless coping strategies; frequency and intensity of itching and scratching and the demographic variables age and sex were also significant, but less important predictors. The nursing programme 'Coping with Itch', which supplements dermatological treatment as usual, is intended to reduce itch and <b>psychosocial</b> <b>morbidity</b> related to itch, and to help the patient to cope with his or her itch. The programme consists of dermatological education and cognitive behavioural interventions. A randomized controlled study (RCT) was carried out, showing that the programme led to a faster reduction in the frequency of itching and scratching and to a faster reduction in catastrophizing and helpless coping in patients with chronic pruritic skin diseases as compared to a control group receiving usual dermatological treatment. Implementation of innovative programs in health care is difficult: therefore we evaluated the feasibility of the program. The programme proved to be feasible in a dermatology outpatient department. A tailored implementation approach was used to solve discrepancies between the (structural, human resource, political and cultural) characteristics of the organizations and the requirements of the innovative nursing intervention. This approach has led to the successful implementation of the nursing programme in five hospitals in the Netherlands. Nurses are able to carry out the programme and all five hospitals continued the itch clinic after completion of the implementation study. Cost and cost effectiveness of the programme were also explored. Most of the costs of the nursing programme 'Coping with itch' were incurred during {{the first three months of}} the study. The point-estimate of the incremental effectiveness ratio for the first three months of study was € 129. 91 per gained day with little itch. Benefits in terms of days with little itch persisted and increased beyond three months, thus leading to a more favourable incremental cost effectiveness ratio of € 1. 02 per day with little itch. The current findings suggest that the 'Coping with itch' programme is worthwhile on the short term. The period of effectiveness with regard to the reduction of itching and scratching may be lengthened by a longer follow-up to the itch clinic, and making use of telephone contact or E-health. Research to investigate which patients with regard to diagnosis of skin disease and level of itching and scratching, benefit most from the 'Coping with Itch' programme is recommended as a next step in research...|$|E

Importantly, further evidence of the effectiveness of family therapy for anorexia nervosa and short-term benefits from intervention programs have been published. Summary The research base that will influence clinical practice in child and adolescent eating disorders is increasing. More research is required in all areas of intervention...|$|R

This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract The {{dramatic increase in}} diagnostic rates of bipolar disorder {{in children and adolescents}} in the USA has led to an intense interest in the phenomenology of the disorder. Here we present data from a newly-developed instrument to assess episodic mania-like symptoms in youth in a large population-based sample (N= 5326) using parentand self-report. We found that a substantial proportion of children screened positive for having episodes of “going high ” and were at an increased risk for morbidity and impairment. Using factor analysis, we identified that episodic mania-like symptoms comprised two dimensions: An under-controlled dimension that was associated with significant impairment, and a low-risk exuberant dimension. Using latent class analysis, we identified a small group of children scoring high on a range of manic symptoms and suffering from severe <b>psychosocial</b> impairment and <b>morbidity.</b> Our results carry implications for the Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article (doi: 10. 1007 /s 10802 - 011 - 9520 - 8) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Anorexia nervosa (AN) is {{a serious}} {{psychiatric}} illness associated with significant medical and psychiatric <b>morbidity,</b> <b>psychosocial</b> impairment, increased risk of death, and chronicity. Given {{the severity of the}} disorder, the establishment of safe and effective treatments is necessary. Several treatments have been tried in AN, but few favorable results have emerged. This paper reviews randomized controlled trials in AN, and provides a synthesis of existing data regarding the efficacy, safety, and adherence associated with pharmacologic and psychological interventions. Randomized controlled trials for the treatment of AN published in peer-reviewed journals were identified by electronic and manual searches. Overall, pharmacotherapy has limited benefits in the treatment of AN, with some promising preliminary findings associated with olanzapine, an antipsychotic agent. No single psychological intervention has demonstrated clear superiority in treating adults with AN. In adolescents with AN, the evidence base is strongest for the use of family therapy over alternative individual psychotherapies. Results highlight challenges in both treating individuals with AN and in studying the effects of those treatments, and further emphasize the importance of continued efforts to develop novel interventions. Treatment trials currently underway and areas for future research are discussed...|$|R
