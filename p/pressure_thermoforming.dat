50|$|For {{several years}} now, at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), a {{pressure}} or high <b>pressure</b> (<b>thermo)forming</b> process {{is used to}} fabricate film microchips for capillary electrophoresis (CE) 3-5 and for three-dimensional cell cultivation 6-8. The process {{is derived from the}} macroscopic trapped sheet forming process 2. This is a simple variation of vacuum or pressure forming without prestretching, i.e. a single stage forming, into a female mould with heating of the plastic sheet using a contact heating plate inside the forming station. The forming air is supplied via through holes in the heating plate. Still in a laboratory scale process, diverse thermoplastic films also from biodegradable polymers such as polycaprolactone (PCL) with thicknesses typically between 20 and 100 µm are thermoformed. This is performed with gas pressures up to 5 MPa into mechanically micromachined cavities of plate shaped micromoulds from brass.|$|E
30|$|The results {{confirm a}} direct {{dependency}} between the aligner {{material and the}} magnitude of force delivery, as has been described in preliminary investigations [7, 9 – 11]. The Fx and Fz values for the Biolon® aligners {{were significantly higher than}} those for the two other materials tested (Erkodur® and Ideal Clear®). Apart from different material properties comprising individual elastic moduli [22], the manufacturing process plays a crucial role in force delivery strength. The Biolon® appliances were prepared by using 6  bar overpressures; while in the Erkodur® and Ideal Clear® appliances, a 0.8  bar under <b>pressure</b> was used. <b>Thermoforming</b> using high positive overpressure leads to more precise fitting of the appliance on the individual oral structures. Depending on the degree of better play of the appliance in the anterior region, where a tooth is tipped, complete deformation of the aligner results. Superior fit and, consequently, higher friction generate higher restoring force components. A space holder foil of 0.05  mm was additionally used for Erkodur® appliance preparation. Friction was decreased, resulting in a reduced force application compared to the two other test materials.|$|R
