5|$|In {{his final}} analysis, Tokushi Kasahara looks at {{documents}} and diaries recorded by {{soldiers of the}} Japanese Army and concludes that at least 80,000 Chinese soldiers and POWs, or possibly over 100,000, were massacred by the Japanese, which was most of the estimated total force of 150,000 soldiers. Kasahara notes that Smythe's survey proves that a bare minimum of 12,000 ordinary civilians were massacred within Nanking, though other contemporary sources gives figures between 50,000 and 100,000, <b>plus</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> another 26,870 outside Nanking. Kasahara generally concludes that the death toll must have been well over 100,000, and possibly around 200,000. His more specific range of figures is roughly 160,000 to 170,000.|$|E

500|$|The Appaloosa is {{best known}} for its distinctive, {{preferred}} leopard complex-spotted coat. Spotting occurs in several overlay patterns on one of several recognized base coat colors. There are three other distinctive, [...] "core" [...] characteristics: mottled skin, striped hooves, and eyes with a white sclera. Skin mottling is usually seen around the muzzle, eyes, anus, and genitalia. Striped hooves are a common trait, quite noticeable on Appaloosas, but not unique to the breed. [...] The sclera is the part of the eye surrounding the iris; although all horses show white around the eye if the eye is rolled back, to have a readily visible white sclera with the eye in a normal position is a distinctive characteristic seen more often in Appaloosas than in other breeds. Because the occasional individual is born with little or no visible spotting pattern, the ApHC allows [...] "regular" [...] registration of horses with mottled skin <b>plus</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> one of the other core characteristics.
