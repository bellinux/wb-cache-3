Asymmetric synthesis of chiral <b>phosphorus</b> <b>compounds</b> via transition-metal-mediated (TMM) chemistry, with its possibility to modify reaction conditions and to control stereochemistry of phosphorus through coordination, holds promise as a synthetic avenue for synthesis of new phosphorus materials. This thesis focuses on a novel method to synthesize chiral pentavalent <b>phosphorus</b> <b>compounds</b> via optical induction from transition metal complexes and examines the chemistry of the resulting inorganometallic phosphorus moieties for further transformations. [...] Three series of Co-, P-chiral Co(III) complexes are synthesized via transition- metal-mediated (TMM) Arbuzov reactions. The structures and spectroscopic properties are described and the reactivity of the synthesized chiral phosphonate moieties are examined. Unlike their organic analogs, the inorganometallic phosphonates are inert to nucleophiles. Reaction with PCl₅or SOCl₂ under prolonged heating cleaves the Co-P bond. In the presence of BCI₃, the perfluoro-substituted P- phosphito Co(III) complex reacts with the nucleophile to give a novel product, which involves C-F bond cleavage. [...] The LUMOs of the inorganometallic phosphonates and their organic analogs are analysed at the Hückel level. The LUMOs of the inorganometallic phosphonates are metal-based while those of their organic analogs are dominated by the orbitals of phosphorus centre.

40|$|The present {{doctoral}} research {{describes the}} impact of diffuse and point sources on the pollution of the hydrosphere with nitrogen and <b>phosphorus</b> <b>compounds</b> in the Goričko Landscape Park research area. The Goričko Landscape Park research area was divided into three parts: the River Basin of the Ledava, Velika Krka rivers, and the Kobilje Creek. In this manner, {{we were able to}} perform a comparative analysis inside the Landscape Park and in three sub-areas. In the scope of the methodological research we established that the comparison of the structure of use of the land among these three areas revealed certain differences. In the scope of the research we performed the monitoring of the liquid hydrosphere and researched the chemical status of the surface flowing water in the Goričko Landscape Park area. Within all three sub-areas significantly higher concentrations of nitrogen and <b>phosphorus</b> <b>compounds</b> were found in the water.
