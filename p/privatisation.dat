5|$|After the {{collapse}} of public enterprises during the late 1980s, <b>privatisation</b> became strongly popular. Menem privatised almost everything the state owned, except {{for a couple of}} banks. In terms of service there were indisputable improvements. For example, before the telephone <b>privatisation,</b> to get a new line it was not unusual to wait more than ten years, and apartments with telephone lines carried a big premium in the market. After <b>privatisation</b> the wait was reduced to less than a week. Productivity increased as investment modernised farms, factories and ports. However, in all cases, there were large outlays of employees. In addition, the process of <b>privatisation</b> was suspected of corruption in many cases. Ultimately, the privatised enterprises became private (rather than public) monopolies. Their tariffs on long-term contracts were raised in line with American inflation, even though prices in Argentina were falling.|$|E

40|$|This paper adds new {{empirical}} {{evidence to the}} political economy literature of economic reform. One of the main contributions {{of this paper is}} the development of a novel methodology to identify <b>privatisations.</b> The methodology is a combination of the Bai & Perron structural break filter, and validation of the breaks identified by this filter using de jure evidence of reforms. 21 de facto healthcare financing <b>privatisations</b> are identified in a sample of 23 OECD countries. It is analysed which factors trigger or hinder these <b>privatisations.</b> Robust evidence is found in favour of the ‘crises induce reform hypothesis’. That is, severe economic recessions, high levels of unemployment and high interest rates on government debt trigger <b>privatisations.</b> Contrary to theory and conventional wisdom, robust evidence is found that political factors do not have an impact. Ideology, government or political fractionalisation, or major cabinet changes are not found to significantly affect the likelihood of healthcare financing <b>privatisations.</b> ...|$|R

5|$|Before <b>privatisation,</b> the King's Cross {{area had}} a {{reputation}} for run-down buildings and prostitution services in front of the main entrance. A major clean-up took place during the 1990s and the station's atmosphere was much improved {{by the end of the}} decade.|$|E
5|$|By {{the mid-1980s}} {{closure of the}} {{stations}} was being considered, and in 1984, was considered for a {{combined heat and power}} scheme. After the <b>privatisation</b> of the Central Electricity Generating Board in 1989, the stations passed into the ownership of National Power. After almost 37 years of use they were decommissioned in May 1991 as outdated and uneconomical to operate. They had been overtaken technologically, and had lower generating capacity than newer plants such as Drax. Their closure coincided with that {{of a large number of}} coal mines in the North East of England, just after the <b>privatisation</b> of both the electricity industry and the National Coal Board in the early 1990s.|$|E

5|$|In 1986, Sessional Paper Number 1 was {{published}} by the Government of Kenya, outlining the country's need for economic development and growth. The document stressed the government opinion that the airline {{would be better off}} privately owned, thus resulting in the first <b>privatisation</b> attempt. The government named Philip Ndegwa as Chairman of the Board in 1991, with specific orders to make the airline a privately owned company. In 1992, the Public Enterprise Reform paper {{was published}}, giving Kenya Airways priority among national companies in Kenya to be privatised. Ndegwa was succeeded by Isaac Omolo Okero. In , Brian Davies, was appointed as the new managing director of the company. Davies had been previously hired to carry out a study of viability on <b>privatisation,</b> working for British Airways' Speedwing consulting arm. Swissair was the first company to provide Kenya Airways with <b>privatisation</b> advice. In the fiscal year 1993 to 1994, the airline produced its first profit since the start of commercialisation. In 1994, the International Finance Corporation was appointed to provide assistance in the <b>privatisation</b> process, which effectively began in 1995. A large aviation industry partner was sought to acquire 40% of the shares, with another 40% reserved for private investors and the government keeping the remaining stake. The government would absorb almost million in debts and would convert another million it provided in loans into equity; after reorganisation, the company would have a debt of approximate million. British Airways, KLM, Lufthansa and South African Airways were among the airlines expressing interest in taking a stake in Kenya Airways.|$|E

[...] He promised that the jobs of workers affected by the <b>privatisations</b> would be safeguarded but warned unprofitable businesses would be closed down.|$|R
5|$|In July 1989, it was {{announced}} that SBG was to be privatised. In an effort to make Kelvin Scottish more attractive on the approach to <b>privatisation,</b> Kelvin was merged with Central Scottish to form Kelvin Central Buses Ltd.

5|$|Some of the privatised industries, {{including}} gas, water, and electricity, were natural monopolies {{for which}} <b>privatisation</b> involved little increase in competition. The privatised industries that demonstrated improvement sometimes did so while still under state ownership. British Steel Corporation had made great gains in profitability while still a nationalised industry under the government-appointed MacGregor chairmanship, which faced down trade-union opposition to close plants and halve the workforce. Regulation was also significantly expanded {{to compensate for}} the loss of direct government control, with the foundation of regulatory bodies such as Oftel (1984), Ofgas (1986), and the National Rivers Authority (1989). There was no clear pattern to the degree of competition, regulation, and performance among the privatised industries; in most cases <b>privatisation</b> benefited consumers in terms of lower prices and improved efficiency, but the results overall are said to have been mixed.|$|E
5|$|The {{party had}} no strong {{economic}} preferences, and generally supported a mixed economy.

5|$|The <b>privatisation</b> {{of public}} assets was {{combined}} with financial deregulation {{in an attempt}} to fuel economic growth. Chancellor Geoffrey Howe abolished the UK's exchange controls in 1979, which allowed more capital to be invested in foreign markets, and the Big Bang of 1986 removed many restrictions on the London Stock Exchange.|$|E
5|$|After {{being elected}} {{president}} in 2002, Ravalomanana remained a prominent {{player in the}} private sector.
