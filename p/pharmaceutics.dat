5|$|In ancient China {{lists of}} {{different}} plants and herb concoctions for pharmaceutical purposes {{date back to}} at least {{the time of the}} Warring States (481 BC-221 BC). Many Chinese writers over the centuries contributed to the written knowledge of herbal <b>pharmaceutics.</b> The Han Dynasty (202 BC-220 AD) includes the notable work of the Huangdi Neijing and the famous pharmacologist Zhang Zhongjing. There were also the 11th century scientists and statesmen Su Song and Shen Kuo who compiled learned treatises on natural history, emphasising herbal medicine.|$|E
5|$|From about 1040, Shen's {{family moved}} around Sichuan {{province}} {{and finally to}} the international seaport at Xiamen, where Shen's father accepted minor provincial posts in each new location. Shen Zhou also served several years in the prestigious capital judiciary, {{the equivalent of a}} federal supreme court. Shen Kuo took notice of the various towns and rural features of China as his family traveled, while he became interested during his youth in the diverse topography of the land. He also observed the intriguing aspects of his father's engagement in administrative governance and the managerial problems involved; these experiences had a deep impact on him as he later became a government official. Since he often became ill as a child, Shen Kuo also developed a natural curiosity about medicine and <b>pharmaceutics.</b>|$|E

25|$|Pharmaceutical formulation, in <b>pharmaceutics,</b> is {{the process}} in which {{different}} chemical substances, including the active drug, are combined to produce a final medicinal product. The word formulation is often used {{in a way that}} includes dosage form.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, {{worldwide}} annual production {{stood at}} approximately 1,600,000 tons. More than 50% of this volume {{was produced in}} China. More than 50% was used as acidity regulator in beverages, some 20% in other food applications, 20% for detergent applications and 10% for related applications other than food, such as cosmetics, <b>pharmaceutics</b> and in the chemical industry.|$|E

25|$|Abruzzo's {{industrial}} sector expanded rapidly, especially in mechanical engineering, transportation equipment and telecommunications. The structure of {{production in the}} region reflects {{the transformation of the}} economy from agriculture to industry and services. Although industry has developed strongly, it retains weak points due to the existence of only a few large businesses alongside a huge fabric of small and medium-sized businesses. Both pure and applied research are carried out in the region, where there are major institutes and factories involved in research in the fields of <b>pharmaceutics,</b> biomedicine, electronics, aerospace and nuclear physics. The industrial infrastructure is spread throughout the region in industrial zones which have already been mentioned, the most important of which are Val Pescara, Val Sangro, Val Trigno, Val Vibrata and Conca del Fucino. A further activity worthy of note is seaside and mountain tourism, which is of considerable importance to the economy of the region. Agriculture, involving small holdings, has succeeded in modernising and offering high-quality products. The mostly small, agricultural holdings produce wine, cereals, sugar beet, potatoes, olives, vegetables, fruit and dairy products. Traditional products are saffron and liquorice. Most famous in the world is Abruzzo's wine Montepulciano d'Abruzzo; in the late 20th and early 21st century, Montepulciano d'Abruzzo earned a reputation as being {{one of the most widely}} exported DOC classed wine in Italy.|$|E
25|$|Sweden emerged unharmed by World War II. The Swedish {{non-alignment}} policy officially remained – Sweden rejected NATO membership but {{joined the}} United Nations and later EFTA. Tage Erlander (s) was Prime Minister from 1946 to 1969 – {{a period of}} exceptional economic and social prosperity, and generally low unemployment, but the housing situation posed problems {{as more and more}} people moved to the cities. Responding to the housing shortage, the government introduced the Million Programme – a national wave of suburban development with the aim of creating a million homes from 1965 to 1974. This period saw the beginning of large-scale immigration to a country that used {{to be one of the}} more ethnically homogeneous in the world. The first phase of immigration consisted of workers from southern Europe, who were actively wooed over by campaigns of advertisement and recruitment in their home countries, for instance Italy & Austria. In the 1970s and 1980s many refugees with families arrived from e.g. Chile, Kurdistan, Vietnam & Somalia, some of them with refugee status, others on the immigration quota. At the same time, the economy was entering less powerfully prosperous times: while Sweden continues to be a thoroughly industrialized nation with many businesses of cutting-edge innovation, especially in telephonics, energy management, chemicals, <b>pharmaceutics</b> & food industry, this growth both in production and complication is not generating a great amount of new employment in Sweden anymore, and therefore did not swallow the generations who have grown up since 1980.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first five}} {{above-ground}} {{floors of the}} 12-storey building are designed as an open-concept atrium, as described above. These floors are designated for study spaces and administrative offices. The remaining seven top floors, seen from the outside as a larger square atop the atrium with patterned glass windows, {{is home to the}} Leslie Dan Faculty of Pharmacy's researchers, graduate students, post-doctoral fellows and professors, along with numerous research labs, the Professional Practice Laboratory, and the Patheon <b>Pharmaceutics</b> Teaching Laboratory. The sixth through eighth floors are mainly used for student laboratories, tutorial and meeting rooms, as well as the faculty and research staff studying the social, economical, epidemiological and practical aspects of pharmacy and <b>pharmaceutics,</b> along with clinical research. The remaining floors are reserved for the pharmaceutical science [...] "wet labs" [...] (though many primary faculty members are located in the new Terrence Donnelly Centre for Cellular and Biomolecular Research and the MaRS Centre).|$|E
2500|$|Billman's {{research}} has focused on cardiovascular physiology with an emphasis on ventricular fibrillation (VF) and the cardiovascular system's response to stress. His work has led to non-invasive (electrocardiograph) techniques to detect susceptibility to sudden cardiac death (SCD) in dogs. These electrocardiographic [...] markers have subsequently been used clinically on humans. Billman has studied the effects of omega-3 fatty acids on the heart and circulatory system. He has also studied the effects of exercise training and novel <b>pharmaceutics</b> on the test subject's susceptibility to fatal cardiac arrhythmias. He has performed experiments on live research dogs and using isolated ventricular myocytes.|$|E
2500|$|For {{thousands}} of years G. glabra {{has been used for}} medicinal purposes including indigestion and stomach inflammation. Some other medicinal purposes are cough suppression, ulcer treatment, and use as a laxative. Also, salts of GZA can be used in many products as sweeteners and aromatizers. The major use of licorice goes towards the tobacco industry, at roughly 90% of usage. The rest is split evenly between food and <b>pharmaceutics,</b> at 5% of usage each (Federal Register, 1983). Licorice extract is often found in sweets and many candies, some drugs, and beverages like root beer. They can also be used in chewing gum, tobacco products like snuff, and toothpaste.|$|E
2500|$|In 1932, Bayer sought medical {{applications}} of its dyes. Gerhard Domagk {{identified as an}} antibacterial a red azo dye, introduced in 1935 as the first antibacterial drug, prontosil, soon found at Pasteur Institute to be a prodrug degraded in vivo into sulfanilamide – a colorless intermediate for many, highly colorfast azo dyes – already with an expired patent, synthesized in 1908 in Vienna by the researcher Paul Gelmo for his doctoral research. [...] By the 1940s, over 500 related sulfa drugs were produced. Medications in high demand during World War II (1939–45), these first miracle drugs, chemotherapy of wide effectiveness, propelled the American <b>pharmaceutics</b> industry. [...] In 1939, at Oxford University, seeking an alternative to sulfa drugs, Howard Florey developed Fleming's penicillin into the first systemic antibiotic drug, penicillin G. (Gramicidin, developed by René Dubos at Rockefeller Institute in 1939, was the first antibiotic, yet its toxicity restricted it to topical use.) [...] After World War II, Cornelius P. Rhoads introduced the chemotherapeutic approach to cancer treatment.|$|E
