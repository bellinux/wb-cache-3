It also saw a change in the Echos appearance, with a new shape, bolder typefaces and clearer printing.

For further information about Brook Andrew’s work see [URL] colonial archive’s store of ethnographic images was a rich source for Australian Indigenous artists in the 1990 s. The archive is dangerous territory as the images therein form an integral component of the project of colonialism itself. Indeed, it was an awareness of this power of the image and its role in the construction of “Aboriginality” that provided the motivation for artists such as Leah King-Smith, Fiona Foley and Gordon Bennett to return to the archive. One strategy they adopted in their appropriation of historical imagery was to recontextualise ethnographic photographs, and the circumstances of their production, within narratives of dispossession. King-Smith’s series, Patterns of Connection (1992), in which nineteenth-century images of Aboriginal people in the collection of the State Library of Victoria are incorporated in <b>photo-compositions,</b> was one of the early examples of this form of corrective process. At the same time as these artists were drawing on and re-presenting ethnographic images of Indigenous peoples, the museum and library sector was itself reviewing the manner in which the ethnographic photographs in their collections were displayed. Protocols were developed that acknowledged that the power of these photographs lay not only in the way they purported to document the past, but also in their contribution to the present. These protocols restricted the display of such photographs because of the distress the images may cause to some Indigenous viewers. The display of the photographs was also restricted because of the agency that these images retained in the continuing construction of “Aboriginality” through the re-enactment of the colonial gaze.

40|$|This thesis {{contributes}} to the growing scholarly interest in connections with Australia’s past through localised, individual stories. While much of this scholarship has focused on literature and the writings of cultural historians, this thesis concentrates on ways of visually recovering the memory of historical figures in relation to land through examining a unique form of portraiture which I have termed ‘imagined’. The concept of imagined portraiture is distinguished from more conventional modes of portraiture using analyses of traditional portraiture by Richard Brilliant, Omar Calabrese and Catherine Soussloff. Imagined portraits, as I have defined them in my thesis, result from a temporal separation between subject and artist and involve {{a high degree of}} projection of the artist’s self in portraying the absent subject. In contrast to naturalistic posthumous portraits which suppress the artist’s identity as maker of the image to preserve external likeness, imagined portraits reflect the persona of the artist as much as the subject of the portrait. This thesis is structured around imagined portraits by five Australian artists: Sidney Nolan’s paintings of Ned Kelly, John Lendis’s paintings of Lady Jane Franklin, Anne Ferran’s photographic portrayals of female convicts, Leah King-Smith’s <b>photo-compositions</b> of Victorian Aboriginal people, and Julie Dowling’s paintings of her ancestors. In all of the artworks under consideration person and place are intimately bound and inseparably recalled. Land is central to the identity of the subjects, but {{it is also important to}} each artist’s own relationship between self and place. The artists studied in this thesis bond with historical figures to connect with Australia’s past and form, or repair, meaningful attachments to the land. Using an interdisciplinary approach, I draw on the theoretical writings of philosophers Edward Casey and Jeff Malpas, historian Peter Read and feminist scholar on race and gender issues bell hooks to contend that knowledge of the past is critical to constructions of place and identity. Due to the imaginative nature of the portrayal of the figures and the fusion with land, many of the featured artworks have not previously been considered portraits. Doing so enables a fresh perspective which highlights that an individual who actually existed lies at the core of each image. I argue that this is crucial to the artwork’s capacity to arouse empathy with current-day viewers – something that is underscored by theorists of historical fiction, such as Herbert Butterfield, Georg Lukács and Jerome de Groot. The historical subjects portrayed in this thesis are outsiders, many of whom have a troubled place in mainstream Australian history. Imagined portraits activate remembrance of these figures. They can contribute to the memory of those already mythicised, or recover individuals who were previously marginalised or excluded from Australian history. The imagined portraits featured in this thesis expose historical myths, gaps and silences while providing meaningful ways to connect with the past and negotiate displacement...|$|R

The modernization of AUP's printing shop meant that, while some employees were re-trained on the new machines, many more employees were laid off as their jobs were made redundant.

5000|$|Adrian Frutiger's first {{commercial}} typeface was [...] — {{a set of}} titling capital letters with small, bracketed serifs, released in 1954. A calligraphic, informal, script face, [...] ("wave" [...] in French), also was released in 1954. In 1955, , a glyphic, old-style, serif text face was released. The typeface shows inspiration by Nicolas Jenson, and, in the [...] type, Frutiger's ideas of letter construction, unity, and organic form, are first expressed together. Raph Levien described as a [...] "Frutiger trademark" [...] his common use of an [...] "a" [...] where the loop makes a horizontal line at the top on meeting the vertical. It makes use of narrow wedge serifs, a style sometimes known as Latin which Frutiger would often use in his future serif designs. In 1956, he designed his first-of-three, slab-serif typefaces — Egyptienne, on the Clarendon model; after Univers, it was the second, new text face to be commissioned for <b>photo-composition.</b>|$|E

Impressed {{by the success of}} the Bauer foundry's Futura typeface, [...] {{encouraged}} a new, geometric sans-serif type in competition. Frutiger disliked the regimentation of Futura, and persuaded [...] that the new sans-serif should be based on the realist (neo-grotesque) model. The 1896 face, Akzidenz-Grotesk, is cited as the primary model. To maintain unity across the 21 variants, each weight and width, in roman (upright) and oblique (slanted), was drawn and approved before any matrices were cut. In the Univers font, Frutiger introduced his two-digit numeration; the first digit (3 though 8) indicates the weight, [...] "3" [...] the lightest, [...] "8" [...] the heaviest. The second digit indicates the face-width and either roman or oblique. It was marketed with a design inspired by the periodic table. The response to Univers was immediate and positive; he claimed it became the model for his future typefaces. His slab serif designs Serifa (1967) and Glypha (1977) are directly based upon it.|$|E
