5|$|Cory {{served as}} the film's main director, as he had more {{experience}} with animation, comedy, and children's entertainment, while Todd served as co-director. Montgomery and Stutzman were joined by Disney animation veteran David Lovegren as producers on the film, and Cory's and Todd's sister Katie Hooten joined as an associate producer. Tony Leech, {{who had worked with}} the Edwards brothers on Chillicothe, was initially hired as an editor, but gained story input as well. He eventually proved to be so valuable to the <b>production</b> <b>that</b> he was given a role as co-director.|$|E

Carvalho was roundly condemned by the critics for offering a travesty of what {{had come to be}} regarded as a masterpiece of French opera; nevertheless, this version was acclaimed by the public and played to full houses. In October Carvalho yielded to pressure and revised the production; he brought back Galli-Marié, and restored the score and libretto to their 1875 forms.|$|E

The film's cinematographer is credited as Ubaldo Terzano, but Bava shot several scenes himself without credit.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{analysts believe}} that the Italian {{campaign}} failed because Mussolini and his generals initially allocated insufficient resources to the campaign (an expeditionary force of 55,000 men), failed to reckon with the autumn weather, attacked without the advantage of surprise and without Bulgarian support.

Mussolini had not considered the warnings of the Italian Commission of War <b>Production,</b> <b>that</b> Italy {{would not be able}} to sustain a full year of continuous warfare until 1949.|$|E

5|$|Related {{work on a}} {{supersonic}} aircraft, the Hawker Siddeley P.1154, was cancelled in 1965.

The Harrier served with the UK and several nations, often as a carrier-based aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Thank Me Later has a languorous, ambient <b>production</b> <b>that</b> {{incorporates}} moody synthesizers, sparse beats, obscured keyboards, minor keys, {{and subtle}} arrangements.

Drake's emotionally transparent, self-deprecating lyrics are delivered in both rapped and subtly sung verses, and explore feelings of doubt, insecurity, and heartbreak.|$|E

5|$|All main-sequence {{stars have}} a core region where energy is {{generated}} by nuclear fusion. The temperature and density of this core are at the levels necessary to sustain the energy <b>production</b> <b>that</b> will support {{the remainder of the}} star. A reduction of energy production would cause the overlaying mass to compress the core, resulting in an increase in the fusion rate because of higher temperature and pressure. Likewise an increase in energy production would cause the star to expand, lowering the pressure at the core. Thus the star forms a self-regulating system in hydrostatic equilibrium that is stable over the course of its main sequence lifetime.|$|E
5|$|By mid 1954 {{the author}} Ian Fleming had {{published}} two novels—Casino Royale (1953) and Live and Let Die (1954)—and had a third, Moonraker, being edited {{and prepared for}} <b>production.</b> <b>That</b> year he read a story in The Sunday Times about diamond smuggling from Sierra Leone. He considered this story as the possible basis for a new novel and, through an old school friend, he engineered a meeting with Sir Percy Sillitoe, the ex-head of MI5, then working in a security capacity for the diamond-trading company De Beers. The material Fleming gathered was used in both Diamonds Are Forever and The Diamond Smugglers, a non-fiction book published in 1957.|$|E

5|$|Cold Feet is a British {{television}} pilot {{directed by}} Declan Lowney. It stars James Nesbitt and Helen Baxendale as Adam and Rachel, {{a couple who}} meet and fall in love, only for the relationship to break down when he gets cold feet. John Thomson, Fay Ripley, Hermione Norris and Robert Bathurst appear in supporting roles. The programme was written by Mike Bullen, a BBC radio producer with little screenwriting experience, who was tasked with creating a one-off television <b>production</b> <b>that</b> would appeal to middle-class television audiences, who the executive producer Andy Harries believed were underepresented on British television.|$|E
5|$|During early {{childhood}} androgen synthesis and secretion remain low, but {{several years before}} puberty (from 6–8 years of age) changes occur in both anatomical and functional aspects of cortical androgen <b>production</b> <b>that</b> lead to increased secretion of the steroids DHEA and DHEA-S. These changes {{are part of a}} process called adrenarche, which has only been described in humans and some other primates. Adrenarche is independent of ACTH or gonadotropins and correlates with a progressive thickening of the zona reticularis layer of the cortex. Functionally, adrenarche provides a source of androgens for the development of axillary and pubic hair before the beginning of puberty.|$|E
5|$|Fame Kills: Starring Kanye West and Lady Gaga was {{a planned}} co-headlining concert tour by American rapper Kanye West and singer Lady Gaga.

The tour was scheduled to run from November 2009 to January 2010, but was canceled after public controversy regarding West's interruption of Taylor Swift's Best Female Video speech at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards. Shortly after the cancellation, Gaga embarked on her own tour, The Monster Ball Tour, while West took a break from his career.|$|E

5|$|Jailhouse Rock was Presley's third {{film and}} his first for MGM. It was filmed at the MGM studios in Culver City, California. Filmed in black-and-white, the film was the first <b>production</b> <b>that</b> MGM filmed with the {{recently}} developed 35mm anamorphic lens by Panavision. The film was originally titled The Hard Way, which was changed to Jailhouse Kid before MGM finally settled on Jailhouse Rock. It was not listed with the studio's planned releases for the year, which it published in Variety magazine, because {{it was based on}} an original story by Nedrick Young, a blacklisted writer. In addition, the studio traditionally did not produce any original scripts that were not adaptations of already-successful works such as books or theater plays. During the production of the movie, Pandro Berman's attention was centered on another of his productions, the 1958 film The Brothers Karamazov. He let the head of the studio, Benny Thau, and Abe Lastfogel, president of the William Morris Agency, decide the cast. Richard Thorpe, who had the reputation of quickly finishing his projects, was chosen to direct the film.|$|E
5|$|The Garden of Words is short, lasting {{approximately}} 46minutes in length, a trend {{also seen}} among Shinkai's earlier works. Although he had stated {{in an interview}} with Anime News Network that he does like making shorter films, Shinkai noted that he did not originally plan for the film to be played in theaters. Instead, he intended for people to casually view the film on tablets, computers, and in home theaters. A target length was never specified from the outset, instead the relationship between Takao and Yukari was emphasized, although it was known from early in the <b>production</b> <b>that</b> the film would be short.|$|E
5|$|The Hibbs-Murphy team {{proved so}} {{successful}} in To Hell and Back {{that the two}} worked together on {{a total of five}} subsequent films. Hibbs directed Murphy in Ride Clear of Diablo in 1954. The partnership resulted in the commercially unsuccessful non-traditional 1956 western Walk the Proud Land. Hibbs and Murphy teamed with each other for non-westerns Joe Butterfly and World in My Corner. They worked together a final time in the 1958 western Ride a Crooked Trail. Veteran character actor Dan Duryea who portrayed villain Whitey Kincaide in Ride Clear of Diablo played a second lead in two more Murphy vehicles, Night Passage and Six Black Horses. The Story of Charles Russell with Murphy as the lead was under development at Universal but shelved after the disappointing receipts of Walk the Proud Land. Murphy, however, was enthusiastic enough about a biopic of Charles Marion Russell to give serious consideration tor his own <b>production</b> <b>that</b> would star Guy Mitchell in the lead, but no such film was made.|$|E
