50|$|Walras's law is ensured {{if every}} agent's budget {{constraint}} holds with equality. An agent's budget constraint is an equation {{stating that the}} total {{market value of the}} agent's planned expenditures, including saving for future consumption, must be {{less than or equal to}} the total market value of the agent's expected revenue, including sales of financial assets such as bonds or money. When an agent's budget constraint holds with equality, the agent neither plans to acquire goods for free (e.g., by stealing), nor does the agent plan to give away any goods for free. If every agent's budget constraint holds with equality, then the total market value of all agents' planned outlays for all commodities (including saving, which represents future purchases) must equal the total market value of all agents' <b>planned</b> <b>sales</b> of all commodities and assets. It follows that the market value of total value of excess demand in the economy must be zero, which is an the statement of Walras's law. Walras's law implies that if there are n markets and n-1 of these are in equilibrium then the last market must also be in equilibrium, a property which is essential in the proof of the existence of equilibrium.|$|E

40|$|Abstract This paper {{considers}} {{the problem of}} determining the optimal ordering quantity for a perishable product to be sold over a nite sales horizon with a dynamic pricing policy. To date, most models developed to study a dynamic pricing policy for perishable products assume that the salvage value is nonnegative. In this model we allow the salvage value to be either a nonnegative or negative value. We derive {{the conditions under which}} the optimal ordering quantity takes either a zero value or nite value greater than zero. Moreover, we demonstrate the existence of a shortest sales horizon under a condition for which ordering of the product is protable if the seller's <b>planned</b> <b>sales</b> horizon is longer than the shortest sales horizon...|$|E
