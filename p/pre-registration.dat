5|$|The {{first hint}} of its {{existence}} became public when Square Enix trademarked the name in May 2013. The game was first announced in the second September issue of Famitsu Weekly, and was demoed during TGS 2013. Originally scheduled for release {{in the winter of}} 2013, it was delayed due to development problems concerning environment sizes, which needed to be scaled down. It was rescheduled for the first quarter of 2014, then was pushed forward to spring of that year. Street clothes for the characters were offered as a <b>pre-registration</b> bonus, while a code to download outfits inspired by Kurasame, a supporting character from Type-0, were included in the final volume of the spin-off manga Final Fantasy Type-0 Side Story: Reaper of the Icy Blade. <b>Pre-registration</b> closed on May 7, 2013. Chapter delivery began the day after the game's official release on May 14, 2014. The base game was a free download, but players had the option of buying items, restore health and speeding up re-spawn time via microtransactions. The original version also reset individual character experience levels {{at the end of a}} playthrough, while an update in 2015 allowed players to carry over experience levels between playthroughs.|$|E
5|$|The game's {{existence}} was first hinted at when a trademark {{for the title}} was registered. Similar trademarks were registered in Europe and North America. The game was officially announced by Square Enix in an issue of Famitsu magazine in February 2014. The game's service began on March 6, 2014 for iOS. The version for Android released nearly three months later on June 25. A version for the Vita was announced later in 2014, originally scheduled {{for the fourth quarter}} of that year. Due to technical difficulties, the Vita port needed to be delayed well into the following year, and was eventually released on May 14, 2015. <b>Pre-registration</b> was made available from May 10.|$|E

500|$|During its <b>pre-registration</b> period, {{the game}} {{received}} 200,000 registered users. By July 12, {{just over a}} week after release, the game had one million registered players in Japan. This number had expanded to over two million by the following month. Speaking after release, Kitase said that Square Enix considered the game a success as it introduced the mobile community to AAA-style graphics. In Square Enix's 2015 annual report, Mobius was noted {{as one of their}} successful mobile titles for the year, stating that the higher production values when compared to other mobile games on the market had contributed to its popularity.

500|$|A {{trademark}} for {{its original}} title, [...] "Mevius Final Fantasy", was filed by Square Enix in October 2014. The game was officially announced in Famitsu {{two months later}} under the same name. Two days later, a teaser site was opened in both English and Japanese with a message from Kitase about the team's vision for the game. Its final name was announced during a livestream by the company dedicated to the game. Both titles, along with the logo artwork, took inspiration from {{the concept of the}} Möbius strip. Because of its origin, the title was changed from Mevius to Mobius. It was also apparently done in preparation for an international release. <b>Pre-registration</b> for Mobius opened on April 27, 2015, with a special weapon and item available to those who registered. In late 2015, no localization had been officially announced, though Kitase revealed through the Final Fantasy Portal App that it was under consideration. In a later post on the app during first anniversary celebrations for the game, Kitase confirmed that a global version was in development. The global version was released on August 3, 2016 for iOS and Android in English, Traditional Chinese and Korean. It would later be released for Microsoft Windows via Steam (software) in Japan on November 1, 2016 and worldwide on February 6, 2017 in English, Traditional Chinese and Korean. French and German support was added to the global version via iOS, Android and Steam on February 6, 2017.|$|E
500|$|The Glastonbury Festival 2008 {{was held}} on 27, 28 and 29 June, headlined by Kings of Leon, Jay-Z and The Verve on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, respectively, with other notable acts {{including}} Neil Diamond, Shakin' Stevens, The Levellers, and Stackridge, who opened the first festival in 1970. Continuing the procedure introduced in 2007, ticket buyers had to pre-register and submit a passport photo between 1 February and 14 March in order to buy tickets which went on sale at 9am on Sunday 6 April. Following 40,000 tickets not being sold, the <b>pre-registration</b> process was reopened on 8 April. Several reasons have been cited for this, including the poor weather of the previous four years and the controversial choice of featuring the hip hop artist, Jay-Z, as a headlining act. A day before the festival began, Michael Eavis announced that there were still around 3,000 tickets remaining, making it possible {{that it would be}} the first festival in 15 years not to sell out in advance. It had also been announced that any remaining tickets would be sold from major branches of HMV. This year saw the introduction of a new field adjacent to the Sacred space and Park Stage. Not named by the organisers, the festival goers themselves called it [...] "Flagtopia" [...] in reference to the flags located there. After the huge number of tents left behind in 2007 and when one of Michael Eavis's cows died after ingesting a metal tent-peg left in the soil, the Festival devised its Love the Farm, Leave No Trace campaign which gently pushed revellers to respect the environment and clear up after themselves. [...] The Festival had always pushed a green agenda and new initiatives in 2008 included biodegradable tent pegs handed out free to all campers and biotractors running on waste vegetable oil. These new efforts were rewarded with The Greener Festival Award for 2008 alongside a number of other festivals also committed to environmentally friendly music festivals. The 2008 festival was reported to have cost £22million to produce.|$|E

The total length of the race is 330 km (205mi) which must be completed in less than 150 hours. There are 43 refreshment points at which the runners can eat, sleep and, if needed, obtain medical care. There are also 7 life bases, which are bigger than refreshment points. They are placed about every 50 km (31mi). Because of its difficulty, many athletes do not complete the trail. The completion rate is about 60%. Around 1,200 volunteers are used to organize the race. Due {{to the difference between}} the highest point and the lowest point, weather can be an additional obstacle. As they travel, the competitors can encounter sun, rain, wind, and even snow. The number of participants is limited to 700 (660 before) because of the complexity of managing people over the 330 km trek. For the 2015 edition there have been 2291 <b>pre-registrations.</b> For 2016 it will be conducted under ITRA regulations, the governing body for trail races in the Mont Blanc and Alpine region.|$|R

The posts {{did not have to be}} in general medicine: some teaching hospitals had very specialised posts at this level, so it was possible for a new graduate to do neurology plus neurosurgery or orthopaedics plus rheumatology, for one year before having to go onto more broadly based work. The <b>pre-registration</b> posts were nominally supervised by the General Medical Council, which in practice delegated the task to the medical schools, who left it to the consultant medical staff.
