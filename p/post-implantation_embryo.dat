50|$|Mammalian PGCs are {{specified}} by signalling between cells (induction), {{rather than by}} the segregation of germ plasm as the embryo divides. In mice, PGCs originate from the proximal epiblast, close to the extra-embryonic ectoderm (ExE), of the <b>post-implantation</b> <b>embryo</b> as early as embryonic day 6.5. By E7.5 a founding population of approximately 40 PGCs are generated in this region of the epiblast in the developing mouse embryo. The epiblast, however, also give rise to somatic cell lineages that make up the embryo proper; including the endoderm, ectoderm and mesoderm. The specification of primordial germ cells in mammals is mainly attributed to the downstream functions of two signaling pathways; the BMP signaling pathway and the canonical WNT/β-catenin pathway.|$|E

An increase in uPA activity was observed in mouse <b>post-implantation</b> <b>embryos</b> during the early organogenesis period. Since we have previously shown that all-trans retinoic acid (RA) prevented the induction of uPA in mouse peritoneal macrophages, we have now assessed whether teratogenic doses of this agent could also interfere with uPA activity in mouse embryo in vitro and in vivo. <b>Post-implantation</b> <b>embryos</b> (8. 5 days) were incubated for up to 24 hr with micromolar concentration of RA resulting in the occurrence of malformations. No significant difference in uPA activity was found between control and treated embryos. Likewise, uPA activity was not altered in embryos explanted on day 9. 5 from dams treated 24 hr before with a teratogenic dose of RA. This study indicates that the teratogenic activity of RA is not caused by an inhibition of the induction of uPA in embryos...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that the vav protooncogene {{plays an important role in}} hematopoiesis. To study this further, we have ablated the vav protooncogene by homologous recombination in embryonic stem (ES) cells. Homozygous vav (-/-) ES clones differentiate normally in culture and generate cells of erythroid, myeloid and mast cell lineages. Mice heterozygous for the targeted vav allele do not display any obvious abnormalities. However, homozygous embryos die very early during development. Crosses of vav (+/-) heterozygous mice yield apparently normal vav (-/-) E 3. 5 <b>embryos</b> but not <b>post-implantation</b> <b>embryos</b> (> or = E 7. 5). Furthermore, homozygous vav (-/-) blastocysts do not hatch in vitro. These results indicate that vav is essential for an early developmental step(s) that precedes the onset of hematopoiesis. Consistent with the phenotypic analysis of vav (-/-) embryos, we have identified Vav immunoreactivity in the extra-embryonic trophoblastic cell layer but not in the inner embryonic cell mass of E 3. 5 preimplantation embryos or in the egg cylinder of E 6. 5 and E 7. 5 <b>post-implantation</b> <b>embryos.</b> These results suggest that the vav gene is essential for normal trophoblast development and for implantation of the developing embryo...|$|R
40|$|AbstractGross {{alterations}} in cell energy metabolism underlie manifestations of hereditary OXPHOS (oxidative phosphorylation) diseases, {{many of which}} depend on proportion of mutant mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in tissues. An animal model of OXPHOS disease with maternal inheritance of mitochondrial heteroplasmy might help understanding the peculiarities of abnormal mtDNA distribution {{and its effect on}} pre- and postnatal development. Previously we obtained mice that carry human mtDNA in some tissues. It co-existed with murine mtDNA (heteroplasmy) and was transmitted maternally to the progeny of animals developed from zygotes injected with human mitochondria. To analyze the probability of obtaining heteroplasmic mice we increased the number of experiments with early embryos and obtained more specimens from F 1. About 33 % of zygotes injected with human mtDNA developed into <b>post-implantation</b> <b>embryos</b> (7 th– 13 th days). Lower amount of such developed into neonate mice (ca. 21 %). Among <b>post-implantation</b> <b>embryos</b> and in generations F 0 and F 1 percentages of human mtDNA-carriers were ca. 14 – 16 %. Such percentages are sufficient for modeling maternally inherited heteroplasmy in small animal groups.

40|$|Polyamines are key {{regulators}} in cell {{growth and}} differentiation. It {{has been shown}} that ornithine decarboxylase (Odc) was essential for <b>post-implantation</b> <b>embryo</b> development, and overexpression of spermidine/spermine N 1 -acetyltransferase will lead to ovarian hypofunction and hypoplastic uteri. However, the expression and function of polyamine-related genes in mouse uterus during early pregnancy are still unknown. In this study we investigated the expression, regulation, and function of polyamine-related genes in mouse uterus during the peri-implantation period. Odc expression was strongly detected at implantation sites and stimulated by estrogen treatment. The expression of Odc antizyme 1 and spermidine/spermine N 1 -acetyltransferase was also highly shown at implantation sites and regulated by Odc or polyamine level in uterine cells. Embryo implantation was significantly inhibited by alpha-difluoromethylornithine, an Odc inhibitor. Moreover, the reduction of Odc activity caused by alpha-difluoromethylornithine treatment was compensated by the up-regulation of S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase gene expression.

Several previous studies showed that rhein can inhibit cell proliferation and trigger mitochondria-related or endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-dependent apoptotic processes. However, {{the side effects of}} rhein on pre- and post-implantation embryonic development remain unclear. Here, we show that rhein has cytotoxic effects on blastocyst-stage mouse embryos and induces oxidative stress and immunotoxicity in mouse fetuses. Blastocysts incubated with 5 – 20 μM rhein showed significant cell apoptosis, as well as decreases in their inner cell mass cell numbers and total cell numbers. An in vitro development assay showed that rhein affected the developmental potentials of both pre- and <b>post-implantation</b> <b>embryos.</b> Incubation of blastocysts with 5 – 20 μM rhein was associated with increased resorption of <b>post-implantation</b> <b>embryos</b> and decreased fetal weight in an embryo transfer assay. Importantly, in an in vivo model, intravenous injection of dams with rhein (1, 3, and 5 mg/kg body weight/day) for four days resulted in apoptosis of blastocyst-stage embryos, early embryonic developmental injury, and decreased fetal weight. Intravenous injection of dams with 5 mg/kg body weight/day rhein significantly increased the total reactive oxygen species (ROS) content of fetuses and the transcription levels of antioxidant proteins in fetal livers. Additional work showed that rhein induced apoptosis through ROS generation, and that prevention of apoptotic processes effectively rescued the rhein-induced injury effects on embryonic development. Finally, the transcription levels of the innate-immunity related genes, CXCL 1, IL- 1 β and IL- 8, were down-regulated in the fetuses of dams that received intravenous injections of rhein. These results collectively show that rhein has the potential to induce embryonic cytotoxicity and induce oxidative stress and immunotoxicity during the development of mouse embryos...|$|R

40|$|A {{study to}} {{evaluate}} the effects of nicotine and simultaneous supplementation of y-tocotrienol (y-TCT), {{one of the four}} isomers in tocotrienols (TCT), and nicotine, on in vitro and in vivo embryonic development in mice (Mus musculus) had been carried out. Several approaches were undertaken including an investigation on in vitro effects of various doses and durations of nicotine treatment on pre-implantation embryonic development. Results showed that nicotine treatment decreased the number of retrieved embryos, resulted embryo degeneration, delayed embryo cleavage, induced disproportionate size of blastomeres and degraded blastomeres (p< 0. 05). Moreover, the deleterious impact of nicotine on pre-implantation embryonic development was dose- and treatment duration-dependent with a corresponding increase in plasma malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations (p< 0. 05). Based on this finding, the study was further elucidated in terms of examining the dose-related beneficial effects of y-TCT in nicotine-induced cessation of pre-implantation embryonic development in vitro. Results showed that y-TCT could prevent the duration- and dose-related deterioration of pre-implantation embryo quality when supplemented simultaneously with nicotine. Moreover, y-TCT of 60 mg/kg bw/day was found to be the optimal effective dose in lowering plasma levels of MDA during pre-implantation embryo development (p< 0. 05). Findings of in vitro study were applied in in vivo approach {{to evaluate the}} effect of simultaneous supplementation of y-TCT with nicotine on embryo development, blastocyst implantation, foetal growth, length of gestation, foetal outcome and survival rate of the neonates. Results showed that nicotine impaired <b>post-implantation</b> <b>embryo</b> growth and development (p< 0. 05). Pregnancy outcome and survival of the neonates were also reduced (p< 0. 05). The rise in oxidant levels reduced the enzymatic antioxidant defense system (p< 0. 05). < Pregnancy-related levels of progesterone (P₄) and oestrogen (E₂) were also significantly affected (p< 0. 05). Through combating nicotine-induced oxidative stress, y-TCT was able to sustain the physiological/normal sequence of blastocyst implantation, foetal growth, pregnancy outcome and survival of the neonates. Moreover, maintenance of pregnancy until term possibly resulted from sustaining the levels of plasma P₄ and E₂ as evident in normal pregnancy. In conclusion, y-TCT could be used to minimize nicotine-induced oxidative stress-related deterioration of pre- and <b>post-implantation</b> <b>embryo</b> development, intrauterine foetal growth, pregnancy outcome and survival of the neonates...|$|E
40|$|A {{large number}} of studies have {{analyzed}} the putative functions of the prion protein (PrPC) in mammals. Although its sequence conservation over a wide range of different animals may indicate that this protein could have a key role in prion diseases, an absolutely accepted involvement has not been found so far. We have recently reported that PrPC regulates Nanog mRNA expression, the first non-redundant function of PrPC in embryonic stem cells (ESC), which translates into control of pluripotency and early differentiation. Contrary to what is believed, the other two members of the prion protein family, Doppel and Shadoo, cannot replace the absence of PrPC, causing the appearance of a new embryoid body (EB) population in our in vitro culture. The similarities between EB and an early <b>post-implantation</b> <b>embryo</b> suggest that this might also occur in vivo, enhancing the importance of this finding. On the other hand, our data may support the hypothesis of a relationship between the loss of PrPC function and neuronal degeneration in prion diseases.

40|$|Implantation S 1 family serine proteinases (ISPs) are tryptases {{involved}} in embryo hatching and uterine implantation in the mouse. The two different ISP proteins (ISP 1 and ISP 2) {{have been detected}} in both pre- and <b>post-implantation</b> <b>embryo</b> tissue. To date, native ISP obtained from uterus and blastocyst tissues has been isolated only as an active hetero-dimer that exhibits trypsin-like substrate specificity. We hypothesised that in isolation, ISP 1 might have a unique substrate specificity that could relate to its role when expressed alone in individual tissues. Thus, we isolated recombinant ISP 1 expressed in Pichia pastoris and evaluated its substrate specificity. Using several chromogenic substrates and serine proteinase inhibitors, we demonstrate that ISP 1 exhibits trypsin-like substrate specificity, having a preference for lysine over arginine at the P 1 position. Phage display peptide mimetics revealed an expanded but mixed substrate specificity of ISP 1, including chymotryptic and elastase activity. Based upon targets observed using phage display, we hypothesised that ISP 1 might signal to cells by cleaving and activating proteinase-activated receptors (PARs) and therefore assessed PARs 1, 2 and 4 as potential ISP 1 targets.

40|$|The {{application}} of {{human embryonic stem}} (ES) cells in medicine and biology has an inherent reliance on understanding the starting cell population. Human ES cells differ from mouse ES cells and the specific embryonic origin of both cell types is unclear.

Here we show that cell lines can be derived from the epiblast, a tissue of the <b>post-implantation</b> <b>embryo</b> that generates the embryo proper. These cells, which we refer to as EpiSCs (post-implantation epiblast-derived stem cells), express transcription factors known to regulate pluripotency, maintain their genomic integrity, and robustly differentiate into the major somatic cell types as well as primordial germ cells. The EpiSC lines are distinct from mouse ES cells in their epigenetic state and the signals controlling their differentiation.

Half of the ULO gilts were fed at 1. 2 maintenance requirement (M), while the other half were fed at 2. 4 M. Across ULO gilts 0. 8 more embryos survived in the ipsilateral horn compared with the contralateral horn at Day 35 of gestation (P < 0. 05). In ULO gilts on the 2. 4 M feed level the difference (+ 1. 3; P < 0. 05) between the ipsi- and contralateral horn was more pronounced than on the 1. 2 M feed level (+ 0. 4; NS). The higher feed level reduced circulating levels of systemic progesterone on Day 5 of pregnancy but not embryo survival at Day 35.

40|$|Abstract__ Mammalian {{development}} {{starts from}} a fertilized egg that initially generates few pluripotent cells which eventually {{give rise to}} the embryo proper. Different ‘flavors’ of pluripotency have been captured in vitro {{which led to the}} establishment of different pluripotent cell lines. Mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) are derived from the preimplantation embryo and have three defining properties: self-renewal, pluripotency, and contribution to chimera formation. By applying specific culture conditions or ectopic expression of the pluripotency factors, similar pluripotent cells can be derived from germ cells or differentiated cells referred to as embryonic germ (EG) and induced pluripotent cells (iPSCs), respectively. When established from <b>post-implantation</b> <b>embryo,</b> the cultured cells are termed epi stem cells (EpiSCs). EpiSCs have limited potential for chimerism and germ line transmission and require different culture conditions when compared to ESCs. Hence, mouse ESCs and EpiSCs represent two different phases of pluripotency usually referred to as the naïve and primed states. By employing genetic manipulation or specific culture conditions, the different pluripotent cells can be interconverted which leads to several intermediate states. Unlike their murine counterparts, human ESCs closely resemble the rodent primed EpiSCs and respond to similar signaling pathways. Tumorigenic transformation of primordial germ cells (PGC) and gonocytes can also give rise to pluripotent cells known as embryonal carcinoma cells (hECs), thought to represent the malignant counterpart of hESCs. Among different signaling pathways, Wnt signaling plays a central role in self-renewal and differentiation of pluripotent cells...|$|E
40|$|The {{mitochondrion}} {{is explicitly}} involved in cytoplasmic regulation {{and is the}} cell's major generator of ATP. Our aim {{was to determine whether}} mitochondria alone could influence fertilisation outcome. In vitro, oocyte competence can be assessed through the presence of glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase (G 6 PD) as indicated by the dye, brilliant cresyl blue (BCB). Using porcine in vitro fertilisation (IVF), we have assessed oocyte maturation, cytoplasmic volume, fertilisation outcome, mitochondrial number as determined by mtDNA copy number, and whether mitochondria are uniformly distributed between blastomeres of each embryo. After staining with BCB, we observed a significant difference in cytoplasmic volume between BCB positive (BCB+) and BCB negative (BCB-) oocytes. There was also a significant difference in mtDNA copy number between fertilised and unfertilised oocytes and unequal mitochondrial segregation between blastomeres during early cleavage stages. Furthermore, we have supplemented BCB- oocytes with mitochondria from maternal relatives and observed a significant difference in fertilisation outcomes following both IVF and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) between supplemented, sham-injected and non-treated BCB- oocytes. We have therefore demonstrated a relationship between oocyte maturity, cytoplasmic volume, and fertilisation outcome and mitochondrial content. These data suggest that mitochondrial number is important for fertilisation outcome and embryonic development. Furthermore, a mitochondrial pre-fertilisation threshold may ensure that, as mitochondria are diluted out during post-fertilisation cleavage, there are sufficient copies of mtDNA per blastomere to allow transmission of mtDNA to each cell of the <b>post-implantation</b> <b>embryo</b> after the initiation of mtDNA replication during the early postimplantation stages...|$|E

40|$|Introduction. Aberrant placentation occurs early during {{embryonic}} development after assisted reproductive techniques. To further {{understand this}} failure, vascular morphometry of ovine placentas and embryo growth after in vitro activation (IVA) and {{in vitro fertilization}} (IVF) at 20 and 22 days of gestation was performed. Results. Crown-ramp measure (mm) after in vitro manipulation is reduced at 20 (CTR-controls: 3. 84; IVF: 3. 48; IVA: 3. 46) and 22 days (CTR: 4. 42; IVF: 3. 84; IVA: 3. 74), as well as placental vessel number/field (20 - 22 days: IVF: 1. 25 - 1. 93; IVA: 1. 24 - 1. 71; CTR: 3. 11 - 3. 48). At 20 d, stage 1 vessels (early vasculogenesis) were prevalent in IVA samples (IVA: 26. 67 % of total vessels; IVF: 10. 55 %; CTR: 3. 54 %), stage 2 (early tube formation) in IVF (IVF: 77. 82 %; CTR: 70. 31 %; IVA: 66. 33 %) and stage 3 (late vasculogenesis) in CTR (CTR: 26. 15 %; IVF: 11. 63 %; IVA: 10 %). At 22 d, more vessels in stages 1 (18. 18 %) and 2 (72. 72 %) occur after IVA than IVF (1 : 5. 24 %; 2 : 64. 51 %) and CTR (1 : 2. 62 %; 2 : 53. 59 %), while CTR had more stage 3 vessels (43. 79 %) than IVF (30. 25 %) and IVA (9. 1 %). Discussion. In vitro manipulation leads to delayed maturation and reduced density of placental vessels, that affect <b>post-implantation</b> <b>embryo</b> growth. [ [...] . ...|$|E
40|$|Oocyte {{quality is}} a key {{limiting}} factor in female fertility, yet we have a poor understanding of what constitutes oocyte quality or the mechanisms governing it. The ovarian follicular microenvironment and maternal signals, mediated pri-marily through granulosa cells (GCs) and cumulus cells (CCs), are responsible for nurturing oocyte growth, develop-ment and the gradual acquisition of oocyte developmental competence. However, oocyte–GC/CC communication is bidirectional with the oocyte secreting potent growth factors that act locally to direct the differentiation and function of CCs. Two important oocyte-secreted factors (OSFs) are growth-differentiation factor 9 and bone morphogenetic protein 15, which activate signaling pathways in CCs to regulate key genes and cellular processes required for CC differentiation and for CCs to maintain their distinctive phenotype. Hence, oocytes appear to tightly control their neighboring somatic cells, directing them to perform functions required for appropriate development of the oocyte. This oocyte–CC regulatory loop and the capacity of oocytes to regulate their own microenvironment by OSFs may constitute important components of oocyte quality. In support of this notion, it has recently been demonstrated that supplementing oocyte in vitro maturation (IVM) media with exogenous OSFs improves oocyte developmental potential, as evidenced by enhanced pre- and <b>post-implantation</b> <b>embryo</b> development. This new perspective on oocyte–CC interactions is improving {{our knowledge of the}} processes regulating oocyte quality, which is likely to have a number of applications, including improving the efficiency of clinical IVM and thereby providing new options for the treatment of infertility.

40|$|The {{mycotoxin}} citrinin (CTN), {{a natural}} contaminant in foodstuffs and animal feeds, exerts cytotoxic and genotoxic effects on various mammalian cells and embryos. A previous investigation by our group revealed potentially hazardous effects of CTN on mouse oocyte maturation and pre- and <b>post-implantation</b> <b>embryo</b> development via the induction of apoptosis. The present {{study showed that}} CTN induces apoptosis and inhibits cell proliferation in the inner cell mass of mouse blastocysts. Notably, we observed {{for the first time}} that both these effects are suppressed by liquiritigenin (LQ). LQ is a type of flavonoid isolated from Glycyrrhiza radix with several biochemical and pharmacological activities, including antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. The preincubation of blastocysts with LQ clearly prevented CTN-induced disruption of pre- and post-implantation embryonic development and fetal weight loss, both in vitro and in vivo. CTN-induced damage processes directly promoted reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and activation of caspase- 9 and caspase- 3, which were effectively blocked by LQ. Moreover, in an animal model, intravenous injection of dams with CTN (3 mg/kg/day) triggered apoptosis of blastocysts, disruption of embryonic development from the zygote to the blastocyst stage and a decrease in fetal weight. Pre-injection with LQ (5 mg/kg/day) effectively reduced apoptosis and impaired the cytotoxic effects of CTN on development. Our in vivo findings further confirm that CTN exposure via injection has the potential to impair pre- and post-implantation development, leading to apoptosis and the suppression of sequent embryonic development, which can be effectively prevented by LQ...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} the molecular cloning of two novel human and murine transcription factors containing the TEA/ATTS DNA binding domain {{and related to}} transcriptional enhancer factor- 1 (TEF- 1). These factors bind to the consensus TEA/ATTS cognate binding site exemplified by the GT-IIC and Sph enhansons of the SV 40 enhancer but differ {{in their ability to}} bind cooperatively to tandemly repeated sites. The human TEFs are differentially expressed in cultured cell lines and the mouse (m) TEFs are differentially expressed in embryonic and extra-embryonic tissues in early <b>post-implantation</b> <b>embryos.</b> Strikingly, at later stages of embryogenesis, mTEF- 3 is specifically expressed in skeletal muscle precursors, whereas mTEF- 1 is expressed not only in developing skeletal muscle but also in the myocardium. Together with previous data, these results point to important, partially redundant, roles for these TEF proteins in myogenesis and cardiogenesis. In addition, mTEF- 1 is strongly coexpressed with mTEF- 4 in mitotic neuroblasts, while accentuated mTEF- 4 expression is also observed in the gut and the nephrogenic region of the kidney. These observations suggest additional roles for the TEF proteins in central nervous system development and organogenesis. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this review}} is to {{summarize}} the information currently available regarding the occurrence of apoptosis in the developing embryo and in the receptive uterus during the peri-implantation period of gestation. Cell death is detected in the inner cell mass of late pre-implantation embryos {{as the result of}} an eliminative process that helps trim the embryonic cell lineages of surplus or dysfunctional stem cells. Cell death is also detected in the epiblastic core of early <b>post-implantation</b> <b>embryos,</b> where the process is implicated {{in the formation of the}} pro-amniotic cavity. On the maternal side, uterine epithelial cells situated around the attachment site undergo cell death during the initial phase of implantation in order to facilitate embryo anchorage and access to maternal blood supply. Uterine stromal cells closest to the implantation chamber first transform into decidual cells and then commit suicide to make room for the rapidly growing embryo. Although apoptosis is well recognized as a crucial determinant of successful peri-implantation development, our understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms regulating this process clearly lags behind the comprehension of cell death control in other systems...|$|R
40|$|The {{foundations}} of mammalian development {{lie in a}} cluster of embryonic epiblast stem cells. In response to extracellular matrix signalling, these cells undergo epithelialization and create an apical surface in contact with a cavity, a fundamental event for all subsequent development. Concomitantly, epiblast cells transit through distinct pluripotent states, before lineage commitment at gastrulation. These pluripotent states have been characterized at the molecular level, but their biological importance remains unclear. Here we show that exit from an unrestricted naive pluripotent state is required for epiblast epithelialization and generation of the pro-amniotic cavity in mouse embryos. Embryonic stem cells locked in the naive state are able to initiate polarization but fail to undergo lumenogenesis. Mechanistically, exit from naive pluripotency activates an Oct 4 -governed transcriptional program that results in expression of glycosylated sialomucin proteins and the vesicle tethering and fusion events of lumenogenesis. Similarly, exit of epiblasts from naive pluripotency in cultured human <b>post-implantation</b> <b>embryos</b> triggers amniotic cavity formation and developmental progression. Our results add tissue-level architecture as a new criterion for the characterization of different pluripotent states, and show the relevance of transitions between these states during development of the mammalian embryo. status: accepte...|$|R
