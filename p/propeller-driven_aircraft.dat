5|$|In late January 1951, the Air Force told Davis {{it wanted}} to rotate {{him back to the}} United States. By this point, Davis held every record for a jet pilot, {{including}} most victories in all types of aircraft, most MiGs destroyed and most victories over <b>propeller-driven</b> <b>aircraft.</b> Other pilots indicated they wanted him to stay in Korea, considering him to be an able and effective leader. However, the Air Force determined it had no capable replacement who could command Davis' squadron.|$|E

25|$|During World War II the US Army Air Force (USAAF) {{concluded}} that existing anti-aircraft guns, only marginally effective against existing generations of <b>propeller-driven</b> <b>aircraft,</b> {{would not be}} effective at all against the emerging jet-powered designs. Like the Germans and British before them, they concluded the only successful defence would be to use guided weapons.|$|E
25|$|Two Piper PA-48 Enforcers {{were tested}} during 1983 and 1984 at Eglin AFB, and Edwards AFB, California. As in the Pave COIN tests of 1971, the PA-48s {{were found to}} perform well in their {{intended}} role for counter-insurgency, but the USAF again decided not to purchase the aircraft being apparently uninterested in adding tail-dragger <b>propeller-driven</b> <b>aircraft</b> to the inventory.|$|E

25|$|In March 1957, Feightner was {{assigned}} as {{officer in charge}} of the Jet Transitional Training Unit (JTTU) at Naval Air Station Olathe in Gardner, Kansas. Established on April 4, 1955, the mission of the JTTU was to train pilots of <b>propeller-driven</b> <b>aircraft</b> to operate jets and to provide refresher training for aviators transferring from shore to sea duty.|$|E
25|$|As {{the first}} of a new {{generation}} of passenger jets, Boeing wanted the aircraft's model number to emphasize the difference from its previous <b>propeller-driven</b> <b>aircraft</b> which bore 300-series numbers. The 400-, 500- and 600-series were already used by missiles and other products, so Boeing decided that the jets would bear 700-series numbers, and the first would be the 707.|$|E
25|$|Boeing was {{experienced}} at selling {{to the military}} but had not enjoyed the same success with civil airliners. This market was dominated by Douglas which was adept at {{meeting the needs of}} airlines by refining and developing its range of <b>propeller-driven</b> <b>aircraft,</b> and in 1950 was marketing the forthcoming DC-7. Boeing decided the only way to overcome the airlines' suspicion of the jet – and of itself – was to show them a completed aircraft.|$|E

25|$|Originally the Air National Guard was {{designed}} as a combat reserve force. After World War II, its flying units consisted of 72 fighter and 12 light bomber squadrons equipped with obsolescent World War II <b>propeller-driven</b> <b>aircraft</b> while the active duty Air Force transitioned to jet fighters. Although it had no airlift or tanker units, the Air National Guard's flying units were equipped with a small number of liaison, trainer, and transport planes, and the Air National Guard actively sought out new missions and aircraft.|$|E
25|$|The Nimrod was {{the first}} jet-powered {{maritime}} patrol aircraft (MPA) to enter service, being powered by the Rolls-Royce Spey turbofan engine. Aircraft in this role had been commonly propelled by piston or turboprop powerplants instead to maximise fuel economy and enable maximum patrol time on station; advantages of the Nimrod's turbofan engines included greater speed and altitude capabilities, it was also more capable of evading detection methods by submarines, whereas <b>propeller-driven</b> <b>aircraft</b> are more detectable underwater to standard acoustic sensors. Inflight, the Nimrods had a flight endurance of ten hours without aerial refuelling; the MR2s were later fitted to receive mid-air refuelling in response to demands in the Falklands War.|$|E
25|$|The Hawker Tempest is a British fighter {{aircraft}} primarily {{used by the}} Royal Air Force (RAF) in the Second World War. The Tempest, originally {{known as}} the Typhoon II, was an improved derivative of the Hawker Typhoon, intended to address the Typhoon's unexpected fall-off of performance at high altitude by replacing its wing with a thinner laminar flow design. Having diverged considerably from the Typhoon, it was chosen to rename the aircraft Tempest. The Tempest {{emerged as one of}} the most powerful fighters of World War II and was the fastest single-engine <b>propeller-driven</b> <b>aircraft</b> of the war at low altitude. The propeller-driven Dornier 335 was even faster, but it had two engines.|$|E
50|$|Technology soon {{made this}} mission obsolete, as the {{development}} of the Lockheed U-2 made the need for more vulnerable <b>propeller-driven</b> reconnaissance <b>aircraft</b> obsolete. No longer needed for a long-range, strategic reconnaissance mission, the 91st was inactivated on 1 July 1957.|$|R
50|$|By early 1966, {{a rising}} level of {{communist}} anti-aircraft fire against <b>propeller-driven</b> FAC <b>aircraft</b> necessitated {{the use of}} jet aircraft for FACs in high-risk areas in North Vietnam.

25|$|On 1 September 1955, an Israeli Meteor {{shot down}} an Egyptian de Havilland Vampire, the first jet {{aircraft}} {{to be shot}} down in the theatre. The Meteor {{played a key role}} during the Suez Crisis; on 28 October 1956, an Israeli NF.13 took part in Operation Tarnegol, in which it successfully located and shot down an Egyptian Ilyushin Il-14 that had been carrying several high-ranking Egyptian Military officers {{on the eve of the}} crisis. The operation had intended to shoot down the Il-14 that was supposed to be carrying the supreme commander of the Egyptian armed forces, Abdel Hakim Amer, however a different aircraft had been inadvertently attacked and destroyed instead. After deploying paratroopers east of the Suez Canal, the Israeli Air Force continued to support them on the ground predominantly using its jet aircraft, fearing its <b>propeller-driven</b> <b>aircraft</b> would be vulnerable against Egypt's own jet fighters.|$|E
25|$|As a result, piston-engined fighters, {{such as the}} F8F Bearcat, an {{aircraft}} from the Grumman stable {{with one of the}} most powerful piston engines ever developed for a single-engined aircraft, the Pratt & Whitney P R-2800 radial engine, would be used to combat the insurgents. With this powerful engine (2100hp), the Bearcat was probably the fastest <b>propeller-driven</b> <b>aircraft</b> with a maximum speed of over 450mph. (The Americans would follow their lead in their war against the Viet Minh by using the Douglas A-1 Skyraider piston-engined aircraft during the 1960s.) For the task of dropping large “hardware” on guerrilla groups, the twin-engined bomber Douglas B-26 Invader would also be chosen. A revised command structure for the Armée de l’Air in Indochina was also put in effect with the creation of three Groupes aériens tacticques (Gatac) (“Aerial Tactical Groups”): Gatac North in Hanoi, Gatac Center in Hué and Gatac South in Saigon/Tan Son Nhut.|$|E
500|$|Handicapped air {{racing is}} open to any <b>propeller-driven</b> <b>aircraft</b> capable of {{maintaining}} a minimum speed of [...] per hour in level flight. Races are a case of [...] "fly low, fly fast, turn left", consisting of 4–5 laps round a 20–25mile (32–40km) circuit. Faster aircraft are handicapped by starting after slower aircraft, the intention being that the race concludes with all aircraft diving for the finish line together. There are up to 16 races per year, conducted at airfields in the UK, France and the Channel Islands, for prizes that include the Schneider Trophy and King's Cup, and the season culminates with the British Air Racing and European Air Racing Championships.|$|E

500|$|On 5 February 1952, a Spitfire 19 of 81 Squadron {{based at}} Kai Tak in Hong Kong reached {{probably}} the highest altitude ever achieved by a Spitfire.

He climbed to [...] indicated altitude, with a true altitude of [...] The cabin pressure fell below a safe level and, in trying to reduce altitude, he entered an uncontrollable dive which shook the aircraft violently. He eventually regained control somewhere below [...] and landed safely with no discernible damage to his aircraft. Evaluation of the recorded flight data suggested that, in the dive, he achieved a speed of , (Mach0.96), which would have been the highest speed ever reached by a <b>propeller-driven</b> <b>aircraft,</b> but it has been speculated this figure resulted from inherent instrument errors.|$|E
