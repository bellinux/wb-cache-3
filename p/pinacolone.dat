40|$|The {{standard}} {{picture is}} that clathrate hydrates form when hydrophobic guest molecules are compressed with water under high pressure-low temperature conditions. In the ice-like hydrate framework, water molecules form molecule-sized cavities that encapsulate the guests and minimize water-hydrophobic guest interactions.
