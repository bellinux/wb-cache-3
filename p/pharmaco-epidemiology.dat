40|$|International audienceIn <b>pharmaco-epidemiology,</b> the use {{of drugs}} is the {{determinant}} of interest when studying exposure-outcome associations. The increased availability of computerized information about drug use on an individual basis has greatly facilitated analyses of drug effects on a population-based scale. It seems likely that many negative findings {{in the early days of}} <b>pharmaco-epidemiology</b> can be explained by non-differential misclassification because of too simple (yes/no) exposure measures. In this paper, the authors discuss the importance of an adequate definition of drug exposure in pharmaco-epidemiological research and how this time-varying determinant can be analyzed in cohort studies. To reduce the risk of non-differential misclassification, a precise definition of exposure is mandatory and it is important to distinguish the complete follow-up period of a population into mutually exclusive episodes of non-use, past use and current use for each individual. By analyzing exposure to drugs as a time-dependent variable in a Cox regression model, cohort studies with complete coverage of all filled prescriptions can provide us with valid and precise risk estimates of drug-outcome associations. However, such estimates may be biased in the presence of time-dependent confounders which are themselves affected by prior exposure...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{case series}} method was {{developed}} by Farrington (1995) to investigate the strength of association between a time-varying exposure and an acute rare potentially recurrent event, using cases only. It can be used when the exposure can only be causally related to the event during a limited period of time. It has been widely used in <b>pharmaco-epidemiology,</b> particularly {{in the study of}} vaccine safety. The method is derived from a Poisson model by conditioning on the individual total number of events and its exposure history. As a consequence of this conditioning, the effects of fixed covariates cancel out, so that the method has a particular advantage as compared with cohort and case-control studies...|$|E

40|$|International audienceBackground:New {{approaches}} of <b>pharmaco-epidemiology</b> consist in using large EHR databases {{to investigate the}} effects and uses (or misuses) of drugs in real conditions. The objective is to benefit from nationwide available data to answer accurately and {{in a short time}} pharmaco-epidemiological queries for national public health institutions. Despite the potential availability of the data, their size and complexity make their analysis long and tremendous. The challenge we tackle is the conception of a generic digital toolbox to support the efficient design of a broad range of <b>pharmaco-epidemiology</b> studies from EHR databases. Methods:To be able to answer the broad range of pharmaco-epidemiological queries from national public health institutions, the PEPS platform exploits, in secondary use, the French health cross-schemes insurance system, called SNIIRAM. The SNIIRAM covers most of the French population with a sliding period of 3 past years. To tackle the volume and the diversity of the SNIIRAM data warehouse, a research program has been established to design an innovative toolbox. This research program is focused first on the modeling of care pathways from the SNIIRAM database and, second, on the design of tools supporting meaningful insights extraction about massive and complex care pathways by clinicians. Results:A data infrastructure has been set up to collect and to access the data securely. We proposed and developed a high level abstraction model to access and to visualize care pathways. We designed the principle of a toolbox to carry out generic pharmaco-epidemiological studies from the SNIIRAM data warehouse (see figure). This toolbox is oriented toward data analytics with data visualisation, domain specific query language, knowledge discovery and statistics modules. Conclusions:The preliminary results {{on the development of the}} PEPS platform show that our care pathways model is very expressive and that it allows to have a highly abstracted representation of the warehouse's complex data. Our modular architecture supports clinicians and epidemiologists all along their analysis process...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{addressed}} {{the value of}} prescription information in research on NSAIDs. Three related studies were conducted using virtually complete longitudinal information, drawn from 36 Dutch pharmacies (1988, 83, 000 NSAIDs prescriptions). Firstly, studies that use prescription information must assign a number of days of therapy to each prescription, traditionally a fixed period. If this window is made unduly long, then validity is compromised. Fixed windows could also confound comparisons between age-gender strata and drugs. Secondly, analyses based on two assumptions for estimation of the duration of use after dispensing showed substantive differences between NSAIDs {{in the distribution of}} patterns and histories of exposure and various other risk factors. Thirdly, switching of one NSAID to another occurred rather frequently within a proxy duration of use, especially in people with a history of unstable usage patterns of NSAIDs.

40|$|Objective: {{to examine}} the key {{determinants}} of <b>pharmaco-epidemiology</b> in Australian nursing homes. Design: a cross-sectional survey of medication use in 998 residents in 15 nursing homes in Southern Queensland and Northern New South Wales, Results: the total, laxative, digoxin/diuretic, benzodiazepine and psycholeptic medication prescribed and administered to residents of nursing homes was affected to differing extents by age and gender, the nursing home, resident functional disability and medical practitioner. Resident Classification Instrument (RCI) category and nursing home were the dominant determinants for prescribing and administration of the total drugs, laxative, benzodiazepine and psycholeptic medications. In contrast, the resident use of digoxin and/or diuretics was dependent on the resident age and on the functional disability (RCI category) of the resident but not medical practitioner or nursing home. Approximately 30 % of medications were prescribed on a pro re nata (p. r. n.) basis and administered {{at the discretion of}} registered nurses. Conclusion: nursing home culture is a major determinant of the variability in medication use between residents, particularly for those medications often prescribed for p. r. n. use. The nursing home does not account for variation in the use of digoxin and/or diuretics which are prescribed on a non-discretionary basis...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackground and objectiveThe use of Symptomatic Slow-Acting Drugs in Osteoarthritis (SYSADOAs) may be {{expected}} to decrease the use of concomitant medications for rescue analgesia, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The <b>Pharmaco-Epidemiology</b> of GonArthroSis (PEGASus) study was designed to assess this possibility. MethodsPEGASus was a cohort study of continuous recruitment of patients with “dynamic” exposure to the investigated SYSADOA (crystalline glucosamine sulfate, glucosamine hydrochloride, chondroitin sulfate, diacerein, and avocado–soybean unsaponifiables, all at approved dosages). Investigators were rheumatologists or general practitioners randomly selected from French telephone lists. Patients diagnosed with knee osteoarthritis (OA) were recruited when consulting an investigator for a symptom flare and were prescribed, or not, one of the SYSADOAs as per clinical judgment. Follow-up visits were as per routine medical practice in the 12 months following enrollment, with telephone interviews after 1 month and at 4 -month intervals thereafter up to 24 months. Use of NSAIDs was recorded, as well as the dynamism of treatment exposure consisting of continuing the prescribed SYSADOA, switching, discontinuation or initiation of a SYSADOA. Patient exposure was expressed in 2 -month time units, with any NSAID use as Yes/No binary outcome during each unit. Odds ratios [OR and 95 % confidence interval (CI) ] of NSAID use were calculated for periods of exposure to each SYSADOA, by multivariate logistic regression for an 80 % power and 95 % confidence to see a decrease of at least 15 %. ResultsThis report consists of the full data pertaining to crystalline glucosamine sulfate, while results of other SYSADOAs were summarized as available from the French Health Authority (HAS) website (www. has-sante. fr). Of 6451 patients in the PEGASus cohort, 315 patients received crystalline glucosamine sulfate, they were exposed for 481 2 -month time units and had an incident use of NSAIDs of 18. 7 %. In the control cohort (9237 time units) NSAID incident use was 23. 8 %. Crystalline glucosamine sulfate significantly decreased the risk of NSAID consumption by up to 36 % (OR = 0. 64; 95 % CI: 0. 45 – 0. 92) in the primary analysis foreseen by the protocol; OR was 0. 74 (95 % CI: 0. 54 – 1. 01), i. e. at the very limit of significance, in a sensitivity analysis accounting for an extension of the study and of the control cohort. None of the other SYSADOAs showed any hint of a decrease in the use of NSAIDs. ConclusionCrystalline glucosamine sulfate was the only SYSADOA that decreased the use of NSAIDs in this <b>pharmaco-epidemiology</b> study in patients with knee OA...|$|E
40|$|Pharmacovigilance is a {{corrective}} process originating in <b>pharmaco-epidemiology.</b> The 1997 Erice Declaration, {{presented at the}} World Health Organisation, became the basis on which the concept was implemented internationally for conventional systems of medicine. The increasing international acceptance of Ayurveda, led regulators to implement a similar program for Ayurveda, particularly as some medical professionals, scientists {{and members of the}} public reported adverse reactions after taking Ayurvedic formulations. The World Health Organisation therefore persuaded the Department of AYUSH, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, to implement a pharmacovigilance program for Ayurveda, as a means to ensuring the safety and efficacy of Ayurvedic medicines. After a year of due diligence, the pharmacovigilance program was launched nationally on 29 September 2008. Since that time, Ayurveda, Siddha and Unani medicines have been monitored according to the provisions of a protocol prepared by the National Pharmacovigilance Resource Centre, IPGTRA, Jamnagar, and approved by Department of AYUSH. The program was reviewed, first, on 21 st January 2009 by the National Pharmaco-vigilance Consultative Committee for ASU drugs (NPCC-ASU), and again, on 15 Feburary, 2010, when an evaluation meeting effectively rubber stamped the program. Among the outcomes of these meetings were several suggestions of measures to improve the program’s efficiency.

40|$|Abstract Background Aspirin {{has been}} {{considered}} to be beneficial in preventing cardiovascular diseases and cancer. Several <b>pharmaco-epidemiology</b> cohort studies have shown protective effects of aspirin on diseases using various statistical methods, with the Cox regression model being {{the most commonly used}} approach. However, there are some inherent limitations to the conventional Cox regression approach such as guarantee-time bias, resulting in an overestimation of the drug effect. To overcome such limitations, alternative approaches, such as the time-dependent Cox model and landmark methods have been proposed. This study aimed to compare the performance of three methods: Cox regression, time-dependent Cox model and landmark method with different landmark times in order {{to address the problem of}} guarantee-time bias. Methods Through statistical modeling and simulation studies, the performance of the above three methods were assessed in terms of type I error, bias, power, and mean squared error (MSE). In addition, the three statistical approaches were applied to a real data example from the Korean National Health Insurance Database. Effect of cumulative rosiglitazone dose on the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma was used as an example for illustration. Results In the simulated data, time-dependent Cox regression outperformed the landmark method in terms of bias and mean squared error but the type I error rates were similar. The results from real-data example showed the same patterns as the simulation findings. Conclusions While both time-dependent Cox regression model and landmark analysis are useful in resolving the problem of guarantee-time bias, time-dependent Cox regression is the most appropriate method for analyzing cumulative dose effects in pharmaco-epidemiological studies...|$|E
40|$|In {{developing}} countries, antibiotics are {{the most}} common drugs sold, and some data suggest that they are frequently misused. In order to describe the pattern of antibiotic use in a periurban community in Mexico City, 1659 randomly-selected households were visited and an interview with the housewife was carried out. Six local drugstores also were selected at random. A social worker made six visits to each pharmacy, observed the events during the purchase of the drug and applied a structured questionnaire to the customer immediately after the transaction. Of 8279 individuals, 425 (5 %) said that they had used at least one antimicrobial in the preceding 2 weeks and antibiotics were the majority (29 %) of the drug sales. The main perceived reasons for drug use were acute respiratory tract ailments and gastroenteritis. Interviewees reported that antibiotic therapy was given in 27 % of respiratory diseases and in 37 % of all diarrheal episodes. The drugs most commonly reported were: penicillins, erythromycin, metronidazole, neomycin, cotrimoxazole and tetracyclines. While self-medication and drug purchases without medical prescription were common, the majority of antibiotics were prescribed by a physician. Approximately two thirds of individuals using an antibiotic said they had used it for less than 5 days and 72 % of the purchases were for insufficient quantities of drugs. Our data suggest that antibiotics are frequently misused and they support the need to assess the determinants of self-medication, health-seeking behavior and physician prescribing practices. The need for effective educational programs to improve prescribers' decisions is stressed. antibiotic community survey pharmacy prescription self-medication <b>pharmaco-epidemiology...</b>|$|E
40|$|Background. Drug-drug {{interaction}} (DDI) is a {{major cause}} of morbidity and mortality. [ [...] . ] Biomedical literature mining can aid DDI research by extracting relevant DDI signals from either the published literature or large clinical databases. However, though drug interaction is an ideal area for translational research, the inclusion of literature mining methodologies in DDI workflows is still very preliminary. One area that can benefit from literature mining is the automatic identification {{of a large number of}} potential DDIs, whose pharmacological mechanisms and clinical significance can then be studied via in vitro pharmacology and in populo <b>pharmaco-epidemiology.</b> Experiments. We implemented a set of classifiers for identifying published articles relevant to experimental pharmacokinetic DDI evidence. These documents are important for identifying causal mechanisms behind putative drug-drug interactions, an important step in the extraction of large numbers of potential DDIs. We evaluate performance of several linear classifiers on PubMed abstracts, under different feature transformation and dimensionality reduction methods. In addition, we investigate the performance benefits of including various publicly-available named entity recognition features, as well as a set of internally-developed pharmacokinetic dictionaries. Results. We found that several classifiers performed well in distinguishing relevant and irrelevant abstracts. We found that the combination of unigram and bigram textual features gave better performance than unigram features alone, and also that normalization transforms that adjusted for feature frequency and document length improved classification. For some classifiers, such as linear discriminant analysis (LDA), proper dimensionality reduction had a large impact on performance. Finally, the inclusion of NER features and dictionaries was found not to help classification. Comment: Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing, 201...|$|E

Patients and methods: Data were drawn from the Schizophrenia Outpatient Health Outcome cohort, including hierarchical information on 6641 patients, recruited from 899 health care centers from across ten European countries. Center-level characteristics included the following: psychiatrist’s gender, age, length of practice experience, practice setting and type, countries’ Healthcare System Efficiency score, and psychiatrist density in the country. Mixed multivariable linear regression models were used: 1) to estimate antipsychotic drugs’ effectiveness (defined as the association between patients’ outcome at 3  months – dependent variable, continuous – and antipsychotic drug initiation at baseline – drug A vs other antipsychotic drug); 2) to estimate the similarity between clustered data (using the intra-cluster correlation coefficient); and 3) to explore antipsychotic drug effects modification by center-related characteristics (using the addition of an interaction term). Results: About 23 % of the variance found for patients’ outcome was explained by unmeasured confounding at a center level. Psychiatrists’ practice experience {{was found to be}} associated with patient outcomes (p= 0. 04) and modified the relative effect of “drug A” (p< 0. 001), independent of center- or patient-related characteristics.

40|$|Abstract Background Increasing use {{is being}} made of {{routinely}} collected electronic patient data in health services research. The aim {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the potential usefulness of a comprehensive database used routinely in the public healthcare system in Hong Kong, using antihypertensive drug prescriptions in primary care as an example. Methods Data on antihypertensive drug prescriptions were retrieved from the electronic Clinical Management System (e-CMS) of all primary care clinics run by the Health Authority (HA) in the New Territory East (NTE) cluster of Hong Kong between January 2004 and June 2007. Information was also retrieved on patients' demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, visit type (new or follow-up), and relevant diseases (International Classification of Primary Care, ICPC codes). Results 1, 096, 282 visit episodes were accessed, representing 93, 450 patients. Patients' demographic and socio-economic details were recorded in all cases. Prescription details for anti-hypertensive drugs were missing in only 18 patients (0. 02 %). However, ICPC-code was missing for 36, 409 patients (39 %). Significant independent predictors of whether disease codes were applied included patient age ≥ 70 years (OR 2. 18), female gender (OR 1. 20), district of residence (range of ORs in more rural districts; 0. 32 – 0. 41), type of clinic (OR in Family Medicine Specialist Clinics; 1. 45) and type of visit (OR follow-up visit; 2. 39). In the 57, 041 patients with an ICPC-code, uncomplicated hypertension (ICPC K 86) was recorded in 45, 859 patients (82. 1 %). The characteristics of these patients were very similar to those of the non-coded group, suggesting that most non-coded patients on antihypertensive drugs are likely to have uncomplicated hypertension. Conclusion The e-CMS database of the HA in Hong Kong varies in quality in terms of recorded information. Potential future health services research using demographic and prescription information is highly feasible but for disease-specific research dependant on ICPC codes some caution is warranted. In the case of uncomplicated hypertension, future research on <b>pharmaco-epidemiology</b> (such as prescription patterns) and clinical issues (such as side-effects of medications on metabolic parameters) seems feasible given the large size of the data set and the comparability of coded and non-coded patients. </p...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Pharm. (Pharmacy Practice)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2008. South African prescribers {{have a large}} {{choice of}} {{combination}} analgesic preparations available for prescribing. According to Desmeules et al. (2003 : 8) the advantages of combining analgesics include increasing the duration of analgesia, widening the spectrum of efficacy, improved patient compliance and reduced parenteral abuse potential. According to McMahon (1975 : 13) one of the principle arguments against fixed-dose combinations is that the physician surrenders flexibility in managing his patient. Combination analgesics may expose patients to ingredients not necessary for pain relief in their particular condition (Beaver, 1984). Rigas (1997 : 454) explains {{that the value of}} pharmaco-economics in providing cost-effective pharmacologic treatment for pain must not only be seen as a containment effort, but rather as a valuation effort. Meaningful economic analyses based on empiric information about cost and a range of subjective and objective outcomes are needed to minimise cost without compromising care. The objective {{of this study was to}} review and interpret the prescribing patterns of combination analgesics and the cost associated with their usage for the period 2001 - 2006 in a section of the private healthcare sector in South Africa. This research can be classified as a quantitative, retrospective drug utilisation review study. Data were obtained from a medicine claims database, and the study population consisted of all combination analgesic prescriptions (Mims® category 3. 3) for the period 1 January 2001 to 31 December 2002 and 1 January 2004 to 31 December 2006. Prescribing Patterns of Combination Analgesics in the Private Health Care Sector. Firstly pain and the treatment thereof with combination analgesics were investigated from the literature to understand the disease and to determine the prevalence and treatment thereof. Secondly, managed health care, drug utilisation review, pharmacoeconomics and <b>pharmaco-epidemiology</b> were investigated from the literature to understand these concepts. The influence of the South African government on the medicine pricing regulations was discussed. Thirdly, through the empirical investigation the utilisation patterns of combination analgesics were reviewed, analysed and interpreted. It was determined that combination analgesic drugs represented 8. 87 % (n= 261 907) of all medicine claimed during 2001 (N= 2 951 326), decreased to 7. 20 % (n= 381 809) during 2004 (N= 5 305 846) after which it increased to 7. 92 % (n= 187 745) in 2006 (N= 2 370 572). Between 2001 (N=R 379 708 489. 00) and 2006 (N=R 279 160 832. 00) the cost percentage of the combination analgesic drugs decreased from 4. 95 % (n=R 18 798 202. 42) to 3. 15 % (n=R 8 791 228. 57). The average cost per combination analgesic drugs decreased from R 71. 77 ± 61. 67 to R 46. 83 ± 43. 41 between 2001 and 2006. This decrease was of no practical significance (d< 0. 8). The average number of combination analgesics per prescription stayed relatively constant varying between 1. 01 ± 0. 11 in 2001 and 1. 02 ± 0. 13 in 2006. The percentage generic combination analgesic drugs claimed increased from 29. 63 % (n= 77 608) in 2001 to 66. 37 % (n= 124 600) in 2006 (N= 261 907 for 2001 and N= 187 745 for 2006) even though generic medicine items claimed by the total database only increased from 26. 79 % (n= 790 548) in 2001 to 40. 27 % (n= 954 561) during 2006 (N= 2 951 326 for 2001 and N= 2 370 572 for 2006). The combination of ibuprofen 200 mg, paracetamol 250 mg and codeine phosphate 10 mg (e. g. Myprodol® capsules, Mybulen® capsules, Gen-payne® capsules and Ibupain Forte® capsules) represented the active ingredient combination with the highest prevalence for the entire study period, increasing from 28. 44 % (n= 74 483) in 2001 to 33. 08 % (n= 62 100) in 2006 of all combination analgesics prescribed (N= 261 907 for 2001 and N= 187 745 for 2006). Generic substitution influenced the prevalence of the innovator medicine item, Myprodol® Capsules dramatically, causing a decrease from 23. 16 % (n= 60 631) in 2001 to 3. 77 % (n= 7 084) in 2006 representation of all combination analgesic prescribed. In 2006, the generics of Myprodol® Capsules e. g. Dentopain Forte®, Mybulen® Capsules, Gen-payne® and Ibupain Forte® represented 23. 79 % (n= 44651) of all combination analgesics claimed. Recommendations were derived regarding certain aspects of the clinical and economical management of pain e. g. the implication of generic substitution with regard to cost and prescribing patterns, and the decreasing cost of combination analgesics which might encourage abuse, needs further investigation.
