40|$|Aim: To {{quantify}} {{the effects of}} using <b>prismatic</b> <b>glasses</b> including optometric correction, on head and neck kinematics, perceived exertion and comfort, during work in the oral cavity. Methods: The study population consisted of forty-five participants. After a basic ergonomic education, baseline measurements of head and neck kinematics were made using inclinometers. Perceived exertion and comfort were rated by the participants. An intervention group (n = 25), selected at random from the participants, received <b>prismatic</b> <b>glasses</b> and optometric correction when needed and were compared with a control group (n = 20). Follow up assessments were made after the intervention. Results: At follow up there was a reduction in both the intervention group (8. 7 degrees) and {{in the control group}} (3. 6 degrees) regarding head flexion. Neck flexion was reduced by 8. 2 degrees in the intervention group and 3. 3 degrees in the control group. The difference between the intervention and the control groups, i. e. the effect of the intervention, was statistically significant for both head (5. 1 degrees; p = 0. 009) and neck (4. 9 degrees; p = 0. 045) flexion. No effect of the intervention was seen regarding perceived exertion and comfort. Conclusion: The reduction in head and neck flexion achieved by the <b>prismatic</b> <b>glasses</b> is likely {{to reduce the risk of}} neck pain during dental work. The effect of the prismatic lenses could not be separated from the effect of the optometric correction. The possible effect of the ergonomic education was not evaluated.

40|$|Unilateral {{visuospatial}} deficits {{have been}} observed in children with brain damage. While the effectiveness of prism adaptation for treating unilateral neglect in adult stroke patients has been demonstrated previously, the usefulness of prism adaptation in a pediatric population is still unknown. The present study aims at evaluating the feasibility of prism adaptation in children with unilateral brain lesion and comparing the validity of a game procedure designed for child-friendly paediatric intervention, with the ecological task used for prism adaptation in adult patients. Methods: Twenty-one children with unilateral brain lesion randomly were assigned to a prism group wearing <b>prismatic</b> <b>glasses,</b> or a control group wearing neutral glasses during a bimanual task intervention. All children performed two different bimanual tasks on randomly assigned consecutive days: ecological tasks or game tasks. The efficacy of prism adaptation was measured by assessing its after-effects with visual open loop pointing (visuoproprioceptive test) and subjective straight-ahead pointing (proprioceptive test). Results: Game tasks and ecological tasks produced similar after-effects. <b>Prismatic</b> <b>glasses</b> elicited a significant shift of visuospatial coordinates which was not observed in the control group. Conclusion: Prism adaptation performed with game tasks seems an effective procedure to obtain after-effects in children with unilateral brain lesion. The usefulness of repetitive prism adaptation sessions as a therapeutic intervention in children with visuospatial deficits and/or neglect, should be investigated in future studies.

40|$|Background: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} effects on perceived exertion, work ability self-reported neck pain and clinically diagnosed conditions in the neck, of an intervention with prismatic spectacles among dental personnel. Methods: In this cohort study a baseline questionnaire including questions about frequency of neck pain, perceived exertion during work and background information was distributed to dental personnel in municipal dental care units. In connection, personnel from 78 out of 110 dental care units underwent a clinical neck examination and rated their perceived work ability with the single-item question from the Work Ability Index. The study population consisted of 564 participants; 366 in the questionnaire group, 321 in the examination group, whereof 123 participated in both assessments. In total 371 belonged to the intervention group and received individually adjusted prismatic spectacles after the baseline assessments (inclusion based on self-selection) and 193 belonged to the reference group. At the 12 -month follow-up the clinical examination was repeated and the same questionnaire with additional questions was completed. Fisher's exact test or the Mann-Whitney U test was used to assess differences between the intervention group and the reference group at baseline. Differences at follow up between the two groups were assessed by means of Linear-by Linear association test for trends. Results: A significant decrease in neck pain (p = 0. 047), clinical diagnoses in the neck (p = 0. 025), and perceived exertion (p = 0. 003) was observed at follow up for the intervention group compared to the reference group. Moreover, for the intervention group a significantly improved self-rated work ability (p = 0. 040) was reported. Finally, opting to wear prismatic spectacles during dental work appeared to have a preventive effect on neck pain. Conclusions: Dental personnel opting to wear prismatic spectacles reduced their neck pain significantly more at follow up compared with the reference group. These results are worthwhile testing in a randomised design. The practical implication of this study is that recommendations regarding ergonomics for dental professionals may include the use of <b>prismatic</b> <b>glasses,</b> both as primary and secondary prevention of work-related neck pain.
