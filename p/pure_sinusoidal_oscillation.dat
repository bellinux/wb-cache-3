40|$|The {{analysis}} of the fully three-dimensional and time-varying polarization characteristics of a modulated trivariate, or three-component, oscillation is addressed. The use of the analytic operator enables the instantaneous three-dimensional polarization state of any square-integrable trivariate signal to be uniquely defined. Straightforward expressions are given which permit the ellipse parameters to be recovered from data. The notions of instantaneous frequency and instantaneous bandwidth, generalized to the trivariate case, are related to variations in the ellipse properties. Rates of change of the ellipse parameters {{are found to be}} intimately linked to the first few moments of the signal's spectrum, averaged over the three signal components. In particular, the trivariate instantaneous bandwidth [...] -a measure of the instantaneous departure of the signal from a single <b>pure</b> <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>oscillation</b> [...] -is found to contain five contributions: three essentially two-dimensional effects due to the motion of the ellipse within a fixed plane, and two effects due to the motion of the plane containing the ellipse. The resulting analysis method is an informative means of describing nonstationary trivariate signals, as is illustrated with an application to a seismic record.

40|$|Energy {{dependent}} phase lags reveal {{crucial information}} about the causal relation between various spectral components and {{about the nature of}} the accretion geometry around the compact objects. The time-lag and the fractional root mean square (rms) spectra of GRS 1915 + 105 in its heartbeat oscillation class/ρ state show peculiar behaviour at the fundamental and harmonic frequencies where the lags at the fundamental show a turn around at ∼ 10 keV while the lags at the harmonic do not show any turn around at least till ∼ 20 keV. The magnitude of lags are of the order of few seconds and hence cannot be attributed to the light travel time effects or Comptonization delays. The continuum X-ray spectra can roughly be described by a disk blackbody and a hard X-ray power-law component and from phase resolved spectroscopy it has been shown that the inner disk radius varies during the oscillation. Here, we propose that there is a delayed response of the inner disk radius (DROID) to the accretion rate such that r_in(t) ∝ṁ^β (t-τ_d). The fluctuating accretion rate drives the oscillations of the inner radius after a time delay τ_d while the power-law component responds immediately. We show that in such a scenario a <b>pure</b> <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>oscillation</b> of the accretion rate can explain not only the shape and magnitude of energy dependent rms and time-lag spectra at the fundamental but also the next harmonic with just four free parameters.

A definitive version was subsequently published in Biosensors and Bioelectronics, 29 (1), 2011, DOI: 10. 1016 /j. bios. 2011. 08. 008 Receptor-based detection of pathogens often suffers from non-specific interactions, and as most detection techniques cannot distinguish between affinities of interactions, false positive responses remain a plaguing reality. Here, we report an anharmonic acoustic based method of detection that addresses the inherent weakness of current ligand dependant assays. Spores of Bacillus subtilis (Bacillus anthracis simulant) were immobilized on a thickness-shear mode AT-cut quartz crystal functionalized with anti-spore antibody and the sensor was driven by a <b>pure</b> <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>oscillation</b> at increasing amplitude. Biomolecular interaction forces between the coupled spores and the accelerating surface caused a nonlinear modulation of the acoustic response of the crystal. In particular, the deviation in the third harmonic of the transduced electrical response versus oscillation amplitude of the sensor (signal) was found to be significant. Signals from the specifically-bound spores were clearly distinguishable in shape from those of the physisorbed streptavidin-coated polystyrene microbeads. The analytical model presented here enables estimation of the biomolecular interaction forces from the measured response. Thus, probing biomolecular interaction forces using the described technique can quantitatively detect pathogens and distinguish specific from non-specific interactions, with potential applicability to rapid point-of-care detection. This also serves as a potential tool for rapid force-spectroscopy, affinity-based biomolecular screening and mapping of molecular interaction networks. © 2011 Elsevier B. V...|$|E

Asthma, a common respiratory disease is associated with ASM hyper-contraction and shortening of airway diameter. This results in occlusion of the airway lumen leading to breathing difficulties.

Finally, we compare their statistical power. It is found that the results for the exemplary time series are comparable. The LR test is more flexible, but always requires the Monte Carlo method for the computation of critical values. The periodogram analysis is computationally faster, because critical values can be approximately deduced from the exponential distribution, at least if the sampling is nearly uniform...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to extend the {{three-dimensional}} (3 -D) passive dynamic biped walker to a 3 -D dynamic biped walker, i. e., a walker that can walk on a horizontal surface based on a passive dynamic walking. A new prototype of 3 -D biped walker called RW 04, which has telescopic knee joints, was developed and its ability for walking was validated through some experiments. A <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>oscillation,</b> which is regarded as a central pattern generator with no sensory feedback, was provided to the knee joints to achieve the biped walking.

Moreover, the 3 -D dynamic walking gait via frequency response and zero moment point (ZMP) trajectory was also analyzed.

An “ 8 ” shaped ZMP trajectory was observed, which was found to be similar to that of the human gait. However, the simple <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>oscillation</b> had limitations such as stride reduction or discontinuation by phase difference.

40|$|Free {{induction}} decay (FID) {{measured by}} {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} (NMR) in a polycrystalline solid is the isotropic average of the FIDs for individual single crystallites. It has been recently proposed theoretically and verified experimentally that the long-time behavior of single-crystal FIDs has the universal form of exponentially decaying <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>oscillations.</b> Polycrystalline averaging complicates the situation theoretically, while the available experimental evidence is also ambiguous. Exponentially decaying <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>oscillations</b> have been observed for Xe- 129 in polycrystalline solid xenon but not for F- 19 in the powder of CaF 2. In this paper, we present the first principles FID calculations for the powders of both CaF 2 and solid xenon. In both cases, the asymptotic long-time behavior has the expected form of exponentially decaying <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>oscillations,</b> which {{is determined by the}} single crystallite FID with the slowest exponential decay. However, this behavior appears only at rather small values of the signal that have not yet been measured in experiments. At intermediate times accessible experimentally, a polycrystalline FID depends on the distribution of the exponential decay constants and oscillation frequencies for single crystallite FIDs. In CaF 2, these parameters are relatively broadly distributed, and as a result, the <b>sinusoidal</b> long-time <b>oscillations</b> become somewhat washed out. In contrast, the single crystallite parameters are more clustered in solid xenon, and, as a result, the experimentally observable range is characterized by well-defined oscillation frequency and exponential decay constant even though both of these parameters do not represent the true long-time behavior. The above difference of the intermediate FID behavior originates from the difference of the crystal structures of solid xenon and CaF 2. Comment: 16 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
