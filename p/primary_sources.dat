If the <b>primary</b> <b>source</b> was not available, the definition (with an indirect citation reference) presented in the secondary source was classified as a secondary/rephrased definition. In some cases, we found that authors had significantly modified or revised the original definition while still citing the <b>primary</b> <b>source.</b> We classified these heavily modified/revised definitions as “modified/revised definitions” and included them {{with the names of}} the secondary source author(s) followed by the <b>primary</b> <b>source</b> author(s).|$|R

40|$|The {{importance}} of <b>primary</b> <b>source</b> materials to scholarship is undeniable. <b>Primary</b> <b>source</b> materials can verify or contradict information accepted as true in history books and other secondary sources. They {{can tell the}} whole, or at least more complete, story of events. Unlike secondary <b>sources,</b> <b>primary</b> <b>source</b> materials offer first-hand accounts from the past, bringing history closer and making it feel more real. It can even be argued that <b>primary</b> <b>source</b> materials are less susceptible to the loss or misinterpretation of information over time in subsequent edition revisions. In particular among <b>primary</b> <b>source</b> materials, manuscripts such as diaries and letters offer glimpses into history where historic figures are untainted and unskewed by the biographers and scholars who interpret them. Unpublished manuscripts have not usually been censored or edited to reflect modern thoughts, beliefs, or politically correct views the way secondary sources often are. At their best, <b>primary</b> <b>source</b> materials reveal new information about people and events from the past.

40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to examine the origins and {{relative}} importance of <b>primary</b> and secondary <b>sources</b> of electric and magnetic fields for excitable tissue.

Even if the divergence and curl of the <b>primary</b> <b>source</b> were independent (and hence were both needed to define the <b>primary</b> <b>source),</b> because the secondary sources all arise from the divergence of the <b>primary</b> <b>source</b> the magnetic field reflects the same source component as the electric field.

For example, wine is prohibited in Islam because of its intoxicating property. Thus qiyas leads to the conclusion that all intoxicants are forbidden.|$|E
