50|$|Flight 845's {{crew had}} planned and {{calculated}} their takeoff for runway 28L, but discovered only after pushback that this runway {{had been closed}} hours earlier for maintenance, and that the first 1000 ft of runway 01R, the <b>preferential</b> <b>runway</b> at that time, had also been closed. After consulting with Pan Am flight controllers and the control tower, the crew decided to take off from runway 01R, shorter compared to 28L, with less favorable wind conditions.|$|E
40|$|A dynamic <b>preferential</b> <b>runway</b> system (DPRS) was {{developed}} for John F. Kennedy International Airport {{for the purpose of}} controlling short term noise exposure in the neighboring communities. The DPRS is a computer-aided procedure for optimum selection of runways from the standpoint of noise and is based upon a community disturbance model which takes into account flyover levels, size of exposed populations, time of day and week, and persistence of overflights. A preliminary evaluation of the DPRS is presented on the basis of social survey data and telephone complaint records, for the trial period of August and September, 1971. Comparative use is made of data taken in a previous survey of the same community areas in 1969...|$|E
40|$|The FAA {{introduced}} an experimental aircraft operations program at JFK Airport called the Dynamic <b>Preferential</b> <b>Runway</b> System (DPRS) {{in the summer}} of 1971. The program is designed to distribute air traffic as equally as possible over the surrounding communities, to limit periods of continuous overflight and to vary the same hours of overflight from day to day. After a full year's operation, an evaluation was made of the system's effectiveness. All of the operation's goals were moderately achieved with the greatest relief in reduced overflight afforded the most heavily impacted areas. Few residents, however, were aware of DPRS or felt that it had greatly reduced annoyance or represented a major effort by the aircraft authorities. Statistical analyses of reported annoyance obtained from two independent surveys in 1969 and 1972 reveal limited reductions in annoyance in 1972, with shifts from reported high annoyance to moderate annoyance...|$|E
50|$|Only runway 6R is {{serviced}} by an instrument approach. It allows pilots to land with ceilings {{as low as}} 250 feet above ground level. Runways 6L and 6R are the <b>preferential</b> <b>runways,</b> and they are used with tailwinds up to 10 knots.|$|R
