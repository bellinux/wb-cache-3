40|$|This paper investigates how {{demographic}} (socioeconomic) and land-use (physical and environmental) {{data can}} be integrated within a decision support framework to formulate and evaluate land-use <b>planning</b> <b>scenarios.</b> A case-study approach is undertaken with land-use <b>planning</b> <b>scenarios</b> for a rapidly growing coastal area in Australia, the Shire of Hervey Bay. The town and surrounding area require careful planning of the future urban growth between competing land uses. Three potential urban growth scenarios are put forth to address this issue. Scenario A (2 ̆ 7 continued growth 2 ̆ 7) is based on existing socioeconomic trends. Scenario B (2 ̆ 7 maximising rates base 2 ̆ 7) is derived using optimisation modelling of land-valuation data. Scenario C (2 ̆ 7 sustainable development 2 ̆ 7) is derived using a number of social, economic, and environmental factors and assigning weightings of importance to each factor using a multiple criteria analysis approach. The land-use <b>planning</b> <b>scenarios</b> are presented {{through the use of}} maps and tables within a geographical information system, which delineate future possible land-use allocations up until 2021. The <b>planning</b> <b>scenarios</b> are evaluated by using a goal-achievement matrix approach. The matrix is constructed with a number of criteria derived from key policy objectives outlined in the regional growth management framework and town planning schemes. The authors of this paper examine the final efficiency scores calculated {{for each of the three}} <b>planning</b> <b>scenarios</b> and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the three land-use modelling approaches used to formulate the final scenarios...|$|R

5000|$|Numerous {{organizations}} have applied scenario planning {{to a broad}} range of issues, from relatively simple, tactical decisions to the complex process of strategic planning and vision building. The power of scenario planning for business was originally established by Royal Dutch/Shell, which has used scenarios since the early 1970s as part of a process for generating and evaluating its strategic options. [...] Shell has been consistently better in its oil forecasts than other major oil companies, and saw the overcapacity in the tanker business and Europe’s petrochemicals earlier than its competitors. [...] But ironically, the approach may have had more impact outside Shell than within, as many others firms and consultancies started to benefit as well from scenario <b>planning.</b> <b>Scenario</b> planning is as much art as science, and prone to a variety of traps (both in process and content) as enumerated by Paul J.

40|$|Land use {{change can}} greatly alter spatial pattern and overall {{ecosystem}} service values (ESV). The {{goal of this}} study was to explore the likely effects of land use change on ESV in China. In this paper, the spatially explicit land use changes across China from 2010 to 2020 under the 2000 s trend scenario and the <b>planning</b> <b>scenario</b> were projected using the Dyna-CLUE model. The ESV evaluation method was improved by adjusting the ESV coefficients using biomass data to reduce the generalization error of proxy-based method. The results revealed that between 2010 and 2020, total ESVincreased by 1798 and 2215 billion RMBa- 1 under the 2000 s trend scenario and the <b>planning</b> <b>scenario,</b> respectively. The spatial pattern of ESV in 2010 and 2020 presented a logical geographic distribution. The areas with ESV of 50, 000 RMB ha(- 1) a(- 1) and higher occurred primarily in northeastern and southern China, while the areas with ESV of 5000 RMB ha(- 1) a(- 1) and lower were mainly located in northwestern China. The spatial differences between the two scenarios were insignificant except that the increase of ESV in southwestern China was more prominent in the <b>planning</b> <b>scenario</b> than that in the 2000 s trend scenario, while the total ESV in 2020 under the <b>planning</b> <b>scenario</b> was larger than that in the 2000 s trend scenario. The increase of ESV occurred mainly in northeastern, southern, and southeastern China due to forest growth and woodland expansion in 2020 compared with 2010.

40|$|Dramatic {{land use}} change is {{expected}} to take place in China in the coming decades, which will exert great impact on the vegetation biomass. The paper assesses how land use change will influence the size and spatial distribution of the vegetation biomass in China. A spatially explicit land use change model, Dyna-CLUE, is employed together with a biomass density approach to account for the effects of forest age on biomass change. Two scenarios have been developed. The first is a trend scenario where land use trends during the period 1985 - 1995 are extrapolated, representing the situation before implementing the national ecological restoration program. The second is a <b>planning</b> <b>scenario</b> which takes into consideration a range of land use planning measures. Possible temporal and spatial distribution of land use and vegetation biomass across China was simulated. The results indicate that under the <b>planning</b> <b>scenario,</b> vegetation biomass would be 15. 47 Gt in 2030, showing an increase by 0. 11 Gt compared to that in 2005. Under the trend scenario, however, the biomass would be 14. 62 Gt in 2030, 0. 02 Gt higher than that in 2005 due to the forest devastation and forest age effect. Seeming to be relatively trivial, the differences between the scenarios are huge in absolute terms, illustrating the impact of land use planning on biomass variation. Compared with the trend scenario, the area of planted forests under the <b>planning</b> <b>scenario</b> will be larger and biomass density lower. Thus under the <b>planning</b> <b>scenario,</b> the vegetation biomass {{will be more likely to}} increase, acting as a carbon sink in the future...|$|E

40|$|In {{this dynamic}} and ever {{changing}} era, uncertainties are inevitable. A successful organisation {{is one that}} is able to address the uncertainties {{in a world that is}} complex and unpredictable. <b>Scenario</b> <b>planning</b> is a strategic management tool that offers an alternative approach to planning in a world where linear logic does not prevail (Geons, 2001). It is a method for learning about the future by understanding the uncertainties and driving forces affecting an organisation’s future. Its core benefits are to facilitate an informed decision making and to enhance organisation learning. Despite its obvious benefits, <b>scenario</b> <b>planning</b> is not widely adopted (Verity, 2003). The methodological confusion and lack of wellestablished and defined implementation process could have contributed to its lack of popularity. This case-study sought to examine the possibility of adopting <b>scenario</b> <b>planning</b> in a Malaysian company, Trojan Berhad’s (not its real name) strategic management process. The approach proposed was based on a study of the current strategic development practices in the said company as well as <b>scenario</b> <b>planning</b> procedures described by van der Heijden, et al (2002). It is hoped that the findings of this study will lead to a better understanding of <b>scenario</b> <b>planning</b> and its adoption in local strategy development practices. The selection of the case for this study was opportunistic as well as one of convenience. I have chosen the company where I worked as the case to study as this proffered a number of advantages which would not be available had I chosen an unrelated company to investigate. The data collection methods used in this study are semi-structured interviews, participant observation and analysis of relevant documents in the subject organisation. This study identified a number of positive aspects underlying Trojan’s current strategic management process that facilitate the adoption of <b>scenario</b> <b>planning</b> process. The organisation’s current strategic management process required minimal adjustment and modification to accommodate <b>scenario</b> <b>planning.</b> Furthermore, adopting <b>scenario</b> <b>planning</b> may be regarded as an extension to what is currently being practised as there is evidence of scenario planning-like procedures in Trojan’s strategic management process. This would help to minimise resistance to the introduction of new concept, i. e. <b>scenario</b> <b>planning.</b> Last but not least, the receptiveness shown by all the respondents who would be directly involved in <b>scenario</b> <b>planning</b> - should it be introduced - would mean that the notion of <b>scenario</b> <b>planning</b> would not be too difficult to introduce to the other levels in the organisation. However, Trojan’s management would still need to address issues such as acculturation of <b>scenario</b> <b>planning</b> process, selection and management of the process and participants in the process, capacity-building for <b>scenario</b> <b>planning,</b> management of <b>scenario</b> development and, last but not least, integration of <b>scenario</b> <b>planning</b> process in existing strategic management processes. minimal adjustment and modification to accommodate <b>scenario</b> <b>planning.</b> Furthermore, adopting <b>scenario</b> <b>planning</b> may be regarded as an extension to what is currently being practised as there is evidence of scenario planning-like procedures in Trojan’s strategic management process.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to discuss the value of <b>scenario</b> <b>planning</b> to small and medium size {{enterprises}} (SMEs), and further examine the challenges constraining the uptake of <b>scenario</b> <b>planning</b> by SMEs. Design/methodology/approach: A conceptual review of the literature on <b>scenario</b> <b>planning</b> in SMEs intended to unpack and capture the possible underlying reasons accounting for the limited uptake of <b>scenario</b> <b>planning</b> by managers/owners of SMEs has informed the formulation of this paper. Findings: The study uncovered that SMEs’ managerial mental models, SMEs’ managerial time orientation, severe resource constraints, and industry complexity are some of the salient factors inhibiting the use of <b>scenario</b> <b>planning</b> among managers/owners of SMEs. The author develops a framework of propositions that account for the complexity and challenges of <b>scenario</b> <b>planning</b> by SMEs for future empirical examination and validation. Originality/value: The conventional wisdom is that <b>scenario</b> <b>planning</b> is carried out by large and established firms, and that SMEs are unable to adopt and practice the technique. This paper uncovers that SME have substantial needs for <b>scenario</b> <b>planning,</b> but are only able to engage in simple foresight activities such as brainstorming, desk research, networking and expert interviews to monitor their external environment. They are unable to effectively use <b>scenario</b> <b>planning</b> in its purest form as in large firms. By bringing together the reasons accounting for the difficulty of SMEs to practice <b>scenario</b> <b>planning</b> in its purest form as large firms do, the study therefore extends the limited discourse on <b>scenario</b> <b>planning</b> among SMEs.
