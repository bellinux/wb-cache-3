5|$|The genus Gymnogyps is {{an example}} of a relict distribution. During the <b>Pleistocene</b> epoch, this genus was {{widespread}} across the Americas. From fossils, the Floridan Gymnogyps kofordi from the Early <b>Pleistocene</b> and the Peruvian Gymnogyps howardae from the Late <b>Pleistocene</b> have been described. A condor found in Late <b>Pleistocene</b> deposits on Cuba was initially described as Antillovultur varonai, but has since been recognized as another member of Gymnogyps, Gymnogyps varonai. It may even have derived from a founder population of California condors.|$|E
5|$|Incapillo is a <b>Pleistocene</b> caldera, a {{depression}} {{formed by the}} collapse of a volcano, in the La Rioja province of Argentina. Part of the Argentine Andes, it is considered the southernmost volcanic centre in the Central Volcanic Zone of the Andes with <b>Pleistocene</b> activity. Incapillo is one of several ignimbritic or calderic systems that, along with 44 active stratovolcanoes, are part of the Central Volcanic Zone.|$|E
5|$|P. l. fossilis, P. fossilis or P. spelaea fossilis, {{known as}} the Middle <b>Pleistocene</b> European cave lion, flourished about 500,000 years ago; fossils have been {{recovered}} from Germany and Italy. It was larger than today's African lions, reaching sizes comparable to the American cave lion and slightly larger than the Upper <b>Pleistocene</b> European cave lion.|$|E
5|$|There {{are a few}} <b>Pleistocene</b> (2.6million to 12,000years BP) {{records from}} Europe of extant Regulus species, mostly goldcrests or unidentifiable to species. The only fossil of an extinct Regulus is a left ulna from 2.6–1.95mya in Bulgaria, which was {{identified}} as belonging to an extinct species, Regulus bulgaricus. The goldcrest lineage diverged from this apparent ancestor of the common firecrest in the Middle <b>Pleistocene.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} fossil loon species are {{known from the}} Pliocene, and {{specimens}} from the <b>Pleistocene</b> of California and Florida appear to represent a paleosubspecies of the common loon.|$|E
5|$|An {{isolated}} {{population in}} Crimea {{has sometimes been}} separated as T. v. tauricus, {{but this is not}} considered to be a valid form. Mistle thrush fossils have been found in <b>Pleistocene</b> deposits from Poland and Sicily.|$|E
5|$|Fossil (or subfossil) black {{vultures}} cannot {{necessarily be}} attributed to the <b>Pleistocene</b> or the recent species without further information: the same size variation found in the living bird was also present in its larger prehistoric relative. Thus, in 1968, Hildegarde Howard separated the Mexican birds as Coragyps occidentalis mexicanus as opposed to the birds from locations farther north (such as Rancho La Brea) which constituted the nominate subspecies C. o. occidentalis. The southern birds were of the same size as present-day north black vultures and can only be distinguished by their somewhat stouter tarsometatarsus and the flatter and wider bills, and even then only with any certainty if the location where the fossils were found is known. As the <b>Pleistocene</b> and current black vultures form an evolutionary continuum rather than splitting into two or more lineages, some include the <b>Pleistocene</b> taxa in C. atratus.|$|E
5|$|Fossil remains {{indicate}} tigers {{were also}} present in Beringia in the north, Japan to the east, and Borneo and Palawan in the Philippines in the south during the Late <b>Pleistocene</b> and Early Holocene.|$|E

5|$|Potassium-argon (K-Ar) dating of the Miri summit {{has yielded}} {{an age of}} 200,000 years, and an older date (5,900,000 ± 2,800,000) has been {{obtained}} from the northwestern centre. Between the two are andesite dates of 5,630,000 ± 90,000 years and 2,390,000 ± 50,000 years. Although the last activity occurred during the <b>Pleistocene</b> (probably a large eruption), volcanism began earlier. The youngest date, obtained from K-Ar dating of pumice, is 90,000 ± 10,000 years. Koh-i-Sultan's <b>Pleistocene</b> activity is probably related {{to the formation of}} travertine deposits, which are mined.|$|E

5|$|The extinct Protylopus, which {{occurred}} in North America during the upper Eocene, {{is the oldest}} and the smallest-known camel. During the transition from Pliocene to <b>Pleistocene,</b> several mammals faced extinction. This period marked the successful radiation of the Camelus species, which migrated over the Bering Strait and dispersed widely into Asia, eastern Europe and Africa. By the <b>Pleistocene,</b> ancestors of the dromedary occurred in the Middle East and northern Africa.|$|E
5|$|The oldest fossils {{that fall}} {{within the range of}} the modern coyote date to 0.74–0.85 Ma (million years) in Hamilton Cave, West Virginia; 0.73 Ma in Irvington, California; 0.35–0.48 Ma in Porcupine Cave, Colorado and in Cumberland Cave, Pennsylvania. Modern coyotes arose 1,000 years after the Quaternary {{extinction}} event. Compared to their modern Holocene counterparts, <b>Pleistocene</b> coyotes (C.l. orcutti) were larger and more robust, likely in response to larger competitors and prey. <b>Pleistocene</b> coyotes were likely more specialized carnivores than their descendants, as their teeth were more adapted to shearing meat, showing fewer grinding surfaces suited for processing vegetation. Their reduction in size occurred within 1000 years of the Quaternary extinction event, when their large prey died out. Furthermore, <b>Pleistocene</b> coyotes were unable to exploit the big-game hunting niche left vacant after the extinction of the dire wolf (C.dirus), as it was rapidly filled by gray wolves, which likely actively killed off the large coyotes, with natural selection favoring the modern gracile morph.|$|E
5|$|The present genera of Alcelaphinae {{appeared}} in the Pliocene. The extinct Alcelaphine genus Paramularius, {{that was the same}} in size as the hartebeest, is believed to have come into being in the Pliocene, but became extinct in the middle <b>Pleistocene.</b> Several genera of Hippotraginae are known since the Pliocene and <b>Pleistocene.</b> This subfamily appears to have diverged from the Alcelaphinae {{in the latter part of}} early Miocene. The Bovinae are believed to have diverged from the rest of the Bovidae in the early Miocene. The Boselaphini became extinct in Africa in the early Pliocene; their latest fossils were excavated in Langebaanweg (South Africa) and Lothagam (Kenya).|$|E
5|$|The three paleontologists Xiaoming Wang, Richard H. Tedford, and Ronald M. Nowak have {{proposed}} that C.dirus evolved from Canis armbrusteri, with Nowak stating that specimens found in Cumberland Cave, Maryland, appear to be C.armbrusteri diverging into C.dirus. The early wolf from China, Canis chihliensis, {{may have been the}} ancestor of both C.armbrusteri and the gray wolf C.lupus. The sudden appearance of C.armbrusteri in North America during the Early <b>Pleistocene</b> suggests that this was an immigrant from Asia, as was C.lupus later in the <b>Pleistocene.</b> In 2010 Francisco Prevosti proposed that C.dirus was a sister taxon to C.lupus.|$|E
5|$|The {{whole of}} Scotland {{was covered by}} ice sheets during the <b>Pleistocene</b> ice ages and the {{landscape}} is much affected by glaciation. From a geological perspective, the country has three main sub-divisions.|$|E
5|$|There is {{evidence}} that ancestors of the fisher migrated to North America during the Pliocene era between 2.5 and 5 million years ago. Two extinct mustelids, M. palaeosinensis and M. anderssoni, {{have been found in}} eastern Asia. The first true fisher, M. divuliana, has only been found in North America. There are strong indications that M. divuliana is related to the Asian finds, which suggests a migration. M. pennanti has been found as early as the Late <b>Pleistocene</b> era, about 125,000 years ago. There are no major differences between the <b>Pleistocene</b> fisher and the modern fisher. Fossil evidence indicates that the fisher's range extended farther south than it does today.|$|E
5|$|Three {{species of}} {{hippopotamus}}, the European hippopotamus (Hippopotamus antiquus), Hippopotamus major and Hippopotamus gorgops, ranged throughout continental Europe and the British Isles. All three species became extinct {{before the last}} glaciation. Ancestors of European hippos {{found their way to}} many islands of the Mediterranean Sea during the <b>Pleistocene.</b> The <b>Pleistocene</b> also saw a number of dwarf species evolve on several Mediterranean islands, including Crete (Hippopotamus creutzburgi), Cyprus (the Cyprus dwarf hippopotamus, Hippopotamus minor), Malta (Hippopotamus melitensis), and Sicily (Hippopotamus pentlandi). Of these, the Cyprus dwarf hippopotamus survived {{until the end of the}} <b>Pleistocene</b> or early Holocene. Evidence from an archaeological site, Aetokremnos, continues to cause debate on whether or not the species was encountered, and was driven to extinction, by man.|$|E
5|$|A future rewilding {{project was}} {{proposed}} for Siberian tigers {{set to be}} reintroduced to northern Russia's <b>Pleistocene</b> park. The Siberian tigers sent to Iran for a captive breeding project in Tehran are set to be rewilded and reintroduced to the Miankaleh peninsula, to replace the now extinct Caspian tigers.|$|E
5|$|About {{four stages}} of {{glaciation}} {{have been recognized}} in the area during the <b>Pleistocene,</b> although the glacial history is poorly known. Monte Burney was glaciated during the last glacial maximum. During the early Holocene, glaciers retreated quickly then slowed down during the Antarctic Cold Reversal. A slight expansion is noted during the Little Ice Age.|$|E
5|$|Alexander S. Lloyd, {{a student}} of Dickinson College, focused on the cooling rates of pillow lavas. Lloyd studied in detail the {{variation}} in crystal sizes from the edge pristine pillow lava, which could have derived from nearby Pillow Ridge which last erupted during the <b>Pleistocene</b> period.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with most}} of the <b>Pleistocene</b> megafauna, Smilodon became extinct 10,000 years ago in the Quaternary {{extinction}} event. Its extinction has been linked to the decline and extinction of large herbivores, which were replaced by smaller and more agile ones like deer. Hence, Smilodon could have been too specialized at hunting large prey and may have been unable to adapt. A 2012 study of Smilodon tooth wear found no evidence that they were limited by food resources. Other explanations include climate change and competition with humans (who entered the Americas around the time Smilodon disappeared), or a combination of several factors, all of which apply to the general <b>Pleistocene</b> extinction event, rather than specifically to the extinction of the saber-toothed cats.|$|E
5|$|Differences in songs, {{genetics}} and morphology {{suggests that the}} Azores were colonised in a single invasion in the late <b>Pleistocene,</b> about 100,000 years ago. It {{is likely that the}} initial colonisation was of the easternmost islands, with a subsequent spread to the central and western island groups from the western caldera of São Miguel, where both eastern and western song types are found.|$|E
5|$|During the Late <b>Pleistocene,</b> {{the more}} southerly {{occurring}} dire wolf (Canis dirus) {{had the same}} shape and proportions as the Yukon wolf, but the dire wolf subspecies C.dirusguildayi is estimated to have weighed on average , and the subspecies C.dirusdirus on average , with some specimens being larger. The dire wolf was heavier than the Beringian wolf and possessed a more robust skull and dentition.|$|E
5|$|Eruptive {{activity}} at Mentolat has been ongoing since the <b>Pleistocene,</b> with the earliest explosive eruptions occurring over 17,340 years ago. An eruption {{during the late}} Glacial formed the MENo tephra. The volcanic activity has been inferred from tephra layers in lakes and outcrops.|$|E
5|$|Fossil Nothofagus {{leaves in}} the Meyer Desert Formation of the Sirius Group show that {{intermittent}} warm periods allowed Nothofagus shrubs to cling to the Dominion Range as late as 3–4 Ma (mid-late Pliocene). After that, the <b>Pleistocene</b> ice age covered the whole continent and destroyed all major plant life on it.|$|E
