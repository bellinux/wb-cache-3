25|$|In general {{there are}} two ways to set up a {{transducer}} system to measure the sound velocity in a solid. One is a setup with two or more transducers where one is acting as a transmitter, while the other(s) is acting as a receiver. The sound velocity measurement can then be done by measuring the time between a signal is generated at the transmitter and when it is recorded at the receiver while assuming to know (or measure) the distance the acoustic signal have traveled between the transducers, or conversely to measure the resonance frequency knowing the thickness over which the wave resonate. The other type of setup is often called a <b>pulse-echo</b> system. Here one transducer is placed in the vicinity of the specimen acting both as transmitter and receiver. This requires a reflective interface where the generated signal can be reflected back toward the transducer which then act as a receiver recording the reflected signal.

5000|$|There are {{two methods}} of {{receiving}} the ultrasound waveform: reflection and attenuation. In reflection (or <b>pulse-echo)</b> mode, the transducer performs both the sending and the receiving of the pulsed waves as the [...] "sound" [...] is reflected {{back to the}} device. Reflected ultrasound comes from an interface, such as {{the back wall of}} the object or from an imperfection within the object. The diagnostic machine displays these results {{in the form of a}} signal with an amplitude representing the intensity of the reflection and the distance, representing the arrival time of the reflection. In attenuation (or through-transmission) mode, a transmitter sends ultrasound through one surface, and a separate receiver detects the amount that has reached it on another surface after traveling through the medium. Imperfections or other conditions in the space between the transmitter and receiver reduce the amount of sound transmitted, thus revealing their presence. Using the couplant increases the efficiency of the processby reducing the losses in the ultrasonic wave energy due to separation between the surfaces.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{nondestructive}} testing using ultrasonic <b>pulse-echo</b> data {{is an effective}} method especially for metal structure. Typically, the ultrasonic <b>pulse-echo</b> data is processed {{and the results are}} shown in A-scan, B-scan or C-scan data formats. In conventional testing using ultrasonic <b>pulse-echo</b> data, the inspector is able to identify the location of faults as well as their rough dimensions upon viewing B-scan and C-scan data. In this paper, we propose an approach using 3 -D visualization of ultrasonic <b>pulse-echo</b> data. The main idea of the proposed method is to use various 3 -D visualization methods frequently used in medical image visualization systems, namely, surface rendering (SR), volume rendering (VR) and maximum intensity projection (MIP). Such 3 -D visualization of ultrasonic <b>pulse-echo</b> data enables easier identification of the location and dimension of faults more accurately...|$|E

In this study pattern classifiers are implemented by artificial neural network of backpropagation type using MATLAB®. The ultrasonic signals acquired from <b>pulse-echo</b> and TOFD were introduced, separately, in the artificial neural network with and without preprocessing. The preprocessing was only used to smoothen the signal improving the classification. Four conditions of weld bead were evaluated: lack of fusion (LF), lack of penetration (LP), porosity (PO) and non-defect (ND). The defects were intentionally inserted in a weld bead of AISI 1020 steel plates of 20 mm thickness and were confirmed using radiographic tests.

The ultrasonic contact <b>pulse-echo</b> immersion testing technique with two types of ultrasonic transducers mounted into a moving water container was used for investigation of the artificial internal defects in a wind turbine blade. These defects (diameter 81 mm, 49 mm and 19 mm) were made on the internal side of the main spar. The contact <b>pulse-echo</b> immersion testing (using a moving water container) of the wind turbine blade was performed using two different transducers: focused 2. 2 MHz and planar 400 kHz.

40|$|A novel {{method for}} the fast {{acquisition}} and {{the recovery of}} ultrasound images disrupts the tradeoff between the image acquisition rate and the image quality. It recovers the spatial compressibility fluctuations in weakly-scattering soft tissue structures from only a few sequential <b>pulse-echo</b> measurements of the scattered sound field. The underlying linear inverse scattering problem uses a realistic d-dimensional physical model for the <b>pulse-echo</b> measurement process, accounting for diffraction, the combined effects of power-law absorption and dispersion, and the specifications of a planar transducer array. Postulating {{the existence of a}} nearly-sparse representation of the spatial compressibility fluctuations in a suitable orthonormal basis, the compressed sensing framework ensures its stable recovery by a sparsity-promoting ℓ_q-minimization method, if the <b>pulse-echo</b> measurements of the individual basis functions are sufficiently incoherent. The novel method meets this condition by leveraging the degrees of freedom in the syntheses of the incident ultrasonic waves. It emits three types of random ultrasonic waves that outperform the widely-used steered quasi-plane waves (QPWs).
