40|$|Objectives. The {{national}} Department of Health strongly advocates {{the strengthening}} of primary health care systems, and recommendations for appropriate level of care referrals exist. Very few published data on the scope of current ambulatory specialised <b>psychiatric</b> <b>hospital</b> <b>services</b> in South Africa are currently available, {{making it difficult to}} assess whether these recommendations are being followed. As a starting point, an audit was conducted to obtain a profile of new non-urgent general adult patients seen at Stikland Hospital with a view to evaluating system needs and demands. Methods. The folders of 103 consecutively seen patients were selected for retrospective review. Patient demographic, referral and assessment information was entered into a single database. Descriptive statistics were compiled with reference to the above variables using SPSS. Results. Overall 58. 3 % of referrals were from the private sector. More than a third (36. 7 %) of referral letters stated no clear reason for referral and 41. 7 % no psychiatric diagnosis, and 29. 1 % of patients were referred without psychotropic medication being started. On assessment 62. 1 % of patients were found to have a single Axis I diagnosis. Despite virtually no referral letters making any mention of them, substance use disorders (30. 1 %), personality traits/disorders (35. 9 %) and co-morbid medical illness (36. 7 %) were commonly found on assessment. Conclusions. A significant portion of the patients in our sample could have been managed at primary care level and were referred prematurely. The overall quality of referral letters was poor, and they lacked vital information required for appropriate pre-assessment decision making. Undergraduate training focusing on these skills should be intensified, and consideration should be given to incorporating aspects of our findings into primary health care updates...|$|E
40|$|Using 38 {{focussed}} accounts {{the author}} {{reports on the}} hospitalization experiences of patients 18 to 38 years old in the psychiatric ward. The sample comes from the psychiatric wards of two general hospitals in the Montr&eacute;al area (Canada). The {{data were analyzed using}} a qualitative method. Empirical categories were inferred from the respondents ’ discourse based on the broad themes which make up the psychiatric experience: admission; hospital environment and rules; daily life; medication; relations with the staff and leaving the hospital. The results shed light on the suffering, dissatisfaction and ambivalent feelings surrounding the patients ’ hospital experience. Based on the experience of psychiatric patients, the author identified five processes at work during psychiatric hospitalization. Throughout the numerous transformations that have marked the evolution of psychiatric services in Quebec, there has been a consistent failure to consult one of the interested parties: the users of <b>psychiatric</b> <b>hospital</b> <b>services.</b> This article seeks to portray in a systematic and rigorous manner the everyday experience of psychiatric hospitalization (EEPH) of individuals who have been hospitalized on a psychiatric ward.

30|$|In our study, {{the finding}} of {{increased}} incidence of pediatric bipolar disorder diagnoses {{did not seem to}} be explained by increased attention to bipolar disorder among clinicians and an earlier age at first diagnosis as the high prevalence of onset during childhood or adolescents (30 %– 60 %) found in recent studies might suggest (Post et al. [2008]). There were no differences between early versus late in the study period in age at index diagnosis, the fractions of first contact diagnosis of mania/bipolar disorder diagnoses, the contact number at which patients got the diagnosis, or the duration from first psychiatric contact to the diagnosis of mania/bipolar disorder. Indeed, it is unlikely that increased diagnostic attention in primary care (general practitioners or private psychiatrists) or within <b>psychiatric</b> <b>hospital</b> <b>service</b> would not have led to a change in these parameters. On the other hand, during the study period, significant changes in diagnostic habits or treatment-seeking behavior of subjects took place. The proportion of patients who got an index diagnosis of a single manic or mixed episode decreased during the study period from 40.5 % to 25.5 %, and the proportion of bipolar disorders diagnosed in manic episodes decreased from 70.3 to 48.3 % whereas the proportion diagnosed in remission or depressive episodes increased from 10.8 % to 23.9 % and 7.2 % to 14.1 %, respectively (Table 1). These changes in the bipolar index diagnosis could at least partly be an artifact as more patients in the first calendar period may have had a <b>psychiatric</b> outpatient <b>hospital</b> contact, which was not recorded in the Danish Psychiatric Central Research Register prior to 1995. Alternatively, one might suggest that these changes in diagnostic habits or treatment-seeking behavior could reflect a higher proportion of patients being diagnosed with bipolar disorder, type II, during the more recent calendar period. For example, it is possible that patients more frequently might have sought help for depressive or mixed episodes or comorbid disorders during the second calendar period, which finally led to the diagnosis of a bipolar disorder in depression or remission. However, again, it is unlikely that such increased attention to bipolar disorder could have occurred without changes in age at index diagnosis, the fractions of first contact diagnosis of mania/bipolar disorder diagnoses, the contact number at which patients got the diagnosis, or the duration from first psychiatric contact to the diagnosis of mania/bipolar disorder.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess sentinel event analysis and relative factors in different mental healthcare settings. In addition, the occurrence of sentinel events in different hospital settings was compared and potential risk factors contributing to sentinel events identified. Methods A total of 75 consecutive adult subjects were enrolled from 2 psychiatric units, 1 within a general hospital and 1 at a <b>psychiatric</b> <b>hospital</b> in southern Taiwan. A retrospective chart review of the psychiatric inpatients was conducted for patients that met the criteria for a sentinel event between July 2004 and May 2011. A comparison of the hospital settings was made and differences between suicidal and non-suicidal sentinel events studied. Results Psychiatric patients that received general <b>hospital</b> <b>psychiatric</b> <b>services</b> (1) appeared to experience a sentinel event soon after admission, (2) the time between the sentinel event occurrence and patient death was shorter, (3) there was a higher probability of potential medical illness than among inpatients treated at a specialized <b>psychiatric</b> <b>hospital,</b> (4) the sentinel event subjects that committed suicide were younger, had a shorter hospital stay, shorter time to occurrence of the sentinel event followed by an unexpected death than the non-suicidal group, and (5) a younger age, higher education level, previous suicide attempt and family psychiatric history were important predictors of suicide among psychiatric inpatients. Conclusions The results of this study suggest that psychiatric inpatients treated at a general hospital require careful examination for potential physical illness and greater efforts to prevent suicide. A younger age, higher education level, history of a previous suicide attempt and family psychiatric history are additional risk factors for suicide among these patients. </p...|$|R
