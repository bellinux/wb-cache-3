None of the mottoshows have reached 5 million viewers. season 1 {{averaged}} 8.09 million viewers and season 8 averaged 6.32 million viewers in the show's key demographic (ages 14 to 49).

25|$|Wayang {{refers to}} the entire {{dramatic}} show. Sometimes the leather puppet itself {{is referred to as}} wayang. Performances of shadow puppet theatre are accompanied by a gamelan orchestra in Java, and by gender wayang in Bali. The dramatic stories depict mythologies, such as episodes from the Hindu epics the Ramayana, the Mahabharata as well as local adapations of cultural legends. Traditionally, a wayang is played out in a ritualized midnight-to-dawn show by a dalang, an artist and spiritual leader; <b>people</b> <b>watch</b> the show {{from both sides of the}} screen.|$|E
25|$|Tensely, <b>people</b> <b>watch</b> for the hurricane's arrival. The men sing a hymn-like admonition {{not to be}} afraid. Jim meditatively compares Nature's savagery to the {{far greater}} destructiveness of Man. Why do we build, he asks, {{if not for the}} {{pleasure}} of destroying? Since Man can outdo any hurricane, fear makes no sense. For the sake of human satisfaction, nothing should be forbidden: If you want another man's money, his house or his wife, knock him down and take it; do what you please. As Begbick and the men ponder Jimmy's philosophy, Fatty and Moses rush in with news: The hurricane has unexpectedly struck Pensacola, destroying Begbick’s enemies, the federal agents. Begbick and her cohorts take it as a sign that Jimmy is right; they join him, Jenny, and his three friends in singing a new, defiant song: If someone walks on, then it's me, and if someone gets walked on, then it's you. In the background, the men continue to chant their hymn as the hurricane draws nearer.|$|E

By May of that year, Grushaw said renewing Brisco was a 50–50 call. At the end of its season, Brisco was one of the lowest rated shows of the year, and Fox confirmed its cancellation in June.|$|E

It wasn’t like {{we had a lot}} of <b>people</b> <b>watch</b> it and they didn’t come back to it. If anything, I think we were building slowly, but to me the way TV works is you spend a lot of money advertising and promoting, or you have to let a show stay some place for a long period of time and an audience slowly comes to it.
