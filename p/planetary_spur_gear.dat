40|$|In {{this paper}} the authors propose {{a method for}} the {{kinematic}} and power-flow analysis of bevel epicyclic gear trains with gyroscopic complexity. By gyroscopic complexity, we mean {{the possibility of the}} gear carrier to be a floating link as, for instance, in robotic gear wrists. Thanks to the new formulas herein deduced, the methods based on the graph representation of <b>planetary</b> <b>spur</b> <b>gear</b> trains have been extended to bevel gear trains. In particular, the well known Willis equation has been modified to maintain its validity for bevel gears. The modified Willis equation was then embodied in new power ratio expressions. Under our simplifying hypotheses of absence of friction and constant angular speeds, it is shown that gyroscopic torques do not enter into power flow analysis. Two numerical examples are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Geared {{systems have}} been widely used in {{mechanical}} applications for more than a hundred years. A large range of literature has been published especially for spur/helical gear systems and the investigations into technical areas of spur/helical gears have been very well developed, including understanding of condition monitoring systems, diagnostic and prognostic methods. However, {{there is a lack of}} understanding on the general dynamic behavior of planetary gear systems with tooth faults. Planetary gears are normally used as effective power transmission elements with high power to weight/volume ratios, large speed reductions in compact volume, and high reliability. They tend to have high efficiency and are used in many applications, such as automotive, heavy truck/tractor, helicopter, wind turbines and bucket wheel reclaimer gearboxes. The purpose of this research is to develop a vibration analysis system that simulates dynamic behavior of large low speed, high torque <b>planetary</b> <b>spur</b> <b>gear</b> systems such as used in bucket wheel reclaimer and wind turbine gearboxes, with and without gear element faults. This thesis investigates lumped mass modelling methods for planetary gearbox dynamic behavior based on previous gearbox modelling research including the use of the coupled torsional-transverse behavior of the gear body. The dynamic model of the <b>planetary</b> <b>spur</b> <b>gear</b> system includes effects such as: variable tooth mesh stiffness, dynamic transmission error effects, and pitch and profile excitation for gear fault detection purposes. Different tooth faults are simulated using the concept of combined torsional mesh stiffness. The dynamics of spur planetary gear systems with and without tooth faults are compared and analyzed to improve the understanding of fault detection in the present gear systems. Dynamic modelling of gear systems, such as outlined in this thesis can assist in understanding the consequence of large transient events, including the fluctuations in tooth loads which can reduce gear fatigue life and lead to further tooth damage. Early detection of faults on gear teeth can be used to initiate maintenance actions in order to reduce repair work and avoid catastrophic breakdown...|$|E

40|$|The {{multiple}} mesh/single stage dynamics {{program is}} a gear tooth analysis program which determines detailed geometry, dynamic loads, stresses, and surface damage factors. The program can analyze a variety of both epicyclic and single mesh systems with <b>spur</b> or helical <b>gear</b> teeth including internal, external, and buttress tooth forms. The modifications refine the options for the flexible carrier and flexible ring gear rim and adds three options: a floating Sun gear option; a natural frequency option; and a finite element compliance formulation for helical gear teeth. The option for a floating Sun incorporates two additional degrees of freedom at the Sun center. The natural frequency option evaluates the frequencies of planetary, star, or differential systems {{as well as the}} effect of additional springs at the Sun center and those due to a flexible carrier and/or ring gear rim. The helical tooth pair finite element calculated compliance is obtained from an automated element breakup of the helical teeth and then is used with the basic gear dynamic solution and stress postprocessing routines. The flexible carrier or ring gear rim option for <b>planetary</b> and star <b>spur</b> <b>gear</b> systems allows the output torque per carrier and ring gear rim segment to vary based on the dynamic response of the entire system, while the total output torque remains constant...|$|R

Yang [16] proposed a method based on the Fourier series and calculated sensitivity of forced vibration to mass and stiffness of helical planetary gears. This method is mathematically effective, though the relationships between sensitivity calculation and structured vibrations need further research.|$|R
