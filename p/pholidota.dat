25|$|In the 2000s {{understanding}} of the relationships among eutherian mammals has experienced a virtual revolution. Molecular phylogenomics, new fossil finds and innovative morphological interpretations now group the more than 4600 extant species of eutherians into four major super-ordinal clades: Euarchontoglires (including Primates, Dermoptera, Scandentia, Rodentia, and Lagomorpha), Laurasiatheria (Cetartiodactyla, Perissodactyla, Carnivora, Chiroptera, <b>Pholidota,</b> and Eulipotyphla), Xenarthra, and Afrotheria (Proboscidea, Sirenia, Hyracoidea, Afrosoricida, Tubulidentata, and Macroscelidea). This tree is very useful in unifying the parts of a puzzle in comparative mammalian cytogenetics.|$|E

50|$|The Ferae are a clade of mammals, {{consisting}} of the orders Carnivora (over 260 species, around the globe) and <b>Pholidota</b> (eight species of pangolins in tropical Africa and Asia). Pangolins do not look much like carnivorans (wolves, cats, seals, and so on), and {{were thought to be}} the closest relatives of Xenarthra (armadillos, sloths, and so on), but recent DNA research found the close relationship to carnivorans. Several extinct orders, relatives of the <b>Pholidota,</b> such as Creodonts, are members of Ferae as well.

50|$|Scrotifera is a clade of placental mammals that {{comprises}} the following orders and their common ancestors: Chiroptera, Carnivora, <b>Pholidota,</b> Perissodactyla and Cetartiodactyla, {{with the latter}} including the traditional orders Artiodactyla and Cetacea. Scrotifera is the sister group to the Eulipotyphla and together they make up the Laurasiatheria.|$|E

50|$|Hyaenodontids were {{historically}} classified in Creodonta, alongside other predatory mammal {{groups like}} oxyaenids. Some researchers consider the clade a wastebasket taxon containing two unrelated clades {{assumed to be}} closely related to or ancestral to Carnivora. However, a recent phylogenetic analysis of Paleogene mammals supports the monophyly of Creodonta, and places them in Ferae, close to <b>Pholidota.</b>|$|E
50|$|Pangolins are mammals of {{the order}} <b>Pholidota.</b> The one extant family, Manidae, has three genera: Manis, which {{comprises}} four species living in Asia; Phataginus, which comprises two species living in Africa; and Smutsia, which comprises two species also living in Africa.

50|$|The Anoplura are all blood-feeding ectoparasites of mammals. They only {{occur on}} about 20% of all placentalian mammal species, and are unknown from several orders of mammals (Monotremata, Edentata, <b>Pholidota,</b> Chiroptera, Cetacea, Sirenia and Proboscidea). They can cause {{localized}} skin irritations and are vectors of several blood-borne diseases. Children appear particularly susceptible to attracting lice, possibly {{due to their}} fine hair.|$|E
5000|$|Within the Hawaiian Islands, Calliasamata <b>pholidota</b> {{is known}} to occur in mid-to highsalinity anchialine pools. C. <b>pholidota</b> has a disjunct, Indo-Pacific distribution, being {{reported}} from the Red Sea-Sinai Peninsula, Funafuti Atoll, and the Hawaiian Islands of Maui and Hawaii. On the island of Hawaii, the species habitates one pool at Ka Lae at Lua o Palahemo and in one pool group in the Manuka Natural Area Reserve. On Maui, it is found in four pool groups in Ahihi-Kinau. At Lua o Palahemo, it co-occurs with three other candidate species of anchialine pool shrimp, Antecaridina lauensis, Procaris hawaiana, and Vetericaris chaceorum. In the aforementioned sightings, specimens were not abundant, and as such this species has been considered for endangered species status, as their numbers {{are assumed to be}} considerably small. Like other anchialine pool shrimp species, it is believed that this species inhabits an extensive network of water-filled [...] spaces leading to and from the actual pool.|$|E
50|$|Several {{groups have}} {{previously}} been suggested to have {{descended from the}} Cimolesta: the <b>Pholidota</b> (which would have been regarded as a suborder of Cimolesta), the Creodonta, and the Carnivora. The origins of the enigmatic Dinocerata have been suggested to lie within the Cimolesta as well. However, recent studies have revealed that cimolestans {{are more likely to}} be basal, non-placental eutherians, with no living descendants.|$|E
50|$|The {{traditional}} {{taxonomy of}} the genus Coelogyne is still disputed. Coelogyne has been subdivided in 23 sections or subgenera by De Vogel (1994) and Clayton. Molecular data show that Coelogyne is paraphyletic and should be reorganised. It should include the genera Neogyna and <b>Pholidota,</b> and several sections should be removed, including Cyathogyne, Tomentosae, Rigidiformes, Veitchiae and Verrucosae. This new genus Coelogyne should then contain about 160 species.|$|E
50|$|The long-tailed {{pangolin}} (Phataginus tetradactyla), {{also called}} the African black-bellied pangolin, or ipi, is an arboreal pangolin belonging to the family Manidae, in the order <b>Pholidota.</b> The common names for this species stem from physical characteristics, such as the extremely long tail or the dark hairs that cover the underside of their bodies and limbs. Pangolin comes from the Malay word pengguling, meaning “something that rolls up”.|$|E
