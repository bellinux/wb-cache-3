Part time was defined as receiving less than a full <b>profit</b> <b>share</b> at parity. Of 501 women principals 308 (62 %) responded of whom 146 (47 %) were part-time. Respondents were asked to record aspects of workload over a four-week period {{for themselves and their}} full-time partner who did the most sessions within the practice.

40|$|Profits {{growth has}} been strong in many {{developed}} economies in recent years, and the <b>profit</b> <b>share</b> - the share of factor income going to capital – has been high compared with historical experience. This paper shows that, rather than being a recent phenomenon, <b>profit</b> <b>shares</b> have trended upwards since about the mid 1980 s in most developed economies for which comparable data are available. There {{are a number of}} possible explanations for this, but not all of them are consistent with a global trend over two decades, nor do they fit cross-country differences in the trend in the <b>profit</b> <b>share.</b> The preferred explanation advanced in this paper is that ongoing technological progress has increased the rate of obsolescence of capital goods. This induces a greater rate of churn in both capital and jobs, which puts firms in a stronger bargaining position relative to a labour force that now faces more frequent job losses on average. Firms can therefore reap a larger fraction of the economic surplus created by market frictions, which raises the measured <b>profit</b> <b>share.</b> This effect is stronger where labour market institutions are more rigid, consistent with the cross-country pattern in the trends in the <b>profit</b> <b>share.</b> There is also a positive relationship between the size of the trend in the <b>profit</b> <b>share,</b> and the extent of product market regulation. This suggests a role for competition and innovation in driving down high profit margins. These explanations appear to fit the data better than alternatives raised in the literature. <b>Profit</b> <b>share,</b> technological progress, vintage capital...|$|R

After dropping {{in the first half}} of the 1070 s, owing to an unprecedented rapid rise in wages, <b>profit</b> <b>share</b> started to recover. The rise during the 1980 s involved the entire business sector and was part of this recovery process.

We show that the better performance of the non-manufacturing business sector is mainly due to the industries most affected by the large-scale privatisations and restructuring of State-owned companies that began {{in the first half of}} the 1990 s. They led to a rapid growth in total factor productivity and a deceleration in wages, without a major impact on the market power of privatised companies, even those previously in the position of incumbent monopolists.
