Alongside the 1A26 digital computer and the 1G30 angle measurement system form the 1A27 radar complex. Tunguska-M has the 1RL144M radar with detection range 18km and tracking range 16km-near of the original system's. The mechanically scanned target acquisition radar for the Tunguska-M1 offers a 360-degree field of view, a detection range of around 18km and can detect targets flying as low as 15 m, the target acquisition radar can be stowed when in transit. Its tracking radar has a range of 16km. A C/D-band IFF system is also fitted and designated 1RL138. The radar system is highly protected against various types of interference, and can work if there are mountains on the horizon, regardless of the background. [...] The system is able to fire on the move using 30mm cannons, although it must be stationary to fire missiles. The maximum target speed can be up to 500m/s; reaction time 6–8 seconds. Each 2S6 has all facilities for independent warfare.|$|E

5000|$|GPU Boost is a {{new feature}} which is roughly {{analogous}} to turbo boosting of a CPU. The GPU is always guaranteed to run at a minimum clock speed, {{referred to as the}} [...] "base clock". This clock speed is set to the level which will ensure that the GPU stays within TDP specifications, even at maximum loads. When loads are lower, however, there is room for the clock speed to be increased without exceeding the TDP. In these scenarios, GPU Boost will gradually increase the clock speed in steps, until the GPU reaches a predefined <b>power</b> <b>target</b> (which is 170 W by default). By taking this approach, the GPU will ramp its clock up or down dynamically, so that it is providing the maximum amount of speed possible while remaining within TDP specifications.|$|E

Target images were viewed at various sizes to confirm/refute the original hypothesis. The USAF targets demonstrated adequate control of experimental variables. The RIT and Granger characters both revealed the existence of one or more factors in addition to difference spectra which significantly contribute to target identification. It is conjectured that boundary effects may be that important contributor to image identification...|$|E

Will this Target Model resist the integration of massive renewables Could the EU easily develop a new Target Model to integrate massive renewables?

Post-acquisition activities include several dimensions of business restructuring, resource redeployment, and creation of integration mechanisms.
