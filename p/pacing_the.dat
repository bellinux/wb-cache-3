5|$|Fernández's {{rookie season}} has been {{considered}} historic as his 4.2 Wins Above Replacement places him in the Top 10 player seasons among those under 21 years old since 1900. Fernández's Adjusted ERA+ of 174 on the season also places him in the Top 10 all-time for pitchers {{under the age of}} 21, and he is only the fourth pitcher to record this feat in the past 100 years. His strikeout rate is the highest in his league, <b>pacing</b> <b>the</b> National League at 9.81 strikeouts per nine innings.|$|E
5|$|The {{series was}} {{originally}} written in six parts, but Davies excised {{a large portion}} of the fifth episode because the crew expressed concerns with its <b>pacing.</b> <b>The</b> series was filmed in late 2003 under the direction of Sheree Folkson and Tim Whitby, and utilised many areas of Swansea that Davies was familiar with since his childhood. It aired as four-hour-long episodes and a ninety-minute finale on Thursday nights preceding Christmas 2003. Eventually, Mine All Mine would be his least successful series and ended its run with just over two million viewers, which he later blamed on the series' high eccentricity.|$|E

25|$|The {{cycle is}} a work of {{extraordinary}} scale. Perhaps the most outstanding facet of the monumental work is its sheer length: a full performance of the cycle takes place over four nights at the opera, with a total playing time of about 15 hours, depending on the conductor's <b>pacing.</b> <b>The</b> first and shortest work, Das Rheingold, typically lasts two and a half hours, while the final and longest, Götterdämmerung, takes up to five hours, excluding intervals.|$|E

However, both of those losses came at the hands of their opponents in the AFC Championship Game, the Tennessee Titans. The Titans would prove up to the task of beating their {{division}} rival once again as the Titans scored a resounding 33–14 victory. The Titans advanced to their first Super Bowl in team history by forcing six turnovers and a safety.|$|E

25|$|Pacemaker {{syndrome}} {{was first}} described in 1969 by Mitsui et al. {{as a collection}} of symptoms associated with right ventricular <b>pacing.</b> <b>The</b> name pacemaker syndrome was first coined by Erbel in 1979. Since its first discovery, there have been many definitions of pacemaker syndrome, and the understanding of the cause of pacemaker syndrome is still under investigation. In a general sense, pacemaker syndrome can be defined as the symptoms associated with right ventricular pacing relieved with the return of A-V and V-V synchrony.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 16th century maps were rare and often inaccurate. Leonardo {{produced}} several extremely accurate maps {{such as the}} town plan of Imola created in 1502 {{in order to win}} the patronage of Cesare Borgia. Borgia was so impressed that he hired him as a military engineer and architect. Leonardo also produced a map of Chiana Valley in Tuscany, which he surveyed, without the benefit of modern equipment, by <b>pacing</b> <b>the</b> distances. In 1515, Leonardo produced a map of the Roman Southern Coast which is linked to his work for the Vatican and relates to his plans to drain the marshland.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} round of interleague play, the Phillies faced the Red Sox for the second time. In the first two games, the Phillies allowed 22 runs in 12–2 and 10–2 losses; Moyer and Blanton, as the {{starting}} pitchers, became the fourth set of pitchers in franchise history to allow eight or more earned runs in the first three innings of consecutive games, and the first pair since 1895. Philadelphia took the final game of the series to collect their second interleague win of the season, defeating Boston, 5–3, behind a four-run inning by the Phillie offense. In a rematch of both the 1950 World Series and the previous season's Fall Classic, the Phillies traveled north to face the New York Yankees for a three-game series beginning on June 16; they were defeated in the series opener, 8–3, although Halladay, who started the game, had been 18–6 with a 2.84 earned run average against the Yankees in his career. Howard and Werth hit the first back-to-back home runs on the season for the Phillies in the second game of the series to back Moyer's 275th career victory on the 24th anniversary of his first major league start and win, and Philadelphia took the rubber game, 7–1, to close out the series. In the series opener against the Minnesota Twins, Howard had four hits in four at-bats, finishing a single short of the cycle and <b>pacing</b> <b>the</b> Phillies offense with two solo home runs, a triple, and a double as Philadelphia won, 9–5. The offense continued in the second game, as the Phillies hit four home runs and entered the ninth inning leading 9–4, but Lidge blew his first save of the season to send the game to extra innings and the Twins won, 13–10, in the 11th frame. The Twins took the final game and the series victory on June 20 behind a complete game from Carl Pavano; although both pitchers finished the game with identical 8–6 records, it was Halladay's third consecutive loss.|$|E

Club gave the episode a C, and wrote that [...] "the biggest {{problems}} here are the lack of focus and the chaotic <b>pacing.</b> <b>The</b> episode rumbles along in first gear for about three-quarters of its running time and then abruptly shifts into high gear at the end, moving toward an apocalyptic finish that doesn't feel wholly earned.

500|$|Haunting Ground {{received}} [...] "mixed or average" [...] reviews per ratings aggregator Metacritic. Critics {{were quick}} {{to compare it to}} the Clock Tower series, specifically its 2002 installment, Clock Tower 3 (2002). The defenseless heroine elements and hide-and-chase gameplay were found to be highly derivative of the former titles. The dog companion was, for some, a well-received addition to the gameplay formula, with Eurogamer's Kristan Reed comparing it positively to Ico. Others found the dog and other gameplay elements to be repetitive and contributors to poor <b>pacing.</b> <b>The</b> graphics, cinematics, and atmosphere were universally praised. The staff at 1UP.com described the environments as [...] "some of the most detailed, lavish 3D environments Capcom has ever produced." [...] Kill Screen's Zach Budgor compared Haunting Ground's [...] "psychological landscape" [...] to Dario Argento's film Suspiria (1977) and also highlighted its grotesque expressionism. Despite these highlights, critics ultimately felt that Haunting Ground was too predictable and relied heavily on clichés previously established in the horror genre. For this reason, Reed said it [...] "becomes stifled by its own eventual lack of ambition to break away from the norms instilled by two generations of Japanese horror adventures." [...] The staff at 1UP.com felt the game was dated when compared with the recently released Resident Evil 4 (2005), but said, [...] "Haunting Ground isn't without merit, it's just that the merits are buried deep in an occasionally thrilling, mostly 'been there, done that' game of indistinct origin." ...|$|E
