Tony, even as he states his intentions against it, rouses the mob to avenge Zulfiqars murder. The conspirators go into hiding, but one by one Markaz, Tony and Laltu finds and kills Tribhuban, Shishir Tili, and Kaushiks twin brother (whom they mistake for Kaushik). Basheer reveals that his beloved wife <b>Pariza</b> Khan (June Maliah) had committed suicide under the stress of his absence after which the conspirators prepare for a gang war against the loyalists. That night, Zulfiqars ghost appears to Basheer and tell him, he too will know everything when the right time comes and then once more the ghost will appear. Skirmishes and shootouts occur between the loyalists and the conspirators, in which Pavel, Mithilesh and Qasim is killed. Danish is shot during another shootout, and before his last breath he whispers something to Basheer. Kashinath inadvertently reveals his conspiracy against Zulfiqar to Basheer, the faking of the photographs and how he brainwashed Basheer into killing his best friend, after which Basheer informs him what Danish told him in his last moments- Kashinath is the illegitimate brother of <b>Pariza.</b> Now both of them indulges in a hand-to-hand combat, which ends when they kill each other. With his dying breath, Basheer again sees the ghost of Zulfiqar, as promised before.|$|E

40|$|Permanent {{attention}} of both dairy industry and nutritionists {{has been paid}} to milk fat composition. Fatty acids (FAs) are the most important compo-nents of lipids (Velíšek, 1999) and thus research dealing with milk fat has been focused mainly on fatty acid content and composition. Milk fat can contain up to 400 different FAs. About seventy acids can be identified by usual ana-lytical procedures (Collomb et al., 2002 a). However, a high number of them is present at very low and negligible amounts. Thus, usually only 20 – 30 FAs are determined in milk fat using a gas chromatog-raphy analytical procedure. Their contents range from several tenths to tens per cent out of total FA content. However, current research results show that the evaluation of milk fat only according to the pro-portion of saturated (SAFAs), monounsaturated (MUFAs) and polyunsaturated (PUFAs) acids is not satisfactory. Mainly the results concerning biologically active isomers of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) present in milk fat at elevated concen-trations (<b>Pariza</b> et al., 1999) and information on different nutritional properties of FAs (Legrand, 2002) require to study milk fat FA composition in greater detail. Under these circumstances, more detailed knowledge of factors affecting FA com-position is necessary. The most important factors are nutrition, season and breed. Appropriate supplements and correc-tions of feed rations can increase the proportion of unsaturated FAs and decrease the SAFA level at the same time (Jenkins, 1999; Komprda et al., 2000; Delbecchi et al., 2001; DePeters et al., 2001).

40|$|Conjugated {{linoleic}} acid (CLA) {{is the only}} fatty acid shown definitively to inhibit carcinogenesis in experimental animals (Lee et al., 2005). It is found predominantly in food products from ruminant animals, especially in milk products (Chin et al., 1992). Besides the anticarcinogenic property, CLA also enhances the immune response, increases the feed efficiency and reduces the body fat (Tricon et al., 2005). Recently, {{it has been reported}} that each CLA isomer may have a different pharmacological effect. For example, cis- 9, trans- 11 CLA is prima-rily responsible for the inhibition of the growth of human cancer cells (Ip et al., 1999), while cis- 12, trans- 10 CLA apparently regulates fatty acid me-tabolism (<b>Pariza</b> et al., 2001). Milk fatty acids are altered by many factors, such as breed (Pešek et al., 2005). However, changing the dietary fat source is the most important factor to in-fluence milk fatty acids, especially the concentration of CLA in milk fat, remarkably. The concentration of CLA in milk fat could be significantly enhanced by the addition to the diet of vegetable oilseeds or oils which are rich in C 18 unsaturated fatty acids (Komprda et al., 2001; Peterson et al., 2002; Ward et al., 2002), especially oils or oilseeds high in {{linoleic acid}} (Chouinard et al., 2001; Collomb et al., 2004). An increase in the proportions of C 18 unsaturated fatty acids in diets can improve the concentration of vaccenic acid (VA) in the rumen. After VA is absorbed by the tissue, CLA will be synthesized in Effect of dietary sources of roasted oilseeds on blood parameters and milk fatty acid compositio...|$|E
40|$|Nakon povratka iz <b>Pariza,</b> Ivan Merz odmah se angažirao u Hrvatskome katoličkom pokretu (HKP), s čijim se programom upoznao još za vrijeme svoga boravka na Vojnoj akademiji u Bečkome Novom Mjestu i studija u Beču i Parizu. Merz je znao da je HKP dijelom politiziran. Stoga je čvrsto odlučio da će raditi na njegovoj depolitizaciji. Njegova je prvotna zasluga što je kao suutemeljitelj Hrvatskoga orlovskoga saveza u tu organizaciju uveo načela Katoličke akcije (KA). Iako se zbog svojih ideja izravno sukobio s Hrvatskim katoličkim senioratom, Merz nije odustao od načela Katoličke akcije. Štoviše, želio je da nakon Hrvatskoga orlovskog saveza i druge omladinske i studentske organizacije budu postavljene na istim načelima. Autor na temelju arhivske građe analizira koja je bila stvarna uloga blaženog Ivana Merza u ključnom razdoblju od 1923. do prvih sukoba sa Senioratom. Confl ict between Croatian Catholic Seniority (CCS) and Croatian Eagle Association (CEA) did not cease {{even after}} {{numerous}} meetings, round tables and Bishops conference interventions. Croatian Catholic Seniority (CCS) {{from the very}} beginning set itself as an exclusive organization which wants to control and supervise everything. Even though Croatian Eagle Association (CEA) at the beginning enjoyed Seniority’s trust, fi rst friction appeared already in 1924 when Seniority realized that it {{will not be able to}} implement its ideas and programs through CEA. Ivan Merz constantly encouraged religious goals and ideas of Catholic Action (CA) and stressed the dependence of CEA on the church hierarchy without the mediation of the Seniority. The basis for his views Merz found in Papal encyclicals, documents of the Holly See and professional literature which he thoroughly studied. Already then the Seniority appeared with the theses about ’violent introduction of Italian Catholic Action (CA) ’ among the catholic organizations. It was an artifi cially created thesis for the purpose of accusing Merz and CEA leadership that Italian CA is unnecessary and even harmful for Croatian Catholic youth. Real reason was the incapacity of CCS to implement within CA political part of Croatian Catholic Movement (CCM) realized in Croatian Popular Party (CPP). Merz in his public appearances stated that political and social-economic part of CCM have no connection with CA. The fi rst confl ict that seriously damaged the illusion of unity, happened by mid- 1924 on the occasion of publishing of Croatian edition of ’Golden book’, edited by Ivan Merz. The Seniority without warning cut out Merz’s ’Introduction’, what additionally caused high feelings. Whole year 1926 and up to the year 1928 were marked by confl ict between CCM – CEA. Dr. Dragutin Kniewald, Merz’s contemporary describing the state in current Croatian Catholic Movement (CCM) stated that the matter was precisely about will the leadership of CA organization be in principle and in fact in the hands of local bishop and will the organization of CA be practically independent from every party or political infl uence. According to Merz, CA should be led by bishops, each in his bishopric, and as such it should be out of and above all political parties. Naturally, that did not mean that Church prevents Catholics to organize themselves in a political party which program was not in collision with CA. After Merz’s death, the Seniority wanted to create the impression in public that his opinion was that every catholic by his conscience is obliged to vote for CPP. Facts speak in favor of Merz, who not only was against the attempts of politicization of CA but also constantly worked on depoliticization of CCM organizations because his opinion was that political parties should act autonomously but outside of catholic organizations...|$|E
40|$|U svojoj korespondenciji braća Antun i Mihovil Vrančić u nekoliko su se prilika poslužili kodiranim porukama: Antun u jednom pismu s diplomatske misije iz <b>Pariza</b> 1546, a Mihovil dvanaest godina poslije u četirima pismima iz Šibenika. Tijekom istraživanja provedenog za potrebe ovoga rada ustanovljeno je da jedno od pisama dosada nije bilo poznato. Mihovilov sustav znakova uspjeli smo dešifrirati usporedbom učestalosti znakova u kodiranim odlomcima s učestalošću slova u latinskim dijelovima pisama. Većina je slova preuzeta iz latinice, samo im je promijenjena vrijednost, pri čemu je imala utjecaja, čini se, knjiga Polygraphia onodobnoga njemačkog kriptografa Ioannesa Trithemiusa. Usto je dodano nekoliko arapskih znamenki i znakova iz drugih pisama. Glavnina skrivena sadržaja odnosi se na ulaganja u nekretnine i unosne poslove, te je svrha tajnog pisma očigledno bila onemogućiti konkurenciju da preduhitri Antuna i Mihovila, u trenutku kad je Antun bio nagrađen od cara Ferdinanda nakon četverogodišnjeg poslanstva u Turskoj. U dvjema pak porukama Mihovil upozorava brata na opasnost od dvojice braće s vrlo lošom moralnom reputacijom. Antunov odlomak ostao je neriješen, jer se poslužio drugačijim sustavom, a sam tekst je prekratak, tako da izračun frekvencije ne pomaže. Spending {{the whole}} of his working career in Hungary, Antun Vrančić (1504 ¬ 1573) climbed to {{the very top of}} the ecclesiastical and {{political}} ladder. For the sake of his office, but still more so in consequence of his humanist education and beliefs, as well as family affections, he was constantly in touch by letter with a wide circle of people. Today about eight hundred of his letters are known. The whole of this time, the person and associate closest to him was his younger brother Mihovil (1507 - 1571), also a humanist and writer. The epistolary communication between the two spanned more than thirty years. Writing to his brother from Paris, where in 1546 he was envoy of the Queen of Transylvania, Isabella, Antun inserted not quite two lines of coded writing, in a paragraph where he is talking about being well received at the court of France, and hoping to complete his assignment soon. What this success was to consist of, he did not write in Latin script, but in a mixture of characters. Information concerning this appeared before the scholarly public some ten years ago, in an article about the unpublished Vrančić family papers kept in the National and University Library in Zagreb. Mihovil also coded several fragments in four of his letters sent at the end of 1558 and the beginning of 1559 from Šibenik to his brother in Hungary. Information about three of them is found in three editorial notes (in Hungarian) alongside the letters of Mihovil published in the mid- 19 th century in the collected works of Antun Vrančić (Verancsics Antal Ősszes munkái) as part of the series Monumenta Hungariae Historica of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. In the actual text of the letters, lacunae were left in the places of the coded messages. The fourth letter was unknown to the editors. That is what we realised when we obtained from Budapest photographs of the autographs, on which it too was to be found. When it appeared that the secret script was not a simple replacement of the Latin alphabet with Bosančica, or Croatian Cyrillic, it was necessary to approach the decoding more systematically. We first selected Mihovil’s messages, as being incomparably longer and providing more to analyse. Three factors were essential. First character frequency scales were made: in the coded text, in the Latin part of the letters, and in an extant prayer of Antun Vrančić in Croatian. It turned out that the coded and Latin parts were close to each other, and at the same time distant from the Croatian text. It was fairly certain that Latin was hidden in the secret messages. The final confirmation came when we became aware of the fact that in the Latin there was a (semi-) obligatory combination of the characters q and u, where the first regularly appeared with the second, but the second also appeared on its own. We discovered that in the coded part of the text a similar (semi-) obligation existed. The last factor that led to the code being broken was the comparison of the frequency of geminates in the coded and in the Latin text. On the basis of the assumed probable letter values, we were able to read the first word – possessio. It contains two identical geminates, which also made the identification easy. The rest went relatively easily and quickly. The basic stock of characters is taken from Latin script, only shifted to the left or right more or fewer places. Some Latin symbols are replaced with Arabic figures, and a negligible number probably come from the Greek and Bosančica scripts. The biggest influence there might be is visible in the fact that the Latin letter values of almost a third of Mihovil’s signs coincide with the values in the book Libri polygraphiae VI of the German cryptographer Ioannes Trithemius. Most of the concealed content relates to investment in real estate and profitable business deals. Mihovil is on the whole informing his brother about good deals to be had on the land and housing market in Šibenik and surroundings, and of his negotiations with the vendors. The objective of the secret script was clearlyto stop the competition forestalling the entrepreneurial brothers, at the time when Antun had been rewarded by Emperor Ferdinand with the office of bishop of Eger after his four-year period as envoy in Turkey, after which his income must have risen considerably. In two messages Mihovil warned his brother of the danger of two other brothers with very poor reputations for morality. To our surprise, Mihovil’s system did not assist us in deciphering those two lines in code of Antun’s. Clearly the system had changed in the meantime, or each one of brothers had his own. The text itself is too short for the calculation of frequency to help. Accordingly, this mysterious fragment about the expected success at the French court remains unsolved...|$|E
