The absorption of WGR by the Sun was found to change {{at the moment when}} the Sun appears in the slide <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> <b>gravitation</b> proton resonance (SPGPR, plane going through the Earth rotating axis and the sample place on the Earth surface). There were analyzed the signals of the gravitation Sun (GS), Mercury and Moon. GS contains signals of the corona, nucleus and sub-nucleus. Here the nature of the last one is near to the matter of “naked” protons in hydrogen bonds (HB) of the sensor with which it interacts. The proton model as analogous to the black hole has been proved ex-perimentally. The sub-nucleus was concluded to be of quarks’ nature but the nucleus of neutrons’ one. The GR velocity in the sun system has been determined experimentally additionally, the influence of gas giants (GG) on it. At the moment of Sun and GG opposition the GR velocity was 2 - 8 times higher than that one of the light. GG reduced the GR velocity {{in the direction of the}} Sun. The role of the Earth as a gravitation mir-ror has been supported. Six gravitation resonator signals from Moon gravitation shots (gravitation laser) were analyzed. The GR of planets was observed to influence the energy of water cluster ensembles...|$|E
