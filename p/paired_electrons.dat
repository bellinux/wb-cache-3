The net magnetic moment of an atom is equal to the vector sum of orbital and spin magnetic moments of all electrons and the nucleus.

50|$|In chemistry, a lone pair {{refers to}} a <b>pair</b> of valence <b>electrons</b> that are not shared with another atom and is {{sometimes}} called a non-bonding pair.

50|$|Quadruple {{bonds between}} atoms of main group {{elements}} are unknown. Molecular orbital theory {{shows that there}} are two sets of <b>paired</b> <b>electrons</b> in the sigma system (one bonding, one antibonding), and two sets of <b>paired</b> <b>electrons</b> in a degenerate π-bonding set of orbitals. This adds up to give a bond order of 2, meaning that there exists a double bond between the two carbons in a dicarbon (C2) molecule. The molecular orbital diagram of diatomic carbon would show {{that there are two}} pi bonds and no sigma bonds. However, a recent paper by S.

5000|$|... this {{suggests}} {{a type of}} situation where some kind of binding energy exists but it is gradually weakened as the critical temperature is approached.

50|$|In chemistry, a {{class of}} {{electron}} acceptors that acquire not just one, but a set of two <b>paired</b> <b>electrons</b> that form a covalent bond with an electron donor molecule, {{is known as a}} Lewis acid.

5000|$|In {{classical}} Lewis structures, molecular oxygen, O2, {{is depicted}} as having a double bond between the two oxygen atoms. However, the molecular orbitals of O2 are actually more complex than Lewis structures seem to suggest. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of O2 [...] {{is a pair of}} degenerate antibonding π orbitals, π2px* and π2py*, which are both singly occupied by spin <b>paired</b> <b>electrons.</b> These electrons are the cause of O2 being a triplet diradical in the ground state (indicated as 3O2).|$|E

It can be shown that the lowest state for the two electrons is a spin singlet state, i. e. EPR sate.

50|$|The {{electrons}} {{in a pair}} are not necessarily close together; because the interaction is long range, <b>paired</b> <b>electrons</b> may still be many hundreds of nanometers apart. This distance is usually greater than the average interelectron distance, so many Cooper pairs can occupy the same space. Electrons have spin-, so they are fermions, but the total spin of a Cooper pair is integer (0 or 1) {{so it is a}} composite boson.

The lone <b>electron</b> <b>pair</b> is represented in this article by a two dots above or next to the N. The water solubility of simple amines is enhanced by hydrogen bonding involving these lone <b>electron</b> <b>pairs.</b> Typically salts of ammonium compounds exhibit the following order of solubility in water: primary ammonium (...) > secondary ammonium (...) > tertiary ammonium (R3NH+). Small aliphatic amines display significant solubility in many solvents, whereas those with large substituents are lipophilic.

40|$|Fluorinated {{stationary}} phase in Rtx- 200 MS column have {{been characterized by}} determination of system constants of Abraham equation. Retention on this phase is driven by dispersive and orientation/induction forces. Significant interaction contribution of lone <b>pair</b> <b>electrons</b> or π- electrons provides unique selectivity for analytes with excess of electron density. Unusual behavior of this phase have been determined by study of separation mechanism of polar and nonpolar analytes, in comparison of their separation on polar and nonpolar phases. This behavior is due to medium polarity of the phase (system constant s), which is not so pronounced to cancel separation of nonpolar analytes due to induction forces.

50|$|The barrelene {{rearrangement}} is now presented. It is a {{bit more}} complex than the Mariano and Pratt examples since there are two sp3-hybridized (i.e. methane) carbons. Each such bridgehead carbon has three (ethylenic) pi bonds while two are needed for the di-pi-methane rearrangement. Another difference is that the barrelene reaction requires the triplet excited state while the Mariano and Pratt acyclic dienes used the excited singlet. Thus acetone is used in the barrelene reaction; acetone captures the light and then delivers triplet excitation to the barrelene reactant. In the final step of the rearrangement there is a spin-flip, termed intersystem-crossing (ISC) to provide <b>paired</b> <b>electrons</b> and a new sigma bond.|$|E
50|$|In chemistry, an {{unpaired}} electron is an electron that occupies an orbital of an atom singly, {{rather than as}} part of an electron pair (<b>paired</b> <b>electrons</b> means all two spin states of the orbital specified by three quantum numbers n, l and m are fully occupied by two electrons). As the formation of electron pairs is often energetically favourable, either {{in the form of a}} chemical bond or as a lone pair, {{unpaired electron}}s are relatively uncommon in chemistry, because an entity that carries an unpaired electron is usually rather reactive. In organic chemistry they typically only occur briefly during a reaction on an entity called a radical; however, they play an important role in explaining reaction pathways.|$|E
50|$|Electronic {{spin state}} at it {{simplest}} describes {{the number of}} unpaired electrons in a molecule. Most molecules including the proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids {{that make up the}} majority of life have no unpaired electrons even when charged. Such molecules are called singlet molecules, since their <b>paired</b> <b>electrons</b> have only one spin state. In contrast, dioxygen under ambient conditions has two unpaired electrons. Dioxygen is a triplet molecule, since the two unpaired electrons allow for three spin states. The reaction of a triplet molecule with a singlet molecule is spin-forbidden in quantum mechanics. This is the major reasons there is a very high reaction barrier for the extremely thermodynamically favorable reaction of singlet organic molecules with triplet oxygen. This kinetic barrier prevents life from bursting into flames at room temperature.|$|E

5000|$|However, the {{necessity}} of reduction of Z by a number close to 1 for these K-alpha lines in heavier elements (aluminum and above) was derived completely empirically by Moseley, and was not discussed by his papers in theoretical terms, since the concept of atomic shells with <b>paired</b> <b>electrons</b> was not well established in 1913 (this would not be proposed until about 1920), {{and in particular the}} Schrödinger atomic orbitals, including the 1s orbital with only 2 electrons, would not be formally introduced and completely understood, until 1926. At the time Moseley was puzzling over his Z−1 term with Bohr, Bohr thought that the inner shell of electrons in elements might contain at least 4 and often 6 electrons. Moseley for a time considered that this K lines resulted from a simultaneous transition of 4 electrons at once from the L to K shells of atoms, but did not commit himself on this point in his papers.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Currently {{there is}} a common belief that the {{explanation}} of superconductivity phenomenon lies in understanding the mechanism of the formation of electron pairs. <b>Paired</b> <b>electrons,</b> however, cannot form a superconducting condensate spontaneously. These <b>paired</b> <b>electrons</b> perform disorderly zero-point oscillations and there are no force of attraction in their ensemble. In order to create a unified ensemble of par-ticles, the pairs must order their zero-point fluctuations so that an attraction between the particles appears. As a result of this ordering of zero-point oscillations in the electron gas, superconductivity arises. This model of condensation of zero-point oscillations creates the possibility of being able to obtain estimates for the crit-ical parameters of elementary superconductors, which are in satisfactory agreement with the measured data. On the another hand, the phenomenon of superfluidity in He- 4 and He- 3 can be similarly explained, due to the ordering of zero-point fluctuations. It is therefore established that both related phenomena are based on the same physical mechanism...|$|E
50|$|Phosphine oxides feature {{tetrahedral}} phosphorus centers. The P-O bond {{is short}} and polar.
