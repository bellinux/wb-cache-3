40|$|In {{a recent}} <b>paper</b> <b>DDL</b> 10 we studied basic {{properties}} of partial immersions and partially free maps, a generalization of free maps introduced first by Gromov in Gro 70. In this short note we show {{how to build}} partially free maps out of partial immersions and use this fact {{to prove that the}} partially free maps in critical dimension introduced in Theorems 1. 1 - 1. 3 of DDL 10 for three important types of distributions can actually be built out of partial immersions. Finally, we show that the canonical contact structure on ^ 2 n+ 1 admits partial immersions in critical dimension for every n.

40|$|Two {{techniques}} are examined for teaching 10 Phrasal Verbs (PVs) to {{two groups of}} university students: dictionary presentation and concordance-based Data-Driven Learning (DDL). After checking their prior knowledge, 5 PVs were introduced via DDL, 5 via dictionary entries. The two techniques were compared, {{as well as the}} two groups of students, towards an assessment of DDL as a motivating and effective teaching aid. The results show that DDL can be a productive way to teach new lexical items and to consolidate old ones. The difference was statistically significant for the group which was smaller in size, more mature and working with corpus samples on screen rather than on <b>paper.</b> <b>DDL,</b> independently of classroom attendance, was a positive aid, whereas dictionary presentation was detrimental for some of the verbs involved...|$|E
40|$|This <b>paper</b> {{describes}} the <b>DDL</b> proposals submitted {{in response to}} the MPEG- 7 Call for Proposals and the results of their evaluation at the MPEG- 7 AHG Test and Evaluation Meeting in Lancaster in February 1999. It also {{describes the}} proposal from DSTC which was considered to provide the best starting point for a DDL and the features from other proposals which were considered to be of value for future consideration and possible integration. It concludes with an overview of {{the current state of the}} MPEG- 7 DDL work. Keywords:MPEG- 7, DDL, Schema, RDF, XML 1...|$|R
40|$|The use of student-centered {{methods in}} {{language}} teaching {{can be an}} alternative to be exerted by teachers in language classrooms. Such methods can create an atmosphere of excitement for the students because they themselves are supposed to discover word meanings, grammatical patterns, parts of speech {{and other aspects of}} language through receiving small tips from the teacher. In the present <b>paper,</b> data-driven learning (<b>DDL)</b> has been introduced as a student-centered technique in which samples of authentic language are taken from linguistic corpora to be presented to language learners for improving language proficiency and then different aspects of this technique have been elaborated on in order to make language teachers and students aware of its features and usefulness...|$|R
