50|$|AppleShare was {{a product}} from Apple Computer which {{implemented}} various network services. Its main purpose was acting as a file server, using the AFP protocol. Other network services implemented in later versions of AppleShare included a print server using the <b>Printer</b> <b>Access</b> Protocol (PAP), web server, electronic mail server, and SMB / CIFS server to support file sharing to Microsoft Windows clients.|$|R
5000|$|An {{operating}} system oriented to computer networking, to allow shared file and <b>printer</b> <b>access</b> among multiple computers in a network, {{to enable the}} sharing of data, users, groups, security, applications, and other networking functions. Typically over a local area network (LAN), or private network. This sense is now largely historical, as common {{operating system}}s generally now have such features included.|$|R
50|$|Some {{examples}} of shareable resources are computer programs, data, storage devices, and printers. E.g. shared file access (also known as disk sharing and folder sharing), shared <b>printer</b> <b>access</b> (<b>printer</b> sharing), shared scanner access, etc. The shared resource {{is called a}} shared disk (also known as mounted disk), shared drive volume, shared folder, shared file, shared document, shared printer or shared scanner.|$|R
30|$|An {{experimental}} paradigm {{comparing the}} effect of laptop multitasking on reading comprehension and task performance cited differential effects (Subrahmanyam et al., 2013). The study comprised of two paradigms. In the first, participants read two passages of low and high difficulty on paper, a laptop, or on a tablet, in a multitasking or non-multitasking condition. Similar to the studies discussed above, neither medium nor multitasking condition affected reading comprehension; however, multitaskers demonstrated markedly reduced efficiency. In the second paradigm, participants synthesized multiple materials and wrote a one-page report. Sources were provided either on paper, {{on a computer screen}} without Internet or <b>printer</b> <b>access,</b> or on a computer screen with Internet and <b>printer</b> <b>access.</b> Source materials produced no differences in report quality or efficiency, despite students reporting a preference for paper sources. However, report quality was significantly improved when participants had sources on a computer without Internet compared to a computer with Internet access. Furthermore, active use of paper for note-taking greatly reduced the negative impact of Internet access.|$|R

50|$|Shared {{file and}} <b>printer</b> <b>access</b> require an {{operating}} {{system on the}} client that supports access to resources on a server, an operating system on the server that supports access to its resources from a client, and an application layer (in the four or five layer TCP/IP reference model) file sharing protocol and transport layer protocol to provide that shared access. Modern operating systems for personal computers include distributed file systems that support file sharing, while hand-held computing devices sometimes require additional software for shared file access.|$|R

50|$|While the Protected Setup model {{works as}} {{intended}}, {{it was intended}} only to simplify {{the connection between the}} access point and the devices that would make use of its services, primarily accessing the Internet. It provides little help within a network - finding and setting up <b>printer</b> <b>access</b> from a computer for instance. To address those roles, a number of different protocols have developed, including Universal Plug and Play (UPnP), Devices Profile for Web Services (DPWS), and Zero Configuration Networking (ZeroConf). These protocols allow devices to seek out other devices within the network, query their capabilities, and provide some level of automatic setup.|$|R
