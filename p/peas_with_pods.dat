40|$|In {{accordance}} with Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, Greece, hereafter {{referred to as}} the evaluating Member State (EMS), received an application from Nisso Chemical Europe GmbH to modify the existing MRLs for the active substance acetamiprid in purslane, legume vegetables and pulses (beans and peas). In order to accommodate the intended uses of acetamiprid, Greece proposed to raise the existing MRLs of acetamiprid from 0. 01 * mg/kg to 3 mg/kg in purslane, from 0. 01 * mg/kg in <b>peas</b> (<b>with</b> <b>pods)</b> and 0. 06 mg/kg in beans (with pods) to 0. 5 mg/kg, from 0. 01 * mg/kg to 0. 05 mg/kg in beans (without pods) and from 0. 05 mg/kg to 0. 1 mg/kg in pulses (dry beans and peas). Greece drafted an evaluation report in {{accordance with}} Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, which was submitted to the European Commission and forwarded to EFSA. According to EFSA the data are sufficient to derive MRL proposals of 0. 15 mg/kg on beans (with pods), 0. 4 mg/kg on <b>peas</b> (<b>with</b> <b>pods),</b> 0. 07 mg/kg on beans (without pods), 0. 15 mg/kg on peas (without pods) and 0. 07 mg/kg on pulses (dry beans and peas); these MRL proposals reflect the intended uses in southern EU only. In addition, a MRL proposal for purslane (3 mg/kg) was derived by extrapolation from trials on lettuce. A deficiency was noted in some trials concerning the storage conditions of the samples prior analysis. Information needs to be provided to confirm that samples were effectively stored under conditions for which integrity of residues is demonstrated. Adequate analytical enforcement methods are available to control the residues of acetamiprid in the commodities under consideration at the validated LOQ of 0. 01 mg/kg. Based on the risk assessment results, EFSA concludes that the proposed uses will not result in a consumer exposure exceeding the toxicological reference values...|$|E
40|$|The {{theme of}} this work is the {{examining}} {{of one of the}} key genetic principles in domestication traits in pea pod dehiscence. First, this work was preceded by the employment of the method called MACE (Massive Analysis of cDNA Ends). The method analyzed the mRNA which was isolated from pod sutures. The two parental lines were used JI 64 (Pisum sativum ssp. elatius L.) wild field <b>pea</b> <b>with</b> dehiscent <b>pods,</b> JI 92 (Pisum sativum ssp. sativum L.) landrace <b>with</b> indehiscent <b>pods</b> and RILs (Recombinant inbred lines) of reciprocal hybridization of both. As a result of the MACE analysis ten million reads were generated and seven thousand genes were identified only seventy seven genes differed with statistical significance in the samples with dehiscent and indehiscent pods. For the purpose of this work only three of them were used. Expression of these three candidate genes were assigned using Real-Time qRT-PCR for pod dehiscence. Base on qRT-PCR process the Ct values were calculated. The result of this work is the graphical view of expression volume of these candidate genes for both field pea lines during pod maturation...|$|R

40|$|Infection of {{immature}} <b>pea</b> <b>pods</b> <b>with</b> Fusarium solani f. sp. phaseoli (a non-pathogen of peas) or f. sp. pisi (a pea pathogen) {{resulted in}} induction of chitinase and β- 1, 3 -glucanase. Within 30 hours, {{activities of the}} two enzymes increased 9 -fold and 4 -fold, respectively. Chitinase and β- 1, 3 -glucanase were also induced by autoclaved spores of the two F. solani strains and by the known elicitors of phytoalexins in pea pods, cadmium ions, actinomycin D, and chitosan. Furthermore, exogenously applied ethylene caused an increase of chitinase and β- 1, 3 -glucanase in uninfected pods. Fungal infection or treatment with elicitors strongly increased ethylene production by immature pea pods. Infected or elicitor-treated <b>pea</b> <b>pods</b> were incubated <b>with</b> aminoethoxyvinylglycine, a specific inhibitor of ethylene biosynthesis. This lowered stress ethylene production to or {{below the level of}} uninfected controls; however, chitinase and β- 1, 3 -glucanase were still strongly induced. It is concluded that ethylene and fungal infection or elicitors are separate, independent signals for the induction of chitinase and β- 1, 3 -glucanase...|$|R
40|$|Crop traits {{can alter}} {{economically}} important interactions between plants, pests, and biological control agents. For example, a reduced waxy bloom {{on the surface}} of pea plants alters interactions between pea aphids and their natural enemies. In this study, we assess whether the effect of wax reduction extends beyond the 2 or 3 arthropod species closely associated with the plants and into the structure of the broader arthropod community of over 200 taxa at our site. We sampled arthropods on lines of <b>peas</b> <b>with</b> normal and reduced wax in Latah Co., Idaho using pitfall traps within randomly assigned pairs of 5 × 5 meter plots. During the 1998 and 1999 growing seasons, we collected 12, 113 individual arthropods from 221 unambiguously identified morphospecies. The number of individuals collected from each morphospecies responded idiosyncratically to the reduced wax peas. To test whether arthropod community structure differed between the collections from plots having <b>peas</b> <b>with</b> normal or reduced wax, we performed a randomization test. The collection from <b>peas</b> <b>with</b> reduced wax had higher species evenness and thus higher community diversity despite having lower species richness. Our results demonstrate the potential of a single plant trait, epicuticular wax, to affect a community of arthropods. Two pests of peas had opposite responses to <b>peas</b> <b>with</b> reduced wax. The number of pea aphids collected was greater from <b>peas</b> <b>with</b> normal wax <b>peas</b> than those <b>with</b> reduced wax. In contrast, the number of pea leaf weevils collected was greater from <b>peas</b> <b>with</b> reduced wax...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Prediction {{equations}} {{are commonly}} used to estimate body fat from anthropometric measurements, but are population specific. We aimed to establish and validate a body composition prediction formula for Asian newborns, and compared the performance of this formula {{with that of a}} published equation. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Among 262 neonates (174 from day 0, 88 from days 1 - 3 post delivery) from a prospective cohort study, body composition was measured using air-displacement plethysmography (<b>PEA</b> <b>POD),</b> <b>with</b> standard anthropometric measurements, including triceps and subscapular skinfolds. Using fat mass measurement by PEA POD as a reference, stepwise linear regression was utilized to develop a prediction equation in a randomly selected subgroup of 62 infants measured on days 1 - 3, which was then validated in another subgroup of 200 infants measured on days 0 - 3. RESULTS: Regression analyses revealed subscapular skinfolds, weight, gender and gestational age were significant predictors of neonatal fat mass, explaining 81. 1 % of the variance, but not triceps skinfold or ethnicity. By Bland-Altman analyses, our prediction equation revealed a non-significant bias with limits of agreement (LOA) similar to those of a published equation for infants measured on days 1 - 3 (95 % LOA: (- 0. 25, 0. 26) ?kg vs (- 0. 23, 0. 21) ?kg) and on day 0 (95 % LOA: (- 0. 19, 0. 17) ?kg vs (- 0. 17, 0. 18) ?kg). The published equation, however, exhibited a systematic bias in our sample. CONCLUSIONS: Our equation requires only one skinfold site measurement, which can significantly reduce time and effort. It does not require the input of ethnicity and, thus, aid its application to other Asian neonatal populations...|$|R
