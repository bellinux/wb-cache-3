5|$|The Black Death {{epidemic}} {{first arrived}} in England in 1348, re-occurring in waves during 1360–62, 1368–69, 1375 and more sporadically thereafter. The most immediate economic impact of this disaster was the widespread loss of life, between around 27% mortality amongst the upper classes, to 40–70% amongst the peasantry. Despite the very high loss of life, few settlements were abandoned during the epidemic itself, but many were badly affected or nearly eliminated altogether. The medieval authorities {{did their best to}} respond in an organised fashion, but the economic disruption was immense. Building work ceased and many mining operations <b>paused.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> short term, efforts were taken by the authorities to control wages and enforce pre-epidemic working conditions. Coming on top of the previous years of famine, however, the longer-term economic implications were profound. In contrast to the previous centuries of rapid growth, the English population would not begin to recover for over a century, despite the many positive reasons for a resurgence. The crisis would dramatically affect English agriculture, wages and prices {{for the remainder of the}} medieval period.|$|E
5|$|Club {{competition}} <b>paused</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{last week}} of March, resuming over the first weekend of April. Benfica's first game was a visit to nearby Estádio da Reboleira to meet Estrela da Amadora. Referee Hugo Miguel called three penalties {{in the first half}}-hour: two for Benfica and one for Estrela. Cardozo converted both (in the fifth and 16th minutes), and Silvestre Varela scored for Estrela in a 2–1 final result. Sánchez Flores said that although Benfica played poorly, winning was what mattered. On 11 April, Benfica hosted Académica in another home loss; a 23rd-minute goal by William Tiero secured Académica's second consecutive away win against Benfica. The loss ended any hope of winning the title, since Porto had an eight-point lead. The race for second place (and a UEFA Champions League spot) also experienced a setback, since Sporting now had a four-point lead. The fans turned on Sánchez Flores, waving white handkerchiefs in the traditional request for resignation. The Spaniard realised that winning the Primeira Liga was nearly impossible, and Benfica should focus on qualifying for the Champions League. The club rebounded with an away win against Vitória de Setúbal. They started strong, scoring three goals in the first half for a final score of 4–0. Cardozo and Nuno Gomes scored two goals apiece. A week after Setúbal, Benfica hosted Marítimo for April's final match. By the 38th minute, the club was winning 3–0. Marítimo reacted, cutting Benfica's lead to 3–2 in the 60th minute, but the club defended their lead. Although Sánchez Flores was happy with the three points, he said that Benfica should have better controlled the game.|$|E

25|$|On 23 April 1945, John W. Brown left in convoy with {{a load of}} U.S. Army {{general cargo}} below and trucks lashed to her decks to begin her seventh voyage. The convoy {{encountered}} bad weather but no enemy forces while crossing the North Atlantic and arrived off The Downs on the southeast coast of England on V-E Day, 8 May 1945. She then proceeded to Antwerp, Belgium, where she discharged her cargo. Departing on 19 May, she arrived at Le Havre, France, on 22 May. There she embarked 31 U.S. Army officers and 321 U.S. Army enlisted men, some of them liberated prisoners-of-war, and departed on 24 May. She <b>paused</b> <b>in</b> <b>The</b> Solent for two days, then got back underway on 27 May in convoy for the United States, the convoy burning its running lights at night {{for the first time}} since the beginning of the war. The convoy arrived at New York on 11 June 1945.|$|E
500|$|Lindwall {{returned}} for a new spell and almost hit Washbrook in the head. After tea, Edrich hit Miller for four. Although Lindwall did not retaliate for the bouncers he received in the first innings, Miller did so with four consecutive short balls, earning the ire of the crowd. Miller struck Edrich on the body before Bradman intervened, ordered him to stop, and apologised to Edrich. Edrich and Washbrook settled and put together a 124-run partnership in only 138 minutes, England's largest of the series to that point. Edrich hit a four to long on, followed by a lofted off drive for six from the bowling of Toshack, generating momentum in their favour. However, Washbrook called Edrich through for a quick single soon after. The batsmen hesitated and after both Englishmen had <b>paused</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle of their run, Morris threw down Edrich's stumps from cover, ending the partnership at 125/2. Edrich had struck eight boundaries and a six in his 53.|$|E
2500|$|Nothing {{published}} {{during the}} war made half the sensation that did this prophetic volume, whose predictions were so wonderfully accurate that {{very few of them}} were found to have proved false {{at the end of the}} dark contest, dark not only because beginning to be so doubtful, and laden with sorrow, and suffering, and loss, but because, although the North shone in the light of a glorious resolve, and the South contended for principle, the struggle was still one between brothers. The newspapers of the day were full of reviews and notices, eulogistic and otherwise, according to the party represented. The book revived courage and rekindled hope.

40|$|A recent {{controversy}} has emerged concerning {{the existence of}} long pauses, presumably refl ecting bistability of membrane potential, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cerebellar Purkinje cells (PC) of awake animals. It is generally agreed that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> anesthetized animals and in vitro, these cells switch between two stable membrane potential states: a depolarized state (the ‘up-state’) characterized by continuous fi ring of simple spikes (SS) and a hyperpolarized state (the ‘down-state’) characterized by long <b>pauses</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> SS activity. To address the existence of long <b>pauses</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> neural activity of cerebellar PCs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> awake and behaving animal we used extracellular recordings in cats and fi nd that {{approximately half of the}} recorded PCs exhibit such long <b>pauses</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> SS activity and transition between activity – periods with uninterrupted SS lasting an average of 1300 ms – and pauses up to several seconds. We called these cells pausing Purkinje cells (PPC) and they can easily be distinguished from continuous fi ring Purkinje cells. In most PPCs, state transitions in both directions were often associated (25 % of state transitions) with complex spikes (CSs). This is consistent with intracellular fi ndings of CS-driven state transitions. In sum, we present proof for the existence of long <b>pauses</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> PC SS activity that probably refl ect underlying bistability, provide the fi rst in-depth analysis of these pauses and show for the fi rst time that transitions in and out of these pauses are related to CS fi ring <b>in</b> <b>the</b> awake and behaving animal...|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that RNA polymerase <b>pausing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> leader region of the tryptophan (trp) operon of Escherichia coli {{is responsible for the}} synchronization of transcription and translation essential to attenuation control. In this report we use an in vitro coupled transcription/translation system to study the effect of trp leader peptide synthesis on RNA polymerase <b>pausing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> trp leader region. Wild-type and translation-defective trp leader templates of E. coli and Serratia marcescens were employed, and pause RNA synthesis and paused complex release (activation) were quantified relative to synthesis of the terminated leader transcript. It was observed that <b>pausing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> trp leader region was prolonged when translation of the leader transcript was reduced by mutations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> leader region or by addition of the translation inhibitor kasugamycin or chloramphenicol. Experiments with S- 30 extracts from a mutant strain that is inefficient <b>in</b> translating <b>the</b> tryptophan codons <b>in</b> <b>the</b> leader transcript indicated that ribosome movement to these codons also releases the paused transcription complex. These findings indicate that the paused trp leader transcription complex resumes transcription when released by ribosome movement over the leader peptide coding region. This release would facilitate the coupling of transcription and translation essential to attenuation control...|$|R

50|$|During a conversation, turn-taking {{may involve}} a cued gaze that prompts the {{listener}} {{that it is}} their turn or that the speaker is finished talking. There are two gazes that have been identified and associated with turn-taking. The two patterns associated with turn-taking are mutual-break and mutual-hold. Mutual-break is {{when there is a}} <b>pause</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> conversation and both participants use a momentary break with mutual gaze toward each other and then breaking the gaze, then continuing conversation again. This type is correlated with a perceived smoothness due to a decrease <b>in</b> <b>the</b> taking of turns. Mutual-hold is when the speaker also takes a <b>pause</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> conversation with mutual gaze, but then still holds the gaze as he/she starts to speak again. Mutual-hold is associated with less successful turn-taking process, because there are more turns taken, thus more turns required to complete.|$|R
