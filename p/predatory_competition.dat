40|$|Problem statement: One of {{the current}} {{requirements}} of agroecosystem management is the maintenance of biodiversity. Manual sugarcane harvesting with the previous burning of straw has been gradually replaced by mechanical harvesting in Brazil. However, the diversity of Formicidae, {{which can be a}} natural pest controller, has not been studied in this new system yet. Approach: This study was carried out to assess the diversity of ants in an exclusively mechanically harvested sugarcane culture based on the hypothesis that species richness and abundance will increase with the deposition of straw in this culture system. Ants were sampled using pitfall traps in six sugarcane cultivars during three consecutive harvest cycles. Results: A total of 8, 139 ants, distributed in 39 species, were collected. Richness, abundance and diversity differed between harvest cycles, especially in the first cycle, when the soil did not have any straw and in the two last cycles and the straw layer was about 10 - 15 cm thick. The communities found {{in the second and third}} cycles were similar and the maintenance of straw in the culture contributed to a greater species diversity, particularly of generalist predaceous taxa, which may contribute to the natural control of pests. Conclusion: The diversity of ants increased with straw deposition, including of taxa that may be beneficial to the sugarcane culture. However, new studies of the <b>predatory</b> and <b>competition</b> relations in this agroecosystem are necessary. © 2010 Science Publications...|$|R

The feasibility of this strategy has been questioned by the economists and several theories about the reasons and feasibility of predation have emerged in time. In addition to that, different criteria and tests, related to these theories, have been introduced to the economics literature, to serve for predation analysis.

40|$|The virile {{crayfish}} (Orconectes virilis), {{an aggressive}} polytrophic species, {{has been introduced}} into many Arizona streams. I investigated competition and predation between this crayfish and several native Arizona fishes. I conducted field experiments to assess competition for food between crayfish and fish, and laboratory experiments to examine competition for shelter and food, and predation. In Sabino Creek, I manipulated crayfish densities in isolated pools to examine effects of crayfish on growth, mortality, and recruitment of Gila chub (Gila intermedia). Regardless of crayfish density, Gila chub declined slightly in weight and condition. Mortality and recruitment did not differ between densities of crayfish. I examined crayfish effects on benthic macroinvertebrates, a submerged aquatic macrophyte and associated invertebrates, and three fish species in a small stream in the White Mountains by fencing eight stream sections to prevent movement. The three fishes were speckled dace (Rhinichthys osculus), Sonora sucker (Catostomus insignis), and desert sucker (C. clarki). Molluscs > 10 mm and macrophytes were less abundant at sites with a high density of crayfish than at sites with low crayfish densities. Insect diversity was lower in high- vs. low-density sites. No treatment effect was observed on growth or condition of individually marked fish. Short-term laboratory experiments demonstrated <b>predatory</b> interactions and <b>competition</b> for shelter between crayfish and Gila chub, desert sucker, and speckled dace. Crayfish used shelter more than fish, displaced fish from shelter, and frequently attacked fish. Fish never attacked crayfish, and only once displaced crayfish from shelter. In predation experiments, crayfish preyed upon all species, but preyed most heavily upon desert suckers. Fish never altered use of the water column {{in the presence of}} crayfish. Density manipulation experiments in a laboratory measured food competition between crayfish and two native fishes. Growth of Gila chub was less affected by crayfish than by increased density of Gila chub. Thus crayfish are not strong competitors with Gila chub for food. However, growth of flannelmouth sucker (Catostomus latipinnis) was negatively impacted by presence of crayfish. These laboratory experiments provide evidence that introduced crayfish can reduce fish growth by competition for food, and that native fishes are vulnerable to crayfish predation...|$|R

40|$|The wounded {{condition}} of several major American industries, including steel and textiles, resulting from foreign ‘predatory’ conduct has generated much commentary. At the same time, private spokesmen for our institutionalized business interests, including the financial community, have bemoaned American {{balance of trade}} figures, blaming them on such ‘impediments 2 ̆ 7 to our export trade as foreign trade barriers and domestic antitrust laws. The two trade problems suggest a common theme: foreign governments have been unfairly aiding their business interests by protecting monopolized or cartelized foreign markets from American business penetration while also subsidizing, directly or indirectly, foreign invasion of certain targeted American markets. While recognizing subsidized imports and the resulting foreign trade imbalances as trade policy problems, scholars, judges, and governmental officials have also expressed interest in resolving a related domestic competition issue which could help to eliminate predatory conduct in international as well as domestic trade. Through a modest judicial or, if necessary, legislative route, these people seek a clarification of the attempt offense in section 2 of the Sherman Act to bring the law defining attempt to monopolize {{in line with the}} common law and Model Penal Code definitions of criminal attempt. Many circuit courts currently require a showing that the defendant is dangerously close to monopolization before finding an attempt to monopolize. A clarification of the attempt offense would emphasize that victimized American corporations may bring private attempt to monopolize cases against state controlled or subsidized foreign manufacturers that have penetrated American markets through predatory means while their domestic markets remain monopolized. These suits should be allowed even where, as a practical matter, the foreign competitors are not ‘dangerously close’ to monopolizing American markets. This article, in Part I, will review the background and existing state of the law of attempt to monopolize in the Supreme Court and lower federal courts, with particular attention given to the prevailing requirement that the plaintiff show that the defendant is dangerously close to successful monopolization. Part II will focus upon the two major attempt to monopolize cases brought in the last decade by the Department of Justice. The practices challenged in those cases constitute domestic counterparts of some of the alleged predatory practices of foreign competitors, and the cases make clear that the Department has, as a matter of domestic antitrust enforcement, been strongly supportive of the clarification of the attempt offense advocated herein. Part III will review the common law of criminal attempt, which the Supreme Court seems to have recognized as applicable to the Sherman Act, and suggest that it is parallel to the proposal contained in the 1979 National Commission Report to the President concerning the attempt to monopolize provision. That proposal does not require independent proof that a defendant is likely to achieve monopoly power. The article will conclude that a clarification of the attempt to monopolize provision, which would not require independent proof that a defendant is dangerously close to successful monopolization, will resolve an issue of glaring ambiguity in our domestic competition law. The clarification could provide a legitimate weapon for our domestic industries to use against truly <b>predatory</b> foreign <b>competition,</b> while not directly involving United States foreign trade policy and avoiding traditional forms of economic retaliation damaging to world markets...|$|R
40|$|Alien {{invasive}} fishes are {{a growing}} concern in inland water ecosystems around the world, as {{they are capable of}} causing serious damage, especially to indigenous fish populations. Mechanisms include direct predation on indigenous fish by alien <b>predatory</b> species, <b>competition</b> for food and space between native and introduced species, the introduction of alien parasites and pathogens, and general environmental degradation. The Cape Floristic Region (CFR) of South Africa, which is defined by a unique and highly diverse floral kingdom, is also home to a unique and highly threatened ichthyofauna. This ichthyofauna consists of relatively few species, but exhibits the highest proportion of endemicity in the country. Threats to fishes include habitat destruction through bulldozing and water extraction, water quality degradation, restriction of migration by dams and weirs, and alien invasive fishes. The North American smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu Lacepede) has long been regarded by nature conservators as the most threatening invasive species, and much anecdotal and survey data suggests that this species has had {{a major role in the}} depletion and extirpation of indigenous fish populations throughout the CFR. However, no study has ever properly quantified this impact relative to other potential threats that could have precipitated the perceived indigenous fish losses. This is a problem, as it makes the implementation of active control measures difficult to justify to a sceptical public and potential sponsors. The Rondegat River is a tributary of the Olifants River, which rises in the Cedarberg Mountains and flows into the Clanwilliam Dam reservoir. It is partially invaded by M dolomieu, which have penetrated the lower quarter of the river up to a waterfall barrier. This river is home to five species of indigenous fish, including the Clanwilliam yellowfish (Labeobarbus capensis Smith), Clanwilliam redfin (Barbus calidus Barnard), fiery redfin (Pseudobarbus phlegethon Barnard), Clanwilliam rock catfish (Austroglanis gilli Barnard) and the Cape galaxiid (Galaxias zebratus Castelnau). This project was designed to quantify the impact of M dolomieu on these species relative to the alternate potential impacts of physical habitat degradation from agriculture and alien invasive riparian trees, and of food availability. Seasonal surveys were conducted at eight sites on the river in September, October and November 2003, and in April 2004. Four sets of riffles and pools were selected upstream of the waterfall barrier, and four below. Quantitative electrofishing was used to survey fish in riffles, while snorkelling surveys were conducted in pools. All fish species were also caught with seine and tyke nets for dietary analyses. Physical habitat variables were measured at each site, and used to assess changing habitat quality between the sites. Invertebrate samples were also taken along with visual abundance estimations of other food types, to gauge food availability. Fish surveys revealed the loss of B. calidus, P. phlegethon, A. gilli and G. zebratus at bass-invaded sites. Galaxias zebratus was only found in the upper reaches of the river, and so was possibly never common in the lower river. Labeobarbus capensis, while still below the waterfall, appeared to be suffering from near-total loss of post spawning recruits. Discriminant function analyses revealed sedimentation to be a key factor of habitat degradation that characterized invaded sites. However, linear regressions between habitat variables and indigenous fish densities indicated sedimentation to not be a significant negative influence on indigenous fish distributions. Although sedimentation did not appear to influence A. gilli densities at non-invaded sites, it is highly likely that it increased the vulnerability of this species to M dolomieu in the lower river, by removing benthic cover used to avoid predation. In the case of all species, food availability did not seem an important factor in dictating fish distributions. Consequently, predation by M dolomieu was confirmed as the critical mechanism behind the loss of B. calidus, P. phlegethon, A. gilli and juvenile L. capensis in the lower river. A rehabilitation plan is proposed for the Rondegat River. Central to this plan is the formation of a conservancy between the land-owners of the catchment and the custodians of the Cedarberg Wilderness Area. The most effective strategy will be to eradicate M dolomieu from the lower river with piscicides, while at the same time taking steps to rehabilitate the riparian zone throughout the river. A holistic rehabilitation programme such as this would provide an excellent model for future rehabilitation efforts within the CFR...|$|R
40|$|The current {{approach}} for {{environmental risk assessment}} (ERA) of chemicals suffers many limitations. For instance, protection goals often target populations of species whereas RA relies on standard laboratory tests in which toxicity is measured on individual endpoints. From these tests, the threshold concentration of a chemical is derived. In addition, these laboratory tests are conducted under optimal conditions whereas in the field, populations {{have to cope with}} varying environmental conditions and natural stressors. Accounting for the environmental context remains only marginally considered in RA. A realistic estimation of population-level effects of chemicals calls for the use of methodologies that extrapolate effects on individuals to the population level and account for multiple stress effects. In this context, the potential of ecological models in improving the accuracy of RA of chemicals has been advocated. In this thesis, I contribute to demonstrating the power of this tool in providing a more accurate RA of chemicals. I used an established individual-based model (IBM) for Daphnia magna to explore different research questions that limit the accuracy of the current methodology. According to each addressed question, I refined the model by implementing toxicity submodels, additional individual traits or further environmental processes. I was first interested in a toxicant for which adverse effects were detected at the measured threshold concentration and thus challenged the conservationism of RA. Multiple effects of this toxicant were reported on exposed daphnids, in addition to the commonly measured effects on reproduction and survival. I applied a multi-modelling approach to understand individuals’ responses and extrapolate them to the population level. Thereby, I combined the IBM to different toxicity submodels describing individual effects on reproduction and survival. Using the IBM, I ran simulations to extrapolate these effects to the population level. Simulation results confronted to population tests revealed that these endpoints did not fully capture effects on populations. To this end, additional individual-level effects had to be integrated and were thus behind the failure of RA to be conservative. Second, I explored the influence of ecological interactions on population sensitivity to chemicals with different modes-of-action on individuals, by using the IBM as a virtual laboratory. I tested multiple stress exposure scenarios, by combining different chemical and non-chemical stressors’ effects on individuals. In the model, chemical toxicity targeted different vital individual-level processes. <b>Predatory</b> and <b>competition</b> effects were implemented using a worst-case approach. Population dynamics were simulated at different food levels and exposure scenarios. Results revealed that population responses to chemicals are highly sensitive to the environmental stressor. Additionally, important ecological features like density dependence, availability of food resources or the Allee effect due to predation were identified as main drivers of population sensitivity to chemicals. This study demonstrates that population resilience cannot be attributed to chemical stress only and that accounting for relevant chemical and non-chemical interactions would reduce uncertainties when extrapolating effects to the population level. Finally, I used the same modelling framework {{to assess the impact of}} the environmental scenario on population recovery from lethal effects. Population recovery is determined from mesocosm experiments whose results are limited to the adopted experimental design. Simulation experiments were performed for chemicals with different lethality levels at different food and temperature conditions, with and without species interactions. Results revealed that recovery of populations strongly depended on the environmental scenario. In fact, highly heterogeneous responses to the same chemical were obtained when the environmental conditions changed. In addition, no specific role could be attributed to any environmental variable in isolation. Only the complex interactive mechanisms between the different factors constituting the full environmental scenario determined their mutual roles in controlling population recovery. Unless these combinations of factors and effects are simultaneously taken into account in RA, we cannot understand the mechanisms controlling population recovery from chemical exposure. In conclusion, the findings of this thesis demonstrate that ecological modelling holds a great potential in assisting RA of chemicals in the future by i) providing a mechanistic explanation of toxicity effects on individuals and their consequences on populations, ii) identifying the modes of action triggering population-level effects, and iii) integrating the necessary environmental complexity related to the species and its environment for a more realistic estimation of population-level effects...|$|R
40|$|Biological invasions {{are natural}} {{phenomena}} {{that have occurred}} throughout {{the natural history of}} earth. The highly negative context of the term biological invasion is associated with the fact that many modern invasive processes are anthropogenically driven. Indeed, human affiliated invasions are among the primary drivers of the current biodiversity crises. Murid rodents (Rodentia: Muridea) of the genus Rattus and Mus have become among the worst vertebrate invasive species and apart from man are the most widespread mammals on earth. Invasive rodents have severe and negative effects on human health, agricultural systems, and natural environments. The practice of rodent control is extensive and substantial attempts are made to decrease rodents’ severe impacts on the environment. However, although these attempts are largely successful, there are still issues in the control of invasive rodents and new methodologies, whether at a macro or micro scale are actively pursued. Behavioural conservation attempts to understand and improve conservation processes and practices through the study of animal behaviour. Indeed, it is becoming increasingly apparent that the behaviour of animals can be a strong tool for conservation. The control of invasive species has the goal of reducing <b>predatory</b> or <b>competition</b> pressure on species of conservation concern and advocates for behavioural conservation acknowledge the importance of behavioural studies of invasive species that can directly benefit or inform control measures. In this thesis, I explore several aspects of behavioural ecology in the Norway rat R. norvegicus and the house mouse, M. musculus, with the overarching aim of informing and improving rodent control. I conducted a series of laboratory and field experiments focused on rodent behaviour and pest control. 1) I tested whether laboratory rats can act as effective lures for wild Norway rats and hence overcome the problem of rats avoiding food baits. This field experiment was based on the highly social behaviour exhibited by this species. I found that live traps containing live lures were significantly more effective than those with food baits at capturing wild Norway rats. In a second series of tests, I found that live lures were more efficient than food baits at attracting rats to kill traps. A study of radio-collared rats released onto a rat-free island produced inconclusive but promising results on the potential of live lures to be used to control incursions. I suggest that the use of laboratory rats as lures should be considered as an additional tool for use in future pest control management plans for invasive Norway rats. 2) I used Y-maze laboratory experiments to examine the attractiveness of urine from mice fed high and low protein diets to male and female wild mice, whether the protein content of the diet of mice affected their response and the strength of attraction of wild mice towards wild and laboratory live lure conspecifics of the opposite sex. I found that mice preferred to spend more time close to urine from donors that had eaten a high protein diet, that mouse strain did not affected conspecific attraction and that males were more active than females toward the urine of the opposite sex. These results may have implications for improving mouse capture and control. 3) I assessed the impacts of mammalian odours (specific direct cues of predation or competition) and illumination intensity (a general indirect cue of predation) on the foraging of free-ranging mice that are naïve to mammalian predators, using feeding trials in the field. Here I found that phases of the moon, but not odour, had significant effects on mouse foraging behaviour. I suggest that repeating the study over multiple lunar cycles is required to confirm this influence and, if confirmed, recommend coordinating management efforts according to the phases of the moon to improve mouse bait take and reduce bait wastage. 4) I tested for the responces of rat-naïve mice to scent cues from rats, which are competitors and potential predators in laboratory experiments, in a Y-maze apparatus. Mice behaviours revealed unexpected differences in male and female responces to rat scent. Male mice showed preference to control over rat scented food trays, while females were indiference in their preferation or even prefered rat scented food trays over control ones. These sex-based differences can suggest that males and females might be under different evolutionary pressures in regard to novel scents. 5) I looked at macronutrient selection in wild caught mice, under controlled laboratory conditions. I found that mice consumed more of diets with a high carbohydrate/protein ratio, but were highly generalist and opportunistic feeders, in general prioritising energy over macronutrients. These results demonstrate that the pattern of macronutrient selection is sensitive to ecological circumstances, and associates an opportunistic strategy with successful invasion by a small mammal in a temperate environment. The understanding and improvement of conservation practices directly through the study of animal behavioural processes is an emerging and rapidly growing science, but relatively little attention is given to the benefits that we can draw from incorporating and understanding of invasive species behaviour into their control. To maintain an effective and continuous control of invasive species, managers need comprehensive knowledge of the behaviour of the species they target. This can be achieved only through targeted behavioural research of invasive species that is directed at improving pest control. In this thesis I have attempted to do just this...|$|R
