25|$|Pyrolysis is {{a process}} of thermo-chemical {{decomposition}} of organic materials by heat in the absence of oxygen which produces various hydrocarbon gases. During pyrolysis, the molecules of object are subjected to very high temperatures leading to very high vibrations. Therefore, every molecule in the object is stretched and shaken to an extent that molecules starts breaking down. The rate of pyrolysis increases with temperature. In industrial applications, temperatures are above 430°C (800°F). Fast pyrolysis produces liquid fuel for feedstocks like wood. Slow pyrolysis produces gases and solid charcoal. Pyrolysis hold promise for conversion of waste biomass into useful liquid fuel. Pyrolysis of waste plastics can produce millions of litres of fuel. Solid products of this process contain metals, glass, sand and <b>pyrolysis</b> <b>coke</b> which cannot be converted to gas in the process.|$|E

Process temperatures were set {{in the range from}} 500 to 650 °C. Mass input of the material was 30 kg per hour. The aim of the article is to answer the following questions as regards the individual products: Under which process conditions can the highest quality of the individual products related to energy be reached? How does the thermal efficiency of the system change in reaction to various conditions of the process? On the basis of the experimental measurements and calculations, apart from other things, it was discovered that the pyrolysis liquid reaches the highest energetic value, i. e. 42. 7 MJ. kg- 1, out of all the individual products of the pyrolysis process. Generated pyrolysis gas disposes of the highest lower calorific value 37. 1 MJ. kg- 1 and the <b>pyrolysis</b> <b>coke</b> disposes of the maximum 30. 9 MJ kg- 1.

40|$|The {{production}} of energy from fossil fuels {{gives rise to the}} emission of CO 2, NO, and SO 2. The amounts of these compounds formed during the {{production of}} energy from renewables such as wind, sun and biomass are less than those in case of fossil fuels. Therefore, research and development is carried out for the application of renewables now and in the near future. This chapter focuses on the application of biomass, and more specific on the use of catalysts for the conversion technologies of biomass. Promising technologies, which are in a demonstration phase, are pyrolysis, gasification and hydrothermal upgrading. The products from these types of conversion technologies are: gas, fuel oil or bio-oil transport fuels and chemicals for the food and chemical industry. The production of hydrocarbons is a major objective of most bio-oil upgrading research. Flash and fast pyrolysis are techniques combining high healing rates and short reaction times. Rapid quenching preserves valuable products. Most of the technologies are studied on lab-scale or pilot-scale. For a number of conversion routes catalysts are applied. Char formation and coke deposition are major problems in upgrading of <b>pyrolysis</b> oils. <b>Coke</b> deposition deactivates the catalyst and has to be avoided or minimised. Pyrolysis oils are highly oxygenated, viscous, corrosive, relatively unstable and very complex. However, catalytic upgrading may produce a high valuable chemical feedstock. Oxygen in the oxygenated compounds is, therefore, converted to CO and CO 2 rather than H 2 O to preserve hydrogen for hydrocarbon reactions.

The final aim of the European project SPRITCO which includes this work is the prediction of the coal pushing on the heating wall in the coke oven battery to prevent their damage and then to increase their lifetime. The goal of this work is to develop a thermo-chemo-mechanical model of the coal cake which emphasizes the mechanical effects of the pyrolysis. During pyrolysis, as function of temperature, 4 steps are obtained: drying, plastic phase, semi-coke and coke. Considering the structure of coal, the presence of moisture and volatile matter, fully coupled thermo-chemo-mechanical model for unsaturated porous media is used to simulate the complex coupling mechanisms involved. Transfer of heat, moisture air and volatile matter in a deformable and unsaturated medium involves interaction of three different physics (thermal, mechanical and fluid) and three different phases (solid, liquid and gas). The mathematical formulation of the problem is a set of partial differential equations that combine mass balance, energy balance, momentum balance and state laws of each phase. During coal drying, the observed mechanisms are: evaporation, condensation, phase change and temperature plateau. The second stage concerns the change from coal to plastic phase which induces a mechanical behavior evolution of the skeleton, from elasticity to viscoplasticity. Then the transformation of plastic phase to semi-coke and semi-coke to coke.

40|$|Denmark (DTU) and Cowi Consulting Engineers and Planners AS {{are able}} to present the proven {{two-stage}} gasification process, a concept for high efficiency gasification of biomass producing negligible amounts of tars. Figure 1. The two-stage gasification process developed and tested at the DTU The two-stage gasification pilot plant was developed at the Department of Mechanical Engineering, Technical University of Denmark. In the two-stage gasification process (Fig. 1), the pyrolysis and the gasification processes are separated into two different units. In between the pyrolysis and the gasification, volatiles from the pyrolysis are partially oxidised. Drying and pyrolysis The pyrolysis unit consist of a transport screw with external heating (heated by exhaust gas from the engine). In the pyrolysis unit the volatiles escape from the fuel at temperatures below 600 ?C leaving solid coke. The residence time is 15 – 30 minutes. Partial oxidation At {{the end of the}} <b>pyrolysis</b> screw, the <b>coke</b> and the volatiles fall through the high temperature (1100 – 1300 ?C) partial oxidation zone directly into the fixed bed gasification chamber. Adding preheated air in a turbulent swirl causes the partial oxidation of the volatiles. Hereby a cracking of the pyrolysis tar will take place. Gasification The char is gasified in the down-draft gasification reactor. H 2 O and CO 2 from the partial oxidation act as gasification agents to convert the char into combustible gasses which reduce the risk of channelling. The char bed is supported by a grid through which the produced gas escapes at approximately 750 ?C. Fuel Exhaust gas...|$|R

40|$|Thermochemical {{conversion}} of biomass via pyrolysis {{can play an}} important role in renewable fuel production. Introduction of catalyst in biomass pyrolysis is an effective way to upgrade the quality of bio-oil via de-oxygenation reactions. However, in catalytic <b>pyrolysis,</b> char and <b>coke</b> are formed via primary decomposition of biomass and secondary catalytic reactions of pyrolysis intermediates, respectively. The formation of coke and char is the main reaction competing with the production of favorable aromatic compounds and can significantly deteriorate catalyst activity. Control of coke and char formation during pyrolysis could be possible through innovative catalyst and process designs, in which fundamental understanding of the formation mechanisms of char and coke should be viewed as a prerequisite. This study utilizes various experimental and modeling techniques in order to measure and interpret the physicochemical characteristics of char and coke and gain mechanistic insights of their origins during biomass catalytic pyrolysis. This study includes design and testing of a conical spouted bed reactor for in-situ biomass catalytic pyrolysis, investigation of the effect of key operating parameters on pyrolysis product distribution, characterization of char and coke structures and a structured model compound exploration of coke formation mechanisms. It is shown that char and coke have different origins. They cannot be lumped as one, since they occupy different locations on the catalyst surface and, thus, contribute differently to catalyst deactivation. Char, a product from thermal reactions, forms as an external layer on the catalyst surface and in its macropores, whereas coke, a catalytic product, forms inside the zeolite micropores. By studying the coke formation using biomass model compounds, it is concluded that the chemical structure of coke depends on its chemical precursors. The formation of coke from olefins, aromatic hydrocarbons and aromatic oxygenates are all directly related to the so-called “hydrocarbon pool” mechanism, following mainly hydrogen transfer and cyclization reactions...|$|R

During heating, large amounts of carbon monoxide are released, sulphur dioxide {{is produced}} from residual sulphur in the coke, and hydrocarbon fume {{is produced by}} <b>pyrolysis</b> of the <b>coke.</b> Loading and unloading furnaces causes exposures to respirable dust containing crystalline silica, silicon carbide, and hydrocarbons. In the autumn of 1980 extensive measurements were made of personal exposures to air contaminants. Eight hour time weighted exposures to sulphur dioxide ranged from less than 0. 1 ppm to 1. 5 ppm and respirable participate exposures ranged from 0. 01 mg/m 3 to 9. 0 mg/m 3. Geometric mean particulate exposures for jobs ranged from 0. 1 mg/m 3 to 1. 46 mg/m 3. The particulate contained varying amounts of alpha-quartz, ranging from less than 1 % to 17 %, and most quartz exposures were substantially below the threshold limit value of 100 micrograms/m 3. Only traces of cristobalite (less than 1 %) {{were found in the}} particulate. Median exposures to air contaminants in each job were estimated. Since the operations at the plant had been stable over the past 30 years, it was possible to estimate long term exposures of workers to sulphur dioxide, respirable particulate, quartz, total inorganic material, and extractable organic material. Cumulative exposure (average concentration times exposure duration) for each of the air contaminants was estimated for each worker using his job history. There was sufficient independent variability in the sulphur dioxide and respirable particulate cumulative exposures to make an assessment of their independent effects feasible. The theoretical basis for using the cumulative exposure index and its shortcomings for epidemiological applications were presented...|$|R
