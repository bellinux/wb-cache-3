Further, simulated annealing (SA) algorithm is applied to RPT technique for finding the global optimum solutions. Numerical simulation proves that this SA-based RPT phase unwrapping technique is highly robust to noise and experimental results also show its feasibility in practical applications...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of processing parameters (slab thickness, water flow of interstand cooling and oil flow in roll gap lubrication system) on the thickness {{and composition of}} the tertiary scale formed during hot strip rolling, was studied in a low carbon steel in factory. The scale formed on the rolled surface was characterized by scanning electron microscopy and Mössbauer spectroscopy. It was observed that the combined effect of a greater rolling oil volume applied, larger bar thickness, and smaller amount of water flow during interstand cooling reduces the tertiary scale thickness. Besides, a smaller crack density in the samples is associated with greater rolling oil volume and smaller oxide scale thickness. The <b>principal</b> <b>phase</b> of the scale formed in hot-rolled steel strips is stoichiometric magnetite, without isomorphic substitutions...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the stabilisation of the wrist joint and the ad hoc wrist muscles activations during the two <b>principal</b> <b>phases</b> of the freestyle stroke. Seven male international swimmers performed a maximal semi-tethered power test. A swimming ergometer fixed on the start area of the pool was used to collect maximal power. The electromyography signal (EMG) of the right flexor carpi ulnaris (FCU) and extensor carpi ulnaris (ECU) was recorded with surface electrodes and processed using the integrated EMG (IEMG). Frontal and sagittal video views were digitised frame by frame to determine the wrist angle in the sagittal plane and the <b>principal</b> <b>phases</b> of the stroke (insweep, outsweep). Important stabilisation of the wrist and high antagonist muscle activity were observed during the insweep phase due to the great mechanical constraints.

40|$|We {{provide the}} first {{observation}} of weak localization in high carrier density {{two-dimensional electron gas}} in AlInN/GaN heterostructures; at low temperatures and low fields the conductivity increases with increasing magnetic field. Weak localization is further confirmed by the lnT dependence of the zero-field conductivity and angle dependence of magnetoresistance. The inelastic scattering rate is linearly proportional to temperature, demonstrating that electron-electron scattering is the <b>principal</b> <b>phase</b> breaking mechanism. Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations at high magnetic fields are also observed. From the temperature dependent amplitude of SdH oscillation and Dingle plot, the effective mass of electron is extracted to be 0. 2327 me; in addition the quantum lifetime is smaller than transport time from Hall measurement, indicating small angle scattering such as from remote ionized impurities is dominant. Above 20 K, the scattering changes from acoustic phonon to optical phonon scattering, resulting in a rapid decrease in carrier mobility with increasing temperature. Comment: 11 pages, 6 figure...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{physicochemical}} properties of novel calcium silicate cements (CSCs) prepared by using a sol-gel method. Methods: The compressive strength, morphology, and phase composition of various cements were evaluated after mixing with water, in addition to setting time and pH value. Results: As solid phases, the sol-gel-derived powders mainly consisted of beta-dicalcium silicate. Setting times for cements mixed with water ranged from 12 - 42 minutes and were lower for cements with higher starting CaO content. The compressive strength of the CSCs ranged from 0. 3 - 15. 2 MPa; these values were significantly different (P <. 05). Calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H) was the <b>principal</b> <b>phase</b> that formed in the hydration process. The CSCs' pH values changed from an initial 11 to a high of 13. Conclusions: CSCs display advantageously shortened setting times and might have potential for endodontic use, although further tests are necessary to confirm this.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is concerned}} with adaptive sensing and processing in com-puter vision, specifically {{through the application of}} computer vision techniques to non-standard sensors. In the first part, we adapt techniques designed to solve the classical computer vision problem of gradient-based surface reconstruction to the problem of phase unwrapping that presents itself in applications such as interferometric synthetic aperture radar. Specifically, we propose a new formulation of and solution to the classical two-dimensional phase unwrapping problem. As is usually done, we use the wrapped <b>principal</b> <b>phase</b> gradient field as a measurement of the absolute phase gradient field. Since this model rarely holds in practice, we explicitly enforce in-tegrability of the gradient measurements through a sparse error-correction model. Using a novel energy-minimization functional, we formulate the phase unwrapping task as a generalized lasso problem. We then jointly estimate the absolute phase and the sparse measurement errors using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm. Using an interferometric synthetic aperture radar noise model...|$|E
40|$|Any {{biomaterial}} implanted into {{a living}} body elicits a distinct local reaction. This reaction {{depends on the}} physical, physico-chemical and chemical properties of the material. The obvious term to designate this inherent property of a biomaterial to induce a local reaction is reactogenicity. Reactogenicity of a biomaterial {{is one of the}} main factors determining (together with other properties of the implanted device) the bio(non) compatibility of the implant. Such amplification of terminology which establishes differences between biocompatibility as a generalized characteristic of biomaterials in all their interrelations with the host 2 ̆ 7 s organism and the influences on local processes around implants, makes the biocompatibility concept more precise from a logical and semantic point of view. The <b>principal</b> <b>phase</b> of the local reaction to an implant is inflammation. Reactogenicity manifests itself mainly in determining peculiarities of this phase, and these peculiarities can be modulated by modifying properties of the material. The practical heuristic advantages of the reactogenicity concept are associated with its quantitative character and with turning attention to the possibility of regulating the local reaction without crossing limits of biocompatibility...|$|E
