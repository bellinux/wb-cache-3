40|$|This paper {{develops}} a generalized profit function that incorporates <b>price</b> <b>distortions</b> resulting from imperfect market conditions, sociopolitical and institutional constraints, {{as well as}} technical and allocative inefficiency. The model is applied to test (1) {{the appropriateness of the}} neoclassical profit function and (2) the effect of education and farm size on allocative performance using farm-level data from Indian agriculture. Empirical results reject the neoclassical profit-maximization hypothesis based on market prices in favor of the general model with <b>price</b> <b>distortions</b> and, therefore, help to improve allocation of inputs and output.

40|$|In this paper, we {{estimate}} oligopoly and oligopsony <b>price</b> <b>distortions</b> in the U.

Based on this model, we are able to derive a parameter that nests various types of firm conduct, ranging from price taking through Nash-Cournot behavior to collusion. In addition, {{we estimate}} market conduct and associated <b>price</b> <b>distortions</b> in a sub-game perfect, dynamic-feedback model, and compare the results with those derived from an open-loop model. The results indicate that the behavior of potato-processing firms is much closer to price taking than to collusion. Moreover, we find that <b>price</b> <b>distortions</b> due to oligopsony in the purchase of potatoes are smaller than oligopoly <b>price</b> <b>distortions</b> in either the potato chips or the frozen French fries sectors.

5000|$|William J. Baumol and David F. Bradford {{in their}} article [...] "Optimal Departures from Marginal Cost Pricing" [...] also discuss the <b>price</b> <b>distortion</b> taxes cause.

They recognize that with every tax, there is some sort of <b>price</b> <b>distortion,</b> so they state that any solution can only be the second-best option and any solution proposed is under that added constraint. However, their theory differs from other literature in this topic. First, it deals with quasi-optimal pricing, looking at four options for Pareto optimality with adjusted commodity prices. Second, they express their theory in more simplified terms which incurs a loss of realistic application. Third, it combines the three discussions: the welfare theory, the contributions of the regulations and public finance. They conclude that under constraints, the best possible theory to get close to optimality, which is not “best” at all, is the systematic division between prices and marginal costs.|$|E

40|$|We {{argue that}} {{deterministic}} market clearing formulations introduce arbitrary distortions between day-ahead and expected real-time prices that bias economic incentives and block diversification.

We prove that the formulation yields <b>price</b> <b>distortions</b> that are bounded by the bid prices, and we show that adding a similar penalty term to transmission flows and phase angles ensures boundedness throughout the network. We prove that when the <b>price</b> <b>distortions</b> are zero, day-ahead quantities converge to the quantile of real-time counterparts. The undesired effects of <b>price</b> <b>distortions</b> suggest that stochastic settings provide significant benefits over deterministic ones that go beyond social surplus improvements.

40|$|We {{construct}} a time-variant, price-based measure of trade distortions in 28 manufacturing industries {{for a large}} sample of countries {{over the last four}} decades, documenting facts consistent with the argument that changes in relative prices are an important channel through which an economy’s openness affects outcomes. First, we find that <b>price</b> <b>distortions</b> at the aggregate level are negatively associated with the degree of openness and the speed at which trade volume, exports, and imports grow. The negative association between trade outcomes and <b>price</b> <b>distortions</b> is fundamentally driven by the positive link between openness and <b>price</b> <b>distortions.</b> Second, increases in trade around the time of liberalization are positively related to a decline in aggregate <b>price</b> <b>distortions</b> for the sample of trade-liberalizing countries. Third, the extent of production reallocation is positively associated with the degree of relative price changes that occur around the time of liberalization, particularly across constant-return-to-scale sectors. Fourth, changes in relative prices at the industry level within countries are positively correlated with changes in output, productivity, and firm size, and negatively associated with the number of firms. Finally, we show that the neoclassical theory of trade does a poor job explaining how relative prices change during trade liberalization. ...|$|R

40|$|South Africa has rapidly reduced trade {{barriers}} {{since the end}} of Apartheid, yet agricultural production and exports have remained sluggish. Also, poverty and unemployment have risen and become increasingly concentrated in rural areas. This paper examines the extent to which remaining <b>price</b> <b>distortions,</b> both domestic and foreign, are contributing to the underperformance of the agricultural sector vis-à-vis the rest of the economy. We draw on a computable general equilibrium (CGE) and micro-simulation model of South Africa that are linked to the results of a global trade model. This framework is used {{to examine the effects of}} eliminating global and domestic <b>price</b> <b>distortions.</b> Model results indicate that South Africa’s agricultural sector currently benefits from global <b>price</b> <b>distortions,</b> and that removing these would create more jobs for lower-skilled workers, thereby reducing income inequality and poverty. We also find that South Africa’s own policies are biased against agriculture and that removing domestic distortions would raise agricultural production. Job losses in nonagricultural sectors would be outweighed by job creation in agriculture, such that overall employment rises and poverty falls. Overall, our findings suggest that South Africa’s own policies are more damaging to its welfare, poverty and inequality than distortionary policies in the rest of the world. Existing national <b>price</b> <b>distortions</b> may thus explain some of the poor performance of South Africa’s agricultural sector and rural development.

40|$|Many {{commentators}} {{credit the}} Supreme Court’s decision in Basic, Inc. v. Levinson, which allowed courts to presume reliance rather than requiring individualized proof, with spawning a vast industry of private securities fraud litigation. Today, {{the validity of}} Basic’s holding has come under attack as scholars have {{raised questions about the}} extent to which the capital markets are efficient. In truth, both these views are overstated. Basic’s adoption of the Fraud on the Market presumption reflected a retreat from prevailing lower court recognition that the application of a reliance requirement was inappropriate in the context of impersonal public market transactions. And, contrary to arguments currently being made to the Supreme Court in the Amgen case, FOTM does not require a strong degree of market efficiency – merely that market prices respond to information. The Basic decision had another less widely recognized effect, however; it began shifting the nature of private securities fraud claims from transaction-based claims to market-based claims, a shift that was completed by the Court’s later decision in Dura. The consequence of this shift was to convert the nature of the plaintiff’s harm from a corruption of the investment decision to one of transacting at a distorted price. The legal significance of <b>price</b> <b>distortion</b> was at the heart of the Halliburton decision. The lower court confused two temporally distinct concepts: ex ante <b>price</b> <b>distortion,</b> which is part of the reliance inquiry and ex post <b>price</b> <b>distortion,</b> which is a component of loss causation. The Supreme Court limited its holding in Halliburton to identifying this confusion, leaving examination of the appropriate role of <b>price</b> <b>distortion</b> for future cases. In Amgen, the Court may be forced to tackle this question. This Article argues that Amgen highlights the incongruity of considering <b>price</b> <b>distortion</b> at the class certification stage and provides an opportunity for the Court to reconsider and reject Basic’s insistence on retaining a reliance requirement...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{corporate}} governance issues and competition policy. The impact of private benefits extraction on {{the values of}} oligopolistic firms is analyzed.

In oligopoly, private benefits extraction may enhance the profits while still generating a welfare loss: this suggests that corporate governance cannot be divorced from competion policy in industries where managerial opportunism generates operating costs. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{its recent}} Halliburton decision, the Supreme Court {{focused on the}} role of <b>price</b> <b>distortion</b> in meeting the {{requirements}} for class certification in private securities fraud litigation. Accepting the argument that the fraud-on-the-market theory requires fraudulent information to have an effect on stock price, the Court reasoned that defendants should therefore be allowed to introduce evidence of lack of price impact in an effort to defeat class certification. Specifically, the Court suggested that defendants might introduce event studies as direct evidence that could sever the link between the misrepresentation and stock price. This conclusion, however, misapprehends the event study methodology. Specifically, the emphasis on event studies is misguided because the event studies proffered by defendants do not conclusively establish that the fraud did not distort stock price. More broadly, the limitations of existing quantitative methods suggest that they should not be the exclusive way of analyzing <b>price</b> <b>distortion</b> for purposes of class certification. Instead, the importance of <b>price</b> <b>distortion</b> suggests the need for greater consideration of materiality because a finding of materiality is an implicit determination that the information has the capacity to affect stock price...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{attempts to}} identify and assess the effect of corruption on development and economic growth in less developed countries (LDCs). The methodological undertaking is twofold. The first is to see whether proxy variables could be imputed effectively to measure the concept of corruption. The second is {{to see if there}} is a significant relationship between the proxy indicators. The research identifies rent-seeking and <b>price</b> <b>distortion</b> as important and dynamic catalyst that affect economic growth and development. The data used to measure <b>price</b> <b>distortion</b> were those available from the World Bank Staff Working Papers, 1983, authored by Ramgopal Agarwala. In that paper, the author classifies thirty-one nation-states as high or low on a distortion performance scale. These thirty-one countries made up the initial data set used in creating the proxy for what is considered the major culprit of underdevelopment in LDCs. This study creates a linkage in the concepts of rent-seeking and corruption. Principally, the study finds no significant differences in the two concepts other than their semantic applications. Rent-seeking and corruption both address the issue of contrived transfers that distort an economy and, when such transfers become rampant, destroy economic performance. Both concepts do interfere with the efficient operation of a nation's institutions and public policy. The regression analysis shows that rent-seeking and <b>price</b> <b>distortion</b> explain about 59 percent of the variance in the shifts in economic growth in LDCs. Also rent-seeking and <b>price</b> <b>distortion</b> is negatively but significantly correlated with economic growth. This study indicates, through empirical analysis and impressionistic evidence, that to a large extent the lack of economic growth and development in LDCs is attributed to an internal dynamic [...] corruption.
