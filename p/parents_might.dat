25|$|When Silk {{retired from}} Radley, rather than {{accepting}} any retirement gifts for himself, he established the Dennis Silk Fund {{to support the}} education of talented boys whose <b>parents</b> <b>might</b> otherwise have struggled to pay the school's fees.|$|E
25|$|Parents {{have cited}} an {{interest}} in preparing themselves or the baby's siblings for gender-specific issues. Some women might prefer this test to an ultrasound exam, which might reveal fetal abnormalities that the <b>parents</b> <b>might</b> prefer not to know about until after delivery.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, {{a nest of}} 15 young Protoceratops andrewsi was {{discovered}} in Mongolia. Stated as being the first Protoceratops nest discovered to date, the discovery suggests that Protoceratops <b>parents</b> <b>might</b> have cared for their young at nests during at least {{the early stages of}} childhood. As Protoceratops is a relatively basal member of the ceratopsians, the finding also suggests that other ceratopsians provided care for their young as well.|$|E

6000|$|... "Am I to understand, Mordaunt," [...] he asked, with {{a little}} of the gravity a <b>parent</b> <b>might</b> be {{expected}} to exhibit on hearing so unpleasant an announcement--"Am I to understand, Mordaunt, that you are actually engaged to this young--eh-eh-eh--this young person?" ...|$|R
25|$|Japanese {{names are}} usually written in kanji, which are {{characters}} usually Chinese in origin but Japanese in pronunciation. The kanji for a name {{may have a}} variety of possible Japanese pronunciations, hence <b>parents</b> <b>might</b> use hiragana or katakana when giving a birth name to their newborn child. Names written in hiragana or katakana are phonetic renderings, and so lack the visual meaning of names expressed in the logographic kanji.|$|E
25|$|In USA {{domestic}} politics, Schneerson supported {{government involvement}} {{in education and}} welcomed {{the establishment of the}} United States Department of Education in 1980, yet insisted that part of a school's educational mission was to incorporate the values espoused in the Seven Laws of Noah. He called for the introduction of a moment of silence {{at the beginning of the}} school day, and for students to be encouraged to use this time for such improving thoughts or prayers as their <b>parents</b> <b>might</b> suggest.|$|E
500|$|Bell et al. {{rejected}} many accepted {{ideas about}} the development of homosexuality. They concluded that psychodynamic theories exaggerate the role of parents in the development of their sons' sexual orientation, and that the psychoanalytic model that attributed male homosexuality to dominant mothers and weak fathers is inadequate, there being barely any connection between boys' relationships with their mothers and the development of homosexuality. Bell et al. found the idea that [...] "cold, detached" [...] fathers and poor father-son relationships predispose boys toward homosexuality more plausible, but emphasized that these factors have only an indirect connection to sexual preference. Bell et al. suggested that relationships with <b>parents</b> <b>might</b> play a greater {{role in the development of}} female homosexuality, although they found having a cold or distant father less significant as a cause of female than of male homosexuality. They also rejected various sociological theories, such as the idea that homosexuality results from labeling by others. Overall, they concluded that sexual preference is likely to be already determined by the time boys and girls reach adolescence, and that there is a powerful link between gender nonconformity and the development of homosexuality in both sexes, but especially in men. Though stressing that their model [...] "applies only to extant theories and does not create new ones", Bell et al. wrote that they had identified [...] "a pattern of feelings and reactions within the child that cannot be traced back to a single social or psychological root".|$|E
2500|$|Crowley {{began his}} {{entry into the}} {{political}} arena by supporting Albert G. Schmedeman for governor of Wisconsin. The biographer Weiss says [...] "He managed Schmedeman as a <b>parent</b> <b>might</b> his children, and as he managed his family {{and most of the}} nurses at Saint Mary’s Hospital." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{model is}} also {{consistent}} with slow parenting in that children are encouraged to explore the world for themselves. They have to learn to face the risks that nature presents. Although slow <b>parenting</b> <b>might</b> go further and reduce the level of protection offered by parents, it would not advocate withholding it entirely.|$|R
40|$|Part of the Pryor {{collection}} of cartoons and drawings. With dubious taste, this undated cartoon, {{with reference to}} the notorious Azaria Chamberlain case where a dingo took baby Azaria from the family tent at Uluru, suggests what a fed-up <b>parent</b> <b>might</b> possibly have in mind for his recalcitrant children. [...] Information provided by Geoff Pryor...|$|R
2500|$|Breakfast {{clubs are}} {{generally}} considered to enhance both academic performance and behavior, especially for children whose <b>parents</b> <b>might</b> not otherwise {{be able to afford}} to provide them with regular meals. [...] Breakfast provision is however less prevalent compared with school lunch, both in the UK and worldwide. As of 2013, only about half the school children in the UK have access to a breakfast club.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{example is}} that a person may {{illegally}} register their car to a location that would net them cheaper insurance rates than where they actually live, sometimes called [...] "rate evasion". For example, some drivers in Brooklyn drive with Pennsylvania license plates because registering their car in a rural part of Pennsylvania will cost {{a lot less than}} registering it in Brooklyn. Another form of automobile insurance fraud, known as [...] "fronting," [...] involves registering someone other than the real primary driver of a car as the primary driver of the car. For example, <b>parents</b> <b>might</b> list themselves as the primary driver of their children's vehicles to avoid young driver premiums.|$|E
2500|$|Other studies provide {{evidence}} that adoptive relationships can form along other lines. A study evaluating the level of parental investment indicates strength in adoptive families, suggesting that parents who adopt invest more time in their children than other parents and concludes, [...] "...adoptive parents enrich their children's lives {{to compensate for the}} lack of biological ties and the extra challenges of adoption." [...] Another recent study found that adoptive families invested more heavily in their adopted children, for example, by providing further education and financial support. Noting that adoptees seemed to be more likely to experience problems such as drug addiction, the study speculated that adoptive <b>parents</b> <b>might</b> invest more in adoptees not because they favor them, but because they are more likely than genetic children to need the help.|$|E

50|$|The person {{providing}} the allowance is usually {{trying to control}} how or when money is spent by the recipient so that it meets {{the aims of the}} person {{providing the}} money. For example, an allowance by a <b>parent</b> <b>might</b> be motivated to teach the child money management and may be unconditional or be tied to completion of chores or achievement of specific grades.|$|R
2500|$|Prior to the {{campaign}} and upon dropping of the writs, opinion polling indicated the Liberals were ahead of the Conservatives by 2–10% popular support (November 30, 2005: Liberals 35%, Conservatives 30%). However, the Liberal lead did not last. [...] They did not plan much serious campaigning during December, allowed the Conservatives {{to take the initiative}} in rolling out policy ideas. [...] Several early gaffes were picked up by an unsympathetic media. One notable gaffe was Liberal Party strategist Scott Reid's suggestion that <b>parents</b> <b>might</b> buy beer and popcorn with the Conservative's child care subsidy, although Martin declined to apologize. Martin was also criticized for portraying himself as the defender of Canadian unity; some opponents pointed that this election was not a referendum while others pointed to the Sponsorship Scandal.|$|E
2500|$|Oshinsky {{writes that}} as [...] "headlines screamed, 'Polio Scourge,' 'Polio Panic', and 'Polio's Deadly Path'," [...] parents [...] "faced a dilemma" [...] {{and a feeling}} of {{personal}} helplessness {{in the midst of an}} [...] "apparently runaway epidemic." [...] Their [...] "postwar culture was being turned upside down" [...] as polio became the [...] "crack in the fantasy" [...] of a suburban home [...] "bursting with children." [...] Parents began to see that there would be an alternative, however: [...] "Since worry did no good and quarantine seemed fruitless, <b>parents</b> <b>might</b> best protect their children by helping others to discover a vaccine against polio, and, perhaps, even a cure." [...] The public soon realized that this kind of research demanded [...] "big money" [...] and an [...] "army of devoted volunteers", but Salk was determined to make it over this barrier.|$|E
2500|$|His mother {{claims that}} prior to the {{shooting}} she alerted the IDF and other security services that her son was still in possession of his military-issued weapon. 'We told everyone he's AWOL, {{that he could do}} something with his gun. We begged them to take away his gun. He also asked them to take his gun. The army destroyed my child. The army destroyed my life.' [...] According to The New Republic, 'an army psychiatrist warned that he wasn't fit for weapons or uniform, but his professional judgment was awaiting approval by a panel of medical experts that was not very swift in assembling' and that a 'former {{chief of staff of the}} IDF' had 'speculated that the killer's <b>parents</b> <b>might</b> have a chance to win damages in court for neglect by the army of the welfare of their son.' ...|$|E
50|$|The {{consequences}} {{for health and}} education are heavily dependent on details of implementation. For example, ownership in one's child's education, for a <b>parent,</b> <b>might</b> be {{in the form of}} an education voucher, a vote in the running of a school, influence on the school curriculum, or a generalised 'right' to have a child educated in line with one's own values.|$|R
5000|$|Exosystem: Involves {{links between}} a social {{setting in which}} the {{individual}} does not have an active role and the individual's immediate context. For example, a parent's or child's experience at home may be influenced by the other parent's experiences at work. The <b>parent</b> <b>might</b> receive a promotion that requires more travel, which might increase conflict with the other parent and change patterns of interaction with the child.|$|R
60|$|Jo {{hardly knew}} her own MS. again, so {{crumpled}} and underscored were its pages and paragraphs, but feeling as a tender <b>parent</b> <b>might</b> on {{being asked to}} cut off her baby's legs in order that it might fit into a new cradle, {{she looked at the}} marked passages and {{was surprised to find that}} all the moral reflections--which she had carefully put in as ballast for much romance--had been stricken out.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1996, Marshall University {{sociology}} professor Dr. William Westbrook was {{having a conversation with}} a recent Master's graduate. [...] The graduate inquired about Marshall's traditional admissions policy, which had a lower SAT/ACT apparent requirement than his undergraduate school, Shepherd University, with a [...] "selective" [...] admissions policy and higher SAT/ACT apparent requirement. The graduate made an incorrect inference from the averages and thought Shepherd was arbitrarily turning new students away below a higher fixed ACT or SAT score. Dr. Westbrook clarified the situation first by explaining that every university or college is going to meet its enrollment quota with the best students available, and asked where both Marshall University and Shepherd University got their students. Marshall typically recruited from Cabell, Logan, Wayne, and Putnam Counties, WV, and Lawrence County, OH. Shepherd typically recruited both from West Virginia, both locally in the Eastern Panhandle and in the interior of and elsewhere in the state, and from the comparatively wealthy Maryland and Virginia suburbs surrounding Washington D.C. Dr. Westbrook made the point that SAT and ACT scores are an indirect measure of socioeconomic status. [...] County kindergarten to twelfth-grade school boards are funded by property taxes assessed on home values. [...] At nearly the end of grade school, a college-bound student takes the SAT or ACT. The difference between Shepherd University and Marshall University is that Shepherd recruited more from areas whose home values were higher, whose homeowners paid more in property taxes, whose school systems were better funded, and whose students benefitted as a result, took the SAT or ACT, some of whom applied to Shepherd University and were accepted, and attended. Colleges and universities, then, have less control over setting their ACT and SAT requirements than the graduate assumed and than most <b>parents</b> <b>might</b> imagine. [...] Parents need to understand that large scale political and economic forces such as the level of Federal employment and commensurate income around Washington, or other regional differences in living standards, have more to do setting ACT and SAT requirements than the decisions of college committees trying to enroll the best students they can under the circumstances over which they have no control.|$|E
60|$|Yes, it was clear. The gypsy {{woman had}} kept her word, and had taken her revenge. She had stolen the child, and had placed the boot where it would attract attention, in order that the <b>parents</b> <b>might</b> know the hand that struck them.|$|E
60|$|He {{had given}} little heed {{as to how}} the princess's <b>parents</b> <b>might</b> be found, because he {{believed}} that would prove an exceedingly simple task. He had only to go to the railroad station in the morning, and there deliver the child to her mother, who, as a matter of course, would be in waiting.|$|E
6000|$|... "My son? My son?" [...] queried Mr. Porter, {{like one}} in a dream. [...] "Can this be true?" [...] He gazed unsteadily at Dave. Then {{he closed his eyes}} and went off into a dead faint. The youth was startled, for he saw that his <b>parent</b> <b>might</b> be dying. His hand was hurt and he had {{scratches}} on his ear, and one knee of his trousers was blood-stained.|$|R
5000|$|... "Whose is Whose is Whose": contestants were {{introduced}} to four children and four adults, and had to guess which adult was which child's father. To help, the children and parents were sometimes asked to do things such as jump {{up in the air}} (ostensibly because a child and his <b>parent</b> <b>might</b> jump in a similar style). McAllister adopted a silly pseudonym for this segment as well, calling himself either Chuck Chuckles or Chuck Roast.|$|R
50|$|In France, Bennett was {{surprised}} to find that the masters of rose hybridisation did not practice deliberate hybridisation through controlled pollination, but rather raised the seeds resulting from natural pollination, which meant that while the seed <b>parent</b> <b>might</b> be known, the pollen parent never was. He also saw that he was fighting an uphill battle with the cool damp English climate, which did not provide enough summer heat to ripen rose hips.|$|R
60|$|And the {{two boys}} and the girl dashed down into the valley as fast as their legs could carry them. There was no desire in their {{youthful}} hearts to be made younger than they were. And for fear that their <b>parents</b> <b>might</b> think it well that they should commence their careers anew, they {{never said a word}} about finding the Dryad-tree.|$|E
60|$|Joe {{was quite}} as well {{pleased with the}} {{surroundings}} as was his companion; but he said less on the subject because his mind was fully occupied with thoughts of the princess,--sad thoughts they were, for {{he was beginning to}} believe he had been wickedly selfish in taking her away from the place where her <b>parents</b> <b>might</b> have been found, simply to save himself from arrest.|$|E
60|$|A thought {{comes over}} her which makes her blush and turn from herself--her <b>parents</b> <b>might</b> keep the annuity--the curate would marry her {{and give a}} home to her and the boy. But George's picture and dearest memory are there to rebuke her. Shame and love {{say no to the}} sacrifice. She shrinks from it as from {{something}} unholy, and such thoughts never found a resting-place in that pure and gentle bosom.|$|E
3000|$|... {{also depends}} on {{purchased}} goods x, a <b>parent</b> <b>might</b> renounce to some child care time in favour of paid work time, thus increasing child utility by increasing expenditure on x. However, if an exogenous variable negatively affects child care time and has no positive impacts on market labour time of both partner, {{then there would be}} an unquestionable negative impact on child welfare. We apply this line of reasoning to understand the transmission mechanism of the effects of alcohol consumption on child welfare.|$|R
40|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 20 th century, a <b>parent</b> <b>might</b> have considered themselves to have done a good job if their children were clean, housed, fed and healthy. At {{the beginning}} of the 21 st, this had expanded to include the provision of advanced education in the "right" school, prolonged financial support, detailed psychological encouragement and personal fulfilment. With the bar set so high, {{is it any wonder that}} parenting advice has become such a wildly successful publishing phenomenon...|$|R
50|$|Recounting his {{observations}} of the children’s families, Kanner noted {{the high level of}} intelligence characterizing parents and relatives, {{while at the same time}} asserting that there were few warm-hearted parents among the families he observed. He suggested that <b>parenting</b> <b>might</b> contribute to the development of autism, but he also balanced this suggestion with the observation that the aloneness of these children was present very early on, making it unlikely that the whole picture of the disorder was the result of parenting.|$|R
