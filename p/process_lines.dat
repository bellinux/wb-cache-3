5000|$|A series {{heating cable}} {{is made of}} a run of {{high-resistance}} wire, insulated and often enclosed in a protective jacket. It is powered at a specific voltage and the resistance heat of the wire creates heat. The downside {{of these types of}} heaters is that if they are crossed over themselves they can overheat and burn out, they are provided in specific lengths and cannot be shortened in the field, also, a break anywhere along the line will result in a failure of the entire cable. The upside is that they are typically inexpensive (if plastic style heaters) or, as is true with mineral insulated heating cables, they can be exposed to very high temperatures. Mineral insulated heating cables are good for maintaining high temperatures on <b>process</b> <b>lines</b> or maintaining lower temperatures on lines which can get extremely hot such as high temperature steam lines.|$|E

30|$|For storing {{refrigerated}} gasses like ammonia, {{maintenance of}} systems {{in which these}} gasses are used is very important. Since ammonia is a pungent, cryogenic, and corrosive refrigerated liquid, several problems are encountered in systems {{in which it is}} used. For example, ammonia has a low boiling point (− 33  °C), so the <b>process</b> <b>lines</b> should be able to prevent temperature variations. Therefore, special methods are needed to purge ammonia from the <b>process</b> <b>lines.</b> Based on this demand, Shi et al.

In this work, air was used to purge the ammonia from the storage system. However, the air was introduced into the system by a device that increased the operation cost.

In these studies, ammonia was treated using urea, which was introduced by a dosing system.|$|E

However, different projects may require different processes. Defining a separate process for each potential project context is expensive and error-prone, since these processes must simultaneously evolve in a consistent manner. Moreover, an organization cannot envision all possible project contexts in advance because several variables may be involved, and these may also be combined in different ways. This problem is even worse in small companies since they usually cannot afford to define more than one process.

Further extension of the model with first-order chemical reactions to account for microbial deactivation was demonstrated.

40|$|BIM and the {{implementation}} of a lossless digital building process cause a huge change for all involved parties. To create a lean data content along the <b>process</b> <b>line</b> it is essential to identify "who needs what kind of data, in which format at what time?" Reverse Process Design (RPD) is able to answer this question by starting with the data which the information recipient needs out of the BIM process. The recipients can very precisely identify their specific need for data, format and the most appropriate time to receive these. Having identified the necessary result, it is easy to define and locate timely the required action to solve this specific data need or process weakness in a perfect manner. Like in a reverse backwards jumping process the solution of this specific need creates footprints along the building <b>process</b> <b>line</b> such as: "To get information X in a specific format at time A, process Y must start at time B, which again calls for another necessary action Z at time C, ahead of B". By iteratively solving all process weaknesses along the complete building <b>process</b> <b>line</b> and implementing it into a Reference Building Process Map (RBPM) this method creates step by step a very slim adapted process baseline backing up all lessons learned. It continuously defines the need for data to be handled inside a central database at the lowest possible scale in terms of lean construction. By improving the baseline process step by step it creates "Quick Wins" increasing the motivation for a continuous improvement.
