40|$|The <b>pea</b> <b>moth</b> Cydia nigricana Fabricius (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) has {{developed}} {{to an important}} pest in pea growing areas (green and grain peas) causing high economic damage. Currently no effective pest control options are available under organic farming conditions. The presented project aims to generate a first draft of <b>pea</b> <b>moth</b> control in organic farming including a risk assessment of <b>pea</b> <b>moth</b> damage incidence and a direct control approach. Data collection for risk evaluation were arranged for three years (2006 – 2008) in two exemplary pea growing areas in Germany (North Hessen and Central Sachsen). In a small plot experiment in Northern Hessen the combined effect of a pyrethroid product (Spruzit-Neu®, W. Neudorff GmbH KG, Emmerthal, Germany) and different sowing dates using three common green pea cultivars (Avola, Deltafon, Ambassador) on C. nigricana were investigated. In 2006, the coincidence avoidance of flowering pea plants and flight activity of C. nigricana via alternative sowing dates resulted in reduced <b>pea</b> <b>moth</b> infestation. The pyrethroid showed significant <b>pea</b> <b>moth</b> reduction using early sowing dates (Avola, Deltafon). However, the results have to be confirmed in continuative experiments in 2007 and 2008. ...|$|E
40|$|Fraßschäden des Erbsenwicklers Cydia nigricana (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) verursachen im Anbau von Gemüse- und Saaterbsen erhebliche wirtschaftliche Schäden. Im Gemüseerbsenanbau waren in ganzen Regionen Erbsenflächen aufgrund der Überschreitung der Toleranzschwelle von 0, 5 % angefressenen Erbsen nicht vermarktungsfähig. Im Saaterbsenanbau verursacht C. nigricana verminderte Keim- und Triebkraft, das Anhaften von Unkrautsamen am Saatgut und Mykosen wie Ascochyta und Fusarium. Zur Befallsreduzierung wurden in den Versuchsjahren 2004 - 2006 Untersuchungen zum Einsatz von Pheromon zur Paarungsstörung des Schädlings durchgeführt. Pea {{production}} in Germany has increased and <b>pea</b> <b>moth</b> (Cydia nigricana, Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) {{has become a}} serious problem. To reduce the damage 200 g synthetic pheromon E 8,E 10 -dodecandienylacetat / ha were used for mating disruption. The 3 year trial included couples of treatment and control with respected similar damage rating and field design. Pheromone loss in field dispensers was evaluated by extraction and subsequent analytical composition measurement; release rates from such dispensers was also analyzed under lab conditions in windtunnels by gravimetric analysis and head space sampling. The effect of mating disruption {{was measured by the}} ratio of <b>pea</b> <b>moth</b> larva and damaged peas per pod. The picking of peas was on the BBCH stage 79 in a 6 x 6 plots/pattern with 100 pods from each. All pheromone fields showed about 31 % lower damage rates than there reference plots. To assess the limiting factors in the use of pheromones, cages with agro-net were tested in pheromone treated and control pea fields. The boxes were placed in the field before the first flight day of <b>pea</b> <b>moth.</b> Single hedged males and females were set free in the box. The efficacy in reducing <b>pea</b> <b>moth</b> damage was on average 78 %, while the samples of the surrounding pea fields showed only a reduction of 49 %. Analyses of spermatophores from females caught on transects showed also in far distances from pea field a high percentage of mated females. That seems to be the main problem of mating disruption of C. nigricana...|$|E
40|$|The <b>pea</b> <b>moth</b> (Cydia nigricana) has {{developed}} {{to the most}} serious pest in organic green peas in recent years. In 2003 about 20 % of the contracted acreage needed to be rejected by the processing industry, due to the very low tolerance levels requiring at least 99, 5 % (w/w) non affected high quality peas. The present study investigated the influence of different sowing dates on the damage level in green peas. In a small scale field experiment arranged in a complete randomized block design with four replicates three common cultivars suitable for early, mid and late sowings, namely Avola, Gonzo, Trompet, respectively, were utilized. Each variety was sown at an early and a late date, resulting in six sowing dates at total, covering the entire sowing period from mid March to mid May. Subsamples of 3 x 1, 5 m 2 /plot were harvested by threshing and <b>pea</b> <b>moth</b> related infestation was assessed {{as the percentage of}} damaged peas. Crop phenology was recorded in weekly inspections. Flight activity of male moths was monitored twice a week by pheromone traps. As a result, only the early sowing dates revealed damage levels below the required threshold of 0, 5 %. Green peas sown after mid of April where increasingly affected, approaching 3 - 6 % damaged peas. Damage was closely related to the coincidence in time of a) flowering and the onset of maturing pods with b) the phenology of monitored pea moths. The onset of flowering did not depend only on the sowing date but also on the respective pea cultivar. As registered C. nigricana-control options are lacking as present, the described strategy of coincidence avoidance in combination with fast maturing cultivars appears to be the most suitable contribution in reducing the risk of <b>pea</b> <b>moth</b> attack in organic green peas...|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} mixed {{cropping}} semi-leafless peas with linseed dodder (Camelina sativa (L.) Crtz.) on weed development and pest incidence {{was investigated in}} small plot experiments in Northern Hessen, Germany, over two years. Mixed cropping peas together with linseed dodder had a significant suppressive effect on weed-coverage, in average 62 % efficacy in 2003 and 54 % in 2004, compared to mono cropped peas. The infestation level of pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum) and the damage incidence of <b>pea</b> <b>moth</b> (Cydia nigricana) in harvested peas, was neither significantly reduced nor enhanced. In both years mixed cropping peas gained a relative surplus in yield compared to peas grown as a sole crop. The results demonstrate the advantageous complementary use of environmental resources in grain peas by the companion crop C. sativa and its antagonistic effect towards weed development...|$|E
40|$|The {{infestation}} of peas by aphids and moths {{was assessed}} in winter pea sole crops and compared to spring pea sole and winter pea-triticale intercrops. The field experiments {{were conducted in}} Northern Germany in the growing seasons 2009 - 2011. The maximum number of pea aphids per plant {{and the percentage of}} attacked plants were lower in semi-leafless and normal-leafed winter pea sole crops than in semi-leafless spring peas. <b>Pea</b> <b>moth</b> larvae damaged 6 - 32 % of seeds in winter peas and 40 - 55 % of seeds in spring peas. Winter pea-triticale intercropping reduced the attack of pea aphids, whereas no beneficial effect of intercropping was observed concerning moth-damaged peas. Owing to the earlier maturity, winter peas were less susceptible to pea pest attacks than spring peas. Winter-pea intercropping is a partially effective method for pest control in peas...|$|E
40|$|Synthetic sex {{pheromone}} of the <b>pea</b> <b>moth</b> Cydia nigricana, (E,E) - 8, 10 -dodecadien- 1 -yl acetate (E 8,E 10 - 12 :Ac), {{was applied}} in a 3 -ha pea field {{at a rate}} of 17 g/ha, in two different dispenser formulations. Aerial concentrations within pea canopy, as determined by a field electroantennogram (EAG) apparatus, were 2 and 3 ng/m(3) in the two dispenser treatments. The validity of the EAG measurements was corroborated by sampling of field air, followed by gas chromatographic quantification of E 8,E 10 - 12 :Ac. Males were attracted to fresh dispensers releasing E 8,E 10 - 12 :Ac plus less than 2 % of the antagonistic E, Z; Z, E; and Z, Z isomers. Two days after placement, the proportion of these isomers had increased to 6 %. Males were then no longer attracted to the dispensers, but were observed to fly out of the treated field. Male attraction to calling females was almost entirely suppressed, and attraction to traps baited with synthetic pheromone was significantly reduced. Larval infestation in the pheromone-treated field was 2 %, compared to 36 % in a control field...|$|E
40|$|The <b>pea</b> <b>moth</b> (Cydia nigricana, Lep. Tortricidae) has {{developed}} {{to a serious}} pest {{in various parts of}} Germany, particularly in organic vegetable peas and protein seed peas. The prospects of mating disruption (MD-control) utilizing synthetic C. nigricana sex- pheromone were investigated in field trials in 2004 - 2006. Objectives were to gather basic technical data concerning the dispenser material, field dosage and evaporation rates under field conditions in commercial pea stands, re-spectively. Pheromone-treated and untreated fields of at least 2 ha were compared pairwise concerning the percentage of infested pea pods at green picking stage, age structure of larvae and final infestation rates in harvested material. In addition in 2005 and 2006 cages were placed in the centre of pheromone-treated and untreated fields. Cellulose dispensers (600 ha- 1) loaded with a total of 200 g E 8, E 10 -dodekadien- 1 -yl- acetat ha- 1) were hung manually on pea main shoots before moth flight activity com-menced, monitored with Tripheron®-monitoring delta traps. A few days after applica-tion unmated pairs of moths were introduced into the treated and untreated cages to assess the same infestation parameters as in the open surrounding pea field.

40|$|Lentil {{is one of}} the world’s most {{important}} food plants and is particularly so in North Africa and South Asia and parts of North America, Europe and Australia. Consequently the crop is exposed to a broad spectrum of insect species {{in a wide variety of}} locations. The management of insect pests of the crop is crucial to optimizing production. The major insect pests of lentil in the field are aphids (Aphis craccivora & Acyrthosiphonpisum), leaf weevils (Sitona spp.), Lygus bugs, (Lygusspp.), and the Cutworm, (Agrotis ipsilon). Several other insect species are considered as minor field pests which are also noteworthy and include Thrips (Thrips, Kakothrips, & Frankiniella), Bud weevils (Apionarrogans), the <b>pea</b> <b>moth,</b> (Cydia nigricana), pod borers, (Helicoverpa armigera & Heliothis spp.), Lima-bean pod borer, (Etiella zinckenella), root aphids (Smynthurodes betae) and leaf miners (Liriomyza spp. and Phytomyza spp.). The most serious and frequently encountered insect pests of the stored grain are Bruchus ervi and B. lentis with Callosobruchus chinensis and C. maculatus also widespread. This chapter describes the morphology, lifecycle and crop damage caused by each of the insects pest species on lentil and provides detailed descriptions of management options for each species with references for each recommended action. For most insect species the use of pesticides is the primary management option. However, for some species, there are known sources of host plant resistance, as well as other integrated pest management options including biological control (e. g., beneficial insect predators and biological pesticides) and cultural practices, that can be used to help manage the pests and where known these are also described...|$|E
40|$|Plant {{protection}} in arable and horticultural production {{was one of}} the central topics for research in the Federal Programme for Organic Agriculture. Since 2002, 53 projects have been carried out on this subject. After several status quo analyses (2002 - 2004), methods for control and prevention of pests and diseases were further developed and adapted to organic farming conditions. Focus areas included copper replacement, resistant varieties and improved cultivation methods. Plant health issues were also addressed in various speciality crops where pests and diseases often lead to the need to import produce from other European countries (e. g. Brussels sprouts), as domestic production cannot cover the ever-increasing demand; in this area, several projects were set up to improve growing conditions and establish new methods for plant protection. One important focus was the control of downy mildew, particularly in organic onion cultivation. In this case insights from conventional farming were adapted to organic farming conditions, e. g. in the control of downy mildew in summer onion cultivation. The growing risk of the occurrence of downy mildew in organic onion cultivation could be further reduced through the use of new, mildew-resistant varieties. New alternatives to the use of copper, such as plant extracts of sage and liquorice or microbial preparations with Aneurinibacillus migulanus demonstrated a significant reduction of infestation in onion and cucumber. In organic potatoes, primary stem infection by late blight (Phytophthora infestans) was significantly reduced by seed dressing using small amounts of copper (120 g/ha, compared to higher amounts that would be needed for a foliar treatments in the field); this led to yields increases by up to 55 %. Alternative pesticides were tested against the <b>pea</b> <b>moth</b> (Cydia nigricana); here, a pyrethroid formulation showed variable effects and Spruzit-Neu® was unable to reduce pest infestation at high insect densities. The use of beneficial insects and other cultural methods was extensively studied. Covering Brussels sprouts with fine-meshed nets from the time of transplanting until the end of October achieved a 77 % reduction in the infestation with cabbage whitefly (Aleyrodes proletella) during the main infestation period in September. In field trials with point releases of the parasitic wasp Encarsia tricolor, parasitism was up to 50 % higher than in the reference without release; bringing the first release forward in time resulted in a significant pest reduction by about 60 %. Studies on the control of carrot fly (Chamaepsila rosae) showed that a major risk factor for infestation is the distance to fields where carrot had been grown in the previous year, and thus field selection offers a major control option. In addition, the research showed that infestation can be limited by growing either early or late sets of carrots. Another project dealt with the natural control of the grain weevil (Sitophilus granarius) by a continuous release of the ectoparasitoid Lariophagus distinguendus in grain stores. This method is intended to be an affordable, easy-to-use and effective alternative to existing release methods.

40|$|Cydia Hübner 1825 is a genus of moths in {{the family}} Tortricidae with 231 named species and {{subspecies}} and is distributed on all continents except Antarctica. As larvae, many species feed within reproductive structures, such as fruits, seeds, and flowers, under bark, or within fleshy stems of at least 65 host-plant species including angiosperms and conifers. Many species, including codling moth, <b>pea</b> <b>moth,</b> spruce seed moth, pine seedworms, filbertworm, and hickory shuckworm are considered pests of agriculture and forestry. As a result, the biology, natural enemies, and pheromones of several species have been well-studied. The nomenclature and classification of Cydia has also been well-studied but is less resolved. Nineteen different genus names have been proposed for species in this genus, with Laspeyresia Hübner, and Carpocapsa Treitschke being in common usage until relatively recently. Following the rules governing the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, Cydia is the valid genus name for all species congeneric with the codling moth, Cydia pomonella (Linnaeus), the type species of the genus. The relationship of Cydia to other genera in the tribe Grapholitini is a topic of continued debate. Some authors {{have suggested that the}} tribe is an evolutionary grade while others have presented evidence that Grapholitini is a monophyletic clade. Although some secondary sexual characters have been proposed, the genus Cydia can claim no synapomorphies that can be found in all Cydia species. To better understand the systematics and evolution of this group more detailed morphological, molecular, and ecological data are needed for non-pest species. At least 21 endemic species of Cydia are known from the Hawaiian Islands. Males of most species have a ventral pouch below the cubital vein of the hindwings similar to C. latiferreana (Walsingham), C. maackiana (Danilevsky), and several other Cydia species to a lesser extent, although this feature appears to have arisen independently in the Hawaiian group. Larvae, where known, feed on endemic plants {{in the family}} Fabaceae. Identification of species is made difficult by extreme polymorphism of wing patterns for some widespread species and a general reduction of morphological features in the genitalia of male moths, while some features of female genitalia, particularly the antrum and lamella postvaginalis, have diagnostic value. Eight new species of Hawaiian Cydia are described (C. mauiensis n. sp., C. velocilimitata n. sp., C. haleakalaensis n. sp., C. makai n. sp., C. koaiae n. sp., C. hawaiiensis n. sp., C. acaciavora n. sp., and C. anomalosa n. sp.) based on wing patterns and features of male and female genitalia. The thirteen previously known species are redescribed because original descriptions were inconsistent among authors and based solely on wing patterns. Distributions, host-plant affinities, and natural enemies for each species are discussed. A molecular phylogeny of 66 specimens representing 14 Hawaiian Cydia species plus 20 outgroup species was constructed using nuclear and mitochondrial DNA to assess the relative importance of host-plant affinities and geographic isolation in their diversification. Hawaiian Cydia is monophyletic and nested well-within the genus. They appear to have arrived in the Hawaiian Islands after the rise of Maui based on the basal position of several Maui and Hawaii Island species throughout the phylogeny. The earliest diverging species feed on Canavalia and dispersed across the high islands. Subsequent shifts to feeding on Sophora chrysophylla then Acacia koa were followed by speciation and the filling of these niches across the islands. The origin of Hawaiian Cydia remains obscure, but appears to be a separate colonization of remote Oceania from Cydia pseusomalesana Clarke in French Polynesia. It is likely that several more species of Hawaiian Cydia await discovery while several others probably have gone extinct in the 100 years since they were first collected. A broader survey of outgroup taxa from Asia and the Americas, and more informative genes in a molecular phylogeny may help resolve the origins of Hawaiian Cydia...|$|E
