40|$|Mental {{workload}} {{has long}} been recognized as {{an important factor in}} human performance in complex systems. It is documented that either overload or underload may degrade human performance. Therefore, system designers need, at an early design phase, some explicit models to predict the mental workload imposed on individuals so that alternatives of system designs can be evaluated. This research aims to develop a practical framework for predicting mental workload in both single- and multi-task environments with particular consideration of individual factors. In order to describe mental workload more precisely and completely, a framework for mental workload definitions, containing instantaneous workload, average workload, accumulated workload, peak workload and overall workload is proposed. In order to model individual factors, two new variables [...] effective workload and ineffective workload [...] are introduced to conceptually model task-generated and individual-generated workloads. Under the conceptual model, the operational models for predicting human mental workload for human-computer interaction tasks are developed. ^ <b>The</b> results <b>of</b> two experimental studies, utilizing 60 subjects, aimed at validating the model, indicated the followings: (1) Average workload, accumulated workload, and instantaneous workload are different from overall workload. Hence, combined use <b>of</b> them describes <b>the</b> workload more precisely. (2) The predictive mental workload model explains 42 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>variances</b> associated with NASA-TLX subjective mental workload ratings and explains 78 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>variances</b> associated with performance time. Hence, the conceptual and operational model for predicting mental workload have been validated. (3) The relationships between the effective/ineffective workload and the four independent variables have not been fully validated. The results showed that both task-related factors and individual-related factors can affect mental workload significantly. (4) Mental workload is significantly affected by time pressure. The workload in self-paced multi-task environment is 29 % lower than the workload in system-paced multi-task environment. The workload in a self-paced, multi-task environment is 19 % lower than the workload in a system-paced, single task environment. ^ The models developed and validated for predicting mental workload can be used by designers to allocate tasks and to increase task performance and job satisfaction. ...|$|R
5000|$|Group {{socialization}} is {{the theory}} that an individual's peer groups, rather than parental figures, are the primary influence of personality and behavior in adulthood. Parental behavior and the home environment has either {{no effect on the}} social development of children, or the effect varies significantly between children. Adolescents spend more time with peers than with parents. Therefore, peer groups have stronger correlations with personality development than parental figures do. For example, twin brothers, whose genetic makeup are identical, will differ in personality because they have different groups of friends, not necessarily because their parents raised them differently. Behavioral genetics suggest that up to fifty <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>variance</b> in adult personality is due to genetic differences. [...] The environment in which a child is raised accounts for only approximately ten percent in the variance of an adult’s personality. As much as twenty <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>variance</b> is due to measurement error. [...] This suggests that only a very small part of an adult’s personality is influenced by factors parents control (i.e. the home environment). Harris claims that while it’s true that siblings don’t have identical experiences in the home environment (making it difficult to associate a definite figure to the variance of personality due to home environments), the variance found by current methods is so low that researchers should look elsewhere to try to account for the remaining variance. Harris also states that developing long-term personality characteristics away from the home environment would be evolutionarily beneficial because future success is more likely to depend on interactions with peers than interactions with parents and siblings. Also, because of already existing genetic similarities with parents, developing personalities outside of childhood home environments would further diversify individuals, increasing their evolutionary success.|$|E

The subjects were 60 women {{ranging in age from}} 24 to 74 and were of varying degrees of adiposity. These subjects had participated in the Women's Nutrition Project each year and were not pregnant and/or lactating between the first year and the fourth year. Factors selected for this study included age, waist/hip ratio, triceps skinfold thickness (TSF), mid-arm circumference (MAC), caloric intake, {{percent of calories from fat}} intake, Eating Anxiety Index, Eating Restraint, report of dieting, reproductive history, activity patterns, exercise fluctuation, Health Practices Index, Satisfaction with Health Practices Index, Satisfaction with Food Intake Index, Holmes and Rahe Life Events Scale, Outlook Index, Importance of Slenderness Index, Husband Involvement Index, and Husband Pressure Index. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to identify correlations between the dependent variables and independent variables in order to aid in determining the appropriate model for subsequent multiple regression determinations. Two sets of multiple regression with and without anthropometric factors were calculated to predict the value of a dependent variable - BMI in year 4, threeyear weight fluctuation, and three-year net weight change - from a group of independent variables. The multiple regression equation revealed that four variables, initial TSF, MAC, waist/hip ratio, and caloric intake in year 1 accounted for 71. 7 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>variance</b> in the final BMI. Initial BMI and Health Practices Index were predictive factors for weight fluctuation and accounted for 27. 8 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>variance</b> in weight fluctuation over three years.

For health care professionals to provide interventions to increase breastfeeding incidence and duration, {{it is essential that}} substantive theory be developed and tested. A correlational descriptive design with causal modeling methodology was utilized. The purposes of the research were three-fold: (1) to examine differences between women who breastfed and bottle-fed; (2) to test Ajzen's theory of planned behavior with a group of 138 breast and bottle-feeding mothers; and (3) to test a model based on the theory to increase explanation in behavior in terms of early experiences and duration of breastfeeding (n = 148). Measures based on the theory, Cuson's Attitudes on Breastfeeding Scale, the Breastfeeding Experience Scale, Hughes Breastfeeding Support Scale, and a demographic questionnaire were used for data collection. Women were contacted in their final weeks of pregnancy, shortly following birth, and for those breastfeeding, four to six weeks postpartum. Data analysis included: use of descriptive, parametric, and nonparametric statistics to examine group differences; psychometric testing; and multiple linear and logistic regression, as well as residual analysis, to test the models. Results indicated {{significant differences between the two}} groups of women on major demographic variables and some model variables. The theory of planned behavior reduced to its predecessor, the theory of reasoned action, and with respecification resulted in a model containing additional variables; previous breastfeeding experience and family income.

(R 2 = 90 percent and R 2 = 85 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> systematic <b>variance</b> {{is explained by}} community effects for nonsurgical and surgical discharges, respectively.) <b>The</b> ranking <b>of</b> communities by {{discharge rates}} is stable {{over a five-year period}} (Spearman rho = 0. 78 for nonsurgical discharges and 0. 72 for surgical discharges). Surgical discharge rates decreased substantially (4 percent per year) over this time period, while nonsurgical rates showed no consistent pattern. Communities with exceptional discharge rates showed no substantial or significant regression toward the mean through the five-year study...|$|R
40|$|Many {{research}} had shown person fit indices might {{be influenced by}} <b>the</b> factor <b>of</b> test length on their detection rates <b>of</b> aberrant responses. <b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> {{this study was to}} examine test length effects on the BW aberrance indices. Three conditions were designed in this study: test length (K, including 25, 50, 100, and 200 items), ability ratio (T/K, defined as the total person score divided by test length K), and error ratio (E/K, defined as <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> errors within ability level divided by test length). Four 100 -person times varying-item data matrices (100 x 25, 100 x 50, 100 x 100, and 100 x 200) were randomly generated and permuted 500 times for each data matrix through 20 repeats. Results showed that after partialling out <b>the</b> factors <b>of</b> E/K and T/K, <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> test length on the association between the two indices was very slight. In nonlinear regression analyses, E/K and T/K can predict more than 76 and 73 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>variances</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> B index and that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> W index, respectively, but test length with both very slight contributions on them. Furthermore, a very good model fit generated from SEM analyses also showed <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> test length on the B and W indices were very tiny. All these pieces <b>of</b> evidence endorsed <b>the</b> B and W indices were robust with test length...|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> {{technique}} <b>of</b> linear prediction filtering is used {{to create}} filters relating solar wind parameters to the Dst index and to the polar cap potential. <b>The</b> square root <b>of</b> solar wind dynamic pressure and the solar wind electric field together are found to account for nearly 70 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dst <b>variance.</b> <b>The</b> prediction filter for the polar cap potential requires <b>the</b> square <b>of</b> <b>the</b> solar wind velocity and the solar wind electric field as inputs. The results suggest that both polar cap potential and ring current injection are primarily controlled by the solar wind, and that substorm expansions do not {{play a major role}} in ring current injection...|$|R
