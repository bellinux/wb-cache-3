In this paper, we propose a fault tolerant reversible 4 -Bit binary counter with <b>parallel</b> <b>load.</b> This is a robust and first attempt for designing a fault tolerant reversible 4 -Bit binary counter with <b>parallel</b> <b>load.</b> Counters are important components in computers. Most counters are synchronous in computer systems. Some of these counters can also be made from D-Flip Flops. Counters can be designed to generate any desired sequence of states. The sequence may follow the binary count or may be any other arbitrary sequence. In this study, we propose three approaches of the fault tolerant reversible circuits for 4 -Bit binary counter with <b>parallel</b> <b>load.</b> Total logical calculation and Total quantum cost of the second approach is less than the previous approaches.

5000|$|The [...] "multiple-tuned flattop antenna" [...] is {{a variant}} of the T antenna used in high power low {{frequency}} transmitters to reduce ground power losses. [...] It consists of a long capacitive top-load consisting of multiple parallel wires supported by a line of transmission towers, sometimes several miles long. Several vertical radiator wires hang down from the top-load, each attached to its own ground through a loading coil. The antenna is driven either at one of the radiator wires, or more often {{at one end of the}} top-load, by bringing the wires of the top-load diagonally down to the transmitter. Although the vertical wires are separated, the distance between them is small compared to the length of the LF waves, so the currents in them are in phase and they can be considered as one radiator. Since the antenna current flows into the ground through N <b>parallel</b> <b>loading</b> coils and grounds rather than one, the equivalent loading coil and ground resistance, and therefore the power dissipated in the loading coil and ground, is reduced to 1/N that of a simple T antenna. [...] The antenna was used in the powerful radio stations of the wireless telegraphy era but has fallen out of favor due to the expense of multiple loading coils.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A 3 -axis <b>parallel</b> <b>loading</b> mechanism, {{which works}} as a {{multi-axis}} load simulator, is proposed for reliability test of multi-axis CNC machine tools by exerting specific load spectrums on the spindle. To achieve efficient loading force control, dynamic model of the 3 -DOF translational parallel robot is derived via the virtual work principle and is embedded into the control strategy to build a model-based control scheme. A mass distribution factor is introduced and the rotating inertia of the limbs is neglected to simplify the dynamics equations for better real-time control performance. This simplification method is verified by comparison with the complete dynamics model. Then the simplified dynamic model is integrated with a PI (proportional–integral) controller with feedforward to control the moving platform’s output force in the task space and this control strategy is verified through co-simulations with MATLAB/Simulink and ADAMS.
