Reiche and Saulcy (1858) properly synonymized G. costalis under G. elongata, but erroneously placed two sibling species of tamarisk beetles, G. carinata Faldermann (1837) (the larger tamarisk beetle, Diorhabda carinata) and G. sublineata Lucas (1849) (the subtropical tamarisk beetle, Diorhabda sublineata) as junior synonyms of G. elongata. Weise (1893) created the genus Diorhabda and erroneously placed the sibling species G. carinulata Desbrochers (1870) (the northern tamarisk beetle, Diorhabda carinulata) as a junior synonym of Diorhabda elongata. Berti and Rapilly (1973) recognized D. carinata and D. carinulata as separate species from one another, and, by implication, as separate species from D. elongata, based on detailed morphology of the endophallus of the male genitalia. Tracy and Robbins (2009) confirmed the findings of Berti and Rapilly (1973), characterized {{the male and female}} genitalia of D. elongata, recognized D. sublineata as a separate species from D. elongata, and provided illustrated taxonomic keys separating the MTB from the four other sibling species of the D. elongata (Brullé) species group: Diorhabda carinata, Diorhabda sublineata, Diorhabda carinulata, and Diorhabda meridionalis Berti and Rapilly. In literature prior to 2009, D. carinata, D. sublineata, and D. carinulata were usually also referred to as D. elongata, or subspecies of D. elongata.|$|E

40|$|A first-order {{triangulation}} of Greece {{was carried}} out in the 1890 s, Reoccupation, using Global Positioning System receivers, of 46 of the 93 original markers yielded estimates of the deformation of the region over the intervening interval. Broad regions have similar geodetic strain over the 100 -year time span. Strain north of the Gulf of Korinthos is predominantly north-south extension, though with a significant east-west component. The central <b>Peloponnisos</b> is relatively stable, whereas the gulfs of the southern <b>Peloponnisos</b> are all characterized by uniaxial east-west extension. The seismic expression of strain for the entire region, calculated from the seismic moment tensors of earthquakes of M-s {{greater than or equal to}} 5. 8 during the past 100 years, accounts for only 20 - 50 % of the geodetically determined strain. At a scale of 50 - 100 km, the fraction of the strain that is expressed seismically varies much more than this range. In particular, whereas seismic strain in the eastern Gulf of Korinthos over the past 100 years is commensurate with the geodetic strain, there is rapid extension across the western Gulf of Korinthos (similar to 0. 3 mu strain yr(- 1)), with negligible seismic strain for the 100 year period prior to 1992. The Egion earthquake of June 1995 in the western Gulf of Korinthos released only a small proportion (less than or equal to 20 %) of the elastic strain that had accumulated in that region. The observed distribution of displacements can be explained by the relative rotation of two plates with a broad accommodation zone between them, but it is equally consistent with the deformation that would be expected of a sheet of fluid moving toward a low-pressure boundary at the Hellenic Trench. A simple calculation implies that if the region does behave as a fluid, then its effective viscosity is similar to 10 (22) - 10 (23) Pa s. Such viscosities are consistent with the deformation of a lithosphere obeying a rheological law similar to that obtained for olivine in the laboratory...|$|E
30|$|Therefore, {{waterway}} {{networks and}} especially these {{of the sea}} provided {{at the time the}} comparative growth advantage. Especially for the case of Greece, it is pointed out that in 1832 the wheat of Tripoli (in <b>Peloponnisos)</b> was more expensive at the neighbouring port of Nafplio, than the Odessa wheat, due to the differentiation in transportation costs and more specifically, because of the relative lack of terrestrial transport networks and furthermore the difficult and costly freight transport through the mainland [5]. Therefore we can realize of the development bloom of the Greek islands’ area of the time, compared with the mainland. The Merchant Marine and all the related and complementary activities, was the basis of the economic growth of the free Aegean area, which was integrated and operating in a globalized economy. After the 1830 liberalization and until the end of this decade, the commercial traffic increased by 194  % [5].|$|E

40|$|Summary. The {{notion of}} ` {{megalopolis}} ’ is used, follow ing Gottmann, {{as a metaphor}} adopted from the ancient Greek city of Megalopolis situated {{at the heart of}} the <b>Peloponnisos</b> peninsula, to describe a linearly stretch ed system of urban agglom eration s showing dense and intensi ® ed land uses and activitie s, and strong internal lineal socio-economic ties manifested by the movement of people, goods and information.

A megalopolis is also perceived as an innovation-stimulating environment, and its metropolitan region s serve as the hard core of their region ’ s post-industrial and post-modern activitie s and life-styl es. Megalopolitan processe s, de ® ned along the Israeli coast in early 1980 s, have gained momentum since the 1990 s as a result of Israel ’ s entry into the post-industrial age and its expanding links with the global economy. It is assumed that if the emerging megalopolitan processe s are successfu lly diffused into the coastal region s of neighbouring countries in peacetime, they might create, in the long run, an extended megalopoli-tan region along the east coast of the Mediterran ean sea to evolve as the ` backbone ’ of a peacefu l ` New ’ Middle East...|$|E

40|$|RrS 1 -like {{sequences}} of water frogs (genus Pelophylax) display varied genomic organization, whereas the centromeric hybridization pattern reveals species-specific differences. Using fluorescent in situ hybridization, Pelophylax cf. bedriagae, Pelophylax kurtmuelleri, and Pelophylax ridibundus showed a hybridization signal at centromeres of chromosomes 1 - 5, but in P. kurtmuelleri the medium-small chromosome labeled was 10 rather than 8. Pelophylax cretensis had almost 16 of 26 centromeres labeled, as did Pelophylax lessonae from Poland when its chromosomes are hybridized with a homologous probe. When StuI-digested genomic DNA was hybridized with RrS 1 probe, hybridization ladders for P. ridibundus from Poland have evenly spaced steps (about 100 bp) of uniform intensity from about 200 bp upward. Steps in hybridization ladders from circum-Aegean taxa vary in intensity: larger, odd-numbered steps are often fainter. A strong double band (800 / 900 bp) in Anatolian P. cf. bedriagae, emphasized by a weak 700 bp band, distinguishes them from P. kurtmuelleri from the <b>Peloponnisos,</b> {{in which the}} 900 bp band is almost absent. The ladder in P. cretensis lacks odd-numbered steps. A and B repeats, observed originally within the RrS 1 satellite of P. ridibundus, occur also in the circum-Aegean frogs and in P. lessonae, Pelophylax epeiroticus, Pelophylax saharicus, and Pelophylax shqipericus. It is plausible that AB dimers or ABB trimers rather than A or B monomers correspond to functional/evolutionary units. The presence of regions similar to yeast CDEs and mammalian CENP-B boxes suggests a role for RrS 1 sequences in centromere organization...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{integrates}} {{two independent}} studies of numeric morphology-based alpha-taxonomy of the cryptic ant species Temnothorax crassispinus (Karavajev, 1926) and T. crasecundus sp. n. conducted by different investigators, using different equipment, considering different character combinations and evaluating different samples. Samples investigated included 603 individual workers from 203 nests – thereof 104 nest samples measured by Seifert and 99 by Csösz. The material originated from Europe, Asia Minor and Caucasia. There {{was a very}} strong interspecific overlap in any of the 29 shape characters recorded and subjective expert determination failed in many cases. Primary classification hypotheses were formed by the exploratory data analysis Nest Centroid (NC) clustering and corrected to final species hypotheses by an iterative linear discriminant analysis algorithm. The evaluation of Seifert’s and Csösz’s data sets arrived at fully congruent conclusions. NC-Ward and NC-K-means clustering disagreed from the final species hypothesis in only 1. 9 and 1. 9 % of the samples in Seifert’s data set and by 1. 1 and 2. 1 % in Csösz’s data set which is a strong argument for heterospecificity. The type series of T. crassispinus and T. crasecundus sp. n. were allocated to different clusters with p = 0. 9851 and p = 0. 9912 respectively. The type series of the junior synonym T. slavonicus (Seifert, 1995) was allocated to the T. crassispinus cluster with p = 0. 9927. T. crasecundus sp. n. and T. crassispinus are parapatric species with a long contact zone stretching from the <b>Peloponnisos</b> peninsula across Bulgaria northeast to the southern Ukraine. There is no indication for occurrence of interspecifically mixed nests or intraspecific polymorphism. However, a significant reduction of interspecific morphological distance at sites with syntopic occurrence of both species indicates local hybridization.

40|$|International audienceThe {{feasibility}} of an earthquake early warning Shield in Greece is being explored as a European demonstration project. This {{will be the}} first early warning system in Europe. The island of Revithoussa is a liquid natural gas storage facility near Athens from which a pipeline runs to a gas distribution centre in Athens. The Shield is being centred on these facilities. The purpose here is to analyze seismicity and seismic hazard in relation to the Shield centre and the remote sensor sites in the Shield network, eventually to help characterize the hazard levels, seismic signals and ground vibration levels that might be observed or create an alert situation at a station. Thus this paper mainly gives estimation of local seismic hazard in the regional working area of Revithoussa by studying extreme peak ground acceleration (PGA) and magnitudes. Within the Shield region, the most important zone to be detected is WNW from the Shield centre and is at a relatively short distance (50 km or less), the Gulf of Corinth (active normal faults) region. This is the critical zone for early warning of strong ground shaking. A second key region of seismicity is at an intermediate distance (100 km or more) from the centre, the Hellenic seismic zone south or southeast from <b>Peloponnisos.</b> A third region to be detected would be the northeastern region from the centre and is at a relatively long distance (about 150 km), Lemnos Island and neighboring region. Several parameters are estimated to characterize the seismicity and hazard. These include: the 50 -year PGA with 90 % probability of not being exceeded (pnbe) using Theodulidis & Papazachos strong motion attenuation for Greece, PGA NTP; the 50 -year magnitude and also at the 90 % pnbe, M 50 and M P 50, respectively. There are also estimates of the earthquake that is most likely to be felt at a damaging intensity level, these are the most perceptible earthquakes at intensities VI, VII and VIII with magnitudes M VI, M VII and M VIII. Example results (from many) include the corresponding parameters describing the hazard for Revithoussa as follows: PGA NTP : 203 cm s - 2, M 50 : 6. 5, M p 50 : 6. 9, M VI : 5. 8, M VII : 6. 1 and M VIII : 6. 4. These data are also useful in selecting expected alert-signals i. e. examples of strong ground vibration histories that might be expected at a Shield station in the alert situation...|$|E
