25|$|When dissected, the {{arrangement}} of the cells in a root is root hair, epidermis, epiblem, cortex, endodermis, <b>pericycle</b> and, lastly, the vascular tissue in the centre of a root to transport the water absorbed by the root to other places of the plant.|$|E
25|$|In a {{vascular}} plant, the stele is {{the central}} part of the root or stem containing the tissues derived from the procambium. These include vascular tissue, in some cases ground tissue (pith) and a <b>pericycle,</b> which, if present, defines the outermost boundary of the stele. Outside the stele lies the endodermis, which is the innermost cell layer of the cortex.|$|E
25|$|Dicot stems {{with primary}} growth have pith in the center, with {{vascular}} bundles forming a distinct ring visible when the stem is viewed in cross section. The {{outside of the}} stem is covered with an epidermis, which is covered by a waterproof cuticle. The epidermis also may contain stomata for gas exchange and multicellular stem hairs called trichomes. A cortex consisting of hypodermis (collenchyma cells) and endodermis (starch containing cells) is present above the <b>pericycle</b> and vascular bundles.|$|E
2500|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{striking}} characteristic of roots (that makes it distinguishable from other plant organs such as stem-branches and leaves) is that, roots have an endogenous origin, i.e. [...] it originates and develops from an inner layer of the mother axis (Such as <b>Pericycle).</b> Whereas Stem-branching and leaves (those develop as buds) are exogenous, i.e. start to develop from the cortex, an outer layer.|$|E
2500|$|As in legumes, {{nodulation}} {{is favored}} by nitrogen deprivation and is inhibited by high nitrogen concentrations. Depending {{on the plant}} species, two mechanisms of infection have been described: The first is observed in [...] casuarinas or alders and is called root hair infection. In this case the infection begins with an intracellular infection of a root hair and {{is followed by the}} formation of a primitive symbiotic organ lacking any particular organization, a prenodule. The second mechanism of infection is called intercellular entry and is well described in Discaria species. In this case bacteria penetrate the root extracellularly, growing between epidermal cells then between cortical cells. Later on Frankia becomes intracellular but no prenodule is formed. In both cases the infection leads to cell divisions in the <b>pericycle</b> and the formation of a new organ consisting of several lobes anatomically similar to a lateral root. This organ is the actinorhizal nodule also called actinorhizae. Cortical cells of the nodule are invaded by Frankia filaments coming from the site of infection or the prenodule. Actinorhizal nodules have generally an indeterminate growth, new cells are therefore continually produced at the apex and successively become infected. Mature cells of the nodule are filled with bacterial filaments that actively fix nitrogen.|$|E
50|$|Stage I: The first morphologically {{identifiable}} {{stage is}} the asymmetric division of two {{cells of the}} <b>pericycle,</b> termed <b>pericycle</b> founder cells, which are adjacent to the protoxylem poles and from which the lateral roots are derived entirely. These cells then undergo further division, causing radial expansion.|$|E
50|$|In dicot roots, the <b>pericycle</b> {{strengthens}} {{the roots and}} provides protection for the vascular bundles.|$|E
50|$|The <b>pericycle</b> {{regulates the}} {{formation}} of lateral roots by rapidly dividing near the xylem elements of the root.|$|E
50|$|In dicot stem, the {{vascular}} cambium is completely secondary in origin, and it originates from {{a portion of}} <b>pericycle</b> tissue.|$|E
50|$|Past {{efforts to}} isolate such tissue have been successful. Monocot roots rarely branch, but can, and this branch will {{originate}} from the <b>pericycle.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{angiosperms}} certain molecules {{within the}} endodermis {{and the surrounding}} vasculature are sent to the <b>pericycle</b> which promotes {{the growth of the}} root meristems.|$|E
50|$|The <b>pericycle</b> is a {{cylinder}} of parenchyma or sclerenchyma cells that lies {{just inside the}} endodermis and is the outer most part of the stele of plants.|$|E
50|$|The <b>pericycle</b> {{is located}} between the endodermis and phloem in plant roots. In dicot stems, it is {{situated}} {{around the ring}} of vascular bundles in the stele.|$|E
50|$|At this point, {{the cork}} cambium begins {{to form the}} periderm, {{consisting}} of protective cork cells containing suberin. In roots, the cork cambium originates in the <b>pericycle,</b> {{a component of the}} vascular cylinder.|$|E
5000|$|Casparian strips {{differentiate}} {{after an}} outward {{growth of the}} cortex is completed. At this level of the root development, the primary xylem of its vascular cylinder is only partly advanced. In gymnosperms and angiosperms displaying secondary growth, the roots commonly develop only endodermis with Casparian strips. In many of those, the endodermis is later discarded, together with the cortex, when the periderm develops from the <b>pericycle.</b> If the <b>pericycle</b> is superficial and the cortex is retained, either the endodermis is stretched or crushed or it keeps pace with {{the expansion of the}} vascular cylinder by radial [...] divisions, and the new walls develop Casparian strips in continuity with the old ones.|$|E
50|$|In eudicots, it {{also has}} the {{capacity}} to produce lateral roots. Branch roots arise from this primary meristem tissue. In plants undergoing secondary growth, the <b>pericycle</b> contributes to the vascular cambium often diverging into a cork cambium.|$|E
50|$|When dissected, the {{arrangement}} of the cells in a root is root hair, epidermis, epiblem, cortex, endodermis, <b>pericycle</b> and, lastly, the vascular tissue in the centre of a root to transport the water absorbed by the root to other places of the plant.|$|E
50|$|Additionally, protoplasts {{of plants}} expressing {{fluorescent}} proteins in certain cells {{may be used}} for Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS), where only cells fluorescing a selected wavelength are retained. Among other things, this technique is used to isolate specific cell types (e.g., guard cells from leaves, <b>pericycle</b> cells from roots) for further investigations, such as transcriptomics.|$|E

50|$|Plants and yeast have anion {{transporters}} that in {{both the}} <b>pericycle</b> cells of plants and the plasma membrane of yeast cells export borate or boric acid (pKa = 9.2). In A. thaliana, boron is exported from <b>pericycle</b> cells into the root stellar apoplasm against a concentration gradient for uptake into the shoots. In S. cerevisiae, export is also against a concentration gradient. The yeast transporter recognizes HCO, I−, Br−, NO and Cl−, which may be substrates. Tolerance to boron toxicity in cereals {{is known to be}} associated with reduced tissue accumulation of boron. Expression of genes from roots of boron-tolerant wheat and barley with high similarity to efflux transporters from Arabidopsis and rice lowered boron concentrations due to an efflux mechanism. The mechanism of energy coupling is not known, nor is it known if borate or boric acid is the substrate. Several possibilities (uniport, anion:anion exchange and anion:cation exchange) can account for the data.|$|E
5000|$|Procambium: {{lies just}} {{inside of the}} protoderm and {{develops}} into primary xylem and primary phloem. It also produces the vascular cambium, and cork cambium, secondary meristems. The cork cambium further differentiates into the phelloderm (to the inside) and the phellem, or cork (to the outside). All three of these layers (cork cambium, phellem and phelloderm) constitute the periderm. In roots, the procambium can also give rise to the <b>pericycle,</b> which produces lateral roots in eudicots.|$|E
50|$|Dicot stems {{with primary}} growth have pith in the center, with {{vascular}} bundles forming a distinct ring visible when the stem is viewed in cross section. The {{outside of the}} stem is covered with an epidermis, which is covered by a waterproof cuticle. The epidermis also may contain stomata for gas exchange and multicellular stem hairs called trichomes. A cortex consisting of hypodermis (collenchyma cells) and endodermis (starch containing cells) is present above the <b>pericycle</b> and vascular bundles.|$|E
50|$|The tobacco cyst {{nematode}} is a sedentary semi-endoparasite of the roots. Its feeding site and feeding patterns {{are typical of}} the genus Globodera. Nurse cell is a multinucleate syncytium.Tobacco {{cyst nematode}} causes significant damage on tobacco root system mainly by intracellular migration. This damage is caused both by mechanical penetration {{as well as with}} the enzyme secretions. Syncytium is formed in <b>pericycle</b> and endodermal cells of the plant. Unlike root-knot nematodes, the tobacco cyst nematode does not form feeding tubes enveloped in an endoplasmatic reticulum. Due to lack of enzymes that cause hypetrophy and hyperplasia, there is no galling observed.|$|E
50|$|This allows direct cytoplasm-to-cytoplasm flow {{of water}} and other {{nutrients}} along concentration gradients. In particular, symplastic flow {{is used in the}} root systems to bring in nutrients from soil. It moves these solutes from epidermis cells through the cortex into the endodermis. Once solutes reach the endodermal cells thorough apoplastic flow, they are forced into the symplastic pathway due to the presence of the Casparian strip. Once the solutes are passively filtered, they eventually reach the <b>pericycle,</b> where it can be moved into the xylem for long distance transport.It is contrasted with the apoplastic flow, which uses cell wall transport.|$|E
50|$|Cork cell walls contain suberin, a waxy {{substance}} {{which protects}} the stem against water loss, {{the invasion of}} insects into the stem, and prevents infections by bacteria and fungal spores. The cambium tissues, i.e., the cork cambium and the vascular cambium, are the only parts of a woody stem where cell division occurs; undifferentiated cells in the vascular cambium divide rapidly to produce secondary xylem to the inside and secondary phloem to the outside. Phloem is a nutrient-conducting tissue composed of sieve tubes or sieve cells mixed with parenchyma and fibers. The cortex is the primary tissue of stems and roots. In stems the cortex is between the epidermis layer and the phloem, in roots the inner layer is not phloem but the <b>pericycle.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In plants, organogenesis, {{which is}} simply the process of forming new organs, occurs {{continuously}} and only stops when the plant dies. In the shoot, the shoot apical meristems regularly produce new lateral organs (leaves or flowers) and lateral branches. In the root, new lateral roots form from weakly differentiated internal tissue (e.g. the xylem-pole <b>pericycle</b> in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana). In vitro {{and in response to}} specific cocktails of hormones (mainly auxins and cytokinins), most plant tissues can de-differentiate and form a mass of dividing totipotent stem cells called a callus. [...] De novo [...] organogenesis can then occur from those cells. The type of organ that is formed depends on the relative concentrations of the hormones in the medium.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{symptom of}} {{infection}} by Frankia alni is a branching and curling {{of the root}} hairs of the alder as the bacterium moves in. The bacterium becomes encapsulated with a material derived from the plant cell wall and remains outside the host's cell membrane. The encapsulation membrane contains pectin, cellulose and hemicellulose. Cell division is stimulated in the hypodermis and cortex, {{which leads to the}} formation of a [...] "prenodule". The bacterium then migrates into the cortex of the root while the nodule continues to develop {{in the same way as}} a lateral root. Nodule lobe primordia develop in the <b>pericycle,</b> endodermis or cortex during the development of the prenodule and finally the bacterium enters the cells of these to infect the new nodule.|$|E
50|$|When the {{immature}} female penetrates the root, {{a feeding}} tube forms from stylet secretions. Nematode infestation can cause symptoms in the plant that resemble those of moisture and nutrient deficiencies. It causes hypertrophy in the <b>pericycle</b> cells of seedling roots and in the periderm cells of the roots of older plants. Root growth slows and secondary root development is limited. Root necrosis has been observed in pineapple and banana. Shoot growth suppression and reduction of fruit quality has been observed in crops such as pineapple. Infested plants can become stunted and chlorotic. Wilt disease can follow when opportunistic fungi such as Fusarium and Verticillium infect the plants, a process observed in cotton. Secondary fungal infection can also cause root decay. Damage from R. reniformis {{is directly related to}} the number of nematodes present when the crop is planted. Variation among nematode populations, hosts, environmental conditions, and soil types may alter the threshold or economic injury level across the geographic distribution of the nematode.|$|E

50|$|The endodermis in {{the root}} is {{important}} in the development of root pressure. The endodermis is a single layer of cells between the cortex and the <b>pericycle.</b> These cells allow water movement until it reaches the Casparian strip, made of suberin, a waterproof substance. The Casparian strip prevents mineral nutrient ions from moving passively through the endodermal cell walls. Water and ions move in these cell walls via the apoplast pathway. Ions outside the endodermis must be actively transported across an endodermal cell membrane to enter or exit the endodermis. Once inside the endodermis, the ions are in the symplast pathway. They cannot diffuse back out again but can move from cell to cell via plasmodesmata or be actively transported into the xylem. Once in the xylem vessels or tracheids, ions are again in the apoplast pathway. Xylem vessels and tracheids transport water up the plant but lack cell membranes. The Casparian strip substitutes for their lack of cell membranes and prevents accumulated ions from diffusing passively in apoplast pathway out of the endodermis. The ions accumulating interior to the endodermis in the xylem create a water potential gradient and by osmosis, water diffuses from the moist soil, across the cortex, through the endodermis and into the xylem.|$|E
30|$|The {{secondary}} {{structures of}} B. scorzonerifolium roots consist of the periderm, <b>pericycle</b> ring and secondary vascular tissue. The <b>pericycle</b> parenchymal cells had intercellular spaces and secretory canals composed of 3 – 4 epithelial cells. The <b>pericycle</b> cells and epithelial cells were rich in starch grains and osmiophilic droplets. The vacuole of <b>pericycle</b> parenchyma cells were labeled with numerous gold particles (Figure  3 F and Table  2).|$|E
40|$|Each {{plant cell}} type expresses a unique {{transcriptome}} and proteome {{at different stages}} of differentiation dependent on its developmental fate. This study compared gene expression and protein accumulation in cell-cycle-competent primary root <b>pericycle</b> cells of maize (Zea mays) prior to their first division and lateral root initiation. These are the only root cells that maintain the competence to divide after they leave the meristematic zone. <b>Pericycle</b> cells of the inbred line B 73 were isolated via laser capture microdissection. Microarray experiments identified 32 genes preferentially expressed in <b>pericycle</b> versus all other root cells that have left the apical meristem; selective subtractive hybridization identified seven genes preferentially expressed in <b>pericycle</b> versus central cylinder cells of the same root region. Transcription and protein synthesis represented the most abundant functional categories among these pericycle-specific genes. Moreover, 701 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were generated from <b>pericycle</b> and central cylinder cells. Among those, transcripts related to protein synthesis and cell fate were significantly enriched in <b>pericycle</b> versus nonpericycle cells. In addition, 77 EST clusters not previously identified in maize ESTs or genomic databases were identified. Finally, among the most abundant soluble <b>pericycle</b> proteins separated via two-dimensional electrophoresis, 20 proteins were identified via electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry, thus defining a reference dataset of the maize <b>pericycle</b> proteome. Among those, two proteins were preferentially expressed in the <b>pericycle.</b> In summary, these pericycle-specific gene expression experiments define the distinct molecular events during the specification of cell-cycle-competent <b>pericycle</b> cells prior to their first division and demonstrate that <b>pericycle</b> specification and lateral root initiation might be controlled by a different set of genes...|$|E
40|$|To {{sustain a}} lifelong ability to {{initiate}} organs, plants retain pools of undifferentiated cells with a preserved proliferation capacity. The root <b>pericycle</b> represents a unique tissue with conditional meristematic activity, and its tight control determines initiation of lateral organs. Here {{we show that}} the meristematic activity of the <b>pericycle</b> is constrained by the interaction with the adjacent endodermis. Release of these restraints by elimination of endodermal cells by single-cell ablation triggers the <b>pericycle</b> to re-enter the cell cycle. We found that endodermis removal substitutes for the phytohormone auxin-dependent initiation of the <b>pericycle</b> meristematic activity. However, auxin is indispensable to steer the cell division plane orientation of new organ-defining divisions. We propose a dual, spatiotemporally distinct role for auxin during lateral root initiation. In the endodermis, auxin releases constraints arising from cell-to-cell interactions that compromise the <b>pericycle</b> meristematic activity, whereas, in the <b>pericycle,</b> auxin defines {{the orientation of the}} cell division plane to initiate lateral roots...|$|E
40|$|In Cyperus giganteus, like {{in other}} Monocotyledoneae, the protoderm, procambium, {{fundamental}} meristem and primary thickening meristem (PTM) are differentiated from the rhizome promeristem. The PTM produces the inner cortical parenchyma, endodermis, <b>pericycle</b> and amphivasal vascular bundles, which are {{formed by the}} procambium too. After the primary body differentiates, cellular divisions continue only in the <b>pericycle,</b> and originate an irregular vascular system with vessel elements shorter and more branched than {{those found in the}} primary growth. This change of activity in the <b>pericycle</b> defines a secondary growth, where the secondary thickening meristem (STM) is the <b>pericycle</b> itself...|$|E
