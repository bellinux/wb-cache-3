5|$|Carrie {{had told}} me in an earlier writing {{appointment}} that she was expecting this album to have darker tones than any of her earlier records. So I remember sitting at the piano while writing the song thinking that if Carrie really wanted something dark, this was what she was after. Carrie really got into the story and making sure we didn't give away how the two women {{got rid of the}} man the song is about. This kind of song is really tricky because you need enough detail to tell the story and keep it interesting without it becoming so graphic that it's unpleasant to listen to more than once. I think we managed to <b>pull</b> <b>that</b> off. Either way, it was certainly fun choosing which elements of the story to put in and which ones to leave out.|$|E
5|$|It is {{probable}} that the planet is composed of hydrogen and helium. The planet orbits on the same plane as Kepler-9b, a second and larger gas giant located in the Kepler-9 system. While observing the planet, the Kepler team noticed that Kepler-9b and c orbited in a 1:2 ratio, where Kepler-9b orbits its star every 19 days and Kepler-9c orbits every 38 days. The gravitational <b>pull</b> <b>that</b> each planet has on the other, known as orbital resonance, keeps the planets in a stable orbit. This phenomenon {{is the first of}} its kind seen outside the Solar System. Every time Kepler-9c completed an orbit during the observation period, its orbital period decreased by about 39 minutes. At some point, however, this trend will reverse and its orbit will increase. The lengths of its orbit will oscillate slightly above and below the 2:1 ratio.|$|E
25|$|Clemens won an {{emotional}} start on September 15, following his mother's death that morning. In his final {{start of the}} 2005 season, Clemens got his 4,500th strikeout. On October 9, 2005, Clemens made his first relief appearance since 1984, entering as a pinch hitter in the 15th, then pitching three innings to get win as the Astros defeated the Atlanta Braves in Game four of the National League Division Series. It is the longest postseason game in MLB history at eighteen innings. Clemens lasted only two innings in Game 1 of the 2005 World Series, and the Astros went on to be swept by the Chicago White Sox. It was the Astros' first World Series appearance. Clemens had aggravated a hamstring <b>pull</b> <b>that</b> had limited his performance since at least September.|$|E

25|$|JR and Babe lead {{separate}} {{lives for}} a while. However, on November 2, 2007, as they later bond over old times while talking {{at the bar}} The Comeback, their connection draws them together once more. Babe sees a more mature side to JR, and after she offers him a ride home, the two cannot stop the <b>pull</b> <b>that</b> is apparent between them. With the sexual tension intensifying, and JR saying that he misses kissing her, the two make love {{for the first time}} since their divorce. Despite this reunion of sorts, Babe tells JR that it was just a one-time deal and says that she is not in love with him anymore. JR is left devastated, and even after Babe apologizes for hurting him in this way, he sulks in despair and begins drinking again.|$|E
25|$|Director Victor Lobl also planned out the mannerisms {{shown by}} Brooks as Sisko where he talks {{directly}} to the camera. He praised the actor, saying that he delivered exactly what Lobl's written direction had described. All of those sequences were shot almost in direct continuity {{to ensure that the}} audience believed that it was a single log recording. Lobl had those filmed very tightly, and so there were not many options available in editing as only two angles were filmed for those sequences. The script had called for Sisko to get more and more drunk during those sequences as he descends into the flashbacks; Lobl had expected the studio to <b>pull</b> <b>that</b> idea before filming but they did not. Lobl also had Sisko begin to remove various parts of his uniform at the same time, which he felt demonstrated that the character was baring his soul about the story.|$|E
25|$|In baseball, {{although}} only {{the positions of}} pitcher and catcher are prescribed by the rules, fielders' positions are dictated closely by custom, and shifts in fielders' positions according to circumstance are less dramatic; the strike zone and smaller angle of fair territory limit the usefulness of some strategies which cricket makes available to batsmen. The chief occasion on which fielding placement differs markedly from the usual {{is the presence of}} a pull, or dead-pull, hitter at bat (such hitters almost never, except on the rare occasion of a fluke or mishit, hit the ball in any direction except towards {{the same side of the}} field as they stand at the plate, i.e. a right-handed pull hitter hits everything toward left field). In such case the fielders will move so far in the direction of the <b>pull</b> <b>that</b> one half of the field is almost completely unprotected. This is called an infield shift or overshift. A six-man infield has also been used when circumstances warrant. For the great majority of batters, however, the traditional fielding arrangement is used, with minor changes in position to accommodate the batter's power or bat-handling ability, the location of runners, or the number of outs. (For example, with a base runner on third with less than two out, the importance of fielders being able to throw quickly to home plate on a bunt is increased, and the infielders will play closer to home plate.) However, baseball has no equivalent of cricket's close-in fielders, because it is impractical to have fielders so close to the bat as they would have virtually no chance of latching onto a ball travelling so fast. It is possible to place a close-in fielder to catch a bunt, but this practice is almost never followed except in specialised circumstances such as a pitcher being forced to bat late in a game, with less than two outs and the opportunity to drive in a run. The team's best chance to score in such a situation may be to sacrifice bunt and may warrant the first or third baseman playing halfway up the line to cut off the run at home.|$|E

500|$|Described as a [...] "shoot-and-lift-up puzzle" [...] game, Meteos core {{gameplay}} mechanic has players move colored blocks (known as meteos) {{that fall}} {{from the top of}} the screen with the Nintendo DS stylus. Aligning three (or more) meteos of the same color horizontally or vertically cause them to ignite and rise; if they (or any blocks above them) move off the screen, they are removed from the playing area. The speed and frequency of falling meteos can be adjusted with the [...] "Speeder" [...] gauge. Power-ups can be used to help or hinder the player or opponents; one example is a giant hammer which can destroy multiple meteos with a few swings. Each meteo sent out of the playing field is cached in a virtual bank, from which they can be unlock new planets, aliens, and sounds. The player can play as one of thirty-two aliens and their respective planets. Each planet has its own unique gravitational <b>pull</b> <b>that</b> affects how the meteos launch.|$|E

500|$|Usher toured {{fourteen}} {{cities in}} North America, coining the trip One Night Stand: Ladies Only Tour. Mainly targeting women, the tour commenced on November2,2008 and concluded on November25,2008. The tour's female-focused concept {{was inspired by}} other male recording artists who [...] "did things special like this for their female fans", such as Teddy Pendergrass, Marvin Gaye and Prince. Enjoying the challenge of a female-only tour, Usher said, [...] "There [...] only a few artists that can <b>pull</b> <b>that</b> off, I feel like I've had such a connection with my audience. This album, I felt like, was definitely the type of one that was more intimate. So {{what better way to}} get up close and personal than to make it all women?" [...] Usher performed the tour with a Dsquared2 wardrobe. At each show, one fan was brought onstage [...] "for an even more intimate experience with the singer". This took place during [...] "Superstar"; a female fan was served champagne and strawberries by Usher while sitting on his lap as he sang to her. Among Usher's own songs, the setlist also included portions of Stevie Wonder's [...] "Rocket Love", Gaye's [...] "I Want You" [...] and Prince's [...] "Do Me, Baby". At the Detroit show he also gave T-Baby's [...] "It's So Cold in the D". Usher was supported by a five-piece band, three backing vocalists and four backup dancers.|$|E
500|$|Wilhelm [...] "Deathshead" [...] Strasse, the game's main antagonist, {{has been}} {{previously}} featured as an antagonist of Return to Castle Wolfenstein (2001) and main antagonist of Wolfenstein (2009). For The New Order, the team achieved closure on his story; {{to do so in}} an effective way, they wanted to find an interesting angle to portray him: his personality is full of enthusiasm, and he appreciates life after his near-death experience in the previous game. When developing the Nazis, Matthies states that the team [...] "didn't want to cartoon-ify them", instead opting to treat them seriously. Gideon Emery, who portrayed Fergus Reid, auditioned {{for his role in the}} game. He described Fergus as [...] "a tough as nails soldier, who gives [...] both support and a pretty hard time in the process". Matthies felt that Fergus is a type of father figure to Blazkowicz, and that he [...] "only gives negative reinforcement". Conversely, he saw Wyatt as a [...] "sort of son surrogate", as Blazkowicz is tasked as being his protector and mentor, and that he gives [...] "positive reinforcement". Max Hass, a seemingly brain-damaged member of the Resistance, was inspired by the character of Garp from John Irving's novel The World According to Garp. Alex Solowitz portrayed Max in the game. [...] "Max was the most challenging character to cast, which seems counter-intuitive because he's a pretty simple guy on paper, but it took a tremendous actor to <b>pull</b> <b>that</b> off and a long time to find him," [...] Matthies said.|$|E
