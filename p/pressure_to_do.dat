5|$|Little or {{no attempt}} was made to recruit African-American or other women {{minorities}} until October 1944, when President Roosevelt approved of accepting African-American women into the women's reserve, under <b>pressure</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so by African-American organizations. Harriet Ida Pickens and Frances Wills were the first African-American women to become WAVE officers. By September 1945, there were 72 African-American women in the WAVES and integrated.|$|E
5|$|The NDH {{government}} struck {{upon the}} idea of trying to re-educate these children to become something akin to an Ustaše version of the Hitler Youth, thereby turning them against their Serb parents. The regime saw this as a more effective way of placing pressure on the Yugoslav Partisan movement than killing the children outright. However, the NDH regime had not made any arrangements to implement this idea, so {{the establishment of a}} children's camp was done in haste, especially as there was strong <b>pressure</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something for the children. NDH regime propaganda advanced the idea that the children were being liberated from slavery {{at the hands of the}} Partisans.|$|E
5|$|However, {{by the end}} of the year, the United States {{had failed}} to achieve the {{objectives}} of Rolling Thunder, because North Vietnam continued to send its troops and military supplies down the Ho Chi Minh Trail, which demonstrated that the North Vietnamese Government was not ready to quit the war. In response to domestic political <b>pressure</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> more, President Johnson shifted priority of the campaign to interdiction. From summer 1965 to the winter period of 1966–67, the campaign was aimed at degrading North Vietnam’s capability to infiltrate and send men into South Vietnam. Again, America’s shift towards interdiction also failed, and the Johnson administration was forced to change the priority of the bombing campaign. For the third phase of Rolling Thunder, which occurred from spring 1967 to early 1968, bombing operations were focused on industrial and transportation targets in and around Hanoi, Hai Phong and the buffer zone near the Chinese border.|$|E

50|$|Another {{challenge}} {{associated with}} EQAO testing is that students' ability <b>to</b> <b>do</b> their {{best on the}} test may be affected by feelings of stress and test anxiety. Some students may feel <b>pressured</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> well, because of external pressures from the teacher and parents, or <b>pressure</b> from themselves <b>to</b> succeed, and therefore may struggle to complete the test {{in a way that}} truly demonstrates their knowledge and learning.|$|R

25|$|To {{conservative}} elements this protest {{seemed to}} flout {{the law and}} as a result the government found itself under increasing <b>pressure</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something about the situation. Private groups of concerned citizens began to form also, many of them formed from returned servicemen, from organisations such as the Returned Soldiers and Citizens Political Federation and the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia (RSSILA).

25|$|Mayenne {{was opposed}} {{to the idea of}} {{summoning}} the Estates-General to elect a king, but in 1592, he finally caved in to Spanish <b>pressure</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. Mayenne opened the assembly with a symbolically empty chair beside him. The influence of Spain on the assembly soon proved problematic. Spain sought the election of the Infanta Isabella Clara Eugenia of Spain, the daughter of Philip II of Spain and the granddaughter of Catherine de' Medici. The Spanish urged the Estates-General to repeal the Salic Law, which prevented the rule of a queen regnant; but in this, they failed to grasp a fundamental principle of the French royal succession.|$|E
25|$|Cabinet Ministers held {{a conference}} at 10 Downing Street on 5pm {{on the day}} of the assassination. They {{suspected}} Anti-Treaty forces (who had recently seized the Four Courts in Dublin) might be responsible – this was in fact not the case – and thought the Irish Provisional Government “should be pressed to deal with the matter”. Macready was summoned to London, where he found the Cabinet worried about their personal safety but also keen for a dramatic gesture of retaliation, and was asked whether it was possible for British troops to seize the Four Courts – he said that it was but cautioned against precipitate action which might reunite the two Irish factions, and on his return to Dublin deliberately delayed taking such action. Nonetheless, suspicion of Anti-Treaty complicity in Wilson’s murder, and perceived British <b>pressure</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something about it, was one of several triggers of the Irish Civil War.|$|E

500|$|The General Assembly first {{considered}} the Civil Marriage Protection Act in 2011. Governor Martin O'Malley {{stated that he}} would sign the bill, despite urges from then-Archbishop of Baltimore Edwin Frederick O'Brien requesting that he [...] "resist <b>pressure</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so." [...] O’Malley said [...] "I have concluded that discriminating against individuals based on their sexual orientation {{in the context of}} civil marital rights is unjust. I have also concluded that treating the children of families headed by same-sex couples with lesser protections under the law than the children of families headed by heterosexual parents, is also unjust." [...] On February 24, 2011, the Senate, which was thought to be the biggest obstacle to passage, approved the bill in a 25–21 vote. The House of Delegates proved to be a challenge, where same-sex marriage advocates struggled to gain support from social conservatives from Prince George's County, southern Maryland, and the Baltimore suburbs who cited religious concerns.|$|E

500|$|Before the Norman period, Scotland {{had little}} clear diocesan structure. There were bishoprics based on various ancient churches, {{but some are}} very obscure in the records and {{there appear to be}} long vacancies. From around 1070, in the reign of Malcolm III, there was a [...] "Bishop of Alba" [...] {{resident}} at St. Andrews, {{but it is not clear}} what authority he had over the other bishops. After the Norman Conquest of England, the Archbishops of both Canterbury and York each claimed superiority over the Scottish church. When David I secured the appointment of John, a Tironensian monk, as Bishop of Glasgow around 1113, Thurstan Archbishop of York demanded the new bishop's submission. A long running dispute followed, with John travelling to Rome to unsuccessfully appeal his case before pope Calixtus II. John continued to withhold his submission despite papal <b>pressure</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. A new bishopric of Carlisle was created in what is now northern England, claimed as part of the Glasgow diocese and as territory by David I. In 1126 a new bishop was appointed to the southern Diocese of Galloway based at Whithorn, who offered his submission to York, a practice which would continue until the fifteenth century. David sent John to Rome to lobby for the Bishop of St. Andrew's to be made an independent archbishop. At one point David and his bishops threatened to transfer their allegiance to the anti-pope Anacletus II. When Bishop John died in 1147 David was able to appoint another Tironensian monk, Herbert abbot of Kelso, as his successor and submission to York continued to be withheld. The church in Scotland attained independent status after the Papal Bull of Celestine III (Cum universi, 1192) by which all Scottish bishoprics except Galloway became formally independent of York and Canterbury. However, unlike Ireland which had been granted four Archbishoprics in the same century, Scotland received no Archbishop and the whole Ecclesia Scoticana, with individual Scottish bishoprics (except Whithorn/Galloway), became the [...] "special daughter of the see of Rome". It was run by special councils made up of all the Scottish bishops, with the bishop of St Andrews emerging as the most important figure.|$|E
