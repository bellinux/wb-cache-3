The roof was designed with a panel over the cargo bay that manually retracted into and then locked into position in the forward section of the roof above the rear <b>passenger's</b> <b>seat.</b> This <b>configuration</b> allowed Studebaker to boast that the Wagonaire could transport items (such as standard size refrigerators) in an upright position.|$|R
5|$|In October 2010, Pemco World Air Services and Precision Conversions {{launched}} aftermarket conversion {{programs to}} modify 757-200s into 757 Combi aircraft. Vision Technologies Systems launched {{a similar program}} in December 2011. All three aftermarket conversions modify the forward portion of the aircraft to provide room for up to ten cargo pallets, while leaving the remaining space to fit around 45 to 58 <b>passenger</b> <b>seats.</b> This <b>configuration</b> is targeted at commercial charter flights which transport heavy equipment and personnel simultaneously. Customers for converted 757 Combi aircraft include the Air Transport Services Group, National Airlines, and North American Airlines.|$|R
50|$|The Mil Mi-58 was a {{projected}} twin-turbine passenger helicopter {{based on the}} Mil Mi-28 first announced at the 1995 Paris Air Show. It was planned to have two 2,088 kW Klimov TV3-117VMA-SB3 turboshaft engines, Mi-28's main rotor and Delta H tail rotor, and fixed tricycle-type landing gear with one nosewheel and two rear wheels on long sponsons. It was said to accommodate 20 <b>passengers</b> with various <b>seating</b> <b>configurations.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The {{main cabin}} of the Super Puma, which is {{accessed}} via two sliding plug doors, used a reconfigurable floor arrangement, various <b>passenger</b> <b>seating</b> or cargo <b>configurations</b> can be adopted, including specialised configurations for medical operators. According to Airbus Helicopters, {{in addition to}} the two pilots, the short-fuselage AS332 can accommodate up to 15 passengers while the stretched-fuselage AS332 increases this to 20 passengers in a comfortable configuration. Soundproof upholstery is installed, as is separately-adjustable heating and ventilation systems. Along with the doors, 12 windows around the main cabin area are [...] for emergency exits. The lower fuselage can also be fitted with floatation gear. A hatch in the floor to access the cargo sling pole is present in the cabin, as is individual stowage space for airborne equipment.|$|R

5000|$|HRTC {{operates}} air-conditioned Deluxe buses with 2X2 <b>seating</b> <b>configuration</b> on {{all important}} routes including Delhi-Shimla, Delhi-Manali, Delhi-Dharamshala and others. The buses also {{run on a}} few intrastate routes including Manali-Shimla. Besides the 11.4 meter luxury Isuzu buses, this class also includes buses built by JCBL and Amar on 210", 243" [...] and 222" [...] WB chassis by TATA or Ashok Leyland. The buses are provided with 35 comfortable and luxurious <b>passenger</b> <b>seats</b> with pushback.|$|R
50|$|Typical cabin {{arrangements}} {{allows for}} eight passengers {{in a club}} <b>seating</b> <b>configuration,</b> or nine <b>passengers</b> in a high density <b>seating</b> <b>configuration,</b> <b>passenger</b> <b>seating</b> is designed for quick rearrangement based upon current demands. The cabin can be accessed either through sliding doors in {{either side of the}} aircraft or via large clamshell doors {{at the rear of the}} cabin; in combination with the high mounted tail boom, the clamshell doors are designed to provide safe clearance for loading and unloading activities even while the rotors are turning. In an EMS/casualty evacuation arrangement, the EC145 can carry up to two stretchered patients with three accompanying medical staff. The helicopter can be fitted with emergency floats, rescue hoist, search light, load hook and specialist equipment for other operational requirements.|$|R
5000|$|Its {{design was}} derived from the Aeronca C-2. Introduced in 1931, it {{featured}} room for a <b>passenger</b> <b>seated</b> next to the pilot. Powered by a new [...] Aeronca E-113 engine, the <b>seating</b> <b>configuration</b> made flight training much easier and many Aeronca owners often took to the skies with only five hours of instruction—largely because of the C-3's predictable flying characteristics. Both the C-2 and C-3 are often described as “powered gliders” because of their gliding ability and gentle landing speeds.|$|R
5000|$|The TVR Cerbera has {{its front}} <b>passenger</b> <b>seated</b> {{slightly}} forward {{to allow more}} room for a passenger in the back, as well as having very large side doors to make access to the rear <b>seats</b> easier.

50|$|The lightest (light aircraft, list {{of light}} {{transport}} aircraft) of short haul regional feeder airliner type aircraft that carry 19 or fewer <b>passenger</b> <b>seats</b> are called commuter aircraft, commuterliners, feederliners, and air taxis, {{depending on their}} size, engines, how they are marketed, region of the world, and <b>seating</b> <b>configurations.</b> The Beechcraft 1900, for example, has only 19 seats. Depending on local and national regulations, a commuter aircraft may not qualify as an airliner {{and may not be}} subject to the regulations applied to larger aircraft. Members of this class of aircraft normally lack such amenities as lavatories and galleys and typically do not carry a flight attendant as an aircrew member.|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} {{the performance of a}} booster seat in different <b>seating</b> <b>configurations</b> in side-impact hyGe sled tests (crash severity 30 km/h) with two attachment systems: a standard seatbelt and ISOfix (rigid). The objectives of the study were twofold: (i) to identify the relative benefits of ISOfix attachment compared with seatbelt attachment of a near-side booster seat in a 3 -abreast <b>seating</b> <b>configuration</b> with adjacent occupants in child restraints (CRS); and (ii) {{to examine the effects of}} 3 -abreast <b>seating</b> <b>configurations</b> compared with no adjacent <b>passengers</b> on booster <b>seat</b> crash protection characteristics. Overall, the findings confirmed the superior performance of the rigid anchorages in reducing lateral motion of the booster as well as the two adjacent CRS. However, the expected benefits of the rigid attachment in reducing head accelerations were not uniformly observed across the three occupants/seating positions and also appeared to be influenced by <b>seating</b> <b>configuration</b> (3 -abreast versus no adjacent occupant). Further research is warranted to explore the applicability of the findings for different CRS types and <b>seating</b> <b>configurations...</b>|$|R

In this paper, {{the active}} {{suspension}} {{control of a}} vehicle model that has five degrees of freedom with a <b>passenger</b> <b>seat</b> using a fuzzy logic controller is studied. Three cases {{are taken into account}} as different control applications. In the first case, the vehicle model having passive suspensions with an active <b>passenger</b> <b>seat</b> is controlled. In the second case, active suspensions with passive <b>passenger</b> <b>seat</b> combination are controlled. In the third case, both the <b>passenger</b> <b>seat</b> and suspensions have active controllers. Vibrations of the <b>passenger</b> <b>seat</b> in the three cases due to road bump input are simulated. At the end of the study, the results are compared in order to select the combination that supplies the best ride comfort...|$|R

2500|$|The {{configuration}} of driver and <b>passenger</b> <b>seats</b> varies. Generally the driver {{sits in front}} of the passengers to pedal the rickshaw. There are some designs, though, where the cyclist driver sits behind the passengers. In many Asian countries, like India and China, the <b>passenger</b> <b>seat</b> is located behind the driver, while in Indonesia, Malaysia and Vietnam the driver sits behind the <b>passenger</b> <b>seat.</b> [...] In the Philippines, the <b>passenger</b> <b>seats</b> are usually located beside the driver in a side car. Similarly, in the trishaw in Singapore and the sai kaa in Burma the passengers sit alongside the driver.|$|R
