Still, earlier in 1947 he had argued strongly in favour of [...] "Lex Brofoss", the law proposed by Brofoss which meant that the elected politicians gave temporary authority to the Norwegian Price Directorate to regulate the economy.

Meisdalshagen was ultimately criticized by Brofoss for [...] "lack of economical insight", and he also ran afoul with Central Bank of Norway Governor Gunnar Jahn.|$|E
500|$|The blacklisting of Virgin Killer {{also caused}} other {{inadvertent}} issues for Wikipedia {{users in the}} United Kingdom. Usually most Internet users have a unique IP address visible to websites. However, {{as a result of}} ISPs using the IWF blacklist implemented through Cleanfeed technology, traffic to Wikipedia via those affected ISPs was then routed through a small number of proxy servers. This caused problems for users of the site. Since Wikipedia allows users to anonymously edit its encyclopaedia articles, these individuals are identified only through their IP addresses, which are used to selectively block users who vandalise the site or otherwise break its rules. The proxy filtering makes it impossible to uniquely distinguish users, and to prevent vandalism Wikipedia [...] "instituted a blanket ban on anonymous edits from the six ISPs, which account for 95% of British residential internet users".

40|$|In {{this paper}} we use an ARFIMA {{approach}} {{to measure the}} degree of fractional integration of aggregate world CO 2 emissions and its five components – coal, oil, gas, cement, and gas flaring.

With evidence of long memory, we conclude that transitory policy shocks {{are likely to have}} long-lasting <b>effects,</b> but not <b>permanent</b> <b>effects.</b> Accordingly, <b>permanent</b> <b>effects</b> on CO 2 emissions require a more permanent policy stance.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{resilience}} of U. K. regions to employment shocks. Two basic notions of resilience are distinguished. With engineering resilience, there is an underlying stable growth path to which a regional economy rebounds following a shock. With ecological resilience, shocks can permanently affect the growth path of the regional economy. Our data set consists of quarterly employment series for 12 U. K. regions (NUTS I) for the period 19712010. Using a seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) model specification, we test for the relevance of (engineering) resilience of U. K. regional employment to the four recessionary shocks in our sample. It turns out that U. K. regions do indeed differ in their resilience, but that these differences mainly concern the initial resistance to these shocks {{and not so much}} the recovery stage. The SUR model does not allow shocks to have <b>permanent</b> <b>effects</b> and it also does not take the possibility of time differentiated shock spillovers between the 12 regions into account. To this end, we also estimate a vector error-correction model (VECM) specification where employment shocks can have <b>permanent</b> <b>effects</b> and where also interregional employment linkages are included.

It is also known with the higher animals, even after early youth, that the skull yields and is altered in shape, if the skin or muscles be permanently contracted through disease or some accident. With long-eared rabbits, if one ear flops forward and downward, its weight drags forward all {{the bones of the}} skull on the same side, of which I have given a figure. Malm states that the newly-hatched young of perches, salmon, and several other symmetrical fishes, have the habit of occasionally resting on one side at the bottom; and he has observed that they often then strain their lower eyes so as to look upward; and their skulls are thus rendered rather crooked. These fishes, however, are soon able to hold themselves in a vertical position, and no <b>permanent</b> <b>effect</b> is thus produced. With the Pleuronectidae, on the other hand, the older they grow the more habitually they rest on one side, owing to the increasing flatness of their bodies, and a <b>permanent</b> <b>effect</b> is thus produced on the form of the head, and on the position of the eyes. Judging from analogy, the tendency to distortion would no doubt be increased through the principle of inheritance. Schiodte believes, in opposition to some other naturalists, that the Pleuronectidae are not quite symmetrical even in the embryo; and if this be so, we could understand how it is that certain species, while young, habitually fall over and rest on the left side, and other species on the right side. Malm adds, in confirmation of the above view, that the adult Trachypterus arcticus, which is {{not a member of the}} Pleuronectidae, rests on its left side at the bottom, and swims diagonally through the water; and in this fish, the two sides of the head are said to be somewhat dissimilar. Our great authority on Fishes, Dr. Gunther, concludes his abstract of Malm's paper, by remarking that [...] "the author gives a very simple explanation of the abnormal condition of the Pleuronectoids." ...|$|E

The same fact has been strongly brought out by the replies from correspondents whom I had questioned on their mental imagery.

Hitherto the Abolitionists had been regarded with contempt by the conservative, complacent advocates of peace and [...] "compromise," [...] and to join them was essentially to lose caste in the best society. But now a laughing prophet had arisen whose tongue was tipped with fire. The Biglow Papers was an unexpected blow to the slave power. Never before had humor been used directly as a weapon in political warfare. Soon the whole country was ringing with the homely phrases of Hosea Biglow's satiric humor, and deriding conservatism began to change countenance.

Nevertheless, Peach interpretation is problematic insofar as the kind of analysis he credits Ricardo is not in accordance with what he considers as Ricardo's aim.

60|$|There {{are some}} phenomena, some bodily sensations, for example, which are {{essentially}} instantaneous, and whose existence {{can only be}} prolonged by the prolongation {{of the existence of}} the cause by which they are produced. But most phenomena are in their own nature permanent; having begun to exist, they would exist forever unless some cause intervened having a tendency to alter or destroy them. Such, for example, are all the facts of phenomena which we call bodies. Water, once produced, will not of itself relapse into a state of hydrogen and oxygen; such a change requires some agent having the power of decomposing the compound. Such, again, are the positions in space and the movements of bodies. No object at rest alters its position without the intervention of some conditions extraneous to itself; and when once in motion, no object returns to a state of rest, or alters either its direction or its velocity, unless some new external conditions are superinduced. It, therefore, perpetually happens that a temporary cause gives rise to a <b>permanent</b> <b>effect.</b> The contact of iron with moist air for a few hours, produces a rust which may endure for centuries; or a projectile force which launches a cannon-ball into space, produces a motion which would continue forever unless some other force counteracted it.|$|E

He was theoretically determined not only to be a philosophic poet, but to be a great philosophic poet, and to this end he must produce an epic. Leaving aside the question whether the epic be obsolete or not, it may be doubted whether the history of a single man's mind is universal enough in its interest to furnish all the requirements of the epic machinery, and it may be more than doubted whether a poet's philosophy be ordinary metaphysics, divisible into chapter and section. It is rather something which is more energetic in a word than in a whole treatise, and our hearts unclose themselves instinctively at its simple Open sesame! while they would stand firm against the reading of the whole body of philosophy. In point of fact, the one element of greatness which [...] "The Excursion" [...] possesses indisputably is heaviness. It is only the episodes that are universally read, and the effect of these is diluted by the connecting and accompanying lectures on metaphysics. Wordsworth had his epic mould to fill, and, like Benvenuto Cellini in casting his Perseus, was forced to throw in everything, debasing the metal, lest it should run short. Separated from the rest, the episodes are perfect poems in their kind, and without example in the language.|$|E

How many real Christians are there in Zululand and Natal, and of that select and saintly band how many practise monogamy?

Christianity makes no appreciable progress amongst the Zulu natives, whilst, on the other hand, no one having any experience in the country will, if he can avoid it, have a so-called Christian Kafir in his house, because the term is but too frequently synonymous with that of drunkard and thief.
