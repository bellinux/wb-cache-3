40|$|Objective: To {{test the}} {{perceived}} comfort {{and efficiency of}} four functional electrical stimulators (FES). Design: The stimulators were applied over the dorsiflexors (DF) of 28 healthy volunteers. Electronic goniometers monitored changes in electrically-induced DF. Stimulus intensity was increased until full DF occurred or until the subject requested the stimulation stop before full DF. All data were stored on an oscilloscope. Subjects marked on visual analog scales their perceived amount of tingling, pins-needles-burning sensation, and muscle cramping. Data analyses were applied {{to the amount of}} dorsiflexion (deg), <b>phase</b> <b>charge</b> (µC), tingling perception, pins-needle-burning perception and muscle cramps perception. Significant differences were accepted at p< 0. 05. Results: Group means DF were 19. 9 ± 13. 5 deg (Focus), 19. 5 ± 15. 3 deg (300 PV), 20. 0 ± 13. 1 deg (L 300), and 24. 5 ± 14. 6 deg (GMES II) and statistically similar (F= 1. 627, P= 0. 189). The <b>phase</b> <b>charge</b> needed to elicit dorsiflexion yielded significant differences among the stimulators (F= 54. 61, P= 2. 09 E- 19). Post-hoc comparison indicated that GMES II <b>phase</b> <b>charge</b> was significantly lower than the other stimulators. Similarly, the GMES II was perceived as having respectively 39. 1 %, 34. 2 %, and 28. 1 % less pins-needle-burning discomfort than Focus (p= 0. 0003), 300 PV (p= 0. 0001), and L 300 (p= 0. 006).
