This ranges from sophisticated forms of lie detection to improving our understanding of how jurors reach decisions. Vincent, Hall and Kennett state that: Neurolaw is a relatively new and highly-interdisciplinary field that brings together researchers from the social sciences, mind and brain sciences, law and philosophy, as well as public policy and law professionals to examine the potential for neuroscientific discoveries and techniques to address a range of pressing legal and social problems.

40|$|Concerns about {{problematic}} gaming behaviors deserve {{our full}} attention. However, we {{claim that it}} is far from clear that these problems can or should be attributed to a new disorder. The empirical basis for a Gaming Disorder proposal, such as in the new ICD- 11, suffers from fundamental issues. Our main concerns are the low quality of the research base, the fact that the current operationalization leans too heavily on substance use and gambling criteria, and the lack of consensus on symptomatology and assessment of problematic gaming. The act of formalizing this disorder, even as a proposal, has negative medical, scientific, public-health, societal and human rights fallout that should be considered. Of particular concern are moral panics around the harm of video gaming. They might result in <b>premature</b> <b>application</b> of diagnosis in the medical community and the treatment of abundant false-positive cases, especially for children and adolescents. Secondly, research will be locked into a confirmatory approach, rather than an exploration of the boundaries of normal versus pathological. Thirdly, the healthy majority of gamers will be affected negatively. We expect that the premature inclusion of Gaming Disorder as a diagnosis in ICD- 11 will cause significant stigma to the millions of children who play video games as part of a normal, healthy life. At this point, suggesting formal diagnoses and categories is premature: the ICD- 11 proposal for Gaming Disorder should be removed to avoid a waste of public health resources as well as to avoid causing harm to healthy video gamers around the world...|$|E
40|$|Crop {{managers}} need {{to determine}} the most profitable time to defoliate cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) in a high rainfall environment such as the coastal region of Texas. In cotton production, delaying defoliation exposes open bolls to a higher probability of rainfall, and thus, reduces lint yield and fiber quality. Premature defoliation, however, has detrimental affects on lint yield and fiber quality. A more recent method to determine defoliation is based on heat-unit (HU or DD 15) accumulation after physiological cutout or five nodes above white flower (NAWF= 5). Results have been inconsistent across {{a wide range of}} field environments when utilizing HU accumulation past cutout; therefore, adoption of this method has been limited. Many regions of the Cotton Belt have maximum day time temperatures during the growing season that are above optimum for maximum growth. Field studies were conducted for three consecutive growing seasons in the Brazos River Valley and Upper Gulf Coast regions of Texas. The purpose of this research was to identify an upper temperature threshold (UTT) for calculating degree days for defoliation timing. The experimental design consisted of a split-plot design with four replications. The main plots consisted of three upper temperature thresholds (32 ?C, 35 ?C, and no upper limit) and the subplots were five HU timings (361, 417, 472, 528, and 583) accumulated from date of cutout. Utilizing an UTT to calculate daily HU failed to explain differences in the optimum time to defoliate based on accumulated HU from cutout for the upper thresholds investigated. Accumulated HU had a significant impact, however, on defoliation timing. Comparison of the two locations showed that maximum lint yield was obtained at 472 HU and 52 % open boll at Wharton County versus a maximum of 528 HU and 62 % open boll for the Burleson County location. Employing the NACB= 4 method to time defoliation at both locations would have resulted in <b>premature</b> <b>application</b> of harvest aids and reduced lint yields.

40|$|Gibberellin (GA) {{signalling}} during pumpkin male flower {{development is}} highly regulated, including biosynthetic, perception, and transduction pathways. GA 20 -oxidases, 3 -oxidases, and 2 -oxidases catalyse the final part of GA synthesis. Additionally, 7 -oxidase initiates {{this part of}} the pathway in some cucurbits including Cucurbita maxima L. (pumpkin). Expression patterns for these GA-oxidase-encoding genes were examined by competitive reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and endogenous GA levels were determined during pumpkin male flower development. In young flowers, GA 20 ox 3 transcript levels are high in stamens, followed by high levels of the GA precursor GA 9. Later, just before flower opening, transcript levels for GA 3 ox 3 and GA 3 ox 4 increase in the hypanthium and stamens, respectively. In the stamen, following GA 3 ox 4 expression, bioactive GA 4 levels rise dramatically. Accordingly, catabolic GA 2 ox 2 and GA 2 ox 3 transcript levels are low in developing flowers, and increase in mature flowers. Putative GA receptor GID 1 b and DELLA repressor GAIPb transcript levels do not change in developing flowers, but increase sharply in mature flowers.

Due to variation in presentation, especially in MRI and histology methods, a pooled analysis could not be performed. ResultsTwo studies were performed on a 3. 0 -T MRI scanner; all other studies were performed on a 1. 5 -T scanner. Most performed sequences were two-dimensional (2 D) and three-dimensional (3 D) T 1 -weighted and all histology protocols varied slightly.

40|$|The {{timing of}} harvest aid {{application}} on cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) is critical, and poses potential problems when mistimed. The consequences of <b>premature</b> harvest aid <b>application</b> {{could result in}} reduced profit to the grower through {{the need for additional}} applications, reduced lint yield, poor fiber quality, and/or delayed harvest. A delayed application of harvest aid materials may also reduce lint yield and fiber quality if late season inclement weather patterns are established. Currently, there are many methods utilized for determining application of harvest aid materials. One method utilizes accumulated heat units, or growing degree days (HU or DD 60 ??s), following plant physiological maturity. Physiological maturity (cutout) is identified as nodes above white flower equals 5 (NAWF= 5). This method triggers the application of harvest aid chemicals when 850 HU have been accumulated beyond cutout. Due to differing environmental and edaphic characteristics across the Cotton Belt, application of harvest aid chemicals at this time may be premature in terms of optimizing lint yield and fiber quality. A two-year study was established to determine the proper timing of harvest aid application for picker harvested cotton in south central Texas. The design utilized a split-plot with four replications. The main plots consisted of three nodal positions(NAWF= 3, 4, and 5), and the subplots were five HU accumulations (650, 750, 850, 950, and 1050) that corresponded to each of the nodal positions. In both years, lint yields increased with an increase in HU accumulation. Greater yields were achieved when HU accumulation was initiated after NAWF = 4.

The measured normal-mode laser thresholds of a Ho(3 +) (0. 45 atomic percent) :Tm(3 +) (2. 5 atomic percent) :Cr(3 +) (0. 8 atomic percent) :YAG crystal ranged form 26 to 50 J between 120 and 200 K with slope efficiencies up to 0. 36 percent with a 60 percent reflective output mirror. Under Q-switched operation the slope efficiency was 90 percent of the normal-mode result. Development of solid state lasers with Ho(3 +), Tm(3 +) and/or Er(3 +) doped crystals has been pursued by NASA for eye-dafe mid-infrared LIDAR (light detection and ranging) application. As a part of the project, the authors have been working on evaluating Ho(3 +) :Tm(3 +) :Cr(3 +) :YAG crystals for normal-mode and Q-switched 2. 1 micron laser operations in order to determine an optimum Tm(3 +) concentration under flashlamp pumping conditions. Lasing properties of the Ho(3 +) in the mid-infrared region have been studied by many research groups since the early 1960 's. However, the technology of those lasers is still <b>premature</b> for lidar <b>application.</b> In order to overcome the inefficiency related to narrow absorption bands of the Ho(3 +), Tm(3 +) and Er(3 +), the erbium has been replaced by chromium.

Efficient energy transfer to the Tm(3 +) and then the Ho(3 +) occurs subsequently. It is known that high Tm(3 +) concentration and low Ho(3 +) concentration are preferred to achieve a quantum efficiency approaching two and to avoid large reabsorption losses. However, determination of the optimum Tm(3 +) concentration required to ensure efficient energy transfer from Cr(3 +) to Tm(3 +) and from Tm(3 +) to Ho(3 +) has not been made in the Ho:Tm:CR:YAG crystal.

40|$|Copper {{is widely}} used in many {{applications}} such as heat exchangers, condensers, {{heating and air conditioning}} systems, electricity, electronic circuitry and ornamental parts. This paper reviews the issue of copper corrosion in different environments and applications. Special attention is paid to the influence of relative humidity and low molecular weight carboxylic acids. These acids are present in rain, snow, clouds and particulate matter and contribute about 15 - 35 % of rain acidity. Attention is also paid to copper corrosion originated by formic, acetic, propionic and butyric acid vapours. Corrosion product layers (patina) are analysed, showing the relationship between potential and current density cathodic peaks, and models are proposed that show a proportionality factor of the dimensions of a resistor. These results are of practical importance in copper roofing applications. Before 1985, copper was almost universally considered to be a corrosion resistant conduit of potable water, and few instances of copper tube failure were reported. Where unacceptable performance was identified, the problem was usually attributed to reticulation and plumbing systems. In air conditioning <b>applications,</b> <b>premature</b> failure of copper tubing frequently occurs due to pitting corrosion after a short time in service or even during post-installation leakage tests. This type of corrosion is described in the literature as formicary corrosion, and its morphology is characterised by microscopic caverns connected by tunnels. Specimens are analysed to assess the reasons for such premature corrosion failure. Finally, procedures to mitigate copper corrosion are addressed. Pickling in dilute mineral acids (H 2 SO 4 and HCl) is discussed as the most common method for removing oxides formed on the surface of copper based materials during mill processing and manufacturing operations. The use of corrosion inhibitors, such as immersion corrosion inhibitors and volatile corrosion inhibitors (VCI), is a widespread practice to reduce copper corrosion, achieving significant delays in the corrosion process. Reference is made to the search for new environmentally friendly inhibitors for copper and bronze using organic compounds in acid, neutral and alkaline media, and a number of ecological alternatives are reviewed. © 2010 Institute of Materials.

40|$|In {{order to}} ensure the {{desirable}} performance of the machine, dynamic analysis of the machine is necessary. The analysis is conducted by the mean of computer simulation in consideration of applying a large impulsive force. This study validates the machine stability and accuracy. In order to verify the new mechanics model, numerical and experimental studies are conducted using the new incremental punching system. The final shape and thickness distributions of parts are compared to verify the mechanics model. It is found that the model prediction fits the experiment result well. Forming parameters are also investigated. In this research, a new incremental forming system based on incremental punching is designed and built. The system consists of a 3 -axes CNC platform, a high speed hydraulic cylinder with a hemispherical forming tool, and a PC-based CNC control system. The hydraulic system provides the forming force to deform the sheet metal with constant stokes, while the CNC system positions the part. When forming a part, the forming tool punches the sheet metal along the given contour of the part punch by punch; when one layer of the part is completed, the forming tool moves down to the next layer; and the process is finished till all layers are completed. The CNC control system works with standard NC code, and hence, is easy to use. ISMF uses a small generic tool to apply a sequence of operations along the given path to deform the sheet incrementally. These small deformations accumulate to form the final shape of the part. As a result, different parts {{can be made by}} the same setup. Despite of some 30 years of research and development, however, ISMF technology is still <b>premature</b> for industrial <b>applications</b> due to the following reasons: The accuracy of the part is limited; the surface roughness is poor; and the productivity is low. This motivates the presented research. One of the keys to successful application of sheet metal forming {{is to be able to}} predict the deformation and the strain/stress of the part incurred during the forming process. Because of the complexity of the ISMF process, it is not possible to derive an analytical method. The alternative is to use Finite Element Analysis (FEA). However, based on our experience, it takes about one week to solve a simple case. A mechanics model is therefore developed. It consists of two steps. The first step is to computer the final shape: the initial geometric surface is obtained using the punch positions; then using the minimum energy principle, the virtual forces drive the nodes of geometric surface to their lowest energy positions, which gives the final shape of the forming part. The second step is to predict the strain and stress distributions. This is done using the inverse Finite Element Modeling (FEM). An in-house computer software is developed using MATLABRTM. Stamping is one of the most commonly used manufacturing processes. Everyday, millions of parts are formed by this process. The conventional stamping is to form a part in one or several operations with a press machine and a set/sets of dies. It is very efficient but is not cost effective for small batch production parts and prototypes as the dies are expensive and time consuming to make. Recently, with the increasing demands for low-volume and customer-made products, a die-less forming method, Incremental Sheet Metal Forming (ISMF), has become one of the leading R&D topics in the industry. To evaluate the capability of the presented ISMF process, the formability is studied by the means of theory and experiment. A modified M-K model is proposed for predicting the forming limit of the formed part which is undergoing a very complicated strain path. The maximum forming angle is also investigated by experiments.
