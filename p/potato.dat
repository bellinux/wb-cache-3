5|$|After its {{introduction}} from South America to Spain {{in the late}} 1500s, the <b>potato</b> became a staple crop throughout Europe by the late 1700s. The <b>potato</b> allowed farmers to produce more food, and initially added variety to the European diet. The increased supply of food reduced disease, increased births and reduced mortality, causing a population boom throughout the British Empire, the US and Europe. The introduction of the <b>potato</b> also brought about the first intensive use of fertilizer, {{in the form of}} guano imported to Europe from Peru, and the first artificial pesticide, {{in the form of an}} arsenic compound used to fight Colorado <b>potato</b> beetles. Before the adoption of the <b>potato</b> as a major crop, the dependence on grain had caused repetitive regional and national famines when the crops failed, including 17 major famines in England between 1523 and 1623. The resulting dependence on the <b>potato</b> however caused the European <b>Potato</b> Failure, a disastrous crop failure from disease that resulted in widespread famine and the death of over one million people in Ireland alone.|$|E

5|$|In about 1840, L. decemlineata {{adopted the}} {{cultivated}} <b>potato</b> into its host range and it rapidly became a most destructive pest of <b>potato</b> crops. They are today {{considered to be}} the most important insect defoliator of potatoes. They may also cause significant damage to tomato and eggplant crops with both adults and larvae feeding on the plant's foliage. Larvae may defoliate <b>potato</b> plants resulting in yield losses of up to 100% if the damage occurs prior to tuber formation. Larvae may consume 40cm2 of <b>potato</b> leaves during the entire larval stage, but adults are capable of consuming 10cm2 of foliage per day.|$|E

5|$|Some {{species of}} beetle have evolved {{immunity}} to insecticides. For example, the Colorado <b>potato</b> beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata, is a destructive pest of <b>potato</b> plants. Its hosts include {{other members of}} the Solanaceae, such as nightshade, tomato, eggplant and capsicum, as well as the <b>potato.</b> Different populations have between them developed resistance to all major classes of insecticide. The Colorado <b>potato</b> beetle was evaluated as a tool of entomological warfare during World War II, the idea being to use the beetle and its larvae to damage the crops of enemy nations. Germany tested its Colorado <b>potato</b> beetle weaponisation program south of Frankfurt, releasing 54,000 beetles.|$|E

5|$|Their {{experiment}} {{showed a}} statistically significant difference in the thickness of the stomach mucosa. The mucosa of rats fed raw or cooked <b>potato</b> modified with the GNA gene was thicker than that of rats fed the unmodified <b>potato.</b> The crypt length in the jejunum was greater on rats fed the raw modified <b>potato,</b> although there was no statistical difference observed in the rats fed the cooked <b>potato.</b> As these effects were not observed in rats fed the control potatoes spiked with GNA, Pusztai concluded that the differences were a result of the transformation procedure, rather than the presence of GNA. Pusztai's collaborator Stanley Ewen said that the cauliflower mosaic virus used as a promoter could likely be the cause of the observed changes.|$|E

According to data on {{norms of}} {{consumption}} of vegetable production {{of scientific research}} institute of Food of the Russian Academy of Medical Science, <b>potatoes</b> win first place with norm of 120 kg {{a year on the}} person. In this regard much attention is paid to processing of <b>potatoes</b> that allows to prolong the term of its validity, and also to reduce the capacity of storages and to reduce transport transportations as 1 kg of a dry <b>potatoes</b> produсt is equivalent 7 - 8 kg of fresh <b>potatoes.</b> Thus industrial processing of <b>potatoes</b> on dry mashed <b>potatoes</b> allows to reduce losses of <b>potatoes</b> at storage and transportation, there is a possibility of enrichment of products vitamins and other useful components, its nutrition value remains better, conditions for complex processing of raw materials with full recycling and creations of stocks of products from <b>potatoes</b> on a crop failure case are created. Dry mashed <b>potatoes</b> are a product of long storage.
