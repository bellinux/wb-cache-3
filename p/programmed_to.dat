We will present the basic ideas behind three of these applications: that of linear <b>programming</b> <b>to</b> probabilistic logic, that of nonlinear <b>programming</b> <b>to</b> Bayesian logic, and that of integer <b>programming</b> <b>to</b> Dempster-Shafer theory. A mathematical programming approach not only provides a practical means of computing inferences, as in probabilistic logic and Dempster-Shafer theory, but it can suggest new types of logic for dealing with uncertainty, as in the cas [...] ...|$|R

Additionally, some of the standard lights fitted to an ambulance (e.g. headlamps, tail lamps) may be <b>programmed</b> <b>to</b> flash.

5|$|Guardian {{operates}} {{with five}} trains, each containing two cars that were manufactured by Art Engineering. Each car seats four riders back-to-back in seated rows; each train can seat eight riders. Every seat has a lap-bar restraint, a light gun, and a loudspeaker that provides sound during the ride. This configuration allows {{the ride to}} theoretically carry 650 riders per hour. The cars can rotate 90 degrees in both directions. The trains' light guns are <b>programmed</b> <b>to</b> display a unique colour on the ride's screens to indicate where each rider is shooting and to distinguish between shooters.|$|E

5|$|A {{wind energy}} {{penetration}} figure {{can be specified}} for different duration of time, but is often quoted annually. To obtain 100% from wind annually requires substantial long term storage or substantial interconnection to other systems which may already have substantial storage. On a monthly, weekly, daily, or hourly basis—or less—wind might supply as much as or more than 100% of current use, with the rest stored or exported. Seasonal industry might then take advantage of high wind and low usage times such as at night when wind output can exceed normal demand. Such industry might include production of silicon, aluminum, steel, or of natural gas, and hydrogen, and using future long term storage to facilitate 100% energy from variable renewable energy. Homes can also be <b>programmed</b> <b>to</b> accept extra electric power on demand, for example by remotely turning up water heater thermostats.|$|E

Intending to frame Bond for the murder, he calls the guards, but Bond and Natalya escape. In the ensuing firefight, Natalya is captured. Bond steals a tank and pursues Ourumov through St. Petersburg to Trevelyan's train, where he kills Ourumov. Trevelyan escapes and locks Bond in the train with Natalya, setting it to self-destruct.

The value of new contracts is <b>programmed</b> <b>to</b> decrease each year, {{in order to encourage}} the industry to pass on lower costs to the end users.

5|$|Many long-distance {{migrants}} {{appear to}} be genetically <b>programmed</b> <b>to</b> respond to changing day length.

Other species such as merlin Falco columbarius and Eurasian skylark Alauda arvensis move further, to the coast or towards the south. Species like the chaffinch are much less migratory in Britain than those of continental Europe, mostly not moving more than 5km in their lives.|$|E
