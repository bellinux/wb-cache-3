The Theileria species parasites in the challenge were maintained in African buffalo and cattle and the tick vectors were supported by several species of wild Bovidae and domestic livestock present in the area. Thirty immune cattle were observed for 30 weeks while grazing on a ranch in the Trans-Mara Division. Of these, 15 were immersed in toxaphene at weekly or twice-weekly intervals while 15 cattle remained without acaricide application. Cattle, which became pregnant, were withdrawn from the experiment. There {{was no evidence of}} any clinical tick-borne disease in either group of cattle during the experiment. Five species of ixodid ticks infested the cattle during the experiment and cattle, which were not treated with acaricide, had far more ticks. Rhipicephalus appendiculatus was the most abundant tick species, with a mean infestation of 46 adults per animal in the undipped cattle. This tick also appeared to be the cause of the observed reduction in weight gains. Major haematological parameters did not differ significantly between the groups. Behavioural studies showed that the undipped cattle spent less time grazing and ruminating. This study has shown that, at the expense of some loss in productivity, zebu cattle, immunised against ticks and theileriosis, can be kept despite tick infestation...|$|E

Twenty-eight days after immunisation the animals in groups of 6 plus 2 susceptible controls were subjected to challenge: 3 groups with heterologous stocks and one group with the immunising stock. Theileria parva (Boleni) gave good protection against homologous challenge, the T. parva (Muguga, Kenya) and buffalo-derived T. parva (Serengeti transformed, Tanzania) parasite stocks. It did not protect against the T. parva (Kasoba, Malawi) stock and 3 out of 6 immunised cattle died and athe remaining 3 had {{to be treated with}} <b>parvaquone.</b> In a second experiment, the 6 T. parva (Boleni) immunised animals which had received homologous challenge, together with the 2 controls which had recovered without treatment from T. parva (Boleni) infection, were challenged with the T. parva (Kasoba) stock. Four out of 6 of the immunised animals resisted the challenge with mild to moderate reactions. The other 2 animals had severe reactions and one died. The 2 control animals which recovered from T. parva (Boleni) infection resisted the T. parva (Kasoba) challenge and both had mild reactions. It is suggested that oxytetracycline used in the first experiment may have interfered with the expression of the full protective capacity against the virulent T. parva (Kasoba) stock.

40|$|Intracellular schizonts of the apicomplexans Theileria annulata and Theileria parva immortalize bovine leucocytes thereby causing fatal immunoproliferative diseases. Buparvaquone, a hydroxynaphthoquinone {{related to}} <b>parvaquone,</b> {{is the only}} drug {{available}} against Theileria. The drug is only effective {{at the onset of}} infection and emerging resistance underlines the need for identifying alternative compounds. Current drug assays employ monitoring of proliferation of infected cells, with apoptosis of the infected host cell as a read-out, but it is often unclear whether active compounds directly impair the viability of the parasite or primarily induce host cell death. We here report on the development of a quantitative reverse transcriptase real time PCR method based on two Theileria genes, tasp and tap 104, which are both expressed in schizonts. Upon in vitro treatment of T. annulata infected bovine monocytes with buparvaquone, TaSP and Tap 104 mRNA expression levels significantly decreased in relation to host cell actin already within 4  h of drug exposure, while significant differences in host cell proliferation were detectable only after 48 - 72  h. TEM revealed marked alterations of the schizont ultrastructure already after 2  h of buparvaquone treatment, while the host cell remained unaffected. Expression of TaSP and Tap 104 proteins showed a marked decrease only after 24  h. Therefore, the analysis of expression levels of mRNA coding for TaSP and Tap 104 allows to directly measuring impairment of parasite viability. We subsequently applied this method using a series of compounds affecting different targets in other apicomplexan parasites, and show that monitoring of TaSP- and Tap 104 mRNA levels constitutes a suitable tool for anti-theilerial drug development...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), College of Veterinary Medicine, Washington State UniversityThe primary work {{presented}} involves {{evaluation of}} the apicomplexan hemoparasite Theileria equi for imidocarb dipropionate resistance, assessment of possible alternative treatment options, and investigation of the potential role for ATP-binding cassette transporters in drug resistance. An in vitro drug susceptibility assay was developed and adapted to multiple different drugs. The susceptibility of two T. equi isolates and a lab generated variant to both imidocarb dipropionate and the experimental bumped kinase inhibitor 1294 was assessed. Two distinct isolates of T. equi had an almost four-fold difference in imidocarb dipropionate susceptibility, and a variant generated through continuous in vitro imidocarb dipropionate exposure developed a further 15 -fold decrease in susceptibility. In contrast, {{there was no difference}} in susceptibility to bumped kinase inhibitor 1294, suggesting that these drugs may represent a possible alternative for resistant T. equi parasites. Also presented is the failure of four T. equi infected ponies to clear infection with the USDA Florida strain despite two rounds of imidocarb dipropionate treatment, a demonstration of drug resistance in vivo. This collective data raises concern for the existence and emergence of drug resistance at the parasite level. An investigation was undertaken of the 45 putative T. equi ATP-binding cassette transporters as potential mediators of imidocarb dipropionate efflux leading to drug resistance. Selection of the most likely candidate transporters based on differential transcription was accomplished using RNA sequencing. No experiments performed in this study supported imidocarb dipropionate as a substrate for efflux by the most differentially expressed ABC transporter BEWA_ 032300, however there are other transporters of interest and other mechanisms by which ABC transporters can contribute to drug resistance for further investigation. The described drug assay was utilized in a collaborative project to examine the effect of environmental exposures on the stability and efficacy of buparvaquone and <b>parvaquone.</b> T. equi was used as a model organism for Theileria parva, for which these drugs are vital in prophylaxis and treatment. It was found that air exposure causes significant drug degradation and subsequent loss of efficacy, a finding that has implications for successful treatment as well as the prevention of drug resistance development.

40|$|The {{livestock}} sub-sector of {{the agricultural}} sector {{plays an important role}} in the economic and social development of Uganda. It contributes about 30 percent of agricultural Gross Domestic Product. The sub-sector is very important in Mbarara District where it is estimated that approximately one million head of cattle are found. This cattle population is approximately 25 percent of the national herd. However, animal production is limited by, among other things, the widespread incidence of tickborne diseases especially East Coast fever (ECF) caused by T. parva and Anaplasmosis caused by A. marginale. East Coast fever causes high case-fatality rates of up to 100 percent. The current costs of ECF chemotherapy per head are estimated at USh 20, 0001 = (US$ 20) for grade cattle and USh 5, 0001 = (US$ 5) for indigenous cattle. These different rates are brought about by differences in drugs used, with grade cattle being treated with the relatively more expensive drug Clexon" (<b>parvaquone,</b> Coopers Animal Health) and indigenous cattle being treated with the less costly Oxytetracycline. The current costs of dipping an animal per year are estimated at USh 42001 = (US$ 4. 2) for a frequency of once a week immersion, and USh 84001 =(USS 8. 4) for a frequency of twice a week immersion spent on acaricides alone. Spraying costs are estimated at USh 56001 = (US$ 5. 6) and USh 11, 2001 = (US$ 11. 2) for once a week and twice a week application respectively. These cost levels, which are likely to increase with time, are regarded as prohibitive by farmers. A practical method of immunizing cattle against ECF called "Infection and Treatment" method (Radley, 1981) is increasingly being applied by various countries in eastern, central and southern Africa region as a viable alternative to reliance on acaricides alone. Trials were recently conducted in Uganda and are now being assessed. Ex ante analysis of this method in Mbarara District shows that it is an economically viable method to the farmer. Various scenanos B,C, D and E, where animals were assumed to be immunized and acaricide application frequencies reduced by 0 percent, 25 percent, 50 percent and 75 percent respectively were compared with the current control situation (scenario A). Immunization at US$ 4 per cattle head resulted in reduced economic costs by 23. 5 percent, 27 percent, 31 percent and 35 percent in grade cattle and by 14 percent, 19 percent, 23 percent and 27 percent in indigenous cattle for scenarios B, C, D and E respectively. Increases in net income are also estimated at 44 percent, 67 percent, 89 percent and 112 percent in grade cattle in scenarios B, C, D and E respectively. For indigenous cattle, net income declined by 0. 3 percent in scenario B and then rose by 5 percent, 10 percent and 15 percent in scenarios C, D and E respectively. Immunization would thus appear to have a positive financial impact on the cattle industry in Mbarara District. However, more studies of this nature, taking into account the long term effects and consequences of this method of control on animal production, are required in order to generate comprehensive information to help guide policy formulation on more optimal strategies for the control of tick-borne diseases, particularly ECF, in Uganda...|$|E
40|$|East Coast Fever (ECF) - 2 Cue: For cattle keepers in East and Central Africa, one of {{the most}} serious {{diseases}} to threaten their herds is East Coast fever. The disease is of particular danger to young animals, especially those of exotic breeds. Spread to livestock by brown ear ticks, the first sign of infection that cattle owners should be aware of is a swelling that occurs just below the ear of the animal. A few days after this swelling takes place, the animal develops a fever, and within a week it may begin to experience other symptoms. These can include difficulty in breathing and a soft cough, caused by fluid in the lungs; diarrhoea; a general wasting or weakening of muscle strength, and unusual whiteness in the eyes and gums. Treatment of the disease is possible, using drugs such as <b>parvaquone</b> or buparvaquone, commonly known as Parvexon. But farmers should also consider protecting their animals from the disease where possible. Dr Jaribu Sultan is a veterinary specialist working for the NGO Farm-Africa in northern Tanzania. He spoke recently to Lazarus Laiser about East Coast fever, and in particular, how cattle owners can protect their animals against this deadly disease. IN:		?East Coast fever is one of ? OUT:		?many problems of animal health care. ? DUR?N		 4 ? 12 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Dr Jaribu Sultan speaking about the value of investing in livestock health. Transcript Sultan	East Coast fever is {{one of the}} killer diseases in most of the livestock, and the mortality rate can reach as high as 100 %, especially to the young animals of exotic breeds. And in relation to the indigenous cattle, it also causes a lot of death to these young animals. Laiser	How can the farmer prevent the disease spreading to other animals? Sultan	East Coast fever can be prevented by two methods. First, animals can be dipped; animals can be sent to the dip tank and dipped there. Or the animal can be sprayed by the farmer, using a knapsack sprayer, with a reputable acaricide. And the second method is through immunisation. They can be immunised or vaccinated against East Coast fever when they are still young or even when they are adult. The vaccine is a long-life vaccine, so you don?t need to repeat it. So it is economical actually to immunise your animal. Firstly you will protect the animal, and second, you can even reduce the cost of acaricides. Laiser	One of the ways of preventing the disease is to spray or dip the animals. Is it good for a farmer to spray an animal himself or herself? Sultan	Yes, it is much better if a farmer knows how to mix the acaricide, and he knows the area where ticks are mostly found in the body of the animal, then he can spray himself. That is very good, because at least he can protect the animal. But in case, if the farmer does not know, it is much better to use a dip tank, if the dip tank is available in the village. Or else the farmer can also get assistance from a nearby Community Based Animal Health Worker, or can even ask a village extension officer, so that he can be trained. He can be shown how to calculate the dosage of acaricide with water, and shown the areas where he is supposed to spray the animal on the body. Laiser	How many livestock can be affected, according to your experience ? you are living in the villages and treating animals all the time? Sultan	Actually if you look at the trend of the life-cycle of the ticks, you find that, especially during the rainy season the incidence of East Coast fever is very high. And you may also find that many animals are suffering. And the high mortality rate is to the young animals ? it is very very high. If you don?t protect the young animals, then you may eventually lose most of them. But it is advisable that farmers should adhere to the advice from the extension officers, that they should regularly dip their animals or spray their animals, so that they can reduce the tick burdens, and hence reduce even tick borne diseases, and especially East Coast fever. Laiser	Do you have any word you would like to say to the farmers? Sultan	Yes, thank you very much. What I would like to say to the farmers, is that the farmers should come together, even to form their own small association. So that they will be able to discuss the welfare of their animals, and how can they also increase the production. They have to organise themselves to manage the dip tank. Suppose someone comes from outside and wants to manage the dip tank, they have to go there and dip their animals. Not that they send two out of 100 hundred animals to dip there, because they feel that if they dip all animals that is very expensive. But what I advise them, is that if you have 50 cattle, and you sell one, that money can assist you to solve many problems of animal health care. End of track.
