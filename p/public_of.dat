5|$|Following the government's {{closure of}} most of the schools in the 1960s, the work of Indigenous activists and historians led to greater {{awareness}} by the <b>public</b> <b>of</b> the damage the schools had caused, as well as to official government and church apologies, and a legal settlement.

It shows how the apparently 'new' <b>publics</b> <b>of</b> these experiments were called up by invoking various pre-existing norms <b>of</b> <b>public</b> action and begins to consider how these mediated forms <b>of</b> <b>public</b> action might be conceptualised...|$|R

5|$|The {{libretto}} was fabricated on {{the basis}} of old legends about Duke Robert the Magnificent of Normandy, the father of William the Conqueror, alleged in some versions to have been the son of the Devil. The librettists padded out this outline with a variety of melodramatic incidents. The plot reflected 'the fantastic legendary elements which fascinated the opera <b>public</b> <b>of</b> 1830', a taste which had evolved from the 1824 Paris production of Carl Maria von Weber's Der Freischütz (in its French version Robin des bois), which also features a doubtful hero befriended by a demon promising him success.|$|E

5|$|Following the marriage, {{there was}} a period of {{consolidation}} taking the form of a series of statutes of the Reformation Parliament aimed at finding solutions to any remaining issues, whilst protecting the new reforms from challenge, convincing the <b>public</b> <b>of</b> their legitimacy, and exposing and dealing with opponents. Although the canon law was dealt with at length by Cranmer and others, these acts were advanced by Thomas Cromwell, Thomas Audley and the Duke of Norfolk and indeed by Henry himself. With this process complete, in May 1532 More resigned as Lord Chancellor, leaving Cromwell as Henry's chief minister. With the Act of Succession 1533, Catherine's daughter, Mary, was declared illegitimate; Henry's marriage to Anne was declared legitimate; and Anne's issue was decided to be next in the line of succession. With the Acts of Supremacy in 1534, Parliament also recognised the King's status as head of the church in England and, with the Act in Restraint of Appeals in 1532, abolished the right of appeal to Rome. It was only then that Pope Clement took the step of excommunicating Henry and Thomas Cranmer, although the excommunication was not made official until some time later.|$|E
5|$|Longchamp's legatine {{commission}} {{from the}} papacy expired in spring 1191, {{on the death}} of Clement III, thus removing one of Longchamp's power bases. The legation was, however, renewed a few months later by Clement's successor, Celestine III. A further complication for Longchamp arose in September 1191, when Henry II's illegitimate son Geoffrey, Archbishop of York, was arrested by Longchamp's subordinates, led by the castellan of Dover Castle, Longchamp's brother-in-law. Their orders had been to arrest the Archbishop of York as he landed at Dover on the archbishop's return to England, but Geoffrey had been warned of their plans, and fled to sanctuary in St. Martin's Priory. Longchamp's men laid siege to the priory, and after four days forcibly removed Geoffrey. The violence of the attack reminded the <b>public</b> <b>of</b> Thomas Becket's martyrdom, and public opinion turned against Longchamp. Longchamp claimed that Geoffrey had not sworn fealty to Richard, but this was likely just an excuse to eliminate a rival.|$|E
5|$|On October29, Honduras President Ricardo Maduro {{declared}} a State of National Emergency as Beta was forecast to bring heavy rains up to 12in (300mm). Three departments, Gracias a Dios, Colon, Olancho and El Paraiso, were placed under Red Alert and mandatory evacuations {{were put in}} place. The departments of Atlántida, Yoro, Comayagua, Francisco Morazán and Choluteca were placed under Yellow Alert and a Green Alert was {{in place for the}} rest of the country. The Local Emergency Management Agency opened its regional and municipal offices to conduct preparative activities. An emergency radio network was set up to alert the <b>public</b> <b>of</b> any emergencies. The government designated several public schools as shelters for the affected population. In the Francisco Morazán Department, the Tegucigalpa Municipal Emergency Committee opened 73 shelters. Extensive cleaning and garbage disposal was conducted, especially around creeks, rivers, and sewers. The National Armed Forces were placed in strategic areas and were on stand-by for search and rescue operations once the storm passed. About 3,306tons (3,000tonnes) of food was reported to be available and local travels in the country were suspended. In Tegucigalpa, the emergency committee called for the evacuation of 125,000 people from the most vulnerable areas of the capital. About 8,000 others were evacuated from 50 communities along the Nicaragua border due to the threat of flooding. A hurricane alert was put in place for areas north of the Nicaragua border but was cancelled on October30 after Beta turned towards the southeast.|$|E

5|$|Vietnamese {{fishermen}} in the South China Sea received 24hours of warning from the National Hydrometerological Forecast Center before Chanchu approached the area, {{less time than}} other agencies in the region. At one point, Chanchu was forecast to become a strong typhoon and make landfall near Hong Kong. In response to the threat, officials at the Hong Kong Observatory, {{as well as in}} Macau, issued a standby signal to inform the <b>public</b> <b>of</b> the approaching typhoon. The HKO issued a warning signal number 3 on May17. In the territory, 60flights were canceled with another 14 delayed, beaches were closed, and ferry service was disrupted. Ahead of the storm, about 1million people evacuated from coastal Guangdong and Fujian provinces to government warehouses, schools, tents, or the houses of relatives. In the former province, 62,000fishermen were ordered to return to port, while four flights were canceled at Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport. Residents were advised to remain indoors, and workers reinforced billboards in anticipation of the strong winds. Rail and boat transport was stopped between Guangdong and Hainan across the Qiongzhou Strait due to the typhoon. Schools were closed in Guangdong during the storm's passage, although they remained open in Fujian. In Shanghai, the speed limit of Donghai Bridge was halved because of strong winds.|$|E
