50|$|Using two {{adsorbent}} vessels allows near-continuous {{production of}} the target gas.

40|$|The {{modified}} <b>pressure</b> with stored <b>equalisation</b> (MPSE) {{method of}} soundfield equalisation is universally recommended {{for use in}} clinical practice during the real-ear measurement (REM) verification of open-canal (OC) hearing aids. This is because the MPSE method deactivates the reference microphone for aided measurements and so is not susceptible to the leakage of amplified sound from the open ear canal when fitting OC devices. However, the deactivation of the reference microphone means that the MPSE method will be susceptible to errors resulting from head movements during aided measurements and the magnitude of such errors has not been well explored in the literature. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate how much small horizontal head movements can influence the accuracy of REMs when using the MPSE method. Real-ear unaided responses (REURs) were measured in 28 participants at horizontal head deviations of 0 °, ± 5 °, ± 10 °, ± 15 °, and ± 20 ° azimuth relative to the two loudspeaker-to-client azimuths of 0 ° and 45 °. The difference between the baseline REUR measured when no head deviation was made and the REURs measured for each head deviation was then calculated so that the magnitude of REM errors arising from these head movements could be determined. Statistical analysis revealed {{no significant difference between}} the REM errors for the 0 ° and 45 ° loudspeaker-to-client azimuths. REM errors of typically less than 1 dB were obtained when no head deviation was made (i. e. 0 ° head deviation), indicating that no clinically significant errors are introduced when using the MPSE method provided patients keep their heads still. However, the REM errors were found to increase with increasing head deviation up to ± 20 ° where the errors were typically less than 2 dB. The magnitude of these head movement induced errors are not clinically significant on their own but it is recommended that head movements are minimised as much as possible so that REM targets can be matched more accurately...|$|R

The world's first successful manned space station mission was however overshadowed when the crew was killed before the re-entry of Soyuz 11 on 30 June 1971 - a <b>pressure</b> <b>equalisation</b> valve in the descent module of the Soyuz had opened prematurely when the three modules of the spacecraft separated, suffocating all three.|$|E
50|$|Other {{reconstruction}} measures {{included the}} installation of axle box tightening wedges and {{the replacement of the}} Krauss-Helmholtz bogies. Despite often expressed views to the contrary, the valves were not replaced or rebuilt as part of the reconstruction. The 52.80 had standard piston valves with Winterthur <b>pressure</b> <b>equalisation</b> and hence poor riding qualities when running light. Not until the 1980s were Trofimoff valves and cylinder safety valves installed on some locomotives at RAW Meiningen. This improved the riding performance hugely when the engines ran without a train, something which was also noticeable in terms of savings in lubricants and fuel.|$|E

50|$|The {{loudspeaker}} driver's {{moving mass}} and compliance (slackness or reciprocal stiffness of the suspension) determines the driver's resonant frequency (Fs). In {{combination with the}} damping properties of the system (both mechanical and electrical) all these factors affect the low-frequency response of sealed-box systems. Output falls below the system's resonant frequency (Fc), defined as the frequency of peak impedance. In a closed-box, the air inside the box acts as a spring, returning the cone to the 'zero' position {{in the absence of}} a signal. A significant increase in the effective volume of a sealed-box loudspeaker can be achieved by a filling of fibrous material, typically fiberglass, bonded acetate fiber (BAF) or long-fiber wool. The effective volume increase can be as much as 40% and is due primarily to a reduction in the speed of sound propagation through the filler material as compared to air. The enclosure or driver must have a small leak so internal and external pressures can equalise over time, to compensate for barometric pressure or altitude; the porous nature of paper cones, or an imperfectly sealed enclosure, is normally sufficient to provide this slow <b>pressure</b> <b>equalisation.</b>|$|E
40|$|Curtain wall systems {{typically}} rely {{on pressure}} equalization {{to achieve a}} good watertightness. The insulating glass unit is clamped to the mullion between two gaskets, functioning as a rain screen and airtightness layer. When the curtain wall system is subjected to wind driven rain and a pressure difference, water may penetrate past the first gasket into the drained cavity. Depending on the airtightness of the interior and exterior gaskets, the <b>pressure</b> <b>equalisation</b> will determine the actual pressure over the exterior gasket. That pressure, in combination with hydrostatic pressure from water runoff, {{is the most important}} driving forces for water ingress. In this paper, the watertightness and drainage of water in curtain wall systems is investigated. In an experimental setup, a fullscale curtain wall system was subjected to a range of pressure differences under static and cyclic test procedures. For each condition, the water ingress into the drained cavity was measured. Next to that, the phenomenology of water ingress was analyzed based on airtightness measurements, dynamic watertightness tests, and <b>pressure</b> <b>equalisation...</b>|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} shield the indoor {{environment}} from the exterior most building components are assembled out of several layers of materials to meet different performance requirements (watertightness, airtightness, thermal resistance, stability etc). In that regard windows and doors are usually the weak spot of the building {{because it is a}} transition from the building component to the glass where all the different materials and functions are literally forced together. On top we want them to open and close, so that interface becomes even more crucial and we need to use somewhat exotic fabrics to rise up to the challenge (the bill will rise accordingly). This research area is much too often left to the industry. <b>Pressure</b> <b>equalisation</b> is the basic principle where windows and doors derive their performance from, but how can this be realised, and what are the main parameters that influence it? As in walls and roofs we can distinguish different elements in the window casement that will fulfil those needs and influence the performance: the section, joggles, gaskets and fittings (handle, gearbox, locking bar, corner pivot, stay, hinges…). Using high frequency measuring equipment the influence of the different elements is examined in both dry as well as rainy conditions during static and dynamic pressure differences. The <b>pressure</b> <b>equalisation</b> in the chamber is depending on the collaboration of the profile and the gaskets, the design of the vents and drainage holes, and the fine-tuning of the fittings...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{separation}} {{capability of}} carbon dioxide from high temperature syngas was evaluated using zeolite 13 X, calcium chabazite and hydrotalcite materials by means of measuring isotherms and breakthrough curves under the different operating temperatures at 7 bar and assessing the performance in pressure vacuum swing adsorption (PVSA) cycles. Four different PVSA processes were designed for a dual-bed apparatus and operated at 120  °C and 200  °C. Zeolite 13 X was selected for the PVSA processes due to its acceptable adsorption capacity for CO 2 at elevated temperatures and fast kinetics. CO 2 product purities ranging from 80 to 98 % were obtained from a feed gas of 12 % CO 2. From the PVSA experiments, {{it was found that}} a <b>pressure</b> <b>equalisation</b> step and product purge step improved the carbon capture performance in terms of CO 2 concentration. Contamination of the adsorbents was observed after 24 hours of operation and the contaminants originating from the syngas were identified as heavy hydrocarbons...|$|E
40|$|Sorption-enhanced water–gas shift (SEWGS) {{combines}} the water–gas shift reaction with in situ adsorption of CO 2 on potassium-promoted hydrotalcite (K-HTC) and thereby allows production of hot, high pressure H 2 from syngas {{in a single}} unit operation. SEWGS is a cyclic process, that comprises high pressure adsorption and rinse, <b>pressure</b> <b>equalisation,</b> and low pressure purge. Here, results are presented of a SEWGS cycle design study, based on recently developed expressions for the interaction of CO 2 and H 2 O with K-HTC. It is shown that during the cycle, steam adsorbs in the rinse step and desorbs during the subsequent reduction in pressure, thereby improving the CO 2 purity in the column and thus enhancing {{the efficiency of the}} rinse. A parameter study based on numerical simulations shows that the carbon capture ratio depends mainly on the purge steam to carbon feed ratio, whereas the CO 2 product purity depends mainly on the rinse steam to carbon feed ratio. An optimisation yields a SEWGS cycle that consumes significantly less steam than cycle designs previously reported in the literature...|$|E
40|$|High-rise {{buildings}} {{can cause}} high wind speed near ground level and on building balconies necessitating remedial action. In {{order to reduce}} wind discomfort on balconies, different measures can be taken. This paper presents the evaluation of a new second-skin facade concept to improve wind comfort at building balconies. The concept consists of a staggered semi-open second-skin facade {{in front of the}} balconies, which partly shields them from the wind. CFD simulations are performed for the building with and without second-skin facade concept. Validation is conducted using wind-tunnel measurements of surface pressure distribution on a building model with balconies. Next, the CFD results are combined with wind speed statistics and a comfort criterion to judge wind comfort on the balconies, according to the Dutch wind nuisance standard. The analysis shows that this concept is effective in providing a zone with <b>pressure</b> <b>equalisation</b> at the balconies. The related reduction in pressure gradients across the width of the facade strongly decreases the local wind speed. At many positions along the balconies this yields a wind comfort improvement of one or even two classes in the Dutch wind nuisance standard compared to the situation without implementation of this concept...|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{tensiometers}} for direct measurement of matric suction {{have been developed}} at Imperial College and later on at the University of Saskatchewan. The major drawback of these instruments is water cavitation which may occur before <b>pressure</b> <b>equalisation.</b> A {{better understanding of the}} mechanisms that control cavitation inside the tensiometer may therefore help optimise their design and define adequate experimental procedures. This paper presents some of the experiences gained {{over the past four years}} using three tensiometers manufactured by Imperial College. Some of the anomalous responses recorded by tensiometers are first discussed. These were probably due to inadequate saturation of the porous ceramic rather than malfunctioning of the instruments. The results from a series of tests conducted with two or three tensiometers positioned on the same sample are then presented. These were helpful in defining suitable experimental procedures. Finally, the history of tension breakdown of each tensiometer is examined to identify some of the factors that affect the maximum sustainable tension as well as measurement duration. On the basis of data recorded before and after cavitation, a possible mechanism of cavitation in a tensiometer is described...|$|E

We investigated the somatosensory representation {{of the middle ear}} in 15 normal hearing subjects. We applied small air pressure variations to the tympanic membrane while performing a 3 T fMRI study. Unilateral stimulations of the right ear triggered bilateral activations in the caudal part of the postcentral gyrus in Brodmann area 43 (BA 43) and in the auditory associative areas 42 (BA 42) and 22 (BA 22). BA 43 {{has been found to be}} involved in activities accompanying oral inserm- 00638231, version 1 - 4 Nov 2011 intake, and could be more largely involved in pressure activities in the oropharynx area. The tympanic membrane is indirectly related to the pharynx area through the action of tensor tympani, which is a Eustachian tube muscle. The Eustachian tube muscles have a role in <b>pressure</b> <b>equalisation</b> in the middle ear and also have a role in the pharyngeal phase of swallowing.

40|$|AbstractVacuum glazing units (VGUs) {{are thought}} to be a type of glazing system with {{superior}} effective insulation performance. However, the differential pressure between the outside and the inner spaces and the supporting pillars create a high pre-existing stress field in the constituent glass during fabrication and hence make the units highly susceptible to breakage, even under small applied loads. In order to address this problem, a novel hybrid vacuum/triple glazing system with a <b>pressure</b> <b>equalisation</b> design has been devised and is reported in this paper. In this system, a VGU is enclosed by two glass panels to form a triple glazing unit system. This new design creates an equalised air pressure {{on both sides of the}} VGU hence subjects the VGU to no additional loads apart from the inherent fabrication stresses. This results in a high thermal and sound insulation as well as a more durable safety performance of the hybrid glazing component. Pressure tests were undertaken on the novel glazing system to confirm its reliability. Results show that under various loading levels, the stresses and deflections in the VGU of this novel glazing system always remain at a marginal level, and hence the likelihood of breakage for VGUs can be reduced significantly...|$|E
40|$|The {{application}} of Photovoltaic (PV) systems {{has been supported}} strongly by the Dutch Government during the recent years. Several big projects have been heavily subsidised. At first instance this seems surprising, because the costs for PV -systems are very high, specifically in The Netherlands, with low energy prices and a very efficient energy distribution network. The policy however, {{is based on the}} opinion that large-scale introduction of network coupled PV -systems is the best solution to the future shortage in fossil fuels. An important advantage of PV -systems is {{that they do not have}} any moving parts and therefore are practically maintenance free and also do not produce any noise. Specifically when they are integrated in the building envelope (as building materials) they do not require any extra space such as windmills. Two major projects that recently have been realised are Nieuw-Sloten near Amsterdam and Nieuwland at Amersfoort with 250 kWp and 1, 3 MWp installed capacity respectively. The paper describes the procedures that have been developed to evaluate integrated PV -roofs. These procedures are mainly based on prototype testing and need to be scientifically validated. Knowledge gaps are observed, specifically with respect to building physical aspects such as the possible need for ventilation, ther mal performance, <b>pressure</b> <b>equalisation</b> and driving rain effects...|$|E

SEWGS is a cyclic process, that comprises high pressure adsorption and rinse, <b>pressure</b> <b>equalisation,</b> and lowpressure purge. In order to design theSEWGS process, the equilibria and kinetics of adsorptionmust beknownfor the entire pressure range. Here, amulticomponent adsorptionisothermis presented for CO 2 and H 2 O on K-HTC at 400 C and 0. 5 – 24 bar partial pressure, that has been derived from integrated experimentally determined breakthrough curves with special attention being given to the high pressure interaction. The experimental results can be well described by assuming that the isothermconsists of a lowpartial pressure surface adsorption part and a high partial pressure nanopore adsorption part. Surface adsorption occurs at specific and different sites for CO 2 or H 2 O. In contrast, the nanopore adsorption mechanism is competitive and explains the interaction observed in the capacity data at partial pressures over 5 bar. Based {{on the characteristics of}} the sorbent particles, a linear driving force relation has been derived for sorption kinetics.

40|$|Triaxial {{testing is}} {{probably}} the most widely used laboratory test by geotechnical engineers to determine the stress-strain-shear strength behaviour of saturated soils. Conventional testing requires back pressure saturation to achieve a degree of saturation {{as close as possible to}} unity. Following saturation, the sample is typically isotropically consolidated by either increasing the cell pressure of reducing the back pressure (ideally increasing the cell pressure to prevent dissolution of the air). The results of the consolidation phase are then used to select an appropriate strain rate - the rate of axial deformation. The requirements for dissipation of pore pressure during a drained test (CD) are widely recognised; equally important are the rates of axial straining in a consolidated undrained (CU) test and the relation of these strain rates to the anticipated rates of failure in the field. A comparison of current Australian Standard (AS) "informative" method for determination of the strain rate in undrained shearing is made with the American and British Standards. The AS suggests significantly higher strain rates, which will lead to higher undrained strengths between lab and field, an effect which is not well understood. Finally the AS rate is too fast to allow pore <b>pressure</b> <b>equalisation</b> prior to failure, and any test involving different stages pre-failure must use a significantly slower axial strain rate...|$|E

This paper presents the evaluation of a new facade concept that is intended to significantly reduce the wind speed and therefore improve wind comfort on the balconies of high-rise buildings. The concept consists of a staggered semi-open second-skin facade {{in front of the}} balconies, which partly shields them from the wind. The concept is evaluated for the new 78 m high Park Tower in the urban area of Antwerp, where it will be implemented. 3 D steady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations are performed for the case with and without this facade concept. The simulations are made with the realizable k-epsilon turbulence model on a high-resolution grid. Validation is conducted using wind-tunnel measurements of surface pressure distribution on a building model with balconies. Wind comfort for the Park Tower is assessed with the Dutch wind nuisance standard NEN 8100 for the case with and without the second-skin facade concept. The analysis shows that this concept is effective in providing a zone with <b>pressure</b> <b>equalisation</b> at the balconies. The related reduction in pressure gradients across the width of the facade strongly decreases the local wind speed.

VAPORMATE is a patented post harvest fumigant which controls insects in stored grains, fresh produce & food processing equipment. VAPORMATE is dispensed as a fog (particle size ~ 5 - 10 microns) or hot (~ 60 oC) gas mixture to assist uniform distribution and optimise efficacy. VAPORMATE [“No Withholding Period ” status] applications include: niche alternative for methyl bromide (eg grain, dried fruit, nuts etc); rapid treatment: eg 50 -tonne silo of grain: 12 minutes to apply, three hours to fumigate and two hours to air out with no withholding period; disinfestation of food processing equipment containing food residues; modified Atmosphere Package (MAP) treatment for packaged food. VAPORMATE dispensing innovations include: spraying product via a manual hand gun to treat food processing equipment as the resultant “fog” permeated the spaces quickly being propelled by the high cylinder pressure (50 bar = 800 psi). This application is assisted having the VAPORMATE piped {{to a number of}} locations throughout the food plant; VAPORMATE is vaporised as a hot gas and dispensed using aeration fans in grain storages (product is dispensed during one air change); VAPORMATE is vaporised as a hot gas and dispensed using novel mixing devices based on <b>pressure</b> <b>equalisation</b> or venturi principles to dilute the hot gaseous mixture with atmospheric air to optimise use.

40|$|Today, the {{reduction}} of manufacturing costs is a big challenge to the aircraft industry and the usage of prepreg materials is state of the art. It is known that the impregnation of dry fibre materials with a liquid resin can reduce the manufacturing costs. But for future applications of infusion processes for aircraft parts, {{it is essential to}} provide a good laminate quality and to reduce the scrap rate. Therefrom, a new infusion method for out-of-autoclave and autoclave- based processes will be investigated. A conventional vacuum infusion process uses a single-sided mould and a flexible vacuum bag to form a cavity for the composite part. The resin feed channels and other supplies distribute the resin over the composite part. The new method uses resin distribution channels beyond the vacuum bag and a pressure difference between these channels and the mould cavity. Therefore, the channels have no immediate contact to the resin and they are reusable for other parts. The channels will be pressurised with a pressure lower than the resin pressure. This enables the resin to flow primarily in this area. To stop the resin flow, <b>pressure</b> <b>equalisation</b> between resin and channels will be applied. This has the advantage that the channels will not leave any marks on the part surface. By this method, resin flow fronts can be manipulated and the risk of dry spots is reduced. This infusion process is combined with an automated mixing and dosing unit for a continuous processing of a two- component resin system. The mixing ratio and the pressure difference between the ambient and the resin pressure are automatically controlled. For autoclave applications, the resin pressure is up to 10 bars. To improve the viscosity, both components of the epoxy can be preheated to a temperature of 80 °C and therefore the handling of resin systems like Hexcel RTM 6 - 2 is permitted. The new approach will help to enhance the infusion of aircraft parts and it will also reduce the manufacturing costs of composite parts...|$|E
40|$|Amplitude-versus-offset, AVO, approximations {{allow the}} {{estimation}} of various properties from pre-stack seismic gathers. Recently {{it has been suggested}} that fluid mobility is a controlling factor in pore <b>pressure</b> <b>equalisation</b> and can result in anomalous velocity dispersion in the seismic bandwidth. However, current approximations all assume an elastic subsurface and are unable to account for velocity dispersion. I have applied existing methodologies to a real dataset to qualitatively detect and interpret spectral amplitude anomalies. Three areas had AVO and spectral signature consistent with frequency-dependent AVO theory. The results suggest that it is feasible to measure such effects on real data in the presence of random noise. It would imply that the relaxation parameter, tau, is larger in the field than has been measured in water-saturated real and synthetic sandstones in the laboratory. I extended a two-term AVO approximation by accounting for velocity dispersion and showed how the resultant reflection coefficient becomes frequency-dependent. I then used this to measure P- and S-wave reflectivity dispersion using spectrally-balanced amplitudes. The inversion was able to quantify the affect of the P-wave velocity dispersion as an instantaneous effect on the reflection. NMO stretch was an issue at the far offsets and I limited myself to the near offsets and effectively measured only the P-wave reflectivity dispersion. I showed how the P-wave reflectivity dispersion signs depend on the AVO classification of the reflection whilst the magnitude depends on the crack density of my model. I showed how the effect of noise and thin-bed tuning can enter uncertainties into the interpretation of spectral anomalies. Whilst it is possible to detect frequency-dependent AVO signatures on pre-stack gathers, the interpretation remains non-unique. I have quantitatively measured a new physical property, reflectivity dispersion, from pre-stack seismic data. I have presented a method of detecting and measuring velocity dispersion in pre-stack gathers but there remain ambiguities in the interpretation of such results. The approach incorporates spectrally decomposed data in an extended AVO inversion scheme. Future work should investigate the application of the methodology to a real seismic dataset.

40|$|The aim of {{the project}} was to {{investigate}} the behaviour of coarse and fine colliery discards with respect to liquefaction potential, using controlled load triaxial testing. It was hoped to relate the behaviour in these tests to measured material properties such as strength, shape, chemistry and mineralogy. The investigation of coarse discards contrasted the behaviour of a weak, seatearth-rich discard from Gedling Colliery with that of a strong shale-rich discard from Abernant Colliery. The former showed some liquefaction potential at low confining pressures, while the latter showed no liquefaction potential. A seatearth and a shale from County Durham were used to demonstrate say possible links between these basic materials and the behaviours observed. However, both showed responses similar to the Gedling discard. Investigation of material properties indicated that the strength of material, its stability in water and its facility for pore <b>pressure</b> <b>equalisation</b> were the most important factors influencing response during controlled load testing. The strength and stability of the material are probably related to its organic carbon content. The Abernant discard had a high strength and stability in water and showed good potential for equalisation of pore pressures during testing, in contrast to the other three materials. Tests on mixtures of Abernant discard and the Durham seatearth showed a transition between the behaviours of the end materials for a mixture containing between 20 and 25 per cent seatearth. Tests on fine discard from Peckfield Colliery showed significant differences in behaviour between samples from the lagoon and those fabricated in the laboratory. The former showed strong dilatant behaviour, while the latter showed some potential for liquefaction. This is probably due to differences in soil structure (organisation of particles). Tests on fine discard from Abernant showed a high potential for liquefaction. The most significant difference, possibly affecting liquefaction potential, between this discard and that from Peckfield was the uniformity of grading, the Abernant discard being considerably more uniform. The results for the Abernant fine discard showed no correlation with those for the coarse discard from the same colliery...|$|E
