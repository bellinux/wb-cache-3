50|$|Les Quinze joies de mariage (The 15 Joys of Marriage) is an {{anonymous}} late 14th or early 15th century French satire in prose which presents a <b>picture,</b> full of <b>sharpness</b> and humour, of the rows and deceits which afflict the married state. The misogynist satire is allied to a pitiless {{analysis of the}} blindness of husbands in everyday, concrete situations.|$|R
40|$|This paper aims to make {{a clearer}} <b>picture</b> of the <b>sharpness</b> of {{grinding}} wheels {{in terms of the}} wheel performance in grinding. It was found that the system time constant is the most sensitive to any change in wheel dressing operation, which has strong eVects on the wheel topography. The effects of dressing conditions were investigated together with the grinding conditions. Some control strategies for improvement of the grinding operation by considering wheel sharpness are presented in the paper...|$|R
2500|$|The {{series was}} filmed in high-definition and mixed in Dolby Digital 5.1 {{surround}} sound. It {{is believed to}} be the first time a HD camera has been taken into a war zone and used in this way The director commented: [...] "We had long discussions about the HD cameras. The advantages are <b>pictures</b> of amazing <b>sharpness,</b> how all the awful things of war are caught in a kind of surreal colour, war in all its terrible detail. There was, of course, a price to pay for this." [...] The HD cameras were approximately four times heavier than the cameras which are usually used for filming of this type. They are also more than 20 times more expensive, costing up to £100,000 each.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} days of colour {{television}} (from the mid 1950s to the early 1960s) studio cameras were heavy and hot-running because of the vacuum tube (thermionic valve) circuitry that they contained, in addition to three large image orthicon pick-up tubes.With these cameras there was always a tendency for the three coloured images to drift out of registration, over time, giving a consequential loss of <b>picture</b> <b>sharpness.</b>|$|E
50|$|In RF-transmitted {{composite}} video, subcarriers {{remain in}} the baseband signal after main carrier demodulation to be separated in the receiver. The mono audio component of the transmitted signal is in a separate carrier and not integral to the video component. In wired video connections, composite video retains the integrated subcarrier signal structure found in the transmitted baseband signal, while S-Video places the chrominance and luminance subcarriers on separate wires to eliminate subcarrier crosstalk and enhance the signal bandwidth and strength (<b>picture</b> <b>sharpness</b> and brightness).|$|E

5000|$|On 8 July 1988, rival tycoon Rupert Murdoch, {{having failed}} to gain {{regulatory}} approval for his own satellite service, and failing {{to become part of}} the BSB consortium announced that his pan-European television station, Sky Channel, would be relaunched as a four channel UK-based service called Sky Television, using the Astra system and broadcast in PAL with analogue sound. BSB had been aware of the impending launch of Astra when it submitted its proposal to the IBA in 1986, but had discounted it. Lazard Brothers, the Pearson subsidiary responsible for BSB’s first fundraising memorandum, reportedly regarded Astra as technology-led rather than programming-led and, therefore, an unlikely threat. The stage was set for a dramatic confrontation. BSB, anticipated as the UK's only satellite service, was faced with an aggressive drive by Murdoch's Sky to be the first service to launch. As Britain's official satellite television provider, BSB had high hopes, as the company planned to provide a mixture of highbrow programming and popular entertainment, from arts and opera to blockbuster movies and music videos. The service would also be technically superior, broadcasting in the D-MAC (Multiplexed Analogue Components type D) system dictated by European Union regulations with potentially superior <b>picture</b> <b>sharpness,</b> digital stereo sound and the potential to show widescreen programming, rather than the existing PAL system. BSB criticised Sky's proposals, claiming that the PAL pictures would be too degraded by satellite transmission, and that in any case, BSB would broadcast superior programming. SES had no regulatory permission to broadcast, had plans (initially) for only one satellite with no backup and the European satellite launch vehicle Ariane suffered repeated failures. However SES used the resulting delay time to re-engineer the satellite to reduce the dish size needed which would otherwise have been larger than 60 cm (24"). To distance itself from Sky and its dish antennas, BSB announced a new type of flat-plate satellite antenna called a [...] "Squarial" [...] (i.e., [...] "square aerial"). The illustrative model Squarial shown to the press was a dummy and BSB commissioned a working version which was under 45 cm (18") wide. A conventional dish of the same diameter was also available. The company had serious technical problems with the development of ITT's D-MAC silicon chips needed for its MAC receivers. BSB was still hoping to launch that September 1989, but eventually had to admit that the launch would be delayed.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: A long {{standing}} and challenging problem with digital video is the temporal fluctuation noise which impairs digital video picture quality, due to either techniques used for compression or spatial de-noising techniques to minimise random noise incurred in video acquisition or transmission process. For instance, while the H. 264 /AVC video coding standard uses a spatial loop-filter {{to reduce the}} blocking artefact, the temporal fluctuation artefact is still noticeable between intra-coded frames or between an intra (I) frame and its preceding or subsequent inter prediction (P) frames. This talk will present the robust statistical temporal filtering (RSTF), a non-linear temporal post-filtering framework using a robust prior model to reduce the temporal fluctuation and to preserve <b>picture</b> <b>sharpness</b> of the reconstructed video. Performance of the fluctuation reduction with proposed filter is evaluated by a temporal metric, namely the sum of square difference (SSD), and a traditional metric, the peak {{signal to noise ratio}} (PSNR). Significant reduction of temporal fluctuation artefacts has been observed using the RSTF, compared with existing benchmar...|$|E
