40|$|International audienceRATIONALE: <b>Procymidone</b> is a dicarboximide {{fungicide}} mainly {{used for}} vineyard protection {{but also for}} different crops. The structural elucidation of by-products arising from the UV-visible photodegradation of <b>procymidone</b> has been investigated by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. The potential toxicities of photoproducts were estimated by in silico tests. METHODS: Aqueous solutions of <b>procymidone</b> were irradiated for up to 90 min in a self-made reactor equipped with a mercury lamp. Analyses were carried out on a gas chromatograph coupled with an ion trap mass spectrometer operated in electron ionization and methanol positive chemical ionization. Multistage collision-induced dissociation (CID) experiments were performed to establish dissociation pathways of ions. Toxicities of byproducts were estimated using the QSAR T. E. S. T. program. RESULTS: Sixteen photoproducts were investigated. Chemical structures were proposed mainly based on the interpretation of multistage CID experiments, but also on their relative retention times and kinetics data. These structures enabled photodegradation pathways to be suggested. Only three photoproducts remain present after 90 min of irradiation. Among them, 3, 5 -dichloroaniline presents a predicted rat LD 50 toxicity about ten times {{greater than that of}} <b>procymidone.</b> CONCLUSIONS: 3, 5 -Dichloroaniline is the only photoproduct reported in previous articles. Eight by-products among the sixteen characterized might be as toxic, if not more, than <b>procymidone</b> itself considering the QSAR-predicted rat LD 50.

The drying process caused a fruit concentration factor of 4, while the decreases in residue with the two drying processes were different for the different pesticides. In sunlight-drying the residue level in the raisins was identical {{to that in the}} fresh fruits for benalaxyl, metalaxyl, and phosalone, whereas it was higher for iprodione (1. 6) and lower for vinclozolin and dimethoate (one-third and one-fifth, respectively). The oven-drying process was preceded by washing, which caused residue decreases for iprodione and <b>procymidone</b> of 57 and 41 %, respectively, whereas no decrease was observed in all of the other pesticides. During oven-drying pesticide residues in raisins with respect to fresh fruits showed an increase of 2. 7 for phosalone, the same values for benalaxyl, metalaxyl, and <b>procymidone,</b> and lower values for vinclozolin and dimethoate. Sunlight-drying was more effective for phosalone and vinclozolin, whereas oven-drying was more effective for iprodione and <b>procymidone,</b> which was due to the washing effect rather than to dehydration. The experiments carried out with a model system showed that the decrease in dimethoate is attributable to heat, whereas in benalaxyl, <b>procymidone,</b> and phosalone it is due to codistillation and in iprodione and metalaxyl to the combined action of heat and codistillation...|$|E

Chemigation with fungicides {{is used for}} disease control, but effectiveness of this application method and impact of irrigation level on residual fungicide activity in the plant over time under field conditions has not been well characterized. To assess the best method of application and fungicide for disease control, we conducted field studies in three field sites in São Paulo State in Brazil. Contact fungicide, fluazinam, was applied via center pivot at three irrigation levels (2. 5, 5. 1, 10. 1 mm) at the Itaí field site in 2013. Fluazinam and <b>procymidone</b> (systemic) were independently applied via sprinkler at three irrigation levels (3. 0, 4. 5, 6. 0 mm) in 2013 and four irrigation levels (2. 5, 5. 0, 7. 5, 10. 0 mm) in 2014 at the Pereiras field site. Fungicides were also applied at the Pereiras site using a backpack sprayer in 2014. Three successive fungicide applications were made at Pereiras in 2013 and two successive applications made at Pereiras in 2014. Three leaves from each treatment of the four replicated plots were collected in 2 -day intervals after application, and fungicide residues assessed using a detached leaf bioassay. Lesion areas were used to estimate percent disease control. Regardless of fungicide or application method, disease control decreased over time (ANCOVA; P 3 ̆c 0. 05). Area under the disease progress curve estimated from leaf lesion areas showed chemigation at the lowest irrigation level provided the best control in five of six trials of fluazinam and {{four out of five}} trials of <b>procymidone.</b> Ground applications were equally effective, showing no difference from chemigation at the lowest irrigation level in most comparisons.

40|$|Evidence is {{available}} that some endocrine disruptors, acting as selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), interfere with osteoblast differentiation and function. Therefore, we investigated whether 17 beta-estradiol, bisphenol-A (BSP), silymarin, genistein, resveratrol, <b>procymidone,</b> linurone and benzophenone- 3 (BP 3) modulate differentiation of rat calvarial osteoblast-like (ROB) cells in primary in vitro culture. Disruptors were added at day 18 {{of culture and}} cells were harvested 48 h later. Real time-PCR revealed that estradiol and resveratrol enhanced osteocalcin mRNA expression in ROB cells, while other disruptors were ineffective. The expression of osteonectin and collagen- 1 alpha was not affected by any disruptor. Estradiol, resveratrol, genistein and BSP stimulated the proliferative activity of ROB cells.

40|$|The {{environmental}} protection organisation Greenpeace presented analytical {{results on the}} levels of pesticide residues in grapes. A total of 124 samples of grapes were examined from supermarkets. According to the calculations by Greenpeace the acute reference dose (ARfD) was exceeded in one sample for the active substance, <b>procymidone.</b> This may be an indication {{that there could be}} a health threat for consumers. The acute reference dose indicates the amount of a substance which can be ingested in one meal or in the course of one day without there being a risk to health. In all other samples this health limit value was not exceeded. The Federal Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection asked the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) to undertake a health assessment of the data submitted. In its toxicological assessment BfR came to a different conclusion from that of Greenpeace. In one sample of grapes Greenpeace detected a residue of the active substance <b>procymidone</b> in a concentration of 1. 2 mg/kg. In order to calculate the health risk the organisation used the acute reference dose of the EU of 0. 035 mg/kg body weight (mg/kg BW) and the German consumption data for infants. Based on this, Greenpeace established a manifold exceeding of the acute reference dose and derived from this an acute health threat for children and adults. In the opinion of BfR the Greenpeace calculation is not, however, toxicologically substantiated. This is because the EU ARfD is based on a developmental toxicological effect which is not to be expected in conjunction with one-off intake. Furthermore, when it comes to a developmental toxicological effect the consumption data for women of child-bearing age should have been used instead of the data for children. At the same time, the Federal Institute does believe there is a need to keep maximum levels for pesticide residues as low as possible.

First, a total of 183 isolates were identified at the species level using specific primers for the glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase (G 3 PDH) gene. The isolates were grown on potato dextrose agar (PDA) containing the fungicides <b>procymidone,</b> iprodione, and thiophanate-methyl in different concentrations: 0. 0 (control), 0. 1; 1. 0; 10. 0; 100. 0 and 1, 000. 0 μg∙mL− 1. The percentage of mycelial growth inhibition was used to determine the effective concentration of the fungicide that was able to inhibit colony growth by 50 % (EC 50). Approximately 25. 7 % of the isolates were resistant to iprodione, 53. 0 % were resistant to <b>procymidone,</b> and 93. 0 % were resistant to thiophanate-methyl. Moreover, crossresistance and multiple resistance were verified, with 19. 7 % of the isolates showing resistance to 3 fungicides simultaneously.

METHODS: Test chemicals and mixtures were administered by gavage to time-mated nulliparous, young adult Wistar rats from gestational day 7 to the day before expected birth, and from postnatal days 1 – 16. Changes in anogenital distance (AGD) and nipple retention (NR) in male offspring rats were chosen as end points for extensive dose–response studies. Vinclozolin, flutamide, and <b>procymidone</b> were combined at a mixture ratio proportional to their individual potencies for causing retention of six nipples in male offspring. RESULTS: With AGD as the end point, the joint effects of the three anti-androgens were essentially dose additive. The observed responses for NR were slightly higher than those expected on the basis of dose addition. A combination of doses of each chemical, which on its own did not produce statistically significant AGD alterations, induced half-maximal mixture effects. At individual doses associated with only modest effects on NR, the mixture induced NR approaching female values in the males. CONCLUSIONS: Effects of a mixture of similarly acting anti-androgens can be predicted fairly accurately on the basis of the potency of the individual mixture components by using the dose addition concept.

The best results were obtained using 1. 0 g of honey, 1. 0 g of silica-gel as dispersant sorbent and acetonitrile as eluting solvent. The method was validated by fortified honey samples at three concentration levels (0. 2, 0. 5 to 1. 0 mg kg- 1). Average recoveries (n= 7) ranged from 54 to 84 %, with relative standard deviations between 3. 7 and 8. 5 %. Detection and quantification limits attained by the developed method ranged from 0. 02 to 0. 08 mg kg- 1 and 0. 07 to 0. 25 mg kg- 1 for the honey, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Eleven fungicides, benomyl, bitertanol, captan, carbendazim, mancozeb, <b>procymidone,</b> propiconazole, tebuconazole, thiram. {{triadimenol}} and tridemorph, {{were tested}} in vitro at 50 and 10 mg a. i. /L for their effects on the macroconidial germination of Claviceps africana, the sorghum ergot pathogen. Thiram and captan completely inhibited conidial germination of the two isolates (UQE 1 and UQE 2) tested. Nine of the best fungicides from this test were selected for assessment as seed treatments using sorghum seed which had been artificially coated with ergot honeydew containing macroconidia of the isolates UQE 1 or UQE 9. Captan and thiram at 0. 5, 1 and 2 g a. i. /kg seed completely inhibited macroconidium germination of-one isolate and reduced germination of the other t...|$|E
40|$|Trichoderma harzianum C 52 is an {{effective}} biocontrol agent of the onion white rot pathogen Sclerotium cepivorum. For this biocontrol agent to be integrated into an existing disease management programme, it must be compatible with the fungicides commonly used on onions. The sensitivity of T. harzianum spores to the field rate of eight fungicides commonly applied to onions was determined in an in vitro assay. Results indicate that T. harzianum was least sensitive to <b>procymidone</b> and captan and most sensitive to mancozeb, tebuconazole and thiram. A glasshouse pot trial confirmed that T. harzianum was sensitive to mancozeb but tolerant of captan. This research indicates that in furrow applications of T. harzianum would be compatible with a captan and/or benomyl seed treatment for control of other seedling diseases...|$|E
40|$|The {{reduction}} {{mechanism of}} vinclozoline, 3 -(3, 5 -dichlorophenyl) - 5 -methyl- 5 -vinyl- 1, 3 -oxazolidine- 2, 4 -dione, iprodione, 3 -(3, 5 - dichlorophenyl) -N-(1 -methylethyl) - 2, 4 -dioxo- 1 -imidazolidinecarboxamide, and <b>procymidone,</b> 3 -(3, 5 -dichlorophenyl) - 1, 5 -dimethyl- 3 -azabicyclo[3. 1. 0]hexane- 2, 4 -dione, was studied in acetonitrile by electrochemical methods combined with GC:MS identification of products. Irreversible reduction {{was observed at}} about 2. 2 V. The electron transfer reaction was coupled with subsequent chemical reactions yielding several final products. The main decomposition pathways included {{the elimination of the}} hetero-ring (producing chloroanilines and most likely diketones) and the cleavage of one or both chlorine atoms. Vinclozoline also yielded compounds that derive from the reductive elimination of the OCO fragment (carbon dioxide) from the heterocyclic ring...|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to evaluate the efficiency of fungicides for pea seed treatment against damping-off caused by Rhizoctonia solani and to verify their effects on physiological seed quality. 'Mikado' pea seeds were treated with the following fungicides: Carbendazim, Carbendazim + Thiram, Captan, Iprodione, Iprodione + Thiram, Metalaxyl-M + Fludioxonil, Pencycuron, <b>Procymidone</b> and Tolyfluanid. Control seeds were treated with deionized water. Physiological seed quality was evaluated with the following tests: germination, first count, accelerated aging and electrical conductivity. Seeds were sown in soil inoculated and no inoculated with R. solani. The experimental design was completely random with four replications. Seedling emergence was reduced in inoculated soil and the best treatments for R. solani control were Carbendazim, Pencycuron, Iprodione and Carbendazim + Thiram. Captan reduced seed physiological quality in both the laboratory and field...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the ability of}} a mixture of three androgen receptor antagonists to induce disruption of male sexual differ-entiation after perinatal exposure. The aim was to assess whether the joint effects of vinclozolin, flutamide, and <b>procymidone</b> can be predicted based on dose-response data of the individual chemicals. Chemicals were administered orally to pregnant Wistar rats from gestational day 7 to postnatal day 16. Changes in reproductive organ weights and of androgen-regulated gene expression in prostates from male rat pups were chosen as end points for extensive dose-response studies. With all end points, the joint effects of the three antiandrogens were dose additive. Histological evaluations showed that dysgenesis and hypoplasia of prostates, seminal vesicles, and epididymis were seen with the highest mixture doses. No changes were observed in any single-compound low-dose group for these lesions, nor were there histopathologica...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a {{cumulative}} risk assessment of three anti-androgenic pesticides (vinclozolin, <b>procymidone</b> and prochloraz) using the relative potency factor (RPF) approach and an integrated probabilistic risk assessment (IPRA) model. RPFs for each substance were estimated for three reproductive endpoints (ano-genital distance, and weights of the seminal vesicles and the musculus levator ani/bulbocavernosus) in male rat foetuses exposed in utero. The cumulative dietary intake was estimated based on consumption data and residue data from the Netherlands. The IPRA model combines variability in both exposure and sensitivity between individuals into a distribution of individual margins of exposures (IMoEs) and IMoEs of 1 or less indicate a possible concern. The assessment {{did not result in}} IMoEs <or = 1. The endpoint 'weight of seminal vesicles' resulted in the lowest IMoEs (0. 1 th percentile: 198) and the fraction of individuals with IMoE...|$|E
