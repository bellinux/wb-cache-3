5000|$|The {{relationship}} between childhood and adolescent delinquency and role taking is considerable. Burack found that maltreated {{children and adolescents}} with behavioural problems exhibited egocentrism at higher levels than non-maltreated children and adolescents who had progressed faster and more expectedly in their role taking development. [...] Chandler found that chronically delinquent boys exhibited lower role taking abilities {{so much so that}} their role taking ability was comparable to the role taking ability scores of non-delinquent children nearly half their age. [...] In turn, one-third of the delinquent boys in this study were assigned to a treatment program designed to improve role taking skills. [...] <b>Post-treatment</b> <b>measures</b> demonstrated that the program successfully induced role taking ability progress in this group, and an 18-month follow-up assessment found a nearly 50% decrease in delinquent behaviours following these progresses in role taking skills. [...] The same has been found for delinquent girls. Chalmers and Townsend trained delinquent girls, ages 10-16, on role taking skills over 15 sessions, following which the girls demonstrated improved understanding of interpersonal situations and problems, greater empathy, more acceptance of individual differences, and exhibited more prosociality in the classroom. [...] The overall picture, then, is that role taking training can help delinquent youth and youth with conduct disorders [...] as they lag behind in role taking ability.|$|E
40|$|Objective To {{describe}} {{the development and}} test the efficacy of a cognitive-behavioral intervention (CBT) for juvenile fibromyalgia. Method Sixty-seven children with fibromyalgia and their parents were recruited {{to participate in an}} 8 -week intervention that included modules of pain management, psychoeducation, sleep hygiene, and activities of daily living. Children were taught techniques of cognitive restructuring, thought stopping, distraction, relaxation, and self-reward. Additionally, they kept daily pain and sleep dairies. Children completed questionnaires of pre- and <b>post-treatment</b> <b>measuring</b> physical status and psychological functioning. Results Following CBT, children reported significant reductions (p <. 006) in pain, somatic symptoms, anxiety, and fatigue, as well as improvements in sleep quality. Additionally, children reported improved functional ability and had fewer school absences.

40|$|This {{meta-analysis}} aims {{to inform}} clinical practice of treatment strategies for adolescents with {{major depressive disorder}} (MDD). The efficacy of three empirically validated treatments was compared to determine the most effective treatment. These were: cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) pharmacotherapy, and combination CBT and SSRI therapy. Inclusion criteria required studies to report a reliable and valid pre- and <b>post-treatment</b> <b>measure</b> and adequate data for Hedge&# 039;s g effect size to be calculated. Forty-nine studies meeting the above inclusion criteria were found and included in the analysis. Although all three treatment strategies {{were found to be}} effective, analysis revealed no significant difference in treatment outcome among CBT, SSRI, and combination therapy. An investigation of moderator variables revealed months to follow-up to significantly influence the relationship between treatment type and treatment outcome. Given that CBT has no side effects, is more cost effective, and is equally as effective as SSRI therapy and combination therapy, the current study makes a strong case for CBT as a first-line treatment strategy for adolescents with MDD...|$|R

40|$|A week-long {{intervention}} for five school-age children who stutter was implemented using techniques of fluency shaping, stuttering management, and mindfulness training. The {{purpose of this}} study was to investigate if children who stutter stuttered less frequently, stuttered with less struggle, and demonstrated changes in mindfulness measures after the completion of this week-long intervention. Pre- to <b>post-treatment</b> <b>measures</b> were analyzed by individual and group-level results. A comparative analysis between reading and narrative tasks was also performed. Findings indicate that three out of five children reduced the total number of disfluencies during the reading task, and two children reduced this total during the narrative task. Four out of five children decreased the level of struggle in both tasks. Two children improved their overall mindfulness scores; however, additional changes in sub-divisions of mindfulness varied by participant. As a group, the total number of disfluencies decreased during the reading task, while the total number of disfluencies did not change from pre- to <b>post-treatment</b> <b>measures</b> during the narrative task. The group demonstrated improvements in mindfulness in the areas of communication attitudes, cognitive reappraisal, and expressive suppression. A comparison between reading and narrative tasks suggest that performance on these tasks approximated to one another by the end of the treatment. The results of this study should be interpreted with caution as this was a pilot study with clinical limitations; however, future studies are necessary to verify and support these findings...|$|E

Design: A quantitative service evaluation with a retrospective, before and after study design. Participants: A total of 268 participants, taking part in the Lothian Primary Lymphoedema Service having experienced at least one episode of cellulitis. Intervention: Normal individualised treatment for lymphoedema including advice, education, exercises, manual therapy, compression therapy, psychosocial support, diet advice or and referral to weight management. Outcome measures: Limb Volume Pre- and <b>Post-Treatment,</b> <b>measured</b> using the tape measure method. Results: The 90 participants without a cancer diagnosis had a significantly higher pre-treatment limb volume (10195. 06 ml (SD 4623. 599) than the 42 participants with a previous cancer diagnosis (7922. 18 ml (SD 5282. 502) (95 % CI 483. 115 to 4062. 465). The groups did not differ significantly in their response to treatment. Participants with primary lymphoedema correlate negatively with a medium strength relationship for change in limb volume (Rp-bs= -. 297) (95 % CI - 496 to 109). No other diagnosis had a statistically significant correlation with change in limb volume following treatment. Conclusion: Patient diagnosis and history of cancer affects their final outcome from the service. All secondary diagnoses correlate positively, if not significantly, with change in limb volume. Both cancer and non-cancer groups respond equally well to treatment. Patients with a cancer history have a significantly lower limb volume both entering the service and following treatment. Further longitudinal studies are required to investigate the effect diagnosis and early access to treatment have on patient outcome...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Numerous reports {{advocate}} {{that training}} of the proprioceptive sense is a viable behavioral therapy for improving impaired motor function. However, there is little agreement of what constitutes proprioceptive training and how effective it is. We therefore conducted a comprehensive, systematic review of the available literature {{in order to provide}} clarity to the notion of training the proprioceptive system. Methods: Four major scientific databases were searched. The following criteria were subsequently applied: 1) A quantified pre and <b>post-treatment</b> <b>measure</b> of proprioceptive function. 2) An intervention or training program believed to influence or enhance proprioceptive function. 3) Contained at least one form of treatment or outcome measure that is indicative of somatosensory function. From a total of 1284 articles, 51 studies fulfilled all criteria and were selected for further review. Results: Overall, proprioceptive training resulted in an average improvement of 52 % across all outcome measures. Applying muscle vibration above 30 Hz for longer durations (i. e., min vs. sec) induced outcome improvements of up to 60 %. Joint position and target reaching training consistently enhanced joint position sense (up to 109 %) showing an average improvement of 48 %. Cortical stroke was the most studied disease entity but no clear evidence indicated that proprioceptive training is differentially beneficial across the reported diseases. Conclusions: There is converging evidence that proprioceptive training can yield meaningful improvements in somatosensory and sensorimotor function. However, there is a clear need for further work. Those forms of training utilizing both passive and active movements with and without visual feedback tended to be most beneficial. There is also initial evidence suggesting that proprioceptive training induces cortical reorganization, reinforcing the notion that proprioceptive training is a viable method for improving sensorimotor function...|$|R

40|$|While {{student populations}} are growing, the {{gatekeeping}} devices of teacher certification examinations prevent many who want and {{are trained to}} teach from entering the profession. If failing these exams predicted failure to teach well, blocking {{students who do not}} pass certification exams from entering the profession might be a well-reasoned policy. However, many studies indicate that there is little correlation between certification test scores and quality of teaching. The present study investigated the effectiveness of a program to improve the scores of Texas elementary preservice teachers on a required certification exam. The program consisted of one-on-one coaching of preservice teachers upon the completion of coursework and prior to their taking the state's certification exam. Subjects' scores on a representative form of the certification test were used as pre-treatment measures. The content of the treatment program was individualized for each subject and determined by the specific items missed by each subject on the representative form. The <b>post-treatment</b> <b>measure</b> was the subject's score on the certification exam. Scores on the representative form and on the certification examination were compared to determine if there were significant differences between scores of preservice teachers who had been coached and those who were not coached. Since subjects voluntarily enrolled in the treatment, initial differences between coached and uncoached groups were controlled through analysis of covariance and pairwise matching. Descriptive statistics, t-tests for dependent samples, repeated measures analysis of variance, and univariate analyses of variance and covariance all indicated that there were statistically significant differences between the scores on the certification test of coached and uncoached students. Coached students showed greater improvement in scores than uncoached, with Hispanic subjects showing greater improvement than Caucasian subjects. Analyses that examined the differences between the coached and uncoached subjects on the domain and competency scores that make up the raw scores failed to indicate the sources of the differences in raw scores...|$|R

First, the intent was to test a {{conversational}} management treatment intervention that could improve the behaviors of juvenile females in a correctional facility. Second, it was designed to help researchers in the area of pragmatics develop an understanding of conceptual issues drawn from the social skills literature. ^ The conversational management treatment intervention (Face-to-Face program) was applied to an experimental group of females residing in a youth correctional facility with the hypothesis that improved social skills and decreased rule violations would occur when the experimental group 2 ̆ 7 s <b>post-treatment</b> <b>measures</b> were contrasted with those of a control group and a non-weighted control group. ^ Each group 2 ̆ 7 s <b>post-treatment</b> <b>measures</b> were evaluated using a MANOVA of main effects to determine if there were significant differences across group means. The Tukey-HSD post hoc test was used to compare group means. ^ Results of the Tukey HSD tests showed no significant effects for the experimental group that received treatment when compared with the non-weighted control group and control group on the post-treatment Major Behavior Infraction Reports (MBIR). However, on the post-treatment Minor Infraction Report (MIR), there was a significant difference between the experimental group and non-weighted control group, but there was no significant difference between the experimental and control group. Additionally, on the post-treatment SSRS Social Skills quotient, there was a significant difference between the experimental group and the non-weighted control group. However, there was no significant difference between the experimental group and the control group. ^ Although there was a significant difference between the experimental group and non-weighted control group on the MIR and Social Skills quotient (SSQ), these results are inconclusive. Methodological factors beyond the control of the study may have influenced the performance of the non-weighted control group. ^ Implications for pragmatic conversational management interventions and additional areas for future research are discussed along with the integration of conceptual issues drawn from the social skills literature. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In {{the current}} article, we address the {{existing}} assumption {{in the literature}} on cognitive behavioral treatment of PTSD that patients with severe negative trauma-related cognitions would benefit more from a treatment package that includes exposure and cognitive techniques compared with a treatment that includes exposure only.

Primary hypotheses that the abused group would statistically differ from the non-abused group in terms of pre- and post-treatment levels of avoidance, dissociation, anger/aggression, self-destructiveness, social problems, and overall levels of PTSD symptoms, were not confirmed. Overall, group therapy participants experienced statistically significant decreases in PTSD symptoms over the course of therapy. Results are discussed in light of clinical implications, recommended cautions given the lack of a robust control group, and directions for future research...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{randomised}} controlled {{trial was}} conducted in an acute treatment setting to examine the effectiveness of compliance therapy, a brief pragmatic intervention targeting treatment adherence in psychotic disorders, based on motivational interviewing and recent cognitive approaches to psychosis. METHOD: Seventy-four patients with psychotic disorders according to DSM-III-R criteria recruited from consecutive admissions to an acute in-patient unit, received 4 - 6 sessions of either compliance therapy or non-specific counselling, and were followed-up over 18 months. The principal outcome measures were observer-rated compliance, attitudes to treatment, insight and social functioning. RESULTS: Significant advantages were found for the compliance therapy group <b>post-treatment</b> on <b>measures</b> of insight, attitudes to treatment and observer-rated compliance which were retained over the follow-up period. Global social functioning improved relatively more over time in the compliance therapy group compared with the control group. Survival in the community prior to readmission was significantly longer in the compliance therapy group. CONCLUSIONS: The results support the effectiveness of compliance therapy in improving functioning and community tenure after an acute psychotic episode...|$|R
5000|$|Virtual reality or VR {{technology}} {{is now being}} introduced to help treat patients with PTSD. Researchers began experimenting with VR in 1997 {{with the advent of}} the [...] "Virtual Vietnam" [...] scenario. Virtual Vietnam was used as a graduated exposure therapy treatment for Vietnam veterans meeting the qualification criteria for PTSD. A 50-year-old Caucasian male was the first veteran studied. The results concluded improvement <b>post-treatment</b> across all <b>measures</b> of PTSD and maintenance of the gains at the 6-month follow up. Subsequent open clinical trial of Virtual Vietnam using 16 veterans, showed a major reduction in PTSD symptoms. Positive results are being shown using VR for treating people suffering from PTSD after a traumatic event.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. [Purpose] Device based {{therapy for}} {{low back pain}} (LBP) {{involves}} quantitative assessment of muscle strength, resistance and lumbar motion and tailoring the rehabilitation protocol based on this objective assessment. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the effectiveness of device based therapy for LBP. [Subjects and Meth-ods] In this retrospective study, clinical data of 235 patients who underwent device-based physiotherapy for low back pain was reviewed. Pre and <b>post-treatment</b> outcome <b>measures</b> for pain (visual analogue scale or VAS score), disability (Oswestry disability index) and functional ability were compared to determine effectiveness of device-based physiotherapy at the end of 6 weeks of treatment. [Results] All outcome measures including VAS Score and mean Oswestry Disability Score showed significant improvement at the end of 6 weeks of device-based physical therapy. Before treatment, 73 % of patients had moderate to severe disability which reduced to 28 % after treatment. [Conclusion] Device-based therapy is effective in relieving pain, improving function and reducing disability in patients with low back pain in the short term. Device-based therapy may help to objectively evaluate the function of the spine and paraspinal muscles and help the therapist tailor treatment accordingly...|$|R
