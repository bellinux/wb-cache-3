40|$|The homoleptic {{compound}} [PPh 4][CF 3 AuCF 3] cleanly undergoes <b>photoinduced</b> <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition</b> of CF 3 I {{to afford}} the organogold(III) derivative [PPh 4][(CF 3) 3 AuI] in good yield and under mild conditions. This compound provides a convenient entry to the chemistry of the perfluorinated (CF 3) 3 Au fragment, the properties of which were analyzed {{with the aid of}} DFT methods and compared with those of the homologous non-fluorinated (CH 3) 3 Au moiety. It was found that reductive elimination of CX 3 −CX 3 in the former (X=F) requires a much higher energy barrier than in the latter (X=H) and is therefore considerably less favored. This can be considered as one of the main features underlying the significantly higher stability associated to the (CF 3) 3 Au fragment and its derivatives. This unsaturated, 14 -electron species can be stabilized by coordination of any of the halide ligands, including fluoride. In fact, the whole series of anionic [PPh 4][(CF 3) 3 AuX] complexes (X=F, Cl, Br, I, CN) has now been isolated and conveniently characterized. Evidence for intermolecular decomposition pathways upon thermolysis in the condensed phase is presented.

As {{soon as the}} nucleophiles possess a C=C or a C≡C bond capable of coordinating the Pd 0 complex active in the <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition,</b> they play a dual role since they interfere in the <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition</b> by a decelerating effect due to a partial coordination of the active Pd 0 complex. Indeed, its concentration decreases due {{to the formation of}} either unreactive com-plexes (η 2 -RCH=CH 2) Pd 0 L 2 (R = Ph, CO 2 Et, L = PPh 3; R = Bu 3 Sn, L = AsPh 3), (η 2 -RCH=CH 2) Pd 0 L 2 (OAc) – (R = Ph, L = PPh 3), (η 2 -R-C≡CH) Pd 0 L 2 (R = Ph, L = PPh 3) or more slowly reactive complexes (η 2 -R-C≡CH) Pd 0 L 2 (R = CO 2 Et, L = PPh 3), (η 2 -RCH=CH 2) Pd 0 L 2 (R = CO 2 Me, L 2 = dppf). Whenever the <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition</b> is faster than the ensuing carbopalladation or transmetallation, the decelerating effect of the nucleo-philes in the <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition</b> is in favor of a better efficiency for the catalytic cycle by bringing the rate of the fast <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition</b> closer to that of the slow carbopalladation or transmetallation steps...|$|R
