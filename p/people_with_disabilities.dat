The perceptions of indigenous <b>peoples</b> <b>with</b> <b>disabilities</b> are investigated, regarding their access to, and expectations of, health care. Their views are compared to those of health workers, senior bureaucrats and United Nations delegates. A qualitative approach {{was taken to the}} research presented in this thesis, framing the research methodology on indigenous enquiry. An exploratory case study approach was taken to compare three jurisdictions: Australia, Mexico and New Zealand. It presents the views of 50 participants including 18 indigenous persons <b>with</b> <b>disabilities,</b> 19 health workers, 10 decision makers and 6 United Nations Delegates. The findings suggest that the health needs of indigenous <b>peoples</b> <b>with</b> <b>disabilities</b> are largely underserved and misunderstood by health departments. Poverty, discrimination and disenfranchisement emerged as being the possible major determinants of the ill health experienced by indigenous <b>peoples</b> <b>with</b> <b>disabilities.</b> This thesis concludes that is necessary to build capacity and rights literacy across indigenous <b>peoples</b> <b>with</b> <b>disabilities,</b> particularly <b>with</b> respect to the CRPD; alongside with a legitimate redistribution of resources and decision-making in response to the expressed health needs of indigenous <b>peoples</b> <b>with</b> <b>disabilities...</b>|$|R
