5|$|A <b>powerful</b> <b>new</b> {{lighting}} system {{was installed in}} advance of the American Bicentennial in 1976. The statue was the focal point for Operation Sail, a regatta of tall ships {{from all over the world}} that entered New York Harbor on July 4, 1976, and sailed around Liberty Island. The day concluded with a spectacular display of fireworks near the statue.|$|E
5|$|At the Potsdam Conference, {{which started}} in late July after Germany's surrender, serious {{differences}} emerged over the future development of Germany {{and the rest of}} Central and Eastern Europe. Moreover, the participants' mounting antipathy and bellicose language served to confirm their suspicions about each other's hostile intentions and entrench their positions. At this conference Truman informed Stalin that the United States possessed a <b>powerful</b> <b>new</b> weapon.|$|E
5|$|In {{dealing with}} Stalin, Truman {{decided to give}} the Soviet leader vague hints about the {{existence}} of a <b>powerful</b> <b>new</b> weapon without going into details. However, the other Allies were unaware that Soviet intelligence had penetrated the Manhattan Project in its early stages, so Stalin already knew of the existence of the atomic bomb but did not appear impressed by its potential.|$|E
50|$|As time progressed, more <b>powerful,</b> <b>newer</b> {{locomotives}} progressively displaced the T class, {{with the}} four South Island-based {{members of the class}} (103-106) known to have been relegated to the quiet, lowly trafficked Tokarahi Branch. A number of the class were modified for use as yard shunters. This involved the fitting of a tender cab and moving the tender body back on the frame to provide more room for the fireman.|$|R

5|$|White Northern Republicans, {{and some}} Democrats, became excited about an {{abolition}} amendment, holding meetings and issuing resolutions. Many blacks, {{particularly in the}} South, focused more on landownership and education {{as the key to}} liberation. As slavery began to seem politically untenable, an array of Northern Democrats successively announced their support for the amendment, including Representative James Brooks, Senator Reverdy Johnson, and Tammany Hall, a <b>powerful</b> <b>New</b> York political machine.|$|E
5|$|Aldona (baptized as Ona or Anna; her pagan name {{is known}} {{only from the}} {{writings}} of the 16th century chronicler Maciej Stryjkowski) married Casimir III of Poland, son of Władysław I of Poland, when he was 15 or 16 years old. The marriage took place on either 30 April or 16 October 1325, and was a purely political maneuver to strengthen the Polish–Lithuanian coalition against the Teutonic Knights (an alliance foreshadowing the Union of Krewo in 1385 and the Union of Lublin in 1569, with the latter resulting in a stable and <b>powerful</b> <b>new</b> state, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth). This preliminary coalition was short-lived, collapsing in about 1330, but {{there is no evidence of}} military conflict between Poland and Lithuania while Aldona was alive.|$|E
5|$|On 11 August 1521, Belehe Qat and Cahi Imox {{were chosen}} as lords {{of the city}} after the deaths of Hun-Iq' and Lahuh-Noh, the {{previous}} kings. Cahi Imox was the Ahpo Sotz'il and Belehe Qat was the Ahpo Xahil. On {{the eve of the}} Spanish Conquest, the Kaqchikel kingdom based at Iximche was still expanding into areas formerly controlled by the K'iche' and it was rapidly becoming the most <b>powerful</b> <b>new</b> kingdom in the Guatemalan Highlands. It was second in importance only to the K'iche' capital at Q'umarkaj.|$|E

5|$|Two {{years later}} Phips was {{appointed}} as governor. He had successfully straddled a middle political position, cultivating a strong {{connection to the}} <b>powerful</b> <b>New</b> England minister, Increase Mather, {{as well as his}} royalist opposition on the Board of Trade. Phips and Mather returned to the Massachusetts Bay Colony from England {{at the height of the}} witchcraft delusion, after numerous executions in Salem. Phips suspended the court proceedings, pardoned several people sentenced to death, and released more than 100 being held in jail before trial. He became enmeshed in related controversies that resulted in his recall to England to answer a variety of charges. Phips died in London at the age of 44 before the charges against him could be heard.|$|E
5|$|The 1904 Democratic National Convention {{was held}} in July in St. Louis, Missouri, then also hosting the 1904 World's Fair and the 1904 Summer Olympics. Parker's mentor David B. Hill—having {{attempted}} and failed to capture the nomination himself at the 1892 convention—now led the campaign for his protege's nomination. William Jennings Bryan, who had been nominated but defeated by William McKinley in both 1896 and 1900, was no longer considered by delegates {{to be a viable}} alternative. Radicals in the party supported publisher William Randolph Hearst but lacked sufficient numbers to secure the nomination due to opposition from Bryan and Tammany Hall, a <b>powerful</b> <b>New</b> York political machine. Small clusters of delegates pledged support to other candidates, including Missouri Senator Francis Cockrell; Richard Olney, Grover Cleveland's Secretary of State; Edward C. Wall, a former Wisconsin State Representative; and George Gray, a former Senator from Delaware. Other delegates spoke of nominating Cleveland, who had already served two nonconsecutive terms, but Cleveland was no longer popular outside the party or even within it, due to his rift with Bryan.|$|E
5|$|Garfield's accomplishments as {{president}} included {{a resurgence of}} presidential authority against senatorial courtesy in executive appointments, energizing American naval power, and purging corruption in the Post Office, all during his extremely short time in office. Garfield made notable diplomatic and judiciary appointments, including a U.S. Supreme Court justice. He enhanced {{the powers of the}} presidency when he defied the <b>powerful</b> <b>New</b> York senator Roscoe Conkling by appointing William H. Robertson to the lucrative post of Collector of the Port of New York, starting a fracas that ended with Robertson's confirmation and Conkling's resignation from the Senate. Garfield advocated agricultural technology, an educated electorate, and civil rights for African Americans. He also proposed substantial civil service reform, eventually passed by Congress in 1883 and signed into law by his successor, Chester A. Arthur, as the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act. On July 2, 1881, he was shot at the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad Station in Washington D.C. by Charles J. Guiteau, a lawyer and writer with a grievance. The wound was not immediately fatal for Garfield, but his doctors' uncleaned and unprotected hands are said to have led to infection that caused his death on September 19. Guiteau was convicted of the murder and was executed in June 1882; he tried to name his crime as simple assault by blaming the doctors for Garfield's death. With his term cut short by his death after only 200 days, and much of it spent in ill health trying to recover from the attack, Garfield is little-remembered for other than his assassination. Historians often forgo listing him in rankings of U.S. presidents due to the short length of his presidency.|$|E
