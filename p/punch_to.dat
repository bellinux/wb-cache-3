5|$|Trinidad was {{subsequently}} scheduled {{to fight against}} Hacine Cherifi in a contest that he won by technical knockout in the fourth round. The event {{was part of a}} card that took place on May 11, 2002, and was organized in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Early in the first round Trinidad's strategy consisted of using his jab while Cherifi did not try to directly engage in the offensive. In the last minute of the round a punch by Trinidad hit Cherifi's chin leaving him disoriented, he followed this with a combination and scored a knockdown. In the second round, Trinidad displayed more boxing and was on the offensive by using combinations to the head and ribs. In the third Cherifi landed more punches than in the previous two, but Trinidad relied on throwing left jabs. One of his punches hit Cherifi's liver, followed by a <b>punch</b> <b>to</b> the jaw, making Cherifi fall to the floor. In the fourth, a series of combinations injured Cherifi, who collapsed to the floor twice, forfeiting the fight on the second occasion. Following this contest Trinidad announced his retirement, at the moment leaving the sport with a record of 41wins, one defeat, and 34wins by knockout.|$|E

25|$|The boxer or out-fighter {{tends to}} be most {{successful}} against a brawler, whose slow speed (both hand and foot) and poor technique makes him an easy target to hit for the faster out-fighter. The out-fighter's main concern is to stay alert, as the brawler only needs to land one good <b>punch</b> <b>to</b> finish the fight. If the out-fighter can avoid those power punches, he can often wear the brawler down with fast jabs, tiring him out. If he is successful enough, he may even apply extra pressure in the later rounds {{in an attempt to}} achieve a knockout. Most classic boxers, such as Muhammad Ali, enjoyed their best successes against sluggers.|$|E

25|$|Liddell was {{scheduled}} to defend his new title against longtime veteran Jeremy Horn, at UFC 54, a matchup the UFC claimed was demanded by long-time fans of the sport since Horn had given Liddell his first loss. Throughout the bout, Liddell dominated with aggressive punches, causing knockdowns in several rounds. Liddell's defensive wrestling ability, especially his sprawl, stifled the bulk of Horn's offense, which was centered on grappling and submission wrestling. Liddell eventually won the fight via TKO in 2:46 minutes of the fourth round after Horn informed the referee {{that he could not}} see. He had been hit with a right <b>punch</b> <b>to</b> the eye causing him to bleed from his eye as well as his nose. Liddell had successfully defended his title and, in the process, avenged two of his three career losses.|$|E

25|$|From {{the opening}} bell Liston {{attempted}} to close with Ali, looking {{to land a}} hard <b>punch</b> <b>to</b> the head to end the fight quickly and decisively. Though Ali often carried his gloves down at his waist, seemingly open to attack, he proved very difficult to hit. With Ali quickly ducking his head left, right or away, Liston's leading left jabs largely failed to land. As Liston pursued his target Ali retreated away, using his foot speed to slip away into open space in the ring, largely circling {{to the left and}} away from the threat of a Liston left hook. Though the opening round saw Ali largely on the defensive, it was soon established that Ali could reverse roles quickly and take to the offensive with a remarkably fast series of combinations delivered to Liston's head. A sudden violent combination delivered with 30 seconds left in the round electrified the crowd. The opening round was fought an extra 20 seconds, as both fighters and referee Barney Felix apparently did not hear the bell.|$|E

500|$|The {{controls}} {{were designed to}} give more realistic movement to characters. Characters can dash, bob and weave in all eight directions. The punches are divided into left and right jabs/hooks. When punches are {{used in conjunction with}} [...] "technique" [...] and [...] "special" [...] buttons, extra types of punches can be executed. Combinations and counter-punches are also possible. By combining upper body movements with punches, players can duck down and hit to the body or lean back and throw a quick <b>punch</b> <b>to</b> the head. The initial setup uses the left analog stick for all the character's bodily movements; minor movements to the stick control the upper body movements, while larger movements control the lower body and movement within the ring.|$|E
