5|$|A solitary male <b>purple-throated</b> <b>cotinga</b> {{attracts a}} female by {{perching}} above the canopy {{and letting the}} sun highlight its iridescent plumage.

5|$|While it is {{structurally}} {{similar to}} the Cotinga species, the <b>purple-throated</b> <b>cotinga</b> differs from them in {{that it has a}} heavier, stubbier bill, distinctive pale fringing on the back feathers, and barred underparts in the female. While it is still generally considered to be closely related to the Cotinga species, recent molecular analysis has suggested that the species may in fact form a separate clade with other canopy-dwelling cotingas, specifically the neotropical bellbirds of the genus Procnias, the cotingas of the genus Carpodectes, the black-faced cotinga of the monotypic genus Conioptilon, and the bare-necked fruitcrow of the monotypic genus Gymnoderus. Of these genera, the molecular analysis suggested that the <b>purple-throated</b> <b>cotinga</b> was most closely related to the neotropical bellbirds. This cotinga does not have a recognized subspecies.|$|E
5|$|The <b>purple-throated</b> <b>cotinga</b> (Porphyrolaema porphyrolaema) is {{a species}} of bird in the cotinga family, Cotingidae. It {{is found in the}} western Amazon {{rainforest}} of South America; its range extends from southern Colombia south through eastern Ecuador and Peru and east through extreme northwestern Bolivia and into western Amazonian Brazil. It lives in the canopy or along the borders of humid forest throughout its range. The <b>purple-throated</b> <b>cotinga</b> is monotypic within the genus Porphyrolaema and has no known subspecies. It is one of the smaller cotinga species and expresses strong sexual dimorphism. Males have black upperparts with a bold white wingstripe and white edges to the tertial feathers and a white belly with some black barring on the rear flanks. The throat is a deep purple, giving the bird both its common and scientific names. Females are dark brown with pale buffy margins on the upperparts, buffy cinnamon with black barring on the underparts, and rufous on the throat. The male has a powerful voice.|$|E

5|$|The <b>purple-throated</b> <b>cotinga</b> is {{not well}} known {{and appears to be}} {{naturally}} uncommon or rare across a widespread area; however, it is almost certainly under-reported due to its canopy lifestyle. The IUCN considers this species to be a species of Least Concern due in part to its large range. While the IUCN has not estimated the population size, it believes it is declining due to habitat loss.|$|E
5|$|The <b>purple-throated</b> <b>cotinga</b> feeds {{primarily}} on the fruits of forest trees, most notably those belonging to the genus Cecropia. It also occasionally consumes small invertebrates, such as insects. All reported observations of the species feeding involve the cotinga leaning down from its perch to pluck fruit off a tree in the forest canopy. These birds are distinct from similar species {{in that they are}} often seen in pairs. This species perches in the canopy to take in the morning sun.|$|E
5|$|The <b>purple-throated</b> <b>cotinga</b> is {{strongly}} sexually dimorphic as {{male and female}} purple-throated cotingas have few similarities in their plumage. The male has black upperparts, including the head, wings, and tail. The feathers on the bird's back to its uppertail coverts, {{as well as its}} upperwing coverts, have white fringes. There is also a conspicuous white wingstripe and white edges to the tertial feathers. Additionally the male has a deeply purple throat and a white belly, with some black barring on its rear flanks.|$|E
