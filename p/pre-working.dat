50|$|During {{the late}} 18th century and early 19th century, there was {{considerable}} social upheaval as a largely agrarian society was transformed by technological advances and increasing mechanization, which was the Industrial Revolution. Much of the agricultural workforce was uprooted from the countryside and moved into large urban centres of production, as the steam-based production factories could undercut the traditional cottage industries, because of economies of scale and the increased output per worker {{made possible by the}} new technologies. The consequent overcrowding into areas with little supporting infrastructure saw dramatic increases in the rate of infant mortality (to the extent that many Sunday schools for <b>pre-working</b> age children (5 or 6) had funeral clubs to pay for each other's funeral arrangements), crime, and social deprivation.|$|E
40|$|Muscle {{hardness}} measurements in a squeezing {{dynamometer test}} are interpreted for expressions of adjustment {{effects of the}} central nervous system in rapid response to a starting signal. It is shown that preliminary muscle tension leads to the transmission of inhibiting proprioceptive impulses to the nervous system centers and that the degree of <b>pre-working</b> changes depends on the individual's typological personality characteristics. Concentration of attention during the <b>pre-working</b> adjustment is considered the primary emotional factor that controls sensorimotor performance...|$|E
40|$|Our paper seeks {{answers to}} the {{following}} questions: What are the determinants of permanent emigration from Poland and how do they vary for specific economic age groups (<b>pre-working,</b> working, and post-working age) ? Do the causes of permanent emigration differ over space in these categories, and if so, how? We applied GIS and ESDA instruments, including geographically weighted regression, which allowed us to identify the variability of regression coefficients in the geographical space. Our research indicated socio-economic factors (among others: poviats budget income, feminisation rate, unemployment rate), which, with varying force and in varying directions, affected the studied variable in specific parts of the country. The analyses were performed on the basis of statistical data on the numbers of de-registrations for residence abroad in Poland’s NUTS- 4 in three economic age groups (<b>pre-working,</b> working, and post-working age) for the time span from 2005 to 2013...|$|E
40|$|PAVE is {{a project}} for the {{development}} of a prototype of a helicopter pilot assistant system in which numerous experts in different areas are involved. The pallet extends from flight control, acoustics, aerial photograph processing, and human factors up to data processing and structure of hardware and integration. 4 institutes of the DLR and the French research establishment ONERA are involved in this project. A substantial part of the development and <b>pre-working</b> was accomplished, so that the system can now be tested and improved with the help of pilots. First flight tests take place in 2006 on the FHS in the environment of Braunschweig.

40|$|We {{analyzed}} {{the effects of}} working activity and working shifts on the circadian rhythmicity and circadian phase relations of serum cortisol level, white blood cell count, resting heart rate and systolic/diastolic blood pressure {{in a group of}} Italian fishermen. We observed a shift-induced displacement of cortisol secretion and a change in leukocyte count. Moreover, systolic/diastolic blood pressure and resting heart rate were markedly influenced by the night shift, whereas no appreciable changes were observed after the morning and afternoon shifts, compared to <b>pre-working</b> values. These data suggest that the human circadian system is greatly influenced by shift work, and that serum cortisol level, leukocyte count, systolic and diastolic blood pressure as well as resting heart rate are sensitive indicators of the biological responses to a stress workload in shift workers, especially after a night shift...|$|E
40|$|In {{this article}} we discuss and analyse changes in the sex-age {{structure}} of both the urban and the rural population of the Republic of Kazakhstan since independence (1991) and until 2013. Spatial analysis by age and sex was carried out for the urban and rural population of the Republic of Kazakhstan. The article focuses on the population of Astana and Almaty as cities of “republican subordination”. The aim {{of this article is}} to study and analyse the sex-age structure of the total population taking the urban and rural population from 1991 to 2013 separately. For comparison and analysis of statistical data in the dynamics, the data by sex and age of the urban and rural population for 1991, 2001 and 2011 were examined. Thus changes over 10 years are considered. The age groups for which the data were collected were based on differentiation of the population by economic status: <b>pre-working</b> (0 - 14 years), working (15 - 64), and post-working age (over 65 years) ...|$|E
40|$|We {{discuss the}} {{question}} of the relationship of man’s place in the social system and his perception of social reality. Awareness of the place in the system of social relations implies acceptance of its norms and values, which provides a systematic perception of social reality and the ability to plan the future. If the inclusion into the system of social relations is limited, this leads to difficulty of the world systematization and future plans making. We present the study of the perceptual image of the future profession as part of the social reality of the students and schoolchildren. Both the first and second are on <b>pre-working</b> stage of socialization, but with similar nature of the interaction with the social reality, students and schoolchildren have different status, and therefore different positions in the system of social relations. We found that students are increasingly incorporated into the social system, and it affects their positive perception of social realit...|$|E
40|$|The age {{structure}} of societies living in EU member slates is changing significantly: {{the share of}} persons at retirement age in {{the total number of}} population is steadily growing, whereas the proportion of the <b>pre-working</b> age population is decreasing. This type of demographic processes influences the labour market, particularly its future condition. Some member states are anticipated to suffer from the labour force shortage, aggravated by the ageing of the economically active population. Another important consequence of the increasingly grow ing proportion of population at retirement age in its total number is macro-social problems with financing their old age pensions. This calls for stimulating economic activity in the older age groups - a difficult challenge faced by the social policies in the member states.

40|$|ABSTRACT Background : One of the {{negative}} impacts from the iron work industry is heat in working environment. The heat stress in the working environment gives the workers additional burden and may result an adverse health effect, especially the metabolism of  their body.   Consequently, it may couse fatigue that causes the decrease of their working productivity. The fatigue may be clearly observed {{on the basis of}} the measurement of reaction time of light stimuli. The study aims for determining factors related to reaction time of light stimuli of the employees exposed to heat in PT. Baja Kurnia Ceper, Klaten. Method : The study used  cross sectional approach. The samples of the study were 43 workers. It was conducted on January – May 2005. Data was collected using measurement of ambient temperature in the production room, measurement of the fatigue with the reaction time of light stimuli, counting of arterial pulse, measurement of body weihgt/high and interview with respondent. Data was analyzed by using Pearson Product Moment Corelation, Independent t-Test and Multiple Linier Regression Result : Result of the study indicated that ambient temperature was 30, 640 C, age was 34, 35 on average, nutritional status 19, 89 on average, working periode was 8, 23 on average, the <b>pre-working</b> of reaction time of light stimuli was 352, 46 mmdet on average, and the post-working of reaction time of light stimuli was 500, 78 mmdet on average, while 27 employees were in the condition of helath dan 16 employees were in the condition of not helath. Conclusion : There was a significant correlation between ambient temperature, age, nutritional status,  working periode, working burden and reaction time of light stimuli. There was not  any defference in reaction time of light stimuli in the group pf health respondents andthat of not health respondents. Key words : temperature, nutrional status, working burden, light stimul...|$|E
40|$|Published in: Society and Space in Contemporary Poland in Łódź University Geographical Research, {{edited by}} T. MarszałAt {{the turn of}} the century, Poland {{witnessed}} an important change in the distribution of the population, i. e. concentration of the population in metropolitan areas, movements from central cities to surrounding areas (suburbs) and depopulation of peripheral areas. Within the analysed period, there has been a significant outflow of the Polish population abroad, particularly from {{the eastern part of the}} country and from Opolskie region. Additionally, low total fertility rate influenced low natural increase, except suburbs where a rise in the natural increase rate was recorded. The changes to migration intensity and directions and of the diversification of natural increase along with passing through the population pyramid consecutive generations of baby boomers and people born in demographic lows result in more rapid ageing of areas which until recently were considered as demographically young (i. e. northern and western Poland) and urban areas. In the coming decades, the on-going demographic processes will result in even greater spatial polarisation between metropolitan and peripheral areas. If continued, the depopulation tendency resulting from low natural increase caused by low fertility and increasingly delayed time of establishing a family as well as emigration of young people will lead to further deepening of demographic ageing as a result of a drop in the percentage of <b>pre-working</b> age population, diminished work resources and increased share of re tired people. Therefore, it is important to undertake certain population policy actions to strengthen the elements of pro-family policy, develop social policy targeted at older people and initiatives aimed at increasing economic activity particularly of people age 50 + (Sytuacja demograficzna Polski 2012). The main assumptions of population policy-marking directions for initiatives aimed at achieving sustainable socio-economic development were developed by the Government Population Council and adopted during the 2 nd Demo graphic Congress in 2012 and their implementation will depend on the country’s economic situation...|$|E
