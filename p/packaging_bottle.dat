40|$|Injection {{moulding}} {{and blow}} moulding {{are probably the}} most widely used process for manufacturing parts by using plastic materials. A wide variety of products are manufactured by using these two technologies, which vary greatly in their size, complexity, and application. The injection moulding process requires the use of an injection moulding machine, raw plastic material and a mould. The process cycle for injection moulding consists of the following four stages: clamping, injection, cooling and ejection. Blow moulding is a manufacturing process that is used to create hollow plastic parts by inflating a heated plastic tube until it fills a mould and forms the desired shape. The manufacturing process is divided into three stages: injection, blowing and ejection. There are many types of materials that may be used in the injection moulding and blow moulding process. Most polymers may be used, including all thermoplastics, some thermosets, and some elastomers. Injection moulding industry is used to create many things such as milk cartons, <b>packaging,</b> <b>bottle</b> caps, automotive dashboards, pocket combs, and most other plastic products available today. Parts made from blow moulding are plastic, hollow, and thin-walled, such as bottles and containers that are available in a variety of shapes and sizes. These study is about the process, equipments, materials and applications involve injection moulding and blow moulding technology. At the same time it’s also discuss about the advantage and disadvantage of both manufacturing technology...|$|E
40|$|The rosé {{wine market}} has {{increased}} {{in the last decade}} at both domestic and international level. Following this trend, Italy has strongly increased its production which is mainly exported on international markets, i. e., the growth of international demand is greater than domestic one. Notwithstanding, rosé wines have attracted the attention of retailers while the supply has improved (Ismea, 2008). The success of rosé wines has been accomplished by a greater space devoted to rosé wines in supermarkets since retailers are looking for high turnover products such as rosé wines which may improve the profitability of sales. This paper presents preliminary results of a hedonic price analysis aimed to analyze factors affecting the mechanism of price fixing for rosé wines in Italian supermarkets. An hedonic price analysis (using the natural log of price as dependent variable) has been carried out on 929 records by assessing four different models (all, still, semi-sparkling and sparkling wines). Results confirm the significant effect of intrinsic and extrinsic cues. Retail prices are affected by the point of sale (big supermarkets vs. discount or small ones), certification of origin (denomination of origin vs. table wines), type of wine (still vs. sparkling), sugar content (brut vs. extra dry), alcohol content (with a maximum for medium level) <b>packaging</b> (<b>bottle</b> vs. bag in box; dark glass vs. light one), blend (blend wines vs. no blend ones), price promotion, shelf strategies (position on the shelf, stock facings). However, the price effect is small since most of rosé are basic and popular premium wines. A deeper investigation on still vs. sparkling rosé wines has shown a better price performance of sparkling ones...|$|E

40|$|Rosé wine {{represents}} about 8, 5 % of world wine production (Fregoni, 2010). Europe produces about 3 / 4 of world production, mostly concentrated in France (30 %), (21 %) and Spain (18 %); the Americas produces about the 23 % of world production, especially in United States (18 %). The rosé wine production {{has been driven}} by a strong increase in consumption in the last decade. Actually, the overall consumption of rosé wine is much lower than other wines; notwithstanding, this market segment has reported the strongest consumption increase rate at both Italian and international level. At the end of 2000 s, Italian sales of rosé wines grew by 6 % in value and 5 % in volume. An increase in quality of rosé wines has also been reported (Ismea, 2008) because denomination of origins have been also extended to rosè wines. A survey carried out on Veneto Region (Boatto and Galletto, 2011) has depicted the shape of rosé wine consumer showing that the knowledge is fairly good (about 50 % of people) often linked to some local or traditional sparkling rosé wines (eg. Rabosello, Lambrusco), the image of this wine is being young and appreciated by young people, the consumption is seasonal or occasional and mostly people drink rosé wine at home. The increasing in knowledge and, consequently, in consumption has been accomplished by a greater self space devoted to rosè wines by retailers. Actually, the consumption growth of rosè wines attracts retailers which are looking for products ensuring a better turnover, i. e., rosé wines are replacing matured red or white wines. Accordingly, strategies for rosè wines have been extended to a wide variety on intrinsic and extrinsic cues (quality, origin, bottle, label, etc.) producing a large price range. This paper presents results from a hedonic price analysis aimed to analyze factors affecting the mechanism of price fixing for rosé wines in Italian large retailers. A large literature using hedonic price functions to estimate the relationship between price and wine attributes generally supports the idea that the price is affected by characteristics that are available to consumers before purchasing (Nerlove 1995; Landon and Smith 1997; Combris et al. 2000; Oczkowski, 2001; Schamel and Anderson 2003; Lecocq and Visser, 2006; Couto and Rodrigues, 2007; Almenberg J. and Dreber A., 2011). So far, few studies have been focused on specific market segments such as rosé wines. Methodologically, a survey has been carried out on retailers by collecting data about point of sale features, wine quality (grape variety, blend, vintage, regional origin, types, sugar content, alcohol content) <b>packaging</b> (<b>bottle,</b> tap, glass, label and back label), price, brand, price promotion strategies and visual merchandising (display, facing). An hedonic price analysis (using the natural log of price as dependent variable) has been carried out on 935 records by assessing four different models (all, still, semi-sparkling and sparkling wines). A preliminary analysis on data has shown a wide variability of prices going from over 50 Euros of rosé Champagne, sold in wine shops, to 2 - 3 euros of table rosé, sold in discount, while correlation has allowed to focus attention on discriminating variables and to exclude not significant variables and outliers. Results shows that retail prices are affected by the point of sale (big supermarkets vs. discount or small ones), certification of origin (denomination of origin vs. table wines), type of wine (still vs. sparkling), sugar content (brut vs. extra dry), alcohol content (with a maximum for medium level) <b>packaging</b> (<b>bottle</b> vs. bag in box; dark glass vs. light one), blend (blend wines vs. no blend ones), price promotion, shelf strategies (position on the shelf, facing). However, the analysis do not show significant price effects between domestic and international wines while the brand effect cannot be recognize because of scarce observations, i. e., dispersion among many brands. Most of the previous variables show significant effects also in the sub-models. However, in the still rosé model we have found a relevant role also for the international origin...|$|E
40|$|Considerando a importância de Meloidogyne spp. na formação de mudas e o potencial do óleo e da torta de mostarda no controle desses nematóides, objetivou-se desenvolver uma tecnologia de aplicação desses produtos para o tratamento de substrato para a formação de mudas de cafeeiro, bem como determinar a vida de prateleira da torta. Para tal, estudaram-se formas de aplicação do óleo e da torta da mostarda, alcance dos gases, eficiência da formulação em óleo, tempo de biofumigação e armazenamento da torta em diferentes condições. Os gases tiveram alcance na {{horizontal}} e vertical ascendente até 30 cm de distância, onde proporcionaram 100 % de mortalidade dos nematóides. Na vertical descendente, o óleo foi eficiente até 20 cm, mas com a torta não se obteve controle satisfatório. As formas de aplicação do óleo resultaram em 100 % de controle de M. exigua, mas com a torta apenas com a aplicação em sulcos transversal e longitudinal chegouse ao mesmo resultado. Aumentar o tempo de fumigação para 10 dias ao invés de 5 permitiu reduzir a dose do óleo para 60 mL/m 3, com 100 % controle do nematóide. A influência do tipo de recipiente e condições de armazenamento na conservação da torta foi avaliada até os 14 meses. A conservação em embalagem impermeável (vidro) manteve-se constante tanto na concentração do ITCA quanto na mortalidade do J 2 por até 14 meses, independente da temperatura e luz. Em embalagem permeável (saco de papel), em temperatura ambiente, a conservação da mesma foi mantida por até 5 meses, mas quando armazenada em geladeira, a conservação foi mantida até os 14 meses. Conclui-se que a melhor forma de aplicação da torta é no formato de cruz, interceptada a cada 40 cm. O bastão de papel impregnado com óleo revelou-se um possível substituto para o brometo de metila no tratamento de substrato para produção de mudas de cafeeiro. É possível armazenar a torta de mostarda de um ano para outro desde que se utilize um recipiente hermeticamente fechado, ou, se mantenha em saco de papel fechado, na geladeira. Considering {{the importance}} of Meloidogyne spp. on the seedlings formation and {{the potential of the}} mustard cake and essential oil in the control of this nematode, it was proposed to develop an application technology of these products for the substrates treatment in order to get health coffee seedlings, as well as to determinate the shelf life of the mustard cake. Previously, it was evaluated the gas reaching on the substrate and then, different ways of applying oil and mustard cake. The gas reached 30 cm of distance horizontally and vertically down, that resulted in 100 % of nematode mortality. In case of essential oil, the gas movement upright was efficient until 20 cm, but no satisfactory control was observed with the cake. The oil application, independently of the distribution way, resulted in 100 % of M. exigua mortality, but the same result only was obtained by the cake application on transversal and longitudinal furrows. Also, the efficiency of the essential oil formulation, biofumigation time and the cake storage in different conditions were evaluated. Increasing the fumigation time to 10 instead of 5 days, allowed to reduce the oil doses to 60 mL/m 3, with 100 % of nematode control. The influence of the storage recipient type and cake storage conditions on the ITCA concentration was evaluated until 14 months. The preservation of the cake in impermeable <b>packaging</b> (<b>bottle)</b> guaranteed the ITCA concentration and J 2 mortality percentage until 14 months, independently the temperature and light. In permeable packaging (paper bag), at environment temperature, the conservation was maintained until 5 months, but when maintained on the fridge the conservation lasted 14 months. In conclusion, the best way of cake application is in the cross format, spaced every 40 cm. The impregnated paper stick with essential oil is a possible substitute to the methyl bromide in the infested substrate treatment on coffee nurseries. It is possible to store the mustard cake from one to another year if using a recipient hermetically closed, or by using paper bag on the fridge...|$|E
