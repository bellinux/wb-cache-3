Producer gas-fuelled systems based upon a relatively cheap and simple manually operated gasifier or reactor using readily available biomass feedstock can offer in some cases an attractive alternative to fossil-fuelled power units. This bulletin outlines research and development work by the Industrial Development Department of the Overseas Development Natural Resources Institute for 20 kW shaft power output from producer gas derived from solid biomass. Biomass materials such as wood or shells can be carbonized to form charcoal or left in their natural uncarbonized state. In this work both carbonized and uncarbonized biomass fuel {{has been used to}} provide producer gas to fuel a Ford 2274 E engine, an industrial version of a standard vehicle spark-ignition engine. Crossdraught and down-draught reactor designs were evaluated during trials with this engine. Also different gas cleaning and cooling arrangements were tested.

30|$|China’s {{geographical}} {{imbalance of}} electric load and energy resources {{results in the}} key characteristics of transmission from west to east and mutual support {{between north and south}} grids. After sustained reforms of power infrastructure and the power market, China has established an interconnected grid network of regional grid infrastructures, with provincial grids as the major operators in practice. As China’s greatest wind resources are in the north, far from load centres and the power grid framework, it will develop several large wind power bases, with capacities in the tens of gigawatts scale of wind base groups by 2050 developed in west Inner Mongolia and other regions [12]. Integration and accommodation of wind power in the power network have to face with many constraints, however, such as wind <b>power</b> <b>output,</b> <b>system</b> load, power source structure, regulation capability, power transmission scale and operation methods. These factors, which will continue to change, pose major challenges to the integration and accommodation of wind power. Seeing that China’s power system is mainly based on coal generation, there is little scope for system balance dispatching. Integration and accommodation of a large volume of wind power from northern wind bases will be a challenge due to insufficient peak adjustment capacity and limited transmission capabilities to handle the overabundance of wind power.|$|E
40|$|An {{essential}} component to hybrid electric and electric vehicles is energy storage. A power assist device {{could also be}} important to many vehicle applications. This discussion focuses {{on the use of}} compressed gas as a system for energy storage and power in vehicle systems. Three possible vehicular applications for which these system could be used are discussed in this paper. These applications are pneumatically driven vehicles, series hybrid electric vehicles, and power boost for electric and conventional vehicles. One option for a compressed gas system is as a long duration power output device for purely pneumatic and hybrid cars. This system must provide enough power and energy to drive under normal conditions for a specified time or distance. The energy storage system for this use has the requirement that it will be highly efficient, compact, and have low mass. Use of a compressed gas energy storage as a short duration, high <b>power</b> <b>output</b> <b>system</b> for conventional motor vehicles could reduce engine size or reduce transient emissions.

This resource is prevalent in the transportation and industrial process sectors, but stationary engine-generator systems also typically do not utilize this resource. Engine exhaust is considered high grade heat and can potentially be utilized by various approaches to produce electricity or to drive heating and cooling systems. This thesis describes {{a model system that}} employs thermoelectric conversion as a topping cycle integrated with an organic Rankine bottoming cycle for waste heat utilization. This approach is being developed to fully utilize the thermal energy contained in hot exhaust streams. This thesis investigates several system configurations each composed of a high temperature heat exchanger which extracts thermal energy for driving the thermoelectric conversion elements and a closely integrated bottoming cycle to capture the large amount of remaining thermal energy in the exhaust stream. The models differ by how they arrange specific heat exchangers in the system. Many interacting parameters that define combined system operation are employed in the models to determine overall system performance including output power, efficiency, and total energy utilization factors. In addition, the model identifies a maximum power operating point for the combined system. That is, the model can identify the optimal amount of heat to remove from the exhaust flow to drive the thermoelectric elements for maximizing the combined cycle output. The model has been developed such that the impact of heat exchanger UA[subscript h] values, thermal resistances, and the thermoelectric figure-of-merit (ZT) can be investigated in the context of system operation. The model also has the ability to simultaneously determine the effect of each cycle design parameter on the performance of the overall system, thus giving the ability to utilize as much waste heat as possible.

In order to achieve these targets, investment in renewable energy resources such as wind and solar energy is essential. Even though observation of solar irradiation show that the solar resource in the south-eastern parts of Norway is better than earlier believed, less focus {{has been placed on}} utilization of solar energy resource in Norway. In this study, the results obtained from field monitoring the performance of a 2. 07 kWp photovoltaic grid-connected system installed at the Norwegian University of Life Sciences, Ås, Norway, is presented. The PV-system is mounted on the flat section of the roof of a laboratory building at the Department of Mathematical Science and Technology of the University. Detailed performance measurement of the system started in February 2013, and still on going.

The in-plane irradiance, array <b>power</b> <b>output,</b> <b>system</b> power output and other parameters are measured and averaged every 1 -minute by a data logger integrated in the inverter. The measured data was utilized to estimate the reference yield, array yield and final yield, as well as other performance parameters of the system. The specific yield of the system through to recording period was found to be 931. 6 kWh/kW-year. The monthly average array yield varied between 0. 04 kWh/kWp-day in January and 4. 8 kWh/kWp-day in July, with an overall average value of 2. 73 kWh/kWp-day. The monthly average final yield was found to vary between 0. 02 kWh/kWp-day in January and 4. 5 kWh/kWp-day in July, with an overall average value of 2. 54 kWh/kWp-day.

40|$|Graduation date: 2016 An {{enabling}} technology for long duration, deep space missions is {{the availability of}} a high power, long-lived power supply. The goal of this work is the design of a self-regulating deep space nuclear reactor. The design objectives are to produce 250 kWth for a 25 -year period using the presence of a microgravity field to regulate <b>power</b> <b>output.</b> <b>System</b> reliability is optimized by eliminating the use of mechanical moving parts and the need for external input for operation - either from human or software controllers - while building on the foundation of previous technology developments. To achieve the power output objective, a nuclear reactor is fueled with Uranium-Zirconium Hydride fuel with a coolant of sodium/potassium eutectic (NaK- 78) circulated using electromagnetic pumps. Uranium- 235 and burnable poison concentrations are adjusted to achieve the mission duration objective. Reactivity control is provided using an outer shield of liquid uranyl sulfate solution. This shield is thermally isolated from the reactor core to permit operation at a high temperature for thermodynamic efficiency while maintaining the reflector at a lower temperature for good power feedback. The novel concept of using a liquid reflector has two advantages: reactor operation is permissible only {{in the presence of a}} microgravity field and in the event of an inadvertent re-entry, the liquid reflector would volatize leaving the remaining structure inherently subcritical. Once deployed to a microgravity environment, a wicking structure embedded in the reflector fills with uranyl sulfate solution and the reactor becomes slightly super critical. Reactor power level increases until fuel temperature reactivity feedback limits power to the design goal of 250 kWth. Burnable poisons are used to compensate for the negative reactivity effects of fission product buildup over time. In effect, the reactor can operate only in a microgravity field. This work also details the construction of a model for validating the shut down margin criticality of TRIGA reactor storage racks. These racks are mounted in the reactor pools and are used to store the fuel that is not in use. TRIGA zirconium hydride fuel is similar to the fuel type that was ultimately calculated for use in the Self-Regulating Deep Space Nuclear Reactor. In both situations a very strong prompt negative reactivity coefficient is desirable. Zirconium hydride fuel is the most mature candidate for such applications...|$|E

The real-time thermal rating of existing power system components has the potential to unlock latent power transfer capacities. When integrated with a DG <b>power</b> <b>output</b> control <b>system,</b> greater installed capacities of DG may be accommodated within the distribution network.

The research presented in this thesis forms part of a UK government funded project which aims to develop and deploy an on-line <b>power</b> <b>output</b> control <b>system</b> for wind-based DG schemes. This is based on the concept that high power flows resulting from wind generation at high wind speeds could be accommodated since the same wind speed has a positive effect on component cooling mechanisms. The control system compares component real-time thermal ratings with network power flows and produces set points that are fed back to the DG for implementation. The control algorithm comprises: (i) An inference engine (using rule-based artificial intelligence) that decides when DG control actions are required; (ii) a DG set point calculator (utilising predetermined power flow sensitivity factors) that computes updated DG <b>power</b> <b>outputs</b> to manage distribution network power flows; and (iii) an on-line simulation tool that validates the control actions before dispatch.

Further calculations were performed to verify other quantities such as mutual and self-inductance. My results indicate that wireless power transfer is viable and can indeed be practical for medium-ranged applications...|$|R

Solar Photovoltaic (PV) is a technology that converts sunlight directly into electrical energy. When the entire array does not receive uniform insolation under partial shaded conditions affect the <b>power</b> <b>output</b> of solar <b>system.</b> This paper presents Design of solar PV as DER (Distributed Energy resources) and its mathematical modeling and its P-V and I-V characteristics and compared with MSX 60 PV module under various temperature levels. ________________________________________________________________________________________________________ I...|$|R
40|$|AbstractOrganic Rankine Cycle(ORC) can {{effectively}} recover the low grade heat source {{due to its}} distinctive thermodynamic performance. Based on Genetic Algorithm, net <b>power</b> <b>output</b> per unit mass of geothermal water is set as the objective function. Evaporation pressure, superheating of the steam, the minimum temperature in the evaporator are analyzed to obtain the optimal performance of the system. The results indicate that under the assumption condition that the optimal level constitution of system parameters is determined as the working fluid of R 227 ea, the <b>power</b> <b>output</b> of the <b>system</b> of 596 kw and the corresponding <b>power</b> <b>output</b> per unit mass of geothermal water of 11. 91 kJ/kg. R 245 ca has the maximal efficiency of 5. 75 % among the selected 6 working fluids (Butane, R 236 fa, R 227 ea, R 236 ea, R 245 fa, R 245 ca). The effect of pinch temperature in evaporator on <b>power</b> <b>output</b> per unit mass is more seriously than that of superheating. It is about 7 times in terms of increasing 1 K of R 227 ea...|$|R
40|$|An {{irreversible}} {{combined cycle}} {{is used to}} analyse {{the performance of a}} two-stage combined heat engine <b>system.</b> The specific <b>power</b> <b>output</b> of the <b>system</b> is adopted as an objective function for optimization. The maximum specific <b>power</b> <b>output</b> and the corresponding efficiency are derived. The optimally combined conditions of two irreversible cycles are determined. Several special cases are discussed. The results obtained are compared with those of a single-stage irreversible heat engine. Moreover, it is expounded that the performance of a two-stage irreversible combined cycle may be described by an equivalent simplified cycle system and the optimal performance of an n-stage irreversible combined heat engine system is given. The aim of this research is to provide some new significant conclusions and redress some errors existing in a related investigation...|$|R
