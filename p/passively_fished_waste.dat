Data collection for this project included obtaining secondary data from publicly available sources. Alaskan shorebased seafood processing facilities discharge water mixed with <b>fish</b> <b>waste</b> from an outfall(s). Once discharged, buoyant <b>fish</b> <b>waste</b> enters the water column and floats to the surface, while denser fragments sink. <b>Fish</b> <b>waste</b> accumulates on the seafloor and creates <b>fish</b> <b>waste</b> piles. A persistent <b>fish</b> <b>waste</b> pile depletes the oxygen from the water column, smothers benthic invertebrates, alters benthic habitat and creates dead zones, all which lead {{to changes in the}} overall ecosystem. As the deposited material breaks down, it produces hydrogen sulfide and ammonia, which may be released into the environment and affect aquatic ecosystem health. Less than fifty percent of the facilities in the data set are in compliance with the requirement to monitor their <b>fish</b> <b>waste</b> piles. At least 115 acres of the Alaska seafloor is covered by <b>fish</b> <b>waste</b> piles and the impacts of these 115 acres are not widely known. The recovery process of benthic communities is typically different than a simple reverse of the pattern observed during its decline. It is unlikely that any benthic community impacted by these <b>fish</b> <b>waste</b> piles will recover to its original state, even if the organic loading ceases...|$|R
