40|$|The {{application}} of industrial robots for machining of complex parts {{is a very}} promising field that refers {{to the ability of}} the robot to produce parts with complex geometries that typically requires multi-axes machine tools. However, there are many restrictions that limit the use of robot in advanced manufacturing industry such as positioning errors and low stiffness. This work investigates the positioning accuracy and the <b>path</b> <b>repeatability</b> of a Mitsubishi RV- 1 A robot with six degree of freedom during machining movements by using a Faro laser tracker. The results obtained show a significant motion error caused by the robot, even with the absence of cutting force. A comparison has been made between the positions of the commanded path measurements taken by the robot controller and the actual position of the end effector of the robot measured by the tracker...|$|E
40|$|Laser welding is used {{in modern}} {{industrial}} production due to its high welding speed and good welding performance comparing to more traditional arc welding. To improve the flex-ibility, robots {{can be used to}} mount the laser tool. However, laser welding has a high require-ment for the accuracy in positioning the laser tool. There are three main related variables which affect the laser welding accuracy: robot path accuracy, workpiece geometry and fixture repeatability. Thus, joint tracking is very important for laser welding to achieve high quality welds. There are many joint tracking systems which were proposed in recent years. After receiv-ing the joint information, a control system is necessary to control the robot motion in real-time. The open control system for the industrial robot is one trend for the future. A lot of methods and systems are proposed to control the robot motion. Some systems can achieve a high accuracy in the experiments. However, it is still hard to apply them in practical indus-trial production. Thus more commercial solutions appear to overcome the robot motion problem nowadays. They are very useful to realize practical applications. ABB EGM path correction module, a new function of Robotware, is one of the com-mercial solutions for robot motion control in real time. In the experiments presented in this work, a computer is used to simulate a sensor to create a path correction signal. To test its feasibility for the laser welding application, many experiments are conducted. One was to test the robot <b>path</b> <b>repeatability</b> when there is no correction message sent to the robot. Another was to test the level of accuracy EGM can achieve during the correction process. Different types of paths and three different speeds were separately carried out. The results showed {{that it is possible to}} use the EGM in the laser welding application. In the EGM feasibility test, there exists deviation in the z-direction. Since these deviations are less than 0. 2 mm, it will have a minor influence the laser welding performance, implying that the EGM path correction can be applied in practical production...|$|E
40|$|Robot {{control systems}} can be {{considered}} complex systems, {{the design of a}} controller involving the determination of the dynamic model for the system. Fuzzy logic provides functional capability without the use of a system model or the characteristics associated with capturing the approximate, varying values found in real world systems. Development of a multi-axis fuzzy logic control system was implemented on an industrial robot, replacing the existing control and hardware systems with a new developmental system. During robot control no adaptation of the rule base or membership functions was carried out on line; only system gain was modified in relation to link speed and joint error within predetermined design parameters. The fuzzy control system had to manage the effects of frictional and gravitational forces whilst compensating for the varying inertia components when each linkage is moving. Testing based on ISO 9283 for <b>path</b> accuracy and <b>repeatability</b> verified that real time control of three axes was achievable with values of 938 µm and 864 µm recorded for accuracy and repeatability respectively...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the theoretical design for experimental verification {{of the structural}} and technological parameters of the Parallel Kinematic Structure. The experimental equipment was developed at the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, STU in Bratislava. It is called Tricept, and due to its kinematics it is classified as a parallel structure. The previous phase of the project dealt with developing a mathematical model of the tool path. We have worked with two methods, a Monte Carlo method {{and the use of}} a mathematical analytical geometry structure. The calculated values were verified by comparing the results of the two methods. Based on the equations that were obtained, we can design the control of the tool path during cutting. The next stage focuses on the test methods and on verifying the structural and technological parameters of Tricept. The experiment is designed {{on the basis of the}} EN ISO 9283 standard, and involves testing the technological parameters: one-way positioning accuracy and repeatability of the position, changes of multidirectional positioning accuracy, repeatability and accuracy of the distance, position overshoot, drift of the position parameters, <b>path</b> accuracy, and <b>repeatability</b> of the <b>path.</b> This paper classifies the measurement methods and {{presents the}} measurement processes and the equipment for the experiment...|$|R
40|$|The visual {{systems of}} many animals feature energetically costly specializations {{to enable them}} to {{function}} in dim light. It is often unclear, however, how large the behavioural benefit of these specializations is, because a direct comparison in a behaviourally relevant task between closely related day- and night-active species is not usually possible. Here we compared the orientation performance of diurnal and nocturnal species of dung beetles, Scarabaeus (Kheper) lamarcki and Scarabaeus satyrus, respectively, attempting to roll dung balls along straight paths both during the day and at night. Using video tracking, we quantified the straightness of <b>paths</b> and the <b>repeatability</b> of roll bearings as beetles exited a flat arena in their natural habitat or under controlled conditions indoors. Both species oriented equally well when either the moon or an artificial point light source was available, but when the view of the moon was blocked and only wide-field cues such as the lunar polarization pattern or the stars were available for orientation, nocturnal beetles were oriented substantially better. We found no evidence that ball-rolling speed changed with light level, which suggests little or no temporal summation in the visual system. Finally, we found that both diurnal and nocturnal beetles tended to choose bearings that led them towards a bright light source, but away from a dim one. Our results show that even diurnal insects, at least those with superposition eyes, could orient {{by the light of the}} moon, but that dim-light adaptations are needed for precise orientation when the moon is not visible...|$|R
