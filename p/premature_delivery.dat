25|$|By default, all the var {{genes in}} the malarial {{parasite}} are inactivated. Activation (gene expression) of var is initiated upon infection of the organs. Further, in each organ only specific var genes are activated. The severity of the infection {{is determined by the}} type of organ in which infection occurs, hence, the type of var gene activated. For examples, in the most severe cases of malaria, such as cerebral malaria, only the var genes for the PfEMP1 proteins DC8 and DC13 are switched on. Upon the synthesis of DC8 and DC13, their CIDRα1 domains bind to EPCR, which brings about the onset of severe malaria. The abundance of the gene products (transcripts) of these PfEMP1 proteins (specifically the CIDRα1 subtype transcripts) directly relates to the severity of the disease. This further indicates that preventing the interaction between CIDRα1 and EPCR would be good target for a potential vaccine. In pregnancy-associated malaria, another severe type of falciparum malaria, the gene for VAR2CSA (named var2csa) is activated in the placenta. Binding of VAR2CSA to CSA is the primary cause of <b>premature</b> <b>delivery,</b> death of the foetus and severe anaemia in the mother. This indicates that drugs targeting VAR2CSA will be able to prevent the effects of malaria, and for this reason VAR2CSA is the leading candidate for development of a PAM vaccine.|$|E
2500|$|Infection late in {{gestation}} or {{immediately following}} birth {{is referred to as}} [...] "neonatal varicella". Maternal infection is associated with <b>premature</b> <b>delivery.</b> The risk of the baby developing the disease is greatest following exposure to infection in the period 7 days before delivery and up to 8 days following the birth. The baby may also be exposed to the virus via infectious siblings or other contacts, but this is of less concern if the mother is immune. Newborns who develop symptoms are at a high risk of pneumonia and other serious complications of the disease.|$|E

40|$|Summary. Tensile strength, mucopolysaccharide deposits, {{hexosamine}} and collagen {{contents of}} membranes were studied in mature and pre-mature deliveries. Membrane tensile strength, which {{was found to}} vary between 50 and 500 g/cm, is significantly higher in membranes of <b>premature</b> <b>deliveries</b> as compared to mature deliveries. An inverse correlation between tensile strength and foetal weight was observed. Acid mucopolysaccharides are more frequently and abundantly found in membranes as pregnancy progresses. A similar tendency was found with hexosamine content of the membranes. Collagen values did not vary significantly in mature and <b>premature</b> <b>deliveries.</b> A significant correlation {{was found between the}} reduction of collagen=m- hexosamine ratio and reduction in membrane tensile strength. The possibility that this change is related to placental dysfunction and associated with hormonal imbalance has been discussed...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} the obstetric maternal and neonatal outcome of pregnancy {{in women with}} Marfan syndrome. Methods: Retrospective observational multi-center study based on congenital heart disease registry. Results: Sixty-three of the 122 enrolled women with Marfan syndrome had been pregnant 142 times (including 111 pregnancies > 20 weeks, 28 (20 %) miscarriages and 3 elective abortions). In 40 % of all completed pregnancies an obstetric and/or neonatal complication occurred. The most important complications were an increased percentage of <b>premature</b> <b>deliveries</b> (n= 17, 15 %) mainly due to preterm premature rupture of membranes and cervical incompetence and a markedly increased combined fetal and neonatal mortality of 7. 1 %. An obstetric and/ or neonatal complication occurred in a similar proportion of pregnancies in women with a diagnosis of Marfan syndrome before pregnancy versus women with a diagnosis of Marfan syndrome after pregnancy (39 % vs. 41 %, p= 0. 85, respectively). Conclusion: In addition to cardiovascular complications, pregnancy in women with Marfan syndrome {{is associated with a}} high rate of <b>premature</b> <b>deliveries,</b> preterm <b>premature</b> rupture of membranes and increased mortality in the offspring.

40|$|BackgroundChorioamnionitis {{is closely}} related to {{premature}} birth and has negative effects on neonatal morbidity and mortality. MethodsIn this prospective study, 43 mothers who delivered earlier than 35 gestational weeks and their 57 infants were evaluated clinically and with laboratory findings. Placentas and umbilical cords were investigated histopathologically for chorioamnionitis and funisitis. ResultsThe overall frequency of clinical and histological chorioamnionitis (HCA) was 8. 3 % and 23. 2 %, respectively. The frequency of HCA was 47. 3 % and 83. 3 % in mothers delivered < 32 weeks and < 30 weeks, respectively. Maternal demographic and clinical findings and also leukocyte and C-reactive protein values were not indicative of HCA. Infants of mothers with HCA had significantly lower Apgar scores together with higher SNAP-PE-II and CRIB scores. These infants had increased mechanical ventilator and surfactant requirements, higher incidences of patent ductus arteriosus, early sepsis, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and higher mortality rates. The effect of HCA on neonatal morbidity and mortality was more prominent than the effect of low birthweight and lower gestational age. ConclusionChorioamnionitis not only causes <b>premature</b> <b>deliveries,</b> but is also associated with neonatal complications and increased mortality. Clinical findings and infectious markers in mother or infant do not predict the diagnosis of histological chorioamnionitis. Therefore, placental histopathology may have a role in predicting neonatal outcome in <b>premature</b> <b>deliveries,</b> especially those below 30 weeks...|$|R
50|$|The {{physical}} effects {{of domestic violence}} on children, different than the effects of direct abuse, can start when they are fetus in their mother's womb, can result in low infant birth weights, premature birth, excessive bleeding, and fetal death, due to the mother's physical trauma and emotional stress. Increased maternal stress during the times of abuse, especially when combined with smoking and drug abuse, {{can also lead to}} <b>premature</b> <b>deliveries</b> and low weight babies. When a woman is stressed while pregnant, the baby can be born with stress and anxiety and can sometimes have problems with growth.|$|R

40|$|The {{geographic}} and demographic dimensions of Spain, {{in terms of}} surface and number of inhabitants, and its heterogeneous socioeconomic development offer an adequate opportunity to study the provincial differences in birth weight from 1996 to 2010, focusing on possible factors determining the relative frequency of low birth weight. The study analysed geographic differences with regard to biological, demographic and socioeconomic factors that interfere with the female reproductive pattern. The variables considered here were: birth order, proportion of <b>premature</b> <b>deliveries,</b> mother's age, multiparity, mother's country of origin and professional qualifications. Two periods (1996 – 2000 and 2006 – 2010) were compared by means of principal components analysis. An increase in the relative frequency of deliveries weighing less than 2500 g occurred {{in most of the}} 52 geographic units studied, differences being significant in 42. Only in five cases was there a non-significant reduction in the proportion of low weight births. The first component after principal component analysis indicated that low birth weight was positively related to maternal age and to multiple deliveries, and negatively to the mother's low professional qualification. The second component related positively to the incidence of <b>premature</b> <b>deliveries</b> and to non-Spanish status and negatively in the case of primiparous mothers. The progressive increase in low birth weight incidence observed in Spain from 1996 onwards has occurred with considerable variation in each province. In part, this diversity {{can be attributed to the}} unequal reproductive patterns of immigrant mothers...|$|R
40|$|We {{studied the}} effect of {{previous}} induced and spontaneous abortion on gestational duration in subsequent pregnancies in 12 obstetric departments in the Netherlands. Only primiparae were studied. Of 504 women who had had a previous induced abortion, 18 (3. 6 %) delivered before 32 weeks' gestational age. Forty of 1313 women {{with a history of}} spontaneous abortion (3. 0 %) and 259 of 12 678 women with no history of abortion (2. 1 %) also delivered before 32 weeks. The differences between the three groups were not significant. In the Netherlands there are no significant indications that spontaneous midtrimester abortions or <b>premature</b> <b>deliveries</b> are caused by a previous induced abortion...|$|R
50|$|Most {{cases of}} infant {{respiratory}} distress syndrome can be ameliorated or prevented if {{mothers who are}} about to deliver prematurely can be given glucocorticoids, one group of hormones. This speeds the production of surfactant. For very <b>premature</b> <b>deliveries,</b> a glucocorticoid is given without testing the fetal lung maturity. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), Royal College of Medicine, and other major organizations have recommended antenatal glucocorticoid treatment for women at risk for preterm delivery prior to 34 weeks of gestation. Multiple courses of glucocorticoid administration, compared with a single course, {{does not seem to}} increase or decrease the risk of death or neurodevelopmental disorders of the child.|$|R
50|$|No {{significant}} differences in pregnancy outcomes were found in a study evaluating pregnancy outcomes after cervical conization. This study suggests for women with cervical insufficiency due to prior cone biopsy, cerclage is not superior to no intervention.

50|$|Though GBS {{colonization}} is asymptomatic and, in general, {{does not}} cause problems, it can sometimes cause serious illness for {{the mother and the}} baby during gestation and after delivery.
