25|$|PVC and jelly-rubber toys {{have been}} found to be {{problematic}} because they contain unsafe <b>phthalates,</b> softeners added to many plastics that are also found in some jewelry, food containers, and other soft rubber toys. <b>Phthalates</b> have been linked to health problems such as cancer and prenatal defects.

25|$|<b>Phthalates,</b> {{which are}} {{incorporated}} into plastics as plasticizers, comprise approximately 70% of the U.S. plasticizer market; <b>phthalates</b> are by design not covalently bound to the polymer matrix, which makes them highly susceptible to leaching. <b>Phthalates</b> are contained in plastics at high percentages. For example, they can contribute up to 40% by weight to intravenous medical bags and up to 80% by weight in medical tubing. Vinyl products are pervasive—including toys, car interiors, shower curtains, and flooring—and initially release chemical gases into the air. Some studies indicate that this outgassing of additives may contribute to health complications, and {{have resulted in a}} call for banning the use of DEHP on shower curtains, among other uses. Japanese car companies Toyota, Nissan, and Honda eliminated the use of PVC in car interiors since 2007.|$|E

50|$|Biodegradation of DEP in soil occurs by {{sequential}} hydrolysis {{of the two}} diethyl {{chains of}} the <b>phthalate</b> to produce monoethyl <b>phthalate,</b> followed by phthalic acid. This reaction occurs very slowly in an abiotic environment. Thus there exists an alternative pathway of biodegradation which includes transesterification or demethylation by microorganisms, if the soil is also contaminated with methanol, that would produce another three intermediate compounds, ethyl methyl <b>phthalate,</b> dimethyl <b>phthalate</b> and monomethyl <b>phthalate.</b> This biodegradation has been observed in several soil bacteria. Some bacteria with these abilities have specific enzymes involved in the degradation of phthalic acid esters such as <b>phthalate</b> oxygenase, <b>phthalate</b> dioxygenase, <b>phthalate</b> dehydrogenase and <b>phthalate</b> decarboxylase.The developed intermediates of the transesterification or demethylation, ethyl methyl <b>phthalate</b> and dimethyl <b>phthalate,</b> enhance the toxic effect {{and are able to}} disrupt the membrane of microorganisms.|$|R

40|$|Objectives: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the impact of <b>phthalate</b> exposure on pregnancy duration and birth outcomes based on the Polish Mother and Child Cohort (REPRO_PL). Material and Methods: <b>Phthalate</b> exposure was determined by measuring 11 <b>phthalate</b> metabolites (mono-ethyl <b>phthalate</b> (MEP), mono-iso-butyl <b>phthalate</b> (MiBP), mono-n-butyl <b>phthalate</b> (MnBP), 3 OH-mono-n-butyl <b>phthalate</b> (OH-MnBP), mono-benzyl <b>phthalate</b> (MBzP), mono‑ (2 -ethylhexyl) <b>phthalate</b> (MEHP), mono-(2 -ethyl- 5 -hydroxyhexyl) <b>phthalate</b> (MEHHP), mono-(2 -ethyl- 5 -oxohexyl) <b>phthalate</b> (MEOHP), mono-hydroxy-iso-nonyl <b>phthalate</b> (MHiNP), mono-oxo-iso-nonyl <b>phthalate</b> (MOiNP), and mono-n-octyl <b>phthalate</b> (MOP)) in the urine collected from 165 mothers during the third trimester of pregnancy by high performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). The following measures at birth were considered: gestational age, birth weight, length as well as head and chest circumference. Results: Pregnancy duration was inversely associated with natural log concentrations (μg/g creatinine) of MEP (standardized regression coefficient (β) = – 0. 2, p = 0. 04) after adjustment for a variety of confounders. Significant impact of MOiNP on head circumference (β = – 0. 1, p = 0. 05) was also observed. Conclusions: The study findings add further support to the hypothesis that <b>phthalate</b> exposure may be associated with shorter pregnancy duration and a decreased head circumference, and underscore importance of public health interventions to reduce that exposure...|$|R

The assessment of potential risks related to <b>phthalates,</b> {{and in particular the}} use of DEHP in PVC medical devices, was subject to scientific and policy review by the European Union authorities, and on 21 March 2010, a specific labeling requirement was introduced across the EU for all devices containing <b>phthalates</b> that are classified as CMR (carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic to reproduction).

40|$|Few {{studies have}} {{examined}} the association between environmental <b>phthalate</b> exposure and children's neurocognitive development.

We recruited 430 pregnant women in their third trimester in Taichung, Taiwan from 2001 - 2002. A total of 110, 79, 76, and 73 children were followed up at ages 2, 5, 8, and 11, respectively. We evaluated the children's cognitive function at four different time points using the Bayley and Wechsler tests for assessing neurocognitive functions and intelligence (IQ). Urine samples were collected from mothers during pregnancy and from children at each follow-up visit. They were analyzed for seven metabolite concentrations of widely used <b>phthalate</b> esters. These esters included monomethyl <b>phthalate,</b> monoethyl <b>phthalate,</b> mono-butyl <b>phthalate,</b> mono-benzyl <b>phthalate,</b> and three metabolites of di(2 -ethylhexyl) <b>phthalate,</b> namely, mono- 2 -ethylhexyl <b>phthalate,</b> mono(2 -ethyl- 5 -hydroxyhexyl) <b>phthalate,</b> and mono(2 -ethyl- 5 -oxohexyl) <b>phthalate.</b> We constructed a linear mixed model to examine the relationships between the <b>phthalate</b> metabolite concentrations and the Bayley and IQ scores.

25|$|Pure {{plastics}} {{have low}} toxicity {{due to their}} insolubility in water {{and because they are}} biochemically inert, due to a large molecular weight. Plastic products contain a variety of additives, some of which can be toxic. For example, plasticizers like adipates and <b>phthalates</b> are often added to brittle plastics like polyvinyl chloride to make them pliable enough for use in food packaging, toys, and many other items. Traces of these compounds can leach out of the product. Owing to concerns over the effects of such leachates, the European Union has restricted the use of DEHP (di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate) and other <b>phthalates</b> in some applications, and the United States has limited the use of DEHP, DPB, BBP, DINP, DIDP, and DnOP in children's toys and child care articles with the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act.

25|$|Many {{processes}} in a {{wastewater treatment plant}} are designed to mimic the natural treatment processes {{that occur in the}} environment, whether that environment is a natural water body or the ground. If not overloaded, bacteria in the environment will consume organic contaminants, although this will reduce the levels of oxygen in the water and may significantly change the overall ecology of the receiving water. Native bacterial populations feed on the organic contaminants, and the numbers of disease-causing microorganisms are reduced by natural environmental conditions such as predation or exposure to ultraviolet radiation. Consequently, in cases where the receiving environment provides a high level of dilution, a high degree of wastewater treatment may not be required. However, recent evidence has demonstrated that very low levels of specific contaminants in wastewater, including hormones (from animal husbandry and residue from human hormonal contraception methods) and synthetic materials such as <b>phthalates</b> that mimic hormones in their action, can have an unpredictable adverse impact on the natural biota and potentially on humans if the water is re-used for drinking water. In the US and EU, uncontrolled discharges of wastewater to the environment are not permitted under law, and strict water quality requirements are to be met, as clean drinking water is essential. (For requirements in the US, see Clean Water Act.) A significant threat in the coming decades will be the increasing uncontrolled discharges of wastewater within rapidly developing countries.|$|E
