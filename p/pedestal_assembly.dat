40|$|Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) {{is a major}} {{foodborne}} {{cause of}} bloody diarrhea and renal failure. During colonization of the intestine, EHEC injects the transmembrane receptor protein Tir and the cytoplasmic effector protein EspFU into host cells to reorganize the actin cytoskeleton into adhesion “pedestals. ” EspFU {{has been shown to}} bind and activate the actin nucleation factor N-WASP to drive actin polymerization into pedestals. However, EspFU can still assemble pedestals in cells lacking N-WASP, suggesting that this effector protein is able to also trigger N-WASP-independent pathways of actin polymerization during infection. Cortactin is an atypical nucleation factor that localizes to pedestals, but its precise role in pedestal formation in {{the presence or absence of}} N-WASP has not been well defined. To test whether Cortactin functions in <b>pedestal</b> <b>assembly,</b> I used RNA interference to silence Cortactin expression in N-WASP wild type (WT) and N-WASP knockout (KO) mouse fibroblasts, infected these cells with an E. coli strain expressing myc-tagged EspFU and HA-tagged Tir, and examined them for actin pedestals. Consistent with previous observations, N-WASP KO cells contained slightly fewer and less-intensely stained actin pedestals than WT cells when each was treated with control siRNAs. Similarly, Cortactin depletion in WT cells resulted in a modest decrease in the number and intensity of actin pedestals. However, when Cortactin expression was silenced in KO cells, <b>pedestal</b> <b>assembly</b> was virtually abolished even though Tir and EspFU were still present. These results suggest that N-WASP and Cortactin are functionally redundant, and that Cortactin plays a previously-unrecognized potent role in N-WASP-independent <b>pedestal</b> <b>assembly...</b>|$|E

40|$|Beam {{stability}} {{is a major}} concern for the operation of the APS. One of the many contributing factors to electron-beam in{{stability is}} mechanical vibration of the accelerator components especially the focusing magnets. The electron beam should be stable to 5 % of its rms size to maintain the specified photon beam stability. The APS uses steel girders to support the conventional magnets and vacuum chambers in the storage ring (SR). Three <b>pedestal</b> and jack <b>assemblies</b> support the girders. Damping pads are presently installed between the pedestals and the jacks. These damping pads {{have been shown to be}} very effective in reducing the fundamental girder-vibration mode. The horizontal vibration levels of the SR quadrupole magnets are presently within specification at between two and four times the ground motion, i. e., 50 - 100 nm rms (4 - 50 Hz). Future improvements to the APS beam quality would require a further reduction in girder vibration. Several options for reducing the vibration of the girders and magnets are discussed, and the measurement results are presented...|$|R

40|$|Many {{microbial}} pathogens {{manipulate the}} actin cytoskeleton of eukaryotic target cells {{to promote their}} internalization, intracellular motility and dissemination. Enteropathogenic and enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli, which both cause severe diarrhoeal disease, can adhere to mammalian intestinal cells and induce reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton into 2 ̆ 7 pedestal-like 2 ̆ 7 pseudopods beneath the extracellular bacteria. As <b>pedestal</b> <b>assembly</b> is triggered by E. coli virulence factors that mimic several host cell-signalling components, such as transmembrane receptors, their cognate ligands and cytoplasmic adaptor proteins, it {{can serve as a}} powerful model system to study eukaryotic transmembrane signalling. Here, we consider the impact of recent data on our understanding of both E. coli pathogenesis and cell biology, and the rich prospects for exploiting these bacterial factors as versatile tools to probe cellular signalling pathways...|$|E
40|$|Enterohaemorrhagic and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EHEC and EPEC) are enteric {{pathogens}} {{that cause}} disease through intimate attachment and subversion of intestinal epithelial cells. This strategy {{depends on a}} type III secretion system (T 3 SS) to translocate effector proteins into host cells. EspJ is a T 3 SS effector protein that inhibits opsono-phagocytosis through an unidentified mechanism. This study aimed to determine the mechanism of action of EspJ through analysis of the protein itself {{and its effects on}} eukaryotic cell signalling. Bioinformatic analysis of EspJ revealed a predicted ADP-ribosyltransferase (ART) domain which mediates transfer of ADP-ribose from NAD on to a target protein. Through structural comparison with known ARTs, mutations were designed targeting predicted key ART domain residues. NMR analysis revealed that EspJ binds NAD and also that this interaction was disrupted by ART domain mutations. Mutation of the ART domain also disrupted inhibition of opsono-phagocytosis by EspJ. Further analysis of phagocytosis revealed that EspJ inhibits actin polymerisation and tyrosine phosphorylation during FcγR-mediated phagocytosis. During infection, EPEC and EHEC use the translocated effector Tir to initiate actin polymerisation pathways leading to the formation of actin rich pedestals on cultured cells. TirEPEC signalling {{is similar to that of}} the FcγR and so the impact of EspJ on pedestal formation was analysed. EspJ inhibited the tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent TirEPEC-mediated actin <b>pedestal</b> <b>assembly</b> but not the phosphorylation-independent TirEHEC signalling. Inhibition of EPEC pedestals correlated with reduced tyrosine phosphorylation and recruitment of the SH 2 -adaptor Nck. Importantly, an absence of Src family kinases (SFK) was observed in the presence of EspJ. EspJ inhibited FcγRIIa tyrosine phosphorylation suggesting that this effector acts at the initial stages of tyrosine kinase dependent actin polymerisation pathways preventing receptor phosphorylation by SFKs. Importantly, an intact ART domain was required for EspJ mediated inhibition of tyrosine phosphorylation and downstream actin polymerisation. Open Acces...|$|E
