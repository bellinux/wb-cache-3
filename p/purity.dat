5|$|High-purity thulium oxide {{was first}} offered commercially {{in the late}} 1950s, {{as a result of}} the {{adoption}} of ion-exchange separation technology. Lindsay Chemical Division of American Potash & Chemical Corporation offered it in grades of 99% and 99.9% <b>purity.</b> The price per kilogram has oscillated between US$4,600 and $13,300 in the period from 1959 to 1998 for 99.9% <b>purity,</b> and it was second highest for lanthanides behind lutetium.|$|E
5|$|Refined {{sugar is}} widely used for {{industrial}} needs for higher quality. Refined sugar is purer (ICUMSA below 300) than raw sugar (ICUMSA over 1,500). The level of <b>purity</b> associated with the colors of sugar, expressed by standard number ICUMSA, the smaller ICUMSA numbers indicate the higher <b>purity</b> of sugar.|$|E

50|$|The Yang tones were {{initially}} staged {{in the hall}} of the three <b>purities.</b> The three <b>purities</b> are the highest deities in Taoism and they are said to reside over the heavens (Murashige, 2005). The ceremony involved three female priests, two of which wore robes of simple red and black and the main priest wore a richly decorated robe of a jade colour. The priests {{stood in front of the}} three <b>purities</b> and read from prayer books before them. The priests maintained this formation throughout the entire ceremony until the end, when the main priest led them in single file around each of the altars in the temple to pay their respects to the other gods.|$|R

5|$|The {{expenditures}} that Caracalla {{made with}} the large bonuses he gave to soldiers prompted him to debase the coinage soon after his ascension. At the end of Severus' reign, and early into Caracalla's, the Roman denarius had an approximate silver <b>purity</b> of around 55%, {{but by the end}} of his reign the <b>purity</b> had been reduced to about 51%.|$|E
5|$|The {{material}} {{formed in}} the Acheson furnace varies in <b>purity,</b> according to its distance from the graphite resistor heat source. Colorless, pale yellow and green crystals have the highest <b>purity</b> and are found closest to the resistor. The color changes to blue and black at greater distance from the resistor, and these darker crystals are less pure. Nitrogen and aluminium are common impurities, and they affect the electrical conductivity of SiC.|$|E

40|$|Modifications to BMA K 850 centrifugals {{permitted}} increased throughputs of "C " massecuite in {{the order}} of 100 %. The resultant molasses <b>purities</b> were little affected, but brixes were two degrees lower than before modification. Tests showed that the prototype BMA KllOO can handle four tons of "C" massecuite per hour with molasses <b>purities</b> comparable with those of standard centrifugals, but with brixes lower than normal. Techniques of process water application were examined...|$|R
5|$|The {{quality of}} the Aksumite coins were also closely controlled, usually of high <b>purity.</b> For example, the lowest <b>purity</b> of gold {{recorded}} thus far for Aphilas is 90 percent. Early issues were often very close to their theoretical weights, and some were even over.) However, {{the weight of the}} coins tended to decrease over time (though not continuously or uniformly). This may have reflected a desire to conform to the Diocletian monetary reform of 301, when the aureus was decreased from 1/60 of a pound to 1/72. Despite decreases in weight, the <b>purity</b> of the gold was largely maintained, even by later kings. The relative abundance of Aksumite coins as well as the many that have yet to be found indicate that Aksum must have had access to large quantities of gold.|$|E

40|$|Vulvar itch is {{a common}} symptom and {{distressing}} problem. Puritius is an unpleasant sensation inductingthe desire to scratch. Diagnosis is made by history, clinical investigation, skin and vaginal patch testing or skinbiopsy. Acute vulvar <b>purities</b> is usually caused by infection or contact dermatitis.

50|$|Most glycol {{units are}} fairly uniform {{except for the}} {{regeneration}} step. Several methods are used to enhance the stripping of the glycol to higher <b>purities</b> (higher <b>purities</b> are required for dryer gas out of the absorber). Since the reboiler temperature is limited to 400F or less to prevent thermal degradation of the glycol, {{almost all of the}} enhanced systems center on lowering the partial pressure of water in the system to increase stripping.|$|R
40|$|The SU(2) and SU(3) Lie algebras lend {{themselves}} naturally to studies of two- and three-well Bose-Einstein condensates, {{with the group}} operators being {{expressed in terms of}} bosonic annihilation and creation operators at each site. The success of these representations has led to the <b>purities</b> associated with these algebras to be promoted as a measure of entanglement between the atomic modes in each well. In this report, we show that these <b>purities</b> do not provide an unambiguous measure, but instead give results which depend on the quantum statistical states of each atomic mode. Using the example of totally uncoupled modes which have never interacted, we quantify these <b>purities</b> for different states and show that completely separable states can give values which have been claimed to indicate the presence of entanglement...|$|R

5|$|Domitian's {{tendency}} towards micromanagement {{was nowhere}} {{more evident than}} in his financial policy. The question of whether Domitian left the Roman Empire in debt or with a surplus {{at the time of his}} death has been fiercely debated. The evidence points to a balanced economy for the greater part of Domitian's reign. Upon his accession he revalued the Roman currency dramatically. He increased the silver <b>purity</b> of the denarius from 90% to 98% — the actual silver weight increasing from 2.87grams to 3.26grams. A financial crisis in 85 forced a devaluation of the silver <b>purity</b> and weight to 93.5% and 3.04grams respectively.|$|E

5|$|In 215 Caracalla {{introduced}} the antoninianus, a coin intended {{to serve as}} a double denarius. This new currency, however, had a silver <b>purity</b> of about 52% for the period between 215 and 217 and an actual size ratio of 1antoninianus to 1.5denarii. This in effect made the antoninianus equal to about 1.5denarii. The reduced silver <b>purity</b> of the coins caused people to hoard the old coins that had higher silver content, making the inflation problem caused by the earlier devaluation of the denarii worse than it had been before.|$|E
40|$|The aim is {{to study}} the purely-injective ring moduli ring and <b>purities</b> in the ring moduli {{category}} by the theoretical-model methods. The total system of the invariants for non-decomposable purely-injective modulus above free catenary ring has been given. The free purely-injective right moduli above semi-catenary Neter ring right have been classified. The accurate criterion of existing the super-composable purely-injective modulus above commutative norming ring has been specified. The general method for investigation of the <b>purities</b> generated projectively by a class of the finite-represented moduli and rings determined by such <b>purities</b> has been developed. The Artins {{from one side of}} the RD-ring as a Kote ring have been characterized, and it has been shown that any Dedekind primary ring, for example, the first Weil algebra above zero characteristics field, possesses the RD-property. These results received the numerous applications in the theory of sigma-purely-injective moduli.
