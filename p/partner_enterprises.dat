These three functions are - as described under roles and functions - ideally taken on by three <b>partner</b> <b>enterprises</b> and/or organizations that have the relevant competences and responsibilities. As a minimum, the synergies can also be created between two <b>partner</b> <b>enterprises</b> or organizations, so long as the three functions are present.

30|$|External {{resource}} {{integration in}} open innovation: During {{the process of}} implementing its open innovation strategy, Haier utilized the relevant mechanisms mentioned in Open innovation business model section (on how to manage external resources), rather than rigidly negotiating with external resources case by case. The external resources were managed dynamically, which demonstrates the special role of these mechanisms in a self-rotating optimization cycle (Fig.  1). To identify {{the nature of the}} external resources, Haier classified them respectively into industrial (suppliers, <b>partner</b> <b>enterprises,</b> testing labs, etc.) and non-industrial (individuals, universities, research institutes, etc.) entities; hence the corresponding external resources with appropriate expertise could be integrated in order to match Haier’s requirements for technological innovation. Moreover, Haier adopted the “global talents” mechanism to ensure that qualified resources, without boundary limits, could be absorbed into the innovation process under a controllable system, namely the “participation constraint”, while unqualified resources were excluded from the innovation activities by means of “dynamic optimization”. According to the concrete requirements of technology innovation, some of the selected external resources (such as the strategic suppliers) could be stimulated by an “incentive compatibility” to yield extraordinary performances. In this regard, the qualified resources could effectively contribute to Haier’s basic research innovation, in combination with its product development innovation.|$|E
