40|$|AbstractTechnology safety {{represents}} a key enabling {{factor for the}} commercial use of hydrogen within the automotive industry. In the last years considerable <b>pre-normative</b> and normative <b>research</b> effort has produced regulations at national, European and global level, as well as international standards. Their validation is at the moment on going internationally. Additional research is required to improve this regulatory and standardization frame, which {{is also expected to}} have a beneficial effect on cost and product optimization. The present paper addresses results related to the experimental assessment and modeling of safety performance of high pressure onboard storage. To simulate the lifetime of onboard hydrogen tanks, commercial tanks have been subjected to filling-emptying cycles encompassing a fast-filling phase as prescribed by the European regulation on type-approval of hydrogen vehicles. The local temperature history inside the tanks has been measured and compared with the temperature outside at the tank metallic bosses, which is the measurement location identified by the regulation. Experimental activities are complemented by computational fluid-dynamics (CFD) modeling of the fast- filling process, by means of a numerical model previously validated. The outcome of these activities is a set of scientifically based data which will serve as input to future regulations and standards improvement...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} is to {{identify}} and quantify the additional risks related to hydrogen explosions during the operation of a hydrogen driven car. In a first attempt the accidents or failures of a simple one-tank hydrogen storage system has been studied as a main source of risk. Three types of initiators are taken into account: crash accidents, fire accidents without crash (no other cars are involved) and hydrogen leakages in normal situation with following ignition. The consequences of hydrogen ignition and/or explosion depend strongly on environmental conditions (geometry, wind, etc.), therefore the different configurations of operational and environmental conditions are specified. Then Event Tree / Fault Tree methods are applied for the risk assessment. The results of quantification permit to draw conclusions about the overall added risk of hydrogen technology as well as about the main contributors to the risk.

40|$|The Joint Committee on Structural Safety (JCSS for short) is {{concerned}} with fundamental and <b>pre-normative</b> <b>research</b> {{in the field of}} Structural Reliability and Risk Assessment, and is directly and indirectly involved in the development of ISO-standards and Eurocodes. The JCSS acts on behalf of five international research organizations, namely IABSE (bridges), CIB (buildings), fib (concrete), ECCS (steel) and RILEM (material testing). The basic idea is that reliability and safety principles should be the same for all types of materials and for all types of structures encountered in civil and building engineering structures. The message spread by the JCSS is that decisions with respect to structural design and assessment should be based on the principles of Bayesian decision theory. It is claimed that such an approach offers the best framework to combine theoretical knowledge, field and laboratory observations, experience and judgement into consistent and rational decisions. The two main present activities of the JCSS are the development of a Probabilistic Model Code and a Guidance Document on Risk Assessment. Within this framework there is special focus on issues like code calibration, robustness requirements, durability modeling and assessment of existing structures, inspection and maintenance strategies, and target reliabilities.

40|$|Storage of gases under pressure, {{including}} hydrogen, is {{a well-known}} technique. However the use of hydrogen tanks in vehicles, {{and in particular the}} challenge of using very high pressures, requires new safety and performance studies. The JRC-IE has developed a facility, GasTeF, for carrying out tests on full-scale high pressure vehicle's tanks for hydrogen or natural gas, but the testing of any other high-pressure components such as valves and pipes is also possible. GasTeF consists on a half-buried concrete bunker with annexed gas storage area. A high-pressure compressor and its controlling equipment and instrumentation as well as the pressure vessel containing the components to be tested are placed inside the bunker, which during tests is inertised using gaseous nitrogen: The facility is remotely controlled and its operation automatised. Typical tests performed in both type 3 and 4 cylinders are: - Fast-filling cycling, in which storage tanks are fast filled and slowly emptied using hydrogen pressurised up to 70 MPa, for at least 1000 times to simulate their lifetime in a road vehicle. During the cycling process the tank is monitored for leaks and permeation rates using gas chromatography. - Static permeation measurements as a function of time on tanks filled up to 70 MPa and temperatures to at least 85 °C. The results will be applied to validate existing and future standards and used as input to <b>pre-normative</b> <b>research</b> for the development and improvement of performance characterisation methodologies for hydrogen storage.

The provision of substantial funds by some individual member states to construct GMP facilities makes it an opportune time to network available gene therapy GMP facilities at an EU level. The integrated coordination of GMP production facilities and human skills for advanced gene and genetically-modified (GM) cell therapy, can dramatically enhance academic-led "First-in-man" gene therapy trials. Once proof of efficacy is gathered, technology can be transferred to the private sector which will take over further development taking advantage of knowledge and know-how. Complex technical challenges require existing production facilities to adapt to emerging technologies in a coordinated manner. These include a mandatory requirement for the highest quality of production translating gene-transfer technologies with pharmaceutical-grade GMP processes to the clinic. A consensus has emerged on the directions and priorities to adopt, applying to advanced technologies with improved efficacy and safety profiles, in particular AAV, lentivirus-based and oncolytic vectors.

The real objective of this European Standard is to provide unambiguous and clear classification principles for solid biofuels, to serve as a tool to enable efficient trading of biofuels and to enable good understanding between seller and buyer and between equipment manufacturers. The classifications given in this European Standard are provided with the objective of using biomass as a biofuel, and therefore do not deal with all other uses. In this framework, European Commission supported the BioNorm II project, with the main objective carry out a <b>pre-normative</b> <b>research</b> in the field of solid biofuels in close collaboration with the work of CEN TC 335. The general aim of the combustion boiler tests, in line with the Bionorm II project carried out in the Test Laboratory of RTU-IESE (Riga Technical University – Institute of Energy Systems and Environment), was to analyze the pellet quality parameters and properties that affect emissions and efficiency of a domestic wood pellet boiler.

40|$|In {{the context}} of {{defining}} protocols for the fueling or defueling of composite material hydrogen pressure tanks, {{it is crucial to}} not exceed certain temperature limits. 85 °C during fuelings is the upper boundary that the gas temperature should not exceed during the refueling of hydrogen cars in the standard SAE J 2601 - 2014. In the same manner, usual defueling recommendations suggest that the lower gas temperature boundary is- 40 °C. The project HyTransfer, an FCH JU funded <b>pre-normative</b> <b>research</b> project, aims at showing that setting these two limits on the wall temperature rather than on the gas temperature permits to diminish operational constraints and therefore obtain a significant improvement of the overall costs for fueling and defueling. In this context, the paper will show both for fueling and defueling, how the temperature of the tank wall can be estimated. The analysis of this temperature will be based on Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), experimental results and simple thermodynamical modeling. When analyzing the gas and wall temperature differences, it is first necessary to distinguish between cases with homogeneous and cases with heterogeneous gas temperature. Therefore, the paper will first show indicators of temperature disparities in the gas, followed by analyses of the gas and wall temperature differences by splitting the analysis in two cases: homogeneous and heterogeneous gas temperature. When the gas temperature can be considered as homogeneous, one can show how the wall temperature is reduced to the correct determination of the heat exchange parameter between the gas and wall. In {{the context of}} heterogeneities of temperature in the gas (fueling at low speed and defueling in general), the paper will provide correlations linking the gas and wall temperature differences to simple tank geometry parameters and fueling or defueling conditions. In the end, the problem of the determination of hot or cold spots in the tank wall will have been fully covered and reduced to the computation of a thermodynamical modeling combined with correlations so that highly time-demanding computations such as 3 D CFD are not mandatory.

40|$|International audienceSecurity {{and safety}} are crucial aspects {{in the design}} of nuclear {{engineering}} structures. Civil engineering design and the qualification of materials to dynamic loads must consider the accelerations which they undergo. These accelerations could integrate not only seismic activity but also shaking movements consecutive to aircraft impacts with higher cutoff frequency. Current methodologies for handling such a shock in the calculation stage are based on transient analyzes using classical finite element methods associated with explicit numerical schemes or projection on modal basis. In both cases, to represent in a meaningful way a medium frequency content, a fine mesh is required, which is hardly compatible with the size of models of the civil engineering structures. In order to extend the current industrial methodologies and to allow a better representation of the behavior of the structure in the medium frequency range, an approach coupling a temporal and non-linear analysis of the impact area with a frequency approach for the treatment of the resulting shaking with the Variational Theory of Complex Rays (VTCR) has been developed [1]. The aim is to use the computational efficiency of the implemented strategy and to include the medium frequency range to calculate the nuclear structures response to an aircraft impact. 1 INTRODUCTION For nearly three years in the framework of <b>pre-normative</b> <b>research</b> in nuclear construction (RENON), the constructability research institute (IRC) focused some of its efforts on improving the characterization of floor response spectra in the case of aircraft impacts. The study of airplane crash in the design and verification of nuclear engineering structures has two important and distinct aspects: (i) the resistance of the structure subjected to an impact, loading, and (ii) the qualification of inner equipments to the vibrations induced. The calculation of the resistance of the structure and its design do not generally raise problem with current methods, however, the calculation of induced vibrations, although few harmful to inner equipments, requires special attention, especially with the lack of efficiency of current approaches. Indeed the calculation of floor response spectra (FRS) in this case generally exhibits a set of high magnitude accelerations within a frequency range that is generally much higher than the one observed when calculating the FRS due to an earthquake.

Eventually, the experimentally validated and benchmarked procedures, methods, and protocols will be cast in international standards. The Specific Targeted Research Project Fuel Cell Testing, Safety & Quality Assurance (FCTESQA) funded by the Sixth Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development (FP 6) of the European Union addresses these issues through international cooperation. The project partners perform <b>pre-normative</b> <b>research,</b> benchmarking, and validation through round robin testing of harmonised, industry wide test protocols and testing methodologies for fuel cells. Three types of fuel cells: polymer electrolyte (PEFC), solid oxide (SOFC) and molten carbonate (MCFC) in stationary applications are tested in world class laboratories. For the first time, internationally agreed harmonised test procedures previously developed and compiled by the predecessor FCTESTNET project (FP 5 Research Training Network Fuel Cell Testing and Standardisation) are used to validate and benchmark them at three levels: single cells, fuel cell stacks, and entire systems. The project results are discussed, debated and agreed in co-operative progress meetings and dedicated international workshops under the auspices of the International Partnership for the hydrogen Economy (IPHE) and the International Energy Agency (IEA). It will support to minimise the gap between individual and independent management decision-making within companies and research groups and the outcome and experience of different research activities worldwide with harmonised, validated, and benchmarked procedures following accepted international quality practices.

40|$|This paper {{contains}} a critical {{examination of the}} current application of environmental biotechnologies {{in the field of}} bioremediation of contaminated groundwater and sediments. Based on analysis of conventional technologies applied in several European Countries and in the US, scientific, technical and administrative barriers and constraints which still need to be overcome for an improved exploitation of bioremediation are discussed. From this general survey, it is evident that in situ bioremediation is a highly promising and cost-effective technology for remediation of contaminated soil, groundwater and sediments. The wide metabolic diversity of microorganisms makes it applicable to an ever-increasing number of contaminants and contamination scenarios. On the other hand, in situ bioremediation is highly knowledge-intensive and its application requires a thorough understanding of the geochemistry, hydrogeology, microbiology and ecology of contaminated soils, groundwater and sediments, under both natural and engineered conditions. Hence, its potential still remains partially unexploited, largely {{because of a lack of}} general consensus and public concerns regarding the lack of effectiveness and control, poor reliability, and possible occurrence of side effects, for example accumulation of toxic metabolites and pathogens. Basic, applied and <b>pre-normative</b> <b>research</b> are all needed to overcome these barriers and make in situ bioremediation more reliable, robust and acceptable to the public, as well as economically more competitive. Research efforts should not be restricted to a deeper understanding of relevant microbial reactions, but also include their interactions with the large array of other relevant phenomena, as a function of the truly variable site-specific conditions. There is a need for a further development and application of advanced biomolecular tools for site investigation, as well as of advanced metabolic and kinetic modelling tools. These would allow a quicker evaluation of the bioremediation potential of a site, and in turn a preliminary assessment of the technical feasibility of the chosen bioprocess which could replace or at least reduce the need for time-consuming and expensive field tests. At the same time, field tests will probably remain unavoidable for a detailed design of full scale remedial actions and the above reported tools will in any event be useful for a better design and a more reliable operation.

40|$|The built {{environment}} usually constitutes {{a very important}} part of the real capital of a nation, and the construction sector represents more than 10 % of the yearly Gross National Product of the industrialised world. Good planning of all construction is important, and consideration of the service life of the work is of great interest and is a significant aspect of sustainability considerations. The need for more knowledge about degradation of materials, for structured methodology, and for working tools for those involved in the planning process, has resulted in an extensive effort in <b>pre-normative</b> <b>research</b> and standardisation regarding this field. This thesis presents a discussion on service life planning and the role of the Factor Method in such work, and especially, discussion of modification and development of the methodology. In the design process, the need to evaluate the service life of products is a great challenge, as the results will depend on both material properties and the environment in which the material is placed or used. A practical solution has to be based on a good knowledge in the field, but also on a sound working strategy, to ensure that different design scenarios can be compared in a standardised or structured way. The Factor Method is a promising working tool for such an evaluation and comparison, but is as such, still more of a methodology, than a method. Examples of the use of the methodology are still very limited, and the method as such, is much discussed by researchers. However, its future will depend upon how practical it will be to apply in use. The method is useful to estimate the service life of products, based on a known reference service life and a number of modifying factors. These factors in turn depend on the conditional differences between the specific project and the reference, in-use conditions. This thesis discusses the required precision of such a methodology, especially in light of inherent distributions in material properties, and the fact that the consequences of failure are often very limited. In such cases, the standardised Factor Method is considered to be quite useful, and should give the parties involved a good means for working in a structured and systematic way. QC 2010101...|$|E
40|$|In Italy most of Infrastructures {{and highway}} bridge {{systems have been}} built before the issue of modern seismic design codes. Chiefly, the {{existing}} transportation systems that built in the late 60 s and early 70 s were designed primarily for gravity loads. As a result, such systems do not employ seismic details and hence their structural performance is inadequate under earthquake ground motions. To decide for any retrofitting operation, the seismic behaviour of existing bridges must be assessed. Because the nonlinear procedures are becoming very popular in the frameworks of structural assessment, {{there is a need}} to accurately simulate authentic model to provide reliable indications about the performance required to this kind of structures. Based on these observations, this thesis is devoted to the seismic assessment of existing RC bridges. In particular, the vulnerability of an old RC viaduct with portal frame piers equipped with plain steel bars has been numerically and experimentally investigated. Subsequently, the retrofitting has been evaluated using Friction Pendulum System isolation “FPS”. The nonlinear FE modelling has been executed using OpenSEES software framework. The local behaviour of the bridge has been taking into account, mainly, the bond-slip, strain penetration effect of the plain steel bars, bar buckling and the shear behaviour effect of the transverse beams of the portal frame piers. Depending on a previous experimental campaign consisting of cyclically imposed displacements on 1 : 4 reduced scale models of a frame pier, belonging to the same RC highway viaduct, a new experimental activity has been proposed within the RETRO project funded by the European Union. In particular, Two specimens (scale 1 : 2. 5), 2 floors (total height is 5. 8 m) and 3 floors (total height is 10. 3 m) one-bay reinforced concrete frame respectively, were built and tested using the PsD technique with sub-structuring; the modelling of the entire viaduct is considered along with the non-linear behaviour of each pier. During the test campaign, two different configurations for the analysed viaduct have been considered; “As-built” and “Isolated with Friction Bearings”. The response of both cases has been compared to evaluate the effectiveness of the isolation system. To this end, two natural accelerograms were selected based on studying the seismiogenic zone of the bridge to represent, according to current seismic codes, the Serviceability and Ultimate limit states. Analysis and interpretation of the experimental were achieved throughout the data recorded by the instrumentation used in the test campaign. The results have been used to calibrate numerical models and to provide a detailed analysis of the performance of the as-built configuration and to show the effectiveness of friction pendulum systems for seismic protection, which will ultimately lead to guidelines for the assessment and design of similar structures as part of <b>pre-Normative</b> <b>research</b> in support to the Eurocodes...|$|E
