40|$|Abstract. Power {{consumption}} in data centers {{has been growing}} re-markably recent years, and <b>power</b> <b>saving</b> of their servers is essential. For <b>power</b> <b>saving</b> of these servers, <b>power</b> <b>saving</b> of an online transaction processing (OLTP) systems, which are major applications in data cen-ters, is important. The OLTP system consumes relatively large amount of power because it is often equipped {{with a lot of}} computing and storage resources. Its <b>power</b> <b>saving</b> is difficult because it is required to meet a service level agreement (SLA), and few <b>power</b> <b>saving</b> technologies have been proposed so far. In this paper, we proposed an application-aware <b>power</b> <b>saving</b> for OLTP in a multicore environment. Our proposed methodology aims to save power consumption of OLTP systems by dynamically scaling the operating frequency of processors based on response time observation. Response time is often an important metric of SLA. Application-aware <b>power</b> <b>saving</b> enables <b>power</b> <b>saving</b> in such systems subject to SLAs. In our experimental evaluations using industrial standard benchmark TPC-C and real server workloads, 7. 6 % of total power consumption was saved.

40|$|Abstract — In {{wireless}} communication system, <b>power</b> <b>saving</b> mechanism {{is a key}} issue since the mobile station operates depending on limited power. Hence, the IEEE 802. 16 e system provides three types of <b>power</b> <b>saving</b> classes (PSC I, PSC II and PSC III) for mobile station (MS) to reduce the power consumption. When the MS is using two or more <b>power</b> <b>saving</b> classes, the MS reduces the power consumption only during time interval that does not overlap with any listening window of active PSC called the unavailability interval. Therefore, in this paper, based on the IEEE 802. 16 e standard, we propose a dynamic <b>power</b> <b>saving</b> mechanism (DPSM) that increases unavailability interval when the MS is using two or more <b>power</b> <b>saving</b> classes (PSCs). The proposed mechanism adjusts sleep window of PSC I (III) to match the start point of listening window in PSC I (III) with that of listening window in PSC II. By doing so, the MS can reduce the listening time, and can increase the unavailability interval. Through analysis and simulation results, we show that the proposed DPSM can reduce the power consumption of MS with two or more PSCs considerably compared with conventional scheme.

40|$|Terminal paging is a {{procedure}} {{to locate a}} called mobile host (MH), which registered only approximated location information. The paging aims to reduce signalling overhead and power consumption in the MH. Recently, IP paging protocol has been widely designed for the terminal paging in IP-based mobile networks. However, since any power save mechanism is not supported in IP layer by itself, {{it is difficult to}} obtain the optimized power consumption effects. In other words, IP paging protocol should be cooperated with the power save mechanism supported in link layers. In this paper, we propose a new <b>power</b> <b>saving</b> mechanism in IEEE 802. 11 networks in order to efficiently integrate with IP paging protocol. Unlike the existing <b>power</b> <b>saving</b> mechanism, the proposed <b>power</b> <b>saving</b> mechanism adaptively adjusts the wake-up interval by estimating the future idle time of MH based on the previous patterns. In terms of performance evaluation, we formulated and compared the total cost, incurred in the IP paging protocol deployed over the <b>power</b> <b>saving</b> mechanism, when the existing scheme, the proposed scheme, and the optimum scheme are used. As a result, the proposed adaptive <b>power</b> <b>saving</b> mechanism is more close to the optimum solution than the current <b>power</b> <b>saving</b> mechanism...|$|R

DRX permits an idle UE to power off the radio receiver for two predefined sleep period and then wake up to receive the next paging message.
