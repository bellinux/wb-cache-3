5|$|On 13 August 1996 {{at around}} 10:30pm local time (UTC+7), Udin {{received}} two visitors outside {{his home in}} Bantul, off Parangtritis Road. The visitors claimed to want to leave a motorcycle with him for safekeeping, and reportedly had come the day before as well. While his wife Marsiyem was preparing tea, the men attacked him with a metal rod, striking {{him in the head}} and stomach. The assailants then escaped on a motorcycle they had <b>parked</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of his home. Marsiyem found Udin unconscious on the ground, bleeding from his ears.|$|E
5|$|Within 90 {{minutes of}} the explosion, McVeigh was stopped by Oklahoma Highway Patrolman Charlie Hanger for driving without a license plate and arrested for illegal weapons possession. Forensic {{evidence}} quickly linked McVeigh and Nichols to the attack; Nichols was arrested, and within days, both were charged. Michael and Lori Fortier were later identified as accomplices. McVeigh, {{a veteran of the}} Gulf War and a U.S. militia movement sympathizer, had detonated a Ryder rental truck full of explosives <b>parked</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the building. His co-conspirator, Nichols, had assisted with the bomb's preparation. Motivated by his dislike for the U.S. federal government and angry about its handling of the Ruby Ridge incident in 1992 and the Waco siege in 1993, McVeigh timed his attack to coincide with the second anniversary of the deadly fire that ended the siege at the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas.|$|E

25|$|Anticipating a press furore, it {{was decided}} to shoot the wedding in a church in private grounds where the press would not have access. However the press still turned up in large numbers, and {{security}} men had to be hired to keep cameramen away from the story action. Huge lorries were <b>parked</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the entrance to the church so that nothing could be seen, and the cast arrived in disguise. Finally strong lights were shone into the eyes of the journalists and photographers, making them extremely angry, and they constantly tried {{to gain access to the}} grounds by breaking the security barrier and telling the production team that they were really extras needed inside the church.|$|E
25|$|Peggy Bundy (Katey Sagal)—Al's {{wife who}} is always on his case about money and refuses to clean or cook. She is a lazy, big-haired redhead who spends {{most of her time}} <b>parked</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the TV {{watching}} talk shows such as Oprah or robbing Al blind to go shopping; a famously inattentive mother and nagging wife who uses every opportunity to humiliate Al about his job, his meager earnings, and even sexual abilities. Her big taste for things like clothes and male strippers have run Al into debt on numerous occasions. A recurring joke in the series is Al's regret of having married Peggy in the first place; the union was forced on him at shotgun-point. Peggy's best friend is Marcy, with whom she occasionally conspires against Al. Her family is a stereotypical backwoods clan of degenerates whom she often forces the other Bundys to endure, especially her morbidly obese mother whom Al finds intolerable.|$|E

500|$|The protest {{took place}} on 6 May 1991 in Split, {{organised}} by the Croatian Trade Union Association in Brodosplit Shipyard, in response to Tuđman's earlier statement. The protest started out with 10,000 shipyard workers, but ultimately drew approximately 100,000 people, from the shipyard and other factories in Split to a protest march through the city, carrying Croatian flags. The protest march grew in number as more citizens joined in, following radio broadcast messages calling for support. In order to prevent the [...] Yugoslav Navy from intervening using ships equipped with water cannons, Jadrolinija ships were used to obstruct access to the port. The protesters picketed around the Banovina building, which housed the command centres of the JNA Military-Maritime District and the Yugoslav Navy at the time. The protesters demanded lifting of the blockade of Kijevo, withdrawal of armoured personnel carriers <b>parked</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the Banovina building and hoisting of a Croatian flag on the building itself.|$|E
500|$|The song {{features}} a Motown sound-style [...] "telegraph key" [...] rhythm, which {{gave it the}} feeling of a pop song. This and the [...] "baby, baby" [...] refrain gave the song a throwaway quality that fit in with Achtung Babys mission of deconstructing U2's image. Paradoxically, the arrangement also featured U2's 1980s [...] "repeato-riff" [...] guitar style {{and the rest of the}} lyric was a serious love song that dealt with themes of anxiety and despair. [...] Bono has described [...] "Ultraviolet" [...] as [...] "an epic U2 song [...] the key of it left my voice in a conversational place and allowed a different kind of lyric writing." [...] Producer Eno wrote that a combination of opposites within each song was a signature characteristic of Achtung Baby and that as part of that, [...] "Ultraviolet" [...] had a [...] "helicopterish melancholy". [...] In Achtung Babys album package, [...] "Ultraviolet" [...] is presented next to a photograph of a crumbling Berlin building that has a Trabant <b>parked</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of it.|$|E
500|$|Lonsdale, never a Scientologist himself, became {{critical}} of the Church of Scientology in mid-2006, and often stood outside in downtown Clearwater near Scientology's spiritual headquarters wearing a sandwich board sign that read [...] "Cult Watch". Lonsdale became interested in Scientology after getting into a fight with a Scientologist over redevelopment issues while at a City Council meeting. After the Scientologist followed Lonsdale's car home and Lonsdale noticed a van <b>parked</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of his home for two hours the following day, he began to research the background of Scientology on anti-Scientology sites on the Internet and in the library. He taped hours of footage of Scientology staffers, security guards, and verbal confrontations with Scientologists, and edited clips into a pseudo-documentary which aired on local public-access television. Lonsdale dropped fliers outside downtown businesses and picked through trash from a Scientology-owned business and posted documents online. He parked outside a Scientology cafeteria with posters in his car window which stated that key Scientology texts were available for free on the Internet: [...] "OT I-VIII for free at xenu.net." ...|$|E

500|$|Just before Psychic...s release, {{and with}} new bassist Terence Smart in tow (the {{first of many}} through 1986), the band {{commenced}} their first nationwide tour. It was on this outing that they truly established a national presence, starting at Touch and Go's early headquarters in Detroit before heading to New York City, where they impressed members of Sonic Youth, as well as Shockabilly (and future Butthole Surfers) bassist Kramer. They then crisscrossed the country for several months, including a show in Seattle, that made a fan of future Soundgarden guitarist Kim Thayil. While in San Francisco {{at the end of}} the tour, and without a place to live, the band collectively decided to move to Winterville (a small town outside Athens, Georgia), where they admittedly made a hobby of stalking members of R.E.M.. They purportedly planned to leave a van <b>parked</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of Michael Stipe's house, with [...] "Michael Stipe/Despite the Hype/I Still Wanna Suck/Your Big Long Pipe" [...] painted on the side. Smart quit after falling in love with a friend of the band, and Trevor Malcolm, a young Canadian musician recommended by Touch and Go, replaced him on bass.|$|E
500|$|Mars {{had been}} filming the music video for [...] "Gorilla" [...] as he {{announced}} on his Twitter account, on October 2, 2013. He said [...] "Sorry i've been M.I.A, I was shooting a music video. #WinkWink #FRIKIKIKIKI #BangBang Wait {{till you see}} this". It was directed by Mars' himself and regular collaborator Cameron Duddy. On October 10, 2013 it was announced on Bruno Mars' official website, {{leading up to the}} release of the video, the unveil of teasers every day via Mars' Instagram account. The teasers included a car <b>parked</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of a strip club, a reptile, and an angry boss played by Luis Guzmán. Duddy along with Mars sought to create [...] "more than a standard strip-club video" [...] by researching and going into strip clubs to appreciate the architecture of the local. Nevertheless, the search for the ideal strip club was fruitless, so Mars and Duddy decided to build one: [...] "a joint that seemed like it was lifted straight out of Havana, dark and sweaty and seemingly untouched by time. They painted the walls themselves, and went back and forth on just what color neon they should use". When the time came to cast someone to play a stripper, the only name was Freida Pinto's one. However, Duddy had some doubts her choice, since he considered her [...] "safe". To this, Mars replied [...] "it's important to use someone who hasn't been seen in this light before". All in all, Duddy confessed that he trusted Mars instincts regarding Pinto's choice for the role. Duddy explained that some scenes recorded for the video were dangerous. Pinto could have harmed herself in the scene where [...] "she sheds her clothes among a sea of sparks", as well as Mars' guitar player [...] "He got dangerously close to having his head burned". Muriel Villera starts as one of the jealous strippers. The official music video was set to premiere on October 14, 2013. Nevertheless, its release was delayed one day by Mars himself stating [...] "I want it to be the best it can be. With that being said, I need one more day". The video, finally arrived on October 15, 2013 exclusively via Facebook.|$|E
