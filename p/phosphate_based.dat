40|$|Biodegradable {{materials}} are potentially an advantageous {{alternative to the}} traditional metallic fracture fixation devices used in the reconstruction of bone tissue defects. This {{is due to the}} occurrence of stress shielding in the surrounding bone tissue that arises from the absence of mechanical stimulus to the regenerating bone due to the mismatch between the elastic modulus of bone and the metal implant. However although degradable polymers may alleviate such issues, these inert materials possess insufficient mechanical properties to be considered as a suitable alternative to current metallic devices at sites of sufficient mechanical loading. <b>Phosphate</b> <b>based</b> glasses are an advantageous group of materials for tissue regenerative applications due to their ability to completely degrade in vivo at highly controllable rates based on the specific glass composition. Furthermore the release of the glass's constituent ions can evoke a therapeutic stimulus in vivo (i. e. osteoinduction) whilst also generating a bioactive response. The processing of these materials into fibres subsequently allows them to act as reinforcing agents in degradable polymers to simultaneously increase its mechanical properties and enhance its in vivo response. However despite the various review articles relating to the compositional influences of different phosphate glass systems, there has been limited work summarising the mechanical properties of different <b>phosphate</b> <b>based</b> glass fibres and their subsequent incorporation as a reinforcing agent in degradable composite materials.

40|$|Materials with disordered {{structures}} have {{a crucial}} role in the rapid development of new technologies. Improvement of these materials for particular application, as well as preparation of novel composites is based on a thorough understanding of the basic mechanisms of charge carrier transport. Among various classes of structurally disordered materials, a family of iron phosphate glasses attracts special attention due to their unique combination of structural, electrical and mechanical properties. Generally, iron phosphate glasses are electronically conducting glasses with polaronic conduction mechanism where conduction takes place by electrons hopping from Fe 2 + to Fe 3 +. Consequently, polaron transport directly depends on Fe 2 +/Fetot ratio and overall Fe 2 O 3 content. However, by altering composition (addition of Cr 2 O 3, MoO 3, PbO, Na 2 O) and preparation conditions, the electrical conductivity of iron <b>phosphate</b> <b>based</b> glasses may vary over many orders of magnitude.
