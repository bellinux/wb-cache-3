25|$|The Hopton Incline {{was a very}} steep {{section of}} the railway about a mile north of the small village of Hopton. It was {{originally}} worked by a stationary steam engine but was modified later to be adhesion worked by locomotives.

500|$|Stowe recounts several sailing trips {{she takes}} on the St. Johns and Julington Creek and the animals she sees during her excursion, appreciating the alligators, [...] "water-turkeys" [...] (Anhinga anhinga), and [...] "fish-hawks", or ospreys (Pandion haliaetus). Long an animal lover, she took her dogs, cats, and birds with her {{as part of the}} [...] "earthquake" [...] of the annual {{relocation}} from Hartford to Mandarin. She extended this care to other animals as well. In Naples, Italy, she once got out of a carriage to walk as it was being <b>pulled</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> steep hill by two beleaguered horses that were being whipped by the driver, and asked her companions and guide to do the same. Not only did she write the first travel guide to Florida, but Stowe also became the first defender of wild animals. She pays particular attention in Palmetto Leaves to hunters who shoot at anything they see. Not taking offense at hunting for the sake of eating, Stowe laments killing for its own sake: [...] "it must be something that enjoys and can suffer; something that loves life, and must lose it". In 1877 she followed her book with a pamphlet that urged the cessation of the slaughter of Florida's wading birds, whose feathers were selling at the price of gold and used in women's hats.|$|E

[...] Nevertheless the wine-growers' unions have succeeded at many levels in keeping production at full capacity. [...] In the Touraine area, however, {{there is no such}} flurry of activity. [...] In his report to the General Council of the department of Indre-et-Loire, the Prefet (official in charge of a French department) does not even mention the situation. [...] The general reaction is one of complete indifference. The local temperament militates against any attempt to take effective action, {{and at the same time}} political animosities are distracting everyone from the true problems of this region. However, the Touraine wine-growing area has already lost many vines and there are frequent cases of vines being <b>pulled</b> <b>up.</b> <b>A</b> vast fortune is disappearing".|$|E
