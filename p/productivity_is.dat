5|$|Ovine {{obstetrics}} can be problematic. By selectively breeding ewes {{that produce}} multiple offspring with higher birth weights for generations, sheep producers have inadvertently caused some domestic sheep to have difficulty lambing; balancing ease of lambing with high <b>productivity</b> <b>is</b> {{one of the}} dilemmas of sheep breeding. In the case of any such problems, those present at lambing may assist the ewe by extracting or repositioning lambs. After the birth, ewes ideally break the amniotic sac (if it is not broken during labor), and begin licking clean the lamb. Most lambs will begin standing {{within an hour of}} birth. In normal situations, lambs nurse after standing, receiving vital colostrum milk. Lambs that either fail to nurse or are rejected by the ewe require help to survive, such as bottle-feeding or fostering by another ewe.|$|E
5|$|The {{fact that}} it is a seaside city has shaped Póvoa de Varzim's economy: the fishing {{industry}}, from the fishing vessels that put in each day to the canning industry and to the city's fish market, beach agriculture, and seaweed-gathering for fertilizing fields are the result of its geography. Tourism and the related industries are more relevant in Póvoa's economy these days, as fisheries have lost importance. Nevertheless, the mean value of fish landed in 2004, in its seaport, was almost three times that of Matosinhos seaport and significantly higher in the average vessels' capacity. Its fishing <b>productivity</b> <b>is</b> also comparatively higher than the national average. A Poveira is a traditional Povoan canning factory and most of its production, 80 to 85%, is exported and deals with high-end brands in canned fish, for MDC markets. Export market brands include: Poveira, D'Henry IV, Ala-Arriba, Minerva, and Alva.|$|E
5|$|Ovine {{obstetrics}} can be problematic. By selectively breeding ewes {{that produce}} multiple offspring with higher birth weights for generations, sheep producers have inadvertently caused some domestic sheep to have difficulty lambing. However, it {{is a myth}} that sheep cannot lamb without human assistance; many ewes give birth directly in pasture without aid. This can be proven {{by the fact that}} they give birth in the wild. Balancing ease of lambing with high <b>productivity</b> <b>is</b> one of the dilemmas of sheep breeding. While the majority of births are relatively normal and do not require intervention, many complications may arise. A lamb may present in the normal fashion (with both legs and head forward), but may simply be too large to slide out of the birth canal. This often happens when large rams are crossed with diminutive ewes (this is related to breed, rams are naturally larger than ewes by comparison). Lambs may also present themselves with one shoulder to the side, completely backward, or with only some of their limbs protruding. Lambs may also be spontaneously aborted or stillborn. Reproductive failure is a common consequence of infections such as toxoplasmosis and foot-and-mouth disease. Some types of abortion in sheep are preventable by vaccinations against these infections.|$|E

Periphyton chlorophyll a was significantly greater in the outlet region than in the intake region. Nevertheless, periphyton <b>productivity</b> <b>was</b> negatively correlated with water temperature in the outlet region. A distinct difference in periphyton community composition was also detected between the two regions. Chlorination experiments showed that a chlorine concentration of 0. 2 ppm greatly suppressed phytoplankton productivity, {{regardless of whether the}} water temperature was elevated or not. periphyton <b>productivity</b> <b>was</b> little influenced by a chlorine concentration of < 0. 5 ppm.

30|$|Moreover, {{the largest}} {{potential}} improvements in <b>productivity</b> <b>are</b> typically in the nontradables sector, where demand is relatively inelastic, so {{an increase in}} <b>productivity</b> there <b>is</b> likely to decrease employment in the short run. In the tradables sector, where the demand is more elastic, increases in <b>productivity</b> <b>are</b> more {{likely to lead to}} an increase in employment; but because firms in this sector face greater competition in the first place, there is typically less room for large productivity gains.|$|R
25|$|This {{assumption}} {{means that}} producing the same output of either commodity {{could be done}} with the same level of capital and labour in either country. Actually, it would be inefficient to use the same balance in either country (because of the relative availability of either input factor) but, in principle this would be possible. Another way of saying this is that the per-capita <b>productivity</b> <b>is</b> the same in both countries in the same technology with identical amounts of capital.|$|E
25|$|Coral reefs cover {{less than}} 0.1% {{of the surface}} of the world’s ocean, about half the land area of France, yet they support over one-quarter of all marine species. This {{diversity}} results in complex food webs, with large predator fish eating smaller forage fish that eat yet smaller zooplankton and so on. However, all food webs eventually depend on plants, which are the primary producers. Coral reefs' primary <b>productivity</b> <b>is</b> very high, typically producing 5–10 grams of carbon per square meter per day (gC·m−2·day−1) biomass.|$|E
25|$|Egypt's fertile area totals about 3.3 million {{hectares}} (8.1 million acres), {{about one-quarter of}} which is land reclaimed from the desert. However, the reclaimed lands only add 7 percent to {{the total value of}} agricultural production. Even though only 3 percent of the land is arable, it is extremely productive and can be cropped two or even three times annually. Most land is cropped at least twice a year, but agricultural <b>productivity</b> <b>is</b> limited by salinity (which afflicts an estimated 35% of cultivated land) and drainage issues.|$|E

25|$|Land transformation, {{the use of}} land {{to yield}} goods and services, is the most {{substantial}} way humans alter the Earth's ecosystems, and is considered the driving force {{in the loss of}} biodiversity. Estimates of the amount of land transformed by humans vary from 39 to 50%. Land degradation, the long-term decline in ecosystem function and <b>productivity,</b> <b>is</b> estimated to be occurring on 24% of land worldwide, with cropland overrepresented. The UN-FAO report cites land management as the driving factor behind degradation and reports that 1.5 billion people rely upon the degrading land. Degradation can be deforestation, desertification, soil erosion, mineral depletion, or chemical degradation (acidification and salinization).|$|E
25|$|<b>Productivity</b> <b>is</b> a {{standard}} efficiency metric {{for evaluation of}} production systems, broadly speaking a ratio between outputs and inputs, and can assume many specific forms, for example: machine productivity, workforce productivity, raw material productivity, warehouse productivity (=inventory turnover). It is also useful to break up productivity in use U (productive percentage of total time) and yield η (ratio between produced volume and productive time) to better evaluate production systems performances. Cycle times can be modeled through manufacturing engineering if the individual operations are heavily automated, if the manual component is the prevalent one, methods used include: time and motion study, predetermined motion time systems and work sampling.|$|E

25|$|Climate is a {{key factor}} that has been studied in the colony {{productivity}} of P. snelleni. Since there is always one founding queen in a P. snelleni nest, the denominator of colony <b>productivity</b> <b>is</b> always one. Productivity was found to vary drastically {{with a couple of}} very large nests that were found in Kanto, Japan. These nests had hundreds of cells in comparison to the usually 100 cells. In these nests, there was a female-biased sex ratio, which lines up with the resource availability hypothesis. This hypothesis states that colonies with better resources should be more heavily female based. The numbers of first brood workers in these nests were not greater than other nests, but there were a lot more females, so the sex ratio was heavily female.|$|E
25|$|There are no updated {{and precise}} figures for labor productivity, {{measured}} in employees per 1,000 connections. However, the Ministry of Water and Power indicated a {{poor performance in}} the country's major cities. The ADB found an average of 5.6 employees per 1,000 connections in Karachi. In Lahore and Rawalpindi, labor <b>productivity</b> <b>is</b> indicated lower at 9.5 and 12.7 employees per 1,000 connections, respectively. At the 2005 workshop, between 6 and 27 employees per 1,000 connections in major cities were reported (see table 3). Tynan and Kingdom propose a best practice target of 5 employees per 1,000 connections in developing countries. However it should be mentioned that equally to NRW, this target is a suggestion of the authors, which is not established as official best practice target among professionals.|$|E
25|$|This {{decline in}} <b>productivity</b> <b>is</b> {{essentially}} {{due to the}} redirection of the pelagic network to a benthic chain by this one species. Because the Amur River clam feeds on primary producers, consumers and predators, it impacts multiple trophic levels. Consequently, nearly all plankton exhibit signs of apparent competition, in that production at one trophic level impacts all others by increasing clam abundance. This results in a negative feedback loop: C. amurensis limits plankton biomass, which in turn limits C. amurensis. However, inputs from outside the system due to tidal advection or upstream sources may increase C. amurensis biomass, further driving plankton limitation. This feedback loop is further amplified because the clam may persist {{for more than one}} or two years, which puts added pressure on plankton populations during cycles of low productivity.|$|E

40|$|Theory {{grounding}} {{is suggested}} {{as a way}} to address the unresolved cognitive science issues of systematicity and productivity. Theory grounding involves grounding the theory skills and knowledge of an embodied artificially intelligent (AI) system by developing theory skills and knowledge from the bottom up. It is proposed that theory grounded AI systems should be patterned after the psychological developmental stages that infants and young children go through in acquiring naïve theories. Systematicity and <b>productivity</b> <b>are</b> properties of certain representational systems indicating the range of representations the systems can form. Systematicity and <b>productivity</b> <b>are</b> likely outcomes of theory grounded AI systems because systematicity and <b>productivity</b> <b>are</b> theoretical concepts.

25|$|Phytoplankton {{accumulation}} {{is primarily}} {{the result of}} residence time. The north Delta and Suisun Bay have relatively low residence times due to the high volume of water moving through the region for downstream flow and for export to southern California. Since water moves more rapidly through {{this part of the}} system, the rate of accumulation decreases as <b>productivity</b> <b>is</b> advected out of the system. In contrast, parts of the southern Delta have a higher residence time due to the low volume of water moving through the system; in fact the water on occasion runs backwards, {{due to the lack of}} inflow from the San Joaquin River, and export pumping. During summer, phytoplankton density may be an order of magnitude higher here than in other parts of the estuary.|$|E
25|$|Meltwater around Greenland may {{transport}} {{nutrients in}} both dissolved and particulate phases to the ocean. Measurements {{of the amount}} of iron in meltwater from the Greenland ice sheet show that extensive melting of the ice sheet might add an amount of this micronutrient to the Atlantic Ocean equivalent to that added by airborne dust. However much of the particles and iron derived from glaciers around Greenland may be trapped within the extensive fjords that surround the island and, unlike the HNLC Southern ocean where iron is an extensive limiting micronutrient, biological production in the North Atlantic is subject only to very spatially and temporally limited periods of iron limitation. Nonetheless high <b>productivity</b> <b>is</b> observed in the immediate vicinity of major marine terminating glaciers around Greenland and this is attributed to meltwater inputs driving the upwelling of seawater rich in macronutrients.|$|E
25|$|The {{conversion}} of marshland to upland for agriculture {{has in the}} past century been overshadowed by conversion for urban development. Coastal cities worldwide have encroached onto former salt marshes and in the U.S. the growth of cities looked to salt marshes for waste disposal sites. Estuarine pollution from organic, inorganic, and toxic substances from urban development or industrialisation is a worldwide problem and the sediment in salt marshes may entrain this pollution with toxic effects on floral and faunal species. Urban development of salt marshes has slowed since about 1970 owing to growing awareness by environmental groups that they provide beneficial ecosystem services. They are highly productive ecosystems, and when net <b>productivity</b> <b>is</b> measured in g m−2 yr−1 they are equalled only by tropical rainforests. Additionally, they can help reduce wave erosion on sea walls designed to protect low-lying areas of land from wave erosion.|$|E
