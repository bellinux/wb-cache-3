500|$|After the Dutch relinquished all {{of their}} {{possessions}} in the Indies in 1962, the Indonesian government began mobilizing the mass media {{in its efforts to}} build a unified nation. President Sukarno released an executive decree which reorganized Antara as the National News Agency Institute ( [...] , or LKBN) under increased government control. Within three weeks of its reorganization on 24 September, Antara merged with three other existing news agencies: the Indonesian Press Bureau (PIA), the Asian <b>Press</b> <b>Board</b> (APB), and the Indonesian National Press and Publicity Service (INPS).|$|E
500|$|Many {{studies have}} been made {{pertaining}} to the legal aspects of the [...] "Langit Makin Mendung" [...] case. One opinion is that the prosecution office had no legal basis for acting as both judge and literary critic in the case, with the blasphemy laws used in prosecution not being at least government or parliamentary level. The banning of Sastra is criticized for having no legal basis, as laws pertaining to the banning of print media at the time only applied to foreign publications; per the then-applicable Press Laws, any banning of a magazine would require approval of the <b>Press</b> <b>Board.</b> The need for freedom of speech is also mentioned.|$|E

30|$|When air was injected, the {{temperature}} of the middle layer was higher at the pressing temperature of 210 °C than at 190 °C. The internal bond strength of the <b>boards</b> <b>pressed</b> at 210 °C was higher than that of the <b>boards</b> <b>pressed</b> at 190 °C. A big difference in internal bond strength was observed between them. For example, the internal bond strengths of the <b>boards</b> <b>pressed</b> at 210 and 190 °C for 8  min were 0.60 and 0.43  MPa, respectively. When the pressing temperature was raised to 230 °C, {{the temperature}} of the middle layer was higher than that of the <b>boards</b> <b>pressed</b> at 210 °C, but the internal bond strength did not increase.
