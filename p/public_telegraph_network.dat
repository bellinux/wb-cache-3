50|$|GIC {{were first}} {{observed}} on the emerging electric <b>telegraph</b> <b>network</b> in 1847-8 during Solar cycle 9. Technological {{change and the}} growth of conducting networks have made the significance of GIC greater in modern society. The technical considerations for undersea cables, telephone and <b>telegraph</b> <b>networks</b> and railways are similar. Fewer problems {{have been reported in the}} open literature, about these systems. This suggests that the hazard is less today, or that there are reliable methods of equipment protection.|$|R
50|$|In 1846, Steinheil {{travelled}} to Naples {{to install}} a new system for weight and measure units. Three years later, he {{was appointed to the}} Board of Telegraphy of the Austrian Trade Ministry. Steinheil was tasked with designing a <b>telegraph</b> <b>network</b> for the entire empire, and helped to form the Deutsch-Österreichischer Telegraphenverein (German-Austrian Telegraph Society). In 1851, he started the Swiss <b>telegraph</b> <b>network.</b> Steinheil returned Munich as konservator (curator) of the mathematical-physical collections and ministerial secretary in the Trade Ministry of Bavaria.|$|R

25|$|The Grove cell {{was invented}} by Welshman William Robert Grove in 1839. It {{consisted}} of a zinc anode dipped in sulfuric acid and a platinum cathode dipped in nitric acid, separated by porous earthenware. The Grove cell provided a high current and nearly twice the voltage of the Daniell cell, which made it the favoured cell of the American <b>telegraph</b> <b>networks</b> for a time. However, it gave off poisonous nitric oxide fumes when operated. The voltage also dropped sharply as the charge diminished, which became a liability as <b>telegraph</b> <b>networks</b> grew more complex. Platinum was also very expensive.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{widely used}} service for wire {{transfers}} was launched by Western Union in 1872 on its existing <b>telegraph</b> <b>network.</b> Using passwords and code books, a telegraph operator in one office could [...] "wire" [...] money {{that had been}} paid to that office by the sending customer to another telegraph office to be paid out to the receiving customer. By 1877 the service was used to transfer almost $2.5 million each year. Because the earliest wire transfers were using <b>telegraph</b> <b>networks,</b> it was termed telegraphic transfer and this name is still used in some countries, although more advanced electronic transfer networks are used.|$|R

40|$|The Body of Telegraphists ("Cuerpo de Telegrafos", in Spanish) was {{established}} in Spain in 1856 in order to operate the electric telegraph service and later to develop a national-wide <b>telegraph</b> <b>network.</b> The origins of this professional body {{and the way it}} was formed with people from the optical telegraphy field of activity will be described. It will also be explained how these people were educated in techniques and methods related to electrical telegraphy. In addition, it will be described how the creation of the Body of Telegraphists caused a conflict with the Body of Civil Engineers, which was the responsible {{for the development of the}} optical <b>telegraph</b> <b>network...</b>|$|R
50|$|Once the {{telegraph}} reached Bathurst from Sydney in 1859 {{the need to}} expand the lines from Bathurst to other western towns was obvious to civic leaders. The <b>telegraph</b> <b>network</b> rapidly expanded from Bathurst to the following towns.|$|R
50|$|In the 19th- and 20th-centuries, Carcavelos was an {{important}} landing point in the international <b>telegraph</b> <b>network,</b> providing crucial communication links for the British Empire: most of the links were run by forerunners of the Cable & Wireless company.|$|R
5000|$|Postal Telegraph Company (Postal Telegraph & Cable Corporation) {{was a major}} {{operator}} of <b>telegraph</b> <b>networks</b> in the United States prior to its consolidation with Western Union in 1943. [...] Postal partnered with Commercial Cable Company for overseas cable messaging.|$|R
50|$|At {{the same}} time as Chappe, the Swedish {{inventor}} Abraham Niclas Edelcrantz experimented with the optical telegraph in Sweden. In 1794 he inaugurated his telegraph with a poem dedicated to the Swedish King on his birthday. The message went from the Palace in Stockholm to the King at Drottningholm. Edelcrantz eventually developed his own system which was quite different from its French counterpart and nearly twice as fast. The system was based on ten collapsible iron shutters. The various positions of the shutters formed combinations of numbers which were translated into letters, words or phrases via codebooks. The <b>telegraph</b> <b>network</b> consisted of <b>telegraph</b> stations positioned at about 10 km from one another.Soon telegraph circuits linking castles and fortresses in the neighbourhood of Stockholm were set up and the system was extended to Grisslehamn and Åland. Subsequently, telegraph circuits were introduced between Gothenburg and Marstrand, at Helsingborg and between Karlskrona and its fortresses. Sweden was the second country in the world, after France, to introduce an optical <b>telegraph</b> <b>network.</b> The Swedish optical <b>telegraph</b> <b>network</b> was restricted to the archipelagoes of Stockholm, Gothenburg and Karlskrona. Like its French counterpart, it was mainly used for military purposes.|$|R
50|$|In United States {{military}} communications systems, commercial refile {{refers to}} sending a military message via a commercial communications network. The message {{may come from}} a military network, such as a tape relay <b>network,</b> a point-to-point <b>telegraph</b> <b>network,</b> a radio-telegraph network, or the Defense Switched Network.|$|R
50|$|The key {{infrastructure}} {{developments that}} allowed Bathurst to grow were the road system, gas supply, <b>telegraph</b> <b>network,</b> railways, telephone, electricity, and water systems. Each {{one of these}} created an improvement in living conditions and productivity for the residents and {{the economy as a}} whole.|$|R
5000|$|The {{development}} of the electric telegraph, which often travelled along railroad lines, enabled news to travel faster, over longer distances. (Days before Morse's Baltimore-Washington line transmitted the famous question, [...] "What hath God wrought?", it transmitted the news that Henry Clay and Theodore Frelinghuysen had been chosen by the Whig nominating party.) <b>Telegraph</b> <b>networks</b> enabled a new centralization of the news, {{in the hands of}} wire services concentrated in major cities. The modern form of these originated with Charles-Louis Havas, who founded Bureau Havas (later Agence France Press) in Paris. Havas began in 1832, using the French government's optical <b>telegraph</b> <b>network.</b> In 1840 he began using pigeons for communications to Paris, London, and Brussels. Havas began to use the electric telegraph when it became available.|$|R
50|$|He was, with Charles Wheatstone, the {{co-inventor}} of the Cooke-Wheatstone electrical telegraph, {{which was}} patented in May 1837. Together with John Lewis Ricardo {{he founded the}} Electric Telegraph Company, the world's first <b>public</b> <b>telegraph</b> company, in 1846. He was knighted in 1869.|$|R
25|$|Four {{telecommunication}} companies provide {{local and}} international direct distance dialing and fax services. Inter island communications is available through the government's <b>telegraph</b> <b>network</b> and the Provincial Radio Communication System. In addition, there are 19 post offices, a number of cargo forwarders provide air parcel and freight services.|$|R
50|$|Government-operated {{post office}} and <b>telegraph</b> <b>networks</b> - the largest parts of the {{bureaucracy}} - were combined into a single department in each colony {{on the model of}} the UK Post Office: South Australia in 1869, Victoria in 1870, Queensland in 1880 and New South Wales in 1893.|$|R
25|$|On 16 May 1843 the Paddington-to-Slough <b>telegraph</b> went <b>public,</b> {{becoming}} Britain's first <b>public</b> <b>telegraph</b> service. Despite {{being something}} of a publicity stunt for Cooke, it became very popular, and HM Government were frequently using it for communication with the royal household at Windsor Castle nearby.|$|R
50|$|David Ames Wells (1890), who was {{a leading}} {{authority}} {{on the effects of}} technology on the economy in the late 19th century, gave many examples of creative destruction (without using the term) brought about by improvements in steam engine efficiency, shipping, the international <b>telegraph</b> <b>network,</b> and agricultural mechanization.|$|R
50|$|The first {{successful}} transatlantic telegraph cable was completed on 27 July 1866, allowing transatlantic telegraph communications {{for the first}} time. Within 29 years of its first installation at Euston Station, the <b>telegraph</b> <b>network</b> crossed the oceans to every continent but Antarctica, making instant global communication possible for the first time.|$|R
50|$|The {{construction}} of the world-wide <b>telegraph</b> <b>network</b> {{in the late nineteenth}} century was closely tied to colonialism as the European powers used the telegraph to govern and communicate with their overseas possessions. By the 1870s, a network of land lines and submarine communications cables had telegraphically connected all the inhabited continents.|$|R
