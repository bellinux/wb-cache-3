40|$|Intramembranous tympanic {{membrane}} cholesterol granuloma (CG) occurs infrequently. Here, the authors report {{a case of}} CG in the {{tympanic membrane}} presenting as a blue eardrum in the right ear. In addition, a <b>pinhole</b> <b>perforation</b> noted in the anterosuperior area revealed a brown discharge. High-resolution temporal bone CT showed a bulging mass shadow in the middle ear and a soft tissue dense lesion that filled both the epitympanum and mastoid cavity. Tympanomastoidectomy was performed under general anesthesia. New bone formation was confirmed in the mastoid antrum and epitympanum, and the epitympanum was blocked by new bone. The tympanic membrane revealed a round, brownish mass with a glistening surface and a severely thickened pars tensa. We herein report this case and review pertinent medical literature...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY This {{case report}} {{supports}} {{the belief that}} there is a causal relationship between therapeutic radiation and subsequent bowel malignancy. Case report A woman, aged 42 years, with a stage III squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix was treated with internal and external cobalt 60 irradiation for 45 days. The combined dose to the cervix (point A) was 72 Gy (7200 rad) and to areas 5 cm from the cervix (point B) 52. 8 Gy (5280 rad). She remained well for six years, when she developed painless haematuria and clot retention. After an intravenous urogram and cysto-scopy, radiation cystitis was diagnosed and the bleeding was attributed to areas of telangiectasia. The bleeding stopped spontacneously. Fourteen years after treatment, she remained free of recurrent disease and was discharged from outpatient care. Twenty years after radiation therapy, aged 62 years, she was admitted to hospital with intestinal obstruction. At operation the sigmoid colon, upper rectum, caecum and terminal ileum were thickened and adherent to surrounding structures and this was thought to be caused by radiation exposure. The terminal ileum was strictured. There was a <b>pinhole</b> <b>perforation</b> on the anterior wall of the grossly distended caecum. The large bowel was obstructed at the rectosigmoid junction where a small mobile mass was noted. In view of the patient's poor general condition, a tube caecostomy was fashioned through the caecal perforation and a loop ileostomy raised proximal to the ileal stricture...|$|E
40|$|Cholesterol {{granuloma}} (CG) of {{the middle}} ear typically presents as a conductive hearing loss and a blue eardrum, whereas those at the petrous apex either manifest as the side effects of bony erosion (with sensorineural hearing loss, tinnitus, vertigo, or cranial nerve impairment), or are incidentally identified. 1 CG can be a perfectly localized and isolated mass in any pneumatized area in temporal bone, the middle ear cavity, 2, 3 mastoid antrum, 4 external auditory canal, 5 or the petrous apex, 1 as has been found in as many as 12 - 20 % of temporal bones with chronic otitis media. 2 - 4 According to a histopathologic study, CG may be present in 12 % of patients with chronic otitis media with an intact tympanic membranes, and in 21 % of those with a perforated tympanic membrane. 6 However, intramembranous tympanic membrane CG occurs less frequently, and only one case has so far been reported in the English literature. 7 Here, we report our experiences with a case of CG in the tympanic membrane and review relevant medical literature. A 42 -year-old man presented with a history of childhood coalescent otitis media and, as consequent, hearing loss in the right ear. He complained of middle ear fullness without otalgia. A blue eardrum was identified at the local clinic. The patient was referred to our department. Otomicroscopic findings of the right tympanic membrane demonstrated a bulging blue eardrum. Two weeks after presentation, otomicroscopic findings showed a <b>pinhole</b> <b>perforation</b> in the anterior area with a brown discharge. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Introduction Jejunal diverticula {{are rare}} {{and are usually}} asymptomatic. However, they may cause chronic {{non-specific}} symptoms or rarely lead to an acute presentation. Case presentation We report {{the case of an}} 82 -year-old Caucasian woman presenting with a one-day history of generalized abdominal pain, with three episodes of vomiting. An abdominal X-ray displayed multiple dilated loops of the small bowel. A subsequent computed tomography scan of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a thickening of the duodenum and dilatation of the proximal jejunum. Multiple small bowel diverticula were identified with surrounding pockets of free air adjacent to the jejunal diverticula suggestive of a small bowel perforation. Our patient underwent a laparotomy, which identified multiple jejunal diverticula with two <b>pinhole</b> jejunal <b>perforations</b> and associated fecal contamination. The perforations were repaired with primary closure and extensive washout was performed. Conclusion Jejunal diverticulosis in the elderly can lead to significant morbidity and mortality and so should be suspected in those presenting with crampy abdominal pain and altered bowel habits. </p...|$|R
50|$|Pinhole glasses, {{also known}} as stenopeic glasses, are {{eyeglasses}} {{with a series of}} pinhole-sized perforations filling an opaque sheet of plastic in place of each lens. Similar to the workings of a <b>pinhole</b> camera, each <b>perforation</b> allows only a very narrow beam of light to enter the eye which reduces the size of the circle of confusion on the retina and increases depth of field. In eyes with refractive error, the result is often a sharper image. However, a second effect may appear at the common bridge between each two adjacent holes, whereby two different rays of light coming from the same object (but each passing through a different hole) are diffracted back toward the eye and onto different places on the retina. This leads to double vision (objects having doubled edges) around the rim of each hole the eye is not focussing on, which can make the overall image disturbing and tiring to look at for prolonged periods of time.|$|R
