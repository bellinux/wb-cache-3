This characterization is achieved by discussing the adoption of environmental management practices and considering aspects of the productive <b>process</b> <b>stage.</b> An eight-case study was conducted through data triangulation using interviews with employees in diverse organizational areas, direct observations and secondary data. The results indicate the differences in environmental positioning among the studied corporations with a predominance of preventive practices, i. e., an emphasis on eco-efficiency and compliance with legislation. It was also noted that environmental concerns in the corporations are related to internationalization and, in some cases, to the pressure exerted by corporations that represent the brand of the products produced in Brazil. Moreover, the adoption of environmental practices based on the productive <b>process</b> <b>stage</b> supported the environmental maturity classifications of the studied companies...|$|R

This understanding is then used to form ten characterisations of engineer behaviour within late-stage design, early-stage design, and throughout the design process.

In addition, it reaffirms that there are critical common factors affecting the whole partnering process and critical functional factors influencing individual <b>process</b> <b>stages.</b> Specifically, the four critical common factors are top management support, open communication, effective coordination, and mutual trust. Also, the critical functional factors at the stage of partnering formation are team building, facilitator, and partnering agreement; those of partnering application are joint problem solving, adequate resources, and partnering goals' achievement; those of partnering reactivation (or strategic partnering) are partnering experience, continuous improvement, learning climate, and long-term commitment.
