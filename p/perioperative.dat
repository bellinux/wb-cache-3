25|$|Surgical resections of {{infected}} lungs were rarely attempted during the 1930s and 1940s, {{due to the}} extremely high <b>perioperative</b> mortality rate.|$|E
25|$|A {{fentanyl}} patient-controlled {{transdermal system}} (PCTS) is under development, {{which aims to}} allow patients to control administration of fentanyl through the skin during the treatment of <b>perioperative</b> pain.|$|E
25|$|The CSPS {{promotes}} {{excellence in}} patient {{safety in the}} surgical and <b>perioperative</b> environment and works {{to ensure that all}} patients receive the safest surgical care provided by an integrated team of dedicated professionals. The CSPS values a culture of patient safety and a caring workplace environment.|$|E
25|$|The use of {{vasopressin}} is contraindicated in {{the presence}} of hypersentivity to beef or pork proteins, increased BUN and chronic renal failure. It recommended that it be cautiously used in instances of <b>perioperative</b> polyuria, sensitivity to the drug, asthma, seizures, heart failure, a comatose state, migraine headaches, and cardiovascular disease.|$|E
25|$|A nephrologist is a {{physician}} who specializes in the care and treatment of kidney disease. Nephrology requires additional training to become an expert with advanced skills. Nephrologists may provide care to people without kidney problems and may work in general/internal medicine, transplant medicine, immunosuppression management, intensive care medicine, clinical pharmacology, <b>perioperative</b> medicine, or pediatric nephrology.|$|E
25|$|Patients with cardiothoracic {{pathology}} who {{present for}} non-cardiothoracic surgery are {{at increased risk}} for serious <b>perioperative</b> complications. Cardiothoracic anesthesiologists are often consulted by their colleagues to provide expert management during intraoperative hemodynamic instability or cardiac arrest by evaluating heart function with the aid of TEE and placement of other invasive advanced hemodynamic monitors, such as pacing swans.|$|E
25|$|Fast {{recognition}} {{and treatment of}} MH utilizes skills and procedures that are utilized with a low-frequency and high-risk. Conducting MH crisis training for <b>perioperative</b> teams can identify system failures as well as improve response to these events. Simulation techniques to {{include the use of}} cognitive aids have also been shown to improve communication in clinical treatment of MH.|$|E
25|$|Anesthesiology (also {{known as}} anaesthetics): {{concerned}} with the <b>perioperative</b> management of the surgical patient. The anesthesiologist's role during surgery is to prevent derangement in the vital organs' (i.e. brain, heart, kidneys) functions and postoperative pain. Outside of the operating room, the anesthesiology physician also serves the same function in the labor & delivery ward, and some are specialized in critical medicine.|$|E
25|$|Anticoagulation bridge: Temporary anticoagulation, such as with heparin, is {{used during}} a <b>perioperative</b> period when a patient's regular {{anticoagulant}} therapy, such as with warfarin, is suspended; {{the goal is}} to prevent excess risk of severe bleeding during or after surgery. The heparin bridge provides some anticoagulant effect (to prevent thrombosis from warfarin withdrawal) {{but not as much as}} would make severe bleeding likely.|$|E
25|$|It {{deals with}} the {{anesthesia}} aspects of care related to surgical cases such as open heart surgery, lung surgery, and other operations of the human chest. These aspects include <b>perioperative</b> care with expert manipulation of patient cardiopulmonary physiology through precise and advanced application of pharmacology, resuscitative techniques, critical care medicine, and invasive procedures. This also includes management of the cardiopulmonary bypass (heart-lung) machine, which most cardiac procedures require intraoperatively while the heart undergoes surgical correction.|$|E
25|$|It {{is unclear}} if {{laparoscopy}} or laparotomy is {{better or worse}} for FIGO stage I ovarian cancer. There is also no apparent difference between total abdominal hysterectomy and supracervical hysterectomy for advanced cancers. Approximately 2.8% of people having a first surgery for advanced ovarian cancer die within {{two weeks of the}} surgery (2.8% <b>perioperative</b> mortality rate). More aggressive surgeries are associated with better outcomes in advanced (stage III or IV) ovarian cancer.|$|E
25|$|Fellows {{are trained}} to provide <b>perioperative</b> {{anesthetic}} management for patients with severe cardiopulmonary pathology. Some of the cardiac surgeries they train for include the following: coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) both on cardiopulmonary bypass {{as well as on}} a beating heart, heart valve surgery, aortic reconstruction requiring deep hypothermic arrest, mechanical ventricular assist device (VAD) placement, thoracic aortic aneurysm repair, aortic dissection repair, heart transplants, lung transplants, heart/lung transplants, and adult congenital heart surgery.|$|E
25|$|Anesthesiology {{residency}} {{training in}} the U.S. encompasses the full scope of <b>perioperative</b> medicine, including pre-operative medical evaluation, management of pre-existing disease in the surgical patient, intraoperative life support, intraoperative pain control, post-operative recovery, intensive care medicine, and chronic and acute pain management. After residency, many anesthesiologists complete an additional fellowship year of sub-specialty training {{in areas such as}} pain management, sleep medicine, cardiothoracic anesthesiology, pediatric anesthesiology, neuroanesthesiology, regional anesthesiology/ambulatory anesthesiology, obstetric anesthesiology, or critical care medicine.|$|E
25|$|Early {{experience}} with the Sugiura procedure demonstrated, following the procedures, the overall operative mortality was 32% and overall morbidity occurred in 33% of the patients. Significant causes {{of morbidity and mortality}} were related to complications of the esophageal transection as anastomotic leakage occurred in 8.6% of patients undergoing emergent surgery versus 4.8% in elective cases. All patients who developed an esophageal leak died. For this reason, modification of the original procedure was introduced to avoid the risk of <b>perioperative</b> mortality due to esophageal transection.|$|E
25|$|Personalized {{tourniquet}} instruments have digital {{displays and}} easy-to-use user interfaces. Typically, the tourniquet instrument allows the <b>perioperative</b> staff {{to set the}} tourniquet pressure, inflate or deflate the tourniquet cuff, and adjust safety settings such as the maximum allowed pressure and time limits. The digital display and control buttons give the surgical staff a straightforward method of monitoring the tourniquet pressure and time, and for changing the various tourniquet settings. Personalized tourniquet instruments have non-volatile memory to enable surgical staff to store specialized settings most appropriate for certain surgeries (e.g. paediatric and hand surgery), relevant data about significant surgical events related to tourniquet usage, and to enable a data printout or transfer to an operating room information network. In addition, personalized tourniquet instruments use intuitive audio-visual alarms to alert the surgical staff of events related to patient safety.|$|E
25|$|While PSA testing {{may help}} 1000 in 1,000,000 avoid death due to {{prostate}} cancer, 4000 to 5000 in 1,000,000 would die from prostate cancer after 10 years even with screening. This means that PSA screening may reduce mortality from prostate cancer {{by up to}} 25%. Expected harms include anxiety for 100 – 120 receiving false positives, biopsy pain, and other complications from biopsy for false positive tests. Of those found to have prostate cancer, frequent overdiagnosis is common because most cases of prostate cancer {{are not expected to}} cause any symptoms. Therefore, many will experience the side effects of treatment, such as for every 1000 men screened, 29 will experience erectile dysfunction, 18 will suffer urinary incontinence, 2 will have serious cardiovascular events, 1 will suffer pulmonary embolus or deep venous thrombosis, and 1 <b>perioperative</b> death. Since the expected harm relative to risk of death are perceived by patients as minimal, men found to have prostate cancer usually (up to 90% of cases) select to receive treatment.|$|E
25|$|A {{primitive}} tourniquet can be {{made from}} a stick and a rope (or leather belt). The rope is made into a loop that fits over the damaged limb and the stick is inserted through the loop. The loop is tightened by twisting the stick. The primitive device may stem the flow of blood but side-effects such as soft tissue damage and nerve damage may occur due to the application of unknown, uncontrollable and excessively high pressures and pressure gradients. It is well established by evidence in the clinical literature that higher tourniquet pressures are associated with higher probabilities of tourniquet-related injuries. Modern pneumatic tourniquet systems are microcomputer-based, allowing more accurate and automatic pressure control and many important safety features to minimize the risk of patient injury. Recent trends toward personalized care has increased patient safety by allowing <b>perioperative</b> staff to measure and select a personalized tourniquet pressure based on the patient’s Limb Occlusion Pressure, and select and apply a personalized tourniquet cuff that can adapt the shape of the tourniquet cuff {{to a wide range of}} non-cylindrical limb shapes.|$|E

2500|$|A {{near miss}} is an {{unplanned}} event {{that did not}} result in injury, illness, or damage - but had the potential to do so. Reporting of near misses by observers is an established error reduction technique in aviation, and has been extended to private industry, traffic safety and fire-rescue services with reductions in accidents and injury. AORN, a US-based professional organization of <b>perioperative</b> registered nurses, has put in effect a voluntary near miss reporting system (SafetyNet), covering medication or transfusion reactions, communication or consent issues, wrong patient or procedures, communication breakdown or technology malfunctions.
