5|$|Augustine {{believed}} that a physical Hell exists, but that <b>physical</b> <b>punishment</b> is secondary to the punishment of being separated from God. He proposed two reasons for this: Firstly, humans have free will, and only those who choose to follow God will be forgiven and able to avoid Hell. Secondly, he {{believed that}} Adam and Eve's choice to sin affected our free choice, and that humans are left unable to resist sin. Augustine proposed that the grace of Jesus Christ freed humans from original sin, but he maintained that humans can only be saved {{if they choose to}} receive grace, and that this choice is formed by the character of individual humans. Accepting that even those who will be saved continue to sin, Augustine proposed that those who choose God's grace will still go to Hell for a time to purge them of their sin, before going to Heaven.|$|E
5|$|British philosopher Richard Swinburne {{proposed}} {{a version of}} the Irenaean theodicy based on his libertarian view of free will, a view that one's free actions are not caused by any outside agent. He argued that, in order for people to make free moral decisions, they must be aware of the consequences of such decisions. Knowledge of these consequences must be based on experience—Swinburne rejected the idea that God could implant such knowledge, arguing that humans would question its reliability. Swinburne argued that humans must have first hand experience of natural evil {{in order to understand the}} consequences of moral evil and that for God to give humans moral free will, he must allow human suffering. Swinburne conceived Hell as being a separation from God, rejecting the notion of eternal <b>physical</b> <b>punishment,</b> and argued that people who had chosen to reject God throughout their lives would continue to do so after death.|$|E
5|$|The use of {{elephants}} in circuses {{has also been}} controversial; the Humane Society of the United States has accused circuses of mistreating and distressing their animals. In testimony to a US federal court in 2009, Barnum & Bailey Circus CEO Kenneth Feld acknowledged that circus elephants are struck behind their ears, under their chins and on their legs with metal-tipped prods, called bull hooks or ankus. Feld stated that these practices are necessary to protect circus workers and acknowledged that an elephant trainer was reprimanded for using an electric shock device, known as a hot shot or electric prod, on an elephant. Despite this, he denied {{that any of these}} practices harm elephants. Some trainers have tried to train elephants without the use of <b>physical</b> <b>punishment.</b> Ralph Helfer is known to have relied on gentleness and reward when training his animals, including elephants and lions. Ringling Bros. and Barnum and Bailey circus retired its touring elephants in May 2016.|$|E
40|$|The main {{topic of}} this thesis {{is the issue}} of <b>physical</b> <b>punishments</b> in the Czech Republic. This topic is still very serious, often discussed, {{timeless}} and unresolved. <b>Physical</b> <b>punishments</b> are still extensively used as an educational tool in the Czech Republic. This demonstrates the tolerance of our society to accept <b>physical</b> <b>punishments</b> or the fear of adopting a law that would prohibit the use of <b>physical</b> <b>punishments.</b> The current situation has been mapped by the use of surveys, opinions and views of students and their awareness regarding alternative ways of upbringing. All research questions were fully saturated and the conclusions of the investigation came up as expected. It {{is not surprising that the}} results of the study point to the harmfulness of <b>physical</b> <b>punishments,</b> which were confirmed earlier in analogous researches. It is not even startling that relatively large number of respondents, who described their own experience with <b>physical</b> <b>punishments</b> during their lifetime in various degree. This phenomenon is attributed to the low awareness of the older generation, which transmits it´s experiences from the time long gone. The outcome of the survey and the attitude of students to <b>physical</b> <b>punishments</b> can be described as interesting or even surprising. Most of the respondents said that they will apply <b>physical</b> <b>punishments</b> during of their childrens upbringing. The cause is considered to their own experience with moderate <b>physical</b> <b>punishments</b> and these practices which carried to the next generation. The surveyed respondents, who stated that they will not use <b>physical</b> <b>punishments,</b> have their own experiences with a higher intensity of <b>physical</b> <b>punishments.</b> However, the intensity of <b>physical</b> <b>punishments</b> didn't reach such high level that this could pathologically affect the structure of the personality. These partners tend to avoid <b>physical</b> <b>punishments</b> all together. It would emerge as an aggressive and violent behaviour in the case of pathological manifestations that would be considered by them as standard norm of upbringing...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} parents’ use of <b>physical</b> <b>punishments</b> in disciplining {{their children from}} the cultural perspective. The importance of Igbo cultural values, parents' participation in Igbo cultural events and how the parents respond to the bad behaviors of their children in their families were determined. The cultural aspect of the Ecological system model {{was used to examine}} how the parents use <b>physical</b> <b>punishments</b> on their children. Multi-staged sampling method was used to select the 411 parents who were administered the questionnaires. Dimensions of Disciplinary Inventory (DDI) developed by Straus and Fauchier (2007) was used to measure the parents’ use of <b>physical</b> <b>punishments</b> on their children while the Cultural Values and Belief Scale developed by Rusty, Reynolds, Randal, Beth and Duane (2004) was used to measure cultural importance (Part 'A') and the participation in cultural events (Part 'B'). The study indicated that parents’ use of <b>physical</b> <b>punishments</b> have moderate and positive correlation with cultural importance and the participation in cultural events. Results of the Multiple Linear Regression analysis demonstrate the unique contributions of the variables to the parents’ use of <b>physical</b> <b>punishments</b> on their children. The discussion highlighted the roles of cultural importance and the participation in cultural events among the parents and how they cope with the bad behaviors of their children in their families. The result of this study was used to further support some earlier findings on the study of culture and the use of <b>physical</b> <b>punishments</b> on the children...|$|R

25|$|The high {{mortality}} rate and comfortless lives {{of hard work}} on the island soon made it nigh impossible to get volunteers for the colony, and the company started using convicted prisoners, lured {{with the promise of}} freedom, to a high degree. Dyppel proved a harsh governor for such elements, and <b>physical</b> <b>punishment</b> was common. Krarup has a dim view of the predominantly Dutch and convicted settlers, but skips over Dyppel's countrymen (Danes, Norwegians, and Holsteiners).|$|E
25|$|In 1792 Pinel {{became the}} chief {{physician}} at the Bicêtre Hospital. Before his arrival, inmates were chained in cramped cell-like rooms {{where there was}} poor ventilation, led {{by a man named}} Jackson 'Brutis' Taylor. Jackson was then killed by the inmates leading to Pinel's leadership. In 1797, Pussin first freed patients of their chains and banned <b>physical</b> <b>punishment,</b> although straitjackets could be used instead. Patients were allowed to move freely about the hospital grounds, and eventually dark dungeons were replaced with sunny, well-ventilated rooms. He argued that mental illness was the result of excessive exposure to social and psychological stresses, to heredity and physiological damage.|$|E

25|$|After the {{establishment}} of the Irish Free State in 1922, little was done to update the 1908 Act or to ensure that its rules were observed, particularly those on corporal punishment. The purpose of the Act was to humanise reformatory and industrial schools and orphanages, and to reduce <b>physical</b> <b>punishment.</b> The 1908 Act regulations remained in force in Ireland almost unchanged until the 1970s, while elsewhere in Europe more progressive regimes developed, mainly after 1945. In contrast, the 1941 Children's Act, drafted while Éamon de Valera was briefly Minister of the Department of Education, reduced the minimum age of inmates to below 6 years, allowing small children to be detained because of their parents' poverty.|$|E
25|$|The reform {{movement}} in education began in Massachusetts when Horace Mann started the common school movement. Mann advocated a statewide curriculum and instituted financing of school through local property taxes. Mann also fought protracted battles against the Calvinist influence in discipline, preferring positive reinforcement to <b>physical</b> <b>punishment.</b> Most children {{learned to read}} and write and spell from Noah Webster's Blue Backed Speller and later the McGuffey Readers. The readings inculcated moral values as well as literacy. Most states tried to emulate Massachusetts, and New England retained its leadership position for another century. German immigrants brought in kindergartens and the Gymnasium (school), while Yankee orators sponsored the Lyceum movement that provided popular education for hundreds of towns and small cities.|$|E
25|$|Leopold also {{introduced}} radical reforms {{to the system}} of neglect and inhumane treatment of the mentally ill. On 23January 1774, the legge sui pazzi (law regarding the insane) was established, {{the first of its}} kind to be introduced in Europe, allowing steps to be taken to hospitalize individuals deemed insane. A few years later Leopold undertook the project of building a new hospital, the Bonifacio. He used his skill at choosing collaborators to put a young physician, Vincenzo Chiarugi, at its head. Chiarugi and his collaborators introduced new humanitarian regulations in the running of the hospital and caring for the mentally ill patients, including banning the use of chains and <b>physical</b> <b>punishment,</b> and in so doing have been recognized as early pioneers of what later came to be known as the moral treatment movement.|$|E

25|$|Cockburn became First Naval Lord briefly {{again in}} the First Peel {{ministry}} in December 1834 but resigned when the Government fell from power in April 1835. He then returned to his old post as Commander-in-Chief of the North America and West Indies Station. Promoted to full admiral on 10 January 1837, he was elected Tory Member of Parliament for Ripon at a by-election in September 1841 and also became First Naval Lord {{again in the}} Second Peel ministry later that month.

25|$|In {{addition}} to the studies of canine personality, {{there has been some}} research to determine whether there are breed differences in aggression. In a study published in 2008, aggression was divided into four categories: aggression directed at strangers, owner, strange dogs and rivalry with other household dogs. This study found that the Doberman Pinscher ranked relatively high on stranger-directed aggression, but extremely low on owner-directed aggression. The Doberman Pinscher ranked as average on dog-directed aggression and dog rivalry. Looking only at bites and attempted bites, Doberman Pinschers rank as far less aggressive towards humans, and show less aggression than many breeds without a reputation (e.g., Cocker Spaniel, Dalmatian, and Great Dane). This study concluded that aggression has a genetic basis, that the Doberman shows a distinctive pattern of aggression depending on the situation, and that contemporary Doberman Pinschers are not an aggressive breed overall. In regards to Dobermans attacking owners, it is rare and usually in the case of over discipline. Dobermans accept <b>physical</b> <b>punishment</b> to an extent. However, when they consider it to no longer be punishment, but an attack on themselves, they will defend themselves.|$|E

In Maeser's eyes, Basedow {{was not a good}} example.|$|E
50|$|Prostitution is not {{mentioned}} in any law texts in Sweden in the middle ages, and was thus not formally a crime. However, {{under the influence of}} the church, sexual acts outside of marriage was criminalized for both sexes, which also affected prostitutes. The normal punishment for illegal sexual relations was fines or, if the accused was unable to pay them, pillorying, whipping or other disciplinarian <b>physical</b> <b>punishments</b> within the Kyrkoplikt. The law and procedure was the same in the question of actual prostitution: When the activity of Sara Simonsdotter was exposed in the capital in 1618, revealing her brothel with clients in high circles, she, her staff, and clients were sentenced to various forms of fines, pillorying, and <b>physical</b> <b>punishments</b> for fornication.|$|R

500|$|By the {{classical}} period, <b>physical</b> <b>punishment</b> {{had been abandoned}} for manifest theft and Gaius records merely four-times damages, introduced by the praetor. This meant, somewhat strangely, that a praetorian action could be more serious than a civil action, which was unusual. [...] Gaius also elaborates slightly on what constitutes manifest theft. He says that most jurists believed it extended to being caught {{in the place of}} the theft with the thing, and no further. [...] Julian (jurist), Ulpian, and Justinian all described it as including the thief who was still carrying the thing to its intended hiding place. There may have been a maximum time limit on manifest theft of this type, but it is unclear how long it was. The general rules for furtum were almost fully developed by {{the classical}} period and few significant changes were made during and after it.|$|E
500|$|On 30 July the French {{and allied}} troops left the fortress. The {{garrison}} troops were split into French and non-French units (of whom Poles still constituted 1,800); the Austrian soldiers observing the marching non-French garrison troops were given permission to physically assault those [...] "recognized" [...] as deserters {{and most of}} them were eventually arrested. Polish officers— particularly those from the Austrian partition— were forced to enlist in the Austrian army or deported to partitioned Poland, and a similar fate befell Polish NCOs and regular soldiers, many of whom were also forced to suffer <b>physical</b> <b>punishment</b> by being beaten with rods. This marked the end of the Second Legion of the Polish Legions. Foissac-Latour was later criticized by the Poles for what they considered [...] "betrayal", but also by the French: for his surrender, Napoleon himself ordered Foissac-Latour stricken from the list of generals and forbade him to wear a military uniform.|$|E
500|$|At age 10 Johannes was {{declared}} a {{ward of court}} {{and sent to the}} school institution Toftes gave on the island Helgøya in the lake Mjøsa. While at the strict institution Johannes received parcels from home, with yellow cheese. The cheese was needed because of the meagre rations given the boys at Toftes gave. The parcels with yellow cheese led to Johannes being given the nickname [...] "Gulosten" [...] (...) by the other boys at the institution, a name that stuck with him {{for the rest of his}} life. After four years on Helgøya he was transferred to Bastøy school home for maladjusted boys, an equally harsh institution. When 29boys rebelled at Bastøy in 1915, police officers and the Norwegian Armed Forces were employed to crush the riot, and the leaders taken away in handcuffs. <b>Physical</b> <b>punishment</b> was common at Bastøy, including being locked away in a dark cellar, a punishment Johannes had to endure. When Johannes was 15 his mother died, and he was not informed until several days after her funeral.
