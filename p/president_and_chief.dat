5|$|By December 1989, Stone began {{approaching}} studios to {{back his}} film. While in pre-production on The Doors, {{he met with}} three executives at Warner Bros. who wanted {{him to make a}} film about Howard Hughes. However, Warren Beatty owned the rights and so Stone pitched JFK. Studio <b>president</b> <b>and</b> <b>Chief</b> Operating Officer Terry Semel liked the idea. He had a reputation for making political and controversial films, including All the President's Men, The Parallax View and The Killing Fields. Stone made a handshake deal with Warner Bros. whereby the studio would get all the rights to the film and put up $20 million for the budget. The director did this so that the screenplay would not be widely read and bid on, and he also knew that the material was potentially dangerous and wanted only one studio to finance it. Finally, Stone liked Semel's track record of producing political films.|$|E

New gameplay elements were often added at Ireland's request, including new sequences such as playing Alex's harp to awaken Luna {{near the end of}} the game. Working Designs also put extra effort into the game's packaging, giving the instruction booklet embossed lettering, and having seven separate stamps, each with different artwork, produced for the front of the game discs to increase collection value.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy VII {{was officially}} {{announced}} in February 1996. Square <b>president</b> <b>and</b> <b>chief</b> executive officer Tomoyuki Takechi was fairly confident about Japanese players making the game a commercial success despite it {{being on a}} new platform. A playable demo was included on a disc giveaway at the 1996 Tokyo Game Show, dubbed Square's Preview Extra: Final Fantasy VII & Siggraph '95 Works. The disc also included the early test footage Square created using characters from Final Fantasy VI. The initial release date was {{at some point in}} 1996, but to properly realize their vision, Square postponed the release date almost a full year. Final Fantasy VII was released on January 31, 1997. It was published in Japan by Square. A re-release of the game based on its Western version, titled Final Fantasy VII International, was released on October 2, 1997. This improved International version would kickstart the trend for Square to create an updated version for Japanese release, based on the enhanced Western versions. The International version was re-released as a physical disc as part of the Final Fantasy 25th Anniversary Ultimate Box Japanese package on December 18, 2012.|$|E

5|$|It later {{emerged that}} Harding had also promised former Utah senator George Sutherland {{a seat on}} the Supreme Court, and was waiting in the {{expectation}} that another place would become vacant. Harding was also considering a proposal by Justice William R. Day to crown his career by being chief justice for six months before retiring. Taft felt, when he learned of this plan, that a short-term appointment would not serve the office well, and that once confirmed by the Senate, the memory of Day would grow dim. After Harding rejected Day's plan, Attorney General Harry Daugherty, who supported Taft's candidacy, urged him to fill the vacancy, and he named Taft on June 30, 1921. The Senate confirmed Taft the same day, 61–4, without any committee hearings and after a brief debate in executive session. Taft drew the objections of three progressive Republicans and one southern Democrat. When he was sworn in on July 11, he became the first and to date only person to serve both as <b>president</b> <b>and</b> <b>chief</b> justice.|$|E
5|$|Ranger's 9-foot {{prototype}} of the product, with plenty of right angles and shiny black Micarta skin, was bulky, imposing, and visually unattractive. Arnold Wolf was called in as the industrial design consultant to this project in early 1957. Wolf, who would later become <b>president</b> <b>and</b> <b>chief</b> executive of JBL, was initially asked to produce a shell version for dealers' shops. Due to transportation and installation constraints, {{it was decided that}} the speaker would be split into three components – the left and right channel enclosures, and the curved radiator panel – that could be easily re-assembled with a screwdriver. To support the weight and prevent deforming, the design called for six feet, of which four are height-adjustable. Instead of producing detailed drawings, Wolf worked with scale models. First, he created a 1:4 model in plastic, after which he made others. He ended with a 1:12 scale model that would show how it could be disassembled and reassembled. During the design phase, the relationship between Wolf and Ranger became very tense, and the project nearly collapsed. The parties came together over the month of June, and agreed on the definitive production specification for the Paragon. This would be a 2-way design.|$|E
5|$|Similar issues {{occurred}} in New Brunswick where 18,000customers remained without power through July11. More than 310crews remained deployed throughout the province with electricity {{expected to be}} fully restored by the following week. Costs to repair the power grid were estimated in excess of C$12million (US$11.1million). There was criticism that New Brunswick Power did not appropriately prepare for the storm and actually requested assistance from other public power companies and private contractors after the storm had struck. Two public buildings in Fredericton were utilized as recharging centers for residents to charge their phones and shower. An estimated 6,000people took advantage of this through July10. Shaved ice was later distributed from the Grant-Harvey Centre in the city while several waste disposal sites were opened for residents {{to get rid of}} spoiled food from power outages. Gaëtan Thomas, <b>president</b> <b>and</b> <b>chief</b> executive officer of NB Power, likened the effects of Arthur in the region to Hurricane Katrina along the United States Gulf Coast in August2005. He referenced that during Katrina, 50 percent of the affected region lost power, while in the wake of Arthur 57 percent of New Brunswick was in the dark over a similar geographic area. Earlier cuts to the company's tree-trimming budget were cited as a possible cause in the scale of damage. As such, their budget for trimming in 2015 was increased from C$6million to C$8million.|$|E
