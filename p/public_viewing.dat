40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} releasing a limited <b>public</b> <b>view</b> of a sensitive graph which reveals at least k edges per node. We are motivated by Facebook’s public search listings, which expose user profiles to search engines along with a fixed number of each user’s friends. If this <b>public</b> <b>view</b> is produced by uniform random sampling, an adversary can accurately approximate many sensitive features of the original graph, including the degree of individual nodes. We propose several schemes to produce <b>public</b> <b>views</b> which hide degree information. We demonstrate the practicality of our schemes using real data and show {{that it is possible}} to mitigate inference of degree while still providing useful <b>public</b> <b>views...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Information {{systems support}} data privacy by {{granting}} access only to certain (<b>public)</b> <b>views.</b> We examine the data privacy problem for ALC knowledge bases {{which is to}} decide whether hidden (private) information may be inferred from a <b>public</b> <b>view</b> instance and some additional general background knowledge. We present a syntactic criterion which guarantees that data privacy holds in all possible instances of a given <b>public</b> <b>view</b> definition. This is established through proof-theoretical results of description logic. Our approach is also directly applicable on modular ontologies. We can show that certain modules retain their privacy even when other modules are made public...|$|R

5|$|A longer 116-minute copy of {{the film}} has not been {{released}} officially, but has been found as a bootleg. This copy is a poor-quality videocassette dub and has a burned-in time code in the corner indicating that the film was not meant for <b>public</b> <b>viewing.</b> However, the European, Japanese and Australian DVD releases restore three minutes of the violent footage missing from the Region 1 DVD (that was cut for an R rating), making them the versions closest to Woo's original cut.|$|E
5|$|After the Early Neolithic, {{the long}} barrow {{fell into a}} state of ruined dilapidation, with a small road being built through the centre of the {{monument}} by the 19th century at the latest. Local folklore grew up around the site, associating it with the countless stones motif. The ruin attracted the interest of antiquarians in the early 18th century, and was studied by local archaeologists in the 20th. Both it and the nearby Chestnuts Long Barrow are open for <b>public</b> <b>viewing</b> by appointment with the landowner.|$|E

Cynthia Miller Lawrence, an American art-historian, argues that Anna Maria Luisa thus provisioned for Tuscany's future economy through tourism. Sixteen years after her death, the Uffizi Gallery, built by Cosimo the Great, {{the founder of the}} Grand Duchy, was made open to <b>public</b> <b>viewing.</b>|$|E

The carrying capacity of Moutohora is estimated at 8,500 individuals, and the island could allow <b>public</b> <b>viewing</b> of wild tuatara. In 2003, 60 northern tuatara were introduced to Tiritiri Matangi Island from Middle Island in the Mercury group. They are occasionally seen sunbathing by visitors to the island.|$|E

5|$|Both pavilions were {{scheduled}} to be unveiled on June 19, 2009. However, Hadid's pavilion was not ready in time; it had construction delays and a construction team change, which led to coverage of the delay in The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal. Only its aluminum skeleton was available for <b>public</b> <b>viewing</b> on the scheduled date; the work was completed and unveiled on August 4, 2009. The van Berkel pavilion was temporarily closed for repairs August 10–14, due to unanticipated wear and tear. Both pavilions were dismantled after November 1, 2009; the materials from van Berkel's were recycled, while Hadid's was stored for possible exhibition elsewhere.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to a larger than usual celebrity attendance, the Presidential Inaugural Committee increased its outreach to ordinary citizens to encourage greater participation in inaugural events compared with participation in recent past inaugurations.

Selected American citizens participated in the train tour and other inaugural events, and a philanthropist organized a People's Inaugural Ball for disadvantaged people who otherwise would be unable to afford to attend the inaugural festivities. Among the celebrations for the inauguration, the committee hosted a first-ever Neighborhood Inaugural Ball with free or affordable tickets for ordinary citizens.|$|E
