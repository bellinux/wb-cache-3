40|$|An {{international}} {{field experience}} {{is an important}} way for social work students to gain knowledge of cultures other than their own. The demand for international social work internships is increasing. This study surveyed social work programs accredited by the Council on Social Work Education that currently offer international field <b>placements,</b> and in turn, identified best practices for developing international <b>placements.</b> The findings included the number and frequency of international <b>placements,</b> the countries where <b>placements</b> occurred, the model and development of international <b>placements,</b> funding opportunities, and the supervision and monitoring of international <b>placements.</b> Programs were also provided an opportunity to discuss reasons why they chose not to place students internationally. Quantitative and qualitative data was collected using an online survey tool, Survey Monkey. The survey was sent to 482 accredited schools of social work, with 228 programs responding. Results were compared to a similar study completed in 2002 by Panos, Pettys, Cox, and Jones-Hart. The results from this recent study indicated an increase in programs offering international field <b>placements</b> {{and an increase in}} social work programs developing international <b>placements.</b> A lack of relationships with international schools of social work and field sites surfaced as one of the main challenges to developing international <b>placements.</b> The aim {{of this study was to}} provide social work programs interested in developing international <b>placements</b> with resources and best practice methods for developing international field practicum sites.

40|$|C 1 - Journal Articles RefereedOBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} extent of {{undergraduate}} health student <b>placements</b> in regional hospitals in northern Victoria in 1999, prior to substantial changes in rural undergraduate medical education in Australia. METHOD: Cross sectional postal survey with telephone follow-up in north-east Victoria. Subjects were all 17 regional and rural hospitals involved in health student teaching in North-east Victoria. Main outcome measures were the numbers, duration and discipline of health students <b>placements</b> and reported barriers to such <b>placements.</b> RESULTS: Large regional hospitals accounted for two-thirds of all undergraduate health student <b>placements.</b> Smaller sites placed few allied health students. Barriers to a larger, more sustainable system of rural <b>placements</b> and rotations included accommodation shortages and funding constraints, particularly in smaller rural hospitals. CONCLUSIONS: Adequate resourcing of <b>placements</b> of a meaningful duration, stronger institutional support, and improved resourcing of regional accommodation is required to facilitate a larger, more systematic and sustainable system of medical and health student <b>placements</b> in rural areas.
