5|$|The Old National Library Building was a {{historical}} building at Stamford Road in the Museum <b>Planning</b> <b>Area</b> of Singapore. Originally completed in 1960, it housed the National Library {{and was a}} national icon for many Singaporeans. Despite a huge groundswell of public dissent, the library was closed on 31 March 2004, and was demolished {{to make way for}} the construction of the Fort Canning Tunnel to ease road traffic to the city. The controversy surrounding the building's demise has been credited for sparking greater awareness of local cultural roots and an unprecedented wave in favour of heritage conservation among Singaporeans.|$|E
40|$|The Boulder Bay {{project area}} {{is located in}} the Nevada side of the TRPA’s North Stateline Community <b>Plan</b> (NSCP) <b>area</b> (TRPA et al. 1996). The overall {{planning}} goal of the NSCP is to create a more familyfriendly destination resort experience by emphasizing entertainment, outdoor recreation, and human-scale design while avoiding or minimizing impacts to local residents (TRPA et al. 1996). A small portion of the project area is situated in the Crystal Bay <b>Plan</b> <b>Area</b> (TRPA 2008). The Crystal Bay <b>Plan</b> <b>Area</b> (<b>Plan</b> <b>Area</b> 34) is located along State Highway 28 between the NSCP and Incline Village, and contains a lowdensity residential area.

40|$|The {{study of}} the {{conventional}} Straight Line (SL) wind flow dominates research into wind loads on structures. Most structure design takes into account only research into SL flow. Few researchers have studied tornado forces on buildings and attempted to distinguish between tornadic wind loads and SL flow loads. Using a computer simulation, this research addresses and distinguishes between the tornadic forces and SL forces on structures. In the numerical simulation, tornado forces and SL forces will be compared on large structure <b>plan</b> <b>areas</b> and on thin structure <b>plan</b> <b>areas.</b> Additionally this research investigates how {{the increase in the}} vortex strength (α) affects tornado forces on a cubic structure. The large structure <b>plan</b> <b>areas</b> are dimensionalized by the structure height: (1 h x 1 h, 2 h x 2 h, 4 h x 4 h and 8 h x 8 h) where h is 20. 3 (m) and tornado maximum radius (rmax) is 61 (m). The structure <b>plan</b> <b>areas</b> are a multiple of factor two. The thin structure <b>plan</b> <b>areas</b> are obtained by dividing the large structure <b>plan</b> <b>areas</b> by a factor of ten. This research has three key findings. First, when the same maximum reference velocity (Vtrans.) was used and when the large structure <b>plan</b> <b>area</b> characteristic length was approximately twice the tornado maximum diameter, the force and pressure coefficients had the same values as Straight Line (SL) flow. Second, the thin structure <b>plan</b> <b>areas</b> are more likely collapse faster {{in the presence of a}} tornado compared to SL flow due to the high differentials pressure in tornado between the windward wall and the leeward wall. In addition, on the thin structure <b>plan</b> <b>areas,</b> the tornado force coefficients were twice the SL flow force coefficients. The final key finding is that when the vortex strength (α) increased, the tornado force coefficients increased exponentially...|$|R
