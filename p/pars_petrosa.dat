40|$|L'étude biométrique des restes de Renne découverts à Combe-Grenal a permis de mettre en évidence quelques différences de taille significatives {{au niveau}} dentaire entre le Renne des couches 35 à 26 et ceux des couches 25 à 1 plus récentes. De telles différences ne semblent pas se manifester sur le squelette post-crânien. As we showed in our thesis (Guadellli, 1987), the {{morphology}} of the <b>pars</b> <b>petrosa</b> is very distinctive but this cranial part is usually put aside by the archeozoologists. So {{in this text}} it seems interesting to us to compare the <b>pars</b> <b>petrosa</b> of the Reindeer and of the Red deer. Without giving {{a detailed account of}} morphology of this temporal part we can say as follows : The cranial part of the <b>pars</b> <b>petrosa</b> of the Reindeer draws an irregular picture. The medial side, very sinuous, is concave above the fossa cerebellaris ("fosse cérébelleuse") and convexe in his medio-ventral part. The ventral side of the <b>pars</b> <b>petrosa</b> of both species is triangular but the nervi trigemini print ("empreinte du nerf trijumeau") is more irregular {{in the case of the}} Reindeer. The aperture of the canalis facialis ("aqueduc de Fallope = orifice du nerf facial") of the Reindeer is broader than the one of the Red deer. The medial side of the <b>pars</b> <b>petrosa</b> of the Reindeer is concave while the one of the Red deer is straight. By the biometrical study of the faunal remains of Rangifer tarandus found at Combe-Grenal we show up some relevant dental size differences between the Reindeer of the layers 35 to 26 and those, more recent, of the layers 25 to 1. These differences seems to be absent on the post-cranial remains. Guadelli Jean Luc.

De telles différences ne semblent pas se manifester sur le squelette post-crânien. Comme nous l'avions montré dans notre thèse (Guadelli, 1987) les portions pétreuses de temporal sont porteuses de nombreux renseignements mais elles sont le plus souvent ignorées par les archéozoologues. Ainsi, les caractéristiques morphologiques des portions pétreuses de temporal (rochers) de Rangifer tarandus sont décrites et comparées à celles des os homologues de Cervus elaphus...|$|E
30|$|It {{is evident}} that the {{material}} least exposed to groundwater contamination is the teeth and the compact bone tissue, while the <b>pars</b> <b>petrosa</b> and the trabecular bone tissue, which is much harder to decontaminate and much more exposed to contamination by percolating ground water and invading soil particles, are more exposed to diagenesis.|$|E
40|$|An 11 -year-old {{male with}} {{monostotic}} fibrous dysplasia {{of the left}} temporal bone was reported. At {{the age of seven}} years, the patient began having epileptic attacks, and a bony swelling of the left temporal region was noticed by his mother. Roentgenologically, there were almost thorough osseous obstruction and osseous proliferation of the external auditory canal and <b>pars</b> <b>petrosa,</b> respectively. Audiologic examinations indicated gradual functional disturbance based on the affected internal ear.

30|$|In many {{individuals}} the Hg concentration {{appears to have}} risen with age—it is lowest in <b>pars</b> <b>petrosa,</b> higher in compact bone and highest in trabecular bone. This {{could be due to}} an accumulative effect. Alternatively, the Hg concentration in the trabecular tissue could be interpreted to reflect the sum of the Hg in the bone tissue and the Hg originally present in the soft tissue, e.g. bone marrow, which is now decomposed and which will have left any Hg adhered {{to the surface of the}} lamellae of the trabecular bone. It has not been possible to mechanically decontaminate the trabecular bone tissue in the same thorough way it was done with the compact bone tissue samples.|$|E
30|$|Bones in {{the human}} body undergo re-modelling via the {{formation}} of osteons [43 – 47]. After adolescence the re-modelling process continues throughout the remainder of life. The average turnover time is different for different tissue types. The cortical bone tissue generally exhibits an average turnover rate of ca. 2.5 % per year and trabecular bone tissue has a faster turnover rate of ca. 10 % per year [44, 48]. There is one exception, namely <b>pars</b> <b>petrosa</b> which contains the organs of the inner ear. This bone is fixated (hence the name) at around the age of 2  years. Teeth also undergo very little re-modelling once formed, and the root of the first incisor (+ 1) reflects the chemistry around the age of 9 – 10, the canine (+ 3) the age of 11 – 15, and the third molar (+ 8) 18 – 20  years of age [49].|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe <b>pars</b> <b>petrosa</b> ossis temporalis {{has been}} studied {{for the purpose of}} sex {{estimation}} in many cadaveric studies. Since several studies have demonstrated that discriminant function equations used to determine the sex of a skeleton are population specific, {{the purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the capability of computerized tomography of temporal bone of living individuals to estimate the sex from measuring the lateral angle of internal acoustic canal meatus and drive similar equation for the size of the angle. Multidetector computerized tomography (MDCT) of the temporal bone was done to 120 patients (59 females and 61 males) to measure the lateral angle size. The mean angle is greater in females (50. 34 ± 6. 178) than males (42. 39 ± 5. 77). Measurements of 37. 187 ° and lesser were 83. 6 % specific for males and measurements higher than 37. 187 ° were 77. 96 % specific for females. Finally, it is concluded that the petrous portion of temporal bone is useful for sex estimation in Egyptian population...|$|E
