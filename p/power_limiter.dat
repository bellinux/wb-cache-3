A series of 1, 4, 8, 11, 15, 18, 22, 25 -octa-alkoxy metallophthalocyanines containing various central metal atoms such as zinc, copper, palladium, cobalt and nickel were characterized for their third order nonlinearity and for their nonlinear absorptive properties to evaluate their suitability to function as reverse saturable absorbers...|$|R
40|$|Narrow-band invisibility in an {{otherwise}} opaque medium has been achieved by electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) in atomic systems. The quantum EIT behavior can be classically mimicked by specially engineered metamaterials via carefully controlled interference with a “dark mode. ” However, the narrow transparency window limits the potential applications that require a tunable wideband transparent performance. Here, we present a macroscopic quantum superconducting metamaterial with manipulative self-induced broadband transparency due to a qualitatively novel nonlinear mechanism {{that is different from}} conventional EIT or its classical analogs. A near-complete disappearance of resonant absorption under a range of applied rf flux is observed experimentally and explained theoretically. The transparency comes from the intrinsic bistability of the meta-atoms and can be tuned on and off easily by altering rf and dc magnetic fields, temperature, and history.

Nonlinear optical {{transmission}} in materials has several applications including laser mode-locking, pulse shaping, optical bistability, optical switching, and optical power limiting. Organic molecules suitable for functionalization have been extensively investigated for their third order nonlinearities.

30|$|Transient noise can {{be removed}} by {{utilizing}} a nonlinear filter such as a median filter or a <b>power</b> <b>limiter</b> [4 – 7, 9]. The nonlinear <b>power</b> <b>limiter</b> suppresses input segments which have enormous magnitude compared to a pre-assigned value. Since it only cuts down the high amplitude portion of transient noise, some noise component still remains in the output. Moreover, if transient noise is added to speech, determining {{the amount of the}} signal power reduction is difficult because the level of the speech waveform varies rapidly. Consequently, the <b>power</b> <b>limiter</b> is not efficient to eliminate transient noise in speech [5, 7, 9]. A median filter is a signal dependent filter which removes the fast varying components while preserving slowly varying components of the input signal [4, 6, 7, 10]. The median filter does not require any pre-defined threshold during the filtering process. Since the median filter only preserves the slowly varying components of input signal, however, it may distort the characteristic of fast varying region of speech, i.e., around pitch epoch. Therefore, an additional pre-processing step to keep the speech characteristic before applying the median filter is needed. For example, a short-term linear prediction (STP) filter and a long-term prediction (LTP) filter which are parametric approaches to model speech signal can be utilized as a pre-processor [11]. The purpose of the pre-processor is passing transient noise components but keeping speech information by utilizing the speech modeling filter not to be affected by the median filtering afterwards.|$|E

40|$|Optical {{limiters}} transmit low-level radiation while blocking electromagnetic pulses with excessively {{high energy}} (energy limiters) or with excessively high peak intensity (<b>power</b> <b>limiters).</b> A typical optical limiter absorbs {{most of the}} high-level radiation which can cause its destruction via overheating. Here we introduce the novel concept of a reflective energy limiter which blocks electromagnetic pulses with excessively high total energy by reflecting them back to space, rather than absorbing them. The idea {{is to use a}} defect layer with temperature dependent loss tangent embedded in a low-loss photonic structure. The low energy pulses with central frequency close to that of the localized defect mode will pass through. But if the cumulative energy carried by the pulse exceeds certain level, the entire photonic structure reflects the incident light (and does not absorb it!) for a broad frequency window. The underlying physical mechanism is based on self-regulated impedance mismatch which increases dramatically with the cumulative energy carried by the pulse.
