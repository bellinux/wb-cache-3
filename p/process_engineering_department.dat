Intel Corporation is one {{of major}} renowned {{multinational}} companies {{in the world and}} the number one in the microprocessors manufacturing process for servers and personal computers, either desktop or mobile, among other things. Big part of this success is due to the operating process excellence, independently of the geographical location and the country’s culture where the process is performed. However, great improvement possibilities have been identified at project level, mainly due to the formal project management differences between manufacturing sites and even between departments and work groups. The main objective of this investigation was to provide a project management improvement proposal that will allow progressively reach the level of excellence expected by the company and the corporation in all of his work activities, either operational or services and projects. This investigation was held in the company “Componentes Intel de Costa Rica S. A. ”, specifically in the <b>process</b> <b>engineering</b> <b>department.</b> The department’s management, based in the business needs, the mission and vision of this group, and the recommendations made by the project’s office inside the department, has defined as a priority to emphasize this investigation on the time and resource management knowledge areas, at the formal project management level. The improvement proposal presented was structured based in four main deliverables: current state investigation of the department in the formal project management processes, definition of the ideal state of this group at project’s level, gap analysis between those two states, and the generation of recommendations in order to improve the project administration processes. The methodology used was based in a descriptive type investigation, analyzing study variables through interviews and documents compilation, as the standardization and the project’s control and follow up processes; that allowed obtaining concrete results related to the two knowledge areas defined. Making usage of the obtained results and the analysis performed following the PMI guides, the deliverables defined for this investigation were developed and completed. Among the main conclusions obtained were the big improvement opportunities related to the processes’ standardization, the real performance measurement and the development plans for the department’s personnel at project level. A great advantage the <b>process</b> <b>engineering</b> <b>department</b> has is its project’s office recently instituted, key for the development and monitoring of the improvement plans at project level. The most important recommendations of this work were oriented in taking advantage of the infrastructure and tools available inside the company to improve the department’s project management, and also to focus on using the guides and best practices established by the PMI, or other international organisms recognized in project management success. The present investigation had the main intention to create an improvement proposal for the <b>process</b> <b>engineering</b> <b>department</b> in relation with the project management, aligned with the corporative vision, in order to be part of the continuous improvement efforts in this area.

40|$|ABSTRACT: At the {{beginning}} of the new millennium, the global context of the industrialized world compels and threats to increase productivity levels required to improve economic competitivity of the enterprises. This and also the social pressures to decrease existing levels of poverty are all coexisting factors in Colombia, a country with outstanding amount of natural and human resources. These factors have led educational authorities of <b>Process</b> <b>Engineering</b> <b>Department</b> of Universidad EAFIT in Colombia to create and trig the innovation of its undergraduate educational program. In this paper, a new and systematic approach for Process Engineering learning is presented. It is structured on a Systemic Curriculum and covers transversally Engineering, Management and Human subjects.

40|$|International audienceBesides {{finding the}} target values of every {{component}} of an assembled product, {{it is also}} necessary {{to find the best}} compromise between the quality product cost and the quality assembled cost. To this end, Genichi Taguchi and Don Clausing suggested using Taguchi’s lost function to evaluate these quality costs. Based on this function, Pillet suggested a new approach, called “inertial tolerancing”. This approach is a new language between the designer and the <b>process</b> <b>engineering</b> <b>department.</b> It allows a link to be made between the quality product cost and the quality assembled cost and then to use statistical tolerancing in the assembled design. This paper presents the efficiency of the use of this approach during the design phase for assembling two components and also its efficiency during the production phase for the monitoring with an inertia control chart. In order to illustrate this, these new approaches are used in industrial cases and compared to the traditional approach (tolerancing and monitoring) to underline the economic benefit which can be obtained using the inertial approach...|$|E

40|$|This master thesis {{presents}} an {{experimental study of}} the mean wake velocities, the drag coefficients and the vortex frequencies behind cylinders, porous discs and circular full discs. The thesis contributes to the development and better understanding of simple wind turbine wake models. The future long term goal {{is to improve the}} complex fluid flow models of wind turbines. The experimental trials were executed in two different wind tunnels at the Energy and <b>Process</b> <b>Engineering</b> <b>Department</b> of NTNU. The main trials have been conducted to determine the drag coefficient with two independent methods. Pitot tubes were used to determine the mean wake velocities and the drag coefficients by using the measurement by wake method. Furthermore, the force survey method was established by using a force plate. A broad literature survey revealed a consistent range of drag coefficients and mean wake velocities comparable to the determined results of the current investigation. Additionally it was found, that the measured upstream flow velocity has a major influence on the measurement by wake method. The results of the force survey method gave strong evidence, that the blockage effect has a negative influence. The final experiments were conducted as additional study on wake flows. The method applied was based on hot wire velocity measurements to determine the vortex shedding frequencies. A literature review predicted the vortex shedding frequencies of cylinders and circular full discs in a comparable range of the experimental results shown by the power spectral density analysis. The analysis of the porous biplane disc unfolded no discrete frequency. A comparison {{of the results of the}} mean wake flows revealed a significant variation between shape of the cylinder and discs to the model wind turbine. However, the porous monoplane disc achieved the best results and is therefore most promising for future investigations on wind turbine wake modelling. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{application}} of powder metallurgy (PM) technologies to the manufacturing of Oil & Gas turbomachineries’ components {{was investigated in}} the course of research collaboration with the Material and <b>Processes</b> <b>Engineering</b> <b>Department</b> of General Electric Oil & Gas (Italy). The thesis focused on the study of the pressure-assisted Hot Isostatic Pressing technology for the processing of the corrosion resistant Ni-base alloy N 07626. The densification behaviour of the N 07626 metal powder in condition of pressure assisted sintering was investigated by experiments conducted on a small scale by uniaxial hot pressing condition using a Spark Plasma Sintering (SPS) machine in the aim of extending the result to the initial stage of densification of HIP. The SPS exepriments demonstrated that the densification rate is strongly affected by the process temperature and it is less sensitive to the variation of applied pressure. The microstructure and mechanical properties of full-dense HIPped N 07626 alloy, produced according to a fixed proprietary cycle and several experimental deviations were analyzed. The microstructure was studied by Optical Metallography, Scanning Electron Microscopy, Energy Dispersed X-Ray Spectroscopy and Electron Backscatter Diffraction. The mechanical properties of the alloy were assessed by tensile testing, conventional and instrumented Charpy V-Notch testing, JIC fracture toughness tests and fatigue crack growth rate testing. The tensile and impact toughness properties resulted sensitive to the local accumulation of oxygen in Oxygen Affected Zones (OAZs), that leads to a ductile to brittle	transition in the impact toughness of the material. Two models for formation of OAZs were proposed based on the phase transformation and the oxidation/reduction reactions taking place in the HIP. The mechanical properties were discussed on the base of the microstructure of the Prior Particle Boundaries (PPBs) interface, focusing of the phase transformation products, represented by a thin layer of submicrometric oxides and carbides. The fracture mode was explained by the analogy with models of ductile micro-mechanisms of void nucleation and coalescence and with fracture models of particulate reinforced metal-matrix-composite. The Charpy impact toughness and the fracture toughness were correlated to the oxygen concentration and to the density of inclusions. The fatigue crack propagation behavior was discussed focusing on the effect of clustering of inclusions on the crack propagation path. A relation between the Paris slope with the impact toughness was found. Finally the increase of processing temperature (HIP and heat treatment) was found significanty beneficial for the toughness. This effect was investigate by grain-size analysis and was proposed to be related to a reduction of density of PPBs inclusions. ...|$|R

Herein, electrospun polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) /chitosan nanofibrous scaffolds have been synthesized with large pore sizes as potential matrices for nervous tissue engineering and repair. PVA fibers were modified through blending with chitosan and porosity of scaffolds was measured at various levels of their depth through an image analysis method. In addition, the structural, physicochemical, biodegradability, and swelling of the chitosan nanofibrous scaffolds were evaluated. The chitosan-containing scaffolds were used for in vitro cell culture in contact with PC 12 nerve cells, and they were found to exhibit the most balanced properties to meet the basic required specifications for nerve cells. It could be concluded that addition of chitosan to the PVA scaffolds enhances viability and proliferation of nerve cells, which increases the biocompatibility of the scaffolds. In fact, addition of a small percentage of chitosan to the PVA scaffolds proved to be a promising approach for synthesis of a neural-friendly polymeric blend.

40|$|In {{response}} to societal concerns about major disasters in the chemical <b>process</b> industries, chemical <b>engineering</b> <b>departments</b> have been attempting to incorporate chemical process safety into their curricula. Pressure is also coming from ABET; the AIChE Program Criteria in EC 2000 require a {{working knowledge of}} the safety aspects of chemical processes. There are three ways of incorporating chemical process safety into the chemical engineering curriculum: (1) a course or courses devoted to process safety, (2) integration of chemical process safety into existing courses and (3) {{a combination of the}} two approaches. Having a separate course in chemical process safety puts process safety in a prominent position in the curriculum, forces the students to focus on process safety, and is the best way to deal with certain safety topics such as toxicology, industrial hygiene, dispersion models and design of relief systems. However, the students may compartmentalize safety and treat it as a topic separate from their other chemical engineering activities. Furthermore, the students may not experience a “hands-on ” exposure to process safety. Finally, many chemical <b>engineering</b> <b>departments</b> do not have extra credits available in their curricula to permit a separate course in process safety. Integrating chemical process safety into existing chemical engineering courses has the advantage of exposing the students to chemical process safety “in context”. The unit operations laboratory and the process design courses are ideal settings for integration of process safety. The instructional materials developed by SACHE make it possible to spread aspects of chemical process safety throughout the entire chemical engineering curriculum. The biggest difficulty with this approach is getting all the chemical engineering faculty to follow through with the implementation...|$|R
