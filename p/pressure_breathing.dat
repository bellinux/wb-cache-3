5|$|A diving {{cylinder}}, scuba tank or {{diving tank}} is a gas cylinder used to store and transport the high <b>pressure</b> <b>breathing</b> gas required by a scuba set. It {{may also be}} used for surface-supplied diving or as decompression gas or an emergency gas supply for surface supplied diving or scuba. Cylinders provide gas to the diver through the demand valve of a diving regulator or the breathing loop of a diving rebreather.|$|E
5|$|Immersion of {{the human}} body in water affects the circulation, renal system, fluid balance, and breathing, because the {{external}} hydrostatic pressure of the water provides support against the internal hydrostatic pressure of the blood. This causes a blood shift from the extravascular tissues of the limbs into the chest cavity, and fluid losses known as immersion diuresis compensate for the blood shift in hydrated subjects soon after immersion. Hydrostatic pressure on the body from head-out immersion causes negative <b>pressure</b> <b>breathing</b> which contributes to the blood shift.|$|E
5|$|Divers {{operate in}} an {{environment}} for which {{the human body is}} not well suited. They face special physical and health risks when they go underwater or use high <b>pressure</b> <b>breathing</b> gas. The consequences of diving incidents range from merely annoying to rapidly fatal, and the result often depends on the equipment, skill, response and fitness of the diver and diving team. The hazards include the aquatic environment, the use of breathing equipment in an underwater environment, exposure to a pressurised environment and pressure changes, particularly pressure changes during descent and ascent, and breathing gases at high ambient pressure. Diving equipment other than breathing apparatus is usually reliable, but has been known to fail, and loss of buoyancy control or thermal protection can be a major burden which may lead to more serious problems. There are also hazards of the specific diving environment, and hazards related to access to and egress from the water, which vary from place to place, and may also vary with time. Hazards inherent in the diver include pre-existing physiological and psychological conditions and the personal behaviour and competence of the individual. For those pursuing other activities while diving, there are additional hazards of task loading, of the dive task and of special equipment associated with the task.|$|E

25|$|The {{alternative}} concept, {{developed in}} {{roughly the same}} time frame was closed-circuit scuba. The body consumes and metabolises {{only a small fraction}} of inhaled oxygenâ€”the situation is even more wasteful of oxygen when the breathing gas is compressed as it is in ambient <b>pressure</b> <b>breathing</b> systems underwater. The rebreather recycles the exhaled breathing gas, while constantly replenishing it from the supply so that the oxygen level does not get depleted. The apparatus also has to remove the exhaled carbon dioxide, as a buildup of CO2 levels would result in respiratory distress and hypercapnia.|$|E

25|$|Other {{factors which}} can affect {{decompression}} risk include oxygen concentration, carbon dioxide levels, body position, vasodilators and constrictors, {{positive or negative}} <b>pressure</b> <b>breathing.</b> and dehydration (blood volume). Individual susceptibility to decompression sickness has components which {{can be attributed to}} a specific cause, and components which appear to be random. The random component makes successive decompressions a poor test of susceptibility. Obesity and high serum lipid levels have been implicated by some studies as risk factors, and risk seems to increase with age. Another study has also shown that older subjects tended to bubble more than younger subjects for reasons not yet known, but no trends between weight, body fat, or gender and bubbles were identified, and the question of why some {{people are more likely to}} form bubbles than others remains unclear.|$|E
25|$|Small {{variations}} in pressure between the delivered gas and the ambient pressure at the lungs can be tolerated. These {{can result from}} the trim of the diver in the water, {{the position of the}} diaphragm operating the demand valve, the position of the counterlungs in a rebreather, cracking pressure and flow resistance of the exhaust valve, or intentional overpressure in a full-face mask or helmet, intended {{to reduce the risk of}} contaminated water leaking into the breathing apparatus through the exhaust valve. A consistent variation in delivered pressure difference does not affect the work of breathing - the whole graph is shifted up or down without change to the enclosed area - but the effort required for inhalation and exhalation are perceptibly different from normal, and if excessive, may make it difficult or impossible to breathe. Free-flow systems inherently operate under a positive pressure relative to the head, to allow controlled exhaust flow, but not necessarily to the lungs in the upright diver. Snorkel breathing is inherently negative <b>pressure</b> <b>breathing,</b> as the lungs of the swimmer are at least partly below the surface of the water.|$|E

500|$|Scuba and surface-supplied {{underwater}} divers and submariners also rely on artificially delivered [...] Submarines, submersibles {{and atmospheric}} diving suits usually operate at normal atmospheric <b>pressure.</b> <b>Breathing</b> air is scrubbed {{of carbon dioxide}} by chemical extraction and oxygen is replaced to maintain a constant partial pressure.

Pure or nearly pure [...] use in diving at pressures higher than atmospheric is usually limited to rebreathers, or decompression at relatively shallow depths (~6 meters depth, or less), or medical treatment in recompression chambers at pressures up to 2.8 bar, where acute oxygen toxicity can be managed without the risk of drowning. Deeper diving requires significant dilution of [...] with other gases, such as nitrogen or helium, to prevent oxygen toxicity.|$|E
