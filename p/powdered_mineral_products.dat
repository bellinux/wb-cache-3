The objective was to establish a reliable data base for use in predicting the effects of microwave heating {{on a wide range}} of minerals. In this phase of microwave research, the Bureau measured the dielectric properties of <b>powdered</b> <b>minerals</b> with medium to high electrical conductivities in the frequency range of 300 MHz to 3 GHz and as a function of temperature, from 25 deg to 325 deg C. Since the minerals were prepared as powders, techniques were used to relate the measured dielectric properties of the <b>powdered</b> <b>minerals</b> to the dielectric properties of the mineral at its theoretical or natural density.

40|$|Abstract. Production {{cost and}} {{emissions}} of pollutants can be reduced through mixing industry waste, such as <b>mineral</b> <b>powder</b> and fly ash, into ready-mixed concrete. Two approaches are adopted to the experiments to research the effect of <b>mineral</b> <b>powder</b> and fly ash on the compressive strength of ready-mixed concrete: (1) fixing the amount of fly ash, while substituting equivalent amount of <b>mineral</b> <b>powder</b> for cement. (2) fixing the amount of cement, while {{increasing the amount of}} <b>mineral</b> <b>powder</b> and decreasing that of fly ash. The result of the experiment shows: when equivalent amount of <b>mineral</b> <b>powder</b> substitutes for 16 % of the cement, the result is the best－the strength of concrete is deceased less than 5 %. The experiment also concludes that: keeping the usage of cement constant and adding 10 %- 15 % of <b>mineral</b> <b>powder</b> into concrete, the strength of concrete can be increased about 30 %. ...|$|R

40|$|China is {{the largest}} {{non-metallic}} mineral producer {{in the world and}} one of the key consumers of four major non-metallic <b>mineral</b> <b>products,</b> including cement, refractories, plate glass and ceramics. The non-metallic <b>mineral</b> <b>products</b> industry’s rapid growth has brought about a large demand for energy. The present study provides an overview of China’s non-metallic <b>mineral</b> <b>products</b> industry in terms of production, energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions. In this industry, the energy efficiency is relatively low and the level of carbon dioxide emission is much higher than developed countries’ average. This study interprets the effects of some newly issued policies and analyses the influential factors in achieving energy conservation and emission reduction goals. It also discusses the prospects for saving energy and emission reduction in the industry. Retrofitting facilities and using new production technologies is imperative. Additionally, implementing market-based policies, promoting industrial transformation and effective international cooperation would help decrease carbon dioxide emissions and energy consumption...|$|R
