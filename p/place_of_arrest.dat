40|$|SUMMARY We {{assessed}} factors {{during an}} initial episode of ventricular fibrillation {{that may be}} predictive of recurrence. Of 141 consecutive patients with acute ischemic heart disease who survived an initial episode of ventricular fibrillation, 41 (29 %) had recurrent ventricular fibrillation during hospitalization. The incidence of recurrent ventricular fibrillation was lower among those with an acute myocardial infarction than among those with an acute ischemic episode. Recurrent ventricular fibrillation occurred more frequently among patients with secondary ventricular fibrillation complicating an acute myocardial infarction than among those with primary ventricular fibrillation. Primary ventricular fibrillation that occurred within 2 hours of the onset of symptoms was {{no more likely to}} be recurrent than when it occurred later. Age, sex, site of infarction, <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>arrest,</b> adequacy of initial resuscitation, interval onset of symptoms to the initial episode of ventricular fibrilla-tion, onset of symptoms to intensive care and delay before initial attempted defibrillation were not significantly related to the recurrence of ventricular fibrillation.

40|$|Objectives: Data {{reflecting}} {{cardiopulmonary resuscitation}} (CPR) efforts in Saudi Arabia are limited. In this study, we analyzed the characteristics, and estimated the outcome, of in-hospital CPR in a teaching hospital in Saudi Arabia over 4 years. Methods: A retrospective, observational {{study was conducted}} between January 2009 and December 2012 and included 4361 patients with sudden cardiopulmonary arrest. Resuscitation forms were reviewed. Demographic data, resuscitation characteristics, and survival outcomes were recorded. Results: The mean ± standard deviation age of arrested patient was 40 ± 31 years. The immediate survival rate was 64 %, 43 % at 24 h, and 30 % at discharge. The death rate was 70 %. Respiratory type of arrest, time and <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>arrest,</b> short duration of arrest, witnessed arrest, the use of epinephrine and atropine boluses, and shockable arrhythmias were associated with higher 24 -h survival rates. A low survival rate was found among patients with cardiac types of arrest, and those with a longer duration of arrest, pulseless electrical activity, and asystole. Comorbidities were present in 3786 patients with cardiac arrest and contributed to a poor survival rate (P < 0. 001).

40|$|Aim To {{describe}} the relative impact on {{survival of the}} delay from estimated time of collapse to call for an ambulance among {{patients who suffer from}} a bystander witnessed out of hospital cardiac arrest of a cardiac aetiology. Methods A majority of all ambulance organizations in Sweden (covering 85 % of Sweden inhabitants) participate in a National survey of out of hospital cardiac arrest. Results In all there were 9340 patients with a bystander witnessed cardiac arrest of a cardiac aetiology in whom cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was attempted participating in this survey. Survival at one month among patients with a delay between estimated time of collapse and call for ambulance of {{less than or equal to}} 4 min (median) was 6. 9 % versus 2. 8 % among patients with a median of > 4 min (P< 0. 0001).

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{determine}} the circumstances, incidence, and outcome of cardiopulmonary resuscitation in British hospitals. DESIGN [...] Hospitals registered all cardiopulmonary resuscitation attempts for 12 months or longer and followed survival to one year. SETTING [...] 12 metropolitan, provincial, teaching, and non-teaching hospitals across Britain. SUBJECTS [...] 3765 patients in whom a resuscitation attempt was performed, including 927 in whom {{the onset of}} arrest was outside the hospital. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE [...] Survival after initial resuscitation, at 24 hours, at discharge from hospital, and at one year, calculated by the life table method. RESULTS [...] There were 417 known survivors at one year, with 214 lost to follow up. By life table analysis for every eight attempted resuscitations there were three immediate survivors, two at 24 hours, 1. 5 leaving hospital alive, and one alive at one year. Survival at one year was 12. 5 % including out of hospital cases and 15. 0 % not including these cases. Each hospital year averaged 30 survivors at one year: three who had an arrest outside hospital, seven who had one in the accident and emergency department, seven in the cardiac care unit, 10 in the general wards, and three in other, non-ward areas. Within the hospitals survival rates were best in those who had an arrest in the accident and emergency department, the cardiac care unit, or other specialised units. Outcome varied 12 -fold in subgroups defined by age, type of arrest, and <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>arrest.</b> CONCLUSION [...] 71 % of the mortality at one year in patients undergoing attempted resuscitation occurred during the initial arrest.

40|$|AiM To {{describe}} {{factors associated}} with an increased chance of survival among patients suffering from an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in Sweden. Patients and Methods All patients suffering from an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, which were not crew witnessed, in Sweden and in,whom cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was attempted and who were registered in the Swedish Cardiac Arrest Registry. This registry covers about 85 % of the Swedish population and has been running since 1990. Results In all, 33 453 patients, 71 % of whom had a cardiac etiology, were included in the survey. The following were independent predictors for an increased chance of survival in order of magnitude: (1) patients found in ventricular fibrillation (odds ratio [OR] 5. 3, 95 % confidence limits [CL] 4. 2 - 6. 8), (2) the interval between call for and arrival of the ambulance {{less than or equal to}} the median (OR 3. 6, 95 % CL 2. 9 - 4. 6), (3) cardiac arrest occurred outside the home (OR 2. 2, 95 % CL 1. 9 - 2. 7), (4) cardiac arrest was witnessed (OR 2. 0, 95 % CL 1. 6 - 2. 7), (5) bystanders performing CPR before the arrival of the ambulance (OR 2. 0, 95 % CL 1. 7 - 2. 4), and (6) age less than or equal to the median (OR 1. 6, 95 % CL 1. 4 - 2. 0). When none of these factors were present, survival to 1 m was 0. 4 %; when all factors were present, survival was 23. 8 %.

40|$|Between Jan 1990 and May 1995 the Swedish Cardiac Arrest Registry {{collected}} and analysed 14, 065 standardised reports on cardiac arrests. The reports emanated from {{approximately half of}} Sweden's ambulance districts, which cover five of Sweden's 8. 7 million inhabitants. From 1983 to 1995 approximately 15 - 20 % of the inhabitants had been trained in CPR. Method: A prospective, observational study of cardiac arrests reported to the Swedish Cardiac Arrest Registry. Results: Resuscitation was attempted in 10, 966 cases. The median age was 70 years. In 70 % the arrest was witnessed, and in 43 % patients had ventricular fibril [...] lation (VF). The incidence of VF {{at the time of}} cardiac arrest was estimated to be 80 % in the cases with probable heart disease. In 1, 692 cases (15. 4 %) the patient was admitted alive in hospital and 544 patients (5. 0 %) were alive after one month. Survival to one month in the subgroup with VF was 9. 5 % and 1. 6 % for patients with non-shockable rhythm. The survivors were analysed in relation to time to defibrillation and we found a strong correlation between a short time and increased survival. Bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (B-CPR) was initiated in 36 % of the cases. In 56 % of these cases, the bystanders were lay persons and in 28 % they were medical personnel. Most of the arrests took place at home (65 %) and only 23 % of these patients were given B-CPR in contrast to cardiac arrest in other places where 53 % were given CPR. Survival to one month was significantly higher in all cases that received B-CPR (8. 2 % vs. 2. 5 %). The odds ratio for survival to one month with B-CPR was in a logistic regression analysis 2. 5 (95 % CI 1. 9 - 3. 1). Factors that were associated with the effect of B-CPR were the interval between the collapse and the start of B-CPR, the completeness of B-CPR, whether or not the bystander was a layperson, the interval between collapse and the arrival of the ambulance, age and the <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>arrest.</b> Adrenalin was given in 42 % and 48 % were intubated. Among patients given adrenalin 3. 4 % were alive after one month and among patients who were intubated 3. 6 % were alive after one month. In a multivariate analysis treatment with adrenalin and intubation were both independently associated with predictors of a lower chance of survival. Conclusion: In a survey in Sweden of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests the overall sur-vival was low (5. 0 %). Survival for the patients with VF was 9. 5 %. Initial incidence of VF was estimated to be 80 % in patients with probable heart disease. Survival decreased with increasing time to defibrillation. Bystander-CPR increased survival two to three times. Intubation and adrenalin were not associated with an increased survival...|$|E
