40|$|In the {{automated}} manufacturing environment, {{different sets of}} alternative <b>process</b> <b>plans</b> can normally be generated to manufacture each part. However, this entails considerable complexities in solving the <b>process</b> <b>plan</b> selection problem because each of these <b>process</b> <b>plans</b> demands specification of their individual and varying manufacturing costs and manufacturing resource requirements, such as machines, fixtures/jigs, and cutting tools. In this paper the problem of selecting exactly one representative from a set of alternative <b>process</b> <b>plans</b> for each part is formulated. The purpose is to minimize, for all the parts to be manufactured, the sum of both {{the costs of the}} selected <b>process</b> <b>plans</b> and the dissimilarities in their manufacturing resource requirements. The techniques of Hopfield neural network and genetic algorithm are introduced as possible approaches to solve such a problem. In particular, a hybrid Hopfield network-genetic algorithm approach is also proposed in this paper as an effective near-global optimization technique to provide a good quality solution to the <b>process</b> <b>plan</b> selection problem. The effectiveness of the proposed hybrid approach is illustrated by comparing its performance with that of some published approaches and other optimization techniques, by using several examples currently available in the literature, as well as a few randomly generated examples. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} create a <b>process</b> <b>plan</b> from a {{workpiece}} description, a human expert thinks in a special terminology with respect to the given workpiece. The steps of human thinking during the generation process of a <b>process</b> <b>plan</b> are following the principles of heuristic classification: First using feature recognition an abstraction process isrealized yielding a high level (qualitative) description of the current workpiece in terms of features. To these features certain (more or less) abstract (partial) <b>process</b> <b>plans</b> [...] the so-called skeletal plans [...] are associated. In the refinement step these skeletal plans are merged together to one complete <b>process</b> <b>plan.</b> In this paper we present a set of domain-oriented higher level representation formalisms for features and skeletal plans suitable for the modeling of this approach. When an expert 2 ̆ 7 s (process planner 2 ̆ 7 s) knowledge has been represented using these formalisms, the generation of a <b>process</b> <b>plan</b> can be achieved by heuristic classification.

40|$|This study {{seeks to}} address an {{approach}} for generating optimal <b>process</b> <b>plans</b> for multiple jobs in networked manufacturing. Because of production flexibility, generating several feasible <b>process</b> <b>plans</b> for each job is possible. Concerning the networked manufacturing mode, the specific scenario of competitive relationships, like delivery time existing between different jobs, {{should be taken}} into account in generating the optimal <b>process</b> <b>plan</b> for each job. As such, in this study, an N-person non-cooperative game-theoretic mathematical solution with complete information is proposed to generate the optimal <b>process</b> <b>plans</b> for multiple jobs. The game is divided into two kinds of sub-games, i. e. <b>process</b> <b>plan</b> decision sub-game and job scheduling sub-game. The former sub-game provides the latter ones with players while the latter ones decide payoff values for the former one to collaboratively arrive at the Nash equilibrium (NE). Endeavouring to solve this game more efficiently and effectively, a two-level nested solution algorithm using a hybrid adaptive genetic algorithm (HAGA) is developed. Finally, numerical examples are carried out to investigate the feasibility of the approach proposed in the study. © 2010 Taylor & Francis. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to: (1) {{identify}} components of school-community relations that involve administrative functions, public participation and political processes; (2) develop a practical process for improvement of school-community relations; and (3) offer strategies for implementing a positive school-community relations process. Review of literature identified three concepts of school-community relations: (1) development of school-community relations; (2) perspectives of school-community relations; and (3) approaches to the improvement of school-community relations. The three concepts were researched regarding the administrative functions, public participation, and political processes. The concepts were utilized to identify components and theoretical models to formulate a practical <b>process</b> <b>plan</b> for improvement of school-community relations. The <b>Process</b> <b>Plan</b> utilized the administrative, public participation and political dimensions as a basis for developing procedures for improvement of school-community relations. The <b>Process</b> <b>Plan</b> format consisted of six sequential processes: (1) initial planning, (2) statement of purpose and reassessment of mission, (3) assessment of community needs and desires, (4) decision-making strategies, (5) developing implementation strategies, and (6) evaluation and audit processes. Assessment of the <b>Process</b> <b>Plan</b> was conducted through utilization of a review panel selected from nationally recognized authorities in school-community relations. The review panel consisted of five individuals willing to critically review the <b>Process</b> <b>Plan</b> and respond to an openended evaluation instrument. The responses from the review panel were organized into component categories consistent with the structure of the <b>Process</b> <b>Plan</b> and utilized to evaluate the model as a viable resource for public school administrators. A comparison of item-by-item response did not yield lack of concurrence of respondents strong enough to warrant major revision of the <b>Process</b> <b>Plan.</b> A general observation was that experience with implementation would readily identify weaknesses. Responses by the review panel indicated that the more significant components of the <b>Process</b> <b>Plan</b> were: the organization, sequential progression, and goals which provided direction for many school-community areas; the administrative responsibilities and accountability component provided clear lines of reporting; and considerable degree of benefit could transpire when the community was involved. Several modifications to the <b>Process</b> <b>Plan</b> were generated by conducting the study. In addition to vital as the modifications generated by analysis of responses by the review panel several modifications resulted from experiences of conducting the research coupled with doctoral committee member interaction. Based upon the findings of the study the following conclusions were drawn: 1. The school-community relations concept encompasses a wide range of components, such as administrative function, public participation, and political processes. 2. School administrators generally have given low priority to school-community relations concepts. 3. The <b>Process</b> <b>Plan</b> will assist school administrators in implementing a continuous schoolcommunity relations program. 4. The <b>Process</b> <b>Plan</b> is one feasible alternative for improvement of school-community relations. 5. The data provided will generate increased awareness of the value of positive school community relations on the part of individuals who choose to read the study. 6.
