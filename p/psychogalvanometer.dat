I next attended a series of lectures being given by a very controversial figure, who several times emphasized that perhaps the major problem of psychotherapy was the difficulty of maintaining the communication of accurate or valid data from the patient to the therapist. ... it appeared to me that the <b>psychogalvanometer</b> showed most promise.L. Ron Hubbard told of that encounter in a 1952 recorded lecture:This machine, the electropsychometer, has been acting as a pilot since about the first of January 1952. Very early I wanted a pilot; I had to have some method of metering preclears which was not dependent at all upon opinion or judgment. And I went out and looked at the existing lie detector equipment and I could not find anything which would do a job of work. Now, Volney Mathison out on the Coast heard a talk out there one day, and I mentioned this fact. ... I had one of the fanciest electroencephalographs made and it didn’t do anything very much, police detectors didn’t do anything very much, and Mathison went to work and he floated a current within a current. This machine is relatively simple, but it’s a current floating inside another current [...]. And I am, by the way, very much indebted to Mathison just on this basis of all of a sudden having a pilot.Mathison began working with Hubbard in 1951 and that year filed application for his first E-meter patent, [...] [...] After the partnership broke up in 1954, Mathison continued improving his E-meters with additional patents ( [...] , [...] ), marketing them through his own company and publications, retaining many of the concepts and terms from his time with Hubbard.|$|E
50|$|Hathaway {{was born}} in Central Lake, Michigan {{and grew up in}} Marysville, Ohio. He {{graduated}} from Ohio University, then completed master's degree in 1928 at Ohio State University and in 1932 took his PhD at the University of Minnesota. Hathaway joined the faculty at Minnesota, where he created the MMPI with his colleague J. C. McKinley. He also created several devices for the measurement of neural processes. Upon creating a <b>psychogalvanometer,</b> he used it as a lie detector test to solve a murder case.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} bachelor’s thesis was {{to clarify}} the {{phenomenon}} called psychogalvanic reflex, describe mechanism of its origin, its affects and use in practice. It analyzes {{the structure of the}} skin and its properties in terms of conducting electrical current, describes the phenomenon itself and discusses the conditions for its measurement. The practical part is devoted to the concept and realization of a simple <b>psychogalvanometer.</b> This device is connected with PC and acquired signal is processed by LabView...|$|E

In the theoretical section we discuss the structure of skin, the mechanism formation skin resistence and its influence on skin appendages. It also deals with various ways to capture this reflex and factors affecting their own measurements. Described {{are the most common}} types of electrodes, which when taking psychogalvanic reflex use. Last chapter deals with the block diagram <b>psychogalvanometer...</b>|$|E
