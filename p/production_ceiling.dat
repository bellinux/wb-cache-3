40|$|Due {{to strong}} changes in general {{economic}} conditions and increasing market volatility, {{a higher level}} of investments and disinvestments in the dairy sector can be observed.

The model considers disinvestment besides investment options and, moreover, allows the integration and assessment of different market interventions that are relevant to the dairy sector. According to the results, <b>production</b> <b>ceilings</b> and investment subsidies are preferable to price floors because the welfare is less reduced for a given stimulation of the willingness to invest. Moreover, it is shown that not considering disinvestment options, which in reality often exist, can lead to incorrect valuations of investment strategies at firm level and incorrect policy impact analyses at macroeconomic level...|$|R

Nitrogen pollution and its emissions are difficult to control, because they are associated {{with two of the}} most important human needs i. e. food and energy. In the Netherlands, several measures have been taken to decrease emissions with varying success. So far policy has been focussed on individual environmental issues related to specific sources. This paper summarises the results of a study to analyse the nitrogen problem in the Netherlands in an integrated way All relevant aspects are taken into account simultaneously. This was done by deriving regional agricultural nitrogen <b>production</b> <b>ceilings,</b> including all relevant nitrogen flows in agriculture and most relevant effects, i. e. protection of ground and surface water from nitrate pollution and N-eutrophication, controlling NH 3 volatilisation in view of impacts on terrestrial ecosystems and reducing NOx and N 2 O emissions in view of climate change policies. For agriculture, nitrogen ceilings provide a good basis for regulating nitrogen through fertiliser use and feed import. Results show that reactive nitrogen production in the Netherlands should be decreased by 50 – 70 % in order to reach the ceilings necessary to protect the environment against nitrogen pollution from agriculture...|$|R

40|$|Within {{the present}} {{national}} and European context {{the results of}} this evaluation point out that the Dutch manure policy has reached a decisive stage. The high nitrate concentrations in groundwater decreased substantially, but exceedance of the European standard of 50 mg/l persists on soils sensitive to nitrate leaching. The nitrogen surpluses will have to go down by several tens of kg/ha before the nitrate standard will be reached. Although the agricultural sector managed to bring down the phosphorus surpluses by 30 % since 1997, soils are still accumulating phosphorus, and leaching of phosphorus did not decrease. The policy goals of MINAS, the loss standards for nitrogen and phosphorus, were achieved. However, the underlying environmental goal, a tight balance between nutrient application and crop removal, was not reached. The manure contracting system did not have any limiting effect on manure production, because the dairy farmers had to contract only 85 % of the nitrogen production in manure. The system of Manure <b>production</b> <b>ceilings</b> was very effective as it prevented the large and economically vital farms to increase their livestock numbers. In October 2003 MINAS was rejected by the European court of justice as a proper implementation of the Nitrate Directive. Hereafter the Dutch government decided to abandon MINAS in 2006, and the Manure contracting system in 2005. In 2006 the Netherlands will adopt a manure policy based on application standards instead of standards for mineral losses. The new manure policy, including application limits for nitrogen in manure and fertilisers as required by the Nitrate Directive, will set tighter limits to the use of nitrogen and phosphorus than the present MINAS...|$|R

Chalabi argued that higher oil prices would help Iraq increase its revenues and pay back its US$60 billion debt. However, given its large downstream petroleum industry, Kuwait was less concerned about the prices of crude oil and in 1989, Kuwait requested OPEC to increase the country's total oil <b>production</b> <b>ceiling</b> by 50% to 1.35 million bpd. Throughout much of the 1980s, Kuwait's oil production was considerably above its mandatory OPEC quota and this had prevented a further increase in crude oil prices. A lack of consensus among OPEC members undermined Iraq's efforts to end the oil glut and consequently prevented the recovery of its war-crippled economy.

40|$|It is {{agreed that}} {{agriculture}} provides avenues for impoverished households {{to produce and}} trade {{their way out of}} poverty. However, this requires market access and value chain integration of small-scale farmers. This paper explores the possibilities for integration of small-scale farmers into the mainstream commercial broiler value chain in South Africa. Production costs of small-scale producers are evaluated within the context of their commercial counterparts, with a case study approach. It revealed that small-scale producers pay more for inputs but also receive a substantial premium for sales of live birds in the informal market. This results in attractive gross margins for small-scale producers. There is, however, a <b>production</b> <b>ceiling,</b> due to demand and production considerations, associated with small-scale broiler production. This ultimately results in a dualistic industry with an informal (live sale) value chain at the one end of the spectrum and a sophisticated large-scale commercial value chain at the other. Given the salient production features and investment requirements associated with large-scale broiler production, organic growth from the small-scale value chain into the commercial value chain seems improbable. The dual nature of this industry should therefore be considered when developing policy geared towards development, poverty alleviation and value chain integration.

Key trends indicate the importance of animal agriculture as a contributor to the total diffuse agricultural nutrient loading on waters, and the need to bring these sources under control if conditions suitable for sustaining 'Good Ecological Status' under the Water Framework Directive are to be generated. The analysis highlights the importance of measuring changes in nutrient loading in relation to the catchment-specific baseline state for different water bodies. The approach is also used to forecast the likely impact of broad regional scale scenarios on nutrient export to waters and highlights the need to take sensitive land out of <b>production,</b> introduce <b>ceilings</b> on fertilizer use and stocking densities, and controls on agricultural practice in higher risk areas where intensive agriculture is combined with a low intrinsic nutrient retention capacity, although the uncertainties associated with the modelling applied at this scale should be taken into account in the interpretation of model output.

In this paper, efforts have been made to convert rattan, waste papers and starch into the <b>production</b> of <b>ceiling</b> and partitioning boards. Paper pulp was produced by chopping waste papers into smaller piece and soaked in boiled water after which it was stirred thoroughly to form paper pulp. Rattan particulate was also produced by hammering, chopping, pounding and milling of rattan canes. The rattan particles were sieved and a particle size of 437 µ was used, varying mass of paper from 300 - 400 g and particulate rattan (treated and untreated) of 2 - 8 g were mixed and bonded with starch slurry for the various samples produced. The mixtures were thoroughly mixed and poured into 150 × 50 × 30 mm detachable mould and compacted for 5 minutes using a laboratory compaction machine. The composite were allowed cure at room temperature for 21 days, after which flexural and water absorptivity tests were carried out on the samples. It was found that the composite samples ST 4 and S 5 happen to be the best in terms of flexural strength properties while the addition of rattan particulate fibre aid water repellent potential for the developed composites.
