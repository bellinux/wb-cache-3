5000|$|In power engineering, {{winding factor}} is a {{technique}} that is employed to improve the rms generated voltage or emf in a three-phase AC electrical machine so that the output voltage and hence torque {{does not have any}} harmonics in it which may reduce efficiency. This is because the armature winding of each phase is distributed in a number of slots. Since the emf induced in different slots are not in phase, their phasor sum is less than their numerical sum. This reduction factor is called distribution factor Kd. Another factor that can reduce the winding factor is when the slot pitch is smaller than the <b>pole</b> <b>pitch,</b> called pitch factor Kp. The winding factor can be calculated as Kw = Kd * Kp To calculate the winding factor, Kw=Kd X Kp [...] ----(1) Where Kd=~1 (point here {{to keep in mind is}} that all(three phase) motors are balanced systems.

40|$|Abstract—An {{expression}} for the no-load flux linkage in perma-nent-magnet (PM) machines is derived. From this expression, a method is proposed {{to increase the}} no-load flux linkage generated in a stator winding per volume of PM material. The method is suit-able for machines with short <b>pole</b> <b>pitch</b> and is applied to a trans-verse-flux machine with single-sided surface-mounted PM. The re-sult is an increase of 37 % of the no-load flux linkage per volume of PM, compared with the case of rectangular PM covering 100 % of the <b>pole</b> <b>pitch.</b> An increase of 15 % is also obtained, if compared with the common practice of using PM covering 80 % of the <b>pole</b> <b>pitch.</b> Index Terms—Permanent-magnet machines, permanent-magnet shaping, transverse-flux permanent-magnet machines...|$|E
30|$|A {{new method}} to {{compensate}} the end effect of a linear induction motor (LIM) in low-speed maglev vehicles is proposed. With this method, the motors are {{close to each other}} so that the front motor’s exit-end magnetic field extends into the next motor’s entry zone. As a result, the motor’s magnetic field traveling wave become continuous and the end effect of short primary LIMs is greatly weakened. In the analysis of the air-gap magnetic field distribution, the LIM is assumedly divided into two identical motors with the distances of 20, 40, 60, and 80 mm. The results show that the air-gap magnetic field is still continuous within these distances due to LIM’s end effect. As the distance between two motors increases, the distortion of the air-gap magnetic field becomes more severe. Then, we investigate the relationship between the secondary speed and the thrust in three cases, i.e., a single LIM, two motors divided with 72 mm with <b>pole</b> <b>pitch</b> corrected, and two motors divided with 60 mm without the <b>pole</b> <b>pitch</b> being corrected. We find that the thrust has a small decrease when the speed increases, which means that the magnetic field is already continuous and its amplitude is approximately a constant. Furthermore, the thrust loss of case 3 is more than that of case 2, which indicates that the <b>pole</b> <b>pitch</b> correction is effective.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{explores the}} use of {{quadrature}} axis flux barriers in planar linear synchronous motors.

40|$|Includes bibliographical referencesThe main {{objective}} of this dissertation is the detailed design, sizing, analysis and experimental validation of the sustainable wind generator. The proposed machine topology for the generator uses permanent magnets (PMs) from discarded hard disk drives (HDDs). The PM configuration inherently produces a non-uniform air gap flux-density distribution and the <b>pole</b> <b>pitches</b> of the PMs are relatively small. This would result to an unbalanced generator output {{and a number of}} stator inter-connecting leads, if conventional tooth-concentrated non-overlapping winding configurations are used. Hence, a concentrated full-pitch overlapping wave winding configuration is developed, which overcomes the aforementioned challenges. The proposed sustainable coreless axial flux generator is then analyzed with classical machine theory and verified by finite element analysis (FEA) software. It is shown that the traditional sizing approach for axial flux machines needs modification to accommodate the design of the proposed machine topology. For the numerical analysis, 3 D-FEA is used to verify the 2 Dmodel which is subsequently employed in the numerical analyses...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{primarily}} concerned with the practical limits, imposed by magnetic saturation and thermal considerations, of the force density in low-speed permanent-magnet electric machines. The practical force density values obtainable in integral- and fractional-slot machines are determined. The achievable force density for machines utilizing slot per pole per phase of 0. 375, 0. 5, 0. 75 and 1 are determined. The theoretical investigation covered a large range of machine sizes. For saturation reasons, shallow slots are more favourable for achieving high force densities. However for thermal reasons deeper slots become favourable. An optimum slot depth that maximises the force density for each current density level therefore exists and is determined in this thesis {{for a range of}} machines. In particular, the maximum allowable slot depth range for four low-speed applications are identified for a given maximum motor diameter. Plots of the force density against slot depth for various current densities for fixed <b>pole</b> <b>pitches</b> enabled a useful database to be established. These curves would enable one to determine if the demanding specification can be meet within a given restricted space. The slot depth required can be determined instantly for the practical allowable current density. The results presented will help the design engineer to determine if the surface mounted permanent magnet machine configuration is suitable to fulfil one's specification. If the configuration is not suitable, then other topologies must be considered. An experimental in-wheel motor, intended for wheelchair applications, was built and tested, and is shown to meet the design specifications. When assembled into the wheelchair the results were promising and showed a remarkable increase in performance compared to the existing conventional geared drive...|$|R

Recently, the use of magnetic separators to remove malaria-infected red blood cells (pRBCs) from blood circulation in patients with severe malaria has been proposed in a dialysis-like treatment. The capture efficiency of this process depends on many interrelated design variables and constraints such as magnetic <b>pole</b> array <b>pitch,</b> chamber height, and flow rate. In this paper, we model the malaria-infected RBCs (pRBCs) as paramagnetic particles suspended in a Newtonian fluid.

First-order stiff ordinary differential equations (ODEs) governing the trajectory of particles under periodic magnetic fields due to an array of wires are solved numerically using the 1 (st) - 5 (th) order adaptive step Runge-Kutta solver. The numerical experiments show that in order to achieve a capture efficiency of 99 % for the pRBCs it is required to have a longer length than 80 mm; this implies that in principle, using optimization techniques the length could be adjusted, i. e., shortened to achieve 99 % capture efficiency of the pRBCs...|$|R
