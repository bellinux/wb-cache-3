40|$|<b>Personalized</b> Web portals are {{becoming}} more and more popular. What is unsatisfying with existing sites is that the scope of the <b>personalized</b> content they provide is typically that of the underlying site. Providers of such <b>personalized</b> content typically develop their own, proprietary <b>personalized</b> Web portal. To use different personalization features of different sites users have to hop from one <b>personalized</b> site to another and provide different user profile information there. Therefore, we propose a flexible architecture in which a personalization mediator acts as a broker of modular personalization services between providers of <b>personalized</b> content and users that are interested in such <b>personalized</b> content. In this architecture, the providers of <b>personalized</b> content publish their personalization services via a unified interface to this mediator. A user provides its profile information to the mediator which in turn finds and calls the most suitable service which finally delivers the most targeted <b>personalized</b> content. The benefit of our approach is that users get an easier and unified access to a notional unlimited collection of personalization services by the mediator. For the providers, the approach allows different sites with different personalization capabilities to embed their personalization services in a generic infrastructure for applications like <b>personalized</b> Web portals...|$|R

25|$|Narrative {{games are}} those that {{generally}} favor narration over gameplay, with gameplay present to help immerse the player into the game's story. Though narrative games are similar to interactive movies in that they present pre-scripted scenes, the advancement of computing power that can render pre-scripted scenes in real-time, thus providing for more depth of gameplay that is reactive to the player. Gameplay in narrative games may include working through conversation trees, solving puzzles, or more recently, the use of quick time events to aid in action sequences to keep the player involved in the story. Frequently, these game allow for branching narratives; choices made by the player influence events throughout the game. While these choices do not alter the overall direction and major plot elements of the game's narration, they are known to help <b>personalize</b> the storm to some degree to the player's desire through the ability to choose these determinants. Most of Telltale Games, such as The Walking Dead, are narrative games, but other examples include Quantic Dream's Fahrenheit, Heavy Rain and , and Dontnod Entertainment's Life is Strange series.|$|E
25|$|That Dragon, Cancer is a {{video game}} created by Ryan and Amy Green, Josh Larson, and a small team under the name Numinous Games. The autobiographical game {{is based on the}} Greens' {{experience}} of raising their son Joel, who was diagnosed with terminal cancer at twelve months old, and though only given a short time to live, continued to survive for four more years before eventually succumbing to the cancer in March 2014. The game is designed to have the player experience the low and high moments of this period in the style of a point-and-click adventure game, using the medium's interactivity and immersion to relate the tale in ways that a film cannot. It was initially developed to relate Ryan and Amy's personal experience with Joel when they were uncertain of his health, but following his death, they reworked much of the game to memorialize and <b>personalize</b> their time and interactions with Joel for the player. Alongside the game, a documentary, Thank You for Playing, documenting both the last few years of Joel's life and the development of the game, has been filmed to be aired in 2016.|$|E

25|$|Of {{the game}} types they explored, Team 5 soon {{focused on the}} {{collectible}} card game approach, given that many on the team and in Blizzard had played such games since their introduction. The team found it natural to build the card game around the existing Warcraft lore; according to production director Jason Chayes, Warcraft was already a well-known property, {{and the depth of}} characters and locations created for other games in that series made it easy to create cards inspired by those. They also saw that new players to Warcraft may be drawn into the other games through playing Hearthstone. The team was able to pull concepts and art from the pre-existing World of Warcraft Trading Card Game, first published in 2006 by Upper Deck and later by Cryptozoic Entertainment; when Hearthstone was near completion, in 2013, Blizzard terminated its license with Cryptozoic as to favor their pending digital card game. The addition of heroes, an aspect from the previous trading card game, was found to help <b>personalize</b> the game for the player to allow players to discover useful combinations of cards for each hero.|$|E
