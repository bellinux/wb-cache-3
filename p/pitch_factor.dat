5000|$|In power engineering, {{winding factor}} is a {{technique}} that is employed to improve the rms generated voltage or emf in a three-phase AC electrical machine so that the output voltage and hence torque {{does not have any}} harmonics in it which may reduce efficiency. This is because the armature winding of each phase is distributed in a number of slots. Since the emf induced in different slots are not in phase, their phasor sum is less than their numerical sum. This reduction factor is called distribution factor Kd. Another factor that can reduce the winding factor is when the slot pitch is smaller than the pole pitch, called <b>pitch</b> <b>factor</b> Kp. The winding factor can be calculated as Kw = Kd * Kp To calculate the winding factor, Kw=Kd X Kp [...] ----(1) Where Kd=~1 (point here {{to keep in mind is}} that all(three phase) motors are balanced systems.

40|$|Background: Concerns exist {{regarding}} {{the effect of}} radiation dose from paediatric pelvic CT scans and the potential later risk of radiation-induced neoplasm and teratogenic outcomes in these patients. Objective: To assess the diagnostic quality of CT images of the paediatric pelvis using either reduced mAs or increased pitch compared with standard settings. Materials and methods: A prospective study of pelvic CT scans of 105 paediatric patients was performed using one of three protocols: (1) 31 at a standard protocol of 200 mA with rotation time of 0. 75 s at 120 kVp and a <b>pitch</b> <b>factor</b> approximating 1. 4; (2) 31 at increased <b>pitch</b> <b>factor</b> approaching 2 and 200 mA; and (3) 43 at a reduced setting of 100 mA and a <b>pitch</b> <b>factor</b> of 1. 4. All other settings remained the same in all three groups. Image quality was assessed by radiologists blinded to the protocol used in each scan. Results: No {{significant difference was found}} between the quality of images acquired at standard settings and those acquired at half the standard mAs. The use of increased <b>pitch</b> <b>factor</b> resulted in a higher proportion of poor images. Conclusions: Images acquired at 120 kVp using 75 mAs are equivalent in diagnostic quality to those acquired at 150 mAs.

40|$|Purpose: To analyse the {{temporal}} resolution (TR) of modern computed tomography (CT) scanners using the impulse method, {{and assess the}} actual maximum TR at respective helical acquisition modes. Methods: To assess the actual TR of helical acquisition modes of a 128 -slice dual source CT (DSCT) scanner and a 320 -row area detector CT (ADCT) scanner, we assessed the TRs of various acquisition combinations of a <b>pitch</b> <b>factor</b> (P) and gantry rotation time (R).

The maximum TR values of single- and dual-source helical acquisition modes for the 128 -slice DSCT scanner were 0. 138 (R/. P = 0. 285 / 1. 5) and 0. 074. s (R/.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to propose a method for {{assessing}} the temporal resolution (TR) of multi-detector row computed tomography (CT) (MDCT) in the helical acquisition mode using temporal impulse signals generated by a metal ball passing through the acquisition plane. An 11 -mm diameter metal ball was shot along the central axis at approximately 5 m/s during a helical acquisition, and the temporal sensitivity profile (TSP) was measured from the streak image intensities in the reconstructed helical CT images. To assess the validity, we compared the measured and theoretical TSPs for the 4 -channel modes of two MDCT systems. A 64 -channel MDCT system was used to compare TSPs and image quality of a motion phantom for the pitch factors P of 0. 6, 0. 8, 1. 0 and 1. 2 with a rotation time R of 0. 5 s, and for two R/. P combinations of 0. 5 / 1. 2 and 0. 33 / 0. 8. Moreover, the temporal transfer functions (TFs) were calculated from the obtained TSPs. The measured and theoretical TSPs showed perfect agreement. The TSP narrowed with an increase in the <b>pitch</b> <b>factor.</b> The image sharpness of the 0. 33 / 0. 8 combination was inferior to that of the 0. 5 / 1. 2 combination, despite their almost identical full width at tenth maximum values.

The accomplishments of this thesis include: Experimental measurement of the azimuthal emission non-uniformity of the MIG gun; Simulation of the beam quality of the MIG gun using MICHELLE 3 -D, the first simulation of a MIG electron beam with azimuthal non-uniformity; Benchmarking the MICHELLE 3 -D code to other established gun optics codes; Evaluation of the effects on the velocity spread and <b>pitch</b> <b>factor</b> of azimuthal non-uniformity in the MIG gun, showing that the direct effect on the beam quality is very small; Design, fabrication, and testing in the gyrotron of a capacitive probe system divided into four quadrants to measure azimuthal asymmetries of the electron beam; Use of the capacitive probes to measure low-frequency (100 - 160 MHz) oscillations on the beam, the first measurement of such oscillations in a microsecond pulse length gyrotron; First results on testing a new MIG cathode for emission non-uniformity using a special test chamber built by Calabazas Creek Research. (cont.) This research will contribute {{to our understanding of the}} properties of intense electron beams produced by MIG guns in high-power gyrotrons. MIG's are widely used in gyrotron oscillators and amplifiers for fusion applications to create a beam of gyrating electrons generally operating in the temperature limited regime of emission. Due to this dependence on the temperature of the cathode, variation of the emitter surface temperature will result in inhomogeneous emission. Non-uniform emission is attributed to a deviation in the cathode work function as well. Studies have shown this inhomogeneous beam current density can lead to increased mode competition and velocity spread contributing to an overall decreased efficiency of the gyrotron. This research focuses on the effects on velocity spread and in turn the efficiency of the device from non-uniform current emission. Initially, we measured experimentally the detailed azimuthal non-uniformity profile of an existing 110 GHz gyrotron oscillator at MIT. Using a rotating collector current probe the current density of different emitter angles was extracted. These results agreed fairly well with previous measurements of Anderson et al. (cont.) This non-uniformity profile was then used with a 3 -D simulation code to do the first complete 3 -D model from the cathode to the cavity of a MIG. In order to investigate these effects of beam non-uniformity with simulation, we use MICHELLE 3 -D developed by SAIC. MICHELLE 3 -D has been benchmarked to MICHELLE 2 -D and EGUN in the case of a uniform beam. The non-uniform beam measurements are entered into MICHELLE and results are computed at four different azimuthal quadrants of different current densities and for the overall beam, giving special attention to the differences in the beam <b>pitch</b> <b>factor</b> and perpendicular velocity spread. MICHELLE found azimuthal non-uniformity to be a fairly small effect on the overall beam quality. Concurrently with the MICHELLE 3 -D simulations, segmented <b>pitch</b> <b>factor</b> probes are implemented to measure the <b>pitch</b> <b>factor</b> in the four azimuthal quadrants. In an attempt to compare with MICHELLE's results, these four capacitive probes measure the induced image charge of different azimuthal sections of the electron beam, enabling an estimation of differences in the <b>pitch</b> <b>factor</b> between quadrants. (cont.) Unfortunately, the experimental error is found to be quite high (± 15 %) rendering differences in the <b>pitch</b> <b>factor</b> to be contained within the error boundaries. Though the capacitive probes are found to have too much error for adequate resolution of the <b>pitch</b> <b>factor,</b> they are also used to discover the first observations of low-frequency oscillations in a short pulse MW gyrotron. These frequencies, from 100 - 160 MHz, are found to be dependent on the beam parameters such as the beam voltage, current, magnetic field, and magnetic compression ratio. The frequency range is remarkably close to the frequency of an electron in the adiabatic trap and the experimental as well as the predicted theoretical oscillation behavior of trapped electrons are discussed. Last, initial progress has been made to test three new cathodes on the Calabazas Creek Research cathode tester. This tester is a dedicated test stand for azimuthal non-uniformity able to obtain a measurement directly at the cathode instead of at the collector end of the device. The setup procedure and results on the first cathode test for the 96 kV, 40 amp gun are reported and future tests are summarized. by Chad D. Marchewka. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|Purpose: To {{identify}} {{the impact of}} different pitch values on image quality and effective radiation dose for axial and coronal plane in abdominal adult CT. Methods and materials: Three scans were conducted on an abdominal phantom using a Toshiba Aquilion 16 -slice CT scanner with three different pitch values: standard (0. 938), detail (0. 688) and fast (1. 438). Slices {{were taken from the}} upper, middle and lower abdomen in the axial plane and anterior, middle and posterior in the coronal plane. The six different anatomical structures were liver, intrahepatic vessels, spleen, pancreas, kidneys and renal vessels, retroperitoneum, aorta and vena cava. A two-alternative forced-choice (2 AFC) method was used to evaluate images for each pitch with 8 observers using a 3 -point Likert scale. SNR was calculated in every plane, slice and <b>pitch</b> <b>factor</b> using the ImageJ software. To estimate effective radiation dose the CT Expo software was used. Results: Detail <b>pitch</b> <b>factor</b> provides superior image quality compared to standard in axial plane when evaluating the liver (p< 0. 034) and pancreas (p= 0. 008). However, the results for spleen, kidney, renal vessels, retroperitoneum, aorta and vena cava are not significant when comparing detail vs standard. Standard provides a 26. 3 % reduction in effective radiation dose (mSv) compared to detail. Fast had the worst image quality in both the axial and coronal plane but the lowest dose. In the coronal plane, standard was superior to both detail (p= 0. 026) and fast (p= 0. 023) in terms of image quality. The differences in SNR results were not significant except in standard vs detail in the coronal plane (p= 0. 03). Conclusion: Detail <b>pitch</b> <b>factor</b> provides superior image quality to standard and fast in the axial plane. Standard had superior image quality to both detail and fast in the coronal plane. The augmentation of effective doses has been inversely proportional to the pitch factors.

Images were reconstructed with an interval of 1 mm. Sagittal and coronal multiplanar reconstructions of the primary and reconstructed data set were performed. For MS-CT a tube current resulting in equivalent image noise as with SS-CT was used. All images were judged by two observers using a 4 -point scale. The best image quality for SS-CT was achieved with the smallest slice thickness (1 mm) and a pitch smaller than 2 resulting in a table speed of up to 2 mm per gantry rotation (4 points). A reduction of the slice thickness rather than of the table speed proved to be beneficial at MS-CT. Therefore, the optimal scan protocol in MS-CT included a slice thickness of 1. 25 mm with a table speed of 7. 5 mm/ 360 degrees using a pitch of 1. 5 (4 points), resulting in a faster scan time than when a pitch of 0. 75 (4 points) was used. This study indicates that MS-CT could provide equivalent image quality at approximately four times the volume coverage speed of SS-CT...|$|R
40|$|Dutch {{qualifies as}} a double {{negation}} language, but single negation readings are found in certain environments, under conditions that are not well understood. The combination of corpus research and a production experiment carried out in this paper reveals a surprising amount of variation, and points towards a subtle interplay of lexical factors (choice of negative expression and combinations thereof), syntactic factors (word order and adjacency), and prosodic <b>factors</b> (<b>pitch</b> accent on first/second negative) in Dutch sentences with multiple negative expressions...|$|R
40|$|The {{fabrication}} of gallium-nitride (GaN) -based light-emitting diode (LED) arrays by a direct writing technique, itself using micron-sized LEDs (micro-LEDs), is reported. CMOSdriven ultraviolet GaN-based micro-LED arrays {{are used to}} pattern photoresist layers with feature sizes as small as 500 nm. Checkerboard-type square LED array devices are then fabricated using such photoresist patterns based on either single pixel or multipixel direct writing, and implemented {{as part of a}} completely mask-less process flow. These exemplar arrays are composed of either 450 -nm-emitting 199 × 199 μm 2 pixels on a 200 -μm pitch or 520 -nm-emitting 21 × 18 μm 2 pixels on a 23 -μm <b>pitch.</b> Fill <b>factors</b> of 99 % and 71. 5 % are achieved with optical output power densities per pixel of 5 and 20 W/cm 2 at 90 - and 6 -mA dc-injected currents, respectively...|$|R
