50|$|There is an {{existence}} of a dual housing market that results in unequal housing opportunities for different populations of people. The basis of the dual housing market model is that similar housing opportunities are available to different racial groups at different prices. There are many explanations for the {{existence of}} a dual housing market. One theory explains the dual housing market through racial steering. This occurs when real estate brokers steer their clients to specific geographic locations of available housing based on race. Although racial discrimination in housing market processes is outlawed by several court decisions and legislation, there is evidence that it still occurs. For example, an HUD Housing Market <b>Practice</b> <b>survey</b> found that African Americans felt discriminated against in the renting and/or buying process of housing. Institutional factors, such as realtor agencies withholding housing information or financial institutions denying mortgages, further perpetuate the effects of the dual housing market model.|$|E

40|$|Whilst {{language}} is {{the means by}} which facilitation is realised, there has been little research to date investigating language use in facilitation. Through the design of an online reflective <b>practice</b> <b>survey,</b> this paper explores facilitators ’ perceptions of language use in facilitation. The paper presents results from the online reflective <b>practice</b> <b>survey</b> involving 140 facilitators from around the world. The paper establishes that like the language of business, or the language of politics, there may be an emerging language of facilitation, with facilitators implicitly understanding what it means to “speak facilitatively”. Indeed, speaking facilitatively appears to be based on respect and can be characterised by the use of linguistic politeness devices. While spoken language plays an important part in facilitation, our survey participants strongly indicated that body {{language is}} as important as spoken language, and that spoken language is only a part of the ‘complete facilitation package’. Finally, the use of metaphor for investigating facilitator styles is found to be a useful tool for revealing core facilitator values...|$|E

Elementary educators (Level- 1 n = 2, 109, Level- 2 n = 62) completed the survey in September/October of 2007, September/October of 2008 (Level- 1 n = 1, 940, Level- 2 n = 61), and January/February of 2010 (Level- 1 n = 2, 058, Level- 2 n = 60). Multilevel exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis procedures were used to examine the construct validity and reliability of the instrument. Results supported a correlated four-factor model: Tiers I 2 ̆ 6 II Problem Solving, Tier III Problem Identification, Tier III Problem Analysis 2 ̆ 6 Intervention Procedures, and Tier III Evaluation of Response to Intervention. Composite reliability estimates for all factors across the three years approximated or exceeded. 84.

The AAAS report was developed by a diverse panel of experts in the area of describing college-level STEM. Although we are not aware of any relevant surveys that the AAAS report missed, we are aware of two relevant surveys that have been disseminated since the AAAS report: the Teaching Practices Inventory (TPI; Wieman & Gilbert 2014) and the Postsecondary Instructional <b>Practices</b> <b>Survey</b> (PIPS; Walter et al. 2014). These instruments were included in our analysis because, had they been available at the time, they likely would have been included in the AAAS report (Smith et al. 2014; Walter et al. 2014).|$|R

40|$|This {{publication}} {{presents the}} findings from a systemic review of knowledge relating to current practice in the teaching, learning and assessment of law in social work education. The work was commissioned by Social Care Institute for Excellence (SCIE) {{as part of its}} research programme to support the introduction from 2003 onwards of new social work degree qualifications in the United Kingdom. The review comprised two pieces of research, an international research review and a UK-based <b>practice</b> <b>survey.</b> The research review has evaluated relevant published and unpublished materials. The <b>practice</b> <b>survey</b> has identified the range of approaches taken within programmes, and the views of those involved in teaching, learning and assessment, including educators, students and practice teachers.

Guidance from SCIE (2003) clearly identifies the value of participation by a wide range of stakeholders in its commissioned work. Equally, the participation of service users and carers, and of employers, is a core requirement for the social work degree across the UK. The research has adopted a broad and inclusive approach.
