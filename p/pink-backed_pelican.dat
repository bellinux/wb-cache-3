500|$|The diet of {{pelicans}} usually {{consists of}} fish, but occasionally amphibians, turtles, crustaceans, insects, {{birds and mammals}} are also eaten. The size of the preferred prey fish varies depending on pelican species and location. For example, in Africa the <b>pink-backed</b> <b>pelican</b> generally takes fish {{ranging in size from}} fry up to [...] and the great white pelican prefers somewhat larger fish, up to , but in Europe the latter species has been recorded taking fish up to [...] In deep water, white pelicans often fish alone. Nearer the shore, several will encircle schools of small fish or form a line to drive them into the shallows, beating their wings on the water surface and then scooping up the prey. Although all pelican species may feed in groups or alone, the Dalmantian, pink-backed and spot-billed pelicans are the only to prefer solitary feeding. When fishing in groups, all pelican species have been known to work together to catch their prey, and Dalmantian pelicans may even cooperate with great cormorants. They catch multiple small fish by expanding the throat pouch, which must be drained above the water surface before swallowing. This operation takes up to a minute, during which time other seabirds may steal the fish.|$|E

House crows are present since the 1970s.|$|E
50|$|In 1931, Peters {{separated}} the American white pelican and the brown pelican (including the Peruvian pelican), into monospeciﬁc subgenera. This classification was also supported by Dorst and Mougin in 1979. The spot-billed pelican and the <b>pink-backed</b> <b>pelican,</b> which are small tree nesters, {{were considered to}} be sister species by Elliott in 1992 and Nelson in 2005, and the brown and the Peruvian pelicans were held to be the most divergent of all. In 1993, Johnsgard hypothesized that the pelicans derived from a south Asian or African ancestor, and spread out through northern Asia and Australia before ﬁnally coming to North America. This would imply that unless the brown pelican and the American white pelican resulted from multiple invasions of North America, they would have sister taxa. However, trees derived from genetic data disagree. In 1990, Sibley and Ahlquist's UPGMA (Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean) tree based on DNA-DNA hybridization data omitted the Peruvian, Dalmatian, and spot-billed pelicans, but implied different relationships: unexpectedly, the American white and the <b>pink-backed</b> <b>pelican</b> were sister species, this pair being sister to the great white pelican and, in turn, this triplet being sister to the Australian pelican, with the brown pelican being the most divergent.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the time}} of its opening in 1930, the zoo had two apes, a peacock, a deer, a mule, magpies, and guinea pigs. Today, the zoo has animals from all over the world, approx. 2,000 {{different}} animals, covering 147 species such as chimpanzee, monkeys, ring-tailed lemur, Siberian tiger, Grévy's zebra, giraffe, red panda, West Indian manatee, ostrich, penguins, <b>pink-backed</b> <b>pelican,</b> greater flamingo, macaws and Aldabra giant tortoise. In 2001, Odense Zoo inaugurated a DKK 60 million [...] "Oceanium" [...] featuring South American animal life, ranging from the Amazon Rainforest to Antarctica.|$|E
50|$|The <b>pink-backed</b> <b>pelican</b> {{is found}} {{in a range of}} aquatic habitats, but prefers quiet backwaters with shallow water, {{avoiding}} steep, vegetated lake banks. It prefers for freshwater lakes, swamps, large slow-flowing rivers, and seasonal pools but also frequents reservoirs, seasonally flooded land and flood-plains near river mouths. It may occur on alkaline and saline lakes and lagoons, and can sometimes be found along the coast in bays and estuaries (although seldom on open seashore). The species tends to roost and breed in trees (e.g. mangroves), but will also roost on sandy islands, cliffs, coral reefs and sand-dunes.|$|E
50|$|The bird {{sanctuary}} has about 165 species of birds; the lesser and greater flamingos, great white pelican (Pelecanus onocrotalus) and <b>pink-backed</b> <b>pelican</b> (Pelecanus rufescens) {{are the most}} dominant species, they arrive annually in large numbers {{as part of their}} migration during the winter season. Some of the other notable bird species recorded are: avocet, blackwinged stilt (Himantopus himantopus), blacksmith lapwing (Vanellus armatus), black-necked grebe (Podiceps nigricollis), bustards, carmine, darters, African fish eagle (Haliaeetus vocifer), geese, korhaans, pied kingfisher (Ceryle rudis), black-chested snake-eagle (Circaetus pectoralis), blue-cheeked bee-eater (Merops persicus), Cape teal (Anas capensis), kori bustard (Ardeotis kori), Hottentot teal (Anas hottentota), martial eagle (Polemaetus bellicosus), red-knobbed coot, (Fulica cristata), secretarybird (Sagittarius serpentarius), spoonbills, and white-faced whistling duck (Dendrocygna viduata).|$|E
50|$|The {{great white}} pelican is {{distinguished}} {{from all other}} pelicans by its plumage. The face is naked and the feathering on its forehead tapers to a fine point, whereas the other pelican species are completely feathered. In flight, the white underwing with black remiges of the adult, is similar to only the American white pelican (P. erythrorhynchos), but the latter has white inner secondary feathers. It differs from the Dalmatian pelican, by its pure white, rather than greyish-white plumage, a bare pink facial patch around the eye, and pinkish legs. The spot-billed pelican of Asia is slightly smaller than the great white pelican, with greyish tinged white plumage, and a paler, duller-colored bill. Similarly, the <b>pink-backed</b> <b>pelican</b> is smaller, with brownish-grey plumage, a light pink to off-grey bill, and a pinkish wash on the back.|$|E
50|$|The diet of {{pelicans}} usually {{consists of}} fish, but occasionally amphibians, turtles, crustaceans, insects, {{birds and mammals}} are also eaten. The size of the preferred prey fish varies depending on pelican species and location. For example, in Africa the <b>pink-backed</b> <b>pelican</b> generally takes fish {{ranging in size from}} fry up to 400 g and the great white pelican prefers somewhat larger fish, up to 600 g, but in Europe the latter species has been recorded taking fish up to 1850 g. In deep water, white pelicans often fish alone. Nearer the shore, several will encircle schools of small fish or form a line to drive them into the shallows, beating their wings on the water surface and then scooping up the prey. Although all pelican species may feed in groups or alone, the Dalmantian, pink-backed and spot-billed pelicans are the only to prefer solitary feeding.

40|$|Habitat change, {{mainly through}} {{the actions of}} humans, {{poses a threat to}} great white (Pelecanus onocrotalus) and pink-backed (P. rufescens) {{pelicans}} in northeastern KwaZulu-Natal, the southernmost distributions of these species on Africa’s eastern seaboard. This study assessed the relative importance and state of the potential pelican habitat in the northeastern KwaZulu-Natal region, focusing particularly on Lake St Lucia and the Phongolo River floodplain. Great white pelicans breed on islands in Lake St Lucia. Should these islands be lost through falling water levels or their becoming joined to mainland by deposits of silt, or by flooding, no suitable habitat for their breeding will remain in the region. By contrast, the <b>pink-backed</b> <b>pelican</b> nests in trees, and there appears to be plentiful alternative habitat. Lake St Lucia and, to a lesser extent, the Phongolo River floodplain, are important foraging areas for both pelican species. The hydrology of both these systems has been affected by human activities. </strong...|$|E
40|$|MSc., Faculty of Science, University of the Witwatersrand, 2011 A {{selection}} of southern African bird species were modelled {{in terms of}} the probability of these species colliding with or being electrocuted on overhead power lines in South Africa, based on morphological and behavioral factors. Species were included in the model on the basis of internationally recognized vulnerability to these interactions at the family level. The collision model performed poorly when tested against the actual reported mortalities for species contained in the Eskom-EWT Strategic Partnership Central Incident Register CIR) (chi-square of goodness of fit) at the individual species, family and within family levels. The electrocution model performed slightly better at the family, and within family level. Both collision and electrocution models performed better for the physically larger species (and families) and for those species with higher modelled probability of collision or electrocution. As the product of random carcass detection and reporting, the CIR data are biased in various ways. Testing the models against the CIR is therefore equally important for highlighting inadequacies in the CIR, as in the model. A number of new species have emerged as being of high collision (including most importantly African Pygmy Goose, Southern Ground Hornbill, Black-bellied Bustard, Yellow-throated Sandgrouse, Caspian Tern, Hooded Vulture, Bateleur, African Marsh Harrier, Black Harrier, <b>Pink-backed</b> <b>Pelican</b> and Yellow-billed Stork) or electrocution (Southern Bald Ibis) probability in theoretical terms, and will require further investigation to determine their actual probability of interaction. By mapping the combined distributions of those species with high probabilities of collision and/or electrocution mortality, a number of priority high risk geographic areas emerge around the country...|$|E
