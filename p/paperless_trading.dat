Based on the review of <b>paperless</b> <b>trade</b> initiatives and assessment of <b>paperless</b> <b>trade</b> readiness of countries in the Asia and Pacific region, the paper identifies five critical challenges in facilitating cross-border paperless trade: use of common international standards, harmonization of different legal frameworks, capacity gaps among the parties, cooperation {{between the public and}} private sectors, and lack of coordination mechanisms for cross-border data exchanges. For each challenge, the paper describes its nature and possible measures for alleviating it.

Due to the short delays imposed by Customs, the trend is still toward <b>paperless</b> <b>trading.</b> As a consequence, a better process and software interoperability is needed between the different actors of trading (customer, supplier, Customs [...] .); a first step in software interoperability consists in process modeling.

40|$|Increasingly, large retail {{companies}} {{are finding that}} the traditional vision of Electronic Data Interchange using a Value Added Network with expensive message translation software and private wide area networks, is unable to deliver its promise of <b>paperless</b> <b>trading</b> with their suppliers. While many have achieved {{a high level of}} EDI compliance from large suppliers, many unsophisticated, usually small, suppliers remain outside their electronic commerce network creating a barrier to achieving the most important business re-engineering benefits which require 100 % compliance. Many large retailers are turning to the diverse range of Internet-based document distribution and presentation systems which have recently appeared to provide new ways of including unsophisticated traders in their replenishment systems. In this paper we argue that the traditional EDI vision emerged through the interaction of a number of aspects of the replenishment problem context, namely available technology, transaction cost structure, the power of message transmission intermediaries, notions about how to achieve supply chain cooperation, and the shared understandings of correct electronic commerce practice within the industry. The traditional EDI vision achieved only partial supply chain compliance because it failed to tak...|$|E
40|$|For {{many large}} retail {{companies}} with many suppliers, the utopian vision of total <b>paperless</b> <b>trading</b> offered by traditional Electronic Data Interchange (EDI), with its attendant efficiencies, {{has not been}} realized. Many small, but operationally important suppliers, lack enthusiasm for traditional EDI because it is expensive, complicated and they stand to gain little from it. This non-compliance prevents the large organization from realizing {{some of the most}} significant tactical benefits of EDI such as advanced supply chain reforms. This paper presents a case study of a large retail organization which is approaching this problem by integrating Internet based EDI with its existing traditional EDI systems using an “intelligent gateway ” concept. This will allow them to leverage their considerable existing EDI investment by providing a relatively low cost data display and entry system tailored to the needs of small suppliers. In this way, greater benefits should accrue from existing investment as 100 % EDI compliance eliminates duplication, but more importantly, enables advanced supply chain reforms such as “cross docking”. We argue that this way of using the newly available Internet EDI products may have the greatest economic impact on the retailing supply chain at least in the near future...|$|E

[...] The enormous costs arising from the exchange of billions of trade-related documents, as well as the complexity of international trade documents and procedures, are a huge burden on businesses, and a major disincentive to many small firms for participating in international trade.

40|$|The Japan-Philippines Economic Partnership Agreement is envisioned {{to further}} boost Japan's ODA to the Philippines, {{particularly}} for capital {{formation in the}} infrastructure sector. It will stimulate an increase in investment and capital accumulation causing more employment opportunities to be created. Output capacity will expand and so with cost of production. Moreover, export volume will increase at lower prices, thus enhancing competitiveness in the world market. Trade and business facilitation particularly among Japanese firms in the Philippines will be further enhanced due to an improvement in infrastructure and other support services, for instance, farm-to-market roads, energy, power and telecommunication, irrigation and information technology. Potential economic gains on technical assistance and development cooperation for capacity-building {{in the fields of}} information and communication technology, science and technology, intellectual property, human resource development and the enhancement of the country 9 ̆ 2 s capacity to design an appropriate competition policy are evident from the Agreement.

40|$|Communication {{technology}} {{has always been}} important to a company. As this technology developed, it is increasingly {{being used as a}} strategic tool to re-engineer a business process and to gain competitive advantage. A majority of businesses and consumers have embraced electronic commerce (E-commerce) or “information exchange through an electronic means” to various extent. The electronic communications include E-mail, the internet, electronic fund transfer, electronic bulletin boards, file transfer protocols, barcodes for goods labeling and delivery, interactive voice response and electronic data interchange (EDI). EDI is about doing business and carrying out transactions with trading partners electronically. It is a <b>paperless</b> <b>trading</b> method and therefore an important foundation block for the implementation of Ebusiness. To harness the capability of EDI, Malaysian ports such as Port Klang was facilitated with the national EDI, Dagang*Net under the government’s trade facilitation program. The government hopes that EDI applications will bring about greater efficiency and productivity and also be able to respond to the needs and changing requirements of the trade if a port is to become a major port of call for shipping lines the world over. The advancement in information and communication technology (ICT) coupled with the intensification of ICT applications by all sectors prompted by the Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC) initiatives has propelled Malaysia into another level of technology exploitation – E-commerce. An understanding of their current status is essential for the success of any E-commerce initiatives in Malaysia. Thus this study seeks to provide such an empirical base. This study found that in the Malaysian shipping industry, EDI was primarily used in transactions with the Customs Department for duty payments and import/export declaration. The results indicated that EDI usage at Port Klang might be high in terms of volume. However, its use was still very low and limited in terms of diversity, breadth and depth. There was hardly any transaction between other business partners except the Customs Department. Although EDI has been introduced to the shipping community in the Port Klang area more than a decade ago, the port community has yet to fully realize the benefits that have been profusely talked about in literature and media. Generally, the three most cited benefits of EDI applications are the increase in efficiency, increase in data accuracy and increase in business image. This study also revealed that hidden computing costs, connectivity problems as well as network reliability and security were the major problems faced by these companies...|$|E

The Asia-Pacific region is both a major consumer and producer of agricultural products. Its growth in both imports and exports is accelerating, but not to the potential. There is significant opportunity in this region to expand agro-trade especially due to population growth, dietary change of consumers and trade of high-value products. A number of constraints act as barriers to realizing the trade potential of the Asia-Pacific region: cumbersome trade procedures, inadequate compliance to product standards, poor trade logistics and lack of financing for agricultural trade. The status of least developed and landlocked developing countries are worse in many of these categories. Some Asia-Pacific countries have adopted effective measures to deal with their national bottlenecks, mostly based on simplifying procedures, introducing <b>paperless</b> <b>trade</b> transactions, improving quality infrastructure and introducing innovative financing mechanisms.

Preliminary survey conducted revealed that there is undue delay. The work then systematically identifies the factors that hamper efficient and effective enforcement of such regulations in the import and export of goods in the Sri Lankan context. A questionnaire was circulated among a sample of 100 importers and exporters or their representatives in order to gather information on ground level practical problems faced by them. Existing laws and regulations as well as regulatory processes at several agencies were examined to identify the correct legal position and any existing automated solutions. Various authorities were interviewed {{in order to identify}} their requirements as well as the problems they face. It was found that in almost all the instances manual procedures are in use in the issuance of certificates (licenses/permits) and in subsequent debit/write-off steps introducing delays, duplications and poor control effects. The study shows that certain commodities require certificates from more than one regulatory agency for identical purpose. It is recommended that Automated Certificate Processing System be put into use integrated with the existing Customs Automated System. It is also recommended that the simplification and standardizing of procedures at regulatory agencies as well as at Customs need to be carried out before introducing an automated system.
