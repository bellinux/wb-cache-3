500|$|The {{earliest}} {{reviews of}} the album, published by the LA Weekly and Newsweek, were positive. Rolling Stone critic Christian Hoard wrote that [...] "Octagon's verses often feel unfocused and random, but when he bears down he can be mesmerizing, channeling his quick-tongued rhymes with streetwise brassiness and cosmic vibrations." [...] Allmusic reviewer Marisa Brown wrote that the album [...] "doesn't always {{make a lot of}} sense, but that's the beauty of it. It's a kind of concept album that concentrates more on the actual overall sound than the concepts. Its elements are all on the very edge of control, which is both exhilarating and terrifying at the same time; if it works, it could bring us to where we've never been, <b>protect</b> <b>us</b> <b>from</b> what may be, but if it fails, it could kill us all." [...] Hip Hop DX reviewer B. Love wrote, [...] "This is Kool Keith's best album in years—arguably even better than his classic Octagonecologyst—and marks a fine return to form for one of rap music's most distinctive and original talents." ...|$|E

[...] Wood concludes: [...] "Perhaps the truth of 'The Emperor's New Clothes' {{is not that the}} child's truth is mercifully free of adult corruption, but that it recognizes the terrifying possibility that whatever words we may use to clothe our fears, the fabric cannot <b>protect</b> <b>us</b> <b>from</b> them." ...|$|E
2500|$|Describing {{himself as}} a {{political}} liberal and moral conservative, Card's ideals concerning society—as well as foundational themes within his fiction—are described as communitarian. In 2000, Card said, [...] "Most of the program of {{both the left and}} the right is so unbelievably stupid it's hard to wish to identify myself with either. But on economic matters, I'm a committed communitarian. I regard the Soviet Union as simply state monopoly capitalism. It was run the way the United States would be if Microsoft owned everything. Real communism has never been tried! I would like to see government controls expanded, laws that allow capitalism to not reward the most rapacious, exploitative behavior.

2500|$|Hume's {{solution}} to this problem is to argue that, rather than reason, natural instinct explains the human practice of making inductive inferences. He asserts that [...] "Nature, by an absolute and uncontroulable [...] necessity has determin'd us to judge as well as to breathe and feel." [...] Agreeing, philosopher John D. Kenyon writes: [...] "Reason might manage to raise a doubt about the truth of a conclusion of natural inductive inference just for a moment... but the sheer agreeableness of animal faith will <b>protect</b> <b>us</b> <b>from</b> excessive caution and sterile suspension of belief." [...] Commentators such as Charles Sanders Peirce have demurred from Hume's solution, while, some, such as Kant and Karl Popper, saw that Hume's analysis [...] "had posed a most fundamental challenge to all human knowledge claims." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hostettler had {{introduced}} legislation in five consecutive Congress' to prevent {{organizations such as}} the American Civil Liberties Union from collecting attorneys’ fees when they win lawsuits challenging religious symbols on public land or religious groups’ use of government property. Hostletter said in a speech in February 2006 that his bill would [...] "restore legal balance in this country, and it will <b>protect</b> <b>us</b> <b>from</b> being the victims of this assault on our religious liberties". [...] At least one columnist claimed that this change would allow teachers to force students to pray to their specific deity with no possibility of damages or attorney's fees. In other words, only those who could afford to hire an attorney to challenge the practice would be able to object in court. Since monetary damages were precluded, the only remedy would be an injunction.|$|E
