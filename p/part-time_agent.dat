40|$|Context:   Conditioned taste aversion (CTA) is {{induced by}} an {{association}} of a food item with a negative experience, such as illness, which causes animals to avoid subsequent consumption of that particular food item. Inducing CTA may help reduce depredation rates of threatened fauna where predator population control is undesirable, impractical or unsuccessful. Aims :   We investigated whether CTA could be induced among foxes (Vulpes vulpes) to model eggs which mimicked those of the threatened hooded plover (Thinornis rubricollis). Methods:   Model eggs treated with a potential CTA-inducing chemical (sodium carbonate) and control eggs free of the agent were exposed to fox depredation for 28 days to simulate a hooded plover incubation period. To investigate whether CTA would persist in wild foxes, we implemented a <b>part-time</b> <b>agent</b> treatment (an initial 14 day exposure period of model eggs with the CTA agent followed by a second 14 day period when model eggs were free of the agent). Key results:   Similar intervals to the first depredation event were found for all model eggs regardless of treatment. After the first depredation event by foxes, the rate and likelihood of fox depredation was significantly lower in treated eggs than in control eggs. The likelihood or rate of depredation across the three treatments did not differ {{between the first and}} second periods. Conclusions: Our results suggest that during an exposure period of at least 28 days, CTA can be induced in wild foxes to eggs on beaches. Our results also suggest that 14 days may be insufficient time for wild foxes to develop a lasting CTA to familiar food items such as eggs. Implications:   Treatment of eggs with a CTA-inducing chemical may present a viable alternative to traditional predator control techniques for hooded plovers, as well as other ground-nesting birds, provided that an extended exposure to the CTAinducing agent occurs...|$|E

The two met at the Sealdah North Railway Tracks while arriving for suicide at the same time. While Dasu (Santu Mukhopadhyay) realising his faults, Ayan (Jeet) remains bent on ending his life. Dasu is a rich man turned poor (after his only son's death) who is constantly truncated by debtors while Ayan is a frustrated rich brat who is devastated after crushing in his business (share and stocks) and being betrayed by his girlfriend Rina. Dasu convinces Ayan not to commit suicide at {{the heat of the}} moment when Ayan still insists to die Dasu sorts out a peculiar contract between themselves. He begs Ayan to die exactly after three months. This is because Dasu, who is a <b>part-time</b> insurance <b>agent,</b> wants Ayan to buy a life insurance policy which would mature after three months. Dasu, meanwhile would pay the premium of 10 thousand rupees by any means whatsoever and after three months when Ayan would commit suicide Dasu would get the entire value of the insurance policy (Rs. 10 lacs) as Ayan's only nominee. Ayan evaluates Dasu's proposal and thinks to make some penance for his sins before his death. Ayan starts living in Dasu's residence for the next three months.

40|$|The {{estimation}} of financial savings from reducing telephone calls to an inbound call center appears {{at first glance}} to be a simple analytic problem: lower arrival rates enable the call center to staff fewer agents, thus reducing labor costs. However, the actual benefits-estimation problem is trickier. The company’s customer base was growing each year; therefore, while our project was focused on decreasing the number of calls per customer, the overall arrival rate was continuing to grow, albeit at a lower rate because of the call-stopping program. The company was also selling multiple products, and releasing major new versions annually and minor upgrades throughout the year; in addition, there was significant seasonal variation in the call arrival patterns. The historical call-volume data was difficult to interpret because periods of significant understaffing had produced high levels of call abandonment and long waiting times, suggesting that historical call volumes were sometimes not an accurate reflection of actual customer demand. Finally, there was constant change to the mix of full-time, <b>part-time,</b> and outsourced <b>agents,</b> call-routing strategies, hours of operation, and agent deployments. We believe that creating an accurate, robust model for estimating the financial benefits of a call-stopping program is an open research question. Given the increasing focus on such program...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1968 The {{part-time}} farmer {{is becoming}} an increasing {{important part of the}} American Way of Life. The Cooperative Extension Service should be prepared to work with these people and help fulfill their educational needs. The {{purpose of this study is}} to provide some guidelines that can be used in developing an effective livestock extension program for the part-time farmer. Some of the findings of this paper might also be used in developing extension programs in other areas besides live stock. A questionnaire was mailed to extension service personnel doing livestock work west of the Cascade mountains in Washington and Oregon. Most of the counties sampled had some urban and suburban developments. From the information secured in the questionnaire, the guidelines were developed. The main findings from the study are: 1. Even with parts of Oregon and Washington sparsely populated, 60 percent of the counties in the study have over 40 percent of their farmers that are part-time. 2. Forty-eight percent of the agents actually spent less than ten percent of their time with part-time farmers. 3. Livestock operations make up the largest percent of part-time farms. Of the 25 counties in the study, 11 estimated that 70 percent of their part-time operations were livestock and 17 estimated over 50 percent were livestock operations. 4. Educational meetings that are most successful in terms of participation for part-time operators are: Tours, Lecture and Demonstration, Field Days, Method Demonstrations and Plots. Based on the findings of the study, the following recommendations are made. 1. Agriculture Extension Agents located where there is a vast influx of part-time farmers, should organize a committee to help plan the program and work with these people. Programs planned for part-time farmers should follow procedures similar to programs for full-time farmers. 2. College staff personnel and extension specialists should be available for planning and presenting programs for part-time farmers as well as full-time farmers. 3. Fact sheets or small bulletins would be more useful for part-time operators than many present materials. The majority of the agents felt that materials should not be prepared in the field. 4. Agents should explore the possibility of evening radio and T. V. programs for <b>part-time</b> farmers. 5. <b>Agents</b> should hold tours and method demonstrations meetings for part-time farmers, preferably on Saturdays...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to analyze the {{theoretical}} implications of the marketing liability rule, section 9. 1 in the Finnish Insurance Contract Act (543 / 1994), for general contract law. The analysis is applied to the situation where marketing or sales information gives a wrong impression about subsequent detailed contract terms. Specifically the questions are 1) how can indefinite marketing promises become the content of a contract and 2) what can be learned from the historical attempts to legislate this issue. The analysis draws from literature and historical primary sources, and legal praxis is mostly referred to through these sources. The chosen method can be characterized as a pronounced self-awareness of the power, actions, logic and preconditions of law. In Nordic contract law, unspecified or unaddressed marketing information is treated mainly as an invitation to buy, not an offer. In the sale of goods, defective marketing is sanctioned by non-conformity, when marketing information relates to the properties or use of a product. According to the trailer-principle, identified in Nordic consumer law, the impression given by marketing information concerning all kinds of contract terms or their performance can be legally protected. This can be the case for example when there are only a few of certain advertised items actually in stock, or when marketing implies that certain limitations do not apply. Good business practice is the benchmark of the trailer-principle, but the appropriate private law sanctions are an open questions in Nordic legal literature. The Finnish insurance rule mandates that if the insurer or its representative has failed to provide the necessary information or has given incorrect or misleading information to the policyholder when marketing the insurance, the insurance contract is considered to be in force to the effect understood by the policyholder on the basis of the information received. The rule thus sanctions violations through a binding effect, instead of merely administrative sanctions or negative interest. My study suggests that a historical and theoretical approach can be used to discover the points of tension between this rule and established contract law, and to present a critique of the dogma of contracts as enforceable agreements. The analysis taps into the legal and philosophical discussion on the interaction between legal rules, social norms and economic behavior. Contract law exists between societal powers far greater than that of the legislator. The history of the insurance rule exemplifies particularly well the technique of normalization, where the law and legal practice define and describes what is normal and expose deviance, while hiding their own power. In contract economics, an efficient contract has been the primary benchmark for legal rules, but this standard is imperfect, as complete contracts are also consistent with social norms. The conclusion is that a balanced content for contract law rules is needed. This kind of a balance can be seen in the Finnish insurance rule. In the past, there have been authoritative attempts to marketing liability into Finnish contract law (in 1990) and Nordic consumer law (in 2001), but the Finnish insurance rule is the only one that was enacted. This rule was crafted during an inter-Nordic reform of insurance contract law in the 1970 ’s and 80 ’s. The protocols of the Nordic insurance law committees show that the Finnish legislator attempted to persuade the other Nordic states to adopt a similar rule. Nordic insurance contract law diverged on this issue because of different needs. Finland wanted to protect policyholders from misleading statements by <b>part-time</b> insurance <b>agents</b> that lacked the authority to change policy terms. Sweden however opted for a limited rule whereby onerous contract terms could be made ineffective. This was because Sweden was concerned that insurers would be negatively affected by vexatious claims, if a general private law liability for marketing information was codified into law. The Nordic Contract Acts have proven quite resistant to reform. This study proposes, de lege ferenda, that the immutable insurance rule could be adapted as a general default rule, and that the Contracts Act is the right place for this rule. The Finnish experience shows that marketing liability works, when it is combined with balanced rules on proving a buyers wrong impression...|$|R
