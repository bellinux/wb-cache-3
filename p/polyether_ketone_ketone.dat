SherwoodThis {{dissertation}} {{will examine}} the fabrication of different phosphorus containing films and their use as corrosion preventative films and adhesion materials between polymers and metal and metal alloys. Orthophosphate films are used in several metals and metal alloys to prevent corrosion and promote adhesion between paints or polymers and metal substrates. One key component {{is to examine the}} use of different phosphorus containing acids that might lead to phosphorus containing films which would compliment the mainly orthophosphate films currently in use. The objectives of this study are to see if it is possible to fabricate different phosphorus containing films, use them to adhere polymers to metal and metal alloys, and test the phosphorus containing films’ and polymer films’ corrosion protection properties. The thermoplastic resin, <b>Poly(ether</b> <b>ketone</b> <b>ketone),</b> or PEKK was found to adhere well to different phosphorus containing films and protect the underlying layers from oxidation in 4 -D water.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to explore structure-property relationships to develop the understanding needed for introduction of superior PEM materials. Polymer electrolyte membranes based on sulfonated <b>poly(ether</b> <b>ketone</b> <b>ketone)</b> (SPEKK) were fabricated using N-methyl pyrrolidone as casting solvent. The membranes were characterized in terms of properties that were relevant to fuel cell applications, such as proton conductivity, methanol permeability, and swelling properties, among others. It was found in this study that the proton conductivity of neat SPEKK membranes could reach the conductivity of commercial membranes such as Nafion®. However, when the conductivity of SPEKK was comparable to Nafion®, the swelling of SPEKK in water was quite excessive. The swelling problem was remedied by modifying the microstructure of SPEKK using different techniques. One of them involved blending of lightly sulfonated PEKK with highly acidic particles (sulfonated crosslinked polystyrene-SXLPS). Low sulfonation level of SPEKK was used to reduce the swelling of the membrane in water {{and the role of the}} highly acidic particles was to enhance the proton conductivity of the membrane. Because of the residual crystallinity in SPEKK with low sulfonation levels (IEC 3 ̆c 1 meq/g), the composite membranes exhibited excellent dimensional stability in water at elevated temperatures (30 - 90 °C). Also, the resistance to swelling of these composite membranes in methanol-water mixtures was far better than Nafion®, and so was the methanol permeability. Another technique explored was blending with non-conductive polymers (poly(ether imide) and poly(ether sulfone)) to act as mechanical reinforcement. It was found that miscibility behavior of the blends had a significant impact on the transport and swelling properties of these blends, which could be explained by the blend microstructure. The miscibility behavior was found to be strongly dependent on the sulfonation level of SPEKK. The conductivities of the blends were enhanced by as much as two orders of magnitude when the morphology was modified by electric field. The last approach was ionic crosslinking of the sulfonate groups in SPEKK using divalent cations, specifically barium ions. The crosslinking treatment has greatly improved the thermal stability of the membranes in both dry and wet conditions. ...|$|E

Very small amount of co-solvents which were immiscible with CO(2) was effective, and it was 1 / 20 - 1 / 25 amount of the solvent used in the conventional <b>poly(ether</b> <b>ketone)</b> synthesis. The polymerization mechanism was also discussed...|$|R
40|$|<b>Poly(ether</b> ether <b>ketone)</b> dendrimers and hyperbranched {{polymers}} {{were prepared}} from 3, 5 -dimethoxy- 4 ′-(4 -fluorobenzoyl) diphenyl ether and 3, 5 -dihydroxy- 4 ′-(4 -fluorobenzoyl) diphenyl ether through aromatic nucleophilic substitution reactions. 1 -(tert-Butyldimethylsiloxy) - 3, 5 -bis(4 -fluorobenzoyl) benzene was polycondensed with bisphenols, followed by cleavage of the protective group to form linear <b>poly(ether</b> <b>ketone)</b> s {{having the same}} hydroxyl groups in the side chains as the chain ends of the dendrimer and hyperbranched polymers. Their properties, such as solubilities, reduced viscosities, and thermal properties, were compared with one another. Similar comparisons were also carried out among the corresponding methoxy group polymers, {{and the size of}} the molecules was shown to affect the properties...|$|R
40|$|Semi-crystalline <b>poly(ether</b> <b>ketone)</b> s are {{important}} high-temperature engineering thermoplastics, but {{are difficult to}} characterize {{at the molecular level}} because of their insolubility in conventional organic solvents. Here we report that polymers of this type, including PEEK, react cleanly at high temperatures with low-volatility aralkyl amines to afford stable, noncrystalline poly(ether-imine) s, which are readily soluble in solvents such as chloroform, THF and DMF and so characterizable by conventional size-exclusion chromatography...|$|R
2500|$|BPA is {{also used}} in the {{synthesis}} of polysulfones and <b>polyether</b> <b>ketones,</b> as an antioxidant in some plasticizers, and as a polymerization inhibitor in PVC. Epoxy resins containing bisphenolA are used as coatings {{on the inside of}} almost all food and beverage cans; however, due to BPA health concerns, in Japan epoxy coating was mostly replaced by PET film. [...] BisphenolA is also a precursor to the flame retardant tetrabromobisphenolA, and was used as a fungicide.|$|R
40|$|This {{project is}} an attempt to {{synthesize}} and fabricate proton exchange membranes for hydrogen production via water electrolysis that {{can take advantage of the}} better kinetic and thermodynamic conditions that exist at higher temperatures. Current PEM technology is limited to the 125 [...] 150 C range. Based on previous work evaluating thermohydrolytic stability, some 5 families of polymers were chosen as viable candidates: <b>polyether</b> <b>ketones,</b> <b>polyether</b> sulfones, fluorinated polyimides, polybenzimidazoles, and polyphenyl quinoxalines. Several of these have been converted into ionomers via sulfonation and fashioned into membranes for evaluation. In particular, the sulfonated polyetheretherketone, or SPEEK, was tested for water uptake, thermo-conductimetric analysis, and performance as the solid electrolyte material in an electrolysis cell. Results comparable to commercial perfluorocarbon sulfonates were obtained...|$|R
