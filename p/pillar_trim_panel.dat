The pictures are from the Arab tradition and are supplemented by small birds, swastikas, flowers, palmettes and leaves. The wells of the reliefs were originally filled with a red, now darkened mass of wax and mastic. In the same technique, marble inlays are also mounted on the <b>pillar</b> <b>trim,</b> connecting <b>panels</b> and the door lintels. Two icons are also embedded above the lintels. On {{the left side of}} the door, the Panagia is depicted with the Child Jesus. To the right of the central door is the Christ Pantocrator with the right hand in a sign of blessing and the left holding a closed Evangelion. These two icons are modern creations which took the place of 17th century icons which were stolen in 1982.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental study on decentralized velocity feedback control on a double panel consisting of an external aluminum panel and a honeycomb <b>trim</b> <b>panel.</b> The decentralized feedback loops are formed by a 3 Ã— 3 array of coil-magnet electrodynamic actuators that react off the <b>trim</b> <b>panel</b> and a lightweight stiff frame structure {{located in the}} air {{gap between the two}} panels. Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) accelerometers are located {{on the opposite side of}} the <b>trim</b> <b>panel</b> in correspondence to the electrodynamic actuators. The grid structure is designed to provide an inertial reference to the actuators. In this way the velocity feedback control loops produce skyhook active damping on the double panel, which minimizes the vibrational response and sound radiation of the <b>trim</b> <b>panel</b> at low audio frequencies. Two configurations are considered where the grid structure is either weakly coupled or strongly coupled to the external panel. Both stability and control performance of the two configurations are analyzed experimentally. The study shows that the control configuration with the weakly coupled grid structure enables the implementation of larger stable feedback control gains, which lead to reductions of the sound radiated by the <b>trim</b> <b>panel</b> between 10 and 30 dB for the first seven resonance peaks...|$|R
40|$|The {{increased}} {{need for}} lightweight structures in modern aerospace transport due to lower fuel consumption and increased transport capacity reveals an acoustic challenge. Because {{of the high}} stiffness and low mass the coincidence frequencies of lightweight structures are low compared to classical aluminum structures. That {{is the reason for}} a weak transmission loss of lightweight structures made of glass or carbon fiber reinforced plastics. Therefore, passive solutions are widely investigated to increase the transmission loss of lightweight helicopter <b>trim</b> <b>panels.</b> For example, in the European GARTEUR AG 20 "Cabin internal noise: simulation and experimental methods for new solutions for internal noise reduction", two helicopter <b>trim</b> <b>panels</b> are studied which are structurally optimized for an increased TL. In this paper the applicability of a semi-active shunt damping system to this structurally optimized helicopter <b>trim</b> <b>panel</b> is investigated experimentally. Prior to this, the semi-active shunt damping performance is studied on a classical steel plate and afterwards the damped helicopter <b>trim</b> <b>panel</b> is investigated in a transmission loss facility. Two experiments are conducted. First of all, the <b>trim</b> <b>panel</b> is excited with a point force and the surface vibrations are measured with a laser scanning vibrometer. In the second test the <b>trim</b> <b>panel</b> is excited with a diffuse sound field. It can be seen that the negative capacitance shunt is less effective on a higher damped structure. Global vibration reductions of only 3 - 4 are achieved during the shaker test. Concerning the transmission loss, the results are comparable to the vibration reduction. The main reason for {{this is supposed to be}} a lower piezoelectric coupling to the sandwich panel...|$|R

A comparison of TL for panels treated with a damping layer, a fiberglass layer, or a <b>trim</b> <b>panel</b> showed {{that the effects of}} damping are frequency dependent with some performing better below 500 Hz and others performing better above 500 Hz.

40|$|An {{aircraft}} cabin acoustic enclosure, built {{in support of}} the Propfan Test Assessment (PTA) program, is described. Helmholtz resonators were attached to the cabin <b>trim</b> <b>panels</b> to increase the sidewall transmission loss (TL). Resonators (448) were located between the <b>trim</b> <b>panels</b> and fuselage shell. In addition, 152 resonators were placed between the enclosure and aircraft floors.

Laboratory noise reduction (NR) test results are discussed. The enclosure was placed in a Gulfstream 2 fuselage section. Broadband (138 dB overall SPL) and tonal (149 dB overall SPL) excitations were used in the lab. Tonal excitation simulated the propfan flight test excitation.

40|$|The {{application}} of feedback {{control for the}} active reduction of stochastic broadband disturbances is widely recognized as superior to feedforward control. However, if the spatial and temporal correlation of sensor signals is high and the control-system configuration is causal, a significant disturbance rejection {{can be achieved by}} the {{application of}} feedforward control. The reason for this is its ability to reduce both resonant and forced structural vibration. In case of one-dimensional problems, e. g. sound-propagating ducts, the coherence and causality requirements can generally be met and the application of broadband feedforward control is state-of-the-art of science and technology. Yet for higher dimensional problems it can become difficult or even impossible to achieve these requirements. In this research work the attempt was made to exploit the double-wall construction of a typical aircraft fuselage to set up a causal feedforward control system for an active <b>trim</b> <b>panel</b> with improved low-frequency sound transmission loss (< 500 Hz). Different configurations of an active <b>trim</b> <b>panel</b> with structural actuators and sensors have been simulated and experimentally realized in a sound transmission loss facility. Experimental results prove the ability of the investigated smart <b>trim</b> <b>panels</b> to considerably reduce structural vibration and sound power in third-octave bands...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{acoustic}} Transmission Loss (TL) of a vibrating structure, like {{a sample}} of helicopter <b>trim</b> <b>panel,</b> is generally measured in a laboratory set-up within controlled conditions. It represents the ratio between the incident acoustic power and the acoustic power radiated by the panel. To estimate its vibro-acoustic behaviour, {{it is essential to}} know precisely the nature of incident pressure field and to distinguish the influence of panel size and boundary conditions. Moreover, the relevance of the outputs depends on the experimental surroundings and instrumentation. The aim {{of this paper is to}} present an experimental benchmark study involving different laboratories and operating processes (in laboratory or "in situ") of "Helicopter GARTEUR (Group for Aeronautical Research and Technology in Europe) Action Group AG 20 " and relative to the measurement of TL applied to reference <b>trim</b> <b>panels...</b>|$|R
