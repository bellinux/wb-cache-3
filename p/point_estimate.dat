25|$|Currently, no {{reliable}} {{estimates of the}} total crabeater seal population are available. Past estimates relied on minimal opportunistic sighting and much speculation, ranging from 2 million to 50-75 million individuals. Genetic evidence suggests that crabeater population numbers may have increased during the Pleistocene. The most recent <b>point</b> <b>estimate</b> is 7 million individuals, but this, too, is considered a likely underestimate. An international effort, the Antarctic Pack Ice Seal initiative, is currently underway to evaluate systematically collected survey data and obtain reliable estimates of all Antarctic seal abundances.|$|E
25|$|Cohort studies select {{subjects}} {{based on}} their exposure status. The study subjects should be at risk of the outcome under investigation {{at the beginning of}} the cohort study; this usually means that they should be disease free when the cohort study starts. The cohort is followed through time to assess their later outcome status. An example of a cohort study would be the investigation of a cohort of smokers and non-smokers over time to estimate the incidence of lung cancer. The same 2×2 table is constructed as with the case control study. However, the <b>point</b> <b>estimate</b> generated is the relative risk (RR), which is the probability of disease for a person in the exposed group, Pe=A/(A+B) over the probability of disease for a person in the unexposed group, P'u=C/(C+D), i.e. RR=Pe/Pu.|$|E

2500|$|Any {{attempt at}} ancestral {{reconstruction}} {{begins with a}} phylogeny. [...] In general, a phylogeny is a tree-based hypothesis about {{the order in which}} populations (referred to as taxa) are related by descent from common ancestors. [...] Observed taxa are represented by the tips or terminal nodes of the tree that are progressively connected by branches to their common ancestors, which are represented by the branching points of the tree that are usually referred to as the ancestral or internal nodes. [...] Eventually, all lineages converge to the most recent common ancestor of the entire sample of taxa. [...] In the context of ancestral reconstruction, a phylogeny is often treated {{as though it were a}} known quantity (with Bayesian approaches being an important exception). [...] Because there can be an enormous number of phylogenies that are nearly equally effective at explaining the data, reducing the subset of phylogenies supported by the data to a single representative, or <b>point</b> <b>estimate,</b> can be a convenient and sometimes necessary simplifying assumption.|$|E
