40|$|The newly {{developed}} multidimensional scale to measure social connectedness (Self in a Social Context—Social Connectedness Scale; SSC–SC) comprised a <b>provisional</b> <b>item</b> pool of 76 items in family, peer, {{school and community}} domains. Nine independent raters assessed appropriateness of items, with two items deleted resulting in 74 items. Responses of 836 high school students were investigated using exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and validated with a further 837 students using EFA within a confirmatory environment (E/CFA). This resulted in 45 items, loading on four reliable factors, indicating social connectedness is a multivariate construct related to the four contexts.

40|$|Background: Quality of life {{measurement}} in cholangiocarcinoma and gallbladder cancer {{involves the}} assessment of patient-reported {{issues related to the}} symptoms, disease and treatment of these tumours. This study describes the development of the disease-specific quality of life (QoL) questionnaire for patients with cholangiocarcinoma and gallbladder cancer to supplement the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) -QLQ C 30 core cancer questionnaire. Methods: Phases 1 – 3 of the guidelines for module development published by the EORTC were followed, with adaptations for incorporation of questions from existing modules. Results: A total of 47 QoL issues (questions) were identified; 44 questions from the two related validated questionnaires, the EORTC QLQ-PAN 26 (pancreatic module) and the EORTC QLQ-LMC 21 (liver metastases module), two from the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy hepatobiliary module questionnaire in the literature search and one from healthcare professional interviews. Following phase 1 and 2 interviews with patients (n= 101) and health care professionals (n= 6), a 23 -question provisional questionnaire was formulated. There were five questions from PAN 26, 15 from LMC 21 and three extra questions. In phase 3, the <b>provisional</b> <b>item</b> list was pre-tested in 52 patients in four languages and this resulted in a 21 -item module. Conclusion: This is the only disease-specific QoL questionnaire for patients with cholangiocarcinoma and gallbladder cancer, and initial assessments show it to be accurate and acceptable to patients in reflecting QoL in these diseases. <br/...|$|E
40|$|Background and aim There {{is a lack}} of {{instruments}} that focus on the specific health-related quality of life (HRQOL) issues that affect older people with cancer. The aim {{of this study was to}} develop a HRQOL questionnaire module to supplement the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) core questionnaire, the EORTC QLQ-C 30 for older (> 70 years) patients with cancer. Methods Phases 1 – 3 were conducted in seven countries following modified EORTC Quality of Life Group guidelines for module development. Phase 1 : potentially relevant issues were identified by a systematic literature review, a questionnaire survey of 17 multi-disciplinary health professionals and two rounds of qualitative interviews. The first round included 9 patients aged > 70. The second round was a comparative series of interviews with 49 patients > 70 years with a range of cancer diagnoses and 40 patients aged 50 – 69 years matched for gender and disease site. In Phase 2 the issues were formulated into a long <b>provisional</b> <b>item</b> list. This was administered in Phase 3 together with the QLQ-C 30 to two further groups of cancer patients aged > 70 (n = 97) or 50 – 69 years (n = 85) to determine the importance, relevance and acceptability of each item. Redundant and duplicate items were removed; issues specific to the older group were selected for the final questionnaire. Results In Phase 1, 75 issues were identified. These were reduced in Phase 2 to create a 45 item provisional list. Phase 3 testing of the provisional list led to the selection of 15 items with good range of response, high scores of importance and relevance in the older patients. This resulted in the EORTC QLQ-ELD 15, containing five conceptually coherent scales (functional independence, relationships with family and friends, worries about the future, autonomy and burden of illness). Conclusion The EORTC QLQ-ELD 15 in combination with the EORTC QLQ-C 30 is ready for large-scale validation studies, and will assess HRQOL issues of most relevance and concern for older people with cancer across a wide range of cancer sites and treatment stages...|$|E
40|$|Objective: We {{aimed to}} develop a {{questionnaire}} assessing fears and beliefs of patients with knee OA. Design: We sent a detailed document reporting on a qualitative analysis of interviews of patients with knee OA to experts, and a Delphi procedure was adopted for item generation. Then, 80 physicians recruited 566 patients with knee OA to test the <b>provisional</b> questionnaire. <b>Items</b> were reduced according to their metric properties and exploratory factor analysis. Reliability was tested by the Cronbach a coefficient. Construct validity was tested by divergent validity and confirmatory factor analysis. Test–retest reliability was assessed by the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) and the Bland and Altman technique. Results: 137 items were extracted from analysis of the interview data. Three Delphi rounds were needed to obtain consensus on a 25 -item provisional questionnaire. The item-reduction process resulted in an 11 -item questionnaire. Selected items represented fears and beliefs about daily living activities (3 items), fears and beliefs about physicians (4 items), fears and beliefs about the disease (2 items), and fears and beliefs about sports and leisure activities (2 items). The Cronbach a coefficient of global score was 0. 85. We observed expected divergent validity. Confirmation factor analyses confirmed higher intra-factor than inter-factor correlations. Test–retest reliability was good, with an ICC of 0. 81, and Bland and Altman analysis did not reveal a systematic trend...|$|R
40|$|Quality of life (QL) is an {{important}} outcome in clinical trials in oncology. There is currently no valid international QL measure for gastric cancer. This paper describes {{the development of a}} QL module for gastric cancer to supplement the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of life (QLQ-C 30) questionnaire. Phases I to III of module development were conducted in the United Kingdom, France, Germany and Spain according to EORTC QL Group guidelines. Twenty relevant QL issues were generated from the literature and interviews with health professionals (n= 24) and patients (n= 58). This produced a 24 <b>item</b> <b>provisional</b> module. Further testing in 115 patients resulted in the QLQ-STO 22, containing 22 questions, conceptualised into five scales and four single items, related to disease symptoms, treatment side-effects and emotional issues specific to gastric cancer. The use of the QLQ-C 30 supplemented by the QLQ-STO 22 will provide a comprehensive QL measure for international trials in gastric cancer...|$|R
40|$|Background Role {{functioning}} (RF) as a core {{construct of}} health-related {{quality of life}} (HRQOL) comprises aspects of occupational and social roles relevant for patients in all treatment phases {{as well as for}} survivors. The objective of the current study was to improve its assessment by developing a computer-adaptive test (CAT) for RF. This {{was part of a larger}} project whose objective is to develop a CAT version of the EORTC QLQ-C 30 which is one of the most widely used HRQOL instruments in oncology. Methods In accordance with EORTC guidelines, the development of the RF-CAT comprised four phases. Phase I involved the conceptualization of RF. In Phase II, a <b>provisional</b> list of <b>items</b> was defined and revised by experts in the field. In phase III, feedback was obtained from cancer patients in various countries. Phase IV comprised field testing in an international sample, calibration of the item bank, and evaluation of the psychometric performance of the RF-CAT. Results Phases I-III yielded a list of 12 items eligible for phase IV field-testing. The field-testing sample included 1, 023 patients from Austria, Denmark, Italy, and the UK. Psychometric evaluation and item response theory analyses yielded 10 items with good psychometric properties. The resulting item bank exhibits excellent reliability (mean reliability[*]=[*] 0. 85, median[*]=[*] 0. 95). Using the RF-CAT may allow sample size savings from 11 % up to 50 % compared to using the QLQ-C 30 RF scale. Conclusions The RF-CAT item bank improves the precision and efficiency with which RF can be assessed, promoting its integration into oncology research and clinical practice...|$|R
40|$|Background. To date, no valid {{instrument}} is available {{that focuses on}} specific health-related quality of life (HRQoL) issues that affect thyroid cancer survivors. The objective {{of this study was}} to develop and pretest a thyroid cancer specific HRQoL questionnaire that can be used in addition to the more general European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C 30). Material and methods. Potentially relevant issues were identified by a systematic literature review, a focus group meeting, and an issue list completed by six health care professionals (HCP) and 18 thyroid cancer survivors. Resultant issues were analyzed on importance and relevance (phase I). The issues were formulated into a long provisional list of questions (phase II). These questions were administered in combination with the EORTC QLQ-C 30 to 306 Dutch thyroid cancer survivors to pretest the hypothesized scale structure (phase III). Although the development of this questionnaire was not set up as an international study, phases I–III are in agreement with the methodology of the EORTC guidelines. Results. The literature search, focus group and issue list completed by HCP and survivors resulted in 75 issues. These were reduced to create a 30 <b>item</b> <b>provisional</b> list. Pretesting led to a selection of 24 items with a good range of response. This resulted in the THYCA-QoL containing 24 items and seven conceptual scales. Conclusion. The THYCA-QoL in combination with the EORTC QLQ-C 30 is ready for a large (international) scale validation study, and will assess HRQoL issues of most relevance and concern for thyroid cancer survivors...|$|R
40|$|PROBLEM: Preventive {{interventions}} to reduce occupational injuries and health problems in farmers require {{the identification of}} {{factors that contribute to}} unsafe and health damaging behavior. This paper describes the development and validation of a self-report questionnaire, which measures the determinants of occupational health-related behaviors in farmers. METHOD: A representative sample of 283 Flemish farmers completed a <b>provisional</b> 135 <b>item</b> questionnaire based on the Theory of Planned Behavior, measuring four behaviors related to occupational health (machinery use, animal handling, preventing falls, and pesticide use), as well as the intentions, attitudes, perceived social norms, and self-efficacy for each of these behaviors. RESULTS: The fit indices of the Confirmatory Factor Analysis {{turned out not to be}} sufficient to reproduce the dimensions of the TPB. Therefore exploratory factor analysis was use to determine the underlying dimensions. Principal Component Analyses (PCA) on the behavioral items yielded single component solutions explaining a considerable proportion of the variance for each behavior and for behavioral intentions. Principal component analyses toward an a priori three-component structure reflecting the TPB dimensions did not produce sufficient congruence for the determinants of the four behaviors. Subsequent Varimax rotations and discarding of redundant items resulted in three component solutions explaining 50 % to 69 % of the variance in the determinants of each behavior, corresponding with the dimensions of the TPB. Internal consistencies ranged from. 25 to. 89. Scale scores accounted for a significant proportion of the variance in intention and self-reported behavior. IMPACT: The study demonstrates the validity of the TPB in predicting behavior related to occupational safety and health in farmers, and provides a valid and reliable questionnaire to measure the cognitive concepts featured in this model. IMPACT ON INDUSTRY: Both authors share the same view on this study's impact on industry. In recent years, efforts have been made to create awareness among farmers about occupational hazards, and to encourage farmers to perform safer and healthier behavior. However, only a limited number of these interventions have proven to be successful. A possible reason for this relative lack of success is that interventions typically focus on risk analysis and raising awareness, whereas the literature on preventive health behavior change indicates that knowledge and awareness with regard to possible health risks are neither necessary nor sufficient to change behavior. To raise the effectiveness of prevention programs, other relevant determinants of behavior need to be addressed as well, such as: attitudes, perceived social norms, self efficacy, and elements of the physical environment that elicit or reinforce behavior. These determinants play a key role in psychological models of health related behavior, such as the Theory of Planned Behavior. Thus far, the use of these models within agricultural settings is fairly limited. This study demonstrates the validity of the Theory of Planned Behavior in predicting behavior related to occupational safety and health in farmers, and provides a valid and reliable questionnaire to measure the cognitive concepts featured in this model. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$| {{examples}} of digital technologies {{which can be}} embedded {{within each of the}} four key concepts of curriculum design. Many of these technologies support the increasing numbers of students in postgraduate education and allow for efficient scalability of a curriculum. In addition they provide increased opportunities for flexible and flipped learning and move towards providing a real world experience for students.

Kouze and Posner (2012) as part of their leadership challenge acknowledge that leadership does not happen without courage and how leadership could be defined as courage in action. Educators must therefore first understand how digital technologies support the pedagogical process rather than following each emerging technology (Sharples et al 2015) simply because it is new. Creating the vision (NHS Leadership Academy 2013) for the application of digital technologies is key and will support successful curriculum change and transformation. Using the example identified in table 1 the presenters will debate the embedding of pedagogies that embrace technology within postgraduate curricula and will explore their impact on student experience and enhancement. The debate will focus on new curriculum models that balance the use of digital technology with quality time ‘face to face’ interaction with students; and how to engage the reluctant academic and student follower.
