50|$|At that time, as {{asbestos}} {{was being}} phased out, mineral fibre and cement-based products were considered {{the only option}} to protect buildings from fire. Dore decided {{to look for a}} more aesthetically-pleasing alternative and eventually discovered a methodology for solving the need by using fire-resistant <b>paint</b> <b>technology.</b> He opened centres in Coventry and Paris to further the research and development of this technical breakthrough.|$|E
50|$|In <b>paint</b> <b>technology,</b> the sheen is the {{glossiness}} of a paint finish. Glossy {{and flat}} (or matte) are typical extreme levels of glossiness of a finish. Glossy paints are shiny and reflect most {{light in the}} specular (mirror-like) direction, while on flat paints most of the light diffuses {{in a range of}} angles. The gloss level of paint can also affect its apparent colour.|$|E
5000|$|People {{who make}} use of spray <b>paint</b> <b>technology</b> must be given full {{awareness}} of the risks and hazards of the procedure that they perform, not only to them but also to other people who become exposed to the paint.

50|$|Body {{corrosion}} - Most {{model year}} {{versions of the}} W210 displayed body rust, notably on European-sold cars. Rust would sometimes appear spontaneously on panels such as doors and roofs on cars {{less than a year}} old. In response to this problem, the manufacturer would normally change or repair the affected panels under warranty. Mercedes-Benz has been criticized in the European press for not officially acknowledging this problem. This was due to problems introducing water-based <b>paint</b> <b>technology.</b>|$|E
5000|$|So far no {{manufacturer}} {{has provided}} any independent test results to substantiate any claims of improved performance over standard <b>paint</b> <b>technology.</b> All independent tests {{have shown that}} the proprietary formulas offer no advantages at all over plain old acrylic paint.

40|$|The U. S. Automotive {{industry}} {{is struggling with}} {{the adoption of a}} solvent-free powder coating technology as a replacement for traditional liquid <b>painting</b> <b>technology</b> which is considered to be environmentally harmful. The Low Emission Paint Consortium (LEPC) was formed by Chrysler, Ford, and General Motors to tackle many of the technical issues that are associated with bringing a new technology into practical use. Additionally, there are managerial and manufacturing issues which will need to be addressed before powder coating can be fully implemented in auto assembly plants. Understanding the implications and potential effects of both the managerial and technical issues are a prerequisite to the successful introduction of a new <b>painting</b> <b>technology.</b> Studies performed by the LEPC have shown that powder transfer efficiency, film build, and film build uniformity are dynamically affected by the powder material and the specific set of applicators being used to deposit that powder.

50|$|In {{the year}} 1959, the Ministry of Education {{recommended}} a recurring grant {{for the building}} and equipments. The AICTE decided to increase the intake of engineering graduates in all the institutions and recommended that the Laxminarayan Institute of Technology should admit 60 students instead of 36 and should start a 5 Year Integrated Course in Chemical Engineering. The UGC gave an additional grant for starting a three years' B.Sc. (Tech) course in Oil Technology in the year 1964. The Institute started the Five Year Integrated Course with intake of 60 students in the year 1967. During these years, the post-graduate degrees of Nagpur University {{in the field of}} Technology were awarded {{on the basis of a}} research thesis. The M.Tech. course, partly by papers and partly by research started in 1967 got a greater response in the year 1969. These courses are Petro-Chemical Technology, Oil Technology, <b>Paint</b> <b>Technology</b> and Chemical Engineering.|$|E
5000|$|Due {{to budget}} constraints, however, the Ralliart (codenamed [...] "TJ0R42") {{was brought to}} market in February 2002 still as an {{individually}} numbered vehicle, but only with a FWD platform and with less third party-sourced fittings. In fact, the front seats ended up being the standard Mitsubishi-designed Magna seats, but with revised side bolsters; the standard Magna's steering wheel and gear levers were retained, although the former was leather wrapped (black and red) in Italy by MOMO; the red-only instrument cluster dials (but with a [...] "Ralliart" [...] inscribed rev counter) and silver interior trims for the centre console and tunnel were sourced from the VR-X Limited Edition (without the Verada-sourced chrome gear plate for the automatic fitted to the VR-X). The sound system was a complete upgrade, however, being a 14-speaker Fujitsu Ten Eclipse tuner with CD player and remote control. This car also became the first local Mitsubishi product to offer datadot <b>paint</b> <b>technology.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The Liebermann {{family lived}} in a house in Ilford (Essex), at the address {{mentioned}} in Otto Liebermann's 1967 paper in the science journal Nature: 29 de Vere Gardens, Cranbrook, Ilford. Unfortunately, Otto Liebermann was not able to obtain employment in the oil industry and spent the years after the war until retirement working as Chief Chemist at the paint factory. In 1963 the journal <b>Paint</b> <b>Technology</b> printed two different papers on Dr. Liebermann's work at the Jenson and Nicholson Ltd. paint factory. Only after retirement Otto Liebermann could do what he had always wanted to do: his own research on dolomite. As his daughter Luiza recalled: [...] "29 de Vere Gardens was a large house and when my sister and I left home my parents let the upstairs as a flat, converting a small bedroom into a kitchen. I can't remember the exact sequence of events but eventually they ceased to have tenants and Dad took over the upstairs kitchen as his laboratory. He was completely self-financed and it was in the kitchen of 29 De Vere Gardens that he synthesized dolomite, the work he had had to leave for so many years because of the war." [...] In March 1974 his wife Stella died, and only three weeks later on 6 April 1974 Otto Liebermann died in Ilford.|$|E
40|$|This book offers {{unique and}} {{valuable}} {{contributions to the}} field. It offers breadth and inclusiveness. Most existing works on automotive painting cover only a single aspect of this complex topic, such as the chemistry of paint or <b>paint</b> booth <b>technology.</b> Monozukuri and Hitozukuri are Japanese terms that can be translated as “making things” and “developing people” but their implications in Japanese are richer and more complex than this minimal translation would indicate. The Monozukuri-Hitozukuri perspective is drawn from essential principles on which the Toyota approach to problem-solving and continuous improvement is based. From this perspective, neither <b>painting</b> <b>technology</b> R&D nor <b>painting</b> <b>technology</b> use in manufacturing can be done successfully without integrating technological and human concerns involved with making and learning in the broadest sense, as the hyphen is meant to indicate. The editors provide case studies and examples [...] drawn from Mr. Toda’s 33 years of experience with automotive painting at Toyota and from Dr. Saito’s 18 years experience with IR 4 TD, the research-for-development group he leads at the University of Kentucky [...] that give details on how these two principles can be integrated for successful problem-solving and innovation in industry, in university R&D, and in the collaboration between the two. The book will bring readers {{up to date on}} progress in the field over the last decade to provide a basis for and to indicate fruitful directions in future R&D and technology innovation for automotive painting...|$|R
40|$|Motivation: <b>Painting</b> <b>technology</b> {{permits to}} make a {{revision}} of data and theories on karyotype evolution available from routine cytogenetics. We apply Zoo-FISH technology to study major tendencies of karyotype evolution across mammalian orders. Results: Human chromosome specific probes were used to track the way of karyotype changes in some mammalian orders. Painting probes localization allowed us to analyze karyotype and genome evolution and produce complete integrative maps for human and particular species. Available from painting studies data were analyzed and two modes of karyotype evolutional changes (slow and drastic) were demonstrated...|$|R

50|$|The Palm House was {{originally}} built in 1862 {{to accommodate the}} ever increasing collection of plants from tropical areas that demanded more and more protected growing conditions. The construction was overseen by David Moore,the curator of the gardens at the time. The original structure was built of wood, and was unstable, leading to it being blown down by heavy gales in 1883, twenty one years later. Richard Turner, the great Dublin ironmaster, had already supplied an iron house to Belfast Gardens and he persuaded the Royal Dublin Society that such a house {{would be a better}} investment than a wooden house, and by 1883 construction had begun on a stronger iron structure. Fabrication of the structure took place in Paisley, Scotland, and shipped to Ireland in sections.By the early 2000s, the Palm House had fallen into a state of disrepair. After more than 100 years, the wrought iron, cast iron and timber construction had seriously deteriorated. Prior to its restoration a large number of panes of glass were breaking each year due to the corrosion and instability of the structure. As part of the restoration the house was completely dismantled into more than 7,000 parts, tagged for repair and restoration off-site. 20 meter tall cast iron columns within the Great Palm House had seriously degraded and were replaced by new cast iron columns created in moulds of the originals. To protect the structure from further corrosion, new modern <b>paint</b> <b>technology</b> was used to develop long-term protection for the Palm House, providing protection from the perpetually tropical internal climate. For Health and Safety reasons, overhead glass was laminated and vertical panes toughened, and specialised form of mastic was used to fix the panes, replacing original linseed oil putty that had contributed to the decay of the building over the century. The Palm House was reopened in 2004 after a lengthy replanting programme following the restoration process.|$|E
40|$|From Introduction]. Prior to 1800 {{advances}} made {{in painting}} could often be accredited to the advances made in <b>paint</b> <b>technology.</b> Since {{the beginning of}} the last century however, <b>paint</b> <b>technology</b> has stabilised, moved into the background and allowed the artist to create with the medium rather than be dictated to by it. This stabilising of art technology has also generated a lack of interest in technique, leading in turn to a number of painting techniques being lost. In some ways we know less today of the oil medium and its correct use than was known to Jan and Hubert Van Eyck and their followers. However, if this lack of concern with technique has produced a large number of valid artistic statements which are unlikely to survive physically, it also means that the hoardes of painters who painted technically perfect paintings with no valid art statement have dwindled as well...|$|E
30|$|Considering the {{materials}} historical perspective, {{this is the}} first time that such a study is carried out in Greece for a period other than antiquity. Concerning the Venetian period, the study of pigments on stone sculpture complements similar studies of pigments in wall paintings [30]. However, the study of Ottoman sculpture is the first analytical investigation with the aim to identify pigments and specify the Ottoman palette of artworks in the Greek territory. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that this study is focused on a very interesting time period regarding the evolution of colorant and <b>paint</b> <b>technology.</b> For these reasons, the contribution of this research in the field of the material culture of this era is of great importance.|$|E
