Scales to measure locus of control in the health domain were reviewed by Furnham and Steele [...] in 1993. The best-known are the Health Locus of Control Scale and the Multidimensional Health Locus of Control Scale, or MHLC. The latter scale is based on the idea (echoing Levenson's earlier work) that health may be attributed to three sources: internal factors (such as self-determination of a healthy lifestyle), powerful others (such as one's doctor) or luck (which is very dangerous as lifestyle advice will be ignored – these <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>very</b> difficult to help).|$|E
