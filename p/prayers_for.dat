At the request of her family, she was informed by the hospital chaplain, Joseph Brennan, a newly ordained Catholic priest, {{that she was going to}} die. Though the illness was painful, she remained cheerful, meekly accepted her fate, and offered up her suffering to God. Brennan was deeply impressed by her faith and visited her daily. While dying, Richard prayed for other individuals to be healed or to be converted to Catholicism. The Director of Pediatrics at the hospital, Theresita Crowley, a nun, also witnessed her calm acceptance of suffering and <b>prayers</b> <b>for</b> others. Brennan and Crowley claimed that those for whom Richard prayed recovered from their illnesses or became Catholic. Richard died on 11 August 1959.|$|E
40|$|Three studies {{examine the}} role of spirituality, {{specifically}} <b>prayer</b> <b>for</b> the partner, {{in the development of}} young adult relationships. In Study 1 (N = 302) we examine longitudinal relationships to establish ordering over time; <b>prayer</b> <b>for</b> the partner predicted later relationship satisfaction but not vice versa. In Study 2 (N = 191) we examine whether it is <b>prayer</b> <b>for</b> the partner or simply prayer in general that ac-counts for effects on satisfaction. We also establish that <b>prayer</b> <b>for</b> the partner ac-counts for unique variance in satisfaction beyond that contributed by positive and negative dyadic behavior. Finally, in Study 3 (N = 360) we examine three plausible mediators of the impact of <b>prayer</b> <b>for</b> the partner on young adult relationships and find that increased commitment mediates the effect of <b>prayer</b> <b>for</b> the partner on re-lationship satisfaction. Results are interpreted as consistent with the view that <b>prayer</b> <b>for</b> the partner influences commitment by priming a longer–term perspec-tive, a key developmental task in young adult relationships. Potential negative impacts of prayer and the need for experimental investigation are also discussed. Survey research reveals that around 90 % of Americans pray at least occasionally (McCullough & Larson, 1999) and many people use prayer spontaneously to cope with their problems (Barnes et. al., 2004; McCaffrey et al., 2004).

5|$|After the Reformation, the Mass and Purgatory were {{rejected}} by the Kirk, along with the efficacy of good works and <b>prayers</b> <b>for</b> the dead. In place of elaborate processions and masses at a funeral there was a simple service, where the body was taken to its resting place without singing and readings and interred soberly without ceremony. Unlike other reformed churches the Kirk also rejected burial inside the church, which were now seen as unseemly for a house of prayer. This caused friction with traditional rights, particularly of local notables, to be buried with their ancestors. The use of burial aisles, an extension projecting for {{the main body of}} the church, almost exclusively used for burial and commemoration, represented a uniquely Scottish solution to this problem. For most ranks in society the kirkyard remained the desired place of burial. From the seventeenth century burials were increasingly marked by gravestones, often including inscriptions that indicated affection for and the virtues of the deceased.|$|E

On another occasion, Kouao took Climbié to a church run by the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God, where the pastor, Alvaro Lima, suspected she was being abused, although he took no action. He said in the inquiry that Climbié told him that Satan had told her to burn herself. The pastor did not believe her, but he still believed that a person could be possessed.|$|E

According to his own account, he burst into tears and fled to his room. Within a week, however, he was giving his first sermon to a congregation that included his old teacher, John Major. He expounded on the seventh chapter of the Book of Daniel, comparing the Pope with the Antichrist. His sermon was marked by his consideration of the Bible as his sole authority and the doctrine of justification by faith alone, two elements that would remain in his thoughts throughout the rest of his life. A few days later, a debate was staged that allowed him to lay down additional theses including the rejection of the Mass, Purgatory, and <b>prayers</b> <b>for</b> the dead.|$|E
5|$|Leicester Abbey {{was founded}} during {{a wave of}} monastic enthusiasm that swept through western Christendom in the 11th and 12th centuries.

These monasteries were often founded by a wealthy aristocratic benefactor who endowed and patronised the establishments in return for <b>prayers</b> <b>for</b> their soul, and often, the right to be buried within the monastic church. Leicester Abbey was founded in the Augustinian tradition. The monks at the abbey were known as canons, and followed the monastic rules set down by Saint Augustine of Hippo. Sometimes known as Black Canons, because of their dress (a white habit and black cloak), Augustinian Canons lived a clerical life engaged in public ministry; this is distinct to other forms of monasticism in which monks were cloistered from the outside world, and lived an isolated, contemplative life.|$|E
