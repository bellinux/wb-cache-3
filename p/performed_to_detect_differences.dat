The {{aim of this study}} was to test a pressure-indicating film designed to measure the pressure between a collapsing liner and artificial teats. The Ultra Super Low and the Extreme Low pressure-indicating films were tested on two types of artificial teat. The experiments were performed with a conventional milking cluster equipped with round silicone liners. For each teat and film type, 30 repetitions were performed. Each repetition was performed with a new piece of film. Kruskal-Wallis tests were <b>performed</b> <b>to</b> <b>detect</b> <b>differences</b> between the pressure values for the different teats. The area of regions where pressure-indication color developed was calculated to determine the most suitable film type. Both film types measured the pressure applied to both artificial teats by the teat cup liner. Thus, the pressure-indicating films can be used to measure the pressure between a collapsing liner and an artificial teat. Based on the results of the present investigation, a pressure-indicating film with the measurement ranges of both film types combined would be an optimal tool to measure the overall pressure between an artificial teat and a collapsing liner...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This {{investigation}} was a basal study that used a mouse model of xerostomia to identify protein biomarkers of xerostomia in saliva. We identified genes expressed differently in parotid glands from non-obese diabetic mice with diabetes and those from control mice; subsequently, we investigated {{expression of the}} proteins encoded by these genes in parotid glands and saliva. MATERIALS AND METHODS: DNA microarray and real-time PCR analyses were <b>performed</b> <b>to</b> <b>detect</b> <b>differences</b> between NOD/ShiJcl and C 57 BL/ 6 JJcl (control) female mice in gene expression from parotid glands or parotid acinar cells. Subsequently, protein expression was assessed using immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry. Similarly, enzyme activity in saliva was assessed using zymography. RESULTS: Based on gene expression analyses, Chia expression was higher in diabetic mice than non-diabetic mice and control mice; similarly, expression of chitinase, the protein encoded by Chia, was higher in diabetic mice. Saliva from NOD/ShiJcl mice had more chitinase than saliva from control mice. CONCLUSIONS: Chitinase was highly expressed in parotid acinar cells from diabetic mice compared with non-diabetic and control mice. Increased chitinase expression and enzyme activity may characterize the autoimmune diabetes in mice; however, further investigation is required to assess its use as a biomarker of xerostomia in humans...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} {{the development of}} mutational resistance to antibiotics in staphylococcal biofilms. Methods: Mutation frequencies to resistance against mupirocin and rifampicin were determined for planktonic cultures and for biofilms generated using either a novel static biofilm model or by continuous flow. DNA microarray analysis was <b>performed</b> <b>to</b> <b>detect</b> <b>differences</b> in transcriptional profiles between planktonic and biofilm cultures. Results: The mutability of biofilm cultures increased up to 60 -fold and 4 -fold for S. aureus and S. epidermidis, respectively, compared with planktonic cultures. Incorporation of antioxidants into S. aureus biofilms reduced mutation frequencies, indicating that increased oxidative stress underlies the heightened mutability. Transcriptional profiling of early biofilm cultures revealed up-regulation of the superoxide dismutase gene, sodA, also suggestive of enhanced oxidative stress in these cultures. The addition of catalase to biofilms of S. aureus SH 1000 reduced mutation frequencies, a finding which implicated hydrogen peroxide in increased biofilm mutability. However, catalase {{had no effect on}} biofilm mutability in S. aureus UAMS- 1, suggesting that {{there is more than one}} mechanism by which the mutability of staphylococci may increase during the biofilm mode of growth.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study is to test the {{hypothesis}} that thermal treatment of grade III chondromalacia using radiofrequency energy (RFE) results in greater cartilage smoothing as compared to mechanical debridement and as compared to no treatment. Methods: Fresh human articular cartilage specimens were obtained from patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty for osteoarthritis. One-centimeter square grade ill chondromalacia lesions were identified and randomly assigned to thermal chondroplasty, mechanical chondroplasty or 2 ̆ 2 no treatment 2 ̆ 2 groups. Digital video arthroscopy images were recorded, demonstrating the lesions pre- and post-treatment. Outcomes were assessed using a visual analog scale (VAS) by five orthopedic surgeons who were blinded to the treatment groups.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The shaping {{capacity}} of nickel-titanium (NiTi) rotary instruments is often assessed by photographic or micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) measurements, and these instruments {{are often used}} more than once clinically. This {{study was conducted to}} compare photographic and micro-CT measurements and to assess if the repeated use of NiTi instruments affected the shape of canal preparation. METHODS: Ten new sets of ProTaper Universal instruments (Dentsply-Maillefer, Ballaigues, Switzerland) were used in 60 resin blocks simulating curved root canals. Groups 1 to 6 (n= 10) represented the first to sixth use of the instrument, respectively. Digitized images of the prepared blocks were taken in both mesiodistal (MD) and buccolingual (BL) directions and area measurements (mm(2)) were calculated using AutoCAD (Autodesk Inc, San Rafael, CA). The volumes of the same prepared canals were measured using micro-CT (mm(3)). Statistical analysis was <b>performed</b> <b>to</b> <b>detect</b> <b>differences</b> between photographic and volumetric measurements and differences between uses.

We compared the gut microbiota composition of smoking with nonsmoking patients with CD using a metagenomic approach. METHODS: Stool samples and clinical data were collected from current smokers and nonsmokers with CD from France and the Netherlands, matched for country, gender, age, disease activity, and body mass index. Fecal DNA was sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500. On average, 40 million paired-end reads were generated per sample. Gene richness and the Shannon index were computed to assess microbial diversity. Wilcoxon's signed-rank tests for paired samples were <b>performed</b> <b>to</b> <b>detect</b> <b>differences</b> between the 2 groups. RESULTS: In total, 21 smoking and 21 nonsmoking patients with CD were included. Compared with nonsmoking patients, gut microbial gene richness (P = 0. 01), genus diversity (P < 0. 01), and species diversity (P = 0. 01) were decreased in smoking patients. This was accompanied by a reduced relative abundance of the genera Collinsella (P = 0. 02), Enterorhabdus (P = 0. 02), and Gordonibacter (P = 0. 02) in smokers. No statistically significant differences at the species level were observed, although smokers had lower proportions of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (P = 0. 10). CONCLUSIONS: Gut microbial diversity is reduced in smokers with CD compared with nonsmokers with CD. The microbial profile differs between these groups at the genus level.

MethodsWe evaluated 156 individuals (91 women and 65 men; ages 23. 1 ± 3. 5 y; body mass index 22 ± 2. 9 kg/m 2) for anthropometrics, biochemical markers, clinical, dietary, and some components of the antioxidant defense system, including the plasma TAC. Statistical analyses were <b>performed</b> <b>to</b> <b>detect</b> <b>differences</b> between individuals with TAC higher and lower than the mean value and to screen the associations between TAC and variables of interest. A linear regression model was fitted to identify TAC predictors. ResultsDaily caloric intake and macronutrient consumption were lower in individuals who exhibited the highest TAC values (P < 0. 05). Linear regression analysis showed that daily calories and carbohydrate intake was a possible negative TAC predictor (P < 0. 05). Nevertheless, there was no difference in the values of oxidized low-density lipoprotein in the individuals separated by means of TAC. In contrast, individuals whose plasma TAC values were above the mean showed higher low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations, total cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol values, and selenium in nails (P < 0. 05). ConclusionsIn physiological conditions, the caloric intake level seems to be an important factor to act in the modulation of plasma TAC, before establishing anthropometric impairments of body or metabolic composition, or both. Additionally, the plasma TAC increase may be able to act as a compensatory mechanism...|$|E

40|$|Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is {{the most}} common and {{malignant}} form of primary brain tumors. It is highly invasive and current treatment options have not improved the survival rate over the past twenty years. Novel approaches and technologies from systems biology have the potential to identify biomarkers that could serve as new therapeutic targets for GBM. This study employed lipid profiling technology to investigate lipid biomarkers in ectopic and orthotopic human GBM xenograft models. Primary patient cell lines, GBM 10 and GBM 43, were injected into the flank and the right cerebral hemisphere of NOD/SCID mice. Tumors were harvested from the brain and flank and proteins, metabolites, and lipids extracted from each sample. Reverse phase based high performance liquid chromatography coupled with Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (LC-FTMS) was used to analyze the lipid profiles of tumor samples. Statistical and clustering analyses were <b>performed</b> <b>to</b> <b>detect</b> <b>differences.</b> Over 500 lipids were identified in each tumor model and lipids with the greatest fold effect in the comparison of ectopic versus orthotopic tumor models fell predominantly into four main classes of lipids: glycosphingolipids, glycerophoshpoethanolamines, triradylglycerols, and glycerophosphoserines. Lipidomic analysis revealed differences in glycosphingolipid and triglyceride profiles when the same tumor was propagated in the flank versus the brain.

The assays were <b>performed</b> according <b>to</b> the manufacturer's instructions, and the absorbance of each well was measured using a Thermo Scientific Multiskan MK 3 ELISA reader (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) at 570  nm. The mean and the standard error mean (SEM) for the triplicate wells were reported and normalized. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) statistical analyses were <b>performed</b> <b>to</b> <b>detect</b> the <b>difference</b> between the cells that were incubated with different concentrations of acetylated APTS-coated Fe 3 O 4 NPs and the control cells, which were treated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer. The statistical significance level was set to 0.05.|$|R
40|$|IntroductionNowadays Knee Osteoarthritis (KOA) {{affects a}} large {{percentage}} of the elderly, and one solution is <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> a Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA). In this paper, one intends to study the gait and posture of these patients after the TKA, while walking with three assistive devices (ADs) (crutches, standard walker (SW) and rollator with forearm supports (RFS)). MethodsEleven patients were evaluated in 2 phases: 5 days and 15 days after surgery. This evaluation was conducted with two inertial sensors, one attached to the operated leg ankle, to measure spatiotemporal parameters, and the other at the sacrum, to measure posture and fall risk-related parameters. Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) with repeated measures was <b>performed</b> <b>to</b> <b>detect</b> group <b>differences.</b> ResultsThe MANOVA results show that all spatiotemporal parameters are significantly different (p 0. 05). The interaction between time and ADs only affects significantly the velocity (p< 0. 05). In terms of fall risk parameters, time only significantly affects the antero-posterior direction (p< 0. 05) and ADs affects significantly root mean square in medio-lateral direction (p< 0. 05). In terms of interaction between time and ADs, there are no statistical significant differences. ConclusionThis study concludes that depending on the state of recovery of the patient, different ADs should be prescribed. On the overall, standard walker is good to give stability to the patient and RFS allows the patient to present a gait pattern closer to a natural gait...|$|R

Higginson Gonzaga University, Spokane, WA PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{quantify}} the amount of stability contributed by individual straps when using a military-style backpack. METHODS: Ten college-aged males and females at Gonzaga University were recruited to participate in the current study. The subjects were required to be able to walk with a 27. 3 kg backpack for approximately 15 minutes. Each subject had one visit to the lab to complete the study. During this visit, subjects walked on a treadmill under 5 different conditions: 1) All backpack straps properly fit (A), 2) Waist belt unbuckled (W), 3) Shoulder straps improperly fit (S), 4) Load tensioners improperly fit (T), and 5) All the straps improperly fit (N). Subjects walked at a 6 % incline (U), 0 % grade (L), and - 6 % decline (D) for one minute for each condition, resulting in 15 different trials total. Inertial sensors were placed on the chest of the subject and on the backpack to measure movement in the vertical (V), mediolateral (ML), and anterior/posterior (AP) directions. Video analysis was used to quantify and analyze motion of the pack vs. the motion of the subject using frontal view and sagittal view cameras. A 2 -way (grade x strap) Repeated Measures ANOVA was <b>performed</b> <b>to</b> <b>detect</b> <b>difference</b> in outcome measures of motion between conditions. RESULTS: There was a significant difference between strap conditions in the horizontal (p= 0. 000) and vertical (p= 0. 008) directions in the frontal plane. There was a significant difference in pack motion between grade conditions from the sagittal view in the horizontal direction (D: 2. 44 ± 0. 73 cm, L: 2. 71 ± 0. 88 cm, U: 2. 60 ± 0. 82 cm; p= 0. 013). AP acceleration during condition A was significantly less than the acceleration during condition T (4. 11 ± 1. 27 m/s 2 and 4. 17 ± 1. 73 m/s 2; p= 0. 035). AP acceleration in the W condition was significantly less than the acceleration in the N condition (4. 05 ± 1. 12 m/s 2, 5. 73 ± 5. 26 m/s 2; p= 0. 031) or T condition (4. 05 ± 1. 12 m/s 2, 5. 42 ± 1. 73 m/s 2; p= 0. 022). The AP velocity in the N condition was significantly greater than in A condition (0. 66 ± 0. 19 rad/s, 0. 30 ± 0. 14 rad/s, p= 0. 000) and the T condition (0. 52 ± 0. 76 rad/s, 0. 30 ± 0. 14 rad/s, p= 0. 001). There was no significant difference between the use of a properly strapped pack and one with the discontinued use of the waist belt in any condition. CONCLUSION: Loosening of the load tensioners caused the most instability of any condition, while the waist belt contributed the least to overall pack stability. The most pack motion occurred in the anterior/posterior and mediolateral directions...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{determine}} and compare the expression of endothelin (ET) receptors in the peripheral lungs of healthy horses and those affected with recurrent airway obstruction (RAO) using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), real-time PCR, Western blot analysis, and immunohistochemical techniques. Two groups of horses (7 healthy and 7 RAO-affected) were selected from a pool of horses destined for euthanasia. The grouping of horses was based on the history, clinical scoring, and pulmonary function testing. After euthanasia, gross postmortem evaluation of the lungs was conducted, and lung samples were collected and either stored at − 80 °C or fixed in zinc-formalin for 12 h. The RT-PCR was performed by using specific primers for ETA and ETB receptors, and β-actin. To determine the relative gene expression real-time PCR was performed. To detect ET receptor protein expression, Western blotting and immunohistochemical studies were performed using polyclonal antibodies against ETA and ETB receptors and β-actin. The ET receptor expression was determined by performing either densitometric analyses or scoring of immunostaining. Statistical analyses were <b>performed</b> <b>to</b> <b>detect</b> <b>differences</b> in receptor expression within and between the 2 groups. The results indicated that ET receptor expression, particularly ETB receptors, was significantly greater in the peripheral lungs of RAO-affected horses than in those of healthy horses. Clinical trials using ET receptor antagonists, particularly ETB antagonists might help in developing a therapeutic strategy to treat this career-ending disease...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the associations between plasma total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and anthropometric, biochemical, clinical, and dietary measurements in young and apparently healthy individuals. Methods: We evaluated 156 individuals (91 women and 65 men; ages 23. 1 _ 3. 5 y; body mass index 22 _ 2. 9 kg/m 2) for anthropometrics, biochemical markers, clinical, dietary, and some components of the antioxidant defense system, including the plasma TAC. Statistical analyses were <b>performed</b> <b>to</b> <b>detect</b> <b>differences</b> between individuals with TAC higher and lower than the mean value and to screen the associations between TAC and variables of interest. A linear regression model was fitted to identify TAC predictors. Results: Daily caloric intake and macronutrient consumption were lower in individuals who exhibited the highest TAC values (P < 0. 05). Linear regression analysis showed that daily calories and carbohydrate intake was a possible negative TAC predictor (P < 0. 05). Nevertheless, there was no difference in the values of oxidized low-density lipoprotein in the individuals separated by means of TAC. In contrast, individuals whose plasma TAC values were above the mean showed higher low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations, total cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol values, and selenium in nails (P < 0. 05). Conclusions: In physiological conditions, the caloric intake level seems to be an important factor to act in the modulation of plasma TAC, before establishing anthropometric impairments of body or metabolic composition, or both. Additionally, the plasma TAC increase may be able to act as a compensatory mechanism...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Prior {{studies have}} {{reported}} hippocampal volume loss, decrease in N-Acetylaspartate (NAA) concentration and increased myo-inositol (mI) concentration in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate hippocampal volumes of AD patients and their correlation with metabolic changes detected by proton spectroscopy (1 H MRS) of hippocampal formations and the posterior cingulate region. Materials and Methods: 22 patients with probable AD (18 mild, 4 moderate) and 14 elderly controls without cognitive symptoms, were enrolled in the study. Hippocampal volumetric measurements, single-voxel 1 H MRS of the posterior cingulate region and of hippocampal formations were obtained. The following metabolite ratios were evaluated: NAA/Cr, mI/Cr, mI/NAA. Statistical analysis was <b>performed</b> <b>to</b> <b>detect</b> <b>differences</b> and correlations between these parameters in patients and controls. Results: The hippocampal volume of patients and controls did not differ significantly. The results of 1 H MRS differed significantly between patients and controls in the hippocampal formations (mI/Cr, mI/NAA) and posterior cingulate region (NAA/Cr, mI/Cr, mI/NAA). The best predictor of AD diagnosis was NAA/Cr in the posterior cingulate region, having a sensitivity of 0. 899 and specificity of 0. 800. There was no correlation between hippocampal volumes and the results of 1 H MRS in patients with AD. Conclusions: The results of 1 H MRS differed significantly between patients and controls in hippocampal formations and the posterior cingulate region, with NAA/Cr proving to be the best predictor for AD. No correlation between hippocampal volumes and the results of 1 H MRS in patients with AD was observed...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability of}} marine {{microbes}} to develop tolerance to {{polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons}} (PAHs) was examined in a 90 -day experiment. PAH levels in sediment were increased 0. 3 and 1. 6 times compared to the control sediment. Day 30, 60 and 90 the microbes were re-exposed to PAHs in a short-term toxicity test <b>to</b> <b>detect</b> tolerance, where nitrification and denitrification were used as endpoints. In addition, molecular analysis of the microbial communities was <b>performed</b> <b>to</b> <b>detect</b> possible <b>differences</b> in proportions of nitrifying bacteria compared to total bacterial abundance (amoA/rpoB-ratio) between treatments and control. We here show PAH-induced tolerance in nitrifying microbial communities after 60 and 90 days of pre-exposure, as potential nitrification EC 10 -values were significantly higher in the low treatment (L) after 60 days and in both treatments after 90 days compared to control. Tolerance development in denitrification was not detected. Furthermore, the developed tolerance resulted in reduced nitrification efficiency, compared to control. It was also shown that the induced tolerance produced dissimilar amoA/rpoB-ratio between treatments and control, indicating that development of tolerance changed the community composition and that the development time depended on initial exposure. The {{results from this study}} have implications for future studies or environmental monitoring programs of long-term oil and PAH-contaminated sites. The possibility for development of tolerance needs {{to be taken into account}} and potential nitrification can be used for evaluation of marine microbial health. Furthermore, changed proportions of nitrifying microbes can alter the capacity of ammonium oxidizing in benthic marine sediments...|$|R
40|$|Background. Research {{in younger}} {{patients}} with medically unexplained symptoms (MUS) has shown impairments in social functioning, such as loneliness and a reduced {{quality of the}} patient-doctor relationship. As far as we know, no studies have been performed on social functioning in older MUS patients; self-reported care needs of older MUS patients remain unknown. Objective. To explore social characteristics and care needs of older persons with chronic MUS, when compared to older persons with chronic medically explained symptoms (MES). Methods. Patient characteristics of 107 older persons (> 60 years) with chronic MUS were compared to 150 older persons with chronic MES in a case-control design. Participants were recruited via advertisements, general practices and a specialized clinic. All participants completed questionnaires on social functioning; the Camberwell Assessment of Need for the Elderly was used to draw up care needs. Linear regression analyses were <b>performed</b> <b>to</b> explore the association between social characteristics and group (MUS/MES), adjusted for demographic and physical determinants. Multiple chi-square tests were <b>performed</b> <b>to</b> <b>detect</b> between-group <b>differences</b> regarding care needs. Results. After adjustments, older MUS patients were slightly but significantly lonelier, reported a somewhat lower quality of their patient-doctor relationship, but reported equal social support levels when compared to MES patients. MUS patients more often reported unmet care needs regarding health and information provision about their health status. Conclusion. Only small differences in social functioning were found between older MUS and MES patients. Possibly, training future doctors in giving acceptable explanations for the patient's complaints could improve the unmet care need of information provision in older MUS patients...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Emergent {{placement}} of a chest tube is a potentially life-saving procedure, but rate of misplacement and organ injury {{is up to}} 30 %. In principle, chest tube insertion can be performed by using Trocar or Non-trocar techniques. If using trocar technique, two different chest tubes (equipped with sharp or blunt tip) are currently commercially available. This study was <b>performed</b> <b>to</b> <b>detect</b> any <b>difference</b> with respect to time until tube insertion, to success and to misplacement rate. Methods Twenty emergency physicians performed five tube thoracostomies using both blunt and sharp tipped tube kits in 100 fresh human cadavers (100 thoracostomies with each kit). Time until tube insertion served as primary outcome. Complications and success rate were examined by pathological dissection and served as further outcomes parameters. Results Difference in mean time until tube insertion (63 s vs. 59 s) was statistically not significant. In both groups, time for insertion decreased from the 1 st to the 5 th attempt and showed dependency on the cadaver's BMI and on the individual physician. Success rate differed between both groups (92 % using blunt vs. 86 % using sharp tipped kits) and injuries and misplacements occurred significantly more frequently using chest tubes with sharp tips (p = 0. 04). Conclusion Data suggest that chest drain insertion with trocars {{is associated with a}} 6 - 14 % operator-related complication rate. No difference in average time could be found. However, misplacements and organ injuries occurred more frequently using sharp tips. Consequently, if using a trocar technique, the use of blunt tipped kits is recommended. </p...|$|R
