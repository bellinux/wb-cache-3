5|$|On the 29th divisional front two battalions of the 116th Infantry Regiment {{cleared the}} last {{defenders}} from the bluffs while the remaining 116th battalion joined the Rangers in their move west along the coast. This force relieved the 2nd Ranger companies who were holding Pointe du Hoc on June 8 and subsequently forced the German 914th Grenadiers and the 439th Ost-Battalion {{to withdraw from}} the Grandcamp area which lay further to the west. Early on June 7 WN-69 defending St. Laurent was abandoned and the 115th Infantry Regiment was therefore able to push inland to the south-west, reaching the Formigny area on June 7 and the original D-Day <b>phase</b> <b>line</b> the following day. The third regiment of 29th Division; the 175th, started landing on June 7. By the morning of June 9 this regiment had taken Isigny and on the evening of the following day forward patrols established contact with the 101st Airborne Division, thus linking Omaha with Utah.|$|E

25|$|An unusual {{feature of}} the water phase diagram is that the solid–liquid <b>phase</b> <b>line</b> (illustrated by the dotted green line) has a {{negative}} slope. For most substances, the slope is positive as exemplified by the dark green line. This unusual feature of water is related to ice having a lower density than liquid water. Increasing the pressure drives the water into the higher density phase, which causes melting.|$|E
25|$|The three {{divisions}} of the I Corps started toward line Cairo at 08:00 on March 22.

25|$|Experimentally, {{the phase}} lines are {{relatively}} easy to map due to the interdependence of temperature and pressure that develops when multiple phases forms. See Gibbs' phase rule. Consider a test apparatus consisting of a closed and well insulated cylinder equipped with a piston. By charging {{the right amount of}} water and applying heat, the system can be brought to any point in the gas region of the phase diagram. If the piston is slowly lowered, the system will trace a curve of increasing temperature and pressure within the gas region of the phase diagram. At the point where gas begins to condense to liquid, the direction of the temperature and pressure curve will abruptly change to trace along the <b>phase</b> <b>line</b> until all of the water has condensed.|$|E
30|$|Algorithm 1 {{presents}} the pseudocode of stage 1. The random vectors are initially generated and cached on HDFS {{in order to}} be accessible by all the nodes which take part in the execution. They are then given as input to the algorithm, along with datasets R and S. Notice that v_ 1 = 0 ⃗ indicating that the datasets are not shifted during this iteration. This process takes place α times, where α is the number of shifts (Line 5). After shifting the datasets, during the first mapping <b>phase</b> (<b>Lines</b> 5 – 9), the elements’ SFC values are calculated and collected to R̂^T_i and Ŝ^T_i, where i= 1,...,α. Then, the sampling is performed by the second mapping <b>phase</b> (<b>Lines</b> 10 – 17). During the reduce <b>phase</b> (<b>Lines</b> 18 – 22), the partition ranges (Rrange_i and Srange_i) for each shift are calculated using the sampled datasets and broadcast to stage 2 (Lines 18 – 20). The output consists of the unified transformed datasets, which finally feed the data partitioning and organization stage (Line 22).|$|R

[...] This was also the first combat experienced by the new 13th South African Motorised Brigade (13th Mot Bde) which had been sent from South Africa to replace the 24th Guards Brigade. The battle had been fierce for all the division's troops involved and in the succeeding successful exploitation of Monte Caprara heavy losses were incurred. On 21 April, 11th Armd Brigade, who were supporting the U.S. 349th Engineering Regiment, converged on the centre of the town of San Matteo della Decima. [...] Soon furious house-to-house fighting erupted which continued until nightfall and resulted in several tanks being destroyed by fire from German Panzerfaust rockets. [...] Poole committed all available South African troops to flush out German snipers and anti-tank positions and by 22 April all resistance had ceased.|$|E

40|$|The six <b>phase</b> {{transmission}} <b>line</b> {{has received}} considerable attention {{in recent times}} {{as an alternative to}} the three phase transmission, since it possess several advantages over three <b>phase</b> transmission <b>line.</b> Six-phase transmission line can provide same power transfer capability as three phase on a smaller right-of- way, for the same electric field and audible noise criteria, with smaller structures and reduced overall cost. A total of 120 faults can occur in six <b>phase</b> transmission <b>line.</b> The design of adequate protective scheme is essential for the protection of six <b>phase</b> transmission <b>line.</b> This paper reports the application of Artificial Neural Network for protection of six <b>phase</b> transmission <b>line</b> against six <b>phase</b> to ground faults, which has not been reported yet to the best of the knowledge of the authors.
