5|$|Organ pipes {{are divided}} into flue <b>pipes</b> <b>and</b> reed pipes {{according}} to their design and timbre. Flue pipes produce sound by forcing air through a fipple, {{like that of a}} recorder, whereas reed pipes produce sound via a beating reed, like that of a clarinet or saxophone.|$|E

5|$|The {{most common}} gas welding process is oxyfuel welding, {{also known as}} {{oxyacetylene}} welding. It {{is one of the}} oldest and most versatile welding processes, but in recent years it has become less popular in industrial applications. It is still widely used for welding <b>pipes</b> <b>and</b> tubes, as well as repair work.|$|E
50|$|The <b>pipe</b> <b>and</b> tabor {{are also}} known as 'whittle and dub' and 'whit and dub' {{in some parts of}} the country. <b>Pipe</b> <b>and</b> tabor playing survived into the 20th century. It was close to {{extinction}} in the early part of the century, but a revival of interest occurred <b>and</b> the English <b>pipe</b> <b>and</b> tabor tradition remains alive in morris dancing, early music and all manner of cultural displays.|$|R

The national release event for the cigar will be on September 20th, 2014, at The <b>Pipe</b> <b>and</b> Pint, with Don Pepin Garcia in attendance.|$|R
5|$|The pavilion's {{construction}} was {{aided by the}} French CATIA software program and internet conferencing. Early plans to incorporate a surrounding waterfall and stairway were abandoned. In the end, budget limitations led to compromises with the original architectural plan that left many elements in their most straightforward form, such as exposed <b>pipes</b> <b>and</b> conduits, or rough concrete.|$|E
5|$|Built by J.W.Walker and Sons, {{the organ}} was {{completed}} {{only two days}} before the opening of the cathedral in 1967. Made {{as an integral part of}} the new cathedral, the architect, Frederick Gibberd, saw the casework as part of his brief and so designed the striking front to the organ. Using decorative woodwork, Gibberd was inspired by the innovative use of the pipes at Coventry Cathedral and the Royal Festival Hall and so arranged the shiny zinc <b>pipes</b> <b>and</b> brass trumpets en chamade to contrast strikingly with concrete pillars which surround the organ.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{started in}} January 2008. To pass over Strømmen, a fourth Nygård Bridge {{was built for}} cars, and the oldest was {{upgraded}} and used by the light rail line. In several places the road needed to be dug up to remove <b>pipes</b> <b>and</b> cables. In November 2009, Gulating Court of Appeal ruled that the power company BKK had to pay 80 million NOK for the moving of power lines, and could not charge the costs to the project. By June 2008, the first tracks had been laid.|$|E

5|$|In March 2011 an {{assessment}} of the Greyfriars site began to identify where the monastery had stood, and which land might be available for excavation. A desk-based assessment was conducted to determine the archaeological viability of the site, followed by a survey in August 2011 using ground-penetrating radar (GPR). The GPR results were inconclusive; no clear building remains could be identified owing to a layer of disturbed ground and demolition debris just below the surface. The survey was useful in finding modern utilities crossing the site, such as <b>pipes</b> <b>and</b> cables.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} with Mesopotamia and Egypt, professional musicians {{did not exist}} in Israel between 2000 and 1000 BC. While the history of musical instruments in Mesopotamia and Egypt relies on artistic representations, the culture in Israel produced few such representations. Scholars must therefore rely on information gleaned from the Bible and the Talmud. The Hebrew texts mention two prominent instruments associated with Jubal: the ugab (<b>pipes)</b> <b>and</b> kinnor (lyre). Other instruments of the period included the tof (frame drum), pa'amon (small bells or jingles), shofar, and the trumpet-like hasosra.|$|E
5|$|Nova {{is highly}} agile, acrobatic, {{and able to}} perform {{maneuvers}} such as mantling and climbing ledges, hanging from <b>pipes,</b> <b>and</b> sliding down ziplines. The player has access to Nova's psionic powers honed through training as a ghost agent, {{such as the ability}} to improve her speed and reflexes drastically. StarCraft: Ghost includes many of the vehicle units featured in StarCraft and StarCraft: Brood War. Some vehicles, such as space battlecruisers and starfighters, only play support roles, while others, such as hoverbikes, scout cars, and futuristic siege tanks, can be piloted by the player.|$|E

5|$|Paint-like gels (which are {{dispensed}} from <b>pipes</b> <b>and</b> can {{be transported}} through portals) impart certain properties to surfaces or objects coated with them. Players can use orange Propulsion Gel to cross surfaces more quickly, blue Repulsion Gel to bounce from a surface, and white Conversion Gel to allow surfaces to accept portals. Only {{one type of}} gel can be effective on a certain surface at a time only. Some surfaces, such as grilles, cannot be coated with a gel. Water can block or wash away gels, returning the surface or object to its normal state.|$|E
5|$|The double bottoms {{are also}} subject to design constraints. The primary {{concern is that}} they be high enough to allow the passage of <b>pipes</b> <b>and</b> cables. These areas must also be roomy enough to allow people safe access to perform surveys and maintenance. On the other hand, {{concerns}} of excess weight and wasted volume keep the double bottoms very tight spaces.|$|E
5|$|The pub {{also has}} a lawned pub garden {{to the north and}} a car park to the south. The car park has a {{covenant}} that prevents it from being built upon, with underground channels, cables and <b>pipes,</b> <b>and</b> an adjacent substation. A well is also located in the rear yard of the pub, one of a number in the immediate area.|$|E

In the 1010s, {{during the reign of}} Catholicos Sarkis I, a mausoleum dedicated to the Hripsimean virgins was erected next to the cathedral. The mausoleum was built on some of the remnants of the virgins brought from Vagharshapat (Etchmiadzin). In the 1040s–1050s inscriptions were left on the cathedral's eastern and western walls about urban projects, such as restoration of defensive walls, installation of water <b>pipes</b> <b>and</b> easing of the tax burden on the residents of Ani.|$|E
5|$|Although {{he learned}} his {{repertoire}} {{by listening to}} elders perform traditional pieces, Rakoto Frah often performed personalized variations and interpreted the traditional airs in original ways. The themes addressed in his songs ranged from serious to light-hearted and could touch on social concerns, behavior and the description of places. Rakoto Frah used both traditional flutes and those he crafted himself using diverse locally available materials. These included flutes crafted from sections of metal ski poles, PVC <b>pipes</b> <b>and</b> plastic curtain rods. He was never known to be without a flute and was widely respected for his musical virtuosity and his kindness alike. Rakoto Frah described music {{the most important element}} of life, even more important to him than his own family. Over the course of his career, the artist produced more than 800pieces of instrumental and vocal music.|$|E
5|$|By early 1997, {{after almost}} two decades of activity, the only repairs {{completed}} were phase one of the air ventilation system to dehumidify the hollow base, the drainage <b>pipes</b> <b>and</b> a new inner roof. Plans now included the erection of a temporary two-story metal building to protect all but the giant Father Time from the harsh winters and to facilitate year-round repair; the reinforcement of corroded steel interior portions; the replacement of inconsistent patches; the substitution of engineered spacing for natural cracks, and finally, hand-brushed concrete recoating. The temporary building was budgeted at $270,000; the city spent a total of $450,000 on repairs approved by the Park District that year.|$|E
50|$|Later burner designs {{called the}} Haigill system and {{designated}} Mark II to Mark VI were simpler and more efficient, requiring only three lengths of pipe. Earlier versions of Haigill used two runs of evaporator <b>pipe</b> <b>and</b> one burner <b>pipe,</b> later versions used one run of evaporator <b>pipe</b> <b>and</b> two burner <b>pipes.</b>|$|R
50|$|Thermally {{developed}} flow {{results in}} reduced heat transfer compared to developing flow because {{the difference between}} the surface temperature of the <b>pipe</b> <b>and</b> the mean temperature of the flow is greater than the temperature difference between surface temperature of the <b>pipe</b> <b>and</b> the temperature of the fluid near the pipe boundary.|$|R

5|$|Changes of {{sediment}} {{patterns in the}} creek have also created another problem. Stemming from the construction of structures interfering with stream flow, and increased runoff from the urban areas adjoining the creek, excessive erosion has created problems not limited to just the creek. The creek is eroding material from its bed and transporting it to the ocean, but naturally, sediment from the whole watershed flowed towards the main stem via a complex network of tributaries. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers warned in a 1997 study that up to $4.2million in damage occurs per year {{as a result of}} the pollution of Aliso Creek and its neighbor San Juan Creek. This includes physical damage to creek banks, bridges, <b>pipes</b> <b>and</b> other creekside structures.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{started in}} November 1996, with the moving of {{underground}} <b>pipes</b> <b>and</b> wires around the station areas. In August 1997, work {{started at the}} depot, and in September, COMET started the first mainline work. In October and November, the two tunnel boring machines (TBM), christened Liva and Bette, were delivered. They started boring each barrel of the tunnel from Islands Brygge in February 1998. The same month, the Public Transport Authority gave the necessary permits to operate a driverless metro. The section between Fasanvej and Frederiksberg is a former S-train line, and was last operated as such on 20 June 1998.|$|E
5|$|Deep frying {{produces}} {{large amounts}} of waste oil, which must be disposed of properly. Waste oil can overflow sewage systems, bind to the walls of sewage <b>pipes,</b> <b>and</b> interfere with sewage treatment. Waste oil from deep frying is increasingly being recycled and refined into biodiesel. Potatoes that are stored in artificially humidified warehouses contain more water, which makes {{the time required to}} deep fry them into chips longer. This increases the carbon dioxide footprint of commercially producing chips because more energy is required for frying over a longer time. According to one source, an average home appliance deep fryer draws 2,000 watts.|$|E
