40|$|The paper aims at {{investigating}} on {{the credit}} conditions experienced by Italian firms {{during the recent}} business cycle. In doing so, we use a novel dataset on firms’ opinions derived from the ISTAT Business Confidence surveys. The dataset allows us to add to existing literature in three different ways: first of all, {{the availability of a}} very rich set of information on firms' perceptions enables us to study a number of factors possibly influencing credit conditions at the firm level; secondly, the analysis may be extended beyond the Manufacturing sector, considering also the Construction, Retail and Services sectors; thirdly, the high frequency of the data helps in shedding light into the most recent period following the sovereign debt crisis, for which available evidence is still scarce. Starting from these considerations, three different panel data model are estimated, relating the probability of being credit constrained to various individual characteristics of the firms and of the sector in which they operate. Obtaining credit for Italian firms results to be easier in the North and being a Medium-Large firm. Moreover, access to credit is also found to crucially depend on individual credit worthiness; in Manufacturing, productive internationalization is found to {{have a negative effect on}} access to credit. Over time, credit conditions are particularly negative during the financial crisis, progressively recovering in 2009 - 2010. A new deterioration has been perceived by Italian firms since mid- 2011, with the emerging of the sovereign debt crisis; this assessment is <b>progressively</b> <b>translating</b> into an effective credit rationing towards the end of last year and in the first months of 2012. ...|$|E
40|$|Chemical-mechanical {{planarization}} (CMP) is a {{key process}} {{in the manufacture of}} ultra-large-scale-integrated (ULSI) semiconductor devices. A major concern in CMP is non-uniform planarization, or polishing, at the wafer-scale - primarily as interconnect metal dishing and dielectric erosion. In conventional face-down CMP, the pad is much larger than the wafer and the wafer is always in contact with the pad. Thus, non-uniform polishing rate at the wafer-scale is due to variations in relative velocity, normal pressure, and especially slurry distribution at the wafer/pad interface. Wafer-scale polishing uniformity requirements are expected to be even more stringent in the future as the ULSI technology advances toward larger wafers (450 mm) and ever shrinking feature sizes (< 20 nm). This thesis presents the theory and experimental validation of a novel, face-up CMP architecture proposed for achieving a high degree, better than 95 percent of polishing uniformity at the wafer-scale. The novel design utilizes a small, perforated pad that contacts only a portion of the wafer during CMP. Polishing uniformity is achieved by <b>progressively</b> <b>translating</b> the pad away from the polished to the unpolished regions of the wafer. The theory is based on Preston's Law for material removal rate and an optimal algorithm for pad translation. CMP experiments were conducted on both blanket and patterned wafers to validate the theory. Polishing of blanket wafers by non-translating pads showed that the Preston constant is higher {{at the center of the}} pad due to increased slurry flow. Thus, perforations at the pad center were blocked to minimize the variation in Preston constant. Face-up polishing of patterned wafers with the blocked pad showed improved wafer-scale uniformity in material removal rate. (cont.) Dielectric erosion was below 30 nm, less than 5 percent of the interconnect depth, across a 100 -mm circular polished region. However, dishing of the wider interconnects was much greater. Nevertheless, the variation in dishing across the 100 [mu]m region was less than 35 nm for linewidths ranging from 2. 5 [mu]m to 100 [mu]m, also less than 5 percent. Based on the theory and experimental results, several suggestions for further improving face-up CMP to minimize Cu dishing and dielectric erosion are offered. by Catherine Mau. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|Because “not every {{international}} environmental problem {{needs to be}} dealt with on a global level[1]”, the regionalization of {{international environmental}} law has {{emerged as one of the}} most important legal trends over the last decades. In the field of marine environment, this movement has been taking place mostly within the UNEP regional seas programme, now involving over 140 States. Noteworthily, the regulation of coastal management stood apart from this movement for a long time: while coastal zone management projects have developed at all scales for over two decades[2], legal regulation has long been confined to the national and sub-national levels. From the 1972 US Coastal Zone Management Act to the 2008 South African Integrated Coastal Management Act, domestic legal frameworks have regularly been strengthened in most parts of the world, while <b>progressively</b> <b>translating</b> into law the Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) concept. However, most recent developments in ICZM implementation demonstrate an increasing interest for a regional regulation through the adoption of ad hoc protocols within regional seas frameworks. Adopted in January 2008 and entered into force in March 2011, the Mediterranean ICZM Protocol is the first of its kind and constitutes, as of today, the only supra-State legal instrument specifically aimed at coastal zone management. It is however unlikely that the Mediterranean ICZM Protocol remain an isolated, legal alien in the regional seas landscape. The attractiveness of such a new kind of instrument seems to be increasing, as demonstrated by the recent decision of the Parties to the Nairobi Convention to follow the path of the Barcelona Convention[3]. The Black Sea is also more informally now looking at the opportunity to develop such a protocol. It appears timely, therefore, to start drawing some early lessons from the most advanced cases, that is the Mediterranean and Western Indian Ocean (WIO). This is precisely what this presentation will aim at, based on research and consultancy conducted over the last five years in these two regions as well as at the global level. In particular, this presentation will: (i) briefly remind the regional seas concept and institutional framework; (ii) provide an overview of the content of the Mediterranean and WIO ICZM Protocols; (iii) enumerate the expected benefits of having a regional, legally binding regulation instrument for ICZM; (iv) identify key necessary conditions for success on the regional and national contexts, the drafting and negotiation process, as well as the way implementation issues are anticipated. This presentation will thus identify key conditions under which such ICZM Protocols may actually make a difference in placing coastal areas on a sustainable path. [1] Alhéritière D.

Particularly, consumers’ increasing interest in health and environmental issues has been <b>progressively</b> <b>translated</b> into a bigger attention to natural products. In the context of consumers’ choice for natural products, the aim of this study was to analyze consumers’ interest and willingness to pay (WTP) for natural food, understanding whether such interest is driven by hedonistic/personal or altruistic/collective reasons, and to test the effect of different types of information on natural chewing gum.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{examines}} {{the role that}} the precautionary principle (PP) has played in the transformation of the French regulatory landscape for genetically modified organisms used in food and agriculture over the last decade. Despite few explicit references to the PP, we argue that this principle has been instrumental. The changes do not result from a linear top-down process, as in the application of a new law. Instead, the PP has acted as a point of articulation between debates occurring in different public arenas, and that it is through these debates that the PP has been <b>progressively</b> <b>translated</b> into pragmatic actions and practices. New boundaries have been drawn between risk assessment and risk management practices. This has facilitated the progressive emergence of a distinct arena of scientific expertise and opens the possibility for a reciprocal emancipation of public decision and scientific expertise...|$|R
40|$|Commemorations and reparations {{are central}} {{elements}} of the transitional justice agenda. The inclusion of memory-related measures among the steps that states are expected to take along the transitional process has been <b>progressively</b> <b>translated</b> from the transitional justice domain {{to the language of}} international law. Judicial and quasi-judicial human rights instances have required states to make and undertake memorials, commemorations and public acts of remembrance, both as an instrument of reparation for the individual victim and as a mechanism to warn against the repetition of the same abuses in the future. As a result of this trend, memory-related measures have progressively become part of the state obligation to provide reparations to victims. The inclusion of memory-related measures in the scope of the international obligation to repair, however, raises some thorny issues. This review of the jurisprudence of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights in relation to memory-related orders and analysis of the case of the memorial El Ojo que Llora in Peru critically assesses the emerging trend of using memory-related initiatives as measures of reparation determined by judicial organs...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: One of the {{critical}} success factors for integration of a Defence system is a good architectural design. A right architecture can help ensure that a system will satisfy its key operational requirements {{as well as its}} quality attributes such as real-time performance, reliability, security, and maintainability. A bad architecture on the other hand is a recipe for disaster (Clements et. al. 2001). Emerging properties of systems such as scheduling, fault tolerance, and security can cause significant problems in integration of complex Defence systems. Life-cycles are becoming evolutionary as components of systems are upgraded to avoid obsolescence, but such upgrades must be done in the context of system impact (Allen et. al. 2002). Software intensive acquisition projects are historically considered the most risk prone in the Defence domain and often incur schedule delays, cost overruns, and reduced operational capability (Commonwealth of Australia 2004). Capability systems have a “life cycle ” that begins with the identification of the need to address a current or prospective capability gap. This need is <b>progressively</b> <b>translated</b> into a working capability system that is operated and supported until it is ultimately withdrawn from service. Architecture modelling and analysis can potentially be incorporated to the Defence Capability Life Cycle (DCLC) (Commonwealth of Australia 2006) for assessing technical risks associated with proposed system architectures...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} study {{focuses on the}} social protection sector in Kenya, with a special emphasis on social assistance programmes. Although Kenya has made strides {{in terms of economic}} development and the improvement of access to education and healthcare, 45. 9 % of the population continues to survive on less than $ 1. 25 a day. It is evident that many challenges lay ahead in tacking the issue of poverty and deprivation in Kenya. However, the state, with support from external actors, has invested in the development of social assistance measures such as cash transfer programmes as a means of providing support to the poorest and most vulnerable households in Kenya. This {{research study}} investigated why and how these cash transfer programmes were adopted and delivered in addition to whether social transfer programmes helped the poor and vulnerable to progressively realise their economic, social and cultural rights. Findings showed that social assistance measures such as cash transfer programmes has a positive impact on the well-being of households that took part in programmes. Examples of this include increased households consumption and nutrition, increased access to social services such as health clinics and schools in addition to vulnerable groups feeling empowered and catered for by the state. Although Kenya is far from successfully addressing developmental challenges, the investment in social protection as a tool to address poverty and vulnerability shows remarkable promise. However, it is imperative that the state fully understands its role as a duty bearer and its need to remain accountable to its citizens. Moreover, the state’s point of departure when strengthening its long term social protection strategy and framework should be on the foundation of understanding social protection as a right of which its citizens are entitled. This in turn will <b>progressively</b> <b>translate</b> into more meaningful and tangible results that are universal and accessible by Kenyans who are entitled a decent quality of life. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{call for}} {{improvement}} to conventional design and con­struction {{process in the}} construction industry is well reported. Essentially, the need for develop­ment is associated with the poor performance of building projects. In this respect, the design and construction briefing process aims to identify the requirements of the client and other relevant stakeholders. The subject for this thesis is design and construction briefing with a specific focus on the construction clients' perspective of the briefing process. In addition, this thesis examines tools that could help improve the briefing process. This thesis is based on four papers reporting on an explorative case study, an interview study and two literature reviews. Focus is on the brief as an information carrier document, the conditions under which a briefing process is carried out, briefing tools and the facilitation of a briefing process. Theories of design, value engineering, and requirements engineering form the basis of the discussion. The studies conclude that there are different types of briefing processes: some briefing processes are intended to satisfy internal objectives of the construction processes, and others strive to meet external efficiency such as satisfying the client's business goals. Furthermore, a trend of increased interest, in Sweden, for process-oriented and strategic briefing is indicated. Moreover, the results shows that the brief acts as a decisive interactive element in which the client's needs and requirements are <b>progressively</b> captured and <b>translated</b> to be incorporated throughout the design and con­struction process. The conditions for the briefing professi­onal  acting as client representative or process facilitator in the dia­logue between the client and the design and construction team ­ needs further study...|$|R
