After it abates of the animals had been collected the agencies that compose the genital system and lead to the Laboratory of Animal Pathology of the Institution for pathological alterations evaluation. The joined pathologys had been hydrosalpinges and ovarian hypoplasia with four cases each (28. 6 %),one (6. 7 %) case of persistent corpus luteum associate to mucometra and 2 (14. 3 %) cases of ovarian cysts.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the activities of some serum enzymes <b>of</b> <b>Collared</b> dove (Streptopelia decaocto) and Laughing dove (Streptopelia senegalensis) as a species classification. Twenty (10 males and 10 females) individuals <b>of</b> <b>Collared</b> dove and eighteen (10 males and 8 females) of Laughing dove were collected from different regions of Baghdad city during two seasons, winter and summer. Serum enzymes in three replicates for each species in both sexes were determined. Results revealed significant species differences in serum enzymes (P< 0. 05). Collared dove dominated Laughing dove in the average values of serum GOT, GPT and AP in winter season. Also, significant species differences were found in serum enzymes activity (P< 0. 05) during summer season. Collared dove predominated Laughing dove in the average values of studied enzymes with high values compared with winter. Significant sex differences were found in serum enzymes activity (P< 0. 05). Males of the two species predominated females in the values of studied enzymes during the two seasons...|$|R
50|$|This is a 12-13.5 cm long bird, {{intermediate}} {{in appearance}} between collared flycatcher and European pied flycatcher.

50|$|The {{collared}} sparrowhawk is not globally or nationally threatened. It {{is widespread}} and generally uncommon, {{but may be}} common in forests in the tropics and subtropics; it is also secretive and most likely under-recorded. It has undergone declines in extensively cleared areas. It is thought that their loss of numbers {{is due to the}} use of DDT which has reduced the thickness <b>of</b> <b>collared</b> sparrowhawks' eggs by 2%, and the increase of the pied currawong (Strepera graculina) a predator and competitor capable of robbing and injuring adults and killing nestlings.|$|R
50|$|In central Alaska, {{within the}} Pleistocene deposits, {{preserved}} specimens <b>of</b> <b>collared</b> pika were found {{along with some}} dung pellets; in addition to central Alaska, the Yukon territory also contained some fossilized specimens. The studies of the size variation of the fossils showed that the morphology of Pleistocene pikas was flexible with the alteration of environments from early to middle Pleistocene in both Alaska and Yukon.

50|$|The world's largest {{population}} of {{loggerhead sea turtle}} (Caretta caretta) breeds on Masirah Island and other turtles that come to these coasts include the olive ridley (Lepydochelys olivacea), green turtle (Chelonia mydas) and the endangered hawksbill turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata). The area is extremely rich in birdlife including a large migration between Asia and Africa. Endemic birds include a species <b>of</b> <b>collared</b> kingfisher.

Other harsh calls are produced during aggressive encounters.|$|R
40|$|Parturient female caribou {{from the}} Teshekpuk caribou (Rangifer tarandus granti) herd (TCH) have been {{observed}} across the western North Slope, but most cows that were seen with calves during the calving period were in the area surrounding Teshekpuk Lake. During surveys conducted between 1994 and 2003, 155 (91 %) <b>of</b> 171 <b>collared</b> cows seen with calves were within an area given protected status in the 1998 Bureau of Land Management Final Integrated Activity Plan/Environmental Impact Statement (IAP/EIS). The percentage <b>of</b> adult <b>collared</b> cows seen with a calf between 1994 and 2003 has ranged from 44 % to 86 %, {{with a mean of}} 66 %. The years with the lowest percentage <b>of</b> <b>collared</b> cows seen with calves were 1997 (50 %) and 2001 (44 %). In 1997 most of the herd migrated much farther south than usual, and in 2001 unusually deep, persistent snow restricted spring migration, resulting in fewer cows returning to the traditional calving area during the calving period. When snowmelt dates were earlier, calving locations were farther north. Average standardized travel rates for parturient cows were significantly greater before they had calves (7. 25 km/day) than after 3. 89 (km/day). Geographically, protections granted by the 1998 BLM IAP/EIS appear to adequately cover the concentrated calving grounds, allowing for variance in the annual distribution of calving cows...|$|R

50|$|A {{few days}} later, an abrupt government-sanctioned aerial wolf hunt began in Alaska. It was {{initiated}} within {{only a few}} hours after the Alaska Department of Fish and Game told the National Park Service that such an effort was going to be undertaken in the area around Tanana. With about 200 wolves being the goal stated for the hunt, more than 30 were killed within the first day, including those that had been radio-collared for research purposes. The National Park Service was greatly displeased with the loss <b>of</b> <b>collared</b> wolves, as they had been the part of a 20-year study.|$|R
