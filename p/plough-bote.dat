The various kinds of {{estovers}} were known as house-bote, cart or <b>plough-bote,</b> hedge or hay-bote, and fire-bote. Anglo-Saxon law also imposed [...] "bot" [...] fines in the modern sense of compensation. These rights might be restricted by express covenants. Copyholders had similar rights over the land they occupied and over the waste of the manor, {{in which case the}} rights are known as Commons of estovers.|$|E
