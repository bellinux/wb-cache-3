40|$|We {{summarize}} the inspections of radiocesium concentration levels in rice produced in Fukushima Prefecture, Japan, for 3 {{years from the}} nuclear accident in 2011. In 2011, three types of verifications, preliminary survey, main inspection, and emergency survey, revealed that rice with radiocesium concentration levels over 500  Bq/kg (the <b>provisional</b> <b>regulation</b> level until March 2012 in Japan) was identified in the areas north and west of the Fukushima nuclear power plant. The internal exposure of an average adult eating rice grown in the area north of the nuclear plant was estimated as 0. 05  mSv/year. In 2012, Fukushima Prefecture authorities decided to investigate the radiocesium concentration levels in all rice using custom-made belt conveyor testers. Notably, rice with radiocesium concentration levels over 100  Bq/kg (the new standard since April 2012 in Japan) were detected in only 71 and 28 bags out of the total 10, 338, 000 in 2012 and 11, 001, 000 in 2013, respectively.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{important}} private law institute of preliminary injunctions used for the <b>provisional</b> <b>regulation</b> of the circumstances of minors. The fundamental legal principle on which the paper is based is {{the principle of the}} best interests of the child, largely based on Art. 3 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which states that {{the best interests of the}} child shall be a primary consideration in any decision-making concerning children. Emphasis is placed on the child's legal status as a party to the proceedings for a preliminary injunction and the consequent rights of the minor, focusing on the child's right to be heard. The individual chapters are devoted to a detailed analysis of Czech legislation relating to the topic in question, both under the current wording of the law and current application in practice. The first chapter offers a concise introduction to the addressed issue. The second chapter provides definitions of the key concepts related to the topic. The third chapter discusses the position of the child as a party to the proceedings for the issue of a preliminary injunction, their procedural personality and procedural capacity, representation of the child in the process itself and, last but not least, the interests of the child, and their fundamental rights to be [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{radioactive}} materials {{released in the}} accident at the Fukushima Dai’ichi Nuclear Power Plant have forced many residents in Fukushima Prefecture, including members of Co-op Fukushima, currently living {{as they do in}} an environment exposed to radiation, to live in the shadow of anxiety that they may be subject to internal radiation exposure. A dietary survey was therefore conducted using the duplicate diet method on 300 participating Co-op member families over three periods for the purpose of investigating the intake of {{radioactive materials}} through everyday meals and thereby providing accurate information about existing conditions of internal radiation expo-sure. Neither 134 Cs nor 137 Cs was detected in excess of the lower detection limit of 1 Bq/kg in the meals of 283 of the 300 families (i. e., 94 %). In the meals of 17 families, 134 Cs or 137 Cs was detected in excess of 1 Bq/kg. Of these, the greatest internal exposure dose for both of the radionuclides was observed in the period “I winter ” (November 2011 thru April 2012) of the three-period sur-vey. This coincided with the implementation period of the <b>Provisional</b> <b>Regulation</b> Values, which set a maximum annual exposure dose of 5 mSv.

40|$|The 2003 Amendment of the French Constitution has introduced, amongsome other changes, {{the express}} {{recognition}} of “legal experimentation”, asa legal technique to reinforce decentralization. This technique allows toprovisionally set {{the content of}} regulation from both its decision-making andimplementation processes. In this sense, both the institution that defines therule (that enacts it) and the institution that has to implement it, can evaluatethe actual results of that <b>provisional</b> <b>regulation</b> and establish and define itsfinal version according to such an evaluation. This legal technique can haveconsequences that go far beyond the mere search for legal efficacy, such asthe impacts upon the democratic principle. One can ask whether legal experimentationcan be of any use in Spain for clarifying several aspects relatedto the development of political decentralization, particularly as a means tobetter define the limits of a highly controversial constitutional power inhands of central institutions: that of enacting state-wide basic legislation. Inthe last years, Spanish central institutions have made a very broad readingabout {{the scope of this}} constitutional competence. Its legal implementation has actually reduced the legal and political margin of manoeuvre left to theAutonomous Communities (AC). In turn, the AC have reacted back by severalmeans, such as appealing to the Constitutional Court and as shielding powersin their own Statutes of Autonomy. As long as central government does notredefine the basic aspects of a regulation by reducing them to the mereruling principles, legal experimentation could be useful in Spain in order topromote cooperation between central government and the AC in settlingthe scope of their competences without unconstitutionally challenging thedistribution of powers provided by the Constitution...|$|E
