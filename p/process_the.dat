5|$|Because it {{cannot be}} readily {{produced}} {{by reduction of}} its dioxide, titanium metal is obtained by reduction of TiCl4 with magnesium metal in the Kroll <b>process.</b> <b>The</b> complexity of this batch production in the Kroll process explains the relatively high market value of titanium, despite the Kroll process being less expensive than the Hunter process. To produce the TiCl4 required by the Kroll <b>process,</b> <b>the</b> dioxide is subjected to carbothermic reduction {{in the presence of}} chlorine. In this <b>process,</b> <b>the</b> chlorine gas is passed over a red-hot mixture of rutile or ilmenite in the presence of carbon. After extensive purification by fractional distillation, the TiCl4 is reduced with 800°C molten magnesium in an argon atmosphere. Titanium metal can be further purified by the van Arkel–de Boer process, which involves thermal decomposition of titanium tetraiodide.|$|E
